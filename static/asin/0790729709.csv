92268,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790729709,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","The 90's was all about melodrama, especially in the early years.  Almost every big budget movie was formatted like a made for television Lifetime soap complete with slinky scores consisting of horns luring us into the theaters.  The fact that this was originally intended to be made in the 70's starring Diana Ross and Steve McQueen is a real interesting fact because the 70's was all about grit and it would have spurned a very different movie (also since those two 70's stars had more actorly talent than the stars of this 90's hit).  I almost wish I could see THAT version, since this one was so...well, meh.Like I mentioned in my title, this is entertaining, but it isn't enthralling or really all that memorable.  It feels very much like a made for TV film, right down to the cringe worthy dialog and the horrible acting (sorry, but Whitney was atrocious here).The film centers on an arrogant diva named Rachel Marron who is living the high life as a pop star and looking forward to winning an Oscar.  Unbeknownst to her, she has been receiving creepy letters from some psycho talking about her death and someone broke into her house and so she is receiving a new bodyguard who she isn't even sure she needs.  That bodyguard is Frank, the man with only one facial feature and no real personality.  Things get more complicated when Frank and Rachel get intimate and Rachel's jealous sister stars to bare her teeth and then someone tries to get dirty and actually kill Rachel and then she wins the Oscar and, well, she closes the movie by singing `I Will Always Love You' in a strange moment that doesn't entirely make sense.Whitney's acting is scary bad, and Costner mopes his way through another performance.  The bad guys are easily spotted (so predictable) and some of the scenes are so bizarrely overdramatized in a way that isn't necessary.  Still, it was fun, I guess, and the music is killer (although the segments that show Rachel's music videos are laugh out loud hilarious).  It's funny to me that the star song of this film was `I Will Always Love You', which was a cover of the Dolly Parton hit from the 80's (`Best Little Whorehouse').  Like, that was a dumb move, especially since `I Have Nothing' is arguably a better song and yet suffered by being a shadowy feature and never made a focal point.  `I Have Nothing' is even a better song than the Oscar winning `A Whole New World' and could have won (probably not, considering how beloved `Aladdin' was and still is) but it really had no shot thanks to `I Will Always Love You' hogging all the attention.Bah.Anyways, this is a guilty pleasure, but I don't feel guilty about not really liking it all that much.  I understand the fans, but this is kind of lame and makes for a time waster that is only advisable on a day when you really want to waste time.",2,A semi-entertaining soap opera as only the 90's can make them...,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,2822,"['90', 'was', 'melodrama', 'especially', 'early', 'years', 'Almost', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', 'formatted', 'made', 'television', 'Lifetime', 'complete', 'slinky', 'scores', 'consisting', 'horns', 'luring', 'theaters', 'fact', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'made', '70', 'starring', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'real', 'interesting', 'fact', '70', 'was', 'grit', 'would', 'have', 'spurned', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'also', 'two', '70', 'stars', 'had', 'more', 'actorly', 'talent', 'stars', '90', 'hit', 'almost', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'version', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'meh.Like', 'mentioned', 'title', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'enthralling', 'really', 'memorable', 'very', 'much', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'right', 'down', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'dialog', 'horrible', 'acting', 'sorry', 'Whitney', 'was', 'atrocious', 'here', '.The', 'film', 'centers', 'arrogant', 'diva', 'named', 'Rachel', 'Marron', 'who', 'living', 'high', 'life', 'pop', 'star', 'looking', 'forward', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Unbeknownst', 'been', 'receiving', 'creepy', 'letters', 'psycho', 'talking', 'death', 'someone', 'broke', 'house', 'so', 'receiving', 'new', 'bodyguard', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'sure', 'bodyguard', 'Frank', 'man', 'only', 'one', 'facial', 'feature', 'real', 'personality', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Frank', 'Rachel', 'get', 'intimate', 'Rachel', 'jealous', 'sister', 'stars', 'bare', 'teeth', 'then', 'someone', 'tries', 'get', 'dirty', 'actually', 'kill', 'Rachel', 'then', 'Oscar', 'well', 'movie', 'singing', 'Will', 'Always', 'Love', 'strange', 'moment', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'make', 'sense.Whitney', 'acting', 'scary', 'bad', 'Costner', 'way', 'performance', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'easily', 'spotted', 'so', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'bizarrely', 'overdramatized', 'way', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'Still', 'was', 'fun', 'guess', 'music', 'killer', 'segments', 'show', 'Rachel', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'hilarious', 'funny', 'star', 'song', 'film', 'was', 'Will', 'Always', 'Love', 'was', 'cover', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'hit', '80', 'Best', 'Little', 'Whorehouse', 'was', 'dumb', 'move', 'especially', 'Have', 'Nothing', 'arguably', 'better', 'song', 'yet', 'suffered', 'being', 'shadowy', 'feature', 'never', 'made', 'focal', 'point', 'Have', 'Nothing', 'even', 'better', 'song', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Whole', 'New', 'World', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'probably', 'not', 'considering', 'how', 'beloved', 'Aladdin', 'was', 'still', 'really', 'had', 'shot', 'thanks', 'Will', 'Always', 'Love', 'hogging', 'attention.Bah.Anyways', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'guilty', 'not', 'really', 'liking', 'that', 'much', 'understand', 'fans', 'kind', 'lame', 'time', 'waster', 'only', 'advisable', 'day', 'when', 'really', 'want', 'waste', 'time']",The Bodyguard Full Screen Edition

92281,A13GEXUA4SJ8J5,0790729709,Carol Hunt,"[6, 15]","There are some parts of this movie that don't check for me.One major issue is that the screen writer clearly has an understanding for how race plays out in film, yet still deliberately creates a movie that is racially insensitive.  Typically, media is viewed seriously for subtle racist messages, and unfortunately, this movie fails although appearing to be just the opposite.Costner is presented as the hero for which the movie cannot do without.  He has a whole cast of sidekicks to help him to complete the task including the black limo driver that he recruits by informing him that if he doesn't become his side kick he will be killed because the ""cocky black soffer"" always dies by being in attentive.  The driver is a racial stereotype of a young lazy black man that has to be directed by a white superior.  The writer clearly understands that these racist roles are created for blacks but chooses to recreate bad roles for African Americans.  I do not know why.The depiction of black women in this movie is also extremely poor.  Whitney Houstan is not just spoiled; she is sexually irresponsible.  She is a stereotype of a successful African American female.  In one screen she almost has sex with the man plotting to kill her because she is angry at her boyfriend Costner, and wants to make him jealous.  Her character is immature.  Her sister is so sexually dysfunctional that she attempts also to sleep with Costner even though she knows that she would be sleeping with her own sister's lover.  I have an issue with this.  Not only does it reproduce patterns of male domination (females cannot be trusted) it also depicts black females as being sexually immoral. Like Houstan, her camera sister is extremely immature and needs the guidance of a white male played by Costner.The character of Rachel leaves much to be desired as far as a woman is concerned.  She is inconsiderate and abuses the people that work for her.  She also sexually harasses Costner and than tantrums on her own employee when he stops sleeping with her.  We are supposed to view that in line with her Leo character type, but her character is really just immature.  It doesn't make sense either since a singer as successful as the one she is playing would have to have a lot of discipline. The portrayal was just unfortunate.Costner's character is the usual white male come to fix problems all the problems of irrational (black) people.  That Costner must in fact fix the mess made by these two sisters is reaffirmed when Rachel's sister ends up being the one behind the murder plot.  It is really just pitifully prejudice. Blacks cannot have legitimate threats against them without them really being about killing each other. Rachel's sister is jealous, murderous, and caddy.  The actress cast is one of the most beautiful minority women but she is in the role of a criminal that would kill her own sister over petty jealousy.  The story is really ridiculous, and sad to point out, but it is a racist movie.I like Costner, but his character also needs tuning.  He is emotionally constipated to the point of being abusive. He beats up some man just for giving him lip.  He also jilts Houstan after sleeping with her, and this is supposed to some how prove that he is better at his job.  It just places him in the position of being in control rather than his female partner. That seems to be the main function of the scenes inclusion; a white male is always in control no matter how subordinate his position realistically would be.The interracial love story would be interesting if the couple did not break up at the end of the film for no appealing reason. Again, when viewed for a general pattern most of these interracial movies end the same way; the couple is delegitimized. The Bodygaurd is no exception. The problems with this film could have been corrected easily, by simply making Houstan more mature, removing the jilting scene as it doesn't make sense, and not breaking the couple apart at the end of film--the major change would also be not making another black person really behind the murder plot.",2,"The idea was not bad, but the script just doesn't deliver.",1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,4090,"['are', 'parts', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'check', 'me.One', 'major', 'issue', 'screen', 'writer', 'clearly', 'understanding', 'how', 'race', 'out', 'film', 'still', 'deliberately', 'movie', 'racially', 'insensitive', 'Typically', 'media', 'viewed', 'seriously', 'subtle', 'racist', 'messages', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'appearing', 'be', 'just', 'opposite.Costner', 'presented', 'hero', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'whole', 'cast', 'sidekicks', 'help', 'complete', 'task', 'including', 'black', 'limo', 'driver', 'informing', ""n't"", 'become', 'side', 'kick', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'cocky', 'black', 'soffer', 'always', 'being', 'attentive', 'driver', 'racial', 'stereotype', 'young', 'lazy', 'black', 'man', 'be', 'directed', 'white', 'superior', 'writer', 'clearly', 'racist', 'roles', 'are', 'created', 'blacks', 'chooses', 'recreate', 'bad', 'roles', 'African', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why.The', 'depiction', 'black', 'women', 'movie', 'also', 'extremely', 'poor', 'Whitney', 'Houstan', 'not', 'just', 'spoiled', 'sexually', 'irresponsible', 'stereotype', 'successful', 'African', 'American', 'female', 'one', 'screen', 'almost', 'sex', 'man', 'plotting', 'kill', 'angry', 'boyfriend', 'Costner', 'make', 'jealous', 'character', 'immature', 'sister', 'so', 'sexually', 'dysfunctional', 'also', 'sleep', 'Costner', 'even', 'would', 'be', 'sleeping', 'own', 'sister', 'lover', 'have', 'issue', 'Not', 'only', 'reproduce', 'patterns', 'male', 'domination', 'females', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'also', 'black', 'females', 'being', 'sexually', 'immoral', 'Houstan', 'camera', 'sister', 'extremely', 'immature', 'guidance', 'white', 'male', 'played', 'Costner.The', 'character', 'Rachel', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'as', 'far', 'woman', 'concerned', 'inconsiderate', 'people', 'work', 'also', 'sexually', 'Costner', 'tantrums', 'own', 'employee', 'when', 'sleeping', 'are', 'supposed', 'view', 'line', 'Leo', 'character', 'type', 'character', 'really', 'just', 'immature', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'singer', 'as', 'successful', 'one', 'playing', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'lot', 'discipline', 'portrayal', 'was', 'just', 'unfortunate.Costner', 'character', 'usual', 'white', 'male', 'come', 'fix', 'problems', 'problems', 'irrational', 'black', 'people', 'Costner', 'must', 'fact', 'fix', 'mess', 'made', 'two', 'sisters', 'reaffirmed', 'when', 'Rachel', 'sister', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'murder', 'plot', 'really', 'just', 'pitifully', 'prejudice', 'Blacks', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'legitimate', 'threats', 'really', 'being', 'killing', 'other', 'Rachel', 'sister', 'jealous', 'murderous', 'caddy', 'actress', 'cast', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'minority', 'women', 'role', 'criminal', 'would', 'kill', 'own', 'sister', 'petty', 'jealousy', 'story', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'sad', 'point', 'out', 'racist', 'movie.I', 'Costner', 'character', 'also', 'tuning', 'emotionally', 'constipated', 'point', 'being', 'abusive', 'up', 'man', 'just', 'giving', 'lip', 'also', 'jilts', 'Houstan', 'sleeping', 'supposed', 'how', 'prove', 'better', 'job', 'just', 'position', 'being', 'control', 'rather', 'female', 'partner', 'be', 'main', 'function', 'scenes', 'inclusion', 'white', 'male', 'always', 'control', 'matter', 'how', 'subordinate', 'position', 'realistically', 'would', 'be.The', 'interracial', 'love', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'couple', 'did', 'not', 'break', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'appealing', 'reason', 'Again', 'when', 'viewed', 'general', 'pattern', 'most', 'interracial', 'movies', 'end', 'same', 'way', 'couple', 'delegitimized', 'Bodygaurd', 'exception', 'problems', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'easily', 'simply', 'making', 'Houstan', 'more', 'mature', 'removing', 'jilting', 'scene', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'not', 'breaking', 'couple', 'apart', 'end', 'film', 'major', 'change', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'not', 'making', 'black', 'person', 'really', 'murder', 'plot']",The Bodyguard Full Screen Edition

For instance, the esteemed critics, Siskel and Ebert once dismissed a film called ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" as just fluff but history proved that the film would endure and in fact has had several DVD releases including one in Blu-ray.  I'm not saying that this film is an artistic triumph like Costner's ""Dances with Wolves"" or Eastwood's latest films like ""The Changeling"" or ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", but as a pulp film, it's a success.  My acting coach at the time in San Francisco called it ""enjoyable trash"" and I agree with her. If you don't expect a lot, you'll get a lot.  I really like that this film in the pre-Obama era, played down the inter-racial angle and more the conflict between celebrity and private life.  Like Obama has stated there are more important issues to deal with than just the racial aspect--and this film proved it.  Houston was never more alluring and Costner is pitch perfect as the Zen like ex-Secret Service man who is reluctant to continue his assignment of protecting a pop star he has fallen in love with--""never get involved with the person you're protecting"".  Now that Houston's career is on the mend, it would be great if there is a sequel.

That said, ""The Bodyguard"" script does have something to say:  For me, it's about that very human experience of being in a work situation, a role, a situation, and having to deal with those impulses and emotions that sometimes conflict with our ability to be successful, or ethical, or even, honest with ourselves.  Kevin Costner was perfect for this production and carried it off, as one of his better performances.  Of course, reality would not be so dramatic, but by the time the climax occurs, we are rooting for the good guy, and can't really turn back.  You might say, ""The Bodyguard"" story is really a Western in urban clothing.  Anyway, Whitney is well cast, and does a good job to remain natural and not attempt to overact.

I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. I chose it because I've enjoyed Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves) and I've liked Whitney Houston's music, although I had no idea she was a movie actress as well. Go figure. Well, I didn't particularly enjoy the movie. The acting seemed weak as well as the plot and I just never could get into the story to any depth. As such, it became a ho-hum late night movie and will easily be forgotten a few nights later. I enjoyed Houston's singing, and it was especially poignant in the light of all the news of her recent death.In the movie, Kostner played a body guard employed to protect Houston from a deranged stalker. Kostner had previous experience as a Secret Service Agent during the time of the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt. and he tightened security around her immensely, even  though she was constantly protesting. However, protecting a popular super-star when she is up for an Academy Award and appears in large crowds of fans is an almost super-human task. Well, he managed and the story had to do with how he managed. It's rather interesting in places. Oh yes, and of course, Kostner managed to fall in love with Houston along the way, which provided a little side story.  The movie is well put together. All in all, I'd say it's a weak movie, but not a bad movie. It's a bit of a yawner and I was expecting more..Gary Peterson",4,Interesting In Places.

92321,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0790729709,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 4]","Fans of Whitney Houston will certainly enjoy this movie.  It captures her at close to her career peak and features a few of her better known hits (including her version of ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""I Have Nothing"").  Neither she nor co-star Kevin Costner fare as well on the acting end.  Since Houston later proved to be effective in WAITING TO EXHALE, I would guess that she either suffered from first film jitters or that she needed better direction--or both.  The script is generally weak and the dialogue is stilted, and there are moments when the line readings are so off, you almost wonder if the stars' first language is something other than English.  And if the mark of a good director is the ability to coax a credible performance from a child actor, then Mick Jackson's abilities could be questioned on that basis alone: the young actor playing Whitney's son is stiff and awkward.  But given his ""mom's"" stilted line readings, it could be viewed as some kind of genetic condition.Amazon reviewer Jeff Shannon above jokes that Whitney's role as a show biz diva must have be a real ""stretch"" is clever.  But it's just possible that Whitney might have fared better with a role that was less close to her own life experience.  Getting out of high show biz mode seemed to help her performance a few years later in EXHALE, although it could also be the case that she was simply a bit more comfortable onscreen by that time.The supporting cast is also just OK, for the most part, although many have done better work elsewhere, so you do know they can act.  Ralph Waite, as the Costner's dad doesn't have a lot to do, but he brings a certain gravitas to his small role.  Probably the only performer who gets to shine in a real emotive moment is Michele Lamar Richards who plays Whitney's sister and manager.  Even that moment may strike some as a bit overdone, but at least you know that this is an actress who can summon real tears when they're needed.It's very easy to come away from a movie like the BODYGUARD feeling like you've been manipulated, but actually, it would have been naive to expect much else.  Hollywood movies about Hollywood life have an odd tension in them.  On the one hand, they can poke a few jabs at the superficiality and the glitz of So. Cal. ""culture,""  on the other hand they assume that the dream factory really is the object of fascination (and dreams) of their audience.  And maybe they're right to an extent.  But watching this movie some 15 years on, I couldn't help flashing on some of Ms Houston's subsequent career set backs and thining that this '92 film really is a sort of (inadvertant) indictment of show a biz culture that spoils and corrupts its ""players"" no matter how talented they are and, rather than fostering the creative process, actually works AGAINST it.",3,Whitney's Dubious Dramatic Debut,1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,2812,"['Fans', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'close', 'career', 'peak', 'few', 'better', 'known', 'hits', 'including', 'version', 'Will', 'Always', 'Love', 'Have', 'Nothing', 'co-star', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'end', 'Houston', 'later', 'proved', 'be', 'effective', 'WAITING', 'TO', 'EXHALE', 'would', 'guess', 'either', 'suffered', 'first', 'film', 'jitters', 'needed', 'better', 'direction', 'script', 'generally', 'weak', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'line', 'readings', 'are', 'so', 'off', 'almost', 'wonder', 'stars', 'first', 'language', 'something', 'other', 'English', 'mark', 'good', 'director', 'ability', 'coax', 'credible', 'performance', 'child', 'actor', 'then', 'Mick', 'Jackson', 'abilities', 'could', 'be', 'questioned', 'basis', 'alone', 'young', 'actor', 'playing', 'Whitney', 'son', 'stiff', 'awkward', 'given', 'mom', 'stilted', 'line', 'readings', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'kind', 'genetic', 'condition.Amazon', 'reviewer', 'Jeff', 'Shannon', 'jokes', 'Whitney', 'role', 'show', 'biz', 'diva', 'must', 'have', 'be', 'real', 'stretch', 'clever', 'just', 'possible', 'Whitney', 'might', 'have', 'fared', 'better', 'role', 'was', 'less', 'close', 'own', 'life', 'experience', 'Getting', 'high', 'show', 'biz', 'mode', 'seemed', 'help', 'performance', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'EXHALE', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'case', 'was', 'simply', 'bit', 'more', 'comfortable', 'onscreen', 'time.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'just', 'OK', 'most', 'part', 'many', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'work', 'elsewhere', 'do', 'know', 'can', 'act', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'Costner', 'dad', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'certain', 'gravitas', 'small', 'role', 'Probably', 'only', 'performer', 'who', 'shine', 'real', 'emotive', 'moment', 'Michele', 'Lamar', 'Richards', 'who', 'Whitney', 'sister', 'manager', 'Even', 'moment', 'may', 'strike', 'bit', 'overdone', 'least', 'know', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'summon', 'real', 'tears', 'when', ""'re"", 'very', 'easy', 'come', 'away', 'movie', 'BODYGUARD', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'manipulated', 'actually', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'naive', 'expect', 'much', 'else', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'life', 'have', 'odd', 'tension', 'one', 'hand', 'can', 'poke', 'few', 'jabs', 'superficiality', 'glitz', 'So', 'Cal', 'culture', 'other', 'hand', 'assume', 'dream', 'factory', 'really', 'object', 'fascination', 'dreams', 'audience', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'right', 'extent', 'watching', 'movie', '15', 'years', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'flashing', 'Ms', 'Houston', 'subsequent', 'career', 'set', 'backs', 'thining', 'film', 'really', 'sort', 'inadvertant', 'indictment', 'show', 'biz', 'culture', 'corrupts', 'players', 'matter', 'how', 'talented', 'are', 'rather', 'fostering', 'creative', 'process', 'actually']",The Bodyguard Full Screen Edition

92326,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0790729709,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[13, 15]","Stars fade, in time. But, at the summit of her talents and her popularity, Whitney Houston was simply untouchable, a singing phenom and, lord, was she lovely. Being so photogenic, it was a natural that she dip her toe into cinema. Whitney made her film acting debut in 1992's THE BODYGUARD, starring opposite Kevin Costner, who himself at the time was riding on a film career high, coming offDances with Wolves - Extended Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)andJFK - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition).Costner plays Frank Farmer, an ex-Secret Service agent who now hires out as a private bodyguard. Frank's vocation requires him to live a solitary, almost austere life. He doesn't stay too long at any one assignment for fear of forming attachments to the people he safeguards. Considered the best, Farmer is tapped to protect music and film superstar Rachel Marron, who is being relentlessly stalked. Farmer reluctantly takes on the gig and immediately clashes with the spirited and temperamental Rachel, who rails at the restrictions Farmer places on her lifestyle. And, because the long-proven cinematic formula dictates that the intensity of the leads' initial mutual dislike is adversely proportioned to how heated the romance becomes, well, the sparks fly brightly between the stoic bodyguard and the tempestuous diva.THE BODYGUARD, in 1992, was a box office moneymaker, undoubtedly helped by the spectacular soundtrack, but also because, in its own right, it's a decent thriller and an effective and bittersweet romantic story. The action sets are nice, my favorite being the ""We won't talk about this again"" kitchen discourse, although that was more of a one-way conversation from Frank. The hook is undeniably the prickly interaction between the two leads. I would think that a bodyguard, by necessity and by definition, would need to blend into the background. As such, Costner's bodyguard tends to be understated and very controlled. But every now and then, the actor's low key charisma does get a chance to leak out, as Farmer cracks a half-smile or three or makes the occasional straight-faced one-liner. And by having his character this impassive and guarded, Costner allows his female lead to shine. And Whitney's Rachel Marron certainly has that large personality.Casting Whitney Houston was a stroke of genius and luck. In that time and place, who better to play the most popular pop star than the real deal herself? I thought that Whitney was a natural on screen, although critics shaved points off because, supposedly, she was only playing herself. But do you think a non-singer could've pulled off the musical sequences with as much conviction and credibility? Whenever she sang, Whitney Houston was in her element, and I totally bought into it and, consequentially, everything else that came with the role. And, lest you think she's a one trick pony, she would show even more of her acting chops inWaiting to ExhaleandThe Preacher's Wife.There's this thing which Rachel's jerk of a manager tells Frank as he dresses him down: ""I mean, look, she's so hot right now. This is her time. If she doesn't get out there, she's dead... If she doesn't sing, she's dead, anyway."" This, coming from a tool, nevertheless is a stark commentary on the ephemeral quality of stardom. THE BODYGUARD has lost a bit of its luster down the years as Whitney's star waned. Not because she suddenly sucked or anything, but her troubled personal life did get in the way of her performing and producing records (thanks a bunch, Bobby Brown!).And, since misery loves company, Kevin Costner, after a string of film successes, would soon churn out A PERFECT WORLD, THE WAR, and the career-crippling WATERWORLD (which I actually thought was a cool flick).The key song was originally going to be ""What Becomes Of A Broken Heart?"" And who knows what Whitney would've done with that torch song (but it would've been great). As it is, we instead end up getting the fabulous remake of Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You."" I eventually got sick of this song, because of the constant airplay, but I remember how well it framed the closing moments of the film.Another thing I dug: Costner's white, Houston's black. This wasn't even a factor in the movie.

92339,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,0790729709,"John ""MovieAddict""","[3, 6]","You're going to see &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; spoofed a lot. Just two days ago I saw an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; with Homer saving Mark Hamill from a horde of geeks. As the song &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; swelled in the background, the image of Homer carrying an animated Mark in his arms filled the screen.Of course, the film itself isn't a good movie. &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; is, in fact, a very bad movie. But I like it, in an odd sort of way. It's one of those likable but stupid movies that make the time fly by on a Friday night -- unless, of course, you have something better to do than waste your time watching Kevin Costner attempt to act and Whitney Houston attempt to love him.The movie stars Kevin Costner as Frank Farmer, a bodyguard who blames himself for events from the past that come back to haunt him. Whitney Houston basically plays Whitney Houston (though the character's name is different in the film), a famous singer like herself who falls in love with her newly-aquired bodyguard and sparks an interracial romance that threatens her career almost as much as the death threats she has been receiving in the mail.Frank's mission is to protect her at all costs from the assassinator, who is not a metallic cyborg and who does not bear an uncanny resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger (though it would have helped market the film). The surprise at the end is that the killer is not who we think it is throughout -- so don't think at all! Just watch. I hope I didn't ruin any part of the movie for you. But don't tempt me -- I'm about to give away the rabid fan's identity to you.&quot;The Bodyguard&quot; is a big, mushy mess, filled with bad acting and bad scriptwriting. The entire movie is bad. It's way too long for its own good -- especially when it is broadcast on network television and stretched to a near three-hour showing. (Do they really provide fifty minutes of commercials these days on CBS?) I've seen the movie numerous times, on network television and unedited, and it always seems too long. But, despite its (extremely) bad traits, the movie is a lot of fun to watch.I don't like Kevin Costner. I think he is, what I call, a *blah* actor. He talks with such a lightweight mumble that it often induces sleep. If Costner wants to make money after his film career is depleted (that's happening, folks), he should market Costner Sleep Cassettes. Insert a cassette tape/CD of Kevin Costner reading your least favorite book, and you're guaranteed to fall asleep in less than five minutes -- or your money back!I found one great role that Kevin Costner has played over the years, and it was the role he played in &quot;The Untouchables,&quot; opposite Robert De Niro's Al Capone. Brian DePalma directed that movie, and it worked because the role for Costner fit his dull acting talent. Watching him attempt to *really* act is quite sad. Remember his interpretation of Robin Hood? Some people liked it, but I thought it was a disgrace to Robin Hood.For what it's worth, Costner is good here, mainly because he acts like a dull bodyguard who is required to show absolutely no feelings whatsoever. His character basically walks around with a single expression on his face throughout the film, including while he's on a date with Whitney and the night after (if you know what I mean).The movie sparked a lot of controversy because the couple embrace in a passionate kiss at the end of the film. If you don't mind sitting through bad acting, bad directing, bad scriptwriting, all stretched out to two and a half hours...then this is the movie for you. I, personally, sorta like it.

The romance is hard to evolve, he is closed and she is playful, they are different. I liked when her and her sister sing together. They seemed together and connected by beautiful angel voices. The sabers I will put down, I saw many on one of my sojourns. The cabin with the snowfilled forest and mystical lake. The steam coming up from the walk at Whitneys mansion and statue lined drive, to jog and run in that steamy foresty town. The voice and the energy she emits, it is so viable so alive, It is extremely hard for me to think she used, too much flowing energy coming from her being. Her confidence and her poise. The family moments at the cabin, cooking, playing chess, holding each other, boating on a placid glass of water.

I find it embarrassing to turn it on again having watched it for the first time a couple weeks ago and will throw out the DVD. The movie had really bad production values and seemed like a TV movie. All the acting is below par except for Kevin Costner, the script is LUDICROUS and makes light of the sister character's death, which defies belief. Whitney Houston's costumes are bizarre and not of that time or any time, something the director cooked up for no discernible reason except to objectivize her. There's nothing realistic about the actress' side of life, they tried to make the bodyguard activities realistic. You'd think they would have put more into the details of her life, but they made it super cheesey, gave her unbelievable, super naive employees, and convenient but unconvincing relatives. She doesn't seem that committed to her career, has no problems or issues to deal with other than safety, and it's hard to believe she'd be up for any award whatsoever, let alone a best acting award. The relationship between Houston and Costner is unpleasant, boring, and they have no chemistry.The director and writer deserve the blame for this movie and watching them on the DVD extra features they don't come off very well. Based on this movie they should stop making them.Whitney Houston could have performed far better had she directed by the right director.

Too many suckers fall for this kind of thing, when they see a special edition of their favourite movies, only to be disappointed. I'm disappointed, cos I couldn't even sit through the whole featurette, but I bought mine on the cheap. So it's not that big a loss. And lets face it, Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" spent about 14 weeks (correct me if I'm wrong on that I'm just guessing) at the top of the UK charts, and I'm sick of seeing the video now. 13 years after the film was originally released would have warranted some decent extras. I suppose we'll have to wait until the 25th anniversary of this film to see if we get any decent DVD release - which so didn't happen with Grease, it's well past it's 25th anniversary, and still no special edition.Back to the film. I love this movie! The only thing that's stopping it from getting four stars is the dismal DVD release. It's so nice to see Whitney Houston the way she was, rather than the way she is now - talk about fame going to your head. She's never had a big a hit as she did with the aforementioned song, and that's been her downfall. The soundtrack album to this movie became one of the largest-selling soundtrack albums in history. To date, it has sold over 17 million copies. Sales were fueled by the success of the song ""I Will Always Love You"" which was written by Dolly Parton. According to Soundscan, the top-selling soundtrack was ""Saturday Night Fever"" album with 22 million albums sold to date.It's also my favourite Kevin Costner movie so far, as he's absolutely terrific in this. And for once, there's actually some chemistry between the two lead stars, which always helps towards a ""romantic comedy"".I would only recommend getting this so-called special edition DVD for very, very cheap.

But instead of celebrating 2 massive anniversaries for Whitney, including the 25th anniversary of her becoming the first songstress to have a album debut at #1 on Billboard and the 20th anniversary of The Bodyguard, and her work in the upcoming remake of Sparkle, we are dealing and reeling with the horrific and deviating loss of her life. Her songs and voice have always been some of the most intimate and soulful sonnets I have ever heard during the most trying to times. The Bodyguard is no exception with her first starring movie role with Kevin Costner. The film has been a instant classic for her fans and family. Hard to believe a role that was originally made for Diana Ross and cancelled in the 70's, became Whitney's acting opus in 1992, and still is just as strong as her voice. Now with the movie coming to Blu-Ray, we still celebrate this movie masterpiece for in Whitney's loving memory, and the joy her songs have brought us during the hardest of times.The Bodyguard remains a classic and Whitney's chemistry with Kevin Costner is classic. The story honestly focuses on Rachel Marron, a star-celebrated actress and celebrity whom is stalked and is a target for murder. The chemistry that is there as a diva whom is known for her music and spirit the world over, deals with celebrating her life and a dash of tempermental ego, but finds love in the most strangest of ways with falling in love with the bodyguard hired to protect her Frank, played by Kevin. The chemistry in music and movies is definitively strong here in each and every turn from not just Whitney alone with her songs like I Have Nothing, the beautiful Run To You and of course the definitive I Will Always Love You, but also from others like Joe Cocker with Trust In Me to name a few. The chemistry and love in the film is absolutely amazing, and tugs at the deepest of heartstrings, in heart, soul and especially in spirit. The extras here also show including the definitive video for I Will Always Love You, where Whitney is sitting down, while pregnant with her baby Bobbi Kristina, just singing her heart out. The movie is just as bold today, as it was when it originally came out 20 years ago.Overall, if you are new to Whitney Houston's music and movies, because of the sadness of having to say goodbye to her in death, we will always have a moment to celebrate her life and how she touched us in heart, soul and especially in spirits all over the world. The Bodyguard is a everlasting masterpiece from start to finish, and still shows why she was so talented from every angle in life.

92376,A11UO96AKBCGSZ,0790729709,Mickey Ryan,"[8, 14]","On March 30, 1981, just 69 days into the presidency of Ronald Reagan, deranged Texas native John Hinkley Jr. attempted to assassinate the President over some bizarre obsession with Jodi Foster. Written in the 1970s originally intended for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross, the 90s 'The Bodyguard' uses this real-life incident as a plot-angle in this romantic suspense thriller that has an absolutely superb concept, yet comes short on total execution. The beautiful and tragic Whitney Houston plays herself basically here as music superstar Rachel Marron with the misfortune a perverted and quite ruthless stalker who seems hell-bent on killing her. Enter Frank Farmer (Costner), a former U.S. Secret Service agent, also considered 'the best', in Hollywood's classic cliche, is talked into being her protector. You see, Farmer was Reagan's bodyguard in 81', yet the one day he's not on duty is when the assassination attempt takes place. This haunts him to this very day. Rachel's clearly attracted to him the moment she lays eyes on him, and shows it by being a b!ch (don't worry gals, we get it) about his expertise in the art of protection interfering in her lifestyle. Heavy romance develops between the two, then there's some twists and turns in the plot and sh! hits the fan.The one thing I do admire most about this film is the interracial love story is told without any reason to rationalize it for stupid reasons. Ethnicity isn't brought up, just two adults falling for eachother under the circumstances. And I also think that adds to the romantic tension between the two in a pleasant way. This is quite rare in Hollywood. Unfortunately though, the movie starts to gradually collapse about 2/3's of the way through. It gets insubstantial and even too slow at some points. The ending is semi-cool, yet, again, predictable - can pretty much be seen a mile away. But don't forget to look out for Robert Wuhl playing himself in a hilarious cameo.Overall 3/5.",3,A man's character is his guardian divinity,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,1960,"['March', '30', '1981', 'just', '69', 'days', 'presidency', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'deranged', 'Texas', 'native', 'John', 'Hinkley', 'Jr.', 'attempted', 'assassinate', 'President', 'bizarre', 'obsession', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'Written', '1970s', 'originally', 'intended', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Diana', 'Ross', '90s', 'Bodyguard', 'uses', 'real-life', 'incident', 'plot-angle', 'romantic', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'concept', 'yet', 'short', 'total', 'execution', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'basically', 'here', 'music', 'superstar', 'Rachel', 'Marron', 'misfortune', 'perverted', 'quite', 'ruthless', 'stalker', 'who', 'hell-bent', 'killing', 'Enter', 'Frank', 'Farmer', 'Costner', 'former', 'U.S.', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'also', 'considered', ""'the"", 'best', 'Hollywood', 'classic', 'cliche', 'talked', 'being', 'protector', 'see', 'Farmer', 'was', 'Reagan', 'bodyguard', '81', 'yet', 'one', 'day', 'not', 'duty', 'when', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'place', 'very', 'day', 'Rachel', 'clearly', 'attracted', 'moment', 'eyes', 'being', 'b', 'ch', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'gals', 'get', 'expertise', 'art', 'protection', 'interfering', 'lifestyle', 'Heavy', 'romance', 'two', 'then', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'sh', 'fan.The', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'admire', 'most', 'film', 'interracial', 'love', 'story', 'told', 'reason', 'rationalize', 'stupid', 'reasons', 'Ethnicity', ""n't"", 'brought', 'up', 'just', 'two', 'adults', 'falling', 'eachother', 'circumstances', 'also', 'think', 'romantic', 'tension', 'two', 'pleasant', 'way', 'quite', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'gradually', 'collapse', '2/3', ""'s"", 'way', 'insubstantial', 'even', 'too', 'slow', 'points', 'ending', 'semi-cool', 'yet', 'again', 'predictable', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'be', 'seen', 'mile', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'look', 'out', 'Robert', 'Wuhl', 'playing', 'hilarious', 'cameo.Overall', '3/5']",The Bodyguard Full Screen Edition

The chemistry between Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner seemed pretty good, but Costner seemed so dry much of the time, but maybe that suited his character more - someone who doesn't let his feelings show.

The film got mixed reviews ( more bad than good ) and didn't do so great at the box office. It was the music that was the ultimate highlight. Without Whitney's hit soundtrack, The Bodyguard would have sunk faster than the Titanic.The Bodyguard disappoints from the getgo with it's half-done plot and unbelievable script. Kevin Costner is disappointing. Back then he'd finished Dances With Wolves and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. His career had never been so high but the bomb of The Bodyguard proved it only takes one film to slow down a career. The major flaw was Whitney Houston. Whitney's acting was terrible despite this being her first film. I was disappointed because I've seen Whitney acting on sitcoms from the 80s and her acting was better then than it was in The Bodyguard. Costner and Houston had no chemistry. Why did they have to be romantically involved? Oh...I remember...to sell those sappy love songs on the soundtrack. That had to be the only reason because the film would have been better without the forced love story. Whitney's character was unbelievable. No one is so self-centered that they will risk their life just to go shopping. Nothing added up and if it wasn't for the soundtrack this film wouldn't be memorable at all. But now that it's twelve years later the soundtrack is even forgettable.  Can't really recommend this DVD. There were no extra features and the movie was only available in standard!  WB has to do better with their DVDs. The Bodyguard has some entertaining points but it can't hold its own with acting, plot or excitement.Skip the film but buy the soundtrack.

The only big problem with this movie is that Whitney's character, Rachel, curses more than half the time. If you have a child that you don't think is old enough to listen to Whitney Houston saying the F word, I suggest you tape this off TV (it's always on) and watch that copy when with your child, as they always edit the curses out.

92429,A2W6UY1E7YI3BG,0790729709,"Wayne D. Olson ""John du Prey""","[0, 0]","This action film (with its stunning soundtrack) reaffirms a cherished tradition for nobility under fire. Some of the great warriors throughout history were bodyguards for women. Overtures, codes of conduct, epic stories of chivalry and unrelenting heroism, were written to honor those who took a sword or bullet for the women, under their protective wing. Rules of conduct prevailed in antiquity, even for passionate men, who found themselves in service to and falling in love with women of noble birth.To hold dear the memory of service and requited love to a wealthy woman: this would be the premise of Bodyguard, the motion picture. Accepting the consequences of shielding a celebrity from her attackers is the duty assigned our hero. He is the one who strikes the match to passion between client and guardian; she may light up the sky with her fierce temperment, but he presides over the calmness, that measures out discretionary love, subdued passion, and quiet intimacy between a woman and a man.The lyrical beauty of the soundtrack permeates the relationship between our two main characters (played by Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston); this, in turn, allows pure romanticism to prevail as an undercurrent, and permits the bold eye contact between lovers to secure the bonds of stoic passion. This merge of powerful voice and orchestration with the heightened tension of a certain attack on our heroine drives the crescendo upward into the major climax, at the awards' show. The grateful client honors her bodyguard with her words (and in song cherishes his devoted love to her). Chivalry remains paramount in this powerful film.",5,John du Prey - Classical Review,1245110400,"06 16, 2009",2009,1637,"['action', 'film', 'stunning', 'soundtrack', 'cherished', 'tradition', 'nobility', 'fire', 'great', 'warriors', 'history', 'were', 'bodyguards', 'women', 'Overtures', 'codes', 'conduct', 'epic', 'stories', 'chivalry', 'unrelenting', 'heroism', 'were', 'written', 'honor', 'who', 'took', 'sword', 'bullet', 'women', 'protective', 'wing', 'Rules', 'conduct', 'prevailed', 'antiquity', 'even', 'passionate', 'men', 'who', 'found', 'service', 'falling', 'love', 'women', 'noble', 'birth.To', 'hold', 'dear', 'memory', 'service', 'requited', 'love', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'premise', 'Bodyguard', 'motion', 'picture', 'Accepting', 'consequences', 'shielding', 'celebrity', 'attackers', 'duty', 'assigned', 'hero', 'one', 'who', 'match', 'passion', 'client', 'guardian', 'may', 'light', 'up', 'sky', 'fierce', 'temperment', 'calmness', 'out', 'discretionary', 'love', 'subdued', 'passion', 'quiet', 'intimacy', 'woman', 'man.The', 'lyrical', 'beauty', 'soundtrack', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'turn', 'pure', 'romanticism', 'prevail', 'undercurrent', 'bold', 'eye', 'contact', 'lovers', 'secure', 'bonds', 'stoic', 'passion', 'merge', 'powerful', 'voice', 'orchestration', 'heightened', 'tension', 'certain', 'attack', 'heroine', 'crescendo', 'upward', 'major', 'climax', 'awards', 'show', 'grateful', 'client', 'honors', 'bodyguard', 'words', 'song', 'cherishes', 'devoted', 'love', 'Chivalry', 'paramount', 'powerful', 'film']",The Bodyguard Full Screen Edition
