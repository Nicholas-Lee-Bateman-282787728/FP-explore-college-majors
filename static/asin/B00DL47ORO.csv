1657595,A38RPCC9EXH41N,B00DL47ORO,"Allen M. Lewis ""the original book worm""","[1, 1]","This refers to the Blu-ray version of this documentary.I have seen other expos&eacute;s by concerned environmentalists or activists.  Too often, the creators of such documentaries let their passion for the caused at hand overwhelm their technical good sense and what could have been an effective presentation falls far short.,Happily, this was not the case in this instance. My wife had done extensive delving into this story on the web and brought out some interesting facts about this documentary which explained why it was focused as it was and what its purpose was. Any person who has concerns about how animals in captivity would definitely get the message that places like Sea World should not be considered as completely innocent animal shows.  Although this story was mainly focused on one orca - Tilikum - what was presented was enough to make a general case that these types of shows are exploitive of these magnificent creatures.The comments by former trainer/employees of Sea World were enough to make the case that this form of &#34;entertainment&#34; has nothing to do with conservation or improving the environment.  What it is is abuse of one intelligent species by another. I would make the equivalence to what is done to orcas at places like Sea World to chattel slavery.My wife and I were pleased by the fact that this documentary did not attempt to be too graphic. That would have been overkill and probably would have distorted the message that I think the creaotr was trying to make.  It is a work which speaks for itself and allows the viewer to come to their own conclusion. It makes the case against captivity of these magnificent creaters without beating the viewer over the head with it.Well done!",5,Better than I expected,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1724,"['Blu-ray', 'version', 'documentary.I', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'expos', 'eacute', 's', 'concerned', 'environmentalists', 'activists', 'Too', 'often', 'creators', 'such', 'documentaries', 'let', 'passion', 'caused', 'hand', 'overwhelm', 'technical', 'good', 'sense', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'presentation', 'far', 'short.', 'Happily', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'instance', 'My', 'wife', 'had', 'done', 'extensive', 'delving', 'story', 'web', 'brought', 'out', 'interesting', 'facts', 'documentary', 'explained', 'why', 'was', 'focused', 'was', 'what', 'purpose', 'was', 'Any', 'person', 'who', 'concerns', 'how', 'animals', 'captivity', 'would', 'definitely', 'get', 'message', 'Sea', 'World', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'completely', 'innocent', 'animal', 'shows', 'story', 'was', 'mainly', 'focused', 'one', 'orca', 'Tilikum', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'general', 'case', 'types', 'shows', 'are', 'exploitive', 'magnificent', 'creatures.The', 'comments', 'former', 'trainer/employees', 'Sea', 'World', 'were', 'enough', 'make', 'case', 'form', '34', 'entertainment', '34', 'nothing', 'do', 'conservation', 'improving', 'environment', 'What', 'abuse', 'one', 'intelligent', 'species', 'would', 'make', 'equivalence', 'what', 'done', 'orcas', 'places', 'Sea', 'World', 'chattel', 'slavery.My', 'wife', 'were', 'pleased', 'fact', 'documentary', 'did', 'not', 'attempt', 'be', 'too', 'graphic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'overkill', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'distorted', 'message', 'think', 'creaotr', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'work', 'viewer', 'come', 'own', 'conclusion', 'case', 'captivity', 'magnificent', 'creaters', 'beating', 'viewer', 'head', 'it.Well', 'done']",N/A

1657597,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DL47ORO,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","&#8216;Seaworld&#8217;.Most people have been there, but even if you haven&#8217;t, you know what it&#8217;s all about.  It&#8217;s been the secondary &#8216;Disney World&#8217; for years, decades, deemed the more respectable or educational family vacation spot by many for quite some time.  In fact, &#8216;Sea World&#8217; has been my family&#8217;s personal favorite vacation destination for almost six years now.Honestly, I did not want to see this film because I didn&#8217;t want to be swayed away from a place that truly makes me happy.Still, &#8216;Blackfish&#8217; has been garnering so much critical praise and has received such a warm welcome from audiences who have responded to its themes and its depictions of the perceived or assumed &#8216;real Sea World&#8217; and so, with all the collective yammering left and right I decided that this was a film I had to see.&#8216;Blackfish&#8217; is honestly a very powerful film.  The depictions of these beloved creatures being torn from their families and being confined in oversized bathtubs is heartbreaking, and the way that their treatment is described and the way that Tilikum is discussed is enough to make anyone swear off an establishment like &#8216;Sea World&#8217; in a heartbeat.  The heartfelt confessions from former &#8216;Sea World&#8217; trainers, their teary eyed accounts, are very convincing (especially in the first half of the film) and the way that the evidence is built around the &#8216;case&#8217; being presented really sways the audience in a particular direction.  To call it manipulative may not be entirely fair, considering that many of the points made regarding animal captivity really ring true and shouldn&#8217;t be contested, even by people who enjoy &#8216;Sea World&#8217; (I mean, even before I saw the film I knew that containing these magnificent creatures for my own enjoyment was morally wrong), but the film does fail to paint a complete picture and really establishes its own agenda rather quickly.&#8216;Blackfish&#8217; is VERY one-sided, and it&#8217;s not ashamed of that fact.&#8216;Blackfish&#8217; tries to get to the root of the &#8216;Sea World&#8217; problems by traveling back to the late 70&#8217;s, when boats were chartered and people were hired to rip infant orcas right out of the wild, separating them from their mothers and shoving them into captivity at an early age, in order to be trained from infancy to be entertainment for families.  This early footage and the testimonials by those involved (who didn&#8217;t have a direct relationship with &#8216;Sea World&#8217;) is very commanding and will move even the most stone-faced to empathy.Really, this is kidnapping.From this early point, &#8216;Sea World&#8217; and their ethics are cast in a very unfavorable light and the image doesn&#8217;t get any clearer.  Instead, they go into the attainment of a particular orca, Tilikum, who was attained in the early 80&#8217;s.  Tilikum has a violent history.  Due to abuse from his own kind (the female orcas who shared his living space were dominant and would attack him mercilessly), he grew frustrated and basically became a ticking timebomb.  Then, while he was an attraction at &#8216;Sealand&#8217;, he did the unthinkable.  He killed someone.  From that point forward, Tilikum&#8217;s history is unveiled and his track record of unexpected violence and the supposed deliberate white washing from &#8216;Sea World&#8217; in order to keep him (for breeding purposes) is exposed in full light, or at least the light the filmmakers wanted you to see.My issue with &#8216;Blackfish&#8217; is not that I necessarily disagree with them.  In fact, I tend to agree with every stand they are taking, but the film becomes so heavily one-sided that it starts to lose some credibility with me, especially when these former trainers begin to show traits of unbridled bitterness.  I mean, if the circumstances were THAT bad, why did you stay on for so long?  Don&#8217;t say you did it because &#8216;no one else would take care of Tilikum&#8217;, because you obviously weren&#8217;t taking care of him (and couldn&#8217;t, from what this film attests to).  When one of the trainers goes on and on about how they would NEVER want their children to think containment of these animals was normal, I started to shake my head.  I mean, these are the same people whose eyes lit up when they were discussing WHY they wanted to job in the first place.  To make claims that the animals only made connections with the trainers for the fish they were tossing in their mouths also felt like a falsified jab, since it kind of contradicted the claims that orcas have a higher sense of emotion than humans and even betrayed the tears that the trainers themselves were spilling over the treatment of these animals.In other words; &#8216;Blackfish&#8217; tries too hard.Still, the message being relayed is a very important one, and &#8216;Blackfish&#8217; is a very powerful and well-made film.  I think that it is a good conversation starter, and that it opens the door for more discussion.  I do wish that &#8216;Sea World&#8217; had opted to add to this conversation, and yet again, I don&#8217;t know if their comments would have been treated with fairness since the agenda of these filmmakers is so obvious.Now, the real question is; will I take my family back to &#8216;Sea World&#8217;?  Honestly, I don&#8217;t know.  There is no denying that watching these animals flaunt their power before your eyes is breathtaking and really a joy to experience, and the joy it brings to my children is unending.  While the series of events that bred a place like &#8216;Sea World&#8217; is questionable and morally reproachable even, we are talking about events that no longer take place (the actual ripping of these animals out of the wild).  Those savage beginnings are no more, and so one has to weigh out those incidents before casting a disdainful eye on an organization that has made obvious growth since the 70&#8217;s and has even done some very charitable and wonderful work with injured animals, nursing them to health and even releasing them back into the wild.  &#8216;Sea World&#8217; is not all evil and it is not all smoke and mirrors.  I wish that balance had been struck, instead of trying to sell &#8216;Sea World&#8217; as a giant pack of lies.  Still, Tilikum&#8217;s history speaks for itself, and the whitewashing of his past is cause for concern.  These are truly tragic and obviously cautionary tales, and they should cause someone to really ask themselves how appropriate these parks really are.So, I&#8217;m still mulling over my overall thoughts, but the message and the conversation are not only clear but important.",4,Out of the ocean and into the bathtub&#8230;,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,6738,"['8216', 'Seaworld', '8217',

If we continue to go to parks such as the Sea Worlds we are participating in the continuation of herding young whales and dolphins into enviroments that are unnatural and dangerous for both the trainers and the mammals they train.The only fault I found in this documentary was that is was not harsh enough in its portrayal of the effects these type of shows have on the animals.  I felt there should have been more history and more facts that really argue that aquarium parks need to outlaw, not only the Orca whale shows, but also the dolphin shows, as they are seriously inhumane and cause mental stress and illness to the creatures who are confined to small quarters and live out their lives in a depressive and hurtful enviroments.I felt very sorry for the trainer(s) that were injured and brutally killed by dysfunctional killer whales but I felt sorrier for the animals themselves who are at the mercy of people whose priority is making money at any cost.  There are other ways to show young people what treasures every animal on the planet is and it is not by making some of them clowns in a sick water circus.",4,Orcas Need To Be in Natural Enviroments,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,1746,"['BLACKFISH', 'important', 'documentary', 'lives', 'killer', 'whales', 'captivity', 'found', 'documentary', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'warning', 'whales', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'live', 'natural', 'enviroments', 'when', 'are', 'placed', 'parks', 'entertainment', 'humans', 'tragedy', 'can', 'happen', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'recent', 'tragedies', 'death', 'Sea', 'World', 'Orlando', 'trainer', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Orca', 'who', 'had', 'previous', 'behavioral', 'problems.I', 'am', 'fan', 'types', 'documentaries', 'most', 'important', 'voice', 'individual', 'can', 'express', 'what', 'consume', 'general', 'what', 'spend', 'money', 'continue', 'go', 'parks', 'such', 'Sea', 'Worlds', 'are', 'participating', 'continuation', 'herding', 'young', 'whales', 'enviroments', 'are', 'unnatural', 'dangerous', 'trainers', 'mammals', 'train.The', 'only', 'fault', 'found', 'documentary', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'harsh', 'enough', 'portrayal', 'effects', 'type', 'shows', 'have', 'animals', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'history', 'more', 'facts', 'really', 'argue', 'aquarium', 'parks', 'need', 'outlaw', 'not', 'only', 'Orca', 'whale', 'shows', 'also', 'dolphin', 'are', 'seriously', 'inhumane', 'cause', 'mental', 'stress', 'illness', 'creatures', 'who', 'are', 'confined', 'small', 'quarters', 'live', 'out', 'lives', 'depressive', 'hurtful', 'enviroments.I', 'felt', 'very', 'sorry', 'trainer', 'were', 'injured', 'brutally', 'killed', 'dysfunctional', 'killer', 'whales', 'felt', 'sorrier', 'animals', 'who', 'are', 'mercy', 'people', 'priority', 'making', 'money', 'cost', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'show', 'young', 'people', 'what', 'animal', 'planet', 'not', 'making', 'clowns', 'sick', 'water', 'circus']",N/A

There's no ""great conspiracy"" here; and to suggest otherwise is obscene.  Using anyone's death, to promote your personal agenda, regardless of the facts, is obscene, no matter how you try to skew it.A woman is dead... it is what it is... it happens, in every conceivable ""entity"", PUBLIC & PRIVATE -- THEY'RE WILD ANIMALS/MAMMALS -- it's just way more common for the Public Entities (aka: Zoos)... but they all behave & blame, the same way, afterward: ""Trainer error"", or whatever... because, as these dummies have proven, yet again, some people just can't accept the truth, no matter how how simple that truth is, so they have to blame the deceased, to keep from being sued by an idiot, litigious society &/or family members, who want to place blame everywhere, except where belongs.Moreover, 99% of everyone interviewed in this ""film"" who talk about the ""traumatized psychosis"" of these KILLER whales -- are not qualified, nor schooled, in the psychology of ANY species... And none, have clearly conducted a formal or informal psychoanalytical study of a whale's behavior before, during, and after ""capture"" -- Therefore, 99% of everything presented in this ""documentary"" as ""fact"" by the FEW semi-qualified to speak on such a matter, is still pure speculation & conjecture.-- And the people who SHOULD have been interviewed, weren't... or... those interviews didn't reflect the pre-determined ""message"" the Director wanted to put out, so they were discarded & left out of the, LOL, ""documentary"".That said, yes, common sense would dictate they (captured 'wilds') COULD & MAY VERY WELL BE ""scarred"" by the events... But there's NO evidence the Orcas ARE, nor, any other ""captured"" animal, mammal, reptile, etc.However, COMMON SENSE would also dictate, that these Trainers CHOSE A DANGEROUS PROFESSION, AND SOMETIMES, THAT DANGER BECOMES REALITY -- IT HAPPENS -- THEY KNOW THIS GOING IN & CHOOSE TO DO IT ANYWAY...

You don't blame the Animal/Mammal for the accident(s) because ""they're just animals and don't know any better"", or whatever... Well, you can't blame the ""entity"" either, because THEY DID NOT FORCE THE TRAINER TO BE A TRAINER, TO WORK THERE, etc.; and no matter how ""humanely"" a wild animal/mammal is captured, transported, and housed... it is, and will always be, (in this case, a LARGE), DANGEROUS, LETHAL THING... and no amount of ""training"" will remove that aspect of its nature!!-- I swear, it's like all notions of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY are as foreign as Orcas are to land!And the quote, ""There's no record of any Orca being violent in the wild"", was by far the most ludicrous of the countless, insane ramblings, offered up.  -- THEY'RE CARNIVOROUS (""KILLER"") WHALES YOU IDIOT!!!Plus, as if you can honestly compare the millions of hours of CONSTANT observation done in captivity, to A FEW HOURS of GLIMPSED ""activity"" out in the open ocean, as an actual comparison-argument... LOL; but they try, along with every other conceivable way, to mislead, and lie, rather than have an OPEN AND HONEST DEBATE about whether we should/shouldn't have captive 'wilds' at all (in 'Public' or 'Private' entities).-- Personally, I would be 100% fine if every 'wild' was returned to the wild, set free, and all Zoos, etc., were closed entirely/permanently... but that will never happen...

1657620,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00DL47ORO,C. Sawin,"[117, 145]","Killer whales have often been referred to as docile yet extremely intelligent and friendly creatures, but Gabriela Cowperthwaite's documentary ""Blackfish"" puts a bit of a different spin on it. While Orcas may be friendly out in the wild, they're also extremely family oriented meaning that one killer whale can't be ripped from its natural habitat or its pack and be placed in a concrete pool with a bunch of other strange killer whales and be considered a family or be expected to perform for our amusement without any sort of backlash. ""Blackfish"" takes a look at what the possible psychological effects of what happens when an Orca is taken from its family at a young age and mistreated nearly its entire life.""Blackfish"" mostly follows a killer whale named Tilikum who was captured at a young age back in 1983 in the North Atlantic. While you learn about Tilikum's upbringing, ""Blackfish"" also shines light on how shady SeaWorld operates as several former trainers speak out about how life threatening it is working with such massive creatures that the human species still doesn't fully understand.You'd think that becoming an animal trainer would require a marine biology degree of some kind or intense training. Most of these trainers were hired at a very young age, pulled off the street, and trained by SeaWorld. Meanwhile, Tilikum is sent to Sealand; a water park that is basically unfit for its killer whales. Basically a pool with a concrete barrier where the whales are stored in a steel box at night, Sealand is the type of run down water park that is just waiting for an incident to occur for it to be shut down. That incident occurred in February of 1991 when part-time trainer Keltie Byrne fell into the water and Tilikum ripped her apart in front of an audience.With each incident that occurs, whether it's a trainer getting injured or killed while being in the tank with a killer whale, SeaWorld sweeps the event under the rug while usually blaming it on the trainer and claiming that the animal isn't aggressive. One of the most devoted and safe trainers from SeaWorld, Dawn Brancheau, died in 2010 while trying to get Tilikum to perform. The SeaWorld employees lie about the facts of killer whales to the general public while the killer whales are often attacked by the other whales in the tank. When a killer whale is used to traveling 100 miles in a day and is just crammed into a small pool and forced to mingle with other whales it doesn't know something is bound to give. ""Blackfish"" reveals that there were whale hunts back in the early 70s where divers would steal and capture baby Orcas.Killer whales are a fascinating species. They're extremely intelligent, each family of whales seems to have their own distinct language, and they're just majestic and magnificent to watch. Mistreating them over such a long period of time, especially when their lifespan is nearly equivalent with a human (females can live to be 100 while males usually only live to be 50 or 60) is sure to cause some sort of psychological damage. Seeing so many people get injured in ""Blackfish"" is horrifying and hearing about the ones who died is devastating.It's unfortunate that ""Blackfish"" mentions SeaWorld refusing to partake in any interviews for the film because it would have been a welcome change of pace to hear their side of the story. Documentaries tend to shed light on one side of their subject just to get their message across. While it does make sense, it also feels overly influenced. The viewer is going to walk away feeling bad about the way killer whales are treated in captivity and hating SeaWorld, but how else can you view something like this if only one side of an argument is made with no one to really debate the matter?While ""Blackfish"" is extremely informative it also reveals a little too much at times. Realizing killer whales have a cleft in their brain that humans don't have at all is intriguing. Hearing that Tilikum is the largest whale in captivity and that his semen is invaluable because of it is also interesting. But actually showing trainers extracting Tilikum's milky business just felt all kinds of wrong. Imagine scratching a pink, fleshy tree branch while holding a giant Ziploc bag full of condensed milk at the end of it and you have a pretty good idea of what went down. It's practically bestiality territory and the point was made with what was said in interviews. Showing it to you will just make you want to take back to back showers while scrubbing your eyes with steel wool and dousing them with bleach.There's obviously something worth investigating when it comes to killer whale handling at SeaWorld and how they're handled in captivity. ""Blackfish"" reveals that humans are to blame for the way they've lashed out at water parks, which is more than likely true. While the documentary isn't exactly riveting, it is thought-provoking and leaves you with the urge to admire nature in its natural habitat rather than in a contained environment.",3,All hail

The entire industry, thus, is examined, as the same time. This is an industry that SeaWorld is on top of. This orca captivity industry makes SeaWorld's pockets ever so deep. The financial losses that this film is causing them are just now being realized by SeaWorld execs. What should they do? Firstly: stop lying. Secondly: stop lying some more. Thirdly: admit their wrongdoings. Then and only then may people consider forgiving them for their crimes against the world.SeaWorlds denies every single part of this documentary. They call the makers and supporters of Blackfish terrorists and low-lifes, but any educated person can see through such labels. Yes, SeaWorld is extremely pissed right now. They have every right to be: their darkest secrets they've been hiding for so long are now out in the open. Instead of admitting to their mistakes and poor treatment of orcas, they fight the facts and try everything they can to diminish this documentaries good name. But, what about SeaWorld's good name?

1657626,A2CDPGZXFR2C1K,B00DL47ORO,Dephtones,"[31, 34]","I watched this film knowing very little about the behind the scenes about whale capturing and exploitation of the whales for monetary gain. I kind of figured they weren't as comfortable as they were before they were captured and forced to live in tiny pools compared to a mega huge ocean. After watching this film, it cemented my opinion of never going to seaworld or any aquatic park that's similar to it.First of all these are killer whales. Killer being the keyword. Nobody said they're friendly or trainable to the extend that they won't harm anyone, which unfortunately was the case in this film. I'm not blaming the trainers for being attacked. I blame the company that set up the situation to make money off of these animals. The lies and excuses they give throughout the movie is mind numbing. The interviews the former trainers gave was informative and seemingly more truthful than the proponents of keeping killer whales captive. Of course seaworld wouldn't be a part of the film. When a company does this in a documentary, it tells me that they have stuff to hide, or possibly are in more legal trouble than letting on. If they're worried about editing, they can do what Dana White of the UFC does. He has his own camera and crew filming at the same time, since espn distorted an interview he had done previously, but I digress.I like animals. I don't love animals and I'm not a member of PETA or anything like that. I like nature, nature programs and seeing animals in their natural environment. There's something really wrong with having these huge whales in these small pools and it makes me feel sick to my stomach with the way the animals are treating each other since they're trapped. If they kill each other in the wild, it's different. It's because of territory or maybe another reason, who knows, but that's nature. When you put these multi-ton animals into a cage, it's like a wrestling match and the weakest gets hurt, as shown in the movie (I don't want to get into it too much as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the film). As we speak, sharks are eating seals, eagles are hitting goats off of mountains, and snakes are killing baby mice. It's nature and that's what they're programmed to do it. What they're not programmed to do is live in super small spaces like these whales. Most zoos are pretty good at giving animals enough space to roam and be themselves, with a couple of exceptions. I know not all zoos are 100% perfect, but I know people are keeping a close on them.Seaworld and other similar water attractions treat these animals like crap and expect them to play by the rules. a 200 pound trainer is no match for a 6 ton whale that has taken all that it's going to take, especially when you take away it's mate and children. I really wish there was a ban on these kinds of places. I know kids can like them, but it's because they don't understand and see what's really wrong here.

Many reviewers have already commented on the ways in which director Gabriela Cowperthwaite uses the documentary to comment on the ways in which Seaworld exploits the killer whales for financial gain, while claiming to treat them humanely.  What perhaps emerges most tangibly from her narrative is the limitations of human understanding surrounding these creatures; they are either perceived as friendly, cuddly creatures or as killer predators.  Little attempt has been made to try and construct alternative behavioral models that take into account the fact that killer whales are highly intelligent creatures who think and react in certain ways in the wild.  While the documentary includes several interviews with experts in whale behavior, it seems that they are lone voices: many of the former Seaworld trainers - who provide evidence of the ways in which captive whales were treated - come across as well-meaning yet basically ignorant.  They were perfectly content to parrot Seaworld's official propaganda to incredulous audiences, but spent little time or energy trying to discover things for themselves.  In that sense BLACKFISH comes across as a cautionary tale of how capitalism constructs false dreams that often prove so convincing that no one bothers to try and challenge them.  As a result, it is the killer whales that suffer.  The fact that such creatures strike back is seldom due to the fact that they are &#34;angry&#34; or &#34;resentful&#34; of their trainers, but rather borne out of frustration with a life in which they absolutely no power of self-determination.

I was hoping that the movie would be as riveting as the book, but it wasn't.  Maybe it was because the book was so good, and Blackfish didn't go into the same level of depth as the book (although I don't think it could have).  Maybe because you didn't hear from scientist Naomi Rose in Blackfish and she was such a vital part of the book.  Whatever the reason, Blackfish falls just a little but short, although I think that the movie and book complement each other nicely.The movie is striking in several ways:1. How it shows the small tank that the whales were kept in on 'off hours' (barely enough for them to turn around in)2. Its use of news footage combined with interviews to tell the story3. How it portrayed the devastating death of Dawn Brancheau, the trainer who most recently was killed by the killer whaleAfter seeing Blackfish, one wonders how all the trainers interviewed actually worked there, given what was happening.  Several of them seemed quite oblivious and took SeaWorld's word for what was going on with the whales, rather than investigating what was known about the whales as they lived in the wild.  It is gratifying to see how so many of them realized what was happening and left SeaWorld, but one also wonders how anyone could still work there given what we know about these amazing creatures.  It would seem that money and ignorance plays a large part in those trainers that still work at SeaWorld.The other interesting (and in some way unexplainable) thing about Blackfish is how little the family of Dawn Brancheau appears in the movie and how non-chalant they are, particularly at the end.  I believe it is her sister at the end who talks about how the family will be celebrating her life, etc, and she (or any other members of her family) say nothing against the organization that led to the death of Dawn.  Both my wife and I were astonished that we didn't hear more anger or disdain about what happened.  As far as we were concerned, SeaWorld should rename one of its parks after Dawn Brancheau.After watching Blackfish, and reading ""Death at SeaWorld"", you can only come to one conclusion - killer whales do not belong in any form of captivity whatsoever.  To continue to use and exploit these intelligent animals is tantamount to kidnapping and torture.  Unfortunately, and the movie alludes to this, money trumps morals in this instance, so because killer whales make money, they will probably always be showcased as they are.As for me, though, neither I nor my family will ever take part in one of the Shamu shows, and I hope that others follow suit.

Those were very fond memories of when my family was together and still getting along.  I enjoyed the whale and dolphin shows and I remember how I played with the dolphins between shows by playing with a volleyball that I threw back and forth.  Some years before, I went to Sea World in Mission Bay San Diego a couple of times and enjoyed it tremendously.I now begin to realize what truly kept these places in business.  Lies, deceit, abuse of animals, threats of termination to employees who wouldn't go along with the program and slick lawyers who kept the doors open and the money flowing.How do you deal with the death of the trainers?  Tell the press it was an accidental drowning.  Then pack on more lies and cover ups.  A couple of years afterwards, it was like it never happened.  And if any trainers or park personnel stepped out of line (or talked about it to the government or to the press) they were threatened with termination (possibly worse).As a result, they're able to spin themselves cleaner than Mother Theresa.Before you plan any vacation, see this documentary and have your kids see it, too.  You'll come to understand that when you patronize these sea parks, you are taking part in cold blooded murder.  Murder as in owners of these parks deferring blame to trainers (some of them dead, so they can't even defend themselves) or other bogus phenomena after an &#34;incident&#34; rather than the owners of Sea World (or similar places) taking whales away from their mothers, abusing them physically and penning them up for decades at a time.Hence, more pain and suffering to the whales and more trainers dying in horrific ways.With documentaries like these, we need to come to a profound understanding about our relationship with nature.  It is to be respected.  Whether it's our eliminating dependence on fossil fuels that causes global weather catastrophe, or showing basic respect to all intelligent life, whether it runs on the ground, or swims in the ocean.Otherwise, nature will take care of us.

What I remember, was that the exhibition tank, where Shamu performed with his trainers, appeared way too small.  At the time, and it still haunts me today, I put myself in Shamu's place, during the show, and tried to project the perfect size for that performance tank.  I thought to my self, and concluded, that the tank should be at least tree times larger.  When I studied the ratio of the other related tanks I concluded that the entire Shamu production was one-fifth the size it should be.  That was when I was about twelve years old in 1967.

VERY amusing that liberals, who's sole mission in life is the destruction of human nationality, race, and even sex, and who actively encourage the flooding of formerly white dominant countries with all sorts of human types, in their anthropomorphizing do the exact opposite thing to 'save the whale'.The whales should be free, of course.

The film interviews incident eyewitnesses, scientists and former SeaWorld trainers to build a seemingly compelling case that this is a gross, decades-long case of animal cruelty that ignores animal rights, human safety and puts profit and entertainment before common sense.This is a beautifully-shot documentary but my BS-detector started going into overdrive fairly quickly as it makes a series of faulty logic jumps that form the foundation of what is obviously more of a character assassination of SeaWorld than any real attempt to portray a balanced view. A supposed neuroscientist is presented early in the show who makes a slew of very unscientific statements along of the lines of 'finding parts of the animal's brain having emotions that human don't even have', which I'm pretty sure sit straight in the middle of the Venn diagram of unscientific and unprovable. Next up they find two eye-witnesses to an early trainer attack who are apparently are the only ones who can ID Tilicum in an orca lineup from 30 years ago, despite investigatory reports being unable to find the instigating orca. Then they accuse SeaWorld of starving the animals, deliberately using a known psychopathic orca, covering up video evidence and effectively running a complex &#34;tricks for food&#34; racket.Far from claiming to be an expert on SeaWorld's operations, I decided to ask a friend of mine who was a trainer at SeaWorld San Antonio for several years. Many of her comments aren't consistent with the portrayed attitude or approach of the water park in the movie, and then when I started digging around on the Internet I find some of the film's own participants expressing outrage at the way their interviews were presented. SeaWorld has a rebuttal site and there are a range of former trainer video on YouTube that are also worth viewing to see their reactions if you're interested in both sides of the story.Regardless of what you think about the captivity of killer whales - and I'm pretty sure that in 50 years they won't be held in tanks - the contents of this documentary are so one-sided to be ridiculous. As an emotional pull of the heart-strings utilizing clever editing and a carefully constructed narrative it's highly effective but putting aside the emotional elements it doesn't stand up to much scrutiny.

The film tries to be balanced, with spokespeople both for and against keeping orcas in captivity, but really serves as the brief for the prosecution. Aquarium owners steal young whales from their families, causing the left-behind moms painful grief. The whales are often kept in isolation and slowly driven mad with boredom in their tiny enclosures. Aquarium owners skimp on training the young people who tend to the whales, and feed them self-serving information to share with aquarium visitors. All very damning and sad.By the end of the film, the filmmaker's need to show aquarium owners as wholly evil (and that killer whales in the wild were always happy and free) gave me the sense that I was getting a pretty biased version of the story.

Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite sets her sights on SeaWorld with the main emphasis on dissecting the psychological impact that is endured by Orcas in extremely tumultuous circumstances.  Ultimately, the years of emotional and physical torment conspire to create incredibly dangerous and deadly outcomes for the trainers who routinely interact with them.  Beneath the awe-inspiring spectacle of exhilarating stunts and the inspirationally uplifting grandeur of crowd pleasing shows such as, &#8220;Believe&#8221; there is a dark and morbidly disturbing variable within this equation: virtually all whales in captivity are horribly traumatized and the trainers who work with them are playing a precarious game of Russian roulette that has the potential to turn fatal in the blink of an eye.&#8220;Blackfish&#8221; exposes the dark truth behind the illusion that is SeaWorld&#8217;s main attraction and the terrifying implications that human and animal interactions have when the show goes horribly wrong.  The defining message behind this film is that for all our expertise and abilities, man cannot attempt to tame goliath.

Usually when I watch a documentary it never really makes me want to follow its cause or to think more into the subject. But then there are those few mesmerizing ones that stick into my head. When I watched 'Blackfish' I was stunned and outright horrified really. It changed what I thought about the subject, it really did. The raw footage and excellent interviews really sparked my interest in the subject.'Blackfish' focuses on the consequences of keeping killer whales in captivity. In particular it focuses on the killer whale, Talikum, who killed three individuals while held in captivity.'Blackfish' features a ton of interviews from former trainers, who all gave us their opinions on the events of capturing killer whales and turning them into attractions. They helped alot with moving along the documentary, really telling the story actually.I liked the use of real footage of the events; it helped me get emotionally involved with this documentary, and really helped prove the trainer's points. Keeping killer whales in a habitat is not healthy, or safe for anybody, and it shows you can't be too careful either.This film uses real events and really explores them. I liked how the topic was truly dissected and explored. The creators of this documentary knew what they were doing, and really put there two cents into their opinions and what came out was a film that not only is entertaining, to say the least, but also informative. The film is compelling, shocking, and just attention grabbing.All in All, 'Blackfish' is a winner. The film explores the topic, and pushes its message so far that you think you're going to collapse, but you don't because what you're watching is real footage, and with the help of the real trainer's narrating the film, it really makes you think about the topic, in a powerful way.

A lot of the information seemed dated and I wondered, in light of the events documented, has Sea World changed their operations other than not allowing trainers to perform in water with the Orcas. And was it primarily only Titicum who was aggressive and hurt people. I liked that this issue is being brought to light and attention. I saw the follow up commentary by another former, but supposedly more recently employed, trainer. His commentary brought up some of the issues that I also wondered about, but actually added little information or clarification. His comments that Sea World is providing the best environment possible for the Orcas is vague. I can identify with his statements that several of these animals have been born and lived their lives in captivity. In that instance, it would be irresponsible to turn them back to the wild. But his justification that they would be endangered by allowing them into larger open sea pools is lame. Their pools and diets etc could slowly be changed over to sea water environment and then allow them into sea pools to allow their systems to acclimate. They are not the same as research animal populations(such as mice, rats) that are developed with specific criteria and in an entirely controlled environment. Those animals WOULD die if let out of their respective environments because their immune systems, digestive systems, etc have been conditioned and/or out right altered such that such a change would overwhelm their ability to develop resistance and accomadation to the new circumstance and exposure to new organisms.

(I agree)&#8230; HOWEVER, later in the &#8220;documentary&#8221;, he is used for breeding, and this statement is made &#34;How could Sea World breed an Orca who is genetically aggressive&#8221;. HUHHH?? Are you kidding me? What a bunch of rot! As proof of his &#8220;danger&#8221;, someone snuck into the park and was killed by Tilacom during the night. This docu-dummary goes on to say &#34;How could they keep such a dangerous animal in the park?&#8221; Huhhhh&#8230; Are you kidding me?? A meathead sneaks in and goes for a swim with a killer whale, and this is Sea World&#8217;s fault?? We are told by an &#34;expert&#34; that Tilacom &#34;stripped the man naked and ate his genitals&#34;. I'm sure there is NO possibility that he stripped down by himself. Even the best trainers are NEVER to be in contact without a spotter nearby. We are further lead to believe that the trainers aren&#8217;t told of the risks involved and that the Orca Show should never happen because people can and do get killed. Huhhh&#8230; Are you kidding me??? Well then, let&#8217;s outlaw any activity where someone may be killed. Does anyone really believe the trainers don&#8217;t know of the risk? This movie has some very good points, especially the first 35-40 minutes.We see true atrocities in the capture of baby Orcas and the small poor facilities at &#8220;Sea Land&#8221;- clearly abusive. It then becomes a pure mess of a presentation- it is highly manipulative&#8230; It is a great film to study the effective use of partial truth in propaganda. Here's the formula- 1.Begin with unbiased INFORMATION and comments that are reasonable and informative 2. Gradually, throw in OPINIONS from the aforementioned &#34;reasonable&#34; witnesses. 3. Finally, cue the dark musical score, and present misinformation and bias based upon one-sided reports. Whatever you do, don't present any facts or testimonies from those who disagree with your propaganda. ...Believe it or not, I am conflicted over the Sea World Orca shows. I'm not a &#34;Catch Willy and Make Him Do Ticks&#34; fan; however, I want to hear the whole unbiased story.

Please remember that we all have the right to have an opinion and I am not trying to make any one change their minds or believe the way I do.First, the movie is very one sided.  Having said that, it is important to see what is happening and even the one sided approach can spark conversations that will lead to much needed changes.Second, Sea World had an opportunity to comment.  They declined.  That speaks volumes to me and leads me to believe they may have been less than honest. I would have liked to have heard their &#34;side.&#34;That being said, you cannot completely discount the accounts of the persons who were actually involved with these particular animals.I believe it is a sincere and horrible tragedy that these animals have been captured at all, ever.I think this movie is worth a viewing and a conversation.  I gave it 5 stars for the POSSIBILITY that it could have a positive impact on how we see this magnficent animals.  Orcas, also known as &#34;killer whales&#34; are actually dolphins.  And to date, there has never been a recorded &#34;attack&#34; on humans in the wild.  I think this important to note. In fact, the just the opposite as with smaller species of dolphins. And they have unique &#34;personalities&#34;... not unlike humans. I am fortunate enough to live in Oregon and not far from where we hosted Keiko (Free Willy) for some time as they attempted to &#34;rehabilitate&#34; Keiko enough to release him.  Sadly, that ended tragically. And in Keiko's case, I wish they had never released him.  Clearly he was very deeply imprinted on humans and sought out gentle contact with them even after his release. I believe that while Tilikum and Keiko were both orcas, they are were clearly different in temperament. I don't think you can discount temperament either.  Sadly Tilikum has proven that he has the capcity to harm and the willingness to do so. Further,  I was shocked to hear that the &#34;trainers&#34; at Sea World are NOT trained or educated at all.  You can walk off the street and apply to be a &#34;trainer.&#34;  If you can swim, have an appealing personality and physical appearance, you're in.  No real education, no real training, not even a high school diploma.  Disappointing.  However, to me that puts more of the burden of responsibility squarely on Sea World for the safety of their &#34;trainers.&#34;I hope that if you chose to watch this movie that you do so with an open mind and heart.  It's NOT a perfect movie.  I wish there had been more information from the &#34;other&#34; side, however, the film still has value in my opinion.",5,Worth the conversation,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,2662,"['Wow', 'are', 'lot', 'really', 'intense', 'reviews', 'movie', 'Please', 'remember', 'have', 'right', 'have', 'opinion', 'am', 'not', 'trying', 'make', 'one', 'change', 'minds', 'believe', 'way', 'do.First', 'movie', 'very', 'one', 'sided', 'Having', 'said', 'important', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'even', 'one', 'sided', 'approach', 'can', 'spark', 'conversations', 'will', 'lead', 'much', 'needed', 'changes.Second', 'Sea', 'World', 'had', 'opportunity', 'comment', 'declined', 'volumes', 'believe', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'honest', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', '34', 'side.', '34', 'being', 'said', 'can', 'not', 'completely', 'discount', 'accounts', 'persons', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'involved', 'particular', 'animals.I', 'believe', 'sincere', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'animals', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'ever.I', 'think', 'movie', 'viewing', 'conversation', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'POSSIBILITY', 'could', 'have', 'positive', 'impact', 'how', 'see', 'magnficent', 'animals', 'Orcas', 'also', 'known', '34', 'killer', '34', 'are', 'actually', 'dolphins', 'date', 'never', 'been', 'recorded', '34', 'attack', '34', 'humans', 'wild', 'think', 'important', 'note', 'fact', 'just', 'opposite', 'smaller', 'species', 'dolphins', 'have', 'unique', '34', 'personalities', '34', 'not', 'humans', 'am', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'live', 'Oregon', 'not', 'far', 'where', 'hosted', 'Keiko', 'Free', 'Willy', 'time', 'attempted', '34', 'rehabilitate', '34', 'Keiko', 'enough', 'release', 'Sadly', 'ended', 'tragically', 'Keiko', 'case', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'released', 'Clearly', 'was', 'very', 'deeply', 'imprinted', 'humans', 'sought', 'out', 'gentle', 'contact', 'even', 'release', 'believe', 'Tilikum', 'Keiko', 'were', 'orcas', 'are', 'were', 'clearly', 'different', 'temperament', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'discount', 'temperament', 'either', 'Sadly', 'Tilikum', 'proven', 'capcity', 'harm', 'willingness', 'do', 'so', 'Further', 'was', 'shocked', 'hear', '34', 'trainers', '34', 'Sea', 'World', 'are', 'NOT', 'trained', 'educated', 'can', 'walk', 'street', 'apply', 'be', '34', 'trainer.', '34', 'can', 'swim', 'have', 'appealing', 'personality', 'physical', 'appearance', ""'re"", 'real', 'education', 'real', 'training', 'not', 'even', 'high', 'school', 'diploma', 'Disappointing', 'However', 'more', 'burden', 'responsibility', 'squarely', 'Sea', 'World', 'safety', '34', 'trainers.', '34', 'hope', 'chose', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', 'so', 'open', 'mind', 'heart', 'NOT', 'perfect', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'information', '34', 'other', '34', 'side', 'however', 'film', 'still', 'value', 'opinion']",N/A

The film looked mesmerizing, an in-depth look into something very few people had probably ever thought about.  I vaguely remember back in 2010, when SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed, but I recall the news reports all saying it was &#8216;trainer error&#8217;.  BLACKFISH unveils the truth about what really happened and then throws the curtains aside to expose the psychological damage that is done to killer whales in captivity.I have to confess that I&#8217;m not a tree-hugger or animal rights activist, although I do believe we should take care of the earth and treat animals appropriately.  But when I finished watching BLACKFISH, I sat for a while and thought about what I should tell my kids about SeaWorld.  They are wanting to go, but now I&#8217;m not so sure I want to take them.This compelling self-argument is the very reason every person reading this review should pick up a copy of BLACKFISH and watch it.  The film is not a preachy PETA promotional video or anything of the sort; it is a vivid and candid look at orcas, the treatment they receive in captivity (from both people and other killer whales), and the mental damage that is done to them by plucking them from the wild.The film is shot well and presents the information in a no-nonsense yet nonjudgmental fashion.  Several former SeaWorld trainers are interviewed and give their testimonies, along with an OSHA investigator that worked on the SeaWorld court case and many other people involved with the industry.  The result is a moving and powerful piece that will make you think.BLACKFISH is an amazing film and I highly recommend giving it a look.

That trainer was Dawn Brancheau, an experienced trainer of orcas. The whale in question was the orca ""Tilikum"", who was captured as a child in Icelandic waters in 1983. ""Blackfish"" is the result of an effort by director Gabriela Cowperthwaite to understand exactly what happened and why on that day in 2010. She interviews former Sea World trainers who knew Tilikum and his victim, former trainers who knew him from his previous stay at Sealand of the Pacific in Canada, whale researchers, and gets ahold of a lot of video footage of violent behavior by orcas toward their trainers at various marine parks.At only 1 hour and 20 minutes long, ""Blackfish"" is straightforward and packed with information and interesting stories. Unfortunately, management at Sea World declined to be interviewed for the film, which might have given it a counterpoint. But former trainers Jeffrey Ventre, John Hargrove, Samantha Berg, Carol Ray, Mark Simmons, Kim Ashdown, Dean Gomersall, and John Jett talk about their time at Sea World, their enthusiasm for the jobs they obviously loved, and their initial ignorance about orcas in captivity, including the incidence of violent attacks on trainers, which they claim Sea World tended to misrepresent. Whale researcher Howard Garrett provides some insight into orcas in the wild, and specialist Dave Duffus discusses cases of orcas attacking trainers.One of the most compelling interviews is early on, as John Crowe recounts his experience 39 years earlier in capturing young orcas at sea, a horrific recollection that announces the film's theme. ""Blackfish"" is steadfastly against keeping orcas in captivity. The former trainers became very disillusioned at Sea World, they became more educated, and some now advocate to move captive orcas to sea pens, where their needs could be better met. It would have been nice to hear Sea World respond to specific accusations, but there doesn't seem to be much room for argument, because marine parks cannot meet orcas' most basic needs. These are creatures up to 6 tons in size, living decades in small tanks, developing health problems that they would not normally have, without even the ability to communicate normally with their fellow captives.The DVD (Magnolia 2013): Bonus features include 7 short interviews, a trailer (2  min), and an audio commentary by director Gabriela  Cowperthwaite and producer Manny Oteyza. In ""Kanduke"" (2 min), former trainer Dean Gomersall talks about the death of a whale from mosquito-borne encephalitis. ""Death by Mosquito"" (3 min) interviews former trainer John Jett, who wrote a doctoral dissertation on mosquito-borne encephalitis in captive orcas. In ""Orca Teeth Show the Stress of Orcas in Captivity"" (3 min), former trainer Jeffrey Ventre, now an MD, discusses the dental problems suffered by captive orcas and whale mortality. In ""Recollections of a Former Sea World Trainer"" (5 min), John Hargrove recounts a situation in which he was helped by an orca when injured. ""The Truth About Wild Whales"" (5 min) interviews Dr. Naomi Rose, PhD about how orcas fare in captivity. In ""Alternatives to Captivity"" (2 min), Dr. Rose talks about an orca named Lolita whom she hopes will be retired to a sea pen. ""A Note from Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite"" (8 min) interviews the director about how she became interested in orcas and how the focus of the film changed to an activist film once she began making it.

She began an investigation surrounding the death of one of Sea World Orlando's veteran trainers, Dawn Brancheau.  Brancheau was killed by a crazed orca called Tilikum in 2011, but the details were sketchy and allusive.  As Cowperthwaite initiated contact with Sea World officials, she was continually put off.  As a result, there is no official rebuttal to the facts raised in the documentary.There was also a lawsuit against Sea World initiated by the federal government (OSHA) regarding employee safety being compromised.  The film features interviews with numerous former whale trainers at Sea World as well as those from a Canadian park where Tilikum was originally housed.  There is additional footage, some archival but mostly civilian home movies.  Tilikum had a history of endangering trainers beginning in Canada.Rather than demonizing Tilikum or other whales, the film suggest/insists the behavior should not be a surprise given the conditions in which the animals live.

Done so well that the documentary format actually unfolds like a thriller, you cant wait to find out what happens next, or how it ends. What you will learn, the animals are not as &#34;happy to perform&#34; as Seaworld would lead you to believe, the whales were originally captured to perform in still to this day too small spaces to live, there are more accidents that happened then they want people to find out about, the animals are separated from parents out of convenience to corporations need for animals to be at specific facilities-causing mental/emotional as well as physical damage to animal.  Many animals damage each other and have gone after trainers out of frustration from being in small spaces with little to do most of the time. Its an unnatural state for  highly intelligent creatures meant to have miles and miles space to conduct themselves and communicate in. You will also see how indoctrinated the trainers are into believing the animals are happy & healthy, and how compassionate they are towards the animals  when they finally see the truth of it. Its a very interesting topic I knew little of but suspected something was wrong about training animals for our entertainment.  I hope more people will vote with their dollars by not support this kind of entertainment and it will just go away.

Oceans were created with the orcas not without. Blackfish will awaken humans since if there is only one thing wrong with this planet is the equation of the human-kind behavior toward other form of life.

1657696,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00DL47ORO,Paul Allaer,"[28, 30]","""Blackfish"" (2013 release; 85 min.) takes a critical look at killer whales being kept in captivity, and the devastating effects on the orcas AND their trainers. The movie opens with the news in 2010 that veteran orca trainer Dawn Brancheau has been killed at an incident at the SeaWorld water amusement park in Orlando (we don't see any footage of it). From there the documentary goes on to show the beginnings of orca whaling to bring them into those water amusement parks. In the early 90s a young but rapidly growing orca named Tilikum is involved in ""an incident"" at a small park in Victoria, BC, after which the owner decides to shut down the park, and Tilikum is bought by SeaWorld in Orlando. I won't tell you how it all connects to the tragic death of Brancheau, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a shocking and yet riveting documentary, one of the likes you don't get to see very often. Second, the movie interviews a bunch of former SeaWorld orca trainers who, with years of wisdom, now decry the multi-million dollar industry that has become these water amusement parks with killer whales putting on a ""show"". Their point of view is clear. Third, there are no reposts from anyone at SeaWorld in the movie (in the end credits, we are told that ""SeaWorld did not respond to multiple requests for an interview"". Last, but certainly not least, towards the end of the movie, we are shown a number of graphic videos of ""when orcas go wild"" and viewer beware, they are not for the faint of heart, but at the same time, they bring home the point that keeping these killer whales in captivity is just wrong, and can lead to disastrous results.This documentary made a huge splash (pardon the punt) at the Sundance film festival earlier this year. It just opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and the showing tonight where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to say. This movie proves once again that ""facts are stronger than fiction"", reason why I love well-made documentaries like this one so much. Bottom line: this is a shocking and revolting documentary that is simply a must see.

1657697,AG0UP5II9OSP2,B00DL47ORO,"Paul A. Wunderlich ""Tread softly...""","[95, 107]","The documentary takes you back to the 1980,s and the beginning o the Orca's demise. It has various interviews and first person narratives of how orcas actually have displayed aggressive behavior within the confined pools in SeaWorld and other places, like Loro Parque in Tenerife, Spain. There is some bloodshed in the movie, so I would advise caution if you plan on taking your kids. This piece is similar to another movie about similar cetacean, The Cove; in both movies you get pieces of a truth well hidden by those with a fat pocket, unwilling to let go the reins of a multi-billionaire industry. It's just sad.My opinion:Be prepared to view heartbreaking footage. To pillage another being's young, to dislpay it in front of millions of viewers and lie to the public in order to conceal the animals' frustration--leading to fatal, aggressive behavior--is immoral. It's obvious to you as a viewer how much these animals suffer when they are being taken from their pods by looking at the trainer's reaction to the animal's captivity. The saddest part of the movie for me was Tilikum's abduction. An orca's wailing after its young has been taken from its side is heartbreaking.So think about it for one second. You're taken from your parents when you are four years old, stuck in a tank made of concrete, and forced to hang out with strangers from a diversity of cultures you would probably hate (each pod of orcas is so different that it's like comparing  the Homo sapiens, a single species, with thousands of different religions) --this is the road to insanity.It's not only about freeing Tilikum; it's also about stopping the massive hunting of whales and other highly intelligent beings, like dolphins. Cetaceans are having a hard time nowadays.

1657698,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00DL47ORO,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[5, 5]","Nine Things about Blackfish1. Don&#8217;t be fooled by the oddly bland title, or the fact that you may not have heard of this film. This is a stunning and heart wrenching documentary - perhaps the best of the year.2. In 2010, SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed by a whale at the park. The official news story was that Dawn made a mistake by letting her ponytail hang out, and the whale grabbed it and she got pulled under.  Filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite thought the story sounded suspicious, so she started digging around. The result was this film.3. While the death of Brancheau is the hook of &#8220;Blackfish&#8221;, that topic isn&#8217;t really dealt with until the end. The movie is much deeper and more comprehensive than that. It&#8217;s a compilation of interviews, court testimony, SeaWorld commercials, and home video over several decades.4. It documents 30 years of SeaWorld&#8217;s actions, including accounts of how they capture, treat, and train the orcas, especially one particular killer whale, Tilikum.5. By contrasting SeaWorld&#8217;s public image with what really was going on behind the scenes, this movie reaches far beyond one sad incident and becomes a blistering indictment of SeaWorld itself.6. SeaWorld is understandably upset at this film, and released a statement saying, in part, &#8220;Blackfish is billed as a documentary, but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject, the film is inaccurate and misleading... to promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting, the film paints a distorted picture&#8230;&#8221;7. Interestingly, the filmmakers repeatedly asked SeaWorld to be interviewed for &#8220;Blackfish&#8221;, and SeaWorld repeatedly declined, only releasing that statement after the film came out. That was probably smart on SeaWorld&#8217;s part. I don&#8217;t see any way they could successfully defend themselves here.8. Pixar studios is currently working on &#8220;Finding Dory&#8221;, a sequel to &#8220;Finding Nemo&#8221;. When the director of that movie saw &#8220;Blackfish&#8221;, he rewrote parts of the film, including the ending.9. If enough people see this movie, it may be able to single-handedly take down SeaWorld.",5,One of the best documentaries of 2013,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,2241,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Blackfish1', 'Don', '8217', 'be', 'fooled', 'oddly', 'bland', 'title', 'fact', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'stunning', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'documentary', 'perhaps', 'best', 'year.2', '2010', 'SeaWorld', 'trainer', 'Dawn', 'Brancheau', 'was', 'killed', 'whale', 'park', 'official', 'news', 'story', 'was', 'Dawn', 'made', 'mistake', 'letting', 'ponytail', 'hang', 'whale', 'grabbed', 'got', 'pulled', 'Filmmaker', 'Gabriela', 'Cowperthwaite', 'thought', 'story', 'sounded', 'suspicious', 'started', 'digging', 'around', 'result', 'was', 'film.3', 'death', 'Brancheau', 'hook', '8220', 'Blackfish', '8221', 'topic', 'isn', '8217', 'really', 'dealt', 'end', 'movie', 'much', 'deeper', 'more', 'comprehensive', '8217', 's', 'compilation', 'interviews', 'court', 'testimony', 'SeaWorld', 'commercials', 'home', 'video', 'several', 'decades.4', 'documents', '30', 'years', 'SeaWorld', '8217', 's', 'actions', 'including', 'accounts', 'how', 'capture', 'treat', 'train', 'orcas', 'especially', 'one', 'particular', 'killer', 'whale', 'Tilikum.5', 'contrasting', 'SeaWorld', '8217', 'public', 'image', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'going', 'scenes', 'movie', 'far', 'one', 'sad', 'incident', 'blistering', 'indictment', 'SeaWorld', 'itself.6', 'SeaWorld', 'understandably', 'upset', 'film', 'released', 'statement', 'saying', 'part', '8220', 'Blackfish', 'billed', 'documentary', 'instead', 'fair', 'balanced', 'treatment', 'complex', 'subject', 'film', 'inaccurate', 'misleading', 'promote', 'bias', 'killer', 'whales', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'maintained', 'zoological', 'setting', 'film', 'distorted', 'picture', '8230', '8221', '7', 'Interestingly', 'filmmakers', 'repeatedly', 'asked', 'SeaWorld', 'be', 'interviewed', '8220', 'Blackfish', '8221', 'SeaWorld', 'repeatedly', 'declined', 'only', 'releasing', 'statement', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'probably', 'smart', 'SeaWorld', '8217', 's', 'part', 'don', '8217', 'see', 'way', 'could', 'successfully', 'defend', 'Pixar', 'studios', 'currently', 'working', '8220', 'Finding', 'Dory', '8221', 'sequel', '8220', 'Finding', 'Nemo', '8221', 'When', 'director', 'movie', 'saw', '8220', 'Blackfish', '8221', 'parts', 'film', 'including', 'ending.9', 'enough', 'people', 'see', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'single-handedly', 'take', 'down', 'SeaWorld']",N/A

I believe whales born in captivity could display aggressive behaviors. Obviously those who work with whales can easily go to a library or rent a dvd that talks about whales to figure out that it is not the safest. But diving is not safe, neither is bungee jumping. Pups are separated from their moms for dogs and cats, yet we don't necessarily condemn it. Having visited the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, which is a research organization, and they have great programs that recover animals and release some in the wild and some are kept in display. Not every animal is able to return to the wild. Not showing this complexity nor any qualities about SeaWorld just makes this a propaganda. it is unfortunate. I thought it would be more along the lines of The Cove, where a broader set of people were heard about the topic. After watching the whales with their trainers in the movie, it made me understand that killer whales do not necessarily kill anyone. If over 30 years, a couple of people were dead, we could try to understand better what went on...

1657703,A159U1WJOR4UIK,B00DL47ORO,Reviewer,"[2, 3]","The film Blackfish delivers a compelling and thought provoking display, revealing a darker depth of Seaworld to the general public who view the film. A good amount of people can admit to having memories of going to Seaworld at one point in time, either with their parents or their children. The movie reveals the shadowy truth of captivity, lingering out of sight, beneath the veneer of family entertainment and Seaword propaganda. It fist highlights this detail in the very beginning of the film by juxtaposing a recorded 911 emergency call, a call given for the death of a senior trainer at the hands of a whale, with scenes of a sea world public act and a commercial. The juxtaposition serves to underscore the grim divide between reality and sugarcoated fiction created by propaganda and public perception. From the greatest details such as the deaths and incidents of injury to the smallest, with the bottom half of the K in Blackfish shaped like a dorsal fin, the film is a superb example of a documentary film making. The bulk of the films testimonials come from former Seaworld trainers, while their recordings, photos, video clippings and diagrams are mostly from public record. The film and special features cover a host of issues created due to orca captivity. Issues from psychological trauma, encephalitis caused by mosquito bites and a significant decline in the quality of life the orcas experience. It covers many other issues as well, but the overall bottom line is the detrimental effects of keeping orcas confined to a liquid cage over time leads to a constant state of torture. The argument of the film boils down to a single fact, orcas are intelligent beings capable of complex emotions and social groups. As a film it is excellent, as a social statement about the injustice of captivity of intelligent animals it is equally excellent. As an avid film watcher and a fan of documentaries, I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in seeing the other side of Seaworld or curious to add a new documentary film to their collection.

Knowlton,"[2, 2]","Blackfish is not a pure documentary in the strictest sense--a movie in which the producer endeavors to evenly display information from both sides of the argument.  Rather, Blackfish should be considered an advocacy documentary.  The producer is most certainly using facts and opinions to advocate for one side of the argument and to advocate for action.  There is only about 1 minute of film where a proponent of Sea World provides an antagonistic viewpoint to the producer's theory.  The rest of the video is designed to express, convincingly so, that imprisoning killer whales is animal cruelty and often results in aggressive behavior.I think it's a good documentary and worth watching a couple times.  When I was young, I though Sea World was a terrific place where captive animals were well cared for and where humans could be educated about the plight of sea mammals.  I also believed that exposing humans to sea life in such close quarters would raise awareness and make humans more sensitive to appropriate ocean conservation efforts.  It accomplishes those things, but at what cost?  Do the ends justify the means?  Is a ""little bit"" of animal cruelty acceptable if it brings in money and raises awareness?As I grew older and attended more Sea World venues, I began to recognize that these animals did not reside in captivity voluntarily and that restricting animals to little concrete swimming pools or metal cages was unnatural.  Comparing animal behavior in the wild with animal behavior in captivity solidified this understanding for me.  I no longer frequent zoos or places like Sea World because of this realization.  We humans are smart:  We can certainly come up with a way of appreciating and learning about animals without keeping them as prisoners in cages.Blackfish is worth the watch.

1657706,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00DL47ORO,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Blackfish (Gabriela Cowperthwaite, 2013)It will be no surprise to anyone who has seen Blackfish, the terrifying, heartbreaking documentary about Tilikum, the psychotic orca, that Sea World have been cranking out anti-Blackfish spin since the movie opened. The film, Sea World (who were offered that chance repeatedly, a title card at the end tells us, to go on camera and offer an alternate version of the story, but always declined) reports, is &#8220;inaccurate and biased&#8221; [...]. Funny how they say that now rather than having tried to set the record straight on level ground. I don't know about you, but watching Sea World attempt to defend their actions after the documentary was released looks a lot like those authors who go and attack reviews on Amazon and end up getting lampooned around the Internet [...]. None of which, of course, has to do with Blackfish itself, saving adding some amusing meta when you're watching the thing.The film traces the life in captivity of Tilikum, an orca who was captured in the late eighties for Sealand, a small park in British Columbia, and wasn't right from the start; while the movie starts off highlighting the big story that started it all (Tilikum killed Sea World senior trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010), we find out that's not the first time he'd killed a person. And after the first death, which happened there, Sea World bought him. Under the condition, one interviewee notes, that he never be used in performances again; he was supposed to be a breeding whale and that was it. Sea World had other ideas.While the movie does focus on Tilikum, as it should, it does branch out to advance the hypothesis, and back it up with at least enough evidence to suggest a lot more research is necessary, that keeping orcas in captivity, at least the way Sea World does it, may be at the root of Tilikum's problems; they touch on the family structure of the orca, though they don't go into great detail (and one of the movie's lasting side effects, as far as I'm concerned, should be a burning desire in all who see it to find out a lot more about the social lives of orcas, which one scientist hypothesizes are more advanced than the social lives of any other creature on the planet). They do give us enough to make us understand that Sea World's policy of separating family groups and frequently moving the animals from park to park is probably a good deal of what's to blame not only for Tilikum's problems, but the problems of many captive orcas. (I obviously can't say from Sea World's perspective, but when I worked in retail management in the early nineties, the company I worked for&#8212;now defunct, and its parent company has been on the rocks for about a decade now&#8212;treated managers the same way Sea World treats orcas. Their rationalization was that they believed store managers should not stay in one place too long so that they did not build up histories with customers. As I said, I don't know if that's Sea World's rationale, but that's what I was thinking of during that part of the movie.) It's chilling stuff.Not to say this is a perfect film. It is nakedly manipulative, and the filmmakers obviously cherry-picked interviews and pieces of interviews. There are also some bits that seemed, well, gratuitous. (You already told us Tilikum was bought as a breeding animal, did you have to show us the scene of two trainers, um, &#8220;harvesting&#8221; his sperm? Really?) But it pulls no punches, it is thought-provoking, it at least attempts to present both sides of the story (and attempted to go farther in that regard, but Sea World would not cooperate), and it asks even more questions than it says it's going to ask. All of these things are hallmarks of a well-made and worth-watching documentary.

Schultz,"[1, 2]","This is an eye-opening, saddening account of the plight of orcas kept in captivity primarily to serve as circus-like performers in various marine worlds. These creatures are made to suffer merely to supply us with casual entertainment.This documentary does a good job of waking us up to the pointless cruelty we&#8217;re inflicting, and the waste of life entailed. Some of the commentators on the film are former marine world trainers who quit their jobs in order to be free to speak out publicly against the abuses they now regret being party to.However, the film could have been even better. It&#8217;s a little disjointed, recounting cases here/there, then/now, in which both humans and orcas have been injured or killed as a result of the animals&#8217; unnatural confinement.Then it misses a few chances to give viewers further insights into the nature of these &#8220;black fish.&#8221; The writers could have included some more of the kinds of details that I learned when I went whale-watching off the coast of Vancouver. For example, this documentary doesn&#8217;t explain that orcas aren&#8217;t really &#8220;whales&#8221; at all &#8211; killer or otherwise. They are actually dolphins whose current name might have been an early transposition of the term &#8220;whale killer.&#8221;Also, this documentary states that orcas have never been known to kill humans in the wild. According to the whale-watching boat captains, that&#8217;s true &#8211; but not for this documentary&#8217;s implied reason that orcas might find some intellectual sympathy with humans and recognize us as kindred spirits. Rather the boating captains believed there were no attacks in the wild because humans are simply viewed as being relatively bony slim pickings for the orcas when they have larger prey available. The whale-watching crew said that one of a wild orca&#8217;s favorite repasts would be a moose.This conjured an eerie picture in my mind. I imagined an orca slithering out of its natural watery medium, through the Canadian forests at night, sneaking up on unsuspecting ungulates. How could that happen? But no, the crew member explained that moose like to swim between the many islands off the coasts of Vancouver and Seattle &#8211; and the orcas pick them off then.Despite the fact that &#8220;Black Fish&#8221; could have included more such choice details and been a little better organized, it remains a brave and awakening must-see documentary.",4,"Eye-Opening, But Could Have told More",1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,2451,"['eye-opening', 'saddening', 'account', 'plight', 'orcas', 'kept', 'captivity', 'primarily', 'serve', 'circus-like', 'performers', 'various', 'marine', 'worlds', 'creatures', 'are', 'made', 'suffer', 'merely', 'supply', 'casual', 'entertainment.This', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'waking', 'pointless', 'cruelty', '8217', 're', 'inflicting', 'waste', 'life', 'entailed', 'commentators', 'film', 'are', 'former', 'marine', 'world', 'trainers', 'who', 'quit', 'jobs', 'order', 'be', 'free', 'speak', 'out', 'publicly', 'abuses', 'now', 'regret', 'being', 'party', 'to.However', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', '8217', 's', 'little', 'disjointed', 'recounting', 'cases', 'here/there', 'then/now', 'humans', 'orcas', 'have', 'been', 'injured', 'killed', 'result', 'animals', '8217', 'unnatural', 'confinement.Then', 'few', 'chances', 'give', 'viewers', 'further', 'insights', 'nature', '8220', 'black', 'fish.', '8221', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'kinds', 'details', 'learned', 'when', 'went', 'whale-watching', 'coast', 'Vancouver', 'example', 'documentary', 'doesn', '8217', 'explain', 'orcas', 'aren', '8217', 'really', '8220', 'whales', '8221', '8211', 'otherwise', 'are', 'actually', 'dolphins', 'current', 'name', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'early', 'transposition', 'term', '8220', 'killer.', '8221', 'Also', 'documentary', 'states', 'orcas', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'known', 'kill', 'humans', 'wild', 'According', 'whale-watching', 'boat', 'captains', '8217', 'true', '8211', 'not', 'documentary', '8217', 'implied', 'reason', 'orcas', 'might', 'find', 'intellectual', 'sympathy', 'humans', 'recognize', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'boating', 'believed', 'were', 'attacks', 'wild', 'humans', 'are', 'simply', 'viewed', 'being', 'relatively', 'bony', 'slim', 'pickings', 'orcas', 'when', 'have', 'larger', 'prey', 'available', 'whale-watching', 'crew', 'said', 'one', 'wild', 'orca', '8217', 'favorite', 'repasts', 'would', 'be', 'moose.This', 'conjured', 'eerie', 'picture', 'mind', 'imagined', 'orca', 'slithering', 'natural', 'watery', 'medium', 'Canadian', 'forests', 'night', 'sneaking', 'up', 'unsuspecting', 'ungulates', 'How', 'could', 'happen', 'crew', 'member', 'explained', 'moose', 'swim', 'many', 'islands', 'coasts', 'Vancouver', 'Seattle', '8211', 'orcas', 'pick', 'off', 'then.Despite', 'fact', '8220', 'Black', 'Fish', '8221', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'such', 'choice', 'details', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'organized', 'brave', 'awakening', 'must-see', 'documentary']",N/A

AndWhale Warsdemonstrates the commitment of some people toward protecting the ocean's whales.Blackfish is about two things.

Whose fault is this... Tilikum, SeaWorld, the people who captured Tilikum originally, or the public who demands performing animals?The second story is about the ethics of manipulating large wild animals to become amusing novelties.  On the one hand, exposing people to magnificent animals like orcas can promote a passionate attitude toward their conservation.  After all, how many of us get to spend time with orcas in the Antarctic or in Puget Sound?

Still, there are heartbreaking accounts of young Orcas taken from their mothers and the resulting depressed cries from the mothers once the separation has occurred.  There are also many accounts from former trainers about the lack of actual training they receive and, in several cases, accurate information they are given about the animals. I think the trainers very much love these animals and do want to make the lives of these animals better, but they aren't fully informed when they hire on.

1657724,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00DL47ORO,Terry Mesnard,"[8, 31]","Blackfish mostly follows the story of Tilikum, an orca captured in the 80s when he was a mere pup, and his rise to fame and infamy within Sealand of the Pacific and, eventually, SeaWorld.  Known to be involved in the deaths of three trainers, Tilikum's story is tragic both for the whale and also for the trainers, some of whom did not truly know the dangers of working with him.  Thrown into this mix are some anecdotal stories about other killer whales, the number of ""accidents"" involving killer whales and trainers and, for some random reason, a whale's sexual organ on display.  I know Blackfish has received a lot of positive press and reviews, but honestly it left me feeling pretty nonchalant.  Not about the travesty that happens to these whales or the tragedy befalling the trainers.  That obviously hit home.  But the documentary seemed all over the place and wasn't really put together very well to make a cohesive whole.  Random parts of the film seem pulled directly from YouTube, and just when it seems like it's making a point, it veers off into randomness; for example, for no real reason we go from the tragedies happening to seeing a pod of whales in the ocean attacking a sea lion.  I didn't really see how this added much to the main thrust of the story, other than to pad the already slim running time.  Additionally, while they tried to make a point of showing how the aggressive Tilikum is used to breed for most of the whales in captivity, I don't see why they had to focus on his, er, erupting member.  I now know that it looks like a tentacle.  So, you know.  I learned something.My biggest problem with the documentary is that I left not really knowing more than when I went in (erupting member, aside).  The other problem is that it feels cloyingly attached to appeal to our emotions.  How anyone could watch the footage of a whale calling out to her young that's been ripped from her and not feel pathos is beyond me.  And that's exactly what the documentarians are counting on.  It sometimes feels manipulative.  But I say this not as someone who's on the side of SeaWorld, but as someone who definitely agrees that these beautiful creatures should be able to roam free and not be forced to do ridiculous tricks.  I just don't like to feel like I'm being manipulated.At one point, the documentary tells the viewer that SeaWorld was asked repeatedly for interviews for Blackfish, but they were (here's a shocker) turned down.  Obviously, SeaWorld knows that the documentary is about lambasting them, so why would they submit to it?  Yet, it's played off as if the directors are trying to be fair and balanced; Fox News follows a similar tactic.  Look, Blackfish is a one-sided documentary, telling its viewers things they probably already know: animals in captivity = bad; animals in captivity + interacting with humans = worse.  Worse for the humans interacting with an animal that can't really be domesticated and worse for the animals who have been robbed their freedom.  The best thing the documentary does is show real human emotion for these majestic creatures, often showing how social and family-focused they are.  It's just so jittery in its narrative focus, bouncing all over the place, that in the end it doesn't really make a concrete point, other than one that we can probably reach on our own.

Unfortunately, that is corporate America for you.My only problem with the documentary is that it is very one-sided and does not contain any representatives from Sea World to counter some of the arguments.  That is not the fault of the filmmakers though.  Sea World decline to make any comments.Five stars for this documentary.

1657728,A2HEU3JKCJ5BJK,B00DL47ORO,"Tres Chic ""Reviewer""","[5, 5]","Blackfish is the story of the infamous Orca called Tilikum. The film features commentary from several former Sea World trainers, former Sea Land workers (Canadian park where Tilikum resided after his capture in 1982), and one of the men who actually captured Tilikum when he was just two years old back in 1982 off the coast of Iceland. Notably absent is any current representation of Sea World.I watched this with very little knowledge about Tilikum. I had known about the attack in 2010, and I faintly recalled the incident of a man being found in his pool, but other than that I really did not know too much about him. I actually watched this documentary twice, and both times found it very disturbing for different reasons. The first time was because I was far more focused on the whales, as the film talks about more than just Tilikum (though he is the primary focus). I know a fair bit about Orcas in general, and I know that they are not violent animals--normally. They do hunt for food like any other animal, but they don't coordinate attacks on humans in the wild. There has never been a single documented attack on a human in the wild, as this documentary also points out. Now, either no witnesses live to tell about it, or quite frankly it just doesn't happen. This documentary recalls the deaths of not only Dawn Brancheau in 2010, but also of two other trainers at the hands of orcas in captivity who were performers for Sea World and a park in the Canary Islands, Loro Parque, where the whales are owned by Sea World.  There are also several clips of incidents with the orcas and trainers that could have proven fatal as well. We also learn a little more about what really happened to the homeless man who fell into Tilikum's tank.Disturbance number two for me was hearing the scripted lies Sea World employees tell. In all fairness the employees did not seem to know much about marine life, and this is pretty much stated by all the trainers in the documentary. None of them really knew anything about the animals and just what Sea World told them to do. They also show Sea World employees stating facts that are simply not true. One of the most popular was about the dorsal fins being flopped over. This is something that happens in captivity due to a lack of room to swim, yet Sea World employees will say it happens in about 25% of whales in the wild. Also, their life span is pretty long, yet Sea World claims they live longer in captivity. This is simply not true, and its not like its hard to disprove these things, but that is why Sea World loses creditability quickly. I also found it extremely disturbing that these trainers were not told of incidents involving animals. I understand not wanting to scare people, but you are talking about a 5,000 pound whale not a stray dog. These are powerful animals and the trainers who escaped being killed were just extremely lucky.This film will open up your mind and have you questioning whether it is right to keep an animal like an orca in a swimming pool (because that's about what it amounts to), and make them work for food. I've never been to Sea World, but after watching this, I will never go and I will strongly encourage friends and family not to go either. I'd rather use my money to keep these creatures free and in the wild where they belong. Tilikum [and all other whales held in captivity] should be released to an open sea reserve where he can just be a whale and not be kept isolated. I do not see Sea World going out of business anytime soon, but its clear that this film is getting peoples attention, and that they are realizing all that glitters isn't gold.",5,Must Watch Documentary,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,3642,"['Blackfish', 'story', 'infamous', 'Orca', 'called', 'Tilikum', 'film', 'features', 'commentary', 'several', 'former', 'Sea', 'World', 'trainers', 'former', 'Sea', 'Land', 'workers', 'Canadian', 'park', 'where', 'Tilikum', 'resided', 'capture', '1982', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'actually', 'captured', 'Tilikum', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'back', '1982', 'coast', 'Iceland', 'Notably', 'absent', 'current', 'representation', 'Sea', 'World.I', 'watched', 'very', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Tilikum', 'had', 'known', 'attack', '2010', 'faintly', 'recalled', 'incident', 'man', 'being', 'found', 'pool', 'other', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'actually', 'watched', 'documentary', 'twice', 'times', 'found', 'very', 'disturbing', 'different', 'reasons', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'focused', 'whales', 'film', 'talks', 'more', 'just', 'Tilikum', 'primary', 'focus', 'know', 'fair', 'bit', 'Orcas', 'general', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'violent', 'animals', 'normally', 'do', 'hunt', 'food', 'other', 'animal', 'do', ""n't"", 'coordinate', 'attacks', 'humans', 'wild', 'never', 'been', 'single', 'documented', 'attack', 'human', 'wild', 'documentary', 'also', 'out', 'Now', 'either', 'witnesses', 'live', 'tell', 'quite', 'frankly', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'documentary', 'deaths', 'not', 'only', 'Dawn', 'Brancheau', '2010', 'also', 'two', 'other', 'trainers', 'hands', 'orcas', 'captivity', 'who', 'were', 'performers', 'Sea', 'World', 'park', 'Canary', 'Islands', 'Loro', 'Parque', 'where', 'whales', 'are', 'owned', 'Sea', 'World', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'clips', 'incidents', 'orcas', 'trainers', 'could', 'have', 'proven', 'fatal', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'fell', 'Tilikum', 'tank.Disturbance', 'number', 'two', 'was', 'hearing', 'scripted', 'lies', 'Sea', 'World', 'employees', 'tell', 'fairness', 'employees', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'know', 'much', 'marine', 'life', 'pretty', 'much', 'stated', 'trainers', 'documentary', 'None', 'really', 'knew', 'anything', 'animals', 'just', 'what', 'Sea', 'World', 'told', 'do', 'also', 'show', 'Sea', 'World', 'employees', 'stating', 'facts', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'One', 'most', 'popular', 'was', 'dorsal', 'being', 'flopped', 'something', 'captivity', 'due', 'lack', 'room', 'swim', 'yet', 'Sea', 'World', 'employees', 'will', 'say', 'about', '25', '%', 'whales', 'wild', 'Also', 'life', 'span', 'pretty', 'long', 'yet', 'Sea', 'World', 'live', 'longer', 'captivity', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'not', 'hard', 'disprove', 'things', 'why', 'Sea', 'World', 'creditability', 'quickly', 'also', 'found', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'trainers', 'were', 'not', 'told', 'incidents', 'involving', 'animals', 'understand', 'not', 'wanting', 'scare', 'people', 'are', 'talking', '5,000', 'pound', 'whale', 'not', 'stray', 'dog', 'are', 'powerful', 'animals', 'trainers', 'who', 'escaped', 'being', 'killed', 'were', 'just', 'extremely', 'lucky.This', 'film', 'will', 'open', 'up', 'mind', 'have', 'questioning', 'right', 'keep', 'animal', 'orca', 'swimming', 'pool', 'what', 'make', 'work', 'food', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Sea', 'World', 'watching', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'will', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'friends', 'family', 'not', 'go', 'either', ""'d"", 'rather', 'use', 'money', 'keep', 'creatures', 'free', 'wild', 'where', 'belong', 'Tilikum', '[', 'other', 'whales', 'held', 'captivity', ']', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'open', 'sea', 'reserve', 'where', 'can', 'just', 'be', 'whale', 'not', 'be', 'kept', 'isolated', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'Sea', 'World', 'going', 'business', 'anytime', 'soon', 'clear', 'film', 'getting', 'peoples', 'attention', 'are', 'realizing', 'glitters', ""n't"", 'gold']",N/A

This documentary uncovers not only the gross mistreatment of these majestic animals that goes on at Sea World, but also the lengths the company goes to in order to keep things hush-hush. Every major attack or fatality, they have an excuse...anything to hide the fact that these highly intelligent and emotional animals are being driven to what appear to be psychotic breaks towards their trainers.I'm open to considering that of course, this film was spun to show only what would sway the viewer towards the intended impression. When I see video after video of orca injured by their pool mates, many videos of attacks against trainers of varying intensity, video of adult orcas visibly mourning when their young are ripped away from them at management's whim, and clips of Sea World's PR machine in action working to deny what later is uncovered by numerous eye-witnesses after the latest fatality, I cannot help but think the opinion I formed watching this film is as it should be.I too would have liked to hear Sea World's side of the story, but according to this film, the company repeatedly declined to comment.
