Also, Rita Gam was really good in the role of Onida, daughter of a Mohawk chief. Still, for a Indian princess she spoke English like a Harvard grad, and that's where the corny part comes in. An entertaining movie regardless, and I'm glad I bought it. I will watch it again down the road.",4,Mohawk,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,411,"['like', 'old', 'westerns', 'little', 'corny', 'times', 'found', 'Allison', 'Hayes', 'character', 'Greta', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'Also', 'Rita', 'Gam', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'role', 'Onida', 'daughter', 'Mohawk', 'chief', 'Still', 'Indian', 'princess', 'spoke', 'English', 'Harvard', 'grad', 'where', 'corny', 'part', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'regardless', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'road']",N/A

This is the 3rd DVD title I've watched from Alpha and the quality is really lame.

496322,AK61LQI92GTCH,B00000F0H4,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[5, 5]","MOHAWK is a delightfully bad movie that succeeds despite itself.  Ostensibly about a 18th century frontier painter (Scott Brady), it's really nothing more than an innocent cheesecake (and beefcake) movie saddled to a western plot.Our hero Brady is away from the post, painting barmaid Greta's (Allison Hayes) picture when his Boston fianc&eacute;e, Cynthia (Lori Nelson), arrives.  Beautiful Mohawk princess (daughter of chief Ted de Corsia) Onida (Rita Gam) isn't on scene yet, but she arrives soon enough to take her place in the three-sided tug-of-war for the attention of our randy paint pusher.Things are ducky between the white settlers and the Iroquois (There's land enough for everybody, Chief Ted says at one point), save for the bitter machinations of landowner Butler (John Hoyt) and hawkish Tuscarora warrior Rokhawah (Neville Brand.)With that set-up, it should come as no surprise that most of act three takes place at the besieged white settlement.  Connoisseurs of bad westerns should enjoy the dialogue in MOHAWK, too.  There's the obligatory mule skinner observation - ""When a woman puts her warpaint on she's more dangerous than any injun!""  This pleasant, pseudo-Indian speak exchange between the nasty Rokhawah and good Chief Ted's son - ""Your tongue is too long!""  ""Your knife will not shorten it!""  Or this pungent observation by, I believe, the warrior Rokhawah - ""He who fills his mouth with big words ends by eating dirt!""  They don't write them like that anymore.  MOHAWK even has a song plunked down in the middle of it - ""Love Plays the Strings of My Banjo.""If that's not enough, MOHAWK has war dances that owe quite a bit more to Merce Cunningham than ethnographic research.  There are scoundrels in broadcloth and loincloth, glamorously beautiful women, Scott Brady clocking Neville Brand a time or two, an entertaining, movie ending battle scene.  What more could you ask for?The print, in glorious color, seems to have been taken from a decent master.  There are some instances of color flutter, but nothing drastic.  The disk also contains interesting text biographies of the stars and excerpts, some uncomplimentary, from reviews of the movie.  All in all, a discount disk worth a western fan's attention.",3,I'll come back for you!,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,2239,"['MOHAWK', 'delightfully', 'bad', 'movie', 'Ostensibly', '18th', 'century', 'frontier', 'painter', 'Scott', 'Brady', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'innocent', 'cheesecake', 'beefcake', 'movie', 'saddled', 'western', 'plot.Our', 'hero', 'Brady', 'away', 'post', 'painting', 'barmaid', 'Greta', 'Allison', 'Hayes', 'picture', 'when', 'Boston', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Cynthia', 'Lori', 'Nelson', 'Beautiful', 'Mohawk', 'princess', 'daughter', 'chief', 'Ted', 'de', 'Corsia', 'Onida', 'Rita', 'Gam', ""n't"", 'scene', 'yet', 'soon', 'enough', 'take', 'place', 'three-sided', 'tug-of-war', 'attention', 'randy', 'paint', 'pusher.Things', 'are', 'ducky', 'white', 'settlers', 'Iroquois', 'land', 'enough', 'everybody', 'Chief', 'Ted', 'one', 'point', 'save', 'bitter', 'machinations', 'landowner', 'Butler', 'John', 'Hoyt', 'hawkish', 'Tuscarora', 'warrior', 'Rokhawah', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'set-up', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'most', 'act', 'three', 'place', 'besieged', 'white', 'settlement', 'Connoisseurs', 'bad', 'westerns', 'should', 'enjoy', 'dialogue', 'MOHAWK', 'too', 'obligatory', 'mule', 'skinner', 'observation', 'When', 'woman', 'warpaint', 'more', 'dangerous', 'injun', 'pleasant', 'pseudo-Indian', 'speak', 'exchange', 'nasty', 'Rokhawah', 'good', 'Chief', 'Ted', 'son', 'tongue', 'too', 'long', 'knife', 'will', 'not', 'shorten', 'pungent', 'observation', 'believe', 'warrior', 'Rokhawah', 'who', 'mouth', 'big', 'words', 'ends', 'eating', 'dirt', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'anymore', 'MOHAWK', 'even', 'song', 'plunked', 'down', 'middle', 'Love', 'Strings', 'My', 'Banjo', 'not', 'enough', 'MOHAWK', 'war', 'dances', 'owe', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'Merce', 'Cunningham', 'ethnographic', 'research', 'are', 'scoundrels', 'loincloth', 'glamorously', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Scott', 'Brady', 'clocking', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'time', 'two', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'ending', 'battle', 'scene', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'print', 'glorious', 'color', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'decent', 'master', 'are', 'instances', 'color', 'flutter', 'nothing', 'drastic', 'disk', 'also', 'interesting', 'text', 'biographies', 'stars', 'excerpts', 'uncomplimentary', 'reviews', 'movie', 'discount', 'disk', 'western', 'fan', 'attention']",N/A
