Its not necessarily a feel good happy tale or slap stick comedy, but its one of those movies that you realize was a tremendous performance and very well done.  Could not have picked a better choice than Downey Jr. to portray Chaplin.  I feel that Chaplin is one of those icon's that most of today's generations don't know hardly a thing about.  This movie provided great and informative insight into Chaplin as a man and entertainer.  I feel a much deeper respect for Chaplin as well as Downey Jr. for having watched it.

671139,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00005O084,Craig Connell,"[1, 2]","Wow, this is one of the finest acting jobs I have seen as Robert Downey Jr. portrays the famous Charlie Chaplin. His performance includes some of Chaplin's famous slapstick moves and Downey is tremendous at executing them.To the film's credit ,it does show both the good and bad sides to this famous man. But it's definitely biased. Just check out how they portray J. Edgar Hoover, a man Hollywood loves to hate (along with any Conservative or Republican). Hoover is pictured as mean-spirited and nasty throughout, and is even blasted in the ending credits! (His first speech at a dinner table, intended to show him in a negative actually shows him to be prophetic whether Tinseltown ever admits it or not.)Regarding Chaplin, if the film was the truth (that's always a big ""if""), then it WAS a real miscarriage of justice to kick him out of the country for having a baby he didn't produce. Nevertheless, most of the film centers around his career and his wives, most of whom were very pretty with great figures.....but too young, most of them being teenagers!Also shown nicely in the film are Chaplin's talent, his obsession with work, his great friendship with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Kevin Kline), the great films he produced and the sympathy he had with the American poor. On the other side, in addition to his pedophile instincts, one wonders why Chaplin never became an American citizen? They certainly did not help his cause.The movie sports a big-name cast, with Kline probably providing the most likable role next to Downey. The women were very interesting: from Geraldine Chaplin playing Charlie's insane, pathetically-sad mother to beauties like Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane and Moria Kelly, the latter playing Chaplin's final and devoted wife ""Oona.""Also in here are some big names: Anthony Hopkins, Dan Ackroyd, Penelope Ann Miller, Marissa Tomei, James Woods, Nancy Travis and Paul Rhys. They all help make this a memorable biography. It's beautifully filmed with a number of stunning scenes and also has a classy soundtrack. I'd like to see this on Blu-Ray!  The story's ending is manipulative, but it works. It always brings a tear to my eye.I liked what they did at the end with the small biographies of all the leading characters and visually showing who played each one.

In this case, it is THE biopic of Sir Charlie Chaplin (Robert Downey, Jr., who at this point really ought to drop the ""Jr.""). Beginning with Chaplin ten years before his death, it shows us his wrangling with his autobiography. An unnecessary contrivance in the form of a ghost writer (Sir Anthony Hopkins) probably contributed to the padding out of this film.It is beautifully, colorfully filmed and anyone with an interest in Chaplin/his era must see this if you haven't seen it. The performances are very, very good ~ Downey shows no sign of the goofiness that marked a lot of his appearances in other films. The music is unobtrusive, mainly harkening back to the weirdly tinkling programme music from the silent film era.The entire thing evokes much atmosphere. Aside from the slightly later Jane Austen film adaptations, this is one of the best period films ever made. Downey was simultaneously castigated and praised to the skies for his portrayal of Chaplin. His startling abilities and physical resemblance help a great deal, but there can be no doubt Downey's pure genius is totally on display. He's even able to modify his facial features to make him resemble Chaplin even more, especially around the eyes. That was not done by makeup though I think Downey did have a set of false teeth.It seems to me this film must be lacking in something: it has been nearly totally forgotten, and when I first saw Downey in the role of Sherlock Holmes I suddenly recalled, ""This isn't the first time he's played an Englishman."" The trouble is, I do not know what this film is lacking. It is all in all a beautiful, well-made movie.The trouble is that this film was a groundbreaking, trend-setting film and not everyone was accustomed to that at the start of the 1990s. This was Downey's big-star role, something that would try to help catapult him to superstardom. It was also the best attempt at presenting to the audience an overall impression of Chaplin's life and his own rise to superstardom. Some of this film deals poignantly with Chaplin converting from a comic to a huge legend.I will always recommend this film as one of the absolute must-see films of all time. It launched many a star (like Milla Jovovich who plays Chaplin's first wife), brought stars to our attention (Chaplin's daughter, Geraldine, portrays his mother in the film) and gave much-needed visibility to old hands such as Dan Aykroyd and Kevin Kline.Most vitally, it reminds us of an earlier, seminal star whose life really was his work, and who died thinking he just might have been nothing but a failure. Few people can fail to understand that message.",5,"Spectacular, so why is it forgotten?",1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,2685,"['CHAPLIN', '1992', '144', 'minutes', 'one', 'THE', 'movies', 'case', 'THE', 'biopic', 'Sir', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'point', 'really', 'ought', 'drop', 'Jr.', 'Beginning', 'Chaplin', 'ten', 'years', 'death', 'wrangling', 'autobiography', 'unnecessary', 'contrivance', 'form', 'ghost', 'writer', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'probably', 'contributed', 'padding', 'film.It', 'beautifully', 'colorfully', 'filmed', 'anyone', 'interest', 'Chaplin/his', 'era', 'must', 'see', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', '~', 'Downey', 'sign', 'goofiness', 'marked', 'lot', 'appearances', 'other', 'films', 'music', 'unobtrusive', 'mainly', 'harkening', 'back', 'weirdly', 'tinkling', 'programme', 'music', 'silent', 'film', 'era.The', 'entire', 'thing', 'evokes', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'Aside', 'slightly', 'later', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'film', 'adaptations', 'one', 'best', 'period', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Downey', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'castigated', 'praised', 'skies', 'portrayal', 'Chaplin', 'startling', 'abilities', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'help', 'great', 'deal', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'Downey', 'pure', 'genius', 'totally', 'display', 'even', 'able', 'modify', 'facial', 'features', 'make', 'resemble', 'Chaplin', 'even', 'more', 'especially', 'eyes', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'makeup', 'think', 'Downey', 'did', 'have', 'set', 'false', 'teeth.It', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'lacking', 'something', 'been', 'nearly', 'totally', 'forgotten', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Downey', 'role', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'suddenly', 'recalled', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'played', 'Englishman', 'trouble', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'lacking', 'beautiful', 'well-made', 'movie.The', 'trouble', 'film', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'trend-setting', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'was', 'accustomed', 'start', '1990s', 'was', 'Downey', 'big-star', 'role', 'something', 'would', 'try', 'help', 'catapult', 'superstardom', 'was', 'also', 'best', 'attempt', 'presenting', 'audience', 'overall', 'impression', 'Chaplin', 'life', 'own', 'rise', 'superstardom', 'film', 'poignantly', 'Chaplin', 'converting', 'comic', 'huge', 'legend.I', 'will', 'always', 'recommend', 'film', 'one', 'absolute', 'must-see', 'films', 'time', 'launched', 'many', 'star', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'who', 'Chaplin', 'first', 'wife', 'brought', 'stars', 'attention', 'Chaplin', 'daughter', 'Geraldine', 'mother', 'film', 'gave', 'much-needed', 'visibility', 'old', 'hands', 'such', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Kevin', 'Kline.Most', 'vitally', 'earlier', 'seminal', 'star', 'life', 'really', 'was', 'work', 'who', 'died', 'thinking', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'failure', 'Few', 'people', 'can', 'fail', 'understand', 'message']",N/A

The acting is superlative and Robert Downey, Jr. in particular does a tour-de-force performance as Charles Chaplin. We really get to see the man Chaplin as a human being, both successful and sometimes victimized as he works in Hollywood; and the cinematography is excellent.The film begins with Robert Downey, Jr. all made up as The Little Tramp--but it quickly breaks away to Chaplin as an old man giving a bit more information about his life story as the editor of his autobiography (a partially fictionalized character George Hayden played by Anthony Hopkins) asks Chaplin questions. Thus we see Chaplin's story primarily in flashbacks.Chaplin tells the story of how he became a star in vaudeville not long after he got his first break; and he could always make the audiences laugh. But already not everything has gone well for Charlie--although he has his older brother Sydney for support, their mother Hannah (Geraldine Chaplin) is in an asylum for insane persons and his father is very absent. Charles also relates to the editor of his autobiography how he rose to fame at Mack Sennett (Dan Aykroyd) studios and how within just a couple of years was directing his own films making more than Sennett ever did. We also see Charlie's attempts at love--his first crush never married him and it took him a forth try at marriage to a lady named Oona (Moira Kelly, who also plays Charlie's first crush Hetty Kelly) to make a true love last. Along the way we get good performances by Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks and Marisa Tomei as a fearsome Mabel Normand who fell into obscurity after a scandal broke loose involving her.Unfortunately, the movie takes liberties with the telling of Chaplin's real life. In the movie Charlie barely mentions anything about his father and Chaplin indicates that his father was rather absent when prompted to talk about him from his editor. In real life, Chaplin's father took care of Charlie and Sydney for about four years when their mother could not do so. In addition, the creation of The Little Tramp character was done gradually over a couple of months perhaps; but in the movie it happened spontaneously with Chaplin's first flick at Mack Sennett's studios. The movie makes no mention of the eight children he had with Oona; and although he never lived an especially fancy lifestyle in later life, the movie depicts his home in Switzerland as being rather opulent.The DVD has a few extras; I liked the interview with director Richard Attenborough the best.Overall, Chaplin is a great film; but the inaccuracies take away one and one-half stars to make this a three and one-half star review. There are no references to the jumps Chaplin made between Sennett to Essanay Studios, Mutual and First National Studios. Ouch! It's a great tear-jerker at times, especially at the end, but if you're looking for real life in its purest form Chaplin is something more of a fanciful biopic than an accurate one.",4,Is this Chaplin--or Cr*plin ???

Some say Chaplin was the first actor to open up the world market and the isolating affect it had on him is explored in this film. Incidentally, Chaplin was considered the most famous film star worldwide during World War I.This 1992 film explores Chaplin's rise to stardom going from acting troupes to taking a job in America in silent films and his gradual control over later films (some not so popular at the time like ""The Great Dictator""), as well as his turbulent romances/marriages (especially the ugly and controversial paternity lawsuit a la Joan Barry) to finally finding the right one. We also get a look into his many pictorial roles, his co-founding of United Artists as well as how McCarthyism ended up fracturing his career and having him move to Switzerland for the next several decades.There's a nice finale to Chaplin's life in which he returns to the 1972 Academy Awards to receive a special award and discovers that even though Hollywood has changed greatly it never forgot him. One of the last of the clips to be shown is a kid being taken away from his father in which Chaplin is arguably demonstrating the fantasy of what he wished for when he was a child. That was a nice wraparound to one of the matters which haunted Chaplin's past . . . being an orphan and abandoned by his parents. I believe the actual picture was the 1921 ""The Kid"".Downey's acting got him a nomination for Best Actor by the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards but BAFTA gave him the actual award for Best Actor. The film was nominated by those three for other awards (too many to list, really).

This was his crowning acheivement as one of cinema's most beloved and innovative characters, Charlie Chaplin.He is the best part of this movie, portraying Chaplin as a perfectionist and artist looking to make the new medium of film into more than a passing fad.  His personal life, however, was what really made a name for himself and what really set him apart.  He had a yen for young girls, and in a time when things like this were well hiden and not talked about, he was one of the first who was set apart.  As a celebrity he would naturally be the target of obsessed fans and crazies, as well as be the first to be hauled in for un American activities as many of his peers were in Hollywood at the time of the Red Scare.  It's admirable to see how he grew up dirt poor in England and came to America to make his proverbial dreams come true.  It isn't so admirable to see how he interacts with young women, up until his last wife, Oona Damein, who would stay by his side forever.  The May-December romance was no doubt idealized, but then again they had eight children (the last of which was fathered when he was 74).The story flow is alright, and it does a good job of showing us what his trials and tribulations were in his lifetime.

671185,A1J03J0HZ7KU5T,B00005O084,Scott T. Rivers,"[5, 7]","Robert Downey Jr. earned an Oscar nomination for his brilliantly detailed incarnation of Sir Charles Chaplin (1889-1977). Unfortunately, ""Chaplin"" (1993) comes off as a horribly clich&eacute;d Hollywood biopic. Director Richard Attenborough utilizes a clumsy script that emphasizes the tabloid aspects of Chaplin's personal life rather than his cinematic achievements. The film's historical inaccuracies and omissions are cringeworthy. Among the bloopers: Charlie's dinner-party snub of J. Edgar Hoover leads to a long-running FBI investigation; a few audience members yell ""Communist!"" during the final speech in ""The Great Dictator""; and the controversial ""Monsieur Verdoux"" simply does not exist. Worse still, Attenborough makes the disastrous error of incorporating a fictitious biographer (played by Anthony Hopkins) to justify the contrived flashback structure - then admits this deceit in the closing credits. On a positive note, Geraldine Chaplin delivers a moving portrayal as her own grandmother while Sven Nykvist's cinematography captures the nostalgic glow of Early Hollywood.

671193,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00005O084,Visual Bureau,"[0, 1]","""While not highly regarded as some biopics of a high measure, Chaplin tells the interesting stories of the great actor, comedian, director, writer, philanderer, satirist, and entrepreneur himself from his rags-to-riches story of living in poverty in industrial England to making it in America.The Chaplin biopic tends to focus much of its lens on his emotional complexities and social mishaps when he married and dated several women and having to deal with his work being the subject of controversy under a communist-fearing government and an anti-American, First World War-depressed British public and so much more. It almost makes you wonder the ""left-wing"" idea that having so much (money, fame, fortune) can often bring someone down if they are not careful. That axiom remains true and Robert Downey, Jr brings, even if American, a compelling persona to the legend himself and reminding that there was a uniquely human side to Chaplin than just the zaniness and slapstick he was known for.While not factually accurate 100%, the Anthony Hopkins side storyline which shows him during Chaplin's years of ailment and old age is compelling enough that the interview element of the narrative is effective and humorous on some lights to indicate how his timely arrogance pursued all those years. The humour is still prevalent here and is notable in the scenes where he starts filming his great works (with the fast shutter-speed slapstick) and the satire is indicated (but not very highly) with his controversial film, The Great Dictator (if only they could have mentioned more about M. Verdoux, the one that really made communist-fearing America hate him). While not all that relevant, parents might find the PG-13 rating in this film troubling because there is quite a bit of sight of the breast nudity here than found in another PG-13 black sheep like Titanic.While there is a lot to cover about this man, the film does not feel like it drags on much like the Capote film and the humour and novelty of his persona carries the film to a higher bar than I could have anticipated. Much like a recent film I've seen like this called The Artist (which focuses on a man's emotional journey in a transitional period from silent films to ""talkies""), Chaplin does that and even more and could have easily been silent if it wanted to?""",4,Intriguing biopic/comedy/drama for starters entering the Chaplin universe!,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,2325,"['not', 'highly', 'regarded', 'biopics', 'high', 'measure', 'Chaplin', 'interesting', 'stories', 'great', 'actor', 'comedian', 'director', 'writer', 'philanderer', 'satirist', 'entrepreneur', 'rags-to-riches', 'story', 'living', 'poverty', 'industrial', 'England', 'making', 'America.The', 'Chaplin', 'biopic', 'focus', 'much', 'lens', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'social', 'mishaps', 'when', 'married', 'dated', 'several', 'women', 'having', 'deal', 'work', 'being', 'subject', 'controversy', 'communist-fearing', 'government', 'anti-American', 'First', 'World', 'War-depressed', 'British', 'public', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'almost', 'wonder', 'left-wing', 'idea', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'fame', 'fortune', 'can', 'often', 'bring', 'someone', 'down', 'are', 'not', 'careful', 'axiom', 'true', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'even', 'American', 'compelling', 'persona', 'legend', 'reminding', 'was', 'uniquely', 'human', 'side', 'Chaplin', 'just', 'zaniness', 'slapstick', 'was', 'known', 'for.While', 'not', 'factually', 'accurate', '100', '%', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'side', 'storyline', 'Chaplin', 'years', 'ailment', 'old', 'age', 'compelling', 'enough', 'interview', 'element', 'narrative', 'effective', 'humorous', 'lights', 'indicate', 'how', 'timely', 'arrogance', 'pursued', 'years', 'humour', 'still', 'prevalent', 'here', 'notable', 'scenes', 'where', 'filming', 'great', 'works', 'fast', 'shutter-speed', 'slapstick', 'satire', 'indicated', 'not', 'very', 'highly', 'controversial', 'film', 'Great', 'Dictator', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'mentioned', 'more', 'M.', 'Verdoux', 'one', 'really', 'made', 'communist-fearing', 'America', 'hate', 'not', 'relevant', 'parents', 'might', 'find', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'film', 'troubling', 'quite', 'bit', 'sight', 'breast', 'nudity', 'here', 'found', 'PG-13', 'black', 'sheep', 'Titanic.While', 'lot', 'cover', 'man', 'film', 'not', 'feel', 'much', 'Capote', 'film', 'humour', 'novelty', 'persona', 'film', 'higher', 'bar', 'could', 'have', 'anticipated', 'Much', 'recent', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'called', 'Artist', 'man', 'emotional', 'journey', 'transitional', 'period', 'silent', 'films', 'talkies', 'Chaplin', 'even', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'silent', 'wanted']",N/A
