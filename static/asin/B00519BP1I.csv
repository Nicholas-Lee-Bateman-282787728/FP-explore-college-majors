Being a small budget film maker myself I can understand the strong desire to create.2. Getting inspired by a big budget film especially sci-fi (like Star Trek/Wars) can really inspire you to want to create your own version of the aforementioned creations.3. Just the massive amount of effort that goes into the production of a small budget movie, even two guys and a camcorder is phenominal. The hard drive space, the score, any friends/actors. Just to get the cheesecake you see before you is a tremendous amount of effort on someone who believes part.So all that being said I can forgive this movie for having some non original purchase on the internet 3d models some of which O have in my own arsenal and recognized immediately.I can forgive the bad effects, and terrible setting if the movie is still somewhat engaging.I didn't find the costumes as bad as some others may have I thought they were fairly well done for a no budget movie.I can't forgive the potty mouth dialogue and the terrible way the narrator tries to tell us a story without any visual representation of said story. It's like we got 3 minutes of cheap 3d models and home animation/switch to some stock footage of a riot/switch back to 3d models/ swear a few times/ switch back to stock footage. 18 minutes into the film sounds goes silent I'd imagine it's where the traffic at the shopping center they filmed at overrode the actors dialogue so they said heck with it and cut the sound.I never tell anyone NOT to watch a movie I think you SHOULD watch it and formulate your own opinion this one is mine and you know opinions are like armpits everyone has one and most stink.-thanks!",1,Sad to say this is pooey.,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1737,"['So', 'generally', 'am', 'pretty', 'soft', 'when', 'reviewing', 'movies', 'here', 'why.1', 'Being', 'small', 'budget', 'film', 'maker', 'can', 'understand', 'strong', 'desire', 'create.2', 'Getting', 'inspired', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'especially', 'sci-fi', 'Star', 'Trek/Wars', 'can', 'really', 'inspire', 'want', 'create', 'own', 'version', 'aforementioned', 'creations.3', 'massive', 'amount', 'effort', 'production', 'small', 'budget', 'movie', 'even', 'two', 'guys', 'camcorder', 'phenominal', 'hard', 'drive', 'space', 'score', 'friends/actors', 'Just', 'get', 'cheesecake', 'see', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'effort', 'someone', 'who', 'part.So', 'being', 'said', 'can', 'forgive', 'movie', 'having', 'non', 'original', 'purchase', 'internet', '3d', 'models', 'O', 'have', 'own', 'arsenal', 'recognized', 'immediately.I', 'can', 'forgive', 'bad', 'effects', 'terrible', 'setting', 'movie', 'still', 'somewhat', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'costumes', 'as', 'bad', 'others', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'were', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'budget', 'movie.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'potty', 'mouth', 'dialogue', 'terrible', 'way', 'narrator', 'tell', 'story', 'visual', 'representation', 'said', 'story', 'got', '3', 'minutes', 'cheap', '3d', 'models', 'home', 'animation/switch', 'stock', 'footage', 'riot/switch', 'back', '3d', 'models/', 'swear', 'few', 'times/', 'switch', 'back', 'stock', 'footage', '18', 'minutes', 'film', 'silent', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'where', 'traffic', 'shopping', 'center', 'filmed', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'said', 'heck', 'cut', 'sound.I', 'never', 'tell', 'anyone', 'NOT', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'SHOULD', 'watch', 'formulate', 'own', 'opinion', 'one', 'mine', 'know', 'opinions', 'are', 'armpits', 'everyone', 'one', 'most', 'stink.-thanks']",Defcon 2012

1436359,A2NMJJV2KTQ9Y5,B00519BP1I,sci-fi fan,"[0, 0]","This low-budget sci-fi film clearly demonstrates how incompetent sound design can destroy a film.  The film is slow moving and depends upon various characters describing the back story and what is currently happening to the viewer.  Unfortunately, the sound designer has worked overtime to insure that most of the dialog is unintelligable.  Each character's voice was apparently recorded separately and then edited together at the end.  The main character and his robot pal were actually standing within a few FEET of the microphone and so can occasionally be understood.  The two telepath characters spoke from a distance into a voice garbler and so only every fourth word or so can be understood.  The worst character is the earth girl who tells the backstory.  Her lines were apparently recorded in a high school gymnasium without the benefit of a microphone.  Add to this super-loud blaring rock music that is played whenever the characters get into a large room totally obscuring the dialog and you have a ""talkie"" that may as well as be a silent film.  The director thought of that as well as the film has no subtitles so the viewer can't ""see"" the lines that they can't hear either.  This picture should be shown in college sound design courses throughout the country as a model of how NOT to edit sound.I lent this film to my brother to watch.
