I would only recommend it for people with some dance experience because she does each move VERY FAST without slowly demonstrating it first.  For those who can keep up with her, it makes for a great energetic/tiring workout.  There are a variety of fun moves...except in between each move she often does a boring ""Basic Step""(but this step does serve the purpose of having the ""students"" catch up with her if we're out of sync and also serves the purpose of keeping body moving and heart rate up while waiting to do the next step).This Vol 2 is good in that the camera angles show her feet/legs (unlike the Vol 3 DVD which focuses the camera on her face/torso).",5,Fast moves for energetic workout,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,699,"['Overall', 'like', 'DVD', 'workout', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'people', 'dance', 'experience', 'move', 'VERY', 'FAST', 'slowly', 'demonstrating', 'first', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'great', 'energetic/tiring', 'workout', 'are', 'variety', 'fun', 'moves', 'move', 'often', 'boring', 'Basic', 'Step', 'step', 'serve', 'purpose', 'having', 'students', 'catch', 'up', ""'re"", 'sync', 'also', 'purpose', 'keeping', 'body', 'moving', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'waiting', 'do', 'next', 'step', '2', 'good', 'camera', 'show', 'feet/legs', 'Vol', '3', 'DVD', 'camera', 'face/torso']","Masala Bhangra Workout, Vol. 2: Hip Hop Style"

I didn't find it too fast at all, I have purchased two Hip Hop DVDs before this and Jain's instructions were so much easier to learn and follow than classical Hip Hop. She almost always return to her ""Basic"" move, which allows you to catch up if you fall behind.The moves are not complicated (although the head wiggle isn't as easy as it looks!) so by the 3rd time through most people should be able to do basic Bhangra smoothly. And her sequences make for easy transitions.Lastly, I have bad knees - had a meniscus repair a few years ago from over aggressive skiing. So I had to give away a DVD by a ""celebrity"" hip hop dance person because I couldn't do any of the low moves or squats. This DVD does not make my knees hurt. So its a keeper, especially if you aren't as limber as you used to be.",4,"Very different, very fun!",1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,868,"['bought', '2', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'style', 'based', 'earlier', 'Amazon', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'fast', 'have', 'purchased', 'two', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'DVDs', 'Jain', 'instructions', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'learn', 'follow', 'classical', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'almost', 'always', 'return', 'Basic', 'move', 'catch', 'up', 'fall', 'behind.The', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'complicated', 'head', 'wiggle', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'so', '3rd', 'time', 'most', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'basic', 'Bhangra', 'smoothly', 'sequences', 'make', 'easy', 'transitions.Lastly', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'had', 'meniscus', 'repair', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'aggressive', 'skiing', 'had', 'give', 'away', 'DVD', 'celebrity', 'hip', 'hop', 'dance', 'person', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'low', 'moves', 'squats', 'DVD', 'not', 'make', 'knees', 'hurt', 'keeper', 'especially', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'limber', 'used', 'be']","Masala Bhangra Workout, Vol. 2: Hip Hop Style"

Some of the moves in this video were already covered in the first one and in her All-Star Workouts routine (which I wish was also available on DVD). Additionally, the production quality was not as good as it should have been. I will be getting Volume 3 eventually, however, because I am interested in learning as much Bhangra as I can.",2,Bhangra,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,395,"['did', 'not', 'one', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'Volume', '1', 'moves', 'video', 'were', 'already', 'covered', 'first', 'one', 'All-Star', 'Workouts', 'routine', 'wish', 'was', 'also', 'available', 'DVD', 'Additionally', 'production', 'quality', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'Volume', '3', 'eventually', 'however', 'am', 'interested', 'learning', 'as', 'much', 'Bhangra', 'can']","Masala Bhangra Workout, Vol. 2: Hip Hop Style"
805949,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B0001I1J7O,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[0, 0]","I tried the first Masala Bhangra Workout w/Sarina Jain & loved it, so I also tried this one after seeing a youtube clip.Sarina Jain is a great teacher & her love of dance really motivates you. She also has great fluidity & having her teach w/a mic as she dances is a great change of place. Compared to the first one, the students here aren't professional or aspiring professionals, but they are pretty good.The moves are introduced by text display, and Sarina DOES breakdown the moves, first starting with the lower body, then upper. She will even break down so you learn it in 4 layers. I had no trouble following & I have never taken a dance class nor am I a natural dancer. The moves are very simple & I did not think it needed that much breakdown.The only con other then the backup dancers not having as much energy as the professionals in the first one is one I agree with that other reviewers mentioned. The beat, that really isn't as much a motivator. But Sarina's love & excitement of dance & to share it makes up for it in my opinion.See a clip on youtube under: Sarina Jain's Masala Bhangra Workout Vol 2",4,"Great fun, really energetic, make syou sweat dance",1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,1114,"['tried', 'first', 'Masala', 'Bhangra', 'Workout', 'w/Sarina', 'Jain', 'loved', 'also', 'tried', 'one', 'seeing', 'youtube', 'clip.Sarina', 'Jain', 'great', 'teacher', 'love', 'dance', 'really', 'also', 'great', 'fluidity', 'having', 'teach', 'w/a', 'mic', 'great', 'change', 'place', 'Compared', 'first', 'one', 'students', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'professional', 'aspiring', 'professionals', 'are', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'moves', 'are', 'introduced', 'text', 'display', 'Sarina', 'DOES', 'breakdown', 'moves', 'first', 'starting', 'lower', 'body', 'then', 'upper', 'will', 'even', 'break', 'down', 'so', 'learn', '4', 'layers', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'have', 'never', 'taken', 'dance', 'class', 'am', 'natural', 'dancer', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'simple', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'needed', 'much', 'only', 'other', 'then', 'backup', 'not', 'having', 'as', 'much', 'energy', 'professionals', 'first', 'one', 'one', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'beat', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'motivator', 'Sarina', 'love', 'excitement', 'dance', 'share', 'up', 'opinion.See', 'clip', 'youtube', 'Sarina', 'Jain', 'Masala', 'Bhangra', 'Workout', 'Vol', '2']","Masala Bhangra Workout, Vol. 2: Hip Hop Style"
