1537393,A1NBXH3Q5Y933P,B007S0DB56,"asugar2 ""asugar2""","[0, 0]","Most Powerful Intense Action Film I have seen recently! Explains How a Korean in German Uniform was Captured  on D-Day by US forces!My Way (Hangul: &#47560;&#51060; &#50920;&#51060;; RR: Mai Wei) is a 2011 South Korean war film, co-written and directed by Kang Je-gyu which stars Korean actor Jang Dong-gun along with Japanese actor Joe Odagiri and Chinese actress Fan Bingbing. This film is inspired by the true story and documentary of a Korean named Yang Kyoungjong who was captured by the Americans on D-Day. Yang Kyoungjong was forcibly conscripted in the Japanese Imperial Army, the Soviet Red Army and the German Wehrmacht. Soundtrack by Andrea Bocelli - To Find My Way.In multiple languages, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, than German with English subtitles, not much plot but with lotsa Action and Suspense so don't let that put you off from seeing it. more than two hours of savage, bloody CGI-enhanced combat, with explosions galore and a body count seldom seen on the big screen.(ala Saving Private Ryan) Everything looks terrific -- which is to be expected from the movie with the largest budget ($25 million) and Korea's largest production ever made and inspired by a true story. More than two hours and 57,500 fired-bullets long, according to press material, My Way is an epic eye-popping, Second World War movie through two theatres of war and 3 battlefields with four different armies.  Early in the film an evil Japanese commander tortures Korean recruits with a taunt from the Monty Python Ministry of Silly Ethnic Slurs: ""Kimchi-breath!"" Kimchi-breath? Well, you know how the Koreans like their soaked vegetables.My Way is drawn from a real-life incident: a 1944 photo of a captured Korean soldier wearing a Nazi uniform after D-Day. How did he get there?According to South Korean filmmaker Kang Je-gyu ( Shiri, Taegukgi(Brothers of War), what might have happened was a village feud got all out of control. A great marathoner, Tatsuo Hasegawa (J ""Joe"" Odagiri) is the grandson of a Japanese Colonel stationed in Korea. Tatsuo's only sporting rival, ironically, is his equally proud Korean servant, the splendidly athletic Kim Jun-shik (South Korean superstar, Jan Dong-gun).The boys race to represent Korea in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. The film starts with them racing as little boys from the moment they meet but by the time they are teenagers (Do Ji-han, Kobayashi Yukichi), they have become fierce competitors, the rivalry reaching a head when imperial higher-ups strip Jun-shik of his rightful Olympic qualification after beating Tatsuo starting a riot . As punishment the Korean rioters are consctripted into the Japanese army. A couple of years later, in 1939, they both find themselves at the Mongolian border--Tatsuo as a evil/sadistic colonel and Jun-shik  who takes a stand when Tatsu sends 50 Koreans on a suicide mission to destroy Soviet tanks. When Tatsuo orders Jun-shik's execution, the latter simply runs away, the first of many last-minute escapes from certain death managed by the two fleet-of-foot main characters. While escaping, Jun-shik, seeing Russian tanks on the horizon, attempts to return to base to warn the Japanese forces. During his return, he is attacked by a Soviet fighter-plane and is saved by Shirai(Fan BingBing), a sniper Jun-shik captured earlier after she killed all the Japanese in his squad but who he later freed, but she dies after shooting down the plane with just one shot. Jun-shik returns to the base and manages to warn the Japanese forces that a large-scale Soviet tank attack is coming but Tatsuo refuses to order a retreat. Each CGI-enhanced battle scene (Kang appears to have a Michael Bay-ish fondness for showing combat vehicles massed in formation) effects a realignment of the Jun-shik/ Tatsuo dynamic. As they meet again in a freezing icey Soviet Gulag and then later as Nazi soldiers at sunny Normandy Beach, bad blood gives way to a deepening mutual reliance and respect helping Tatsu change from finding redemption.",5,How a Korean in German Uniform Was Captured on D-Day!

1537398,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007S0DB56,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In Korea, it's common to watch the large scale epics, may it be an action drama of traditional Korea to the tensions of South and North Korea.  But in 2011, filmmaker and writer Kang Je-Kyu (""Shiri"", ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"", ""Gameui Beobjig"") began to work on his latest big budget film ""My Way"".A film inspired by the photo and story of Kyoungjong Yang, captured by Americans in Normandy in 1944 during World War II, the Korean soldier was found dressed in a German uniform, but what surprised people is that he served for the Imperial Japanese Army, the Russian and German military.  How is this possible?  How would have life been for Yang?So, Kang Je-Kyu would go to work on what would become one of the most expensive Korean film of all time.  Not only would it star Korea's Jang Dong-gun (""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"", ""The Promise"", ""The Coast Guard"") but it would also star Japanese star Jo Odagiri (""Shinobi: Heart Under Blade"", ""Bright Future"", ""Tokyo Tower: Mom and Me, and Sometimes Dad"") and Chinese star Bingbing Fan (""Battle of the Warriors"", ""Flash Point"", ""Shaolin"").The scope of the war would lead the characters beginning with Japanese-occupied Korea, the Mongolian border, the Soviet Union, Germany and Normandy, France.  And because of the film's budget and wider focus, the battle scenes are more detailed, more vast (and suffice to say, looking more expensive) than any Korean film ever made.VIDEO:""My Way"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray.  From the opening scenes of showcasing Jun-shik Kim, you can see the detail of the grime on his face but then go forward to the more war scenes or the characters in the frozen train ride to Russia, there is a lot of detail featured in those scenes.  The intense action sequences are just chaotic, scenes of war is amazingly detailed from its look of despair, violence, bloody carnage to explosions galore, I was quite impressed by the look of this film in HD.Amazing detail, colors vary from warm to cool depending on the area, but when the characters arrive in Normandy, colors are much more vibrant thanks to the change of scenery.  Black levels are nice and deep and I saw no artifacts or any more issues while watching the film.""My Way"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""My Way"" is presented in Korean 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Korean Dolby Digital Stereo, Also in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English Dolby Digital Stereo.  While I don't listen to English dub tracks for Asian cinema, it's good to know that people who can't watch films with English subtitles, do have that option with this Blu-ray release.As one would expect from a war film, this is an immersive lossless soundtrack.  From bullets shooting all around you, hearing tanks rummaging and crunching its way through barriers, overhead planes attacking and spraying bullets to bombs being dropped and many scenes of many structures blowing up, the surround channels are utilized as with the LFE for the low frequency booms.  The lossless soundtrack is amazing!English subtitles are included and easy to read!SPECIAL FEATURES""My Way"" comes with the following special features:Making Of - (9:03) Behind the scenes of ""My Way"".Interviews with Jang Dong-Gun and Director Kang Je-Kyu - (5:52) A short feature about Jang Dong-gun's interest in the film and how Kang Je-kyu became inspired to make this film.Trailers - Featuring the theatrical trailer for ""My Way"" (1:59), the home video trailer (2:11) and the international trailer (2:56).EXTRAS:""My Way"" comes with a slip cover.JUDGMENT CALL:I have watched many Korean war films and ""My Way"" is no doubt, the most ambitious film to come out of Korea and one of the best war films to come from Korea.Inspired by a photo of a Korean soldier in a German uniform, anyone who has seen the photo before has asked themselves, how is it possible?  While the story of ""My Way"" was inspired by the photo, it is not a story about the soldier but a story about how Korea was during the time of Japanese rule.There will always be this lingering dispute between both countries.  And as their have been amazing progress politically and thanks to Korean entertainment permeating worldwide and both countries working with each other in many ways, while a Korean film that focuses on a Korean and Japanese superstar with Jang Dong-gun and Jo Odagiri, this film is not about this country being better than each other.It's about two people who grew up with each other, circumstances led them to hate each other, nearly kill each other (multiple times) but during the War and both being away from their countries, their government and facing so much tragedy in their lifetime, the two become each other's greatest hope.And what's amazing about the film is how it captures humanity, the best and worst of it.  We see these men put into dire moments, fighting a losing battle against the Russians, being captured and forced to labor by the Russians and then serving in the Russian military to later be captured and forced to be part of the German military.It sounds so farfetched but because of historical records and the photo taken at Normandy by American soldiers, we know that it happened.But most importantly, what I liked about this film is that director and writer Kang Je-kyu didn't follow traditional Korean screenwriting.  Where most Asian films would always try to show a man fighting for his country against the savage Japanese Imperial Army, this film focuses on the humanity of two people who grew up with each other and somehow, would become important in each other's lives despite their differences.  The way the film ends was brilliant, touching and very ambitious, and typically when you use the word ambitious, most often these epic films tend to fail.  Not the case with ""My Way"", this film direction and screenplay was brilliant and easily accessible for viewers worldwide.Outside of Jang Dong-gun and Jo Odagiri, the film also stars Chinese superstar Bingbing Fan.  Fans's involvement is more or less to showcase how China and the women were victimized by the Japanese Imperial army but instead of showing a weak female character, Fan's character, Shirai, is an expert sniper.  And while her character is not utilized a lot through the film, she plays an important part of bringing back humanity and caring for one another, specifically for the character of Jun-shik Kim.It helps to bring realism by hiring Russian and German talent in the film and the film's efficacy also lies within its location shots, the cinematography and also research that went into weapons and tanks used during that era.The visual effects and the sense of all out chaos during war was well-executed and cinematographer Lee Mo-gae and editor Park Gok-ji is impressive throughout the film!  Aside from the Josh Groban-style ending theme, I enjoyed the film from beginning to end!The duration of the film is 143 minutes but not as bad as other war films that have gone near 3-4 hours.  In fact, because of the action and its captivating storyline, the film went rather quickly for me.As for the Blu-ray release, the picture and audio quality is fantastic!  This is probably the best looking Well Go USA Blu-ray I have seen so far and watching this film in HD really showcases a lot of detail and clarity and and the film's lossless soundtrack is quite immersive.  I wished there were longer special features but you do get two short ones and three trailers, so of the entire release, it's low point it is short on special features.But still, with an amazing film with awesome picture quality and lossless audio, it's hard to anything bad about this release!Overall, ""My Way"" is a must-see Korean film that captures the human spirit, to never give up hope and that even amidst the chaos of war, hope continues to thrive and persist.  Another amazing film directed and written by filmmaker Kang Je-kyu and wonderfully acted by Jang Dong-gun and Jo Odagiri. ""My Way"" on a Blu-ray is a must-own release for fans of Asian cinema.  Highly recommended!",5,"(4.5 stars) ""My Way"" is a must-see Korean film that captures the human spirit, to never give up hope!",1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,8116,"['Korea', 'common', 'watch',

Conflict soon arises when Tassuo holds Jun-Shik responsible for the death of his grandfather. With both trying out for the Olympics later on, Jun-Shik is forced into the Japanese Army to keep him out of the Olympics.

1537401,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B007S0DB56,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","While it doesn't have quite as cohesive a plot or reach the depths of characterization achieved in Kang's 2004 masterpiece,Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood Of War, the whole fascinating WWII odyssey of Jun-shik Kim makes ""My Way"" an exquisitely unique film. The irony of how the Korean Kim--ably played by Dong-gun Jang, who also starred in ""Tae Guk Gi""--is forced to labor, fight, and ultimately expected to die for a succession of three not-so-different nations, none of which are his own and none of which inspire any particular loyalty, is not lost here.Despite some abrupt transitions and a few unlikely details, the general cinematography is excellent and, particularly during the Siberian segment, includes some very arresting scenery. Without distractive moralizing, the film touches upon a number of different themes such as that of individuality over nationality and, most importantly of all, how the bitter enmity and competition between Kim and the aristocratic Japanese officer Tatsuo becomes a friendship when they are faced with using their common ability (running) to get home (another important motif in this film).Over the last three decades or so, the general movie-making trend has been to portray war as starkly and realistically as it can be shown on screen. ""My Way"" is dominated by scenes of men being blown apart and run over by tanks; in this regard, it outdoes any American effort such as ""Flags of Our Fathers"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" Thus, one of its biggest strengths could also be its biggest weakness: The pervasive battle footage is disturbing to the point where it's just plain hard to watch. .  . but isn't that how it should be?",4,Intense and Worth Seeing for the Strong of Stomach,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,1661,"[""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'cohesive', 'plot', 'reach', 'depths', 'characterization', 'achieved', 'Kang', '2004', 'masterpiece', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'Brotherhood', 'War', 'whole', 'fascinating', 'WWII', 'odyssey', 'Jun-shik', 'Kim', 'Way', 'exquisitely', 'unique', 'film', 'irony', 'how', 'Korean', 'Kim', 'ably', 'played', 'Dong-gun', 'Jang', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'forced', 'labor', 'fight', 'ultimately', 'expected', 'die', 'succession', 'three', 'not-so-different', 'nations', 'none', 'are', 'own', 'none', 'inspire', 'particular', 'loyalty', 'not', 'lost', 'here.Despite', 'abrupt', 'transitions', 'few', 'unlikely', 'details', 'general', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'Siberian', 'segment', 'very', 'arresting', 'scenery', 'distractive', 'moralizing', 'film', 'touches', 'number', 'different', 'themes', 'such', 'individuality', 'nationality', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'bitter', 'enmity', 'competition', 'Kim', 'aristocratic', 'Japanese', 'officer', 'Tatsuo', 'friendship', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'using', 'common', 'ability', 'running', 'get', 'home', 'important', 'motif', 'film', 'last', 'three', 'decades', 'so', 'general', 'movie-making', 'trend', 'been', 'portray', 'war', 'starkly', 'realistically', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'screen', 'Way', 'dominated', 'scenes', 'men', 'being', 'blown', 'apart', 'run', 'over', 'tanks', 'regard', 'American', 'effort', 'such', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Thus', 'one', 'biggest', 'strengths', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'pervasive', 'battle', 'footage', 'disturbing', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'plain', 'hard', 'watch', ""n't"", 'how', 'should', 'be']",My Way
1537402,AYG1U47VFZ165,B007S0DB56,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[63, 69]","South Koreans have a way with film.  In the last decade, they've had a particularly good run at presenting war stories, some from the World War II era and many others exploring the Korean War.  I've had the good fortune of seeing several of them - each one perhaps a bit better than the last - and now I can add MY WAY to the burgeoning list of accomplishments.  It's a big budget critical success that opens your eyes to the plight of people who find themselves equally at odds with themselves as they do the greater world around them.At a time when Japan ruled a smaller Korea, Kim Jung-shik (played by Jang Dong-Gun) and Japanese aristocrat Tatsuo Hasegawa (Joe Odagiri) find themselves as bitter young rivals to the upcoming Olympics.  When Kim and his fellow residents rebel against the Japanese authorities after stripping the young man of a chance to represent his country, they're all conscripted into the Japanese army.  Their fates collide again as Kim's regiment is assigned to Tatsuo, now serving his country as an officer.  When both are seized by the Soviets in a bloody battle, they'll slowly learn to trust one another again until they're separated by the invading German army.  Eventually, they're reunited at Normandy Beach, only days before the fateful invasion of the Allied Forces, when destinies collide in this epic story of survival.And it is a truly epic film.  MY WAY features some powerful performances by all of the principles as well as some fantastic filmmaking at work on all levels.  Director Je-kyu Kang has produced a masterpiece that explores personal conviction and redemption against the backdrop of the international stage.  War is arguably the most horrific form of conflict to explore stories of one's humanity, but the script (which he co-wrote with Byung-in Kim) gives everyone here the chance to explore who they are as individuals as well as members of a greater society.  Kim and Tatsuo end up drivers of their own cruel fates as they are victims of their time, always conscripted to serve some greater enemy.  Where others sell out their souls in order to secure momentary freedom, these two men remain tied to their own convictions - big or small, right or wrong - and they suffer the consequences of their own prejudices.  However, along the way, they manage to retain as much of their dignity as the circumstances allow, and they prove once again that even in the darkest of times there is some goodness to be found in the unlikeliest of friendships.As for the completed product?  The cinematography is breathtaking, at times, and heart-breaking at others.  It's the kind of visual mix reserved for blockbuster films, of which MY WAY definitely deserves to sit side by side.  The director clearly went to great lengths to capture these various terrains - the stark beauty of open fields, the harsh claustrophia of the Russian winters, the majestic swells on the beaches of Normandy - and adapt them to the message of each sequence, and it all looks solid and impactful.  The musical score is equally impressive though perhaps a bit derivative at times.MY WAY was produced by Directors, SK Planet, and CJ Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled through Well Go USA.  The disc looks and sounds exceptional - the picture is stunningly crisp, and the audio is a terrific mix for both the big and the smaller elements.  As is often the case with some of these foreign releases finding distribution in the US, there aren't tons and tons of special features, but, thankfully, MY WAY has a solid few: there's a `making of' featurette along with some behind-the-scenes material, cast interviews, and a director interview.  Also, there's an English-dubbed track which I found helpful given the fact that there are sequences of some rapid-fire dialogue that just doesn't give this ol' pair of eyes enough time to read all of it.  It clocks in at an impressive 143 minutes, but you wouldn't know it; it never felt overlong or overwrought in the slightest, as the focus retains a personal edge throughout.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  MY WAY continues to string of terrific war-related films out of Korea.  Culturally, their artists have latched on to a winning, compelling formula of delivering tales of great conflict alongside some tragic and triumphant personal narratives.  Granted, there were a few sequences - one tinged with fairly predictable character-based humor - that `cheapened' a few moments, but they're very, very small (and completely forgivable) when compared to the epic scope of the picture.  MY WAY walks that line with excellent balance - it's as frightening as it is inspiring - and it's easy to see why the NYC Movie Guru dubbed it the ""most powerful war film since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.""In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at Well Go USA provided me with a DVD screener copy of MY WAY by request for the expressed purposes of completing this

1537414,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B007S0DB56,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[1, 2]","My Way is a war film by the phenomenal director Kang Je-gyu. The story follows rival marathon runners Jun-Shik, Korean, and Tatsuo, Japanese, from their heated races as kids and young men to the chaotic battles of World War 2; they learn a lot about themselves and each other as they fight for the Japanese Army and become prisoners of war. The story is a lot deeper, but for the sake of keeping this short and sweet, and to avoid spoilers, I'll leave it at that.As I previously stated, My Way focuses on two main characters and develops them and their relationship with great detail. The main actors and the supporting cast were amazing in this film; you can really feel their pain as you hear their agonizing cries and witness their pleas to stay alive, especially in the Prisoner of War camps. The story is deep and works very well. The war sequences are also stunning; there are very large scale battles, including suicide bombings to stop tanks and an epic battle at Normandy. These battles are also very violent and realistic, a lot of stabbings and soldiers graphically get ran over by tanks. The action and drama are balanced, so it's not one big action film. Also, I thought the music was amazing and had a triumphant/epic feel; it matches the film perfectly. It's also shot beautifully. The ending was unexpected and very powerful. The story is inspired by a true story that I've never heard or seen, so it was also very informative.My Way perfectly blends action and drama to create an amazing war film. With brilliant acting, superb music, amazing direction, and a stunning depiction of war, this film is highly recommended. As of 9/22/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended as well.This film has very strong violence and gore, including intense war sequences.

1537420,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B007S0DB56,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this powerful and original South Korean film and I am happy that I bought it - in fact, even if it has some small weaknesses, I liked it more than the renowned ""Brotherhood"". Below, you will find some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This is a work of fiction, but it is remotely based on a true story. During the battle of Normandy in June-August 1944 allied armies captured in France numerous soldiers from so called Osttruppen of Wehrmacht. Those units were composed of conscripts and volunteers from occupied territories in Soviet Union and also from volunteers recruited amongst Soviet prisoners of war. A total of at least 98 Ost battallions were raised (that total doesn't include neither the Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Belarussian, Cossack and Ukrainian formations nor the early Russian ""Hiwi"" volunteers and the later created Russian Vlassov Army).Amongst those captured were at least four Asians from Far East with whom nobody was able to communicate, as they only knew a couple of words in German. One of those men was Yang Kyoungjong, a young Korean who, as his country was under Japanese occupation, was forced in 1938 to serve in Japanese Army. He was then taken prisoner by Soviets during the bloody - and quite important for world history - war waged by Soviet Union and its Mongol vassal against Japan and its own Manchukuo puppet state between 11 May and 16 September 1939 (this war is known as Nomonhan Campaign in Japan and in West and as Khalkhyn Gol Battle in Russia).As all Japanese, Korean and Manchu prisoners he was send to a concentration camp in Siberia where he managed to survive the hard labor and all kinds of privations until autumn 1942. He was then, as hundreds of thousands other inmates of all nationalities, pressed in service in Soviet Army and send to fight against Wehrmacht. In March 1943 he was again captured (possibly after deserting), this time by Germans, during the Third Battle of Kharkov (last major German victory on Eastern Front during WWII). He was then again pressed in armed service, this time in one of battalions of Osttruppen. Once formed, his unit was ultimately not send to fight against Soviets, but to garrison the Atlantic Wall in Normandy. It was there than he was captured for the third time, by US Army - once identified as Korean he was not send back to Soviet Union after war but allowed to imigrate to United States, where he lived peacefully until his death in 1992.Now this film DOESN'T tell Yang Kyoungjong story. The main hero of this film is named Kim Jun-shik and his story, although inspired by the one described above, is also GREATLY DIFFERENT in many aspects. But of this I will say no more - you will have to discover it your self.This is a very powerful, brutal, bloody, dramatic and cruel story. At a risk of being taken for a male shauvinist pig, I would even risk here an opinion that this is really a film for men, to watch amongst guys, with some good beer (but NOT popcorn - this is not this kind of movie) and rather in silence, both to fully enjoy it and to show some respect for all human misery and suffering pictured...Now, granted, this film has some small weaknesses, which actually made me smile by moments (but briefly). To cite some of them, let's just say that no matter how good a shot a soldier is, it was never possible to INSTANTLY destroy a Polikarpov I-16 fighter (quite well made CGI by the way) with ONE single rifle-shot...))) Also, at Nomonhan battle, Soviet tanks ALWAYS charge without any infantry present, when in reality Soviet ""tank-riders"" (infantrymen riding on tanks) were a great Red Army speciality.But possibly the funniest moment is during one of battles on Eastern front. Probably just to make things clearer for the Asian viewer director decided to decorate German positions in a ruined town by a great number of absolutely ENORMOUS Nazi flags, the kind of which were used during those massive Nazi ""Reichsparteitags"", like the one filmed by Leni Riefenstahl in 1934 in Nuremberg. OK, it is not really a deadly sin, but it made this otherwise horrible battle scene unwillingly very funny.There is also one moment when in 1943 the hero wanders through a frozen desolation, after his Soviet unit was destroyed. Well, he travels through some incredibly gigantic mountains - which are notoriously absent from Russian, Belarussian and Ukrainian flatlands...))) The only mountainous places in Soviet Union which were concerned by the fighting during World War II were the Caucasus, which Germans had to evacuate at the end of 1942 as well as Crimea and Carpathian mountains, which both were reached by Soviet Army only in summer 1944...Finally, it was real fun to see Iowa-class battleships shelling Normandy in 1944 considering that all four were in this time fighting in the Pacific (but the footage of those ships firing broadsides is freely available in public domain...) as well as seeing hundreds of B-17s bombing in full day from such a low attitude, that they could be engaged not only by light 20 mm Flak pieces, but even by machine gun and RIFLE(!) fire. Such a thing NEVER happened in Normandy as 1) there was never need for such an action and 2) the losses thus suffered would be crippling - as it was well shown in ONE such event, in 1943, during the (in)famous Ploesti raid, when American B-24 Liberators had to bomb a target in Romania completely surrounded by high hills and therefore exposed themselves to full firepower of EVERYTHING (including not only the 20 mm Flak guns but even MG08 and MG34 7,92 mm machine guns) that could shoot at them from the summits of hills...But all those things are very minor points, noticable only for military history freaks like me and my kind. This film is an excellent, brilliant, very moving and beautifully filmed thing, with actors giving everything they had in them and what they could borrow. I liked this film very much and I am going to keep it preciously for a possible future viewing. Warmly recommended, albeit mostly for male public. I can not really wish you to enjoy it, as it is a very brutal and violent thing - but I think you will not regret buying and watching it!",5,"Under three totalitarian regimes, in three different

1537422,AIO0Y6M8CLEKF,B007S0DB56,MarkoSion,"[1, 6]","""My Way"" is another epic blockbuster by director Kang Jae-gyu which focuses on the relationship between two men of colliding cultures in a hotbed of war and national grudges.  Kim Jun-shik, played by Jang Dong-gun, challenges his new childhood friend, Tatsuo, played by Joe Odagiri, to a race.  They meet during the controversial and repressive era in which the Empire of Japan occupied Korea for a few decades (1910-1945).  The premise of the story, it seems, builds on this foundation for their joy for long-distance races and their rivalry.  After a positive, feel-good montage showing them going back and forth winning races, the climax comes when Tatsuo controversially wins a major race based on allegations that Jun-shik cheated. A riot ensues, started by the Koreans, and Jun-shik and some friends end up forcibly drafted into the Imperial Japanese army as punishment.  Tatsuo enters the story again as a military colonel, who then runs into his old rival in the same unit.  As the movie carries into several changes of scenery based on the shifts of battle lines, Tatsuo and Jun-shik come to an understanding of friendship and survival, which even brings them across the fields of Europe to the Western Front of WWII.Again, the idea for the movie about racing comes across as heart-warming, but the execution of the film is at times very messy and the pacing of the story, especially the angst of conflict between certain characters, can be overwhelming and unnecessary.  I felt like I couldn't get a grasp of what storyline the director wanted me to follow:  the marathons, the war, or the grudges between Tatsuo and Jun-shik that turns into a surprising friendship.  Kang Jae-gyu definitely brings back his forte and pallet of directorial skills from his earlier hit Korean War movie, Taegukgi, while trying to keep the sentimental value rolled in.  The war scenes are well done, done with a sense of chaos and well-placed shots, and this time the audience doesn't get a 'pro-(insert nation)' feeling, its just random battles with soldiers dying in a senseless manner.  Yet one of the major flaws of this film is that the director focuses so much on the battles that characterization and plot are left to be desired.  There is a large chunk of the film in which it is dedicated to straight up violence and personal conflict.  There are several consecutive scenes of fist-fights and brawls between certain characters at random times, which becomes annoying because you get this ""I've seen this before.""  Even more randomly, a female character is inserted, and you're left wondering is that Jun-shik's love interest?  You're not quite sure.Then, out of the blue, there are shots of Jun-shik racing around an army or prison camp.  ""Ooops,"" it feels like the director wanted to remind you that he's a marathoner, ""don't forget that folks.""  Its like the director is playing catch-up with elements he forgot to add in.War films can be tricky to direct because there has to be a fine balance of understanding the motivations of your main players while showing the chaos of war.  Director Kang shifts to highly choreographed war scenes which you come to watch a long war re-enactment.  There are death scenes that are stereotypical where the characters spurt out a heroic dialog with blood spewing everywhere, and the brawls occur over, and over, and over again.  In comparison, a film like ""The Frontline"" (with Ko Soo and Shin Ha-kyun), balance well the senselessness of war while making you attached to the characters.In the end, the only positives of the film is that you do get a sense of the historical grudge between the Japanese and Koreans during this era and the war is portrayed very well.  But the story catches up way too late to make the whole premise, of racing and friendship through battles, to make it a fine finish.

Where My way deviates is in the details, and there are great liberties taken with facts.Every character is mostly well thought out, the director having fleshed out the characters fairly well. While the discovery of a conscripted Korean in the service of the Werhmacht is true as well as amazing, Yang Kyoungjong,  (the real name of the Korean impressed into service by the Japanese, Russians, and eventually the Germans) is elevated by the film maker to an Olympic contender- the story line of Olympics, while real (  Sohn Kee-chung (gold) and Nam Sung-yong (bronze) in the 1936 Olympics in Nazi-era Berlin , and Korea placed far down on the roster in the 1948 London Olympics)this has been muddled into the plot of My Way. They do follow Yang's history line of where he fought and captured fairly closely.In terms of the military aspects of this movie, the film makers did an excellent effort at realistic content. However, sharp-eyed observers will no doubt be squirming when they see BB63, the Missouri and several other Iowa class Battleships giving support fire in Normandy ( all of these class battleships were in the Pacific).

The film starts with their childhoods and marathon competitions. Jun-shik Kim (Dong-gun Jang) is a poor Korean who trains by being a ricksha driver. He is our likeable Rocky underdog. He runs against a privileged Japanese man,  Tatsuo Hasegawa (J Odagiri). Through circumstance the two end up together fighting in the same Japanese unit in China. Kim is a lowly private, who is considered fodder while Tatsuo is a complex character driven by his nationalistic teachings which he must overcome in order to survive.What the movie shows us is that the Chinese, Koreans, and Russians have no love for each other, but can find unity in their hatred of the Japanese. It is a lesson in being careful how you treat people on the way up because you meet them on the way down. I loved the cinematography.

What I love about it is that it shows that people on both sides were loosing their minds on both sides and the battle so stay sane was just as hard as the battle to stay alive.  (Spoiler)  This movie is based on true events so what amazes me is that they want from Axis to Allied and then back to Axis and still lived and then back to Allied at Normandy and one died.

1537436,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B007S0DB56,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[12, 12]","This is the sort of film the word `epic' was coined for. It is a Korean World War II film that takes in China, Russia and Europe as its scenes for some really well done battles. It is based on `true events', and I suspected a lot of licence has been taken but have since found out that this is based on the life of a Korean captured by the Americans on D Day in a Wermacht uniform - Yang Kyougjong.The film is the story of two men Jun-Shik (Dong-gun Jang `Brotherhood') and Tassuo  (jo Odagiri - `Shinobi'), the former is Korean and the latter Japanese. They are both keen runners and an early rivalry starts between them as children when Tatsuo's family move to the now conquered Korea to bring the Imperial Army jackboot down on the populace. An enmity soon grows between the two which is worsened by Japans decision to not allow Koreans to do the try outs for the Olympics.As a result of the ensuing unrest many Koreans and press ganged or sentenced to fight in the Imperial Army, this happens to Jun-Shik and many of his friends, they are sent to China to further the war that has been raging there since 1937.  They have to face Russian tanks with swords drawn and strap bombs to themselves as suicide attacks and it all kicks off. Hopelessly out numbered and out gunned they are taken prisoners of the Russians. This now begins the story of bitter struggle in the camps and the ensuing journey across Europe. To say any more would be a plot spoiler, but having said that there is rather a lot of plot so please don't think I have revealed too much already.There are some great battle scenes and the action is all excellent as is the period detail and the languages are all authentic too, including Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, German and English; so this is obviously sub titled. There is rather a lot of CGI and it is all on the above average side, but considering the scope and ambition of this film, they could not have done it any other way.This is from `Brotherhood' director Kang Je - Kyu who has taken seven years off but made this in ten months, I just hope he doesn't need such a break this time. For location fans this was actually shot in Latvia, but I did not feel this lacked authenticity. Whilst this is unashamedly emotional as most Korean cinema is, it is still brimming with action and no on screen time is wasted, it is an edge of seat marathon with a run time of 2 hours and eighteen minutes, you get a 40 minute `making of' as an extra too. If you are a fan of the ever growing catalogue of Korean action films, then this is one you will want to add to your collection - unmissable.",5,"Korean, Fact Based, Action Fest and it's got Nazi's!",1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,2607,"['sort', 'film', 'word', 'epic', 'was', 'coined', 'Korean', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'China', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'scenes', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'battles', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'suspected', 'lot', 'licence', 'been', 'taken', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'based', 'life', 'Korean', 'captured', 'Americans', 'D', 'Day', 'Wermacht', 'uniform', 'Yang', 'Kyougjong.The', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'Jun-Shik', 'Dong-gun', 'Jang', 'Brotherhood', 'Tassuo', 'jo', 'Odagiri', 'Shinobi', 'former', 'Korean', 'latter', 'Japanese', 'are', 'keen', 'runners', 'early', 'rivalry', 'starts', 'children', 'when', 'Tatsuo', 'family', 'move', 'now', 'conquered', 'Korea', 'bring', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'jackboot', 'down', 'populace', 'enmity', 'soon', 'two', 'worsened', 'Japans', 'decision', 'not', 'allow', 'Koreans', 'do', 'try', 'Olympics.As', 'result', 'ensuing', 'unrest', 'many', 'Koreans', 'press', 'ganged', 'sentenced', 'fight', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'Jun-Shik', 'many', 'friends', 'are', 'sent', 'China', 'further', 'war', 'been', 'raging', 'there', '1937', 'have', 'face', 'Russian', 'tanks', 'swords', 'drawn', 'strap', 'bombs', 'suicide', 'attacks', 'off', 'Hopelessly', 'numbered', 'out', 'gunned', 'are', 'taken', 'prisoners', 'Russians', 'now', 'story', 'bitter', 'struggle', 'camps', 'ensuing', 'journey', 'Europe', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'having', 'said', 'rather', 'lot', 'plot', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'revealed', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'great', 'battle', 'scenes', 'action', 'excellent', 'period', 'detail', 'languages', 'are', 'authentic', 'too', 'including', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Mandarin', 'German', 'English', 'so', 'obviously', 'sub', 'titled', 'rather', 'lot', 'CGI', 'above', 'average', 'side', 'considering', 'scope', 'ambition', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'way.This', 'Brotherhood', 'director', 'Kang', 'Je', 'Kyu', 'who', 'taken', 'seven', 'years', 'made', 'ten', 'months', 'just', 'hope', ""n't"", 'need', 'such', 'break', 'time', 'location', 'fans', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Latvia', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'lacked', 'authenticity', 'Whilst', 'unashamedly', 'emotional', 'most', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'still', 'brimming', 'action', 'screen', 'time', 'wasted', 'edge', 'seat', 'marathon', 'run', 'time', '2', 'hours', 'eighteen', 'minutes', 'get', '40', 'minute', 'making', 'extra', 'too', 'are', 'fan', 'ever', 'growing', 'catalogue', 'Korean', 'action', 'films', 'then', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'collection', 'unmissable']",My Way
1537437,A3373I4II32NA1,B007S0DB56,Tyler,"[1, 1]","I had read long ago about a few Asians being conscripted into the German army just in time to see plenty of action at Normandy, but I never imagined a movie would be made about two of them in particular!This movie is very battle-packed! It shows a Korean man named Jun-shik who dreams about being able to go to the Olympics, but Japan won't allow any representatives from a country that they have annexed many years earlier and the man is cheated out of his chance when he wins the tryouts and Japanese judges instead claim the winner to be Japan's representative, a man named Tatsuo who Jun-shik had competed with quite a few times since childhood and are rivals.The results of the judgment force Jun-shik and several of his friends into conscription as lowly soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army. Koreans serving as soldiers for the emperor are looked down upon as even worse than a Japanese private. Jun-shik finds this out the hard way up into the summer of 1939 when they are fighting Russian troops over a border dispute in the regions of Mongolia, the war of which is mostly unknown to most people today and only lasted a couple of months. The present colonel of Jun-shik's unit is punished for allowing his regiment to fall back in a bloody battle and is demoted to private and forced to kill himself to regain his honor. The new colonel is...VOILA!!! Tatsuo himself, the one and only!Tatsuo regards Jun-shik with resentment from the start and tries to have him imprisoned for execution when Jun-shik objects to being part of a suicide unit to battle Russian tanks in the next battle. The Korean finds himself lucky when he is rescued before the scheduled dawn execution by members of his own squad. They go to escape but run into the assault force of at least  a hundred incoming Russian tanks. Jun-shik goes to warn the other members of the regiment about this attack but cannot prevent the bloodshed that follows. The battle scenes in here were excellent. You see Japanese troops take on Russian tanks by ramming trucks right into them. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers die in this battle and just when it seems like the Russian tank force cannot withstand this brutal assault of Japanese infantry, they are reinforced by more Russian tanks. Despite Tatsuo's exclamations to not fall back and to die for the emperor, he and Jun-shik are taken prisoner in the end, which is rare since Japanese troops regarded POW status as dishonorable and thousands of Japanese(and who knows how many Koreans)would rather kill themselves than be taken prisoner.Both men, and many others, including the members of Jun-shik's squad, are then suffering for what seems to be an eternity in a freezing Soviet labor camp. Tatsuo is bitter and gets constantly punished when he defies Russian authority by refusing to deface his nation's flag, but he seems to hate Jun-shik all the more, with a scene where they are supposed to fight to the death. The two are about to meet their fate in front of a firing squad when news comes at the last second that Germany has invaded Russia. They are then conscripted into the Russian army to fight the Germans, fighting their first battle for them in December, 1941. The conscripts are little more than cannon fodder to be served to the Germans and their machine guns. It seems like the entire Russian unit of conscripts is wiped out in that battle, with Jun-shik and Tatsuo as the only survivors. It seems like the former Japanese colonel has started to warm up to this Korean because they leave together for German lines and Tatsuo has his life saved by Jun-shik right before advancing German infantry split them up.In May, 1944, Tatsuo is reunited with Jun-shik at Normandy, France, following up towards the Allied invasion of France, and both men wearing German army uniforms. This is when the men regard each other as friends, and they go through quite the struggle to survive together when the American troops hit the beaches under an intensive bombardment by Allied aircraft and warships alike.Do they survive? Well, you'll just have to see the movie!
