However, you'll also see how Tornado Sacks replaced Captain Murphy as Murphy apparently went off to fight in the Great Spice Wars. In real life, the guy who did the voice of Murphy died due to a terminal, rare form of cancer oddly enough according to the special features of Season 2 (not on either disc for Season 3).In Disc 2, you'll see rapping Hesh become ""The One,"" at another one of Debbie's weddings with an alternate version in the special features, Stormy's humerously ignorant rants about politics (in Special Features) and...that's about it for the good stuff on Disc 2.The biggest thing wrong with Season 3 is an overall lack of Captain Murphy. Even though the voice actor for Murphy died in real life, the replacement character just doesn't seem to stack up to Murphy's wackiness. Tornado Sacks (again, replaces Murphy), is a southner meant to be the typically un-realistic, loveable idiot that only exists way too often in Hollywood productions. Tornado is more of a typical and mediocore character than he is a funny one and Tornado's stereotypical, cowboy foolishness just ends up being a poor substitute for Murphy's oblivous and yet totally hilarious insanity. There just always seems to be something missing when Murphy disappears after Episode 4.Dispite an overall lack of Murphy and the average Tornado, many of the episodes of Season 3 still have a lot crazy plots with tons of chaos going on that seem satisfying enough for me to say that Season 3 was just a descent season for SeaLab 2021. Season 1 and 2 were better, but I'd say 3 is just worthy enough to add to the collection.",3,"Season 3 is descent, but a little lacking...",1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,1816,"['Disc', '1', 'get', 'see', 'cannibals', 'Murphy', 'turning', 'Bar-Bo-Bot', 'robot', 'Murphy', 'turning', 'mad', 'dictator', 'snobby', 'actor', 'Beck', 'Bristo', 'being', 'jerk', 'crew', 'several', 'nuclear', 'deformities', 'explosions', 'However', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'how', 'Tornado', 'Sacks', 'replaced', 'Captain', 'Murphy', 'Murphy', 'apparently', 'went', 'fight', 'Great', 'Spice', 'Wars', 'real', 'life', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'voice', 'Murphy', 'died', 'due', 'terminal', 'rare', 'form', 'cancer', 'oddly', 'enough', 'according', 'special', 'features', 'Season', '2', 'not', 'disc', 'Season', '3', '.In', 'Disc', '2', ""'ll"", 'see', 'rapping', 'Hesh', 'become', 'One', 'one', 'Debbie', 'weddings', 'alternate', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'Stormy', 'humerously', 'ignorant', 'rants', 'politics', 'Special', 'Features', 'good', 'stuff', 'Disc', '2.The', 'biggest', 'thing', 'wrong', 'Season', '3', 'overall', 'lack', 'Captain', 'Murphy', 'Even', 'voice', 'actor', 'Murphy', 'died', 'real', 'life', 'replacement', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stack', 'up', 'Murphy', 'wackiness', 'Tornado', 'Sacks', 'again', 'replaces', 'Murphy', 'southner', 'meant', 'be', 'typically', 'un-realistic', 'loveable', 'idiot', 'only', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'Tornado', 'more', 'typical', 'mediocore', 'character', 'funny', 'one', 'Tornado', 'stereotypical', 'cowboy', 'foolishness', 'just', 'up', 'being', 'poor', 'substitute', 'Murphy', 'oblivous', 'yet', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'insanity', 'just', 'always', 'be', 'something', 'missing', 'when', 'Murphy', 'Episode', '4.Dispite', 'overall', 'lack', 'Murphy', 'average', 'Tornado', 'many', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'still', 'have', 'lot', 'crazy', 'plots', 'tons', 'chaos', 'going', 'seem', 'satisfying', 'enough', 'say', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'just', 'descent', 'season', 'SeaLab', '2021', 'Season', '1', '2', 'were', 'better', ""'d"", 'say', '3', 'just', 'worthy', 'enough', 'add', 'collection']",Sealab 2021 - Season 3

If not then I'd say give season 2 a try (most consistent to me- I found some of season one to be so intent on being absurd that they failed to be funny!).

902552,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00097DY2U,General Zombie,"[23, 27]","This is the last 'Sealab 2021' season that's gonna be worth owning.  This is where it started to crash, with a general dip in quality, and one really rather questionable episode. (Dearly Beloved Seed)  But, overall it's still damn good, and has a few truly great episodes. (Though not quite the funniest episode of the show, 'Red Dawn' is probably my favorite episode.  In fact, each of the episodes where Murphy is still around ranges from very good to excellent)  Course, the show really had no hope of maintaining itself with Murphy gone.  It's not that there is anything inherently wrong with Shanks; I think he's pretty funny. (And much of the time, he might as well be Murphy, other than the voice-acting, which proves to be a huge difference.)  But Murphy was always the heart of the show and the funniest character, so you can't expect it to hold up with out him.  Course, it turns out that Goz's death isn't the only problem.  The writing totally went to hell after this season.  Not everything made after this is completely worthless, but it's been weak enough that I never really bothered to watch it consistently.  But, that's the next season, and Season 3 is still really cool.Also, the packaging for this season is really neat, and seems to be a lot more solid and durable than the other ones.",4,The End of Sealab,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,1307,"['last', ""'Sealab"", '2021', 'season', 'gon', 'be', 'worth', 'owning', 'where', 'started', 'crash', 'general', 'dip', 'quality', 'one', 'really', 'rather', 'questionable', 'episode', 'Dearly', 'Beloved', 'Seed', 'overall', 'still', 'damn', 'good', 'few', 'truly', 'great', 'episodes', 'not', 'funniest', 'episode', 'show', 'Dawn', 'probably', 'favorite', 'episode', 'fact', 'episodes', 'where', 'Murphy', 'still', 'ranges', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'Course', 'show', 'really', 'had', 'hope', 'maintaining', 'Murphy', 'gone', 'not', 'anything', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'Shanks', 'think', 'pretty', 'funny', 'much', 'time', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'Murphy', 'other', 'voice-acting', 'be', 'huge', 'difference', 'Murphy', 'was', 'always', 'heart', 'show', 'funniest', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hold', 'up', 'out', 'Course', 'out', 'Goz', 'death', ""n't"", 'only', 'problem', 'writing', 'totally', 'went', 'hell', 'season', 'Not', 'everything', 'made', 'completely', 'worthless', 'been', 'weak', 'enough', 'never', 'really', 'bothered', 'watch', 'consistently', 'next', 'season', 'Season', '3', 'still', 'really', 'cool.Also', 'packaging', 'season', 'really', 'neat', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'solid', 'durable', 'other', 'ones']",Sealab 2021 - Season 3

Murphy was the funniest character on the show, and made the show! His episodes are hilarious, including to 4 or so on this set. The best are the ones where he becomes a Commie, and where he becomes a Barbeaubot.Shanks Era:Funny, but lost a bit of its impact. Some funny episodes, but Shanks was mostly a hit or miss character. There are funny moments, but no where near as great as Murphy.Extras:As on every disc of Sealab, the extras are pretty bad. Yeah, there are 2 unused episodes, one of which has bad sound, and the other isn't animated. The Kitty FunFun shorts suck, I didn't really find ""Stormy Waters, Pundit"" any funny as well. The commentaries are meh, so the extras are all right.Bottom Line:This show is hilarious and in some episodes, brilliant. The pure quality of the shows are worth the set, but if I were to own one Sealab set, it would be Season 2, which has some pretty good extras. But don't buy it for the extras.

902556,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00097DY2U,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[17, 18]","The third season of Sealab 2021 was a bittersweet one to say the least.  Harry Goz, voice of the hilariously maniacal Captain Murphy, died after lending his voice for the first four episodes, and his son Michael eventually took his place as Captain Tornado Shanks.  Many Sealab viewers believe that Shanks' arrival signaled the downfall of the series, but this is quite untrue.  ""Chalkboard Jungle"", in which Shanks assists Quinn in substituting Debbie Love's class, wouldn't work the same without him, while ""Dearly Beloved Seed"" is possibly the most off the wall episode of Sealab ever.  ""Red Dawn"", in which Captain Murphy introduces a Communist regime to Sealab and he wages war with JFK, must be seen to be believed.  Yes, this was the beginning of the series going downhill writing wise, but for die hard Adult Swim viewers who immensely enjoyed Sealab 2021, the fact that these are Harry Goz's final vocal performances are reason enough to own this alone.  The special features are once again dismal, this time there are no commentaries (even though I really wouldn't consider the commentaries on Season two worth hearing), and a few extra episodes, including the original version of ""Dearly Beloved Seed"" and some unaired material.",5,Bittersweet,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,1239,"['third', 'season', 'Sealab', '2021', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'one', 'say', 'least', 'Harry', 'Goz', 'voice', 'hilariously', 'maniacal', 'Captain', 'Murphy', 'died', 'lending', 'voice', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'son', 'Michael', 'eventually', 'took', 'place', 'Captain', 'Tornado', 'Shanks', 'Many', 'Sealab', 'viewers', 'believe', 'Shanks', 'arrival', 'signaled', 'downfall', 'series', 'quite', 'untrue', 'Chalkboard', 'Jungle', 'Shanks', 'Quinn', 'substituting', 'Debbie', 'Love', 'class', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'same', 'Dearly', 'Beloved', 'Seed', 'possibly', 'most', 'wall', 'episode', 'Sealab', 'ever', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'Captain', 'Murphy', 'Communist', 'regime', 'Sealab', 'war', 'JFK', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Yes', 'was', 'beginning', 'series', 'going', 'downhill', 'writing', 'wise', 'die', 'hard', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'viewers', 'who', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'Sealab', '2021', 'fact', 'are', 'Harry', 'Goz', 'final', 'vocal', 'performances', 'are', 'reason', 'enough', 'own', 'alone', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'dismal', 'time', 'are', 'commentaries', 'even', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'commentaries', 'Season', 'two', 'worth', 'hearing', 'few', 'extra', 'episodes', 'including', 'original', 'version', 'Dearly', 'Beloved', 'Seed', 'unaired', 'material']",Sealab 2021 - Season 3

The first of the newer shows with the new Captain Shanks character (voiced by Harry Goz's son, Michael Goz) are also very funny, although it is clear in some places that the writers had as much trouble adjusting to the changes they were forced to make as the fans. As most fans know, episodes after the ones in this set take a serious down-turn in writing quality, so much so that it is hard to believe they were produced by the same people. So, if you found the early Sealab 2021 absolutely hilarious, be sure to buy this set because it contains the last of the comedy gems in the series. There are extras on this set, including two unaired episodes and some commentary, although the extras tend to be hit or miss in quality as in previous sets depending on your taste.
