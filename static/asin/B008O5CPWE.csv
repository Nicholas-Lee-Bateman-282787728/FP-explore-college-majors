I initially watched it because of Micky from the Super K-POP Group DBSK/TVXQ but I have to tell you I fell in love with it and couldn't stop watching it. It had everything in it, suspense, love, comedy, and sadness. It was a rollercoaster ride worth watching. As a HUGE fan of K-POP music, I'm excited to see Micky continue in the field of acting. He does it well. The leading lady and the supporting actors/actress were just as good in their role. I wasn't too crazy about the ending but I would watch it again. I'm now watching Micky in ""I Miss You"" on Dramafever.

1572182,A22KG0EAUW6U7I,B008O5CPWE,Lost Wanderer,"[1, 1]","Rooftop Prince is another SBS (TV network) drama that successfully mixes fantasy and adds enjoyable twists into otherwise rather mundane drama, as do ""Secret Garden"" and ""My Girlfriend is Kumiho"".The story is just too contrived. The pieces are forced too much to fit together and there are too many ""why would anybody do that?"" and ""that is just asinine"". The characters lack depth also. Bad guys are all cookie-cutter bad guys who seemingly want just money at the cost of everything else, and good guys are all innocent angels. However the killer conclusion that is equally moving and satisfying makes you forget a lot of those flaws, and it will bring tears to the eyes of even the hardest man.",4,Blast from the past,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,696,"['Rooftop', 'Prince', 'SBS', 'TV', 'network', 'drama', 'successfully', 'mixes', 'fantasy', 'enjoyable', 'twists', 'otherwise', 'rather', 'mundane', 'drama', 'do', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Girlfriend', 'Kumiho', '.The', 'story', 'just', 'too', 'contrived', 'pieces', 'are', 'forced', 'too', 'much', 'fit', 'together', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'why', 'would', 'anybody', 'do', 'just', 'asinine', 'characters', 'lack', 'depth', 'also', 'Bad', 'guys', 'are', 'cookie-cutter', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'seemingly', 'want', 'just', 'money', 'cost', 'everything', 'else', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'innocent', 'angels', 'However', 'killer', 'conclusion', 'equally', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'forget', 'lot', 'flaws', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'even', 'hardest', 'man']",N/A
1572183,A3L4DIB3CUWTII,B008O5CPWE,LoveBug,"[0, 0]","Young prince Lee Gak is from the Joseon era and looking for a wife. Hwa Yong and Boo Young are sisters and were both considered to be the princess. Boo Young is chosen, but the night before their wedding Hwa Yong leaves an ugly burn mark on her sister's face, scarring her for life. No longer able to marry the prince, her sister eagerly takes her place.Years later, Boo Young helps her sister sew and do other tasks that the prince thinks his wife is doing. Although the prince adores his wife, he can hold an intelligent conversation better with Boo Young. But since his sister-in-law covers the burn mark with a handkerchief, he has only ever seen her eyes. Boo Young quietly loves the prince from the sidelines while her sister keeps up her fake endearing image in front of the prince. But one night the crown princess is murdered and Lee Gak is devastated and devises a team of three men with different unique talents to help catch her killer. But during the hunt, he and his men mysteriously time-travel to present day Korea.In modern day Korea, the men are thrust into a strange, overwhelming, and confusing new world. The rooftop home they land on belongs to a spunky, straight-forward woman, Park Ha, that they later find out is the prince's sister-in-law's reincarnation. To his surprise, he also finds a woman that looks exactly like his wife. In order to return to the past though and catch her killer, he assumes he must marry her reincarnation. While doing what he can to marry her, he finds out that his reincarnation was murdered. Or was he? As he tries to solve the reasons to why he time-traveled, he and Park Ha are falling in love. Will the prince and his sister-in-law's reincarnation be able to find love in this lifetime? Or will tragedy strike again and tear them apart?This is such a great and entertaining romantic comedy. It's even better than I was expecting. It has lots of laugh-out-loud comedy, especially when the prince and his men are exploring modern day Korea. It's also heartfelt, romantic, and even has some action. This drama has so many likable characters and a fantastic story with lots of twists and turns. There is so much going on in the story that I couldn't fit it all in this review. It also has great music. I have the music on my iPod. This drama has a star-studded cast which includes; Micky Yoochun, Han Ji Min, Lee Tae Sung, Jung Yoo Mi, Kim So Hyun, and few more.
