Most story elements made no sense at all, requiring a much larger suspension of disbelief than I could handle; none of the children had any recollection of being harmed by Freddy as kids, none of the kids remembered going to the same elementary school together, and the parents--with no proof save their children's' claims--hunt down and burn Freddy to death. Even for a slasher film this is too poorly and lazily constructed to be ignored. (Of course, at the climax Freddy leads the kids to proof positive that he did in fact harm them as kids. Yea, never saw that coming.)As for the good? Haley's make up is excellent. Freddy actually looks like a burn victim this time, I suppose to please all of those someones who were bothered that a character from a dream didn't look realistic in the old series. Haley didn't really get much of a chance to be affective as Freddy unfortunately because, the other problem with this film, the ""scares"" are so predictable and bland. I saw most of them coming a mile off. The direction is very bland and workman like--killed almost all of his scenes. (He really tried hard too. Was OK at times, mostly in the beginning.) The CGI effects were another killer--too obvious. (The ending best illustrated this. You know it's coming because your expecting it to follow the composition of the original, but thanks to the CGI the scene was a dead dog. CGI just looks too clean and too perfect and well, not real.)

The cast looked to be in their 30's afterall. But no, they are supposed to be teenagers. After a little research I realized I was about 5 years off, most of the ""teenage"" cast were around 25. They just looked 30. Somehow.Speaking of those ""teenagers"", they all have roughly the same personality. That is, none. I'm not a fan of picking on actors that are given nothing to work with so, on to the screenplay.There wasn't one. It seems they just cobbled together a hybrid of the various sequels from the past and then drained out all life, imagination, heart, and...well everything good. This movie does not bother to set up anything, it just starts  in the middle of things without bothering to give us any sense of place or time. Because of this the film feels sort of like a dream in itself, that some person we never see might be having. Some really boring person.Freddy. Hmm. He looks sort of like someone set Tom Waits on fire in this film. Which would be sort of neat except Freddy is given no more personality than any of the rest of the cast. They claimed they were going for ""the dark version"" of Freddy from the first film...but he's still tossing off one-liners here like he did in some of the original sequels. Except they have no punch what-so-ever. It makes you come to respect Robert Englund even more. Robert could still make Freddy at least entertaining, even in the worst of the original's sequels.Freddy has zero presence. They show way too much of him and it always falls flat. He's a lot creepier in his pre-burned state. Nothing against Jackie Earle Haley, as he has little to work with, but I was reminded of his role as Rorschach in Watchmen too much. I don't really blame him for being lazy and phoning in his older character here though. No performance would have saved this from its limp direction and pathetic screenplay. I'm guessing he sensed that early on.Worst of all this film as absolutely ZERO imagination. None. Zilch. Nada. It tries to steal a few of the imaginative dream ideas from other films but it has no idea how to do even that right. The rip-offs are pale, empty shells. It offers nothing of its own. This is a film monster that lives in your dreams. Anything can happen. This should be exploited. It is not. Even the most horrible sequels from the past used the whole concept of dreams imaginatively.Despite the bad direction and screenplay, one gets the feeling the director/writers actually were passionate about this film. That's the sad part. You can't even feel contempt for them, just pity.A bland project from soulless filmmakers with no sense of storytelling, characterization, pace, imagination, intellectual curiosity...not even camera technique for god's sake. (Nice picture quality is about as much they can manage).They did manage one good thing. They excised that ridiculous sequence from the original were Nancy sets up dozens of complicated booby traps for Freddy that takes her all of 30 minutes to construct.

It didn't have the same '80s atmosphere of the original, they went for a more modern direction.

1300352,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B002ZG971U,A. Estes,"[2, 5]","Every town has an Elm Street, and it appears as though every horror classic will have its remake. You knew it was coming sooner or later, and here it is, the remake of Wes Craven's iconicA Nightmare on Elm Street. From Platinum Dunes, the production company that brought us theFriday the 13thandThe Texas Chainsaw Massacreremakes, this re-boot of the surreal horror franchise finds its anti-hero, Freddy Krueger, being re-casted for the first time after eight films from Robert Englund to Jackie Earle Haley (Watchmen) under the direction of Samuel Bayer (whose claim to fame is the classic ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" video by Nirvana).Those familiar with Platinum Dunes' track record will not be surprised to find this version of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" coming up short on change. Its biggest crime is that very rarely does it break with the original film, which in turn makes for a stale experience. There is little to no suspense, as many of the death scenes emulate those that were played out in the original, and on top of it, they are achieved with CGI so bad that it makes the effects from 1984 look much superior; case in point, Freddy coming through the wall above Nancy's bed, which is just embarrassing to look at. Bayer, who has a strong visual sense, gives the film a good look, but the film feels hollow, which could be chalked up to an underwhelming script by Wesley Strick.Aside from Haley, who is criminally under-utilized in the film, the cast appears to be asleep at the wheel, phoning in performances of characters that are wooden to begin with. Here, the heroine of the story, Nancy, is played by Rooney Mara, who perhaps could have been more effective in her role if she were given any personality. All we know about this character is that she doesn't fit in and isn't too happy. Nancy 2010 is, for lack of a better term, emo, and is a far cry from the girl-next-door that was portrayed by Heather Langenkamp. Freddy, on the other hand, is given a bit of a twist to his back-story, in an attempt to make the character more threatening and to set up a twist ending that doesn't quite pan out. To be fair, this little bit of back-story was well-done even if the purist fans won't want to admit it. Haley also brings a few new tricks to the role of Krueger that stand out. The way he grinds the blades on his glove together when stalking his prey is rather effective and his thick, southern drawl adds another layer of creepiness to the character. Robert Englund would be proud.In the end, though, this new take on the material is just another walk on Elm Street. Just like a hazy dream, you'll forget bits of it quickly upon its finale. What made Wes Craven's film so special is how he did so much with so little. What makes this film so frustrating, however, is that so little is accomplished with so much to work with. Here you have a very well-seasoned and gifted actor in Jackie Earle Haley and a director who excels at strong visuals, but not much is accomplished with these elements. Fans will find it bland, perhaps even surprisingly inoffensive, while newcomers and younger viewers will be left wondering what the big deal is with this Freddy guy anyway. This new ""Nightmare"" simply isn't strong enough to warrant the kind of franchise that dominated 80's pop-culture and built New Line Cinema from the ground up. Nice try, but the original still reigns supreme.",3,"One, Two Freddy's Coming in a Re-Do...",1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,3393,"['town', 'Elm', 'Street', 'horror', 'classic', 'will', 'have', 'remake', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'sooner', 'later', 'here', 'remake', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'iconicA', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Platinum', 'Dunes', 'production', 'company', 'brought', 'theFriday', '13thandThe', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacreremakes', 're-boot', 'surreal', 'horror', 'franchise', 'anti-hero', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'being', 're-casted', 'first', 'time', 'eight', 'films', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Watchmen', 'direction', 'Samuel', 'Bayer', 'claim', 'fame', 'classic', 'Smells', 'Teen', 'Spirit', 'video', 'Nirvana', '.Those', 'familiar', 'Platinum', 'Dunes', 'track', 'record', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'version', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'coming', 'up', 'short', 'change', 'biggest', 'crime', 'very', 'rarely', 'break', 'original', 'film', 'turn', 'stale', 'experience', 'little', 'suspense', 'many', 'death', 'scenes', 'emulate', 'were', 'played', 'out', 'original', 'top', 'are', 'achieved', 'CGI', 'so', 'bad', 'effects', '1984', 'look', 'much', 'superior', 'case', 'point', 'Freddy', 'coming', 'wall', 'Nancy', 'bed', 'just', 'embarrassing', 'look', 'Bayer', 'who', 'strong', 'visual', 'sense', 'film', 'good', 'look', 'film', 'feels', 'hollow', 'could', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'underwhelming', 'script', 'Wesley', 'Strick.Aside', 'Haley', 'who', 'criminally', 'under-utilized', 'film', 'cast', 'be', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'phoning', 'performances', 'characters', 'are', 'wooden', 'begin', 'Here', 'heroine', 'story', 'Nancy', 'played', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'who', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'role', 'were', 'given', 'personality', 'know', 'character', ""n't"", 'fit', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'Nancy', '2010', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'emo', 'far', 'cry', 'girl-next-door', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Heather', 'Langenkamp', 'Freddy', 'other', 'hand', 'given', 'bit', 'twist', 'back-story', 'attempt', 'make', 'character', 'more', 'threatening', 'set', 'up', 'twist', 'ending', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pan', 'out', 'be', 'fair', 'little', 'bit', 'back-story', 'was', 'well-done', 'even', 'purist', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'admit', 'Haley', 'also', 'few', 'new', 'tricks', 'role', 'Krueger', 'stand', 'out', 'way', 'blades', 'glove', 'together', 'when', 'stalking', 'prey', 'rather', 'effective', 'thick', 'southern', 'drawl', 'layer', 'creepiness', 'character', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'though', 'new', 'take', 'material', 'just', 'walk', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Just', 'hazy', 'dream', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'bits', 'quickly', 'finale', 'What', 'made', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'how', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'frustrating', 'however', 'so', 'little', 'accomplished', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'Here', 'have', 'very', 'well-seasoned', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'director', 'who', 'strong', 'visuals', 'not', 'much', 'accomplished', 'elements', 'Fans', 'will', 'find', 'bland', 'perhaps', 'even', 'surprisingly', 'inoffensive', 'newcomers', 'younger', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'Freddy', 'guy', 'anyway', 'new', 'Nightmare', 'simply', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'warrant', 'kind', 'franchise', 'dominated', '80', 'pop-culture', 'built', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'ground', 'up', 'Nice', 'try', 'original', 'still', 'reigns', 'supreme']",N/A

Of course I don't like that Freddy was a pedophile, but since they made it that way, I liked the back-story with Nancy and the other kids, and how they played up the ""need"" in Freddy for making the kids remember to give him a sort-of new life in their dreams.The only think I didn't like is the fact that the glove itself was not really a major factor. There was no scene included of Freddy making his glove. They only showed a brief scene of him looking at a garden rake and suggesting the idea of a glove. In the same regard, since Freddy was not necessarily a child murderer, they really gave no explanation of why he even made a glove in the first place. There were the back flash scenes of some kids with scratch marks on them, conceivable from the glove, but no ""why"". I would really have liked to have seen more of the glove, after all it is a horror icon.On the plus side, Freddy, after the burning, came off as a great character.

1300356,A13RYFCGR7AM7E,B002ZG971U,"Andrew Thompson ""a.k.a. Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[43, 58]","*sigh*All right, I've said many times in my reviews how I'm a purist when it comes to film, ESPECIALLY horror films, and even MORE especially when it comes to what I (and most others of my ilk) consider to be classics of the genre.  I've often slammed other remakes (or the more PC ""re-imaginings"") as gimmicky attempts to use modern special effects to make a bundle of money riding the coattails of other's originality...I suppose a lesson in humility is good for the soul.This vision of the unredoubtable 80s staple of the horror genre has received a lot of bad press from the horror community; many cite the new backstory (and ANYone other than Robert Englund playing the role) of the iconic Freddy Kruger as blasphemy; many think the characters are pale, one-dimensional shadows of the originals who are merely fodder for the film's sake; Wes Craven himself has spoken out against the film.I myself, before seeing the film, made the comment on many occasions that I felt this movie would be a bland attempt by the producers to simply cash in on the new 're-imagining' kick, and refused to pony up ten bucks to see it in the theater.Well, I found myself at a friends over the weekend, and his fourteen year old daughter had rented the flick, so I saw an opportunity to watch it at no cost to me, and honestly settled in to bash the film at every turn......an hour and a half later, having watched his daughter cringe and huddle behind a blanket and having myself felt that old familiar cringe and sense of mystery and fear, was dazed at my own reactions...The original movie put a new face on fear; it forced upon us a grudging fascination of the darkness that may permeate reality, and turned the genre on it's ear.  Craven's masterpiece was genuinely a SCARY film in a sea of cookie-cutter teen slashers...the sequels, sadly, saw the character of Freddy become something of a mockery of horror baddies, his methods and omnipresent quips and one-liners taking a lot of steam from the fear factor (excepting of course ""New Nightmare"", which was the only other entry in the series to prey once more upon our short hairs rather than our funny bones)...but the original gave us something we were sorely lacking in that time...honest to God FEAR....and as pained as I am to admit (and spent a day or two in denial before I am writing this), this new film brings that back....so back to the other night; when it was all over, I was stunned.  I can't help it folks, I loved it.  I thought it took the franchise back to where it belonged.  I'm sure I'll get crucified by my peers who enjoyed the ""comical"" Freddy, and those who feel he's an untouchable giant of the genre (as I MYSELF did, just a few days ago), but I have to be honest......I found this film downright scary, having the same atmospheric dread that the original captured, but in a modern setting.  I felt it was realistic and compelling.  I DID care about the characters; I was right there with them in their tribulations, all the sassy comments I had prepared taking a backseat to my silent apprehension...I had no issue with the new backstory, as to me it was just a more detailed explanation of the origins of the hated Kruger; indeed, I found myself wondering if the filmakers had chosen to make a different interpretation of Freddy's rage, and despite initial reservations, decided it may well make the character even more frightening (I can't be more detailed and still remain spoiler-free; watch the film and you can't miss what I'm talking about).  This didn't happen, and the film was STILL frightening, but the fact that it made me reconsider age-old concepts was interesting and fresh.  The new make-up was to me much more realistic in what it was supposed to look like, and Haley's performance was very menacing while holding onto the humor in a much darker and sardonic way.  All in all, I think all due honors were payed to the original without capitalizing on them and making a mere 'copy'.Do I think it's BETTER than the original?  I can't really say that; classics are STILL classics, and Englund will always be Freddy Kruger in my mind's eye...however, I CAN say that unlike the new ""Amityville Horror"" and ""Friday the 13th"", I do NOT relegate this flick to ""crappy remake"" status; I can say that I consider this to be a true retelling for a new generation, and I'm not sure if I'm delighted or ashamed.If you loved the original, you should give this one a rental and watch it with an open mind; remove your preconceptions and see it for what it is, and I think you'll find a gem...on the other hand, if you're like I THOUGHT I was and hung up enough on the originals that you're going to hate it no matter what, then my advice is to walk on......but if you're a new generation horror-phile, DEFINITELY pick this one up; it heartens me to know that you can experience what I believe to be the same kind of fearful feeling guys like ME did watching the original back in the early eighties.I'm going to order myself a copy of this, then get back to eating my crow...not too bad with a little oregano...Sweet dreams!",5,Please pass the salt....,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,5093,"['*sigh*All', 'right', ""'ve"", 'said',

Reminds me of a friend trying to tell me the plot of a movie but missing a lot and not understanding the original material.First problem. Freddy is not scary. How any man in a red and green sweater with a burned face and razor fingers and be so bland is beyond me? Just not scary at all. Then the main character Nancy seems to have some socialization problems. She barely talks. Her character is so ill drawn, I still can't understand why should be be Freddy's favorite or why she would be looked to by the others. Plus there is no explanation as to how she would figure anything complicated out about how to destroy Freddy. She isn't that bright. I love that in this version they go to the internet to figure things out. While in the original they went to a hospital specializing in sleep disorders and they explained how the character came to figure things via a lot of time and research. Here, it just happens.  I guess she found reviews of the original movie.Much of the time that should have been spent on characterization is spent telling the story of Fred Kruger. Not worth it, it could have been taken care of with a few lines and the audience could have figured out the rest. I heard someplace they had planned on making Fred Kruger innocent in this version but took it out at the last moment. That would explain why so much of the movie is focused on Fred Kruger and then there is a quick change tacked on in the end.Next problem, in the original Freddy was smart enough to make sure all the deaths appeared to be suicide / murder or at least unexplained. Here people are knifing themselves in public, while asleep, in front of many witnesses. Dying via exploding chest in a locked prison cell. And no investigator is concerned? No parent is concerned? No one ? Really?  The list of ""Freddy's"" kids in this movie is considerably longer and no one is the slightest bit concerned that all the kids are dead - when the movie starts?Then, the rules of the dream world keep changing. Freddy brings in one of the characters and tells him what the parents did. Huh? Are dreams ways for Freddy to chat with the kids? NO no they aren't for the rest of the movie and they weren't in the original. Why would Freddy care if the kids understood. NO no, he wants them dead. In the original it is Nancy who unravels the mystery on the outside of the dream world. Freddy doesn't help her out. Geeeze... lazy writing.The ending of the movie is just as bizarre as the original but lacks the power of that scary ending. We were led to believe there that Nancy held the power based on her will while, here, it seemed like an accident or pure luck that Freddy was defeated. So when the tables turn here is is like - whatever. The whole time leading to that twist you are waiting for it to happen because things ended so quick and lucky for this Nancy. But in the original you are sure that the heroine has won and so it is that much scarier and creepy when the twist comes about.",1,Shell of the original,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,3054,"['Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'movie', 'shell', 'really', 'scary', 'original', 'friend', 'trying', 'tell', 'plot', 'movie', 'missing', 'lot', 'not', 'understanding', 'original', 'material.First', 'problem', 'Freddy', 'not', 'scary', 'How', 'man', 'red', 'green', 'sweater', 'burned', 'face', 'razor', 'fingers', 'be', 'so', 'bland', 'Just', 'not', 'scary', 'Then', 'main', 'character', 'Nancy', 'have', 'socialization', 'problems', 'barely', 'talks', 'character', 'so', 'ill', 'drawn', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'be', 'Freddy', 'favorite', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'looked', 'others', 'explanation', 'how', 'would', 'figure', 'anything', 'complicated', 'out', 'how', 'destroy', 'Freddy', ""n't"", 'bright', 'love', 'version', 'go', 'internet', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'original', 'went', 'hospital', 'specializing', 'sleep', 'disorders', 'explained', 'how', 'character', 'came', 'figure', 'things', 'lot', 'time', 'research', 'Here', 'just', 'guess', 'found', 'reviews', 'original', 'movie.Much', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'characterization', 'spent', 'telling', 'story', 'Fred', 'Kruger', 'Not', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'care', 'few', 'lines', 'audience', 'could', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'rest', 'heard', 'someplace', 'had', 'planned', 'making', 'Fred', 'Kruger', 'innocent', 'version', 'took', 'out', 'last', 'moment', 'would', 'explain', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'focused', 'Fred', 'Kruger', 'then', 'quick', 'change', 'tacked', 'end.Next', 'problem', 'original', 'Freddy', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'make', 'sure', 'deaths', 'appeared', 'be', 'suicide', '/', 'murder', 'least', 'unexplained', 'Here', 'people', 'are', 'knifing', 'public', 'asleep', 'front', 'many', 'witnesses', 'Dying', 'exploding', 'chest', 'locked', 'prison', 'cell', 'investigator', 'concerned', 'parent', 'concerned', 'one', 'Really', 'list', 'Freddy', 'kids', 'movie', 'considerably', 'longer', 'one', 'slightest', 'bit', 'concerned', 'kids', 'are', 'dead', 'when', 'movie', 'Then', 'rules', 'dream', 'world', 'keep', 'changing', 'Freddy', 'one', 'characters', 'what', 'parents', 'did', 'Huh', 'Are', 'ways', 'Freddy', 'chat', 'kids', 'NO', 'are', ""n't"", 'rest', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'original', 'Why', 'would', 'Freddy', 'care', 'kids', 'understood', 'NO', 'dead', 'original', 'Nancy', 'who', 'mystery', 'outside', 'dream', 'world', 'Freddy', ""n't"", 'help', 'out', 'Geeeze', 'writing.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'bizarre', 'original', 'power', 'scary', 'ending', 'were', 'led', 'believe', 'Nancy', 'held', 'power', 'based', 'will', 'while', 'here', 'seemed', 'accident', 'pure', 'luck', 'Freddy', 'was', 'defeated', 'So', 'when', 'tables', 'turn', 'here', 'whole', 'time', 'leading', 'twist', 'are', 'waiting', 'happen', 'things', 'ended', 'so', 'quick', 'lucky', 'Nancy', 'original', 'are', 'sure', 'heroine', 'won', 'much', 'scarier', 'creepy', 'when', 'twist', 'about']",N/A

I understand people would have a hard time to adjust to this but apparently fans choose Jackie Earle Haley as the new Freddy. The movie kicked off strong and it rarely lets up thru out this fun ride. Haley did a great job as Freddy his laugh was perfect and I enjoyed all his lines. However, I will admit the biggest problem with the film was the quick shocks that would only make women scream. The acting, which is a big problem in alot of horror remakes, is not bad but nothing award winning and the teens didnt run around swearing and doing drugs. The girl playing Nancy couldnt hold a candle to the original but I was too focused on Freddy. One of the smartest ideas came from within the movie, something fans probably forgot because they hated the movie. The part were they talked about not sleeping for some time will make you take micronaps and you'd eventually slip into a coma. Freddy says too Nancy that he kept her up so she would slip into a coma.

I would take part 4 and 5 any day over this. Yes, true he did look like a Genuine burn victim in this one. But there was no thrill no comedy no since of malice or anything. It almost looked like Haley had a mask on his face he was so stiff. The story was slow, boring and tedious at times with little imagination. I felt like Freddy's lines were sad, poor pathetic renditions of a once energetic and fun killer. ""Why are you Crying ? I haven't even cut you yet ? The kills were boring with the exception of the end. Not much to see here seemed like they were operating on a skeleton budget and some bad actors. I mean I couldn't tell Nancy from any other character in the film which is pretty sad when you think about it. And I just kept laughing at Freddy's voice it was pretty funny in my opinion. If you want to see the last good Freddy flick rent ""New Nightmare"" save your time. That too me was a great rendition on the Freddy character and a more chilling one.

Replacing Freddy Krueger takes away from the movie, and Jackie isn't the Freddy Krueger we've sat and watched kill a dozen teenagers per film. In the 2010 reimagining of Wes Craven's film A Nightmare on Elm Street, Jackie Earle Haley plays Freddy Krueger, and it is extremely different compared to the classic slasher film many viewers grew up watching. There is a different take on the make-up, as Kevin Yagher is not on the team for the remake. This movie is also dependent on computer technology, as it was used to ""remove"" parts of Freddy's cheek to make him look more like a ""real burn victim"" (although I, personally don't think either of the actors looked like real burn victims). The voice Jackie uses, although awesome and evil, doesn't belong in a remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street. His voice sounds great, and he's perfect for horror movies, but he really wasn't that great as Freddy Krueger.  I think Robert should have come back for a remake, or they should have stayed more faithful to the original movie, using the same character names (I think Nancy and Freddy are the only characters from the original movie that are in the remake).So, I say it's OKAY.

1300369,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B002ZG971U,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[62, 77]","I never understood the recent outcropping of horror remakes. I've seen a number of them, and I really don't understand them after watching them. What's the point?. More often than not, they are not any good, and suck all of the originality, cleverness, spirit, atmosphere, and scares out of the original concept. They all seem to be glossy, over-produced pieces of MTV entertainment for young modern audiences with shortened attention spans. The re-boot of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is no different. To me, this, and the replacement of Robert Englund, was the most offensive of all the re-makes. I thought RZ's ""Halloween"" films took the cake, but this one being remade hit home more for me. Let's get started....A good helping of the story should be familiar to everybody. There's no need to go into great detail about it or the story since it's basically the same, but with some differences. Freddy Krueger worked at a pre-school as a gardner, and a bunch of parents chased him down and burned him alive when it was suspected that he was molesting the kids there. Now, some of those kids are teenagers(Yeah, right)in high school, and they are beginning to have nightmares about this strange, burned man in a fedora, red and green striped sweater, and razor fingered glove, who can kill you for real in your dreams. Yeah, we know the story. As Freddy picks the kids off one by one, the remaining survivors try to stay alive, and awake, and survive this nightmare. The audience will be trying to stay awake as well.It's hard to have your review come across as honest to fans of the remakes. There is so much hate out there for remakes, but they do have their fans too. Some people will think a bashing review is just some fan boy who wouldn't give it a positive one even if it deserved it. I am a huge Freddy fan. I grew up on these movies. I love Robert Englund. But I am also honest, and I can't honestly give this a glowing review or find much in the way of positive things to say. In fact, most of it makes me angry. So, let's get into what I thought....A Nightmare On Elm Street 2010 is a movie made for modern audiences who are all about gloss, noise, and in your face absurdity and not even the faintest hint of intelligence, creativity, or scares. This is not a movie made for the fans. The powers that be could clearly care less about them, and only seem fixated on the buck. This version of Elm Street is a dreary place to hang out in, not that the ""Elm Street"" has much to do with the movie. There is such a cold, mechanical, by the book product at work here, that it's even hard to enjoy as simple entertainment. There is just not a lot of fun going on here, and that extends to Freddy himself. He doesn't seem to be having any fun. There is none of the demented glee in this Krueger. Just cold, monotonous killing. The only things that might bring a jolt to the fan is seeing a few iconic set pieces play out in the new film, but even then they are completely drained of any of the impact they originally had. Case in point being Freddy stretching thru the wall. The original version was more realistic and cool. Here, it's just a bad CGI effect that looks like a cartoon. The problem here, as with most movies, horror or not, is a concern for putting in lots of CGI and less worry on atmosphere or scares. That some CGI enhanced scene would replace or compensate for lack of everything else. The movie is filled with some MTV-type cutting, fake scares, and loud noises. The mood, tension, atmosphere, and creepiness of the original is completely gone, as is the heart and passion Wes Craven and Co. put into it. Again, this is just a product. A famous name to jump on and bring in a big opening weekend. That's all they care about. This is not the Elm Street I know. I feared what it would be, and got what I expected. I was hoping there would be something there for the fan, something to hold on to to enjoy, but it's just not there. The script is silly, and the ""micro-naps"" concept is ridiculous. An excuse to have Freddy appear everywhere and further diminish any creep factor, tension, suspense, or anything at all. But, then again, the movie was already disappointing on every front anyways. The kills aren't that cool or inventive, the dreams are not out of this world as you would think in this day and age, and the film is just drab looking. Director Samuel Bayer hasn't made any kind of impression with his first film. He films every scene so that you know immediatley what's going to happen and what's a dream and what's not. There is nothing sneaking up on you. It's been well known that Bayer didn't really know much about Elm Street and has said himself that he was never really a fan. Well, clearly. It definitley shows. If there is a sequel, get someone with a respect and love not only for the character and franchise, but for the fans as well.How was Freddy himself and the cast?. I like Jackie Earle Haley a lot. Great actor. But he's not Freddy, and this just isn't for him. Just like there is only one Dirty Harry, Rocky, Indiana Jones, etc, there is only one Freddy Krueger. Robert Englund. Everything that made Fredy ""Freddy"" is gone. You just can't replace that, or start something new and think it's going to work as well. Here, Freddy is more of a pervy killer with no charm, charisma, or interest in teasing his intended prey or messing with them. In this one, Freddy is simply out for the kill with no real character or presence. Or point. Englund is sorely missed. Only he can be the ""funny Freddy"", and only he can be the sick, demented dream killer we fell in love with in the original. The changes they made in Freddy's crimes when he was alive is in extreme poor taste and makes for very uncomfortable, squirmiy moments. Not only that, but it renders the glove completely pointless. The original story gave the glove a meaning. Here, it has no meaning. He cut up a girl's dress a bit?. Give me a break!. The backstory is silly and on incredibly shaky ground. It renders this Freddy even less than he already was. Like I said, Haley is a fine actor, and this isn't entirely his fault. This wasn't right for him, but the script served him with absolutely nothing either. The rest of the cast fare no better. None of them are remotely interesting, and therefore you could really care less about any one of them. Our main heroine Nancy(Rooney Mara), seems like a secondary character who is thrust into the spotlight. The original Nancy was a normal girl who became very interesting. Here, Nancy is a gothy loner who isn't interesting and becomes less so as the movie drags on. All the others are even less, although I felt more for Katie Cassidy, who is the ""Tina"" of the movie. Still, the film wouldn't of faired any better with her as Nancy. No, there isn't really the jock or the dimbulb cheerleader and so on, but there isn't anything here in these drab, mundane characters either.A Nightmare On Elm Street 2010 is just soulless. It's devoid of popcorn tossing scares and entertainment, a strong script, good characters, menace, atmosphere, and everything that made the 1984 original an iconic landmark in the genre. You want to see a good movie that has everything and does it right?. Then watch the originals. This movie is a classic for a reason. And producers, if you want today's youth to have experiences that was had by moviegoers who saw the original films, then re-release those in theaters or create your own original films. You can reboot a well known product, but you will never be able to emulate it or what the movie was or achieved. It just can't be done. Elm Street 2010 is a sad affair. Even sadder is the fact that it will probably do well, and will lead to unnecessary sequels to a reboot nobody wanted or asked for in the fist place. This isn't a movie made by the fans for the fans, but a movie made by a group of people who clearly have no idea what made these movies in the first place or what has made them last for nearly 3 decades. Hollywood has simply ran out of ideas, but is still full of people and producers ready to make a buck on a known product without the sightest clue as how to do it.",1,"1, 2, Freddy's Gonna Bore

These new remakes make me want to scream cause they are so stupid!!!!! They are nothing but dry horror the same old stuff we see coming to the theaters every week. Whatever happened to being scared to death?? I remember the first time i ever watched Halloween, Nightmare on elm street, Friday the 13th, John Carpenters The thing, Poltergeist, and of course the original zombie movies.....but these remakes are so silly i laugh at them. I own all the old horror films and i still wont watch them right before bed, but these new ones i smile while i watch. The guy who plays Freddy is NOT scary he looks like my scarecrow mask i decorate with on Halloween. His voice is NOT frightning at all.

1300371,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002ZG971U,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","First of all let me mention something before discussing the movie.  My first ever nightmare happened when I was only 5 years old back in 1986.  In the dream I was walking outside my school alongside the parking lot, it was nighttime, and I remember a cool, yet intimidating breeze was blowing.I go to walk down the parking lot some more, feeling uneasy and anticipating something horrific to appear at any moment, and upon glancing in the distance at the sidewalk beside the school building where I used to walk every morning before school, stood Freddy with his sharp claws looking directly at me!Let me tell ya- THAT was truly a terrifying ordeal!  I woke up praying it wasn't a reality, or that I haven't actually slipped into the unavoidable nightmare world, aha.  I mention this because some of the events in the movie really match up with the dream, such as the playground scene which hit a little TOO close to home for my liking.My biggest problem with this new updated version of Nightmare on Elm Street is that it's not NEARLY as frightening as the original series.Also, the guy portraying the Freddy Krueger character is absolutely horrible.  For one thing, his voice is too monotone which means he's not the least bit scary whenever the teenagers enter the nightmare world.  It's like he's simply carrying normal conversations with the teens while in the nightmare environment instead of making an impact and actually *scaring* them.At least he's fairly violent.  In fact, he's perhaps *more* violent compared to the original Freddy Krueger.  There's a ton of surprisingly bloody moments that really were gruesome and exciting to watch.There's a *somewhat* frightening atmosphere taking place for the most part, however it's not nearly as impactful as it was back in the 80's.  It just feels a bit corny.  Perhaps it's because I'm an adult and can't appreciate such an atmosphere anymore, or perhaps I've finally gotten used to the entire horror genre so it can't strike me on a more personal level anymore.  Or perhaps the directors and producers just didn't offer enough suspense.Either the storyline has been completely revamped or I can't quite remember what it was like back in the day.  Without spoiling anything, let's just say Freddy has an interesting history.  I actually enjoyed the storyline, but I can't argue with those who believe it doesn't (or shouldn't) stand in the same league as the original series.  This storyline does tend to lean more towards a detective/mystery.Overall it's alright, but please, give more respect to the original series which is honestly better.",3,fair,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,2599,"['First', 'let', 'mention', 'something', 'discussing', 'movie', 'first', 'ever', 'nightmare', 'happened', 'when', 'was', 'only', '5', 'years', 'old', 'back', '1986', 'dream', 'was', 'walking', 'outside', 'school', 'parking', 'lot', 'was', 'nighttime', 'remember', 'cool', 'yet', 'intimidating', 'breeze', 'was', 'blowing.I', 'go', 'walk', 'down', 'parking', 'lot', 'more', 'feeling', 'uneasy', 'anticipating', 'something', 'horrific', 'appear', 'moment', 'glancing', 'distance', 'sidewalk', 'school', 'building', 'where', 'used', 'walk', 'morning', 'school', 'stood', 'Freddy', 'sharp', 'claws', 'looking', 'directly', 'Let', 'tell', 'ya-', 'THAT', 'was', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'ordeal', 'woke', 'up', 'praying', 'was', ""n't"", 'reality', 'have', ""n't"", 'actually', 'slipped', 'unavoidable', 'nightmare', 'world', 'aha', 'mention', 'events', 'movie', 'really', 'match', 'up', 'dream', 'such', 'playground', 'scene', 'hit', 'little', 'TOO', 'close', 'home', 'liking.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'new', 'updated', 'version', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'not', 'NEARLY', 'as', 'frightening', 'original', 'series.Also', 'guy', 'portraying', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'character', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'one', 'thing', 'voice', 'too', 'monotone', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'scary', 'whenever', 'teenagers', 'enter', 'nightmare', 'world', 'simply', 'carrying', 'normal', 'conversations', 'teens', 'nightmare', 'environment', 'instead', 'making', 'impact', 'actually', '*scaring*', 'them.At', 'least', 'fairly', 'violent', 'fact', 'perhaps', '*more*', 'violent', 'compared', 'original', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'ton', 'surprisingly', 'bloody', 'moments', 'really', 'were', 'gruesome', 'exciting', 'watch.There', '*somewhat*', 'frightening', 'atmosphere', 'taking', 'place', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'impactful', 'was', 'back', '80', 'just', 'bit', 'corny', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'adult', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'such', 'atmosphere', 'anymore', 'perhaps', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'gotten', 'used', 'entire', 'horror', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'strike', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'anymore', 'perhaps', 'directors', 'producers', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'enough', 'storyline', 'been', 'completely', 'revamped', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'like', 'back', 'day', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Freddy', 'interesting', 'history', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'storyline', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'who', 'believe', ""n't"", 'should', ""n't"", 'stand', 'same', 'league', 'original', 'series', 'storyline', 'tend', 'lean', 'more', 'towards', 'detective/mystery.Overall', 'alright', 'please', 'give', 'more', 'respect', 'original', 'series', 'honestly', 'better']",N/A

For special effects, yes this movie is going to be better because the technology changed over the years, but for scares the original has it hands down.

1300377,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B002ZG971U,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[1, 2]","I'll admit that Wes Craven's ANOES was perhaps one of the most influential, if not innovative scripts of the eighties. In light of that, it's almost impossible to believe that any sequels or needless remakes could ever recapture that charm in it's entirety. Nevertheless, I've seen virtually every sequel ever made & even had a razor glove as a kid which I bought from Toy R Us. Naturally, it would only make sense that I'd manage to find a way of seeing the remake in opening night if not sometime before. I somehow would like to believe that watching the final product last nite was nothing more than just a really bad dream. That would be a fortunate thing.Sadly, I haven't really been thrilled with a Freddy Krueger movie in literally years. The sequels were, in most cases, barely anymore than a parody of the original which I absolutely loved as a kid. For some reason, Krueger simply wasn't scary nor frightening anymore once we learned what he was & the general information about how he operates in the grand scheme of things. The whole sinister atmosphere in the first entry was definitely lost in the midst of every writer and director wanting to cash in on it's success with the inevitable potboiler sequels. At best, the vast majority of the ANOES sequels range from mildly to moderately entertaining yet we watched them all numerous times as kids.So what's the deal with the remake? I can't help but feel the whole revision is nothing more than an attempt to garner this generation's appeal as Hollywood assumes that no teenager in our their right mind could be so clever as to uncover the archives of horror's golden years by visiting their local video stores. How presumptuous. This generation obviously has a lot more resources than mine did as the remake will show you. Teenagers now have cell phones & the Internet readily available so there is no earthly reason why they shouldn't be able to find access to the films I loved & grew up with. Hollywood evidently feels that kids today are too lazy, however, & would prefer a rehash or remix if you will of yesterday's wonders. Maybe they are right as teenagers flocked to the remake on opening night in an almost imposing flux.Needless to say, ANOES will likely appeal to those teens who have thoroughly enjoyed much of the crap that has been thrown in our faces like bad food during a cafeteria food fight. Teens who adored The Grudge, The Ring, & Stay Awake will absolutely love this.Don't get me wrong. Jackie Earl Haley is a marvelous actor as he proved himself worthy of much admiration in Little Children & recently Watchmen. I, myself, thought he'd make a splendid Krueger even if the film itself was nothing to write home about. I will give Haley the benefit of the doubt. I think he could've pulled it off but I can't place the entire blame on him as the script really doesn't give him much to work with at all. Had the make-up job & script been tweaked a bit more, there may have been some possibilities as Haley surely would've been able to give the audience more of what they loved about Freddy from the get go.Having said that, there are scenes in the re-make that everyone will fondly recall. Of course, there's the infamous bath scene where Nancy falls asleep & we get to see Krueger's finger claws spontaneously rise through the bubble bath filled water. Kris is attacked in her sleep by Fred & is slung all around her bedroom while the ex-boyfriend watches in near shock before seeing her get cut four ways from Sunday. Lastly, there's the murder in jail scene although Krueger makes this one look more like internal homicide rather than suicide. This is all fine & well I suppose but these scenes alone can't really give our film the solid foundation it desperately needs.ANOES does, in fact, borrow heavily from virtually every film in the long-running series. Hardcore fans like myself can easily spot dialog used in years gone by & even character names which appear in the first three entries. It's almost fair to say we could accuse the writers here of copying & pasting material or just trying to grant the old school fans a greatest hits package although I don't believe this was their intention. I am still sticking with my theory that the film is catering to the younger set who don't know Freddy even though much of the good material used is, indeed, recycled material at best.This time around, we are unsure if Freddy was truly a filthy child molester for at least half of the film and we even question whether or not he ever murdered anyone before the parents of Elm Street took it upon themselves to roast him. In fact, there was very little concrete evidence of any crimes committed & Krueger never had to stand trial. This was a clever approach & I'll give the writers a kudos for at least trying to bring something new to the table. Although most of us probably have never sympathized with Krueger, there is a brief moment where viewers almost feel tad sorry for him though that moment is quickly abolished when we witness his heinous acts through the film.My biggest complaint has to be the casting of Rooney Mara who will never be Nancy Thompson & I sincerely hope someone else will be granted the role next time around. Unlike Heather Langenkamp, this child can't seem to get her lines right & barely speaks above a whisper for the duration of the film. For 3/4 or more through the film, I kept wanting to scream at her in hopes she'd actually speak as her mumbling was getting on my last nerve. She does belt out one or two screams near the end but I didn't even care by that time. Katie Cassidy, however, does an ok job as does Kellan Lutz but unfortunately both are killed off pretty early in the film.Sadly, I can't recommend this film. I wouldn't purchase it on DVD & it's doubtful I'll have the desire to rent it somewhere down the road.

1300379,A29CJR2LAN3LJ0,B002ZG971U,broctune,"[1, 4]","I absolutely loved this movie but I am clearly in the minority.I love nightmare on elm street and I love horror movies. This movie really scratched the right itch for me. I am usually very critical of remakes, especially for movies that I hold dear. Somehow, this movie really seemed to hit all of the right notes for me.The movie was dark which was something that the Nightmare on Elm street series has been lacking for a long time. Freddys one-liners was incredibly dark, and Freddy himself does things to the main characters that was incredibly disturbing.Probably the weakest points of this movie are the scenes where they attempted to recreate classic scenes from the original. It is disappointing to see how lifeless some of these scenes have become here, they almost feel as if they are there because they have to be. This is unfortunate, but there are certain scenes that are surprisingly creative, there is an added dream type wrinkle that has a very exciting look that stands out (microsleeps. pharamacy scene). Also, the characters besides freddy did seem like generic, forgettable horror movie pretty teens, but i honestly felt there was enough else there to keep me interested.I understand that nobody wants to see a classic destroyed but I had a hard time disliking this one, this could possibly be the insane Freddy fan coming out in me. I don't want to get flamed here but I really would appreciate exploring a non-obscenity laces discussion as to what people really did hate about this movie.At the very least I would say that this movie was a far better remake than the Friday the 13th reboot or any of the newer Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes (except maybe the one with Jessica Beil).The dvd itself is nothing spectacular. there is a short making of that isnt really very exciting and doesnt add a while lot to the movieI am fairly certain that this review will be met with some resistance but if you think you can stomach a new person playing Freddy I think you should five this a chance.",5,I loved it but you don't have to,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,2009,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'am', 'clearly', 'minority.I', 'love', 'nightmare', 'elm', 'street', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'movie', 'really', 'scratched', 'right', 'itch', 'am', 'usually', 'very', 'critical', 'remakes', 'especially', 'movies', 'hold', 'dear', 'Somehow', 'movie', 'really', 'seemed', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'me.The', 'movie', 'was', 'dark', 'was', 'something', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'street', 'series', 'been', 'lacking', 'long', 'time', 'Freddys', 'one-liners', 'was', 'incredibly', 'dark', 'Freddy', 'things', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'incredibly', 'disturbing.Probably', 'weakest', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'attempted', 'recreate', 'classic', 'scenes', 'original', 'disappointing', 'see', 'how', 'lifeless', 'scenes', 'have', 'become', 'here', 'almost', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'have', 'be', 'unfortunate', 'are', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'creative', 'added', 'dream', 'type', 'wrinkle', 'very', 'exciting', 'look', 'out', 'microsleeps', 'pharamacy', 'scene', 'Also', 'characters', 'freddy', 'did', 'seem', 'generic', 'forgettable', 'horror', 'movie', 'pretty', 'honestly', 'felt', 'was', 'enough', 'else', 'keep', 'interested.I', 'understand', 'nobody', 'see', 'classic', 'destroyed', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'disliking', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'insane', 'Freddy', 'fan', 'coming', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'flamed', 'here', 'really', 'would', 'appreciate', 'exploring', 'non-obscenity', 'laces', 'discussion', 'what', 'people', 'really', 'did', 'hate', 'very', 'least', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'remake', 'Friday', '13th', 'reboot', 'newer', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remakes', 'maybe', 'one', 'Jessica', 'Beil', '.The', 'dvd', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'short', 'making', 'isnt', 'really', 'very', 'exciting', 'doesnt', 'add', 'while', 'lot', 'movieI', 'am', 'fairly', 'certain', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'met', 'resistance', 'think', 'can', 'stomach', 'new', 'person', 'playing', 'Freddy', 'think', 'should', 'five', 'chance']",N/A

1300381,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B002ZG971U,Cagneyfan67,"[1, 2]","The Remake of A Nightmare On Elm Street is a harshly criticized horror film but it will never compare to what Wes Craven and Robert Englund did. It still is a great film. I think it's stands alone on it's own feet. If you don't compare it to the original movie I think you will appreciate and enjoy the film. It's hard not to compare though. I still really like this film. I thought Jackie Earl Haley was a great actor to play Freddy. He's short and not as tall as Englund which makes him less psychically intimidating. But for what he lacks in size Haley makes up for in acting.What hurt this film a bit is Freddy didn't fit with the film's tone. This was supposed to be a dark and serious film so having a joker campy Freddy makes no sense. The film does succeed in being very dark and serious. It's very engrossing. Mara playing the new Nancy gives a great performance. She is very different from the other Nancy. Rooney is shy, awkward and seems to be a little depressed. It's an understated performance that works fine. Kyle gives the best acting performance in the film next to Haley. I think the audience can really identify with Kyle.He likes Nancy and is shy to tell her how he feels about her but from the beginning Nancy has a clue how he feels. I thought Mara and Kyle made for a good screen couple. I thought Kyle kicked some major ass in the fighting scenes along with Mara. I can't stress how great Kyle did in the film. The film was a bit slow moving and it really needed Kyle to deliver. I thought Dekker did fine as a character you hate and aren't too concerned about. When Freddy decides to do away with him I can see how people would think it would be a better choice to care about the character. It was different for sure.Lutz from Twilight has just a cameo. I thought he could have been in the film longer. But the opening scene worked well. He still added something to the movie even though his time in the film was very brief. I thought Connie Britton did a good job in a supporting role as Nancy's mother. I thought she helped strengthen the acting in the film. Katie Cassidy was great. I thought they could have developed her character a little more and gave her more time in the film. But she still did a good job and is one of the best actors in the film. I cared a lot about her character and I didn't want to see her get it.Some of the faults of the film are there are some shot for shot parts that were done before in the original film. For example the glove in the bathtub scene and the scene where the girl is dragged on top of the ceiling. I can understand what people say that maybe they should have tried more new things instead of copying and doing the same thing. It's hard though because I feel like some of the scenes you should keep. I thought the micronaps was cool and something new. People would fall in and out of sleep in minutes as Freddy would appear then disappear. That was a plus in the film.Having them have part of the story question if Freddy was innocent or guilty was interesting. I agree that Freddy is a bad guy so he should be guilty but I found it interesting. It kept me engaged with the film as I thought it could be possible he was innocent. Having him just be a pedophile and not a child killer was fine. I think it would have been better if he was also a child killer. But it still works well. I thought one of the most powerful scenes is when Nancy and Quentin find the pictures Freddy took of them as children. They don't show what the pictures look like but Mara does a great acting job in that scene with the horror in her eyes and how disturbed she is.One of the more exciting scenes is when Nancy keeps getting her feet stuck and can't get free from Freddy. There is a real disturbing scene in the bedroom with Freddy and Nancy. I thought that was well done. I think this was a great film. I would recommend you rent it first to make sure you like it. Englund will always be the only Freddy but Haley did fine. Mara gave a real underrated performance. She's not as good as the original Nancy but she did a pretty good job. She did it differently and that's certainly one thing you want in remakes. Cheers and Enjoy!",5,A Overlooked Masterpiece.

Other than that this is a mediocre excuse for a remake that just tries to replicate some of the original scenes while leaving certain ones out(Johnny Depp being sucked into the bed and coming out in a blood geyser). Meanwhile it turns Freddy into a pedophile instead of just a child-killer like the original. The blood and other special effects also don't work as well as they did in the original. CGI blood usually doesn't look good.While this isn't quite as bad as Freddy's Dead it is pretty close making it the second worst of the series.Overall this was a pointless remake of the original horror classic that should have never been made.

Can the teens beat Freddie in his own playground? One of the more innovative slasher films of the 1980s, and a good dream movie, too. The use of the dream world is quite good; consistent and playing by its own internal rules. Outside of the dream state, he has no powers ; he can interact with a dreamer's physical body, but only when they're asleep (good point #1: the dream has power, but it also has boundaries). Dreams often take place in his boiler room abbatoir, his killing grounds when he was alive; but they can also take the form of just off-kilter everyday life (good points #2 and 3: we're always guessing when the characters are dreaming, and the dream states are like real dreams--everything is almost how it should be, but just not quite right); there is always some symbol of Freddie lurking in the dreams, but some are subtler than others.

1300388,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG971U,Chris Pandolfi,"[24, 28]","I have to give the people behind ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" credit for avoiding two mistakes that easily could have been made. Firstly, they did not try to make it a parody, which is more than I can say for last year's very disappointing remake of ""Friday the 13th."" Second, they remembered that Freddy Krueger is meant to be frightening; he's not meant to be a pizza-faced comedian with a repertoire of really bad puns and cheesy sight gags. After many, many years, he's once again a figure of fear, and just like in Wes Craven's original 1984 film, it's for reasons other than his melted skin, his demonically deep voice, his dirty stripped sweater and fedora, and his distinctive clawed right hand. 2010's ""Nightmare"" gets not only the antagonist right, but also the consistently creepy atmosphere, a blend of eerie shadows, dirty rooms, and muted colors.The weakness is in its story, which is both routine and subject to severe lapses in logic, especially as it nears the end. The characters are also problematic; they may not be like the promiscuous youths of the average teen slasher film (and for that, I'm grateful), but they are awfully bland, having been given little in the way of personality and depth. Granted, I too would be sapped of energy if I spent all my time trying to stay awake. After the apparent suicide of a high school student in a diner, classmates Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy), Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), Quentin Smith (Kyle Gallner), and Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara) all begin having nightmares. Strange that they all dream of the same thing: A burnt man wearing a clawed glove on his right hand.No more of the plot need be described. We all know about Freddy Krueger, both as a dream demon and as the man he was in the waking world. Taking the reins from Robert Englund is Jackie Earle Haley, who fits into the role perfectly. None of his expressions emerge, for his face is both buried under a ton of makeup and mostly kept in shadow. And yet, the makeup and lighting are expressions in and of themselves, and they truly do convey the sheer malice of his character. You will not see this Freddy Krueger turning anyone into a cockroach and squashing them in a roach motel, trapping anyone in a video game and playing them to death, or slitting anyone's arms and legs and using their veins to move them along like marionettes - the goal of this movie is to scare you, not make you laugh.If only the filmmakers had made more of an effort with the screenplay, which at times is incredibly inconsistent. When Nancy and Quentin confront their parents for not being forthcoming about Krueger, for example, they're told that it was only in an effort to keep them from remembering. ""From remembering what?"" Nancy pleads. We do eventually find out, although we may find ourselves confused, for it seems highly unlikely that anyone could ever forget events of such extraordinary emotional magnitude. And then there's the ending; I, of course, will not give anything away. But I will say that it raises serious questions as to the nature of Krueger's existence and why certain characters did what they did because of it. What rules are they playing by, here? Up until that point, the story was more or less within the realm of common sense.Many people will see this movie and say that it was bad. I take the approach that it could have been a lot worse. That may not be much of a compliment, but there you have it. There are elements of this movie I liked a great deal - the sets, the lighting, the makeup, the special effects, the serious tone, Haley's menacing performance. Superficial, you say? I suppose you're right, but keep in mind that this is a horror movie, meaning that if it's going to play scary (and it does play scary), it might as well look scary too. As for the actors besides Haley, I will say that they do the best they can considering the shortcomings of the material. Mostly, they just go from one scene to the next with permafrost expressions of horror on their faces; that may be fun to look at from time to time, but eventually, there does come a point when we need less character and more development.""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is by no means a great movie, but I do think it's better than some have suggested. Still, I can't help but wonder if there's going to be an entirely new series of films, and if it will only continue going downhill. The last thing I want to see is a frightful-looking Jackie Earle Haley doing something goofy on the screen, like Robert Englund had to do for five sequels and a spinoff (I exempt ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"" a thoroughly absorbing example of cinematic metafiction).

The burned horrific legend Freddy Kruger, returns in his filthy red and green sweater, dark brown hat, and of course his infamous glove with knifes affixed to the fingers. If you fall asleep and dream of Freddy and he kills you in your dreams... you die for real.It's not a long shot to say that no film has ever been more unjustly ridiculed, bashed, and appallingly underrated, than 2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street. Who are these people that keep ripping this film apart, and what is their deal? Did we see the same movie? I think not, because the film I saw was sensationally terrifying. It's at most, only a notch or two below its predecessor of the same title; the 1984 original classic from the master of cinematic horror, Wes Craven.This is not only a remake of the original, but a much deserved and long overdue reboot to the entire franchise. Freddy Kruger and I have been together since birth, as we were born just months apart in `84, and he is one of my most beloved of movie maniacs. But let's face it - the character hasn't been exactly horrifying, in years.The first one was dark and sinister and had Kruger as equally sadistic. The sequels however, as fun as they all were, showed a much more comedic Freddy. We all love and adore him to death - due mainly to the wonderful performance of Robert Englund; but I'd rather see Freddy scary than funny any day.Robert Englund gave Kruger those savage eyes, and I have no doubt he could have taken the character back to the dark depths of hell from which he originally appeared. However, New Line Cinema didn't bring Englund back, so we will all just have to move on.What New Line did do, is hire Michael Bay to produce; who is also responsible for remaking The Amityville Horror, Hitcher and the last two Texas Chainsaw Massacre flicks, which were all amazing as well. Every horror film Bay has touched has been a success. Even 2009's Friday the 13th was better than all of its previous sequels. Bay knows exactly what he's doing and I long for the day he actually directs a horror film.New Line and Bay also brought us a brand new director by the name of Samuel Bayer, and he did a phenomenal job. The movie was shot beautifully and he scares us in ways I have never seen any horror director do. If you think you know exactly when Freddy is going to pop up, or someone is going to get it - guess again. We are thrown at least three or four bloody curve balls that leave us in grueling terror.And of course, there is the new Freddy Kruger. Not only do we get an incredible Academy Award nominated actor to play Freddy (Jackie Earle Haley), but we get a whole new persona to the Freddy character as well.This has been one of the biggest complaints from fans, but I thought it to be one of the movie's strongest assets. For starters Krueger looks more like an actual burn victim. He may have looked `cooler' in the other films, but he is creepier here. You believe in every shot that he was severely burned.Jackie Earle Haley offers Freddy a new disturbing voice and an even more twisted sense of humor than ever before. The old Freddy made us laugh more for sure, but Haley's version of Kruger laughs about things that we never would. He truly is evil in every sense of the word. Plus he is not constantly being thrown around by teenagers. He man-handles everyone he deals with and is stronger than we have ever seen him, making him even more terrifying. And there are plenty of disgusting one-liners delivered via that daunting voice; my favorite being, ""Why are you screaming? I haven't even cut you yet.""The filmmakers put a lot of attention into the Kruger character. In the original version, he was a child murderer who was burned to death by the parents of his victims, after being acquitted of all charges on a technicality. This time around, he was a supposed pedophile, and let me tell you up front, that you will be bothered by Haley's portrayal of such a demon.There are some very good scenes in which Kruger taunts his victims with sexually explicit dialogue and gestures before killing them, and it's Haley's smug mouth that seals the deal every time. The brim of his dark hat covers most of his face and between that grizzly mouth and that morbid voice - he's under your skin for the entire film. I particularly liked his sleek physical movements he added to the character, and the scratching together of the knives on his glove. Brilliant; just brilliant.The film has a few flaws, but they don't lower much of its merit. The pristine precision that went into Freddy is missing from the other characters; especially in our heroine Nancy, played by Rooney Mara. A few of the classic shots from the original such as the bathtub scene, the dead blonde in bloody plastic, and Freddy appearing in the wall above Nancy's bed, all fell short of what they were in the first installment. Yes, sadly they used CGI when Freddy pokes through Nancy's wall.Still there are some new, sure to be iconic shots, such as Freddy emerging from darkness in his boiler room. And the acting somehow doesn't suffer from the lack of character development.A few other new elements include dramatic conversations between Nancy and Freddy; something I longed for in the other films. Another is the Elm Street kids experiencing micro-naps; you begin to dream while you are awake and Freddy enters your dream between snippets of reality and sleep.

I do have to agree that Jackie Earl haley did a pretty good job playing freddy. But i think one thing i will have to get used to is the new look i guess if they kept him the same look people might of liked it better. well all in all it was okay. i have to say this one thing Rob Zombie should do remakes to all horror movies. He did awesome on Halloween. ps. robert englund will always be freddy. jackie earl haley did not do a bad job. it  was not the acting it was the story. they basicaly did the same thing twice. it would of been better if they did more of an origin story like what rob zombie did on halloween. if you have not seen this movie i recommend you do.,3,A Nightmare On Elm Street(2010),1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,865,"['new', 'nightmare', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'was', 'still', 'okay', 'will', 'buy', 'just', 'collection', 'was', 'what', 'entertaing', 'i', 'still', 'think', 'original', 'had', 'more', 'sinister', 'fill', 'do', 'have', 'agree', 'Jackie', 'Earl', 'haley', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'freddy', 'i', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'used', 'new', 'look', 'i', 'guess', 'kept', 'same', 'look', 'people', 'might', 'liked', 'better', 'well', 'was', 'okay', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'should', 'do', 'remakes', 'horror', 'movies', 'did', 'awesome', 'Halloween', 'ps', 'robert', 'englund', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'freddy', 'jackie', 'earl', 'haley', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'was', 'not', 'acting', 'was', 'story', 'basicaly', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'twice', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'did', 'more', 'origin', 'story', 'what', 'rob', 'zombie', 'did', 'halloween', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'recommend', 'do']",N/A
1300393,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B002ZG971U,David Girod,"[2, 6]","I think of all the 80's horror remakes out there these days, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" had the most potential to be innovative and somewhat ""original"". The great thing about Freddy and the ""Nightmare"" movies is that there really is unlimited possibilities when it comes to the films. Anything and everything could happen in Freddy's dream worlds.Unfortunately the new ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" really doesn't take advantage of those possibilities. While not an exact paint-by-the-numbers remake of Craven's classic.....it's pretty darn close.By now you know the tale, Springwood's favorite slasher is stalking the town teens in their sleep, and if he kills them in their dreams, then they die in the ""real world"".There are quite a few things to like about the new ""Elm Street"" film. Jackie Earl Haley does the impossible by breathing new life into Freddy Krueger. Robert Englund will always BE Freddy Krueger to me....but as a way to re-introduce the character Haley did a fine job. The burn make-up on Freddy looked great, more realistic. I also liked Freddy's backstory. Usually when we are given too much info in these ""remakes"" or in prequels, it doesn't help the film and usually hurts they mystique surrounding the character...(a young Michael Myers sporting a mullet and wearing a KISS T-shirt springs to mind)..but I thought the one original portion of the new ""Elm Street"" movie that really worked was Freddy's backstory.As far as things I didn't care for about the film? The cast of cookie-cutter victims. Almost all of the kids were interchangeable, and none had the presence needed to combat Haley's charisma as Freddy. For the most part the effects were solid old-school F/X, but there were a few poor quality CGI effects that really took away from the film. There were a few bad decisions made as well when it came to ""re-shooting"" iconic scenes from the original film, such as Nancy in the bathtub. Sorry, but when you see that in the remake...your just reminded how cool the original film was, and how you are watching an inferior version.I would like to see a follow up film featuring Haley as Kreuger. Maybe let him stretch a bit in the character and in a few different settings.

1300394,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B002ZG971U,David J. Brown,"[4, 5]","Yes, Freddy is back, and by back I mean he's back in the same vein his character was portrayed in the first Nightmare on Elm Street written and directed by Wes Craven.  Sorry, hate to break it to all the 'kiddies' running rampant on the internet claiming the new Freddy is 'darker.'  He's not.  He's the same as he was back in 1984, and the same as Robert Englund portayed him.  This remake complicates his origin story, and makes it the main focus of the plot strewn into a mystery, but it's all the same.  Jackie Earle Haley does his thing, and does it well, but it's nothing new.That's the problem with this remake.  The creators thought 'something new' meant throwing red herrings into the story making it seem that Freddy was wrongfully murdered by the parents of Springwood, but rest assured, AND NO THIS CAN'T BE A SPOILER TO ANYONE WITH HALF A HALF A BRAIN, that Freddy did what he was accused of to the children.  Unfortunately, and even if you NEVER saw the original, this is obvious the whole time and the film doesn't let the audience know this fact until the begining of the third act. YAWN.  Until this plot 'revelation' we have to sit through our teen characters getting picked off one by one classic 80's dead teenager movie style.  All the nightmare sequences are dull and suspenseless, if not shot beautifully.My biggest gripe with this film is the lack of atmosphere, due mostly to the horrible editing.  A good example would be a scene where our Janet Leigh stand in-feaux final girl Kris falls asleep in class.  She wakes to a burnt version of the classroom and then enters another version of the same classroom drenched and puddled with water.  I've been staring at photos of these sets in Fangoria for three months or so.  They look great and creepy and ATMOSPHERIC, but in the film's chop-chop get to the cheesy jump scare and show Freedy editing, the creep factor is lost.  Completely lost.  The edit botch job, lack of suspense, and genuine disturbing scars wreaks of the Michael Bay school of mind-numbing filmmaking.  And why shoudln't it?  He produced this unnecessary remake.  Oh, and Jablonsky's score is the same old same old.  Loud stings that indicate a jump rather then creepy atmosphere or genuine scars.  The best parts of the score are when Jablonsky references the first film's score and what eventually became Freddy's theme.Wes Craven, whether his films succeed or not, is a cerebreal filmmaker.  The first Nightmare had lots to say about the consequences of parents behaving badly. Parents who spend so much extreme time and effort protecting their children that they forget or don't bother to actually listen to their children.  This film hints at it with a few scenes between this remake's Johnny Depp/Glen stand-in Quentin and his father played by the wasted Clancy Brown.  I was excited to see Clancy Brown in this film.  He's a solid actor and always gives his scenes his large presence, while almost doing nothing, but the script, or what it was mangled into gives him lip service.Wesley Strick(Cape Fear 1991) wrote the story for this remake, and got screenwriting credit, but I get the feeling that the second name next to the 'screenplay by' credit was hired by the Platinum Dunes folks to dumb down, speed up and force feed his original concept for this film.  Hopefully, I will find out if Strick gives an interview to Fangoria or is involved with the Blu Ray release's supplimentary materials.....Yes, I will own this film when it comes out.  I suffer from being part of the 'Fred-Head' society.  I have all the films in this series-EVEN PART 5 AND 6!  Which brings me to my final point: the film is watchable if you love Freddy like I do.  It's no worse then the third or fourth, but it's lighyears better then parts 2,5 and 6.  It doesn't improve upon the original, and its a million years away from the series high mark, and most unofficial entry, Wes Craven's New Nightmare(best in the series in my opinion).  This remake is effective as long as you know what to expect, which I have hopefully described thus far.  It's got jumps.  It's fast.  The third act is really good.  The new Freddy make-up may be the only improvement on the old series.  It's truly disturbing and realistic.  The acting, which is the biggest surprise to me, is all good.  THough, the character of Kris looks a little too old to be going to high school.  There's a scene where she steps out of her car and straps on her backpack and it just looks wrong to me.  The two lead characters of Nancy and Quentin have great chemistry and these two actors are very effective and sympathetic.  The rest of the teen cast doesn't have enough screen time or enough to do to really guage anything, but they always seem real at least.This film is a diverting time waster of horror.  It'll be forgotten....until the sequel, which will happen.  Whether or not the sequels string fans along as far as the original series did is yet to be seen, but I garuntee at least a part 2PS:  Is anyone else scared by people who rate a film poorly or well based on how KEWL the kills were?  Please tell me that people who say things like that are at least no older then 14!  Cool kills?  Creative kills?  Is a film scarier if the kills are KEWL?  Who thinks that way?  The brain dead or those who have yet to appreciate what makes a good horror film?",3,"Well, they got Freddy right, but that's about it....",1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,5353,"['Yes', 'Freddy', 'back',

1300395,A31A9GENAJYD64,B002ZG971U,David M. Rossi,"[6, 11]","With all of the negative reviews out there, apparently many must have forgotten that Freddy wasn't originally conceived as a self aware ego-maniac delivering punchlines every minute as happened in the subsequent sequels. I enjoyed much of the seriously deluded mayhem in those movies because they were some of the most inventive horror films ever produced, but they were a far cry from Craven's original version when considering scare factor as a major concern.Therefore, I for one am pleased that Michael Bay has chosen to truly darken the dreamscape with the most frightening version of the knife gloved master of night terrors ever seen. I found myself riveted with my heart racing constantly while watching this sheer terror-fest of epic proportions. This movie wasn't just sometimes scary, the whole film just oozed of scares. The crowning achievement is a reworked Tina (from the first 1984 movie) death scene that has often been named as one of the scariest gore scenes ever filmed. They found a new way to top that classic scene that had just about everybody in the theater clawing at their chair arms and shrieking and gasping (myself included) Even now, as I write this and reminisce over the scene, I am chilled to the bone and the hairs on my arms and neck are standing up at attention.Jackie Earle Haley is astoundingly scary as Freddy, but his performance is only one tiny fraction of the magic. High tech wizardry that transforms normal environments into Freddy's nightmare world. The visually jarring sequences often have you wondering where reality begins and ends and that is exactly how the original Nightmare kept it's viewers transfixed. A particularly well done CGI scene is where the ground instantly transforms into nightmare goo, where the runner can't get traction or speed to run from Freddy, allowing him to catch up quickly, since he is the nightmare master and can defeat his own traps. This proves to be another great use of the 'the impossible can happen and how do you defeat this maniac when he can do anything' vehicle that the original movie used and then the sequels over-used.The only thing I personally think could have been chopped from the new film is a CGI reworking of the rubber wall scene from the original. Here it's not menacing or scary, it's just cheesy. Luckily, it starts and ends quick and doesn't affect the pacing.The ending scene is shocking and a nice homage to the previous films' cliffhanger sequences that always promised that there is still more Freddy story to tell. No question, Jackie Earle Haley will return as Krueger in a sequel.So, for all those who claim to be Elm Street purists and have hacked this film to pieces not unlike Freddy himself has done to his victims, watch the new film again. If you view it as the creators intended it, a scarier than the original, intelligently told story about a sick, child molesting and murdering maniac, you will not be disappointed. If you only intend to view it as an opportunity for comparison to the original Freddy installments, at least do so with the understanding of the original film's elements that made it a successful venture.

After all of their parents understandably brutally murder him, he becomes Freddy and stalks and kills all of the kids when they become teens. Even when apparent victory is achieved, it actually isn't. The main female character (Nancy) is forced to endure Freddy taunting her while he looms over her on a bed for about five minutes about how he enjoyed sexually abusing her when she was little. As he attempts to kill her, she apparently gains the advantage and finally kills him (as she should have). But alas, he returns to stab his blades through her mother's head and eye sockets, brutally murdering her right in front of Nancy. The credits then roll, so he escapes unpunished for his heinous sins. I know it was a Freddy slasher flick and it was a horror movie, but the fact that they made him a child rapist and that he is able to taunt and kill them later in life after violating them when they were young children is just disgusting and sick. As a parent with a child in daycare, this movie is a grotesque outrage. It pissed me off and it was hard to sit through. I won't watch any sequels to this trash. Maybe the director and producer should be checked out to see if they have a child fetish, since they obviously enjoyed celebrating pedophilia through the vehicle of their invincible serial killer main character.

A vicious demon with a sophomoric sense of humor who inhabits the subconscious world of dreams.  Accordingly his victims must visit him, because everyone has to sleep.  I thought it was a terrific device for a horror story--a truly frightening horror story.  So I've been a fan of the original, and can totally do without all the nutty sequels.  But the other day I caught the remake of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET on cable, so I pulled up a chair.  After all, why not see what Jackie Earle Haley brings to the table as the new Freddy Krueger?  He's as ""out there"" as Robert Englund; I looked forward to his interpretation of such an iconic boogeyman.My goodness.  This film was absolutely flat, as bland as overchewed gum.  Haley acts as if on tranquilizers, sleepwalking through his role with an irritating monotone delivery as one-dimensional as the period at the end of this sentence.  The other players appear bored out of their minds, and are so unlikable and annoying we honestly don't care what happens to them.  I adore Connie Britton, yet she, too, performs her role as one of the teen's moms with perpetual disinterest.  The variations from the original story add nothing to the remake, the ending is a rip-off of one of the goofy sequels, and the suspense just ain't happenin'.

Being a big fan of Freddy's movies, i have to say that this one does not fit very well in the catalogue......Don't get me wrong here, director Samuel Bayer did a good job with this movie, the actors are great (especially Katie Cassidy...Mmm..) and director of photography Jeff Cutter did a remarkable job as well but where the film fails is really in the whole "" Freddy concept"" thing. Freddy movies used to be entertaining and funny, with elements of fantasy AND horror..Sometimes magic  too.... Freddy also used to have a very raw and morbid sense of humour, especially when he was killing someone..sometimes laughing like crazy as he was killing...that's the Freddy we are missing here......What we have in this movie is mostly a ""modern"" version of Freddy, with a lot more hate and violence.... just like most of the ""so called "" horror movies that get released these days. He seems to have lost his sense of humour and the movie itself is lacking in fantasy and magic. I have to admit I'm also missing Robert Englund here!!!! (the real Freddy) The actor they choose is different, a lot different, you can see it in his face (mask) and his voice......At least they were able to keep the original story intact: who is Freddy and where does he come from and why.....But overall, it was a bit of a let down there for me........If some of you guys wanna see the real Freddy, i would highly recommend the first 5 movies, originally shot in the 80's and beginning of 90's. My personal favourite, and probably the best of the whole series is the 4th one:  NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 - THE DREAM MASTER for which i will soon publish a review that will do justice to this amazing underrated film who is (in most part) responsible for my horror movie addiction!!!....lol ....Ronny Yu also did an amazing job with FREDDY VS JASON in 2003, the movie is funny and it delivers everything a true Freddy or Jason fan would expect!!!!...sex...blood and gore...lol...

The only real negative in this review is the fact that this was advertised as a whole different story and would show an entirely different side of Freddy Krueger. It doesn't really do this. There was dialogue that I was thinking, ""Wasn't that the same line from the original? Or very close to it?"" more than once. Also someone told me, ""The devil is very scary in this movie."" and I was intrigued by this. I thought, ""Who can beat Viggo Mortensen from the Prophecy?"". Now..That was a chilling Lucifer. I watched Nightmare twice and there was no devil (Lucifer/Satan).

1300415,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B002ZG971U,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 2]","A NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST.Remakes are a crazy thing because no matter what people will have certain expectations for it, even if they don't mean to. In this day and age remakes are becoming the norm while originality is becoming a thing of the past, kinda. Don't get me wrong I like remakes for the most part because I believe that they help to showcase something that once was off to a new generation. But the end results are mostly negative with the exception of a few remakes, but even the ones you hate are liked by some one elseSo when I heard that ""A Nightmare on Elm St."" was being remade I was kinda excited, until I learned Robert Englund was not playing Freddy. I am not one to hate on someone for trying something new though so I quickly got back to high spirits for this. Now I tried not to have expectations but I fear I did a little, whether it hurt the film or not is up for debate. I say that because I also learned it was being produced by Michael Bay which I knew for most people would mean doom. I though am not a Bay hater and in fact think he is capable of making entertaining films, those mostly have things that go ""boom"" in them. I though his other horror productions were ok for the most part, ""Friday The 13th"" was ok for what it was as was ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films. So I thought this had a chance of being at least entertaining.This is basically a straight retelling of the first film about the kids who are now in high school having dreams about a burnt man. This burnt man of course is every one's favorite dream demon Freddy and he is out for revenge. It seems he used to really care for these kids and look after them until that day he was burned alive by the parents. Why did they do that, well that is the question the kids are trying answer themselves before he kills them. They are not safe any where in this film including the police station, if the sleep they die, simple.This movie is basically the same film but with one [other than a new Freddy {more on that later}] thing totally different, the feel of the film. The first film actually felt like a horror film and had a great atmosphere about it. This one on the other hand feels more like a murder mystery since it wants to make you feel like Freddy was wrongfully killed. Not sure if it is just me here but my brother and I felt the exact same way about this. If fact he was the first to voice that it felt like a murder mystery, well done Bro. that of course takes the dread out of the film but once again could just be me.Another thing that was kinda good and bad at the same time was the young cast, that acting here is kinda off. At times the young victims in this movie do well while at others they feel just like your average horror movie body waiting for a death. I am sure if you have seen it you know what I am talking about, I guess that is what they were going for. Director Samuel Bayer did a good job visually here as the film looks good and the deaths look great but that is also kind of a mixed bag. While the film does look great it forgets the grittiness of the original which takes me back to the lack of dread in the atmosphere here. I can see what Bayer and writer Wesley Strick were trying to do but it kinda hurt the film.I will say that I did like Jackie Earley Harley in this film; he made for a good new Freddy since he looks and sounds creepy in the film. I also like the fact that they made Freddy evil again and it seems most people agree with that point. Also the film is not as bad as it sounds reading this; it just feels like your average new age horror flick. I know people who liked this, loved this, and ones who hated it so like I said earlier it worked for some people. I would recommend this as a rental because it might be for you; I kinda liked it since I was warned ahead of time.",3,FEELS LIKE A MURDER MYSTERY MORE SO THAN HORROR,1289433600,"11 11, 2010",2010,3822,"['NIGHTMARE', 'ON', 'ELM', 'ST.Remakes', 'are', 'crazy', 'thing', 'matter', 'what', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'certain', 'expectations', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'day', 'age', 'remakes', 'are', 'becoming', 'norm', 'originality', 'becoming', 'thing', 'past', 'kinda', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'remakes', 'most', 'part', 'believe', 'help', 'showcase', 'something', 'once', 'was', 'new', 'generation', 'end', 'results', 'are', 'mostly', 'negative', 'exception', 'few', 'remakes', 'even', 'ones', 'hate', 'are', 'liked', 'one', 'elseSo', 'when', 'heard', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'St.', 'was', 'being', 'remade', 'was', 'kinda', 'excited', 'learned', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'was', 'not', 'playing', 'Freddy', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'hate', 'someone', 'trying', 'something', 'new', 'so', 'quickly', 'got', 'back', 'high', 'spirits', 'Now', 'tried', 'not', 'have', 'expectations', 'fear', 'did', 'little', 'hurt', 'film', 'not', 'up', 'debate', 'say', 'also', 'learned', 'was', 'being', 'produced', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'knew', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'mean', 'doom', 'am', 'not', 'Bay', 'hater', 'fact', 'capable', 'making', 'entertaining', 'films', 'mostly', 'have', 'things', 'go', 'boom', 'other', 'horror', 'productions', 'were', 'ok', 'most', 'part', 'Friday', '13th', 'was', 'ok', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'films', 'thought', 'had', 'chance', 'being', 'least', 'entertaining.This', 'basically', 'straight', 'retelling', 'first', 'film', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'high', 'school', 'having', 'dreams', 'burnt', 'man', 'burnt', 'man', 'course', 'one', 'favorite', 'dream', 'demon', 'Freddy', 'out', 'revenge', 'used', 'really', 'care', 'kids', 'look', 'day', 'was', 'burned', 'alive', 'parents', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'well', 'question', 'kids', 'are', 'trying', 'answer', 'are', 'not', 'safe', 'where', 'film', 'including', 'police', 'station', 'sleep', 'die', 'simple.This', 'movie', 'basically', 'same', 'film', 'one', '[', 'other', 'new', 'Freddy', 'more', 'later', ']', 'thing', 'totally', 'different', 'feel', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'actually', 'felt', 'horror', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'other', 'hand', 'feels', 'more', 'murder', 'mystery', 'make', 'feel', 'Freddy', 'was', 'wrongfully', 'killed', 'Not', 'sure', 'just', 'here', 'brother', 'felt', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'fact', 'was', 'first', 'voice', 'felt', 'murder', 'mystery', 'well', 'done', 'Bro', 'course', 'dread', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'me.Another', 'thing', 'was', 'kinda', 'good', 'bad', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'young', 'cast', 'acting', 'here', 'kinda', 'off', 'times', 'young', 'victims', 'movie', 'do', 'well', 'others', 'feel', 'just', 'average', 'horror', 'movie', 'body', 'waiting', 'death', 'am', 'sure', 'have', 'seen', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'guess', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'Director', 'Samuel', 'Bayer', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'visually', 'here', 'film', 'good', 'deaths', 'look', 'great', 'also', 'kind', 'mixed', 'bag', 'film', 'look', 'great', 'grittiness', 'original', 'back', 'lack', 'dread', 'atmosphere', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'Bayer', 'writer', 'Wesley', 'Strick', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'film.I', 'will', 'say', 'did', 'like', 'Jackie', 'Earley', 'Harley', 'film', 'made', 'good', 'new', 'Freddy', 'creepy', 'film', 'also', 'fact', 'made', 'Freddy', 'evil', 'again', 'most', 'people', 'agree', 'point', 'Also', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'reading', 'just', 'feels', 'average', 'new', 'age', 'horror', 'flick', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'loved', 'ones', 'who', 'hated', 'said', 'earlier', 'worked', 'people', 'would', 'recommend', 'rental', 'might', 'be', 'kinda', 'liked', 'was', 'warned', 'ahead', 'time']",N/A

These scenes really do not add or subtract to the overall picture, which, depending on your own personal opinion, is either absolutely terrible, only mediocre, or awesome. Most have decided it was terrible, I think it's only OK. The alternate ending, is however, INTERESTING, and in my opinion, better than the theatrical ending. I won't ruin it for you, but will tell you that it does not make up the difference in purchasing the Blu-Ray copy over the DVD, unless you are a die-hard HD fanatic. The transfer is pretty standard stuff, great looking picture, but since most of this movie consists of dark environments, the HD picture will not blow you away. The scenes towards the end where Freddy's face is highly visible are good, as you can make out all the minute detail of the makeup that only Blu-Ray disc can provide.

His Platinum Dunes production company has defecated on so many horror franchises with garbage like Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, The Amityville Horror, Friday the 13th and The Hitcher. These movies were hardly sacred ground, but do WORSE with ten times the budget takes a particular amount of incompetence.Even if you can turn a blind eye to the awful CGI and cardboard characters, the fact that Robert Englund has passed the baton to Jackie Earl Haley makes this an utterly joyless experience. No offense, to Haley, who is a fine actor, but to re-cast Englund is just wrong. Robert Englund IS Freddy. He's not just a silent killer in the vein of Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers. Freddy was a character, a personality, a face (albeit an ugly one) and as far as I am concerned Englund is the only person on the face of the Earth who can do this role. Anyone else...just isn't right.The cast of teenage meat fails to engage (though Kyle Gallner manages to rise above the pathetic script). The actors are just way, way too old to convincingly play teenagers. And Rooney Mara, who plays lead heroin Nancy, is a vacuum of personality. I've never seen a more blank and expressionless actress in my life. She barely even blinks! I dread to think what she is going to make of Lisbeth Salander.The dream scenes themselves are, fittingly, yawn-fests. How many more endless 'Freddy's boiler room' sequences must we put up with.

This is A Nightmare on Elm Street.Spoilers return from the dead...Based on Wes Craven's creation music video director Samuel Bayer (Green Day: Bullet in a Bible, Blink 182: Greatest Hits and Absolute Garbage) must have felt qualified to tackle this character of 20 years of terror and camp and breathe new life in it.  This film was literally shot for shot identical from its predecessor.  Writers Wesley Strick (Final Analysis, Wolf, The Saint and Doom) and Eric Heisserer (Stranger Adventures, The Thing 2011 version and Final Destination 5) hacked Craven's simplistic creation and my blood went completely cold realizing director/producer Michael Bay (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Amityville Horror, Transformers and Friday the 13th) felt the need to produce this wonderful magnum opus.Several teenagers in Springwood Ohio are having reoccurring dreams of a burnt man with a glove with blades attached to the fingers.  Going on the basis of the original concept of making Krueger a pedophile and dragging four kids to his Uncle Touchy's Naked Puzzle Basement; several parents of these children that he abducted sought him out and burned him to death or did they?  Dun dun dun!!!The story arc starts up its focus with Kris (Katie Cassidy of Click, Black Christmas, Taken, Harper's Island and Gossip Girl) with her intense moments and emotions and blah blah blah.  A handful of teenagers Nancy (Rooney Mara of Urban Legends: Bloody Mary, Dream Boy, The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Quentin (Kyle Gallner of Smallville, Veronica Mars, Jennifer's Body, The Haunting in Connecticut and Red State) discover that memories where lashed together with nightmares.  In essence Freddy is just messing with their heads and admittedly the teens actually don't even get to bother develop as an archetype of clich&eacute;s and platitudes.A few points of the remake versus the original, the remake had a substantial budget, some great 35mm HD along with a bit of CGI and this version of Freddy is a bit more sadistic, intelligent and warped. The cinematography and the SFX is a vast improvement.  No zany puns and whacky comments. Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley of Little Children, Watchmen, Shutter Island and Dark Shadows) torments the kids with cruel slow and messier deaths.Now the effects are a vast improvement of the lack of budget in the original, story is actually scarier but Bayer has never heard of tension or build-up and the proper execution of this.  Every scare is yet another series of timed jump scares that once you catch the rhythm it is predictable as fish on Friday.  Musical cues must have a button on standby to blat out on the film.  Nice try Bayer but no cigar.  I am not stating the original is genius but it was original and clever.

He does this despite the script so kudos for making something out of nothing.Unfortunately, the soon-to-be-slashed teens are somewhat less interesting, and mope between the compulsory ""research the plot on the Internet"" scenes and high-school melodrama. The parents of the talk-back teens seem to take any amount of nonsense from these kids and their only purpose in the movie is to hide ""the big secret"" that for some reason was so prominent in the movie's trailer.Although it's been a while and maybe Craven's version wasn't exactly full of rich, three-dimensional characters, the shallowness is painfully obvious with the limp dialog and genuinely appalling acting. But the biggest difference between the original and the remake is that the newer version has completely lost any sense of terror, and it's really hard to figure out why. Partly it's that the obligatory CGI upgrade has the effect of making Freddy less scary, and partly it's because we're just not emotionally invested in the actors, but the overall effect is that it's really not scary at all.And I know there are some die-hard fans out there who really like this ""re-imagining"", but you have to ask yourself when franchise reboots come along, what would Christopher Nolan do? Using the Nolan benchmark, I can only conclude this was a missed opportunity.",2,"Haley shines, but otherwise it's a sleep-inducer",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,1724,"['really', 'reason', 'remake', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'cult', 'original', 'wondered', 'what', '20', 'years', 'pile', 'mediocre', 'sequels', 'would', 'breathe', 'franchise', 'course', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'Freddy', 'Following', 'footsteps', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'small', 'feat', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Watchmen', 'fame', 'was', 'great', 'casting', 'decision', 'out', 'sadomasochistic', 'teen-slashing', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'script', 'so', 'kudos', 'making', 'something', 'nothing.Unfortunately', 'soon-to-be-slashed', 'teens', 'are', 'somewhat', 'less', 'interesting', 'mope', 'compulsory', 'research', 'plot', 'Internet', 'scenes', 'high-school', 'melodrama', 'parents', 'talk-back', 'teens', 'seem', 'take', 'amount', 'nonsense', 'kids', 'only', 'purpose', 'movie', 'hide', 'big', 'secret', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'prominent', 'movie', 'been', 'while', 'maybe', 'Craven', 'version', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'full', 'rich', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', 'shallowness', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'limp', 'dialog', 'genuinely', 'appalling', 'acting', 'biggest', 'difference', 'original', 'remake', 'newer', 'version', 'completely', 'lost', 'sense', 'terror', 'really', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Partly', 'obligatory', 'CGI', 'upgrade', 'effect', 'making', 'Freddy', 'less', 'scary', 'partly', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'actors', 'overall', 'effect', 'really', 'not', 'scary', 'all.And', 'know', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'who', 'really', 're-imagining', 'have', 'ask', 'when', 'franchise', 'come', 'what', 'would', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'do', 'Using', 'Nolan', 'benchmark', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity']",N/A

The story was about a burnt-faced demon named, ""Freddy"" who invades the daydreams and nightmares of the young teenagers and adults. They made a total of 8 movies (1984-2003) and one tv series, ""Freddy Nightmares"" (1988-90). They also tried a game show in 2005.""Freddy Krueger"" was played by Robert Englund, who we knew from ""V"" (1983), ""V-The Final Battle"" (1984) and ""V""- TV series (1984-85).In 2009, Robert Englund decided he was too old to be ""Freddy"" and so they decided to chose Jackie Earle Haley for the new movie. We knew Haley from ""The Bad News Bears"" movie (1976-78).Bad News Bears Triple Play (3-pack).This new ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" was released April 30, 2010 and takes the story back to the beginning.It is 4:32. It is night and raining outside. Dean is stiiing inside the Springwood Diner all alone, except for the waitress, Nancy, who is ignoring him. he follows the waitress and sees the kitchen is in a hell of a mess.  Suddenly, a bladed hand opens. It is the demon, Freddy.  When Dean raises his hand over his face to protect himself, Freddy slashes his hand.  Suddenly Dean is awoken by the waitress.  it is 11:16pm. He fell asleep, but notices a bloody slash on his hand.His blonde girl-friend, Kris (Katie Cassidy) comes into the diner and talks with him. He hasn't slept for 3 days because of the nightmares.What happens next is horrifying.The story now continues with Dean's friends, Kris, Nancy, Quentin (Kyle Gallner) and Jesse (Thomas Dekker).Option of language and subtitles in English, French, Spanish.Includes one behind-the-scenes featurette.The movie itself kept my interest, but the biggest flaw is the casting of Jackie Earle Haley as the new ""Freddy"". It didn't work for me.I really miss the made-up face, the voice and laugh of Robert Englund. He had his own style that worked for 8 movies.

I also really enjoyed the films score it was really creepy and eerie. also the dream sequences were really well put together and the way characters had transitioned from real life to the dram world. Out of all of the chacters i have to say that jackie Earl Haley as Freddy Krueger and Kyle Gallner as Quintin had done the best in their rolls and i had liked them best out of the rst of the cast.

The last 10 minutes are a little fresher though and that's also where the movie works the most. That is if you count out the very end, which wasn't that great, hell the very end was pretty stupid.Hopefully Jackie Earle Haley's (Watchmen, Human Target) talents won't be wasted with sequels that are just remakes of the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. The last thing we need is a remake of part 2, that has the same plot. To know what I'm talking about watch that gawd awful movie. If anything I'd love to see a darker and less goofy Freddy vs Jason film, that is if Michael Bay's company can actually do something original with that concept.

Save yourself some time and just go to the final scene and watch the killer CGI effect! That's a nice way to end a movie and it might make you want to go back and watch the rest of it.New Freddy looks way more like a burn victim than old Freddy and he really lacks a sense of humor. He could have used some shoulder pads to give him more of a threatening look. He doesn't wear the hat like Robert Englund. It's the Nighmare man that makes the clothes. Not the other way around.The overall story is easier to understand than the original as you see Freddy back when he was human and before he got burnt. Freddy's deep voice comes off like someone is on a microphone with the bass turned to 11. It's so deep and booming it takes away from the film and doesn't feel real. The intent of that could have been just to do something different.If they make a sequel to this one they really should have old Freddy and new Freddy fight it out just like Freddy vs. Jason. That would draw way more interest than any Freddy sequel they could make at this point.I waited to get this one on DVD because I knew it wouldn't be worth paying the price to get in the theater despite being A Nightmare on Elm Street fan. It's worth around five-bucks on DVD.

Years later it seems five teenagers like Nancy (Rooney Mara), Quentin (Kyle Gallner), Kris (Katie Cassidy), Jesse (Thomas Dekker), and Dean (Kellan Lutz) are haunted literally in their dreams by Freddy who is a burnt dream demon with knives for fingers as he kills off some one by one in their dreams. Can some of the survivors find a link to the past and find a way to stop Freddy?An actually fair reimagining/reboot of the Elm Street franchise! Platinum Dunes who did the well made ""Friday The 13th"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remakes did an OK job of reimagining Freddy Krueger. Samuel Bayer who is known for ""Nirvana"" videos does his debut here and it's not too bad, although i do understand it's to make Freddy scary again and not to crack too many jokes. The problems with it is that it feels too damned rushed and quick, the acting is mediocre even from the awesome Clancy Brown although i gotta Mr. Haley did a great performance as the new Freddy Krueger but nothing will touch Robert Englund's immortal performance. Some of the CGI looks cheap at times and some of the kills are kind of stale, i gotta say they did an alright job of rebooting the series but Craven's movie will be the best and ""Friday The 13th"" with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remakes were better.This Blu-Ray offers flawless picture and sound quality like you would see in a theater, there is some good extras like a featurette, Maniacal Movie Mode that is a feature length behind the scenes thing as you watch the movie, additional scenes including alternate endings and footage of making the film.",3,Fair remake!,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,1753,"['town', 'Springwood', 'was', 'once', 'preschool', 'gardener', 'named', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'Jackie', 'Earl', 'Haley', 'who', 'played', 'kids', 'parents', 'found', 'molested', 'Years', 'later', 'five', 'teenagers', 'Nancy', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'Quentin', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'Kris', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'Jesse', 'Thomas', 'Dekker', 'Dean', 'Kellan', 'Lutz', 'are', 'haunted', 'literally', 'dreams', 'Freddy', 'who', 'burnt', 'dream', 'demon', 'knives', 'fingers', 'one', 'one', 'dreams', 'Can', 'survivors', 'find', 'link', 'past', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'Freddy', 'actually', 'fair', 'reimagining/reboot', 'Elm', 'Street', 'franchise', 'Platinum', 'Dunes', 'who', 'did', 'well', 'made', 'Friday', '13th', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'did', 'OK', 'job', 'reimagining', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'Samuel', 'Bayer', 'who', 'known', 'Nirvana', 'videos', 'debut', 'here', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'i', 'do', 'understand', 'make', 'Freddy', 'scary', 'again', 'not', 'crack', 'too', 'many', 'jokes', 'problems', 'too', 'damned', 'rushed', 'quick', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'even', 'awesome', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'i', 'got', 'ta', 'Mr.', 'Haley', 'did', 'great', 'performance', 'new', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'nothing', 'will', 'touch', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'immortal', 'performance', 'CGI', 'cheap', 'times', 'kills', 'are', 'kind', 'stale', 'i', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'did', 'alright', 'job', 'rebooting', 'series', 'Craven', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'Friday', '13th', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remakes', 'were', 'better.This', 'Blu-Ray', 'offers', 'flawless', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'would', 'see', 'theater', 'good', 'extras', 'featurette', 'Maniacal', 'Movie', 'Mode', 'feature', 'length', 'scenes', 'thing', 'watch', 'movie', 'additional', 'scenes', 'including', 'alternate', 'endings', 'footage', 'making', 'film']",N/A
1300445,AFMQYFRLTPAFB,B002ZG971U,johnny Rotten,"[4, 7]","Wow, some heated debate over this movie; and that's a good thing! I think the 2010 remake of the sacred 1984 masterpiece should stir up some controversy!To me the only sensible argument against this movie is that it could have been much more imaginative in terms of dreamworld spooks. In terms of kills and chills the remake hardly brings anything to the table which did not or could not have appeared in the 80s. Some haters are arguing that the remake is nothing but eye candy for modern audiences with ADD - I couldn't disagree more! Remake director Bayer seems to have made a point of NOT making this an eye candy action flick covered in CG goo.Ironically, the same haters also tend to argue that the remake was ""boring"" (Ok, so who has ADD now?) Again, I think the reason why the remake may seem boring to today's audiences (including members of the audience who grew up in the 80s) is that Bayer really avoided making this an xtreme gore fest/action flick like many recent horror releases.Instead, Bayer aimed at making a spooky, creepy, and rather subtle film, whose horror resides mostly in gradual revelation of suspense and sudden taunting flashes of horror, much as the original did. The movie is indeed relatively slow paced; the actors seem to wonder about and purposely seem tired because they haven't slept in days; the music is slow and quiet ... there's something strangely hypnotic about it all, and some people may interpret this as ""boring"", but I think Bayer did this very purposely in a movie that is, after all, about sleep and sleep deprivation. He sucks you into the dream world.Everyone has a right to their opinion regarding the new Krueger. Personally, I thought he was the genius of the film. And the new pedophilia theme is incredibly dark and well done. In this sense, it's better than the original IMO.The movie's not perfect. It has some badly executed scenes. Yet it also has it's truly haunting moments (i especially love the ""cave"" and the last battle), and there's nothing in it that's downright idiotic, as in all the corny sequels.

1300452,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B002ZG971U,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[4, 8]","This was a pretty bland forgettable movie while Wes Craven's New Nightmare took all the best stuff of the original & updated it I feel this remake took all the best stuff of the original & half @zz3d it. It stars Jakie Earle Hayley as Freddy Kruger. He's no Freddy Kruger readers & no I'm not saying Robert Englund was needed what would the point be of being in a remake in the same role you played 26 years ago. the rest of the cast to me was who's on The CW & MY Network TV. Kyle Gallner was the only actor that I found likeable & the only 1 that didn't look like they were pushing 30. Rooney Mara who plays Nancy Holbrook she can't hold a thumb nail to Heather Langenkamp I felt she was 1 dimensional  Katie Cassidy plays Kris who IMO was killed off to early Thomas Dekker who I liked in The Terminator Sarah Connor Chronicles plays Jessie & he should've been given more to do Kellen Lutz plays Dean. Platinum Dunes could've remade part 5 or 6 but decided to remake the original. You start off at this Diner this guy Dean who looks close to 30 than a 17, 18 or 19 year old in high school he's having dreams about Freddy Kruger & he's trying to tell his girl friend Kris who looks close to 30 about it she doesn't believe him. Freddy s*&iacute;ts his throat Nancy & Kris watch in horror remember the music & NOES has to flash at the right time even 5&6 got it right no it's bam Nightmare On Elm Street. So at Dean's funeral Kris sees herself as a little girl it's a sign of her past & plot points we could care less about. We have scene where Freddy comes out of the wall in Nancy's room & I agree with everybody it's bad CGI. Kris & Jessie are afraid of old Fred Kris is killed in the same fashion as Tina only with some real s*** CGI & a lot of shakey cam. Jessie is arrested like Rod not before he runs away like Forrest Gump ""Run Forrest Run Forrest "" lol. Well he's arrested like it's an episode of COPS. They redo the bath tube scene remember Freddy almost drowns Nancy here she's in a dream where it's snowing then we get some real unintentional humor Ol' Fred licks Nancy he says ""Ya wa always my favorite."" I had this song going through my head ""Baby your all that I want I'm finding it hard to believe were in H*n."" It might not be funny to yo but this movie was laughable. Quentin falls asleep in during swim class in the pool & has a dream about the parents burning Freddy this scene was in the trailer it was cringe worthy pre burnt Freddy sounds like Stuart from MAD TV ""I didn't dew nuthin."" When he runs out you have this bad CGI effect he looks like The Thing from Fantastic 4 while running twords Quentin it's in slow motion it reminded me of Alien vs Predator where The Predators are running in slow motion it looked like Bay Watch "" I'll be ready I'll BE READY!"" Something that was so stupid was these kids don't remember going to the same pre school & they don't remember the gardner no not Grounds Keeper Wille from the Simpson's. The fact they can't remember such tramatic experiences is what really hurt this movie I mean I think I would remember it. They took away the mystique of Freddy Kruger turned him into a standard stock killer. The fight in the Freddy's secret cave under the pre school is forgettable. Freddy borrows lines fom Freddy vs Jason then the line that made me almost ROFL was ""Ohh sounds like fuun."" I really  thought Chris Hanson was going to show up or Detective Stabbler from Law & Order SVU was going to show up Law & Order vs Freddy would've been better than this movie. The diector Samuel Bayer compared NOES to Twilight that's a huge mark against him then you talked a lot of s** to us fans seriously go back to directing Green Day videos your not David Fincher. Michael Bay was the producer he's really a hit or miss guy. I've heard some people say the acting was better than the original that might be true but the original had character that I cared about not wooden acting.  Oh I can't wait for the sequel that deals with the mental effects of part 1. I really wanted to like this movie but it's worse than part 5 & 6.",2,Pointless 4/10,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,4075,"['was', 'pretty', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'New', 'Nightmare', 'took', 'best', 'stuff', 'original', 'updated', 'feel', 'remake', 'took', 'best', 'stuff', 'original', 'half', '@', 'zz3d', 'Jakie', 'Earle', 'Hayley', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'readers', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'was', 'needed', 'what', 'would', 'point', 'be', 'being', 'remake', 'same', 'role', 'played', '26', 'years', 'ago', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'who', 'CW', 'MY', 'Network', 'TV', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'found', 'likeable', 'only', '1', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'were', 'pushing', '30', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'who', 'Nancy', 'Holbrook', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'thumb', 'nail', 'Heather', 'Langenkamp', 'felt', 'was', '1', 'dimensional', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'Kris', 'who', 'IMO', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'early', 'Thomas', 'Dekker', 'who', 'liked', 'Terminator', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'Chronicles', 'Jessie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'Kellen', 'Lutz', 'Dean', 'Platinum', 'Dunes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'remade', 'part', '5', '6', 'decided', 'remake', 'original', 'start', 'off', 'Diner', 'guy', 'Dean', 'who', 'close', '30', '17', '18', '19', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'having', 'dreams', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'trying', 'tell', 'girl', 'friend', 'Kris', 'who', 'close', '30', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Freddy', 's*', 'iacute', 'ts', 'throat', 'Nancy', 'Kris', 'watch', 'horror', 'remember', 'music', 'NOES', 'flash', 'right', 'time', 'even', '5', '6', 'got', 'right', 'bam', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'So', 'Dean', 'funeral', 'Kris', 'little', 'girl', 'sign', 'past', 'plot', 'points', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'about', 'have', 'scene', 'where', 'Freddy', 'wall', 'Nancy', 'room', 'agree', 'everybody', 'bad', 'CGI', 'Kris', 'Jessie', 'are', 'afraid', 'old', 'Fred', 'Kris', 'killed', 'same', 'fashion', 'Tina', 'only', 'real', 's***', 'CGI', 'lot', 'shakey', 'cam', 'Jessie', 'arrested', 'Rod', 'not', 'away', 'like', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Run', 'Forrest', 'Run', 'Forrest', 'lol', 'Well', 'arrested', 'episode', 'COPS', 'redo', 'bath', 'tube', 'scene', 'remember', 'Freddy', 'almost', 'Nancy', 'here', 'dream', 'where', 'snowing', 'then', 'get', 'real', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'Ol', 'Fred', 'licks', 'Nancy', 'Ya', 'wa', 'always', 'favorite', 'had', 'song', 'going', 'head', 'Baby', 'want', ""'m"", 'finding', 'hard', 'believe', 'were', 'H*n.', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'funny', 'yo', 'movie', 'was', 'laughable', 'Quentin', 'asleep', 'swim', 'class', 'pool', 'dream', 'parents', 'burning', 'Freddy', 'scene', 'was', 'trailer', 'was', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'pre', 'burnt', 'Freddy', 'Stuart', 'MAD', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'dew', 'nuthin', 'When', 'out', 'have', 'bad', 'CGI', 'effect', 'Thing', 'Fantastic', '4', 'running', 'twords', 'Quentin', 'slow', 'motion', 'reminded', 'Alien', 'vs', 'Predator', 'where', 'Predators', 'are', 'running', 'slow', 'motion', 'looked', 'Bay', 'Watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ready', ""'ll"", 'BE', 'READY', 'Something', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'was', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'going', 'same', 'pre', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'gardner', 'not', 'Keeper', 'Wille', 'Simpson', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'such', 'tramatic', 'experiences', 'what', 'really', 'hurt', 'movie', 'mean', 'think', 'would', 'remember', 'took', 'away', 'mystique', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'turned', 'standard', 'stock', 'killer', 'fight', 'Freddy', 'secret', 'cave', 'pre', 'school', 'forgettable', 'Freddy', 'lines', 'fom', 'Freddy', 'vs', 'Jason', 'then', 'line', 'made', 'almost', 'ROFL', 'was', 'Ohh', 'fuun', 'really', 'thought', 'Chris', 'Hanson', 'was', 'going', 'show', 'up', 'Detective', 'Stabbler', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'was', 'going', 'show', 'up', 'Law', 'Order', 'vs', 'Freddy', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'diector', 'Samuel', 'Bayer', 'compared', 'NOES', 'Twilight', 'huge', 'mark', 'then', 'talked', 'lot', 's**', 'fans', 'seriously', 'go', 'back', 'directing', 'Green', 'Day', 'videos', 'not', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'was', 'producer', 'really', 'hit', 'miss', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'original', 'had', 'character', 'cared', 'not', 'wooden', 'acting', 'Oh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'sequel', 'deals', 'mental', 'effects', 'part', '1', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'worse', 'part', '5', '6']",N/A
1300453,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B002ZG971U,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 4]","Over the past several years, director/producer Michael Bay's production company, Platinum Dunes, has attempted to breathe new life into old, stale horror franchises. After tackling Leatherface (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), the horrors in Amityville (""The Amityville Horror""), and Jason Voorhees (""Friday the 13th""); it was only a matter of time before Freddy Krueger was given his re-imagined due.""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" follows a group of teenagers whose dreams are being invaded by a mysterious, disfigured man named Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley). One by one the teens are killed within their dreams, while simultaneously dying in the real world. As time is running out, those still alive soon discover that they all share a common dark secret from their past that not only links them to each other, but Freddy as well.Like virtually every other horror franchise launched in the eighties, Wes Craven's original installment, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", was easily the best the series ever had to offer. And as was the case with all of those other franchises, with each subsequent entry any quality this series may have once held was fast becoming nothing more than a distant memory.To be honest, I was never all that impressed by this particular horror franchise to begin with. So, the fact that the sequels became worse as the years went by didn't really bother me one bit. However, it was quite obvious that by the series' final entry, 1994's ""New Nightmare"", Freddy had lost his menace, and had devolved into a shadow of what he had once been.Despite my lack of interest or enjoyment in the original franchise, like his fellow slashers before him (Jason, Leatherface, and Michael), the only way he could feasibly continue his grisly misdeeds (aside from Direct-to-DVD), would be to reboot/re-imagine the character and his story for a new generation of horror fans. This is exactly what director Samuel Bayer (best known for music videos) and screenwriters Wesley Strick (""Cape Fear"") and Eric Heisserer set out to do.With this updated look at the venerable horror icon, the writers did away with or changed numerous franchise staples in order to take the series back to its darker roots. No longer does Freddy let loose with one-liners from his apparently extensive repertoire of gallows humor. Nor does he really toy with his victims in their dreams; instead, he knows that at a moments notice they could awaken and spoil his plans. Thus, Freddy now dispenses with his prey in as expedient and savage a manner as possible.Plus, Freddy's disfigured appearance is no longer as grotesquely stylized, so to speak, but is much more realistic and menacing than ever before. Granted this is more to do with the make-up artist than the writers; however, the make-up would have to take its cue from somewhere.As for the story, unlike 2009's re-imagining of ""Friday the 13th"" which essentially distilled all of the high points from the original series into one movie, this one seeks to basically remake the original Wes Craven film. The main plot points are generally the same as before, but the writing is somewhat improved upon and the characters don't seem nearly as annoying in nature. Plus, the circumstances surrounding Freddy's appearance and his link to the teenagers are much more chilling than in his original background story.Even though the story is an improvement over what has come before, the movie still seems to stumble about and feel repetitive in some places. Part of this is the result of the story taking too long to establish exactly what is driving Freddy to kill and why he has targeted these particular teens. And even though this is a remake, I wonder why the writers chose to recreate many of the scares and kills we had already seen in the original film?I understand showcasing one or two of the memorable scenes, but not almost every single one of them. Because of this repetition from the original, the whole thing started to feel far too predictable after awhile. Just like with Rob Zombie's first ""Halloween"" remake, once the movie got past the original backstory element that Zombie had created, the movie became a replay of everything we've seen before. However, unlike that film, this remake actually packed much more intensity and terror into the reused scares and death sequences from the original. So, even though it was rehashing what we'd seen before, at least it was more effective this time around. But, even so, that still wasn't enough.Anyway, moving along... Now, let's look at the fodder thrown Freddy's way over the course of the movie. The cast of actors and actresses chosen to portray the various teenagers being hunted by Freddy were average at best. A few of them did show some potential such as Kyle Gallner (TV's ""Smallville"") and Rooney Mara (""The Social Network""). These young actors had a fairly solid chemistry together, and out of the entire group of teens they seemed the most genuine and invested in their roles. That being said, they still came across as flat throughout many scenes.Then there's Thomas Dekker, who tries his level best to play the bad boy of the group, but he instead comes off as distant, clich&eacute;d, and above all bored with the role. Personally, I never thought Thomas was all that good of an actor on TV's ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", but I thought maybe he would have improved in the time since its cancellation. Apparently not, mediocrity must just be his strong suit. But, I digress.Let us be honest though, with this type of movie most viewers don't really give too much of a care towards the prey, they're always more interested in the predator hunting them. This statement proves to be even more applicable when it comes to the legends of the genre.So, how does Jackie Earle Haley handle filling in Robert Englund's striped sweater and razor-fingered glove? To put it simply, he is terrifyingly perfect for the role. Jackie breaks out his surprisingly gruff, guttural voice, reminiscent of what he used as Rorschach in ""Watchmen"", to chilling effect. From each anger-filled word he utters, movement he makes, and deadly action he takes, every second of his portrayal is teeming with evil and malice. Forget Robert Englund, there's a new Freddy in town (I'm sure that statement will draw some ire from the more hardcore fans, but oh well).After 26 years and seven movies (eight if you count ""Freddy Vs Jason""), finally we have a Freddy Krueger that I believe can truly instill fear into his audience. While this movie has its fair share of problems plaguing it along the way, there is some potential to be found here. Perhaps a sequel, not tied directly to the original series, will allow this rebooted franchise to really cut loose.""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is rated R for grisly violence, disturbing images, and language.",3,Freddy's Back and More Evil Than Ever Before...,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,6840,"['past', 'several', 'years', 'director/producer', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'production', 'company',

1300454,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B002ZG971U,K. Driscoll,"[11, 14]","2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street is the ninth film to feature the iconic horror villain/anti-hero, Freddy Krueger, but here he is played by the intense character actor Jackie Earle Haley (who played Rorschach in 2009's epic comic book film TheWatchmen) instead of the hokier antics of Robert England, who shone through his burned face make-up like Max Shrek did as the title character in 1922'sNosferatu.  Still, Haley brings some surprising chops to the table and his demeanor coupled with his booming low-toned voice and crackling laughter make for a satisfactory performance.  Freddy is also great visually as his prosthetic face and make-up seem much more realistic and are even at times enhanced by some seamless CGI by the same artists who brought us Two Face's look in 2008'sThe Dark Knight. Nice work overall actually in specifically bringing this new generation a solid Freddy, but beware as the compliments end there and the complaints I have for this Michael Bay produced rubbish are legion.Last I checked Rotten Tomatoes has this film with a 2% fresh rating, one of the lowest ever and for a film with a loyal fanbase this is a horrible sign.  This movie is almost that bad and perhaps the worst I've sat through in a theater in a very very long time.  The previews are deceptive and I'm tempted to just assume quality and original visuals were expected for only about two minutes of actual footage, just enough to get a big pay day for two or three weekends at the box office and then the hardcore horror fans will fund a sequel with their blind acceptance of low-quality filth like this.  The movie is a series of predictable jump scares between long suspense formulas and very weak dialogue delivered with little confidence from its young cast.  Occasionally after some jump scares we will see a character interact with Freddy but more often than not even that seems implausibly dull.  I mean come on, Freddy is a guy who lives in the dreamworld where he can manipulate reality at will and physically injure or even kill those who enter his realm.  He must have something more to say than just tired and effortless horror movie cliches combined with deep growls and sinister laughs.This is a hugely disappointing movie but I should have known better than to get my hopes up.  Theoriginalis about 3% this film's budget (granted it was made 25 years ago) but spent its pennies wisely on tricky and creepy visuals and brutal gore at just the right moments.  It used some of the same things used here in the remake in regards to the music and sounds, but the decisions as to where to place them were in the right hands then and the cast was hungry and talented enough to bring an original screenplay the passion it asked for.  Listen, the original film is one of the greatest horror films ever made and its director Wes Craven is, at least in my opinion, the best horror film maker of all time, so this remake may have just surrendered to the fact that it couldn't equal the original no matter what, so why even pretend?

I think it's the best horror classic remake ever. Freddy is scarier and more evil than ever. The acting, special effects, and plot consistency is better than the old films. This is kind of like the 1st 3 Freddy movies jammed into 1. The 1 thing that the old films had on this one is the creepy atmosphere. They old films were darker, and had a very chilling vibe. This movie doesn't have the same visual and mental creepiness. I think that the quality of the recording being less advanced had a lot to do with that.

If this weren't a remake of an even more popular film then it would be just another been there, done that fiasco.  The original film gave Johnny Depp his start.  There doesn't seem to be anyone in this film that is on their way to the kind of career that he's had, but then again let's give it time.  His career took off immediately and this film is already a few years old.  The actors in this are your typical pretty boy and pretty girl where your job is to just look pretty on screen and we don't care if you can act.  Unfortunately, audiences are much smarter than filmmakers believe and want a character to be convincing.  The actor, Kyle Gallner, seems to be the only actor in this that demonstrates a bit of depth with weak material to begin with.  Jackie Earle Haley spends the entire film with his face hidden under a burned mask as the new Freddie Krueger.  He brings ominous tones to the character with stale one liners from this stale script.  People will be soon wishing the old Freddie with his hideous face and comic timing were back that Robert Englund brought to fame almost effortlessly.  The other problem this movie does is it reveals a more horrific past involving Freddie Krueger and the teens he's gutting one by one.  The more the film starts to reveal Freddie's history the less scary the movie starts becoming.  The movie is okay and that's merely because it's another one on the bedpost ad to the series.

I knew this movie wouldn't be much like the originals, but I wasn't expecting to be quite this disappointed. I've always liked Jackie Haley's other movies, and I can see why they cast him as Freddy (he's played a nut case, he's played an alleged child molester...seems like a reasonable choice). His performance was okay, but the plot's focus on Krueger's human life (as a disturbed gardener working at the local preschool) made this movie feel a little more like a drama about childhood sexual abuse than a fun slasher film for a Friday night. To be honest, the horror elements that were included weren't even all that scary.There's very little here for old-school fans to enjoy. The opening scene has a little of the classic cheesy green and red lighting, the ""Freddy"" keyboard riff is in there once or twice, and those pale 6 year-olds still skip rope from time to time, but that's about it. Haley's performance simply lacks the humor, personality, and overall presence of Englund's. There are none of the funny puns, and the writer's didn't bother to come up with any of the inventive methods for off-ing the poor children of Elm Street that the old Freddy was so known for.The new Freddy speaks in moody monotone, makes a few uncomfortable references to acts of child molestation, and cuts people up.

Haley does save the film from being completely unwatchable. The budget was too high for such a bland product (I wonder where the $27 million went).

I was thinking of maybe starting with a positive thought or two, then going to the negative, but there's honestly NOTHING good about this movie.  The new character who plays Freddie is awful.  He looks like the kid from that movie Mask.  Just really, really bizarre looking.  I spent more time analyzing how weird his face looks, than anything else.The casting for this movie was miserable, the storyline was predictable, bland and boring.  Jeez, I don't even know what else I can write.  If you haven't seen this movie, don't even waste your time.  It's probably up there in the Top 5 WORST Horror Movies I've ever seen.  Maybe even Top 3.The many 1 and 2 star reviews on here seem to be the only things telling the truth.  I've read a few respectable 3-star reviews as well, but the 4 and 5-star reviews are off their rockers! There's no way this is anything above a 2-star movie.  I personally think it's as 1-star as a movie can get, but I can see giving it an extra star or something, because you love the concept of Freddy Kreuger.

I don't need to go into the story, we all know where Freddy came from and why he is who he is.In the original screenplay by Wes Craven, Mr. Krueger was a child molester and murdere as he felt that was the most evil thing he could think of for someone to be able to harm a child. This was changed to just murderer because he didn't want people to think he was cashing in on a series of molestation charges happening in California during the production of the film. But it could easily be implied that Freddy also touched children in inapropriate ways given the way he talks to his victims. Freddy has always been creepy and disturbinhg to his victims right before he kills them. The claw could still be relevant as he may have used it as more of a way to scare the children before touching them (some people do get off on the fear of others as it will make them feel more powerful), and then after dying and becoming an evil dream spirit he decided that this tool would be best used to actually kill. There were some interesting ideas in the film that sadly didn't get developed great, such as the micro napping. Honestly I thought that was a cool concept as it meant Freddy could've attacked you at any moment. The biggest downfall was that the cast wasn't super enthusiastic (but you could also blame the writing for that) and the deaths were pretty standard with Freddy just slashing or stabbing or something (this is a guy who's killed video game style and making one guy into a marionette), but Haley did a great job. Yes he wasn't as comedic at times as Freddy, but he does do some teasing with his victims before killing them. Also I love the moment where he tells one character that thay have six more minutes to play before his brain loses all function, that could've easily been said by Rober Englund. Some liked the idea that Freddy was innocent and just a mad spirit, but I like Freddy being evil, that's the Freddy we all know and love to be scared of.So overall this is most likely a movie that you'd be better off renting and not owning like the original films, but it really is worth a look in certain aspects.",3,"Jackie Earl ""Rorschach"" Haley makes the film worth seeing",1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,2543,"['How', 'ratings', 'work:5', 'really', 'liked/loved', 'it4', 'liked', 'it3', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'look2', 'Just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential1', 'Simply', 'awfulIt', 'true', 'film', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'remake', 'been', 'par', 'original.But', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'giving', 'movie', 'least', '3', 'stars', 'maybe', '2.5', 'superb', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Jackie', 'Earl', 'Haley', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'story', 'know', 'where', 'Freddy', 'came', 'why', 'who', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Mr.', 'Krueger', 'was', 'child', 'molester', 'murdere', 'felt', 'was', 'most', 'evil', 'thing', 'could', 'think', 'someone', 'be', 'able', 'harm', 'child', 'was', 'changed', 'just', 'murderer', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'cashing', 'series', 'molestation', 'charges', 'happening', 'California', 'production', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'implied', 'Freddy', 'also', 'touched', 'children', 'inapropriate', 'ways', 'given', 'way', 'victims', 'Freddy', 'always', 'been', 'creepy', 'disturbinhg', 'victims', 'right', 'claw', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'relevant', 'may', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'way', 'scare', 'children', 'touching', 'people', 'do', 'get', 'off', 'fear', 'others', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'powerful', 'then', 'dying', 'becoming', 'evil', 'dream', 'spirit', 'decided', 'tool', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'used', 'actually', 'kill', 'were', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'film', 'sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'developed', 'great', 'such', 'micro', 'napping', 'Honestly', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'concept', 'meant', 'Freddy', 'could', ""'ve"", 'attacked', 'moment', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'was', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'super', 'enthusiastic', 'could', 'also', 'blame', 'writing', 'deaths', 'were', 'pretty', 'standard', 'Freddy', 'just', 'slashing', 'stabbing', 'something', 'guy', 'who', 'killed', 'video', 'game', 'style', 'making', 'one', 'guy', 'marionette', 'Haley', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'was', ""n't"", 'comedic', 'times', 'Freddy', 'do', 'teasing', 'victims', 'killing', 'Also', 'love', 'moment', 'where', 'one', 'character', 'thay', 'have', 'six', 'more', 'minutes', 'play', 'brain', 'function', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', 'said', 'Rober', 'Englund', 'liked', 'idea', 'Freddy', 'was', 'innocent', 'just', 'mad', 'spirit', 'like', 'Freddy', 'being', 'evil', 'Freddy', 'know', 'love', 'be', 'scared', 'of.So', 'overall', 'most', 'likely', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'renting', 'not', 'owning', 'original', 'films', 'really', 'look', 'certain', 'aspects']",N/A

If you compare this movie to the original while watching then you're going to end up losing some of the story line. I really liked this take on Freddy Krueger and, personally, I love 1984 film. However, I couldn't sit there and compare as I watched this one. 1984, 2010; These are two completely different years and films!I'm giving it four stars because it did have a few minor flaws in the acting and maybe some of the writing here and there. However, this doesn't make it a bad film. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing it again or even adding it to my library. For the most part, the digital effects were good, the story line was good, the acting seemed to flow pretty well, and the make up effects were good too.If you're going to watch this film, don't compare it to the original. This isn't Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp or 1984. This is Jackie Earle Hayley as Freddy Krueger in 2010. But I do like the fact that Robert Shaye was one of the executive producers, as well as it being a New Line Cinema production and keeping just a hint of the original music. A few nice touches! I recommend giving it a shot. Only try and block out the 1984 film the best way you can.

I suppose if you look over the previous films, the whole tie together of the series may not have all joined together, they made new rules for each installment, up until about the 5th movie; so when someone comes along saying they wanna kick start the franchise, you expect there will be both positive and negative vibes about it from fans.Now after seeing this, all I can say is, it would have been better to have just left the thing alone. First off, Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy did not work, both look and voice. If you have come to expect a certain character to look and sound a certain way, why change it? I'm not trying to sound like I hate the idea that Robert England wasn't Freddy, but at least TRY to somewhat take a few lessons and mimic a few things. If TCM and FT13th didn't screw with the look of the main characters, then I might have accepted a different voice to Freddy, but the look of him in this reminded me of one of those albino alien things with long white hair in Stargate Atlantis.Imagine if the ""Dukes Of Hazzard"" re-boot (yeah i know it wasn't a good movie either) changed the ""General Lee"" into a 2005 Toyota Carola, painted it pink and had ""Love Machine"" written on the sides of it. I may be over exaggerating a bit, but you get the point; why mess with what works and downgrade it to something stupid?Then the new plot of the whole thing seemed to be futile. What was the point of this whole thing? They re-tell the story, but just about every decent kill scene is a copy of what was in the original.... just done with CGI to make it look more updated... but they had no new ideas? At no point in this movie did I see or feel anything that would ""scare"" an audience, and I highly doubt that this is going to find a new generation of viewers, as NOES has never gone out of style, and isn't the relic old 80's movie people in Hollyweed want to make it out to be.Overall, the thing was watchable from start to finish, so i wont rate it a 0 or 1, but I have no intention of seeing this travesty again, so I can't give it 3, so it only get's 2 stars from me. It's decent to watch once, but don't expect something that is going to blow you away and make you see the NOEM films in a brand new way...

That is the nature of recreating a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street, and more importantly a character like Freddy.  If the whole idea of changing anything around from the original movies is like sacrilege to you the don't even bother with this.  If you can accept that there are changes to the story and the characters than this, while not as good as the original movie, is still better than some of the cheesier sequels to the original movie.This is not a shot for shot remake of the original, nor is it another sequel.  It is a retelling of the original story, that pays homage to some of what we saw in the first film, but does tell a different version of the story.  There is more given to Freddy's back story than just the fact that he was a child murder that was told in the original movie.  His origin is much more fleshed out in this movie.  Secondly they have dropped the one liners and jokes out of Freddy (for the most part) and he is much more the boogy man like character he was in the first movie.  While it is definitely weird not to hear Robert Englund's voice, the fact that they were making Freddy even darker in this movie than in most of the other sequels to the original movie made me accept Jackie Earle Haley in that role more.Pretty much all of the teenager characters (and even the parents) in this movie were different than the original.  Although some had the same names, this version of Nancy was totally different, the role of her father (played by John Saxon in the original film) was omitted all together, and some totally new characters were added.  It takes a while to get used to the changes in the story and the characters although as I said some of the shots from the original movie (like the glove coming up between her legs in the bathtub, the dragging across the ceiling, Freddy's shape materializing from the wall) do appear.As far as extras go, there are several behind the scenes and making of features.

1300481,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B002ZG971U,Monkdude,"[3, 5]","For starters, this movie is getting way too many negative reviews. It's a horror remake, so by nature they're suppose to be inferior to the originals and in most cases, they flat out stink. The Thing and The Fly are the only horror remakes that come to mind that were much better than the original versions. Now saying that, I liked the stupid Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes more than I had any right to. I know they are far from great, but at least they go the true slasher horror route by having iconic villains and plenty of gore. How did the Prom Night remake ever make it to theaters? Yuck!Back to A Nightmare on Elm Street. How to replace the actor behind one of the coolest looking and most iconic horror villains ever created? The glove with four knives, the dirty red and green sweater, the Indiana Jones hat, and the horrific, yet fascinating look of his burned and melted face. Let me just simply say that I really liked Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger. From the time I first heard of his casting, I had a feeling they were making the right choice. Little Children, Watchmen and Shutter Island all showcased a different type of crazy. I know a lot of people are split on this issue, but as much as I can only think of Robert Englund in the part, JEH managed to give us the most mean-spirited Freddy yet. He dishes out a few funny one liners, but his intent is always to torment and kill. The make-up grew on me. I still like the old look better, but I'm glad they changed things up a bit in this version by having it look more like a realistic burn victim. I also liked the deep and hateful tone of his voice. Robert is still the man, but at least they got the second best option in Jackie. The rest of the cast are your typical ""teens"" that you will find in most horror films, but this crop had a couple of familiar faces (I recognized Thomas Dekker from Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and Katie Cassidy from her one season on Supernatural) and they avoided a lot of the typical stupidity found in this genre. The new girl who played Nancy was okay, then again I was never a big fan of Heather Langenkamp's portrayal either.The CGI is kept to a minimum which is almost always a plus. Some of the dream sequence shots, like when a classroom full of kids turns to ash or when a pharmacy goes in and out of the dream world, looked incredible, while others, like when Freddy pushes through the wall over a sleeping girl's bed, looked better in 1984. The music score was decent, mainly because they mixed in some of the original theme here and there. I also liked the oldie song that played over the end credits. The ""Dream, dream, dream"" fit it like a glove (no pun intended). The cheese factor of the original is also avoided here. Some of the acting and dialogue, even in the first and best film of the series, is pretty painful to watch. You won't get Nancy building her Home Alone traps in under ten minutes. The one major aspect that has been improved upon in this version is the ending. The way that the original film ended still doesn't make any sense. Even Wes Craven himself had other ideas that were rejected. The final 30 seconds of this remake not only features one of the best visual shots, but the best kill as well.Now, get ready for my negative remarks. I didn't like the fact that they turned Freddy from a child killer to a pedophile. True, both are the scum of the Earth, but I didn't like that they actually showed the backstory here. It had more of an impact when we just imagined what he was capable of in that boiler room. I will give this movie credit for at least making the change to a sexual predator relevant to why he is after these certain teens. If he were just the Freddy of old and killing them off back in the day, this angle wouldn't have worked. The dream sequences and kills also could have been much more elaborate. They recycled a bit more than they should have. The glove coming out of the bathtub was okay to keep, but the flying on the ceiling death should have be changed to something new. At least they didn't throw in Johnny Depp's blood geiser demise. The movie's pacing is also slow in certain spots. Oh, and there are way too many jump scares.A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) is better than most of the sequels to that creative hit back in 1984. It ranks among the best of the recent horror remakes and it will probably end up in my Blu-ray collection, but I like most people, want something more unique than half copies of the older classics.Edit: Well, as of right now, it's going to be #1 this weekend with upwards of 30 million dollars.

No one can take the role away from Robert Englund, but Haley is certainly disturbing in the role.The film is easy to watch and follows the original story for the most part.

1300487,A3GFP6QUQH8DRN,B002ZG971U,"Mr. Loco ""follow me at twitter @locdasmoke""","[83, 97]","OK, so let me start off here by letting you guys know that I grew up watching the original series in the 80's and have been a fan ever since. There's not one single Freddy movie I dislike, not even the cheesy ones, because I think they all brought something new and interesting to the table. Now with that said, what did I think about the remake? Well before going to see this movie, I had absolutely zero expectations knowing that Englund wasn't going to be in it and knowing that the back story of Freddy had changed. When I got out of the theater and the movie was over, I found it entertaining, but not close to being as good as the originals. I liked Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of Freddy and I think he did a good job as the new Freddy and I hope they continue using him if they make a sequel.Now What I didn't like was that the movie felt very rushed, none of the characters really made an impression on me before they got killed and I don't even remember any of their names except for Nancy's and the girl who played her wasn't even close to being as believable as Heather Langencamp from the original. One more thing that I didn't like was the change of Freddy's back story. In this movie Freddy use to be a pedophile and after the parents found out they gathered together and chased him down and burned him alive, which makes little sense... Most of the time when something terrible like this happens, people call the cops, but here they just went to kill him right away and yes it is understandable that one would want to kill a sick guy like that, but let's be real, 9 times out of 10 these sickos end up in jail (even though most people would love to kill somebody who had done something terrible like this and I'm a father myself and I know if something that terrible happened to my kid I would definitely want to see him dead). Anyway now to the original back story, in the original, Freddy was a sick child killer who molested and used various types of razor gloves to torture his children before killing them and the town gave him the name ""The Springwood Slasher"". After a while, the cops finally catch him and arrest him without reading him his rights which is the reason the court had to drop the case and let Freddy go. After the case was dismissed on this technicality the parents and Springwood Police join together and hunt Freddy down and burn him alive. Now IMO that back story makes way more sense and they even mention where the glove comes from, but in this one they've changed the back story so much that the glove doesn't even fit in, it doesn't make any sense what so ever! What the hell was Samuel Bayer and Michael Bay thinking when they approved this script as the official one[...]The movie had a few good kills, and Freddy was cool, but the characters were so threadbare that you don't even really care. If they do make a sequel, they need to go back in to the backstory again and bring back the Springwood Slasher and they need a better script!!

All the tension of the slasher genre is gone.  There is nothing left that remains unknown or unexpected.  With that said, this movie tried the best it possibly could, and it works for the most part.  Robert Englund, who played Freddy for 20 years, has been given a well-deserved break.  But the problem with all this rebooting of franchises is simply this question: What's the point?  How many more times can we see Freddy horrifically mutilate somebody in their sleep and remain properly horrified?  The answer is none. I myself am not scared in the least by blood and guts, though I was as a kid.  Now as a mature adult, I have not nessesarily become desensitized to it, I just have seen past the illusion and realized what I'm looking at is fake.  The violence in half these movies is so over the top, it loses all sense of realism.  The thing that scared me most of Freddy was the ingenious(and frightening)make-up.  The makeup on this Freddy looks like crap.  He looks like he has a mound of clay on his face.  And the coming out of the wall scene-- please!  When you can accomplish better effects with spandex and lighting(which is how the old was accomplished) that is truly pathetic. But one thing I do appreciate about this movie is the fact that it established Freddy once again as a scary character.  Although threatening in the 1st film, he had all but digressed into a bumbling oaf, who said way too many wisecracks.  It's not like he was humorless in the first movie, but there was a limit to his macabre sense of humor, and this movie finally realized where the line was drawn, and did it effectively.  To sum up, not a bad movie, but I believe the franchise needs to be put to rest.

This remake had one STRONG thing going against it before it was even released and that was obviously the fact that Robert Englund was not gonna be Freddy anymore meaning that for the first time ever we would have to see another actor assume the iconic role. And i have to say that although i had very low expectations going into this movie, I found myself able to make it through this movie hell i even thought it was good in some areas! What i found good about this remake is that Freddy's backstory was explained a lot more here than in the 1984 original and Freddy is a much darker and more sadistic character here than he was in ANY of the original films as he's not a child killer but a child molester [which WAS Wes Craven's original idea for the character]. And for the most part, The acting here is pretty good [especially by Haley and Rooney]. However there was obviously some flaws as the actors who played Freddy's second and third victims were no good and they unfortunately took up the first half of the movie which hindered the movie a little bit but after they're both killed off the movie gets a WHOLE LOT better! And the biggest flaw of them all is that Freddy's demise near the end is VERY lackluster [which ultimately causes me not to rate this movie higher]. While not as entertaining as the 1984 original, This remake does offer a few thrills and this is better than many of the sequels that the original film spawned. Plus you have to admit that although Robert Englund is greatly missed as Freddy, Jackie Earle Haley done a good job with playing Freddy here.

1300491,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B002ZG971U,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[4, 5]","The only possible reason I can see for anyone wanting to remake a classic horror film likeA Nightmare on Elm Streetis to take the core concept and make it bigger, more shocking, more strange.  To take advantage of advances in special effects to build upon and expand the possibilities of the original concept.  Maybe, in this case, to take advantage of the fact that in a nightmare things that couldn't possibly be real can seem nevertheless eerily familiar.  Maybe to pull off something along the lines ofInception, that forces the viewer to ask at every moment whether what they're seeing is real, but to play it for terror, much more dark and unsettling.They didn't do that here.  Rather, they took the original story, watered it down a bit, took all the fun out of it, and hired a new crop of teenage actors and told them to act like they were barely awake.  (My wife and I picked it because we really wanted to see something scary - as it turns out I could barely stay awake).  They used the same kinds of special effects, just done with CGI this time - plus a shot that's become almost cliche in horror films lately: the scary man coming through the wall and stretching the wallpaper eerily.  (I think there must be a tutorial about how to do that one on the web somewhere and several CGI geeks have memorized it, to plug in whenever they get hired on a scary movie.)  Then they sapped the life out of Freddy Krueger and made him simply mean and angry, a pathetic loser high on power.  I always thought of the original Freddy as something of an evil clown - who took a perverse delight in fright.  He was someone you loved to hate, because he was fun to watch.  This Freddy's just perverse, even pathetic if he weren't so violent.  There's very little of the ""cat and mouse"" delight of the original.  When he ends up cutting to the chase and killing, it's like he got bored - and who can blame him since the teenagers he's hunting were written to be pretty uninteresting.  I don't blame that on Jackie Earle Haley, since he pulled off a similar (though more sympathetic) role brilliantly inWatchmen(actually, his role here is almost exactly a more creepy and sadistic version of a mix between his role in Watchmen and his role inLittle Children).  It's just that the writing and direction here was uninspired.The look of the film, too - apart from a couple of intense effects - felt more like a grimy television special.  Wes Craven has an eye for color and settings, and knows how to compose a shot so it's got something interesting about it.  Here the daylight scenes were bland, and the nightmare sequences were marked off by a color cast in the light or by extra grunge in the settings.  The cutting was uneven in its pacing, and the camera movements were cliched.  Someone told the cinematographer, for example, that rotating around the characters in nearly every scene with more than one person somehow adds to its intensity.  That shot can be very effective, when used sparingly and for a specific purpose.  Here it felt just like they used it when they couldn't think of a better way to shoot a given scene.  Two stars for a couple of memorable and slightly scary scenes in an otherwise uninspired and lifeless remake.",2,"A Nightmare on Lame Street - lifeless remake of a film that didn't need one, and managed to sap the scary fun out of Krueger",1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,3232,"['only', 'possible', 'reason', 'can', 'see', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'remake', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'likeA', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Streetis', 'take', 'core', 'concept', 'make', 'bigger', 'more', 'shocking', 'more', 'strange', 'take', 'advantage', 'advances', 'special', 'effects', 'build', 'upon', 'expand', 'possibilities', 'original', 'concept', 'Maybe', 'case', 'take', 'advantage', 'fact', 'nightmare', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'real', 'can', 'seem', 'nevertheless', 'eerily', 'familiar', 'Maybe', 'pull', 'off', 'something', 'lines', 'ofInception', 'viewer', 'ask', 'moment', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'real', 'play', 'terror', 'much', 'more', 'dark', 'unsettling.They', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'here', 'Rather', 'took', 'original', 'story', 'watered', 'down', 'bit', 'took', 'fun', 'hired', 'new', 'crop', 'teenage', 'actors', 'told', 'act', 'were', 'barely', 'awake', 'wife', 'picked', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'scary', 'out', 'could', 'barely', 'stay', 'awake', 'used', 'same', 'kinds', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'done', 'CGI', 'time', 'shot', 'become', 'almost', 'cliche', 'horror', 'films', 'lately', 'scary', 'man', 'coming', 'wall', 'stretching', 'wallpaper', 'eerily', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'tutorial', 'how', 'do', 'one', 'web', 'somewhere', 'several', 'CGI', 'geeks', 'have', 'memorized', 'plug', 'whenever', 'get', 'hired', 'scary', 'movie', 'Then', 'sapped', 'life', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'made', 'simply', 'mean', 'angry', 'pathetic', 'loser', 'high', 'power', 'always', 'thought', 'original', 'Freddy', 'something', 'evil', 'clown', 'who', 'took', 'perverse', 'delight', 'fright', 'was', 'someone', 'loved', 'hate', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'Freddy', 'just', 'perverse', 'even', 'pathetic', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'violent', 'very', 'little', 'cat', 'mouse', 'delight', 'original', 'When', 'up', 'cutting', 'chase', 'killing', 'got', 'bored', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'teenagers', 'hunting', 'were', 'written', 'be', 'pretty', 'uninteresting', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'pulled', 'off', 'similar', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'role', 'brilliantly', 'inWatchmen', 'actually', 'role', 'here', 'almost', 'exactly', 'more', 'creepy', 'sadistic', 'version', 'mix', 'role', 'Watchmen', 'role', 'inLittle', 'Children', 'just', 'writing', 'direction', 'here', 'was', 'uninspired.The', 'look', 'film', 'too', 'apart', 'couple', 'intense', 'effects', 'felt', 'more', 'grimy', 'television', 'special', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'eye', 'color', 'settings', 'how', 'compose', 'shot', 'got', 'something', 'interesting', 'Here', 'daylight', 'scenes', 'were', 'bland', 'nightmare', 'sequences', 'were', 'marked', 'off', 'color', 'cast', 'light', 'extra', 'grunge', 'settings', 'cutting', 'was', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'camera', 'movements', 'were', 'cliched', 'Someone', 'told', 'cinematographer', 'example', 'rotating', 'characters', 'nearly', 'scene', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'somehow', 'intensity', 'shot', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'when', 'used', 'sparingly', 'specific', 'purpose', 'Here', 'felt', 'just', 'used', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'way', 'shoot', 'given', 'scene', 'Two', 'stars', 'couple', 'memorable', 'slightly', 'scary', 'scenes', 'otherwise', 'uninspired', 'lifeless', 'remake']",N/A

Adding onto the movie's storyline of a manic taking revenge on the people who destoryed him through their children's dreams.Isn't that a good concept?  A specture entering one's own dreams to prey on their fears.  Ultimately those nightmares consumes the vitcim, killing them in their own dreams; leaving no trace of the killer.I was excited about the prospect to say the least. The concept of dreams have always fascinated me because they are, in effect, our own desires, fears, emotions, and needs all wrapped up into a visual scene that our mind makes real.  It doesn't matter, in our dreams, if we are able to fly; it is what we are dreaming that we are doing.  The dream doesn't have to be ""realistic"" because it is our own needs at the very basic level of understanding, what Freud would say is our own ""ID"".  Psychology, Morality, Ethics, stregnths, weaknesses, and our mind's ability to create are all there in our dreams.

Admit it people - Freddy has never been scary.  He almost was in the original, but after that, he's been a joke.  Why do people go so nuts for him?  ""Welcome to Prime Time, bitch?""  NOT scary (nor particularly clever, no offense to Robert Englund, who I like).  But this Freddy is a bad, bad man.  He's creepy, he's evil, and he looks like someone who wants to hurt you.  This is the movie that the original should have been.  The production is great, the dream sequences are nicely done, the acting is solid, and it's got Clancy Brown, man! - what more could you ask for?  And for a story about a guy who kills you in your dreams, it actually makes a lot more sense than the original did.  And for once, the extras really do add to the experience.  The alternate opening and ending are worth the price of admission (the opening being quite short, but a neat take on it).

This is one of those cases.For all intents and purposes, this 2010 remake of ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a thousand times better than the original. In all honesty, Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors was far better than the original, and others were far more interesting. So when they went back to remake the original, what came out of it exactly?A way better movie. The special effects are better, the acting is better, and Freddy is very menancing. His make-up is truly terrifying, which is more akin to real burn victims, a horrifying image you may never get out of you rhead. Jackie Earl Haley nails the role with a new side brought to it. Yet he still brings us some amusing lines that many know and love Krueger for, like ""You have nothing to worry about, this won't hurt one little bit,"" or ""Your girlfriends calling, I'll be back,"" or even a guy saying ""Oh god,"" and he says ""No, just me."" So yes, he can sound more scary, create more scares and thrills.I am a huge fan of Nightmare On Elm Street and Robert Englund, but this movie is a great addition to the long running series. I still vote Dream Warriors and Dream Master as the best, but I would put this on at number three.That said, there was one little thing that annoyed me. Everyone's dreams are the same, nobody seems to have their own dreams, because we all know nobodies dreams are the same.

1300504,A39W3263A9HCMN,B002ZG971U,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[11, 16]","WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWHollywood loves remaking things these days. In fact, that's an understatement. EVERYTHING is being remade nowadays. Coming later in the year, Alexandre Aja, the king of remakes, will be releasing his take on ""Pirhana"" in 3D, as well as Robert Rodriguez's take of ""Predator"". Is Hollywood running out of ideas? In some aspects, yes. A Nightmare remake was in the talks as far back as 2007. Obviously Robert Englund was too old for the role of Freddy, as his swan song was in ""Freddy Vs. Jason"". However, rumours that Jackie Earle Haley was going to be the new Freddy were spreading when Watchmen got released... and those rumours are true.A Nightmare on Elm Street, directed by Sam Bayer is a remake of a movie by Wes Craven, to state the obvious. The original movie spawned an entire franchise of seven sequels. I took a liking to it when I saw Freddy Vs. Jason when it got released on DVD, and, well, at the time I liked it. I hadn't seen a single Jason movie before, nor did I ever see a single Freddy. I have since seen every Nightmare on Elm Street movie, and I was excited to go see this movie today.So, did I like it? Well, I'll be honest: Unfortunately, it was just average at best.The movie starts off well. Dean is in a diner, falling asleep, and he wants some coffee. He sees the waitress go back to the kitchen and ignore him, so he goes back and finds weird stuff. What he doesn't know is that Freddy's near. So like seen in the trailer, he turns the corner and BAM, Freddy's there, and he slices his hand. He wakes up, and is threatened by Nancy to be thrown out. He looks at his hand and BAM, there's a cut. After a conversation between Quentin, Jesse and another dude, in an ordeal over Dean and Kris, Dean falls asleep again, and bam, Freddy's there, and he forces Dean to slice his own throat open. Bam!!! Good way to start the movie.As with back in 1984, the movie focuses on Nancy, a teenage girl who goes to school and works at a diner. After the death of Dean, Freddy Krueger, once a gardener who abused children and was burned to death by the parents of those children, starts appearing in all of their dreams. However, not all of them survive their nightmares. Quentin and Nancy are brought together after both of Kris and Jesse are killed by Freddy Krueger in their dreams, and then start to notice that Freddy is in their dreams too. However, they are both the next target on Freddy's list. United by this fact, both of them go to solve the mystery surrounding the deaths. However, Freddy's especially headed for Nancy because she told her parents about her abuse. They then try to make one bold move: Stop Freddy for once and for all.Now first off, I didn't actually hate this movie at all. I mean, it was gorgeously shot, and had some good, eerie, creepy moments. Jackie Earle Haley is pure cash money with every performance he gives, and he continues to prove so here. He can do no wrong. If anything, I think his Freddy may be even creepier than Englund's. His creepy Rorschach-meets-Englund voice definitely sent shivers down my spine. I definitely think this guy deserves more credit. Also turning in a great performance was Kyle Gallner, and I usually don't like that kid. Here he breaks away from his usual role as a sexual neurotic and plays a teenage kid who, as soon as Freddy comes for him, pops pills and drinks Red Bull to keep him awake. Also, I gotta say I did enjoy the fight scene and the ""gotcha"" ending.However though, where my concerns is... well... pretty much everything else. My biggest gripes are the characterization, script, and pacing. The characters were just plain empty. Of the teenagers, I only liked Quentin. Nancy was a pretty BAD character here. It could also be due to Rooney's acting. She was so wooden that I kept expecting Freddy to come and make a wooden stake out of one of her arms. Kris and Jesse are both killed off before I get the chance to have any connection to them, but while that worked in the original 1984 classic because it was not only scary but also provided the ""anything can happen"" motto, here their characters were so empty and bland.Pacing is also another issue. The movie is really rushed and poorly edited- none of the scenes have any real ""flow"" to them. Some scenes end before they even begin. There's one creepy, tense moment where Kris is in a nightmare, and she enters her house, to walk by a room to find three girls playing Skiprope and singing the ""One, two, Freddy's coming for you"" song, then Freddy says ""Ready or not here I come"", then launches for her. That scene was a whole lot of buildup to an ending of a scene so quick that I went ""Whoa"". The movie's pacing is really odd- the first third is incredibly rushed, then the second third slows it down a bit, then it speeds up towards the end, then just... ends. As well as the writing and dialogue range from ""mediocre"" to ""AWFUL"". Thankfully Freddy isn't stuck with lame and cheesy puns like in ""The Dream CHild"", but some of the dialogue is just BAD. And I don't mean Advent Children English Dub bad.It isn't totally awful, like I said. It had some good creepy moments, was gorgeously shot had good performances from Haley and Gallner, and a good fight scene at the end. But unfortunately, Platinum Dunes and Michael Bay has laid their curse again upon the horror Franchise, and in the end, I was left disappointed.",2,"One, Two, Michael Bay's coming for

Unlike some I really didn't see the fault on the choice of the actor who played Freddy actually he's the only one in the movie beside one or two other background characters who did very well in his role as the new generation Freddy.  The major problem other then the flat script was the apathetic and talentless acting ability from cast who were picked to play the main teenager characters in the movie especially the one for Nancy.Unlike the 80's version I had no empathy for any of these characters,mostly I was rooting Freddy on whenever he took one of them out as that way we didn't have to listen to anymore of their atrocious acting throughout the rest of the movie with the exception being the survivors unfortunately.  The new background angle plot the writers did on the character of Freddy was inventive but they also left a lot of it either purposefully or forgetfully vague in other areas.  If you're a fan of the original NOES I say stick with that it don't bother with this horrific remake but if you're still curious and for what the price it's going for right now I'd say give it a shot just keep the expectations of the movie very very very low.",1,Makes the Top Five As One Of The Worst Remakes Ever Yet,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,1371,"['could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'reboot', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'series', 'just', 'fell', 'so', 'flat', 'bland', 'actors/actresses', 'directing', 'just', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'disappointment', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'fault', 'choice', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Freddy', 'actually', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'background', 'characters', 'who', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'role', 'new', 'generation', 'Freddy', 'major', 'problem', 'other', 'then', 'flat', 'script', 'was', 'apathetic', 'talentless', 'acting', 'ability', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'picked', 'play', 'main', 'teenager', 'characters', 'movie', 'especially', 'one', 'Nancy.Unlike', '80', 'version', 'had', 'empathy', 'characters', 'mostly', 'was', 'rooting', 'Freddy', 'whenever', 'took', 'one', 'out', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'listen', 'anymore', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'rest', 'movie', 'exception', 'being', 'survivors', 'unfortunately', 'new', 'background', 'angle', 'plot', 'writers', 'did', 'character', 'Freddy', 'was', 'inventive', 'also', 'left', 'lot', 'purposefully', 'forgetfully', 'vague', 'other', 'areas', ""'re"", 'fan', 'original', 'NOES', 'say', 'stick', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'horrific', 'remake', ""'re"", 'still', 'curious', 'what', 'price', 'going', 'right', 'now', ""'d"", 'say', 'give', 'shot', 'just', 'keep', 'expectations', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'low']",N/A
1300506,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B002ZG971U,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[2, 2]","I'm honestly not sure why they bothered to make this movie.It's not that this new take of Wes Craven's classic 'Nightmare on Elm Street' is bad. It's well-made, polished and dark and gleaming, and has some truly memorable scenes. There's a scene in a supermarket, flickering in and out of dreams, that I found particularly effective and well-done.But here's the thing - it's not very engaging, it's not very funny, and it's not very scary.The original 'Nightmare on Elm Street' had a lot going for it - an unforgettable villain played by the irreplacable Robert Englund, a vicious sense of humor, a striking visual style, a willingness to go for the jugular, and Johnny Depp in his first major film role. Most importantly, it had originality and the power to take us by surprise. For its time, it was something new.The new 2010 remake has some of these things. It still has Freddy Krueger (now played by Jackie Earle Haley), though somehow defanged and less frightening. The cinematography is dark and gritty in ways we've seen a lot these days - effective but not very distinctive. It's gory but not over the top.The new 'Nightmare' tells essentially the same story as the original - revenge exacted from beyond the grave in the dream world, blending dreams and reality until its hard, though not impossible, to tell the difference. But with subtle shifts in tone and detail, the story in the updated version just doesn't pack the punch of the original. A few scenes use shots clearly lifted directly from the original, to good effect, while a couple of the most shocking moments from the original are missed sorely here.On the downside, the updated 'Nightmare' takes itself too seriously and it definitely doesn't have Johnny Depp.More to the point, it's not something new anymore. The body count racks up fairly quickly and predictably. At no point did it surprise me, not even the supposedly ""shock"" ending. Freddy's one-liners fall flat and there's no character (not even the new, emotionally-challenged Nancy) that makes you root for them. Scream queen or murderer, they're all expendable.Taken on its own, the 2010 'Nightmare on Elm Street' isn't bad - it's a by-the-numbers horror movie with a few standout moments. It just falls far short of its namesake.Put simply, it's no 'Nightmare.'",3,Four Slashings and a Funeral,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,2296,"[""'m"", 'honestly', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'bothered', 'make', 'movie.It', 'not', 'new', 'take', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'classic', ""'Nightmare"", 'Elm', 'Street', 'bad', 'well-made', 'polished', 'dark', 'gleaming', 'truly', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'scene', 'supermarket', 'flickering', 'dreams', 'found', 'particularly', 'effective', 'well-done.But', 'here', 'thing', 'not', 'very', 'engaging', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'not', 'very', 'scary.The', 'original', ""'Nightmare"", 'Elm', 'Street', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'unforgettable', 'villain', 'played', 'irreplacable', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'vicious', 'sense', 'humor', 'striking', 'visual', 'style', 'willingness', 'go', 'jugular', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'role', 'Most', 'importantly', 'had', 'originality', 'power', 'take', 'surprise', 'time', 'was', 'something', 'new.The', 'new', '2010', 'remake', 'things', 'still', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'now', 'played', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'somehow', 'defanged', 'less', 'frightening', 'cinematography', 'dark', 'gritty', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'days', 'effective', 'not', 'very', 'distinctive', 'gory', 'not', 'top.The', 'new', ""'Nightmare"", 'tells', 'essentially', 'same', 'story', 'original', 'revenge', 'exacted', 'grave', 'dream', 'world', 'blending', 'dreams', 'reality', 'hard', 'not', 'impossible', 'tell', 'difference', 'subtle', 'shifts', 'tone', 'detail', 'story', 'updated', 'version', 'just', ""n't"", 'pack', 'punch', 'original', 'few', 'scenes', 'use', 'shots', 'clearly', 'lifted', 'directly', 'original', 'good', 'effect', 'couple', 'most', 'shocking', 'moments', 'original', 'are', 'missed', 'sorely', 'here.On', 'downside', 'updated', ""'Nightmare"", 'too', 'seriously', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'have', 'Johnny', 'Depp.More', 'point', 'not', 'something', 'new', 'anymore', 'body', 'count', 'up', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'predictably', 'point', 'did', 'surprise', 'not', 'even', 'supposedly', 'shock', 'ending', 'Freddy', 'one-liners', 'fall', 'flat', 'character', 'not', 'even', 'new', 'emotionally-challenged', 'Nancy', 'root', 'Scream', 'queen', 'murderer', ""'re"", 'expendable.Taken', 'own', '2010', ""'Nightmare"", 'Elm', 'Street', ""n't"", 'bad', 'by-the-numbers', 'horror', 'movie', 'few', 'standout', 'moments', 'just', 'far', 'short', 'namesake.Put', 'simply', ""'Nightmare""]",N/A
1300507,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B002ZG971U,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","I picked this up on a blind buy because the premise sounded interesting and I knew it was a remake of a popular horror series. I wasn't expecting much from the movie, but this was another series that many talk about that I felt I should see. Once I finished viewing the movie I was found myself surprised at how much I enjoyed it.While the movie didn't make me nervous, like with the Scream movies I got extremely nervous for the characters.At first it was hard for me to figure out why I felt concern towards the main cast, but then I realized it was for the same reasons I liked the main characters in the movie The Invisible, in that they all appear to be have some personal demons within themselves (guilt, relationship problems, popular but isn't satisfied with life, labled a nerd on medication, simply feels different from others) that make them feel and act as if they are appart from the normal social world. As someone who isn't perticually great at social interaction and has had many dark periods where I distanced myself from others, I identified with the five teenagers to a degree.Freddie, surprisingly turned out to be a villain I enjoyed, once I knew his true purpose and really helped give the film a dark and desperate tone.As the film unfolded I grew to enjoy everything about it (the detective work, the twist, the film's tone, how much the movie made want to see the characters overcome Freddie) and once the ending occured I left feeling as if I had seen a well done movie and a desire to check out some of the other popular horror films.However I do have a couple of complaints. (SPOILERS FROM HERE ON SO STAY AWAY).First the romance that is hinted at between Quintin and Nancy, I see them as the characters that appeared to know each other the least, before the film, although I do feel they knew each other well. Two I honestly want to know more about these characters backgrounds and personalities (what we got was good, but I want to know more). Finally I feel as if the ending could've been better.While I did expect something like the twist ending we did get, I don't like Freddie appearing out of picture and killing someone, that's incocnsistent with the rest of the movie. And it was someone who he really didn't have a connection with. Had the last kill been Quintin I would be fine more ok with it. Also I feel the alternate ending with Nacny killing Freddie with the axe was better as she would've overcome Freddie in everyway.So on the whole I really enjoyed this movie but realize it does have some flaws.

1300508,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002ZG971U,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","A Nightmare on Elm Street (Samuel Bayer, 2010)Let me first say, people, that if you're going to take your rugrats to a non-family-oriented film, please duct tape their mouths shut before you leave the house. I'm not entirely sure why you're taking four-year-olds to see a movie that you are well aware will be awash in gore, but hey, that's your decision. However, your right to treat your kids the way you want (and I'm not complaining about that, really; I've been introducing my own kid to horror classics her entire life) stops the second their talking, running in the aisles, and general buffoonery pisses off the rest of the (appropriately) adult audience.Okay, now on to the movie, about which that first paragraph had nothing to do, except for the probable fact that my enjoyment of the movie, what little there was of it, was dulled consistently by a particular bunch of siblings whose parents installed them in various seats around me (some behind me, some across the aisle). Thrilling. But as for the movie itself, the good news is that it's that rare Hollywood remake that isn't produced by Roy Lee, the new king of schlock. The bad news is, it's produced by Michael Bay. Whether the news that it's directed by music video mogul Samuel Bayer, who's directed some of the last quarter-century's iconic music videos (Marilyn Manson's ""Rock Is Dead"", Smashing Pumpkins' ""Bullet with Butterfly Wings"", and The Cranberries' ""Zombie"", among many others), is good or bad I'll leave up to the viewer to decide. I did go into it fearing I'd loathe it, but the presence of  Jackie Earle Haley (Watchmen, Shutter Island) and the recent extended trailer (which, I should mention, turns out to be the first two minutes of the film, with some of the dialogue cut out) resigned me to the fact that I was going to go see it anyway. And it wasn't as bad as I feared, not by a country mile, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped, either.If you've been in a cave for the past twenty-six years, here's a quick rundown of the plot, updated for 2010 audiences. Nancy (Youth in Revolt's Rooney Mara) is a waitress at a diner in a small town in Ohio (it could be anywhere, but we see that ""OH"" on a medical form at one point... which makes me wonder where in Ohio I can find a Powell's Books, because I wanna go!) that's the basic weekend teen hangout. As we open, Dean (teen heartthrob Kellan Lutz from the Twilight franchise) is sitting by his lonesome in one of the booths having one heckuva nightmare. You've seen it in the extended trailer, and it's one of the movie's most effective scenes. (It also pays sideways homage to Saw.) Nancy wakes him up just at the right moment, pours him more coffee, etc. He is then joined by Kris (Katie Cassidy, from the recent Melrose Place reboot), the ex-girlfriend of his pal Jesse (Thomas Dekker from Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles), and begins to spin her a rather fantastic tale about his nightmares. Except we know it's not fantastic; Dean came back from that nightmare with a slash across his palm. Fast-forward a bit and Quentin (Kyle Gallner, whose presence in the horrific Jennifer's Body does nothing to mitigate his excellence in such films as Red and The Haunting in Connecticut), who's sitting facing Dean's booth, points out to Jesse that Kris has just joined Dean, leading to (a) Jesse storming out, (b) us finding out that Quentin is mooning over Nancy but is too shy to ask her out, and (c) us finding out that Nancy is something of a school outcast. (Guess which one of these things becomes important later on in the movie--and which one makes the ending utterly predictable?) The diner scene ends in violence that I think is supposed to be shocking, but after the diner scene in Legion--the only good thing about that movie--it just comes off as kind of depressing. In any case, fast-forward another bit, and we find out that all the principals we met in that first scene are having nightmares about this guy, who of course turns out to be Freddy Kruger (Haley, who for some reason the make-up artists decided to make resemble Ron Perlman as much as they could). The movie then becomes a race to find out how to get rid of Freddy before the whole batch ends up mincemeat.A lot of folks are calling this a reboot, but there were enough scenes in it that mirrored the original that it struck me as a remake, and in places where it deviated, there were some interesting replacements. For example, the infamous Johnny Depp ""Death Bed"" scene is missing, but is replaced with a very, very cool effect that's almost the reverse of it. And as far as cool effects go, the movie is chock full of 'em. It's also got a decent number of jump-in-your-seat moments (though be warned, I'm sure they won't have the same effect on the small screen). Some of the acting is rather good; Gallner makes the best of the material, and Mara's not bad at all, but the others are shallow, cardboard characters. (If this was done intentionally, to mirror, say, the two-dimensionality of Jsu Garcia's character in the original, it's brilliant. Otherwise, it's usual Hollywood silliness. Once again, I'll let you be the judge.) And that's about as far as can be said about the good things in this movie.The bad things start out with what has become a major debate raging across the Internet, and that has to do with the character of Freddy Kruger himself. It's been raging for at least twenty years now, and it has to do with whether you prefer the nasty, dirty, ugly Freddy from the first two movies or the slick quipmaster who replaced him starting with Dream Warriors. To me, it's relatively simple: the first two movies were good because Freddy was actually kinda scary. (And I admit to a great fondness for Dream Warriors in no small part because of quipmaster-Freddy... but also because Patricia Arquette is a serious babe.) After that, the franchise stopped even trying to be horror, and became slasher comedies. Here, Bayer and the legion who worked on the screenplay (IMDB reports that at least fifteen drafts of the screenplay were written during development, and that the finished product is a hybrid of four of them) take Freddy's character from point A to point Z all in one film, and the effect can be a bit disconcerting. At the beginning, he's very much the dingy creeper, and by the end he's dropping one-liners the way Donald Trump drops dandruff. Problem is, in the transition to quipmaster-Freddy, they didn't clean his image up any. In fact, this new Freddy is a lot darker and uglier. Which is kind of odd to say about a melted pedophile, but it seemed that after a while, the original franchise used the pedophile angle as a reason to have Freddy killing teenagers more than anything, and they turned the guy into some sort of warped, lovable uncle figure. (Cue Alfie's Home here.) This team went back to the roots with the character, and takes a much longer look at the pedophile angle. (There's a great plot twist halfway through that could have made this movie so much more than it is, but it unravels towards the end.) And thus the cognitive disjunct when Freddy's lines start evoking nervous laughter form the audience while the crew are still ramping up the gore content. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the unsettling nature of all this (as, say, A. O. Scott did in his review); your stock melted-pedophile serial killer should be unsettling. I'm not sure, however, that the way in which he's unsettling is entirely successful, and that's because Bayer and co. were bringing in the aspects that made Freddy mainstream in the first place. Being unsettling by being the opposite of unsettling... you see my confusion here.I've spent way too much time on that point and not left myself room for the rest of the bad stuff, so I'll point out in passing that the lack of development in a number of what should have been principal characters left me thinking that they existed solely to cater to fans of the original series who were expecting those characters to be reprised. That never fails to annoy me. And it doesn't matter how many drafts of the script you come up with if they all suck; there were some wonderful ideas here (the time limit is awesome; that was the bit from the original trailer that initially sparked my interest), but the prose in which they are rendered is flat and uninspiring at the best of times. Couple that with some flat-affect actors, and the whole thing, despite limitless potential and another fine turn from Haley, left me cold. **",2,"So close, and yet...",1273622400,"05 12,

I think we've deified some pretty poor film making in much the same way that we decide only our era of pop music was ""classic.""I remember loving the first NIGHTMARE in the theater, I was even on board for most of the cheesy sequels throughout the rest of that decade. I don't expect much whenever I see Michael Bay's name attached to a film, but the other names (Haley, Clancy Brown, the great Connie Britton) allowed me to imagine, if you will, a BATMAN BEGINS-style reinterpretation. Grittier, darker, with dream-making technology unavailable back in the Reagan days.The result, unfortunately, is just...meh. Turgid, one-dimensional characters plodding through a reality that seems no different from its nightmare counterpart (except for less atmospheric lighting).None of the actors are allowed to show anything approaching charm, likability, or even the vaguest sense of chemistry with their fellow cast mates. Surprisingly, Haley gets short-sheeted the most--his Freddy is given precious little to say or do (only glimpses of an animated, affectionate, still-very-much-alive Krueger give any sense of the empathetic sway he could have given the character--if the script and direction had displayed any ambition at all). I dare say his performance in LITTLE CHILDREN was a better NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET than this sad little number.What you're left with is a by-the-numbers homage, clicking off the necessary plot points and shout-outs (the kid who leaps through his girlfriend's window here is in no danger of becoming the next Johnny Depp). What meager thrills are to be had are lowest common denominator--the biggest ""innovation"" in this retelling would be the stage of sleep deprivation in which the hapless teens are popping in and out of sleep for the briefest of moments, but it's only in there so the director can ""gotcha"" shock the viewer every five minutes or so.Exactly the kind of schlock gimmicks they didn't need in the original.",1,The Cast Deserved A Better Movie,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,2015,"[""'m"", 'not', 'horror', 'purist', 'who', 'early', '80', 'B-movies', 'sacrosanct', 'think', ""'ve"", 'deified', 'pretty', 'poor', 'film', 'making', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'decide', 'only', 'era', 'pop', 'music', 'was', 'classic', 'remember', 'loving', 'first', 'NIGHTMARE', 'theater', 'was', 'even', 'board', 'most', 'cheesy', 'sequels', 'rest', 'decade', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'whenever', 'see', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'name', 'attached', 'film', 'other', 'names', 'Haley', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'great', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'allowed', 'imagine', 'will', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS-style', 'reinterpretation', 'Grittier', 'darker', 'dream-making', 'technology', 'unavailable', 'back', 'Reagan', 'days.The', 'result', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'meh', 'Turgid', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'plodding', 'reality', 'different', 'nightmare', 'counterpart', 'less', 'atmospheric', 'lighting', '.None', 'actors', 'are', 'allowed', 'show', 'anything', 'approaching', 'charm', 'likability', 'even', 'vaguest', 'sense', 'chemistry', 'fellow', 'cast', 'mates', 'Surprisingly', 'Haley', 'short-sheeted', 'most', 'Freddy', 'given', 'precious', 'little', 'say', 'do', 'only', 'animated', 'affectionate', 'still-very-much-alive', 'Krueger', 'give', 'sense', 'empathetic', 'sway', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'character', 'script', 'direction', 'had', 'displayed', 'ambition', 'dare', 'say', 'performance', 'LITTLE', 'CHILDREN', 'was', 'better', 'NIGHTMARE', 'ON', 'ELM', 'STREET', 'sad', 'little', ""'re"", 'left', 'by-the-numbers', 'homage', 'clicking', 'off', 'necessary', 'plot', 'points', 'shout-outs', 'kid', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'window', 'here', 'danger', 'becoming', 'next', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'What', 'meager', 'thrills', 'are', 'be', 'had', 'are', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'biggest', 'innovation', 'retelling', 'would', 'be', 'stage', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'hapless', 'teens', 'are', 'popping', 'sleep', 'briefest', 'moments', 'only', 'director', 'can', 'gotcha', 'shock', 'viewer', 'five', 'minutes', 'so.Exactly', 'kind', 'schlock', 'gimmicks', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'original']",N/A

I guess I don't understand what all the hoopla is about. It's not like it's a Godfather movie without Marlon Brando. The character of Freddy requires very little acting prowess.""Put this sweater on, wear this glove, and pop up around corners a lot and say boo.""That's why I feel like Jackie Earl Haley's talent was really wasted on this film. To be a good Freddy you really don't need to do much, so they might as well have brought Englund back or put some no name guy in his spot. I give props to Jackie though, he tries to do as much with the character as he can. The flashback scenes are well acted and are probably the only positive thing about this film.The fact is, I have never been a big fan of this franchise because the movies are innately redundant. Seeing as Freddy is limited to the dream world, the only way the kids will encounter him is if they fall asleep. So the whole movie replays the same scenarios out with each victim.Victim gets tired, victim tries not to fall asleep, victim falls asleep for a little bit and gets attacked and wakes up screaming, victim can no longer stay awake and falls asleep for good and dies. End of victim.Rinse and repeat.I get it that most horror movies are formulaic. A big reason why there are so few good horror movies. But the truth is, no horror movie is quite as formulaic as this one. Besides maybe the Saw movies...The movie tries to be clever with it and make you wonder if the person is sleeping or not. ""Oh my god, the doctor has a Freddy glove on, that means she's dreaming!"" In the end though, the movie is simply limited by what it can do. How they were able to pull out 5+ incarnations of this film still boggles my mind.If you're a fan of the originals...I guess you should give this one time.

One by one, he terrorizes them within their dreams--where the rules are his and the only way out is to wake up. But when one among them dies, they soon realize that what happens in their dreams happens for real and the only way to stay alive is to stay awake. Buried in their past is a debt that has just come due. To save themselves, they must plunge into the mind of the most twisted nightmare of all: Freddy Krueger. Jackie Earle Haley plays the legendary evildoer in this contemporary reimagining of the seminal horror classic.The consMan were do I start? This movie was boring in my opinion. I fell asleep at the movies watching it. I watched it again and was still bored. Jack Haley was a poor choice to play freddy. He doesn't bring any energy to the role at all. He doesn't even chase one person in the film. He says his lines like he's sleepy himself. He doesn't have a deep enough sounding voice for the character. It's sad that they copied so many part of the original film and made them inferior. I hated the make up they used for Freddy in this film. He looks like a frog to me. They changed the back story a bit and made him a child molester rather then a child killer. The original film had him getting arrested and getting off on a technicality. Here they don't even contact the police just burn dude up.They cut down the level of blood in the film. Watch the original and you'll see it's bloodier. I hated the cast of this film. Not one of them brought any energy to their roles. I didn't care if they got killed and their deaths were unremarkable. The back ground music was bland movie music that you could hear in any current film. The original had a much stronger back ground score playing during action scenes. I thought they were going with a younger because they wanted some body more energetic. Maybe they'd have Freddy running around chasing people down. This guys just walked around and talked to people a bit before stabbing them. They could have got Englund back to do what this guy did.The prosI like that they show how Freddy gets burn up rather than just talk about it like the original film. I liked a few scenes like the hall way of blood. The picture does have a dark atmosphere like the first film. At least they are trying to get back the the roots of the character.the conclusionI don't know who's rating this film so high here and why? Maybe they just love Freddy so much they will watch any Freddy related material. Maybe they just like Jackie Earle Haley. I don't know,but this was boring and unimaginative to me. I was really looking forward to this film,but was under whelmed by how average it was. This film could have really used Wes Craven directing it if you ask me.The general consensus from most people is that it sucked. Go to most sites and you see that it gets a low rating every time. This is the first place I've seen it get talked about in such glowing terms.Hope they do the sequel better and bring Craven in to direct it.

Jackie Earle Haley is a great actor but only Robert Englund can play Freddy Krueger. This is basically another weak attempt to make a few more bucks off of a slasher icon. So far, none of these has been perfect. Michael, Leatherface, Jason, and now Freddy have been altered for today's excessive gore over creative scares crowd and the results are like fast food. You forget about these as soon as you're done with them. This Freddy isn't as bad as some are saying. It's just nothing to brag about. The backstory has been tampered with in true Platinum Dunes fashion, the new victims aren't as interesting as the sacrifices from the golden era of slasher flicks, and the over the top bloodbaths become boring after awhile. I actually fell asleep during dream sequences and murder scenes. I'm so glad I didn't see this in a theater. I would have been in bad shape without the rewind button on my dvd player's remote. This is a decent time waster and nothing more. I know Robert Englund is older now but I'd love to see him return one more time for a Freddy vs. Jason 2 where our anti-heroes eventually end up joining forces against Pinhead and his minions from hell.

On the heels of the awesome remake ofFriday the 13th (Theatrical Cut)and the very solid Halloween remakes the old boy Sid decided to give A Nightmare on Elf Street and Freddy Kruger a shot.Back in the glory days of horror, Freddy was a big player on par with Jason and Michael Myers even though Sid would put him #3 on that list by far. After seeing the new Freddy he is currently #86 on the scary list, one place ahead ofThe Gingerdead Man. Of course we all know the story, Freddy kills people through their dreams. Pretty scary idea but it only works if the dream killer isn't gunning to be the king of the one liners Henny Youngman and if he isn't built like a jockey. Countless times we thought ""Dream me would beat the snot out of Freddy."" The execution of this one had the tantalyzing scent of a Full Moon production so obviously that created really b moments of the did they think nobody would notice that variety. A staple for enjoyable b. However, Jackie Earl Haley, mostly known for his roles as Kelly Leak and Steve Nash's stunt double, played Freddy. Right there the possibility for scares went out the window so despite some great b moments this was a boring flick.This movie needed to be really good to compete with the other horror remakes we've seen lately and it fell as short as The Reflections music career. Myers and Jason got scarier in the remakes and especially in Jason's case, by a lot. Freddy, on the other hand, was the Vachs of horror villians, supposed to be intimidating but just hilarious.

Nothing like it had ever even came close to being done.  So, to be fair to the 2010 version, I tried to keep in mind that because of my age at the time of the original, and Craven's brilliant, then new concept, I'd been impacted by an experience that could never be duplicated.  This accepted, I slid this remake into my player imagining I was watching the idea unfold for the first time.  I didn't want to compare, because it wouldn't be fair to the movie if I did.  It was watched optimistically and with an open mind.I was disappointed.Ups:The special effects are grand.  (There's a scene where Nancy drops from the ceiling in a blooming bulge of blood that was worth re-watching.)The cinematography is moody and precise; often beautiful, even.Haley plays Freddy well.  The burn application used on him was exceptional.  (Physically, the team nailed this massive upgrade.)And the kill scenes were pretty good.Downs:Freddy's voice.  Again, Haley did a great job, but they boomed! his voice up too much.  Dialogue between Freddy and Nancy just felt off to me.  Technically, I have no idea how to explain what I'm trying to reference here.  He just sounded so...boosted?  I realize he's supposed to be other-worldly, nightmarish, but I think I'd rather just listen to Haley project on his own.  He's certainly talented enough for it.  (Now that I think about it, this is a similar feeling I get when listening to Christian Bale's Batman growl-whisper.  Awkward.)The expanded plot concerning the parents' vigilante attack didn't really do it for me, either.  It wasn't BAD, like some people are screaming, just not that interesting.  I can't call it an enhancement, by any means.In the end, I think it just bored me.

1300536,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B002ZG971U,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[2, 5]","A Nightmare On Elm Street was originally released in 1984 and to this day remains one my favorite horror movies, it's a great classic slasher and it remains without a doubt the best of the series. I heard there would be a remake of the film about a year ago and of course I wanted to see it if not just to see if they would totally screw it up like many Hollywood remakes. I can say that while it doesn't really have that feel of a classic Freddy Krueger movie it's still pretty decent and the result is different and worth watching. If you've seen any ANOES before then you already know the story, Freddy stalks some teenagers in their dreams and kills most of them, he's constantly on their minds and as soon as they fall asleep he's there, when they're awake he's waiting. What they wanted to do with this remake was to bring the horror icon Freddy Krueger to a new generation.I feel this ""remake"" is hard to categorize because it's not entirely a true remake but I wouldn't consider it a re-imaging of the series either because it keeps the original aspects intact, they kept the story the same and played around with it but at the same time it ends up being a very different movie. It's not a traditional remake; kind of how Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" not quite the same as the original. Fans will find that this is not the same movie, for one thing the ""slasher"" aspect with body counts is pretty much gone in some way, yes there are many kills but it's not the same. This movie is much more psychological and focuses more on Freddy's story of how he came to be the monster he is terrorizing children and teenagers in their dreams. I found that was something great, to see how it all happened, we see the kids in the movie in preschool and Freddy as a human and the good times he had with children until he sexually abused them and the parents burned him which made him become who he is. They made Freddy creepier and less amusing, he's very much become a monster in order to scare the audiences better I think.This ANOES is more disturbing, I mentioned it's more psychological and that's true, I always thought killing people in their dream is great concept for a villain and that alone should be disturbing enough but this time it's even more. Some dream sequences and deaths are borrowed from the original movie as well as the music in the beginning, little girls with jump ropes and Freddy singing ""1,2..."". I feel this remake pays homage to the original one but brings up fresh things and that's what makes it a good movie in my opinion. As for being scared I did jump a few times and it was scary to me at many points, there were some great cinematic effects with the score, sounds and all.I'll give them credit for not ruining the franchise and not involving something stupid in the story, it all relates to A Nightmare On Elm Street and doesn't add anything that doesn't make sense, it sticks to the story. I think if I had never seen any of the ANOES movies I would probably have enjoyed it much more but I have to say this version does have its moments and turned out better than most of the remakes I've seen. If you're expecting too much out of this remake you will be disappointed because it's not the good old Nightmare, it's clearly different. What I think would have it better and perhaps more appreciated by fans of the original would have been if Robert Englud played the part of Krueger once again, I mean I don't see anyone doing Freddy other than him and he portrays this character to perfection. Jack Haley did an excellent job playing Krueger however and I thought his performance was really good, once again a little different from Englud's (there's no jokes like there used to be as they tried to make the character of Krueger much scarier) but still appreciable and I've got to give it to him he played some great roles in the past so he was a great choice for this movie.A Nightmare On Elm Street(2010) doesn't deserve a five star if you're a fan of the franchise or at least the first film, and it doesn't deserve a one star either because the movie turned out to be interesting, I'd say it's a little more in between for me with a three maybe three and a half pushing it a little.

1300541,AN7TIQWIXAQ79,B002ZG971U,W. Goring,"[5, 7]","`A Nightmare On Elm Street' circa 2010 suffers from a split personality. It's a remake of a modern horror classic, remade one presumes to utilize a known brand that not only attracts those familiar with it but also those who are not (Who are you by the way?). If this is true then our most dire fears are realised. Yes this remake, reimagining, homage whatever you may call it, exists solely to make money. There in lays the irony. How do you make money on a film that fans hold the very idea of in contempt and new comers are ever harder to impress? Poor Elm St. 2010 was off to a bad start long before it even hit the screens. While the casting of Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy garnered some approval it never seemed enough to give fans a good night's sleep. Nightmare creator Wes Craven was not only nowhere to be seen in relation to the production, it seemed that he was actually being majorly screwed over in regard to intellectual property. This definitely didn't sit well with his loyal fans, the same fans this new film would need the support of to be successful. Another flag was raised when Platinum Dunes, the makers of this new Nightmare released their take on Freddy's horror brethren Jason Voorhees. Friday The 13th 2009 was beyond terrible and the fate of Freddy in Platinum's hands looked less than hopeful.Jump ahead to evasive glimpses of the new Freddy online, so-so trailers, and the film finally hits screens. Despite opening at No.1 in the US and making twice its budget back in one weekend, the horror community, ready for a fight, pretty much unanimously wrote it off. Why? Well, here's where the film's continues it's somewhat fatal duality. The story is pretty much the same yet vastly different to its forbearer. There's still a girl called Nancy, she still has nightmares about a burnt man, she still takes a bath, her mother is again played by a bad actress and all her friends keep dying in their sleep. What's different? Pretty much everything else. It's no wonder Craven is not given a story credit. Names and motivations have changed. Characters are deleted (Nancy's father is nowhere to be seen but played a pivotal role in Craven's original). We are also introduced to the notion of micro-naps but most importantly it is made very clear what kind of monster this Freddy actually is where the original only claimed him as a killer. It seems this shaking up of elements from the original is what has upset fans so much, although, had this new film been a complete `faithful' replica of the original it would have likely been derided for that too. Which brings us back to the question of why. For money remember.Is this film unnecessary? Yes. Is it bad? No, not in my opinion. Though we pretty much know where the story is headed, I felt there were still surprises to be had. The story structure takes on more of a mystery solving rhythm as Nancy and her friends not only try to figure out what is happening to them but why they are all connected to each other. The acting is all quite good from the young cast though they are little over preened in appearance. The film is also quite threatening, which is a significant achievement considering we have lived with this character and concept for over 25 years. While the evil clowning of Robert Englund's Freddy is ever so slightly missed, Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy is much more of a monster, especially as this film at first makes you feel he is the victim and his dream stalking is in some way a justifiable revenge. Maybe the film does suffer a little from over rationalising. In an attempt to make the proceedings more real and less camp, some of the surreal creativity the series was known for has been sapped out. Pretty much every character has the same dream environment, though this is important to the `mystery' of the story. In all this rationalising of the story it isn't made clear why this Freddy would have his trademark glove. In the original he was a child killer and the glove was a self fashioned weapon of choice, which we see him construct in the opening sequence. Here, there is no real reason why Freddy would need the glove. We are not told he kills children, we never see him make the glove and we don't seem him use it for any specific reason during the flashbacks of the `living' Freddy Krueger. As this film is left open for a sequel in much the same way as the original was (I quite like how they did this) we may yet be given reason for the glove and some indulging in good old fashioned nightmare fantasy. Perhaps by finding more of a middle ground with the Elm St of the past, the Elm St of the future will be a road more fans care to visit.",3,Reoccurring Nightmare,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,4655,"['Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'circa', '2010', 'suffers', 'split', 'personality', 'remake', 'modern', 'horror', 'classic', 'remade', 'one', 'presumes', 'utilize', 'known', 'brand', 'not', 'only', 'familiar', 'also', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'Who', 'are', 'way', 'true', 'then', 'most', 'dire', 'fears', 'are', 'realised', 'Yes', 'remake', 'reimagining', 'homage', 'may', 'call', 'solely', 'make', 'money', 'irony', 'How', 'do', 'make', 'money', 'film', 'hold', 'very', 'idea', 'contempt', 'new', 'comers', 'are', 'ever', 'harder', 'impress', 'Poor', 'Elm', 'St.', '2010', 'was', 'off', 'bad', 'start', 'long', 'even', 'hit', 'screens', 'casting', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Freddy', 'garnered', 'approval', 'never', 'seemed', 'enough', 'give', 'fans', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'Nightmare', 'creator', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'relation', 'production', 'seemed', 'was', 'actually', 'being', 'majorly', 'screwed', 'regard', 'intellectual', 'property', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'loyal', 'fans', 'same', 'fans', 'new', 'film', 'would', 'need', 'support', 'be', 'successful', 'flag', 'was', 'raised', 'when', 'Platinum', 'Dunes', 'makers', 'new', 'Nightmare', 'released', 'take', 'Freddy', 'horror', 'brethren', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'Friday', '13th', '2009', 'was', 'terrible', 'fate', 'Freddy', 'Platinum', 'hands', 'looked', 'less', 'hopeful.Jump', 'ahead', 'evasive', 'glimpses', 'new', 'Freddy', 'online', 'so-so', 'trailers', 'film', 'finally', 'screens', 'opening', 'No.1', 'US', 'making', 'twice', 'budget', 'back', 'one', 'weekend', 'horror', 'community', 'ready', 'fight', 'pretty', 'much', 'unanimously', 'wrote', 'off', 'Why', 'Well', 'here', 'where', 'film', 'somewhat', 'fatal', 'duality', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'yet', 'vastly', 'different', 'forbearer', 'still', 'girl', 'called', 'Nancy', 'still', 'nightmares', 'burnt', 'man', 'still', 'bath', 'mother', 'again', 'played', 'bad', 'actress', 'friends', 'keep', 'dying', 'sleep', 'What', 'different', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'wonder', 'Craven', 'not', 'given', 'story', 'credit', 'Names', 'motivations', 'have', 'changed', 'Characters', 'are', 'deleted', 'Nancy', 'father', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'played', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Craven', 'original', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'notion', 'micro-naps', 'most', 'importantly', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'kind', 'monster', 'Freddy', 'actually', 'where', 'original', 'only', 'claimed', 'killer', 'shaking', 'elements', 'original', 'what', 'upset', 'fans', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'new', 'film', 'been', 'complete', 'faithful', 'replica', 'original', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'been', 'derided', 'too', 'Which', 'back', 'question', 'why', 'money', 'remember.Is', 'film', 'unnecessary', 'Yes', 'bad', 'No', 'not', 'opinion', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'headed', 'felt', 'were', 'still', 'be', 'had', 'story', 'structure', 'more', 'mystery', 'solving', 'rhythm', 'Nancy', 'friends', 'not', 'only', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'why', 'are', 'connected', 'other', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'young', 'cast', 'are', 'little', 'preened', 'appearance', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'threatening', 'significant', 'achievement', 'considering', 'have', 'lived', 'character', 'concept', '25', 'years', 'evil', 'clowning', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'Freddy', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'missed', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Freddy', 'much', 'more', 'monster', 'especially', 'film', 'first', 'feel', 'victim', 'dream', 'stalking', 'way', 'justifiable', 'revenge', 'Maybe', 'film', 'suffer', 'little', 'rationalising', 'attempt', 'make', 'proceedings', 'more', 'real', 'less', 'camp', 'surreal', 'creativity', 'series', 'was', 'known', 'been', 'sapped', 'out', 'Pretty', 'much', 'character', 'same', 'dream', 'environment', 'important', 'mystery', 'story', 'rationalising', 'story', ""n't"", 'made', 'clear', 'why', 'Freddy', 'would', 'have', 'trademark', 'glove', 'original', 'was', 'child', 'killer', 'glove', 'was', 'self', 'fashioned', 'choice', 'see', 'construct', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Here', 'real', 'reason', 'why', 'Freddy', 'would', 'need', 'glove', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'never', 'see', 'make', 'glove', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'use', 'specific', 'reason', 'flashbacks', 'living', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'film', 'left', 'open', 'sequel', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'original', 'was', 'quite', 'how', 'did', 'may', 'yet', 'be', 'given', 'reason', 'glove', 'indulging', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'nightmare', 'fantasy', 'Perhaps', 'finding', 'more', 'middle', 'ground', 'Elm', 'St', 'past', 'Elm', 'St', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'road', 'more', 'fans', 'care', 'visit']",N/A
1300542,A15U46ZENEHGTH,B002ZG971U,Wicked_Smaht,"[3, 4]","When all is said and done, this film is essentially for people who never heard of the original or find any film pre-2000 as passe or quaint. This remake (let's forget that the word ""reimagining"" ever existed) is a basic by-the-numbers retread of territory the previous entries have all explored and doesn't add anything new to the overall world of ""Nightmare"". Therein lies the problem - if you have nothing new to add to the series, then your entry becomes extraneous by default. And that's what this film is: just one big extraneous effort by nearly everyone involved. There's no reason to make this film and it shows in just about every decision made regarding it.Sure, it's easy to harp on the fact that Jackie Earle Haley is no Robert Englund, but it's a comparison that's just inevitable. Englund played Freddy throughout all the previous films and is largely responsible for making the character the icon that he is today. As great an actor as Haley is, there's no need for fans of Englund to fear that Englund will be usurped any time soon because Haley's version is just a washed-out, non-frightening remake of the film's major star. Haley is intense and does try hard, but the film doesn't try nearly as hard so it's all kind of a pointless effort in the long run. They do try to return Freddy to his more-frightening-than-funny roots, but the whole reason Freddy became his own one-man-wisecracking-slasher type was because the scariness of Freddy was already starting to wear thin by the third film. I agree that Freddy is best presented when he's presented as scary, but there is something to be said for Englund's obvious maniacal glee in performing what the character became in later years. All in all, Englund's character actor instincts wins out over the serious Academy Award nominated actor hands down. Who knew?So, without an interesting Freddy, what's left? Not much, apparently, as this film just retreads the best bits from previous films all to no real avail. There's an updated spinning-room effect (although they seemed to prefer actress-on-wires over room-on-gimble here), body bags in the school hallways make a reappearance and there's a few recycled lines from the original movie. There's so much unoriginality going on in here that it's hard to build up any sort of suspense whatsoever - it's all just a matter of counting the minutes before someone finally gets killed and, even then, it's a let-down because the hallmark of the series is also missing...Yes, we already discussed it's not an adequate Freddy on this go 'round, but the other thing missing is the surrealistic (sometimes disturbing, sometimes sickeningly clever) nightmares. The franchise became known for it's imagination regarding the eventual offing of its young cast, but this film avoids any sort of creativity and instead just gives you a few bad CGI moments and cliched camera tricks and - presto - that counts as a nightmare. Even on a shoestring budget, New Line was able to come up with some pretty crazy and highly imaginative set-pieces for its past nightmares and it seems to show the utter lack of interest that this film has in that it can't even muster up enough desire to show some sort of ingenuity in the nightmare department. If anything, today's technology should be able to help indulge in even the craziest of ideas, but sadly, it's all lacking here. It serves as a bit of interesting irony that even with the greatest of tools at their disposal to unleash the most insane corners of one's imagination, this film is dead-set on being as lethargic as possible. I guess ""reimagining"" is a bit of a misnomer since it appears everyone's imagination on this film is atrophied.Speaking of atrophied, how about the rest of that cast, huh? While I'm always glad to see Clancy Brown in just about anything, we see that he's no John Saxon here (a sentence I never thought I'd type). Clancy Brown is an awesome actor who can bring just as much intensity to a role as Haley, but here he's wasted as the town sherriff who seems to not have much to do besides chase his own kid all over town. Then there's Kyle Gallner as Quentin Smith - Kyle's pretty much a requisite standard on almost any modern day horror film, so his appearance here is not much of a surprise. Then there's Katie Cassidy as Kris - admittedly, she's very pretty to look at and her character dominates the beginning of the film, but since she's marginally interesting and such an improvement over Rooney Mara as Nancy, of course the filmmakers kill her off pretty quickly. And that leads us to Rooney Mara - our Nancy of this installment...What a letdown. Apparently, reimagining Nancy consists of making her uninteresting, unnecessary and really just sort of peripheral in the whole film. She's Freddy's favorite, but it's anyone's guess as to why. Mostly she just mopes through the film, draws some ""tortured"" art and seems to mumble a lot of her dialogue. You don't much really care for her and you don't have much invested in her, so you could really care less if she lives or dies throughout the whole venture. While there was so much debate over the casting of Freddy in this film, I guess there wasn't as much effort put towards figuring out why Heather Langenkamp's portrayal of Nancy worked in the original. In the original film, you don't really suspect Nancy to become a major player in the film, but she is there from nearly the beginning and once our attention turns towards her, we're with her till the end. This is a credit as much to Langenkamp's original portrayal as much as it is to Craven's deliberately subtle introduction of her. However, subtlety is also not allowed on this film, so instead we get a mumbling, doesn't-need-to-be-here character and that makes this film all the more frustrating to watch.I know, I know... At this point, you're going to complain and say I'm a fanboy and that if I don't like the remake, then I should just not watch it. To that I say: you're right. I enjoyed the original films and I have enough of a radar to know when I'm just not going to enjoy something, but I guess it just irritates/fascinates me that with all the input that goes into making a movie, you can still end up with one as seemingly DOA as this one is. You know how it is: if you see a good movie, you may tell one person; if you see a bad movie, you know you'll tell at least ten people. My hope is that this remake won't throw off people who were unimpressed by this movie and subsequently write-off the whole franchise. Sure, the original franchise made its own mistakes along the way as well, but there are some really creative sequences to be had and some really interesting ideas going on in the original films. The bottom line is: don't let the diluted nature of this remake sour your opinion on the whole idea. Even if you have to laugh at the overt 1984 nature of the original movie, I still guarantee you'll find a moment or two that's more distrubing than virtually everything you've seen in this movie.In the meantime, let's just say that if you haven't seen the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", don't worry... You're in good company because the people who made this film haven't seen it either...",2,"Watching This Boring Film Is Enough of a ""Nightmare""",1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,7212,"['When', 'said',
