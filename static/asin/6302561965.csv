320801,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6302561965,Alex Udvary,"[2, 3]","Many people see Chaplin's ""Limelight"" as a semiautobiography, while, true, there are similar traits among the characters, ""Limelight"" none-the-less is a very enjoyable piece of work by the ""king of comedy"". Written & Directed by Chaplin this is the story of a once great comedian who has come to a decline due to old age and drinking, but mostly drinking. He tells us he still has ideas. He wants desperately to make one big finally comeback. After that he can die a happy man. Through his suffering and feeling of worthlessness he meets a young women, Terry (Claire Bloom). She herself was once a dancer, who says she just simply can't dance anymore. She even tried killing herself. Which is how these two met. So basically, one man who seems to have little hope for the future convinces a women that great things will happen in the future. It could be seen basically as a story of rediscover in one's self. A lot of people...hate when Chaplin talks (preaches) about the meaning of life. They don't like to hear his ideas, they say it's over-dramatic. I don't know about that one. I think his words hit the right spot to make this a tragedy. It's as if Chaplin is crying out for help. All of the acting in this movie is nicely done from Chaplin and Bloom to Nigel Bruce (Postant) who plays an old friend of Calvero (Chaplin). The hightlight scene as we should all know by now is the last scene with Buster Keaton & Charlie Chaplin. A majority of people say that was Keaton's shining hour. Watch for yourself and see. It is said Chaplin deleted several minutes from that scene between them. If your a fan of strickly Chaplin's comedies like ""Modern Times"" and ""City Lights"" I think it's pretty safe to say you'll enjoy this movie.Now here's some trival for all of you big shots out there. Did you know that Claire Bloom was unavailable for some re-shoots for the movie? And at a certain scene (I'm not going to give it away) Chaplin's wife can be seen.",3,Chaplin's Last Film Made In America,948067200,"01 17, 2000",2000,1952,"['Many', 'people', 'see', 'Chaplin', 'Limelight', 'semiautobiography', 'true', 'are', 'similar', 'traits', 'characters', 'Limelight', 'none-the-less', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'piece', 'work', 'king', 'comedy', 'Written', 'Directed', 'Chaplin', 'story', 'once', 'great', 'comedian', 'who', 'come', 'decline', 'due', 'old', 'age', 'drinking', 'mostly', 'drinking', 'still', 'ideas', 'desperately', 'make', 'one', 'big', 'finally', 'comeback', 'can', 'die', 'happy', 'man', 'suffering', 'feeling', 'worthlessness', 'young', 'women', 'Terry', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'was', 'once', 'dancer', 'who', 'just', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'anymore', 'even', 'tried', 'killing', 'Which', 'how', 'two', 'met', 'So', 'basically', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'hope', 'future', 'women', 'great', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'future', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'basically', 'story', 'rediscover', 'one', 'self', 'lot', 'people', 'hate', 'when', 'Chaplin', 'talks', 'preaches', 'meaning', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'hear', 'ideas', 'say', 'over-dramatic', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'think', 'words', 'hit', 'right', 'spot', 'make', 'tragedy', 'Chaplin', 'crying', 'out', 'help', 'acting', 'movie', 'nicely', 'done', 'Chaplin', 'Bloom', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'Postant', 'who', 'old', 'friend', 'Calvero', 'Chaplin', 'hightlight', 'scene', 'should', 'know', 'now', 'last', 'scene', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'majority', 'people', 'say', 'was', 'Keaton', 'shining', 'hour', 'Watch', 'yourself', 'see', 'said', 'Chaplin', 'deleted', 'several', 'minutes', 'scene', 'fan', 'strickly', 'Chaplin', 'comedies', 'Modern', 'Times', 'City', 'Lights', 'think', 'pretty', 'safe', 'say', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie.Now', 'here', 'trival', 'big', 'shots', 'there', 'Did', 'know', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'was', 'unavailable', 're-shoots', 'movie', 'certain', 'scene', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'Chaplin', 'wife', 'can', 'be', 'seen']",N/A
320802,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6302561965,Andrew McCaffrey,"[46, 48]","LIMELIGHT must serve as the ultimate ""love it or hate it"" film.  If you fit into the ""hate it"" category, then you'll find this a silly, self-serving, self-indulgent, over-long piece of megalomania.  You may think of it as overly sentimental and possibly emotionally manipulative, with Chaplin pitying himself at every turn and pitching all his neuroses onto the big screen.  On the other hand, I absolutely adore it.  Sure, it's melodrama, but it's the purest and best form of melodrama.  It comes straight from Chaplin's heart and the autobiographical feel gives the sad moments just that much more of a kick.Set in London in 1914, the story and its characters are very simple.  An old music hall clown at the end of his career turns to alcoholism and a young ballerina loses her confidence and attempts suicide.  If that sounds depressing, you're right; and that's only the film's opening sequence.  The movie isn't an out and out downer though; it has its emotional highs and lows as the pair pursues the only thing that brings meaning to their lives -- the stage.  It's interesting to note that during the dream sequence where Calvero (Chaplin) performs alone, the audience disappears; when his dream places Terry (Claire Bloom) alongside him, the applause echoes.  And, of course, without Calvero to encourage her, the ballerina cannot perform.Odd to say this about a Chaplin film, but the dialog is marvelous.  It shouts out to be quoted, with Chaplin's character opining on everything up to and including the meaning of life.  Sure, it isn't realistic, but the speeches are great and fit in with the movie's bombastic attitude.It's the relationship between the young ballerina and the old clown that brings me back to this film.  The documentary touches on this briefly and raises the right questions.  Are they in love?  Can they be?  Are they fooling themselves as well as each other?  They both clearly need each other, but how self-destructive is the relationship?  Calvero tries to teach Terry to be optimistic while standing on the cliff of depression himself and Terry praises Calvero's abilities while unable to come to terms with her own.  The questions and contradictions make for a very thought-provoking experience.Much has been made about Buster Keaton's extended cameo near the film's conclusion.  I've read that during the filming Keaton was much funnier in their comedy scene together and Chaplin (being director) edited the result in such a way as to throw the spotlight back on himself.  I've also read denials that this ever happened, and I've even read that even if this were true, it makes sense in the context of how the film is progressing (Calvero being upstaged at this moment would have wrecked the whole point of the scene).  I honestly don't know what's true, but Keaton's presence is more than welcome, serving as a grumpy counterpoint, anchoring the film before it floats away in schmaltz.  It seems oddly fitting that he is present in the background as a witness to Calvero/Chaplin's farewell.The DVD extras work well, with a whole second disc devoted purely to features.  The ""Chaplin Today"" mini-documentaries have been the highlights of these Chaplin DVDs and the one on here continues that tradition, a nice balance being struck between contemporary analysis and interviews with the surviving cast.  In addition, included is all that exists of a short film from 1919 in which Chaplin plays the headman in a flea circus, a gag which he would eventually use in LIMELIGHT.The film's Oscar winning soundtrack is also available on the second disc, though one can only select tracks and cannot rewind or fast forward through individual selections.  Also included are two homemade movies from the Chaplin estate, the first being the family running around enjoying themselves in the US in 1950, while the second documents Chaplin returning to his childhood London neighborhood in 1959.  They're about as dull as one would expect watching someone's vacation films to be.  The selections are silent (the only noise is the gentle whirring of the projector) and the second piece could really have used some narration to explain what we are looking at.LIMELIGHT works on so many different levels.  It's the story of two fictional characters.  But it's also the story of the end of the music halls.  And it's also clearly autobiographical, with Chaplin sensing the end of his career and his life.  And, ultimately, it's a comment on humanity, the old fading away and their place being taken by the young.  It's a bittersweet movie, with even the final tragedy somehow giving us hope for the future.  An excellent film if you allow yourself to become caught up in it.",5,The Show Must Go On,1093478400,"08 26, 2004",2004,4694,"['LIMELIGHT', 'must', 'serve', 'ultimate', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'fit', 'hate', 'category', 'then', ""'ll"", 'find', 'silly', 'self-serving', 'self-indulgent', 'over-long', 'piece', 'megalomania', 'may', 'think', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'possibly', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'Chaplin', 'pitying', 'turn', 'pitching', 'neuroses', 'big', 'screen', 'other', 'hand', 'absolutely', 'Sure', 'melodrama', 'purest', 'best', 'form', 'melodrama', 'straight', 'Chaplin', 'heart', 'autobiographical', 'feel', 'sad', 'moments', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'kick.Set', 'London', '1914', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'simple', 'old', 'music', 'hall', 'clown', 'end', 'career', 'alcoholism', 'young', 'ballerina', 'confidence', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'depressing', ""'re"", 'right', 'only', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'movie', ""n't"", 'out', 'downer', 'emotional', 'highs', 'lows', 'pair', 'only', 'thing', 'meaning', 'lives', 'stage', 'interesting', 'note', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'Calvero', 'Chaplin', 'alone', 'audience', 'when', 'dream', 'places', 'Terry', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'applause', 'course', 'Calvero', 'encourage', 'ballerina', 'can', 'not', 'perform.Odd', 'say', 'Chaplin', 'film', 'dialog', 'marvelous', 'out', 'be', 'quoted', 'Chaplin', 'character', 'opining', 'everything', 'up', 'including', 'meaning', 'life', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'speeches', 'are', 'great', 'fit', 'movie', 'bombastic', 'attitude.It', 'relationship', 'young', 'ballerina', 'old', 'clown', 'back', 'film', 'documentary', 'touches', 'briefly', 'right', 'questions', 'Are', 'love', 'Can', 'be', 'Are', 'fooling', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'clearly', 'need', 'other', 'how', 'self-destructive', 'relationship', 'Calvero', 'teach', 'Terry', 'be', 'optimistic', 'standing', 'cliff', 'depression', 'Terry', 'Calvero', 'abilities', 'unable', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'questions', 'contradictions', 'make', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'experience.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'extended', 'cameo', 'film', 'conclusion', ""'ve"", 'read', 'filming', 'Keaton', 'was', 'much', 'funnier', 'comedy', 'scene', 'together', 'Chaplin', 'being', 'director', 'edited', 'result', 'such', 'way', 'throw', 'spotlight', 'back', ""'ve"", 'also', 'read', 'denials', 'ever', 'happened', ""'ve"", 'even', 'read', 'even', 'were', 'true', 'sense', 'context', 'how', 'film', 'progressing', 'Calvero', 'being', 'upstaged', 'moment', 'would', 'have', 'wrecked', 'whole', 'point', 'scene', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'true', 'Keaton', 'presence', 'more', 'welcome', 'serving', 'grumpy', 'counterpoint', 'anchoring', 'film', 'away', 'schmaltz', 'oddly', 'fitting', 'present', 'background', 'witness', 'Calvero/Chaplin', 'farewell.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'work', 'well', 'whole', 'second', 'disc', 'devoted', 'purely', 'features', 'Chaplin', 'Today', 'mini-documentaries', 'have', 'been', 'highlights', 'Chaplin', 'DVDs', 'one', 'here', 'tradition', 'nice', 'balance', 'being', 'struck', 'contemporary', 'analysis', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'cast', 'addition', 'included', 'exists', 'short', 'film', '1919', 'Chaplin', 'headman', 'flea', 'circus', 'gag', 'would', 'eventually', 'use', 'LIMELIGHT.The', 'film', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'available', 'second', 'disc', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'select', 'tracks', 'can', 'not', 'rewind', 'fast', 'forward', 'individual', 'selections', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'two', 'homemade', 'movies', 'Chaplin', 'estate', 'first', 'being', 'family', 'running', 'around', 'enjoying', 'US', '1950', 'second', 'documents', 'Chaplin', 'returning', 'childhood', 'London', 'neighborhood', '1959', ""'re"", 'as', 'dull', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'watching', 'someone', 'vacation', 'films', 'be', 'selections', 'are', 'silent', 'only', 'noise', 'gentle', 'whirring', 'projector', 'second', 'piece', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'used', 'narration', 'explain', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'at.LIMELIGHT', 'works', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'story', 'two', 'fictional', 'characters', 'also', 'story', 'end', 'music', 'halls', 'also', 'clearly', 'autobiographical', 'Chaplin', 'sensing', 'end', 'career', 'life', 'ultimately', 'comment', 'humanity', 'old', 'fading', 'away', 'place', 'being', 'taken', 'young', 'bittersweet', 'movie', 'even', 'final', 'tragedy', 'somehow', 'giving', 'hope', 'future', 'excellent', 'film', 'allow', 'become', 'caught', 'up']",N/A
320803,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302561965,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Sir Charles wrote, directed, scored and sings a few funny songs in this final masterpiece. His silent era leading lady (Purviance) has an uncredited cameo and Charlie appears for the only time with former rival Keaton. It's a true family affair, with seven Chaplins in all participating.His character is a music hall clown who's fallen on hard times due in part to failing health. To be funny on-stage, 'The Great Calvero"" always relied upon alcohol but after a near-fatal heart attack, the liquid key to his career success can now also be the cause of his earthly demise. Yet, we first meet Calvero one summer day in 1914.as he staggers home in a state of supreme intoxication.Fortunately, he's not too drunk to smell gas coming from a first floor apartment. Calvero breaks down the door and rescues a young girl who's trying to commit suicide. Ballerina Thereza (Bloom) is convinced that she's had rheumatic fever and is paralyzed, but the doctor tells Calvero that the girl isn't sick al all-- her illnesses are psychosomatic.The big-hearted trouper takes 'Terry' in and does his best to nurse her back to both physical and mental health. During one of his philosophic moments, Calvero says that like her he used to wish for death, but has now reached a point where living's become a habit that he wants to continue.I won't reveal the next nearly 2 hours of story but worth noting is Chaplin's amazing agility and athletic strength at nearly age 63. We see him do some of Calvero's famous old routines near story's end which require much flexibility and energy, including a dancer's split that Chaplin is able to rise to his feet from unassisted and without use of his hands. It's a remakable feat for a man of any age to perform.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(7.9) Limelight (1952) - Charles Chaplin/Claire Bloom/Nigel Bruce/Buster Keaton/Sydney Chaplin/Norman Lloyd/'Snub' Pollard (uncredited: Geraldine Chaplin/Josephine Chaplin/Charles Chaplin Jr./Oona Chaplin/Michael Chaplin/Sam Harris/Edna Purviance)",5,"""Oh for the life of a sardine...""",1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,2054,"['Sir', 'Charles', 'wrote', 'directed', 'scored', 'sings', 'few', 'funny', 'songs', 'final', 'masterpiece', 'silent', 'era', 'leading', 'lady', 'Purviance', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'Charlie', 'only', 'time', 'former', 'rival', 'Keaton', 'true', 'family', 'affair', 'seven', 'Chaplins', 'participating.His', 'character', 'music', 'hall', 'clown', 'who', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'due', 'part', 'failing', 'health', 'be', 'funny', 'on-stage', 'Great', 'Calvero', 'always', 'relied', 'alcohol', 'near-fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'liquid', 'key', 'career', 'success', 'can', 'now', 'also', 'be', 'cause', 'earthly', 'demise', 'first', 'meet', 'Calvero', 'one', 'summer', 'day', '1914.as', 'home', 'state', 'supreme', 'intoxication.Fortunately', 'not', 'too', 'drunk', 'smell', 'gas', 'coming', 'first', 'floor', 'apartment', 'Calvero', 'down', 'door', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'trying', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Ballerina', 'Thereza', 'Bloom', 'convinced', 'had', 'rheumatic', 'fever', 'paralyzed', 'doctor', 'Calvero', 'girl', ""n't"", 'sick', 'al', 'illnesses', 'are', 'psychosomatic.The', 'big-hearted', 'trouper', ""'Terry"", 'best', 'nurse', 'back', 'physical', 'mental', 'health', 'one', 'philosophic', 'moments', 'Calvero', 'used', 'wish', 'death', 'now', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'living', 'become', 'habit', 'continue.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'next', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'story', 'worth', 'noting', 'Chaplin', 'amazing', 'agility', 'athletic', 'strength', 'nearly', 'age', '63', 'see', 'do', 'Calvero', 'famous', 'old', 'routines', 'story', 'end', 'require', 'much', 'flexibility', 'energy', 'including', 'dancer', 'split', 'Chaplin', 'able', 'rise', 'feet', 'unassisted', 'use', 'hands', 'remakable', 'feat', 'man', 'age', 'perform.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '7.9', 'Limelight', '1952', 'Charles', 'Chaplin/Claire', 'Bloom/Nigel', 'Bruce/Buster', 'Keaton/Sydney', 'Chaplin/Norman', ""Lloyd/'Snub"", 'Pollard', 'uncredited', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin/Josephine', 'Chaplin/Charles', 'Chaplin', 'Jr./Oona', 'Chaplin/Michael', 'Chaplin/Sam', 'Harris/Edna', 'Purviance']",N/A

Set in London circa 1910, Chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill. One day as he stumbles home drunk, he smells gas, and rescues a young girl (Claire Bloom) from a suicide attempt. He nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career. Between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat, Chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past, including a great sketch with Buster Keaton in which he plays the fiddle and Keaton the piano (it was both their swan songs). The movie is autobiographical and reeks of self-importance, with a number of references to Chaplin's carrer in pictures alluded to. But there's intelligence, too, and not a little sentimentality (what Chaplin picture doesn't contain this?), but Chaplin is such a demanding master that there isn't a moment of sloughing off or cheapness.

Instead, it is the musings of an old man, who has reflected on his life, realized how great he was once, how poorly he has become, and yet never gives up hope. This is a pretty serious dramatic film, actually, which seems to me why people didn't accept it too well: they were expecting something silly. The film does have its sillier moments, of course, especially with Buster Keaton, and a bit of clowning and dialouge, such as the flea circus bit.I find that Chaplin had an incredible speaking voice, and was very well capable of playing a dramatic role. Considering how his life went, as the movie seems to follow pretty closely, it makes sense.

For a flavor of the times, watch Goodnight and Good Luck, or The Front. This is what drove Chaplin away forever, only later to receive an honorary reward which he had long deserved but only belatedly received when politics in America permited a bit more breathing room and reality and artistic freedom.THe sniping mentioned here conocerning editting of Buster KEaton overlooks the fact that Keaton's genius had much earlier been destroyed by the iron-clad Hollywood studio system. As a young man grown up in vaudeville he produced incredibly genius works in The General, etc., much of it improvised. Then talkies came in and the studios demanded detailed scripts and killed both his irrepresible ingenious character, and tied him to being Jimmy Durante's straight man, and driving him to drink. This consummate physical acrobat was destroyed long before Chaplin kindly included him in this swan song for the both. While getting Chaplin, also include Keaton in your search, and get his earliest films. Then try to find Samuel Beckett's Film, one of Keaton's final appearances. Read Beckett's biography for a view of how professiional and prepared Keaton really was to the end.Anyway, please get this film here and now.

After Limelight, Chaplin only completed two films (not counting his compilation The Chaplin Revue), one of which (A King in New York) has many fine moments but doesn't have nearly the impact that his earlier movies do, the other (A Countess from Hong Kong) I have not seen but have heard is uninspired throughout.  With Limelight, we have Chaplin in transition, an overall concept which is very promising, but a stagey execution which, much as I would like to say otherwise, seriously detracts from the impact the concept has.The overall idea is very fine.  Chaplin is Calvero, an aging clown long past his prime, who no longer is able to make audiences laugh.  He saves a young girl, Terry, from suicide, and restoring her back to health (she cannot walk) gives him a new lease on life.  Eventually, he regains his popularity, and a revitalized Terry says she loves him and wants to marry him; he realizes that the offer only comes from gratitude and kindness, not from love, and also that his life is drawing to a close, his time has come.  In one last triumphant act, Calvero has the audience howling in laughter when he has a heart attack; he steps out of the limelight in favor of Terry and dies watching her.  The central theme in this movie, the futility of prolonging life after its natural conclusion, obviously has the potential for a great masterpiece, but while Chaplin obviously recognizes this and brings out every stage in the drama with great pathos, he overdoes it.  His frequent philosophical ramblings, while fascinating, come off as unrealistic, and in fact Calvero generally has the air of someone who could not possibly have existed, a stage character rather than a real human being.  Some people find this overlong, but I am inclined to put this down to the excessively short attention span most movie audiences have; the movie is longer than most Chaplin movies (in fact, it might be the longest, I haven't timed them), but it is always interesting, and every incident is important to the unfolding of the drama.  Also, don't expect too many laughs: this is almost straight drama, with the only comedy being done on stage by Calvero (and Keaton's character), and even that is tinged with sadness, as Chaplin's age for the first time in his movies makes its presence felt.I have brought up the final scene with Chaplin and Keaton; this was the only time the two great comics of the silent era worked together, and it has provoked controversy that still has not died down, namely, the rumor that Chaplin cut out most of Keaton's best bits so that Chaplin would dominate the scene.  Allow me to quote something which, I hope, will put an end to the rumors, at least here at amazon.com.  This quote is from Jeffrey Vance's superb biography of Chaplin (highly recommended), who in turn quotes Jerry Epstein: ""People have written over the years that Charlie cut out the best stuff of Buster Keaton.  That's completely untrue, and I should know as I was with Charlie every day in the editing of the picture.  He shot enough for ten films from just that sequence.  He cut out some of Keaton's stuff but he also cut some of his own best gags.  Narrative meant more than anything else, no matter how good any one gag was.  He would never sacrifice anyone's performance.""In short, I recommend this for Chaplin fans who are familiar with his best work, but I don't think this should be anyone's introduction to Chaplin.",4,"For Chaplin fans, but not for everyone else",1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,3711,"['Chaplin', 'movies', 'one', 'probably', 'most', 'difficult', 'review', 'Prior', 'Limelight', '1952', 'Chaplin', 'movies', 'achieving', 'artistic', 'maturity', 'were', 'flawless', 'masterpieces', 'few', 'flaws', 'detract', 'overall', 'impact', 'only', 'relatively', 'minor', 'ways', 'Limelight', 'Chaplin', 'only', 'completed', 'two', 'films', 'not', 'counting', 'compilation', 'Chaplin', 'Revue', 'one', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'many', 'fine', 'moments', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'impact', 'earlier', 'movies', 'do', 'other', 'Countess', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'have', 'heard', 'uninspired', 'Limelight', 'have', 'Chaplin', 'transition', 'overall', 'concept', 'very', 'promising', 'stagey', 'execution', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'otherwise', 'seriously', 'impact', 'concept', 'has.The', 'overall', 'idea', 'very', 'fine', 'Chaplin', 'Calvero', 'aging', 'clown', 'long', 'prime', 'who', 'longer', 'able', 'make', 'audiences', 'laugh', 'young', 'girl', 'Terry', 'suicide', 'restoring', 'back', 'health', 'can', 'not', 'walk', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'Eventually', 'popularity', 'revitalized', 'Terry', 'marry', 'offer', 'only', 'gratitude', 'kindness', 'not', 'love', 'also', 'life', 'drawing', 'close', 'time', 'come', 'one', 'last', 'triumphant', 'act', 'Calvero', 'audience', 'howling', 'laughter', 'when', 'heart', 'attack', 'limelight', 'favor', 'Terry', 'watching', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'futility', 'prolonging', 'life', 'natural', 'conclusion', 'obviously', 'potential', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'Chaplin', 'obviously', 'out', 'stage', 'drama', 'great', 'pathos', 'frequent', 'philosophical', 'ramblings', 'fascinating', 'come', 'off', 'unrealistic', 'fact', 'Calvero', 'generally', 'air', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'existed', 'stage', 'character', 'rather', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'people', 'find', 'overlong', 'am', 'inclined', 'put', 'down', 'excessively', 'short', 'attention', 'most', 'movie', 'audiences', 'have', 'movie', 'longer', 'most', 'Chaplin', 'movies', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'longest', 'have', ""n't"", 'timed', 'always', 'interesting', 'incident', 'important', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'many', 'laughs', 'almost', 'straight', 'drama', 'only', 'comedy', 'being', 'done', 'stage', 'Calvero', 'Keaton', 'character', 'even', 'tinged', 'sadness', 'Chaplin', 'age', 'first', 'time', 'movies', 'presence', 'felt.I', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'two', 'great', 'comics', 'silent', 'era', 'worked', 'together', 'provoked', 'controversy', 'still', 'not', 'died', 'down', 'namely', 'rumor', 'Chaplin', 'cut', 'out', 'most', 'Keaton', 'best', 'bits', 'so', 'Chaplin', 'would', 'dominate', 'scene', 'Allow', 'quote', 'something', 'hope', 'will', 'put', 'end', 'rumors', 'least', 'here', 'amazon.com', 'quote', 'Jeffrey', 'Vance', 'superb', 'biography', 'Chaplin', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'turn', 'quotes', 'Jerry', 'Epstein', 'People', 'have', 'written', 'years', 'Charlie', 'cut', 'out', 'best', 'stuff', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'completely', 'untrue', 'should', 'know', 'was', 'Charlie', 'day', 'editing', 'picture', 'shot', 'enough', 'ten', 'films', 'just', 'sequence', 'cut', 'out', 'Keaton', 'stuff', 'also', 'cut', 'own', 'best', 'gags', 'Narrative', 'meant', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'one', 'gag', 'was', 'would', 'never', 'sacrifice', 'anyone', 'performance', 'short', 'recommend', 'Chaplin', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'best', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'be', 'anyone', 'introduction', 'Chaplin']",N/A

When the tramp clown breathes his last, &quot;Who is dying here is not Calvaro, but Charlie Chaplin,&quot; Bertolucci says in the DVD documentary. &quot;With 'Limelight,' tears flow very easily.&quot;The MK2 documentary for &quot;Limelight&quot; is the Chaplin Collection's best so far. It covers the period in which Chaplin left the United States, only to return once, reluctantly, for his honorary Oscar.The docu doesn't address the old charges that Chaplin spiked Buster Keaton's best work in the film. Regardless, the extended Keaton-Chaplin slapstick sequence remains the highlight for many viewers. The DVD photo gallery includes W. Eugene Smith's terrific stills of the men at work.The film enjoy across-the-board improvements in video and audio, including digital transfers from Chaplin family elements and Dolby Digital 5.1 mixes. Imaginative bonus features inform and entertain without wearing out their welcome.&quot;Limelight&quot; extras include footage of Chaplin getting a hero's welcome in London and revisiting the places of his youth. Home movies from the 1950s show Geraldine Chaplin as a child and teenager. (The great Chaplin comes across like any other proud goofy dad, playing with his kids.) A hilarious 1919 short shows Chaplin on the loose as a flea-circus wrangler.Chaplin and his collaborators' luscious score, which won a belated Oscar in 1972 -- once the film finally qualified by screening in L.A. -- can be enjoyed separately, as an extra.

He plays the once great Calvero, a clown who has seen better days and is now a self pitying alcoholic.  But then he meets an actress/dancer down on her luck (Claire Bloom), and his life begins to change around, slowly but surely.  It climaxes in a great duet with Buster Keaton on stage.  Chaplin only made 5 sound films (four of which he starred in), and I've always felt that ALL of them were vastly underrated (except his last one, A Countess from Hong Kong, which is really awful).  The critics and some fans always think of the tramp with him, and dismiss these great works as an afterthought (this film and Msr. Verdoux are my favorites).  Chaplin was a great actor, and he had a magnificent speaking voice.  Unlike a lot of silent stars who faded into obscurity, Chaplin made a late, but still, smooth transition (unlike his rival, Buster Keaton, who spent years in the wilderness of Hollywood with drug/drinking problems) to sound.  This film is almost like a nostalgic walk down memory lane for Chaplin, who started out in the dance halls depicted in this film.

It's by no means typical Chaplin (he doesn't play the tramp) but at the same time it's totally Chaplin: he acts, he sings, he dances, he does pantomime, he positively bursts with energy and wisdom and urgency and vitality.  It is impressive stuff; even therapeutic!  This tender story of an aging comedian restoring confidence to a troubled young dancer is a great display of the complete scope of Charles Chaplin's talents, and I'm happy to report that co-star Claire Bloom is every bit his equal.  Ms. Bloom's Big Scene (You'll know it when you see it) can still bring tears of joy to even this seen-it-all Chaplin addict.But the average movie-watcher might be well advised to avoid this, just the same.  It's old-fashioned melodrama a good deal of the time and much too long; the comedy highlights are really just two: the flea circus and the duet with guest star Buster Keaton.  Also, Chaplin's strange habit of shooting a subtly amused little glance at the camera every time he says something pithy (as if to say, ""How about THAT, folks?"") might be off-putting if you're not used to it.But as a valentine to The Theatre and all its magic; its perpetual cycle of glory, heartbreak, and hope, Limelight is note-perfect, and yes, a perfect souvenir of the genius of both Mr. Charles Chaplin and Ms. Claire Bloom.""I'm getting old...I must have truth!

320818,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,6302561965,Josef Bush,"[0, 0]","This is not by any means a dispassionate review because, personally, LIMELIGHT is one of the very best movies I've ever seen.  It never ceases to delight and amaze me.  You can say what you like about it, everybody does.  Stilted?  Self-indulgent?  Antiquated?  Well, when it comes to authentic masterpieces, we have to remember that all of them bear the chisel marks of the master creator, and like all others, this one certainly does.LIMELIGHT is as authentic and as personal as was Chaplain himself, because all of his films were and remain in one way or another, autobiographical.  Here, in this re-creation of Pre-WW I England, we catch a glimpse of what life might have been like in theatrical digs, in Edwardian London.  That's where and how Charlie grew up, and I find it touching in the extreme that we glimpse his little daughter Geraldine as a street urchin in one of the early shots.  His handsome older son Sidney (named after his brother, no doubt) appears throughout the film and is the romantic lead.  That, ultimately, in its plea for respect for women, it might be a cri de memoire and a portrait of his young, doomed mother is remarkable and profound.Outside of the plot of the film and its characters, there are two admirable portraits caught like flying insects in amber here; that of ballet's immortals, Melissa Hayden and Andre Eglevsky.  They set like gems on the cover of a Byzaneint bible.  Hayden body-doubles for Clair Boom in the med and long shots as Bloom's character dances on stage, and Eglevsky appears only in costume as a character within the dance.  If one admdires Ballet, these glimpses of two of that Art's greats, is a stupendous reward for the viewing experience.  LIMELIGHT, made approximately between the extinction of LES BALLETS RUSES DE MONTE CARLO and the birth of THE NEW YORK CITY BALLET, lived and flourished when Lincoln Kersten supported Georges Balanchine's attempts to put together the entity that would become, in time, THE NEW YORK CITY BALLET.  During that period of flux, these two dancers epitomized the best of the Russian/European Ballet styles as they morphed into something American.  Eglevsky was if not exactly danseur noble, then certainly male dancer of first rank.  Aside from a magnificently proportioned body, he posessed trememdous physical strength; not only the strenth needed to hurl himself through the air with phenomenal grace and apparent ease, but in partnering, the strength to support his ballerina invisibly and seemingly effortlessly, so that from the audience's point of view she seemed to rise from the stage and float forward in attitude, like a wisp of thisle down.  In their brief partnering here, and alas, in no clasic dances, Hayden displays her full command of those attributes for which female ballet dancers, and particularly American ones, would become noted: an unswerving, perfect balance in every position within the circumfrence of her extended body.  She is like a cinema actress with no bad angles; her presence is symmetrical in its dynamism.Of course, having studied Chaplin's films and particularly his creative method, I understand that he used the ensemble to 'sketch'  his ideas, and edited as he watched the rushes.  It was an expensive method when he worked in Silents, but it gave him absolute control, and therefore, the best possible results.  As with Berlioz, whose instrument was the Symphony Orchestra, or with Duke Ellington, whose instrument was the Jazz Band, Chaplin's instrument was the creative ensemble; cast (including himself) crew, orchestra, lighting and (in his last few films) sound.  To experience LIMELIGHT is to enjoy an aesthetic experience of the highest quality; a visual experiance both musical and dramatic that is often symphonic in its effect, and profoundly satisfying.",5,"FOR A DESERT ISLAND, INDESPENSIBLE",1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,3809,"['not', 'means', 'dispassionate', 'review', 'personally', 'LIMELIGHT', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'never', 'delight', 'amaze', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'like', 'everybody', 'Stilted', 'Self-indulgent', 'Antiquated', 'Well', 'when', 'authentic', 'masterpieces', 'have', 'remember', 'bear', 'chisel', 'marks', 'master', 'creator', 'others', 'one', 'certainly', 'does.LIMELIGHT', 'authentic', 'as', 'personal', 'was', 'Chaplain', 'films', 'were', 'remain', 'one', 'way', 'autobiographical', 'Here', 're-creation', 'Pre-WW', 'England', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'theatrical', 'digs', 'Edwardian', 'London', 'where', 'how', 'Charlie', 'grew', 'up', 'find', 'touching', 'extreme', 'glimpse', 'little', 'daughter', 'Geraldine', 'street', 'urchin', 'one', 'early', 'shots', 'handsome', 'older', 'son', 'Sidney', 'named', 'brother', 'doubt', 'film', 'romantic', 'lead', 'ultimately', 'plea', 'respect', 'women', 'might', 'be', 'cri', 'memoire', 'portrait', 'young', 'doomed', 'mother', 'remarkable', 'profound.Outside', 'plot', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'admirable', 'portraits', 'caught', 'flying', 'insects', 'amber', 'here', 'ballet', 'immortals', 'Melissa', 'Hayden', 'Andre', 'Eglevsky', 'set', 'gems', 'cover', 'Byzaneint', 'bible', 'Hayden', 'body-doubles', 'Clair', 'Boom', 'med', 'long', 'shots', 'Bloom', 'character', 'dances', 'stage', 'Eglevsky', 'only', 'costume', 'character', 'dance', 'one', 'Ballet', 'glimpses', 'two', 'Art', 'greats', 'stupendous', 'reward', 'viewing', 'experience', 'LIMELIGHT', 'made', 'approximately', 'extinction', 'LES', 'BALLETS', 'RUSES', 'DE', 'MONTE', 'CARLO', 'birth', 'THE', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'CITY', 'BALLET', 'lived', 'flourished', 'when', 'Lincoln', 'Kersten', 'supported', 'Georges', 'Balanchine', 'attempts', 'put', 'together', 'entity', 'would', 'become', 'time', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'CITY', 'BALLET', 'period', 'flux', 'two', 'dancers', 'epitomized', 'best', 'Russian/European', 'Ballet', 'styles', 'morphed', 'something', 'American', 'Eglevsky', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'danseur', 'noble', 'then', 'certainly', 'male', 'dancer', 'first', 'rank', 'Aside', 'magnificently', 'proportioned', 'body', 'posessed', 'trememdous', 'physical', 'strength', 'not', 'only', 'strenth', 'needed', 'hurl', 'air', 'phenomenal', 'grace', 'apparent', 'ease', 'partnering', 'strength', 'support', 'ballerina', 'invisibly', 'seemingly', 'effortlessly', 'audience', 'point', 'view', 'seemed', 'rise', 'stage', 'float', 'forward', 'attitude', 'wisp', 'thisle', 'down', 'brief', 'partnering', 'here', 'alas', 'clasic', 'dances', 'Hayden', 'full', 'command', 'attributes', 'female', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'particularly', 'American', 'ones', 'would', 'become', 'noted', 'unswerving', 'perfect', 'balance', 'position', 'circumfrence', 'extended', 'body', 'cinema', 'actress', 'bad', 'angles', 'presence', 'symmetrical', 'dynamism.Of', 'course', 'having', 'studied', 'Chaplin', 'films', 'particularly', 'creative', 'method', 'understand', 'used', 'ensemble', ""'sketch"", 'ideas', 'edited', 'watched', 'rushes', 'was', 'expensive', 'method', 'when', 'worked', 'Silents', 'gave', 'absolute', 'control', 'therefore', 'best', 'possible', 'results', 'Berlioz', 'instrument', 'was', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'Duke', 'Ellington', 'instrument', 'was', 'Jazz', 'Band', 'Chaplin', 'instrument', 'was', 'creative', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'crew', 'orchestra', 'lighting', 'last', 'few', 'films', 'sound', 'experience', 'LIMELIGHT', 'enjoy', 'aesthetic', 'experience', 'highest', 'quality', 'visual', 'experiance', 'musical', 'dramatic', 'often', 'symphonic', 'effect', 'profoundly', 'satisfying']",N/A

Mainly because i dont own them yet.  I do own Limelight but have been hesitant to watch because it has sound, and I couldnt imagine Chaplin talking.  I also couldnt imagine a Chaplin film lasting 130 minutes.  What i realized early on is that this movie is a drama, not a comedy.  Then again Chaplin's silent movies always had an element of drama or sadness especially his later ones.  I found myself crying at the end of the first hour which was kind of like the culmination of Act 1- where Chaplin saves this young girls life, literally.  I guess the dialogue could be thought of as corny, but I loved it, I thought it was brilliant.In addition to the story- you also have parts of the movie that stand alone- as with most Chaplin movies- classic moments.  First the insight into what vaudeville, pre-vaudeville really, was like, secondly the beauty of the ballet sequences, thirdly the teaming of Keaton and Chaplin, and finally some original song routines that are quintessential Charlie Chaplin.Just like any hero that you might have, such as a great actor, or musical performer, you dont want to see something that might disappoint.

The story, about the bittersweet relationship between an aging vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina, is anything but subtle, but it is still sweet and entertaining, even touching at times. And &quot;Limelight&quot; is notable also for featuring the only on-screen pairing of Chaplin and Buster Keaton (alas, for a short time only).This DVD is probably the best of the first wave of the Chaplin collection (the others being &quot;The Gold Rush,&quot; &quot;Modern Times,&quot; and &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;). The movie is on the first disc, and it looks amazing. It is very sharp and clear, with practically no scratches. The sound, as far as I noticed, was perfectly fine.The extra features, located on the second disc, are pretty much a completist's dream. Like other films in the collection, there is a good introduction by Chaplin biographer David Robinson, as well as a great &quot;Chaplin Today&quot; documentary (featuring interviews with, among others, director Bernardo Bertolucci). The next feature a fan should go to is a flea circus scene from Chaplin's unfinished 1918 comedy &quot;The Professor.&quot; It is an amusing scene, and makes one wonder what it would have been like if the film were ever completed. A deleted scene, in which Calvero meets an armless friend, is pretty good and well worth watching. Some of Chaplin's home movies can be viewed; they are interesting to see, if not worth repeated viewings. As well, you can listen to Chaplin's complete, uncut musical score.Extras are rounded out with a huge photo gallery, a poster gallery, some trailers, and ads (excuse me, &quot;scenes&quot;) from other Chaplin films.",4,"Entertaining, if Slightly Corny Chaplin Film",1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,1783,"['quot', 'Limelight', 'quot', 'one', 'two', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'dramas', '1923', 'quot', 'A', 'Woman', 'Paris', 'quot', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'story', 'bittersweet', 'relationship', 'aging', 'vaudeville', 'comedian', 'young', 'ballerina', 'anything', 'subtle', 'still', 'sweet', 'entertaining', 'even', 'touching', 'times', 'quot', 'Limelight', 'quot', 'notable', 'also', 'featuring', 'only', 'on-screen', 'pairing', 'Chaplin', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'alas', 'short', 'time', 'only', '.This', 'DVD', 'probably', 'best', 'first', 'wave', 'Chaplin', 'collection', 'others', 'being', 'quot', 'Gold', 'Rush', 'quot', 'quot', 'Modern', 'Times', 'quot', 'quot', 'Great', 'Dictator', 'quot', 'movie', 'first', 'disc', 'amazing', 'very', 'sharp', 'clear', 'practically', 'scratches', 'sound', 'as', 'far', 'noticed', 'was', 'perfectly', 'fine.The', 'extra', 'features', 'located', 'second', 'disc', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'completist', 'dream', 'other', 'films', 'collection', 'good', 'introduction', 'Chaplin', 'biographer', 'David', 'Robinson', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'quot', 'Chaplin', 'Today', 'quot', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'others', 'director', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'next', 'feature', 'fan', 'should', 'go', 'flea', 'circus', 'scene', 'Chaplin', 'unfinished', '1918', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Professor.', 'quot', 'amusing', 'scene', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'were', 'ever', 'completed', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Calvero', 'armless', 'friend', 'pretty', 'good', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Chaplin', 'home', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'are', 'interesting', 'see', 'not', 'worth', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'well', 'can', 'listen', 'Chaplin', 'complete', 'uncut', 'musical', 'score.Extras', 'are', 'rounded', 'out', 'huge', 'photo', 'gallery', 'poster', 'gallery', 'trailers', 'ads', 'quot', 'scenes', 'quot', 'other', 'Chaplin', 'films']",N/A

By 1951, when he made Limelight, Chaplin has aged into a fey, bitter, and self-impressed shell of his former self, and Limelight has all the reason to be simply wretched as a consequence. It also includes some of the worst dialogue ever written. (Sample: ""I thought you hated the theatre."" ""I do. I also hate the sight of blood, but it's in my veins."") But, somehow, Limelight works. Chaplin has really reached down into his soul and given us a warts-and-all exploration of his love-hate relationship with the audience he could never forgive for abandoning him. But he's also dug deeper, and explored the issue of love itself as the ultimate exercise in self-pity. The film's central relationship, between the has-been ""Tramp Comedian"" Cavelero and a suicidal ballerina (an undeniably luminous Claire Bloom), is really almost unique in cinema: a love affair without sex, based entirely on mutual (self-)pity. The film's visual style is fairly stagey, but then you get these astonishing 'limelighted' dream sequences of Cavalero's former stage act that are deliberately stagey but really quite visually brilliant. It all ties together. And the closing sequence manages to be hilarious, surprising and heartfelt, all at the same time.

Limelight is a wonder of wonders with its brilliantly insightful script, lusciously crisp and clearly poetic, black&white; cinematography and marvelous acting. This film is about hope in the face of circumstances that interfere with the artistic process and life, and this is Chaplin's most cinematically poetic film. Words are used by Chaplin only when necessary to convey what cannot be expressed with the other elements of film such as composition, camera, acting, light; when these other elements would nicely suffice, Chaplin arranged the scene brilliantly, without having the characters utter a word.Knowing when to keep silent and when to speak has always, since City Lights, been Chaplin's trademark and something which set him apart from his peers since the advent of Talkies in the 1930s. In Limelight we are not disappointed. Not a screenwriter-director to waste audience's time and energy with meaningless drivel, Chaplin made sure that the script was packed only with the finest and most meaningful words--on a par with Ingmar Bergman, in terms of the depth of thought and care that went into such writing.Limelight is a treatise on the strength of the human spirit. It is uplifting without being sugary; it offers up choices to be made without being preachy.

320830,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302561965,Randy Keehn,"[2, 3]","Charles Chaplin is one of the greatest actors in US history; maybe THE greatest.  He made his impact in the silent film era when an actor had to create actions and emotions without the benefit of sound.  Was there anybody back then that could even be mentioned in the same breath as Chaplin?  Well, politics, creative control and other reasons led Chaplin into a self-imposed exile with few films emerging after the advent of sound in cinema.  ""Limelight"" is one of those films.""Limelight is fairly non-descript as a movie and is notable almost exclusively because it was virtually all put together by Chaplin.  Not only was he the actor, writer and director, he even composed much of the music.  This multiple level of creative talent is impressive but the movie is not.  The story is predictible and the acting is not all that good.  In addition, it was about 20 minutes too long.  Take a look for yourself but be cautious about your perspective. I found the definition to the accolades for ""Limelight"" to be in the movie itself.  Early on, we see Chaplin as a has-been comedian trying to restart his career with an act that saw the audience leave in droves.  The audience, as we could tell, were plebian types who had no appreciation for such ""talent"".  Later, a fallen Chaplin is feted at a benefit performance.  The wealthy, intellectual audience watches the same routines done with the same energy and cries for encore after encore.  The cheers are overwhelming.  Why the different reaction?  The first audience did not know the reputation of the actor while the second audience knew him as a once-great comedian whom they came purposely to honor.  Ironically, Chaplin created the scenario for the success of ""Limelight"" based on the very same reasons.  There's nothing wrong with praising a great artist.  However, when praising the later mediocrity of his work, one shames both the actor and the audience.  ""Limelight"" is a great movie only in the satirical look it gives of ourselves as hero-worshippers.",3,Twilight,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,2013,"['Charles', 'Chaplin', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'US', 'history', 'maybe', 'greatest', 'made', 'impact', 'silent', 'film', 'era', 'when', 'actor', 'had', 'create', 'actions', 'emotions', 'benefit', 'sound', 'Was', 'anybody', 'back', 'then', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'mentioned', 'same', 'breath', 'Chaplin', 'Well', 'politics', 'creative', 'control', 'other', 'reasons', 'led', 'Chaplin', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'few', 'films', 'emerging', 'advent', 'sound', 'cinema', 'Limelight', 'one', 'films', 'Limelight', 'fairly', 'non-descript', 'movie', 'notable', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'was', 'virtually', 'put', 'together', 'Chaplin', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'actor', 'writer', 'director', 'even', 'composed', 'much', 'music', 'multiple', 'level', 'creative', 'talent', 'impressive', 'movie', 'not', 'story', 'predictible', 'acting', 'not', 'good', 'addition', 'was', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'Take', 'look', 'be', 'cautious', 'perspective', 'found', 'definition', 'accolades', 'Limelight', 'be', 'movie', 'Early', 'see', 'Chaplin', 'has-been', 'comedian', 'trying', 'restart', 'career', 'act', 'saw', 'audience', 'leave', 'droves', 'audience', 'could', 'tell', 'were', 'plebian', 'types', 'who', 'had', 'appreciation', 'such', 'talent', 'Later', 'fallen', 'Chaplin', 'feted', 'benefit', 'performance', 'wealthy', 'intellectual', 'audience', 'same', 'routines', 'done', 'same', 'energy', 'cries', 'encore', 'encore', 'cheers', 'are', 'overwhelming', 'Why', 'different', 'reaction', 'first', 'audience', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'reputation', 'actor', 'second', 'audience', 'knew', 'once-great', 'comedian', 'whom', 'came', 'purposely', 'honor', 'Ironically', 'Chaplin', 'created', 'scenario', 'success', 'Limelight', 'based', 'very', 'same', 'reasons', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'praising', 'great', 'artist', 'However', 'when', 'praising', 'later', 'mediocrity', 'work', 'one', 'actor', 'audience', 'Limelight', 'great', 'movie', 'only', 'satirical', 'look', 'hero-worshippers']",N/A

However, the pantomime routines are excellent and the film is worth seeing for its brilliant eight-minute teaming of Chaplin and Buster Keaton. In fact, Chaplin could have taken a few pointers from Keaton, who speaks relatively little and performs without a hint of egomania. Chaplin may have cut some of Keaton's gags, yet the Great Stone Face steals the scene with his stoic underplaying.

320833,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,6302561965,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[1, 1]","A stunning, fantastic film that you can watch over and over again, with beautiful, memorable soundtrack music (also composed by compulsive do-it-all Chaplin). Chaplin is fantastic, his beautiful co-star Claire Bloom less so (a bit hammy as an actress), but the character development is beautiful, the achingly emotional scenes simply stunning, and this film was a welcome new addition to the Chaplin legend after the somewhat uneven (and freakily sinister) Monsieur Verdoux. Chaplin acting like he&#8217;s drunk, the trio of kids (his real-life children with Oona O&#8217;Neil, including Geraldine Chaplin, who appeared as an adult in Robert Altman&#8217;s masterpiece Nashville), the discovery of an attempted suicide, the machinations of the horrible landlady, and the budding relationship; interesting how Chaplin helps the woman, who then helps him (a repeat of a similar device, played to bittersweet effect in Monsieur Verdoux &#8211; as is the flirtation with horrible women for ulterior motives).&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you let me die?&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s your hurry?&#8221; Chaplin cheers the girl up, he acts like a rock or a rose, a bonsai, just as cynical and charming as Monsieur Verdoux; and yet, when she&#8217;s re-invigorated, he becomes the one who loses hope (we see the same thing happen in Monsieur Verdoux, but for different, more sinster reasons). Great scenes of Terry falling in love with Calvero, Calvero&#8217;s nightmare, his silly comedy act and dull songs (naturally he&#8217;ll fail), the deflating of his artistic ego, Terry&#8217;s blossoming as the next generation takes over, her psychological impediment &#8211; she thinks her legs don&#8217;t work, but it&#8217;s only in her mind, as we so amply see in her two over-wrought emotional scenes. Great screenplay, although it also has its weird moments. The street musicians who never talk, Calvero&#8217;s drinking, and how the landlady warms up after a few drinks. &#8220;Beer, Bach and Beethoven.&#8221; &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a little late for music?&#8221; &#8220;Not if it&#8217;s a nocturne.&#8221; Calvero does his version of The Little Tramp. &#8220;Ode To A Worm&#8221; &#8211; is it sexual? &#8220;What a sad business, being funny.&#8221; &#8220;Calvero, I&#8217;m walking! I&#8217;M WALKING!!!&#8221; There&#8217;s weird shadows and lighting in the dance audition scene (intentionally bad?). She proposes to him!! Beautiful ballet, silent. Calvero smashes the hysteria out of Terry, she dances like she&#8217;s never danced before! Funny scene where the clown Calvero prays, is discovered, tries to cover up &#8211; &#8220;I lost a button&#8221; (ironic after the atheism of Monsieur Verdoux). One short leg act with Buster Keaton is sheer genius, and we hear Buster&#8217;s voice!! Amazing. Awesome rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll tumble, funny splits thing that he does.Bonus Features: documentary and commentary &#8211; Chaplin spent two years on Limelight screenplay, even wrote out a 100,000-word novel called &#8220;Footlights&#8221;, which indulges in sentimentality for family and the old London stage, and contains also bios of Terry and Calvero. In 1972 Charlie Chaplin won an Oscar for the soundtrack, ironic since the film was subverted upon its release. His family is all over the film &#8211; his half-brother plays a clown (and the doctor), so does his son, another son Sidney plays a young romantic rival for Terry&#8217;s affections, and his three youngest children also appear (and his young wife Oona is a stand-in for Terry in one of the scenes). When he attended the London premiere, which Princess Margaret attended, he learned that he would not be welcomed back in the US, and would need to apply for re-entry permits, as if he&#8217;d never contributed to the US economy, created jobs for Americans, or paid any taxes there. Wow! &#8220;That unhappy place,&#8221; he called the country, gripped in the anti-communism of the McCarthy era. He re-settled in the UK, his first time back in 21 years (and only the second time back since he initially left) with Oona, the daughter of Eugene O&#8217;Neil, with whom he&#8217;d eloped in 1942 (and for which her father disowned her). But even if he was shunned in the US, he was openly welcomed in Europe, and he caught up again with Jean Cocteau, whom he&#8217;d first met on his trip to Asia in 1936 with Paulette Goddard (that must have been interesting!!). Sidney Chaplain remembers that return in an interview piece, and he talks about going back to places from his childhood. Bernardo Bertolucci remembers. Claire Bloom interviewed, remembering Charlie Chaplin&#8217;s white hair, blue eyes, expressive hands. In her actions and wardrobe he incorporates the mother and the women he lost in his life. The tramp was never loved back by his women (at least not until Modern Times), but Terry loves Calvero &#8211; everything is stood on its head, and it&#8217;s phony; Calvero knows that Terry doesn&#8217;t love him truly, and he&#8217;s not really wrong either (funny how, in real life, Chaplin had a wife 35 years younger than him &#8211; what about that?). Bertolucci is certain that Terry lies when she says she loves him, that it&#8217;s staged. Calvero is overwhelmed at the affection he gets at the end of his life &#8211; she shows affection, but he feels humiliation. She&#8217;d marry him out of pity, and he doesn&#8217;t want that. Chaplin fears losing touch with his audience. Violent reation to the character of Monsieur Verdoux. Bertolucci says that, although he doesn&#8217;t often cry, &#8220;with Limelight, tears flow easily.&#8221; In the documentary we see evidence of how the American Legion was trying to get rid of him.The extras also contains a very nice deleted scene &#8211; Charlie Chaplin deals with the landlady, meets the new maid. Too bad it was cut, because in the original film I do wonder how Calvero knows the maid, who appears very suddenly. He then goes to the pub, and meets the one-armed performer he had mentioned earlier, accepts his charity of 20. As another bonus, we get The Professor, a strange story where Chaplin first tries out his trained flea act (Chaplin has a reputation of reviving gags in his later films, and we do see that with the barber clip that inspired the Jewish Barber in The Great Dictator, and now also with this item as well). It&#8217;s a funny clip of an old man, sleeping with a pipe. The DVD also contains some great home movies, from the USA in 1950, and from London in 1959, where we see a topless Geraldine. In the garden, on horses, at the beach, on a boat. Shirtless Chaplin &#8211; a bit pudgy, actually. Tons of photos, including pictures of the scenes and costumes that didn&#8217;t make final cut.

I usually play them from the earliest to the latest about once every year or two.  My heart sinks as I approach ""Limelight"".  I find it to be a trial to sit through.  It seems to drone on and on, and be filled with bathos.If I hear Claire Bloom say ""Calvero"" over again, and whine on and on about life, I will probably scream.  Actually the best part of the movie by far is when Chaplin slaps her.  This is what we wanted to do for the first 6 or 7 hours the movie appears to last.  The only other highlight is of course Chaplin's encounters with Buster Keaton, although why we hear no one laughing during their music routine, I don't know.  It really ruins it.

""This is the story of passing the limelight from old to young. In this case a world weary has-been clown beaten down by life ("" I think I'm dying, but then I'm not sure, I've died so many times before "") and a young ballerina whom he rescues from committing suicide ("" What's your hurry? ""). She  gets thrown out of her apartment for the attempt and ends up convalescing in the flat above, where her neighbor, the once great Calvero spends his days in drink.It's a wonderfully told tale, though it must be admitted it's as sentimental as the Sermon on the Mount and as corny as a Chopin nocturne. Furthermore Chaplin indulges himself with dialogue that  matches the ending speech of the barber in The Great Dictator.I hope you can forgive him these faults and enjoy the movie.

He must once again remember toshake off  the bumps and bruises he, as well as every performer,  must face from critics as well as the general public not to mention the man he sees in his ownmirror every day.LIMELIGHT is a talking picture and once again Chaplin did the music as wellas the dialogue.  It is a funny film with dramatic moments and with theincomparble Chaplin I believe sincerely trying to inform us as well as maybe just get on record what he felt that  he put into his films and how he felt about his career and, really, his life.This two disc WB release from 2003 comes in two languages as wellas five different language subtitles and is a very high quality product.Five Stars.",5,Limelight (2 Disc Special Edition),1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2028,"['reveiw', 'film', 'Limelight', '1952', 'Charlie', 'Chaplinfilm', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'US', 'release', 'hisall', 'somewhat', 'belated', 'homecoming', 'when', 'was', 'forgiven', 'early', '1970s.I', 'believe', 'story', 'Chaplin', 'went', 'England', 'premiereof', 'LIMELIGHT', 'was', 'told', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'was', 'not', 'welcomeback', 'United', 'States.All', 'left', 'leaning', 'politics', 'doubt', ""it'sclear"", 'lengthy', 'well', 'publicised', 'career', 'hesometimes', 'used', 'fame', 'help', 'underpriviledged', 'people', 'times', 'campaign', 'relatively', 'unpopular', 'not', 'controversial', 'causes.Also', 'fact', 'never', 'bothered', 'become', 'US', 'citizen', 'reallygot', 'many', 'folk', 'skin.But', 'aside', 'still', 'have', 'late', 'film', 'sort', 'autobiographicalone', 'think', 'clear', 'Chaplin', 'publicly', 'grip', 'withhis', 'fame', 'how', 'fleeting', 'really', 'feelingson', 'performing', 'as', 'well', 'thoughts', 'other', 'performers', 'relationshipswith', 'them.By', 'way', 'story', 'place', 'vaudeville', 'era', 'moviestook', 'much', 'showbiz.In', 'story', 'Chaplin', 'Calvero', 'aging', 'slowly', 'fading', 'vaudeville', 'starwho', 'young', 'suicidal', 'ballerina', 'course', 'process', 'rediscoversthe', 'courage', 'continue', 'career', 'well', 'must', 'once', 'again', 'remember', 'toshake', 'off', 'bumps', 'bruises', 'as', 'well', 'performer', 'must', 'face', 'critics', 'as', 'well', 'general', 'public', 'not', 'mention', 'man', 'ownmirror', 'day.LIMELIGHT', 'talking', 'picture', 'once', 'again', 'Chaplin', 'did', 'music', 'wellas', 'dialogue', 'funny', 'film', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'theincomparble', 'Chaplin', 'believe', 'sincerely', 'trying', 'inform', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'just', 'get', 'record', 'what', 'felt', 'put', 'films', 'how', 'felt', 'career', 'really', 'life.This', 'two', 'disc', 'WB', 'release', '2003', 'two', 'languages', 'wellas', 'five', 'different', 'language', 'subtitles', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'product.Five', 'Stars']",N/A

A shadow of his former self, Calvero, the great clown performer, is reduced to street performances and passing the hat for money. What will definitely stir the movie viewer is that even in the age difference, the drinking binges, and the apparent class differences, the ballerina, Thereza, wants to marry Calvero and that she &quot;would do anything&quot; to make the clown happy.
