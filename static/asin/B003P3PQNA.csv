It also has a great message, that no matter what happens, no matter what the odds, you can overcome them. You just have to keep fighting on. Even though it may seem expensive this is well worth it. Its also loaded with lots of extra features that let you see how they made the show and all the work that goes into shows like this.As far as people having trouble with it playing and skipping I haven't had any trouble with that at all. I've been playing it on my xbox 360. But I may have just gotten a good copy, who knows. The show does come in one dvd container so its kind of jammed in there but everything is held well in place, not like some of the cheaper produced tv series that they force into one container of cheaply made plastic that ends up with the discs bouncing about inside.

The dub is quality for those who didn't watch this on syfy. Just looked back at the product page and there IS A DUB ON THIS! In case you were foolishly assuming that Amazon posted correct information. heh. I'll warn people who haven't watched the show- the first season is good, with a nice amount of plot and of course some complimetary fanservice. The second season however epic it may be, is  without coherent plot. There is a plot, but it does involve them throwing galaxies at the bad guy. Also, the fanservice gets a little out of hand with Yokos' outfit... But for the price I paid, it was definitely worth it. The one thing I will say is that when I opened it one of the dvds had popped out, but that has only happened once and it is a slimpack or thinpack case. It doesn't have the individual dvd cases, but that saves a lot of room on your shelf and keeps the price low. Also, I'd classify this for young adults/teens. Probably not something to get for a real young-un if only because they won't appreciate it. There isn't much more to say on this that can't be picked up by checking reviews of the series itself online so yeah- for the price a good buy.

Basically I was desperate a while ago to see some of the best anime of the decade (2000's) and thought I'd give this a try. On a certain list this series appeared around the top five, so I thought what the heck, give it a go.The first seven episodes are nice, though seeing a bunch of pigs fly up to the 'ceiling of heaven' may be a bit too stylish and turn off first-timers. Then we get the dramatic turn of events--well, only for awhile--and the series begins to be about an avenging quest for one of the lost heroes. This is all nice, and they keep you watching with good characterization and fun action (having robots that are faces, on top of the whole mecha thing, makes me wonder whether the whole thing is constructed to be a parody of mecha-anime, or simply to wink at how serious and dramatic those series have been in the past, or if Gurren Lagann simply refuses to take itself seriously), but I kept waiting for a genius ending to redeem some of the stupidity and mindlessness of the whole thing. Basically what we have here is a fun series that doesn't take itself too seriously but never reaches the heights of a Eureka 7 or a Last Exile (LE in particular is very worth seeing). I wouldn't consider Lagann a top anime of the decade or really an essential, must-see release. It's fun, and you can get into the characters sometimes, but the ending let me down pretty bad. I think that perhaps the original author didn't have any idea how the last villains, or creatures, or bad guys (the ultimate bad guys) were going to look. It's something that happens with manga (if this was a manga, as another reviewer said) a lot of times: they have a really sweet first part to their story, but maybe they promise a little too much for the end, and an average conclusion doesn't really do it.Anyways, I'm not against Gurren Lagann in any way or fashion, I just think that what could have been excellent really fell off towards the second/third (especially third) parts.Warning: If you do get into it, you will want to finish, and the finish is quite underwhelming.",3,"ah, not bad but...",1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,2139,"['nice', 'series', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'fanatics', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Basically', 'was', 'desperate', 'while', 'ago', 'see', 'best', 'anime', 'decade', '2000', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'certain', 'list', 'series', 'appeared', 'top', 'five', 'thought', 'what', 'heck', 'give', 'go.The', 'first', 'seven', 'episodes', 'are', 'nice', 'seeing', 'bunch', 'pigs', 'fly', 'up', ""'ceiling"", 'heaven', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'stylish', 'turn', 'off', 'first-timers', 'Then', 'get', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'events', 'well', 'only', 'awhile', 'series', 'be', 'avenging', 'quest', 'one', 'lost', 'heroes', 'nice', 'keep', 'watching', 'good', 'characterization', 'fun', 'action', 'having', 'robots', 'are', 'top', 'whole', 'mecha', 'thing', 'wonder', 'whole', 'thing', 'constructed', 'be', 'parody', 'mecha-anime', 'simply', 'wink', 'how', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'Gurren', 'Lagann', 'simply', 'take', 'seriously', 'kept', 'waiting', 'genius', 'ending', 'redeem', 'stupidity', 'mindlessness', 'whole', 'thing', 'Basically', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'fun', 'series', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'never', 'heights', 'Eureka', '7', 'Last', 'Exile', 'LE', 'particular', 'very', 'worth', 'seeing', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Lagann', 'top', 'anime', 'decade', 'really', 'essential', 'must-see', 'release', 'fun', 'can', 'get', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'ending', 'let', 'down', 'pretty', 'bad', 'think', 'perhaps', 'original', 'author', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'last', 'villains', 'creatures', 'bad', 'guys', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'going', 'look', 'something', 'manga', 'was', 'manga', 'reviewer', 'said', 'lot', 'times', 'have', 'really', 'sweet', 'first', 'part', 'story', 'maybe', 'promise', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'average', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'it.Anyways', ""'m"", 'not', 'Gurren', 'Lagann', 'way', 'fashion', 'just', 'think', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'really', 'fell', 'off', 'second/third', 'especially', 'third', 'parts.Warning', 'do', 'get', 'will', 'want', 'finish', 'finish', 'quite', 'underwhelming']",N/A
1356551,A13VBXAMKNK95X,B003P3PQNA,Kerick Howlett,"[0, 0]","This 26 episode anime series is about a little kid named Simon, a young boy that lives in an underground city that is unbelievably talented at making tunnels. As well as a charismatic trouble maker whom is quite frankly crazy in my opinion, but whenever he speaks you feel pump, named Kamina! They come across this little head looking robot that they named Lagann, and when they do it unleashes a fury of hell rained upon them as a monster looking giant robot called a Beastman falls down upon their city. That is when they also come across a femme fatale freedom fighter, and probably by far one of the hottest and sexiest woman in Anime history, Yoko. Together all three of these heroes band together to free the humans from the oppression from the Beastmen!It is a very good show to say the least, and it got me in a few awe as well as touching moments too. But the second half of the series will seriously screw with your senses! Not to give too much away, lets just say it involves throwing entire galaxies like their frisbies (and no I'm not joking nor is that a metaphor). Also the pacing of the series in general is way too fast. There are so many characters you want to like but there is so little time to feel a connection for, or to feel like you experienced the long journey with them. In my opinion, the only one you really feel a strong connection for is Kamina within such a short amount of time!The animation kind of starts out choppy at first but it soon starts to really get flowing as the show progresses, it has an awesome sound track in my opinion, and the dubbing by the people of Bandai is pretty good. But most of all I will admit, you will hear some awesome as well as just as many corny speeches in this show, but they will all have you shouting through gritted teeth, &#34;F-Yeah!&#34;So I highly suggest you rent this first wherever you can find it, or watch it on Netflix as it is on the instant watch, do that first.

1356558,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B003P3PQNA,Sean,"[0, 0]","Gurren Lagann is arguably one of the greatest anime series of all time, and for good reason. I just started watching it yesterday. And I got through all 27 episodes in the course of the past thirty-six hours. It was that freaking good. There are so many things that have been said about this anime that I know when I say will sound repetitive, but you hear these things for good reason. This is a series that as a fan of anime, I can safely say has something for everyone.Gurren Lagann does not have the greatest story of any anime. The situations we see in the series are exciting and well thought out, but the story isn't the strongest point of the series. It starts with a post-apocalyptic sort of survival story, an uprising of humanity that is a common theme of science fiction stories, but it is done in such a spectacular way through the giant robot battles and ultra exciting war-like fights that are bigger than any fights in any anime. Part two takes us seven years in the future where we see a much more renaissance-like version of sci-fi that works fantastically with the previous arc. Without spoiling anything, something heads for Earth, we see a distinct change in humanities priorities and we encounter what is essentially God. This isn't untold of in a Gainax anime, I knew from the start that something religious-like would happen. Not that it is in your face and quite as prevalent as that of Neon Genesis Evangelion, but it is still there if you look into it a bit.So, the story is good, but not amazing. The story shines in the politics of the second half and what happens there, but otherwise it is a lot more character driven than story. Though I must say that the background story is fleshed out well. But overall, I wasn't sticking around for the story as much as the characters.Some will hate the animation style, some will love it. I personally found its' bright colors and smooth animation to be great. It's supposed to invoke in you a nostalgic feeling of eighties mecha animes and it does that. But it also maintains a bit of that modern feel with how vivid the colors are. The Beastmen and robots look great and have the feel of old school anime.The sound is fantastic. The voice actors are all great for one thing and convey emotions well. The music is great, the opening music being catchy and a good start, the ending music being good as well. The music during the show helps pump you up during fight scenes and convey the mood of the characters during sadder scenes. The explosions are great sounding and I can't find a single problem with the sound.You keep watching this series quite simply for the vast array of well thought out and typically well fleshed out characters. Every character is distinct in their actions, voice, and mindset and as the series progresses each one is pushed to the limit and also show their true colors. Even the bad guys are fleshed out well. Each character reflects humanity in a different respect. It's just hard to describe the characters without giving away a spoiler or going through each character and who they are. I did not dislike a single character. Of course, throughout they become bitchy or whiny, but they act like humans would act. If Gainax got one thing right with this series, it was characters. I'm going out on a limb, but I'm going to say it:Gurren Lagann has the best cast of anime characters ever.I went and did it. Take your teenage angst ridden robot riders elsewhere, while some of the characters do act like wusses at points, it's because seriously terrible things have happened. People actually die in this series and it hurts the person watching, as well as severely affects the characters. This series gets characters right and everyone will find a favorite.I'm going to say something about reviewing anime real quick. It's tough to rate different anime on a 1-10 scale because there are all different kinds of anime. I rate this over Samurai Champloo but that's not to say this will be better liked than Samurai Champloo because these anime cater to two different crowds, have two different styles. It's hard for me to convey in reviews how much somebody else may like an anime because everyone has different things they like. I love my adult techno-thriller and hardcore sci fi kind of anime. But this is not exactly for those kind of people.You see what I'm saying? It's hard to review Fruits Basket on the same scale as Gurren Lagann because they cater to two different audiences. It's the loophole of being a critic. You rate on the scale that the complete opposite is reviewed on.Anyway, regardless of what you like, there is something to like in this. There's romance, mechs, action, some deeper psychological thinking, hard science fiction, fantasy elements. It mixes all of these with great characters, fantastic dialogue, amazing action scenes, a great animation style, and it wraps up in a satisfying (though sad) conclusion that doesn't leave any plot threads open for you to have to think over.Gurren Lagann is now one of my favorite anime. I can never pick a number one favorite anime because I like stuff catering to different audiences and it's hard to choose one over the other because of how different they are. But this is most definitely one of the best animes I've ever seen.Well met Gurren Lagann. I'm sure I'll be coming back for a reacquaintance sometime soon.",4,Manly Men Throw Galaxies at Each Other While Saying Cool Things,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,5380,"['Gurren', 'Lagann', 'arguably',
