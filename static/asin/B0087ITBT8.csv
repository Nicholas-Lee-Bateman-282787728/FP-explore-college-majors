1547903,AXOZ5BWOEDL76,B0087ITBT8,,"[0, 0]","The Guilt Trip [2012] [Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy] STREISAND AND ROGEN SHINE!Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen are the perfect comedy duo, as they embark on one mother of a road trip! The plan for a quick stop at Mom's takes a sudden turn when an impulse compels Andy [Seth Rogen] to invite his mother, Joyce [Barbra Streisand], on an 8-day, 3,000 mile, and journey across the country. But the farther they go, the closer they get and Andy may realize that they have more in common than he ever imagined.Cast: Barbra Streisand, Seth Rogen, Brett Cullen, Adam Scott, Ari Graynor, Casey Wilson, Colin Hanks, Yvonne Strahovski, Jeff Kober, Miriam Margolyes, Kathy Najimy, Dale Dickey, Nora Dunn, Brandon Keener and Danny PudiDirector: Anne FletcherProducers: Evan Goldberg, John Goldwyn and Lorne MichaelsScreenwriter: Dan FogelmanComposer: Christophe BeckCinematography: Oliver StapletonResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.85:1Audio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French: 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish: 5.1 Dolby Digital and Portuguese: 5.1 Dolby DigitalSubtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish and PortugueseRunning Time: 95 minutesRegion: Region A/1Number of discs: 2Studio: Paramount PicturesAndrew's Blu-ray Review - The Guilt Trip probably represents the only point in time when the careers of Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen synchronize enough to bring them together for a two-hander. Somehow, a mother-son road trip comedy seemed like the right move for both entertainers, separated by two generations and distant fan bases.Music legend Barbra Streisand began her film career forty-five years ago with a Best Actress Oscar win. A Golden Globe fixture who graduated to directing and producing, 71-year-old Streisand wields a staggered but respected filmography. Seth Rogen, who just turned 31, emerged as the comedic voice of his generation six summers ago when two of his raunchy R-rated comedies (Judd Apatow's Knocked Up and the Rogen-penned Superbad) were among the year's most successful and acclaimed films. Within two years, doubt began to form over his leading man status and since 2011's The Green Hornet showed him people weren't any crazier about him as fit, sarcastic superhero than as his signature chubby, sarcastic stoner, he and Hollywood have been rethinking his calling.Based on this trajectory, you might think Streisand was slumming in a desperate attempt to appeal to young people. In reality, though, her filmmaking legacy had been tarnished by her first two 21st century acting credits: playing Ben Stiller's mother in the sequels Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers. The first of those was outrageously successful, though only moderately popular. The second was neither. Thus, a Streisand-Rogen pairing held rebound potential for both of its stars.With a script by rising Dan Fogelman (Crazy, Stupid, Love., Tangled) and a Christmastime release date, the film seemed destined to do solid holiday season business and vie for some Golden Globes in the Comedy or Musical categories. Alas, Guilt Trip would do neither of those things, grossing a weak $37.1 million on a $40 million budget and picking up just a single award nomination of the undesirable variety (Streisand for the Worst Actress Razzie). Embarrassingly, the night before the Golden Globe nominations were announced, an overconfident Paramount uploaded a promo celebrating the Best Actress nod Streisand actually wouldn't get.Fogelman doesn't offer much in the way of originality or complexity here. Andy Brewster [Seth Rogen] lives in California. His long-widowed mother Joyce [Barbra Streisand] lives in New Jersey. She fills his voicemail with conversational messages in expectation of a rare visit. Mom likes to question her son about his love life, to his discomfort. Meanwhile, Mom shoots down his reciprocal question by saying she values being single for the ability to enjoy fun size bags of Peanut M&M;'s immediately before and after bed. When Joyce reveals to Andy that he was named after her first boyfriend, a Florida advertiser who let her get away, Andy does some online sleuthing and tracks this former love to San Francisco. A bachelor with a Master's in chemistry, Andy is planning to take an eight-day road trip to pitch his creation, a new organic cleaning spray, to major retailers around the country. He decides to make San Francisco the final stop and invites Joyce to join him. Road trip!That sitcom premise takes nagging, cost-conscious mother and embarrassed son to sitcom stops for motel and diner sketches. In snowy Tennessee, Andy's high school sweetheart, now married and pregnant, recalls his rejected teenaged proposal to her. In Lubbock, Texas, Joyce gets an hour on the clock to eat a four-pound steak dinner in its entirety for free (or fail and pay $100). In Las Vegas, Joyce gets the thrill of playing actual slot machines and not just the cell phone equivalents.Meanwhile, Andy's pitches to the likes of Kmart and Costco are a disaster, with executives not responding to his scientific claims or prop usage while struggling with the product's tough to pronounce name (Scieoclean). Once Joyce suggests some ways to spice up his presentations, you can probably declare with ease where the film is heading and I don't just mean San Francisco and by the end of the film you want it to carry on.Streisand and Rogen, whose age difference is perfectly feasible thus highly unusual for Hollywood comedies, have decent chemistry together and better than you'd expect given the different circles they run in. Rogen's foul-mouthed, drug-based shtick is softened quite a bit, but not enough to defang his comedic chops. He and Streisand are believable representatives of their different generations and they are able to bounce off each other, at times with apparent improvisation.The material is never any better than a random episode of a mediocre twenty-year-old sitcom, but its comfort food comedy and the deliveries are good enough to unearth a bit of zest. Many of the beats are defiantly unoriginal: a man insisting on buying Joyce a drink at a cowboy bar, an uncomfortable book on tape, a mini-bar binge blow-up. But enough genuine details (e.g. Joyce's purse hook and insistence on hydration) emerge to distinguish the outing and prevent it from feeling like a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu embodying one of comedy cinema's most exploited conventions.Blu-ray Video Quality - The Guilt Trip's 1080p transfer isn't the most stunning thing ever released to high definition, but Paramount's stable, enjoyable presentation gets the job done. There are some gorgeous roadway and city shots; overhead highway images or dense downtown locations both reveal fantastic textures, crisp lines, and precise details even at a distance. General facial and clothing details are fine, though not really as crisp as those seen in the best Blu-ray releases. There is a light softness to parts of the image, and sometimes definition can be a little muddled, particularly in warmer locations such as a Texas steakhouse and a Vegas casino. Still, basic definition is just fine, particularly under good lighting. Colours are well balanced, favouring warmth in those more harshly lit environments and a more natural presence in those more naturally lit places. Black levels are not problematic, though flesh tones do look a bit rosy at times. The image suffers from no obvious bouts of digital tinkering, print wear, or compression issues. This isn't a breath-taking transfer, but it's a good, stable, clean high definition release that suits the movie well.Blu-ray Audio Quality - The Guilt Trip features the old ""technically proficient but sonically dull"" 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. No surprise, this is a dialogue-heavy film with little else to offer. Fortunately, the spoken word comes through as well as it can, playing with a natural, front-focused clarity. The track otherwise features some scattered ambient sound effects that help set the stage for various scenes and that enjoy natural, pinpoint positioning around the stage. Whether the light rattle inside the rental car and the minor whooshing sounds of passing traffic as heard when it's cruising down the interstate, booms of thunder and gusts of wind as heard in chapter six, or little Country music and general restaurant clatter as heard in chapter nine, the track presents the little supportive pieces quite effortlessly. This is certainly no massively immersive sort of presentation, but the basic quality is evident with every syllable and sound effect.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Barbra & Seth [7:32] Cast and crew take a look at the chemistry between the stars and the acting chops of Rogen and Streisand.

The former is an excellent 86 seconds that would have greatly enhanced the picture.Alternate Ending [2:08] adds a joke and gives Andy a potential love interest while reinforcing Joyce's.Gag Reel [5:09] Compilation outtakes revealing the production's giggly atmosphere and openness to improvisation. As in the other extras, F-bombs are bleeped here. The highlight comes in the end, as Streisand and Rogen talk Green Hornet and Green Lantern.Deleted Scenes [19:23] Underwear, Typical Weekend Plans, Chicken Dinner Uncut, Extended Mature Singles Club, Really Wonderful Man, Water Cooler Outtakes, That's All I'm Gonna Say, Rental Car, GPS, Amanda - The Receptionist, Parking, and Crush.UV Digital CopyDVD Copy [Feature Film] The DVD included here, identical to the one sold separately, contains no bonus features other than ""Previews"", which simply repeats the Star Trek Into Darkness, Jack Reacher, and Not Fade Away trailers with which the disc opens. Paramount has subscribed to the trend of devaluing DVD more than any other studio, seemingly altogether doing away with bonus features on the still most popular format. Adding insult to injury here, the DVD only uses 5.28 GB of a dual-layered disc's 8 GB capacity, meaning there is ample room for some of the dropped extras.Finally, The Guilt Trip is a pleasant surprise. It begins slowly but ends strongly, efficiently building up, breaking down, and again, but differently, building up its characters to a predictable but heart-warming and wholly satisfying resolution. The film works as well as it does because of the greatness of its leads; Rogen and Streisand are simply wonderful together. They understand the story, the characters, and one another so well that the relationship -- the entire dynamic, not just bits and pieces feel as authentic as most any other memorable cinema family. Don't let a slow start ruin the movie; it only gets better with every minute. Paramount's Blu-ray release of The Guilt Trip offers solid video, fine audio, and a few supplements.

1547904,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0087ITBT8,,"[0, 0]","""The Guilt Trip ""  stars Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen as mother and son who set out on a cross-country road trip as awkward entrepreneur Andrew (Rogen) pitches a new cleaning product to wholesalers.  Andrew's plan in taking along his widowed mom, Joyce, is to reunite her with a former young love who's now living in San Francisco.  If they meet and rekindle their long-ago romance, hopefully Joyce will quit focusing all her attention on Andrew and stop her endless henpecking.  Most of the film's gags are based on Andrew's embarrassment at traveling with his overbearing mother.The film is a sweet comedy with Streisand actually working at portraying a real character rather than a caricature.  More subdued than you might expect, she lets the writing do its job and never pushes too hard with the jokes.  Rogen is not his usual bawdy goof.  He elicits empathy as a smart man unable to sell his product or himself.  There's none of the R-rated language and off-color humor associated with his other screen work.  Director Anne Fletcher balances screen time pretty equally between Rogen and Streisand.Blu-ray bonus features include alternate openings and endings, several deleted scenes, gag reel, making-of short, profiles of Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen, and behind-the-scenes featurettes.",4,"Streisand & Rogen, Comedy Odd Couple",1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,1299,"['Guilt', 'Trip', 'stars', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'mother', 'son', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'cross-country', 'road', 'trip', 'awkward', 'entrepreneur', 'Andrew', 'Rogen', 'new', 'cleaning', 'product', 'wholesalers', 'Andrew', 'plan', 'taking', 'along', 'widowed', 'mom', 'Joyce', 'reunite', 'former', 'young', 'love', 'who', 'now', 'living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'meet', 'rekindle', 'long-ago', 'romance', 'hopefully', 'Joyce', 'will', 'quit', 'focusing', 'attention', 'Andrew', 'stop', 'endless', 'henpecking', 'Most', 'film', 'gags', 'are', 'based', 'Andrew', 'embarrassment', 'traveling', 'overbearing', 'mother.The', 'film', 'sweet', 'comedy', 'Streisand', 'actually', 'working', 'portraying', 'real', 'character', 'rather', 'caricature', 'More', 'subdued', 'might', 'expect', 'writing', 'do', 'job', 'never', 'pushes', 'too', 'hard', 'jokes', 'Rogen', 'not', 'usual', 'bawdy', 'goof', 'smart', 'man', 'unable', 'sell', 'product', 'none', 'R-rated', 'language', 'off-color', 'humor', 'associated', 'other', 'screen', 'work', 'Director', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', 'screen', 'time', 'pretty', 'equally', 'Rogen', 'Streisand.Blu-ray', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'alternate', 'openings', 'endings', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'making-of', 'short', 'profiles', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes']",The Guilt Trip

1547910,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B0087ITBT8,,"[0, 0]","When I first heard about GUILT TRIP, I imagined a seriously hilarious film. What could be funnier than a road trip with Barbra Streisand? Unfortunately, the potential fun of this movie is missed and we have a slow-moving and rather tedious film--at least for a good portion of this adventure.Streisand  as Joyce Brewster is rather toned down from the Barbra we have seen through the years. She's a fairly normal middle-class widow living in suburbia when her son Andy (Seth Rogan) invites her on a cross-country road trip. Surprisingly, it's not about a guilt trip. Joyce coddles her son and believes in his greatness. She's not critical yet there is tension in their relationship and the reason is never clear.THE GUILT TRIP moves so slowly and there is barely a chuckle. Rogan and Streisand seem to have a potential for great chemistry but the problem seems to be the uninspired script. The film plods on and on until the fateful emotional blow-up between mother and son. Again, the reason for this tension is never fully explored and it's Andy who has the unexplained chip on his shoulder. Just when there seems no hope for this film, it makes an amazing recovery as mother and son come to terms with their relationship and realize how much they mean to each other.Suddenly, we finally have the film we should have had all along. The road trip becomes fun and joyous as mother and son get to know each other and their disappointments and challenges in life. Surprisingly, the last part of the film is rather heartwarming, delightful and moving. Some might be moved to shed a tear or two over the sweetness and gentleness of the last scenes. These last 20-30 minutes or so of THE GUILT TRIP make up for the pointlessness of the film and make it worth a watch. It's only sad the greatness of the last part of the film could not have been seem throughout THE GUILT TRIP.",3,SLOW AND BLAND MISSES ITS POTENTIAL,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,1870,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'GUILT', 'TRIP', 'imagined', 'seriously', 'hilarious', 'film', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'funnier', 'road', 'trip', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Unfortunately', 'potential', 'fun', 'movie', 'missed', 'have', 'slow-moving', 'rather', 'tedious', 'film', 'least', 'good', 'portion', 'adventure.Streisand', 'Joyce', 'Brewster', 'rather', 'toned', 'down', 'Barbra', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'fairly', 'normal', 'middle-class', 'widow', 'living', 'suburbia', 'when', 'son', 'Andy', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'cross-country', 'road', 'trip', 'Surprisingly', 'not', 'guilt', 'trip', 'Joyce', 'son', 'greatness', 'not', 'critical', 'yet', 'tension', 'relationship', 'reason', 'never', 'clear.THE', 'GUILT', 'TRIP', 'so', 'slowly', 'barely', 'chuckle', 'Rogan', 'Streisand', 'seem', 'have', 'potential', 'great', 'chemistry', 'problem', 'be', 'uninspired', 'script', 'film', 'plods', 'fateful', 'emotional', 'blow-up', 'mother', 'son', 'Again', 'reason', 'tension', 'never', 'fully', 'explored', 'Andy', 'who', 'unexplained', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'Just', 'when', 'hope', 'film', 'amazing', 'recovery', 'mother', 'son', 'come', 'terms', 'relationship', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'mean', 'other.Suddenly', 'finally', 'have', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'along', 'road', 'trip', 'fun', 'joyous', 'mother', 'son', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'disappointments', 'challenges', 'life', 'Surprisingly', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'rather', 'heartwarming', 'delightful', 'moving', 'might', 'be', 'moved', 'shed', 'tear', 'two', 'sweetness', 'gentleness', 'last', 'scenes', 'last', '20-30', 'minutes', 'so', 'THE', 'GUILT', 'TRIP', 'make', 'up', 'pointlessness', 'film', 'make', 'watch', 'only', 'sad', 'greatness', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'seem', 'THE', 'GUILT', 'TRIP']",The Guilt Trip

1547912,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0087ITBT8,,"[10, 21]","I'll admit it...I got suckered by the previews for THE GUILT TRIP.  Although I'm not a big fan of Barbra Streisand, the movie looked like a bit of a guilty pleasure...a mis-matched road trip with mother & son.  Rogen and Streisand appeared to actually have pretty good chemistry together, and while I figured the laughs would be cheap and obvious, they might also be plentiful.Well, I was roughly half right.  The laughs WERE cheap and obvious, but not very plentiful.  And many of the best ones were shown in the previews (and some of THOSE were not in the movie until the closing credits ""deleted scene"" montage).  The chemistry WAS there, but it included a lot more sadness and anger than such a lightweight movie really could carry.Rogen plays Streisand's chemist son.  After years working with the EPA, he has developed a wonderful, renewable, totally safe and effective home cleaning product and has invested everything into selling it to big retail establishments.  He is, in fact, about to launch a cross-country road trip, starting in New Jersey in an effort to sell his product.  It just so happens that his mother lives right there, so he spends a couple of days visiting her too.  He feels bad that his mother is a bit lonely (she's been a widow for over 20 years), so he impulsively invites her to accompany him on his 8-day road trip.  Hilarity ensues (or at least, it should).Turns out Rogen is a terrible sales-person...and his pitch meetings with the corporate types are more pathetic than funny.  He's so awkward and ill-prepared.  It stretches credulity, especially when it's actually played fairly straight, rather than for broad laughs.And it turns out that Streisand is quite annoying.  Yes, she's annoying to her son with her constant chattering.  Her steady mix of over-bearing mother and condescending critic.  Yes, she's clearly a stereotypical ""Jewish mother"" and who better to play her?  But it all begins to blend together as just so much noise in our heads, and probably that's the way Rogen hears it too!The plot itself (will Rogen make a sale, will Streisand meet a guy) is quite predictable, and yields few surprises.  BUT, if you saw the trailer, you likely are not expecting big surprises or innovation.  The film doesn't need to surprise us.The two stars do have some amusing exchanges...don't misunderstand me.  Streisand does something outrageous and Rogen mumbles something under his breath that is amusing.  But there are very few out-loud laughs to be had.  The movie has a tough time finding a balance between its moments of near slapstick with its more serious encounters.  There is a lot of pain and sadness that these two characters are burdened with, and this hangs like a weight around a movie that clearly wants to be light on its feet and even wacky.It's possible to strike a balance like that (Apatow has done it numerous times and Rogen certainly can do it)...but THE GUILT TRIP misses out.  But don't get me wrong...it is modestly entertaining and amusing, and while I can't recommend you run right out and see it, don't let it completely pass you by either.  I should also say, at the risk of sounding like a fuddy-duddy, that it's probably going to be more amusing for fans of Barbra than for fans of Seth Rogen.  Despite bursts of bad language, it has a decidedly old-fashioned feel to it that might equate to ""too slow"" for a generation more accustomed to the rhythms of THE HANGOVER.",3,"Has it's charms, but isn't as funny as I had expected.",1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,3440,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'got', 'suckered', 'previews', 'THE', 'GUILT', 'TRIP', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'movie', 'looked', 'bit', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mis-matched', 'road', 'trip', 'mother', 'son', 'Rogen', 'Streisand', 'appeared', 'actually', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'figured', 'laughs', 'would', 'be', 'cheap', 'obvious', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'plentiful.Well', 'was', 'roughly', 'half', 'right', 'laughs', 'WERE', 'cheap', 'obvious', 'not', 'very', 'plentiful', 'many', 'best', 'ones', 'were', 'shown', 'previews', 'THOSE', 'were', 'not', 'movie', 'closing', 'deleted', 'scene', 'montage', 'chemistry', 'WAS', 'there', 'included', 'lot', 'more', 'sadness', 'anger', 'lightweight', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'carry.Rogen', 'plays', 'Streisand', 'chemist', 'son', 'years', 'working', 'EPA', 'developed', 'wonderful', 'renewable', 'totally', 'safe', 'effective', 'home', 'cleaning', 'product', 'invested', 'everything', 'selling', 'big', 'retail', 'establishments', 'fact', 'launch', 'cross-country', 'road', 'trip', 'starting', 'New', 'Jersey', 'effort', 'sell', 'product', 'just', 'so', 'mother', 'right', 'there', 'couple', 'days', 'visiting', 'too', 'bad', 'mother', 'bit', 'lonely', 'been', 'widow', '20', 'years', 'so', 'impulsively', 'accompany', '8-day', 'road', 'trip', 'Hilarity', 'least', 'should', 'out', 'Rogen', 'terrible', 'sales-person', 'pitch', 'meetings', 'corporate', 'types', 'are', 'more', 'pathetic', 'funny', 'so', 'awkward', 'ill-prepared', 'credulity', 'especially', 'when', 'actually', 'played', 'fairly', 'straight', 'rather', 'broad', 'laughs.And', 'out', 'Streisand', 'quite', 'annoying', 'Yes', 'annoying', 'son', 'constant', 'chattering', 'steady', 'mix', 'over-bearing', 'mother', 'condescending', 'critic', 'Yes', 'clearly', 'stereotypical', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'who', 'better', 'play', 'blend', 'together', 'as', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'noise', 'heads', 'probably', 'way', 'Rogen', 'too', 'plot', 'will', 'Rogen', 'make', 'sale', 'will', 'Streisand', 'meet', 'guy', 'quite', 'predictable', 'yields', 'few', 'surprises', 'BUT', 'saw', 'trailer', 'likely', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'big', 'surprises', 'innovation', 'film', ""n't"", 'need', 'surprise', 'us.The', 'two', 'stars', 'do', 'have', 'amusing', 'exchanges', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'Streisand', 'something', 'outrageous', 'Rogen', 'mumbles', 'something', 'breath', 'amusing', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'out-loud', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'movie', 'tough', 'time', 'finding', 'balance', 'moments', 'slapstick', 'more', 'serious', 'encounters', 'lot', 'pain', 'sadness', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'burdened', 'hangs', 'weight', 'movie', 'clearly', 'be', 'light', 'feet', 'even', 'wacky.It', 'possible', 'strike', 'balance', 'Apatow', 'done', 'numerous', 'times', 'Rogen', 'certainly', 'can', 'do', 'THE', 'GUILT', 'TRIP', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'modestly', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'run', 'right', 'out', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'completely', 'should', 'also', 'say', 'risk', 'sounding', 'fuddy-duddy', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'amusing', 'fans', 'Barbra', 'fans', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'bursts', 'bad', 'language', 'decidedly', 'old-fashioned', 'feel', 'might', 'equate', 'too', 'slow', 'generation', 'more', 'accustomed', 'rhythms', 'THE', 'HANGOVER']",The Guilt Trip
