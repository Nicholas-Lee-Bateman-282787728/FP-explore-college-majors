1407390,AXUDXQFT83YO9,B004GWBSTA,"John Gough ""John Gough - Deakin University""","[2, 4]","Joe Maddison's War was broadcast yesterday, as I type, in Australia. I was moved by the personal drama, and very interested in the Home Guard action. As many other reviewers have commented, the casting is excellent, although Robson Green LOOKS too young to have been in World War I. Kevin Whatley shows his qualities as an actor of principle and pathos.I am interested in, but question, some of the historical detail, noting another reviewer's sharp-eyed comments on the mis-use of Army-issue Lee Enfield .303 rifles for rank-and-file Home Guard.I was unable to identify any particular German aircraft in the two (computer-animated) air-raids.Although I have no formal training or practice in aircraft recognition, it has been an interest of mine for decades. I would have expected a possible Heinkel III or Dornier 217 to be a bit more obvious: or possible a Junkers 88. I was also surprised to see the German planes flying in such regimented formation, and flying so low. But I know some allowances must be made, visually, and conceptually, with CGI animation.I am also not an expert at recognising anti-aircraft artillery (""ack-ack"", as the British called it then). But the 4.5 inch gun they show seemed more like a 3.8 inch (I may have the calibres mis-stated, doing so from memory, and without checking details on Wikipedia). Nor am I aware that Home Guard troops ever served on active ack-ack duties. Maybe someone else can enlighten us.Similarly, I do not think that masses formations of German bombers raided England after the end of the Blitz, although small tip-and-run raids were frequent after the Blitz.I can, however, with confidence explain about the land-mine. This was not the small anti-vehicle or anti-personnel land-mine. It was actually a naval mine, larger than a man, a cylinder (not the classic sphere with detonator-horns) full of explosive. When the Germans wanted to drop the largest possible aerial bomb, during the London Blitz, they had no large bombs (such as the 2000 pound ""cookie"" that Bomber Command used in the latter years of the war). The naval mine was the largest explosive device available. But as it was not contained in a hardened steel case, but was designed to be gently launched from a mine-laying boat and anchored to the sea-bed, waiting for a passing ship's magnetic field to detonate it, when it was dropped from a plane it had to be more softly landed -- by parachute. Although it was then designed to detonate on landing, many landed with fiendish delayed fuses, or broken fuses. Being naval mines, they were then defused (when possible) by Royal Navy personnel: extremely brave men, many of whom were killed in the attempt to defuse such weapons.

It wasn't what I expected, but it turned out to be a movie that I love, and will be glad to show others.  I'm glad that Kevin W., is the star so that we can see him do what he does so well: make it look so real. This is a sweet story, even in the midst of WW II, and that is something for that timeframe! Would certainly recommend if you like Mr. Wheatley or Robson Green.

1407392,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B004GWBSTA,Richard B. Schwartz,"[1, 1]","Kevin Whately is one of many people's favorite actors.  Here he is at home in Tyneside, during the second world war.  As a ship builder he will not be drafted; besides, he had already fought at the battle of the Somme and has paid his dues.  When his wife leaves him for a naval officer, he joins the Home Guard with several of his mates, including the excellent Robson Green (from Wire in the Blood).  The local chemist (pharmacist), played by Derek Jacobi, reverts to his old rank of major and suddenly becomes their boss.  In addition to taking a leadership role in the Guard, Joe Maddison meets a new woman.  When his wife returns, with a daughter in hand, Joe must decide whether to divorce her or stay with her.  The local Catholic priest has his own views of course, but Joe is not a Catholic; his wife is.  So where will this go?This is essentially a small movie with a sweet subject.  It has the look and feel of a made-for-TV movie, except for the A-list actors.  The script is not up to the quality of a Morse or Lewis episode, but Kevin makes the most of relatively average material and shines in the role.  Anyone who likes traditional films will like Joe Maddison's War.  One caveat: there are no subtitles, but there are, of course, heavy Geordie accents.  Turn up the volume and listen very carefully.",4,Kevin Shines,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1317,"['Kevin', 'Whately', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Here', 'home', 'Tyneside', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'ship', 'builder', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'drafted', 'besides', 'had', 'already', 'fought', 'battle', 'Somme', 'paid', 'dues', 'When', 'wife', 'naval', 'officer', 'Home', 'Guard', 'several', 'mates', 'including', 'excellent', 'Robson', 'Green', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'local', 'chemist', 'pharmacist', 'played', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'old', 'rank', 'major', 'suddenly', 'boss', 'addition', 'taking', 'leadership', 'role', 'Guard', 'Joe', 'Maddison', 'new', 'woman', 'When', 'wife', 'returns', 'daughter', 'hand', 'Joe', 'must', 'decide', 'divorce', 'stay', 'local', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'own', 'views', 'course', 'Joe', 'not', 'Catholic', 'wife', 'So', 'where', 'will', 'go', 'essentially', 'small', 'movie', 'sweet', 'subject', 'look', 'feel', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'A-list', 'actors', 'script', 'not', 'up', 'quality', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'episode', 'Kevin', 'most', 'relatively', 'average', 'material', 'shines', 'role', 'Anyone', 'who', 'traditional', 'films', 'will', 'like', 'Joe', 'Maddison', 'War', 'One', 'caveat', 'are', 'subtitles', 'are', 'course', 'heavy', 'Geordie', 'accents', 'Turn', 'up', 'volume', 'listen', 'very', 'carefully']",N/A
