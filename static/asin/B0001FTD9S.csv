803587,A2VWKIQO8CD2W9,B0001FTD9S,BJG,"[0, 0]",I had a copy of this that got damaged by my vcr so I was happy to find this available.  I love it on days that I only have time (or energy) for a quick 20 minute workout.  It is an easy routine to follow and the songs are original and very motivating.  As usual Richard is full of energy and encouraging.  I would reccommend this to anyone at any fitness level.,5,Great Workout,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,361,"['had', 'copy', 'got', 'damaged', 'vcr', 'so', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'available', 'love', 'days', 'only', 'have', 'time', 'energy', 'quick', '20', 'minute', 'workout', 'easy', 'routine', 'follow', 'songs', 'are', 'original', 'very', 'motivating', 'usual', 'Richard', 'full', 'energy', 'encouraging', 'would', 'reccommend', 'anyone', 'fitness', 'level']",N/A
803588,A2DS7LJI7I58O7,B0001FTD9S,Chris,"[4, 4]","This is my favorite Richard Simmon's tape.  Looks deceptively easy, but it makes you work up a sweat.  Great for beginners or intermediate exercisers.  I enjoy this one; he says encouraging and motivational words at times during the workout and is easy to follow.  He is'nt as hyper as on the Sweatin To the Oldies series, and I don't feel like a dope when I do it.  Does'nt have cheesy remake songs; original music that he sometimes sings along to.  He makes me laugh, but does'nt act too silly.  And I get a great twenty minute workout.  I would recommend this tape to anyone who is starting to exercise or wants a time managable workout.  This tape and a few of his others remind me very much of when he was on the television show many moons ago!  He's very inspiring and motivational; helps lift your spirits and put a smile on your face while you exercise!  Just wish he would release all of these older ones on dvd!  They are my favorites!!!  As with all older vcr tapes, be sure to view it and make sure it plays correctly, and if not, contact the seller via [...]",5,My favorite Richard Simmon's tape.....,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,1071,"['favorite', 'Richard', 'Simmon', 'tape', 'Looks', 'deceptively', 'easy', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'Great', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'exercisers', 'enjoy', 'one', 'encouraging', 'motivational', 'words', 'times', 'workout', 'easy', 'follow', 'as', 'hyper', 'Sweatin', 'Oldies', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'dope', 'when', 'do', ""Does'nt"", 'have', 'cheesy', 'remake', 'songs', 'original', 'music', 'sings', 'laugh', ""does'nt"", 'act', 'too', 'silly', 'get', 'great', 'twenty', 'minute', 'workout', 'would', 'recommend', 'tape', 'anyone', 'who', 'starting', 'exercise', 'time', 'managable', 'workout', 'tape', 'few', 'others', 'remind', 'very', 'much', 'when', 'was', 'television', 'show', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'very', 'inspiring', 'motivational', 'lift', 'spirits', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'exercise', 'Just', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'older', 'ones', 'dvd', 'are', 'favorites', 'older', 'vcr', 'tapes', 'be', 'sure', 'view', 'make', 'sure', 'correctly', 'not', 'contact', 'seller', '[', ']']",N/A

803590,A13700AF4X40YG,B0001FTD9S,Loves Books in MD,"[31, 31]","I love this tape!  I'll be the first to tell you exercising can be a bore and a chore, but this one is so much fun that I actually WANT to do it!  None of the movements are difficult or strenuous, but it gets you moving to really catchy music with motivational messages.  Best yet, you feel great when you're done!  How can you go wrong?I bought it to augment days when I do a weights work out and feel like I need some cardio or just to move around a little bit.  At only 20 minutes, it's also a great routine to use when you don't have a lot of time but want to get some exercise in.  It would probably be a great start for someone who hasn't exercised in a long while and wants to get moving.  The steps are relatively easy to follow, although getting the moves down on any new routine is always a little challenging for grace-impaired me.  Nothing is terribly strenuous and you can pick it up in terms of how much you move as you get more fit.Bottom line, this is just a ""feel good"" tape with Richard Simmons at his best.  It's fun and you feel good and uplifted when you get done.  I went from dubious to an ardent Richard Simmons fan after buying a few of his videos and credit him for keeping me interested and motivated for the past 5-1/2 months.",5,Fun and Inspirational,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,1254,"['love', 'tape', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'tell', 'exercising', 'can', 'be', 'bore', 'chore', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'actually', 'WANT', 'do', 'None', 'movements', 'are', 'difficult', 'strenuous', 'moving', 'really', 'catchy', 'music', 'motivational', 'messages', 'Best', 'yet', 'feel', 'great', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'bought', 'augment', 'days', 'when', 'do', 'weights', 'work', 'out', 'feel', 'need', 'cardio', 'just', 'move', 'around', 'little', 'bit', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'also', 'great', 'routine', 'use', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'want', 'get', 'exercise', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'great', 'start', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'exercised', 'long', 'while', 'get', 'moving', 'steps', 'are', 'relatively', 'easy', 'follow', 'getting', 'moves', 'down', 'new', 'routine', 'always', 'little', 'challenging', 'grace-impaired', 'Nothing', 'terribly', 'strenuous', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'terms', 'how', 'much', 'move', 'get', 'more', 'fit.Bottom', 'line', 'just', 'feel', 'good', 'tape', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'best', 'fun', 'feel', 'good', 'uplifted', 'when', 'get', 'done', 'went', 'dubious', 'ardent', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'fan', 'buying', 'few', 'videos', 'credit', 'keeping', 'interested', 'motivated', 'past', '5-1/2', 'months']",N/A
