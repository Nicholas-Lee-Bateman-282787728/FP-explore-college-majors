638641,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B00005JO28,A Customer,"[3, 7]","This is the 2005 version of the Douglas Adams classic, and it's absolutely wonderful. Douglas was apparently involved in the screenwriting, but I don't know how much because he died before this was released. It isn't the wonderful book and it isn't the wonderful BBC TV series. It's a brilliant attempt to condense the spirit of what Douglas Adams wrote into a 109 minute movie. Tough job, eh? They did it. Yes they did.I am so in love with this film. It made me laugh a lot, it reminded me of many bits that didn't make it into the film, it added new bits that are wholly consistent with the four-part trilogy, and I don't care one whit that the plot diverges from time to time. The spirit is always there. And, somehow, they even slipped in the heart of the later Douglas Adams, by which I mean the guy who wrote Last Chance To See. This is simply excellent, and I will watch it again and again.Lest I have not been sufficiently blunt, I will try again. Get this! Two words, same as ""don't panic."" It is that simple. Get this. You will, like me, watch it more than once. If you want two more words, instant classic. If you think two word summaries suck, you are like me that way. But how does one sum up Mr. Adams in 2 or even 42? Damned if I know. But I feel this film did a far, far better job of it than I'm capable of doing. So there you go. There it is. I very love this DVD.The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe. They were setting up the possibility of a sequel here. I have no idea what Douglas Adams left behind in that respect. If the film is made, however, I will watch it. I respect just how well they did The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, so I'll watch the next one if there is a next one.

638642,A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G,B00005JO28,"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF""","[1, 12]","I'm sure a Douglas Adams devotee will tell me that I'm completely wrong about everything I'm about to say about ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""  From a literary standpoint, it's not even a blip on the map.  The writing is flat-out rubbish, the jokes are mild cheddar, the exchanges can be witty occasionally, and all the dialogue has the same kind of vernacular, where everything is said in an over-developed, verbose, drawn out method.  It's hard for characters to achieve any kind of roundness when they stay pretty much the same throughout the whole of the narrative.  I mean really, what's the point?Happily, it seems as though the writers for the movie have realized this and given these characters direction.  Instead of just being tour guides through Douglas Adams' off-the-wall interpretations of the meaning of life, we become emotionally invested in these characters in the film, albeit through the ready-made love interest angle.  But so what?  So much of the movie is rich in detail, delightful to look at, and the humor has been knocked up a few notches.  Mos Def was a perfect choice for Ford, and the honesty that Martin Freeman gives to Arthur Dent is touching when he's feeling defeated.  Hilarious when he's dead-panning.  I wish Bill Nighy would have been given more time, but I always feel that way about Bill Nighy.The story is rather improbable; Arthur Dent wakes up one morning to find bulldozers poised outside his house, ready to make short work of everything he owns.  ""You gotta build by-passes!""  Strangely enough, this is a microcosm for the planned demolition of Earth, and shortly after Arthur's house gets knocked over, Vogon ships hover in orbit around Earth, ready to blip it out of existence.He is rescued by his friend Ford, who writes for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a repository of interstellar knowledge and facts.  Much of the story exists merely to give voice to the entries in the book, particularily those dealing with theology and physics.  Incidentally, if you know any physicists, you will know that when put together, they form a sub-culture so distinct and annoying, that you would like to stuff them in a cannon, and shoot them into the sun.Eventually Arthur and Ford end up on the Starship Heart of Gold alongside Trillian (an old flame), Zaphod Beeblebrox (President of the Galaxy), and Marvin, a depressed-robot voiced by Professor Snape.  They ride off to the planet Magrathea to consult a giant computer for the answer to life, the universe and everything.  Incidentally, that gives you some idea as to how unique this world is.  Typically the answers to life are given by age-old monks, people like Yoda, who mix both biting criticism with profound wisdom.  When consulted, the computer yawns and could care less.  That's brilliant.  It even calls Zaphod stupid.It was a stroke of genius to not make the Vogons CGI animated atrocities.  It could have been easy to have gone totally Jar-Jar Bink on the whole operation and turned over the Vogons to the computer illustrators.  But somehow, they chose against this, which is nothing short of a cinematic miracle.  When you see the Vogons, you can smell them.  They're fat lips are chapped and cracking.  Their eyes are blood-shot and beady.  The teeth... my God the teeth.  Seriously, I think the whole movie industry has gone CGI mad lately, and it's a relief to actually look at something fantastical on the screen and it's real.  When it's real, it has the impact of a human walking into the room, something you can sink your teeth and other senses into.  When it's CGI, all you can think of is, ""Wow, it looks ALMOST entirely real!""The movie works because you feel as though the narrative in the film is moving forward, with Arthur discovering the truth about the creation of the planet as well as his love for Trillian.  Even when it goes sideways a bit and we meet Humma Kavula, a preacher for what is apparently the First Church of the Big Giant Nose.  This is done by John Malkovich, who was vastly underused in my opinion.  This slows down the movie a bit, but immediately things pick up again when Vogons track them down, capture Trillian, and shoot at nothing.Then the rescue sequence, which is brilliant as well because there's no guns blazing, no big chase, no over-the-top explosions or action sequences.  It involves waiting in line, filling out a form, and then waiting again.Again, Martin Freeman's performance has a lot to do with why this film is successful because he truly does sell the character well.  It would have been too easy to give it to someone like Jim Carrey and watch him ham it up with hideously overdone faces, wisecracks on the side, and his usual slapstick physicality.  Who can relate to that?I'm also in love with the British way of doing science fiction.  The Vogon ships are grimy, gritty, dull and nasty.  In America, it would have been all spotless set-pieces, overamped CGI, and too much focus on the ""gee wow!"" side of things.  This is a universe you can reach out and touch.",4,"Amazing, considering how unreadable the book is",1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,5037,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'devotee', 'will', 'tell',

After all these years of trying to make this movie we ended up with a very lack luster film.Main Problems:1.  The writers tried to hammer the thin plot of the book into a film formula story and sacrificed much of the humor and charm of the books (and other versions for that matter) in the process.2.  Alan Rickman really stunk as Marvin's voice which really surprised me.  He was so good in ""Galaxy Quest"" as the bitter actor playing the alien science officer that I thought he would be perfect but he completely missed Marvin's sense of loathing and bitterness, choosing to focus only on his depression.  Marvin should be acerbic and sarcastic, not just sad sounding.3.  Mos Def as Ford just didn't do it for me.  He didn't seem to get his character.4.  Sam Rockwell....actually he kind of grew on me through the film but not what Zaphod always suggested to me.5.  Too much Vogons.  I guess the producers wanted their money's worth out of Henson's creature shop but they sacrificed way too much ""real H2G2"" for created scenes about Vogons.6.  Bottom line:  Rather than making a film that the millions of H2G2 fans would have loved they tried to make something to appeal to people who had never heard of H2G2.The people who put this film together seemed to not understand what parts of the books and other versions make H2G2 so great.

I was even prepared for some new features, the Hitchhikers universe has always had a degree of script variation as it slipped from one format to another.  I was not however in any way ready for the way that the storyline was butchered and new plot threads put in, none of which work. Presumably the thought of a Sci Fi film without a space battle and dozens of laser blasting storm troopers or love interest was deemed ""too much out of the box"" for some target demographic or other. So they get stuck in, giving the Vogons way more screen time than they ever needed and Arthur Dent with a speech so treacly it must have rotted his teeth.Then we get to the casting, wrong, wrong, wrong  ! With the honourable exception of Alan Rickmans' Marvin and Steven Frys' book nobody manages to carry off the characters they're supposed to be with any conviction.In short, this is at best a film that should be called "" Inspired by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but only loosely"".

It was underbudgeted and cheesy, but it was true to the story line and had a charm that no amount of special effects can create. It even had a better Marvin. Can you imagine that? With all that money, technology, and the dry voice and wit of the incomparable Alan Rickman, the producers of this movie still managed to screw up Marvin. He looked like some kind of Pokemon character. If you are a fan of the book/radio show, don't ruin the memory by watching this movie.

I knew that they existed, but that's all I knew.  Then suddenly this movie comes along, and I keep hearing about how funny the books are and how much of a following they have (the movie Serenity was pushed back from April to September because they didn't want to have to compete with the fans of this franchise and the Star Wars franchise).  Even though I've never read the book (yet), I really wanted to see this movie, and I was not let down.The story follows Earth everyman Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman), who was saved by his best friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) seconds before the Earth was destroyed.  Prefect, despite looking human, is an alien researcher who has spent the past few years on Earth collecting information for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the most complete (and humorous) source of information available.  The pair hitch a ride with a Vogon ship that is blowing up the planet in order to build a hyperspace freeway.  Vogons are ugly  bureaucratic aliens that live only to work.  They can't do anything without the proper paperwork, and they write the thrid-worst poetry in the entire galaxy.Soon, Arthur and Ford are able to get to a ship carrying Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), who is the President of the Galaxy, Tricia ""Trillian"" MacMillon (Zooey Deschanel), a girl that Arthur met at a costume party once, and Marvin the depressed android (Warwick Davis is in the suit, Alan Rickman does the voice).  They are on the run because Beeblebrox kidnapped himself and stole the ship (did I mention he isn't the brightest star in the galaxy?), and they must outrun the Vogons while trying to find a planet where they can learn the ultimate question of life.Along the way, many bizarre and hilarious misadventures ensue, such as the use of the Infinite Improbability Drive (which leads to one of my favorite sight gags in the movie), meeting Hama Kavula (John Malkovich), Zaphod's opponent in the election, and the ""daring"" prison break.Since I haven't read the book yet, I don't know what was different, but I do know that, while there were differences, the overall tone remained the same because Adams himself wrote some of the changes (he specifically wrote the Kavula character for the movie).  If you are a fan of the books, you should definitely give this movie a chance.  If you've never read the books, you should really consider seeing this movie.

638657,A1BEYB12OGFPHB,B00005JO28,Anthony Regolino,"[9, 10]","I have loved this story ever since the radio show (which came before the books!) was brought to American airwaves courtesy of NPR Playhouse. I love the books as well and have a special place in my heart for the British TV show. I know the lines backward and forward, inside and out, and the one thought that kept popping up in my mind as I watched this new film was ""Where are the punchlines?"" Anyone familiar with the now-classic jokes will hear the characters setting up for a punch line--and then stopping before the gag is delivered! As previous reviewers pointed out, the story does not translate well into a concise storyline for film, and so the filmmakers tried to trim down the dialogue and concentrate more on plot. But the one thing that made this story a success to begin with was the hilarious diaolgue exchanged between characters under bizarre circumstances (and these funny lines survived through all previous incarnations: radio, books, & TV, until now). Plot, what there was of it, came second,and could be abandoned anytime Adams came up with a funny new direction to take the characters in. Since they were more interested in making a wacky space film instead of a truly hilarious one, they should have left out what original dialogue they kept (since it doesn't go anywhere here) and written entirely new dialogue that advances the plot more coherently. The new bits made up for this film were clever enough, and I believe even die-hard fans of the franchise will find something to enjoy. I think I liked it more this second time around on DVD than when I first saw it in the theaters. There were even things that I applaud them for. Take the cast for instance. Some actor choices were absolutely inspired, while others were horribly wrong. Mos Def, mumbling his lines in an attempt at an alien accent with no comedic timing whatsoever, ruined my favorite character for me, Ford Prefect. I was never crazy about the actor from the TV show, preferring the original radio performer, but now I think he's a comic genius compared to this film's actor. There will never be an Arthur Dent as good as the first, who played him in both radio and TV versions in such a way that he could never be replaced. (In fact, I recall hearing that the role was written with him in mind.) Having said that, I am glad that this new Arthur is nothing like the old one. In this case, any attempt at recreating the original would be an impersonation and not a performance, so it wise that they got someone entirely different for the film to make the role his own. I had thought Alan Rickman would be perfect as the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android, but his line readings were so pale compared to the original voice that I wasn't impressed. Now for the great choices: Zooey made a fantastic, adorable Trillian, taking a character that really wasn't originally a big part of the story (she was always off with Zaphod somewhere and hardly with Arthur at all) and making her into an absolutely necessary part of it all (a wise choice on the filmmakers' part; I think a lot of fans always wanted her and Arthur to get together). Zaphod fanatics (I knew some in H.S. but never was one myself) might be disappointed with the new performer due to their love of the character as brought to life by the same actor in both radio and TV versions, but I never thought much of his line deliveries or his take on the character and found this new Zaphod to be fantastic. And Slartibartfast (yep, I spelled that without having to check the book!) never came to life as he did in this film with Bill Nighy in the role. So, considering the near-perfect casting, this film should have been much better, if only they trimmed out the unnecessary dialogue that leads to jokes that aren't delivered, or...turned this into a miniseries where they could add back all the missing punchlines. Or recast the role of Ford Prefect!",3,Where are the punch lines?!?,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,3901,"['have', 'loved', 'story', 'ever', 'radio', 'show', 'came', 'books', 'was', 'brought', 'American', 'airwaves', 'courtesy', 'NPR', 'Playhouse', 'love', 'books', 'well', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'British', 'TV', 'show', 'know', 'lines', 'backward', 'forward', 'inside', 'one', 'thought', 'kept', 'popping', 'up', 'mind', 'watched', 'new', 'film', 'was', 'Where', 'are', 'punchlines', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'now-classic', 'jokes', 'will', 'hear', 'characters', 'setting', 'up', 'punch', 'line', 'then', 'stopping', 'gag', 'delivered', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'pointed', 'out', 'story', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'concise', 'storyline', 'film', 'so', 'filmmakers', 'tried', 'trim', 'down', 'dialogue', 'concentrate', 'more', 'plot', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'story', 'success', 'begin', 'was', 'hilarious', 'diaolgue', 'exchanged', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'funny', 'lines', 'survived', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'radio', 'books', 'TV', 'now', 'Plot', 'what', 'was', 'came', 'second', 'could', 'be', 'abandoned', 'anytime', 'Adams', 'came', 'up', 'funny', 'new', 'direction', 'take', 'characters', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'making', 'wacky', 'space', 'film', 'instead', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'what', 'original', 'dialogue', 'kept', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'written', 'entirely', 'new', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'more', 'coherently', 'new', 'bits', 'made', 'up', 'film', 'were', 'clever', 'enough', 'believe', 'even', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'franchise', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'enjoy', 'think', 'liked', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'DVD', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'theaters', 'were', 'even', 'things', 'applaud', 'Take', 'cast', 'instance', 'actor', 'choices', 'were', 'absolutely', 'inspired', 'others', 'were', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Mos', 'Def', 'mumbling', 'lines', 'attempt', 'alien', 'accent', 'comedic', 'timing', 'whatsoever', 'ruined', 'favorite', 'character', 'Ford', 'Prefect', 'was', 'never', 'crazy', 'actor', 'TV', 'show', 'preferring', 'original', 'radio', 'performer', 'now', 'think', 'comic', 'genius', 'compared', 'film', 'actor', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'who', 'played', 'radio', 'TV', 'versions', 'such', 'way', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'replaced', 'fact', 'recall', 'hearing', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'mind', 'Having', 'said', 'am', 'glad', 'new', 'Arthur', 'nothing', 'old', 'one', 'case', 'attempt', 'recreating', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'impersonation', 'not', 'performance', 'wise', 'got', 'someone', 'entirely', 'different', 'film', 'make', 'role', 'own', 'had', 'thought', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'voice', 'Marvin', 'Paranoid', 'Android', 'line', 'readings', 'were', 'so', 'pale', 'compared', 'original', 'voice', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'Now', 'great', 'choices', 'Zooey', 'made', 'fantastic', 'adorable', 'Trillian', 'taking', 'character', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'originally', 'big', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'always', 'Zaphod', 'somewhere', 'hardly', 'Arthur', 'making', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'part', 'wise', 'choice', 'filmmakers', 'part', 'think', 'lot', 'fans', 'always', 'wanted', 'Arthur', 'get', 'together', 'Zaphod', 'fanatics', 'knew', 'H.S', 'never', 'was', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'new', 'performer', 'due', 'love', 'character', 'brought', 'life', 'same', 'actor', 'radio', 'TV', 'versions', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'line', 'deliveries', 'take', 'character', 'found', 'new', 'Zaphod', 'be', 'fantastic', 'Slartibartfast', 'yep', 'spelled', 'having', 'check', 'book', 'never', 'came', 'life', 'did', 'film', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'role', 'So', 'considering', 'near-perfect', 'casting', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'trimmed', 'out', 'unnecessary', 'dialogue', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'delivered', 'turned', 'miniseries', 'where', 'could', 'add', 'back', 'missing', 'punchlines', 'recast', 'role', 'Ford', 'Prefect']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

Even the masterpiece Lord of the Rings film trilogy left out a lot of the magic of the books. Hitchhiker is no different. It's a film based after a true classic in literature. It is funny and has a lot of interesting moments, along with amazing special effects and intriging characters. This movie doesn't meet standards, though.

Both ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" & ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" were outstanding books. Unfortunately, books do not always translate well to the screen. A great case in point is this film.Let's start with the good things about this movie. Great special effects, the characters were well played by the actors, and the movie tried to stay, at least somewhat, true to the book. One of Adams' best creations is Marvin, the manic-depressant robot and he truly comes to life on the screen. Great adaptation. One other nice thing about this movie: No ""potty-mouth"" humor. Adams never resorted to it and it was great to see the film makers stayed true to that concept.What makes this movie mediocre is, again, the humor just doesn't come across as well on film as it does on the page. Possibly knowing what is coming prevented me from truly enjoying the one-liners and off-beat comedy but I went with someone who did not read the books and they had the same reaction as I did. There were many chuckles but very few belly-laughs. I think the main problem for the ""non-reader"" viewer is that there is too much thrown at them. You're spending so much time trying to figure out what's happening that you miss much of the subtle dry-wit that is Douglas Adams.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. I would recommend it for someone looking for a film to just relax and get taken away for a couple of hours.

Apparently, dolphins have been trying to tell us of our planet's impending doom (to make way for a galactic highway, no less!), but we've always mistaken those cute flips and noises they make as playfulness, rather than the important message that it actually is. Before Earth is blown up, the dolphins give us one last message -- ""So long and thanks for all the fish."" Then they fly away. That's right. They fly. Sure, it's bizarre, but it's downright hilarious and totally worth the bucks to see. And fans of the book -- you won't be disappointed -- and if you are, keep in mind that Adams had a hand in writing this before he died.The story is about a bumbling Brit named Arthur Dent (played by Martin Freeman, who should've been given first billing!). He wakes up to a wrecking crew outside of his home -- they want to tear it down to make way for, what else, a highway. Arthur refuses to leave, laying down in front of a bulldozer. Along comes towel carrying friend Ford Prefect, who wisks Arthur off to a bar to tell him that the planet is about to be destroyed. Arthur laughs it off, until it actually happens. The two hitch a ride with some nasty, poetry reading creatures, who kick them out into deep space. Luckily, they're picked up by President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and his girfriend, Trillian. Joining Zaphod and Trillian is a depressed robot named Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman). Apparently, Zaphod has stolen an important ship and is making his way to a legendary planet called Magarathea. The adventure gets even wackier and even more funny. Check it out to find out what happens!!Martin Freeman is awesome -- he's apparently much more famous in the U.K. than he is in the States, but I'm sure that we'll be seeing much more of his talent over here. Mos Def is funny, somewhat awkward, but funny. And Sam Rockwell as the President of the Galaxy? A perfect fit for Rockwell!

Yet, that is the only explanation of the negative reviews complaining about such superificial matters as Marvin's shape and the configuration of Zaphod's heads.The Hitchhiker's Guide movie may not be faithful to the letter of the book, but it is faithful to its spirit.  In fact, this excellent film rendition retains the strengths of the book--Adam's witty dialogue and the wild sci-fi premise foremost--and improves on its weaknesses.  For instance, the sort of triangle between Arthur, Trillian, and Zaphod adds a much-needed plot-thread running through the story.  And it is far from a conventional ""Hollywood"" romance, as some reviewers have complained.  Rather, Trillian's initial ignorance of the Earth's destruction, and then of Zaphod's hand in it, adds an element of conflict, tension, and drama that helps move the story along.  And though some things have been added that weren't in the book, they are certainly in its spirit--take for instance their trip to Vogsphere to rescue Trillian from being fed to the bug-bladder beast of Krall (or whatever it's called), which hilariously explains why Vogons evolved the way they did, both physically and mentally.The cast is great, the effects are fine, the song at the beginning is fun.

Some of this has to do with being perhaps a bit to reverent towards that material, as if supposing Adams had his eye on some kind of wonky grand design instead of just applying his keen comic mind to a zero-budget radio program. Many of the classic lines aren't delivered with the throwaway snap required, while Alan Rickman sometimes overdoes the pathos of Marvin, rendering him not nearly as deliberately irritating as he needs to be. And while I give kudos to Sam Rockwell for conveying Zaphod Beeblebrox's self-centered lunacy, where's Zaphod's most distinctive characteristic, his towering arrogance? There's barely a trace of it to be found, and that's a singular lack for which the film does nothing to compensate.On the other hand, the Vogons have an execrable charm, Martin Freeman delivers a creditable Arthur Dent, Zooey Deschanel is completely inappropriate for Trillian but very appropriate as a love interest for Arthur, Mos Def is okay as Ford, and Bill Nighy might well have been invented for the sole purpose of playing Slartibartfast.

So it is that the movie version of that most wholly remarkable book again strays from the well-trodden space lanes into wild and woolly backwaters and some of the strangest Hitchhikers' adventures yet.For the uninitiated, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" tells the story of what happens after the Earth is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass (because you've got to build bypasses), including discovering what the whole point of the Earth was to begin with. It helps that one of Arthur Dent's good friends was an alien researcher for the interstellar travel book and general encyclopedia, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and not from Guilford after all. They're picked up by the president of the galaxy, who is tooling around the galaxy in a stolen spaceship and, incidentally, has picked up a girl that Arthur really liked, but totally failed to pick up at a party back in England.For those familiar with the other iterations of the story, the familiar beats are (mostly) here: The Vogon Constructor Fleet darkening the skies above the Earth, Vogon poetry, the Babel fish, Marvin the Paranoid Android, the short unhappy life of a sperm whale, Deep Thought, the fjord-designing Slartibartfast and a Guide full of dubious wisdom.What's really interesting for long-term fans (and what are arguably the most successful parts of the film) are all the new bits: See! The Vogon homeworld, Vogsphere! Meet! The candidate Zaphod Beeblebrox beat out for the presidency! Marvel! At the gun designed by Deep Thought! Get Slapped! By a hilarious security system-cum-behavioral management system!Although the film isn't perfect -- it would probably be hard to please everyone with this film, frankly -- the script is strong, the effects top notch (although it's a little frustrating that filmmakers avoided most of the technical challenges presented by Zaphod's alien physiology), the actors acquit themselves well (Sam Rockwell as Zaphod is so good, you want to strangle him with your bare hands) and overall, it's a great deal of fun, if not the home run that long-time fans hoped it might be. (But then, it's also not the disaster it could have been, which was a strong, strong possibility.)Recommended for fans of Monty Python, Terry Gilliam and, of course, Hitchhiker fans of all shapes and sizes. The film version of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" strikes out for new directions in the best tradition of the story, and is a great tribute to the spirit and sensibility of the late, great Douglas Adams.

Moreover, Trillian is a good shot with the Intent gun.This movie is a lot of fun and pretty much follows the story by Douglas Adams, who just happened to also write the screenplay.  A few technology and technical adjustments were made due to this being a new era and a different medium. One example is changing the digital watch for an up-to-date cell phone.

I mean, improbable luck4.) Meeting ""the one,"" the person with whom you want to spend your life.Lets examine each one from the perspective of this movie:1.) Low expectations - I think this is why I liked ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)"" so much more than most other people. I'd never read any of the books, heard the radio show, or even realized Doug Adams had such an influence on British comedy.  Without this prior knowledge, my expecations were low, so they were entirely satisfied by the film, which I thought was fun, witty, thought-provoking, odd, and even cute.  I had no problem with the emphasis here, the lack of emphasis there, the romance, the brevity, the sets, special effects, etc., that bothered everyone else.  I thoroughly enjoyed it all.2.) Great sense of humor - if you can laugh at losing your house and your planet, then life can't be that bad.  This film laughs at everything.  I loved its attitude.In fact, to be serious just for a moment; good humor usually has some component of truth.  Most of us wonder about the meaning of our lives, and we are fearful of death.  In the middle of all this crazy british humor, I heard a powerful message about individualty, taking chances, opening your heart, and finding the beauty and humor that exists right in front of us, within arms reach, even as we fly around the galaxy.As a long time fan of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" for which Doug Adams did some writing, and of ""Trigger Happy TV,"" perhaps I'm pre-qualified toward this kind of silliness.  I can't get enough.3.) Improbable luck -  Well, we all know this really is the answer to life.  All we need is a little luck..., I mean, alot..., well actually, all we need is a miracle to happen every few minutes, and life will be lovely.4.)  Meeting the ""one.""  I thought the romance in this film, although not approved by Adamns loyalists, was subtle, humorous, and very nicely done.  The scene near the end, when Trillian shoots the President several times with the Point of View Gun, was the highlight of the screenplay, in my humble opinion.  Zooey, a natural 'Cute-osaurus,"" was perfect for the role.  Also, I liked how the main character evolved from his hum-drum view of adventure at the begining of the movie, to his excitement about leaving earth at the end.Am I any closer to understanding the answer to life?

again, much less irritating than the miniseries version of the character, with her grating american accent and curly blonde hair (adams does specify in his book that trillian is a brunette). the only main character i found somewhat disappointing was mos def as ford prefect. it's not that def doesn't turn in a good performance; instead, i feel as if no one really has a firm grasp on the character, with the possible inclusion of douglas adams himself. all in all, though, the movie boasts an excellent cast.i was actually kind of glad that the movie doesn't strive too hard to exactly reproduce the novel. that would be impossible, anyway. most of the plot elements are there, and there are lots of little tidbits that can be appreciated by the obsessive douglas adams fan, including the appearance of arthur dent and marvin from the bbc miniseries. naturally, the effects and production values are much better than those of the miniseries, which gives the viewer a glimpse of the wide scope of adams' universe. admittedly, the slickness and shininess of this version isn't quite as charming as the miniseries, with its obvious sound stage sets and horrid special effects. there's something endearing about how crappy the bbc can be.so, it's not a perfect reproduction. if you're a real stickler for accuracy, don't watch it. also, if you've never read any of the hitchhiker's guide series, don't bother. most of the appeal of this movie will be lost on you. while it's entertaining on its own, i feel like most of the enjoyment i got out of watching it was seeing my favorite characters in the flesh (again) and hearing all the familiar little jokes, etc. all in all, it's a fine supplement to the already existing hitchhiker's guide ""canon"".",4,"well, that about wraps it up for god",1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,2407,"['movie', 'been', 'surrounded', 'fairly', 'equal', 'amounts', 'hype', 'controversy', 'diehard', 'fan', 'adams', 'series', 'novels', 'i', 'naturally', 'went', 'rented', 'old', 'bbc', 'miniseries', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'i', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'i', 'had', 'see', 'it.martin', 'freeman', 'former', 'star', 'great', 'bbc', 'series', 'office', 'perfect', 'arthur', 'dent', 'awkward', 'bumbling', 'charming', 'british', 'way', 'bit', 'everyman', 'sam', 'rockwell', 'funny', 'engaging', 'zaphod', 'beeblebrox', 'still', 'arrogant', 'irritating', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'punch', 'up', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'i', 'did', 'beeblebrox', 'miniseries', 'zooey', 'deschanel', 'good', 'choice', 'trillian', 'again', 'much', 'less', 'irritating', 'miniseries', 'version', 'character', 'grating', 'american', 'accent', 'curly', 'blonde', 'hair', 'adams', 'specify', 'book', 'trillian', 'brunette', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'i', 'found', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'was', 'mos', 'def', 'ford', 'prefect', 'not', 'def', ""n't"", 'turn', 'good', 'performance', 'instead', 'i', 'feel', 'one', 'really', 'firm', 'grasp', 'character', 'possible', 'inclusion', 'douglas', 'adams', 'though', 'movie', 'excellent', 'cast.i', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'glad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'strive', 'too', 'hard', 'exactly', 'reproduce', 'novel', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'anyway', 'most', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'lots', 'little', 'tidbits', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'obsessive', 'douglas', 'fan', 'including', 'appearance', 'arthur', 'dent', 'marvin', 'bbc', 'miniseries', 'naturally', 'effects', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'miniseries', 'viewer', 'glimpse', 'wide', 'scope', 'adams', 'universe', 'admittedly', 'slickness', 'shininess', 'version', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'charming', 'miniseries', 'obvious', 'sound', 'stage', 'sets', 'horrid', 'special', 'effects', 'something', 'endearing', 'how', 'crappy', 'bbc', 'can', 'be.so', 'not', 'perfect', 'reproduction', ""'re"", 'real', 'stickler', 'accuracy', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'also', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'hitchhiker', 'guide', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'most', 'appeal', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'entertaining', 'own', 'i', 'feel', 'most', 'enjoyment', 'i', 'got', 'watching', 'was', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'characters', 'flesh', 'again', 'hearing', 'familiar', 'little', 'jokes', 'etc', 'fine', 'supplement', 'already', 'existing', 'hitchhiker', 'guide', 'canon']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

638681,A26PAN8REXYBYH,B00005JO28,"Brian M. Ranzoni ""Da Killa B""","[9, 13]","It sometimes surprises me people don't believe in evolution. The forces of natural and artificial selection affect stories all the time. After all, no story can be retold without something changing somewhere.And just because one person doesn't find new information beneficial, doesn't mean another person won't find it either. I first encountered the famous *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* as an Infocom text-based adventure game. My father then introduced me to the first of ultimately five novels in the ""trilogy"". Through these I learned the books derived from a BBC radio series. And at long last I bought the BBC television series on VHS and DVD.It's a good thing then Douglas Adams' beloved series reproduces in so many ways. The latest offspring is the long-gestated feature film from Disney affiliate Touchstone. While director Garth Jenning's version of the first novel differs wildly from its source, the film boasts its own value.That said, I don't like the movie very much.I spoke of evolution, but the film is not an adaptation so much as a Dr. Frankenstein's creation. The filmmakers unearthed only ragged pieces of the books and the mini-series. They stitched it together with a completely different and sadly clich&eacute;d plot. The resulting monster is given life by spectacular creature effects and CGI, light-years ahead of the BBC in 1982. But that doesn't mean I want to give it a hug.I certainly don't want to hug the Vogons. Yet it's been a long time since I've seen a film with such appealing production values. Created by the Jim Henson Creature Shop, the Vogons are a cross between those creepy beetle things from *The Dark Crystal* and the Mangalore warrior aliens from *The Fifth Element*. Indeed, the puppets provide a sense of texture impossible to achieve with CGI, and however unhuggable, I'd rather be around these aliens than Jar-Jar Binks. The Vogon environment too, draws loving inspiration from Terry Gilliam's 1984 film *Brazil*. Just check out the similarities between Gilliam's Monolith City and the Vogon city of skyscraper spaceships. The extent to which the film harps upon Vogon bureaucracy also echoes Gilliam's vision of a paperwork tyranny.Expanded examination of these galactic bureaucrats almost redeemed this film for me. Adams never delved much into these creatures in the books, as the Vogons were mostly pawns in one of a series of intergalactic conspiracies which loosely connects the trilogy. But this conspiracy is among many other things ultimately lost in the translation from books to film. It omits all of the puzzle-plots begun in the first book, consequently deleting most of the story, deleting most of the classic scenes, and deleting most of the intelligence. The filmmakers further omit most of Adams' social satire and characterizations. They reduce entire conversations and social observations into one-liners.What material remains lack their original context. Once funny jokes thus misfire. And funny scenes which also advanced the original story simply dangle as loose threads in this movie. The remaining plot is dumbed down into the usual Hollywood romantic subplot and happy ending, being completely out of step with the rest of the Hitchhiker universe.So are the characterizations. Jenning's *HGG* depicts Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and Zaphod Beeblebrox as much more stupid and cowardly than their earlier counterparts. Many of the characters are played for clich&eacute;d and unfunny slapstick. All characters are about as one dimensional as a cardboard caricature can get.Speaking of cardboard, what was up with those paper-cutout computer graphics for the Hitchhiker's Book? This film boasts some of the best CGI I've seen, but when it comes to computer screens it becomes *South Park*! I actually found the color contrasts of these Book scenes unpleasant on my eyes, as the constant yellow and pink themes clash.Getting back to some positives, I think the rest of the CGI effects are some of best because they look more realistic than in most films. CGI tends to have a noticeable shimmer, not to mention a noticeable lack of depth against real objects. And CGI of living matter always looks fake. This happens here as well, but the computer generated images of non-living objects in *HGG* moves as if affected by physics. The scene with Zaphod using his third arm to drop ice-cubes exemplifies: his arm moves more like a tentacle than an arm, and looks too fuzzy, but the ice cubes clink and roll around like they have mass. And in the all-generated shots the textures look pretty realistic and reflect light well.Otherwise, it just makes me sad to think somebody could completely desiccate something I care about and then stuff it with fluff. Movie fans might say I'm just fashionably turning my nose up at entertainment, but I seriously don't find Hollywood clich&eacute;s and poorly developed characters entertaining. It's not snobbish to feel burned out on the same dumb slapstick that comes out year after year. Nor is it petulant to expect a comedy to have real wit and an engaging plot.A movie also doesn't have to be faithful to the letter or the spirit of a book to be good, but I wonder why this production turned out so badly in my eyes. The producers admit they brought on a second screenwriter to make the script more ""coherent"", and Karey Kirkpatrick's ""improvements"" might explain all the clumsy Hollywood clich&eacute;s that are so unlike the stories I experienced as a kid.Still, I always felt by the time *Mostly Harmless* (1992) came out, Douglas Adams was getting a bit sick of his own creation. There's an almost apocalyptic relief to this fifth and final novel, a quality reinforced by the book's ending. He never wrote in the Hitchhiker's world again; he outsourced the *Starship Titanic* (1997) to Terry Jones rather than write it himself. If this film really follows Adams' last complete draft, then it represents a fresh breath of life into something he might have become rather bored with.But that's a fate reserved for creators. For fans, we can enjoy our pet variations to the end. If you saw the movie but have yet to read the books, take this as a warning: the trilogy is completely different from what you enjoyed on the screen. The same goes for those who read the book but have yet to see the film. Personally, I weaned myself on the books and the mini-series, and so I admit the movie is just too different and too poorly executed in the comedy to readily appeal to me.In the end it may appeal to you. And so it is one more variant which may be fit to thrive in Western pop culture environment. In the survival of the fittest stories, every mutation counts.* For effects.* For effort.DVD Notes:The deleted scenes are pretty bad and pretty brief. Not worth showing. However, the ""Fake Deleted Scenes"" are amusing spoofs of the filmmaking process. The Additional Guide Entry involves the hilarious Babel Fish Denies the Existence of God gag from the first book, but mysteriously cuts out the punchline of the whole joke. That's the nature of the whole movie of course--gutting the best jokes and rendering them limp nonsense.",2,Apocryphal Guide to the Galaxy.,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,7142,"['people', 'do',

This movie tried so hard to be liked, like a puppy prancing around frantically licking everyone in sight. Yet for all its sincerity and studied silliness, the end result left me feeling distanced from the source material, which never felt as self conscious as this labored effort.That being said, it looked great. But that wasn't enough to offset this well intentioned but ragged script, which I am certain that involved as he was, Adams would've adjusted as the dailies rolled in. That is, if he had lived long enough to see it through.I'm giving it three stars for good intentions and for moments of greatness. But I still think that primitive as it was technically, the BBS production came closer to the spirit of the books and on the whole was a more satisfying Hitchhiker's experience.Since the above review, I have viewed this film for a second time and had a much more favorable impression. Actually, it was really quite good, all in all.  This was a difficult undertaking, as the book was episodic and really didn't have a coherent plot. The writers (including Adams) were obviously trying to make it more cinematic by attempting to give it a story arc that wasn't even in the source material. The end result really is quite satisfying as long as one tries not to compare it to the other mediums it has appeared in.Still, rather than the unequivocally enjoyable Hitchiker's Guide I was longing for,  the best I can muster beyond the occasional moments of brilliance of which there are many) is that it's ""mostly harmless"".",3,Wanted to like it but...,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,1585,"['loved', 'books', 'kid', 'enjoyed', 'BBC', 'series', 'movie', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'liked', 'puppy', 'prancing', 'frantically', 'licking', 'everyone', 'sight', 'sincerity', 'studied', 'silliness', 'end', 'result', 'left', 'feeling', 'distanced', 'source', 'material', 'never', 'felt', 'self', 'conscious', 'labored', 'being', 'said', 'looked', 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'offset', 'well', 'intentioned', 'ragged', 'script', 'am', 'certain', 'involved', 'was', 'Adams', 'would', ""'ve"", 'adjusted', 'dailies', 'rolled', 'had', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'through.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'good', 'intentions', 'moments', 'greatness', 'still', 'think', 'that', 'primitive', 'was', 'technically', 'BBS', 'production', 'came', 'closer', 'spirit', 'books', 'whole', 'was', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Hitchhiker', 'experience.Since', 'above', 'review', 'have', 'viewed', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'favorable', 'impression', 'Actually', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'difficult', 'undertaking', 'book', 'was', 'episodic', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'coherent', 'plot', 'writers', 'including', 'Adams', 'were', 'obviously', 'trying', 'make', 'more', 'cinematic', 'attempting', 'give', 'story', 'arc', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'source', 'material', 'end', 'result', 'really', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'not', 'compare', 'other', 'mediums', 'appeared', 'in.Still', 'rather', 'unequivocally', 'enjoyable', 'Hitchiker', 'Guide', 'was', 'longing', 'best', 'can', 'muster', 'occasional', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'are', 'many', 'mostly', 'harmless']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

It definitely won't appeal to everyone, though.  If you want to make sense of things, you're not going to enjoy it much.  You just have to stop figuring out everything and simply watch it...which is pretty much the ideal strategy to reading the books.Obviously, the moviemakers made changes to the plot and expanded on the characters so it would appeal more to wide audiences.  I can totally understand this.  Let's face it; the book didn't have a distinct plot, which would be a turn-off for moviegoers who didn't read the books.  Those who are fans of the books, however, may be annoyed at the changes.The characters were also expanded on.  I thought it was a nice touch, but die-hard fans probably won't like it.It was an entertaining film.

It begins with British everyman Arthur Dent finding out his best friend, Ford Prefect, is not a struggling actor, but an alien working for an galactic travel guide. Ford saves Arthur as the Earth is about to be blown up to make way for an Intergalactic expressway. From here the movie jumps from one alien world to another with the Guide explaining things along the way.There is a lot going on in the movie because of the different aliens and their worlds but its not difficult to follow.

638715,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005JO28,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy is one of those films that seems a lot better if one has not read the source material it's based upon- in this case the series of Hitchhiker books by Douglas Adams, the BBC radio shows, or the 1970s BBC television series of the same name. This was manifest immediately to me, as one who'd seen the repeats of the tv show on PBS, but never read the books. In just briefly skimming the online critical consensus this seems confirmed, for rarely does a film elicit such widely divergent reactions. Those critics who came to this film fresh invariably thought it was very good, while those with prior Hitchhiker bonafides thought this new version, by first time director Garth Jennings, who made his name in music videos, was horrible. Oddly, even though I fall into the latter camp, I thought it was a mildly amusing film, in the tradition of Mel Brooks' Spaceballs, and it was scripted by Karey Kirkpatrick, who wrote the delightful claymation comedy Chicken Run, with help from Adams, before he died in 2000. This enjoyment I felt may have been due to the fact that although I enjoyed the old BBC series it's been at least twenty years since I saw the show.The problem with the film is not really the film's problem, but that the books have such a devoted cult following that even the slightest deviations from the canon seem to be taken personally by fans and critics alike, even though all basic tales must adapt to whatever medium they are in. As long as they capture the essence of the work, that's all that is required. And the essence is a work of humor somewhere between Jonathan Swift and Kurt Vonnegut.... Overall, even if one is not too thrilled with the film, the DVD extras make the effort a little more worthwhile. This zeitgeist may explain the many cameos in the film, by the likes of Jason Schwartzman and John Malkovich, although they are really given nothing to work with. Yet, Slartibartfast's philosophy, `I'd rather be happy than right,' is the sort that, if applied to the film's many disappointed cultist detractors, is hard not to find some resonance with, even if, like him, real happiness has not been reached.

638717,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,B00005JO28,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[9, 16]","Having first caught hold of ""Hitchhiker"" as a short TV series on PBS in the late 1970's, I have a warm place in my heart for this kind of ""dry humor"".  ""Dry humor"" may be the last way most would try to describe Douglas Adams writing; but it is done by maintaining a completely serious (shall we say ""museum guide"") demeanor while speaking narratives peppered with absurdities.  Say what you will, it takes considerable discipline and practice to be able to deliver this kind of humor with such consistently pleasing effect.  Douglas Adams was a master.But does it translate visually?  Here is the rub.  I can't imagine what a neophyte seeing all this for the first time must make of all this.  Surprises come from every direction.  Juxtapositions and whimsical images pop out for a few moments and then disappear.  There is little in the way of character development and the viewer is likely to wonder at any given point ""just what is going on?"" and ""how did all that when on before get us here?""For the interested, the answer to these questions rests in repeated viewings-which is why God gave us DVD's.  Therein lies the joke.One of the central keys to understanding ""Hitchhiker"" is that Douglas Adams was an atheist-a rather unusual one at that.  He told a story of his life that he had been a committed Christian throughout his teenage years until one afternoon he passed by a street preacher.  Dutifully, he paused and listened whereupon it struck he that the man was talking complete nonsense.  He abandoned all faith that day.There are many things even a causal listener would like to know more about this story than Adams had offered; but Adams himself died during the making of this movie so we pretty much either have to take his word for it or chalk it up to being one of those skeptic's ""just-so"" stories.  I suppose one could have something like a ""Damascus experience"" into atheism; but the problem with Adam's story is that there are many varieties of Christianity and Christians are more or less used to hearing brothers and sisters from other Christian discipleships blather utter rubbish.  ""Committed"" Christians have more resilience than the story betrays.  Therefore, on its face, Adam's story lacks a credibility which is why I tend to believe it was a joke Adams told for his own amusement if for no one else.But the genius of Adams humor was this:  he realized that the common atheist's role of being the ""party pooper"" at the village metaphysical ice cream social had gotten a bit old and stale.  Also the atheists' continual self-congratulation on their own superior logic and intellect (especially when such a ""fact"" wasn't all that obvious) wasn't winning them any friends.  Worse, the hot babes took no notice of them.  So Adams took a new tack:  tell better jokes.In a sense, Adams was a bit of a cheat.  It helped a great deal if you were somewhat familiar with Western Philosophy and Christian apologetic theology to make some of this humor.  The trick was to think in the outrageous and the fantastic.  Thus all the while subtly suggesting that the universe is a cold and uncaring place without regard for the human race (no benevolent loving God), concede that ""yes, indeed, there are signs of `intelligent design' in the very makeup of earth and the surrounding solar system"".  But instead of concluding the presence of a supernatural being, wouldn't it make just a much sense to propose that an intergalactic architectural firm drew it up and then built it?  Instead of supposing the earth's end by a vengeful God intent on pouring rain upon the just and the unjust, why not propose that the world's last night shall be followed by demolition by the Interstellar Department of Works to make way for the next space super highway?  The rules of the ""game"" are that for whatever supernatural ""fantastic"" explanation or account the theists offer simply offer a more prosaic one raised to absurd heights.As simple as this may sound, the application is quite delicious and entertaining.  The more it is done the better it gets.  Even committed theists could laugh along with you as you poke fun at all the painful stuff you had to suffer through in school.  But in the end, the truth will out.  Adams could not help but make three bows to the atheist's credo in which the gloves finally come off.The first involves what is intended to be a humorous conversation with Slartibartfast.  Up on this point our characters of the Hitchhiker's Guide have been blasting hinter and yon across the universe looking for the ultimate question of existence.  But Slartibartfast toward to end tells Arthur Dent that as time passes one learns it is pointless to quest after the ultimate meaning of things.  Instead, it is better to enjoy life as it is lived before you.  ""I'd much rather be happy than right any day.""  This is actually the germ of the idea behind several different philosophies-and, by the reckoning of some, the essential insight of Buddhism.  Then Adams goes in for the kill.  Arthur Dent asks Slartibartfast if he is in fact happy.  Slartibartfast admits, ""No.  That's where it falls down, of course.""  Adams will settle for no comfort as he must insist that ""it"" is all meaningless and the universe is a cold and hostile place to any of man's pretensions.  There is no justice in life and even ""acceptance"" of that fact will not bring one measure of harmony.Having said this, Adams then goes on to insist on the essential dignity of himself as a free moral agent.  Interestingly enough, if you fully believed in the meaninglessness of life then this assertion makes no sense.  Seen in another way, however, it is actually an argument with God on one level and an argument against the possibility of God on another.  As Arthur finds himself back on a prefabricated earth, it suddenly is revealed to him that the most intellect species on the planet is not man nor dolphins but mice.  All the while we thought we were experimenting with them mice in fact had been experimenting with us-running us through the mazes so to speak.  As the mice trap Arthur and bind him to perform a dissection of his brain, Arthur grabs a pan and smashes the mice flat.  This is all ironic good fun but it betrays fundamental wellspring in much of atheistic thought.  It has been put in several ways but the best I think summed up this way:  ""I prefer not to think that this life is just some sort of grand `quiz' I am taking before I get to the real thing.""  The atheist objects to God putting him through such a savage obstictal course just to see if he is worthy of the Almighty's love and grace.  Man is a free being who aught to be treated as such and not as fodder for some supernatural experiment.  In doing so, the atheist is jabbing his finger precisely in the open wound of many believers' testimonies.  Many if not most theists do in fact talk as if life is just one big ""trick question"" in which your ""answer"" determines your eternal fate.  To most atheists, this is the ultimate proof that God does not exist.  He replies that no good, just and loving God would foist such a monstrous system on innocent human beings who did not ask to be brought into this world.  All the sufferings, death and bloodshed cannot be justified by any supernatural desire to see how things will turn out.  A single, horrible, sickening death of one small infant is enough to scream against the holiness of any such God.  But hundreds if not thousands of small children die in ghastly ways everyday.  Therefore, God simply can't exist.The third and last bow to the atheist credo comes in the very last scenes of the film.  The earth restored and repopulated as before, Arthur Dent is given a chance to go back to the life he loved and cherished before extraterrestrials trashed things.  Instead, Arthur chooses to leave for good and travel the rest of his days among the stars with the beings who make and break worlds, enjoying incredible freedom and are not restricted by the illusions of primitive and backward earthlings.  In other words, Arthur is refusing to be a ""creature"".  A ""creature"" by definition is dependent on the care, whims and largesse of the ""being"" which made him.  To be a ""creature"" means that you cannot find happiness, meaning and fulfillment in being anything other than what you are made to be.  This is not for Arthur Dent.  As bleak as it may appear that all is meaningless, far better to ride ""chariots"" in the heavens as it once was believed the ancient gods had done.  If there is any nobility to human existence, to be free of illusions and in control of one's destiny surely must qualify.Granted, these three ""bows"" to the creed of godlessness are breathed into Hitchhiker far more subtly than explicated here; but they are present and alluded to time and time again.  It is not in the scope of this review to defend or refute these notions.  Instead, my aim is to tease and flesh them out.  Adams' work is meant ultimately for entertainment-something he succeeded at to everyone's surprise.  Atheists may gain an extra chuckle at the humor largely missed by the theists in audience in the jokes made at the believers' expense.  High-brow theists may defend Hitchhiker in the spirit of post-modernism by declaring that you will get out of it pretty much what you choose to take it as.  But, to paraphrase one English novelist, the real ethic and beliefs of a work of art is not so much those the artist openly declares as those the artist merely assumes.  When picking up a firearm, at some point one should know with what it is loaded.",4,RIDING THE CHARIOTS IN THE HEAVENS,1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,9574,"['Having', 'first', 'caught', 'hold',

The massive budget results in a great looking movie that properly captures the scope and scale of the story. There is extensive use of CGI to recreate intergalactic space travel and the planet showroom inside of Magrathea (some of the film's most arresting visuals), but this is mixed with old school, reliable rubber costumes for creatures like the Vogons that gives them a texture that you just can't get with computers. This movie is light years ahead of the clunky BBC version which resembled a bad-looking episode of Dr. Who.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy may not have done well in North America because it lacked recognizable A-list movie stars (but then again, neither did the original Star Wars) with decidedly British sense of humour. Sadly, it failed to connect on a mass audience level despite a significant marketing push. Regardless, it is still an entertaining, big, splashy science fiction movie that manages to preserve the wit of Adams' book. So long now and thanks for all the fish.""Making of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is a fairly standard making of featurette. Not surprisingly, director Garth Jennings said that the key to this movie was in the casting. So, he gathered an eclectic group of actors.Also included is an ""Additional Guide Entry"" which faithfully recreates the gag from the book about man proving that God doesn't exist but then it fails to include the book's punchline in which man goes on to prove that black is white and gets killed at the next zebra crossing.There are three deleted scenes that amount to merely extra little bits that include Ford's update entry for Earth as ""Mostly harmless.""There are also two ""Really Deleted Scenes"" that are basically goofy outtakes of the cast hamming it up.""Sing Along `So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" allows you to sing with the film's catchy Monty Python-esque theme song cum show tune karoake-style.There is an audio commentary by Jennings, producer Nick Goldsmith and actors Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy. It's a fun, relaxed track as everyone enjoys themselves watching the movie.Fans of the book will enjoy the additional commentary track with executive producer Robbie Stamp and Douglas Adams colleague Sean Solle. They talk about the movie in relation to Adams' original vision and also speak at length about the differences between the film, the video game, the radio play and the book, justifying the reasons for certain changes. Best of all, Stamp points out the little details that are buried throughout the film in this excellent track.There is ""Marvin's Hangman,"" that allows you to play a variation of the hangman word game but with Marvin's robot parts.The extras included on the DVD are done in the style and tone of the movie, including a clever feature known as the ""Improbability Drive"" that will take you to a completely random moment in one of the extras.",4,Surprisingly Good,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,3017,"['Thankfully', 'film', 'quite', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'Adams', 'book', 'example', 'Guide', 'entries', 'are', 'taken', 'verbatim', 'massive', 'budget', 'results', 'great', 'looking', 'movie', 'properly', 'scope', 'scale', 'story', 'extensive', 'use', 'CGI', 'recreate', 'intergalactic', 'space', 'travel', 'planet', 'showroom', 'Magrathea', 'film', 'most', 'arresting', 'visuals', 'mixed', 'old', 'school', 'reliable', 'rubber', 'costumes', 'creatures', 'Vogons', 'texture', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'computers', 'movie', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'clunky', 'BBC', 'version', 'resembled', 'bad-looking', 'episode', 'Dr.', 'Who.The', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'North', 'America', 'lacked', 'recognizable', 'A-list', 'movie', 'stars', 'then', 'again', 'did', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'decidedly', 'British', 'sense', 'humour', 'Sadly', 'failed', 'connect', 'mass', 'audience', 'level', 'significant', 'marketing', 'push', 'Regardless', 'still', 'entertaining', 'big', 'splashy', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'preserve', 'wit', 'Adams', 'book', 'So', 'long', 'now', 'thanks', 'fish', 'Making', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'fairly', 'standard', 'making', 'featurette', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'director', 'Garth', 'Jennings', 'said', 'key', 'movie', 'was', 'casting', 'So', 'gathered', 'eclectic', 'group', 'actors.Also', 'included', 'Additional', 'Guide', 'Entry', 'faithfully', 'gag', 'book', 'man', 'proving', 'God', ""n't"", 'exist', 'then', 'include', 'book', 'punchline', 'man', 'prove', 'black', 'white', 'killed', 'next', 'zebra', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'amount', 'merely', 'extra', 'little', 'bits', 'include', 'Ford', 'update', 'entry', 'Earth', 'Mostly', 'harmless', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'Really', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'are', 'basically', 'goofy', 'outtakes', 'cast', 'hamming', 'up', 'Sing', 'Along', 'So', 'Long', 'Thanks', 'Fish', 'sing', 'film', 'catchy', 'Monty', 'Python-esque', 'theme', 'song', 'cum', 'show', 'tune', 'karoake-style.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Jennings', 'producer', 'Nick', 'Goldsmith', 'actors', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'fun', 'relaxed', 'track', 'everyone', 'watching', 'movie.Fans', 'book', 'will', 'enjoy', 'additional', 'commentary', 'track', 'executive', 'producer', 'Robbie', 'Stamp', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'colleague', 'Sean', 'Solle', 'talk', 'movie', 'relation', 'Adams', 'original', 'vision', 'also', 'speak', 'length', 'differences', 'film', 'video', 'game', 'radio', 'play', 'book', 'justifying', 'reasons', 'certain', 'changes', 'Best', 'Stamp', 'out', 'little', 'details', 'are', 'buried', 'film', 'excellent', 'Marvin', 'Hangman', 'play', 'variation', 'hangman', 'word', 'game', 'Marvin', 'robot', 'parts.The', 'extras', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'done', 'style', 'tone', 'movie', 'including', 'clever', 'feature', 'known', 'Improbability', 'Drive', 'will', 'take', 'completely', 'random', 'moment', 'one', 'extras']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

638722,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005JO28,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[0, 0]","I am writing this as a Hitchhiker's Guide purist, meaning I value the original novel and to some extent, the BBC series, so bear that in mind.  The only visual version of Douglas Adams' cult book, Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, was the six part BBC series back in 1981, which combined elements from HH and its sequel, Restaurant At The End of the Universe.  A bigscreen version was pushed about for years.  By the time it finally came out this month, Adams had passed away from a sudden heart attack aged 49.The story is well known for acolytes of HH and its four sequels.  Basically, on the last day of planet Earth's existence, Arthur Dent has to worry about his house being demolished to make way for a bypass.  This predicament is magnified when alien Vogons, traveling in ships shaped like office blocks, announce that Earth has to be destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass system.  Fortunately, Arthur escapes Earth with his friend Ford Prefect, who was not from Guilford but actually from the planet Betelguese.The title refers to a book Ford carries with him, a small book that has surpassed the Encyclopedia Galactica as the repository of all knowledge, popular from its message, ""Don't Panic"" on its cover.So the difference between the BBC series and the movie?  Where the series omitted many things from the book, it didn't include anything extraneous.  The movie follows the book up to Arthur and Ford being rescued by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the wacky two-headed, three-armed President of the Galaxy, now on the run for having stolen the Heart of Gold starship with the Infinite Improbability Drive, and Trillian, a girl Arthur tried to get lucky with at a party.  After that, the movie introduces characters who didn't appear in the book, such as Humma Kavala, Zaphod's opponent for President of the galaxy.  The series focuses more on the guidebook than the movie, which in the book was a key focus due to the humorous information in its pages.  And the quest for the question of Life, The Universe, and Everything is less thematic in the movie.Simon Bailey is perfectly cast as Arthur, with an over the top Sam Rockwell outdoing Mark Wing-Davy's version.  And wait till you see how he has two heads!  Alan Rickman's droning monotone is perfect as the voice of Marvin, the chronically depressed android.  I was expecting something miscast from rapper Mos Def as Ford, but no, he's actually not that bad, and has an acceptable British accent.  Bill Nighy, who appeared in Love Actually along with Bailey, does well as planetary engineer and fjordphilic Slartibartfast-""I told you my name wasn't important"".  And Stephen Fry is perfect as the narrator.  Note:  in the scene where the gang are at the office trying to secure Trillian's release, the original Marvin from the BBC series can be seen among the gaggle of aliens.Similarities to the BBC series?  Adams' humour works best in print or on radio, as much has to do with absurdities that translates best as abstractions to be contemplated in the mind rather than visuals.  The movie will be best enjoyed by those already familiar with the HH books, although the silliness of portraying the Vogons as officious and bureaucratic does get through.The verdict?  The movie's use of CGI works best in the realization of the Vogon fleet going into hyperspace, or the planet Magrathea, which customizes luxury planets, but that and the new material not in the book are in the end no match for the original book.  In fact, despite some wackiness and good scenes, the new material cheapens the memory of Adams and what HH is all about.

638723,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JO28,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[9, 15]","The filmmaker's reverence for Adams' legacy?  What kind of rubbish statement is that?  As a loyal fan of Douglas Adams for more than a quarter of a century, I was appalled and horrified by this incredibly unfaithful and singularly unfunny adaptation of his masterful work.  Maybe if you've never even heard of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or the ingenious Douglas Adams, you might accidentally enjoy one or two seconds of this putrid cinematic mess (doubtful, but possible), but I don't see how any Adams fan can watch this thing without standing up and shaking his/her fist at the screen and muttering various unmentionable words throughout the entire hour and forty minutes.  I mean, this film is absolutely horrible.  I don't even consider it an actual adaptation of Adams' story because half of this movie is original, badly written material - and the other half is a sloppy mish-mash of Adams' vision.  I had my doubts that I would like this film, which is why I waited so long to watch it, but never did I imagine that I would hate it with every fiber of my being.This feature film never made it to development during Adams' life.  There's a reason for that: Adams wasn't going to let his definitive story be ruined by a bunch of writers who thought they knew more about Adams' vision than he did.  Adams' death allowed these script butchers to go ahead and sacrifice Adams' legacy at the altar of their own profit.  These guys took the funniest novel ever written and transformed it into a film without one remotely funny moment.  They got every character completely wrong.  What's this folderol about Trillian actually falling for Arthur?  And Zaphod's second head (and ridiculously fake third arm) - horrible, horrible, horrible.  And why the heck does Zaphod look like Tom Cruise and talk like Bill Clinton doing an Elvis impersonation?  Ford basically disappears halfway into the film.  And Marvin - I had hopes for Marvin (my favorite character) because Alan Rickman would be supplying the voice - those hopes were dashed to pieces.  Even the Hitchhiker's Guide graphics were abysmal - downright cartoonish, even when compared to the low-budget visuals of the classic BBC Hitchhiker's production (which, by the way, is actually faithful to the story and - more importantly -funny).I could go on forever about how terrible an adaptation of Adams' ingenious work this movie is.  This cinematic travesty will likely drive away a lot of people who will now never go near an actual Douglas Adams novel, as they will likely expect each one of them to contain the same kind of hopeless drivel that is this movie.

I still wanted to see it however, because I had read the books and was interested in seeing what the movie had to offer.  First off, I will give a quick review of the books.  They were nothing like I expected.  I think they caught me off guard with the humor.  I was a little disappointed with what the books had to offer, but they were definitely not bad.  They just weren't what I thought they would be.  I feel like the progression of the plot was unclear and I feel like I would need to re-read the books to totally appreciate them.  Standing alone, I think the new Hitchhiker's Guide movie is pretty bad.  If you haven't read at least the first book, you will probably find the movie stupid.  The humor is off-beat, and one again... unexpected.  However, I really enjoyed watching the movie.  It was almost like I knew a secret that made the movie so much funnier than it actually was.  I had a certain understanding of the characters that wasn't explained at all in the movie.  I think that it is always risky to make a movie out of a book that has been so popular.  The books cause the reader to constantly imagine what this other world is like.  Many movies that slap something on the screen that may or may not be like that mental image ruin the magic of the book.  I think it is always a bad idea to see a movie before you read a book.  I made this mistake with the Lord of The Rings series.  Now, no matter how hard I try I just can't struggle through the books, even though I am sure they are great.

Unfortunately, I can't do that as it would not be accurate.  Sadly, it simply doesn't measure up to Adams' calibre of humor.The single biggest problem with the film is that they cut so much out to shorten it to regular-movie length.  The BBC version of the story is far superior to this movie.  Sure, the FX in this one are worlds better than what BBC had to offer, but the BBC never cared much for FX quality anyway.  The BBC version from the early 80s is much more complete, and that's what is important.  The present DVD has so much chopped out that it ends up being abridged, incomplete and w/out a cohesive storyline.  There were times I felt that the makers just threw in some ""highlights"" of the HHG series at-random, and the result was that the film felt very piecemeal.On the upside, the acting is pretty good, and Zooey Deschanel is certainly eye candy.  The film itself is fairly well done acting & directing wise.  The problem lies much more with the (lack of?) content than anything else.  That's a sad thing, too, as my fear is that people will watch this movie and go away thinking ""This Douglas Adams was not nearly so funny as people made him out to be.""  To judge Adams by this movie is simply not fair.  If you want to become familiar w/Adams, read the books.  Or, see the BBC version of HHG.

638740,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B00005JO28,drqshadow,"[1, 1]","Let's be honest, this is about as close to an unfilmable property as it gets. Between the vast array of budget-busting concepts, characters and settings, the niche-settled sense of humor (granted, it's a rather large niche, but a niche all the same) and Douglas Adams's inimitably flirty, hilarious knack for description, it's a wonder this was even filmed because it seems so perfectly suited to a non-visual medium. But it's a popular title and Hollywood's long since run out of fresh, moneymaking ideas, so after two-plus decades in development hell, somebody finally gave it a green light. And, god bless it, the thing actually performs admirably well in a number of unexpected ways. For starters, the visual design is a raging success; a creative wet dream, it's positively teeming with expertly-realized concepts. The dozens of alien races look magnificent, the competing spacecraft are wildly varied and thoroughly interesting, the guide itself is a note-perfect modernization of an aging concept, and the infamous factory on Magrathea is jaw-droppingly realized. The casting is deeply inspired, too, with Alan Rickman, Martin Freeman and Zooey Deschanel born to play their roles as Marvin, Arthur and Trillian, respectively. The only snag lies in the story, which is half-baked at best, cripplingly over-ambitious at worst and even occasionally, inexcusably, dull. Too often it stretches too thin, striving to please everyone and instead falling universally short. The bare threads of Adams's original storyline are still there, plain as day, and they still work excellently. But they're backseated by far too many indulgent side-treks and wink-nod-grins for anyone's good. It's a commendable effort that does an awful lot right - far more than I was prepared to accept - but can't quite get over the hump into unbridled success.",4,Expertly-Realized Visuals Can't Bail Out a Cloudily Interpreted Storyline,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1837,"['Let', 'be', 'honest', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'unfilmable', 'property', 'vast', 'array', 'budget-busting', 'concepts', 'characters', 'settings', 'niche-settled', 'sense', 'humor', 'granted', 'rather', 'large', 'niche', 'niche', 'same', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'inimitably', 'flirty', 'hilarious', 'knack', 'description', 'wonder', 'was', 'even', 'filmed', 'so', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'non-visual', 'medium', 'popular', 'title', 'Hollywood', 'long', 'run', 'fresh', 'moneymaking', 'ideas', 'so', 'two-plus', 'decades', 'development', 'hell', 'somebody', 'finally', 'gave', 'green', 'light', 'god', 'bless', 'thing', 'actually', 'admirably', 'well', 'number', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'starters', 'visual', 'design', 'raging', 'success', 'creative', 'wet', 'dream', 'positively', 'teeming', 'expertly-realized', 'concepts', 'dozens', 'alien', 'races', 'look', 'magnificent', 'competing', 'spacecraft', 'are', 'wildly', 'varied', 'thoroughly', 'interesting', 'guide', 'note-perfect', 'modernization', 'aging', 'concept', 'infamous', 'factory', 'Magrathea', 'jaw-droppingly', 'realized', 'casting', 'deeply', 'inspired', 'too', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'born', 'play', 'roles', 'Marvin', 'Arthur', 'Trillian', 'respectively', 'only', 'snag', 'story', 'half-baked', 'best', 'cripplingly', 'over-ambitious', 'worst', 'even', 'occasionally', 'inexcusably', 'dull', 'Too', 'often', 'too', 'thin', 'striving', 'please', 'everyone', 'instead', 'falling', 'universally', 'short', 'bare', 'threads', 'Adams', 'original', 'storyline', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'plain', 'day', 'still', 'work', 'excellently', ""'re"", 'backseated', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'indulgent', 'side-treks', 'wink-nod-grins', 'anyone', 'good', 'commendable', 'effort', 'awful', 'lot', 'right', 'far', 'more', 'was', 'prepared', 'accept', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'hump', 'unbridled', 'success']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

638745,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00005JO28,E. David Swan,"[1, 2]","I usually ding movies pretty hard for straying too far from the source material. My feeling is if you don't want to follow the story why bother making an adaptation. However, in the case of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy it's hard to say what the source material is. The legendary book of the same was based on a BBC radio program aired in 1978 and there have been so many adaptations that variances in the story are practically expected. Even the parts of this movie not in any previous version, such as the character of Humma Kavula played by John Malkovich, was actually written by Douglas Adams specifically for a movie adaptation. So I'm giving this film a pass on staying true to the book and I'll simply judge it based on its own merits. Just know that the movie and the book have more than a few plot differences.I watched the film with low expectations given the disappointing response from the public and the opening credits only increased my concern. They ran over some low quality video of dolphins doing tricks at a zoo in Spain while the obnoxious song `So Long and Thanks For All the Fish' played. Luckily the opening was probably the low point of the film. The one continuing annoyance throughout the movie was the incredibly lackluster performance by Mos Def who seemed to be expending as little energy as possible playing Ford Prefect. On the opposite end of the spectrum was Sam Rockwell who was an absolutely inspired choice to play Zaphod Beeblebrox.On the whole I would say that the movie is a fine addition to the Hitchikers multimedia empire that includes books, a movie, TV program, radio programs and even video games. It's neither as bad as many people make it out to be or as good as it could have been. Sometimes the film feels a little cheaply built particularly the opening credits but the Vogon's look excellent, the Heart of Gold is well done (although I always imagined it being much sleeker) and the Magrathea factory floor is positively spectacular. This is one of those movies where it's wise to temper your expectations. The humor is subtle and British rather than laugh out loud as in films like Tropic Thunder and Walk Hard. If you've read the book the jokes will probably make more sense and resonate better but then you might find yourself in the unfortunate position of comparing the movie to the book.It sounds highly unlikely that a sequel will be made which is a shame because despite one very weak performance and some unfortunate stylistic decisions this isn't a bad film. The core story and tone of Douglas Adams's fantastic book is preserved which is the most important thing of all.

638750,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00005JO28,Eric S. Kim,"[2, 3]","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSTITLE: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the GalaxyRELEASE DATE: 2005PLOT: Based on the novel by Douglas Adams: Arthur Dent, an average human being, escapes earth with his good friend Ford Perfect (who is in fact not an earthling) shortly before the entire planet is destroyed to make way for a galactic highway. Later, Arthur meets the Galactic President Zaphod Beetlebrox, his paranoid android Marvin, and his new friend Trillian (who knows Arthur very well). All are in search for the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. But some things go a bit awry when they're on their way to the planet Magrathea.Two new conflicts, which are not originally from the novel, are present in the movie. It is when Zaphod makes an exchange with a brand new character, and when Trillian is kidnapped and sent to Vogsphere. Earth isn't really complete when it comes to the novel, and Trillian and Arthur's romantic interest is something that shouldn't have been introduced. However, I did enjoy the scenes involving the Vogsphere and the POV of the dolphins. 7/10CHARACTERS/PERFORMANCES: Martin Freeman and Zooey Deschanel are fine as Arthur and Trillian, while the voice of Stephen Fry is quite listenable as the Guide. Casting an African-American man to play Ford Perfect instead of a white actor doesn't really bother me that much, but Zaphod's two heads should've been unchanged (two heads next to each other instead of one head over/under the other). Two new characters are introduced: Humma Kavula (played by John Malkovich) and Questular Rontok (played by Anna Chancellor), and they seem to do well in the story. 7/10THE SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: With differences aside, most of the dialogue is quite intelligent and enjoyable to listen to. Although most of the comical jokes, which are famous in the novel, were taken out, I was relieved to see that the towel and the number 42 are still present. 9/10DIRECTOR: Garth Jennings did a fabulous job with the film by making the look and feel of ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" a bit better than the television series. I think I can tell he made sure that all the changes that were made by Adams himself were carefully produced. 9/10PACING: The film is a bit fast paced, and there are never any slow spots. 10/10CINEMATOGRAPHY: It's all good, though some scenes were a bit too light for some odd reason. 9/10SETS AND COSTUMES: The interior settings are obviously futuristic-looking and very stunning, while the exterior settings (which include images of clouds and planets and spacecrafts) are beautiful and can stick to the mind for a long period of time. All the costumes look nice, but boy, it must've been tough for all the actors and actresses to wear the Vogon costumes. 10/10MUSIC: It's all very orchestral and . . . spacey. I like it very much. 10/10VISUAL EFFECTS: Typical computer-animated imagery is used brilliantly here. The reconstruction of planet earth and its surroundings are particularly attention-grabbing, and the planetary settings look very realistic. 10/10DVD SPECIAL FEATURES: The Deleted Scenes are nothing special, but the Really Deleted Scenes are worth watching. The Additional Guide Entry that involves God and his existence is interesting to watch, and the ""Making of"" documentary is a good one, too. Audio commentaries are a must. 9/10CONCLUSION: Despite the many changes with plot and character, this movie version of Adams's Sci-Fi novel is pretty enjoyable to watch for both fans and non-fans alike.OVERALL GRADE: 9/10",5,"""So Long & Thanks For All The Fish!""",1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,3524,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'MAJOR', 'SPOILERSTITLE', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'GalaxyRELEASE', 'DATE', '2005PLOT', 'Based', 'novel', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'average', 'human', 'being', 'escapes', 'earth', 'good', 'friend', 'Ford', 'Perfect', 'who', 'fact', 'not', 'earthling', 'shortly', 'entire', 'planet', 'destroyed', 'make', 'way', 'galactic', 'highway', 'Later', 'Arthur', 'Galactic', 'President', 'Zaphod', 'Beetlebrox', 'paranoid', 'android', 'Marvin', 'new', 'friend', 'Trillian', 'who', 'Arthur', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'search', 'Ultimate', 'Answer', 'Life', 'Universe', 'Everything', 'things', 'go', 'bit', 'awry', 'when', ""'re"", 'way', 'planet', 'Magrathea.Two', 'new', 'conflicts', 'are', 'not', 'originally', 'novel', 'are', 'present', 'movie', 'when', 'Zaphod', 'exchange', 'brand', 'new', 'character', 'when', 'Trillian', 'kidnapped', 'sent', 'Vogsphere', 'Earth', ""n't"", 'really', 'complete', 'when', 'novel', 'Trillian', 'Arthur', 'romantic', 'interest', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'However', 'did', 'enjoy', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Vogsphere', 'POV', 'dolphins', '7/10CHARACTERS/PERFORMANCES', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'are', 'fine', 'Arthur', 'Trillian', 'voice', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'quite', 'listenable', 'Guide', 'Casting', 'African-American', 'man', 'play', 'Ford', 'Perfect', 'instead', 'white', 'actor', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'much', 'Zaphod', 'two', 'heads', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'unchanged', 'two', 'heads', 'other', 'instead', 'one', 'head', 'other', 'Two', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'Humma', 'Kavula', 'played', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Questular', 'Rontok', 'played', 'Anna', 'Chancellor', 'seem', 'do', 'well', 'story', '7/10THE', 'SCRIPT/DIALOGUE', 'differences', 'aside', 'most', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'most', 'comical', 'jokes', 'are', 'famous', 'novel', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'was', 'relieved', 'see', 'towel', 'number', '42', 'are', 'still', 'present', '9/10DIRECTOR', 'Garth', 'Jennings', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'film', 'making', 'look', 'feel', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'bit', 'better', 'television', 'series', 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'made', 'sure', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'Adams', 'were', 'carefully', 'produced', '9/10PACING', 'film', 'bit', 'fast', 'paced', 'are', 'never', 'slow', 'spots', '10/10CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'good', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'light', 'odd', 'reason', '9/10SETS', 'COSTUMES', 'interior', 'settings', 'are', 'obviously', 'futuristic-looking', 'very', 'stunning', 'exterior', 'settings', 'include', 'images', 'clouds', 'planets', 'spacecrafts', 'are', 'beautiful', 'can', 'stick', 'mind', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'costumes', 'look', 'nice', 'boy', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tough', 'actors', 'actresses', 'wear', 'Vogon', 'costumes', '10/10MUSIC', 'very', 'orchestral', 'spacey', 'very', 'much', '10/10VISUAL', 'EFFECTS', 'Typical', 'computer-animated', 'imagery', 'used', 'brilliantly', 'here', 'reconstruction', 'planet', 'earth', 'surroundings', 'are', 'particularly', 'attention-grabbing', 'planetary', 'settings', 'look', 'very', 'realistic', '10/10DVD', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'Really', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'Additional', 'Guide', 'Entry', 'God', 'existence', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Making', 'documentary', 'good', 'one', 'too', 'Audio', 'commentaries', 'are', 'must', '9/10CONCLUSION', 'many', 'changes', 'plot', 'character', 'movie', 'version', 'Adams', 'Sci-Fi', 'novel', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'alike.OVERALL', 'GRADE', '9/10']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

638752,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B00005JO28,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[3, 6]","Every so often, along comes a quirky story that manages to stick around.  Douglas Adam's ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is the quintessential example of such a story.  The original book was written in 1980, and was a phenomenal hit, though more or less on the cult level, as its strange and very British sense of humor can only be really appreciated by those with the taste for it.  It is somehow fitting, though, that Adam's original idea has had a rather unique journey from page to screen.  Unlike most novels, which go immediately from book to film, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide"" has previously been a radio series,  a record album, a TV series, a computer game, a graphic novel, and even a towel.  It has taken 25 years, but the movie adaptation is finally here, ready to dazzle or disappoint its long-patient fans.Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is the atypical everyman who is whisked off the soon-to-be-demolished Earth by his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def), the author of the astonishing Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  The Guide is a repository of all the information about just about anything in the universe.  Kind of like the Internet was supposed to be.Arthur and Ford cross paths with Ford's cousin, the two-headed Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), the President of the Galaxy, who acts much more like an aging hippie than a government official.  Beeblebrox is accompanied by his human girlfriend Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) and Marvin, the manic-depressive robot (performed by Warwick Davis, voiced by Alan Rickman).  The whole bunch are soon off to uncover the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe, and Everything, because we already have the answer:  42.Bizarre, I know.  But it is this charming randomness that makes ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" so much fun to watch.  I quite enjoyed this odd example of English humor, though those who don't have a taste for the British wit may want to skip this one.  It's got a different flavor than Monty Python, but still has that foreign feel all the same.Though the film is not word-for-word faithful to the original novel (a major complaint among the ""Hitchhiker"" purists), the changes and additions are still very much in keeping with Douglas Adam's style, as well they should be; Adams developed all of the original concepts for the film before his death.Having recently read the novel, I was very pleased with the adaptation; it manages to keep the feel and pace of the book, but adds its own spin to things and is unique and special all on its own.Speaking of which, it does help to have read the book first, as this is the kind of film that throws you into a whole new world, and does not slow down to explain everything.  You've got to roll with the punches, as it were, and just try to keep up with the story, rather than get bogged down admiring some incredibly ugly aliens.So stick your thumb to the stars, and enjoy the ride!  We'll see you at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

638753,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B00005JO28,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[8, 15]","It was better the second time. I wasn't really sure about going to see the acclaimed ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" just by the way my friend described the books. It seemed sort of creepy that earth would be blown up to make way for a galatic highway which ends up ablysmally failing, but with the effects we have today, I was anxious just how well they could do a movie that was intended to have plenty of special effects with a budget of $50,000,000. Even the new Star Wars series had an average of $115,000,000, more than double of that. But I went anyway.Seconds before Earth's sudden and inevitable destruction to make way for a new galatic highway, Authur Dent and Ford Prefect survive the blast, and find themselves lost in space with nothing but their towels in their posession. No doubt, Earth's blast was shocking, but Authur knows there has to be something more than just Earth being in the way of a new highway.Meeting up with an old girlfriend who also survived Earth's sad end, Authur is not only forced in taking a ride with his newfound friends into the endless universe with a mere book to guide him, but also finds that Earth's end was not just for the galatic highway (which ended up failing) but for something much more complexed, and he may be the only one to save what is left of Earth, and make sure it's purpose is never discovered. Being sole survivor, it is his choice.Besides straying pretty far away from the book, I found that this version is much funnier than intended. The comedic actions taken during the course of trying to survive the Vogons in space is pretty funny. Not to mention, by trying to understand everything, you are forced to wonder exactly what you watched while trying not to laugh so much so you can concentrate. I had to watch it a second time over, but once I did, everything was suddenly much more clear. It was understandable, and that was good because a movie that needs a lot of explanation isn't good.The plot of the new ""re-thought"" version was actually the screenplay that Douglas Adams himself wrote. It may seem as if they had done a lot of rewriting on purpose, but there wasn't. It was all done by Adams which I was happy to find out because when a movie strays too far away from a book on purpose, it just isn't enjoyable that way either, even if the book is always better than the movie.As for the characters, I was really happy to see they didn't change the character of the manic-deppressive robot Marvin at all. He is perfect, and almost how I pictured him in the book. I pictured him a little smaller, but he's great. I didn't expect Ford to black, but I think he's better that way, more enjoyable, and funnier. Had he been white, I don't think he would've stood out as much. Plus, I think everyone in the book is white, so I think the filmmakers probably wanted to draw the line somewhere considering how long ago the book was written.The effects are awesome! With the ""low-budget"" they had for this kind of movie, they made it Star Wars worthy of effects. Even the effects in this are sometimes better than a lot of higher budget films that take less special effects. Even though they can sometimes get very low (such as the effects of a sperm whale falling from the sky), a lot of the time, it looks really really good, and never fails to amaze you. If you don't like the movie, you can't admit that the effects didn't blow you away, especially of earth being blown up, the Vogon ships flying from hyperspace, the Vogon city, and a scene where the characters come out of hyperspace as a ball of yarn, and everyone has been knitted into yarn characters (which is probably the best CGI). Low-budget CGI will probably never work for another film. It sure didn't work for Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow, and that had a budget of $40,000,000.As for acting, it's awesome. It never really loses your interest on how well the actors play them. Sam Rockwell who plays President Zaphod, is completely awesome and insane! I was also happy that they stayed with the fact that the characters are from England like in the book. Mos Def is incredible as Ford, a sort of difficult role to play. Zooey Deschanel as the innocent Trillian was also very good in being a kind girl gone bad when she finds out Zaphod has blown up the planet (by being stupid).

Expecting the movie to be a 2ish out of 10 was being very hopeful it seems.Everything I expected did come to pass in unusually horrific ways.  Not only was it miscast in a very bad way, it did remind me of remaking 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' with the actors from the 'Bridges of Madison County' movie.The plot was very watered down but it decided to include a bunch of 'hey look at our neat CGI' scenes that were overly long and very uninteresting which took up time that could have been better utilized by including more of the story.

The plot, such as it is, is non-traditional--but more significantly, the brilliance of the novel is not so much what it is about as how it is written.  And that, as screen adaptors of everything from THE GREAT GATSBY to CATCH-22 will tell you, isn't something that translates to film.No, Adam's novel cannot be filmed and it really is as simple as that.  Once you accept this, stop expecting the film to duplicate the novel, and take it for what it is--a riff on Adam's ideas rather than a bona fide adaptation--the 2005 HITCHERHIKER'S GUIDE is really quite a lot of fun.The plot is episodic to the point of interglatic buckshot.  Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is an ordinary Englishman without great aspirations or indeed without an interesting life, at least until the world comes to an end and he finds himself hitching a ride on a space ship for parts unknown courtesy of alien Ford Prefect (Mos Def.)  Along the way there will everything from  bureaucratic and poetry-reading Vogons, the two-faced (literally) president of the galaxy, a depressed robot with a bi-polar disorder, evil preachers from outer space, and, er, mice.The film looks sharp in its mixture of real-time puppets and the inevitable CGI effects, the cast is attractive, and at its best HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE has an almost Monty Python sensiblity.  When it works it all goes like a house afire; when it doesn't it is at least visually entertaining.  Purists will argue almost every aspect of the film, and truly nothing can nor should surplant the novel itself, but taken on its own merits the film is unexpectly amusing.  A great film that will last through ages?  No--but quite a bit a fun just the same.The film transfer is quite nice and the DVD has several nice, if not remarkable, bonuses.

638761,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00005JO28,Gavin Wilson,"[14, 29]","Before I criticise this movie, I should declare myself.  The problem is that I've been intimately familiar with the story since 1978, when copies of copies of copies of tapes of the first radio series were circulating around Cambridge University (Douglas Adams' alma mater, incidentally).  In my view, all three hours' worth of that first BBC series was the 20th century's equivalent of 'Alice in Wonderland'.  It was that magnificent.  So I went to the movie last night, knowing that I felt extremely possessive about it -- if the director had changed one line of dialogue, he had better have a good reason.Unfortunately he had cut out enormous chunks, many of them extremely funny -- such as the philosophers who insist that the computer not be allowed to think about the ultimate answer, and the sensitive cops, and the restaurant at the end of the universe, and the Golgafrincham 'B' Ark.  The end of the movie came as a surprise, as it resembled neither the radio, TV or book plot.  It was as if the producers suddenly ran out of interest or money or both.  They certainly can't be expecting demand for a sequel, based on this effort.  In several scenes, the actors seem less than 100% committed.  Was this another 'Avengers' with unreported disputes among the cast?Apart from the re-working of the Eagles' Hitchhiker theme, the music seems out of place, and serves only to plug the gaps that Adams' wonderful dialogue should have filled.Overall, the movie a disaster.  The only way the Hitchhiker can succeed at the cinema is if someone takes the radio series dialogue unedited and creates an animation around the voices.",2,A missed opportunity -- Douglas wound have hated most of it,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,1627,"['criticise', 'movie', 'should', 'declare', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'been', 'intimately', 'familiar', 'story', '1978', 'when', 'copies', 'copies', 'copies', 'tapes', 'first', 'radio', 'series', 'were', 'circulating', 'around', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'alma', 'mater', 'incidentally', 'view', 'three', 'hours', 'worth', 'first', 'BBC', 'series', 'was', '20th', 'century', 'equivalent', ""'Alice"", 'Wonderland', 'was', 'magnificent', 'went', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'knowing', 'felt', 'extremely', 'possessive', 'director', 'had', 'changed', 'one', 'line', 'dialogue', 'had', 'better', 'have', 'good', 'reason.Unfortunately', 'had', 'cut', 'out', 'enormous', 'chunks', 'many', 'extremely', 'funny', 'such', 'philosophers', 'who', 'insist', 'computer', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'think', 'ultimate', 'answer', 'sensitive', 'cops', 'restaurant', 'end', 'universe', 'Golgafrincham', 'B', 'Ark', 'end', 'movie', 'came', 'surprise', 'resembled', 'radio', 'TV', 'book', 'plot', 'was', 'producers', 'suddenly', 'ran', 'interest', 'money', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'demand', 'sequel', 'based', 'effort', 'several', 'scenes', 'actors', 'seem', 'less', '100', '%', 'committed', 'Was', ""'Avengers"", 'unreported', 'disputes', 'cast', 'Apart', 're-working', 'Eagles', 'Hitchhiker', 'theme', 'music', 'place', 'only', 'plug', 'gaps', 'Adams', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'should', 'have', 'filled.Overall', 'movie', 'disaster', 'only', 'way', 'Hitchhiker', 'can', 'succeed', 'cinema', 'someone', 'radio', 'series', 'dialogue', 'unedited', 'animation', 'voices']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition
638762,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B00005JO28,General Breadbasket,"[0, 2]","I like Douglas Adams' sense of humour, I really do. ""City of Death"" (which he wrote) is one of the funniest and cleverest Doctor Who serials ever. I'd heard bits and pieces about ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", usually from my Dad's friends. It was a quirky sci-fi comedy story, which became a radio series, a novel, and a television series in the 1970s. I think we had the first novel around somewhere too at home. I really wished I'd have read that instead of watching this film. It doesn't quite do the late Adams much justice.Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is your average British guy, more or less. If he's so average, though, why is his house getting bulldozed? Why does he have an alien for a best friend? Where did that girl he fancied get off to with that guy who asked if she wanted to check out his spaceship? And why will all these questions lead Arthur Dent on an adventure with a two headed man, a paranoid android and a interstellar vessel with an ""improbability drive""?These are a lot of important questions, but not half as important as THE question. No one knows what it is, but the answer is ""42"" and it all has something to do with the meaning of life, the universe and everything. The President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) wants to find the question for this answer, and Arthur gets all caught up in searching for it.The special effects are nice, I like how the alien races had some traditional effects going rather than being all computer done. Douglas Adams' ideas, like always, are/were interesting and amusing. The trouble with this film is that everything whizzed by so fast. There was not enough time to take everything in, I felt. To soak in the atmosphere, to admire the sets, to digest a concept or philosophy, to hear the sigh of the spacecraft properly. It was all zap, zap, zap, here, there and everywhere. If I turned my attention in real life as quickly as some of those shot sequences, I would have to be a very stressed position. Because of the pace, some of it is stressful to watch, I felt. I also didn't appreciate the more American side to it (certain casting choices, etc). Not that I don't like American comedy, its just that some of Douglas Adam's appeal is that he has a very British sort of humour, the way he arranges his words, the particular flavor to the more surreal parts. I think the script was fairly decent, if only we could have soaked it in well!Special features include a couple of deleted scenes, a couple of ""fake"" deleted scenes, which aren't that interesting. There's an ""Improbability Drive"" button, which takes you to a random part of the DVD each time you press it. There's a making of featurette, which goes over things in a general sort of way. There's two rather chatty commentaries, one from the director, producer and actors about the making of side of things, and one from the executive producers, who analyse the comedy of Douglas Adams. Bit of variety. There's also a gave to play with Marvin the robot (played by Warwick Davis). It's like hangman, but all the words to guess are four letters (no rude words though), and the more you get wrong the more Marvin falls apart, literally.Worth a look for the Douglas Adams fans, I guess, but if you're just getting into his quirky little world, I'd recommend you read the ""Hitchiker's Guide to The Galaxy"" books, or even check out the old British TV series, or even check out one of his Doctor Who serials, like the great ""City of Death"".",3,In This Case The Answer is 3 Stars,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,3482,"['like', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'sense', 'humour', 'really', 'do', 'City', 'Death', 'wrote', 'one', 'funniest', 'cleverest', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'ever', ""'d"", 'heard', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'usually', 'Dad', 'friends', 'was', 'quirky', 'sci-fi', 'comedy', 'story', 'became', 'radio', 'series', 'novel', 'television', 'series', '1970s', 'think', 'had', 'first', 'novel', 'around', 'somewhere', 'too', 'home', 'really', 'wished', ""'d"", 'have', 'read', 'instead', 'watching', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'late', 'Adams', 'much', 'justice.Arthur', 'Dent', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'average', 'British', 'guy', 'more', 'less', 'so', 'average', 'though', 'why', 'house', 'getting', 'bulldozed', 'Why', 'have', 'alien', 'best', 'friend', 'Where', 'did', 'girl', 'fancied', 'get', 'off', 'guy', 'who', 'asked', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'spaceship', 'why', 'will', 'all', 'questions', 'lead', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'adventure', 'two', 'headed', 'man', 'paranoid', 'android', 'interstellar', 'vessel', 'improbability', 'drive', 'are', 'lot', 'important', 'questions', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'important', 'question', 'one', 'what', 'answer', '42', 'something', 'do', 'meaning', 'life', 'universe', 'everything', 'President', 'Galaxy', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'find', 'question', 'answer', 'Arthur', 'caught', 'up', 'searching', 'it.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nice', 'like', 'how', 'alien', 'races', 'had', 'traditional', 'effects', 'going', 'rather', 'being', 'computer', 'done', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'ideas', 'always', 'are/were', 'interesting', 'amusing', 'trouble', 'film', 'everything', 'whizzed', 'fast', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'take', 'everything', 'felt', 'soak', 'atmosphere', 'admire', 'sets', 'digest', 'concept', 'philosophy', 'hear', 'sigh', 'spacecraft', 'properly', 'was', 'zap', 'zap', 'zap', 'here', 'everywhere', 'turned', 'attention', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'quickly', 'shot', 'sequences', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'stressed', 'position', 'pace', 'stressful', 'watch', 'felt', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'more', 'American', 'side', 'certain', 'casting', 'choices', 'etc', 'Not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'American', 'comedy', 'just', 'Douglas', 'Adam', 'appeal', 'very', 'British', 'sort', 'humour', 'way', 'words', 'particular', 'flavor', 'more', 'surreal', 'parts', 'think', 'script', 'was', 'fairly', 'decent', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'soaked', 'well', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'couple', 'fake', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'Improbability', 'Drive', 'button', 'random', 'part', 'DVD', 'time', 'press', 'making', 'featurette', 'things', 'general', 'sort', 'way', 'two', 'rather', 'chatty', 'commentaries', 'one', 'director', 'producer', 'actors', 'making', 'side', 'things', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'who', 'analyse', 'comedy', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'Bit', 'variety', 'also', 'gave', 'play', 'Marvin', 'robot', 'played', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'hangman', 'words', 'guess', 'are', 'four', 'letters', 'rude', 'words', 'more', 'get', 'wrong', 'more', 'Marvin', 'apart', 'look', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'fans', 'guess', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'quirky', 'little', 'world', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'read', 'Hitchiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'books', 'even', 'check', 'out', 'old', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'even', 'check', 'out', 'one', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'great', 'City', 'Death']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition
638763,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B00005JO28,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[3, 8]","And that's all you really want, right? ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" includes the original film in full surround-sound. The DVD is available in two versions --- Full Screen and Wide Screen. I watched the Full Screen version, but I'm sure the Wide Screen is great too. Subtitles are available in English, French and Spanish and there are also French and Spanish language tracks. If you're not a subtitles fan, you can also turn on close-captioning instead, but I believe that's only for the English audio version.Most people watching this will probably have already seen the movie in theaters and/or be familiar with one or more of the other incarnations of ""Hitchhiker's."" That said, here's a brief summary of the plot as well as some of the differences between this version and others:A British man, Arthur Dent, wakes up one morning to find a fleet of bulldozers getting ready to destroy his home to make way for a bypass. Things only get stranger when his good friend Ford appears and drags him off to the nearby pub, telling him the world's about to end. And sure enough, it does, but Ford manages to hitch a ride for himself and Arthur on the Vogon ship that destroyed it. Thus begins Arthur's whirlwind tour of the galaxy.A lot of the old familiar elements are still there, although some have been shortened or changed a bit. While you may find yourself missing certain things, for the most part, the film is a great adaptation of the story --- Douglas would definitely be happy. New things include two new characters that Douglas himself wrote for the movie --- Humma Kavula (a religious leader who campaigned against Zaphod Beeblebrox to become galactic president using the slogan ""Don't vote for stupid."") and Beeblebrox's vice-president - Questular Rontok. There is also a visit to the planet Vogsphere, with some amusing insight into the reasoning why the Vogons evolved the way they did. The other main new thing is the development of Tricia McMillan / Trillian, who's now a much-more engaging character and a love story between her and Arthur. And I can't end without mentioning the movies great soundtrack --- two versions of a wonderful new song ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" (big-band and lounge) as well as an enhanced version of the original Eagles' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy theme.""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" DVD includes a great set of Special Features:Additional Guide EntryAn additional entry to the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" about how the existence of the bable fish has been used as an argument to prove the non-existence of God. Great stuff.Deleted ScenesEarth: Mostly HarmlessFord instructs Arthur to look up Earth in the guide and Arthur finds that the description is only one word: harmless. Ford says that he sent off a new entry and now the new description is two words: Mostly Harmless. A great guide entry that unfortunately didn't make it into the actual film, but now you can see.""We're Going to Win""The Vogons give themselves a little pep talk. Kinda funny.""Impossible Forces""A love scene between Beeblebrox and Rontok. Neat because in the film, they just sorta end up together and it just kind of happens without explanation.Really Deleted ScenesDo Panic!First of two ""fake"" deleted scenes that were made just for the DVD. Arthur, Zaphod and Ford go all kamikaze. Just plain funny.Arthur EscapesSlartibartfast acts all evil and Arthur makes a grand escape.Sing Along - ""So Long & Thanks For All the Fish""This is pretty neat. It's just as you'd expect --- a sing-along of the song with bright follow-along lettering on the screen and a bouncing dolphin. Too bad they couldn't do it for the closing-credits version too.Audio CommentariesThere are two audio commentaries featuring the cast and crew of the movie. Although they tend to go off on tangents at times, for the most part, they keep things interesting, making for worthwhile commentary. Definitely make sure to check out both of these and maybe learn some things you never would have known otherwise about the film.Marvin's HangmanLike all things involving Marvin, this is really an exercise in self-punishment. The idea of the game is to guess a four-letter word. You guess letter-by-letter and each time you're incorrect, another part of Marvin is detached until you lose. I say that because the chances of winning are near-impossible. There are lots of possibilities for each letter, so even if you eventually even manage to get just the first letter, you're almost certainly screwed with the rest because you used up most of your chances on the first. Marvin provides snide remarks :) throughout.Sneak PeeksFlightplanThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the WardrobeDark WaterLostChicken LittleAliens of the DeepTV on DVDBeautiful PeopleI'm not going to go on too much about the previews except to say two things --- I haven't seen ""Flightplan,"" but the trailer made me interested in it. I've read that it's gotten rather mixed reviews, but great box office. The other thing worth noting is the promo or ""Chicken Little"" which I remember seeing in the theater --- a spoof on ""The Hitchhiker's Guide"" featuring Louis Armstrong's ""Wonderful World""

This movie reflects that. He adapted his own book to the screen which are usually the best kinds of adaptions done from book to film if film makers are ever smart enough to get an author to adapt his own work. Starring Martin Freeman (Sherlock, the Hobbit) as well as Sam Rockwell (Moon, Ironman 2) and Zooey Deschanel (500 days of summer).

Just before the big ka-boom, 3 people manage to leave. Arthur Dent, a very ordinary Englishman,  and his longtime friend Ford Prefect (who is actually an alien  researcher for the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", a book that explains foreign worlds to aliens) are able to ""catch a ride"" on the Vogon's ship. The 3rd one is Tricia McMillan (aka ""Trillian"") who leaves a cocktail party with flamboyant egotist Zaphod Beeblebrox, who claims to have a spaceship (and turns out not to be lying about it). The rest of the movie follows their travels and travails.WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT:Casting was pretty well deadon. I *LOVED* Alan Rickman as the voice of the thoroughly depressed Marvin the Robot, Arthur was perfect, and Trillian and Ford were acceptable if not outstanding.Most of the special effects work was well-done, particularly the ""planet building"" scenes. (Vogons were an exception...they just ended up looking like overgrown Muppets. I also felt the Earth's explosion was a bit weak.)The cutaways (when entries from the ""Guide"" were read) were amusing and got most of the audience with me to laugh (of course, it's hard to say if they had read the book or were complete ""newbies"" to Adams' work....)The love triangle between Zaphod, Arthur, and Trillian is glossed over in the books but explored more fully in the movie which probably gives the flick some desperately needed ""chick appeal"".WHAT THEY MESSED UP:Several plot points important to the book weren't explained, so you never really find out why people flying on the spaceship Heart of Gold turn into couches...or why a pair of heat-seeking missiles become flowers and a whale.The things that smacked Zaphod, Arthur, Ford etc. in the forehead when they thought really probably aren't essential to the movie plot, but since they were included some attempt to explain what the heck was going on should have been made.The opening musical number (with the dolphins SINGING) very nearly made me leave the theatre. Thankfully, the movie is NOT a musical...but it was completely wrong for the flick.BOTTOM LINE:If you read the books and love them, go see it. You'll enjoy seeing Adams come to life even with the flaws. If you're a sci-fi fan unfamiliar with Adams, read the book BEFORE you go or you'll be lost in the plot.

Originally meant as a jab at the then current crop of self-help hitchhiking guides; The Hitchhiker's Guide To Travelling Across Europe, for example, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"" offers warm nostalgia to lovers of Douglas Adams' cult classic sci-fi comedy, but may be perceived as a meteroic lead weight swarming with silly ideas and aged humor to others. While the answer to The Ultimate Question, as posed in the story, (The answer is 42 but nobody can remember the question), and a recital of the third worst poetry ever written, still seem like comedic genius in concept, their execution here is stale and contrived, like familiar trophies alongside Monty Python's Spam joke and Lumberjack Song in the comedy hall of fame. This all played better in the original BBC-TV serialized production, it's low budget and weekly half hour soap opera-like installments served the story of the vagabonds in space well, with almost all emphasis on comedy and character. Here, Hollywood looms like a star filled galaxy over what amounts to some snappy dialogue and clever ideas. Still, like the original book became a cult classic, so might this movie. It's difficult to assess from an original perspective, so ingrained is the book and it's sequels in my mind. Sam Rockwell plays a very funny, egotistical, opportunistic 'President' of the Universe, but earthlings Arthur (Martin Freeman) and girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel), fade into cyber-dust as Rockwell steals every scene. Hollywood has proposed that this will be the first in a series of five movies based on the book and it's sequels. I wish them well and I would remind them that it is the Hitchhiker's Guide itself which holds the keys to the universe and is a Bible-like reference against danger and death to our protagonist.

Wayne Cochran,"[0, 0]","The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a faithful adaptation of the previous versions of the story told in the radio, book, and television adaptations of Douglas Adams' story.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a sci-fi comedy based on the first novel Hitchhiker's Guide series. The theme of the movie is the search for the meaning of life.In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, we meet Arthur Dent, a rather ordinary human that lives in a rather ordinary town, that wakes up one Thursday morning to find his home is about to be destroyed to make way for a bypass. Little does he realize that his best friend, Ford Prefect is not an ordinary human. Prefect takes Arthur on an intergalactic adventure where they are chased by Vogons, rescued by President of the Galaxy, and unexpectedly run into a lovely girl that Arthur met at a party and totally blew it with.If you are familiar with other versions of the story, you will realize that once again some elements of the story have been changed for the movie. Although most of the work on this movie was done after his death, Adams still had a big hand in this adaptation. It definitely carries his signature humor, which tends to act as a double edged sword: If you love Adams' humor then you will enjoy this movie, if not then you probably won't.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is rated PG for thematic elements, action and mild language.

They cut out ALL the best scenes and the ones they put in were way below par. (the ""42"" scene was particularly cringy)  THEY CUT OUT THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE AND DISASTER AREA!!!!!!!! All the stuff that made the books and mini-series so great were gone and replaced by slapstick humor designed for a younger generation of American viewers.  None of the great stuff about God and the universe was in it, and when some of it did creep in, it felt like they put it in only because they were forced to.  There was way too much character development (the Arthur-Trillian romance comes to mind) that actually took away from the characters- what was with the Vice President and Zaphod? Even the doors were wrong- they're supposed to say ""Please enjoy your trip through this door"", or ""Thank you for going through this door"".  Instead they just sighed. WHY????? But Marvin was the worst..they turned him from the most hilarious part from the books and mini-series into the most annoying character ever.  The ""Marvin hero"" scene at the end was way too much.  The whole point of this is IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A STORY...it's supposed to be a hysterical observation of human society, and as a huge fan of the original mini-series I was highly disappointed with this, simply because this marks the end of Hitchhiker's Guide as a cult sci-fi phemnomenon, and its beginning as a badly made kid's adaptation.  Sad isn't it?  To everyone who only saw this movie...THIS IS NOT THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE! Go read the books or watch the mini-series..they're so much better.

638775,A378N0URYV5VCN,B00005JO28,Iconophoric,"[1, 2]","Major book and movie spoilers.I debated back and forth with myself about whether to see this film. On the one hand, I felt removed enough from the heat of my Hitchhikers' fanboy period to view any recreation of it calmly and fairly, in the ""share and enjoy"" mode. On the other, if it turned out to be grindingly stupid, I knew I would still be capable of feeling hurt and enraged by the abuse of this property. I tried to tell myself I wouldn't, but in my heart I knew the truth. Finally, on impulse-- the only way I could probably ever wind up going-- I did go to see it.To put one myth to rest, the level of special effects is uniformly state of the art. No effect feels cheesy. Zaphod's second head is a good example of creative effects problem solving. It is no longer like a sock puppet head, and not like Ray Milland standing too close to Rosie Grier. When the second head pops up, Zaphod's every day head flips back like a flesh and blood Pez candy dispenser. It may have been a budget expedient, but I think it works pretty well, the now-you-see-him now-you-don't act emphasizing that the second head is the worst-judgment, unrepressed id Zaphod that shows up at the most inopportune moments.The film certainly has many of the book and radio series good lines. It does a nice job of interpolating the entries from the Guide-- the parts presented in italics in the books, and by a veddy proper and witty British narrator in the radio series-- in the form of a sort of simple Flash animation on a laptop. These animated bits, retaining major chunks of Adams' wildest science and philosophical digressions in a voice very much like the radio program's, are one of the new films highlights.Another standout element, for me, was the characterization of the Vogons. Someone here called the Vogons ""puppets"", but after seeing the film, I think that sells these beautiful creations disasterously short. The first thing I thought, when I heard them described as puppets, was The Dark Crystal. And while I give The Dark Crystal its props, this thought nearly kept me from wanting to take a chance with the movie. I knew the Vogons had to be more threatening and nasty than anything in that earlier film, in order to match my mind's image of them. The good news is, they look wonderful. Real. Creepy. Calling the Vogons puppets is akin to describing the original character design for Alien a puppet.The Vogon's destruction of the planet Earth is something new for the screen. At this point, do we need one more cinema explosion? How many changes can be rung from what has become your basic global destruction clich&eacute;? This moment is rapidly presented, chilling, and we don't linger for long before we are off again. The method didn't come book, chapter and verse from the radio series, or the book, but it is the most memorable destruction of any planet I have seen in any film.The events in book one of The Hitchhiker's Guide series grind to an unceremonious halt shortly after the mice have tried to remove Arthur Dent's brain in the scene where Zaphod, Trillian and Ford are having a bite to eat. In the book, this scene does not take place on a reconstituted Magarathean Earth that neatly and comfortingly ties all the disorder introduced into Dent's life at the start of the story into a neat bow, however. If you haven't read that book one in a long time, you may have forgotten that the original book ended so jarringly that it probably left you flipping for the next page, when there was none there. That is perhaps the major change to the first book by the new Hitchhiker's movie, and it is not an unfriendly one. The film creates a closure for the non-fan audience, which is probably necessary, while not inflicting a change that cuts off the possibility of further episodes.That said, the new film DOES transplant a happy Disney take on a fairly bleak --or at least diffuse-- book ending. This is just the thing that many fans, who hoped against hope that major points of the books dark humor would be retained, feared. And they were right. Still, I don't think this change comes anywhere close to rendering the film null and void. I can believe Adams himself conceded to this particular ending, partly on the grounds of being certain it would play better with the general audience.There's no doubt that the new film is a tough one to see with objectivity, if you are a fan of Adams' books. Like virtually all film biographies and adaptations of big books, this film skims over the source material, making sure to touch all the high points. And, like most films from another source, it often seems to dance all around the content without ever managing to penetrate it or explode its greater possibilities. If you know many of the lines and ideas of this series second-nature, you will find a checklist of them in the new film. This makes it hard to tell how well the film hangs together as a coherent experience for non-fans in the audience. I couldn't crack that question. The film gets points for a superb production design and look. But the humor --and Adams WAS a major humorist-- isn't as pointed, or hysterically funny, basically, as it was in the radio series. I could be convinced that they may have had to down-play some of the radio plays over-the-top characterizations for film. But there is far less authentic wild energy in the movie.I think it's a decent little film. But there is the feeling that this most quirky of all literary properties somehow didn't get the idiosyncratic handling for the big screen that it needed. I think it is actually possible the makers erred on the side of respectfulness to the source. For most Adams fans, that won't be perceived as a terrible thing.",4,Enjoyable.

638777,A19JYLHD94K94D,B00005JO28,Itamar Katz,"[2, 3]","Well, what did you expect, people? Friggin' Citizen Kane? This is the Hitchhiker's Guide. Of course it's idiotic, illogical, superficial, fragmented and full of holes. No, this is not a masterpiece, but it delivers just what it needs to, and it's as good as it could ever be. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a hilariously funny, evilly sarcastic, impossibly anarchistic piece of satire. It's not a hundred percent true to the source material, either, of course - naturally, that would be impossible. Yes, seventy percent of the jokes have been cut, but what do you expect? Would you really prefer to have a five-film series, one for each book in the saga? From a purist's point of view maybe that would be ideal, but again, impossible. Reread the books and you will find that each one contains hardy twenty minutes of plot and hundreds of jokes and observations. In that form, the Hitchhiker's Guide could make for fantastic prose and, maybe, potentially great stand-up, but very, very boring cinema. The script only left a handful of the observations and increases the part of romance and adventure, as would be only natural to do, and it did it in the best possible way and without hurting the spirit and the style of the origin - the script was co-written by Mr. Adams himself, and it shows.Kudos on the production. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a perfect British-American cooperation - namely, a British looking film with an American looking production, which gives us the best of both worlds. The highly-British, almost Monty-Pythonesque feel of the source material is kept, yet the production looks much more professional than any other British film. Jim Henson's workshop (on the American side) provided the wonderful looking creatures, and the Guide segments are escorted by absolutely brilliant animation sequences. The cast is also a great American-British combination. Martin Freeman (of the hit BBC series 'The Office') is the perfect Arthur Dent, as averagely British as one can possibly be; and despite my (and many other fans') initial skepticism, Mos Def also turns in a respectable Ford Prefect - Do remember that descriptions of Ford were hardly given in the books, and it cannot be assumed that he is white any more than it can be assumed that he is black. The aliens, though, are American - and they're as weird, unearthly and vulgar as Americans must really seem to British. Sam Rockwell completely steals the show as a fantastic Zaphod Beeblebrox, in a performance that may be the best of his career; and let's not forget the terrific cameo by John Malkovich, as a character that was not in the books but was created by Adams himself especially for the film. Finally, I cannot help but mention the great Alan Rickman, picture perfect as Marvin the Paranoid Android (it was either him or John Cleese).Don't Panic! The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not half as bad as some of these reviews will have you think, it's a film that's funny and enjoyable from beginning to end, but don't take it too seriously or you might get disappointed. If you're a fan of the books, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you never read them, just one piece of advice - don't try to make sense of the plot or the science, because they make no sense. Just take it for what it is, and enjoy the ride.",4,Delivers,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,3287,"['Well', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'people', 'Friggin', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'course', 'idiotic', 'illogical', 'superficial', 'fragmented', 'full', 'holes', 'No', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'what', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'evilly', 'sarcastic', 'impossibly', 'anarchistic', 'piece', 'satire', 'not', 'hundred', 'percent', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'either', 'course', 'naturally', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'Yes', 'seventy', 'percent', 'jokes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'Would', 'really', 'prefer', 'have', 'five-film', 'series', 'one', 'book', 'saga', 'purist', 'point', 'view', 'maybe', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'again', 'impossible', 'Reread', 'books', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'hardy', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'plot', 'hundreds', 'jokes', 'observations', 'form', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'could', 'make', 'fantastic', 'prose', 'maybe', 'potentially', 'great', 'stand-up', 'very', 'very', 'boring', 'cinema', 'script', 'only', 'left', 'handful', 'observations', 'part', 'romance', 'adventure', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'natural', 'do', 'did', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'hurting', 'spirit', 'style', 'origin', 'script', 'was', 'co-written', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'production', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'perfect', 'British-American', 'cooperation', 'namely', 'British', 'looking', 'film', 'American', 'looking', 'production', 'best', 'worlds', 'highly-British', 'almost', 'Monty-Pythonesque', 'feel', 'source', 'material', 'kept', 'production', 'much', 'more', 'professional', 'other', 'British', 'film', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'workshop', 'American', 'side', 'provided', 'wonderful', 'looking', 'creatures', 'Guide', 'segments', 'are', 'escorted', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'animation', 'sequences', 'cast', 'also', 'great', 'American-British', 'combination', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'hit', 'BBC', 'series', ""'The"", 'Office', 'perfect', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'averagely', 'British', 'one', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'many', 'other', 'fans', 'initial', 'skepticism', 'Mos', 'Def', 'also', 'respectable', 'Ford', 'Prefect', 'Do', 'remember', 'descriptions', 'Ford', 'were', 'hardly', 'given', 'books', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'assumed', 'white', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'assumed', 'black', 'aliens', 'are', 'American', ""'re"", 'weird', 'unearthly', 'vulgar', 'Americans', 'must', 'really', 'seem', 'British', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'completely', 'show', 'fantastic', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'career', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'terrific', 'cameo', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'books', 'was', 'created', 'Adams', 'especially', 'film', 'Finally', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'mention', 'great', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'picture', 'perfect', 'Marvin', 'Paranoid', 'Android', 'was', 'John', 'Cleese', '.Do', ""n't"", 'Panic', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'reviews', 'will', 'have', 'think', 'film', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'beginning', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'might', 'get', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'fan', 'books', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'never', 'read', 'just', 'one', 'piece', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'plot', 'science', 'make', 'sense', 'Just', 'take', 'what', 'enjoy', 'ride']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

The main handicap for this film is that everything that was pure imagination on the radio show has to become visible, visual, hence no longer requiring the audience's imagination but satisfying their visual curiosity. Then of course this film has to use visual surprises and visual absurd hiatuses or oxymora. Thus the main character has to be in his pajamas all along since he was ""captured"" in them. A little bit skimpy for long distance travelling. Then I must admit they did a tremendous job at finding incongruous and funny situations even if some of them are trite, like being master-minded by plain mice, though they look cute our masters in their little fragile beings, and all the more fragile when they are crushed as flat as a cartoon drawing by some kind of torturing device. Apart from that it does not have any kind of deep meaning. It is all funny and it does not aim at being anything else, British funny of course, so rather just silly or funny ah ah, but not hilarious or brain meddling funny. The radio show was a lot more mysterious and brainy because it was entirely relying on the words and it was at times extremely witty.

That said I of course did not have my hopes too high for this film, however, as the release got closer, I started really feeling like they had better have done a decent job with this.  I mean come on, the material is too high quality to screw up as long as they stuck with it.  The result?  They did a good job.  I saw elements from the movies Brazil, Monty Python, Soylent Green in this film, maybe even Day of the Dolphin, and that is a good thing.  A few of the highlights for me:1.  The dolphin footage from the beginning was fantastic!2.  When Ford & Arthur get picked up by the Vogon ship, and they show it from their perspective i.e. from ground to interior of ship, was incredible.3.  When Arthur sees his home devastated while the workmen start freaking out over the Vogon ship was excellent.4.  The nature footage of the ""new"" Earth was simply beautiful.5.  The ""sighing"" doors, I've GOT to get myself a recording for my doors!I could go on, but for the ending, I think they should have said, ""ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW SHOULD READ THE BOOKS!""

638783,A26O0T192IBKY1,B00005JO28,J. Alford,"[3, 4]","Visually, I thought the HH movie was brilliant. The Vogons appeared more here like the shiftless old British pencilpushers that they were originally modeled after, although they get way to much airtime in it. They are apparently the replacement for the Galaxy Police that were normally after Zaphod.Zaphod himself is like a bi-headed blonde hipster with an Elvis complex. You probably know by now that he had the fliptop head as apposed the the one-next-to-the-other like most traditional two-headed characters, but this was just stupid at times, especially when he actually has his taken off halfway through the film(along with half his brain!). Plus his way of speaking was like he came from Kentucky or somthing.Ford was okay. I didn't have any problems with him being African-American(or African-British?)because Ford's character was never fully explained visually in any of the HH books aside from appearing to look human. He was a cowboy in the HH Illustrated version.Trillian was alright too, but too much emphasis was placed on hers and Authur's ""relationship"", which of course never went anywhere in the HH books aside from them having a daughter together.Authur though was dead on. The couldn't have gotten a better guy to play him. There were times that he was a little more enthusiastic than his literary counterpart, and other times when he was more cowardly.Marvin was pretty much great. I thought his robot design was just to bulky though and not very practical when your running from a horde of laserblaster Vogons. You actually do feel sorry for him at one point, but the POV gun he carries makes a real impression.Other things that were added into the film that were never in any of the other HH incarnations worked and didn't work. The bit where the catch up with Deep Thought years later to find out what she(yeah, ""she"")has been doing for the past few million years was okay. But alot of the unecessary parts involving the Vogons, Zaphod's vice-president, spiritual leader Hamma Kuvula(despite a good performance by Malchovich)and his whole subplot was pretty much unnecessary, and Trillian's rescue(also despite a cameo by the original Marvin)was also something that could've been left out. The parts that specifically stuck to the original HH storyline were alot of times rushed and very hard to understand to anyone who hadn't gone over the other HH material before seeing it.

I have read all the books, in fact, almost all of Douglas Adams' books.  I have watched the BBC adaptation, which I thought was vaguely funny, but it almost invariably made me fall asleep.Then I watched the new film version, and I actually liked it a lot.  It's faster paced, filled with as many jokes as possible, and has Arthur and Trillian falling in love.  While, I think in the books, Arthur and Trillian's strange relationship is very funny, movie goers simply love to see a love story.The muppet Vogons were great characters, as were most others, and I think that Marvin was finally done right.  Come on, who is more depressing to listen to drone on than Alan Rickman?Now, as to why many don't like this movie.  Many of those whom do not like it have read the novel...  and I just have to say this, being an avid reader of said novel, and the friend of many whom have read the novel...  The sorts of people whom like to read a novel like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are the sort of people whom like to complain about movies.  They are especially the sorts of people whom complain about any movie they see based on one of their favorite novels.  Oh, well, you just can't please those people because their ""in head"" version is better than anything that could ever be produced.I'm not saying that the film has no problems.  I didn't even give it a five star, and I'm fairly liberal with five stars.  Zaphod in particular, although I think he works OK, is a bit too over the top for me.

Why? Most people get their movie reviews from sources such as RottenTomatoes.com, Ebert and Roeper, etc. When I peruse DVD reviews here at Amazon, I want to know about sound quality, picture quality, and extras such as outtakes, director/actor commentaries, deleted scenes, making of documentaries, and so on.Having said that, I figured I'd be a hypocrite and weigh in on the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.My husband is a rabid fan of Douglas Adams, and has read all of his books. I once tried to read Adams, and couldn't get into what appeared to me as fanciful, fantastical ramblings. It doesn't help that I don't appreciate British humor.My husband even liked the 1982 BBC DVD of Hitchhikers's Guide. Every time I walked into the room, I thought 'Ugh!' It reminded me of those horrid Doctor Who shows...Out of deep love for my husband, I agreed to watch the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.I am surprised to report that not only was I NOT bored to death, but I had a few laugh-out-loud moments! Mos Def is always a treat to watch (loved him in HBO's 'Something the Lord Made'), and Alan Rickman's turn as the depressed, paranoid robot Martin was perfect (based on all the things that my husband told me of the print version! Incidentally, Rickman co-starred with Mos Def in STLM.)Sam Rockwell really transformed himself for the role of blonde-maned, two-headed Zaphod Beeblebrox. I was overjoyed when he graced the screen; he was totally fascinating to watch (as was his second head!)Martin Freeman was brilliant as the bland, clueless Arthur Dent and Zooey Deschanel was an equally bland counterpart/love interest as ""Trillian"".John Malkovich was his usual ""Johnny One-Note"" self, and his character--Humma Kavula--seemed non-essential to the story. (This coming from someone who hasn't read the books, mind you.) However, the blank, staring holes behind his glasses--as well as his many slim, metallic ""legs"" served as neat eye candy that made me chuckle.From the dolphin song intro (""thanks for the fish!"") to 42, the babel fish to infinite improbability drive, the Vogan captain's horrid poetry to the planetary construction site, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was delightful. I really enjoyed the movie, much to the surprise of my husband.And you know what? When the face of Douglas Adams flashed on the screen at the end (a result of the finite probability generator), I actually shed a tear.

The choice of Martin Freeman (Tim Canterbury from BBC's The Office) as Arthur Dent was inspired, and Mos Def provided a surprising performance as Ford Prefect.

(It's been over a decade and a half since I read the original five-volume trilogy, so my memory is rusty.)Strangely, given that Adams has co-writer credit for the screenplay, the film lacks the quirky British sense of humor (humour?) that made the novel laugh-out-loud-til-your-belly-hurts funny.

Sam Rockwell plays Zaphod Beeblebrox as an unfunnily stupid, boorish, and annoying lout, and Marvin (the Paranoid Android) is simply NOT FUNNY (and I normally LOVE Alan Rickman).

638790,A2ZWTA18X37QOZ,B00005JO28,"Jason Oey ""UltramarineX""","[3, 4]","**Warning: Some spoilers ahead**Let me get this out of the way first.  Prior to this movie I had no knowledge about the Hitchhiker's Guide books, radio show, or TV series.  I came into this movie bereft of any idea about what this movie was going to be about.  That said, I still found The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy an enjoyable movie experience, yet I could not help but think that I would have enjoyed this movie more if I had a prior understanding of its source material.The movie centres around a character named Arthur Dent who is taken away from Earth by his alien friend, Ford Perfect, minutes before it is destroyed by a Vogon construction fleet.  He is then taken on a journey across the galaxy by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy, in order to find the ultimate question.  Accompanying them is Trillian, a woman Arthur met while he was on Earth, and Marvin the mentally depressed android.The actors in this movie were all great.  Martin Freeman, who plays Arthur Dent, did a good job portraying a man who is simply overwhelmed by everything going on around him.  His character often looks terrified by all the weird events that happen to him, such as when he was tied up by the Vogons for being a stowaway on one of their ships, and being forced to listen and compliment the Vogons on their poetry.  But in my opinion, the best acting job was done by Alan Rickman, the voice Marvin.  You couldn't help but feel sorry at times for Marvin when he sounds off about how crappy his situation in life is.The special effects in The Hitchhiker's Guide were top notch.  This was best exemplified when Arthur took a tour of an under construction Earth Mark II.  The ride through the orbiting construction equipment definitely brought a smile to my face because of its sheer coolness.  I also loved the weird humor that was in this movie.  From dolphins leaving Earth before its imminent destruction, to a whale floating in mid-air contemplating its own existence, rarely have I seen humor as original.However, no movie is perfect.  Personally I felt that the pacing of the latter half of the movie was a little choppy, as if they were trying to cram in as much plot as possible.  Also, as I said before I've had no knowledge of the movie's source material, so I was left wondering where a few of the jokes came from.  For example, while I still found it hilarious when the Vogons ran from Ford's towel, I would have liked to have known why they were so afraid of that towel.  This is representative of the movie's primary weakness, which is that it seems to be geared more towards those who have an understanding of Douglas Adams' work.In the end, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is still a gem of a movie.  Fans of Adams' work will likely eat this movie up and ask for seconds.  As for everyone else Don't Panic (sorry, I just had to say that), I still think that this movie is worth a look.  It is definitely one of the most original sci-fi movies to come out in a while.  Heck, this is one of the most original movies to have come out in a long time period, so don't miss it.I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",4,Don't leave Earth without it.,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,3136,"['**Warning', 'spoilers', 'ahead**Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'first', 'Prior', 'movie', 'had', 'knowledge', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'books', 'radio', 'show', 'TV', 'series', 'came', 'movie', 'bereft', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'about', 'said', 'still', 'found', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'experience', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'had', 'prior', 'understanding', 'source', 'material.The', 'movie', 'character', 'named', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'who', 'taken', 'away', 'Earth', 'alien', 'friend', 'Ford', 'Perfect', 'minutes', 'destroyed', 'Vogon', 'construction', 'fleet', 'then', 'taken', 'journey', 'galaxy', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'president', 'galaxy', 'order', 'find', 'ultimate', 'question', 'Accompanying', 'Trillian', 'woman', 'Arthur', 'met', 'was', 'Earth', 'Marvin', 'mentally', 'depressed', 'android.The', 'actors', 'movie', 'were', 'great', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'who', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'who', 'simply', 'overwhelmed', 'everything', 'going', 'character', 'often', 'terrified', 'weird', 'events', 'happen', 'such', 'when', 'was', 'tied', 'up', 'Vogons', 'being', 'stowaway', 'one', 'ships', 'being', 'forced', 'listen', 'compliment', 'Vogons', 'poetry', 'opinion', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'voice', 'Marvin', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'times', 'Marvin', 'when', 'how', 'crappy', 'situation', 'life', 'is.The', 'special', 'effects', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'was', 'best', 'exemplified', 'when', 'Arthur', 'took', 'tour', 'construction', 'Earth', 'Mark', 'II', 'ride', 'orbiting', 'construction', 'equipment', 'definitely', 'brought', 'smile', 'face', 'sheer', 'coolness', 'also', 'loved', 'weird', 'humor', 'was', 'movie', 'dolphins', 'leaving', 'Earth', 'imminent', 'destruction', 'whale', 'floating', 'mid-air', 'contemplating', 'own', 'existence', 'rarely', 'have', 'seen', 'humor', 'original.However', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Personally', 'felt', 'pacing', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'choppy', 'were', 'trying', 'cram', 'as', 'much', 'plot', 'possible', 'Also', 'said', ""'ve"", 'had', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'where', 'few', 'jokes', 'came', 'example', 'still', 'found', 'hilarious', 'when', 'Vogons', 'ran', 'Ford', 'towel', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'afraid', 'towel', 'representative', 'movie', 'primary', 'weakness', 'be', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'who', 'have', 'understanding', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'work.In', 'end', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'still', 'gem', 'movie', 'Fans', 'Adams', 'work', 'will', 'likely', 'eat', 'movie', 'up', 'ask', 'seconds', 'everyone', 'else', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Panic', 'sorry', 'just', 'had', 'say', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'look', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'while', 'Heck', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'period', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'it.I', 'give', 'movie', '8', '10']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

I was crushed by his premature death because one of the truly original thinkers and commentators on the inherent bizarreness of the universe was gone. I had very deep reservations about whether the novels could be brought to the screen by Adams -- let along anyone else. However, Adams had apparently completed substantial parts of the screenplay at the time of his death. As astute as he was, he realized that he could not transport his book plots, item by item to the film genre.What amazed me, seeing this DVD, was the thoughtful way the movie presents the ""feel"" of the novels without eroneously trying to remain slavishly faithful to them. There are favorite parts that anyone who has read the books will miss, but if what you love is Adams wonderfully goofy humor, this is a wonderful movie. The director, the talented enselble cast, and the whimsical sets all recreate the true ""essence"" of the Adams novels.If you enjoyed the books and are willing to endure the changes due to the difference in the medium of film and book, then you will really enjoy this great movie.

What happened to Milliways'? What happened to the survivors' ship and the cavemen on Earth? While this production has more modern effects and production capability, they just cut chunks out of the story.Martin Freeman does a reasonable recreation of Arthur Dent, one of the very very few survivors after the destruction of Earth. Mos Def has a fun time portraying Arthur Dent's friend Ford Prefect, who Arthur learns is not from planet Earth, but is a visitor, updating the galactic best-seller ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""According to this version, President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (who just happens to be Ford's semi half-cousin) has unwittingly signed the order to destroy planet Earth to allow for the creation of a hyperspace bypass.As Earth is about to be destroyed, Ford spirits himself and Arthur aboard one of the Vogon contruction fleet's ships. The Vogons (who are the ones demolishing Earth) are hideous creatures who have a penchant for bad poetry. When the Vogons toss Arthur and Ford out an airlock, they again ""hitch"" and find themselves aboard a stolen wonder spaceship, powered by the infinite improbability drive. The thief is none other than Zaphod, (Sam Rockwell) who has convinced an Earth woman, Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) to travel with him. As it turns out, Trillian (formerly known as Trisha McMillan) is the woman upon whom Arthur had a crush, before Zaphod intrigues Trillian (in front of Arthur) with the line ""I'm from another planet.""I suppose I would have enjoyed this version more, had there not been previous versions to compare.The ending here is more up-beat than the TV series, but the missing pieces just ruined the overall effect for me.

Unfortunately, it also doesn't have any humor.  If you expect something as silly and clever as Month python Holly Grail, you will be cruelly disappointed.The actors are not that good (but it's hard to see whether it's their fault or wether it's because they don't have any material - good or bad - to start with).  The plot is inexistent.  The special effects are not even that good (but they're the best the movie has to offer).The only mildly inspiring sequence is at the end of the movie when you see the lead ""character"" visiting the earth being rebuilt from the ground up (or from the core out).  That's mildly funny, the concept is awe inspiring, and you get a lot of sweeping vistas, which is always pleasing to the eye.  Of course, all the ""directing"" those require is to stuck a camera on the nose of a plane, but by that time, I was just looking for something, anything, that would bring a modicum of visual pleasure.Some will say that we should be generous with the director, who after all took the challenge to make an impossible movie.

I, myself, am a late addition to Hitchhiker fandom - I only read the first book a few weeks ago - but yes, I know the history: how Adams dreamed up the idea while hitchhiking through Europe, years later turned it into a BBC radio show, then a BBC TV show, THEN the books, a video game, and - at last - a movie.  All of those versions differ with each other so it is only natural that the movie be different in its own way.So far, what the fans seem not to like are the changes - the most salient of which is the addition of the John Malkovitch character.  It's true, that storyline doesn't really go anywhere, but he is funny.  I think that they are setting things up for the sequel.What is important is what this movie gets right, and that is the spirit of Douglas Adams.  Despite the Americans, the movie has that all-important, Pythonesque, British-humor feel to it.  One of the best things about it is the way it handles the Guide itself: the content comes pretty faithfully from the book, Stephen Fry (of Blackadder fame) is the voice of the guide, and it provides little cartoon illustrations of what it is saying.  Even though most of the characters (inexplicably) turn out to be American, they work for me, and they are all fine comedic actors.There are two types of people who do not like this film.  The first are those who are not fans of the novels, so they wouldn't like ANY Hitchhiker film.  The second are hard-core Hitchhiker films who don't want the material changed in ANY way.  I think the rest of us will enjoy it.  There are just too many funny things going on not to like it - especially (without giving anything away) the bits with the whale and the dolphins.

I see now that death by dump truck would have been a blessing. While Adams is listed as one of the screenwriters, one has to wonder if director Garth Jennings bothered consulting the source for anything more than its title. Banal little details were blown out to epic monotony, while the clever and appealing meat of the story is treated like a footnote. ""So maybe the special effects would save it,"" you ask?  Apparently Jennings blew his entire CGI budget on the stupid Humma Kavula trick, leaving nothing for Zaphod Beeblebrox's second head.  What the *%#^?There was one saving grace: I dearly love Martin Freeman as Arthur, and am convinced no one could have been a better Dent. But watch his face in the promo interviews.

There was probably a lot of stuff that flew over my head that dedicated fans were laughing at, but there was a great deal of satire and interesting ideas presented in the movie. The film is a light fare, rated PG, but kids would be bored silly with this movie. The dialogue is more advanced than your normal family fare.  As a movie it's funny, but it really has no backbone.  The movie has a hard time staying on a fixed track and finding a place to go to.  In the end you may have questions that don't pertain to the existence of the universe, but are more like ""where the hell was the plot?""  Yes, I know that there are other books in the series, yes I bet there will be a sequel, but still, you need a plot that leads somewhere.  The first two of the LOTR films had a ""rounding up and leading into"" at the end, but then you can argue that it was certain that all three were to be made.  This film has to rely on box office success, and unfortunetly it looks like it's nothing stellar, only 21 million opening weekend (it's bad when analysts were expecting 40 million). The movie is fun, some interesting ideas, hilarious moments, but feels like a mess that needs to be sorted out.ACTING: Great cast, really great. Sam Rockwell was hilarious, and so was Mos Def.  I usually despise it when the music world tries to enter the film world, but Mos Def made a smooth transition and in my opinion can actually act (unlike Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, Eminem, Ja Rule, DMX, and the list goes on).BOTTOM LINE: Great spark to the beginning of the summer movie season even though it opened April 29th.  Traditionally the ""summer"" movie season didn't start till Memorial Day weekend, but it gets pushed further back every year.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 7]","Although many people who grew up either reading the books, watching the TV series or both will probably be upset with this film adaption, I have to admit that I really enjoyed this work.  Although I've never read any of the books, I did watch the series on PBS when I was growing up.With that in mind, this film was very pleasing to me.  Sure, it's slow in bits and doesn't make sense most of the time, but neither did the TV series.  In fact, ""Hitchhiker's"" was never really meant to make much sense.  It's silly and fun.The humor of this film can sometimes be hard to swallow for the uninitiated.  There are also a lot of inside jokes for fans of the TV show (and I assume the books as well), but none of that gets into the way of people experiencing the ""Guide"" for the first time.  Martin Freeman does a brilliant job as plain ol' Arthur Dent, who's having a bad day.  His home is scheduled to be demolished to make way for a new highway.  Little does he know that his friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), has decided to save his miserable life just before the Earth itself is destroyed to make way for an intergalactic highway.  This leads to a whirlwind adventure of planet-hopping where we are introduced to Vogons, Magrathea, Humma Kavula (John Malkovich), Marvin the depressed robot, and Zaphod Beeblebrox, president of the Galaxy.  Beeblebrox is played wonderfully by Sam Rockwell.  It's as if he channels Elvis and George W. Bush, then mixes them together with stereotypical sleaziness.  He really stands from the rest of the cast.  Marvin is voiced by Alan Rickman and brought to life by Warwick Davis.One other character that we get a look at is the only other surviving human, Trillian.  Played by the everygirl-lovely Zooey Deschanel, Trillian is every geeks dream.At times, the visual effects can be quite breath-taking, like the scene in which Arthur takes a tour of the planet factory.  At other times, the viewer has to blur over some of the obviously fake effects.I'd go into the plot a little more, but it'd be pointless since the entire point of ""Guide"" is to sit back and have a few intelligent, and not-so-intelligent laughs.  Just know that everything happens in this flick for a reason.Recommended to fans of the TV series and the books, though I can't tell you how closely the flick follows the books.

638822,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JO28,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 9]","""Why are we here?"" is the constant question of existentialism that often nourishes further curiosity in regards the meaning of life and life's place in the universe.  Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (1983) touched this philosophical notion with a devastating amount of humor and parody.  The same question, in the light of humor, will be asked in the cinematic adaptation of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  What is more important, director Garth Jennings accomplishes in conveying a refreshing existential comedy that exploits human error, ineptness, and pride in a radically amusing parody.  This is also expressed in the opening where the audience learns that dolphins are far more intelligent that human beings.Heavy philosophical notions are blended into a diverging comic brew where both bellyaching and dry humor softens the audience's guard and makes them more receptive to the insightful hypotheses.  However, it is easy for an audience member to get lost within the absurdity of the film, but for those who allow themselves to reflectively drift along with the silly storyline will discover a cinematic gem.  Amusingly, Jennings adapts Adams' literary work that visualizes an intergalactic society that encompasses strange religions, corporate power, political bureaucracy, and scientific progress among many other aspects of the universe.The film opens a Thursday morning when the story's protagonist Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) discovers that the government has decided to build a bypass through his house.  The location for a bypass is outrageously comical in a cerebral way.  There are no other houses in miles, yet they want to tear down Arthur's house and build a bypass.  What Arthur does not know is that Earth is facing a similar fate, as the galactic government has decided to build an intergalactic freeway through Earth.  Luckily, Arthur's friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) has discovered Earths apocalyptic destiny, as he reveals for Arthur that he is an alien (not the kind from foreign soil) and he can save them both.  Ford's visit to Earth was one in countless celestial visits through the galaxy, as he is currently working on a guide for intergalactic hitchhikers.What do you do when you only have 12 minutes left to exist on Earth?  Ford takes Arthur to the pub where they slam 3 pints of beer while he explains the situation for a slightly perplexed Arthur.  It is an incredible tale, a tale most humans would disregard, as ignorance sometimes is bliss.  However, what is to come after these 12 minutes will baffle Arthur even more when a spaceship materializes in the sky.  In disbelief, Arthur exclaims, ""What the hell are those things?""  This scene, despite its amusing approach, presents an impression that awareness can shake the very foundation of personal wisdom.Through a thumb ring, far beyond the technological advances on Earth, Ford and Arthur hitch a ride with a spaceship.  It brings them on a fantastic journey through space, dimensions, and metamorphosis, as they encounter the Intergalactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) who has kidnapped himself, the adventurous woman Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), and the robot Marvin (body performed by Warwick Davis and the voice of Alan Rickman) who suffers from clinical depression as a consequence of his human like personality programming.  Together these five venture through space on board the starship, whose name has some witty symbolic connotations, Heart of Gold, as they seek the ultimate answer to all.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy employs playful mise-en-scene that brings Star Trek and other science fiction films, which help create an alien atmosphere.  Together with clever camera framing there are terrific performances by several actors such as Martin Freeman, Mos Def, Sam Rockwell, Zooey Deschanel, Warwick Davis, Alan Rickman, John Malkowich, Helen Mirren among many others.  The script was initiated by Douglas Adams and later finished by Karey Kirkpatrick after Adams' death, which Jennings gave terrific adaptation.  An adaptation that at first look emerges like a light comedy, but offers something much more profound for a more reflective audience.Visual tidbits, fragments, and other remnants of ideas begin to wander aimlessly from the opening scene until the end in the film . Within these diverging ideas the storyline follows a rather straight pattern, which generates additional comic nonsense.  The chaotic presentation of the many concepts brings different notions to light.  The idea is that life emerges out of chaos. After all, this is true if the audience considers the big bang, or evolution theory, where life surfaced through chaos.  Jennings creates an atmosphere of chaos that converge in a reflective state of mind the way a bouquet of wild flowers creates a pattern.  In this potpourri of ideas the audience will discover a truly intelligent comedy that hides underneath the surface of blockbuster vanity.",4,Truly Intelligent Comedy That Hides Underneath the Surface

The DVD is the usual standard thing, nothing special.  Not much on the additional scenes list, at least not enough to make up for anything ....the film ...Only Hollywood, with all its dumbing-down abilities, feels that despite enduring success in other genres, film is somehow unique.  Its special and the audience ... they need to be spoon-fed like babies.  Take a classic work of Literature like the Three Musketeers ... a story that has stood the test of centuries.  But, when it comes time to make a film of that story ... its not quite up to snuff ... at least not for Hollywood.  Enter the long battle for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.For nearly 20 years Douglas Adams fought and fought to get a film made of his tale that had been successful every other medium, but the film failed to materialize mostly because he refused to cave in and let them change it.  In the end, he passed away.  Pow!  Suddenly ... the movie gets made!  Why not, with their chief obstacle out of the way?As a fan of HHGTTG ... and I mean a real fan who knows that this was written for RADIO first ... I have to say that this was the biggest disappointment I've experienced in the last 10 years.  More than all the crappy Star Wars prequels and Star Trek spin-offs combined.  Bitter bitter bitter disappointment.  How can people who claim to be fans of Douglas Adams make this film?  And, more importantly, where is the humor?  Its meant to be funny, so why didn't I laugh?To know the history of this movie, its best to examine the history of the story from its beginnings.  Douglas Adams wrote this story to be ""heard"" as a radio show for the BBC.  It was then made into a series of successful novels and a TV show.  Now, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that what is spoken is most important.  Fans of the novels often claim (very mistakenly) that the dialogue is fluff.  How wrong you are.  The entire story is dialogue, if not from the characters than from the ""book"" (the HHGTTG) itself.The positives of this movie are simple.  Stephen Fry is perfectly cast as the voice of the book, thus at least making an attempt at retaining some of Douglas Adam's original spirit.  Without the voice of the book, this would not have succeeded on even the minimal levels that it does.  However, much of the funniest stuff is cut and therefore, we get merely a taste of what was the best idea of all.The casting is something of a nightmare.  While Martin Freeman might seem like a perfect choice, he is horribly miscast as a ""likable"" Arthur Dent, while Mos Def the wholly controversial choice for Ford Prefect does come off a bit better (despite his dialogue being the most neutered.)  Sam Rockwell seemed like the perfect choice and his ""look"" when unveiled before the movie opened seemed inspired, but the script and his ""GW"" version of Beeblebrox reduces what is potentially one of the funniest and charismatic characters in previous incarnations into a crass, moronic, screaming cauldron of irritation.  Zooey Deschanel takes on the thankless role of Trillian (now beefed up to a full ""romantic"" lead) into the slightly unbelievable combo of ditsy genius.However, add to this mess one irritating obstacle of a sub-plot (that eats away at the entire story of the film), cut out as many jokes as possible, rush through character scenes to show some zippy special effects, a few Jim Hensen Vogons with voices provided by The League of Gentlemen (Mark Gatiss must have some blackmail material on all these Doctor Who/Hitchhikers people as he seems to turn up all the time) so over drenched in sound effects that you can't understand them ... and what do you get?  A huge, horrible mess.  Oh, and make sure you claim that the now deceased writer would have wanted it this way.  That always helps break the suckers.In short, they turned a piece of ""art"" into light family entertainment.  To those who say ""Hey, its only a movie"" or ""The die-hard nerds won't like it,"" I say ...

It is named after, and primarily based on, the first book ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"". I deliberately did not select ""science fiction"" as a ""Tag"" because it is not the type of movie that most people would associate with ""science fiction"", unless you think ""Spaceballs"" fits in that category. While ""Spaceballs"" is a spoof on ""Star Wars"" This movie is more a spoof on life in general. Where ""Spaceballs"" is just plan silly ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" has bits of social commentary with a heavy dose of silly.The main difference between the books and the movie is that the movies has a plot. The books don't really need a plot but I can see the need for one in a movie. I think they did a fine job adapting the books for the big screen while being faithful to the authors talents and, yes, his genius. Here you will find the answer to the ultimate question, the answer to the meaning of life and everything. You will need to watch the movie for the answer (sorry about that) but, once you know the answer, the real question is: What ""exactly"" is the question?You don't really need to read the books before watching the movie, however, you might miss the intent of a few of the comic bits if you haven't read them.

638831,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JO28,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","Of course the first thing I think when I hear ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" are the words ""DON'T PANIC!""  But the second thing I think is ""So long and thanks for all the fish!""  So when the long awaited theatrical version of the Douglas Adams comedic romp through the galaxy starts off with the dolphins singing ""So long and thanks for all the fish!"" that was a good thing.  Indeed, this movie is filled with good things, helped no doubt by the fact that Adams has a screenplay credit along with Karey Kirkpatrick (""Chicken Run"").  But your ability to enjoy this 2005 film might be related directly to how well you know the source material.  I was reminded of watching the original theatrical version of ""Dune,"" and how the rich details for Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel came rushing back to help me fill in the gaps of David Lynch's film.  However, ultimately I think of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" as being what I call as ""cat juggling"" movie.  You might remember Steven Marin used to talk in his standup routine about engaging in cat juggling.  Makes for a funny picture in your mind, right?  Well, in ""The Jerk"" they tried to fake cat juggling (this was before the era of wall-to-wall CGI), and it was nowhere as funny.  That would be the case here.The story is simple.  Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is distraught over the destruction of his home to make way for a new highway bypass when his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) announces that such earthly concerns are moot because the entire planet is about to be destroyed to make way for an intergalactic freeway (ironic, huh?).  Fortunately Ford is able to hitch a ride on one of the Zogon vessels that is part of the interstellar road crew.  Eventually the duo hook up on an insane quest by the President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), the most two-face politician you have ever seen.  Along for the fun are Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), the last surviving Earth woman, and Marvin (voice of Alan Rickman but body of Warwick Davis), a robot whose first impulse is always to complain.  Stephen Fry is the narrator, and he gets the choice duty of explaining all of the various entries in the ""Guide"" and whatever other asides are tossed into the film.  These continue through the end credits of the film and are definitely the part of this film that best captures the Adams sense of whimsy.Except for Rockwell, who is trying way too hard, the casting is spot on, as is the decision to Jim Henson's Creature Shop do most of the aliens, because they make rubber suits fun again.  The big irony here ends up being that the most interesting parts of the movie actually end up being the new stuff that Adams put into the script before his death.  That would be the character of Humma Kavula (John Malkovich) and the suggested romance between Arthur and Trillian.  Is the former a pointed bit of satire of Adams's part and the latter merely acquiescence to Hollywood's lowest common denominator principle, or are there more substantial things to be found here?  The bottom line is that ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is an enjoyable enough diversion, unlikely to becoming a cinematic series, and probably not a profound disappointment to Adams's legion of fans. Those of you who have never cracked one of those books will feel like you are being taken for a ride, but then since that is what is happening to Arthur Dent, you will at least have a character to identify with as you plunge down the great rabbit hole of the galaxy.",4,Just remember: DON'T PANIC!

638841,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JO28,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 4]","When the initial negative reviews of this movie came out I generally ignored them because I frequently disagree with so-called professional reviewers regarding science fiction and fantasy movies.  At last I bought the DVD and eagerly watched the opening credits.We meet Arthur Dent, a kooky everyman whose house is about to be torn down to make way for a highway.  Before Arthur's house can be demolished, his friend Ford Prefect arrives and grabs him, bathrobe and all, and takes him to the local pub for a drink.  Ford advises him that in about 10 minutes or so the planet will be destroyed.  After a bit of kooky antics in the pub, Ford and Arthur run back to Arthur's house, which has just been destroyed by the highway construction crew.  Arthur sets off into another frenzy just when alien spaceships appear overhead, apparently ready to destroy the earth.  Fortunately for Arthur, Ford is able to grab a ride on one of the spaceships.  Ford and Arthur then gallivant about the galaxy, encountering all sorts of interesting and bizarre characters who are on missions of their own.This movie suffers from a near-fatal flaw.  The flaw is that the movie will have the most meaning to those people who have read one or more of Douglas Adams' books.  Most other people will likely find the movie either tedious or obscure.  I have read all of the books in the series and there are portions of this movie that I enjoy immensely.  Since the movie relies much on knowledge of the books to understand many of the jokes, I find it impossible to consider the movie without the books.  When I consider the relationship of the movie to the book, my answer (other than ""42"" - see the movie or read the books for that one) is that the movie tries very hard to capture the spirit of the books, occasionally succeeds, and fails nearly as often.I really did want to like this movie.  There are parts where I laughed really hard.  Unfortunately, in other parts I thought the movie missed capturing Douglas Adams' intent.  My conclusion is that most people who have not read any of Douglas Adams' books, people who do not like British humor in general (for example, Monty Python), and those who are not fanatical about science fiction will not like this movie.  Everyone else will have about a fifty-fifty chance of liking it at least a little.One thing about the DVD that intrigued me is the menu.  I am unable to explain what I mean about that, so you need to rent, borrow or buy the DVD and check out how the menu works.

And the question is, I believe, this: ""If I were being really, REALLY, and I mean totally, generous, what score would I give this movie out of 100?""Sorry, but this movie should perhaps be retitled ""How To Lose Fans and Ruin A Masterpiece"". Folks, if you're thinking of watching this movie, you're going to need at least three super-strong pangalactic gargleblasters and a seriously large towel. Or, if you're an alien, you could try removing your babel fish from your ear so you don't understand the earth dialogue, and then adding in dialogue of your own, to make it more amusing. Alternately -- and this is what I would firmly suggest -- you could simply grab a copy of the old British series of Hitchhiker's, and watch that instead, since it is about a billion times funnier and more coherent than this crappy version.Okay, I would love to know which 'genius' is to blame for a) turning Ford Prefect from being a cool, insightful, funny guy into a bumbling, mumbling, very minor support character, b) turning the Hitchhiker's storyline from being a hilarious and irreverent mockery of conventiality into a silly run-of-the-mill romance movie, c) deciding that instead of letting Zaphod Beeblebrox be the ultra-hip, cool, egocentric yet interesting guy he's supposed to be, they would make him a sociopathic, dull, useless klutz of a president with all the charisma and charm of a stinky old pickled herring, who is also an identical doppelganger of Chad Kroeger from Nickelback, albeit without Chad's personality, talent and likeable voice, and d) giving the story a moral, like an after school special, and making Arthur Dent 'learn his lesson' and become more brave and adventurous in order to win the girl. (Arthur is, I believe, symbolic of the average, very ordinary man in the street, hence why we ordinary folk empathise with him. Thus, making him any more than average, and having him evolving into a sickeningly noble hero, kind of detracts from that, and turns him into just another stock movie character.)All in all, this movie was poorly executed and did little justice to the original book's plot.If I had to say something good about this movie, it would be this: the song 'So Long and Thanks For All The Fish' is really good, as is the original theme music. Also, Stephen Fry is charming. I liked the 'point of view gun' too. And it's nice to see a few of the cast members from the original version of Hitchhiker's making a (sadly brief) appearance.

But in a twist of irony, no sooner is his house gone then the Vogon's arrive with plans to destroy the entire planet.  He only escapes because his friend, Ford Perfect, is really an alien.Improbably, they make their way to the Heart of Gold, a new ship that has been stolen by Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the galaxy.  Also on board are Trillian, the last surviving human woman; Marvin, and manic-depressive robot; and the ship's always-cheerful computer.  Together, they set out to find the ultimate question to the universe.  The answer being, of course, 42.While I've read the first book, I've not gotten to the rest of the five-book trilogy, so come at this with only slight knowledge of Douglas Adams' work.  As such, all I can say is I loved the movie.  It remains true to the spirit of the books if not each individual page.  The puns and gags came quickly, especially near the end.  And anytime Marvin or the ship's computer say anything, it is sure to be funny.  Since no two versions of the story can be the same, there have been changes made from the original.  My favorite is the Point of View Gun.  Having an outside narrator read us entries from the Guide is genius.  It helps explain the action and it allows some of the wonderfully funny sections from the book to make it into the film.The plot of this movie is rather weak.  While there is a story, it's admittedly not the best.  It worked well for the book, but making it work for the movie was part of what took so long getting this to the screen.  Still, I will admit to liking this ending more then the original and it seems stronger then my memory of the plot in the book.  The plot serves merely as a staging area for the humor.  This works as I laughed out loud the entire way through and I normally don't enjoy British humor.The DVD is what you would expect but nothing special.  The movie looked fine on my TV, and the surround sound was nice.  There's a brief making of featurette and three deleted scenes, two of which deserved to be in the movie.  There are also two separate audio commentaries.  The ""fake deleted scenes"" are rather stupid, however, as they are joke takes on two scenes, neither especially funny.  I was especially disappointed not to find the trailers on the disc.  This movie had some hilarious ones, and I want them.This movie has a limited audience to be sure, but its audience will love it.

So instead, the film takes the easy way out by attempting to load the gags in as often as possible . . . which is fine as far it goes.

Douglas Adams certainly knew how to WRITE comedy, and all the written incarnations of ""Hitchhiker's"" are among the most hilarious passages of the English language.This film, based on that brilliant writing, is like one of the world's greatest jokes, mucked up in the telling.""Hitchhiker's"" is NOT about story, and it is most certainly not about a love story.  It's about attitude and a wry observation about how brainless much of the world is.  This movie doesn't match the spirit of Adams' writing with two notable exceptions: Sam Rockwell ""gets it"" with his performance as 2-Headed, 3-armed President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox.  Zaphod is the kind of character perpetually in search of his next great party. It seems that the primary benefit to being President of the Galaxy is giving him a great line to pick up girls.  Bill Nighy also captures the right Adams spirit as Slartibartfast, a name you don't want to say three times fast. I give one star each for Sam and Bill.Much of the humor of the book(s) come from asides and lines that are rendered for the benefit of the audience.  Hero Arthur Dent learns the same morning first that his house is being demolished so that a bypass can be built, then that the earth is being destroyed by a Vogon Constructor Fleet so that an inter-galactic bypass can also be constructed.  His friend Ford Prefect (unknown to Arthur an alien from the planet Betelgeuse) hurries Arthur off to a pub and begins explaining about how the earth is about to be destroyed.Chapter Two ends:""This must be Thursday,"" said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low over his beer, ""I never could get the hang of Thursdays.""In this film Arthur neither muses nor sinks and the cleverness of Adams fine and hilarious prose gets passed by quickly - as if the Mona Lisa were displayed beside the tracks of a speeding train, and the only glimpse you could get of it was as the train sped you past it.Douglas Adams' words have ALWAYS been the ""star"" of Hitchhikers.  That and the attitude I mentioned before could have been transformed into a serviceable film.  No doubt at the urging of some Hollywood type, a love story that doesn't exist in any prior incarnation of the written word shows up in this movie and stops any momentum that might have been building dead in its tracks.Marvin the Robot, one of the most memorable non-human characters in literary history, is given the voice of Alan Rickman, but the body of a walking trash can.  Three decades after C3PO first appeared, it is inexcusable to botch Marvin the Paranoid Android.This movie is hilarious and entertaining in a way that is not at all hilarious or entertaining.*sigh* Now I don't know whether to look forward to ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" or not.",2,Imperfect Film Rendition of Adams' Perfect Comedy,1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,2965,"['Do', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'absolutely', 'can', 'NOT', 'tell', 'joke', ""'re"", 'person', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'most', 'perfectly', 'hilarious', 'joke', 'world', 'will', 'mangle', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'comedy', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'certainly', 'knew', 'how', 'WRITE', 'comedy', 'written', 'incarnations', 'Hitchhiker', 'are', 'most', 'hilarious', 'passages', 'English', 'language.This', 'film', 'based', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'jokes', 'mucked', 'up', 'telling', 'Hitchhiker', 'NOT', 'story', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'attitude', 'wry', 'observation', 'how', 'brainless', 'much', 'world', 'movie', ""n't"", 'match', 'spirit', 'Adams', 'writing', 'two', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'performance', '2-Headed', '3-armed', 'President', 'Galaxy', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'Zaphod', 'kind', 'character', 'perpetually', 'search', 'next', 'great', 'party', 'primary', 'benefit', 'being', 'President', 'Galaxy', 'giving', 'great', 'line', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'also', 'right', 'Adams', 'spirit', 'Slartibartfast', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'three', 'times', 'fast', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'Sam', 'Bill.Much', 'humor', 'book', 'come', 'asides', 'lines', 'are', 'rendered', 'benefit', 'audience', 'Hero', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'same', 'morning', 'first', 'house', 'being', 'demolished', 'so', 'bypass', 'can', 'be', 'built', 'then', 'earth', 'being', 'destroyed', 'Vogon', 'Constructor', 'Fleet', 'inter-galactic', 'bypass', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'constructed', 'friend', 'Ford', 'Prefect', 'unknown', 'Arthur', 'alien', 'planet', 'Betelgeuse', 'hurries', 'Arthur', 'pub', 'explaining', 'how', 'earth', 'be', 'destroyed.Chapter', 'Two', 'ends', 'must', 'be', 'Thursday', 'said', 'Arthur', 'musing', 'sinking', 'low', 'beer', 'never', 'could', 'get', 'hang', 'Thursdays', 'film', 'Arthur', 'muses', 'sinks', 'cleverness', 'Adams', 'fine', 'hilarious', 'prose', 'passed', 'quickly', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'were', 'displayed', 'tracks', 'speeding', 'train', 'only', 'glimpse', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'train', 'sped', 'it.Douglas', 'Adams', 'words', 'have', 'ALWAYS', 'been', 'star', 'Hitchhikers', 'attitude', 'mentioned', 'before', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'transformed', 'serviceable', 'film', 'doubt', 'urging', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'exist', 'prior', 'incarnation', 'written', 'word', 'up', 'movie', 'momentum', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'building', 'dead', 'tracks.Marvin', 'Robot', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'non-human', 'characters', 'literary', 'history', 'given', 'voice', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'body', 'walking', 'trash', 'can', 'Three', 'decades', 'C3PO', 'first', 'appeared', 'inexcusable', 'botch', 'Marvin', 'Paranoid', 'Android.This', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'entertaining', 'way', 'not', 'hilarious', 'entertaining', '*sigh*', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'look', 'forward', 'Restaurant', 'End', 'Universe', 'not']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

And how random is that?The book was one of the first I read that had the edgy, random quality which has become more prevalent in contemporary fiction. Space ships, galaxies, worlds constructed by large companies, petty government officials, petty ALIEN government officials all play their role.Like the book, however, the movie also has not so much a story arc as a story serpentine, or story boomerang.While the random style of writing may be difficult to achieve, randomness is easier in film. Editing tools for film are better. Also, the way to randomness has been paved by the makers of music videos.People of my generation seem to want to make order out of chaos. However, chaos is what we have. And, one should at least consider watching something like the world one has than about the world one would like.Adams is, I think, a pioneer of this random style.The book is very difficult to put down, once you start reading. The movie is also difficult to pause or turn off. Like the book is entirely unpredictable. Yet the production values are pretty good, the acting is engaging, and the special effects, while uneven, work well enough to keep the film moving.Now, what is the probability of the film and the book becoming the best-sellers they became?

This made a lot of people angry and has widely been considered as a bad move.""The same could be said for the latest adaptation of Douglas Adams' cult classic, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" ""Hitchhiker"" is a film that will likely provoke one of two responses: delight or disdain, depending on whether one is engaged with the material and its presentation. It depends much on the comic traditions of P.G. Wodehouse and Monty Python, and if the viewer is not prepared for utter absurdity and plot twists that boggle the mind and stretch the limits of sanity, it is a film that will fail miserably.But, in Douglas Adams' immortal words, Don't Panic! Because if one is prepared to accept all the wacky creatures and absurd plot and side-trips into the bizarre, ""Hitchhiker"" is an extremely enjoyable and refreshing comedy. After all, how many films begin with an elegantly choreographed musical number featuring dolphins bidding the Earth farewell and thanking us ""for all the fish""?Of course, not all is fish and fun. Arthur Dent, a ""five-foot-eight ape descendant"" who is very, very British, has a house which is about to be demolished to build a bypass. Little does he realize that his fate is soon to be mirrored by the Earth's, which will be destroyed to make way for an intergalactic expressway. Fortunately for Arthur, his best friend Ford is actually an alien, and manages to whisk him away via a hitch-hiking tool just before the Earth is demolished by Vogons, a nasty race of small-minded commercialist aliens who are sticklers for procedure.And so the mania begins. An understanding of the general plot is hardly necessary (at times it doesn't seem to understand itself), but much of it revolves around the search for the legendary planet of Magrithea, where a mythical computer Deep Thought supposedly holds the answer to ""Life, the Universe, and Everything."" Unfortunately, the philosophers who built Deep Thought forgot to ask what the question was, and so the answer of ""42"" means very little.Along the way Ford and Arthur encounter the likes of Zaphod Beeblebrox, the dual-headed President of the Galaxy who may or may not have ulterior motives, depending on whether his heads can remember them; Humma Kavula (played with perfect creepiness by John Malkovich), the bizarre leader of a religious cult that worships - what else? - a giant nose; Slartibartfast (a deliciously droll Bill Nighy), who builds planets; and Marvin (voiced by a delightfully glum Alan Rickman), the perpetually depressed robot with a brain ""the size of a small planet."" There are a multiplicity of other alien creatures and strange worlds, many of which stretch the limits of logic, when not twisting it in pretzel knots.This can get quite confusing at times, and the film's complexities and in-jokes are far more enjoyable (and comprehensible) if one has at least some familiarity with Douglas Adams' work. However, even for those unfamiliar with the ""Hitchhiker"" world, the film can be very funny, thanks largely to the incorporation of explanatory material from the ""Guide"" right into the narrative. One of the film's strong points is the voiceover narration, taken from the ""Hitchhiker"" books themselves. These are generally hysterical in their deadpan sense of droll humour; amongst the best of these is one explaining the nature of Vogons, along with many ""entries"" from the ""Guide"" explaining various creatures encountered along the way.Ultimately, ""Hitchhiker"" is a great and wacky romp through the Galaxy, if one is prepared to abandon logic and the demand for sense and surrender to the flow of insanity. Don't expect from it the answer - or the question - to Life, the Universe, and Everything, but as a good-natured goofball movie, it's quite satisfying.",3,Delightfully Insane,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,3805,"['beginning', 'universe', 'was', 'created', 'made', 'lot', 'people', 'angry', 'widely', 'been', 'considered', 'bad', 'move', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'latest', 'adaptation', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'cult', 'classic', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'Hitchhiker', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'provoke', 'one', 'two', 'responses', 'delight', 'disdain', 'depending', 'one', 'engaged', 'material', 'presentation', 'much', 'comic', 'traditions', 'P.G', 'Wodehouse', 'Monty', 'Python', 'viewer', 'not', 'prepared', 'utter', 'absurdity', 'plot', 'twists', 'boggle', 'mind', 'stretch', 'limits', 'sanity', 'film', 'will', 'fail', 'miserably.But', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'immortal', 'words', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Panic', 'one', 'prepared', 'accept', 'wacky', 'creatures', 'absurd', 'plot', 'side-trips', 'bizarre', 'Hitchhiker', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'refreshing', 'comedy', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'begin', 'elegantly', 'choreographed', 'musical', 'number', 'featuring', 'dolphins', 'bidding', 'Earth', 'farewell', 'thanking', 'fish', 'course', 'not', 'fish', 'fun', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'five-foot-eight', 'ape', 'descendant', 'who', 'very', 'very', 'British', 'house', 'be', 'demolished', 'build', 'bypass', 'Little', 'realize', 'fate', 'soon', 'be', 'mirrored', 'Earth', 'will', 'be', 'destroyed', 'make', 'way', 'intergalactic', 'expressway', 'Fortunately', 'Arthur', 'best', 'friend', 'Ford', 'actually', 'alien', 'whisk', 'away', 'hitch-hiking', 'tool', 'just', 'Earth', 'demolished', 'Vogons', 'nasty', 'race', 'small-minded', 'commercialist', 'aliens', 'who', 'are', 'sticklers', 'procedure.And', 'so', 'mania', 'understanding', 'general', 'plot', 'hardly', 'necessary', 'times', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'much', 'search', 'legendary', 'planet', 'Magrithea', 'where', 'mythical', 'computer', 'Deep', 'Thought', 'supposedly', 'answer', 'Life', 'Universe', 'Everything', 'Unfortunately', 'philosophers', 'who', 'built', 'Deep', 'Thought', 'forgot', 'ask', 'what', 'question', 'was', 'so', 'answer', '42', 'very', 'little.Along', 'way', 'Ford', 'Arthur', 'encounter', 'likes', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'dual-headed', 'President', 'Galaxy', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'depending', 'heads', 'can', 'remember', 'Humma', 'Kavula', 'played', 'perfect', 'creepiness', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'bizarre', 'leader', 'religious', 'cult', 'what', 'else', 'giant', 'nose', 'Slartibartfast', 'deliciously', 'droll', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'who', 'planets', 'Marvin', 'voiced', 'delightfully', 'glum', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'perpetually', 'depressed', 'robot', 'brain', 'size', 'small', 'planet', 'are', 'multiplicity', 'other', 'alien', 'creatures', 'strange', 'worlds', 'many', 'stretch', 'limits', 'logic', 'when', 'not', 'twisting', 'pretzel', 'knots.This', 'can', 'get', 'quite', 'confusing', 'times', 'film', 'complexities', 'in-jokes', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'comprehensible', 'one', 'least', 'familiarity', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'work', 'However', 'even', 'unfamiliar', 'Hitchhiker', 'world', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'thanks', 'largely', 'incorporation', 'explanatory', 'material', 'Guide', 'right', 'narrative', 'One', 'film', 'strong', 'points', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'taken', 'Hitchhiker', 'books', 'are', 'generally', 'hysterical', 'deadpan', 'sense', 'droll', 'humour', 'best', 'one', 'explaining', 'nature', 'Vogons', 'many', 'entries', 'Guide', 'explaining', 'various', 'creatures', 'encountered', 'way.Ultimately', 'Hitchhiker', 'great', 'wacky', 'romp', 'Galaxy', 'one', 'prepared', 'abandon', 'logic', 'demand', 'sense', 'surrender', 'flow', 'insanity', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'answer', 'question', 'Life', 'Universe', 'Everything', 'good-natured', 'goofball', 'movie', 'quite', 'satisfying']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

While deviating from the source material, the screenplay was co-written by Douglas Adams himself, and a lot of the dialogue is lifted from the novels.  The story has existed in different versions before as well, so the changes are nothing to throw the fans off.Martin Freeman is the perfect Arthur, an ordinary everyman.  Mos Def nails Ford Prefect almost perfectly.  Sam Rockwell is over the top annoying at times as Zaphod.  And there is no one more perfectly suited to give voice to Marvin than the great Alan Rickman.  Marvin steals just about every scene he is in.That being said, this movie is more for fans of the novels than the average moviegoer.

638861,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JO28,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 6]","The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the current film released in theaters and the franchise on which it is based, has had a lengthy and colorful history to say the least. The franchise was originally spawned as a simple radio program on the BBC radio network in 1978 and became such a hit that the show's creator, Douglas Adam, adapted into a series of successful novels, the first being called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Four more books followed in the wake of its popularity along with a text-based adventure computer game and a television series which appeared on the BBC network in 1981. Douglas Adams spent nearly twenty years of his life attempting to convince studio executives across California to adapt his off-beat series into a feature film presentation but sadly he died of a heart attack in 2001 before baring witness to its production in 2004.The story for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy lacks the essential elements which would make it a coherent and meaningful motion picture experience for those beyond the close knit realm of the book series' cult followers. The script is entirely devoid of the components of suspense and excitement, especially in the sequence in which Trillian is captured and nearly killed by the Vogons. In fact the entire alien species of the Vogons lack the particular qualities which would make them intimidating villains while at the same time sticking them with an increasingly incommodious running gag which prevents them from being categorized them as either misunderstood or harmless. The catalyst behind the movie's script which is the exploration in search of the ultimate question to the ultimate answer comes up empty-handed. What does the number forty-two have to do with anything remotely associated with the meaning of life and the universe? Too many questions are created in the wake of the film expedition throughout the galaxy that it makes you wonder whether it was worth questioning to begin with.Martin Freeman, known more amongst the citizens of the British Isles then in the States, performs admirably in the role of Arthur Dent, a man who on the worst day of his life has his house bulldozed, his best friend reveal to him that he is an alien from another planet, and has his home planet obliterated. The chemistry which exists through his interactions with the rest of the cast, particularly with his love interest, Zooey Deschanel, makes his performance all the more laudable. Speaking of Zooey Deschanel, the aspiring actress fits perfectly as Trillian, the love interest of the film's hero, Arthur Dent, demonstrating true spank and tenacity in the role that stands out from the typical ""damsel-in-distress"" clich&eacute;. Sam Rockwell certainly has his moments in the bizarre role of Zaphod Beeblebrox, president of the galaxy, but as the film progresses his peculiar antics grow increasingly eccentric and become downright annoying once the credits start rolling. And though not contribute to Rockwell's particular take on the character, there are several open ended questions left concerning Beeblebrox himself. What was he doing on Earth, a planet he signed off to be demolished, when he picked up Trillian in the first place? Why is he searching for the ultimate question? What is his true motivation behind all of this? True, comments addressing some of these specific issues are made within the film but they are as simple as to be written off quickly without so much as a second thought by the screenwriters. John Malkovich is decent in the role of Humma Kavula, Zaphod Beeblebrox's former opponent in the campaign for the presidency of the galaxy and priest of a religious organization which believes all life in the universe was formed from the sneeze of a deistic being. But even this assessment may not be particularly accurate as it is quite difficult to determine the value of a performance when the character appears in only one scene in the film, relatively near the middle of the picture, and is not seen for the rest of the movie.Overall, sadly audiences will be forced to scrap those vacation plans to explore the universe this summer as they will need a guide of their own just to grasp one bit of material from the complex and ultimately bewildering Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The special effects of the film, the most easily identifiable flaw in the production, were at best mediocre, unnervingly artificial at worst. Every scene in which Rockwell switches between his normal appearance and his second head is just excruciating. It is easily noticeable how simulated his head is and the voice-over work lacks the edge and persona Rockwell normally provides to the role. The glaringly awful computer-animated crabs were unnecessary and should never have been included into the film. Unfortunately unless you happen to be quite familiar with the book series on which this film was based, written by the late-Douglas Adams, you will be scratching your head raw throughout the entire picture. Those unlucky enough to have been in on the galactic humor this film presents will face an onslaught of queries which will only continue to multiply as the picture progresses toward its clich&eacute;d and too neatly wrapped conclusion. So that is how it ends? Everything returns to normal as if nothing had ever happened to begin with and everyone moves on with their so-called lives never giving it a second thought as to what this means about life? The entire concept of planets being manufactured as if they were houses and copies into storage and human beings easily recopied as if they were mere computer programs is tremendously depressing when considering the concepts of life and our purpose within this universe. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy leaves plenty of other questions which the audience will surely address upon exiting the movie theater. What was up with the dolphins at the beginning of the film? The superiority of their intelligence aside for a moment, why were they able to fly into outer space? What was with the concept of mice conducting research on human beings? Why did the two ""wise children"" from that one planet turn themselves into mice? Why were they unable, or unwilling, to alter themselves back to their original forms when they needed Arthur's brain? Why Arthur's? Why did the two children mysteriously vanish into thin air as soon as they were squashed? What happened to their home planet which caused it to be in such disarray and abandonment? These are merely a small sampling of the extensive list of questions produced from this disappointing and lackluster science-fiction comedy.",3,"The Moose Hole - Don't Panic ...

After being dumped into space, Freeman and Def hitchhike on the ship of the President Of The Universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox, a hilarious Sam Rockwell (Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, Safe Men) who seems to be having fun with the part too much and also on the ship is Trillian, played by Zooey Deschanel(Almost Famous, The New Guy).

638864,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JO28,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","This long-awaited ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" feature film follows the story's incarnations as a BBC radio serial, five novels, stage shows, a television series, and a computer game, so expectations are high. Persistent questions as to whether Douglas Adams comic sci-fi universe is too off-beat, too complicated, or simply too silly for a major motion picture may have kept the film industry at bay for decades. Now director Garth Jennings has brought ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" to the big screen in all of its hokiness, ironic humor, and good natured fun. Fans of previous versions of  ""The Guide"" will find some surprises. Douglas Adams worked on this screenplay until  his death in 2001, and he, Garth Jennings, and co-screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick introduce some new characters and plot elements in the movie.Englishman Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) wakes one morning to discover a wrecking crew prepared to demolish his house to make way for a bypass. To make matter worse, his friend Ford (Mos Def) shows little concern, insisting instead that he is an alien and that the world will end in 10 minutes anyway. For better or worse, this turns out to be true. To escape Earth's destruction, the 2 men are forced to hitch a ride aboard the nearest spacecraft, a Vogon Constructor ship, where they are hardly welcome, and from which they are soon ejected, literally.  By fantastic coincidence, another ship, the Heart of Gold, recently stolen by the Galaxy's eccentric and probably daft President Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) picks them up. Arthur discovers a woman he had quite a crush on, Tricia ""Trillian"" McMillan (Zooey Deschanel), already on board, along with a depressive robot named Marvin (body Warwick Davis, voice Alan Rickman), and the errant President.  Pursued by the Vogons and propelled by the ship's Improbability Drive, this motley crew flit about the galaxy in search of the Ultimate Question.""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" opens with a musical number performed by dolphins to the song ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"". It's funny and charming, and establishes the film's tone and sense of humor right off the bat. In fact, I think the film's first act, up until the point Arthur and Ford evacuate Earth, is its best. Stephen Fry narrates and provides the voice of the Guide -the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" that is, a kind of galactic encyclopedia for which Ford writes. The visuals for the guide are simple, universal illustrations set to ironic narration. Director Garth Jennings made a wise decision not to overload the film with digital imagery. The Vogons are puppets and people in suits, not CGI.  A lot of attention has been paid to production design, which owes something to the hokiness of Dr. Who, another sci-fi comedy where laughable props work well. John Malkovich and Bill Nighy contribute nice supporting performances as Zaphod's rival in the Presidential election, Humma Kavula, and a planet architect, Slartibartfast, respectively. I don't think the film will disappoint Douglas Adams' fans, because it is true to the tone of the book, the cast is great, and changing the story with every writing is a ""Guide"" tradition.The DVD (Buena Vista 2005): Bonus features include a couple of featurettes, some material left out of the film, a game, and 2 audio commentaries. ""Making of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" (9 minutes) features interviews with director, cast, and producer Nick Goldsmith, in which they discuss the concepts in the film. There is an ""Additional Guide Entry"" (1 minute) about the existence of God. There are 3 deleted scenes and 2 ""Really Deleted Scenes"", which are spoofs. A Sing Along for ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" (2  minutes) replays the film's opening dolphin sequence with lyrics. ""Marvin's Hangman"" is an interactive word game which substitutes robot deconstruction for the traditional hangman.  The first audio commentary by director Garth Jennings, producer Nick Goldsmith, and actors Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy is friendly and entertaining. The men converse about cast, cuts, costumes, filming anecdotes, actors, effects, and a wide variety of details.

638871,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,B00005JO28,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[3, 4]","When I had first heard about the new movie ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", I have to admit to entertaining some misgivings about them being able to get the book into a feature length movie of a reasonable length. Having seen the original series from television many times, my misgivings were deep. I saw the movie and was very pleasantly surprised that they had covered the book very well, and the movie was as good as the series.While the movie kept much of the humour and the character of the original series, I was pleased with the innovations of the prop designs. The new-look Marvin, (very round), was excellent, and looked very good. The new look Guide, which was a electronic book that opened and closed like a coventional book was also a nice touch. Zafod Beeblebrox's stolen ship was also nice, being totally round, like Marvin's head. With the technological advances over the last decade or so, it goes without saying that the effects were stunning. Despite these little changes, the movie retains the ""feel"" of the series and the book. You might notice that the old Marvin shows up as an extra bit of prop in the background, as well, though only briefly and only his head.Martin Freeman was an excellent choice and carries the almost ironically normal Arthur Dent well. His ablility to act boringly normal in the most extraordinary situations brings out the contrast that Arthur Dent is. Mos Def is an excellent counter point as Ford Prefect, though there was not so much emphasis on why Prefect was on Earth in the first place, (though it does come up in a conversation, it is not talked about with Dent which was a funny point in the TV series). Sam Rockwell was sheer delight as the zany and oftimes ""stupid"" Zaphod Beeblebrox. Giving him shots of lemon from a ""thinking hat"" was a great idea, and Rockwell was very funny indeed. Lastly, on the topic of the cast, I would like to mention Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast. He was another excellent choice, and carried the friendly planet designer very well. Nighy was endearing and suited well to that role.The plot of the movie had all the major elements of the book and the series, with only some ommissions from the original plot and some cosmetic changes in the details, (such as Deep Thought's calculation period being extended to 7,500,000 years). Despite these somewhat paltry changes, the movie conveys the story well and with flair. The added narations, (Steven Fry), were excellent and also covered most of the points from the book. The whale scene was as excellent as always, as well as the Guide's discussion on Creation and how everyone seemed to be a little put out by it.From anyone who has grown up loving the book and the television series to those who are being introduced to Douglas Adams' classic for the first time, this movie is a treat and will not disappoint. I have read the books through and seen the television series completely about 3 times, and I found the movie to be a totally excellent experience. This is a great movie to introduce a whole new generation of Hitchhikers to what is a comic classic in science-fiction. I loved it and hope that they make a sequel to this.",5,Pleasantly Surprising,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,3170,"['When', 'had', 'first', 'heard', 'new', 'movie', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'have', 'admit', 'entertaining', 'misgivings', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'book', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'reasonable', 'length', 'Having', 'seen', 'original', 'series', 'television', 'many', 'times', 'misgivings', 'were', 'deep', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'had', 'covered', 'book', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'series.While', 'movie', 'kept', 'much', 'humour', 'character', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'pleased', 'innovations', 'prop', 'designs', 'new-look', 'Marvin', 'very', 'round', 'was', 'excellent', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'new', 'look', 'Guide', 'was', 'electronic', 'book', 'opened', 'closed', 'coventional', 'book', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'touch', 'Zafod', 'Beeblebrox', 'stolen', 'ship', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'being', 'totally', 'round', 'Marvin', 'head', 'technological', 'advances', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'saying', 'effects', 'were', 'stunning', 'little', 'changes', 'movie', 'feel', 'series', 'book', 'might', 'notice', 'old', 'Marvin', 'up', 'extra', 'bit', 'prop', 'background', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'briefly', 'only', 'head.Martin', 'Freeman', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'almost', 'ironically', 'normal', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'well', 'ablility', 'act', 'boringly', 'normal', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'situations', 'out', 'contrast', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'Mos', 'Def', 'excellent', 'counter', 'point', 'Ford', 'Prefect', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'why', 'Prefect', 'was', 'Earth', 'first', 'place', 'come', 'up', 'conversation', 'not', 'talked', 'Dent', 'was', 'funny', 'point', 'TV', 'series', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'was', 'sheer', 'delight', 'zany', 'stupid', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'Giving', 'shots', 'lemon', 'thinking', 'hat', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'Rockwell', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'indeed', 'Lastly', 'topic', 'cast', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Slartibartfast', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'carried', 'friendly', 'planet', 'designer', 'very', 'well', 'Nighy', 'was', 'endearing', 'suited', 'well', 'role.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'had', 'major', 'elements', 'book', 'series', 'only', 'ommissions', 'original', 'plot', 'cosmetic', 'changes', 'details', 'such', 'Deep', 'Thought', 'calculation', 'period', 'being', 'extended', '7,500,000', 'years', 'somewhat', 'paltry', 'changes', 'movie', 'story', 'well', 'flair', 'added', 'narations', 'Steven', 'Fry', 'were', 'excellent', 'also', 'covered', 'most', 'points', 'book', 'whale', 'scene', 'was', 'as', 'excellent', 'always', 'as', 'well', 'Guide', 'discussion', 'Creation', 'how', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'put', 'out', 'it.From', 'anyone', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'loving', 'book', 'television', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'introduced', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'classic', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'treat', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'seen', 'television', 'series', 'completely', '3', 'times', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'totally', 'excellent', 'experience', 'great', 'movie', 'introduce', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'Hitchhikers', 'what', 'comic', 'classic', 'science-fiction', 'loved', 'hope', 'make', 'sequel']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

638873,AB7W3IO5V7CT0,B00005JO28,moviewatcher,"[4, 5]","Douglas Adams' tale of one Earthman, the destruction of his beloved planet and subsequent travels through the cosmos was a popular four book trilogy, BBC radio program and television series.  An endless number of fans were eagerly anticipating the film adaptation.  Why didn't the beloved book turned theatrical release work on the big screen?The movie started out with promise.  A cheery, Pythonesque number by the dolphins of the world seemed to capture the playful wit of Douglas Adams.  But, alas, all was not right with the galaxy.  From the opening sequence, the film began to deviate from the book with little to no explanation to some of the key elements.Why did the intergalactic hitchhikers need to carry a towel?  Throughout the movie Ford Prefect (Mos Def) emphasizes the need to keep a towel with you at all times although it was never explained why.  Those who had not read the book would probably conclude that the towel was an unnecessary prop, a distraction or the film's creators simply had an unnatural towel complex.Sam Rockwell delivered a good performance as the over-the-top, ego-driven Zaphod Beeblebrox.  The special effects that depicted his second head below his first were average at best.  At times it would seem that Zaphod would have been better as a CGI character, using Sam Rockwell's voice and movements.  Zaphod's main goal of going to Magrethea is also lost in the film.  He wanted to gain great wealth from the place that made the luxury planets for the super wealthy.The Heart of Gold spaceship was also a little disappointing.  In the movie it was the shape of a ping-pong ball.  What made the ship unique in the book was the fact that it was the shape of a sleek, white running shoe.There is no doubt that John Malkovich is an excellent actor who needs to be used to the fullest extent in any movie.  However, his character, Humma Kaunla, was a waste of Malkovich's time and talents.  Despite the fact that the Humma Kaunla character was missing from the book, the character itself was never developed past the point of knowing he had been Zaphod Beeblebrox's opponent, lost the election and was the leader of a cult following.Kaunla's removal of Zaphod's second head in exchange for the ""point of view gun"" goes nowhere.  The group gets the gun on Magrethea, uses it on each other and the Vogons that were chasing them, however, one crucial point was left unanswered.  Did they give the gun to Kaunla to retrieve Zaphod's head?All in all the film version of ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", while entertaining in some parts, missed the premise of the book.

Especially the ""Thanks for all the Fish"" song.  I don't know what it is about that song, but I thought it was fantastic. The rest of the music to the movie was well done as well.  It was very fitting and unique to the movie.Not heeding the warning of the end of the earth from the dolphins, mankind is about to be destroyed. Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is a normal guy who has woken up to discover his house is about to be demolished to make room for a byway.  However, before this can happen he is taken by his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) as a Hitchhiker aboard a alien ship that has come to destroy the Earth to make room for an interstellar byway.The owners of this ship, the Vogons, find them and eject them into space, only to be picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell) and Tricia McMillan (Zooey Deschanael) who are piloting a stolen ship in search of the correct question for the meaning of life. Their destination is Magrathea, a planet that holds the computer who can answer that question.  Along the way, they encounter several enemy Vogons and other trials and tribulations.This was a cute movie.  At times it was hard to understand but it was the zany type of film that is great to watch and doesn't require you to think too much.  It would probably also be appropriate for children as well as there is nothing overly violent or vulgar in the film.  The speech is also appropriate for younger children as well.The movie is also not very long so it can easily be watched in an evening.

Varga ""Tauren Guard""","[1, 2]","I am a HUGE fan of the late great Douglas Adams, the writer/creator of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy four book trilogy. I've even had the pleasure of meeting the man several years ago at a book signing.  So, obviously, I was excited about seeing this movie.One of the main questions that has been asked about this movie is ""Do you need to read the book first?""  Honestly, yes, it would be a more enjoyable movie, in my opinion, if you have not only read the book first, but have also seen the UK tv series.  The Marvin from the TV series makes an appearance in the movie.Anyway, on to the storyline.  Martin Freeman plays Arthur Dent, a man whose home is about to be destroyed in more ways than one.  Two, actually.  His friend, Ford Prefect, played well by Mos Def, tells him at his house demolition that the Earth is about to be blown up.  They hitch a ride on the alien ship just before demolition, barely escape that, and wind up on another ship, flown (okay, stolen) by the President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, greatly portrayed by Sam Rockwell.  Along with Zaphod is the only other Earth survivor, Tricia (Trillian) McMillan, apathetically played by Zooey Deschanel.  You might remember her as Will Ferrell's girlfriend from the movie 'Elf'.  Also aboard is a depressed and paranoid android, Marvin, voiced by Alan Rickman (HAAAAAAAANS from Die Hard).  :)For the first two-thirds of the movie, the script sticks with the original book story; but, it starts taking about a half dozen different twists toward the end.  Fans will note the one or two in particular that would make it impossible to start the next movie (The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe) the same way that the book does.

I saw the original incarnation of the TV series on PBS when it was first imported to the US, and found it appealing on a number of levels.  It had a very dry and droll sense of wit.  The kind of underspoken humor that was so popular in British comedy; i.e. you were told the joke and given a moment or two to churn it in your head and then laugh as you saw fit.So, imagine my surprise when this comedic style was held over as an afterthought for a feature film, but predominantly replaced by a huge Hollywood like production with grand SFX, a giant score, massive amounts of CGI and props permeating with a kind of high energy zest harkening from screwball comedies.  What do make of a film like that?  In a word?  Interesting.It wasn't bad as such, but I had a hard time connecting with this film.  When I read Douglas Adams' books there was a kind of movement and energy to them, but again a more literary type of humor that you had to translate from the author's imagination to your own.  The original BBC series had found a formula for that, and gave it an appropriate low budget gloss to finalize the product.This film, however, explodes with production values.  So much that said production values actually explode and drown out the humor in all its forms.  That's not to say that there isn't a laugh here and there, because there is, but the movie that might've been is pushed aside in favor of wowing the movie goers with massive amounts of special effects and high energy acting.Well, the film is what it is.  If a revamping of the series were to be done, or rather a fresh take on the original material, I think a TV series dealing with installments would be more appropriate than trying to cram all of the books into one huge two-hour plus long feature film.Not a bad film, but a bit too much for me.Take it for what it is.",3,"Not a great film, not a bad film.",1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1911,"['finally', 'saw', 'Youtube', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'saw', 'original', 'incarnation', 'TV', 'series', 'PBS', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'imported', 'US', 'found', 'appealing', 'number', 'levels', 'had', 'very', 'dry', 'droll', 'sense', 'wit', 'kind', 'underspoken', 'humor', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'British', 'comedy', 'i.e', 'were', 'told', 'joke', 'given', 'moment', 'two', 'churn', 'head', 'then', 'laugh', 'saw', 'fit.So', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'comedic', 'style', 'was', 'held', 'over', 'afterthought', 'feature', 'film', 'predominantly', 'replaced', 'huge', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'grand', 'SFX', 'giant', 'score', 'massive', 'amounts', 'CGI', 'props', 'permeating', 'kind', 'high', 'energy', 'zest', 'harkening', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'What', 'do', 'make', 'film', 'word', 'Interesting.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'such', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'connecting', 'film', 'When', 'read', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'books', 'was', 'kind', 'movement', 'energy', 'again', 'more', 'literary', 'type', 'humor', 'had', 'translate', 'author', 'imagination', 'own', 'original', 'BBC', 'series', 'had', 'found', 'formula', 'gave', 'appropriate', 'low', 'budget', 'gloss', 'finalize', 'product.This', 'film', 'however', 'explodes', 'production', 'values', 'So', 'much', 'said', 'production', 'values', 'actually', 'explode', 'drown', 'out', 'humor', 'forms', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pushed', 'aside', 'favor', 'wowing', 'movie', 'goers', 'massive', 'amounts', 'special', 'effects', 'high', 'energy', 'acting.Well', 'film', 'what', 'revamping', 'series', 'were', 'be', 'done', 'rather', 'fresh', 'take', 'original', 'material', 'think', 'TV', 'series', 'dealing', 'installments', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'trying', 'cram', 'books', 'one', 'huge', 'two-hour', 'long', 'feature', 'bad', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'me.Take', 'what']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

I had heard many praises for this series though, whether it be the books or the TV series. So after getting intrigued by the trailers, I finally decided to watch this movie.After watching `The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', I wouldn't say it is the funniest movie, nor is it the most exciting movie; it is just an amusing, silly movie.I am not going to reveal the story of the movie, since I still haven't been able to understand it fully. So I will just move forward to the pros and cons of this movie.The first thing that stood apart for me in this movie was the amazing special effects. Throughout the movie, I was in awe by how real-like the effects for the scenes were. Secondly, I give credit for how original this movie it. The whole concept of this movie is completely different from any other. However, different does no necessarily mean better. I would have given this movie, 5 stars if it had some sort of an effect on me after watching it, but it didn't. It just made me feel like there was something missing. Even though it had good humor and good acting (and they tried to include romance somewhere in between), there was simply no story this movie. Moreover, I had trouble keeping up with the movie (they escape, and later they want a gun, then the answers to life, and somehow ending up in the backup Earth!).So, if you know the story well by reading the books or watching the series before watching this movie, you might enjoy it to the fullest.

638895,AMCH34Z0KHD41,B00005JO28,"rawk ""rawkabilly""","[3, 5]","While I did read the original Hitchhiker's Guide when I was in high school, I can hardly call myself a big Doug Adams fan. I appreciate his work and truly enjoyed the first Hitcher's book but obviously not enough to read the entire series. However, I did find it funny and interesting enough to get me excited, several years later, when I heard about the forthcoming film.Immediately following my excitement was another sensation though. Confusion. I wondered how the hell it would possibly work as a film. Anyone who has read the book knows what I mean. The book is ludicrous and spastic and randomly goes off a tangents. As a film, I could not see how Adam's book could find a format or structure that could make it work on screen.Now that I've just returned from seeing the film, I must say that my confusion was not unfounded. The movie, overall, really doesn't work. However, it still has many up sides.The first twenty minutes of the movie are a delight. It has the same wit which I recall in Adam's book and, likewise, you laugh heartily throughout the first twenty minutes. The peculiarity of Mos Def alone (who is wonderful in this film) is enough to keep you smiling, much like the opening number. The jokes and sight gags work well, for a while. A brief while. Soon the sight gags run rampant and just aren't funny at all. In fact, some are rather annoying and inane. The President of the Galaxy (who is annoying anyway) flips his extra head up over and over until you want to crush it.Thankfully though, this is the only aggravating special effect. The effects are amazingly done and lacks much of the impersonal touch of CGI, which has almost completely ruined special effects as we know it. Stan Winston style putty and robots always look better to me than some video-game superimposed nonsense. I watch films from the eighties like PREDATOR and I'm amazed at how much better it looks than say, THE HULK from that unforgivably bad Lee film. Anyway, the monsters and creatures of this film are stunningly done and make one feel like perhaps they did when they first saw THE DARK CRYSTAL, LABYRINTH or STAR WARS (the real STAR WARS, not this pathetic, new PHANTOM SITH nonsense). In addition, the intergalactic travel and foreign worlds are wonderfully done with extreme attention to detail.If only such detail had been focused on the script.Adams was working on the script adaptation of his most famous novel when he passed away a few years ago. Then the script was completed by another writer. I speculate that perhaps this is why the first half of the movie grabs one's attention and then the second half loses it almost completely.First of all, the movie stops being funny. It continues to try to be funny, but fails somehow, much like MARS ATTACKS did. Even Marvin, the maniacally depressed robot who is hilarious in the book, offers the audience only a chuckle here or there, most of them forced.Secondly, the plot of this film is only the cliff-notes to the plot of the book. While the movie hardly could explore every aspect of the novel without becoming a trilogy saga, I still feel that focusing on one objective would have made the movie feel like it had some sort of direction, instead of making it really go nowhere at all.Finally, the characters are either zany (just like in the book) or are incredibly dull and without depth (which is NOT the case in the book). The two earthlings in the film are drab, boring, underdeveloped and drastically uninteresting. It is virtually impossible to care about them or like them. This indifference to the ""main"" characters makes the movie slack and the almost nonexistent threat to them becomes even weaker due to disinterest.It was nice to see Mos Def in a bigger role. He is probably the only rapper out there who can act and is a joy to watch on screen; unlike Ice Cube, Eminem, and several others who have no business in cinema at all. Alan Rickman tries his best as Marvin, but he'll always play a better terrorist than he does a comedic character. He failed most of the time to make me laugh in DOGMA too. It's a shame because, as I said, Marvin is really funny in the book. Everyone else in the movie is rather unremarkable too and does not deserve much mentioning.But while the end of the movie is one of the most anticlimactic things ever put on film (and it really is), I still thought the movie overall was mostly fun. It's hard to totally dislike a movie which is this bizarre and utterly original. There are scenes in this film that are ridiculously strange and are really wonderful for it. There are amusing creatures, Monty Python-like sidenotes of silliness, and even a complete scene where the characters are made of yarn, which is priceless. The movie is also shot well and is visually stunning almost throughout it's entirety. It's eye candy the whole time, even when you don't care what's going on anymore. As a film, this doesn't really work, but Adam's insanity manages to leak into the movie nicely and makes it enjoyable at it's best moments and bearable at it's worst.So then, the film can be fun at times, but it's not quite as fun as it could have been and does not hold a candle to reading the book at all. It has it's moments, for sure, but not enough of them. I enjoyed seeing it enough not to hate it, but will not likely bother with it again when it hits DVD.",3,HITCH A RIDE ... or don't.,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,5356,"['did', 'read', 'original',

It was very entertaining and the special effects were phenomenal, but a lot of the jokes fell flat.The Vogons were much more disgusting than in the 1981 version, and I was quite impressed with them, but unfortunately you only got to hear the first and last few lines of the Vogon captain's poem.Plus--I found THIS reprehensible--they completely murdered the ""forty-two"" line.  It was supposed to sound MOMENTOUS, but instead they had Deep Thought say the line in a rather perky manner, which completely ruined the joke.  Even the fact that the computer was voiced by Helen Mirren couldn't serve as a consolation.  (There was, however, a rather amusing part later where the computer was watching a cartoon.)Martin Freeman did a very nice job as Arthur Dent, but the other three... well... Zaphod and Trillian are kind of annoying either way, and I couldn't understand a lot of Ford Prefect's lines.Alan Rickman did a very nice job of being Marvin The Paranoid Android, but it wasn't quite the same.  And of course Bill Nighy did a really good job as Slartibartfast (he's good at pretty much whatever role he plays).However, there were two very high points in the movie.  One came when a recorded audiovisual announcement from Magrathea was played, and Simon Jones had a brief cameo as the person speaking.This was especially funny when he concluded the message by saying ""Your death will be monitored for quality training purposes,"" flashed this huge toothy smile for a second, and then disappeared.The other high point came when the Vogons were attacking the good guys, so Marvin picks up this ""point-of-view gun"" (a gun that causes people to completely understand your viewpoint when you shoot it at them), and the hundreds of Vogons instantly fall over (with a very nice falling-domino effect), moaning about how they're so depressed.  Trust me, these two things were very very amusing.In conclusion, the movie was entertaining, but, where my personal preferences are concerned, I'd recommend the 1981 version.",3,I've mixed feelings about this one...,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,2114,"['seeing', 'film', 'version', 'Hitch', 'Hikers', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'lot', 'jokes', 'fell', 'flat.The', 'Vogons', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'disgusting', '1981', 'version', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'got', 'hear', 'first', 'last', 'few', 'lines', 'Vogon', 'captain', 'poem.Plus', 'found', 'THIS', 'reprehensible', 'completely', 'murdered', 'forty-two', 'line', 'was', 'supposed', 'sound', 'MOMENTOUS', 'instead', 'had', 'Deep', 'Thought', 'say', 'line', 'rather', 'perky', 'manner', 'completely', 'ruined', 'joke', 'Even', 'fact', 'computer', 'was', 'voiced', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'could', ""n't"", 'serve', 'consolation', 'was', 'however', 'rather', 'amusing', 'part', 'later', 'where', 'computer', 'was', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'did', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'other', 'three', 'well', 'Zaphod', 'Trillian', 'are', 'kind', 'annoying', 'way', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'lot', 'Ford', 'Prefect', 'lines.Alan', 'Rickman', 'did', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'being', 'Marvin', 'Paranoid', 'Android', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'course', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'Slartibartfast', 'good', 'pretty', 'much', 'role', '.However', 'were', 'two', 'very', 'high', 'points', 'movie', 'One', 'came', 'when', 'recorded', 'audiovisual', 'announcement', 'Magrathea', 'was', 'played', 'Simon', 'Jones', 'had', 'brief', 'cameo', 'person', 'speaking.This', 'was', 'especially', 'funny', 'when', 'concluded', 'message', 'saying', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'monitored', 'quality', 'training', 'purposes', 'flashed', 'huge', 'toothy', 'smile', 'second', 'then', 'disappeared.The', 'other', 'high', 'point', 'came', 'when', 'Vogons', 'were', 'attacking', 'good', 'guys', 'so', 'Marvin', 'up', 'point-of-view', 'gun', 'gun', 'people', 'completely', 'understand', 'viewpoint', 'when', 'shoot', 'hundreds', 'Vogons', 'instantly', 'fall', 'over', 'very', 'nice', 'falling-domino', 'effect', 'moaning', 'how', ""'re"", 'so', 'depressed', 'Trust', 'two', 'things', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'amusing.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'where', 'personal', 'preferences', 'are', 'concerned', ""'d"", 'recommend', '1981', 'version']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

638903,A1AF8GGNQ6LTBK,B00005JO28,Revelation Magazine,"[2, 6]","The long-awaited big screen adaptation of what is unquestionably the most amusing end-of-the-world novel ever written is, thankfully, quite funny.  The film is, by turns, just what it should be: witty, silly, smart, charming, philosophical, daringly playful, and decidedly British.  This is, of course, partly because Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not only a celebrated comedy and a British institution but a fantastically original piece of science fiction as well, and most of what works in the classic novel has been incorporated here.  The music, visual effects, production design, and set pieces are impressive and immediately entertaining.  Hardcore fans of the series may be dismayed to discover that the plot has been tinkered with for this big-screen outing, by both Adams and screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick, though that proves necessary and beneficial to the storytelling.  Either way, the plot still seems scattered, and that stands as the film's most glaring weakness.  Attempts to cram in truncated pieces of so much from the novel, in addition to a number of all-new gags, contribute to the film's frantic pace and divided attention.  Truly, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy tries to do and say too much in too short a time.  The cast, as well, is chaotic in their performances and characters that should be familiar to us seem to shift and change from scene to scene, though Martin Freeman is a perfect embodiment of English everyman Arthur Dent.  The film isn't perfect, though no version of Adams' classic--in print, on the radio, or on television--has ever played as if it were seamlessly smooth.  What is beautiful and somewhat surprising about this interpretation is that its heart grows as the film progresses.  The final half-hour balances its humor and emotional appeals quite well and many moments are both awe-inspiring and touching.  Embellishments of Arthur's romance with Trillian become meaningful, playing off of an apocalyptic ""last man and woman"" motif, and the climactic resurrection of the Earth is downright sublime.  The story is more emotionally grounded than in previous adaptations.  Additionally, the DVD release boasts some wonderful menus--based on the film's marvelous animated interpretations of the Guide itself--and a number of fun bonus features.  All in all, this is a decent tribute to a classic science fiction comedy that remains without equals, and you're not likely to find another film with similar style.  Douglas Adams would undoubtedly be proud.--Brian A.

638904,A2WL02ENWFU9PM,B00005JO28,Rex Macaroe,"[4, 5]","The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book, full to the brim with a sly wit and intriguing, albeit absurd, philosophies. It remains the greatest satire of the twentieth century, if not of all time. And personally, it is my favorite book.I would feel much better about hating the movie if Adams didn't adapt it himself. All of the existential charm of the original has been supplanted with cheap slapstick and fart jokes, horrible acting, and tacky special effects.The film gives up on its own story in the opening shots, replacing a young girl's revelation of the nature of the Universe with a short passage on the intelligence of dolphins. It then stretches the joke's punchline into a two minute long obnoxious showtune sure to turn your stomach and remain stuck in your head for weeks.The film makes the mistake of thinking that interrupting itself to make jokes will bring about more laughs than letting the situations reveal themselves naturally. When the book reveals that the meaning of life is actually the number 42, I laughed so hard, that I had to stop reading for about ten minutes. But it's not the punchline that makes it funny. It's the buildup. The philospher's strike and the bickering of the mice build tension. You're on the edge of your seat, waiting for it. It's the perfect anticlimax. The movie just flat-out says it, and you just don't care. I didn't hear anything past a chuckle in the theater during that scenes.The film does have its strengths. At some parts the film employs great use of tension and visual style. Some moments, like Humma Kavula's church service, are funny for they're wit. But these moments are few and far between, and the payoffs never seem worth their setups.The time it takes to watch it would be better spent reading the book or watching the original BBC miniseries.

Hitchhiker's has had a storied past: first a radio play, then a book, then a TV series, and now, finally after much effort, a film. None of the stories completely line up with each other, though all the major elements are present...""lining up"" was never the point of all this.The introductory part of the story is pretty easy to understand. Arthur Dent, an Englishman, is saved from the destruction of the Earth by his close friend Ford Prefect, who is not human, it turns out, but is an alien researcher for the best-selling book ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". What ensues is a series of misadventures, as the pair encounter the President of the Galaxy (who's on the run), and an old flame of Arthur's, and a depressed robot. The President has stolen a newfangled spaceship, and is in search of the Ultimate Question.This story has always been about fun. The movie carries it off perfectly, with a lot of small and large humorous moments. Two stand-out for me: the opening number, song by the dolphins, is great, as is the scene where the ship pops out of improbability space temporarily in the form of a ball of yarn, and Arthur, in yarn form, starts vomiting yarn.I heard that this movie was done ""on the cheap"", relative to other special effects blockbusters. It doesn't show at all. The planetary construction yard, towards the end of the movie, is pretty awe-inspiring.The actors do a fine job, doing justice to the material. No one will win awards for their work here...the point of the movie is the small humorous parts, not deep character development.So, I definitely recommend this movie, for all ages. I expect I'll be owning this on DVD, when it becomes available.",5,Don't Panic!

638909,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JO28,RMurray847,"[2, 4]","This is the kind of movie where it's probably foolhardy to write a review.  The books upon which it is based hold a revered place in the hearts of those who adored them.  That place cannot be shaken.  No movie could ever hold a candle to what the books accomplished in terms of sheer madcap imagination.  The first book, upon which the movie is mostly based...has a razor-thin ""plot"" that's really just an excuse for author Douglas Adams to shower us with one memorable idea, thought, invention, character, craft or non-sequiter after another.  How anyone could expect a ""faithful"" adaptation is beyond me.  The movie would make no narrative sense, would be really long and for those who don't remember and love the books...it would be a total waste of time.So entering the movie, I had hopes of a) seeing some of the beloved main characters brought to life believably, b) reveling in snatches of Adams' brilliant wit and c) laughing.  I did all three, so to that extent the movie is a success.A) Many characters were brought to excellent life.  I particularly like Sam Rockwell as Zaphod.  Some critics have claimed he was too antic or agitated.  Have they READ the books?!?!  Zaphod was an insane, never-stopping to think dynamo.  Rockwell gives it his own little twist, but he does a great job of making Zaphod likable and frustrating at the same time...just like in the book!!  His costumes were great, too!  Zooey Deschanel is an ideal choice as Trillian.  Although I don't know what inspired anyone to cast Mos Def as Ford Prefect, I thought he did a pretty darn fine job and should get more acting work.  Bill Nighy is a delight in everything he does, really...no except here.  And the actor who plays Arthur Dent is perfect...period.B) Stephen Fry, as the narrator, is the perfect voice of the Narrator.  He captures the breezy attitude of the ""guide"" and his voice, coupled with some witty animated sequences, gives the viewer a chance to ""see"" various sections of the guide.  Rather than just being a large book with many pages, it's become a sort of laptop computer now, and thus many of Adams' more witty passages are played out well on screen.  My favorite dealt with the ""worst poetry in the galaxy.""  FUN.C) I laughed quite a bit.  The special effects in the movie are witty.  For example, the Heart of Gold spaceship with the improbability drive...many amusing visual jokes as we see the ship turning into all sorts of things.  The bit when the whale plummets to its death is funnier on screen than on the page.  The visualization of the great computer Deep Thought is very funny too.  I laughed at Marvin a lot.The movie does have flaws.  The pacing, while always fast, sometimes feels forced.  There is sometimes a sense of false camaraderie.  Everyone is working so hard to be breezy and zany that the effort comes through at times, rendering the light and airy a bit weighted.  The movie has a ""plot"" that isn't really in the book.  While it fits the tone of Adams, it also isn't remarkable and because the movie now has to resolve the plot, we're occasionally stuck with stuff that isn't especially funny.  It gets us through the story, but sometimes in a clumsy manner.Nonetheless, the movie was a treat.  I'm glad it was made.  It's not perfect, but as I said earlier, a PERFECT film of this book is probably impossible.  I'm sorry for the die-hard fans who can't simply enjoy the treats the movie DOES have to offer.  Personally, I recommend the movies highly to anyone who has read and enjoyed the books and to anyone with a skewed sense of humor and a quick wit.  If you like Monty Python, this should be up your alley.  If you like ROYAL TENNABAUMS, you should like it.  Also, I think kids aged about 11 and up should actually find plenty to entertain them...my 12 year old daughter like it a lot.

638910,A188KU3SI543V3,B00005JO28,"rnorton828 ""rnorton828""","[1, 3]","Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy originated during the late 1970's as a BBC radio series.  The success of that radio series led to the publication of his equally hilarious novel of the same name.  The BBC television version emerged in 1981, followed by four more Hitchhiker's novels and a short story as well as more radio adaptations of the sequels.  And now, the Hitchhiker's Guide franchise has finally been brought to the big screen.  Having just seen the movie, my feelings are rather mixed.  Martin Freeman does make a rather likeable Arthur Dent.  John Malkovich makes a good villain as Humma Kavula--hopefully if there is a second film, Malkovich will return as Kavula.  Stephen Fry (Melchett from the BBC's Blackadder series) was a close friend of the late Mr. Adams, and it was great to have him involved as the voice of the Book.  I also liked Zooey Deschanel as Tricia ""Trillian"" McMillan.  Sam Rockwell did get on my nerves as Zaphod Beeblebrox, as his portrayal of the character comes off rather like a southern con artist.  I prefer Mark Wing-Davey as Zaphod in the radio and TV versions.  Mos Def is okay as Ford Prefect, although David Dixon's Ford in the television was much more convincing--more believably alien--than Mos Def's version in the film.  The movie is not as close to the book as the TV version was, and some of the Guide's narrations lack the detail of the book, TV and radio versions.  And the ""Disney-fication"" of the movie has made it more kid friendly, which will delight many parents, but annoy many HHGG purists.  Altogether, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not a bad movie, but it could have been so much better than it turned out to be.

But I knew I was doomed when it opened with a big ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" musical number. Really, from there it had nowhere to go but up, and yet somehow, it just kept going down.In case you've been in a cave for the past quarter-century, and have missed reading the book and/or seeing BBC's wonderful series based on it in the interim, the plot: Earth is scheduled to be demolished to build a hyperspace bypass. Coincidentally, this is supposed to happen the same morning the the house of Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman of Hot Fuzz) is supposed to be demolished to make way for an Earthbound bypass. This creates a minor cognitive disjunction when his beat friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def from 16 Blocks) tells him that the Earth is about to be destroyed, and to grab his towel. In any case, just after Arthur's house bites the dust, so does the planet, but Ford and Arthur have managed to hitch a ride on one of the spaceships that destroyed it. They make another hop and find out there's one other survivor from Earth: Tricia McMillan (The Happening's Zooey Deschanel), with whom Arthur had connected at a recent party before she was swept off her feet by an impulsive interloper. This turns out to be Zaphod Beeblebrox (Frost/Nixon's Sam Rockwell), President of the galaxy, who dropped into Earth to pick up female companionship (and some really snazzy boots) while tooling around in a stolen spaceship, the Heart of Gold. Consequently, he's being pursued by a number of entities. He's also on a quest to find the Ultimate Question. Everyone knows the Ultimate Answer (which is forty-two), but the Ultimate Question? And thus the four of them, accompanied by a manic-depressive android named Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman), embark on a series of adventures to that end.You know what I find most disappointing about this? It was Douglas Adams' own script, which tells me that either Adams' attempted transition to screenwriter was a miserable failure, or co-writer Karey Kirkpatrick absolutely butchered Adams' first draft. At this point I'm about 50-50; while Kirkpatrick has turned out some real gems (specifically Chicken Run), he's also responsible for the horror that was Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves. Which Kirkpatrick showed up to doctor Adams' draft? We'll never know. The acting is quite good, which is to be expected from such a cast (as well as the above, minor roles are filled by such luminaries as Stephen Fry, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich, among others), but my god, what they did to this book.Rent the BBC miniseries instead.

Hedges,"[0, 4]","I have been a fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide series since the original publication of the book and the original, brilliant BBC television series. I know that Douglas Adams very much wanted this movie to be made, and I hope in the end that he would approve. I must admit that the first two books of the series contain the majority of the magic for me, and the television series is irreplaceable, so I realize that I have set a very high standard for the movie.In general, the movie largely measures up to my expectations, though some of the casting and directorial choices would not have been my preferences. I think that Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent does an outstanding job with a difficult role; I was likewise delighted with the appearance of Zooey Deschanel, who brought the Trillian character to life. Although I am a fan of Sam Rockwell's work, I was not particularly pleased with the overacting (over-directing, I would actually guess, as Rockwell is a very nuanced actor) involved with Zaphod Beeblebrox; I particularly disliked the execution of the ""two headed"" effect. Even though the TV series was far cheesier from a special effects point of view, I believe that the Beeblebrox character on the small screen was more true to Adams' vision. I am generally neutral on the casting of Mos Def as Ford Prefect. I think that he does a good job with the role, yet I am still somewhat uncertain that he was the best actor for the job.The general outline of the film (which is mostly, though not entirely, taken from the series of books) is fast-paced and entertaining. The special effects are near-perfect and the actors generally do well in their roles. I was especially fond of the subplot involving Slartibartfast and Arthur. I was a bit surprised with the construction of Marvin, and I still prefer the original from the TV series, though I was delighted that the original Marvin had a cameo appearance.It is a given that with such a devoted and established fan base that no Hitchhiker's movie could please everyone, but while I was not totally satisfied overall, I think it is a good effort and definitely recommend seeing it, though I will always prefer the lower budget TV series. The thing I miss most from the TV series is the loss of much of the sly British humor of the original, with corresponding increase in slapstick, which to me seems largely contrary to the vision and intent of Douglas Adams.The DVD comes with numerous extras which really enhance the appeal of the package. I particularly enjoyed the outtakes and deleted scenes; I also found the audio commentaries interesting, enlightening, and informative.Fans of the series can nitpick this film to death, but I recommend a different approach: accept it for what it is, sit back, and enjoy the ride.",4,Mostly Harmless,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,2775,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'series', 'original', 'publication', 'book', 'original', 'brilliant', 'BBC', 'television', 'series', 'know', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'very', 'much', 'wanted', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'hope', 'end', 'would', 'approve', 'must', 'admit', 'first', 'two', 'books', 'series', 'contain', 'majority', 'magic', 'television', 'series', 'irreplaceable', 'realize', 'have', 'set', 'very', 'high', 'standard', 'movie.In', 'general', 'movie', 'largely', 'up', 'expectations', 'casting', 'directorial', 'choices', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'preferences', 'think', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'outstanding', 'job', 'difficult', 'role', 'was', 'likewise', 'delighted', 'appearance', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'brought', 'Trillian', 'character', 'life', 'am', 'fan', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'overacting', 'over-directing', 'would', 'actually', 'guess', 'Rockwell', 'very', 'nuanced', 'actor', 'involved', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'particularly', 'disliked', 'execution', 'two', 'headed', 'effect', 'Even', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'far', 'cheesier', 'special', 'effects', 'point', 'view', 'believe', 'Beeblebrox', 'character', 'small', 'screen', 'was', 'more', 'true', 'Adams', 'vision', 'am', 'generally', 'neutral', 'casting', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Ford', 'Prefect', 'think', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'am', 'still', 'somewhat', 'uncertain', 'was', 'best', 'actor', 'job.The', 'general', 'outline', 'film', 'mostly', 'not', 'entirely', 'taken', 'series', 'books', 'fast-paced', 'entertaining', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'near-perfect', 'actors', 'generally', 'do', 'well', 'roles', 'was', 'especially', 'fond', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Slartibartfast', 'Arthur', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'construction', 'Marvin', 'still', 'prefer', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'delighted', 'original', 'Marvin', 'had', 'cameo', 'appearance.It', 'given', 'devoted', 'established', 'fan', 'base', 'Hitchhiker', 'movie', 'could', 'please', 'everyone', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'satisfied', 'overall', 'think', 'good', 'effort', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'will', 'always', 'prefer', 'lower', 'budget', 'TV', 'series', 'thing', 'miss', 'most', 'TV', 'series', 'loss', 'much', 'sly', 'British', 'humor', 'original', 'corresponding', 'increase', 'slapstick', 'largely', 'contrary', 'vision', 'intent', 'Douglas', 'Adams.The', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'extras', 'really', 'enhance', 'appeal', 'package', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'found', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'interesting', 'enlightening', 'informative.Fans', 'series', 'can', 'nitpick', 'film', 'death', 'recommend', 'different', 'approach', 'accept', 'what', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

Riemensnyder,"[5, 11]","When I first read they were adapting Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for cinematic release, part of me got very, very anxious.  The TV adaptation in the early 1980s was a muddled mish-mash of HGTTG and its sequels, muddled in such a way it was hard for even the most devoted Adams fan to enjoy.  Book-to-movie transitions are usually worse off... but that's not the case here.  The transition is flawless.The filmmakers in charge of this big screen adaptation stay true to Adams's novel almost word for word here.  All of the best parts of the first film are present... and the casting is exceptional.  I read ""big"" names like Robin Williams and Jim Carrey were considered for the role of Zaphod Beeblebrox, but I'm glad they weren't cast.  Sam Rockwell *is* Zaphod.  The same can be said about the rest of the cast.  They looked and acted exactly as I envisioned the characters when I first read the novels many, many years ago.I've read nagative reviews complaining about how most of the material is lost on you if you haven't read Adams's books; I think that's totally false.  Granted, prior knowledge of the books gives you more of an insight as to what's going on, but you don't need it in order to enjoy this film.  It's written in way that even HGTTG ""virgins"" can catch on.This movie is a sci fi lover's dream.  I consider it the Star Wars of this era.

638916,A2YQVH5XGGWBHP,B00005JO28,Robert S. Truesdell,"[0, 2]","Decades ago when the BBC series was air on US public television, I caught a glimpse of an episode but I wanted to see the series from the beginning so I didn't watch any more. I could tell by the title that I would like it -- it was either going to be a pop-science romp a la ""Connections"" or a zany twist on Sci Fi. Unfortunately, it aired once and I lost the opportunity.Some time later I acquired the books and was delighted by the nonstop quirky one-liners and Adam's general take on life. Eventually I acquired the VHF release of the TV series. I couldn't imagine the video could match the non-linear, multi-threaded narrative in its entirety, but I saw it as a condensed way of reliving some of the book experiences. I knew that there was a danger that the video producers wouldn't pick up on some of my favorite and subtler bits. I accepted that.So when I saw a full-budget big-screen production in the works, I walked into it wide-eyed and aware of the difficulties and limitations. I was expecting a remake of the BBC series with better production values. And all considering, I was not disappointed. Some parts were a little underwhelming where other bits were brilliant -- Magrathea comes to mind. I attended the movie with the 15-year-old son of a friend and he had read the books. We both agreed that the film makers did a creditable job at compressing as much as they could into 2 hours.My biggest regret is that the movie did not succeed in the box office and so will not spawn a sequel. My pal and I both talked about acts that we would have really liked to have seen.When you consider that the original source material is a collection of observations sprinkled amonst long jokes and quirky one-liners, only loosely tied together by a theme, I'd say the movie delivered. The alternative would have been to recraft the material into a single-threaded story, like Men In Black, to which it is not all that dissimilar.",4,"Well, it IS sort of an inside joke...",1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,1931,"['Decades', 'ago', 'when', 'BBC', 'series', 'was', 'air', 'US', 'public', 'television', 'caught', 'glimpse', 'episode', 'wanted', 'see', 'series', 'beginning', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'more', 'could', 'tell', 'title', 'would', 'like', 'was', 'either', 'going', 'be', 'pop-science', 'romp', 'la', 'Connections', 'zany', 'twist', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Unfortunately', 'aired', 'once', 'lost', 'opportunity.Some', 'time', 'later', 'acquired', 'books', 'was', 'delighted', 'nonstop', 'quirky', 'one-liners', 'Adam', 'general', 'take', 'life', 'Eventually', 'acquired', 'VHF', 'release', 'TV', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'video', 'could', 'match', 'non-linear', 'multi-threaded', 'narrative', 'entirety', 'saw', 'condensed', 'way', 'reliving', 'book', 'knew', 'was', 'danger', 'video', 'producers', 'would', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'favorite', 'subtler', 'bits', 'accepted', 'that.So', 'when', 'saw', 'full-budget', 'big-screen', 'production', 'works', 'walked', 'wide-eyed', 'aware', 'difficulties', 'limitations', 'was', 'expecting', 'remake', 'BBC', 'series', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'considering', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'parts', 'were', 'little', 'underwhelming', 'where', 'other', 'bits', 'were', 'brilliant', 'Magrathea', 'mind', 'attended', 'movie', '15-year-old', 'son', 'friend', 'had', 'read', 'books', 'agreed', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'creditable', 'job', 'compressing', 'as', 'much', 'could', '2', 'hours.My', 'biggest', 'regret', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', 'box', 'office', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'spawn', 'sequel', 'pal', 'talked', 'acts', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'liked', 'have', 'seen.When', 'consider', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'collection', 'observations', 'sprinkled', 'amonst', 'long', 'jokes', 'quirky', 'one-liners', 'only', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'theme', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'delivered', 'alternative', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'recraft', 'material', 'single-threaded', 'story', 'Men', 'Black', 'not', 'dissimilar']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

Arthur Denton (Martin Freeman) wakes up one morning with the horrifying prospect that he will lose his home as it will be demolished to make way for a bypass. Simultaneously, the alien race Vogons also wish to destroy the earth to make way for a galactic bypass. Denton hitches a ride on an alien spaceship and embarks on a great journey across space. His exploits further raise questions about the universe and God, in blatantly hilarious and entertaining manners. The constant transformations, quirky characters and strange premises are all components in this brilliant movie. The look is great, employing the latest Computer Graphics and digital cinematography.

Its called ""Stream of consciousness"" writing, and Adams made it work well, and British humour has survived superbly on it ever since the GOONS if not before.The movie experience was amazing, since I had never seen the cinema full, let alone queued up 20 mins  before start in the area I am in ( I am used to sessions where there is me and maybe 5 other people in the cinema).It was kind of odd that what I laughed at was different to what the locals laughed at, but then I heard the original radio plays that the books  were based on, but this seemed rational since no-one there knew about the original radio plays.You could take just about any one section of the original plays, or even the book and make an entire film out of it.Thoroughly enjoyable film, many highlights, including the planet creation workshop with Slatibardfast ( sp? ).Extra bonus stuff in the film is the ""spot the cameos"" thread... which includes the Original Marvin the Depressed Robot in a Queue; it is very likely that no-one in the US will have heard the Single cut by Marvin... low run, but became a collectors  file when a Microsoft technician in Australia made a wav  file of the tune, and began  circulating the tune in the early 90s. It has Marvins real voice and all, so its pretty cool if you get that disc. I suspect it would do very well if released here.ENJOY",5,"Excellent film, Great Radio Play, Superb Books",1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,2972,"['DVD', 'excellent', 'addition', 'movie', 'experience', 'Sad', 'say', 'just', 'nothing', 'write', 'will', 'convince', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'like', 'DVD.The', 'fun', 'feature', 'who', 'like', 'film', 'DVD', 'neat', 'feature', 'not', 'advertised', 'THE', 'IMPROBABILITY', 'DRIVE', 'very', 'cool.The', 'Sound', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'better', 'experience', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'superb', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'sadly', 'ones', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'deleted.The', 'added', 'commentaries', 'provide', 'lots', 'great', 'information', 'once', 'again', 'like', 'film', 'info', 'will', 'help', 'lot.Also', 'one', 'neat', 'added', 'extra', 'Marvin', 'HANGMAN', 'game', 'very', 'fun.In', 'respects', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'reinterpreted', 'least', 'Nose', 'prominent', 'appearance', 'film', 'key', 'point', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'approved', '1', '2', 'changes', 'principle', 'story', 'respect', 'film', 'different', 'book', 's', 'done', 'original', 'writer/creator', 'himself.But', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'close', 'few', 'IT', 'workers', 'Florida', 'State', 'Government', 'who', 'think', 'Schrodingers', 'Cat', 'Philosophical', 'rubbish', 'so', 'doing', 'show', 'misunderstand', 'Concept', 'Schodingers', 'Cat', 'good', 'film', 'love', 'film', 'DVD', 'superb', 'extra.ENJOY***************************It', 'total', 'rubbish', 'say', 'book', 'not', 'novel', 'one', 'concept', 'therefore', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'Monty', 'Python', 'did', 'entire', 'film', 'based', 'two', 'empty', 'halves', 'coconuts', 'called', 'Stream', 'consciousness', 'writing', 'Adams', 'made', 'work', 'well', 'British', 'humour', 'survived', 'superbly', 'ever', 'GOONS', 'not', 'before.The', 'movie', 'experience', 'was', 'amazing', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'cinema', 'full', 'let', 'alone', 'queued', 'up', '20', 'mins', 'start', 'area', 'am', 'am', 'used', 'sessions', 'where', 'maybe', '5', 'other', 'people', 'cinema', '.It', 'was', 'kind', 'odd', 'what', 'laughed', 'was', 'different', 'what', 'locals', 'laughed', 'then', 'heard', 'original', 'radio', 'books', 'were', 'based', 'seemed', 'rational', 'no-one', 'original', 'radio', 'plays.You', 'could', 'take', 'just', 'one', 'section', 'original', 'plays', 'even', 'book', 'make', 'entire', 'film', 'it.Thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'many', 'highlights', 'including', 'planet', 'creation', 'workshop', 'Slatibardfast', 'sp', '.Extra', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'film', 'spot', 'cameos', 'thread', 'Original', 'Marvin', 'Depressed', 'Robot', 'Queue', 'very', 'likely', 'no-one', 'US', 'will', 'have', 'heard', 'Single', 'cut', 'Marvin', 'low', 'run', 'became', 'collectors', 'file', 'when', 'Microsoft', 'technician', 'Australia', 'made', 'wav', 'file', 'tune', 'began', 'circulating', 'tune', 'early', '90s', 'Marvins', 'real', 'voice', 'pretty', 'cool', 'get', 'disc', 'suspect', 'would', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'released', 'here.ENJOY']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

Koropeckyj ""Romi Panchir""","[8, 10]","Douglas Adam's seminal incorrectly named trilogy was always begging for a movie to be made of it... the first being made in the 1980s as a BBC mini-series. This show had the production values of a 1950s z-grade horror movie, yet it recaptured the feel and texture of the books, while the new movie does quite the opposite: it gives the story a much needed face-lift, but loses some of the things that made the books and the mini series so endearing.Arthur Dent's house is about to get knocked down in order to build an overpass at the exact location of his house. Little does he know that in a cruel twist of fate, the same thing is about to happen to Earth. Fortunately, Ford Prefect comes in the nick of time (towel in hand) to wisk Arthur away from the doomed planet.Soon they begin travelling around the galaxy; they get captured by Vogans (beuracratic and unfealing green behemoths); travel on a ship that has a tendency to do things that are very improbably; talk with a manically depressed robot; watch as planets are being built by a race of people who build planets; continue getting chased by the Vogans; find the answer to the question of life, the universe and everything; break Arthur's love interest out of prison and so on.So what's wrong with it? Well, that might be a little difficult to explain, but as far as I can figure, the addition of a tangible goal for each character makes the movie lose some of the books charm. Arthur is wildly in love with Trillian (a girl that he met on Earth, who now happens to be travelling through space with egomaniac Zaphod Beeblebrox (sp)), but she kind of ignores him and puts on the waterworks when she finds out Earth was destroyed. Zaphod is portrayed as more of a bumbling fool than he was in either the mini-series or the book. Arthur Dent (who is surprisingly well played by Mos Def) just wants to find a good party.So now that Arthus has a tangible goal: to woo Trillian, the movie's plot is centered around that, providing climaxes, ups and downs and so on, where there were originally none, just quirky things about the universe. The movie also creates an ending where there was no ending before, but then right at the end provides an outlet for a sequal (The Restaurant at the end of the Universe).Past the qualms with the plot, the movie looks good, it really does. The planet construction floor is breathtakingly vast, the Vogans look like real 'things,' Earth's implosion (it wasn't an explosion) looks rather amazing, John Malkovich looks downright creepy with his spider legs and so on. Unfortunately, these effects are caught within the Hollywoodized plot and for me and for many other fans it was a little dissapointing.

The movie contains (also as per Imdb) an all star cast of various actors and actresses that add additional life to the film (such as the great performance of Alan Rickman as Marvin the robot, Zooey Deschanel as Trillian and Arthur's secret love interest).  There are other great actors and actresses of this film (I am just keeping it brief to get to the point). Arthur gets saved and transported to space courtesy of help from his space traveler friend (played by Mos Def).  Both Arthur and his friend escape the ship that they hitched a ride on, and end up in another spacecraft where they run into Trillian and her companion (played by Sam Rockwell).  During the journey Arthur ponders his life more deeply, and wonders what could have been if he would have traveled more with Trillian.  The movie heavily centers around the relationship dynamics of Arthur and Trillian.  In addition, Arthur and Trillian end up requiring the assistance of others (both their robot and alien friends) in order to fulfill their mission of seeing if they can save Earth, and keep themselves alive.

638939,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00005JO28,Stephen A. Haines,"[2, 6]","Alright, then, the next to ultimate question.  ""Can a book successfully be transformed into a film?""  In this case, it was almost an inevitability.  HHGG was first a radio programme, then a book and finally, a TV mini-series.  Now Hollywood has produced its version [that statement is a warning!].  If you talk to fans, REAL fans, only the book, radio, or TV presentation is ""the real one"" usually depending on which version was first encountered.  For those with no Douglas Adams in their background, this film may come as a pleasant shock.  For the ""established"" HHGG aficionado, there may be some teeth grinding and bemoaning of missing episodes or ""wrong"" emphasis.  That would be a mistake, since, whatever its flaws or shortcomings, the film is done in the best spirit of what Adams sought to achieve.  It mixes parody, irony, pathos, romance and gleeful humour in a delightful recipe for entertainment.The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a tour of human foibles and hopeful dreams.  Arthur Dent, mild-mannered suburbanite, finds his existence threatened.  First, it's by the bureaucracy of his local council.  Then it's by an identical attitude of an intergalactic bureaucracy.  The first wants to destroy his home, the second, his home planet.  Arthur's rescue, by his sometime friend, Ford Prefect, launches him on a succession of improbable adventures.  These events may seem bizarre until you realise you've seen their equivalents in your own life.  That, of course, is Adams' project - to mirror ""real life"" by exhibiting it in distorted, but recognisable frameworks.  Because Adams was instrumental in bringing this film into existence, it very nearly does just what he wanted.  If the film isn't exactly like the original story, that's because time changed the world, Adams and the people encountering his material about the world.Hollywood, however, did impinge its ""standards"" on this film.  As Arthur Dent, Tim Freeman is Hollywood's version of the ""muddle through"" Englishman.  He's more subdued than Simon Jones was in the radio and TV versions.  When Jones was angry or depressed, he was much more expressive than Freeman.  On the other hand, if someone like Mos Def had been the earlier Ford Prefect, the radio and TV versions would have been even greater successes than they were.  Zooey Deschanel is an outstanding Trillian, but Hollywood nearly demolished her role by making the formula ""love interest"" far too significant.  One can only wonder what Adams had to say about that.  Sam Rockwell as Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy, had the earlier example of Mark Wing-Davey's suave arrogance to guide him.  Rockwell's response is to shelve the ""suave"" and play the ""arrogance"" to the hilt.  It works, but only just.  Is this a ""Hollywood transformation""?  And what are we to say of Alan Rickman's voice as Marvin the paranoid robot?  He should have been Slartibartfast in an expanded role.  Yet, whose voice would Marvin have then carried?Garth Jennings had his work cut out directing this film.  His touch seems light, but deft.  There is nothing forced in this film, and Jennings seems to have understood what Adams sought in this story.  For those who don't know Adams, this is a good starting point, but don't stop here.  For the Adams reader, there may be some quizzical expressions over what might have been changed without reason.  For the established Adams aficionado, the loss of The Restaurant At the End of the Universe will be inexcusable, but to see how well Adams can be adapted and still successful will be rewarding.

638940,A29BL7J287E1IS,B00005JO28,Store Hadji,"[4, 7]","If you want the REAL Hitch-Hiker's Guide, read the books or listen to the radio series.  This film is a disappointingly dumbed-down and altered version of Douglas Adams' story.  It fails in so many places I won't even try to list them all.  Director Garth Jennings should be roundly hissed for filming such a poorly crafted screenplay.Here are a few changes to the story which really bothered me:SPOILER ALERT!We all know the Earth gets destroyed.  In the books (and radio series) and in this film thing (note my dubious tone.)In both continuities (book and film) the Earth is resurrected.Douglas Adams did so in the fourth book (So Long and Thanks for All the Fish.)  He had the dolphins pluck another Earth out of a parallel dimension and place it literally under the feet of all the humans who'd just had their Earth destroyed (thus saving them all from death.)In this film, the Earth is resurrected at the end of the movie (wow, that was quick.)  It is not replaced by the dolphins.  It is instead the Earth Mark 2, made by the Magratheans (who also made one in the book.)The original Earth (Mark 1, I guess) was also made by the Magratheans and was actually an organic super computer running a several million year program to find the Ultimate Question to the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe and Everything (which even Rick Wakeman's cat knows is 42.)  The program was run by hyperintelligent pandimensional beings who appear in our dimension as white mice.In the book, the mice needed to start the program over, since the Vogons had destroyed the Earth just before the culmination of the program.  That means the Magratheans built them another primordial Earth, ready to start the program from line 1.  As it turned out though, when the mice discovered Arthur had survived the Vogons, they decided just to take his brain instead, not needing the Earth Mark 2 at all any more.In the film, for some reason the Magratheans build the replacement Earth as an exact duplicate of the first Earth at the moment of its destruction.  The mice say they need it AND Arthur's brain to complete their program.  Okay so far.  After Arthur kills the mice (a movie-only event - how do you kill pandimensional beings by swatting them on a table top?  That would be the equivalent of stubbing their toes) the Magratheans decide simply to give the Earth Mark 2 to Arthur, for no reason in particular.  They employ life-bestowing powers (never hinted at in Adams' books and invented for the film) to recreate all the life on Earth, including all the humans who had been killed...everything but the dolphins, who return from wherever it was they went (immediately before the Vogons arrived.)I can see the intent here.  Give the movie a happy ending.  Arthur kills the mice, saves the Earth and all of Humanity.This is not what Adams wrote in the books.  Supposedly he cowrote the screenplay, but was this ending his idea, or was it infused into the story after his death?The problem with this ending is that NONE of the lifeforms on Earth (excluding the dolphins) are the originals.  Everyone still died.  These recreated humans may act like and know what the ones who had been destroyed did, but they aren't the same ones.  They are clones.  (Unless the Magratheans also now control time and snagged all the human beings out of the past, which means they could have saved the original Earth as well - but none of this is set up in the script.)  No.  This isn't the happy ending the studio thought it was.Am I reading too deeply into the film?  Damn right.  Adams certainly would have, and he would not have allowed the film to deviate in this direction.Another change to the story, completely messing up what transpired in the books and radio series, is that Arthur and Trillian fall in love, while Zaphod suddenly makes it with his vice-president (in a plot twist that comes out of nowhere.)  This was apparently even Adams' idea, though I fear he had become tainted by the tenets of Hollywood screen-writing.  Trillian HATED Arthur because he was a dolt.  Only now, Trillian appears to be the dolt.  There's no way the Trillian appearing in this film holds multiple doctorates in math and astrophysics...There's also the new plot thread in which Zaphod meets up with his opponent from the last Galactic presidential election (which Zaphod did win, by the way)...John Malkovitch's character (I never could understand his name.)  Anyway, this guy cuts off Zaphod's second head and keeps it in hock until Zaphod can return with some mysterious gun designed by Deep Thought (the computer who designed the Earth for the mice) in another new plot invention.What the hell is all that about?Nothing as it turns out.  The gun merely makes the person you shoot realize how you feel (what a sappy, pointless sentiment) and then the movie forgets that Zaphod was even supposed to return with the gun (and what was Malkovitch's character going to do with it?) and also forgets that Zaphod is lacking his second head.No matter, say the film's producers, let's cut straight to our happy ending.Adams made his own bone-headed blunders in the books and left plot-lines unresolved (i.e. the disappearance of Fenchurch,) but I really, really do not believe he left the screenplay in this condition.  I smell the rotten reek of studio tampering.  ""Let's make a happy ending"" they say.  And piss all over the continuity and the author's intentions to get there.A shame.  But exactly what you'd expect from Hollywood.  Adams kept the film from being made as long as he lived, since he didn't want Hollywood to ruin it.  As soon as he died, they did.In another example of the film-maker's incompetence, Adams' idea of the mallets which pop out of the ground on the planet Vogsphere (to smack people in the face) was brilliantly conceived (by Adams) and so badly rendered by the film that no one could ever know what the hell is happening.  Adams' idea was that the mallets were a unique attribute to the planet Vogsphere, that they popped up and smacked the face of anyone who had an original thought or idea, and that the Vogons had subsequently evolved without possessing any creativity (and further that their noses had been left permanently flattened and shoved up between their eyebrows.)None of this idea is conveyed in the movie.  Director Garth Jennings plays it as pointless, mindless and noisy slapstick and it sickens me that they didn't at least make up a guide entry to explain it.Other than those gripes, the cast is good.  The special effects are great.  The music sucks.Worth it if you're a sci-fi comedy fan.  Worth nit-picking if you're an H2G2 devotee.  Sure could have been better.And that tasteless, horrible Broadwayesque song which starts and ends the film - someone shoot me so I never need think of it again!  Now!  As soon as I heard that opening music, I knew exactly what I was in for, and exactly what had gone wrong.On the other hand...the film does have its great moments too, the best of which left me in tears!  All-in-all, though...no - I did not like it.Read the books and listen to the radio versions.  If you still want more, watch that terrible BBC-TV production - at least Adams WROTE that one!  :)",2,Destroys the Continuity of the Books,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,7207,"['want', 'REAL',

The book was. I think some of that was down to casting - Arthur, Zaphod and Marvin worked fine, but Trillion and Ford just didn't work for me. Laclustre - in every department.Some of the humor was bound to be lost in the transition from page to screen, but surely a good script, director and cast should be more than capable of increasing the humor quotient in other areas to compensate - you'd think! Sadly, they didn't here.And while the 'acting' portrayal of Zaphod was okay, I thought the realization of a two-headed alien was pathetic.

Like so many other much-loved cult favourites I've tried to read but just couldn't (One Hundred Years of Solitude, Confederacy of Dunces, Infinte Jest, Tom Robbins, Dave Barry, so many more...), I read a bit before I found it just plain silly and dull and I never finished it. Somehow, I thought that the film would offer me a clue to why Douglas Adams' sense of humour appeals to so many people; sadly, it didn't. The film opens with a very boring 15 minute sequence that introduces the hapless Arthur Dent, played forgetably by dull everyman Martin Freeman, who wears a bathrobe throughout the film(?!?). The movie takes a Pink Floyd-like turn (Adams was a friend of David Gilmour) when the repulsive and officious Vogons show up and destroy Earth. Alan Rickman voices Marvin the Paranoid Android (nice), Sam Rockwell plays the president of the universe (good manic performance by an actor I like, but also ultimately a bit annoying), and John Malkovich very appropriately plays a super-creepy alien cult leader whose head, arms and upper torso roams around on little mechanical legs.

638944,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00005JO28,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 2]","Douglas Adams had been working for twenty years to get his magnum opus turned into a movie.  I think it's important to note that there are many forms of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (aka H2G2 by fans) in existence.  It didn't start as a novel; in fact, it began its life as a radio show.  Furthermore, as the novel was adapted from the radio show, it was changed, edited and made in some places completely different to be best in the novel medium.  So, it's hard to say what is the ""true"" form of H2G2.  A lot of people were upset at the time of the changes made from radio broadcast to novel as I'm sure there are a lot of people upset over teh changes from novel to film.  That said, personally I feel they did a pretty good job in transforming this wonderful novel into film.The first obstacle is that half of the humor in the books is not what is said by the characters but the editorializing on Douglas's part.  For instance, the whale and the flower pot both thinking radically different things before crashing to Magrathea.  It's hard to do a good job translating that to film.  Usually, as is the case here, you would have to use a voice over which is frowned upon by most directors, etc, because it generally isn't the best way to show the audience things.  But they used it in this movie and it works because I can't think of a better way to do it.Some of the major critiques to the movie version is that it moves pretty quickly.  This is true, the heroes are often spirited away from planet to ship to planet rather quickly and don't waste much time doing anything else.  However, the book is set up pretty much in the same aspect.  It's short, about 150 pages, and that's not very much time to spend on anything but planet hopping.  I found, reading the book recently again in preparation for the movie, that the book also moves quickly from spot to spot.  The only difference is that you are reading it in measured lumps instead of watching 2 hours of it in one sitting.There are a few changes in the movie as well.  John Malkovich's character, Humma Kavula, was created *by* Douglas Adams for the movie.  Douglas Adams worked on the original script before his untimely death in 2001.  The script has, of course, been changed since 01, but the character of Kavula and the added tension between him and Zaphod was created by the original author.The creatures were created by Jim Henson's studio and looking at the Vogon's character and how emotive they are, it brings to mind how puppetry and creatures that are really there are sometimes much better than CGI.  This movie reminded me of the power of having real things for actors to work with instead of computer generated images.  Very well done.Overall, for me it was a pretty good adaptation.  Yes, it moves quite quickly and yes there are some changes to the original novel.  But it was fun.  I don't think it's as good as the novel, of course, and it isn't as witty as Douglas Adam's work, but it worked really well.  And there were a lot of people who think the novel isn't as good as the radio broadcast.  I think the task of trying to adapt the momentus novel H2G2 was done admirably well.  Some huge fanatics who spend a lot of time pondering the question to the answer 42 might not like it very much, but this fan did.",4,Pretty decent adaptation,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,3299,"['Douglas', 'Adams', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'twenty', 'years', 'get', 'magnum', 'opus', 'turned', 'movie', 'think', 'important', 'note', 'are', 'many', 'forms', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'aka', 'H2G2', 'fans', 'existence', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'novel', 'fact', 'began', 'life', 'radio', 'show', 'Furthermore', 'novel', 'was', 'adapted', 'radio', 'show', 'was', 'changed', 'edited', 'made', 'places', 'completely', 'different', 'be', 'best', 'novel', 'medium', 'So', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'true', 'form', 'H2G2', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'upset', 'time', 'changes', 'made', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'novel', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'upset', 'teh', 'changes', 'novel', 'film', 'said', 'personally', 'feel', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'transforming', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'film.The', 'first', 'obstacle', 'half', 'humor', 'books', 'not', 'what', 'said', 'characters', 'editorializing', 'Douglas', 'part', 'instance', 'whale', 'flower', 'pot', 'thinking', 'radically', 'different', 'things', 'crashing', 'Magrathea', 'hard', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'translating', 'film', 'Usually', 'case', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'use', 'voice', 'frowned', 'most', 'directors', 'etc', 'generally', ""n't"", 'best', 'way', 'show', 'audience', 'things', 'used', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'way', 'do', 'it.Some', 'major', 'critiques', 'movie', 'version', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'true', 'heroes', 'are', 'often', 'spirited', 'away', 'planet', 'ship', 'planet', 'rather', 'quickly', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'much', 'time', 'doing', 'anything', 'else', 'However', 'book', 'set', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'aspect', 'short', 'about', '150', 'pages', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'spend', 'anything', 'planet', 'hopping', 'found', 'reading', 'book', 'recently', 'again', 'preparation', 'movie', 'book', 'also', 'quickly', 'spot', 'spot', 'only', 'difference', 'are', 'reading', 'measured', 'lumps', 'instead', 'watching', '2', 'hours', 'one', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'character', 'Humma', 'Kavula', 'was', 'created', '*by*', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'movie', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'worked', 'original', 'script', 'untimely', 'death', '2001', 'script', 'course', 'been', 'changed', '01', 'character', 'Kavula', 'added', 'tension', 'Zaphod', 'was', 'created', 'original', 'author.The', 'creatures', 'were', 'created', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'studio', 'looking', 'Vogon', 'character', 'how', 'emotive', 'are', 'mind', 'how', 'puppetry', 'creatures', 'are', 'really', 'are', 'sometimes', 'much', 'better', 'CGI', 'movie', 'reminded', 'power', 'having', 'real', 'things', 'actors', 'work', 'instead', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'Very', 'well', 'done.Overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'adaptation', 'Yes', 'quite', 'quickly', 'yes', 'are', 'changes', 'original', 'novel', 'was', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'good', 'novel', 'course', ""n't"", 'as', 'witty', 'Douglas', 'Adam', 'work', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'were', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'novel', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'think', 'task', 'trying', 'adapt', 'momentus', 'novel', 'H2G2', 'was', 'done', 'admirably', 'well', 'huge', 'fanatics', 'who', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'pondering', 'question', 'answer', '42', 'might', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'fan', 'did']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

""Please, don't let them screw it up,"" was the prayer of every Douglas Adams fan.  And for the most part, they didn't.  There's the right balance of sheen and cheesiness.  There's no predictable Pythonesque pacing, wherein the action is halted to linger over absurdities.  Things are kept light and moving along.One thing it isn't, is a CGI party.  Jim Henson's puppeteers did a great job designing and operating the Vogons.  As the director says in the commentary track, the cast plays off each other a lot better when one of them isn't a tennis ball on a stick.Much of the film's energy comes from the Zaphod Beeblebrox character, played by Sam Rockwell.  Without him careening all over the set, the film would be in real danger of being merely cute, or worse: as dull as Spaceballs.So no, it isn't a bulls-eye.  It's hard to imagine how any film could perfectly translate the HGTTG fan's inner world to the screen.  But it isn't a flop, either.

638949,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B00005JO28,Thomas Glebe,"[2, 5]","I was prepared to be disappointed at the feature movie version of the infamous book (and later BBC mini-series, available elsewhere on DVD), but I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with this ""version.""  I read the book a long, long time ago, and wasn't that impressed with the TV version, which is perhaps why, after so many years, I was ready to be disappointed.  Could ""Hollyweird"" really do justice to dim, confusing but challenging memories of the original text?  And ideas, and visuals inside my head?  In less than two hours?  The answers to all, a thumbs way up yes!Some ""purists"" have dissed this film, but for anyone with a more casual approach, this is not only a great version of the book (and puts the TV series to shame in all ways except length, imho), it's a great introduction to some rather mind-expanding ideas, most of which are still present after all of these years, for those who may never have pondered seriously the answer to the question ""What is the meaning of life?""It's 42, of course.This film (version) of the original book, works on so many levels, it's hard to know where to begin.  For those unfamiliar with the whole concept, the condensed movie-movie is entertaining from beginning to end, even if you wind up asking yourself what the bleep has been going on throughout.  This makes this version good for repeated viewings, and if one likes this, a must buy DVD, aside from the extras.  For those who either read the book long ago or saw the TV series, the jury may be out, and it all depends on your taste.  And your expectations.  Having had fond memories of the long-distant book, and not too favorable feelings about the TV series, I really liked this.  It brought back, in a short time, a lot of what impressed me in younger dayz.The movie tells the story of an ""everyman"" suddenly swept up in a cosmic adventure, where he finds the most strange things, and where the true nature of the universe is revealed, piece by piece.  The beginning titles and sequences with the dolphins and the catchy ""So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish"" song are perfect.  Within a short time, our hero is sent on a wild ride, with constantly changing characters and settings, all done with extremely good CGI.  The bulk of the film itself slows down in some parts, and is totally confusing and weird for weird sake in others, but overall, even a caveman can do it!  That is, ""get"" the main gist here by the end.  An ending which is a quick montage and replaying of the fish song, and couldn't have been better.Fans of serious sci-fi need to look elsewhere, as this is much more a work of fantasy, however, as the two genres often interact, this really doesn't disappoint on either level, even if doesn't entirely (at times) satisfy either.  But I'm not going to carp.  Truth is, sci-fi fan or fantasy fan, the mixture here adds up to a fun experience throughout, and has what I think is the most important feature of any movie and/or DVD.  If you like it at first viewing, you'll want to own the thing, to watch it and parts, again, and again.The special effects in this are great, though not perfect.  The music is good, especially the title and ending song.  All the actors here do a subtle but effective job, with a standout being that from wholesome babe Zooey Deschanel.  The constantly depressed robot is also consistenly funny, till the end.  Along the way, we are swept away in a totally weird world (the galaxy, and universe to be precise), seeing all the wonders and madness both first person and third (and second I guess, somewhere along the way), meeting with and existing alongside many strange characters and things from beginning to end.This film works in the long run, because it never really takes itself too seriously, just like the book and general original ""thesis.""  That is, that we are but tiny little insignificant organisms in a greater cosmos, one in which, almost anything one can imagine, might actually be reality, in a semi-serious, or wacky beyond our real understanding way.  I was rather torn about giving this a five star rating.  Four might be better appropriate, since not everyone might get what this is all about.  And there are some slow spots.  But going back to my expectations, this film really works on multi-levels, for those both unfamiliar with the book and ideas, and for those with a more casual interest.While the TV series (and DVD) may deal with the book's original material much more thoroughly, this condensed version is just about the best I had hoped for from the studio system.  It's entertaining, period, from beginning to end, and aside from minor flaws, has become one of my favorite movies.  And one of the best sci-fi/fantasy efforts from Hollywood in a long, long time.",5,"So long, and thanks for all the fish...",1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,4756,"['was', 'prepared', 'be', 'disappointed', 'feature', 'movie', 'version', 'infamous', 'book', 'later', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'available', 'elsewhere', 'DVD', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'version', 'read', 'book', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'TV', 'version', 'perhaps', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Could', 'Hollyweird', 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'dim', 'confusing', 'challenging', 'memories', 'original', 'text', 'ideas', 'visuals', 'head', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'answers', 'thumbs', 'way', 'yes', 'purists', 'have', 'dissed', 'film', 'anyone', 'more', 'casual', 'approach', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'version', 'book', 'TV', 'series', 'shame', 'ways', 'length', 'imho', 'great', 'introduction', 'rather', 'mind-expanding', 'ideas', 'most', 'are', 'still', 'present', 'years', 'who', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'pondered', 'seriously', 'answer', 'question', 'What', 'meaning', 'life', '42', 'course.This', 'film', 'version', 'original', 'book', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'unfamiliar', 'whole', 'concept', 'condensed', 'movie-movie', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'end', 'even', 'wind', 'up', 'asking', 'what', 'bleep', 'been', 'going', 'version', 'good', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'one', 'must', 'buy', 'DVD', 'aside', 'extras', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'long', 'ago', 'saw', 'TV', 'series', 'jury', 'may', 'be', 'out', 'taste', 'expectations', 'Having', 'had', 'fond', 'memories', 'long-distant', 'book', 'not', 'too', 'favorable', 'feelings', 'TV', 'series', 'really', 'liked', 'brought', 'back', 'short', 'time', 'lot', 'what', 'impressed', 'younger', 'dayz.The', 'movie', 'story', 'everyman', 'suddenly', 'swept', 'up', 'cosmic', 'adventure', 'where', 'most', 'strange', 'things', 'where', 'true', 'nature', 'universe', 'revealed', 'piece', 'piece', 'beginning', 'titles', 'sequences', 'dolphins', 'catchy', 'So', 'Long', 'Thanks', 'Fish', 'song', 'are', 'perfect', 'short', 'time', 'hero', 'sent', 'wild', 'ride', 'constantly', 'changing', 'characters', 'settings', 'done', 'extremely', 'good', 'CGI', 'bulk', 'film', 'down', 'parts', 'totally', 'confusing', 'weird', 'weird', 'sake', 'others', 'overall', 'even', 'caveman', 'can', 'do', 'get', 'main', 'gist', 'here', 'end', 'ending', 'quick', 'montage', 'replaying', 'fish', 'song', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better.Fans', 'serious', 'sci-fi', 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'much', 'more', 'work', 'fantasy', 'however', 'two', 'genres', 'often', 'interact', 'really', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'level', 'even', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'times', 'satisfy', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'carp', 'Truth', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'fantasy', 'fan', 'mixture', 'here', 'up', 'fun', 'experience', 'what', 'think', 'most', 'important', 'feature', 'movie', 'and/or', 'DVD', 'like', 'first', 'viewing', ""'ll"", 'want', 'own', 'thing', 'watch', 'parts', 'again', 'again.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'not', 'perfect', 'music', 'good', 'especially', 'title', 'ending', 'song', 'actors', 'here', 'do', 'subtle', 'effective', 'job', 'standout', 'being', 'wholesome', 'babe', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'constantly', 'depressed', 'robot', 'also', 'consistenly', 'funny', 'till', 'end', 'way', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'totally', 'weird', 'world', 'galaxy', 'universe', 'be', 'precise', 'seeing', 'wonders', 'madness', 'first', 'person', 'third', 'second', 'guess', 'somewhere', 'way', 'meeting', 'existing', 'alongside', 'many', 'strange', 'characters', 'things', 'beginning', 'end.This', 'film', 'works', 'long', 'run', 'never', 'really', 'too', 'seriously', 'just', 'book', 'general', 'original', 'thesis', 'are', 'tiny', 'little', 'insignificant', 'organisms', 'greater', 'cosmos', 'one', 'almost', 'anything', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'reality', 'semi-serious', 'wacky', 'real', 'understanding', 'way', 'was', 'rather', 'torn', 'giving', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'Four', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'appropriate', 'not', 'everyone', 'might', 'get', 'what', 'are', 'slow', 'spots', 'going', 'back', 'expectations', 'film', 'really', 'multi-levels', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'ideas', 'more', 'casual', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'may', 'deal', 'book', 'original', 'material', 'much', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'condensed', 'version', 'just', 'best', 'had', 'hoped', 'studio', 'system', 'entertaining', 'period', 'beginning', 'end', 'aside', 'minor', 'flaws', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'one', 'best', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'efforts', 'Hollywood', 'long', 'long', 'time']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition
638950,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JO28,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 5]","I have never read the book.Because of this, I will be unable to tell you if the film does justice to the book. I can tell you the screenplay was written by Douglas Adams before he died. It is probably as close to the vision of the writer as a fan could hope.I can also tell you that I expected the film to be much funnier.Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman, BBC's ""The Office"") wakes up one morning to find bulldozers ready to demolish his small home in the English countryside. They need to make way for a new thoroughfare. His friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), shows up and tries to convince him that the demolition of his home is the least of his worries. Just as the Vogons, an alien race, demolish the planet Earth to make way for an intergalactic thoroughfare, Ford grabs Arthur and they hitch a ride on one of the Alien crafts. Arthur soon realizes that his friend is an alien. Ford hands Arthur ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", a sort of interactive road map and they set off to find a way off the alien vessel before they are caught. Soon, they meet Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), the President of the Galaxy and his new girlfriend, Trilliam (Zooey Deschanel) and hitch a ride for the adventure of a lifetime.I went to see the film with a big fan of the books. He was, apparently, quite satisfied with this film version. It has a very Monty Python-esque air about it; filled with wacky characters, a story that careens from one point to the next, creating a ride much like a pinball machine and settings that are very unusual. All of the ships and planets they visit are strange and interesting. In particular, the ship Beeblebrox and Trilliam are using, is a strange one and unlike anything depicted in film before. It has the ability to jump from one area to the next, but as it does so, it quickly changes into a series of non-sensical objects. The passengers on the ships are also changed momentarily, before everything returns to normal. At one point, everything is turned into knitted toys. When one of the passengers feels nauseous, they throw up yarn. This adds a unique, fun element to the story.Easily, the most unusual character is Humma Kavula, Beeblebrox's opponent in the recent election for President of the Galaxy. The character is played by John Malkovich and he appears to be channeling the spirit of Christopher Lloyd. This is the type of role that Lloyd used to play, during his heyday, in the ""Back to the Future"" films and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" It is a strange character, and essentially, a quick cameo, so it is odd that Malkovich would decide to participate. Perhaps, he is a huge fan of the books as well. He doesn't add a lot to the role. Alan Rickman voices the character of Marvin, the robot. He does a fantastic job of bringing life to the depressed robot. Helen Mirren also provides a voice.One of the more successful aspects of the film is the actual guide itself. A sort of large PDA, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is an interactive book, used by Dent and Ford, to navigate their journey. Ford gives it to Dent, presumably to help him deal with all of the weird things happening to them. Why he gives it away, instead of using it himself, is not really made clear. As they proceed, the film is interspersed with quick looks at the book. The table of contents quickly shuffles to the correct subject and we watch a brief graphic illustration of something we need to know as we continue the journey. These illustrations and the narration by Stephen Fry are very amusing and well-done. The graphics appear like something a `hip' ad agency might have created in the late 80s. It is a very unique look and keeps the story moving at a fast pace.The beginning of the film, set in a small English town, instantly brought back memories of ""Time Bandits'. It almost seemed as though the young boy in that film had grown up to be Arthur Dent in ""Hitchhiker's"". He has to deal with the same sort of crazy people, because he lives in a small town, and because he lives on Earth. Then he is pulled out of this world into a strange and unusual place. The beginning is very funny, as we watch Dent and Ford deal with the British locals. As the film progresses and the action moves into outer space, the laughs seem stuck on Earth. The action just doesn't translate into the type of wacky laughs the filmmakers were hoping for, you know, the type of laughs that ""Time Bandits"" generated. Sam Rockwell tries really hard, too hard, to get laughs. He mugs for the camera incessantly. Deschanel tries to create a character, making her seem more real than most. After getting the story going, and propelling Dent into the action, Ford, as played by Mos Def, becomes a sort of bystander, contributing little except to stand by Dent's side. As Dent, Freeman, a very funny guy, doesn't do a lot except look googly-eyed at everything going on. His character is much more interesting when he is on Earth. As soon as he becomes the center of a vortex of events in outer space, he gets lost.There is a nice subplot involving Dent and Trilliam. He actually met Tricia (her name on Earth) at a costume party. Just as he was getting to know her, some jerk pretending to be President of the Universe, moved in and swept her off her feet. It is a nice touch and Deschanel's character has a slight edge to it. She seems ready for any adventure.Each of the places they visit is created with a great eye to detail and they seem particularly believable. A lot of work clearly went into the special effects and the production design.As the visual elements take over, they almost seem to overpower the actual story. During the second act, as the action moves into outer space, the story becomes more of a race. How do we get from this point to this point, as quickly as possible? What they leave behind is a discernible amount of character development and the jovial air established during the beginning of the film. This air, so essential to comedy, returns a bit during the end, making its disappearance all the more noticeable.",3,"Great Visual Detail, But I Was Expecting More Laughs",1114992000,"05 2,

The changes to Douglas Adams' admittedly constantly evolving and mutating storyline are not so much the problem, although the absence of Restaurant at the End of the Universe, the B-Ark and, most importantly, the ultimate question to the ultimate answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is keenly felt. Even the fact that the script often loses the punchlines to the jokes in its efforts to bring the plot down to a manageable length doesn't deliver the coup de grace. Rather it's the casting that's such a problem, with Martin Freeman a particularly inadequate Arthur Dent (yes, Dent is an inadequate character, but that's no reason to cast an inadequate actor who seems even more lost on the big screen than the small), Mos Def a mumbling and uncharismatic Ford Prefect (thankfully the DVD comes with subtitles) who seems oblivious to the notion of comic timing, Sam Rockwell gives another of his trying-too-hard-to-be-funny performances as Zephod Beeblebrox and Bill Nighy is comprehensively underwhelming as Slartibartfast. Even the seemingly ideal casting of Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android falls flat, but then, ironically for something that started its life on radio, none of the vocal delivery in the film is particularly good.But it's not all bad news: the opening dolphin musical number, So Long and Thanks For All the Fish is fun, the visit to the Vogon's grimly bureaucratic homeworld has its moments, the falling whale has it's brief moment of sentient glory and the factory floor sequences on Magrathea are genuinely visually stunning. But there's still the feeling that for those in the know it's a trip that wasn't particularly necessary while the uninitiated will probably be left wondering what all the fuss is about as yet another joke falls almost as flat as a thermonuclear device that has suddenly found itself turned into a whale in midair. 42/100.Missing the UK exclusive 63-minute documentary, the extras are disappointing - a few poor deleted scenes and two very unfunny fake out-takes and unenlightening commentary, with only Marvin's Hangman game showing much real feel for the material.",3,Was this trip really necessary?,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2391,"['film', 'books', 'stage', 'show', 'TV', 'series', 'radio', 'show', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'one', 'spin-offs', ""n't"", 'horribly', 'disappointing', 'expect', 'be', 'actually', 'ever', 'being', 'much', 'good', 'changes', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'admittedly', 'constantly', 'evolving', 'mutating', 'storyline', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'problem', 'absence', 'Restaurant', 'End', 'Universe', 'B-Ark', 'most', 'importantly', 'ultimate', 'question', 'ultimate', 'answer', 'Life', 'Universe', 'Everything', 'keenly', 'felt', 'Even', 'fact', 'script', 'often', 'punchlines', 'jokes', 'efforts', 'bring', 'plot', 'down', 'manageable', 'length', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'casting', 'problem', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'particularly', 'inadequate', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'yes', 'Dent', 'inadequate', 'character', 'reason', 'cast', 'inadequate', 'actor', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'lost', 'big', 'screen', 'small', 'Mos', 'Def', 'mumbling', 'uncharismatic', 'Ford', 'Prefect', 'thankfully', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'who', 'oblivious', 'notion', 'comic', 'timing', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'trying-too-hard-to-be-funny', 'performances', 'Zephod', 'Beeblebrox', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'comprehensively', 'underwhelming', 'Slartibartfast', 'Even', 'seemingly', 'ideal', 'casting', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'voice', 'Marvin', 'Paranoid', 'Android', 'flat', 'then', 'ironically', 'something', 'started', 'life', 'radio', 'none', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'film', 'particularly', 'good.But', 'not', 'bad', 'news', 'opening', 'dolphin', 'musical', 'number', 'So', 'Long', 'Thanks', 'Fish', 'fun', 'visit', 'Vogon', 'grimly', 'bureaucratic', 'homeworld', 'moments', 'falling', 'whale', 'brief', 'moment', 'sentient', 'glory', 'factory', 'floor', 'sequences', 'Magrathea', 'are', 'genuinely', 'visually', 'stunning', 'still', 'feeling', 'know', 'trip', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'necessary', 'uninitiated', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'fuss', 'as', 'yet', 'joke', 'almost', 'as', 'flat', 'thermonuclear', 'device', 'suddenly', 'found', 'turned', 'whale', 'midair', '42/100.Missing', 'UK', 'exclusive', '63-minute', 'documentary', 'extras', 'are', 'disappointing', 'few', 'poor', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'two', 'very', 'unfunny', 'fake', 'out-takes', 'unenlightening', 'commentary', 'only', 'Marvin', 'Hangman', 'game', 'showing', 'much', 'real', 'feel', 'material']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition
638956,A1E2POEKKLNLD9,B00005JO28,"Triniman ""Triniman""","[5, 7]","The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy2.5/5Based on the 70s BBC radio play and subsequent best-selling '70s book series, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy left me feeling somewhat indifferent. At times, it was amusing, but I'm sure much of the humour was lost on me, due to the British accents that at times were hard to decipher.If you're unfamiliar with the story, you may find the film tedious. There are parts that don't seem to make a whole lot of sense, but there's humour at every turn. Our hero Arthur Dent was whisked off Earth by best friend and alien Ford Prefect, who was undercover as a human. Dent also left without finalizing any romance with the woman he was smitten with, after meeting her briefly at a party. She ended up taking up with an outlandish character dressed up like a glam rocker from the 70s. We later learn that this dude with the oilman lingo is a major character in the film. There's so much non-stop action that we don't really get a chance to get inside the character of Arthur.The two-headed, three armed Zaphod Beeblebrox is the President of the galaxy and comes across almost like a cross between rocker David Lee Roth and President George W. Bush, especially with his southern drawl. Marvin the manically depressed Paranoid Android is also a riot, as voiced by Alan Rickman and he looks like something from Spaceballs.

638957,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JO28,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 12]","Whoever thinks of an idea of making a movie out of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' needs the brain of Douglas Adams.  As sadly Adams suddenly left us forever, it is highly unlikely that another brain like his would be soon discovered, especially in Hollywood.  And the filmed version shows it.I don't say the film is a disgrace.  How can that be when it is based on the original script written by late Douglas Adams himself?  There is ""an answer to life the universe and everything,"" and there is a whale whose brief existence in the universe would teach us something very profound.  In other words, the humor of the late genius is preserved, but not intact, for someone -- I don't name names -- someone thought it wise to change or add things to make a harmless ... no, almost harmless movie.  Which means the film just doesn't get his jokes.I don't talk about the story, which is a meaningless act after all.  I talk about the way the film's spirit was changed.  As if to conceal the merit of hearing Adam's witty sentences, they used costly CGIs to extend the film's running time, killing the imagination of the books and the radio shows.  Even the cheapy BBC TV mini-series, though a mixed bag, had a considerable amount of creative humor (the animation section, in particular).Yes, I know it is hard to translate the humor expressed by words into another media, and TV shows had already proved it.  Still the 1982 TV shows didn't rely on silly sight gags, in-jokes, parody of Star Wars, and very unnecessary romantic section.  The TV's special effects were notoriously cheesy, but that we didn't care at all.  The filmed version, however, often looks as if trying to astonish us with expensive effects (including that of Jim Henson Creature Shop).  The film's soundtrack also becomes louder, but all we need is the theme song played by simple banjo.Actors are not good.  Now we have new Arthur Dent, but the comic timing of Simon Jones is missing in Martin Freeman's overacting, and as to the casting of Mos Def in the role of Ford Prefect, I imagine the producers thought it better to take what some people call ""PC"" or ""American market"" into consideration.  Zooey Deschanel as Trillan is not bad; it's just her role is pointless, for she provides only obligatory love interest while we all know that we don't need it.  It is true that two heads of Zaphod Beeblebrox look more convincing than TV series, but Sam Rockwell often seems at a loss how to play the part, which is gradually reduced to a silly, literally brainless role as the film goes on.You may become a fan of Douglas Adams after watching the film, but by that time you will realise that the best way to enjoy his world is to listen to the radio shows, or to read his books.  Flawed as it is, BBC TV series would also do.  But not this one, for which Adams had long waited.  If the entire universe is what Adams described in his guide, then, like Deep Thought, he must have known that 20 years in production hell is not long enough.",2,"Without Douglas Adams and His Imagination, What's the Point of Making Filmed Version?",1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,3008,"['Whoever', 'idea', 'making', 'movie', ""'The"", 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'brain', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'sadly', 'Adams', 'suddenly', 'left', 'forever', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'brain', 'would', 'be', 'soon', 'discovered', 'especially', 'Hollywood', 'filmed', 'version', 'shows', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'disgrace', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'based', 'original', 'script', 'written', 'late', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'answer', 'life', 'universe', 'everything', 'whale', 'brief', 'existence', 'universe', 'would', 'teach', 'something', 'very', 'profound', 'other', 'words', 'humor', 'late', 'genius', 'preserved', 'not', 'intact', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'name', 'names', 'someone', 'thought', 'wise', 'change', 'add', 'things', 'make', 'harmless', 'almost', 'harmless', 'movie', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'jokes.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'story', 'meaningless', 'act', 'talk', 'way', 'film', 'spirit', 'was', 'changed', 'conceal', 'merit', 'hearing', 'Adam', 'witty', 'sentences', 'used', 'costly', 'CGIs', 'extend', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'killing', 'imagination', 'books', 'radio', 'Even', 'cheapy', 'BBC', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'mixed', 'bag', 'had', 'considerable', 'amount', 'creative', 'humor', 'animation', 'section', 'particular', '.Yes', 'know', 'hard', 'translate', 'humor', 'expressed', 'words', 'media', 'TV', 'shows', 'had', 'already', 'proved', 'Still', '1982', 'TV', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'silly', 'sight', 'gags', 'in-jokes', 'parody', 'Star', 'Wars', 'very', 'unnecessary', 'romantic', 'section', 'TV', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'notoriously', 'cheesy', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'filmed', 'version', 'however', 'often', 'trying', 'astonish', 'expensive', 'effects', 'including', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Creature', 'Shop', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'louder', 'need', 'theme', 'song', 'played', 'simple', 'banjo.Actors', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'Now', 'have', 'new', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'comic', 'timing', 'Simon', 'Jones', 'missing', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'overacting', 'casting', 'Mos', 'Def', 'role', 'Ford', 'Prefect', 'imagine', 'producers', 'thought', 'better', 'take', 'what', 'people', 'call', 'PC', 'American', 'market', 'consideration', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Trillan', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'role', 'pointless', 'only', 'obligatory', 'love', 'interest', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'true', 'two', 'heads', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'look', 'more', 'convincing', 'TV', 'series', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'often', 'loss', 'how', 'play', 'part', 'gradually', 'reduced', 'silly', 'literally', 'brainless', 'role', 'film', 'on.You', 'may', 'become', 'fan', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'watching', 'film', 'time', 'will', 'realise', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'world', 'listen', 'radio', 'read', 'books', 'Flawed', 'BBC', 'TV', 'series', 'would', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'one', 'Adams', 'had', 'long', 'waited', 'entire', 'universe', 'what', 'Adams', 'described', 'guide', 'then', 'Deep', 'Thought', 'must', 'have', 'known', '20', 'years', 'production', 'hell', 'not', 'long', 'enough']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

Before doing so, I also made sure I read the book, knowing ahead of time that each adaptation of the witty, semi-story has been different. Then I proceeded to the cinema to see what would be in store.I was rather impressed. There are several things done in the feature film that have no connection to the books at all. Also, movie is full of cutting-edge special effects that sometimes give the film a surreal feel. Nevertheless, the &#34;spirit&#34; or in this case (since Adams was such a strong atheist), &#34;temporary lifeforce&#34; of the novel remains intact. The movie remains faithful to the original sketchy story. Of course, die hard loyalist will claim the movie does no such thing. What many who complain forget is that a movie and a book are two totally different forms of media. Very rare is it that a motion picture can successfully turn out exactly like the book on which it is based.But I digress and should get back on track before the bulldozers come. HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE OF THE GALAXY will offend some (it does make a sarcastic examination of religion, especially Christianity), younger children will not understand much of the humor, and overzealous fans will find it &#34;too different&#34; from whatever incarnation of the story they have come to know and love.

638959,A1ZWNTA6Q968U2,B00005JO28,Tyrel_Roo,"[2, 2]","So. The movie's getting a lot of bad press by folks saying that the movie is nothing like the books.DUH. You can't go to a movie based on a book and expect the book, for the simple fact that it's a movie.Besides, I find that the people who are griping about it tend to be completely ignorant about the story's history. You see, the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" story was originally a BBC radio series, and following this incarnation has been a set of five books, a video game, a BBC television miniseries, and most recently another BBC radio series and the big-budget movie I'm reviewing.My point is that I have seen the BBC series, read all of the books, played the game, and heard the radio series. There are some huge differences from one version to the other. Events happen in different orders, things happen differently, and there are some things in the books that simply do not happen in the radio series, and vice versa. Characters behave differently.My other point is that you don't have to experience all of the story's different incarnations to know this. All you have to do is pick up any copy of the first book and read the introduction. Adams was always the first to say that there were contradictions and inconsistencies.  In other words, you have to be painfully ignorant to be a fan of the books and still complain about any inconsistencies in the movie.Anyway, on with my review.It was good. Everything was designed beautifully, Mos Def played a better Ford than I thought he would, and it was just overall a very good ride.However, it's not perfect.Adams, before his untimely death in 2001, went through many drafts for a screenplay before arriving at the one that was used for the movie.I think that, considering that the first audience was going to be largely American, he tried to overcompensate by altering much of the humor to fit what would be expected by us. There are no sex and fart jokes, thank god, but it's still different. What I found most disappointing was the fact that the movie is no different from many other modern ""comedies"", in that it is hilarious for about thirty minutes and becomes serious the rest of the way.(I even found ""Meet the Parents"" to be guilty of this--a decent movie, yes, but hardly a comedy.)In other words, much of the British humor that made the radio series and books so wonderful is lost. This isn't unique to the movie, though, because if you read the books you'll notice that Adams get kind of preachy and not quite as funny as he gets towards the end of the ""trilogy"".There is an entire extra sub-plot that doesn't exist in the books, the BBC movie, or the radio series. However, there is nothing wrong with this, because the plots of the aforementioned incarnations are often wildly different anyway, and so differences are to be expected.Overall, it was a good movie. However, it was wildly different from any of the previous incarnations of the story, and perhaps a little too Americanized.I give it four out of five stars, thinking that, perhaps, some things are better left out of Hollywood.",4,Be informed before you watch ...,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,3068,"['So', 'movie', 'getting', 'lot', 'bad', 'press', 'folks', 'saying', 'movie', 'nothing', 'books.DUH', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'expect', 'book', 'simple', 'fact', 'movie.Besides', 'find', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'griping', 'tend', 'be', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'story', 'history', 'see', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'story', 'was', 'originally', 'BBC', 'radio', 'series', 'following', 'incarnation', 'been', 'set', 'five', 'books', 'video', 'game', 'BBC', 'television', 'miniseries', 'most', 'recently', 'BBC', 'radio', 'series', 'big-budget', 'movie', ""'m"", 'reviewing.My', 'point', 'have', 'seen', 'BBC', 'series', 'read', 'books', 'played', 'game', 'heard', 'radio', 'series', 'are', 'huge', 'differences', 'one', 'version', 'other', 'Events', 'happen', 'different', 'orders', 'things', 'happen', 'differently', 'are', 'things', 'books', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'happen', 'radio', 'series', 'vice', 'versa', 'Characters', 'behave', 'other', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'story', 'different', 'incarnations', 'know', 'have', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'first', 'book', 'read', 'introduction', 'Adams', 'was', 'always', 'first', 'say', 'were', 'contradictions', 'inconsistencies', 'other', 'words', 'have', 'be', 'painfully', 'ignorant', 'be', 'fan', 'books', 'still', 'complain', 'inconsistencies', 'movie.Anyway', 'review.It', 'was', 'good', 'Everything', 'was', 'designed', 'beautifully', 'Mos', 'Def', 'played', 'better', 'Ford', 'thought', 'would', 'was', 'just', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'ride.However', 'not', 'perfect.Adams', 'untimely', 'death', '2001', 'went', 'many', 'drafts', 'screenplay', 'arriving', 'one', 'was', 'used', 'movie.I', 'think', 'considering', 'first', 'audience', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'largely', 'American', 'tried', 'overcompensate', 'altering', 'much', 'humor', 'fit', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'are', 'sex', 'fart', 'jokes', 'thank', 'god', 'still', 'different', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'disappointing', 'was', 'fact', 'movie', 'different', 'many', 'other', 'modern', 'comedies', 'hilarious', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'serious', 'rest', 'way', 'even', 'found', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'be', 'guilty', 'decent', 'movie', 'yes', 'hardly', 'comedy', 'other', 'words', 'much', 'British', 'humor', 'made', 'radio', 'series', 'books', 'so', 'wonderful', 'lost', ""n't"", 'unique', 'movie', 'though', 'read', 'books', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'Adams', 'get', 'kind', 'preachy', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'end', 'trilogy', 'entire', 'extra', 'sub-plot', ""n't"", 'exist', 'books', 'BBC', 'movie', 'radio', 'series', 'However', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'plots', 'aforementioned', 'incarnations', 'are', 'often', 'wildly', 'different', 'anyway', 'so', 'differences', 'are', 'be', 'expected.Overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'However', 'was', 'wildly', 'different', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'story', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'Americanized.I', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'thinking', 'perhaps', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'out', 'Hollywood']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

The two hours went by quickly and I laughed out loud many times, as did the rest of the audience. Many of the gags in the film come straight from the original book, which was a wonderful deja vu experience and I found my memory jolted into remembering gags from the book just as the movie was launching into them.I won't bother to go over the plot as many other reviews here already do that. I will say that the acting and direction were entirely adequate if not spectacular and the story held together surpisingly well considering how much the characters and the film ""jump"" around. For the sake of the cinematic medium and the sanity and enjoyment of people who haven't read the books, some aspects of the film are different than the book, but the nub of what Adams was trying to say in his book and the humorous manner in which he said it are present in the film.

Mostly in shots where the background was far off. On the whole, the picture quality was quite good. There's a fair amount of noise/grain but not enough to be distracting. I hate noise and I hate DNR just as much.(Viewed on a 55&#34; Samsung LED 8000 series TV.)Audio: 3.8 out of 5. There were several scenes that the dialog became a little difficult to distinguish but not to the point that I felt making adjustments to my receiver would be needed. Surround effects are fairly seamless. I thought the high end was somewhat lacking. Had a slight muddiness to the sound especially the dialog. Likely due to the Multicannel PCM sound signal. It's fair but by no means great. About 10 minutes in, I set my receiver to Dolby Digital EX. That gave it a good deal of improvement in clarity but at a slight loss to the surround effects.

I was one of the faithful who noticed places where lines used to be (""Ah, obviously some new meaning of the word 'safe' that I was unaware of"")but there is so much that is new and wonderful that it doesn't matter.  First, Garth Jennings seems (now) to be the perfect choice to helm HHGTTG.  He gets it.  He gets it in the words and he gets it in the visuals.  May he rest in peace, I really can't believe that Douglas Adams would be unhappy with what is on the screen.  I mean, look at those Vogons.  That's not your standard done-in-computer work.  Those are real Henson Creation puppets, and they're amazing. -- Look at Mos Def and Sam Rockwell and Martin Freeman and ... gulp ... sigh ... Zooey Deschanel.  Oh, and Bill Nighy.  Casting that is, now, seemingly the only logical choice.  -- I think what works so well with this cinematic adaptation is the loving look back while retaining sensibilities of 21st century special-effects film making.  This movie retains all the intelligence and sympathies of the great Adams book and the clunkily lovable TV adaptation.  And, it's a wonder to behold.  -- It's easy to armchair quarterback this movie and point out all the things the movie omits or doesn't do ... but I think HHGTTG opens windows while shutting doors (so to speak) and the result is a worthy addition to the accumulated sum of the Hitchhiker's canon.

638970,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B00005JO28,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[10, 16]","I was given to understand that Douglas Adams was not much-interested in a big-screen version of THGttG, as there was not a lot more that could be done with it. Why he decided to write and produce a movie version -- other than money -- is  not clear. It's fortunate for his reputation that he died before the film was released. Everything wrong with it can be blamed -- with near-certain certainty -- on the far less talented ""others"" who screwed up one of the great comic works of the 20th century.The original THGttG was a radio program. Though radio is arguably the most ""visual"" of all media (think about that before you object), it is principally a medium of words. You're supposed to pay attention to what the people are saying, and Douglas Adams' scripts amply rewarded that attention with alternately witty and nonsensical dialog and situations. The TV version had no problem mating Douglas' words with a visual presentation.The movie's fundamental problem is that it doesn't trust the audience with a rambling, picaresque story. Instead, it tries to assemble a coherent narrative having a beginning, a middle, and end, culminating in a more-or-less happy romantic ending.I could have tolerated the changes (there's no reason the movie has to be identical to the radio show, novels, or video version), but it's that awful sentimental ending -- which jettisons the revelation of the Ultimate Question -- that ruins everything.Adams' original story had the characters wandering from one crazy situation to another, but it did build to a payoff -- the existential view that the universe is fundamentally screwed up -- that we are not here for any reason, and life has no real purpose or meaning. Deleting this -- especially as it has been carefully set up -- is a shock. The ultimate ""point"" of the story -- that there's no point to anything -- has been castrated.I can understand the director wanting to focus on the visuals and avoid ""talking heads"", but barely half (likely less) of Adams' original script remains. Many of the missing pieces were needed for character development; the film's characters are people we don't get to know very well.It doesn't help that Karey Kirkpatrick's script contributions are almost exactly unlike Douglas Adams' writing. The jumps between the two -- as when Arthur is telling the mice why they shouldn't cut out his brain -- are downright jarring. It doesn't help that KK's writing doesn't come within a parsec of Adams's style or wit.The casting is not so much poor as inappropriate. Sam Rockwell pretty much -- uh -- nails Zaphod (and has the thighs you'd expect someone described as delivering ""the best bang since the Big one"" to have), but Martin Freeman can't turn ""I never could get the hang of Thursdays"" into a convincing line, and no one else -- not even Helen Mirren or John Malkovich -- makes much of an impression. Alan Rickman is merely ""okay"" as Marvin. Except for Rockwell's, the performances make me long for the originals.The special effects are exceptional, and don't overwhelm the actors. I especially like the one when Arthur crushes the mice (they scamper off in the original); I won't spoil it for those who insist on seeing this film.Don't be the fool I was. Buy the TV version, with its deliciously cheesy special effects (which are all the more fun because Adams wrote the radio version without any regard to visual practicality), and share and enjoy the ""real"" THGttG with your friends.

After seeing it in the theater on opening day, I thought the movie was well-cast, well-acted and well-produced. The visual effects were great (and I even like how they reinterpreted Zaphod's two-headed aspect using minimal, yet non-cheesy looking effects). And Zooey Deschanel is hot.But as the movie came to a close, it became achingly clear that there is no possible way a normal two-hour movie could really do the book justice, despite all the great things about it. Even though it has been years since I last read the book, I realized as I was watching this movie that so many things that made the book great were edited out of the movie. This movie was hacked to pieces! If everything had been included in this movie, it would have doubled or tripled the run-time, which would just not have been commercial and therefore would have made this movie's release inconceivable.I left the theater wishing that I had recently re-read the book to fill in the many blanks I felt from watching this movie. So I plan to re-read the book immediately before renting the movie for one final viewing. And hopefully the deleted scenes will fill in a few more gaps.If you're reading this and haven't yet read the book, my suggestion is to read the book before watching the movie, just to see how other imaginations have interpreted parts of the book.

Forget the poor multi-plotline, and just let the jokes and elaborate sets, special effects, and costumes/alien designs to captivate you, than you will have a fun ride. This is not bad for sci-fi comedy after all, and it does have plenty of so-so funny moments. But it neglects to be suspenseful and intense for the most part, making it less interesting to follow.Out of all the main characters, I only found Sam Rockwell(Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy) and John Malkovich(Humma Kavula, leader of one of the planets) to be well portrayed. Unfortunately, Malkovich's comical performance of the half human and robot only had less than 10 minutes of screentime. The whole love triangle plot involving Beeblebrox, Arthur(Martin Freeman ), and Trillian(Zooey Deschanel ) was so misfit in the overall story that it was a waste of time. The double-head trick of Beeblebrox is funny at first, but it just repeated to many times. It's nice to see Rockwell playing a goofy role so different from Confessions of Dangerous Mind.The dispute between the Beetlebrox's gang and the Vogans(very ugly and nasty aliens) is kind of lame. While there were close-ups of the creatures, they looked kind of fake.The scene when Alan Rickman(a universal architec) took Arthur for a tour of the Earth in remake was visually stimulating.I was disappointed that two of England's finest actors Helen Mirren and Stephen Fry just did voice-over work, and didn't have  visible roles. I thought the performances from Zooey Deschanel and Martin Freeman were mediocre, and their roles shouldn't have dominated so much screentime.Finally, the film ended loosely as if the viewers are supposed to assume the outcomes of some the unfinished events, or that it's saved for a possible sequel.",3,Funny and Visually Exciting Sci-fi Experience.,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,1871,"['Good', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'be', 'serious', 'so', 'cheessy', 'actually', 'good', 'Forget', 'poor', 'multi-plotline', 'just', 'let', 'jokes', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'costumes/alien', 'designs', 'captivate', 'will', 'have', 'fun', 'ride', 'not', 'bad', 'sci-fi', 'comedy', 'have', 'plenty', 'so-so', 'funny', 'moments', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'intense', 'most', 'part', 'making', 'less', 'interesting', 'follow.Out', 'main', 'characters', 'only', 'found', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'President', 'Galaxy', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Humma', 'Kavula', 'leader', 'one', 'planets', 'be', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Unfortunately', 'Malkovich', 'comical', 'performance', 'half', 'human', 'only', 'had', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'whole', 'love', 'triangle', 'plot', 'involving', 'Beeblebrox', 'Arthur', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Trillian', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'was', 'so', 'misfit', 'overall', 'story', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'double-head', 'trick', 'Beeblebrox', 'funny', 'first', 'just', 'repeated', 'many', 'times', 'nice', 'see', 'Rockwell', 'playing', 'goofy', 'role', 'so', 'different', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind.The', 'dispute', 'Beetlebrox', 'gang', 'Vogans', 'very', 'ugly', 'nasty', 'aliens', 'kind', 'lame', 'were', 'close-ups', 'creatures', 'looked', 'kind', 'fake.The', 'scene', 'when', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'universal', 'architec', 'took', 'Arthur', 'tour', 'Earth', 'remake', 'was', 'visually', 'stimulating.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'two', 'England', 'finest', 'actors', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'just', 'did', 'voice-over', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'visible', 'roles', 'thought', 'performances', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'were', 'mediocre', 'roles', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'dominated', 'so', 'much', 'screentime.Finally', 'film', 'ended', 'loosely', 'viewers', 'are', 'supposed', 'assume', 'outcomes', 'unfinished', 'events', 'saved', 'possible', 'sequel']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

Something about them plugged perfectly into the world's feeling that everything really would make sense some day, as long as you ignored all the big words in the explanations.This movie puts on a grand display of the Hitchhiker series. It's filled with little in-jokes - doesn't Zaphod sound a lot like our Dubya, and isn't that robot in the waiting room just a bit familiar to BBC watchers? The Vogon fleet is impressive, in flight as well as on the ground. Maybe the whole ""saving Trillian"" thing was injected to bring the script into line woth movie standards, and the romantic mooning was pasted on rather ineptly. (Douglas Adams' idea of mooning would probably have been very different.)A great display, as I said, but the book was never about great things. The movie is vaguely true to the increasingly-ill-named trilogy, but somehow lost all the little asides and throw-away lines that made the books sparkle. Even that BBC series, with its Dr. Who level of effects, did a better job with Adams' perpetual and literate sense that everything was almost, but not quite what it was supposed to be.Did I say ""literate""?

I can remember people cracking jokes out of this book, and talking about ""42"".  Its kind of like Monty python to many of the band and drama people of high school would blab about.  Well, I never read the book, tried, but lost interest within the first couple sections.  So I though I'd finally check out the movie. Lately movies have been sticking closer to a books original story line.  And guess what, its still as dumb as it was when I was younger. Just don't care for the humor. I can see how true fans of the book are bashing this film, it so short and jumpy, i can imagine how much it must have cut out of the orininal tale.  And it ended so abruptly, what the heck about the second head, and the gun...oh wait, who cares is the ultimate question.  42 is the answer....some 42 year old virgin sitting in his parents basement with their star wars collection (or star trek) quoting monty python and talking about band camp.  I would have to say get the book, at least you are reading and building an imagination, this movie is just not good.",3,My guess is that you should read the book.,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,1128,"['was', 'book', 'geeks', 'nerds', 'middle', 'school', 'read', 'back', 'mid', '80', 'can', 'remember', 'people', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'book', 'talking', '42', 'kind', 'like', 'Monty', 'python', 'many', 'band', 'drama', 'people', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'blab', 'Well', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'tried', 'lost', 'interest', 'first', 'couple', 'sections', 'So', ""'d"", 'finally', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'Lately', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'sticking', 'closer', 'books', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'guess', 'what', 'still', 'as', 'dumb', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'humor', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'true', 'fans', 'book', 'are', 'bashing', 'film', 'so', 'short', 'jumpy', 'i', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'must', 'have', 'cut', 'orininal', 'tale', 'ended', 'so', 'abruptly', 'what', 'heck', 'second', 'head', 'gun', 'oh', 'wait', 'who', 'ultimate', 'question', '42', 'answer', '42', 'year', 'old', 'virgin', 'sitting', 'parents', 'basement', 'star', 'wars', 'collection', 'star', 'trek', 'quoting', 'monty', 'python', 'talking', 'band', 'camp', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'get', 'book', 'least', 'are', 'reading', 'building', 'imagination', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'good']",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

""xan_i""","[2, 3]","The uninitiated to the Hitchhiker's Guide universe probably won't get this movie, and those of us who have followed the series for the past thirty years or so will feel let down.The biggest problem this movie faces is that characters were already created for the BBC TV series, which was pretty much cast from the original radio production.  Because we know and like the characters just the way they are, casting new actors is not an easy task.  We also know and love the original story, and it takes a Disneyian effort to completely redo the intent and outcome of an established story.  Just look at what they did to Pocahontas and The Little Mermaid.  (Historically, things didn't turn out so well for Pocahontas, and The Little Mermaid turns into sea foam in the original story.)Some other problems with the movie:1 - Zaphod Beeblebrox has 2 heads!  Not a flip-top head, he has two heads!  Other than that, Sam Rockwell was a good Zaphod.2 - There is no love story between Arthur and Trillian.  In the books, she stays with Zaphod until she gets sick of him, then hooks up with the god Thor at a party.  Her interest in Arthur...and Arthur's interest in her, for the most part is just friendly.  This is what was so great about the books.  Arthur was an ""everyman"" whose mediocrity managed to get him along in life and save the universe a couple of times.  He met a girl at a party who wasn't interested in him, and runs into her after the Earth has been destroyed and she's still not interested.  Arthur didn't seem to care because he was more interested in where he could get a good cup of tea.  Come on Disney, not EVERY movie needs to revolve around a love story!!3 - Marvin is depressed, not sad.  Big difference.  He is also tall and metal, not a small, plastic, and cute.4 - The Heart of Gold is supposed to look like a sleek running shoe, not a eyeball.5 - Every character pretty much mumbles their way through this movie.  Between Zooey and Mos Def, you need subtitles to finish it.6 - Mos Def is not a good Ford Prefect. He's good in other things, but not in this.I guess the biggest problem this movie has going for it is that it isn't based on a book, it's based on a BBC TV series that is based on a book which is based on a radio play.  It would be different if we didn't already know all of the characters and how they're supposed to act, but we do.  It would be a bit like reforming Led Zeppelin with kids from American Idol.  Sure they're talented, but it's not the same.If you can put all of that aside, and think of it as ""A Funny Space Adventure Movie"" and not ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", it is a fun show.
