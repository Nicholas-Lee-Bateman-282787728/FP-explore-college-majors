273951,A255UDDF8IAB81,6301948106,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This film would be okay for grade school kids.  Parts might be unsettling to preschool and younger grade school.  Older than grade school would probably find it boring.  There's not much to keep adults engaged as well.  The humor is corny and seemed to miss the younger audience, but not going to entertain the older.  The story line was hard to digest.  There were too many things the characters did that made no sense.  There's magic in it, so the audience is supposed to suspend belief, however, it was still too hard to believe the characters went along with each scenario when there were too many other choices that might have made some sense.Of course, it's ridiculous to analyze a children's film.  This just seemed too far fetched, even within a ridiculous children's film.  I can't say many Disney films made around this time were well made.  It seemed they were trying to appeal to an older child audience, but missed the mark.  The portrayal of Middle Easterns wouldn't have made it in today's films; very dated and mildly racist.If your kids really want to see this, you may want to find something else to do.  It won't harm them to watch it, but it won't enhance their scope of what entertainment is either.Topics to talk about with your kids afterwards could be:What would you wish for if you found a magic lamp?What other options did you see the characters have?  What choices would you have made?What ethnicity were the two villains?  Do you think all Middle Eastern people act that way?  Why or why not?(Then have a follow up discussion, or watch other films were Middle Eastern people are more accurately portrayed and ask about the differences.  Maybe ""Sinbad"" or religious films, the Wise Men are Middle Eastern.)",3,Okay at best,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1733,"['film', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'grade', 'school', 'kids', 'Parts', 'might', 'be', 'unsettling', 'preschool', 'younger', 'grade', 'school', 'Older', 'grade', 'school', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'boring', 'not', 'much', 'keep', 'adults', 'engaged', 'as', 'well', 'humor', 'corny', 'seemed', 'miss', 'younger', 'audience', 'not', 'going', 'entertain', 'older', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'hard', 'digest', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'characters', 'did', 'made', 'sense', 'magic', 'audience', 'supposed', 'suspend', 'belief', 'however', 'was', 'still', 'too', 'hard', 'believe', 'characters', 'went', 'scenario', 'when', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'choices', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'sense.Of', 'course', 'ridiculous', 'analyze', 'children', 'film', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'even', 'ridiculous', 'children', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'many', 'Disney', 'films', 'made', 'time', 'were', 'well', 'made', 'seemed', 'were', 'trying', 'appeal', 'older', 'child', 'audience', 'missed', 'mark', 'portrayal', 'Middle', 'Easterns', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'today', 'films', 'very', 'dated', 'mildly', 'racist.If', 'kids', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'may', 'want', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'do', 'wo', ""n't"", 'harm', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'scope', 'what', 'entertainment', 'either.Topics', 'talk', 'kids', 'afterwards', 'could', 'be', 'What', 'would', 'wish', 'found', 'magic', 'lamp', 'What', 'other', 'options', 'did', 'see', 'characters', 'have', 'What', 'choices', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'What', 'ethnicity', 'were', 'two', 'villains', 'Do', 'think', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'people', 'act', 'way', 'Why', 'why', 'not', 'Then', 'have', 'follow', 'up', 'discussion', 'watch', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'ask', 'differences', 'Maybe', 'Sinbad', 'religious', 'films', 'Wise', 'Men', 'are', 'Middle', 'Eastern']",N/A

I loved Duck Tales as a kid and so this was one of those cartoons I watched over and over.  I really does pale in comparison to `Aladdin', a film that ups the ante with stunning songs and beautifully composed animation, but there is something special about `Treasure of the Lost Lamp', especially to us fans of the characters and the classic show.  The plot has some shaky spots, but they are forgivable thanks to the nostalgia.  Above all else, `Treasure of the Lost Lamp' is fun, and fun is sometimes enough.

273953,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,6301948106,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 8]","DuckTales is always going to be one of my favorite shows. When I was 5, the first thing I'd do when I'd get home from school was sit down in front of the tv so I could watch the Disney Afternoon block of shows, which had the almighty DuckTales. And in the last couple of months, I've re-discovered the show and was glad to see that it still holds up. Smart writing, a cast of memorable characters and great adventures make for a terrific show. Soon after, I tracked down a copy of Treasure of the Lost Lamp, which was only available from Disney's movie club or through the Disney Movie Rewards program, where it's constantly out of stock. I was excited to watch this with my daughter, who's also a big DuckTales fan, since I haven't seen the movie in at least 15 years.Like many films from my childhood, this is one that I should have not re-watched.The story starts out with Scrooge and the gang searching for Collie Baba's treasure in the desert. After navigating through traps, they find the treasure, which includes an old lamp that Webby takes for herself (well, after Scrooge figures that it's probably worthless). Their guide, Dijon, takes off with a little bit of the treasure, and it's revealed that he's working for a powerful sorcerer named Merlock. When Merlock sees that Dijon didn't get the lamp, he tries to take care of Scrooge and the others with scorpions, but is unsuccessful. Everyone makes it back to Duckberg, and Webby and the boys free the genie of the lamp, and the wish making begins. Ice cream sundaes, a baby elephant, stuffed animals coming to life, all kinds of fun wishes are made, but it's not long before Merlock tracks down the lamp. He possesses a jewel that, when combined with the lamp, will allow him to have unlimited wishes instead of the usual 3. The jewel also lets him change form to any animal he wants, making for a pretty sneaky enemy. Obviously, if Merlock gets the lamp, nothing good can come from it, so it's up to Scrooge and everyone else to make sure that doesn't happen.First things first, the genie in this movie is the most annoying character in DuckTales history. Upon granting a wish, he shouts 'SHABOOEY!', and that's something I could tolerate. But it's also a word the genie uses at random, much like how the Smurfs use 'smurf' for random words too. I got sick of the genie after about five lines of dialogue. He reminded me of a knock-off of Rip Taylor, and of course, the irony was that he IS voiced by Rip Taylor. The animation in Treasure of the Lost Lamp also didn't seem as good as that of the DuckTales show for some reason. Either how a character moved would look a little choppy in some scenes, or things weren't as detailed as they should've been for a motion picture that was released theatrically. It also doesn't feel like any heart went into the story or characters, whereas I could pick any episode of the show and get something much better. It surprised me to realize how boring a lot of the plot and dialogue was, and that this was probably the only time where I didn't care about what happened to Scrooge, which is a shock considering how much I love the character now after having read The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck by Don Rosa. In fact, the only things I cared for much were Merlock's transformations (seeing him gasp as a rat actually made me laugh out loud) and there were a few smart jokes and funny names here and there, like Collie Baba. Finally, why does everyone have a brown bill? Was Disney somehow unable to use the orange-yellow paint for this movie for some reason? It was an eye sore more than anything else.The dvd didn't get much effort put into it- picture quality is below average with a lot of grain and scratches, almost like they just copied a vhs to a dvd but made it look a little sharper. The audio is just Dolby 2.0, with Spanish and French language tracks too, and English subtitles for the hearing impaired. The only special feature is a treasure finding game that you won't play more than once. No behind the scenes material, no interviews with the voice actors, no retrospective on DuckTales...just this game. Oh, the back of the box is worth a laugh, if that counts. Whoever drew Scrooge here did such a horrible job on his beard-feathers and hands that it's downright silly.It's too bad the movie bombed at the box office, as there were other DuckTales movies planned. Hopefully Disney makes another one sometime in the next couple of years, as I think if they put some effort into it, a DuckTales or Scrooge McDuck movie could really help their recent non-Pixar-aided track record. I can't recommend this movie to anyone unless they're hardcore DuckTales fans that want everything to do with the series and don't care about quality. I'll probably end up selling my copy and getting some more Carl Barks or Don Rosa comics instead.",2,Nostalgia ain't what it used to be.,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,4848,"['DuckTales', 'always',

273962,A6225HHQKBE2M,6301948106,Jake,"[10, 11]","The first of Disney's attempts to make some quick bucks from a feature based on one of their daily TV series, ""Treasure of the Lost Lamp"" sprawned from the enjoyable 80's cartoon series DuckTales and is likewise animated by the TV department.  In this big-screen goround, Scrogue McDuck (Alan Young) travels with his nephews and niece Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby (all Russi Taylor) in search of Collie Baba's legendary treasure.  They are persued in this quest by powerhungry sorcerer Merlock (Christopher Lloyd) with the reluctant assistance of his henchmen Dijon (Richard Libertini) and escape with their lives - but without most of the treasure.  The kids release a geenie in the lamp when Webby is cleaning her ""teacup"" and have fun making crazy wishes (such as turning Webby's stuffed toys into real live animals.)  But Merlock, the geenie's former master, is hot on their trail and hell-bent on reclaiming the lamp and the power of the geenie at any cost.All this plays out like a workprint version of Disney's classic ""Aladdin,"" which debuted two years after the DuckTales release, but that's not nessesarily a bad thing.  There's a lot to like about ""Treasure of the Lost Lamp,"" and a lot of fun to be had here, including many comic moments.  Also, the breezy 74-minute runtime is just right for young viewers' attention spans.  While the visiuals and somewhat choppy editing are nothing compared to the Feature Animation-created Disney efforts of the time, the movie recaptures the look, feel, and spirit of the TV show, making it good fun for fans and a very worthile watch for others.  In fact, it's best to think of this as an episode of the TV show with an extended runtime.  When you use that point of view with this film, you'll have a lot of fun following the epiosodic adventures of the characters.  The opening sequences while searching for (and finding) the treasure feel a lot like an animated Indiana Jones and it's a shame there wasn't more time put into this part of the story.All in all ""DuckTales"" provides a solid, simple and entertaining story, great vocal delivery from all the cast (most noteable in this department is Christopher Lloyd as the villian), and a lot of laughs with genuine humor behind them. Highly reccomended viewing for a lazy afternoon, but this might not stand up to repeated showings unless you're a big fan of the show.  If you are a fan, don't hesitate to buy this - you'll be pleased.  Others who just want a taste of what the show was like, this will fit the bill nicely and is suited to a rental.",5,Disney's feature-length DuckTale is a lot of fun,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,2552,"['first', 'Disney', 'attempts', 'make', 'quick', 'bucks', 'feature', 'based', 'one', 'daily', 'TV', 'series', 'Treasure', 'Lost', 'Lamp', 'sprawned', 'enjoyable', '80', 'cartoon', 'series', 'DuckTales', 'likewise', 'animated', 'TV', 'department', 'big-screen', 'goround', 'Scrogue', 'McDuck', 'Alan', 'Young', 'nephews', 'niece', 'Huey', 'Dewey', 'Louie', 'Webby', 'Russi', 'Taylor', 'search', 'Collie', 'Baba', 'legendary', 'treasure', 'are', 'persued', 'quest', 'powerhungry', 'sorcerer', 'Merlock', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'reluctant', 'assistance', 'henchmen', 'Dijon', 'Richard', 'Libertini', 'escape', 'lives', 'most', 'treasure', 'kids', 'release', 'geenie', 'lamp', 'when', 'Webby', 'cleaning', 'teacup', 'have', 'fun', 'making', 'crazy', 'wishes', 'such', 'turning', 'Webby', 'stuffed', 'real', 'live', 'animals', 'Merlock', 'geenie', 'former', 'master', 'hot', 'trail', 'hell-bent', 'reclaiming', 'lamp', 'power', 'geenie', 'cost.All', 'out', 'workprint', 'version', 'Disney', 'classic', 'Aladdin', 'debuted', 'two', 'years', 'DuckTales', 'release', 'not', 'nessesarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'lot', 'like', 'Treasure', 'Lost', 'Lamp', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'including', 'many', 'comic', 'moments', 'Also', 'breezy', '74-minute', 'runtime', 'just', 'right', 'young', 'viewers', 'attention', 'spans', 'visiuals', 'somewhat', 'choppy', 'editing', 'are', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Feature', 'Animation-created', 'Disney', 'efforts', 'time', 'movie', 'look', 'feel', 'spirit', 'TV', 'show', 'making', 'good', 'fun', 'fans', 'very', 'worthile', 'watch', 'others', 'fact', 'best', 'think', 'episode', 'TV', 'show', 'extended', 'runtime', 'When', 'use', 'point', 'view', 'film', ""'ll"", 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'following', 'epiosodic', 'adventures', 'characters', 'opening', 'sequences', 'searching', 'finding', 'treasure', 'feel', 'lot', 'animated', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'shame', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'time', 'put', 'part', 'story.All', 'DuckTales', 'solid', 'simple', 'entertaining', 'story', 'great', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'cast', 'most', 'noteable', 'department', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'villian', 'lot', 'laughs', 'genuine', 'humor', 'Highly', 'reccomended', 'viewing', 'lazy', 'afternoon', 'might', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'repeated', 'showings', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'are', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'Others', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'taste', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'nicely', 'suited', 'rental']",N/A

273965,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,6301948106,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[0, 1]","While Disney has not been producing much of high quality animated films these days, few will deny that in the late 1980's and mid 1990's, the Mouse House was in its heyday.  After a period of turmoil without their former founder, the company had risen to stardom with its 1989 musical, THE LITTLE MERMAID.  The success of that film led to other equally acclaimed masterpieces, notably BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, which was fortunate enough to win the Oscar for Best Picture.  In the period between these two works of art, though, the company released two animated features that were pleasant diversions but didn't ignite ticket sales at the box office.  One of them was THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER, a non-musical sequel to a mediocre 1970 film (which actually improved on its predecessor in many ways).  The other--and even lesser known--production was DUCKTALES:  THE MOVIE--TREASURE OF THE LOST LAMP.An unashamedly small, likeable film, DUCKTALES--THE MOVIE did not quack up much box office gold in its theatrical release.  Based on Disney's popular animated series of its time, this theatrical feature--as you might expect--plays very much like an extended episode of the series, with slightly beefed up production values.  Audiences unfamiliar with the show are most likely to be confused with its unexplained references to terms like ""Junior Woodchuck""--a problem not uncommon with other theatrical spin-offs of television shows, e.g. THE CARE BEARS, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, etc.  The stars of DUCKTALES, which include self-proclaimed ""quad-zillionaire"" Scrooge McDuck (impeccably voiced by Alan Young) and his mischievous nephews, Hewy, Dewey, and Louie, are household names with many people, but their co-stars--which include bumbling pilot Launchpad McQuack and Webby (Webbigail for you completists)--are only familiar with those who have tuned into an episode or two of the show.  This is probably what sealed DUCKTALES--THE MOVIE's box office fate; it caters more to fans of the show rather than a mainstream audience.That said, DUCKTALES--THE MOVIE is a very pleasant way to spend 74 minutes.  The film bounces along at a fast pace and maintains a kinetic sense of energy, particularly the opening and climactic sequences.  And there's nothing at all about the film that may be deemed too unsettling or inappropriate for children (what, you expected an R-rated material from Disney?).The best way to describe the plot is a mixture of INDIANA JONES adventure and Disney's own ALADDIN.  The first 20 minutes of the movie, in which the ducks--on a hunt for Collie Baba's treasure--find themselves braving a booby-trap infested hidden pyramid and outrunning scorpions, recall the roller-coaster excitement of the aforementioned Spielberg-Lucas series.  Things get slightly slower around the middle when the ducks unleash the contents of a magic lamp containing, yes, a genie.  Voiced with zest and humor by Rip Taylor, this Genie may not have the adult appeal of, say, Robin Williams' Genie in ALADDIN, but he manages to extract a giggle from the audience without being too over-the-top.  His lively presence--and the nephews' dilemma of trying to keep his identity a secret from their miserly uncle--makes it easier to sit through the middle portion.  The final 20 minutes of the film, in which Scrooge and company attempt to recapture their money bin from a compulsively greedy weasel, Dijon (Richard Libertini), only to deal with the Genie's former master, Merlock, a centuries old villainous sorcerer with the commanding voice of Christopher Lloyd, builds to a high-flying (literally) climax that I've rarely seen other Disney films match.Based on the above description of the plot, it is tempting to dismiss this movie as an inferior imitation of ALADDIN, particularly where the Genie sub-plot is concerned, but since this movie was made long before that film, it instead holds up as an original story.  Technically, DUCKTALES isn't exactly on the same level as, say, THE LITTLE MERMAID or other Disney Renaissance features, but then again it was hardly intended to be.  The animation, produced by the now defunct Disney Animation Studios in Paris, is appropriately matched and showcases some spectacularly exciting effects, particularly any moment when Merlock morphs into eagles, rats, bears, cockroaches, panthers, etc., and especially at the climax when Scrooge's money bin is transformed into a creepy-looking castle.  Simultaneously, though, the artwork is more ""simplified"" than the usual Disney treatment--not that it is a bad thing for this type of feature, but it's noticeable in places.More pleasing about the film is its kinetic musical score, composed by David Newman (THE BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER and ANASTASIA).  This is one of the finest ever written for a Disney film, and it's a shame it hasn't been commercially released on CD.  It should also be noted that there are no songs in this film (unless you count the DUCKTALES theme over the closing credits)--this gives DUCKTALES the distinction of being one of Disney's ""songless"" productions (other notable entries including THE BLACK CAULDRON, THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER, and ATLANTIS--THE LOST EMPIRE).Although not on par with Disney's better classics, DUCKTALES--THE MOVIE:  TREASURE OF THE LOST LAMP is a breezy, fun romp that actually holds up pretty well even after its initial 1990 release.  It's too bad that Disney reduced themselves to churning out direct-to-video sequels, none of which matched the excitement or energy of this film or even the heart or human appeal of A GOOFY MOVIE, another inspired by a TV series movie.  Compared to most of these other pointless secondary chapters, DUCKTALES--THE MOVIE remains fresh, funny, and enjoyable, especially for youngsters and, yes, fans of Disney-cartoons in general.",4,"A

Toon Disney is like Disney but has 24 hours a day of Disney Shows and movies, movies normally show on Toon Disney normally twice a week on Friday night and Saturday afternon. Expect maybe on a special day.When the movie opens, Scrooge (Alan Young) and his nephews Huey, Duey and Louie and Webby Vanderquack (Russi Taylor) are flying to a desert with Lanchpad McQuack (Terence McGovern) as thier pilot. When they arrive Launchpad causes a crash which is nothing new becuase he does that lot on the tv show.The locals tells Scrooge that a box has been pulled from underground which is filled with an Arabian thief named Collie Baba's cothes. But is it a loss because thier is a map in a pocket. To Collie Baba's lost treasure. A thief named Dijon (Richard Libertini) is thier guide. Scrooge finds the treasure but goes back to Duckburg without the treasure.The plot is that the only treasure they still has is a lamp. And a villian named Merlock (voiced by Christopher Llyod) wants it so badly because Collie Baba once stoled it from him. And Merlock is still alive because his first wish was to stay alive forever. What Huey, Duey, Louie &amp; Webby don't know is thier is a genie (Rip Taylor) in the lamp. While that is going on Scrooge gets an invitation to a ball that every year he tells that he will find the treasure but comes back with nothing.",5,Scrooge McDuck and his nephews star in this funny movie.,993686400,"06 28, 2001",2001,1468,"['Ducktales', 'Movie', 'Treasure', 'Lost', 'Lamp', 'funny', 'movie', 'show', 'still', 'today', 'Toon', 'Disney', 'Toon', 'Disney', 'Disney', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'Disney', 'Shows', 'movies', 'movies', 'normally', 'show', 'Toon', 'Disney', 'normally', 'twice', 'week', 'Friday', 'night', 'Saturday', 'afternon', 'Expect', 'maybe', 'special', 'day.When', 'movie', 'Scrooge', 'Alan', 'Young', 'nephews', 'Huey', 'Duey', 'Louie', 'Webby', 'Vanderquack', 'Russi', 'Taylor', 'are', 'flying', 'desert', 'Lanchpad', 'McQuack', 'Terence', 'McGovern', 'thier', 'pilot', 'When', 'arrive', 'Launchpad', 'crash', 'nothing', 'new', 'becuase', 'lot', 'tv', 'show.The', 'locals', 'Scrooge', 'box', 'been', 'pulled', 'underground', 'filled', 'Arabian', 'thief', 'named', 'Collie', 'Baba', 'cothes', 'loss', 'thier', 'map', 'pocket', 'Collie', 'Baba', 'lost', 'treasure', 'thief', 'named', 'Dijon', 'Richard', 'Libertini', 'thier', 'guide', 'Scrooge', 'treasure', 'back', 'Duckburg', 'treasure.The', 'plot', 'only', 'treasure', 'still', 'lamp', 'villian', 'named', 'Merlock', 'voiced', 'Christopher', 'Llyod', 'so', 'badly', 'Collie', 'Baba', 'once', 'stoled', 'Merlock', 'still', 'alive', 'first', 'wish', 'was', 'stay', 'alive', 'forever', 'What', 'Huey', 'Duey', 'Louie', 'amp', 'Webby', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thier', 'genie', 'Rip', 'Taylor', 'lamp', 'going', 'Scrooge', 'invitation', 'ball', 'year', 'will', 'find', 'treasure', 'back', 'nothing']",N/A
273982,A37NL9EDUT23IV,6301948106,"takemehome ""Joey""","[60, 68]","In 2006, Disney released DuckTales The Movie: Treasure Of The Lost Lamp onto DVD for the first time in region 1 areas. However, instead of giving it a wide release, Disney decided to offer it exclusively through the Disney Movie Club. Later that same year, it also became a potential reward through their new Disney Movie Rewards program. Although some of Disney's DMC/DMR exclusives have since gotten wide releases, DuckTales The Movie has yet to do that.The disc they've released is rather lightweight. Although it's still a steal for Movie Rewards members, the $19.99 it demands on the Movie Club seems about $5-$10 too high. (This isn't counting the prices poor suckers are paying for it on eBay or Amazon Marketplace, not knowing all that you need to do is join the Disney Movie Club to buy it.) The only bonus feature is a game that you won't play more than once. That's it. Not a trailer, not a featurette, not a cartoon featuring Huey, Dewey, and Louie - nada. It's not a matter of space - on a DVD-5 disc, you have room for at least 4.35 GB of data. This DVD only uses 3.31 GB. Disney, you COULD have put a little more on here.However, the movie's transfer is very well done. There's occasional heavy grain, dirt, scratches, and the like, but for the most part, the transfer is nice and clean. And the 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo track gets the job done.All in all, I can't say that you shouldn't get this DVD if you have a chance. Just having the movie on DVD is worth the price you pay, but it would have been nice if Disney had treated us to a few more bonus materials on this DVD besides a game that's fun, but likely won't be played more than once.",4,"Great movie, but disappointing DVD.",1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,1659,"['2006', 'Disney', 'released', 'DuckTales', 'Movie', 'Treasure', 'Lost', 'Lamp', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'region', '1', 'areas', 'However', 'instead', 'giving', 'wide', 'release', 'Disney', 'decided', 'offer', 'exclusively', 'Disney', 'Movie', 'Club', 'Later', 'same', 'year', 'also', 'became', 'potential', 'reward', 'new', 'Disney', 'Movie', 'Rewards', 'program', 'Disney', 'DMC/DMR', 'exclusives', 'have', 'gotten', 'wide', 'releases', 'Movie', 'yet', 'do', 'that.The', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'released', 'rather', 'lightweight', 'still', 'steal', 'Movie', 'Rewards', 'members', '19.99', 'Movie', 'Club', '5-', '10', 'too', 'high', ""n't"", 'counting', 'prices', 'poor', 'suckers', 'are', 'paying', 'eBay', 'Amazon', 'Marketplace', 'not', 'knowing', 'need', 'do', 'join', 'Disney', 'Movie', 'Club', 'buy', 'only', 'bonus', 'feature', 'game', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'more', 'once', 'Not', 'trailer', 'not', 'featurette', 'not', 'cartoon', 'featuring', 'Huey', 'Dewey', 'Louie', 'nada', 'not', 'matter', 'space', 'DVD-5', 'disc', 'have', 'room', 'least', '4.35', 'GB', 'data', 'DVD', 'only', '3.31', 'GB', 'Disney', 'COULD', 'have', 'put', 'little', 'more', 'here.However', 'movie', 'transfer', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'occasional', 'heavy', 'grain', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'like', 'most', 'part', 'transfer', 'nice', 'clean', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Stereo', 'track', 'job', 'done.All', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'DVD', 'have', 'chance', 'Just', 'having', 'movie', 'DVD', 'price', 'pay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Disney', 'had', 'treated', 'few', 'more', 'bonus', 'materials', 'DVD', 'game', 'fun', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'played', 'more', 'once']",N/A
273983,ADB8XCKNSDY5Z,6301948106,theboombody,"[25, 30]","What a great movie this is.  Actioned packed right from the start, quick-moving plot, and of course the ever-lovable Scrooge McDuck, just as you remember him.Scrooge searches for a lost Arabian treasure, but is ignorant that the most valuable part of the treasure is an old oil lamp.  (Of course you know where this is going.)  Scrooge's niece and nephews discover a genie inside the lamp with the power to grant wishes.  The genie advises the kids to wish for small things, because big wishes lead to big trouble.  The niece Webby ignores this advice, and wishes for her stuffed animals to come to life.  Scrooge sees all this magic happening and finally discovers he has a magic lamp.The Genie tells Scrooge he better be careful not to attract too much attention, because an evil immortal villain with a magic talisman is also seeking the lamp.  The crafty villian finds Scrooge after only one wish, and gets ahold of the lamp after Scrooge gets it confused with a gravy boat.  All heck breaks loose and Scrooge loses all his money, but he gets the lamp back later and becomes rich again.  Then he fixes it so no more genie wishes will ever be granted by making the genie into a real live boy.  The lamp falls apart and the genie plays cops and robbers with Scrooge's nephews, while the evil villan is...well...we see him falling from the sky somewhere, but he can't die, so I guess he ended up okay too.The sad thing about this movie is it's so overshadowed by Disney's Aladdin.  There really isn't much difference between the two movies, except for a giant money bin.  The only advantage Aladdin has over the Ducktales movie is its outstanding songs.  I highly recommend this DVD for Ducktales fans, but if you've seen Aladdin already, the Ducktales movie will seem awful similar.I find it kind of sad that the Ducktales movie ultimately ended up being nothing more than a practice sketch for the later Aladdin film.
