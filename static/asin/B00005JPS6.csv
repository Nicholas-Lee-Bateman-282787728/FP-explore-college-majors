Although the movie is slow in spots, misses on it's humor on more than one occasion, and subjects the audience to Jerry Seinfeld's voice it still out performed itself.The positives of the movie are that it has what I will call it's ""enjoyable"" moments.

Bee Movie doesn't really grab you emotionally, primarily because its star Jerry Seinfeld just isn't that kind of actor.  You can empathize with the plight of his character and the theme of the story but the cerebral arch of this plot misses the heart strings by just a smidgen.  Both my four year old daughter and I found ourselves wandering off and doing other things while the movie played, coming back periodically to check in, never fulling engaged in the film.  Full disclosure, we had just watched another animated film prior to this (Kung Fu Panda) which had lots of emotional buy-in and an action packed visual storyline.  What can I say, it was a rainy day inside.  Regardless, even had we started with Bee Movie I think we would have found ourselves a little disengaged by the film.

After being told by the tour guide (Megan Mullally) that his first job will also be his last, he decides to take a look at the world outside the hive, and then the movie begins to go into decline.While on a routine pollen excursion, he has a close encounter with humans that prompts him to break a basic bee rule of keeping your mouth shut, and before long he's ingesting caffeine with a florist named Vanessa (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and chatting his way into an inter-species relationship.  One day, he discovers that humans have been harvesting honey in larger quantities than roaming bears have ever managed to gather, and decides to take the players in the honey industry to court.One kangaroo court case later, with Judge Oprah presiding, the movie reaches the bottom of the hive with an absolutely mind-bogglingly ridiculous grand finale that will give you an uncontrollable case of the ""WHAT????'s""Sure, there are lots of funny one-liners and sight gags, and inside jokes, and lawyer jokes and innuendo, as well as a message about the importance of every individual to the big picture and the rewards of hard work, but overall, the movie boils down to ""Oh, Jerry, where is your victory?

655501,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B00005JPS6,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 1]","I was reluctant to watch Bee Movie when it was released in theaters, but I decided to give it a try. My expectations were low and this movie surpassed them surprisingly. It was very funny, and I came out of the theaters in a really good mood. To be honest, the plot is pretty silly but this movie wasn't supposed to be a masterpiece, and it delivered a lot of laughs for me. I think that's why this movie wasn't a huge success with critics, you need a good story and good jokes to make a great movie, if one of these two elements is missing it makes the movie forgettable. Oh, and all the puns! They were so lame, I can't BEE-lieve Jerry Seinfeld wrote those in...Oops...Even on the DVD case you still can't escape the puns so if you don't enjoy puns BEE-ware of this movie. Gasp!!! I did it again! I'm un-BEE-lievably sorry. AAAHHH!!!DreamWorks talked about how impressive the 3D is in Bee Movie but I don't understand. It looks like standard 3D. I just don't see the enhanced technology. The humans in this movie look rather stiff, and lifeless besides the very main characters, an example is during a scene with a news report, the reporter's mouth is way out of sync with the vocal dialogue given. But, the bees look good and the honey looks very realistic. I also wasn't impressed with the bee hive, the colors aren't vibrant and it looked a little drab in my opinion. But I did like some of the creative objects in the hive, the bee's antennas are used as phones, the bees drive vehicles, and there is a device that lets you sharpen your stinger (A pencil sharpener) And Barry's closet is filled with the exact same black and yellow shirts. There are so many silly objects like these listed and it's so much fun spotting them.I especially enjoyed Bee Movie's Cast, Renee Zellweger voices Barry's human friend Vanessa and I though Barry and Vanessa's friendship was entirely believable. And Ken (who's voiced by Patrick Warburton) is hysterical, he just flips out so much in this movie and it really cracks me up. And there are many more celebrities featured in Bee Movie, Chris Rock, (voices a dragonfly) Oprah Winfrey, (voices a judge) Larry King, (voices ""Bee"" Larry King) Ray Liotta (as himself) and a bunch more. I was also excited that Mathew Broderick voiced a character in Bee Movie, he also was in the Lion King and I love that movie. So what I'm getting at is there's a great cast for Bee Movie.I enjoyed the movie so much I decided to purchase the two disc special edition but I was disappointed. (I'll discuss the problems later on in my review.) The extras for disc one of Bee Movie were subpar and I was hoping I would see more about the making of the film, but there not bad. I loved the ""TV Juniors"", you really need to watch these, you don't learn anything about the movie but they will have you cracking up. They run around five minutes and this DVD includes sixteen of them, and they're so silly, one of the TV Juniors features Jerry Seinfeld and the DreamWorks crew as they search for ""the elusive animators"" and if captured, they're forced to work at DreamWorks. Also included were some deleted scenes and the live-action Bee Movie trailers. There are also two very brief features about Jerry Seinfeld's flight dressed as a bee in Cannes to promote Bee Movie, and a short feature about the cast of Bee Movie. Those were disc ones bonus features and they're fine for a standard DVD, but the bonus features on disc two are awful. All that's included is a music video, and a few children games. This is a two disc special edition! So I was disappointed that I spent more money than on the single disc edition and all I got were a few extra children games.If you enjoyed Bee Movie you need to own the DVD, but if you want to save money just buy the single disc edition, unless that is you enjoy children games and if that's the case go right ahead.",4,Bee Movie - Two Disc Special Edition,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,3869,"['was', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'expectations', 'were', 'low', 'movie', 'surpassed', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'really', 'good', 'mood', 'be', 'honest', 'plot', 'pretty', 'silly', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'delivered', 'lot', 'laughs', 'think', 'why', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'success', 'critics', 'need', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'jokes', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'elements', 'missing', 'movie', 'forgettable', 'Oh', 'puns', 'were', 'so', 'lame', 'ca', ""n't"", 'BEE-lieve', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'wrote', 'Oops', 'Even', 'DVD', 'case', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'puns', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'puns', 'BEE-ware', 'movie', 'Gasp', 'did', 'again', ""'m"", 'un-BEE-lievably', 'sorry', 'AAAHHH', 'DreamWorks', 'talked', 'how', 'impressive', '3D', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'standard', '3D', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'enhanced', 'technology', 'humans', 'movie', 'look', 'rather', 'stiff', 'lifeless', 'very', 'main', 'characters', 'example', 'scene', 'news', 'report', 'reporter', 'mouth', 'way', 'sync', 'vocal', 'dialogue', 'given', 'bees', 'look', 'good', 'honey', 'very', 'realistic', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'bee', 'hive', 'colors', 'are', ""n't"", 'vibrant', 'looked', 'little', 'drab', 'opinion', 'did', 'like', 'creative', 'objects', 'hive', 'bee', 'antennas', 'are', 'used', 'phones', 'bees', 'drive', 'vehicles', 'device', 'sharpen', 'stinger', 'pencil', 'sharpener', 'Barry', 'closet', 'filled', 'exact', 'same', 'black', 'yellow', 'shirts', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'silly', 'objects', 'listed', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'spotting', 'them.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'Cast', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Barry', 'human', 'friend', 'Vanessa', 'though', 'Barry', 'Vanessa', 'friendship', 'was', 'entirely', 'believable', 'Ken', 'who', 'voiced', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'hysterical', 'just', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'celebrities', 'featured', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'voices', 'dragonfly', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'voices', 'judge', 'Larry', 'King', 'voices', 'Bee', 'Larry', 'King', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'bunch', 'more', 'was', 'also', 'excited', 'Mathew', 'Broderick', 'voiced', 'character', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'also', 'was', 'Lion', 'King', 'love', 'movie', 'what', ""'m"", 'getting', 'great', 'cast', 'Bee', 'Movie.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'purchase', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'was', 'disappointed', ""'ll"", 'discuss', 'problems', 'later', 'review', 'extras', 'disc', 'one', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'were', 'subpar', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'see', 'more', 'making', 'film', 'there', 'not', 'bad', 'loved', 'TV', 'Juniors', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'cracking', 'up', 'run', 'around', 'five', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'sixteen', ""'re"", 'so', 'silly', 'one', 'TV', 'Juniors', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'DreamWorks', 'crew', 'search', 'elusive', 'animators', 'captured', ""'re"", 'forced', 'work', 'DreamWorks', 'Also', 'included', 'were', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'live-action', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'trailers', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'very', 'brief', 'features', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'flight', 'dressed', 'bee', 'Cannes', 'promote', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'short', 'feature', 'cast', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'were', 'disc', 'ones', 'bonus', 'features', ""'re"", 'fine', 'standard', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'disc', 'two', 'are', 'awful', 'included', 'music', 'video', 'few', 'children', 'games', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'was', 'disappointed', 'spent', 'more', 'money', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'got', 'were', 'few', 'extra', 'children', 'games.If', 'enjoyed', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'need', 'own', 'DVD', 'want', 'save', 'money', 'just', 'buy', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'enjoy', 'children', 'games', 'case', 'go', 'right', 'ahead']",N/A

655504,A3IKLTT9JQACCI,B00005JPS6,Becky Rose,"[4, 5]","This is an adorable movie that made me laugh out loud on several occasions.  It starts pretty strong with good clean humor that was above my 6 year olds head, although he enjoyed it for different reasons than I did.Jerry Seinfeld and Renee Zellweger give stellar voice performances.  Jerry's his usual comical self, but it's Renee who really impressed with her expressive talents.  There are several fun cameos - Oprah offers her voice as a judge, Megan Mullaly takes us on a tour of the Honey Factory, and Chris Rock is a misquito ""Mooseblood"" to name a few.The movie has some fantastic messages for both kids and adults.  Think outside the box, take chances, find yourself, and also explains the importance of bees and their function on earth.

I have to admit that watching this film I was very disappointed, and that was simply because a man who can be named by many as being one of the greatest comedians of our time had stooped so low as to use Bee puns in order to get a laugh. During the movie things changed however and when Barry Benson entered into the court case when suing the humans, we are given some genuinely funny gags that can be attributed as funny yet true.The story revolves around Barry Benson a Bee who's graduated from Bee University and is now forced to make a choice as to which job in the hive to take that he will work for the rest of his life. He isn't happy with that and decides to go out one day with the pollen jocks who are the bees who go out and collect the pollen to help make the honey. While on this trip he's accidentally lost and meets a human who saves his life, he thanks her and they become friends (Although she's freaked out by a talking bee). While out with her one day shopping he discovers the honey shelf and finds out the humans kidnap bee queens and hold captive bees in order for them to make honey in artificial hives. Because of this, Barry decides he must punish the humans and sues them.Although the comedy does lack, it picks up towards the end and actually becomes quite intelligent. During the court case itself you can't help but notice the racial undertones when talking about bees being taken as slaves in work camps etc. John Goodman plays the stereotypical southern lawyer who is in favour of the bees being taken as slaves in work camps. The movie itself is quite intelligent especially when touching on the subject of lawsuits and the true repercussions a lawsuit can have. It's an enjoyable film but if you're expecting a hysterical Seinfeld classic then you will be sorely disappointed, it's good but be warned.",3,I expected better from Seinfeld,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,2094,"['Penguins', 'Toys', 'Cars', 'Monsters', 'now', 'Bees', 'have', 'own', 'light', 'using', 'brilliance', 'computer', 'animation', 'when', 'hearing', 'Seinfeld', 'THE', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'writing', 'voicing', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'sure', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'fail', 'amuse', 'have', 'admit', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'was', 'simply', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'named', 'many', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedians', 'time', 'had', 'stooped', 'so', 'low', 'use', 'Bee', 'puns', 'order', 'get', 'laugh', 'movie', 'things', 'changed', 'however', 'when', 'Barry', 'Benson', 'entered', 'court', 'case', 'when', 'suing', 'humans', 'are', 'given', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'gags', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'funny', 'yet', 'true.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Barry', 'Benson', 'Bee', 'who', 'graduated', 'Bee', 'University', 'now', 'forced', 'make', 'choice', 'job', 'hive', 'take', 'will', 'work', 'rest', 'life', ""n't"", 'happy', 'go', 'out', 'one', 'day', 'pollen', 'jocks', 'who', 'are', 'bees', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'collect', 'pollen', 'help', 'make', 'honey', 'trip', 'accidentally', 'lost', 'human', 'who', 'life', 'become', 'friends', 'freaked', 'out', 'talking', 'bee', 'out', 'one', 'day', 'shopping', 'honey', 'shelf', 'out', 'humans', 'kidnap', 'bee', 'queens', 'hold', 'captive', 'bees', 'order', 'make', 'honey', 'artificial', 'hives', 'Barry', 'must', 'punish', 'humans', 'sues', 'comedy', 'lack', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'actually', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'court', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'racial', 'undertones', 'when', 'talking', 'bees', 'being', 'taken', 'slaves', 'work', 'camps', 'etc', 'John', 'Goodman', 'stereotypical', 'southern', 'lawyer', 'who', 'favour', 'bees', 'being', 'taken', 'slaves', 'work', 'camps', 'movie', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'especially', 'when', 'touching', 'subject', 'lawsuits', 'true', 'repercussions', 'lawsuit', 'can', 'have', 'enjoyable', 'film', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'hysterical', 'Seinfeld', 'classic', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'good', 'be', 'warned']",N/A

A ""B"" movie, especially when stacked up against an ""A"" movie like Antz, or ""Bugs' Life"" or even more recent fare like ""Ratatouille"". Woody Allen sending up himself as an ant unhappy with the way the colony was organized - that was original; Jerry Seinfeld picturing himself as a bee, ditto  is just derivative. And the interaction with humans in Ratatouille - that was worked out in a much more logically amusing way. At least it seemed that a rat could be a chef... but millions of bees landing a passenger jet. Oh, well, back to the cartoon drawing board.It's not that the talents thrown into `Bee Movie"" were lightweight or inconsiderable. There was a handful of A-list talent: besides Seinfeld himself and the vocal talents of Renee Zellweger, Rip Torn and Matthew Broderick, plus hundreds of hours of skilled computer animation talent, presumably endless scripts rewrites and conferences around the story board. All of which added up to an inoffensive and inconsequential  bit of movie DVD fluff, as forgettable as something on television a couple of nights ago that you weren't very interested in anyway. A show about nothing, as Mr. Seinfeld himself so memorably quipped of the television vehicle that carried him into celebrity. I watched Bee Movie and the extras (and there is a whole generous disc of extras included for those fans who couldn't get enough bee comedy in the movie) last weekend, and frankly took nothing particularly memorable away from the experience - although the series of sketches that Seinfeld did to promote Bee Movie were a few degrees funnier and fresher than the movie itself.",1,Truth in Advertising,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,1695,"['Well', 'chalk', 'up', 'truth', 'advertising', 'seriously', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'exactly', 'that', 'B', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'stacked', 'up', 'A', 'movie', 'Antz', 'Bugs', 'Life', 'even', 'more', 'recent', 'fare', 'Ratatouille', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'sending', 'up', 'ant', 'unhappy', 'way', 'colony', 'was', 'organized', 'was', 'original', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'picturing', 'bee', 'ditto', 'just', 'derivative', 'interaction', 'humans', 'Ratatouille', 'was', 'worked', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'logically', 'amusing', 'way', 'least', 'seemed', 'rat', 'could', 'be', 'chef', 'millions', 'bees', 'landing', 'passenger', 'jet', 'Oh', 'well', 'back', 'cartoon', 'drawing', 'board.It', 'not', 'talents', 'thrown', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'were', 'lightweight', 'inconsiderable', 'was', 'handful', 'A-list', 'talent', 'besides', 'Seinfeld', 'vocal', 'talents', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'hundreds', 'hours', 'skilled', 'computer', 'animation', 'talent', 'presumably', 'endless', 'scripts', 'rewrites', 'conferences', 'story', 'board', 'added', 'up', 'inoffensive', 'inconsequential', 'bit', 'movie', 'DVD', 'fluff', 'as', 'forgettable', 'something', 'television', 'couple', 'nights', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'interested', 'anyway', 'show', 'nothing', 'Mr.', 'Seinfeld', 'so', 'memorably', 'quipped', 'television', 'vehicle', 'carried', 'celebrity', 'watched', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'extras', 'whole', 'generous', 'disc', 'extras', 'included', 'fans', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'bee', 'comedy', 'movie', 'last', 'weekend', 'frankly', 'took', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'away', 'experience', 'series', 'sketches', 'Seinfeld', 'did', 'promote', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'were', 'few', 'degrees', 'funnier', 'fresher', 'movie']",N/A

Male bees are drones who DO NOT fly away from the hive to collect nectar or pollen. ONLY female worker bees do that. Drones stay in the hive and are fed and cared for by FEMALE worker bees, who also do all the other work in and out of the hive. The male drones' sole--ie, ONLY--function in life is to fly into the air and mate with new queens, after which they die. The only way this bizarre tale could have worked would be for a FEMALE worker bee to play the Seinfeld character, fall in love with a MALE human, then discover how humans are exploiting bees. This is what happens when story and screenplay writers and directors and studio personnel fail to do their homework. It's called research, folks, and it's essential to avoiding ludicrous situations like having MALE worker bees!

655513,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPS6,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","""Bee Movie"" is an adult satire trapped in a kid's cartoon, a combination that's bad for adults and even worse for kids. I guarantee you that anyone under the age of ten will not understand this movie; it relies mostly on verbal humor, most of which consists of pop culture references, work-related puns, and backhanded political references. Yes, this material had the potential to be very funny, and I'm sure it would have been were it not used in a family-oriented animated film. Unfortunately, it was. This is one of the year's most disappointing films, unable to decide which audience to connect with and unwilling to balance it's material. This is a shame because it actually gets off to a promising start, presenting an amusing, brightly colored story with interesting characters. But it soon goes downhill, and it goes hard.The plot focuses on Barry B. Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld), a worker bee ready to enter his hive's workforce. As you might expect, work revolves around the creation and distribution of honey, a product so labor-intensive that it requires many job positions. There are literally dozens of jobs attached to honey making: one could be a Crud Picker, or a Stirrer, or a Pollen Jockey.  One could even wear a tiny rubber finger and use it to scrape the last drop of honey from a container--this is the job that Barry's best friend, Adam (Matthew Broderick), hopes to get. Barry is not all that excited about getting a job, simply because he's not ready to settle into that lifestyle. This desire only gets stronger when he learns that, once a bee picks a job, he or she has to stick with it for life. ""One job?"" he asks a tour guide. ""Are you trying to work us to death?"" ""We certainly hope so!"" the guide enthusiastically responds.And that's when Barry decides to sneak out of the hive with the Pollen Jockeys. Upon his entering the outside world, we learn that his hive is located in New York City's Central Park. We also learn of the one cardinal rule all bees must follow: They must never speak directly to humans. Barry goes along with what he's told ... until he finds himself trapped in an apartment. A kind-hearted florist named Vanessa (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) saves him from her loud-mouthed husband, Ken (Patrick Warburton), who was ready to use a heavy-duty work boot as a swatter. Thus begins an unlikely friendship between a human and a bee, a friendship that conveniently overlooks even the simplest of logical ideas. Even in an animated film, how would a bee be able to drink coffee? How would a bee even know what coffee is?When Barry accompanies Vanessa to the supermarket, he's shocked to discover that honey is mass-produced and sold to humans. He finds this incredibly unfair: Why should humans be able to enjoy a product that bees work so hard to make? But this isn't half as bad as the discovery of a honey farm, which not only houses bees in deplorable conditions, but also subjects them to periodic drugging. In an unprecedented (and nonsensical) legal move, Barry decides to sue the human race for infringing the lives of bees. He hopes to make any honey-related uses illegal, such as in teas, lip balms, and bath products.And that's pretty much when the film loses its way. The last third goes beyond the limits of suspension of disbelief, getting increasingly more ridiculous until it's no longer bearable. Not that it was easy to suspend disbelief at the start--I found it hard to invest in a bee/human relationship, especially since obvious communication problems like voice volume and language aren't even alluded to. Insect purists will be disappointed that a queen bee is never introduced, even when issues regarding family relations are brought up. As you may know, queen bees lay all the eggs of a hive, meaning that all the workers are related; Barry seems to understand this, yet his character is still given his own parents. Does this make any sense at all?If there is anything redeeming about ""Bee Movie,"" it's the slew of special guest voices, all of which add a much-needed dose of relatable humor. Oprah Winfrey lends her voice to the trial judge, while John Goodman lends his voice to the attorney representing the Honey Industry. Kathy Bates and Barry Levinson voice Barry's parents. Larry King voices a bee version of himself--Barry is quick to point out that the humans have a Larry King, who also sits behind a desk while wearing suspenders. Chris Rock voices a mosquito that wants to go to Alaska for moose blood (interestingly, this character is named Mooseblood). Sting and Ray Liotta voice themselves: the former is questioned for using an ill-fitting stage name; the latter is questioned for lending his name to a brand of honey.I also appreciated the playful reinterpretation of the DreamWorks Animation logo. Normally, the logo will display a boy floating up to a crescent moon via a bunch of balloons. For ""Bee Movie,"" Barry stings the boy before he reaches the moon, causing him to release the balloons and fall off screen. If only the rest of the film had maintained this kind of humor, the kind that both children and adults can enjoy. As I see it, a screenplay co-written by Jerry Seinfeld is not appropriate for an animated film, least of all an animated film geared towards younger audiences; his sense of humor is far too intellectual. This is also a problem for adults, who will only be distracted by the cartoon world these characters inhabit. Ultimately, I don't see how this movie can resonate with any audience; it's about as difficult to understand as the natural process of pollination.",3,Getting Honey for Nothing,1193961600,"11 2,

It is simply enchanting, and I think you will find that you and your wife (or husband) will have a great date night if you watch Bee Movie and cook up some pasta and garlic bread and maybe a little chocolate truffles for dessert!It is great to see cartoons advanced to this stage, and I must admit I don't get a chance to see too many these days, but I am very impressed with what they can do nowadays!  You're sitting there listening to the hilarious Jerry Seinfeld crack jokes, but you can't see his face--instead you're seeing the face of a (yellow) bee--and he moves his lips along with the words that Jerry Seinfeld is saying (somewhere off camera).  It's similar to that great TV show, ""Puttin' On the Hitz,"" where they do lip-syncing.Jerry Seinfeld is hilarious as usual, and I wish that they could have had a Kramer bee too!

655520,A2VN15501IUTND,B00005JPS6,"D. Christensen ""Jesus Freak""","[1, 2]","So first of all, let me say that I am a huge fan of Disney Pixar. This movie is made by DreamWorks, so I may be a little biased against it. However, I'll try to be as objective as possible. This movie is once again another takeoff of a Pixar movie (A Bug's Life). I will delve into some different aspects of the film here:Characters: The basic characters are Barry B. Benson, an adventurous bee, Vanessa, a human florist, and Adam, Barry's best friend. There are also other characters, such as Ken, Vanessa's boyfriend, Barry's parents, and Mooseblood the mosquito. I really felt like the characters were too, I don't know, linear. Like they were just following a poorly written script without any real emotion put into it. I felt like you didn't get to know the any of characters, with a few exceptions. Ken is one of those, and Barry's parents are the other. Ken is really full of himself, and he loves tennis. He's really built, like, bodybuilder built. He's also really jealous and self conscious, as well as a little bit overprotective. Barry's parents are kind of typical from films. They want their son to do what his dad did, and his mom always fights with her husband. Those three I felt like you could actually know. One of the things I like about Pixar is that they always make memorable characters. It feels like you could actually know this guy. For example, in UP I could just imagine that Carl is the typical eccentric old man down the street. And there are more characters with a prominent role. In Bee Movie, there are basically three main characters that do most of the speaking, whereas in all the Pixar movies (with the exception of WALL-E) there are a lot more prominent characters.Story: This is where I felt like the idea was there, but it wasn't polished at all. ---SPOILER ALERT--- The basic gist of the movie is that there's Barry, the overactive, restless bee, and he breaks all the bee rules, specifically the one that says no talking to humans. In a crazy course of events, he makes the ""astonishing"" discovery that humans are farming bees and taking the honey for themselves. He gets mad about this, and proceeds to sue the human race. He wins the lawsuit, and since the bees have taken all the honey back that humans had, they no longer have to make it, and the pollen no longer gets spread around and all the vegetation dies out. Vanessa manages to convince him of this fact, and informs him that the last living flowers are going to be on display at the tournament of roses. They go, steal the flowers, and bring them back, get the pollen and spread it to all the flowers, and everything lives again. The story really seemed to kind of fail. There really needed to be about an extra fifteen to twenty minutes, because it was going in all different directions and it just needed more time to come together. ---SPOILER END--- The thing that I really didn't like about the dialogue is that most of the time it sounded like a bunch of sixth graders. For example: Dude, that girl was hot! Hey, there some chicks. I bet if they thought we were Pollen Jocks, they'd go out with us. Barry's dating a human! They were making out! etc, etc. There is also one scene were Ken and Vanessa break up, and Barry dreams about Vanessa, and has a pretty intense crush on her. Of course, who wouldn't, as she's got the curves of a supermodel. However, this will go over the heads of the intended audience age range, so it might not be a big deal.Animation: This is the only place where DreamWorks really got it done. The inside of the beehive looks great, the tennis balls the Ken smacks around are the perfect color. And the bees look good as well. However, the ""virtual wardrobe"" for all the characters is pathetic. Ken wears the same white shirt the entire movie, and Vanessa only has one or two outfits through out the entire movie. And all the bees wear the same shirt, except for the Pollen Jocks and their sergeant.Voice Acting: this is perhaps the biggest bad spot of this movie. Jerry Seinfeld does Barry, and it's mediocre. Renee Zelleweger does Vanessa, and it's OK for the first five minutes or so, but then the ""breathiness"" of her voice really gets annoying. The real standout was Chris Rock as Mooseblood. He did a really good job.Overall, this movie falls short in more ways than one, but kids ages 4-7 will probably enjoy it. A lot of sexual innuendo, more than I've seen in any movie geared towards younger kids. Not a great moral to the story, other than doing the right thing. So I give this movie a three out of five stars. Hope this was helpful....",3,"A good concept, but not carried out.",1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,4583,"['So', 'first', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'made', 'DreamWorks', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'biased', 'However', ""'ll"", 'try', 'be', 'as', 'objective', 'possible', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'takeoff', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'Bug', 'Life', 'will', 'delve', 'different', 'aspects', 'film', 'here', 'Characters', 'basic', 'characters', 'are', 'Barry', 'B.', 'Benson', 'adventurous', 'bee', 'Vanessa', 'human', 'florist', 'Adam', 'Barry', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'characters', 'such', 'Ken', 'Vanessa', 'boyfriend', 'Barry', 'parents', 'Mooseblood', 'mosquito', 'really', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'linear', 'were', 'just', 'following', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'real', 'emotion', 'put', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Ken', 'one', 'Barry', 'parents', 'are', 'other', 'Ken', 'really', 'full', 'tennis', 'really', 'built', 'bodybuilder', 'built', 'also', 'really', 'jealous', 'conscious', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'bit', 'overprotective', 'Barry', 'parents', 'are', 'kind', 'typical', 'films', 'want', 'son', 'do', 'what', 'dad', 'did', 'mom', 'always', 'fights', 'husband', 'three', 'felt', 'could', 'actually', 'know', 'One', 'things', 'like', 'Pixar', 'always', 'make', 'memorable', 'characters', 'could', 'actually', 'know', 'guy', 'example', 'UP', 'could', 'just', 'imagine', 'Carl', 'typical', 'eccentric', 'old', 'man', 'street', 'are', 'more', 'characters', 'prominent', 'role', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'are', 'basically', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'most', 'speaking', 'whereas', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'exception', 'WALL-E', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'prominent', 'characters.Story', 'where', 'felt', 'idea', 'was', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'polished', '-SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'basic', 'gist', 'movie', 'Barry', 'overactive', 'restless', 'bee', 'bee', 'rules', 'specifically', 'one', 'talking', 'humans', 'crazy', 'course', 'events', 'astonishing', 'discovery', 'humans', 'are', 'farming', 'bees', 'taking', 'honey', 'mad', 'proceeds', 'sue', 'human', 'race', 'lawsuit', 'bees', 'have', 'taken', 'honey', 'back', 'humans', 'had', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'make', 'pollen', 'no', 'longer', 'spread', 'vegetation', 'out', 'Vanessa', 'convince', 'fact', 'last', 'living', 'flowers', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'display', 'tournament', 'roses', 'go', 'steal', 'flowers', 'bring', 'back', 'get', 'pollen', 'spread', 'flowers', 'everything', 'lives', 'again', 'story', 'really', 'seemed', 'kind', 'fail', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'extra', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'going', 'different', 'directions', 'just', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'come', 'together', '-SPOILER', 'END', 'thing', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dialogue', 'most', 'time', 'sounded', 'bunch', 'sixth', 'graders', 'example', 'Dude', 'girl', 'was', 'hot', 'Hey', 'chicks', 'bet', 'thought', 'were', 'Pollen', 'Jocks', ""'d"", 'go', 'out', 'Barry', 'dating', 'human', 'were', 'making', 'out', 'etc', 'etc', 'also', 'one', 'scene', 'were', 'Ken', 'Vanessa', 'break', 'up', 'Barry', 'dreams', 'Vanessa', 'pretty', 'intense', 'crush', 'course', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'got', 'curves', 'supermodel', 'However', 'will', 'go', 'heads', 'intended', 'audience', 'age', 'range', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'deal.Animation', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'DreamWorks', 'really', 'got', 'done', 'inside', 'beehive', 'great', 'tennis', 'Ken', 'smacks', 'around', 'are', 'perfect', 'color', 'bees', 'look', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'virtual', 'wardrobe', 'characters', 'pathetic', 'Ken', 'same', 'white', 'shirt', 'entire', 'movie', 'Vanessa', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'outfits', 'entire', 'movie', 'bees', 'wear', 'same', 'shirt', 'Pollen', 'Jocks', 'sergeant.Voice', 'Acting', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'bad', 'spot', 'movie', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Barry', 'mediocre', 'Renee', 'Zelleweger', 'Vanessa', 'OK', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'then', 'breathiness', 'voice', 'really', 'annoying', 'real', 'standout', 'was', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Mooseblood', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job.Overall', 'movie', 'short', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'kids', '4-7', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'more', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'geared', 'towards', 'younger', 'kids', 'Not', 'great', 'moral', 'story', 'other', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'five', 'stars', 'Hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

At least I know I don't need to buy the DVD.Jerry Seinfeld is one of the top two comedians of our time but his humor and writing just don't fit well with a child's genre.  It makes sense after I've seen the movie, Jerry's humor is very adult; double entendres, innuendos and misunderstandings of mature subjects. It sounds like on of the Shrek movies but the Seinfelf humor just didn't translate into animated laughs. Some of it seems as if he was trying to be funny by committee.  All of the jokes, puns and physical comedy must have been pasteurized and homogenized by a group of executives.The really disappointing thing is that they've been working on this movie for years, promoting it for at least 2 years and it's DOA.  They had the opportunity to really entertain, but in my opinion they had too many cooks in the kitchen.Other reviewers have given away the story line so I won't bother, however I will say that the direction it starts out on is `self-discovery' and eventually gets back to that in the end.

It's really fun to see a bee talk to humans in ""Bee Movie,"" but something in the interaction goes terribly wrong.First of all, the movie tries to show a romance between a bee and a woman. It gets even weirder when the woman has a human boyfriend. Okay, maybe it's interesting to have those relations with humans, but it just seems weird to think about those things when the main characters have different physiologies.Second, near the end of the movie, the touching ending gets way too overblown and unrealistic. Think about it--a humongous batch of flowers to save the world from a lack of food. Bees saving the airplane carrying the batch of flowers. Sorry, the bees carried it to the airport. Somehow they developed superhuman strength. I don't understand how on Earth this is supposed to happen.Worse still, the film gets ridiculous with the court scene between the bees and the human corporations. I like Seinfeld's jokes, but are humans really going to take bees seriously? They're bees. They can be squashed by humans. In fact, they get sprayed too. And they die in court. Isn't there something completely wrong with this?This is a confusing movie that is supposed to teach kids about the importance of globalization. Globalization. The sharing of resources among nations. Kids are really not going to understand the message of this movie. ""Bee Movie"" really could have been like ""Ratatouille,"" which was a story about a rat becoming a star, even though he was a hated pest by humans.

I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]The Bee Movie - We own the DVDMovie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):The somewhat tired story of an insect (this time a bee) named Barry who can't seem to settle into the thought of his place in the hive.  Bees are expected to go to school, graduate college and then pick one job from a long list of possibilities to work for the rest of their lives.  As Barry goes about NOT choosing his job he comes into conflict with friends and family and finally ends up going out with the Pollen Jocks (the super elite pollen and nectar collecting bees) and runs amuck in New York.  After a near death experience at the bottom of a boot, Barry is saved by a woman named Vanessa.  A sort of friendship ensues which leads to the knowledge that evil food companies have been stealing honey from bees and Barry files a law suit (ya, I know... that was out of left field) and once he's won, the entire biosphere of the planet dies (you know, because the bees stopped working because they now had all this honey they needed and stop pollenating the plants of the world).  Blink blink.Ok, clearly this movie dude didn't care for the movie much... but this is a family project and I have to tell you Little Miss Movie dude LOVED this movie when she was 7 when it came out and STILL loves this movie today (and here I give a direct quote), ""I can always depend on `The Bee Movie' and feel like I can watch it whenever - I love it!""  As a matter of fact, there were some heated words exchanged because of difference in opinion.  Silly I know, but it goes to show where the line in the sand for this movie is drawn.  As an adult and fan of Jerry Seinfeld and crew I expected a funnier movie... as a child, Little Miss Movie Dude loved the animation, the easy going story.  I found the erratic story changes disconcerting... she suggested I was over thinking it (she might be right, she's often wiser than her years).  So, to be fair and even handed, I thought I would do this review a little different than my normal Bowling for Movies reviews... I'll voice my issues and I'll list what she loved.  Honestly, at the time of this review the DVD cost about $5 and The Bee Movie is worth probably twice that (but that's about it).What Little Miss Movie Dude loved:> What's not to like when Jerry Seinfeld is on board - he has a great wit and always brings `the funny'> An interesting twist into the fantasy life of a thriving bee hive - the way they envisioned the hive city as being part theme park was really fun to watch - particularly, I liked the cars!> The Bee Movie is a mellow good time that you really don't have to think too hard to watch... just sit back and enjoy> The colors they used throughout the film made everything seem warm and inviting - like a sunset on a late summer dayWhat Dad, The Movie Dude didn't like:> Tired `bug' themed movie that relies on a misfit bug who ends up making a huge difference... we get it, I already saw Antz and Bugs Life to name a few (I mean changing an ant to a bee doesn't qualify as `new' in my book)> The animation was generic for CGI based movies of the mid-2000's... other CGI movies out around the same time had a better defined artistic style> The story is all over the place and seems like 3 (or more) separate `episodes' without a clear story arc running throughout - first a misfit bee, then strange, nearly romantic relationship, then in a court room, then the entire plant world is dead - oh ya, remember at the beginning when we said every bee is important???> Over reaching and ultimately not well engineered - this movie is not likely to become a classic but takes its place with other Disney wanna-bees (get it?  wanna-bees, I couldn't resist)Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

An unexpected arrival, however, will make him discover a world he had no idea existed...Jerry Seinfeld, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, and the rest of the cast have done a good job with their performances, though they are by far not my favorite actors.One thing was rather curious and that was how a specific small religious/ethnic group was mentioned in the movie for no apparent reason whatsoever except to promote it and possibly get the audience exposed to it and/or used to it... There seems to be quite a trend in the last few years. Hmmm...Furthermore, enough with the openly and provocative anti-southern bias, as the `baddy' lawyer in a trial taking place in New York (!) is (of course) a southerner...All right they lost, let's move on please! No need or reason to demonize them in the eyes of the new generations.In short, it's the same old/usual clich&eacute; involving one of Hollywood's favorite villains/scapegoats: Southerners (it must have been really difficult to include Germans, Serbs, or Russians in this one).Nevertheless, the movie is very well written and very well presented, and it will surely provide for more than just a few laughs.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the colors, the humor, and the music are all very good.In short, Bee Movie is an entertaining movie definitely worth watching.

The typical day of busy bee life in the hive gets stirred up when Barry (Seinfeld) discovers that people are stealing honey from bees and putting the gold product (of hard work by bees) in jars to sell at the store! As a result, the bees take the humans to court. Celebrities are called to testify including Sting, ha-ha. John Goodman portrays the dramatic lawyer who represents the humans. He gives an over the top performance in the courtroom. Renee Zelwegger is Vanessa, a florist who befriends Barry even though bees are not supposed to talk to humans.

Me however, I enjoyed it a lot, because most of the jokes are targeting adults, rather than children.The hero, Barry Bee Benson, is a sceptical bee, reluctant to accept his fate, which is well resumed by this exchange ""You want to work us to death?"" ""Precisely!"". So, rather than working all his life in just one place and doing just one job, he will look for at least some adventure... and he will find plenty of it. And he will find love... purely platonic, but intense, with a woman - human woman.The movie is smart and funny, and although it is not a masterpiece, I five star it without hesitation. There are many reasons for that: the trial ""All the Bee's of the world vs. All humankind"" is a delight (with Sting and Ray Liotta being called as witnesses...), the scene of morning take off of the pollen gatherers from the hive is a great remake of the similar scene from ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", and the final race in plane looks almost as funny as the ""Airplane!"". You will certainly also appreciate all the jokes on bees/other insects tragic love stories...One advice however - really young children (younger than 6) will probably get a little bored with this movie.

At least he had a perfect B average. He and his classmates are given their orientation at Honex, where they will choose their jobs for life.But Barry isn't ready for that. And the idea of doing one thing for the rest of his life doesn't excite him. So he slips in with the pollen brigade for one trip outside the hive first. It's a wonderful place with colors and flowers and fun.While outside the hive, he meets Vanessa (Renee Zellweger). He breaks bee rules and speaks to her. The two soon strike up a friendship and Barry even develops a crush. But a trip to the grocery store upsets Barry when he finds the row of honey.

And this was a Saturday matinee full of youngsters.  But even the adults didn't laugh as much as I thought they would.  While the jokes about the bee life span and the bee society like ours were funny, once Barry left the hive, everything felt old and recycled.The plot wasn't much better.

Filled with top notch actors, they did a great job.  In fact, I didn't recognize most of them until I looked at the credits.

655588,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00005JPS6,Mike Zimmerman,"[12, 17]","Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld), a bee who graduated from college, isn't enjoying his new adult life. He's forced to make honey for the rest of his life, and his parents (Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson) and friend Adam (Matthew Broderick) aren't giving him much encouragement. Disillusioned, he joins a pollen jock bees, and in the middle of a roundabout, he gets lost from the rest of the gang. It turns out to be good, however, as he makes friends with kind-hearted florist Vanessa Blume (Renee Zellweggar). However, this also presents Barry with a scary truth: humans are stealing honey from the bees and selling it for their own profit. Now, along with Vanessa, Barry hopes to fight a menacing D.A. (John Goodman) and reclaim the bees' source of life.I sort of agree with a small number of critics that ""Bee Movie"" may not be a grandstanding breakthrough of an animated comedy. It's taking the ""Shrek"" formula by mixing in un-PC humor (with jokes that I'm surprised even got past the censors), a gorgeous 3D environment, a huge star wattage (with Larry King, Ray Liotta, and Sting making cameos), and a score from frequent Dreamworks composer Rupert-Gregson Williams, but not doing too much. This is a very good movie, but with Jerry Seinfeld (who also produces) a solid comedian who usually comes in balls out, willing to hit the jugular, ""Bee Movie"" sort of has him on a leash.Still, it's hard to deny a film that isn't overstuffed with family-friendly moralizing to please the simple-minded. Even though you'll have to sit through the first quarters of the film hearing agonizing, half-baked bee puns, ""Bee Movie"" has plenty of good gags here and there. Whether it's Barry imagining a date with Vanessa, riding a bouncing tennis ball, or going against the court and talking to various celebrities mentioned above, the stuff is safe, but deserves credit for its creative originality. Think of it as an Amanda Bynes film if it was animated, and it had Seinfeld.Speaking of the comedian, Seinfeld does a really good job in his first leading role. The material isn't meaty, but Seinfeld has plenty of energy and determination in his attempts to make lemons out of lemonade. And he recieves good company in the form of Renee Zellweggar, whose reliable sweetness and charisma counteracts any formulaic story devices. Both of these talents always brighten up the atmosphere in case it reaches for bottom-of-the-barrel animated comedy cliches.I did wish the side cast was given meatier material, however. There's some solid work from Matthew Broderick, Chris Rock, and Patrick Warburton. But it seems like the creators feel like letting audiences play ""spot-the-celebrity"", with limited appearances from Kathy Bates, John Goodman, David Herman, Barry Levinson (following Martin Scorcese's foots from ""Shark Tale"" as another director looking to broaden his plate) Megan Mullaly, Michael Richards, Oprah Winfrey, and many more.

Further tilting the scales in favor of the Bee Movie is that talking, personified animals rarely fail in this arena; add comedic legend Jerry Seinfeld to the fold and all signs point to yes!""Bee Movie,"" directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner definitely leans to the adult side of the humor formula.  Make no mistake, the visuals are bright and crisp, there's no off-color content or situations, but the goofiness interjected in these films to keep the youngsters enthralled has been axed to make way for dryer humor that we older folk will surely enjoy.In fact considering that Jerry Seinfeld played a big part in this film's development, lends his voice and personality to the lead character, and has seen fit to include many of the costars from his hit television series, the type of humor within could best be compared to the logical/ observational type of comedy to expect here.The story follows one Barry B Benson (Seinfeld) and his best friend Adam Flayman (Mathew Broderick) graduate elementary, high school and college all within a matter of hours and find themselves on the cusp of adulthood, where, like all bees, it is time to choose which part of the honey-making process they'll be a part of for the rest of their short lives.Barry, it seems, doesn't jive with the hive way of thinking.  And rather than sign up for a singular job to last a lifetime, a trip outside the hive with the pollen jockeys opens Barry's peepers to a much larger world; namely the world of humans. A chance encounter with a bubbly florist named Vanessa (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), Barry breaks the cardinal bee rule and speaks aloud to her! Yes that's right folks, all bees can openly communicate with us at any time but usually choose not to.Long story short, Barry accompanies this human woman to the grocery store, discovers humans have stolen honey for bees and are selling it for a profit and decides then and there to put an end to the exploitation of bees by suing the human race.Traditional? Not exactly... But effective in a comedic sort of ridiculousness.  The film succeeds with a nice quick pace and characters that are easy to become concerned about.  Some of the lighter moments include cameos from a whole host of performers from Sting and Ray Liotta over to Larry King.  Chris Rock dazzles as the mosquito Mooseblood and even stars like Kathy Bates, Oprah Winfrey, and John Goodman manage to elevate what began as a clever little concept.In all I definitely enjoyed the Bee Movie and suspect I would have even if I wasn't a bit of a Seinfeld aficionado (why he couldn't write in parts for Jason Alexander and Michael Richards is truly beyond me).  The visuals do little to elevate the genre but they are clean and crisp in that ""DreamWorks"" kind of way and though the plot may drudge on a bit too much for the youngsters to endure, the older crowd will definitely not complain should the tikes request this one be put into the DVD player.",4,Good Fun For A Slightly More Mature Crowd,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,3228,"['DreamWorks', 'Animation', 'formula', 'witnessed', 'potent', 'franchises', 'Shrek', 'Kung-Fu', 'Panda', 'tried', 'true', 'notion', 'dazzling', 'children', 'cute', 'visuals', 'slapstick', 'action', 'entertaining', 'grown-ups', 'more', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'Further', 'tilting', 'scales', 'favor', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'talking', 'personified', 'animals', 'rarely', 'fail', 'arena', 'comedic', 'legend', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'fold', 'signs', 'point', 'yes', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'directed', 'Simon', 'J.', 'Smith', 'Steve', 'Hickner', 'definitely', 'adult', 'side', 'humor', 'formula', 'Make', 'mistake', 'visuals', 'are', 'bright', 'crisp', 'off-color', 'content', 'situations', 'goofiness', 'interjected', 'films', 'keep', 'youngsters', 'enthralled', 'been', 'axed', 'make', 'way', 'dryer', 'humor', 'older', 'folk', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy.In', 'fact', 'considering', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'played', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'development', 'voice', 'personality', 'lead', 'character', 'seen', 'fit', 'include', 'many', 'costars', 'hit', 'television', 'series', 'type', 'humor', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'compared', 'logical/', 'observational', 'type', 'comedy', 'expect', 'here.The', 'story', 'one', 'Barry', 'B', 'Benson', 'Seinfeld', 'best', 'friend', 'Adam', 'Flayman', 'Mathew', 'Broderick', 'graduate', 'elementary', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'matter', 'hours', 'find', 'cusp', 'adulthood', 'where', 'bees', 'time', 'choose', 'part', 'honey-making', 'process', ""'ll"", 'be', 'part', 'rest', 'short', 'lives.Barry', ""n't"", 'jive', 'hive', 'way', 'thinking', 'rather', 'sign', 'up', 'singular', 'job', 'last', 'lifetime', 'trip', 'hive', 'pollen', 'jockeys', 'Barry', 'peepers', 'much', 'larger', 'world', 'namely', 'world', 'humans', 'chance', 'encounter', 'bubbly', 'florist', 'named', 'Vanessa', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'Barry', 'cardinal', 'bee', 'rule', 'aloud', 'Yes', 'right', 'folks', 'bees', 'can', 'openly', 'communicate', 'time', 'usually', 'choose', 'not', 'to.Long', 'story', 'short', 'Barry', 'human', 'woman', 'grocery', 'store', 'discovers', 'humans', 'have', 'stolen', 'honey', 'bees', 'are', 'selling', 'profit', 'decides', 'then', 'there', 'put', 'end', 'exploitation', 'bees', 'suing', 'human', 'race.Traditional', 'Not', 'exactly', 'effective', 'comedic', 'sort', 'ridiculousness', 'film', 'nice', 'quick', 'pace', 'characters', 'are', 'easy', 'become', 'concerned', 'lighter', 'moments', 'include', 'cameos', 'whole', 'host', 'performers', 'Sting', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Larry', 'King', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'dazzles', 'mosquito', 'Mooseblood', 'even', 'stars', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'John', 'Goodman', 'manage', 'elevate', 'what', 'began', 'clever', 'little', 'concept.In', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'suspect', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'bit', 'Seinfeld', 'aficionado', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'write', 'parts', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'truly', 'visuals', 'do', 'little', 'elevate', 'genre', 'are', 'clean', 'crisp', 'DreamWorks', 'kind', 'way', 'plot', 'may', 'drudge', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'youngsters', 'endure', 'older', 'crowd', 'will', 'definitely', 'not', 'complain', 'should', 'tikes', 'request', 'one', 'be', 'put', 'DVD', 'player']",N/A

I was pretty sure it would be really funny because of Jerry Seinfeld and we were not disappointed. The movie was everything you want a family movie to be - it has heart, lots of laughs, some very tender, moving moments, and some underlying messages. The ending of the movie actually surprised me a little with a clever examination of our own daily lives & the meaning therein.One of the things that I particularly loved about this movie is its compassion for non-human life. It demonstrated, brilliantly, the complex & meaningful lives that non-humans (in this case bees) live, the contributions they make, which benefit all of us, and showed how interconnected we all truly are. The movie showed a person (wonderfully voiced by Renee Zellweger) treating the bee with respect, consideration and compassion and trying to teach others to do the same. Our world needs lots more of that, so I hope that movies such as this one work to get that message across and into the 'real' world, and I'm sure that they do... :)Overall, this movie is an interesting & thought-provoking take on the life of the bees, which in many ways, can mirror our own lives, the decisions, the struggles, the highs, the disappointments, and most of all trying to figure out who we really are inside, what we are doing here, what roles we have to play & how it affects those around us...Rai Aren",5,What a fun movie for the whole family!!,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1431,"['family', 'saw', 'movie', 'together', 'what', 'delight', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'funny', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'everything', 'want', 'family', 'movie', 'be', 'heart', 'lots', 'laughs', 'very', 'tender', 'moving', 'moments', 'underlying', 'messages', 'ending', 'movie', 'actually', 'surprised', 'little', 'clever', 'examination', 'own', 'daily', 'meaning', 'therein.One', 'things', 'particularly', 'loved', 'movie', 'compassion', 'non-human', 'life', 'demonstrated', 'brilliantly', 'complex', 'meaningful', 'non-humans', 'case', 'live', 'contributions', 'make', 'benefit', 'showed', 'how', 'interconnected', 'truly', 'are', 'movie', 'showed', 'person', 'wonderfully', 'voiced', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'treating', 'bee', 'respect', 'consideration', 'compassion', 'trying', 'teach', 'others', 'do', 'same', 'world', 'lots', 'more', 'hope', 'movies', 'such', 'one', 'work', 'get', 'message', ""'real"", 'world', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', 'Overall', 'movie', 'interesting', 'thought-provoking', 'take', 'life', 'bees', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'mirror', 'own', 'lives', 'decisions', 'struggles', 'highs', 'disappointments', 'most', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'inside', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'here', 'what', 'have', 'play', 'how', 'Rai', 'Aren']",N/A

Bee Movie is a good example of this.When you start watching the film, you are expected to suspend belief on how bees work.  In the movie, it's a given that bees drive cars, wear clothes, use machinery - in essence, the bees are tiny humans.  Okay, I can buy this.Humans have never noticed what the bees are doing, and despite the fact that both bees and humans speak English, there's been no, and I mean NO communication between the two species ever, before the events in this movie.  The reason for this - it's an unspoken law that bees should not talk to humans, and humans are apparently too stupid to notice the strange habits of the bees.  Okay, that's stretching it and the whole 'unspoken rule' thing is becoming very hackneyed, but I can buy that for the sake of enjoying the film.*SPOILERS*The movie really starts to fall apart when it challenges basic physics and biology.  For instance, in the movie, pollen is more like water than pollen.  The plants in the movie NEED pollination or they'll all die.  And I mean die immediately, not just through failure to reproduce.  Within days of suspending honey production, the entire park the bees live in is dying, because they are no longer pollinating it.  Even plants that don't rely on insect pollination are dying, for some strange reason.To add to all of this, apparently in the film any type of pollen can pollinate any type of plant.  At the beginning of the movie, I snorted at the pollen jock who was sprinkling daisy pollen on roses, thinking 'yeah, that'll help the rose!'  Little did I know, this biological inaccuracy would be involved in a major plot point at the film's climax.Another place where the film crosses the 'suspension of belief' line is when a bunch of bees lift up a plane and keep it from crashing.  Yeah, I really did just say that.  Let's do some math - a fully loaded Boeing 777 is going to weigh around 340,194 kilograms.  A bee weighs, on average, 10 milligrams, and can carry a payload of about 55 milligrams.  In order to lift that plane, you would need about 6.2 BILLION bees.  The average hive has about 50,000 bees, so you would need to round up all the bees in about 123,000 hives in order to lift a plane.  And this is just theoretically - I doubt the plane has enough surface area to accommodate all those bees.*END SPOILERS*Those are the two major events/concepts that took a flying leap over the line, but a bunch of little things annoyed me as well.  In fact, by the end of the film, the director apparently just tossed reality out the window.  I could almost envision him saying 'bear with us, I know this won't make any sense AT ALL but we need to get to this next scene somehow.'Plotwise, the movie meanders about, never seeming to find a good end goal to latch onto.  Act 1 is completely different from Act 2, which is completely different from Act 3, which made everything feel disjointed and frankly, a little sloppy.  The ending message of the film says to me - status quo is good, doing things differently will get you in trouble, so don't break the rules.  Which is to me, a strange message for a children's film.  One that goes directly against Dreamworks' earlier bug production, Antz.The dialogue for the most part is bland - there's a few one liners or bits of dialogue exchange that might elicit a chuckle, but don't expect to be rolling on the floor laughing.The characters are inoffensively cute, and the animation and modeling are so-so compared to Dreamworks' earlier efforts, really making the title of the movie appropriate; because as far as that's concerned, this is a B movie.  The cast is all star, but generally not used to its potential, with the exception of Seinfeld.  Chris Rock's short appearance in particular will be disappointing to his fans.All in all, I thought the film had potential, but the decision to include some really stunningly stupid logic, and the lack of a cohesive plot wrecked it for me.  If you have a really, really high tolerance for such things, you might be able to get some enjoyment out of this, but otherwise, I recommend steering clear of Bee Movie.",2,Un-bee-lievable!,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,4266,"['sorry', 'pun', 'movie', 'should', 'expect', 'suspend', 'belief', 'certain', 'areas', 'however', 'when', 'movie', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'good', 'example', 'this.When', 'start', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'expected', 'suspend', 'belief', 'how', 'bees', 'work', 'movie', 'given', 'bees', 'drive', 'cars', 'wear', 'clothes', 'use', 'machinery', 'essence', 'bees', 'are', 'tiny', 'humans', 'Okay', 'can', 'buy', 'this.Humans', 'have', 'never', 'noticed', 'what', 'bees', 'are', 'doing', 'fact', 'bees', 'humans', 'speak', 'English', 'been', 'mean', 'communication', 'two', 'species', 'ever', 'events', 'movie', 'reason', 'unspoken', 'law', 'bees', 'should', 'not', 'talk', 'humans', 'humans', 'are', 'apparently', 'too', 'stupid', 'notice', 'strange', 'habits', 'bees', 'Okay', 'stretching', 'whole', 'rule', 'thing', 'becoming', 'very', 'hackneyed', 'can', 'buy', 'sake', 'enjoying', 'film', '*SPOILERS*The', 'movie', 'really', 'fall', 'apart', 'when', 'basic', 'physics', 'biology', 'instance', 'movie', 'pollen', 'more', 'water', 'pollen', 'plants', 'movie', 'NEED', 'pollination', ""'ll"", 'die', 'mean', 'die', 'immediately', 'not', 'just', 'failure', 'reproduce', 'Within', 'days', 'suspending', 'honey', 'production', 'entire', 'park', 'bees', 'live', 'dying', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'pollinating', 'Even', 'plants', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'insect', 'pollination', 'are', 'dying', 'strange', 'reason.To', 'add', 'apparently', 'film', 'type', 'pollen', 'can', 'pollinate', 'type', 'plant', 'beginning', 'movie', 'snorted', 'pollen', 'jock', 'who', 'was', 'sprinkling', 'daisy', 'pollen', 'roses', 'thinking', ""'yeah"", ""'ll"", 'help', 'rose', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'biological', 'inaccuracy', 'would', 'be', 'involved', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'film', 'climax.Another', 'place', 'where', 'film', ""'suspension"", 'belief', 'line', 'when', 'bunch', 'bees', 'lift', 'up', 'plane', 'keep', 'crashing', 'Yeah', 'really', 'did', 'just', 'say', 'Let', 'do', 'math', 'fully', 'loaded', 'Boeing', '777', 'going', 'weigh', '340,194', 'kilograms', 'bee', 'weighs', 'average', '10', 'milligrams', 'can', 'carry', 'payload', '55', 'milligrams', 'order', 'lift', 'plane', 'would', 'need', '6.2', 'BILLION', 'bees', 'average', 'hive', 'about', '50,000', 'bees', 'would', 'need', 'round', 'up', 'bees', 'about', '123,000', 'hives', 'order', 'lift', 'plane', 'just', 'theoretically', 'doubt', 'plane', 'enough', 'surface', 'area', 'accommodate', 'bees', '*END', 'SPOILERS*Those', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'events/concepts', 'took', 'flying', 'leap', 'line', 'bunch', 'little', 'things', 'annoyed', 'well', 'fact', 'end', 'film', 'director', 'apparently', 'just', 'tossed', 'reality', 'window', 'could', 'almost', 'envision', 'saying', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'AT', 'ALL', 'need', 'get', 'next', 'scene', 'somehow', 'movie', 'meanders', 'never', 'seeming', 'find', 'good', 'end', 'goal', 'latch', 'Act', '1', 'completely', 'different', 'Act', '2', 'completely', 'different', 'Act', '3', 'made', 'everything', 'feel', 'disjointed', 'frankly', 'little', 'sloppy', 'ending', 'message', 'film', 'status', 'quo', 'good', 'doing', 'things', 'differently', 'will', 'get', 'trouble', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'break', 'rules', 'Which', 'strange', 'message', 'children', 'film', 'One', 'directly', 'Dreamworks', 'earlier', 'bug', 'production', 'Antz.The', 'dialogue', 'most', 'part', 'bland', 'few', 'one', 'liners', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'exchange', 'might', 'elicit', 'chuckle', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing.The', 'characters', 'are', 'inoffensively', 'cute', 'animation', 'modeling', 'are', 'so-so', 'compared', 'Dreamworks', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'really', 'making', 'title', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'as', 'far', 'concerned', 'B', 'movie', 'cast', 'star', 'generally', 'not', 'used', 'potential', 'exception', 'Seinfeld', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'short', 'appearance', 'particular', 'will', 'be', 'disappointing', 'fans.All', 'thought', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'decision', 'include', 'really', 'stunningly', 'stupid', 'logic', 'lack', 'cohesive', 'plot', 'wrecked', 'have', 'really', 'really', 'high', 'tolerance', 'such', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'otherwise', 'recommend', 'steering', 'clear', 'Bee', 'Movie']",N/A

655617,A2XK11WA3MHIG0,B00005JPS6,Richard Snouffer,"[1, 1]","A fun and farcical tale, this movie was enjoyable.  Jerry Seinfeld plays a bee torn by angst over his looming--and supposedly permanent--job choice.  This choice ultimately leads to unforeseen consequences way beyond the scope of his natural life's plan.  Jerry's performance is quite funny, although a bit much for the intended younger audience.  Most of the double entendres should fly over the youngsters' heads--hopefully, anyway.  Renee Zellweger also turns in a cute performance.This movie strikes one cautionary note in that even if you think you are in the right, disaster can come from upsetting the natural order of things.What I found to be consistently annoying were the departures from reality with regard to the natural history of bees.  Now, I'm not referring to the fact that insects talk in the movie.  Nobody's going to be fooled by that.  However, those who know little about natural science and especially small children might come away with a few misconceptions.Those with biology degrees or even those who just enjoy natural history may ""bee"" irked by the flaws in bee biology.  (I apologize for the pun--had to do it!)  For example, all workers in the hive are female.  Also, except for queens and drones, bees don't do just one job their whole lives.

It is full of puns, pokes fun at modern living from a kids' perspective, has strange characters with great voices, and is visually spectacular.  The film is about a bee, Barry, who wants something more than just accepting a job in the hive and working himself to death.  He goes out seeking adventure, only to have a near-death experience during which he befriends a human, breaking bee law by letting her know he can talk.  His parents, much as in The Graduate, want him to choose a job, until he goes on a crusade to end human exploitation of bees for honey.  To fight, he sues the multi-national food group that owns the bees, but upon winning realises has upset the ecological balance when the bees stop working with all the honey they get back.  In the end, after a strange adventure, he sets things right.If this sounds rather, well, inane, it is.  This is one of those films that adults can play and that delight kids, but doesn't have much of a level that adults can enjoy, like we can for the muppets.  At least for me, this was a film I could tolerate but would never put on myself.

655635,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B00005JPS6,Steffan Piper,"[3, 5]","I rarely, if ever, notice what MPAA Rating a film has received as it is something I have NEVER had to worry about. I used to go to drive-in movies to watchThe ExorcistandThe Omenwhen I was but a fragile fawn in the woods collecting twigs. But when I saw that it was rated PG for 'mildly suggestive humor', it caught my attention. I thought: That's something you don't see everyday.So, maybe it was the scenes where the angle of the viewers perspective was beneath the beautiful young girl's long legs and curvaceous body with that short, short skirt and her huge blinking eyes and wry smile. Maybe it was the many slick references toThe Graduate. I was a little too reminded of all the much-more suggestive Japanese Anime that I've ingested in the last decade watching the first fifteen minutes. I guess at some point, the inclusion of ""suggestive"" material would have to happen to mainstream Western animation, too. We export so much ""suggestive"" and ""explicit"" material, it goes without saying that even a Dreamworks movie would someday co-opt a little of that market as well. For that, I guess as a thirty-something -- I'm thankful. I've never seen Renee Zellweger looking so trim and glowing and 'come hither'. Being a married man and having to understand the basic frailties of my wife and the way she looks, I'm sure Renee was probably intensely satisfied with her characters appearance as well. It was a highlight, even if they put most of the suggestive material on the front-end of the movie.The second half of the movie then turns into a message-driven cautionary tale about Mankind's exploitation of bees, which is probably a long time coming and a good message for kids. I can understand the frustration of one reviewer, seeing that he's a bee farmer and that the film wasn't ""correct"" in all its descriptions of a real bee's life and the nomenclature of its existence. But the truth is, even if you do get your bread and butter from bee farming, being socially aware of our impact on the world of bees is a good message, no matter how you slice it. And, oh yeah, I think we all know that bees don't speak English (or Spanish), don't sip latte's, wear sweaters or study legal documents and seek to litigate for labor law violations and community infraction.I laughed out loud and followed this movie in rapt attention from beginning to end as did my wife, who couldn't help saying that ""it's so cute"" numerous times.

But at least bees have one reason for their existence, which is one more than ""Bee Movie"" has.The film, like many feature cartoons of late, is beautifully animated emptiness. It's lovely to look at, but then there's that troubling little detail called a story. The P.R. mill tells us that Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio okayed the movie after comedian Jerry Seinfeld cutely suggested the title to Spielberg over dinner one night. It only shows that some jokes should not be told at the dinner table.Seinfeld voice-stars as Barry B. Benson, a cog in the bee circle of life. Having gotten his bee education -- four days of high school -- Barry is now expected to choose his sole vocation. But surely, Barry reasons, there's more to life than this. So one day, Barry breaks out and enters the human world.Sadly, the one human Barry chooses to speak to is a vacuous florist named Vanessa (Renee Zellweger). This movie labors mightily over this slightly-above-platonic relationship. But if you think recent comedies about love affairs between babes and nerds are implausible, try working up a lather about the impending love affair between a babe and an insect.From there, the movie veers into...not even a sub-plot, more like a side-plot. Barry discovers that generations of bees have labored to produce the honey that mean old humans casually swipe for themselves. So Barry launches a lawsuit to get the bees' honey returned to his own kind. After that, the movie veers into a pro-environmental message, which certainly has its place. But that place probably isn't a big-budget kiddie cartoon.Seinfeld already has a huge human following -- is there some unknown bee demographic he's trying to reach? If bees could reason, I'm sure they'd be thrilled that their story is being thoughtfully told. Me, I'm not so moved.The movie's tone is so desperate, the movie should have a drummer just off-screen, doing rim shots for each one-liner. Seinfeld does Barry as the type of screechily bad comic that his TV show used to lampoon. And the rest of the movie is ""Flintstones""-type stuff, with cutesy jokes about workaday life, celebrity cameos (Larry King plays himself as a bee -- hysterical!), and lots of bad bee puns.Even the movie's basic idea is a rip-off -- remember DreamWorks' ""Antz"" (1998), with Woody Allen as a drone ant? It's been almost a decade since a stand-up comic made his cartoon debut as a non-conformist insect. DreamWorks, I promise, nobody will complain if you let the concept die right here.""Bee Movie"" is rated PG for minor innuendo and bathroom humor.",2,Bee-ware!,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,2682,"['insect', 'hero', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'angry', 'bees', 'are', 'given', 'only', 'one', 'job', 'literally', 'death', 'least', 'bees', 'have', 'one', 'reason', 'existence', 'one', 'more', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'has.The', 'film', 'many', 'feature', 'cartoons', 'late', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'emptiness', 'lovely', 'look', 'then', 'troubling', 'little', 'detail', 'called', 'story', 'P.R', 'mill', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'DreamWorks', 'studio', 'okayed', 'movie', 'comedian', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'cutely', 'suggested', 'title', 'Spielberg', 'dinner', 'one', 'night', 'only', 'jokes', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'dinner', 'table.Seinfeld', 'voice-stars', 'Barry', 'B.', 'Benson', 'cog', 'bee', 'circle', 'life', 'Having', 'gotten', 'bee', 'education', 'four', 'days', 'high', 'school', 'Barry', 'now', 'expected', 'choose', 'sole', 'vocation', 'surely', 'Barry', 'reasons', 'more', 'life', 'one', 'day', 'Barry', 'out', 'human', 'world.Sadly', 'one', 'human', 'Barry', 'speak', 'vacuous', 'florist', 'named', 'Vanessa', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'movie', 'labors', 'mightily', 'slightly-above-platonic', 'relationship', 'think', 'recent', 'comedies', 'love', 'affairs', 'babes', 'nerds', 'are', 'implausible', 'try', 'working', 'up', 'lather', 'impending', 'love', 'affair', 'babe', 'insect.From', 'there', 'movie', 'veers', 'not', 'even', 'sub-plot', 'more', 'side-plot', 'Barry', 'generations', 'bees', 'have', 'labored', 'produce', 'honey', 'mean', 'old', 'humans', 'casually', 'swipe', 'So', 'Barry', 'lawsuit', 'get', 'bees', 'honey', 'returned', 'own', 'kind', 'movie', 'veers', 'pro-environmental', 'message', 'certainly', 'place', 'place', 'probably', ""n't"", 'big-budget', 'kiddie', 'cartoon.Seinfeld', 'already', 'huge', 'human', 'following', 'there', 'unknown', 'bee', 'trying', 'reach', 'bees', 'could', 'reason', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'thrilled', 'story', 'being', 'thoughtfully', 'told', 'Me', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'moved.The', 'movie', 'tone', 'so', 'desperate', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'drummer', 'just', 'off-screen', 'doing', 'rim', 'shots', 'one-liner', 'Seinfeld', 'Barry', 'type', 'screechily', 'bad', 'comic', 'TV', 'show', 'used', 'lampoon', 'rest', 'movie', 'Flintstones', '-type', 'stuff', 'cutesy', 'jokes', 'workaday', 'life', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'Larry', 'King', 'bee', 'hysterical', 'lots', 'bad', 'bee', 'movie', 'basic', 'idea', 'rip-off', 'remember', 'DreamWorks', 'Antz', '1998', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'drone', 'ant', 'been', 'almost', 'decade', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'made', 'cartoon', 'debut', 'non-conformist', 'insect', 'DreamWorks', 'promise', 'nobody', 'will', 'complain', 'let', 'concept', 'die', 'right', 'here', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'minor', 'innuendo', 'bathroom', 'humor']",N/A

Well, for one it's slightly funnier than its contemporaries - but it wasn't always shaping up that way, as the first half-hour is full of obvious and predictable jokes. Bee Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) has just graduated from college and is dismayed to find that the job he picks will be the job he'll have for the rest of his life. He escapes the hive and lands in human florist Vanessa's (Zellwegger) plants. Barry falls head-over-heels for Vanessa but when he discovers that us humans eat honey, he decides to sue us. The story is thin on the ground and takes so long to get going there's no way to write a synopsis without touching on the legal case, which happens way over the halfway mark. Written by Seinfeld, who employed two sitcom writers to help, it's easy to see why Bee Movie's plot is the way it is - instead of a full story, it a series of set-ups and punchlines punctuated by small episodic adventures: the intro to the hive, the escape, the love story, the discovery of the artificial hives, the court case. The decent jokes, too, take time to come to fruition, but once it hits a groove the gags are pretty consistent there after.

655644,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPS6,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[20, 24]","Jerry Seinfeld has been away from the spotlight for some time now and 2007 marks the year of his return - but only as a voice in a computer animated film. While the premise is unique, the approach is generic, and the excellently animated, poorly executed family film will have difficulty avoiding the already popular classification that Bee Movie is indeed a B-movie.Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) is an average bee approaching adulthood, who must decide upon a job in the hive. The catch is that once he chooses his job, he must keep it for the rest of his life. Unsatisfied with the monotony of working in the hive, he ventures outside where he meets a human woman, Vanessa (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), who saves his life. Indebted, he breaks the Cardinal bee rule: never talk to humans. At first Vanessa has difficulty accepting the talking bee, but the two soon spend quite a bit of time together and Barry gets overly comfortable as she reveals that she is a florist. Enamored with Vanessa, despite the interspecies barrier, Barry learns that humans have been stealing honey from bees and selling and eating it. Infuriated, he sets out to sue the honey company, with the help of Vanessa and his bee pals.Apparently bees drive cars, they are all cousins, and they can use their antennas as cell phones. The comical world the creators have devised for the bees is perhaps the most creative aspect of the film. Many parallels reside with Barry's rebellious teen years and human childhood, as specifically referenced by a sensationally hysterical homage to The Graduate. From voting the queen bee into monarchy, to pollination, to insects on windshields and their attraction to lights, many of the typical insect behaviors are addressed and translated into humorous gags - supposedly their thinking is shockingly similar to humans.The animation (from Dreamworks, the studio that brought us Shrek) as always continues to excel in its realism, from the cartoon movements and facial expressions of the characters, to the nearly flawless reflections and refractions of the inanimate objects and background environments. Barry gets stuck to a tennis ball and batted around in slow motion, and sucked into the engine of a car: both scenes and many more are executed with amazing editing and stunning camera movement that can only be achieved in computer animation.Hysterical character designs and voice acting also add to the fun, with jocose performances by John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, Chris Rock and even voice cameos by Michael Richards (who many joked would play the role of an Africanized bee) and Larry King as Bee Larry King. What doesn't work as well is the execution of the story. The film often contradicts itself with the reactions of the humans to talking bees, and with what Barry is capable of realistically doing as nothing more than a heavily personified insect. Some of the jokes elicit laughter, but most are on an unexpectedly low intelligence level, and ultimately the many entertaining bits are specifically aimed at younger audiences. As is often with computer animated films, visual perfection oftentimes overshadows the time spent trying to devise an enticing story, and Bee Movie falls in with the too-kid-friendly films that are quickly forgotten.- Mike Massie",3,Bee Movie Review,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,3285,"['Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'been', 'away', 'spotlight', 'time', 'now', '2007', 'marks', 'year', 'return', 'only', 'voice', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'premise', 'unique', 'approach', 'generic', 'excellently', 'animated', 'poorly', 'executed', 'family', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'difficulty', 'avoiding', 'already', 'popular', 'classification', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'indeed', 'B-movie.Barry', 'B.', 'Benson', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'average', 'bee', 'approaching', 'adulthood', 'who', 'must', 'decide', 'job', 'hive', 'catch', 'once', 'job', 'must', 'keep', 'rest', 'life', 'Unsatisfied', 'monotony', 'working', 'hive', 'ventures', 'where', 'human', 'woman', 'Vanessa', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'life', 'Indebted', 'Cardinal', 'bee', 'rule', 'never', 'talk', 'humans', 'first', 'Vanessa', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'talking', 'bee', 'two', 'soon', 'spend', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'together', 'Barry', 'overly', 'comfortable', 'florist', 'Enamored', 'Vanessa', 'interspecies', 'barrier', 'Barry', 'humans', 'have', 'been', 'stealing', 'honey', 'bees', 'selling', 'eating', 'Infuriated', 'out', 'sue', 'honey', 'company', 'help', 'Vanessa', 'bee', 'pals.Apparently', 'drive', 'cars', 'are', 'cousins', 'can', 'use', 'antennas', 'cell', 'phones', 'comical', 'world', 'creators', 'have', 'devised', 'bees', 'perhaps', 'most', 'creative', 'aspect', 'film', 'Many', 'parallels', 'reside', 'Barry', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'years', 'human', 'childhood', 'specifically', 'referenced', 'sensationally', 'hysterical', 'homage', 'Graduate', 'voting', 'queen', 'bee', 'monarchy', 'pollination', 'insects', 'windshields', 'attraction', 'lights', 'many', 'typical', 'insect', 'behaviors', 'are', 'addressed', 'translated', 'humorous', 'gags', 'supposedly', 'thinking', 'shockingly', 'similar', 'humans.The', 'animation', 'Dreamworks', 'studio', 'brought', 'Shrek', 'always', 'excel', 'realism', 'cartoon', 'movements', 'facial', 'expressions', 'characters', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'reflections', 'refractions', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'background', 'environments', 'Barry', 'stuck', 'tennis', 'ball', 'batted', 'slow', 'motion', 'sucked', 'engine', 'car', 'scenes', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'executed', 'amazing', 'editing', 'stunning', 'camera', 'movement', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'achieved', 'computer', 'animation.Hysterical', 'character', 'designs', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'add', 'fun', 'jocose', 'performances', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'even', 'voice', 'cameos', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'who', 'many', 'joked', 'would', 'play', 'role', 'Africanized', 'bee', 'Larry', 'King', 'Bee', 'Larry', 'King', 'What', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'execution', 'story', 'film', 'often', 'reactions', 'humans', 'talking', 'bees', 'what', 'Barry', 'capable', 'realistically', 'doing', 'nothing', 'more', 'heavily', 'personified', 'insect', 'jokes', 'elicit', 'laughter', 'most', 'are', 'unexpectedly', 'low', 'intelligence', 'level', 'ultimately', 'many', 'entertaining', 'bits', 'are', 'specifically', 'aimed', 'younger', 'audiences', 'often', 'computer', 'animated', 'films', 'visual', 'perfection', 'oftentimes', 'time', 'spent', 'trying', 'devise', 'enticing', 'story', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'too-kid-friendly', 'films', 'are', 'quickly', 'forgotten.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

Too cute.The title is a play on words, and this is about as edgy as the humor gets. B Movie is a term that used to be applied to a film made by a studio that was paired with a more expensive, more prestigious film. Basically, a second film used to fill out a double bill to give the customer the feeling they have received their money's worth. Generally, they were made by directors less respected by the studio and starred either new, up and coming actors or actors who needed a paycheck. ""Bee Movie"" is about Barry the Bee (Seinfeld). Get it.Barry and his best friend, Adam (Matthew Broderick) graduate from Bee College and immediately find they face a decision; they must choose the job they will do for the rest of their lives. But Barry wants to se the outside world, so he tags along with a group of bees that are charged with collecting pollen. Flying through the outside world, Barry's eyes are opened by all New York has to offer and he meets a human, Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger), a flower shop owner (get it?) who befriends him from the buffoon (Patrick Warburton) who wants to be her boyfriend. As their friendship blooms, Barry learns humans have harvested a lot of honey, stolen it from the bees and decides to take them to court to get it back. It sounds like a good idea, but when he wins, an unexpected thing happens and he has to make everything right.The film is sprinkled with humor. Every now and then, Barry has a Seinfeld-like rift on what he is observing as a bee in the outside world. And some of the characters have memorable lines. For instance, the buffoon (Warburton) who wants to become Vanessa's boyfriend, is upset when she cancels Yogurt night. ""Why is Yogurt night so hard?"" he bellows as the door is shut in his face.And the environment of the hive is interesting; as the film begins, the animators take us on a whirlwind tour of the hive and all of the various aspects of it. This is a fast paced moment and provides for some neat visual gags.When Barry takes his flight with the rest of the bees who venture out of the hive, the animators have some fun with the flight, swooping in and out of box kites, through trees, across the New York landscape.The biggest problem with ""Bee Movie"" lies in the animation. It is well done but the style of the characters is too cutesy. As soon as I saw Barry and Adam walking through the hive, I immediately thought of a picture book for children. The animation is very stylized and far removed from reality, which is a good thing because a realistic bee probably wouldn't be too fun to watch. But they have, perhaps, gone too far in the other direction. Barry and all of his brethren resemble a Disney Baby version of a bee. A few years ago, Disney began creating Disney Baby versions of Mickey, Pluto, Donald, Minnie, Goofy and the rest of the brood, that are much rounder, softer, and cuter. Perfect for little babies and newborns, extending the Disney brand by capturing the kids even earlier. The bees look like that, rounder, softer, and cuter.If this were the only example of this, of catering to the very youngest crowd, it would probably be okay. But there seems to be a conscious effort to gear the entire film for this age range. The humor is light and less sardonic or biting than you might find. The story is a little simplistic. The acting is a bit broad. I think that you will find in any `classic' animated film the filmmakers have made a conscious effort to cater to both young and old. In all of the modern Disney classics, the animation is beautiful and strives to be as lifelike as possible. While they may include talking (or singing) animals, they also include humor geared specifically for adults and maybe even a little danger or threat. This makes these films enjoyable for the adults who are required to bring the kids to the theaters in the first place. And when those kids grow up, they remember the films with fond memories, introducing them to their children.""Bee Movie"" isn't bad, it just isn't fast-paced enough to keep the adults in the audience enthralled. There is a scene late in the film in which Barry and Vanessa are traveling to California on a plane. Very quickly, things spiral out of control and Barry and Vanessa find themselves in control of the plane. There is a moment when Barry tries to explain to Vanessa what happened, which is the closest thing we have to the ""Seinfeld"" humor you would expect from him. It is a funny line and more of the same type of humor would have helped to make the film more memorable.""Bee Movie"" has its moments, but I can't help but think the film is appropriately named. It will most likely be a B movie in comparison to the best Disney has to offer and anything Pixar ever does.",3,"2 1/2 - ""Why Is Yogurt Night So Hard?""",1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,4943,"['Why', 'yogurt', 'night', 'so', 'hard', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'new', 'animated', 'film', 'created', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'voices', 'Seinfeld', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'John', 'Goodman', 'cute', 'film', 'Too', 'cute.The', 'title', 'play', 'words', 'about', 'as', 'edgy', 'humor', 'B', 'Movie', 'term', 'used', 'be', 'applied', 'film', 'made', 'studio', 'was', 'paired', 'more', 'expensive', 'more', 'prestigious', 'film', 'Basically', 'second', 'film', 'used', 'fill', 'out', 'double', 'bill', 'give', 'customer', 'feeling', 'have', 'received', 'money', 'worth', 'Generally', 'were', 'made', 'directors', 'less', 'respected', 'studio', 'starred', 'new', 'up', 'coming', 'actors', 'actors', 'who', 'needed', 'paycheck', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'Barry', 'Bee', 'Seinfeld', 'Get', 'it.Barry', 'best', 'friend', 'Adam', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'graduate', 'Bee', 'College', 'immediately', 'find', 'face', 'decision', 'must', 'choose', 'job', 'will', 'do', 'rest', 'lives', 'Barry', 'se', 'outside', 'world', 'group', 'bees', 'are', 'charged', 'collecting', 'pollen', 'Flying', 'outside', 'world', 'Barry', 'eyes', 'are', 'opened', 'New', 'York', 'offer', 'human', 'Vanessa', 'Bloome', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'flower', 'shop', 'owner', 'get', 'who', 'buffoon', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'who', 'be', 'boyfriend', 'friendship', 'blooms', 'Barry', 'humans', 'have', 'harvested', 'lot', 'honey', 'stolen', 'bees', 'take', 'court', 'get', 'back', 'good', 'idea', 'when', 'unexpected', 'thing', 'happens', 'make', 'everything', 'right.The', 'film', 'sprinkled', 'humor', 'now', 'then', 'Barry', 'Seinfeld-like', 'rift', 'what', 'observing', 'bee', 'outside', 'world', 'characters', 'have', 'memorable', 'lines', 'instance', 'buffoon', 'Warburton', 'who', 'become', 'Vanessa', 'boyfriend', 'upset', 'when', 'Yogurt', 'night', 'Why', 'Yogurt', 'night', 'so', 'hard', 'door', 'shut', 'face.And', 'environment', 'hive', 'interesting', 'film', 'animators', 'take', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'hive', 'various', 'aspects', 'fast', 'paced', 'moment', 'neat', 'visual', 'gags.When', 'Barry', 'flight', 'rest', 'bees', 'who', 'venture', 'hive', 'animators', 'have', 'fun', 'flight', 'swooping', 'box', 'kites', 'trees', 'New', 'York', 'landscape.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'animation', 'well', 'done', 'style', 'characters', 'too', 'cutesy', 'As', 'soon', 'saw', 'Barry', 'Adam', 'walking', 'hive', 'immediately', 'thought', 'picture', 'book', 'children', 'animation', 'very', 'stylized', 'far', 'removed', 'reality', 'good', 'thing', 'realistic', 'bee', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'fun', 'watch', 'have', 'perhaps', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'direction', 'Barry', 'brethren', 'resemble', 'Disney', 'Baby', 'version', 'bee', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Disney', 'began', 'creating', 'Disney', 'Baby', 'versions', 'Mickey', 'Pluto', 'Donald', 'Minnie', 'Goofy', 'rest', 'brood', 'are', 'much', 'rounder', 'softer', 'cuter', 'Perfect', 'little', 'babies', 'newborns', 'extending', 'Disney', 'brand', 'capturing', 'kids', 'even', 'earlier', 'bees', 'look', 'rounder', 'softer', 'cuter.If', 'were', 'only', 'example', 'catering', 'very', 'youngest', 'crowd', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'okay', 'there', 'be', 'conscious', 'effort', 'gear', 'entire', 'film', 'age', 'range', 'humor', 'light', 'less', 'sardonic', 'biting', 'might', 'find', 'story', 'little', 'simplistic', 'acting', 'bit', 'broad', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'classic', 'animated', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'made', 'conscious', 'effort', 'cater', 'young', 'old', 'modern', 'Disney', 'classics', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'be', 'as', 'lifelike', 'possible', 'may', 'include', 'talking', 'singing', 'animals', 'also', 'include', 'humor', 'geared', 'specifically', 'adults', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'danger', 'threat', 'films', 'enjoyable', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'required', 'bring', 'kids', 'theaters', 'first', 'place', 'when', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'remember', 'films', 'fond', 'memories', 'introducing', 'children', 'Bee', 'Movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'fast-paced', 'enough', 'keep', 'adults', 'audience', 'enthralled', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'Barry', 'Vanessa', 'are', 'traveling', 'California', 'plane', 'Very', 'quickly', 'things', 'spiral', 'control', 'Barry', 'Vanessa', 'find', 'control', 'plane', 'moment', 'when', 'Barry', 'explain', 'Vanessa', 'what', 'happened', 'closest', 'thing', 'have', 'Seinfeld', 'humor', 'would', 'expect', 'funny', 'line', 'more', 'same', 'type', 'humor', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'memorable', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'film', 'appropriately', 'named', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'B', 'movie', 'comparison', 'best', 'Disney', 'offer', 'anything', 'Pixar', 'ever']",N/A

655653,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPS6,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Golden-Globe nominated ""Bee Movie"" has received mixed reviews from the media. Opinion is divided even among the general viewers; some say it is entertaining and funny while others say it is unfunny, even boring. Perhaps this has something to do with the nature of the gags of the film, which contains one-liners and pop culture references (with cameos from Gordon Matthew Sumner aka Sting) as well as sight gags. Or perhaps it is that we need something more to make a feature film, something like a compelling story and credible characters.Jerry Seinfeld (also co-producer and co-writer) provides the voice for the film's everyman-type protagonist, a bee named Barry B. Benson. The disillusioned hero cannot decide on his work after graduating from college (and he must do the same job until the day he dies). He then flies outside the hive in New York City, meets a florist Vanessa (voice by Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and sues humans after watching how bees are ""exploited.""Obviously the four writers are trying to do something original -- the tedium of the bee community that could have been a nightmarish dystopia; a suggested romance between a human and a bee; or a lawsuit that results in unexpected troubles for both humans and bees. All of them have a potential to be a theme for a feature film, but ""Bee Movie"" is not aware of that fact.The film moves quickly from one set-piece to another, without developing these ideas at all. So we know Benson is romantically attracted to Vanessa, but the topic seems suddenly discarded in the third act. We are also told that bees are not supposed to talk to humans, but the rule is soon forgotten in the court room. They may be small things, but it is these details that draw the audiences into the film's world as much superior ""Ratatouille"" shows.I enjoyed watching the film, but that was because I was impressed with the film's colorful visuals and designs, and some of the actions (flying sequences are impressive).

655654,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00005JPS6,Turfseer,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For the first 30 minutes I thought that Bee Movie had a chance to become a classic like ""Toy Story"" but as the minutes ticked away, I realized it wasn't going to happen. Unlike Toy Story, Bee Movie does not have a central antagonist. Remember ""Sid"", the psycho kid who terrorizes the toys in Toy Story? What a marvelous creepy kid! Bee Movie offers up a number of limp opponents to Seinfeld's Barry B. Benson. There's the completely unfunny macho tennis player boyfriend in the beginning who is constantly trying to smash Barry to a pulp and an odious obese attorney who ends up having an allergy attack after he's stung by Barry's sidekick, Adam (couldn't understand why Adam was still alive after he stung the attorney--wasn't it established early on that bees die right away after they sting their target?).Ultimately it's Barry's own misguided idealism which becomes the ""villain"" after he successfully sues humankind for stealing the bees' honey. It's good for an exploration of Barry's 'inner journey' but a movie still needs an actual real world antagonist to root against. In Ratatouille, a rat speaks to a cook in a restaurant but he's the only one who can hear the rat. And there's a purpose to the relationship--the rat helps the cook to become a great chef. In Bee Story, there are awkward romantic suggestions between Vanessa (Rene Zelwegger) and Barry and obviously that's an idea that doesn't work since it cannot be put into practice. It would have been much better if Vanessa is the only human who can hear Barry. And perhaps the character could have been some kind of 'pet psychic' now branching off into the insect world.I felt there could have been much more done within the 'hive' itself. A great opportunity was lost when nothing was done with the idea of a QUEEN BEE character (there was one lame joke about a cross-dressing 'queen bee' halfway through the movie). And Chris Rock's Mosquito should have been Barry's sidekick throughout most of the movie (not Adam!).In Toy Story, the toys leave the 'ordinary world' of a child's playroom and end up in the dangerous real world. The scenes where Barry leaves the hive and must confront all the dangers of the NATURAL WORLD was the best part of the movie (most people have alluded to the tennis ball scene as a particularly strong visual scene). The writers should have kept Barry outside the hive for most of the movie but should NOT have pitted him mainly against human characters. A threat from the insect world (such as a king of the roaches modeled on some kind of contemporary madman like the Iranian president) would have been a much better threat to the bee world then the idea that their honey was being taken away from them by humans. That idea doesn't really make sense since in reality bees continue to make honey despite human encroachment. I'm not suggesting that the whole lawsuit idea had to be jettisoned but it should have been a minor story line. I also found the climax of the movie to be unsatisfying--the bees guiding a jetliner to the ground seemed ludicrous. What's more, with great sentimentality, all the bees seemed to be elevated to a saintly status at the end of the movie.The writers should have emulated Pixar who know how to successfully anthropomorphize their non-human characters (displaying the gamut of human foibles). There were many witty lines in Bee Movie and you can thank Jerry Seinfeld for his clever humor. If only more thought was put into the overall plot, then this could have been a classic!",2,"Nowhere close to ""Toy Story""",1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,3550,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***For', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'thought', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'had', 'chance', 'become', 'classic', 'Toy', 'Story', 'minutes', 'ticked', 'away', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'happen', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'not', 'have', 'central', 'antagonist', 'Remember', 'Sid', 'psycho', 'kid', 'who', 'toys', 'Toy', 'Story', 'What', 'marvelous', 'creepy', 'kid', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'up', 'number', 'limp', 'opponents', 'Seinfeld', 'Barry', 'B.', 'Benson', 'completely', 'unfunny', 'macho', 'tennis', 'player', 'boyfriend', 'beginning', 'who', 'constantly', 'trying', 'smash', 'Barry', 'pulp', 'odious', 'obese', 'attorney', 'who', 'up', 'having', 'allergy', 'attack', 'stung', 'Barry', 'sidekick', 'Adam', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Adam', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'stung', 'attorney', 'was', ""n't"", 'established', 'early', 'bees', 'die', 'right', 'away', 'sting', 'target', '.Ultimately', 'Barry', 'own', 'misguided', 'idealism', 'villain', 'successfully', 'humankind', 'stealing', 'bees', 'honey', 'good', 'exploration', 'Barry', ""'inner"", 'journey', 'movie', 'still', 'actual', 'real', 'world', 'antagonist', 'root', 'Ratatouille', 'rat', 'cook', 'restaurant', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'hear', 'rat', 'purpose', 'relationship', 'rat', 'cook', 'become', 'great', 'chef', 'Bee', 'Story', 'are', 'awkward', 'romantic', 'suggestions', 'Vanessa', 'Rene', 'Zelwegger', 'Barry', 'obviously', 'idea', ""n't"", 'work', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'practice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Vanessa', 'only', 'human', 'who', 'can', 'hear', 'Barry', 'perhaps', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'kind', ""'pet"", 'psychic', 'now', 'branching', 'off', 'insect', 'world.I', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'done', ""'hive"", 'great', 'opportunity', 'was', 'lost', 'when', 'nothing', 'was', 'done', 'idea', 'QUEEN', 'BEE', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'lame', 'joke', 'cross-dressing', ""'queen"", 'bee', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Mosquito', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Barry', 'sidekick', 'most', 'movie', 'not', 'Adam', '.In', 'Toy', 'Story', 'toys', 'leave', ""'ordinary"", 'world', 'child', 'playroom', 'end', 'up', 'dangerous', 'real', 'world', 'scenes', 'where', 'Barry', 'hive', 'must', 'confront', 'dangers', 'NATURAL', 'WORLD', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'alluded', 'tennis', 'ball', 'scene', 'particularly', 'strong', 'visual', 'scene', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'Barry', 'hive', 'most', 'movie', 'should', 'NOT', 'have', 'pitted', 'mainly', 'human', 'characters', 'threat', 'insect', 'world', 'such', 'king', 'roaches', 'modeled', 'kind', 'contemporary', 'madman', 'Iranian', 'president', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'threat', 'bee', 'world', 'then', 'idea', 'honey', 'was', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'humans', 'idea', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'reality', 'bees', 'continue', 'make', 'honey', 'human', 'encroachment', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'whole', 'lawsuit', 'idea', 'had', 'be', 'jettisoned', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'minor', 'story', 'line', 'also', 'found', 'climax', 'movie', 'be', 'unsatisfying', 'bees', 'guiding', 'jetliner', 'ground', 'seemed', 'ludicrous', 'What', 'more', 'great', 'sentimentality', 'bees', 'seemed', 'be', 'elevated', 'saintly', 'status', 'end', 'movie.The', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'emulated', 'Pixar', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'successfully', 'anthropomorphize', 'non-human', 'characters', 'displaying', 'gamut', 'human', 'foibles', 'were', 'many', 'witty', 'lines', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'can', 'thank', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'clever', 'humor', 'only', 'more', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'overall', 'plot', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic']",N/A

655658,A188NTJ5LV8LA4,B00005JPS6,Wm19,"[2, 3]","This is the best animated movie I've ever watched.  Barry (Jerry Seinfeld) is a newly graduated bee who has to decide what job he wants to work at in the hive.  The most adventurous job is a ""pollen jock"" who actually leaves the hive to get nectar from the flowers outside.  When Barry leaves the hive, he has several adventures, discovers humans are eating the honey that bees toil to make, and launches a lawsuit.  I loved this movie.  It's about teamwork, honesty, the importance of having a purpose in life (some very interesting things happen when the bees stop working), and even more importantly, the importance of bees in the pollination of flowers, fruits, vegetables and trees (even more important in light of the recent colony collapse disorder).Usually, I find animated movies amusing but irritating in the obnoxious side characters and annoying actions (Madagascar is a good example).  Even Shrek gets on my nerves sometimes with the anger-management challenged ogre and super irritating donkey.  In contrast, Bee Movie was pure gold.  Barry (Jerry Seinfeld) was practical, charming and a great hero.  The other characters were great.  I found the bee jokes funny and actually pretty inventive.  The ending is unrealistic, but hey, this is a cartoon with a talking bee.  It's called willful suspension of disbelief.  I loved the ending, thought it was great and fantastic.  Hey, if a human can save the world, why can't a bee?

We really like how it is put across in a fun way. The only thing we did not appreciate much was the romantic allusions between the bee and the human lady - if it were more of a friendship that was suggested, we wouldn't mind. Does everything have to have romance in it - even children's movies? The ending of the movie was a nice surprize and made up for the minor disappointment of the romance stuff.
