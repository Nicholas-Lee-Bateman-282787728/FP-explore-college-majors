1270466,A2ZYFPHEDPBYDW,B002ILRCRI,Jobla,"[13, 13]","Roller Derby has always been one of the most controversial American entertainment events/sports.  It was born of the Great Depression, and has been described as six-day bicycle racing on roller skates.  As it evolved over the decades, the emphasis on skating eventually gave way to fisticuffs and infield ""color.""ROLLER DERBY CHRONICLES is a fabulous three-DVD set that pays tribute to the best intentions of the family that pioneered the sport.  The festivities commence on disc one with a nearly hour-long documentary about the founders and some of the great skaters who graced the league during its heyday.  Then, the acclaimed documentary DERBY (1970) follows in its entirety.  DERBY actually crossed over to the theatrical arthouse circuit back in the day, and is still treasured by fans for its depiction of the Roller Derby world circa 1969/1970.The other two DVDs offer a variety of games spanning the modern age of the sport, 1952-1977.  It should be noted that virtually no game films survive from the 1964-1972 era, so that particular period isn't represented here (other than the 1969/70 game footage in the documentary DERBY).  The overall visual quality is excellent, given the vintage of these games.  Many of Roller Derby's greatest stars are on display throughout.  Also included is the second half of a Canadian game from 1974, which provides a nice showcase for the Derby's primary competition, another league that called itself Roller Games.Whether you're still an active fan, or just nostalgic for the days when Roller Derby ruled the airwaves, this three-DVD set wonderfully brings the era back to life.",5,Fabulous salute to the golden age of Roller Derby,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,1625,"['Roller', 'Derby', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'American', 'entertainment', 'events/sports', 'was', 'born', 'Great', 'Depression', 'been', 'described', 'six-day', 'bicycle', 'racing', 'roller', 'skates', 'evolved', 'decades', 'emphasis', 'skating', 'eventually', 'gave', 'way', 'fisticuffs', 'infield', 'color', 'ROLLER', 'DERBY', 'CHRONICLES', 'fabulous', 'three-DVD', 'set', 'tribute', 'best', 'intentions', 'family', 'pioneered', 'sport', 'festivities', 'commence', 'disc', 'one', 'nearly', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'founders', 'great', 'skaters', 'who', 'graced', 'league', 'heyday', 'Then', 'acclaimed', 'documentary', 'DERBY', '1970', 'entirety', 'DERBY', 'actually', 'crossed', 'theatrical', 'arthouse', 'circuit', 'back', 'day', 'still', 'treasured', 'fans', 'depiction', 'Roller', 'Derby', 'world', 'circa', '1969/1970.The', 'other', 'two', 'DVDs', 'offer', 'variety', 'games', 'spanning', 'modern', 'age', 'sport', '1952-1977', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'virtually', 'game', 'films', 'survive', '1964-1972', 'era', 'particular', 'period', ""n't"", 'represented', 'here', 'other', '1969/70', 'game', 'footage', 'documentary', 'DERBY', 'overall', 'visual', 'quality', 'excellent', 'given', 'vintage', 'games', 'Many', 'Roller', 'Derby', 'greatest', 'stars', 'are', 'display', 'Also', 'included', 'second', 'half', 'Canadian', 'game', '1974', 'nice', 'showcase', 'Derby', 'primary', 'competition', 'league', 'called', 'Roller', 'Games.Whether', ""'re"", 'still', 'active', 'fan', 'just', 'nostalgic', 'days', 'when', 'Roller', 'Derby', 'ruled', 'airwaves', 'three-DVD', 'set', 'wonderfully', 'era', 'back', 'life']",Roller Derby Chronicles

Deckard ""retroboomer""","[5, 5]","I started watching the Roller Derby in 1969 until it's demise in 1973, a true tragedy for aficionados of this unique, amazing and lost part of Americana. For the fans people like Ann Calvello, Joan Weston, Charlie O'Connell and the other bank tracked warriors were like part of our own families. While other sports have their die hard fans, the bond between the fans of Roller Derby and their banked track heroes was truly on a personal level. And we never forgot those skaters or our sport and still retain a livley interest and love for it today. This is a good set and showcases many of the top stars of the golden age of the Roller Derby and some games that capture the excitement and energy of the sport. As has been pointed out in some other reviews, little footage of the Roller Derby remains aside from a few filmed games from the 40s/50s and the final '73 season on videotape, something the fans still lament to this day. But for those that love the game or people who are just curious as to what it was all about this is a well put together set and provides many insights into the game, the players and why it all ended. Included is a Roller Games entry which shows the vast difference between the two competing leagues and also a game from the IRSL which succeeded the old Roller Derby (IRDL) and lasted another 10 years.
