The movie's namesake is harrowingly played by Jennifer Carpenter, whom I only new from her role on Dexter (as his sister). She turns in a very strong performance here, showing a different side than her turn as Deb Morgan. The movie overall is pretty good, but I'm always a little cynical, and a big part of me wonders how closely this follows the facts of the true story.

949890,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000BTJDG2,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 0]","It's hard to rate this movie. It's based on true-life events, and it's also a faithed-based horror movie that draws on our own, deep-rooted beliefs in God and the devil, something that has always found success in the movies, starting back with the original horror classic The Exorcist. Though it is a movie about the tragic events of a young girl who was obviously tortured in life, The Exorcism of Emily Rose captures everything that modern horror films don't. Simply speaking, it scares us. And it handles Emily Rose's story sensitively, without making her appear as no more than a Hollywood monster, like Linda Blair's character has become. With that out of the way, I will go onto the review.Exorcism begins ""in media res"" (beginning in the middle), starting the movie with Emily's death. It's a good start to the movie, because it introduces the other main character in the process, Father Moore, the priest who watched over Emily and attempted the only exorcism. From there, the movie becomes a court trial, literally. Emily's story is told through witness testimony and flashbacks while Father Moore's story is taking place. Father Moore has been charged for Emily's murder, and faces ten years in prison. Though a plea-agreement was proposed, he refuses every attempt and decides that he wants to go to court, so that Emily's story can be told. During the trial, Emily's possession is detailed and played out, and we, from start to finish, see the things she had to go through. All the way up to the actual exorcism, the horror is really no more than a feeling of creepiness (at least for me) but when you realize what is possessing her, and just how outnumbered Father Moore and Emily's family truly is, then it takes a violent shift towards horrifying. In that final epiphany, the torture of Emily and the hopelessness of her exorcism is presented. It doesn't take an understanding in Humanities to know who and what Father Moore has attempted to chase away.By the end of the movie, when all the facts are in place, you can't help but have a feeling of despair, both for Father Moore and for Emily Rose, as both of their separate endings were and are inevitable. Yet, in both of their fights, their goals are achieved.I'd recommend this movie for fans of the Exorcist, or for anyone who has any prior knowledge of the Emily Rose possession and the happenings that surrounded her death. I'd even recommend this as a weaker companion piece to Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, as both contain stark moments of pain and horror, and both can help us tap into our religious selves.",4,Faith-Based Horror,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,2588,"['hard', 'rate', 'movie', 'based', 'true-life', 'events', 'also', 'faithed-based', 'horror', 'movie', 'own', 'deep-rooted', 'beliefs', 'God', 'devil', 'something', 'always', 'found', 'success', 'movies', 'starting', 'back', 'original', 'horror', 'Exorcist', 'movie', 'tragic', 'events', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'obviously', 'tortured', 'life', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'everything', 'modern', 'horror', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'Simply', 'speaking', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'story', 'sensitively', 'making', 'appear', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'monster', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'character', 'become', 'way', 'will', 'go', 'review.Exorcism', 'media', 'res', 'beginning', 'middle', 'starting', 'movie', 'Emily', 'death', 'good', 'start', 'movie', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'process', 'Father', 'Moore', 'priest', 'who', 'watched', 'Emily', 'attempted', 'only', 'exorcism', 'there', 'movie', 'court', 'trial', 'literally', 'Emily', 'story', 'told', 'witness', 'testimony', 'flashbacks', 'Father', 'Moore', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'Father', 'Moore', 'been', 'charged', 'Emily', 'murder', 'ten', 'years', 'prison', 'plea-agreement', 'was', 'proposed', 'attempt', 'go', 'court', 'Emily', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'trial', 'Emily', 'possession', 'detailed', 'played', 'out', 'start', 'finish', 'see', 'things', 'had', 'go', 'way', 'actual', 'exorcism', 'horror', 'really', 'no', 'more', 'feeling', 'creepiness', 'least', 'when', 'realize', 'what', 'possessing', 'just', 'how', 'outnumbered', 'Father', 'Moore', 'Emily', 'family', 'truly', 'then', 'violent', 'shift', 'towards', 'horrifying', 'final', 'epiphany', 'torture', 'Emily', 'hopelessness', 'exorcism', 'presented', ""n't"", 'take', 'understanding', 'Humanities', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'Father', 'Moore', 'attempted', 'chase', 'away.By', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'facts', 'are', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'have', 'feeling', 'despair', 'Father', 'Moore', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'separate', 'endings', 'were', 'are', 'inevitable', 'fights', 'goals', 'are', 'achieved.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'Exorcist', 'anyone', 'who', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'possession', 'happenings', 'surrounded', 'death', ""'d"", 'even', 'recommend', 'weaker', 'companion', 'piece', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'contain', 'stark', 'moments', 'pain', 'horror', 'can', 'help', 'tap', 'religious', 'selves']",N/A

Her story is told in a series of flashbacks that are never disjointed or abstract. It is the realism of her tragic story that is the most frightening thing in the film.

It has never been called a horror film .  It has a presence of horror in a different way and is a true story that is more a courtroom drama that explores how the legal system deals with the case of a girl who died after an exorcism and while under the direct care of a priest.  Was she epileptic and psychotic?  Or was she possessed.  Medical facts verses spiritual facts.THE EXORCIST was a story that had the exorcism and gore galore in the forefront with the story of its characters in the background.  THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is about an exorcism with the strong story in the forefront.  This is a 5 star film.  We have three of the best actors of this decade - Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson and Scott Campbell.  These are hardcore actors and each tackles their role with strong intensity.Now before I continue I want to comment on how the film appears in blu ray.  It is absolutely astounding.  The 1080p high def picture is crystal clear and the truehd audio will blow you away.  This must be viewed with a 5.1 theater system.  I have seen this film many times and the clarity in blu ray makes the courtroom scenes seem as if I am watching a play and the actors are in my room.  The film does manage to expertly show the progression of Emily Rose's deterioration and if you view it with blu ray and a theater system the sound will have you on the edge of your seat and jumping out of your skin.  (Important note, if you watch DEXTER, it is great fun to see Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose.  She is superb.)Blu ray allows the viewer to see the emotions of the actos much more clearly.  Laura Linney is the attorney defending the priest accused of Emily's death and she is at first a self professed agnostic.  But the film is largely about how the whole affair affects her.  At the end she is very troubled and doesn't know what she is.  But her life is totally changed.  Even with all the great acting the film in my opinion belongs to Laura Linney and Jennifer Carpenter.If you want a standard B horror film with blood and gore this film is not for you.  This film is an insightful, intelligent courtroom drama about a very unique case and it is scary, suspenseful, troubling and dramatic but for different reasons.  Excellent film and even if you own the dvd you MUST purchase it on blu ray.

949896,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B000BTJDG2,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[3, 3]","This isn't your typical horror film, so I guess I can't really compare it to real horror films. Gore is almost nonexistent, half the movie takes place inside a courtroom (just when you're getting creeped out things go back to the courtroom, keeping the intensity of the movie at a lower level), and the suspense is minimal at times. However, this movie is inspired by true events (""inspired by a true story"" means lessly based on fact than if it said ""based on a true story""), which makes it twice as scary right from the beginning.At the end of movies like ""The Darkness"" (don't see that it is worthles), the few people who are actually scared comfort themselves by saying over and over again in their heads, it isn't real, it's just a story. This movie though, focuses on real events. Throughout history, some people have been thought to have been possessed by demons. Though most of the time there is another logical explanation (and we all want to believe there will be a logical explanation), sometimes there is only one way to describe something: there is some supernatural power involved. Now before I start to sound like a wacko, let me finish the review.This film starts out at a creepy fog covered country house and field. The ""possessed"" girl, Emily, is dead, and Father Moore, who had attempted numerous exorcisms, is to blame. A hot shot lawyer takes his case and defends him in court. As the trial goes on, the lawyer begins to experience sleepless nights and strange happenings late at night. Father Moore attempts to warn her about supernatural happenings, but since she is an atheist, she takes no heed to his warnings. Father Moore is being haunted by what he believes is the demon that possessed Emily. Throughout the movie, Emily's story is revealed in the courtroom, piece by piece, keeping audiences interested. At the end of the movie, things are resolved, but only partially. Of course there is no way to actually prove Emily was possessed by demons, though it makes for a great story.What makes this movie scary is that, once again I will say this, it was inspired by true events. Another thing that made it scary was that it happened to a normal girl, no different from any other person. This doesn't come close to being the most horrific movie I have ever seen, but some parts are fairly intense, and it definitley kept my interest, something other horror films have repeatedly failed to do.Overall, 4/5 scary rating, 3/5 intensity rating, 4/5 believability rating, 3/5 suspense rating, 4/5 stars for keeping my interest, overall 4/5 stars",4,"Best ""scary"" movie I've ever seen",1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,2566,"[""n't"", 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'real', 'horror', 'films', 'Gore', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'movie', 'place', 'courtroom', 'just', 'when', ""'re"", 'getting', 'creeped', 'out', 'things', 'go', 'back', 'courtroom', 'keeping', 'intensity', 'movie', 'lower', 'level', 'suspense', 'minimal', 'times', 'However', 'movie', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'lessly', 'based', 'fact', 'said', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'twice', 'scary', 'right', 'beginning.At', 'end', 'movies', 'Darkness', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'worthles', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'scared', 'comfort', 'saying', 'over', 'again', 'heads', ""n't"", 'real', 'just', 'story', 'movie', 'real', 'events', 'Throughout', 'history', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'possessed', 'demons', 'most', 'time', 'logical', 'explanation', 'want', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'logical', 'explanation', 'sometimes', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'describe', 'something', 'supernatural', 'power', 'involved', 'Now', 'start', 'sound', 'wacko', 'let', 'finish', 'review.This', 'film', 'out', 'creepy', 'fog', 'covered', 'country', 'house', 'field', 'possessed', 'girl', 'Emily', 'dead', 'Father', 'Moore', 'who', 'had', 'attempted', 'numerous', 'exorcisms', 'blame', 'hot', 'shot', 'lawyer', 'case', 'court', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'experience', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'strange', 'happenings', 'late', 'night', 'Father', 'Moore', 'attempts', 'warn', 'supernatural', 'happenings', 'atheist', 'heed', 'warnings', 'Father', 'Moore', 'being', 'haunted', 'what', 'demon', 'possessed', 'Emily', 'movie', 'Emily', 'story', 'revealed', 'courtroom', 'piece', 'piece', 'keeping', 'audiences', 'interested', 'end', 'movie', 'things', 'are', 'resolved', 'only', 'partially', 'course', 'way', 'actually', 'prove', 'Emily', 'was', 'possessed', 'demons', 'great', 'story.What', 'movie', 'scary', 'once', 'again', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'thing', 'made', 'scary', 'was', 'happened', 'normal', 'girl', 'different', 'other', 'person', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'being', 'most', 'horrific', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'parts', 'are', 'fairly', 'intense', 'kept', 'interest', 'something', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'repeatedly', 'failed', 'do.Overall', '4/5', 'scary', 'rating', '3/5', 'intensity', 'rating', '4/5', 'believability', 'rating', '3/5', 'suspense', 'rating', '4/5', 'stars', 'keeping', 'interest', 'overall', '4/5', 'stars']",N/A

I was highly suspicious of yet another girl-gets-possessed movie from hollywood. I mean, hadn't Linda Blair pretty much embodied that idea ever since 1973? Besides, EMILY ROSE? Isn't that a bit too much like AUDREY ROSE? So, I put off watching it. Silly me! After having just watched EMILY last night, I can admit to being totally wrong, mistaken, and pleasantly surprised. It's a well-told story, played out as a courtroom drama, w/ most of the demonic happenings shown as flashbacks. Both Tom Wilkinson and Laura Linney are superb as the priest and his defense attorney respectively. Of course, my favorite scenes were those of Emily herself, played w/ violent glee by Jennifer Carpenter (QUARANTINE, tv's DEXTER). While the prosecutor hammered away w/ cold logic during the trial, Emily's plight was played out in a beautifully tragic fashion, allowing Carpenter to swing wildly between calm, lucid moments, and animalistic frenzy.

949898,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000BTJDG2,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 12]","THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE had an excellent start to what could have been a really outstanding upgrade to exorcism films of old (obviously I'm thinking about THE EXORCIST). But the ending had so many strikes against it that I nearly turned the movie off.The initial premise of the film was wonderful, though, making it appear as if the audience would decide what really happened to Emily (Jennifer Carpenter). Showing back-story during the court case in which a priest is on trial for her death intrigued me. The courtroom drama unfolded with two aspects being shown: one moment we see the medical possibilities of what Emily may have gone through (""Was she an epileptic with a form of psychosis?""), while the next we're introduced to the possibility of demonic possession (""Can an epileptic be conscious during a convulsion and speak Aramaic?"") I was spellbound by the medical/religious dueling and I gave a bit of credence to both sides ...for a while.Tom Wilkinson plays Father Moore, the Rose family parish priest, who was assigned the task of performing the exorcism by the local arch-diocese. But the exorcism goes horribly awry and ""the demons"" remain in Emily. She deteriorates and eventually dies ...which is where the film starts. We watch a medical examiner enter the Rose house and proclaim that he can't prove Emily's death was by natural causes, so Father Moore is arrested for negligent homicide for not seeking medical attention.The Catholic church has an attorney firm on retainer and asks for their rising star lawyer, Erin Bruner (Laura Linney, THE SQUID AND THE WHALE), to represent Father Moore. But taking on the case may just be the start for Ms. Bruner. Father Moore tells her that ""evil forces surround this trial,"" and it is here that the film begins to unravel. Instead of leaving it to the viewer to decide what might have happened to Emily, the film becomes a heavy-handed treatise on God, sainthood, and excessive religious symbolism. This completely deflated any possibility of a medical diagnosis, thus ending any after-movie discussion about what the message of the film might be about.Conveniently, Erin Bruner finds a locket on the ground with her initials inscribed on it, giving sledgehammer understanding as to why she decides to continue with the case (""I found that locket, of all people, and I guess it means maybe I'm on the right path""). Give me a break. Strike one!Then Father Moore miraculously produces a letter that Emily had wrote before she died, telling everyone that because Emily was a good person, and made a tough spiritual decision, she ""might be considered for sainthood in the future."" Excuse me? Sainthood for one action? And what about the wounds to Emily's hands and feet. Stigmata, of course. Wait. Stigmata? On a possessed person? Strike two!And then we get to the sentencing of Father Moore and the ridiculous ""recommendation"" by the jury. Would a judge really, honestly, legally, consider that? Maybe. But was it believable? Absolutely not. Strike three! You're out!Had the film retained its ""is it medical or spiritual"" uncertainty throughout its length, I felt this would've been a fantastic success. But as it sits now, it's just a pile of rubbish.

Nothing is overdone, the acting isn't over-the-top, the CGI is very low-key, and while the typical horror scares are there (loud noises), they rely upon moods much more.In essence, this is kind of a courtroom drama. The duration of the movie is taking place as Father Moore is on trial, and Emily's story is told throughout the trial through flash-backs, a tape, and a letter. That's not at all what I was expecting, in fact I didn't even know there was a trial included, but it is effective in it's usage. What bothers me is that we never really know what Emily was like before the possession, that makes it a little more difficult to empathize with her situation, though how hard is it to feel sorry for a girl that has demons possessing her?I like the fact that there's not a lot of special effects in this film, that makes it feel more real to me. Plus, without the use of extreme makeup I feel it gives more credibilty than The Exorcist did. Not to mention the actual exorcism in this movie. The exorcism scene is so effective and gripping that it's hard to forget, the dual vocals, the screaming, I'm hardpressed to think of a more powerful scene in a movie that came out in 2005.The casting was, for me, perfect. Laura Linney and Campbell Scott as the two attorneys was completely believable, as was Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore. Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose was incredible, she really made you feel her suffering throughout the movie.For me, I think this was 2005's best movie. It's a shame it took me this long to actually see it, but it was worth the wait. No review I read did this film justice, and I doubt any review really will.

949906,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000BTJDG2,California Dreaming,"[2, 2]","(I was saddened to see that Roger Ebert died today.  I watched his show for many years, first with Gene Siskel, then Richard Roeper, and even the same show with A.O. Scott -- maybe the best living movie critic now -- and others.  I even watched his own show with Ignatiy Vishnevetsky and Christy Lemire, a very opposite pair that I thought worked very well.  Even though Mr. Ebert is now gone, his reviews will live on forever.)This film makes the assertion that people should only be held accountable for what they know, what they believe, when it comes to their actions.  Kind of a ""Good Samaritan"" concept, in the sense that, if you follow your beliefs and really try to help someone else, even if everything fails, you're really not guilty.Now, I usually don't like to start a review with a theme, but in this case, I think that it fits.  This is a supernatural thriller and courtroom drama rolled into one, but many people would argue that it's a religious movie.  That would not be true.  The theme of the film works inside and outside of religion for sure, and I always appreciate a film that picks a strong theme and sticks with it, as this one does.  So kudos there.And surely kudos needs to go to Laura Linney, one of my favorite actresses.  She is so good that she almost made ""The Mothman Prophecies"" fly, even though the film was so so.  And she gives another Linneyesque performance here, giving it her all as an attorney who's agnostic defending a priest who is very religious.  And that priest is Tom Wilkinson, a very fine actor who also always gives it his all, as he does here.  (If you haven't seen it I also highly recommend ""In the Bedroom,"" another film that allows the viewer to formulate his or her own opinions.)I'll give a pretty big recommendation to this film, even on a second viewing.

Was it the unexplainable that killed Emily or did she suffered from a disease medically acknowledged outside of the paranormal and yet ignored by her priest and exorcist?

Or ""Another, docudrama supposedly `based on a true story' as a ploy for pushing the director's political or religious agenda.""I was pleasantly proven very wrong! `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' is film making at it's very best with a story that kept me enthralled to the very end.The plot: for those of you who missed the trailers, the plot focuses on a Catholic priest (Tom Wilkinson) who's facing manslaughter charges for 19 year old Emily Rose's death during his exorcism. The prosecutor (played brilliantly by Campbell Scott) argues that Emily Rose suffered from schizophrenia and epilepsy and the priest irresponsibly denied her medical care.Defense attorney (Laura Linney) takes the bold stance that he is innocent because Emily was truly possessed, hence medical treatment would not have been able to save her.The tragedy of Emily unfolds via flashbacks during court testimony. The most creepy and dramatic element of the film is how it's 100% about the exorcism of Emily Rose. These characters live NO lives outside of the central plot. There is no small talk or pop culture references. We don't see Emily Rose with friends or studying in college, we just see her possessed. Like `Lipstick' this is highly effective is creating its own universe.The other major plus is that nothing supernatural happens. Hence no paranormal facts are argued. Emily's speaking in obscure languages and muscle spasms are not physically impossible. The trailer scene of people's eyes melting could just be a hallucination. The film rightfully does not ask us to make a factual or religious judgment on the validity of exorcism. Instead it asks us to feel for Emily and make a moral judgment on the character of the priest.Was the film scary? I did get a few chills from the classic film techniques of sudden screams in dark rooms with eerie music playing. But don't expect a lot of scary imagery or violence. It's rightfully a drama not horror.Just to throw in a few facts here which turned me off from the film. The promo claim it's ""based on a true story"". The ""true"" story was of a German immigrant girl who died at the hands of a German religious group. The were NOT Catholic, hence they cannot perform exorcism. To watch the History or Discovery channels documentaries on exorcism one might think they're common. They show ""exorcisms"" in Eastern Europe. What they fail to mention is that NONE of these priests are Catholic. The Catholic Church only grants permission for an exorcism about every 20 years because these ""possessed"" people as seen in the documentaries are indeed suffering from schizophrenia.",5,The Exorcist On Trial,1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,2697,"['When', 'first', 'started', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'film', 'dreaded', 'More', 'cheesy', 'Exorcist', 'backwash', 'docudrama', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'ploy', 'pushing', 'director', 'political', 'religious', 'agenda', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'proven', 'very', 'wrong', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'film', 'making', 'very', 'best', 'story', 'kept', 'enthralled', 'very', 'end.The', 'plot', 'who', 'missed', 'trailers', 'plot', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'facing', 'manslaughter', 'charges', '19', 'year', 'old', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'death', 'exorcism', 'prosecutor', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'suffered', 'schizophrenia', 'epilepsy', 'priest', 'irresponsibly', 'denied', 'medical', 'care.Defense', 'attorney', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'bold', 'stance', 'innocent', 'Emily', 'was', 'truly', 'possessed', 'hence', 'medical', 'treatment', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'save', 'her.The', 'tragedy', 'Emily', 'unfolds', 'flashbacks', 'court', 'testimony', 'most', 'creepy', 'dramatic', 'element', 'film', 'how', '100', '%', 'exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'characters', 'live', 'NO', 'lives', 'central', 'plot', 'small', 'talk', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'friends', 'studying', 'college', 'just', 'see', 'possessed', 'Lipstick', 'highly', 'effective', 'creating', 'own', 'universe.The', 'other', 'major', 'nothing', 'supernatural', 'happens', 'Hence', 'paranormal', 'facts', 'are', 'argued', 'Emily', 'speaking', 'obscure', 'languages', 'muscle', 'spasms', 'are', 'not', 'physically', 'impossible', 'trailer', 'scene', 'people', 'eyes', 'melting', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'hallucination', 'film', 'rightfully', 'not', 'ask', 'make', 'factual', 'religious', 'judgment', 'validity', 'exorcism', 'Instead', 'feel', 'Emily', 'make', 'moral', 'judgment', 'character', 'priest.Was', 'film', 'scary', 'did', 'get', 'few', 'chills', 'classic', 'film', 'techniques', 'sudden', 'screams', 'dark', 'rooms', 'eerie', 'music', 'playing', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'scary', 'imagery', 'violence', 'rightfully', 'drama', 'not', 'horror.Just', 'throw', 'few', 'facts', 'here', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'promo', 'claim', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'German', 'immigrant', 'girl', 'who', 'died', 'hands', 'German', 'religious', 'group', 'were', 'NOT', 'Catholic', 'hence', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'watch', 'History', 'Discovery', 'channels', 'documentaries', 'exorcism', 'one', 'might', 'think', ""'re"", 'common', 'show', 'exorcisms', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'What', 'fail', 'mention', 'NONE', 'priests', 'are', 'Catholic', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'only', 'permission', 'exorcism', '20', 'years', 'possessed', 'people', 'seen', 'documentaries', 'are', 'indeed', 'suffering', 'schizophrenia']",N/A

What holds it back is two things--as interesting as the character's struggles are, they could have been more richly drawn. The result feels more like chess pieces moving about a board than people being tormented by their beliefs. Also, the medical aspects of the case are very poorly handled--the diagnosis of epilepsy is made without ruling out other likely causes, such as brain tumor, metabolic disorder. This may seem nit-picky, but anyone who remembers how medicine was used in the Exorcist will know that delving into this and the invasion of the body that it brings would make an effective foil to the demonic invasion.

949917,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000BTJDG2,"Cloud ""...""","[5, 9]","Many horror films lately are built so that it uses disorienting camera trickery and loud music jolts and call it a horror film. Many well done ones were more about atmosphere and tension. This film does have it where you feel slightly unnerved and not extremely calm although as a film it might have certain elements you may not like.Based on a true story, the story tells of Emily Rose, a 19 year old college student who died. The main suspect is Father Moore, who disallowed any medical or hospitalization of Emily. Why? Well it's believed that she is the carrier of a demon and a victim of possession. After a failed exorcism she turns up dead so was it his fault or something else entirely? Well I might as well say it now, the film doesn't answer this and I bet it was designed so it wouldn't.I always find it funny that Muslims, Buddhists and Catholics will so strongly believe in a higher power(naturally God or Jesus Christ or Allah) and yet we completely shoot down any possibility or demons or creatures. We're interested in the stars and possible planets capable of supporting life yet we find aliens and UFO phenomenons absolute sci-fi nerd nonsense. So when the prosecutor mentions he's a man of faith, we go ""you believe in one higher power but not the other?""The film doesn't really rely on shock tactics like Boogeyman or Amityville Horror remake but it relies mainly on mood. In other words, the filmmakers are trying to mess with your head and leave you uneasy and it's quite effective. There is a couple jump scenes as I call them but they're few and far between.Performance-wise is straight across the board(except for whoever played the prosecutor. His cry baby objections get grating). Laura Linney is always reliable, being a very versatile actress and Tom Wilkinson, last seen playing a mob boss in Batman Begins is effective as Father Moore. In particular mention is Jennifer Carpenter playing our unfortunate title character. A lot of her performance is for real and that makes it more chilling and quite a lung power on her.Where the film falls on its face is where information is told to us in periodic moments so something new shows up.

949924,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000BTJDG2,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[1, 2]","The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is based on the story of Anneliese Michel, a German student who, in the mid-1970s, was the subject of one of the rare exorcisms sanctioned by the Church in modern times. The results were less than ideal: Anneliese died of starvation, and her parents and the priests involved in the exorcism were put on trial for negligent homicide.In the film, Anneliese has become young Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a devout small town American girl who heads off to a big city college and goes and gets herself possessed. The family priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), is called in after Emily returns home. Believing she is possessed, he performs an exorcism that goes awry, resulting in his standing trial for her death.Trying the case are prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a self-described ""man of faith"" who nonetheless scoffs at the idea of demonic possession, and Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), an agnostic corporate attorney looking to climb the ladder in her firm. Thomas attempts to establish a medical basis for Emily's death, while Erin - thanks to some creepy moments courtesy of the ""dark forces"" (as Father Moore calls them) surrounding the trial, comes to realize there may be some credence to the priest's story.Anyone who's seen the previews and is coming into this movie expecting a straight-up horror flick is going to be disappointed. What we have here is a courtroom drama, punctuated by horrific flashbacks. Naturally, any movie that deals with the concept of demonic infestation has to be careful it doesn't draw too many comparisons to the Big Kahuna of the subject, ""The Exorcist."" Fortunately (or not, depending on how big a ""Law & Order"" fan you are), ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" dwells less on the possession itself than on the subsequent trial. There are elements of Friedkin's classic here, as any possession movie is going to contain creepy demon fu and a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. But ""Emily"" also pulls in references to ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""Ghostbusters"" (you'll know it when you see it) as well.Linney, as always, does a fine job, and Wilkinson is believable as the tormented priest, but Scott is stuck playing a guy who's such a douchebag he doesn't see the hypocrisy in decrying a ritual based on ""archaic mythology"" when he himself is a Christian (he also has one of those James Keach moustaches favored by LAPD officers). Then again, if anyone gets short shrift, it's Jennifer Carpenter, whose Emily Rose spends most of the film in painful contortions and barking in Aramaic (maybe Mel Gibson can find a part for her in his next movie).I have to admit, I don't believe in this stuff any more than Scott's character, and yet it still freaks me out. The exorcism scenes are reminiscent of the 1974 film (which I count among the scariest of all time), without being utterly derivative. And even the idea that the defense could trot out some of the stuff they did during the trial and not get laughed out of the courthouse was amusing in it's own way.Why Sony decided to assemble a cast that includes the likes of Linney and Wilkinson and then place the untested Derrickson at the helm is beyond me, however. In a more capable director's hands, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" could have been both a gripping courtroom drama and a chilling ""is she or isn't she?"" horror tale. What we have instead is a movie that drifts, almost unmanned, from plot point to plot point. A few more scares and a little less chatter from the principals would have made ""Emily"" much more memorable.",3,"Sure it's milking the ""franchise"", but fairly good for todays standards",1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,3573,"['Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'based', 'story', 'Anneliese', 'Michel', 'German', 'student', 'who', 'mid-1970s', 'was', 'subject', 'one', 'rare', 'exorcisms', 'sanctioned', 'Church', 'modern', 'times', 'results', 'were', 'less', 'ideal', 'Anneliese', 'died', 'starvation', 'parents', 'priests', 'involved', 'exorcism', 'were', 'put', 'trial', 'negligent', 'homicide.In', 'film', 'Anneliese', 'become', 'young', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'devout', 'small', 'town', 'American', 'girl', 'who', 'big', 'city', 'college', 'possessed', 'family', 'priest', 'Father', 'Moore', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'called', 'Emily', 'home', 'Believing', 'possessed', 'exorcism', 'awry', 'resulting', 'standing', 'trial', 'death.Trying', 'case', 'are', 'prosecutor', 'Ethan', 'Thomas', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'self-described', 'man', 'faith', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'scoffs', 'idea', 'demonic', 'possession', 'Erin', 'Bruner', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'agnostic', 'corporate', 'attorney', 'looking', 'climb', 'ladder', 'firm', 'Thomas', 'establish', 'medical', 'basis', 'Emily', 'death', 'Erin', 'thanks', 'creepy', 'moments', 'courtesy', 'dark', 'forces', 'Father', 'Moore', 'surrounding', 'trial', 'realize', 'may', 'be', 'credence', 'priest', 'story.Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'previews', 'coming', 'movie', 'expecting', 'straight-up', 'horror', 'flick', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'punctuated', 'horrific', 'flashbacks', 'Naturally', 'movie', 'deals', 'concept', 'demonic', 'infestation', 'be', 'careful', ""n't"", 'draw', 'too', 'many', 'comparisons', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'subject', 'Exorcist', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'depending', 'how', 'big', 'Law', 'Order', 'fan', 'are', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'less', 'possession', 'subsequent', 'trial', 'are', 'elements', 'Friedkin', 'classic', 'here', 'possession', 'movie', 'going', 'contain', 'creepy', 'demon', 'fu', 'final', 'confrontation', 'forces', 'good', 'evil', 'Emily', 'also', 'references', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Ghostbusters', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'well.Linney', 'always', 'fine', 'job', 'Wilkinson', 'believable', 'tormented', 'priest', 'Scott', 'stuck', 'playing', 'guy', 'who', 'douchebag', ""n't"", 'see', 'hypocrisy', 'decrying', 'ritual', 'based', 'archaic', 'mythology', 'when', 'Christian', 'also', 'one', 'James', 'Keach', 'moustaches', 'favored', 'LAPD', 'officers', 'Then', 'again', 'anyone', 'short', 'shrift', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'most', 'film', 'painful', 'contortions', 'barking', 'Aramaic', 'maybe', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'can', 'find', 'part', 'next', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'stuff', 'more', 'Scott', 'character', 'yet', 'still', 'freaks', 'out', 'exorcism', 'scenes', 'are', 'reminiscent', '1974', 'film', 'count', 'scariest', 'time', 'being', 'utterly', 'derivative', 'even', 'idea', 'defense', 'could', 'trot', 'out', 'stuff', 'did', 'trial', 'not', 'get', 'laughed', 'courthouse', 'was', 'amusing', 'own', 'way.Why', 'Sony', 'decided', 'assemble', 'cast', 'likes', 'Linney', 'Wilkinson', 'then', 'place', 'untested', 'Derrickson', 'helm', 'however', 'more', 'capable', 'director', 'hands', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'gripping', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'chilling', ""n't"", 'horror', 'tale', 'What', 'have', 'instead', 'movie', 'almost', 'unmanned', 'plot', 'point', 'plot', 'point', 'few', 'more', 'scares', 'little', 'less', 'chatter', 'principals', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Emily', 'much', 'more', 'memorable']",N/A

Why did they want it to seem like it was a supernatural thriller a la Stigmata?I don't know, because it's a pretty good courtroom drama, and made more interesting by having an element of horror about it, an element of the supernatural. However, at heart, this is a movie about whether or not those things *could* exist, and respecting those people who believe it, and not primarily a movie about demons trying to kill people. It's a movie about the role that faith plays in our lives.All that said, the horror-elements are well-done. My fiancee jumped five or six times during the film. :) Its horror is mainly found in suspense; not a lot actually *happens* other than Emily Rose looking evil and twisted at the camera, but it's still effective and the exorcism scene is excellent and powerful.It claims to be based on a true story. I don't know the details of that true story, or how close this movie gets to it, but I can believe that something like this could happen. This is more of a philosophical piece than a modern horror flick (it has nothing in common with, say, Saw or Scream), but I'm here to tell you--that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's room for Saws and Screams, and room for this movie, too. It's only unfortunate that the film's creators didn't think it would sell as well, if they were straight-forward as to what it's actually about.Bottom line: this movie is thought-provoking, interesting and entertaining.

Definitely the best exorcism movie we had since THE EXORCIST!!If you liked the exorcist then you should get this one too!!... for sure!!!...Directed and Written by Scott Derrickson, this little flick should keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end!!!... It is a true story about the exorcism of  Anneliese Michel, a simple girl who manage to be possessed by the mosts feared and crual demons known  in the Christian Mythology, CAIN, NERO, LEGION, BELIAL and even LUCIFER himself and JUDAS ISCARIOT!!!!....The movie mostly focus on lawyer Erin Bruner who's trying to defend father Richard Moore who is accused of killing the young Anneliese (Emily Rose) after performing an exorcism to try to save her. The movie is in most part about the trial itself and what happened to Emily before and after being possessed.The trial itself i think was the only negative comment i had about the movie before seeing it. People were saying that it was mostly good but that there was too much trial and court scenes.Personally, it didn't bother me at all...In fact, those ""trial"" scenes are probably the ONLY break that you will have before it goes back to Emily and her demons again!!!...Trust me!!.....After the first ""possession"" scenes you will wish the movie goes back to the trial and court part so that you can relax a little bit......It is when they play the actual ""tape"" (audio recording) of the final exorcism that the movie reaches its peak!!!...the movie goes back to Emily and you can see and live that lasts moments that the people in court can only hear on the audio tape.....Besides all the horror and demons and possession scenes in  here, the movie also delivers a strong message of hope and faith for people of all kinds.For people that might be interested, Amazon actually have a DVD of the REAL TAPES!!!!!, Its call : ANNALIESE : THE EXORCISTS TAPES....give it a try if you dare!!!!!  5 stars well earned for a real scary movie!!!!!!..so buckle your seat belts and don't forget your oxygen masks folks!!!!!..

949934,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000BTJDG2,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE (a/k/a THE EXORCISM OF MS. EMILY ROSE, Dir. Scott Derrickson, 2005, 118 minutes) ~ This is one of those iffy propositions when it comes to a review: the entire film is almost exclusively in the eye of the beholder. It is a brilliant combination of Roman Catholic exorcism on the one hand and on the other it is a (silly and tedious) courtroom drama.If you would like my opinion--hell, you're getting it no matter what--I think this film was questioning the very idea of the feasibility of demonic possession of humans. Most cultures, from the first ones we can study to modern America, has some manner of belief in demonic possession of things or places at the very least. This film throws a story into our faces,Rashomon-style with two disparate viewpoints, and asks us to decide.Tom Wilkinson, who believe it or not was a bit on the unknown side when he did this, plays Father Moore. Moore is in jail on a charge of murder, which everyone would really like to see reduced to a plea to negligent homicide then we can all go home, thank you very little. However, Father Moore couldn't care less about his fate: he wants to tell the demonic possession story of young Ms. Emily Rose (a creepy yet awful Jennifer Carpenter, who bears some resemblance to late pop star Karen Carpenter).Father Moore agrees to the diocese-appointed defense attorney, played by Laura Linney, only if she agrees to have an open mind about possession and demons. She is, naturally, an agnostic but not of the typical combative, belligerent type. She seems deeply impressed and moved by Father Moore. I was impressed by the horror scenes which mostly consisted of Jennifer Carpenter screaming her lungs out--but then the scene would be replayed again, the second time with a more logical, medical viewpoint to explain things.Which viewpoint was right? Which of the two viewpoints really happened? Is Father Moore's tape of the failed exorcism one of those paranormal-TV-show-tapes, or is it real?This film was quite stunning for the time it was released (not that much paranormal garbage on TV yet, and certainly nothing centering around exorcism). I recall the hype and the excitement when I watched it the first time. That was once only--I recently watched it again and I found some stupid problems:1. Exorcism or not, this entire storyline is so asinine it strains credibility. If a family exercised their religious freedom and put their very ill daughter ""completely in the care of"" a Catholic priest, and then she died, oh well, why even explain how dumb it all is ....2. This, if you simply accept the story as-is, would NEVER go to trail, even in Hollyweirdland. There is one simple reason and even a kid would figure it out rapidly: who the heck would want to take it to trial? It strains credulity to the point of cerebral hemorrhage to think anyone would blame Father Moore for negligence, let alone murder.3. If you accept this story as-is, well, Father Moore was far from negligent. He seemed to be in touch with Emily's physician (her primary, whom we never see) and he brings in his own expert physician to assist with the exorcism. (That is common in the Catholic Church, but not the way it is shown here.) In short, Father Moore all by his little lonesome could have demolished the prosecution with his evidence of his care for Emily.4. Most viewers will come away from this film not caring whether Emily was possessed, very ill, allergic to her meds, or just plain whack-a-doodles. This film has been hyped from day one as being based on a true story. That, my friends, is not true. It is an amalgamation of the very few known exorcisms that have occurred in America, and in that regard it isn't bad. All I say is that they should not have lied about it in the hype.Still, for all its elements and for being ahead of its time it is worth one viewing if this sort of thing interests you. I'd say it is all-in-all a shameless rip-off ofThe Exorcist (1973)and especiallyExorcist III: Legion (1990)(see my review), but, hey, it's fiction, right?Right??",3,At least we got to know Tom Wilkinson a bit better in this,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,4066,"['EXORCISM', 'OF', 'EMILY', 'ROSE', 'EXORCISM', 'OF', 'MS.', 'EMILY', 'ROSE', 'Dir', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', '2005', '118', 'minutes', '~', 'one', 'iffy', 'propositions', 'when', 'review', 'entire', 'film', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'eye', 'beholder', 'brilliant', 'combination', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'exorcism', 'one', 'hand', 'other', 'silly', 'tedious', 'courtroom', 'drama.If', 'would', 'like', 'opinion', 'hell', ""'re"", 'getting', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'questioning', 'very', 'idea', 'feasibility', 'demonic', 'possession', 'humans', 'Most', 'cultures', 'first', 'ones', 'can', 'study', 'modern', 'America', 'manner', 'belief', 'demonic', 'possession', 'things', 'places', 'very', 'least', 'film', 'story', 'Rashomon-style', 'two', 'disparate', 'viewpoints', 'decide.Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'believe', 'not', 'was', 'bit', 'unknown', 'side', 'when', 'did', 'Father', 'Moore', 'Moore', 'jail', 'charge', 'murder', 'everyone', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'reduced', 'plea', 'negligent', 'homicide', 'then', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'thank', 'very', 'little', 'However', 'Father', 'Moore', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'fate', 'tell', 'demonic', 'possession', 'story', 'young', 'Ms.', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'creepy', 'yet', 'awful', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'resemblance', 'late', 'pop', 'star', 'Karen', 'Carpenter', 'Moore', 'diocese-appointed', 'defense', 'attorney', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'only', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'possession', 'demons', 'naturally', 'agnostic', 'not', 'typical', 'combative', 'belligerent', 'type', 'deeply', 'impressed', 'moved', 'Father', 'Moore', 'was', 'impressed', 'horror', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'consisted', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'screaming', 'lungs', 'out', 'then', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'replayed', 'again', 'second', 'time', 'more', 'logical', 'medical', 'viewpoint', 'explain', 'things.Which', 'viewpoint', 'was', 'right', 'Which', 'two', 'viewpoints', 'really', 'happened', 'Father', 'Moore', 'tape', 'failed', 'exorcism', 'one', 'paranormal-TV-show-tapes', 'real', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'stunning', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'paranormal', 'garbage', 'TV', 'yet', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'centering', 'exorcism', 'recall', 'hype', 'excitement', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'once', 'only', 'recently', 'watched', 'again', 'found', 'stupid', 'problems:1', 'Exorcism', 'not', 'entire', 'storyline', 'so', 'asinine', 'credibility', 'family', 'exercised', 'religious', 'freedom', 'put', 'very', 'ill', 'daughter', 'completely', 'care', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'then', 'died', 'oh', 'well', 'why', 'even', 'explain', 'how', 'dumb', '.2', 'simply', 'accept', 'story', 'as-is', 'would', 'NEVER', 'go', 'trail', 'even', 'Hollyweirdland', 'one', 'simple', 'reason', 'even', 'kid', 'would', 'figure', 'out', 'rapidly', 'who', 'heck', 'would', 'want', 'take', 'trial', 'credulity', 'point', 'cerebral', 'hemorrhage', 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'blame', 'Father', 'Moore', 'negligence', 'let', 'alone', 'murder.3', 'accept', 'story', 'as-is', 'well', 'Father', 'Moore', 'was', 'far', 'negligent', 'seemed', 'be', 'touch', 'Emily', 'physician', 'primary', 'whom', 'never', 'see', 'own', 'expert', 'physician', 'assist', 'exorcism', 'common', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'not', 'way', 'shown', 'here', 'short', 'Father', 'Moore', 'little', 'lonesome', 'could', 'have', 'demolished', 'prosecution', 'evidence', 'care', 'Emily.4', 'Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'not', 'caring', 'Emily', 'was', 'possessed', 'very', 'ill', 'allergic', 'meds', 'just', 'plain', 'whack-a-doodles', 'film', 'been', 'hyped', 'day', 'one', 'being', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'friends', 'not', 'true', 'amalgamation', 'very', 'few', 'known', 'exorcisms', 'have', 'occurred', 'America', 'regard', ""n't"", 'bad', 'say', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'lied', 'hype.Still', 'elements', 'being', 'ahead', 'time', 'worth', 'one', 'viewing', 'sort', 'thing', 'interests', ""'d"", 'say', 'all-in-all', 'shameless', 'rip-off', 'ofThe', 'Exorcist', '1973', 'especiallyExorcist', 'III', 'Legion', '1990', 'see', 'review', 'hey', 'fiction', 'right', 'Right']",N/A

949939,ANCNEU3MD7RR,B000BTJDG2,FizzWiz,"[1, 2]","Probably one of Laura Linney's most popular films to date, she shows her skills as emotionally and dramatically as possible without being too corny impeccably!  Tom Wilkinson plays great as a priest, and relatively new newcomer Jennifer Carpenter (suggested by Linney) is amazing.  You may have a hard time telling when slight special effects are used and when it's Carpenter performing some odd twist or contortion.  For her to practice this role, you can only imagine how many times she screamed in a day and how physically challenging this role may've been.  She was so perfect that she had scared cameramen into thinking that she really got demented.  Carpenter also had to speak in 6 different languages in one point of the movie, and it must have been difficult to pronounce the words correctly.  Campbell Scott does well as a modern Christian lawyer so to speak.  The director, Scott Derrickson, provides some interesting feedback on the movie as he says that one of his favorite scary films of all time had Campbell Scott's father in the movie, and Derrickson had no idea until after he picked Campbell Scott that the two are related.  Ironically, both actors played lawyers, so you can expect Scott's performance on this movie would be very fitting.  Shohreh Aghdashloo, who plays Dr. Adani, is another eye catcher even though her role is small.  Her role is very important to the movie as it helps give the case a necessary edge for the defense to have any kind of hope at all.  Her appearance and accent add to the movie to make it more intellectually stimulating.  As a courtroom horror film, this has probably hit a more unique genre.  It's composed well enough that the horror is not too corny, and the courtroom action does not get too boring unless you have little patience.  There is supposedly a play of colors in the movie in which orange represents terror, white supposedly has a different meaning, and green had a supposed meaning too.  There are also hard to notice nuances that you probably wouldn't notice unless you listened to the commentary such as Derrickson making a big deal about a yellow (or maybe blue?) brush in the background of a frame or a time when lawyer Erin Bruner (Linney) whispers to Father Moore (Wilkinson) rather than talks to him normally.  Some scenes were removed because Linney is allergic to cats, and some scenes were considered too gruesome to keep the film rated PG-13 surprisingly.

949940,A1R6KGK8TRJAGV,B000BTJDG2,"Free Thinker ""Amazon made me remove my blog s...","[3, 4]","When I review a film I ask myself two questions: 1. what did its producers seek to accomplish by making it; and 2. did they achieve their goal?It's clear that this film was made to disturb its audience.  Since it succeeded in disturbing me I give it a five.  It was eerie as hell, literally!  There is an underlying feel of malevolence that is accomplished through clever use of lighting and other cinemagraphic techniques.  There is strong character development of all the major figures.  There is both internal and external conflict.  The dialogue was exceptionally well written.  In short, the production values were excellent.  The result is a creepy movie that has the power to make even the most skeptical (or devout) among us scared of the Devil.So much for the ""beautiful"" part of the movie.  Now on to the ""lies.""  Simply put, it is a work of fiction based very, VERY loosely on actual events.The real story is this:  In 1960s Germany there was a teenage girl named Anneliese Michel.  She was born in into an ultra-strict Catholic family that raised her in its pre-Vatican II interpretation of the faith; i.e. heavy on guilt and fear.In 1969, while attending university, she began to wake in the night feeling paralyzed, with a heavy weight on her chest.  Now, in 2006 her condition would easily be diagnosed as sleep paralysis, a fairly common condition where the brain wakes up without flipping on the ""switch"" that allows one to control their limbs.The physicians she saw were unable to provide a firm diagnosis for her condition.  They eventually misdiagnosed her as having epilepsy and prescribed drugs which proved ineffective.The failure of medical science to help her encouraged Anneliese to believe her malady was spiritual. Since Catholic rituals failed to help as well she concluded that she was possessed with unusually strong demons, a belief encouraged by family and clergy.The resulting mental stress was exascerbated by bumbling physicians who prescribed drugs that had deleterious effects on her brain, such as depriving its cells of sodium.  In summary, by the night of her exorcism she was in a semi-psychotic state caused by improper medications and aggravated by her conviction that demons were inside of her.The exorcism failed to work of course, since her real problem wasn't the Devil but physical and religious ""treatments"" which weren't just useless but actually harmful to her.In the end she died from  one of her medications inducing oxygen deprivation to her body.  In fact the medicine should never have been prescribed.That is the far more mundane truth behind this dramatic and almost entirely fictional movie.  But don't take my word for it.  Check out wikipedia.com's article entitled ""Anneliese Michel"" or just Google the name.  The facts I have shared in this review are extremely well documented.I say none of this to detract from the film, which was a finely crafted piece of fiction.  Watch it if you want to get goosebumps.  Just don't take it for more than it is.

949941,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B000BTJDG2,F. S. L'hoir,"[3, 7]","""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" held my interest from beginning to end. The film is well acted; the direction is judicious; and the special effects are riveting and yet restrained (There is no ""yuck"" factor of spewing green pea soup!). I also enjoyed the original manner in which the director interspersed the courtroom scenes with the ""horror"" scenes, which are intentionally left ambiguous. In other words, the director leaves it to the viewer to decide whether the events are figments of the girl's hysterical imagination, brought on by physical reasons, or an actual possession by demonic forces. The extra featurettes are very interesting, especially the one in which the production designers explain their symbolic color schemes and the special effects.Having acknowledged the film's strengths, I am not certain that I was entirely convinced by the courtroom scenes, when I often knew the exact response that one attorney was about to give the other (Too many episodes of ""Law and Order""?). Also, I was not particularly frightened by the hysteria-or-demon sequences. I suppose as a college professor I can understand why  a student might envision paranormal manifestations during final exams (although I would attribute the phenomenon to lack of sleep--or study--rather than to demonic possession).On the whole, I think that the story would have worked better had it been set, not in middle America, but in Germany (where the story on which the film is based originated). I might then have bought the fact that the girl had studied Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic in her catechism class (I wonder how many such classes in the United States still offer even Latin!). Were the film set in ""another"" country, I believe that the audience could have suspended their disbelief more easily, and accepted the plausibility not only of the courtroom sequences [Imagine the barristers and judges in periwigs!] but also of the demonic possession [One of the frightening aspects of ""The Others"" is that it was set in the fog on the Channel Island of Jersey.].Perhaps I am being overly cynical. But, in an era when every student I know owns a cell phone and has access to instant messaging, the premise of the girl alone in her dorm room being possessed by demons [real or imagined] is a bit hard to swallow.",4,Three-and-Three-Quarter's Stars***+++,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2299,"['Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'held', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'direction', 'judicious', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'riveting', 'yet', 'restrained', 'yuck', 'factor', 'spewing', 'green', 'pea', 'soup', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'manner', 'director', 'interspersed', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'horror', 'scenes', 'are', 'intentionally', 'left', 'ambiguous', 'other', 'words', 'director', 'viewer', 'decide', 'events', 'are', 'figments', 'girl', 'hysterical', 'imagination', 'brought', 'physical', 'reasons', 'actual', 'possession', 'demonic', 'forces', 'extra', 'featurettes', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'especially', 'one', 'production', 'designers', 'explain', 'symbolic', 'color', 'schemes', 'special', 'effects.Having', 'acknowledged', 'film', 'strengths', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'was', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'when', 'often', 'knew', 'exact', 'response', 'one', 'attorney', 'was', 'give', 'other', 'Too', 'many', 'episodes', 'Law', 'Order', 'Also', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'frightened', 'hysteria-or-demon', 'sequences', 'suppose', 'college', 'professor', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'student', 'might', 'envision', 'paranormal', 'manifestations', 'final', 'exams', 'would', 'attribute', 'phenomenon', 'lack', 'sleep', 'study', 'rather', 'demonic', 'possession', 'whole', 'think', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'not', 'middle', 'America', 'Germany', 'where', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'originated', 'might', 'then', 'have', 'bought', 'fact', 'girl', 'had', 'studied', 'Latin', 'Greek', 'Hebrew', 'Aramaic', 'catechism', 'class', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'such', 'classes', 'United', 'States', 'still', 'offer', 'even', 'Latin', 'Were', 'film', 'set', 'country', 'believe', 'audience', 'could', 'have', 'suspended', 'disbelief', 'more', 'easily', 'accepted', 'plausibility', 'not', 'only', 'courtroom', '[', 'Imagine', 'barristers', 'judges', 'periwigs', ']', 'also', 'demonic', 'possession', '[', 'One', 'frightening', 'aspects', 'Others', 'was', 'set', 'fog', 'Channel', 'Island', 'Jersey', ']', '.Perhaps', 'am', 'being', 'overly', 'cynical', 'era', 'when', 'student', 'know', 'cell', 'phone', 'access', 'instant', 'messaging', 'premise', 'girl', 'alone', 'dorm', 'room', 'being', 'possessed', 'demons', '[', 'real', 'imagined', ']', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow']",N/A

It seems that the 'Exorcist' plot regimen always seems to consist of long discourses on what ""can't happen"" in the real world only the completely refute it with a pulse pounding finale. Of course, the real bonus is knowing that this story of 'demonic possession' is based on actual events (if you believe German newspaper accounts), which must have been hushed up by the Catholic Church as I don't seem to recall any 'sanctioned' exorcism headlines in my local newspaper (except perhaps 'The Enquirer'). Supposedly the Catholic Church later recanted the results of the exorcism but I doubt anybody seeing this film will do the same.As I mentioned above, this is like a court-TV episode (featuring high caliber actors) with all of the attendant witnesses and theories coming first. Then it's 'exorcism' time when the 'last' witness is called to relate the details of the exorcism. And believe me, if you have any kind of religious background, this is the sequence that will have you clutching your crucifix and dousing your body with holy water as each expected 'exorcism' detail is perfectly recreated to 'freaky' perfection.That said, I'm sure there are quite a few skeptics who insist they don't believe in the devil and demons so this movie won't affect them. Normally I would agree, except for the fact that this film has the best horror movie cast since the original ""Exorcist."" However, along with 'name' actors like Laura Linney (""Kinsey""), Tom Wilkinson (""Batman Begins""), and Campbell Scott (""Roger Dodger"") the actress whose performance will rivet you to the edge of your seat is newcomer Jennifer Carpenter as 'Emily Rose'.

I wish that I hadn't listened to the haters and actually gone to see this movie on the big screen, because I ended up enjoying it on DVD. My hesitance to see the movie came primarily from the fact that I knew that about half of the movie took place in a courtroom. But what seems like a completely unworkable concept, a courtroom drama with a demon, actually ends up being a fairly effective and creepy horror movie. The Ghoulie Guru Jury finds the Exorcism of Emily Rose Not Guilty of being a bad movie.The only parts that don't work in this movie are the courtroom scenes. I don't like courtroom dramas, and this one has all the clich&eacute;d moments. The impassioned speeches from the defense, the surprise witnesses, the whole bit. I don't like movies where you spend 90 minutes waiting for the verdict to be passed down by the jury. But, if you can get through the courtroom scenes, there are some great moments in this movie. I can't help but think that this movie would have been so much scarier if it had been linear. Most of the scariest scenes are told in flashback, which takes away all their venom. I already know that the priest survives the scary exorcism scenes because he's the one telling the story. It's the same thing that crippled the Exorcist prequel. We all know that Father Merrin survives, so why should we be scared? However, if they had told the story linearly, then the whole structure would have been even stranger. You would have had 45 minutes of a scary movie and then 45 minutes of a courtroom drama. As it is, mixing the two up seems to be the only way to really make this movie work.In the end, I wound up liking this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I also think it's a better demonic possession movie than either of the Exorcist prequels. The scenes of Emily when she's possessed are almost as scary as some of the better moments from the original Exorcist. I also like the fact that the movie grounded the idea of demonic possession in medical fact, a bit like the old 70's movie THE ENTITY. It's not a perfect horror movie, because the courtroom scenes really do drag the thing to a grinding halt every time, but this is a solid rental for fans of the genre and might be worth adding to your collection if you can't get enough of the demon possession movies.",3,Not Guilty,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,2514,"['WARNING', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'everything', 'had', 'heard', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'essentially', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'Halloween', 'Special', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'listened', 'haters', 'actually', 'gone', 'see', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'DVD', 'hesitance', 'see', 'movie', 'came', 'primarily', 'fact', 'knew', 'half', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'courtroom', 'what', 'completely', 'unworkable', 'concept', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'demon', 'actually', 'up', 'being', 'fairly', 'effective', 'creepy', 'horror', 'movie', 'Ghoulie', 'Guru', 'Jury', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Not', 'Guilty', 'being', 'bad', 'movie.The', 'only', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', 'are', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'one', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'moments', 'impassioned', 'speeches', 'defense', 'surprise', 'whole', 'bit', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'waiting', 'verdict', 'be', 'passed', 'down', 'jury', 'can', 'get', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'scarier', 'had', 'been', 'linear', 'Most', 'scariest', 'scenes', 'are', 'told', 'flashback', 'away', 'venom', 'already', 'know', 'priest', 'scary', 'exorcism', 'scenes', 'one', 'telling', 'story', 'same', 'thing', 'crippled', 'Exorcist', 'prequel', 'know', 'Father', 'Merrin', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'scared', 'However', 'had', 'told', 'story', 'linearly', 'then', 'whole', 'structure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'stranger', 'would', 'have', 'had', '45', 'minutes', 'scary', 'movie', 'then', '45', 'minutes', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'mixing', 'two', 'up', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'end', 'wound', 'up', 'liking', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'also', 'think', 'better', 'demonic', 'possession', 'movie', 'Exorcist', 'prequels', 'scenes', 'Emily', 'when', 'possessed', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'scary', 'better', 'moments', 'original', 'Exorcist', 'also', 'fact', 'movie', 'grounded', 'idea', 'demonic', 'possession', 'medical', 'fact', 'bit', 'old', '70', 'movie', 'THE', 'ENTITY', 'not', 'perfect', 'horror', 'movie', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'really', 'do', 'drag', 'thing', 'grinding', 'halt', 'time', 'solid', 'rental', 'fans', 'genre', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'demon', 'possession', 'movies']",N/A

Bootle,"[0, 1]","The movie is quite interesting with the court proceedings and I could determine from the film why Emily Rose continued to be subjected to attacks from Demonic spirits. These Satanic or demonic attacks happen if people have ""unclean"" things or are disobedient to God or are not living a life of full committment to the lord God or if there is a curse. The Holy Bible is very clear that people who live a life of faithful committment to the lord God will have Gods protection by coming to the lord God through Jesus Christ but NOT THE MOTHER MARY as shown in the Emily Rose movie. This is the crux of the movie.Emily Rose did not recieve the lord Gods protection from the continued attacks by demonic forces because the priest was calling on the ""mother Mary's"" protection hence he was preaching counterfeit scriptures when the Holy Bible clearly states the lord Gods protection must be accessed by coming to God through Jesus Christ. Satans existence on earth is to decieve people away from the lord God and to have people worship himself instead. It is very well known that the mormon churches, JW's, and other churches use clearly modified and COUNTERFEIT SCRIPTURES to decieve ""followers"" away from the lord Gods salvation and protection from Satans demonic forces. These counterfeit churches are a part of Satans empire to decieve would be followers away from the lord God.""Therefor, there is now no condemnation for those whom are in CHRIST JESUS, because through Christ Jesus the law of the spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death."" (Romans 8:1-2).People will come to know that Satans demonic forces and the lord Gods dominion are real. The Demonic forces tend to attack ""followers"" if they are disobedient (to God) and ""unbelievers"" (the general public) who don't live committed christian lives and therefore don't have Gods protection. In the supernatural world Satan is much lower than the lord God and must have a valid claim against Gods followers eg disobedience (to God), being an ""unbeliever"" before Satan will attack people but the lord God has power over Satan's domain. By living a life of committment to the lord God and obeying his commands in the Holy Bible Gods faithful followers will not be harmed by these Demonic forces. This is why Gods committed followers have to be clean from Satans traits eg pride,arrogance, greed,vanity, sexual ""lust"" (flesh). Otherwise Satans demonic forces will decieve, influence and tempt people to engage in these traits to perpetrate violence and sin against other people. Provided Gods followers are obedient to the lord Gods precepts and commands these demonic forces should not be able to harm you.Although I am living in a life of committment to the lord God I experienced a strong attack by demonic spiritual forces very quickly after I began to watch this movie during the evening of Thursday 7 November 2013 (NZ time). The demonic forces came into the home with the DVD movie a ""window"" for them to enter the home. My appendix was pinched and the demonic forces occupied my facial muscles and tried to stop me from reading the biblical ""blood scriptures."" The demonic spiritual forces fled after I finished repeatedly praying the blood scriptures aloud. However, the demonic attacks returned during the night when I was in bed but after reading the ""blood scriptures"" aloud they quickly fled after trying to occupy my body and they did not return.If you experience Satanic or Demonic spiritual attacks then you should read the biblical blood scriptures:NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD (title).""We overcome Satan when we testify personally to what the word of God says the blood of JESUS does for us.Through the blood of JESUS, I am redeemed out of the hand of the devil.Through the blood of JESUS, all my sins are forgiven.Through the blood of JESUS, I am continually being cleansed from all sin.Through the blood of JESUS, I am justified, made righteous, just-as-if-ied never sinned.Through the blood of JESUS, I am sanctified, made holy, set apart to God.Through the blood of JESUS, I have boldness to enter into the presence of God.The blood of JESUS cries out continually to God in heaven on my behalf.I give mighty praise and thanks to the lord God, the most high, i pray in Jesus Christ name, amen, hallelujah.""",4,EMILY ROSE FILM,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,4285,"['movie', 'quite', 'interesting', 'court', 'proceedings', 'could',

The fact that this film adaptation of an actual event results in a work of such touching tenderness is due to the imagination and artistry of writer Paul Harris Boardman and co-writer and director Scott Derrickson, as well as a fine cast of some of our best actors.  This is not a horror flick: this is a thinking person's film that has the courage to discuss the possibilities of things on one can explain.Father Moore (a brilliant Tom Wilkinson) is a priest being tried for negligent homicide in the death of a young college student Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a parishioner who sought his help feeling she was possessed by demons.  The archdiocese hires pragmatic, agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney in another superlative role) to defend Father Moore.  The prosecuting attorney is strongly religious Methodist Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott in an atypical role well realized).  The film is basically a courtroom drama: the polar sides being scientific (medical) facts versus spiritually based possibilities and the writing for both lawyers is bitingly incisive.  Mixed into the testimony and preparation for the trial are flashbacks to the events leading up to Emily's death, including the gradual possession of Emily's body by six demons and her reaction to the possession, and the exorcism performed by Father Moore.  The priest does not fear jail or loss of clerical collar: his only concern is that he be able to tell Emily's shared story, a story that raises more questions in everybody's minds than providing legal results of the trial.Laura Linney is extraordinary as the agnostic hardened lawyer whose very being is shaken by the case which she tries. The nuances of her character are so well conveyed that we come to understand the un-understandable as she sees it.  Likewise Tom Wilkinson and Campbell Scott shine, as do all of the minor characters.  The cinematography of Tom Stern  is among the most artful of the year and the musical score by Christopher Young is intensely atmospheric. This is not yet another in the endless line of horror flicks, though the Para scientific manifestations of demon possession are graphically enacted (not my cup of tea but necessary for the story).  This is a much more important story than that and one that would be helpful in aiding understanding if both agnostics/pragmatists and spiritual people watched and listened carefully.  Highly recommended.

It's an okay put together study of was she/wasn't she possesed melodrama that doesn't fully answer that question, but that's about it.  The suspense in this film is stillborn and the chills are fleeting.  When first released the marketing campaign led the wary viewer to the conclusion that they would be subject to a new fangled 'EXORCISM' movie with a dark and dreary plot regarding a new, fresh take on demonic possesion.  Instead this motion picture is more of a character study for LAURA LINNEY's lawyer character, who strugles with the assumption that her  client (the exorcising priest, TOM WILKINSON) is or isn't witnessing the supernatual.  All of the supernatural events are witnessed in quick flashbacks which were all shown in the previews and aren't too unsettling at that.  I was waiting for some huge plot twist at the end which never came and made the proceedings even more laborious.  Given the subject matter this could've been creepier and better on a whole, instead the viewer is given the kind of movie typical of the SCI-FI channel sans any action or twisted humor.

949952,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B000BTJDG2,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[1, 2]","Looking back into my childhood there were certain films which really scared the living hell out of me. Movies like the Changeling, the Exorcist and even the original House on Haunted Hill gave me the creeps and kept me awake in bed late at night. When you look at those films today they are pretty outdated but still have a place in our hearts. Sadly very few movies today can actually scare me and I know its like that for every long time horror viewer. As we get older we mature as human beings and our childhood fears die out. Thats why as we are older it takes a lot more to even make the hairs on our arms stand up. So we all search for at least one film that will actually hope to scare us like when we were kids. Some people found that in movies like the Ring, the Sixth Sense and heck even White Noise. It all depends on the persons individual tastes and fears.For me personally the thought of dealing with something you know very little about really gets under my skin. Ghosts, demons and just the thought of supernatural forces really gave me the creeps as a kid (still does today). Today I got the chance to check out The Exorcism of Emily Rose. A film which surrounds the court case of Father Moore, a priest who is accused of negligent homicide after a failed exorcism. Moore has been claimed responsible for the death of a 19 year old woman said to be possessed by demons. In a battle between faith vs. science, Father Moore is determined to tell the truth about what happened to Emily Rose.I know how commercials today can fool viewers. In this case what you see in the commercials are in this movie, but there is a lot more to it. There is more to the plot and the story rather than just being about a girl under the control of demons. About 60 percent of the film takes place in a court room and the story of Emily Rose is told in flashbacks from different characters. Most of it is focused on story and the possibility of what really happened. As mentioned before its basically a battle between faith and science. It works really well with this film and I enjoyed almost every scene. The court room scenes are actually pretty entertaining because it keeps you thinking.I was amazed at how this movie gave me the creeps. It goes to show you that you don't need an R rating for a horror/thriller film to be good. This movie has no gore and very little blood, but thats the beauty of it. Its not meant to be that way at all. Instead its main focus is to scare the audience and show just how dangerous supernatural forces can be. I thought it worked very well and it really got to me in parts. The court room scenes and the other flashbacks hype you up for the main exorcism scene which comes later. When it hits it goes out with a bang. The exorcism scenes are really intense. Truthfully my heart was pounding the entire time they showed the main exorcism scene near the middle of the film. Being scared is great and being creeped out is just as fun.I don't know that much about the events which inspired this movie, but after seeing it I'm very curious and most likely will be doing my own research about the true events. Overall I had a pretty good time watching this movie. It gave me the creeps in some parts and it really had me thinking. The story is good and the court room stuff is very interesting to watch. My best advice is seeing this film with an open mind. The commercials never show any of the court room stuff, but it's there and it's the main focus of the film. The scares are also there and it's not like any of the past demonic/possession films we've seen in the past.

After all, what horror movie fan would not be interested in a movie about possession and an exorcism, especially a movie that was supposed to be based (at least in part) on a true story.The ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" succeeds in sparking one's imagination regarding the philosophical debate between whether possession or mental illness is the cause of some of these mysterious types of frightening manifestations and unexplained phenomena that sometimes occur in various individuals.  From this standpoint, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is clearly a success.  From a horror movie's standpoint, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" comes up a bit short.  In all fairness, this movie should not even be classified exclusively as a horror movie notwithstanding the disturbing images in the movie.  These disturbing images, Emily's manifestations of possession or mental illness and the story's message itself are what carry this movie from a horror movie's perspective, but is it enough?  Most experienced horror movie fans would submit that it is not enough.  Does this mean we need more blood and gore in the movie?  Certainly not, but there just is not enough to this movie to sustain any real sense of horror and fear in the audience.  In fact, when compared to Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" and ""Amityville II: The Possession"", ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is about as scary as the Bugs Bunny cartoons relatively speaking.  Of course, comparisons of ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" to Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" are unfortunately inevitable.  However, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" clearly fails to hold up to scrutiny regarding the movie's ability to evoke unadulterated horror in the audience.Obviously, the courtroom scenes are an integral part of this movie, but this clearly takes away from the movie's ability to sustain horror in the audience.  Don't get me wrong as I love a good courtroom drama as much as the next person (as I am an attorney believe it or not), but the courtroom drama in this movie causes the movie to work against itself at least as far as this movie's merits as a horror movie are concerned.Overall, the acting, directing and production values in this movie are pretty good.  The story works fairly well, but the movie is clearly unable to sustain enough horror to satisfy the pure horror movie fan.  From a drama fan's perspective, this movie is great, but it just does not work as well as a horror movie.Perhaps, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" would best be described as a hybrid or quasi Drama-Horror movie.  Still, with that being said, Emily's screaming is not quite enough to instill the viewer with unadulterated horror.  The disturbing images that Emily sees are quite effective, and the one scene where Emily's body is completely contorted is very effective and probably the scariest scene in the movie, but is it enough to satisfy the horror movie fan?  I would argue that it is not.Still, with that being said, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is, all things considered, an effective thought-provoking drama-horror hybrid movie, but if you are expecting a pure horror movie, you will be as disappointed as I was, and you will definitely find parts of this movie dull and boring.  Nevertheless, you could do a lot worse than to watch ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" as it is quite a thought-provoking movie, but just DO NOT compare this movie to the horror movie classic ""The Exorcist"" because if you do, you will be sorely disappointed.  Overall, I would consider ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" to be an average movie...thus the TWO stars rating with my biggest criticism simply being that there was not enough to this movie to make it into a good solid horror movie.",2,"2.35 STARS: Interesting premise, but a bit on the dull side from a horror movie fan's perspective.",1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,3801,"['Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'sounded', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'theaters', 'what', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'movie', 'possession', 'exorcism', 'especially', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'least', 'part', 'true', 'story.The', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'sparking', 'one', 'imagination', 'regarding', 'philosophical', 'debate', 'possession', 'mental', 'illness', 'cause', 'mysterious', 'types', 'frightening', 'manifestations', 'unexplained', 'phenomena', 'sometimes', 'occur', 'various', 'individuals', 'standpoint', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'clearly', 'success', 'horror', 'movie', 'standpoint', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'up', 'bit', 'short', 'fairness', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'classified', 'exclusively', 'horror', 'movie', 'notwithstanding', 'disturbing', 'images', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'images', 'Emily', 'manifestations', 'possession', 'mental', 'illness', 'story', 'message', 'are', 'what', 'carry', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'perspective', 'enough', 'Most', 'experienced', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'would', 'submit', 'not', 'enough', 'mean', 'need', 'more', 'blood', 'gore', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'not', 'there', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'movie', 'sustain', 'real', 'sense', 'horror', 'fear', 'audience', 'fact', 'when', 'compared', 'Friedkin', 'Exorcist', 'Amityville', 'II', 'Possession', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'about', 'as', 'scary', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoons', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'course', 'comparisons', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Friedkin', 'Exorcist', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'inevitable', 'However', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'clearly', 'hold', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'regarding', 'movie', 'ability', 'evoke', 'unadulterated', 'horror', 'audience.Obviously', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'movie', 'clearly', 'away', 'movie', 'ability', 'sustain', 'horror', 'audience', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'good', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'am', 'attorney', 'believe', 'not', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'movie', 'movie', 'work', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'merits', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', 'concerned.Overall', 'acting', 'directing', 'production', 'values', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'fairly', 'well', 'movie', 'clearly', 'unable', 'sustain', 'enough', 'horror', 'satisfy', 'pure', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'drama', 'fan', 'perspective', 'movie', 'great', 'just', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'horror', 'movie.Perhaps', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'hybrid', 'quasi', 'Drama-Horror', 'movie', 'Still', 'being', 'said', 'Emily', 'screaming', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'instill', 'viewer', 'unadulterated', 'horror', 'disturbing', 'Emily', 'sees', 'are', 'quite', 'effective', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Emily', 'body', 'completely', 'contorted', 'very', 'effective', 'probably', 'scariest', 'scene', 'movie', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'would', 'argue', 'not.Still', 'being', 'said', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'things', 'considered', 'effective', 'thought-provoking', 'drama-horror', 'hybrid', 'movie', 'are', 'expecting', 'pure', 'horror', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'disappointed', 'was', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'parts', 'movie', 'dull', 'boring', 'Nevertheless', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'watch', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'quite', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'just', 'DO', 'NOT', 'compare', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'classic', 'Exorcist', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Overall', 'would', 'consider', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'be', 'average', 'movie', 'thus', 'TWO', 'stars', 'rating', 'biggest', 'criticism', 'simply', 'being', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'movie', 'make', 'good', 'solid', 'horror', 'movie']",N/A

As a Catholic I have what I believe in and I believe the movie did a good job showing what Emily Rose went through and the impact it can have on a person's life.  Also I like the ending where they show what happened after the trial and that people go to see the grave of Emily Rose as a holy shine.  Just my personal feelings I believe the Devil tempts the strongest of believers to test us and our convictions.

Sat in the cinema surrounded by people who were looking for the 'Exorcist' is disguise.To see 'Emily', a good home grown and quiet girl possessed and defiled was horrendous. She fought the demons but after a while she could not stop them entering her, she was worn out. It was tragedy, an obscenity, the girl was religious and wholesome - that's what made her the target.At first it started with visions of darkness, flashes of demons in attendance all the time until finally she was mad with weariness and fright.  Her guard down, her soul engulfed.I remembered reading somewhere that it was based on a true story and remembered thinking that it was probably a gimmick, I so wish that wasn't true. I could have welcomed a gimmick.The holy mother Mary visited 'Emily' in a dream and told her she would take her to heaven rather than leave her to suffer, her body malnourished because all the demons would let her eat was splinters and lice, she was dying.  But 'Emily' declined, she wrote a note about the dream in a moment of vividness that showed how selfless her act was, if she could use what was happening to her to prove demons existed , then in kind we as a race would then be forced to believe God existed since we chose really only to believe what we can see.She continued to endure until she died, her priest unable to save her, then stood trail for her murder, the State advising that it was his talk of demons that meant she didn't get the 'real' help she needed.He was released and found guilty in the most token of manners but the film exists to make people aware of what happened.She died to show us that demons exist.Powerful stuff.

This movie is nothing like it is advertised as being.  This movie is a courtroom drama, the stuff in the previews only last for about 1/2 an hour, and is only used to debunk anything supernatural going on in the movie.  The movie itself is not half bad, it's not great either, definatly not one of the best pictures of the year by any means though.  I might have given this a better rating had I known what I was going to see, I like courtroom movies, but I don't like paying $20 to go see something that turns out to be something completely different.  So in closing(and this is a stretch, I know), I ask that no one go out and buy or rent this film, let's tell the studio's that this, what they did is not okay.

While I found it hard to believe the prosecutor was indeed a Christian, he was presenting his side in a courtroom. The insults and snotty asides were believable in the environment. But the default position was not that religion was foolish and stupid, and that alone is a pleasure. Many of the negative reviews here are from people who demand just such a presentation.3) While we had plenty of opportunity for gratuitous nudity, the film makers inadvertently left out all the nude scenes. Quite surprising.4) Lots of small details that worked quite well. Thought went into the look and feel.5) The priest was not a pedophile, a hypocrite, or a liar.6) People of deep faith were not presented as kooks or crackpots (well, not too much....)However, three stars means not bad, but certainly not good either. I wish this film had asked the hard questions about faith and science and belief. With all the talk these days about Hitchens and Dawkins, these are vital and important topics. But no, this film took the easy way out, setting up very thin straw men and knocking them over rather nonchalantly. Is there a possibility of the supernatural? If you believe not (and it is an a priori belief) then all events that seem to be supernatural have a materialistic explanation. We see a lot of that in this film, as doctors describe symptoms as proving this or that diagnosis. But the core adherence to that natural explanation is a belief as faith in God is a belief. If you choose to deny any possibility of an reality outside physical reality, this movie will annoy and disappoint. The horror is hardly good enough to stand on its own. And the believers will seem like dunderheads and crackpots.I cannot speak for what a believing Catholic would think; though I can't imagine they would be upset. However, if you do believe in the supernatural, as I do, but do not share Roman Catholic theology, as I also do, what then? The silly courtroom back and forth will irritate and seem less real than Perry Mason, the oh-so-open-minded defense attorney will exasperate, and the glib explanations of evil by the priest will seem rather tepid. Evil is much bigger than what we see here. It's not about screamy voices or wild actions; it's about how people are consumed by it and act in deference to it.The careful attention to small details made a pretty good film.

949968,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000BTJDG2,Jean E. Pouliot,"[1, 1]","I'm usually wary about movies that trade on the Catholic Church's use of the exorcism ritual. It's a rare moviemaker who will pass up the chance to show compassion for victims or exploring the nature of evil than of exploiting dark supernatural forces for a big box office. TEER promised to take the phenomeenon of demonic possession seriously, but fell into using overworn cliches and plot devices.TEER purports to be based on the story of a young woman who supposedly died in the midst of an exorcism. A young woman goes off to college, and soon starts seeing and hearing scary things. She is found in odd, rigid, almost impossible postures. Her condition is not relieved by medical doctors, so her parents bring in their local parish priest, who attempts to drive out demons that he believes are possessing her. When she dies (this is no spoiler, as it happens in the first minutes of the film) the priest reponsible is charged with reckless homicide.The film is laid out as a combination horror flick and courtroom drama, with flashbacks between legal events of the present with dramatized scenes of the past. Laura Linney, as the agnostic defense counsel Erin Bruner, does a fine job as a straightlaced and hardworking attorney moving up in her legal firm. Jennifer Carpenter  is extraordinary as the possessed girl. She has such incredible control of her facial features that it's hard to tell where she leaves off and the special effects group steps in. Tom Wilkinson as Father Richard Moore is quite convincing as the humble man of God determined to get Emily Rose's story out in court.It seemed at first that Director Scott Derrickson was trying to film an exocism movie that could be read from a naturalistic point of view as well as a supernatural one. If so, he was gradually overwhelmed by the gravitational pull of cinematic conventions that are trotted out when the Devil makes an appearance. There are scary frosty window panes, people whose eyes go black, morphing paintings and frightening nighttime visitations. The victim, portrayed as completely normal and innocent (a farm girl, even!) is suddenly making weird inhuman vocalizations, injuring herself, frightening animals and running around in the rain in her nightgown. Have we seen this before? But is the girl crazy, or possessed? The film destroys the mystery by having various characters tormented in a peculiar, signature manner. Would the real Devil be as transparent about leaving clues as the Riddler in the Batman series? More damning (!) is the way the film cynically twists the true story of Anneliese Michel, upon which the film was supposedly based. Look it up for yourselves.TEER introduces a few unwelcome twists to the genre. That being medicated interferes with exorcism was bothersome from a theological point of view. Either the name of Jesus expels demons or it does not. And the weird ""deus ex machina"" denouement seemed tacked on and unconvincing. If you need to suddenly inject a heavenly visitor into the script to give your film credence, you're in trouble. The courtroom theatrics and the final verdict were also unconvincing. I had a hard time believing such nonsense would be permitted in a US court of law. And instead of telling me that Emily Rose's grave was a pilgrimage spot, couldn''t you show me a few dropping by?This is the rare DVD in which the extras actually dimish the film. Learning that some scenes were shot with a full-scale anatomical model did not impress me. The interview material with director Derrickson was banal and pompous -- I don't believe for an instant that he read 2000 books about demonic possession. The interview with the set designers was interesting, though. The movie has an odd, gray/blue washed out palette that they worked hard to create and maintain.Whether intended to play against the genre or, in spite of some fine performances and a few scary jump scenes, The Exorcism of Emily Rose was just another tired old devil flick.",3,Jumpy court-horror flick that devolves into cliche,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,3969,"[""'m"", 'usually', 'wary', 'movies', 'trade', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'use', 'exorcism', 'ritual', 'rare', 'moviemaker', 'who', 'will', 'pass', 'up', 'chance', 'show', 'compassion', 'victims', 'exploring', 'nature', 'evil', 'exploiting', 'dark', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'TEER', 'promised', 'take', 'phenomeenon', 'demonic', 'possession', 'seriously', 'fell', 'using', 'overworn', 'cliches', 'plot', 'devices.TEER', 'be', 'based', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'supposedly', 'died', 'midst', 'exorcism', 'young', 'woman', 'college', 'soon', 'starts', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'scary', 'things', 'found', 'odd', 'rigid', 'almost', 'impossible', 'postures', 'condition', 'not', 'relieved', 'medical', 'doctors', 'parents', 'bring', 'local', 'parish', 'priest', 'who', 'drive', 'out', 'demons', 'are', 'possessing', 'When', 'spoiler', 'first', 'minutes', 'film', 'priest', 'reponsible', 'charged', 'reckless', 'homicide.The', 'film', 'laid', 'out', 'combination', 'horror', 'flick', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'flashbacks', 'legal', 'events', 'present', 'dramatized', 'scenes', 'past', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'agnostic', 'defense', 'counsel', 'Erin', 'Bruner', 'fine', 'job', 'straightlaced', 'hardworking', 'attorney', 'moving', 'up', 'legal', 'firm', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'extraordinary', 'possessed', 'girl', 'such', 'incredible', 'control', 'facial', 'features', 'hard', 'tell', 'where', 'off', 'special', 'effects', 'group', 'steps', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Father', 'Richard', 'Moore', 'quite', 'convincing', 'humble', 'man', 'God', 'determined', 'get', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'story', 'court.It', 'seemed', 'first', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'was', 'trying', 'film', 'exocism', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'read', 'naturalistic', 'point', 'view', 'as', 'well', 'supernatural', 'one', 'so', 'was', 'gradually', 'overwhelmed', 'gravitational', 'pull', 'cinematic', 'conventions', 'are', 'trotted', 'out', 'when', 'Devil', 'appearance', 'are', 'scary', 'frosty', 'window', 'panes', 'people', 'eyes', 'go', 'black', 'morphing', 'paintings', 'frightening', 'nighttime', 'visitations', 'victim', 'portrayed', 'completely', 'normal', 'innocent', 'farm', 'girl', 'even', 'suddenly', 'making', 'weird', 'inhuman', 'vocalizations', 'injuring', 'frightening', 'animals', 'running', 'around', 'rain', 'nightgown', 'Have', 'seen', 'girl', 'crazy', 'possessed', 'film', 'mystery', 'having', 'various', 'characters', 'tormented', 'peculiar', 'signature', 'manner', 'Would', 'real', 'Devil', 'be', 'transparent', 'leaving', 'clues', 'Riddler', 'Batman', 'series', 'More', 'damning', 'way', 'film', 'cynically', 'true', 'story', 'Anneliese', 'Michel', 'film', 'was', 'supposedly', 'based', 'Look', 'up', 'yourselves.TEER', 'introduces', 'few', 'unwelcome', 'twists', 'genre', 'being', 'medicated', 'interferes', 'exorcism', 'was', 'bothersome', 'theological', 'point', 'view', 'name', 'Jesus', 'expels', 'demons', 'not', 'weird', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'denouement', 'seemed', 'tacked', 'unconvincing', 'need', 'suddenly', 'inject', 'heavenly', 'visitor', 'script', 'give', 'film', 'credence', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'courtroom', 'theatrics', 'final', 'verdict', 'were', 'also', 'unconvincing', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'such', 'nonsense', 'would', 'be', 'permitted', 'US', 'court', 'law', 'instead', 'telling', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'grave', 'was', 'pilgrimage', 'spot', 'couldn', 't', 'show', 'few', 'dropping', 'rare', 'DVD', 'extras', 'actually', 'dimish', 'film', 'Learning', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'full-scale', 'anatomical', 'model', 'did', 'not', 'impress', 'interview', 'material', 'director', 'Derrickson', 'was', 'banal', 'pompous', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'instant', 'read', '2000', 'books', 'demonic', 'possession', 'interview', 'set', 'designers', 'was', 'interesting', 'though', 'movie', 'odd', 'gray/blue', 'washed', 'out', 'palette', 'worked', 'hard', 'create', 'maintain.Whether', 'intended', 'play', 'genre', 'spite', 'fine', 'performances', 'few', 'scary', 'jump', 'scenes', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'was', 'just', 'tired', 'old', 'devil', 'flick']",N/A

Even the slightest noise scares the living hell out of me and my heart rate increases dramatically.That's when I know 'they' are around.So I had to throw the dvd away this morning as I suspected I was probably going to have to even when I bought it.  I can't keep materials like this around.There's some numerology in the movie.When the exorcist asks the deamons what their name is it justs counts from one to six.  This is telling me that the number six is indeed evil as is indicated in the book of Revelation.It's probably better this way.  People should never say the real name of a deamon.The deamons also say they had entered Cain, Judas, and Nero.The deamon said its name is ""the one who dwells within' or something like that.Then they present the story in a court room setting where the prosecution tries to look at everything from a strictly medical, scientific viewpoint (similar to The Exorcist).Another key event was someone who was present during the exorcism starts getting that weird feeling like something is wrong.  I don't want to ruin it but just let me say he doesn't make it.Then there's that mysterious hooded black figure.  Once you see him you're in trouble.

949970,A3SJSNS9LW981O,B000BTJDG2,Jeffrey J. Messenger,"[2, 2]","With all due respect to the reviewer Shashank, this movie was never meant to appeal to the fluffy scarefest audience of recent years... the ""Ringu"" crowd. Ideally, the audience that will find this movie a refreshing change of pace will be those of us over the age of 35 (like Ebert and Roper... WAY over 35).And as for Shashank's ""WMDs in Iraq"" comment.... guess what? If one took a room full of biological agents, and hid them in a region as big as California... it would be near impossible to find this buried supply. One cannot prove they are present, but this doesn't remove all suspicion that they are there.Which leads me to the case concerning  possession and exorcism... the evidence regarding the reality of these things is minimal... albeit greater than most people realize. But keep this slogan in mind... ""THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE is NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE.""If something remains ""unproven""... whether it's current WMDs in Iraq or the actual possession of the girl given the pseudonym ""Emily Rose""... one is NOT compelled to believe in such things. Yes, doubt and skepticism are healthy. Transversely, one cannot definitively DISMISS the reality of such things. They remain UNPROVEN, not DISPROVEN.Also, there are evidences that fall short of ""absolute proof,"" but they are still evidences of value. I have personally heard the recorded voice contortions during the exorcism this movie is based on, and it would be the type of rasp that would hurt a normal throat after five minutes. This seemingly possessed girl would go on and on in this gutteral voice for hours.The movie plunges into actual theology, much as the original ""Exorcist"" novel did decades ago.

949971,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000BTJDG2,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[2, 3]","This frightening and gripping tale is based on a true story of a German student who, in the 1970s, died during an attempted exorcism.  The two German priests who attempted the exorcism were accuded of negligent homicide.  This film is based on the life of a young college student, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter).  Suffering from horrifying hallucinations and bone-rigid seizures, it was believed that Emily was suffering from some sort of psychosis and epilepsy.  However, the family soon places Emily in the care of their parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson).  He has a totally different explanation for Emily's behavior; he believes that she has been possessed by the devil and he plans an exorcism to rid Emily of her demons.However, the exorcism goes terribly awry, and Emily dies during it.  Soon, Father Moore is arrested and accused of negligent homicide.  Scrambling for alternatives, Father Moore's parish hires defense lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) to defend Father Moore.  A up-and-comer in her law firm, she just won a high-profile case before accepting the defense of Father Moore.  One more big victory and she will become a senior partner in her firm.Serving as prosecutor for the trial is Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a church-goer and Sunday School Teacher who believes that religious beliefs are not above the law and intends to prosecute to its fullest extent.  After rejecting a plea deal of reckless endangerment which would have carried a six month jail sentence from the prosecution, the two sides go to trial.The trial is loaded with scientific explanations and religious theories about the cause of Emily's death.  From psychosis and epilepsy to demon possession, many theories are presented by both the prosecution and the defense.  Which side will the jury believe?  Will Father Moore be found guilty or innocent?I found this movie to be extremely exciting to watch.  The trial scenes are riveting, and the cut-away scenes showing Emily fighting her condition are the high points of the movie.  The acting is first-rate.  Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, and especially Jennifer Carpenter as the torn and troubled Emily are all excellent in their roles.  If you remember seeing ""The Exorcist"", this movie will scare you even more.  I highly recommend this movie.  The courtroom drama will draw you in, and the exorcism and possession scenes will keep you glued to the screen throughout.  Watch this true story and see how possession, scientific theory, and exorcism meet head-on in a clash of beliefs.",5,A Chilling Movie Based on a True Story,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2554,"['frightening', 'gripping', 'tale', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'German', 'student', 'who', '1970s', 'died', 'attempted', 'exorcism', 'two', 'German', 'priests', 'who', 'attempted', 'exorcism', 'were', 'accuded', 'negligent', 'homicide', 'film', 'based', 'life', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'Suffering', 'horrifying', 'hallucinations', 'bone-rigid', 'seizures', 'was', 'believed', 'Emily', 'was', 'suffering', 'sort', 'psychosis', 'epilepsy', 'However', 'family', 'soon', 'places', 'Emily', 'care', 'parish', 'priest', 'Father', 'Moore', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'totally', 'different', 'explanation', 'Emily', 'behavior', 'been', 'possessed', 'devil', 'exorcism', 'rid', 'Emily', 'demons.However', 'exorcism', 'terribly', 'awry', 'Emily', 'Soon', 'Father', 'Moore', 'arrested', 'accused', 'negligent', 'homicide', 'Scrambling', 'alternatives', 'Father', 'Moore', 'parish', 'hires', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'Erin', 'Bruner', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'defend', 'Father', 'Moore', 'up-and-comer', 'law', 'firm', 'just', 'won', 'high-profile', 'case', 'accepting', 'defense', 'Father', 'Moore', 'One', 'more', 'big', 'victory', 'will', 'become', 'senior', 'partner', 'firm.Serving', 'prosecutor', 'trial', 'Ethan', 'Thomas', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'church-goer', 'Sunday', 'School', 'Teacher', 'who', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'not', 'law', 'prosecute', 'fullest', 'extent', 'rejecting', 'plea', 'deal', 'reckless', 'endangerment', 'would', 'have', 'carried', 'six', 'month', 'jail', 'sentence', 'prosecution', 'two', 'sides', 'go', 'trial.The', 'trial', 'loaded', 'scientific', 'explanations', 'religious', 'theories', 'cause', 'Emily', 'death', 'psychosis', 'epilepsy', 'demon', 'possession', 'many', 'theories', 'are', 'presented', 'prosecution', 'defense', 'Which', 'side', 'will', 'jury', 'believe', 'Will', 'Father', 'Moore', 'be', 'found', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'extremely', 'exciting', 'watch', 'trial', 'scenes', 'are', 'riveting', 'cut-away', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Emily', 'fighting', 'condition', 'are', 'high', 'points', 'movie', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'especially', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'torn', 'troubled', 'Emily', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Exorcist', 'movie', 'will', 'scare', 'even', 'more', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'will', 'draw', 'exorcism', 'possession', 'scenes', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'screen', 'Watch', 'true', 'story', 'see', 'how', 'possession', 'scientific', 'theory', 'exorcism', 'meet', 'head-on', 'clash', 'beliefs']",N/A

Highly recommended as long as you aren't expecting another Exorcist sequel.In a way, this is a very scary movie, though not in the same way as the Exorcist or a slash film.(It's interesting to notice that different reviewers do not agree on whether the movie favors the scientific interpretation of events or the spiritual interpretation.

949974,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B000BTJDG2,J from NY,"[2, 3]","Only in the postmodern era could a film of such content achieve notoriety as a ""horror film"".  ""Emily Rose"" is more an exercise on the ins and outs of religious faith within the framework of the American legal system than a horror movie, an interesting meditation on how belief in the metaphysical goes over in complicated situations like the tragic one depicted here. Having read about the actual case which really took place in Germany and did not for a second involve the Catholic Church, I thought it was a little distasteful that the director decided to suggest here and there that this might have been a real case of possession.As far as the movie itself goes, though, the meticulous construction and ill-fated plight of Emily Rose (Anneliese Michael) manages to entertain and even get a tad spooky here and there.  Needless to say, this only happens when the fictitious elements are added.  It is above all worth watching as a courtroom drama.  Tom Wilkinson is utterly forgettable as Father Moore and Jennifer Carpenter delivers a fairly convincing performance as Emily Rose in both her ""normal"" state and ""possessed"" state.Laura Linney and Campbell Scott, however, are phenomenal as two lawyers bent on both stealing the spotlight and proving each other wrong.  At times you really can't help but side with the prosecution, though, as Linney is clearly unprepared for the case despite her character's supposed voracious drive for victory.  How you could pull off an even tentative acquittal such as the one Moore receives at the end is beyond me in this particular case, but she manages it.For my part, I was not left with the desire to watch the film again and again.  Although the plotline was elaborate, coherent and gripping, I found the ""exorcism"" scenes ridiculously short and unconvincing.  What you are left with here is not a burning question as to whether Emily was really possessed or just epileptic, but tremendous pity for her psychological and physiological suffering.That said, this is worth watching.

949977,A3N0O8HJTGD1FM,B000BTJDG2,"J. Martin ""Jeff Punk Rock Martin""","[1, 1]","Okay, I'm sorry for the sarcastic headline. I'll get to my point on that later. This is a good movie, actually. It's not a GREAT movie, but considering the mixed reviews it received upon its release, it earns a special place on that 'better-than-you-think-it's-going-to-be' shelf.Now, one reason ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is better than you think it's going to be is that it's not just some schlocky teen horror flick. Instead, this is a smart, thoughtful look at the sometimes rocky relationship between faith and science. On one side sits Father Moore, a Catholic priest, on trial for negligent homicide after a failed exorcism and the death of a young woman. On the other, a prosecutor - himself a religious man - certain that the afflictions suffered by the title character are easily explained by medical science.In the middle, along with the film's defense attorney, sits most of the moviegoing public. We think of ourselves as rational, after all...but not so rational that we don't sympathize with the priest. And to side with Father Moore, we have to at least accept - maybe to some extent, share - his belief that demons exist and that they sometimes take possession of people. Along with the defense attorney (played to just the right pitch by Laura Linney), we're forced to ask ourselves if science can adequately explain the condition of Emily Rose or if maybe - just maybe - hers is a case of genuine demonic possession.To be sure, there are horrific moments in this film. It moves along with a good number of thrills and chills to go along with its courtroom story, but it really isn't a horror movie. Unlike most modern horror flicks, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a film with a philosophical center. At its heart, it's about what ""Exorcist"" director William Friedkin once called `the mystery of faith.' It's the question of why some perfectly intelligent people believe in things they can't see, measure or prove while others don't. Father Moore, after all, is no religious nutjob and is never painted as such. He's a reasonable man and, unlike the prosecutor, he witnessed firsthand the events in the life of Emily Rose that led to her death.It's to director Scott Derrickson's credit that we're not given any easy answers. Sure, Father Moore is the good guy, but Derrickson doesn't merely discount the opinions of doctors who testify that Emily Rose was mentally and physically ill - not demonically possessed. In fact, the director goes so far as to show various of Emily's `episodes' as if they're rooted in different causes: the same event is presented once as demonic attack, once as epileptic seizure. It's a smart move, and one that asks the viewer to think a bit rather than merely suspend disbelief. And it puts us in the same position of the defense attorney - we have some need to believe Father Moore, but we can't merely ignore the testimony of doctors who have examined Emily Rose.If there's one real flaw in this film, it's that the courtroom drama progresses just a bit too much as if it's made for TV (hence the headline). Contrivances designed to move the trial along may play just fine with teens, but not with anyone who's even spent so much as a day on jury duty. (This is not to say that courtroom dramas have to be especially realistic, but this one, in certain moments, seems slapped together with no regard for reality at all.) On the flipside of the coin, the very look of the courtroom itself is mundane, almost dreary. We spend a lot of time in court in this movie, and the filmmakers might have thought to make it look just a little more cinematic.These are small complaints, though. Despite the interpretation put forth in several reviews, this film never tells us, definitively, whether or not Emily Rose is actually possessed...but still doesn't leave us feeling gypped To its credit, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" gives us a little something to think about without having to spoon-feed us the answers to the questions it poses.",4,Law and Order: Special Demon Unit,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,3982,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'sarcastic', 'headline', ""'ll"", 'get', 'point', 'later', 'good', 'movie', 'actually', 'not', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'considering', 'mixed', 'received', 'release', 'special', 'place', ""'better-than-you-think-it's-going-to-be"", 'shelf.Now', 'one', 'reason', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'better', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'schlocky', 'teen', 'horror', 'flick', 'Instead', 'smart', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'sometimes', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'faith', 'science', 'one', 'side', 'Father', 'Moore', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'trial', 'negligent', 'homicide', 'failed', 'exorcism', 'death', 'young', 'woman', 'other', 'prosecutor', 'religious', 'man', 'certain', 'afflictions', 'suffered', 'title', 'character', 'are', 'easily', 'explained', 'medical', 'science.In', 'middle', 'film', 'defense', 'attorney', 'most', 'moviegoing', 'public', 'think', 'ourselves', 'rational', 'not', 'so', 'rational', 'do', ""n't"", 'sympathize', 'priest', 'side', 'Father', 'Moore', 'have', 'least', 'accept', 'maybe', 'extent', 'share', 'belief', 'demons', 'exist', 'sometimes', 'take', 'possession', 'people', 'defense', 'attorney', 'played', 'just', 'right', 'pitch', 'Laura', 'Linney', ""'re"", 'forced', 'ask', 'science', 'can', 'adequately', 'explain', 'condition', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'hers', 'case', 'genuine', 'demonic', 'possession.To', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'horrific', 'moments', 'film', 'along', 'good', 'number', 'thrills', 'chills', 'go', 'along', 'courtroom', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'most', 'modern', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'film', 'philosophical', 'center', 'heart', 'what', 'Exorcist', 'director', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'once', 'called', 'mystery', 'faith', 'question', 'why', 'perfectly', 'intelligent', 'people', 'believe', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'measure', 'prove', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'Father', 'Moore', 'religious', 'nutjob', 'never', 'painted', 'such', 'reasonable', 'man', 'prosecutor', 'witnessed', 'firsthand', 'events', 'life', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'led', 'death.It', 'director', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'credit', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'easy', 'answers', 'Sure', 'Father', 'Moore', 'good', 'guy', 'Derrickson', ""n't"", 'merely', 'discount', 'opinions', 'doctors', 'who', 'testify', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'was', 'mentally', 'physically', 'ill', 'not', 'demonically', 'possessed', 'fact', 'director', 'so', 'far', 'show', 'various', 'Emily', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'rooted', 'different', 'causes', 'same', 'event', 'presented', 'once', 'demonic', 'attack', 'once', 'epileptic', 'seizure', 'smart', 'move', 'one', 'viewer', 'think', 'bit', 'rather', 'merely', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'same', 'position', 'defense', 'attorney', 'have', 'need', 'believe', 'Father', 'Moore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'merely', 'ignore', 'testimony', 'doctors', 'who', 'have', 'examined', 'Emily', 'Rose.If', 'one', 'real', 'flaw', 'film', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'made', 'TV', 'hence', 'headline', 'Contrivances', 'designed', 'move', 'trial', 'along', 'may', 'play', 'just', 'fine', 'teens', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'day', 'jury', 'duty', 'not', 'say', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'have', 'be', 'especially', 'realistic', 'one', 'certain', 'moments', 'slapped', 'together', 'regard', 'reality', 'flipside', 'coin', 'very', 'look', 'courtroom', 'mundane', 'almost', 'dreary', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'court', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'make', 'look', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'cinematic.These', 'are', 'small', 'complaints', 'though', 'interpretation', 'put', 'forth', 'several', 'reviews', 'film', 'never', 'definitively', 'not', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'actually', 'possessed', 'still', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'gypped', 'credit', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'little', 'something', 'think', 'having', 'spoon-feed', 'answers', 'questions']",N/A

Emily wasn't established as a character prior to being possessed so I didn't care what happened to her.  The whole design of the film was stylised in a way that made it feel unreal.  The demonic manifestations were boring & didn't (as in The Exorcist) challenge the beliefs of those involved.  The spooky shadows popping up to scare the other characters didn't add up to anything.  The 'significance' of things happening at 3 a.m. was hokey.  And whenever people thought intruders were in their homes they never did what anyone would do in real life & turn on bright overhead lights to see what's going on or not going on clearly.  Emily, while possessed by (for no particular reason) six demons (including Legion, who I thought was himself many demons: 'My name is Legion, for we are many,' he says in the good book), manages to take time out to write a lachrymose letter to her priest about encountering the Blessed Virgin who says she's going to be a saint.  I don't know why the demons let her do that, but what the hey.  The film also features a hokey 'witness through the windscreen' moment, featuring sugar glass, which I thought went out in the 70s, & was reminiscent of the crummier moments of The (original) Amityville Horror.  Emily jumps out of a window in a trashy 70s fashion while being exorcised.  And surely you simply can't hand over 'total responsibility' for your deranged daughter to your local priest: the parents would have been charged with neglect themselves (at best); & saying 'it's the priest's fault' would be no defence.  The film pretends to be even-handed about the reality of the possession but the visual coding clearly tells us that we're supposed to believe in the supernatural aspect.

I thought it was quite boring, with scares that just didn't come off and acting that wasn't very impressive. I thought, ""Hey, this movie exists to remind us how great 'The Exorcist' was."" Imagine my surprise when, after that first thirty minutes, I was on the edge of my seat, in the grip of a fascinating story.""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" tells the story of a girl (Jennifer Carpenter) who dies after an exorcism performed by Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson). Moore is brought to trial for negligent homicide. The attorney for the prosecution (Campbell Scott) argues that Emily was suffering from epilepsy and psychosis, and that Father Moore was directly responsible for her death. Erin Bruner, the attorney for the defense, elects to argue the unthinkable, that Emily Rose was actually possessed by demons.First of all, the film combines two genres that are massively entertaining, horror and courtroom drama. The heart of the movie is in the courtroom, and those scenes tingle with suspense. The sequences of Emily's possession and exorcism are told in flashback, and I must admit that the latter is very disturbing. The cinematography is very atmospheric, especially when the film is set on the bleak farm where Emily lives.Second of all, the acting is very superlative. At first, I was wondering if this might be the first bad performance Laura Linney has ever given. Then I realized that she was giving a great one. Erin Bruner, ""a woman of doubt"" who does not believe in demons, is simply not a good lawyer. She gets by on luck and her passion, and she knows that. There are also moments when Linney lets us see the inner fear that haunts Bruner, and its these tony moments that make her great. Campbell Scott is absolutely wonderful as Ethan Thomas, the prosecuting attorney. Scott makes the character so despicably mean-spirited that you hate his guts, but you also know that he is a capable lawyer who really believes in what he's doing. Tom Wilkinson does a very solid job as the accused Father Moore, whose conviction never wavers. And finally, Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose gives a performance of great suffering and double-jointedness. Her possession, or is it epilepsy, is painful to watch, and always totally convincing.""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a gripping and extremely well made thought-provoking film. It combines legal fireworks with supernatural ones, and the mix is unique and completely successful.

The movie leaves little doubt that she was - the question becomes whether the priest's intervention constituted negligence which led to Emily Rose's death.There are theological undertones in the film, good versus evil and he forces of evil at work in the world today.  It is a rebuff to atheists and agnostics alike; to acknowledge the role of the Devil must admit that as a foil there exists a God.

949987,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000BTJDG2,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 4]","With eerie atmosphere that sticks with you throughout its duration, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a compelling and well-drawn tale of horror and courtroom drama.  In it, Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, an aggressive (and agnostic) junior partner at her law firm who jumps at the chance to defend a Catholic priest in a negligent homicide case.  She has a track record of ""getting off"" guilty parties and she also wants to make senior partner.  With a high profile case like this, she'd be a fool to pass it up.  Unfortunately for her, the case isn't as easy to digest.  It involves a young lady's death after a failed exorcism.  The girl, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), had been diagnosed by medical professionals to be both epileptic and psychotic.  However, under the guidance of their parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), the family takes Emily off of her medication and seeks to have her undergo an exorcism in an attempt to remove her demons.The case is very interesting to watch as it plays out on the screen.  Campbell Scott is perfect as the prosecutor attempting to find Father Moore guilty as charged.  He attacks the medical angle of the case while Linney's character, getting hammered in the courthouse, attempts to prove that Emily actually was possessed by some sort of demonic forces.  The deeper that she and Father Moore get involved in the case, the stranger things get.With time split between flashbacks of Emily's agonizing experience and the battle in the courtroom, this tale is woven in such a way that the viewer has little relief from the tension that builds.  The story moves at a pace that builds on fear and faith, making for a brilliant ride.The acting is superb in this film.  Carpenter literally changes from a sweet and innocent young girl into a ravaged carcass under the grip of no less than six demons.  One demon in particular will be quite familiar to all of us.  Wilkinson is believable as the parish priest intent on telling Emily's story with no regard for his own life.  As stated before, Scott handles his role in superior fashion.  Perhaps the character who changes more than any other (excepting Emily) is Laura Linney's.  Though she begins this film as an agnostic, her soul is chipped at by the dark forces she is fighting in the courtroom.With equal parts drama and religious struggle, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is one of the best films to come out this year.  It will make you question your faith, fear the unknown, and, perhaps, even strengthen your own beliefs.

949988,A38NQGQW63IQJJ,B000BTJDG2,Kindle Customer,"[1, 2]","As others have said, this isn't a typical horror movie, and though it is a film in part about demonic possession and in another about the trial that follows the terrible result, it's also about belief, helplessness, sacrifice, fear, and the recognition that we are small and myopic in a universe we barely understand.  In this it reaches further than most horror movies since, perhaps, the original Exorcist.  And this may be why so many react so differently to its story.It's not a slasher pic; it's not filled with gore or scantily-clad teenagers who suffer horribly ridiculous deaths because their hormone-ridden bodies crave sex.  Nor is it obvious: it rarely answers the questions it raises.  Instead, it's an intelligently acted, well-considered, subtle and frightening movie about the collision of what we don't understand with what we think we do.Though I do see how some might want to claim it as propaganda (that science doesn't explain everything, for instance, or that God and the devil might exist despite our best efforts to rationalize them away), and though its courtroom scenes hardly are primers for criminal procedure, still, it seems to me that those who criticize this movie on those grounds are missing the point: not everything we believe about the world particularly makes it so.It is scary, smart, and tense, with terrifically-realized performances by some fine actors, including Tom Wilkinson, who seems to bring heart and depth to every role in which he appears, Laura Linney, who can express even with a slump of her shoulders complexity and depth, and Jennifer Carpenter, the daughter of John Carpenter, who brings vulnerability and terror to what is, in retrospect, a relatively smallish role.I like this picture; it's subtle and scary in the way of some of the best horror movies I've seen, including The Haunting (the original) and The Mothman Prophecies (in which, of course, Linney also was luminous).  Sometimes (often) a character's haunted stare can elicit more fear than the thickest pea soup.  And in this picture there are a lot of those frightened looks.",4,"Scary, tense, and remarkably spiritual",1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2095,"['others', 'have', 'said', ""n't"", 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'film', 'part', 'demonic', 'possession', 'trial', 'terrible', 'result', 'also', 'about', 'belief', 'helplessness', 'sacrifice', 'fear', 'recognition', 'are', 'small', 'myopic', 'universe', 'barely', 'understand', 'further', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'original', 'Exorcist', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'react', 'so', 'differently', 'story.It', 'not', 'slasher', 'pic', 'not', 'filled', 'gore', 'scantily-clad', 'teenagers', 'who', 'suffer', 'horribly', 'ridiculous', 'deaths', 'hormone-ridden', 'bodies', 'crave', 'sex', 'obvious', 'rarely', 'questions', 'Instead', 'intelligently', 'acted', 'well-considered', 'subtle', 'frightening', 'movie', 'collision', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'think', 'do.Though', 'do', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'want', 'claim', 'propaganda', 'science', ""n't"", 'explain', 'everything', 'instance', 'God', 'devil', 'might', 'exist', 'best', 'efforts', 'rationalize', 'away', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'hardly', 'are', 'primers', 'criminal', 'procedure', 'still', 'who', 'criticize', 'movie', 'grounds', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'not', 'everything', 'believe', 'world', 'particularly', 'so.It', 'scary', 'smart', 'tense', 'terrifically-realized', 'performances', 'fine', 'actors', 'including', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'bring', 'heart', 'depth', 'role', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'can', 'express', 'even', 'slump', 'shoulders', 'complexity', 'depth', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'daughter', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'vulnerability', 'terror', 'what', 'retrospect', 'relatively', 'smallish', 'role.I', 'picture', 'subtle', 'scary', 'way', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'including', 'Haunting', 'original', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'course', 'Linney', 'also', 'was', 'luminous', 'Sometimes', 'often', 'character', 'haunted', 'stare', 'can', 'elicit', 'more', 'fear', 'thickest', 'pea', 'soup', 'picture', 'are', 'lot', 'frightened', 'looks']",N/A

949991,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B000BTJDG2,LadyLestat,"[0, 2]","First of all, from reading most of the online reviews, I can tell that most of the viewers missed the point of the entire movie. This movie is not a horror story at all. In fact, it's more of a courtroom drama if you will. The film is centered around a catholic priest named Father Moore played brilliantly by Tom Wilkinson. Father Moore is being prosecuted and standing trial because the exorcism he performed on teenage Emily Rose resulted in her death. This is where medicine versus spirituality begins. This movie was done brilliantly because it's not told from a biased prospective. It doesn't try to persuade you to see it from one prospective or the other because both sides are equally expressed. This movie wanted to be politically correct, and it didn't wanna ruffle any feathers from either side. Meanwhile, showing the viewers both sides of the story from two different points of view. By the end of this movie we still can't be sure what actually happened to Emily Rose. Was it demonic possession? or Was it pychosis? However, I will say this, even the non-believers must admit that some of the prosecutions arguements were too far-fetched. Then again, there's always gonna be the so-called ""realists"" who think that there's a scientific explanation for everything, and then there are ""spiritualist"" who think that there's a higher power that goes beyond medicine. I am on that side because what I saw was clearly demonic possession, but that's just an opinion, and we all know what they're like. I thought the ending was most impressive because I sat in the theatre waiting for a more in depth explanation as to why the demons attacked her in particular, and in the end that question was answered. Father Moore took the stand and read Emily's final letter that she wrote just before she died. I thought it was so interesting that after a failed attempt to drive the demons out. After Emily's body had been starved, beaten, worn, and attacked by a legion of demons she actually got to see the ""Virgin Mary"" Of course, she wants to know why she's suffering this way, and of couse it's because she's a ""saint"" or meant to do God's work. At this time she's given a choice to die and be delivered from all her suffering, or she could stay and be a martyr thus continuing to suffer even more, but the demons still weren't gonna leave her body. At this point, Emily chose to stay, and at that time I thought it was very foolish. However, in hindsight I see it was a very courageous thing to endure. Emily chose to suffer so that her story could be told to the world. So that everyone would know that demons do exist. That was Father Moore's sole purpose to make sure Emily's message got delivered. On the other hand, you have the prosecuters expecting us to believe that Emily's behavior is another form of psychosis or epilepsy treatable by proper medication. They're trying their best to get us to believe that the rest were just muscle constrictions and elevated voices. They want us to believe there was nothing ""spiritual"" about this whole ordeal. Emily was not possessed, and she didn't suffer the stigmata because she was a person ordained by God, but she wondered outside in a daze and grabbed some barbed wire thus getting the wounds on both her hands. They want us to believe that she stopped taking her medicine that the doctor prescribed, and that's why she is indeed going crazy. In my opinion, that's ridiculous! They didn't wanna entertain the possibility of demonic possession, but they could entertain the thought of that other crap.",5,AMAZZZING!!!!,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,3557,"['First', 'all', 'reading', 'most', 'online', 'reviews', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'viewers', 'missed', 'point', 'entire', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'horror', 'story', 'fact', 'more', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'will', 'film', 'centered', 'catholic', 'priest', 'named', 'Father', 'Moore', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Father', 'Moore', 'being', 'prosecuted', 'standing', 'trial', 'exorcism', 'performed', 'teenage', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'resulted', 'death', 'where', 'medicine', 'versus', 'spirituality', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'not', 'told', 'biased', 'prospective', ""n't"", 'try', 'persuade', 'see', 'one', 'prospective', 'other', 'sides', 'are', 'equally', 'expressed', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'did', ""n't"", 'wan', 'ruffle', 'feathers', 'side', 'Meanwhile', 'showing', 'viewers', 'sides', 'story', 'two', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'end', 'movie', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Was', 'demonic', 'possession', 'Was', 'pychosis', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'even', 'non-believers', 'must', 'admit', 'prosecutions', 'arguements', 'were', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'Then', 'again', 'always', 'gon', 'be', 'so-called', 'realists', 'who', 'think', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'everything', 'then', 'are', 'spiritualist', 'who', 'think', 'higher', 'power', 'medicine', 'am', 'side', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'clearly', 'demonic', 'possession', 'just', 'opinion', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'most', 'impressive', 'sat', 'theatre', 'waiting', 'more', 'depth', 'explanation', 'why', 'demons', 'attacked', 'particular', 'end', 'question', 'was', 'answered', 'Father', 'Moore', 'took', 'stand', 'read', 'Emily', 'final', 'letter', 'wrote', 'just', 'died', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'failed', 'attempt', 'drive', 'demons', 'out', 'Emily', 'body', 'had', 'been', 'starved', 'beaten', 'worn', 'attacked', 'legion', 'demons', 'actually', 'got', 'see', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'course', 'know', 'why', 'suffering', 'way', 'couse', 'saint', 'meant', 'do', 'God', 'work', 'time', 'given', 'choice', 'die', 'be', 'delivered', 'suffering', 'could', 'stay', 'be', 'martyr', 'thus', 'continuing', 'suffer', 'even', 'more', 'demons', 'still', 'were', ""n't"", 'gon', 'leave', 'body', 'point', 'Emily', 'chose', 'stay', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'foolish', 'However', 'hindsight', 'see', 'was', 'very', 'courageous', 'thing', 'endure', 'Emily', 'chose', 'suffer', 'so', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'world', 'everyone', 'would', 'know', 'demons', 'do', 'exist', 'was', 'Father', 'Moore', 'sole', 'purpose', 'make', 'sure', 'Emily', 'message', 'got', 'delivered', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'prosecuters', 'expecting', 'believe', 'Emily', 'behavior', 'form', 'psychosis', 'epilepsy', 'treatable', 'proper', 'medication', ""'re"", 'trying', 'best', 'get', 'believe', 'rest', 'were', 'just', 'muscle', 'constrictions', 'elevated', 'voices', 'want', 'believe', 'was', 'nothing', 'spiritual', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'Emily', 'was', 'not', 'possessed', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'stigmata', 'was', 'person', 'ordained', 'God', 'wondered', 'outside', 'daze', 'grabbed', 'barbed', 'wire', 'thus', 'getting', 'wounds', 'hands', 'want', 'believe', 'stopped', 'taking', 'medicine', 'doctor', 'prescribed', 'why', 'indeed', 'going', 'crazy', 'opinion', 'ridiculous', 'did', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'entertain', 'possibility', 'demonic', 'possession', 'could', 'entertain', 'thought', 'other', 'crap']",N/A
949992,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000BTJDG2,Larry VanDeSande,"[4, 7]","""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" effectively mixes courtroom drama and affect from ""The Exorcism"" and other spooky films for a cinematic, or DVD, experience that is enthralling until the very end, when it seems to unwind and turn vanilla.The story traces the actions of a priest that performed an exorcism on the named character and the courtroom drama around his work, which the prosecution suggests led to the girl's death. The courtroom drama  takes up most of the scenes, which are interspersed with reconstructions of Emily's takeover and the exorcism.The film effectively eschews most of the gore, blood and guts that have appeared in many of these movies and is still effective all the way through to the end, where it lets the viewer down by trying to satisfy everyone.Two wonderful actors -- Laura Linney and Campbell Scott -- play the attorneys on each side of the court case in this thriller. Linney, coming off her Oscar-nominated work in ""Kinsey"" is more multidimensional than I can recall seeing her before. Campbell, a terrific supporting actor who has appeared in a lot of movies, takes on an older, more mature, more conservative appearance in the movie playing a God-fearing lawyer than must bebunk a priest whose actions, he believes, led to Emily's demise.The interaction between the two attorneys in the courtroom is what drives the action in the film. There is a subplot of demonic possession that transcends the titled character, a plot contrivance I've never before seen in an exorcism-takeover movie. It adds somethig fresh to the overall horror production.However, an equivocal ending -- apparently based on what happened in real life (the film is said to be based on true events) -- robs the movie of forward motion, bringing everything to an unengaging stop. It gave me the impression that everything leading up to it was less important than I previously thought.Still, this is an effective thriller with riveting performances by the two lawyers and a convincing plot built around real events. There are epilogue scripts onscreen after the flick that tell you what happened to everyone after the court case.This is a good movie, very effective until the end, where I felt like a deflated balloon. Not all viewers will have this feeling, of course.

949993,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BTJDG2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is based on a true story, which would be the exorcism and death of in 1976 of Anneliese Michel, a young German girl.  The ""Klingenberg Case"" unfolded in the wake of the release of William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" and two years later prosecutors brought Anneliese's parents and the two exorcists to trial on charges of negligent homicides. What Scott Derrickson takes from that true story are not so much the details of the young woman's possession and the attempted exorcism, but the drama of a trial in which the state seeks to convict a priest for believing in faith rather than facts.  Consequentially, this 2005 is a rather unique blend of a trial film with a horror movie, and with regards to both parts of the equation it is both provocative and effective.Our vantage point in the story is that of Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), a criminal lawyer who has achieved notoriety for successfully defending a murderer.  The head of her firm (Colm Feore) dangles a partnership in front of her for taking the case of Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), who has been charged with negligent homicide in the death of Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter).  Diagnosed as having epilepsy, the Father convinced Emily that she was a victim of demon possession and got her to stop taking her medication.  An exorcism was performed, but it was unsuccessful, and Emily starved to death.  Prosecuting the case if Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a man of faith who believes in facts.  Bruner is an agnostic, which makes for an obvious irony as she defends the priest whose only concern is that he be allowed to testify and tell Emily's story.  Towards that end he has refused a plea agreement pushed by the archdiocese.Emily's story emerges in flashbacks during the trial, which puts the prosecution's case at a disadvantage from our perspective.  Thomas' alternative explanations for things like how Emily comes to know so many ancient languages ring hollow compared to what we have seen and heard in the flashbacks.  It is key that Thomas is a man of faith, that he is a believer whereas Bruner is not, but when he dismisses Moore's beliefs as archaic superstitions is he merely being a Protestant or is he drawing a line in the theological sand elsewhere?  To the point, does he believe in God but not Satan?  In both but not in possession?  More to the point, when faith and facts collide, why does he obviously side with the latter?  These questions matter to me because by focusing on the trial the story here is about what religious beliefs the law allows.  What is the difference between the religious exemption that allows Native Americans to smoke peyote and allowing  Christian Scientists to refuse medical treatment, and the right of the Catholic Church to perform the ""Ritulae Romanum"" of the Great Exorcism?Emily's position is succinctly put in her own words: ""People say that God is dead, but how can they believe that when I show them the Devil?""  When ""The Exorcist"" came out I remember a poll where more people believed in Satan than in God, which seemed to me to be backwards from the standpoint of logic because Emily is right: the existence of Satan prove that of God, but believing in God does not necessarily mandate a believe in the devil.  Maybe that is where Thomas makes his stand.  But Derrickson has stacked the deck here: those who authorized the exorcism are off the hook, as are the parents, and the earnest Moore faces martyrdom essentially alone.What this film has going for it above anything else is an exceptionally strong cast.  Linney is an actress who exudes intelligence in everything she does, Scott shows measured disdain with just about every sentence he utters, and Wilkinson brings a remarkable sense of reasonableness to a priest in his position.  But special credit goes to Carpenter, who manifests most of Emily's possession through the use of her voice and body (the special features indicate the exceptions in this regard).  The fact that for the most part Linney is in the trial film rather than the horror movie helps her so much that in those few scenes where we are supposed to believe the demons are after her actually work against the movie because it works better if her perspective is no different from that of the jury.In the end I am bothered more by the film's resolution than by its implicit rhetorical questions.  I appreciate the importance of ambiguity in such a film, that for it to really work both Moore and Thomas must be right at face value, but it really is skewed towards the ""truth"" of the possession and having it both ways in the end is too much of a cop out for me.

Thus, we witnessed an example of the medical community being negligent.She had all the classic symptoms of schizophrenia: Going mad during young adult years, extreme paranoia to the point of starving herself due to terrifying ""visions"" and other hallucinations. The hallucinations-both auditory and visual, are indeed extremely terrifying. Yet the priest got away with ""caring"" for this sick indivdual leading to her death--I do know when an adult takes the responsibility for caring for another-they also take legal responsibilites-yet he got away with feeding this young woman's delusions with exorcisms causing her demise by feeding more into her delusions. This is, to me, no different than showing live snakes to someone going into Delirium tremors! To me this rang some kind of legal system negligence that the Court did not speak for the rights of that deceased sick girl, on her behalf. And what happened to the parents who didn't hopitalized their starving daughter at the very least for nutritional support (the cause of her death was self starvation and multiple self mutiliations.)According to the movie Emily Rose had a ""vision"" of the Mother of God, and she asked why the devils were not cast out. ""It's to prove to the world that God exists by showing the devil"". Does that have a ring of truth to it? Why not, instead, show multiple genuine healings for proof of God--cure cancers, true blindness, diabetes, and other measurable things. This would not only alleviate suffering, but bring people to believe.  Just by her deliusion, you could tell the young woman was just crazy.The priest claims to have seen a ""clocked figure"" every night, yet had NO camera to document this myseterious spectre. Cameras were available in the late 60's. Also no photos were taken during the excorcism to document strange phenomena. Mostly likely because there were none to photograph other than maniac screams and violent outbursts: The ravings of a lunatic.The movie was nothing short of spectacular. To me it showed our medical, legal, and religious communities screwing up as they did not protect the rights of a very sick individual who was not of sound mind and body thus could not--was not able--to make her own decision, and the systems of our medical, legal, and religious communities--pillars of our society--that let her down.To me that was what the movie was all about. I think it was awesome that special effects were not overdone, thus making possession scenes as plausible as possible. Possession in terms of manifestations of mental illness and delusions rather than devils is frightening enough--yes it's true sometimes mentally ill people can have super human strength because they are crazy.I think it's the BEST exorcism movie ever made.",5,"An example of pure medical, legal, and religious negligence",1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,3256,"['supposed', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'hollywood', 'hype', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'medical', 'community', 'did', ""n't"", 'Baker', 'Act', 'woman', 'insane', 'people', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'make', 'legal', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'care', 'not', 'being', 'sound', 'mind', 'restrain', 'due', 'violent', 'self', 'mutilating', 'outbursts', 'put', 'nasogastric', 'tube', 'feeding', 'whilst', 'giving', 'antipsychotic', 'drugs', 'were', 'available', 'last', '60', 'thus', 'controlling', 'behaviour', 'allow', 'therapy', 'commense', 'Thus', 'witnessed', 'example', 'medical', 'community', 'being', 'negligent.She', 'had', 'classic', 'symptoms', 'schizophrenia', 'Going', 'mad', 'young', 'adult', 'years', 'extreme', 'paranoia', 'point', 'starving', 'due', 'terrifying', 'visions', 'other', 'hallucinations', 'hallucinations-both', 'auditory', 'visual', 'are', 'indeed', 'extremely', 'terrifying', 'priest', 'got', 'away', 'caring', 'sick', 'indivdual', 'leading', 'death', 'do', 'know', 'when', 'adult', 'responsibility', 'caring', 'another-they', 'also', 'take', 'legal', 'responsibilites-yet', 'got', 'away', 'feeding', 'young', 'woman', 'delusions', 'exorcisms', 'causing', 'demise', 'feeding', 'more', 'delusions', 'different', 'showing', 'live', 'snakes', 'someone', 'going', 'Delirium', 'tremors', 'kind', 'legal', 'system', 'negligence', 'Court', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'rights', 'deceased', 'sick', 'girl', 'behalf', 'what', 'happened', 'parents', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'hopitalized', 'starving', 'daughter', 'very', 'least', 'nutritional', 'support', 'cause', 'death', 'was', 'self', 'starvation', 'multiple', 'self', 'mutiliations', 'According', 'movie', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'had', 'vision', 'Mother', 'God', 'asked', 'why', 'devils', 'were', 'not', 'cast', 'out', 'prove', 'world', 'God', 'showing', 'devil', 'have', 'ring', 'truth', 'Why', 'not', 'instead', 'show', 'multiple', 'genuine', 'healings', 'proof', 'God', 'cure', 'cancers', 'true', 'blindness', 'other', 'measurable', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'alleviate', 'suffering', 'bring', 'people', 'believe', 'Just', 'deliusion', 'could', 'tell', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'just', 'crazy.The', 'priest', 'claims', 'have', 'seen', 'clocked', 'figure', 'night', 'yet', 'had', 'NO', 'camera', 'document', 'myseterious', 'spectre', 'Cameras', 'were', 'available', 'late', '60', 'Also', 'photos', 'were', 'taken', 'excorcism', 'document', 'strange', 'phenomena', 'Mostly', 'likely', 'were', 'none', 'photograph', 'other', 'maniac', 'screams', 'violent', 'outbursts', 'ravings', 'lunatic.The', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'showed', 'medical', 'legal', 'religious', 'communities', 'screwing', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'protect', 'rights', 'very', 'sick', 'individual', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'sound', 'mind', 'body', 'thus', 'could', 'not', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'systems', 'medical', 'legal', 'religious', 'communities', 'pillars', 'society', 'let', 'down.To', 'was', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'think', 'was', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'overdone', 'thus', 'making', 'possession', 'scenes', 'as', 'plausible', 'possible', 'Possession', 'terms', 'manifestations', 'mental', 'illness', 'delusions', 'rather', 'devils', 'frightening', 'enough', 'yes', 'true', 'sometimes', 'mentally', 'ill', 'people', 'can', 'have', 'super', 'human', 'strength', 'are', 'crazy.I', 'think', 'BEST', 'exorcism', 'movie', 'ever', 'made']",N/A
949995,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000BTJDG2,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 4]","I enjoy a good horror story, and this one is that much better by being inspired by the true story of Anneliese Michel, a German woman who experienced a similar progression of events to those depicted in this movie.  I found the movie to be eerie and chilling, and a great movie to inspire thought about the existence of demons in our modern world.  The movie adroitly avoids determining whether there are demons, leaving each viewer to make their own decision.  Though I have always been skeptical regarding stories of possession, this movie certainly was convincing in its portrayal.Emily Rose starts life rather unremarkably.  She was brought up in a family that was strongly, but not extremely, religious.  She went away to college on a full scholarship, the pride of her family.  After a while, Emily began experiencing hallucinations, and she became convinced that demons possessed her.  A number of physical manifestations of Emily Rose's symptoms were very realistic and frightening.  Eventually Emily Rose requested an exorcism be performed after medical treatment seemed to fail.  Soon after the exorcism was performed, Emily Rose died.The trial of the priest that performed the exorcism is the central plot to this movie.  We see Emily Rose's life through the priest's eyes.  The story builds in terror as Emily's symptoms increase.  When the priest's agnostic attorney experiences bizarre manifestations, I started really getting chills down my spine.  I am unable to provide more details without giving away so much that there will be no need to watch the movie.I have always thought that the best horror movies rely on psychology.  This movie does just that.  The amount of blood is minimal, though some of the images are horrifying.  I was unable to see anything in the movie that I thought deserved more than a PG-13 rating, which makes the unrated version a lot of hype, but what is there enhances the chill factor substantially.Hollywood rarely attempts a movie with this level of sophistication.  When it does, it seems like there are inadequate rewards.  In the case of this movie, I confirm Siskel and Roeper's two thumbs up.  Fans of psychological horror and those who have always believed in demon possession will find this movie sufficiently horrific that they will want to watch this one more than once.",4,A Horror Story Inspired by a True Story,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,2327,"['enjoy', 'good', 'horror', 'story', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'being', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'Anneliese', 'Michel', 'German', 'woman', 'who', 'experienced', 'similar', 'progression', 'events', 'depicted', 'movie', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'eerie', 'chilling', 'great', 'movie', 'inspire', 'thought', 'existence', 'demons', 'modern', 'world', 'movie', 'adroitly', 'determining', 'are', 'demons', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'skeptical', 'regarding', 'stories', 'possession', 'movie', 'certainly', 'was', 'convincing', 'portrayal.Emily', 'Rose', 'life', 'rather', 'unremarkably', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'family', 'was', 'strongly', 'not', 'extremely', 'religious', 'went', 'away', 'college', 'full', 'scholarship', 'pride', 'family', 'while', 'Emily', 'began', 'experiencing', 'hallucinations', 'became', 'convinced', 'demons', 'possessed', 'number', 'physical', 'manifestations', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'symptoms', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'frightening', 'Eventually', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'requested', 'exorcism', 'be', 'performed', 'medical', 'treatment', 'seemed', 'fail', 'Soon', 'exorcism', 'was', 'performed', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'died.The', 'trial', 'priest', 'performed', 'exorcism', 'central', 'plot', 'movie', 'see', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'life', 'priest', 'eyes', 'story', 'builds', 'terror', 'Emily', 'symptoms', 'increase', 'When', 'priest', 'agnostic', 'attorney', 'experiences', 'bizarre', 'manifestations', 'started', 'really', 'getting', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'am', 'unable', 'provide', 'more', 'details', 'giving', 'away', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'need', 'watch', 'movie.I', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'rely', 'psychology', 'movie', 'just', 'amount', 'blood', 'minimal', 'images', 'are', 'horrifying', 'was', 'unable', 'see', 'anything', 'movie', 'thought', 'deserved', 'more', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'unrated', 'version', 'lot', 'hype', 'what', 'chill', 'factor', 'substantially.Hollywood', 'rarely', 'movie', 'level', 'sophistication', 'When', 'are', 'inadequate', 'rewards', 'case', 'movie', 'confirm', 'Siskel', 'Roeper', 'two', 'Fans', 'psychological', 'horror', 'who', 'have', 'always', 'believed', 'demon', 'possession', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'sufficiently', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'once']",N/A

950000,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B000BTJDG2,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[3, 4]","The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is one of those rare modern-day horror films that actually thrills. Unlike most recent entries in the genre, the film does not rely on overdone violence and grotesque images to scare its audience. Instead, it uses story and atmosphere to create hysteria and mounting suspense. The film has a great story to tell, and it tells it well.This is possibly the first horror film ever set mostly in a courtroom. The film chronicles the trial of a Catholic priest (Tom Wilkinson.) He is accused of negligence that resulted in the death of 19-year-old Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), whom he believed was possessed by demonic spirits.A lawyer (Laura Linney) whose star is rising takes the case at the behest of her boss. Unfortunately, he seems more interested in serving the interests of the local Catholic diocese than that of the client, who refuses to take a plea bargain because he wants to tell Emily's story in court and let the jury (and the audience) decide what really happened.The possession and exorcism scenes all take place in flashback while various parties give their testimony. This technique allows the film to portray Emily's suffering a la' Rashomon, but with a significant difference: There is little disagreement about what actually happened to Emily. It is all a question of interpretation.By giving us the facts as seen through the eyes of the various characters, the film is asking the audience to be the jury that decides the case. All of the information that is provided is intentionally left out in the open for the viewers.The exorcism scenes are scary and creepy, but they are not of the pea soup-spewing kind. The film tries to ground itself in the reality believed in by the priest who is on trial for Emily's murder, so the horror is more psychological than grotesque.The courtroom aspect of the film may put off some horror fans, but I think it works extremely well and results in a great deal of tension and suspense, albeit very few, if any, surprises.Structuring the story as a courtroom drama increases the horror because it takes place in a believable context. Whether you think Emily is sick or possessed, what happens to her is almost beyond endurance. Moreover, since the fate of the priest rests on the trial's outcome, it is clear that the horrific events in the story have dramatic consequences. What happens is part of a convincing story, not just a series of gratuitous special effects.If anyone has seen the trailers for the film, they probably thought this was the sort of violent horror film I mentioned earlier. It is far from it. In fact, this is a very well-made thriller that has many suspenseful supernatural moments, and does not go for the cheap scares and predictability many audiences are used to.The trailer is obviously designed to draw in the cheesy horror fans, but there is something more intelligent in this film and most of them will be bored, disappointed, or both.The performances in the film are top-notch, with Wilkinson's turn as the exposed priest is heartbreaking, while Linney and Campbell Scott are fantastic as dueling lawyers. The real standout is Jennifer Carpenter (""White Chicks""), who plays Emily Rose. She has quite a bit of silent screen time and pulls it off well without ""demon"" makeup,"" just contorted faces, uncomfortable postures and nerve-shattering screams. She is creepy, yet vulnerable. She is scary yet innocent. She gave an amazing performance.Although the credits claim that the film is ""based on a true story,"" there seems to be just a bare fragment of truth in its script. Before the end credits, a title card tells us that the priest involved with the story cooperated with an author who wrote the book that served as the basis for the film. Screenwriters Scott Derrickson (who also directed) and Paul Harris Boardman purchased the rights, but neither the book nor the author are credited.The book is in fact ""The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel,"" and the only point of similarity between the actual events and the film is that a young woman dies during an exorcism and that the priest is put on trial for negligent homicide.

950001,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B000BTJDG2,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[4, 9]","Impressive, how a film can fail in so many ways. As a dramatization of the actual story The Exorcism of Emily Rose fails because of the many liberties it takes with the case of Anneliese Michel (no wonder the extra featurettes tell us nothing about it). Had the makers chosen a more objective approach, a great psychodrama might have resulted. But no, they wanted a horror movie. Unfortunately, as a horror film this is slow, unexciting and not in the least bit scary (the fact that the setting is a meteorological freak world of perennial thunderstorms does not change that; nor, for that matter, does the tiresomely overwrought musical score, which avoids not a single staple of the genre). As a courtroom drama The Exorcism of ER is utterly soporific. And as a supposed challenge to your own (dis)beliefs, it is simply too insipid: the workings of the supernatural as depicted here are (as per usual) too childish, silly and inane to leave any impression at all. It is the same tired old collection of scary faces, perambulating objects, clocks that malfunction at a specific time, uncouth noises down the hallway, fleeting shadows, speaking in tongues, contortionism, and lots of screaming (no vomiting or sexual aberrations though - Emily Rose's demons, unlike the one inhabiting Regan Macneil, were apparently decently house-trained). Why anybody would be scared to death of such innocuous events is beyond me, yet here, for some reason, they reduce grown up men to whimpering idiots. I'm sure if Lucifer did exist, we could trust him to opt for something more spectacular than behaving like a toddler in need of a stern nanny (and I'm sure he would be less particular about the time of day, far above handling household objects, and completely uninterested in non-entity small-town girls).Top it all off with acting that never rises above soap opera level, and with a plot full of loose ends and unaswered questions, and you end up with something eminently forgettable. The characters we meet have about as much substance as the demons they fight. Emily's boyfriend Jason waxes lyrical over his love for the girl - it must be motivated by a peculiar brand of masochism, for all we see of their relationship is him trying to disentangle her limbs after she has once again dropped to the floor, shrieking, in some feat of demonic acrobatics.But the main problem is that though this film pretends to want to make you think about the possibility of demonic possession and, as the makers mendaciously maintain in the ""Genesis of"" featurette, therefore eschews clear conclusions, the story has in fact been manipulated in such a way as to hammer it home that the possession was real. The script writers did not have the guts to remain neutral, they took sides. The attorney for the prosecution is the bad guy right from the start; the doctors offering sound psychiatric explanations of the phenomena are depicted as arrogant and narrow-minded twits; and the expert witness for the defense, against whom the prosecution hilariously but quite rightly objects on grounds of ""silliness"", is presented as an exotic fount of wisdom. In the middle of all this the priest who's at the core of the proceedings remains a somewhat oafish presence with all the charisma of a bag of potatoes - his greatest moment comes when during the exorcism he hysterically wards of an attack by the house cat. At least that made me laugh.It is not impossible to make an intelligent film that raises deep questions about matters of fact and belief; it is even possible to do so without gratuitously insulting science and actively promoting superstition and gullibility: watch Contact, and you'll see. The Exorcism of Emily Rose, on the other hand, is a film that is bad in many ways, and in some respects more evil than the supposed demons haunting its heroine.",2,Unscary horror or courtroom coma?

The point of this story runs far deeper than gore and disturbing imagery could conjure.This movie is extremely well produced and performed - and it plays on our fear of possibility.  We've all heard stories of forms of possession and exorcism - never knowing what truly happened in these instances.  This allows the viewer to be drawn into the movie.  The mysterious occurrances portrayed will no doubt stir our suspicions.The courtroom setting utilized brings these unearthly and mysterious elements into the ""real world""; the world where reason is supposed to dictate what is perceived as truth.  This exposes us to the ways in which people react to the telling of such experiences.  We are then left to form our own conclusions, drawing on our beliefs and fears: the belief of what is possible and our fear of those very things actually happening to people.  All of this makes for great entertainment and great reflection.  Expecting a film to disturb and rattle me, I was unprepared for what I was exposed to.The DVD contains 3 featurettes: Genesis of the Story, Casting the Movie and Visual Design.  These lengthy featurettes give great insight into the film's production, from the origins of the desire to create a film based on the real life experiences of Anneliese Michel to the means by which the filmmakers visually created the world of torment Emily Rose suffered.  All elements were carefully chosen in creating the ""look"" of the recalled scenes of Emily's experiences.  Great attention was paid to the color, lighting, sound and dialogue of these scenes - all of which is discussed in the featurette.  There is also a deleted scene included in the special features which wouldn't have done much for the film had it been included.This film did not turn out to be what I had expected, yet it entertained me in a different way and had effects that lasted beyond the viewing of the movie.

The movie is a terrific courtroom drama and a terrifying horror story of demonic possession.  The movie raises the question of the validity of demonic possession, and lets the viewer determine whether or not the possession has occurred.  Based on true events in 1976 Germany, the movie opens with a Catholic priest being charged with negligent homicide in the tragic death of young Emily Rose.  Father Moore had attempted an exorcism on the girl a few days earlier, and her death is blamed on him, as he had suggested she stop taking her medication.  Emily had been diagnosed as epileptic with resultant psychotic tendencies; Father Moore and the girl's family believed Emily to be possessed by demons.  An ambitious agnostic attorney is hired by the Archdiocese to serve as his defense, and a Methodist prosecutor is representing the state.  What truly elevates this distinguished film is its cast.  Laura Linney, one of today's best actresses, gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Erin Bruner, the hot shot defender who finds herself questioning her own beliefs during the course of the trial.  I've always admired Ms. Linney's work even in below average films (e.g. Congo) and she rises to the occasion in this riveting performance.  Equally brilliant is Tom Wilkinson, who plays the tormented priest who wants to tell Emily's story and insists he is not responsible for her death.  Nominated for an Oscar for his performance in IN THE BEDROOM, Wilkinson gives a sincere and intense picture of this good man.  Campbell Scott gives one of his most effective performance as Ethan Thomas, the churchgoing prosecutor who leaves his beliefs outside the courtroom and is determined to see Father Moore convicted.  Jennifer Carpenter is devastating as Emily, a girl tormented by demons and the destruction of her life as she knows it.  Her performance is so real it is disturbing at times to watch what happens to her.  Joshua Close as her boyfriend is also very good in a demanding supporting role.

Other thing is that Derrickson stated that he didnt rip off The Exorcist...some might disagree with him, I on the other hand dont see any of The Exorcist in this....well, the only thing is that it's a young girl, like in The Exorcist but I cant say it's ripping from it.",3,Jennifer Carpenter gives a believable performance...even if it is a movie,1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,1994,"['Father', 'Richard', 'Moore', 'played', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'upcoming', 'Seperate', 'Lives', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'trial', 'supposed', 'murder', '19', 'Year', 'Old', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'played', 'surprisingly', 'believable', 'performance', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'White', 'Chicks', 'Wilkinson', 'Lawyer', 'Erin', 'played', 'always', 'good', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Mystic', 'River', 'p.s', 'told', 'tale', 'what', 'happened', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Wilkinson', 'defending', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'Evan', 'Thomas', 'played', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Rodger', 'Dodger', 'Big', 'Night', 'also', 'good', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'was', 'taking', 'medicine', 'suffering', 'delusions', 'seeing', 'things', 'things', 'made', 'so', 'stuff', 'Wilkinson', 'was', 'possessed', 'demon', 'more', 'demons', 'say', '6', 'including', 'Lucifier', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'doesnt', 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'masterpiece', 'could', 'possibly', 'years', 'spookiest', 'mixed', 'courtroom', 'dramatics', 'movie', 'better', 'then', 'White', 'Noise', 'let', 'say', 'know', 'how', 'bad', 'White', 'Noise', 'was', 'Carpenter', 'real', 'deal', 'here', 'character', '19', 'Years', 'Old', 'seeing', 'suffer', 'even', 'acting', 'screen', 'get', 'chill', 'down', 'back', 'spine', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'witnessing', 'everything', 'happened', 'even', 'part', 'chapel', 'where', 'crying', 'asking', 'boy', 'please', 'say', 'feel', 'want', 'stay', 'comfort', 'threw', 'Also', 'starring', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'City', 'Angels', 'Storm', 'Century', 'Henry', 'Czerny', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Alec', 'Roberts', 'Tv', 'Stargate', 'SGI', '13', 'Ghosts', '2001', 'dont', 'know', 'decide', 'opinion', 'mind', 'felt', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'had', 'falts', 'way', 'Other', 'thing', 'Derrickson', 'stated', 'rip', 'off', 'Exorcist', 'might', 'disagree', 'other', 'hand', 'dont', 'see', 'Exorcist', '.well', 'only', 'thing', 'young', 'girl', 'Exorcist', 'cant', 'say', 'ripping']",N/A
950008,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BTJDG2,mirasreviews,"[6, 7]","Every once in a while a thoughtful horror film comes along, one that creeps the audience out and makes it ponder at the same time. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is one of those films, written by Paul Harris Boardman and director Scott Derrickson, who were inspired by a true story. When a young woman named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) dies of starvation and self-inflicted injuries at her family's Midwestern farm house, the State prosecutes her priest, Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson) for negligent homicide, claiming that his encouragement to abandon medical treatment for epilepsy led to Emily's death. Emily had been suffering from frightening hallucinations, seizures, and violent behavior which she came to blame on demonic possession and believe could only be cured by exorcism. Ambitious agnostic attorney Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) defends Father Moore and the possibility that Emily's affliction may have been spiritual, while the practical, church-going prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) lays the blame for Emily's death squarely on religious superstition that fed her psychosis.""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is part courtroom drama, part horror movie. This turns out to be a good combination, as the courtroom scenes allow Emily's story to be told in flashbacks, which paces the horror evenly throughout the film. And the horror punctuates the courtroom drama so that it never becomes plodding. The first thing that struck me about this film was the quality of the cast. Laura Linney and Campbell Scott in a horror flick? This obviously isn't schlock. Great character actors bring much-needed credibility to this spooky tale of the maybe-supernatural. Campbell Scott's role as the prosecutor, a religious man himself, brings stronger conflict to the courtroom than if it were simply a secular prosecution. Jennifer Carpenter's physicality as Emily Rose is remarkable. She's a sweet, earnest woman who does some very freaky stuff, terrifying herself and everyone else. Carpenter's incredible physical performance allowed the use of visual effects only as subtle enhancement, grounding supernatural events in realism.The second thing that struck me about ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is how good the film looks. Director Scott Derrickson has an impressively cinematic vision. He took great care with framing, colors, and production design. The courtroom scenes are especially captivating, thanks to production designer David Brisbin, who found a middle ground between realistically dreary institutional courtrooms and Frank Lloyd Wright. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" claims to be ""based on a true story"", but ""inspired by"" is probably more accurate. The real case took place in the 1970s in Germany. A devoutly religious woman named Anneliese Michel, who had been epileptic and psychotic for 6 years, died in 1976 of self-imposed starvation after a series of exorcisms. Two clergymen and her parents were brought to trial on charges of negligent homicide. In the real case, it was clearer than in the movie that Miss Michel's problems were medical. But it was also clear that she had exhausted the offerings of the medical community, which was unable to successfully treat her after years of trying.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2005): Bonus features include 1 deleted scene with optional director's commentary, 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In ""Genesis of the Story"" (19 min), writer/producer Paul Harris Boardman and writer/director Scott Derrickson talk about the film's themes and researching cases of demonic possession. The film's cast also discuss their characters. We hear how Derrickson found his actors in ""Casting the Movie"" (12 min), and Jennifer Carpenter talks about her role.  ""Visual Design"" (18 min) includes discussion of Scott Derrickson's visual philosophy for the film, inspired Francis Bacon paintings. He and production designer David Brisbin talk a lot about he color palette. Costume designer Tish Monaghan talks about trying not to give the impression of a particular era. And visual effects supervisor Michael Shelton, of ""Captive Audience"", talks about his team's contributions. There is a good audio commentary by writer/director Scott Derrickson. He discusses the origins of the project and his intentions with the film, providing a scene-by-scene commentary on the actors, characters, visual design, pacing, sets, filming, and some technical details.

950012,A2UD8A6JDZ8L4M,B000BTJDG2,"Mr. Mike ""Sci Fi Guy""","[1, 2]","I had heard mixed reviews about this film but I figured it was worth giving a shot, especially on a winter night with nothing else to do.  So, here goes:Overall, this movie was decent and definitely had its moments of thrills and suspense. The first half of the film is better than the second half and much of this is due to how things eventually unwind. The acting was solid, the pace was just about right, and there wasnt any uneccessary gore or ""cheese"" which did help.  The thing that holds this back is character development and the flashback-style of story-telling which I dont really like that much.Emily Rose seemed like a very good person and a great daughter/girlfriend.  At least I think. I say I ""think"" because they dont really develop her at all and we only get glimpses of what this girl was like. She simply doesnt get much screen-time prior to her posession and this, IMO, hurts our feelings towards her. Obviously they couldn't spend  an hour on this but I needed to know her better before I could really care about what was happening to her. Also, the Priest could have been a little more dramatic at times. He appeared to just read his lines sometimes and wasnt really getting into it as much as I felt he should be. Laura Linneys character had a little backstory but nothing out of the ordinary: Hot shot young lawyer, aggressive, agnostic, etc, etc.Emilys family was also not given enough screen time and they also had a hard time portraying how unsettling this whole ordeal must have been. I needed to see more emotion out of these people, especially in the courtroom..... which brings me to my next issue: Too much courtroom footage and much of it was a little underwhelming.  The flashback style seemed to build a little momentum and then it was back to the dreary, dull courtroom. The timing was off on this several times and I wanted to see more of this exorcism and the details surrounding it.  I would have liked to see this first hand  as opposed to having the lawyers summarize it for me. I would have been able to make my own decisions then as to what really might have happened here. Plus, this movie was suposed to be more of a thriller/horror film and it leaned towards being a courtroom drama with flashbacks to what appeared to be a VERY cool exorcism. Lastly, there were a few ""noises in the night"" moments that didnt really go anywhere for some of the characters and the defenses ""special"" witness has a problem that didnt add to the story at all, IMO.So.... sounds bad so far after all that doesnt it?  Well, it wasnt and I still enjoyed it. The exorcism was pretty well done with some truly disturbing images and scenes. This girl was downright terrified and you could see that. She was seeing things that certainly would have made me nervous and the scene in the barn was pretty dramatic and a little freaky. The questions raised about religion vs medicine are pretty standard fare but it was still interesting to watch. By the end, I was rooting for the Priest on trial, at least mostly.Overall, this movie is worth a watch but I dont think has enough redeeming value to warrant a purchase. Netflix it or Rent it, but thats all I can recommend.",3,"Worth a watch, but could have been sooo much better!",1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,3187,"['had', 'heard', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'film', 'figured', 'was', 'worth', 'giving', 'shot', 'especially', 'winter', 'night', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'So', 'here', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'definitely', 'had', 'moments', 'thrills', 'suspense', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'much', 'due', 'how', 'things', 'eventually', 'unwind', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'pace', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'there', 'wasnt', 'uneccessary', 'gore', 'cheese', 'did', 'help', 'thing', 'back', 'character', 'development', 'flashback-style', 'story-telling', 'dont', 'really', 'much.Emily', 'Rose', 'seemed', 'very', 'good', 'person', 'great', 'daughter/girlfriend', 'least', 'think', 'say', 'think', 'dont', 'really', 'develop', 'only', 'get', 'glimpses', 'what', 'girl', 'was', 'simply', 'doesnt', 'get', 'much', 'screen-time', 'prior', 'posession', 'IMO', 'feelings', 'Obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'spend', 'hour', 'needed', 'know', 'better', 'could', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Also', 'Priest', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'dramatic', 'times', 'appeared', 'just', 'read', 'lines', 'sometimes', 'wasnt', 'really', 'getting', 'as', 'much', 'felt', 'should', 'be', 'Laura', 'Linneys', 'character', 'had', 'little', 'backstory', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'Hot', 'shot', 'young', 'lawyer', 'aggressive', 'agnostic', 'etc', 'etc.Emilys', 'family', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'also', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'portraying', 'how', 'unsettling', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'needed', 'see', 'more', 'emotion', 'people', 'especially', 'courtroom', '..', 'next', 'issue', 'Too', 'much', 'courtroom', 'footage', 'much', 'was', 'little', 'underwhelming', 'flashback', 'style', 'seemed', 'build', 'little', 'momentum', 'then', 'was', 'back', 'dreary', 'dull', 'courtroom', 'timing', 'was', 'off', 'several', 'times', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'exorcism', 'details', 'surrounding', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'first', 'hand', 'opposed', 'having', 'lawyers', 'summarize', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'then', 'what', 'really', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'here', 'movie', 'was', 'suposed', 'be', 'more', 'thriller/horror', 'film', 'leaned', 'towards', 'being', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'flashbacks', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'VERY', 'cool', 'exorcism', 'Lastly', 'were', 'few', 'noises', 'night', 'moments', 'didnt', 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'characters', 'defenses', 'special', 'witness', 'problem', 'add', 'story', 'IMO.So', 'bad', 'so', 'far', 'Well', 'wasnt', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'exorcism', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'images', 'scenes', 'girl', 'was', 'downright', 'terrified', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'seeing', 'things', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'nervous', 'scene', 'barn', 'was', 'pretty', 'dramatic', 'little', 'freaky', 'questions', 'raised', 'religion', 'vs', 'medicine', 'are', 'pretty', 'standard', 'fare', 'was', 'still', 'interesting', 'watch', 'end', 'was', 'rooting', 'Priest', 'trial', 'least', 'mostly.Overall', 'movie', 'watch', 'dont', 'think', 'enough', 'redeeming', 'value', 'warrant', 'purchase', 'Netflix', 'Rent', 'can', 'recommend']",N/A

950014,AOWQ2SLNTZIJ4,B000BTJDG2,"Mr. Robinson ""theo deo""","[1, 2]","Demonic possession and the questions of it actually occurring have always interested me. I'd see specials on television with various experts weighing in on whether someone was mentally or emotionally disturbed and in need of psychological help and treatment, or if they were indeed subject to possibly malevolent supernatural forces or intentions.Now, such a situation has been effectively dramatized in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" Based loosely on a real incident, the story involves a priest, Father Moore, who performed an exorcism on a young girl possibly possessed, and who has since died, being placed on trial to determine if his actions led to her death, due to her not receiving proper medical attention.Some of what I found effective about the film included how it kept its balance in being a fright film as well as an involving court room drama. The dialogue is believable and never melodramatic, which might have been an easy trap for the film to fall into, considering its mixture of the demon possessed genre, along with the courtroom drama.The moody and grey cinematography with much fog, also lends the film an effectively mysterious and creepily ominous atmosphere. The writing plays with opposites in order to give the characters and story more complexity, and to befuddle audience's expectations.All of the actors are pretty convincing. Laura Linney stars as the defense attorney for the accused Father Moore, and her character is actually an agnostic. Linney effectively takes the audience on her journey from simply viewing her present case as a chance for promotion in her career, to becoming sympathetic to the priest's cause in telling Emily Rose's story. She becomes more open to the possibilities of what Emily and her story could well mean, especially as strange things begin to occur around her.Tom Wilkinson is sincere and courageous as the clergyman on trial, who's not concerned for his own welfare. He simply wants to tell Emily's story and why he feels its important. Campbell Scott is strong as the prosecutor determined to prove that Emily Rose died due to medical negligence on Father Moore's part, and not from any demonic possession. As I mentioned about opposites, what helps make the plot more interesting and complex, is that as Linney's character is agnostic, so Scott's is a devout Methodist, but who is also, as he says, ""a man of fact.""The real acting cudos, however, goes to Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Eschewing much of real heavy make-up effects, the film relies much on Carpenter's acting ability and her contorting of her facial and body muscles to convey Emily's struggle. It's very effectively unnerving to watch her, and Carpenter's performance always keeps one in a state of wondering if she is really mentally unstable and disturbed, or if she actually is suffering from a demonic influence.What I appreciate most about the film is that no easy answers are provided. That ambivalence is exactly what the director, Scott Derricksen, is aiming for as the film encourages audience members to question their own preconceptions about the supernatural; if and how it may influence our own world and daily lives. Lastly, it recalls the days of older horror movies that placed more emphasis on the fear of the unknown for the characters, and less on piling up the body count and simply splattering the screen with blood and organs.While it shares the title and subject matter with that classic T-Rex of demonic possession, ""The Exorcist,"" the film goes in a direction that more nuanced, chillingly ambiguous and thought provoking than some more recent fare in horror movies of late.

And yet there is an interesting twist, because the subject is one based on belief, not on facts.. and it makes for some interesting moral questions.  The movie starts at the tail end of events as the priest is taken into custody.  A young woman, Emily Rose, has died in his care following an exorcism.  Was it neglect on his part keeping her from medical care for a psychotic epilepsy condition, or were his efforts justified and in fact medical intervention nullified the effects of the exorcism?  We are led through the events in flashback throughout the course of the trial, sometimes to eery effect, as the priest refuses to cut a deal and insists on telling Emily's story to a jury.At the centre of the movie is the relationship between Laura Linney's jaded and agnostic defence counsel and her client the priest played by Tom Wilkinson.  The two leads play with conviction, but Jennifer Carpenter's physically demanding role of Emily Rose should not be overlooked.Admirably, the tone is not one of full on shocks and scares - there is a neutrality which gives you space to make your own mind up, and yet allow you to see events as the Father Moore and Emily saw them.

This misleading concept can be blamed on two things: 1) The advertising that was used during the release of this film and 2) The fact that the word ""Exorcism"" will forever be linked to ""The Exorcist"" which was a horror film.  Maybe the ""based on a true story"" plays a factor as well since this phrase is often twisted out of context and used to describe horror movies (The Amityville Horror, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc).  This movie has horrific images but it is far from a horror film, at least in the traditional sense.The story is told in a parallel nature; Emily's story unfolds in a series of flashbacks during the course of the trial for the priest that performed an unsuccessful exorcism, that many believe led to her death.  This is a difficult feat to accomplish, to keep the viewer moving from past to present seamlessly and without being jerked back and forth.  Director Scott Derrickson excels at this task and creates an atmosphere of suspense and dread from start to finish.I am rarely a fan of ""courtroom dramas"" typically finding myself looking at my watch because the film tends to drag on for me.  This was certainly not the case for this film because the interwoven storyline grabs your interest and keeps things moving right along.  The cast is superb.  Laura Linney plays the doubtful ""I'm here to win to get a promotion"" defense attorney that shifts her belief system gradually and almost unnoticed throughout the film.  She continues to deny the things she has heard and seen right up to the end, because she has always done so.  Linney's  understated performance is top-notch and right on the money.  Tom Wilkinson, the accused priest, also turns in a top-rated performance.  His desperation is based not on the desire to be found not guilty, but his need to tell the true story of Emily Rose.  His quiet, defeated manner reflects the way this character would have been affected by this experience and any other means of conveying this would have made the character seem over-the-top and unconvincing.  The rest of the cast, from the prosecuting attorney that is depicted not as the enemy but almost as a defender of faith, the afflicted Emily Rose whose torment drives the film, her family members who seem truly confounded by this experience and the defense attorney's boss, who pushes her to obtain a deal to get rid of this case, all put in believable performances.  The end result is a solid, unsettling and suspenseful film..",4,Horror Fans Beware,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,2578,"['go', 'film', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'thinking', 'horror', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'misleading', 'concept', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'two', 'things', '1', 'advertising', 'was', 'used', 'release', 'film', '2', 'fact', 'word', 'Exorcism', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'linked', 'Exorcist', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'Maybe', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'factor', 'well', 'phrase', 'often', 'twisted', 'context', 'used', 'describe', 'horror', 'movies', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'etc', 'movie', 'horrific', 'images', 'far', 'horror', 'film', 'least', 'traditional', 'sense.The', 'story', 'told', 'parallel', 'nature', 'Emily', 'story', 'unfolds', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'course', 'trial', 'priest', 'performed', 'unsuccessful', 'exorcism', 'many', 'believe', 'led', 'death', 'difficult', 'feat', 'accomplish', 'keep', 'viewer', 'moving', 'past', 'present', 'seamlessly', 'being', 'jerked', 'back', 'forth', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'task', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'dread', 'start', 'finish.I', 'am', 'rarely', 'fan', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'typically', 'finding', 'looking', 'watch', 'film', 'drag', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'case', 'film', 'interwoven', 'storyline', 'grabs', 'interest', 'things', 'moving', 'right', 'along', 'cast', 'superb', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'doubtful', ""'m"", 'here', 'win', 'get', 'promotion', 'defense', 'attorney', 'belief', 'system', 'gradually', 'almost', 'unnoticed', 'film', 'deny', 'things', 'heard', 'seen', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'always', 'done', 'so', 'Linney', 'understated', 'performance', 'top-notch', 'right', 'money', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'accused', 'priest', 'also', 'top-rated', 'performance', 'desperation', 'based', 'not', 'desire', 'be', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'need', 'tell', 'true', 'story', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'quiet', 'defeated', 'manner', 'way', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'affected', 'experience', 'other', 'means', 'conveying', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'character', 'seem', 'over-the-top', 'unconvincing', 'rest', 'cast', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'depicted', 'not', 'enemy', 'almost', 'defender', 'faith', 'afflicted', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'torment', 'film', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'seem', 'truly', 'confounded', 'experience', 'defense', 'attorney', 'boss', 'who', 'obtain', 'deal', 'get', 'rid', 'case', 'put', 'believable', 'performances', 'end', 'result', 'solid', 'unsettling', 'suspenseful', 'film..']",N/A

However if you watch this as a horror movie you will be very very disappointed. The movie is however an excellent drama, well played out with moments that are more on the horror/suspense side of things.The movie focuses not on the ""excorcism of emily rose"" (which is a little confusing since thats the movie's title), but rather the trail that came afterward in the real life events of 1976 the movie is based on. Tom Wilkenson does a masterful job in playing Father Moore, The Rose family parrish priest who tends to emily after modern medicine fails her, and eventually attempts and fails at an excorcism on Emily. Not long after the failed excorcism does Emily die, and Father Moore is sentenced with murder threw neglegence.Assigned to defend Father Moore is a up and coming agnostic attorney played by the always excellent Laura Linney. Basically within twenty minutes or so the movie begins to play out the trail and the strange events around the trail, as Emily's story is told in a series of flashbacks as witnesses take the stand. Jennifer Carpenter portrays Emily and does so quite poignantly, bringing a quiet strength to the character.It is a slow-burner at times, but it is well worth a look.

The court room drama suggests Emily Rose as being mentally ill, with seizures to boot. The Father's side of the story was that she wasn't mentally ill at all but rather her body/soul was taken over by demons (six of them) and the reason why the exorsim failed was because of the medications that the doctors put her on.Intwind with the courtroom drama was the true story of Emily Rose.

This movie avoids that pitfall by distancing itself from the title character and presenting her almost as a 'case study'.  Several subtle philosophical issues run throughout, involving reason and faith, and the effectiveness of psychiatry and psychotropic drugs.Ultimately Linney and Wilkenson are seen as two people using their wits to solve some issues that have universal bearing.  The movie ends by framing a quotation on ""Emily Rose's"" gravestone, ""Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling""... a reference not only to the Bible but to the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.  This is a good summation of the movie's synthesis of both religious and humanistic ideas.Those who watch the movie can not help but ponder the implications the story holds for their own lives.  When a movie provides such food for thought, it certainly must be deemed a success.Also worth seeking out in this genre:  ""The Entity"" with Barbara Hershey, and the Blair-less  ""Exorcist III"" with Brad Dourif.",4,Taut and gripping,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,1413,"['focusing', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'relying', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'avoid', 'more', 'lurid', 'tendencies', 'demonic', 'possession', 'films', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'anchored', 'fine', 'performances', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'canny', 'lawyer', 'plagued', 'self-doubt', 'Tom', 'Wilkenson', 'accused', 'priest', 'original', 'Exorcist', 'movie', 'was', 'ruined', 'nearly', 'exploitive', 'use', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'tawdry', 'shock', 'effects', 'movie', 'pitfall', 'distancing', 'title', 'character', 'presenting', 'almost', ""'case"", 'study', 'Several', 'subtle', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'run', 'involving', 'reason', 'faith', 'effectiveness', 'psychiatry', 'psychotropic', 'drugs.Ultimately', 'Linney', 'Wilkenson', 'are', 'seen', 'two', 'people', 'using', 'wits', 'solve', 'issues', 'have', 'universal', 'bearing', 'movie', 'framing', 'quotation', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'gravestone', 'Work', 'out', 'own', 'salvation', 'fear', 'trembling', 'reference', 'not', 'only', 'Bible', 'philosopher', 'Soren', 'Kierkegaard', 'good', 'summation', 'movie', 'synthesis', 'religious', 'humanistic', 'ideas.Those', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'ponder', 'implications', 'story', 'own', 'lives', 'When', 'movie', 'such', 'food', 'thought', 'certainly', 'must', 'be', 'deemed', 'success.Also', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'genre', 'Entity', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Blair-less', 'Exorcist', 'III', 'Brad', 'Dourif']",N/A

The film re-tells the story in a series of flashbacks as the priest involved stands trial for negligent homicide.EMILY ROSE is a good film, albeit not a great one.  It is scary, but could be scarier; the courtroom is dramatic but could have been more so.  It is well-acted (especially by Tom Wilkinson as the priest).  It also raises the important issue of science versus faith-- the empirical rationalists will all side with the prosecutor, while those who belive in the preternatural will sympathize with the defense.If the film has a failing, it is that it IS a true story.  By being faithful to this, the screen writers and director missed many chances to improve the drama, enhance the plot, etc.  So, if you are going to watch this, you will have to respect the integrity of the crew and not expect 'Exorcist' style pea soup scenes, levitating beds, and priests with dark, tormented secrets of their own.So, if you'd like an interesting film about evil and the intersection of faith and law, this may be for you.

950026,A361HWF14PW1W3,B000BTJDG2,popinjay,"[2, 2]","This film, while dealing with the phenomenon of demonic possession, seems loaded with intrinsic disclaimers that it was not supposed to be another ""The Exorcist."" The film took the angle of a psychiatric explanation versus a supernatural one, but Mr. Director seemed to think that sustained tension would render his film too similar to William Friedkin's and subsequently thought that too much immediacy as a film-making technique was something less than valid. This made the experience all the more disappointing because the ""possession"" sequences really did have promise, until that potential was quashed by a sentiment that seems to whisper ""whoa there cowboy, yer s'posed to be understated!"" Unfortunately for the outcome of this film, its subject matter and undeniable goal of creating frightening scenes means that not only are some comparisons to The Exorcist inevitable, but some are also wholly justified.There is a nightmarish moment when a platonic male-friend spending the night with Emily, out of genuine concern for her well-being, wakes up to find her horribly contorted on the floor, staring at him with blackened eyes. That would be an incredibly rude awakening, and an absolutely horrifying experience whether the cause were mental or not. After a pretty good sustained shot on Emily's face and body, she lets out a sound that can't help but be compared to Regan MacNeil's lion roar (remember when her eyes first roll up in their sockets). It sounds benign, even by natural standards. Perhaps what the director was going for here was slowly increasing demonic behavior, mingled with a little more of that ""careful now"" mentality. Immediately after this scene we're back in the boring courtroom with its government clerks, the tension completely dissipated and not helped along by the pretty but ultimately bland, blonde leading-lawyer-lady. Perhaps we could have cut to the lawyers having a heated argument - or somebody doing anything that might keep up the nervous tension, but the direction is simply not up to Friedkin's caliber. The latter could (and did) make a housekeeper frying bacon seem ominous.Another tell-tale sign of a director unsure of himself came during the scene in which Emily's sister finds her in her room, hunkered down eating spiders and scratching at the wall. Not a bad little scene on paper! Siss quietly freaks out, Emily hisses at her, and Siss calls for Daddy and the priest, who come running soon and realistically enough. But in the meantime, nothing really happens between Emily and Siss [I never had a sister, hence my uncertainty of the spelling of ""Siss."" Forthcoming  flame warriors offended by my opinions, feel free to capitalize on this as grounds for my dismissal.]. Could not Emily have begun to assault her before Dad and priest get there? And would this not have added to the uncertain horror of what Emily -whatever is wrong with her - might be capable of doing?In sum, Emily doesn't frighten much because I don't buy that she's that dangerous to others. The demons are simply too polite, or if you prefer, she's not violently crazy enough for me to feel much of anything but sympathy for the character and her plight. Simultaneously, the director seemed so enamored with the actress' performance (which was pretty good) that he did not push her into more strident sequences or do more imaginative things with her, and he seems to believe it would have killed his film's premise to be too frightening at any given time.Unfortunate, because the film could have been something much better than it was. It was beautifully photographed and most of the acting was good, if hardly leveraged.For those uninitiated into William Peter Blatty's classic novel The Exorcist, it might be of interest to know that his novel (not the film) walked the edge of supernatural vs. medical angles the entire way through, and managed to do it with suspenseful aplomb.",2,An Almost-Good Film Plagued by Demons of Directorial Self-Doubt,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,3909,"['film', 'dealing', 'phenomenon', 'demonic', 'possession', 'loaded', 'intrinsic', 'disclaimers', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'Exorcist', 'film', 'took', 'angle', 'psychiatric', 'explanation', 'supernatural', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Director', 'seemed', 'think', 'sustained', 'tension', 'would', 'render', 'film', 'too', 'similar', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'subsequently', 'thought', 'too', 'much', 'immediacy', 'film-making', 'technique', 'was', 'something', 'less', 'valid', 'made', 'experience', 'more', 'disappointing', 'possession', 'sequences', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'promise', 'potential', 'was', 'quashed', 'sentiment', 'whisper', 'whoa', 'cowboy', 'yer', ""s'posed"", 'be', 'understated', 'Unfortunately', 'outcome', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'undeniable', 'goal', 'creating', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'comparisons', 'Exorcist', 'inevitable', 'are', 'also', 'wholly', 'nightmarish', 'moment', 'when', 'platonic', 'male-friend', 'spending', 'night', 'Emily', 'genuine', 'concern', 'well-being', 'up', 'find', 'horribly', 'contorted', 'floor', 'staring', 'blackened', 'eyes', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'rude', 'awakening', 'absolutely', 'horrifying', 'experience', 'cause', 'were', 'mental', 'not', 'pretty', 'good', 'sustained', 'shot', 'Emily', 'face', 'body', 'out', 'sound', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'compared', 'Regan', 'MacNeil', 'lion', 'roar', 'remember', 'when', 'eyes', 'first', 'roll', 'up', 'sockets', 'benign', 'even', 'natural', 'standards', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'here', 'was', 'slowly', 'increasing', 'demonic', 'behavior', 'mingled', 'little', 'more', 'careful', 'now', 'mentality', 'Immediately', 'scene', ""'re"", 'back', 'boring', 'courtroom', 'government', 'clerks', 'tension', 'completely', 'dissipated', 'not', 'helped', 'pretty', 'ultimately', 'bland', 'blonde', 'leading-lawyer-lady', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'lawyers', 'having', 'heated', 'argument', 'somebody', 'doing', 'anything', 'might', 'keep', 'up', 'nervous', 'tension', 'direction', 'simply', 'not', 'Friedkin', 'caliber', 'latter', 'could', 'did', 'make', 'housekeeper', 'frying', 'bacon', 'seem', 'ominous.Another', 'tell-tale', 'sign', 'director', 'unsure', 'came', 'scene', 'Emily', 'sister', 'room', 'hunkered', 'down', 'eating', 'spiders', 'scratching', 'wall', 'Not', 'bad', 'little', 'scene', 'paper', 'Siss', 'quietly', 'out', 'Emily', 'Siss', 'Daddy', 'priest', 'who', 'come', 'running', 'soon', 'realistically', 'enough', 'meantime', 'nothing', 'really', 'Emily', 'Siss', '[', 'never', 'had', 'sister', 'hence', 'uncertainty', 'spelling', 'Siss', 'Forthcoming', 'flame', 'warriors', 'offended', 'opinions', 'feel', 'free', 'capitalize', 'grounds', 'dismissal.', ']', 'Could', 'not', 'Emily', 'have', 'begun', 'assault', 'Dad', 'priest', 'get', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'added', 'uncertain', 'horror', 'what', 'Emily', '-whatever', 'wrong', 'might', 'be', 'capable', 'doing', 'sum', 'Emily', ""n't"", 'frighten', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'dangerous', 'others', 'demons', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'polite', 'prefer', 'not', 'violently', 'crazy', 'enough', 'feel', 'much', 'anything', 'sympathy', 'character', 'plight', 'Simultaneously', 'director', 'seemed', 'so', 'enamored', 'actress', 'performance', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'push', 'more', 'strident', 'sequences', 'do', 'more', 'imaginative', 'things', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'film', 'premise', 'be', 'too', 'frightening', 'given', 'time.Unfortunate', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'was', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'most', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'hardly', 'leveraged.For', 'uninitiated', 'William', 'Peter', 'Blatty', 'classic', 'novel', 'Exorcist', 'might', 'be', 'interest', 'know', 'novel', 'not', 'film', 'walked', 'edge', 'supernatural', 'vs.', 'medical', 'angles', 'entire', 'way', 'managed', 'do', 'suspenseful', 'aplomb']",N/A

However, upon recently viewing it again about a month ago, I noticed all of its flaws. The performance by Laura Linney is pathetic! She's so much better in a similar role (as an attorney) in ""Primal Fear"". And, the courtroom scenes played out like a tv movie, a Lifetime movie at that. And the dialogue was a joke! Laura Linney's character was reduced to simply saying ""I object"" every other second, with no REAL legal argument behind it, and the Judge would always agree with her.?.! It was so painful for anyone even remotely interested in legal thrillers to have to watch. There was not enough 'exorcism' footage shown to excite anyone, and the greatest scene in the film (in the barn) was way too brief. There were way too many loose ends left dangling, and things like the 3:00 A.M. phenomenon were never explained. Plus, it's never made clear as to whether Emily was really possessed or just an over imaginative anorexic teen whose religious fervor drove her to believe she was possessed. Oh, and the whole ""Mother Mary"" s**t at the end was just crap! Even if she was possessed, she might have had visions of Christ or the Devil, but not the dead Mary! Only Catholics (if you're Catholic, I mean no offense) believe that Mary was a Holy Figure, so that's another reason that scene was SO wrong for this film.

The director/writer explains in the extras, that merging a courtroom drama with a horror film is a brilliant idea.  Well, not really.  An unsuspensful and flat screenplay is saved by stellar performances all around however.This failing, the lack of suspense, is mainly due to no generation of empathy for Emily Rose.  We never really see her as a person, just a gyrating, aramaic spewing invalid.  Why did her boyfriend stick around, or fall for her in the first place?  We dont see it.  What was her relation with the caring priest before she became possessed? Who knows.The Exorcist in contrast, is one of the simplest yet multilayered films of any genre, an essay on the nature of evil.  There is definite reference and homage here to that film.  Several scenes of the farm land of Rose's home, a swarm of bees etc, is meant to show that evil lurks everywhere.Wilkinson's Priest however, really SEES the devil in a black robe wherever he looks.  An early scene shows him reacting to something he sees through the farmhouse window...it is a flash of a black robe entering a barn, seen for 1/3 of a second.

950034,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000BTJDG2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","The Exorcism of Emily Rose (Scott Derrickson, 2005)There are some movies that, when I see them for the first time, simply blow me away. There are some movies that don't really have much of an effect when I'm watching them, but that creep me out later, upon reflection. There are very, very few films that both blow me away and creep me out later for thoroughly different reasons. In fact, I can only think of one-- the original Candyman (which got me when I watched it for the final scene, and kept me awake nights for weeks afterwards because of the Oscar-worthy sound effects editing in the parking garage scene)-- that did it to me before I saw The Exorcism of Emily Rose.This is a ""wow"" movie-- one that, if I were writing reviews for the local paper, would get simply that word as a review. It is a fantastic movie from beginning to end, with its positives far outweighing its negatives. If you ignore the rest of the review, here's all you need to know: see this movie.I heard a pundit, back when it originally came out, refer to this movie as ""Law and Order with demons."" To an extent, that's true; the movie centers not around Emily Rose (White Chicks' Jennifer Carpenter) herself, who is already dead as the film opens, but around Erin Bruner (Laura Linney of The Mothman Prophecies), an attorney for the law firm representing the diocese where the priest in the case, Father Moore (The Full Monty's Tom Wilkinson), attempted to exorcise Emily. Emily's story itself is told in flashbacks as Erin gets more of the story from Moore and others who knew her. (Okay, so maybe it's actually CSI with demons.)As with most horror films of this nature-- though in retrospect, it's hard to call The Exorcism of Emily Rose a horror film-- the real disturbance for the viewer is going to come in the subtle things. The changes in Emily's appearance as the story goes on are obvious, but there are subtleties that really kick the viewer in the teeth. You might not even notice them on a conscious level, but they're the things that make all the difference in making this look real. (The devil is in the details, indeed.) But behind the ""we're out to give you nightmares"" aspect lies excellent filmmaking; the camerawork, script, pacing, etc. are all wonderful. The acting is good, though no one turns in a truly great performance. That said, Linney is far, far, better here than she was in The Mothman Prophecies. Wilkinson, as always, is on his game (though the film's one major failing is that his attempt at a rural American accent is, at times, pathetic to the point of laughability). Colm Feore, as Erin's boss, has a small but wonderful part that makes the most of Feore's innate creepiness. The real pleasure here, though, is Carpenter, who finally gets a solid role with meat in it, and turns out to have quite the appetite.The final straw, of course, is that (unlike The Amityville Horror, whatever Andrew Douglas wants you to believe) The Exorcism of Emily Rose is based on a true story.

Was she just ill, as doctors called it, or was she truly possessed? Which is right this time- science or religion? This movie showed the battle on each side, and both the lawyers in this film were the two opposing sides pretty well, the problem was they cancelled each other out, making good points on each side which were interesting to hear and observe. To make such a decision I would have found hard. Emily Rose could have been ill, and most probably would say after watching this movie she probably was, but everyone knows there is doubt in the back of all of our minds, that goes beyond our logic, that says there are some things that we just do not know for sure, and this story could have very well been one of those things we could not know. We were not there, we could not know what was going on. Yet it is hard to just automatically believe the story as well, and frightening to even consider.The acting was pretty well done in this film, I liked the way they played out the film and the story itself will leave you thinking about the situation even after the film, making it a story you'll never truly forget.The only problem? I found that they could have shown a little more on Emily Rose. I wanted them to show more of her and what was going on with her, just to shine a little more light on her. Most of the movie is set in the courtroom which is fascinating but I wished they had shown a scene or two more of Emily Rose's tragedy, that's the main reason everyone wanted to see the film so a star goes off from that. Yet I really liked the courtroom part of the film, for it showed the very dilemma of the whole story, and it was a hard one. I think...the jury made the right decision. I feel in my heart of hearts they did. That was not an easy decision, and I think they acted with both logic and faith, which indeed was best.",4,Science Vs.

Zwick,"[5, 7]","***1/2""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" approaches its subject matter with a bit more intelligence and thought than we are used to in films of this type.  The movie, in fact, is more of a courtroom drama with supernatural elements than a flat-out horror film in its own right.Based on a true story, the film begins with the death of a 19-year-old girl from what appears to be a botched exorcism.  The priest in charge of the ritual, Father Moore, is arrested and put on trial for negligent homicide.  Erin Bruner, a self-described ""woman of doubt,"" is the attorney hired by the Catholic archdiocese to defend the case.  At first, Bruner is skeptical of Father Moore's story of what happened to the girl, but after she herself begins to experience strange, unexplainable phenomena in her own life, she comes to believe that there just might be a plausible supernatural explanation for the death.Eschewing most of the over-the-top silliness usually associated with demon-possession scenarios, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" prefers, instead, to concentrate on the running battle between science and rationality on one side and religion and faith on the other that has become a commonplace in our more enlightened modern times.  Although the movie clearly sides with the supernatural explanation, it still leaves room for the more skeptical among us to have their say.  The dialogue is generally sharp, insightful and thought provoking and the screenplay treats the spokespersons from both sides of the argument with dignity and respect.Although this film is set in the rural Midwest, the actual ""Emily Rose"" was a German girl named Anneliese Michel who died in 1976 and whose grave in Germany has since become a pilgrimage site for believers convinced that she was indeed possessed by Satan.The real focus of the film, however, is on the lawyer, Bruner, who undergoes a spiritual reassessment as a result of her involvement in the case.  Laura Linney, as always, brings a seriousness and intelligence to her role of a woman who has her entire view of the world and how it works irrevocably shaken up and altered by the experience.Diehard horror film fans may be disappointed by the relatively short shrift given to the possession sequences, which are seen only in flashbacks and, which, despite their commendable restraint, often have the feel of a warmed-over ""Exorcist"" about them (although that is practically inevitable with any movie on this subject at this point, I would imagine).  However, it is as a courtroom drama that the film scores most of its hits, and those of us who have watched with dismay the steady degeneration of the horror movie genre of late are quick to welcome this approach.",3,unconventional horror film,1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,2693,"['***1/2', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'subject', 'matter', 'bit', 'more', 'intelligence', 'thought', 'are', 'used', 'films', 'type', 'movie', 'fact', 'more', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'flat-out', 'horror', 'film', 'own', 'right.Based', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'death', '19-year-old', 'girl', 'what', 'be', 'botched', 'exorcism', 'priest', 'charge', 'ritual', 'Father', 'Moore', 'arrested', 'put', 'trial', 'negligent', 'homicide', 'Erin', 'Bruner', 'self-described', 'woman', 'doubt', 'attorney', 'hired', 'Catholic', 'archdiocese', 'defend', 'case', 'first', 'Bruner', 'skeptical', 'Father', 'Moore', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'girl', 'herself', 'begins', 'experience', 'strange', 'unexplainable', 'phenomena', 'own', 'life', 'believe', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'plausible', 'supernatural', 'explanation', 'death.Eschewing', 'most', 'over-the-top', 'silliness', 'usually', 'associated', 'demon-possession', 'scenarios', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'prefers', 'instead', 'concentrate', 'running', 'battle', 'science', 'rationality', 'one', 'side', 'religion', 'faith', 'other', 'become', 'commonplace', 'more', 'enlightened', 'modern', 'times', 'movie', 'clearly', 'sides', 'supernatural', 'explanation', 'still', 'room', 'more', 'skeptical', 'have', 'say', 'dialogue', 'generally', 'sharp', 'insightful', 'thought', 'provoking', 'screenplay', 'spokespersons', 'sides', 'argument', 'dignity', 'respect.Although', 'film', 'set', 'rural', 'Midwest', 'actual', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'was', 'German', 'girl', 'named', 'Anneliese', 'Michel', 'who', 'died', '1976', 'grave', 'Germany', 'become', 'pilgrimage', 'site', 'believers', 'convinced', 'was', 'indeed', 'possessed', 'Satan.The', 'real', 'focus', 'film', 'however', 'lawyer', 'Bruner', 'who', 'spiritual', 'reassessment', 'result', 'involvement', 'case', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'always', 'seriousness', 'intelligence', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'entire', 'view', 'world', 'how', 'irrevocably', 'shaken', 'up', 'altered', 'experience.Diehard', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'relatively', 'short', 'shrift', 'given', 'possession', 'sequences', 'are', 'seen', 'only', 'flashbacks', 'commendable', 'restraint', 'often', 'have', 'feel', 'warmed-over', 'Exorcist', 'practically', 'inevitable', 'movie', 'subject', 'point', 'would', 'imagine', 'However', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'film', 'most', 'hits', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'dismay', 'steady', 'degeneration', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'late', 'are', 'quick', 'welcome', 'approach']",N/A

I didn't really expect very much from the film though, and was pleasantly surprised when I wound up liking it.Playing devil's advocate though (pardon the pun, I couldn't help it), I think I understand why some people may be a little critical. For me, the movie seemed very schizophrenic; as if it was torn between wanting to be a horror movie or a courtroom drama. This seeming indecision on which direction to take the film is noticeable and it hurts. The change of pace between the legal scenes and the flashbacks is severe.The acting, I felt, was average. Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson were both very good; conversely, Campbell Scott was just awful as the lead prosecutor. So, call it a wash.The story's interesting, even despite the issue I mentioned earlier with the pacing. The production value is good, I felt like all the effects were all pretty well done.

950040,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000BTJDG2,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[0, 0]","""Emily"" gives the impression of being a courtroom thriller based on a true story of exorcism-gone-bad.  In this case, a noble if small-town priest played by Tom Wilkinson (""In the Bedroom"") tries to drive out a mob of nasty Latin-speaking demons from the mortal form of Emily Rose...or so he says once he's charged with negligent homicide following her death.  Laura Linney is the up-and-coming attorney assigned to defend him.  A non-believer herself, Linney's courtroom adversary (a shockingly aged Campbell Scott) is a small-town prosecutor whose devout churchgoing makes him more disposed to hanging the priest than sparing him.  Back-tracking with witnesses, we see the horrific visions suffered by Emily - was she an epilectic/psychotic as proposed by a prosecutor's expert witness (Henry Czerny), or is this ""the real deal""?  Linney's case is the priest, but her actual client is the Church itself, and the archdiocese wants the case settled quickly, with no question of the accused priest testifying.In that vein, ""Emily"" could have been an effective courtroom drama, one exploring the ethical implications of being the attorney for both a Church and one of its cast-out members at the same time, and leaving enough room on the subject of the supernatural so that we could go either way.  However, though making inroads in that direction, ""Emily"" decides to go the Hollywood route - Linney gamely goes after an impassioned defense, and more critically, the film leaves little doubt of where it stands on the authenticity of the supernatural - when Emily sees something, we see it; and when soembody else sees Emily (but presumably not her terrifying visions) we see her visions anyway; The priest has some visions as well, and the script never considers making Wilkinson's character unsympathetic enough to doubt.  Finally, Linney has too many of her own episodes at ""The Witching Hour"" (3 AM, if you must know), which include a locked front door that is nevertheless wide open and a dictaphone that plays by itself.  ""Emily"" is definately a chiller......that manages to work.  Though using a fair amount of CGI and other effects, ""Emily"" remains on top by its use of effective pacing and its resolute intentions to remain first and foremost a movie about people who are in fear rather than fear itself - everybody looks like their scared, and the script gives them adequate reason to, so why shouldn't we.  Ironically, the movie is almost at its scariest when asking us to ocnsider Emily's condition as purely rational - meaning that it's entirely reasonable for her (and us) to be forced into all manner of painful and bone-breaking contortions while her pupils dilate and her mind is full of visions of demons.  ""Exorcist"" was scary enough when we thought it was fiction, but scenes of Emily lying on the floor, her limbs in odd directions, suggest a colder and clinical diagnosis for which there is no salvation or the protective cushion of CGI.  Though no horror film has yet topped ""Exorcist"", ""Emily"" remains a movie about demonic possession that actually grabs you.",4,Effective chiller,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,3081,"['Emily', 'impression', 'being', 'courtroom', 'thriller', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'exorcism-gone-bad', 'case', 'noble', 'small-town', 'priest', 'played', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Bedroom', 'drive', 'out', 'mob', 'nasty', 'Latin-speaking', 'demons', 'mortal', 'form', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'so', 'once', 'charged', 'negligent', 'homicide', 'following', 'death', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'up-and-coming', 'attorney', 'assigned', 'defend', 'non-believer', 'herself', 'Linney', 'courtroom', 'adversary', 'shockingly', 'aged', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'small-town', 'prosecutor', 'churchgoing', 'more', 'disposed', 'hanging', 'priest', 'sparing', 'Back-tracking', 'witnesses', 'see', 'horrific', 'visions', 'suffered', 'Emily', 'was', 'epilectic/psychotic', 'proposed', 'prosecutor', 'expert', 'witness', 'Henry', 'Czerny', 'real', 'deal', 'Linney', 'case', 'priest', 'actual', 'client', 'Church', 'archdiocese', 'case', 'settled', 'quickly', 'question', 'accused', 'priest', 'testifying.In', 'vein', 'Emily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'one', 'exploring', 'ethical', 'implications', 'being', 'attorney', 'Church', 'one', 'cast-out', 'members', 'same', 'time', 'leaving', 'enough', 'room', 'subject', 'supernatural', 'so', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'However', 'making', 'inroads', 'direction', 'Emily', 'decides', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'route', 'Linney', 'gamely', 'impassioned', 'defense', 'more', 'critically', 'film', 'little', 'doubt', 'where', 'authenticity', 'supernatural', 'when', 'Emily', 'something', 'see', 'when', 'soembody', 'else', 'Emily', 'presumably', 'not', 'terrifying', 'visions', 'see', 'visions', 'anyway', 'priest', 'visions', 'well', 'script', 'never', 'considers', 'making', 'Wilkinson', 'character', 'unsympathetic', 'enough', 'doubt', 'Finally', 'Linney', 'too', 'many', 'own', 'episodes', 'Witching', 'Hour', '3', 'AM', 'must', 'know', 'include', 'locked', 'front', 'door', 'nevertheless', 'wide', 'open', 'dictaphone', 'Emily', 'definately', 'chiller', 'work', 'using', 'fair', 'amount', 'CGI', 'other', 'effects', 'Emily', 'top', 'use', 'effective', 'pacing', 'resolute', 'intentions', 'remain', 'first', 'foremost', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fear', 'rather', 'fear', 'everybody', 'scared', 'script', 'adequate', 'reason', 'so', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'Ironically', 'movie', 'almost', 'scariest', 'when', 'asking', 'ocnsider', 'Emily', 'condition', 'purely', 'rational', 'meaning', 'entirely', 'reasonable', 'be', 'forced', 'manner', 'painful', 'bone-breaking', 'contortions', 'pupils', 'dilate', 'mind', 'full', 'visions', 'demons', 'Exorcist', 'was', 'scary', 'enough', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'fiction', 'scenes', 'Emily', 'lying', 'floor', 'limbs', 'odd', 'directions', 'suggest', 'colder', 'clinical', 'diagnosis', 'salvation', 'protective', 'cushion', 'CGI', 'horror', 'film', 'yet', 'topped', 'Exorcist', 'Emily', 'movie', 'demonic', 'possession', 'actually', 'grabs']",N/A
950041,A387BD735MI50R,B000BTJDG2,R. Schultz,"[3, 4]","There are some shots in this film that are stunning, horrifying in a novel way, without any gore or splatter. And the director achieves an eeriness, a tension in little things.The acting is exceptional throughout. All the main characters are played with true intelligence behind their eyes. You can tell there is really someone home there. (In the case of Emily Rose, there may be more than one intelligence behind her eyes.)Campbell Scott, playing the prosecuting attorney, was a special surprise. I had been vaguely aware of him as a character actor in other films, but he comes into his own here. The DVD commentary identifies him as the son of actor George C. Scott. He performs his courtroom scenes with the same intensity his father was known for, but without any over-the-top tone of antagonsim.However, I have several problems with the movie. I would have liked the DVD commentary to elaborate on just how much it is based on real events. But the commentary is silent and disappointing on this point - and so leads me to believe that any connection to a real person or real events must be tenuous at best.But more crucially, I had a problem with the courtroom scenes. The battle lines seem to be falsely drawn. On the one side is the defendent, a priest being prosecuted for treating Emily Rose's condition with an exorcism rather than by referring her for further psychological help. On the other side is a loose consortium of psychologists who contend that is was criminal not to have continued treating Emily Rose for - perhaps schizophrenia, perhaps some manic-depressive disorder.I don't believe this is even remotely the way any actual court case would have aligned. First of all, it seems much likelier that if any criminal charges were brought in such a case, they would have been brought against Emily Rose's parents for failure to get her continued, modern medical care. It would have been a charge similar to one that has been brought against Christian Scientist parents who have insisted that their children be treated only with prayer in instances where those children had some specific, operable medical conditions. That is what should have been at issue here. Did Emily Rose's parents have a right to maintain a strictly religious interpretation of Emily's symptoms? Does the State have a right to compel parents to submit their children to modern medical practice?But even given the movie's premise that is was the priest who would be prosecuted - the only medical people arrayed against him were psychologists/psychoanalysts presenting the vague alternative that Emily had a mental problem. In the DVD commentary, the director does state that he was striving for an unspecified time frame for this movie. He wanted it to look as if it could have taken place anywhere from the 1970's to the present. Certainly though, the action takes place in recent decades. And some more strict medical explanations of Emily's condition would have been available.Oliver Sach's 'Awakenings' discovery would have been known. So the possibility that Emily had contracted some encephalitis sort of illness that led to catatonia, convulsions, and hallucinations could have been entertained. Or, enough might have been known about the genetic nature of Huntington's Disease to suggest that as a possibility for her illness. In Huntington's Disease, the severity of the illness and its time of onset depends upon how many repetitions of a certain sequence of nucleic bases exist in a gene on the victim's Chromosome 4. The more repetitions, the earlier and harder a person is hit with rigidity and hallucinations.I don't say that either an encephalitis germ or a Huntington's gene would have been the answer to Emily's condition. I'm only saying that some such concrete medical explanation for such symptoms would have been advanced in recent decades. The possible explanations for such suffering would not have been limited to vague psychological diagnoses - 'maybe some sort of schizophrenia, maybe some sore of, ah, manic depression.'So by failing to represent the real issues any court action brought in such a case would have revolved around - the whole movie loses credibility.

950044,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B000BTJDG2,Sesho,"[1, 3]","A priest (Tom Wilkinson)is put on trial for contributing to the death of a girl named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter). The prosecutor wants to hang the priest out to dry for the maximum sentence, but a promotion seeking defender (Laura Linney) is hired by the Church to defend him. She's a good lawyer but the Church wants his defense to be as low-key as she can make it to spare itself embarrassment. The state believes that the priest caused the death of Emily by denying her medical treatment and starving the girl to death. The priest denies these charges and instead claims that the girl died as a result of a botched exorcism that he was conducting to throw a demon out of her body! The film alternates between courtroom scenes set in the present and flashbacks to Emily's story.This movie has some big shoes to fill, and you probably already know that I am referring to the original Exorcist from the 1970s, which inch for inch, is probably the most disturbing and terrifying movie ever made. So any other work that takes up the same subject is automatically at a disadvantage. The problem with this movie is that while Emily is the true subject of it, she receives very little characterization. You see her for like 40 seconds leaving her seemingly inbred community for college, and the next thing you know, she's seeing demons and getting assaulted Entity style in her dorm room. And why am I supposed to care about this girl? The writers made a big mistake by not giving her any depth. For all we know, she's always been a psycho, and the devil had nothing to do with it. Another problem with the movie is that it's just not that scary. I mean, really, would the Devil manifest itself on Earth to do cheap parlor tricks, appearing in a black hood, and make people do body contortions? I mean, doesn't he have better things to do? In the end, it seems as though this is a morality tale saying that bad things happen to good people simply ""Because"".

But how can they think that - if I show them the devil?""If you found the movie ""The Exorcist"" scary, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" will chill you to the bone!Students of art (or literature) may find the cinematography an interesting study too. This movie uses a literary technique of utilizing flashbacks to tell a story. Movie viewers who are used to the more common chronological narrative styles may find this uncomfortable at times, but this is one way to highlight key aspects of a literary work.Special features of this DVD include:Director's commentaryDeleted sceneFeaturettes include:- genesis of the story- casting the movie- visual designDon't just watch the movie like an ordinary cinema-goer. Jumping straight into watching the movie without knowing its history may confuse you.First, read the book that tells you of this girl's case:The Exorcism of Anneliese MichelIf you own this DVD, please watch through all the commentaries of this Special Edition DVD first to understand the intentions of the director and producer in the making of this movie. Listen to the director's commentary on what the movie is trying to convey or not convey. The special features of the DVD are a must to understand what the message of the movie is all about.If you're just looking for a quick horror cinema thrill, stay with the usual fiction and cheap tricks produced elsewhere.If you're not asking yourself in-depth questions about the supernatural by the time you finish watching this DVD, you've learnt nothing at all.So, what actually happened to Emily Rose (case of Anneliese Michel)?Who knows and why?It never ceases to amaze me as to how critics who like to see themselves as""learned men and women"" or some so-called ""impartial jury"" (no jury is unbiased) can needlessly speculate, judge, criticize and comment on what has happened to the victim and the priest when they don't even know the situations they were in, and especially when these critics were not physically present in the situation of the victim! Can we make any judgements on the victim or the priest based on any book or any Hollywood movie? Hell, no!Why don't you ask the victim what happened to her? Wait, sorry, she's dead and the public has only secondary and other speculative sources to make judgements on the poor girl and the priest who tried to help her. What actually happened? Who knows?! Authors and movie directors can only give so much in view of the trajectories of their own thoughts on what might have happened.Since this movie is based on a true story (of Anneliese Michel), the challenge for me as a viewer is to ask the perennial question on why God would allow an innocent person to suffer like this so that unbelievers may believe in His saving grace and power? Why not let all the evil men and evil women of today's evil world end up like this? Send the devil to all those unbelievers and people that deserve this sort of suffering.Excerpt from the movie where Emily Rose has a vision of the BlessedVirgin Mary:BVM: ""Emily, Heaven is not blind to your pain.""Emily: ""Why do I suffer like this?""BVM: ""I'm sorry, Emily...You can come with me in peace,free of your bodily formor you can choose to continue this.You will suffer greatly.But through you many will come to seethat the realm of the spirit is real.The choice is yours.""Emily: ""I choose to stay.""The next time BVM calls me, I'll be saying that it is not believers that need convincing. Jesus died for all more than 2000 years ago, till today, 5/6 of the world's population still reject Him. The sufferings of visionaries and believers only get mocked in today's world, how about telling God to generously bestow all these evils on the unbelievers and the world's evil-doers instead? I'm very sure there is no shortage of evil people everywhere that God can't smite in this earthly lifetime. No need to wait till the afterlife to give them surprises.It is very sad to know that the afflicted victim in this case had to die.With God's blessing, may she return to haunt all evil men and evil women of this evil world!In my opinion, this is the greatest movie that boldly displays the suffering of the afflicted victim with such horror that can numb any human mind. The overwhelming terror you see in this rare case reflects reality of some real life exorcisms. If you're a skeptic and have never seen such suffering first-hand in real life, you don't know what you're missing. Ignorance may be bliss, but truth can be terrifying.Father Moore to defense attorney Erin Bruner:""Once you've looked into the Darkness,you will carry it for the rest of your life.I believe you've seen the Darkness."" ......Recommended reading and viewing:Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary AmericansThe Dark Sacrament: True Stories of Modern-Day Demon Possession and ExorcismBeware the NightThe Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine WarrenThe Rite: The Making of a Modern ExorcistThe Devil Called Collect: The Exorcism of Jessica LeekThe Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)The PossessedA Haunting - Seasons 1-4",5,Spine-chilling Horror!

As the former it's reasonably, though not notably, successful, but where this film does score is in its depiction of the torment and fear suffered by the eponymous teenage girl who believes herself possessed by demons. This is a movie that provides shudders through the things glimpsed in the dark rather than those that leap out at you dripping gore. Creeping dread is created with little more than suggestion, and, although the exorcism itself is dealt with more explicitly, this is where the film is at its most effective.However much of this is faithful to the real story (which involved a poor Bavarian girl), and whether you side with the scientific or the spiritual explanation of these tragic events, this still a gripping story that is let down only by poor pacing and structure.

950048,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B000BTJDG2,Shashank Tripathi,"[5, 11]","For a film that twiddles with the horror genre this must be among the more refreshing Hollywood efforts after a throng of half-nosed Japanese remakes. Yet, for all its production histrionics it ultimately sucks, and sucks boulders, because one never relates to it -- which is of course a blessing given the grotesque world it is about -- but I mean relate to it in a way that would make us care about any of its characters and consequently the film itself.Thematically, it straddles between a kooky courtroom drama and a pandering ode to The Ring/Dark Water crowd. Our eponymous Emily Rose has already succumbed to the devil -- literally, we are led to believe -- thanks to a priest who meant to exorcise her. The film is thus split into a legal trial and some flashbacks detailing a somewhat labored version of what may have led to her death/murder.This sets us up for a plush serving of all the standard-issue thrills one expects from such endeavors: a disheveled protagonist clutched by evil spirits, hectic sound bursts, strange eye colorations, sudden 360-degree cranial rotations, leaden-footed testimonies, and that inevitably sweaty closing from the defence attorney.One soon wonders what the ""Based on a True Story"" moniker really accounted for. To the extent that the real life trial may have led to some seminal litigation pitting medicine against theology, it might be true in a WMDs-in-Iraq sort of a way. But there is precious little here to engage true horror fans, with the possible exception of some convincing acting. I have never paid attention to Campbell Scott before but found myself respecting him in this venture.

950049,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B000BTJDG2,S. K. Harrell,"[4, 7]","I had very high expectations of this film because I studied under the school of techniques put forth by the author of the book it was based on--Dr. Felicitas Goodman. She was a shaman, but in my eyes not only a shaman, but one of the last of the forerunners in the western world who was truly schooled in the olde way yet capable of working that path into the frequencies and energy currently available to the planet. She was a rare bird. Apart from her very open and well schooled view on shamanic work, she had the ability to blend the psychological, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual into her work to create amazing outcomes. She excluded nothing. So of course in that light the film had nowhere to go but down.The film is based on her book ""The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel"", and it's fantastic. The book is her translation of the documents and letters surrounding the possession and subsequent death of Annelise Michel. I could elaborate all day on what makes it unique in the field of depossession. Suffice it to say that she stumbled on some findings that if others in the western world had conceived, did not have the confidence to assert them publicly. I had read her other works before this one and already realized her contributions in shamanism, but when I read this book I really felt like I was reading the words of a pioneer in an incredibly misunderstood field of wellbeing.Anneliese was a young German woman from a very closed off town that was deeply religious. No really--deeply religious, which is very significant to her plight. As she became college aged and was faced with moving to the city and having a boyfriend she began to have problems. Thinking they were mental concerns she was treated for epilepsy. She insisted that she was possessed and the medications weren't helping. As she was an adult and could legally decide for herself, she eventually stopped taking the drugs, stopped eating, and died while the exorcism was being carried out. She essentially chose to starve herself to death. Her parents and two priests went to prison short-term for her death.The film butchered her story. It still managed to assert some of the core truths of Goodman's work, but it was all very wrapped in conjecture and voodoo. The film's goal was to blend a horror and courtroom drama and it failed both miserably. It really should have picked one and run with it. It wasn't particularly scary, but there was one scene that lasted a split second that was gruesomely gorgeous. It was absolutely haunting and it really seemed to capture the essence of what Anneliese actually went through. I am going to check out ""Requiem"" when it comes out on DVD, as it's supposed to be more true to her life story. It always irks me that Hollywood has to shake up real cases of experiences with the paranormal, when if they would stick to the real story, it's far more hair raising than any special effect. But we don't want to portray the truth of what's possible. That would be too close to home.",3,Poor Anneliese...,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,3006,"['had', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'studied', 'school', 'techniques', 'put', 'forth', 'author', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'Dr.', 'Felicitas', 'Goodman', 'was', 'shaman', 'eyes', 'not', 'only', 'shaman', 'one', 'last', 'forerunners', 'western', 'world', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'schooled', 'olde', 'way', 'yet', 'capable', 'working', 'path', 'frequencies', 'energy', 'currently', 'available', 'planet', 'was', 'rare', 'bird', 'Apart', 'very', 'open', 'well', 'schooled', 'view', 'shamanic', 'work', 'had', 'ability', 'blend', 'psychological', 'physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'work', 'create', 'amazing', 'outcomes', 'excluded', 'nothing', 'course', 'light', 'film', 'had', 'nowhere', 'go', 'down.The', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Exorcism', 'Anneliese', 'Michel', 'fantastic', 'book', 'translation', 'documents', 'letters', 'surrounding', 'possession', 'subsequent', 'death', 'Annelise', 'Michel', 'could', 'elaborate', 'day', 'what', 'unique', 'field', 'depossession', 'Suffice', 'say', 'stumbled', 'findings', 'others', 'western', 'world', 'had', 'conceived', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'confidence', 'assert', 'publicly', 'had', 'read', 'other', 'works', 'one', 'already', 'realized', 'contributions', 'shamanism', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'reading', 'words', 'pioneer', 'incredibly', 'misunderstood', 'field', 'wellbeing.Anneliese', 'was', 'young', 'German', 'woman', 'very', 'closed', 'off', 'town', 'was', 'deeply', 'religious', 'really', 'deeply', 'religious', 'very', 'significant', 'plight', 'became', 'college', 'aged', 'was', 'faced', 'moving', 'city', 'having', 'boyfriend', 'began', 'have', 'problems', 'Thinking', 'were', 'mental', 'concerns', 'was', 'treated', 'epilepsy', 'insisted', 'was', 'possessed', 'medications', 'were', ""n't"", 'helping', 'was', 'adult', 'could', 'legally', 'decide', 'eventually', 'stopped', 'taking', 'drugs', 'stopped', 'eating', 'died', 'exorcism', 'was', 'being', 'carried', 'out', 'essentially', 'chose', 'starve', 'death', 'parents', 'two', 'priests', 'went', 'prison', 'short-term', 'death.The', 'film', 'butchered', 'story', 'still', 'managed', 'assert', 'core', 'truths', 'Goodman', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'wrapped', 'conjecture', 'voodoo', 'film', 'goal', 'was', 'blend', 'horror', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'failed', 'miserably', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'picked', 'one', 'run', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'scary', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'lasted', 'split', 'second', 'was', 'gruesomely', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'absolutely', 'haunting', 'really', 'seemed', 'capture', 'essence', 'what', 'Anneliese', 'actually', 'went', 'am', 'going', 'check', 'out', 'Requiem', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'always', 'irks', 'Hollywood', 'shake', 'up', 'real', 'cases', 'experiences', 'paranormal', 'when', 'would', 'stick', 'real', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'hair', 'raising', 'special', 'effect', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'portray', 'truth', 'what', 'possible', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'close', 'home']",N/A

It turned out that those other reviewers that I referred to were correct; Emily Rose is a well done, well acted, thought provoking and scary movie told in a sequence of flashbacks from two points of view: those who believe it was demonic possession and those who would discredit and even prosecute the priest responsible for Emily's exorcism and ultimate death.Jennifer Carpenter (Dexter) is Emily and while she never goes completelyRegan, she gets pretty close at times and does a heck of job creeping the viewer out. Yeah, in fact Director Scott Derrickson keeps viewers completely creeped out for the whole film.According to the opening of the movie, Emiliy Rose is ""based on a true story"".  Derrickson uses some clever deception tactics to make you think that the characters and events in Emily Rose actually happened, but in reality the movie is mostly Hollywood imagination that is quite loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel.

O'Blenis,"[77, 95]","In a little under a month (as of this writing) one of the year's best movies, ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"", will be coming out on DVD.  It's coming in two formats - the theatrical edition and the unrated edition, which presents something of a dilemna.  Normally I Always go for the full uncut version of a movie, even if it means waiting a long time, but now in the case of two movies I've seen at the theater this year (this and ""Dark Water"") there are unrated editions coming out of what was perfect the first time around.  My curiosity and my instincts are to go with the extended editions (""Underworld"", ""Dawn Of The Dead"" etc. would Not have been as good with Any of the material in the Unrated Extended Editions absent), but there's a vague fear of 'why tamper with perfection' in this case?  I don't know, maybe I would have felt the same if I'd first seen ""Underworld"" or ""Dawn"" in the edited theatrical versions, although I can't think of anything that could have been cut from either of those movies that wouldn't have diminished their greatness.  Anyway, the theatrical version is what I've seen, so that's the edition I'm reviewing.First of all, if you have any qualms about not seeing this movie because of it true life connections (as opposed to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which despite the hype was only Very loosely based on real events, the basis of the story having already been formulated - according to Tobe Hooper - before he ever heard of the Gein case) I'd urge you to see the movie anyway.  I admit to having had some uneasiness myself, unlike with a series such as ""Amityville"" which was launched with the support of the people actually involved in the real (I suppose I should say supposedly real, although I find the story credible) events.  ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" was based on undeniably real events - whether or not you believe in the possession angle - involving real tragedy, so I did have my doubts.Suffice it to say that the first half hour of the movie annihilated those doubts completely, and not just because of the super quality of the movie.  I can't be specific without risking spoilers, but I'll say that ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" proved to me that not only was it based on events where it was acceptable to make a movie out of it, but advisable.Juxtasposing the horror movie, the courtroom drama, and the 'theological/philosophical/ethical issues' movie as if it were the most natural thing on Earth, ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" tells the tale of an exorcism gone wrong (not a spoiler; that's apparant from the first five minutes) and the ensuing criminal case charging the priest who presided over the exorcism with negligent homicide.  Told, in about equal ratios, in two timeframes - one leading from the aftermath of Emily's death through to the court case and beyond, the other from before Emily's initial possession through to her eventual death - the movie perfectly brings to life a cast of characters that it's impossible not to care deeply about (helped in no small part by the universally brilliant performances).  The battles in and out of the courtroom are heated, but ironically there are no human 'bad guys' in the movie.  The prosecuting attorney believes in his position, actually more strongly than the defending attorney does in hers, at least initially.  The 'bad guy' element is provided by what happened to the Emily Rose character.  In pursuing the route of an actual possession, few movies have ever come close to being so terrifying in their depiction of true, literal Evil.  And yet at the same time there is an abundance of brightness and inspiration in the tale.  Unbelievable suspense and some unforgettably horrifying moments mixed so fluently with the other side of the coin is in itself a great achievement, and ""Exorcism"" hits all the other marks with equal force: outstanding production, incredible visuals, tremendous musical score, superb character interaction, the whole range of everything you could ask for.Truly one of the greatest movies of all time, definately one of 2005's very best.",5,Absolutely Outstanding,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,4082,"['little', 'month', 'writing', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'movies', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'coming', 'two', 'formats', 'theatrical', 'edition', 'unrated', 'edition', 'something', 'dilemna', 'Normally', 'Always', 'go', 'full', 'uncut', 'version', 'movie', 'even', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'case', 'two', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'theater', 'year', 'Dark', 'Water', 'are', 'unrated', 'editions', 'coming', 'what', 'was', 'perfect', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'My', 'curiosity', 'instincts', 'are', 'go', 'extended', 'editions', 'Underworld', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'etc', 'would', 'Not', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'material', 'Unrated', 'Extended', 'Editions', 'absent', 'vague', 'fear', ""'why"", 'tamper', 'perfection', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'same', ""'d"", 'first', 'seen', 'Underworld', 'Dawn', 'edited', 'theatrical', 'versions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'movies', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'diminished', 'greatness', 'Anyway', 'theatrical', 'version', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'edition', ""'m"", 'reviewing.First', 'have', 'qualms', 'not', 'seeing', 'movie', 'true', 'life', 'connections', 'opposed', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'hype', 'was', 'only', 'Very', 'loosely', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'basis', 'story', 'having', 'already', 'been', 'formulated', 'according', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'ever', 'heard', 'Gein', 'case', ""'d"", 'urge', 'see', 'movie', 'anyway', 'admit', 'having', 'had', 'uneasiness', 'series', 'such', 'Amityville', 'was', 'launched', 'support', 'people', 'actually', 'involved', 'real', 'suppose', 'should', 'say', 'supposedly', 'real', 'find', 'story', 'credible', 'events', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'was', 'based', 'undeniably', 'real', 'events', 'not', 'believe', 'possession', 'angle', 'involving', 'real', 'tragedy', 'did', 'have', 'doubts.Suffice', 'say', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'annihilated', 'doubts', 'completely', 'not', 'just', 'super', 'quality', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'specific', 'risking', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'proved', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'based', 'events', 'where', 'was', 'acceptable', 'make', 'movie', 'advisable.Juxtasposing', 'horror', 'movie', 'courtroom', 'drama', ""'theological/philosophical/ethical"", 'issues', 'movie', 'were', 'most', 'natural', 'thing', 'Earth', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'tale', 'exorcism', 'gone', 'wrong', 'not', 'spoiler', 'apparant', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'ensuing', 'criminal', 'case', 'charging', 'priest', 'who', 'presided', 'exorcism', 'negligent', 'homicide', 'Told', 'about', 'equal', 'ratios', 'two', 'timeframes', 'one', 'leading', 'aftermath', 'Emily', 'death', 'court', 'case', 'other', 'Emily', 'initial', 'possession', 'eventual', 'death', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'life', 'cast', 'characters', 'impossible', 'not', 'care', 'deeply', 'helped', 'small', 'part', 'universally', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'battles', 'courtroom', 'are', 'heated', 'ironically', 'are', 'human', 'guys', 'movie', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'position', 'actually', 'more', 'strongly', 'defending', 'attorney', 'hers', 'least', 'initially', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'element', 'provided', 'what', 'happened', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'character', 'pursuing', 'route', 'actual', 'possession', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'so', 'terrifying', 'depiction', 'true', 'literal', 'Evil', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'abundance', 'brightness', 'inspiration', 'tale', 'Unbelievable', 'suspense', 'unforgettably', 'horrifying', 'moments', 'mixed', 'so', 'fluently', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'great', 'achievement', 'Exorcism', 'other', 'marks', 'equal', 'force', 'outstanding', 'production', 'incredible', 'visuals', 'tremendous', 'musical', 'score', 'superb', 'character', 'interaction', 'whole', 'range', 'everything', 'could', 'ask', 'for.Truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'definately', 'one', '2005', 'very', 'best']",N/A

Upon arrival, Emily is seemingly attacked by demonic forces, which leave her on the brink of sanity. After her mysterious death from a botched exorcism, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is put on trail for her demise, leaving exasperated defender Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) at a loss as to how to approach the case. As Erin probes deeper into Emily's alleged supernatural behavior, she begins to feel evil forces are following her, and puts her job and reputation at stake as she moves forward with her controversial defense that Emily was not mentally ill, but possessed by a demon.  The marketing of ""Emily Rose"" shows frightening images of a young girl violently possessed, a sweaty priest battling thunderous malevolent forces, and an inquisitive woman persistently trying to find out who Emily Rose was and what happened to her. To the surpise of the initial theatrical viewing, this is not the film you get with ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose.""  The film is more a courtroom drama that examines the theoretical differences of medicine and the Church, exploring how the belief of God and His work (and the work of the Devil) has diminished and society is outwardly focused on facts, results, and money.  ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is certainly no ""Exorcist"", but the film succeeds because in no shape or form is it even trying to be.In many ways, 'Emily Rose' is different from almost every past horror movie of the genre in the sense that it doesn't make really obvious attempts to frighten its audience. Instead, director/co-screenwriter Scott Derrickson seems content to make us think. There are several questions raised in the film regarding religious beliefs and the public's general perception of them, but these are all handled in an objective and impartial manner.  As for the scare factor, since the filmmakers aren't overly anxious in trying to scare the audience, the film actually is frightening at several points - again, unusual for a horror film. The frightening events regarding Emily Rose's exorcism are all the more frightening as they don't seem horribly staged and predictable. (although the cheesy demonic animation, as shown in the trailer, could have been done far better) It's true that composer Christopher Young seems unable to resist the horror movie clich&eacute; of having horribly over-dramatic music which builds to a climax at the most frightening moment, but for the most part the movie is able to surpass the usual horror clich&eacute;s.It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances, the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating. Laura Linney also shines in the lead, giving a powerful and affecting performance as the attorney of the convicted priest who performed Emily Rose's exorcism. As said priest, Tom Wilkinson also manages to impress, delivering a quietly effective and very human performance. Unfortunately, the characters of Campbell Scott (as the faithful, yet assertive prosecutor) and Colm Feore (Erin Bruner's boss at the firm) were really badly written, coming off as the typical antagonistic figures, and nothing more. Both give satisfying performances, despite their one dimensional characters, especially Feore, who has always been talented at taking terribly written characters, and giving them life and personality nonetheless.  While the film does achieve an excellent feeling of unease and suspense, it ultimately fails to live up to the promise made in being such a unique perspective on religious suspense with a strong cast. While it is indeed a unique film and possesses strong performances, it fizzles out due to a lackluster climax in which the verdict of the case is presented.

950066,AZWMGBRZ3GYG,B000BTJDG2,Thomas Aquinas,"[1, 2]","Perhaps it's unfair to compare ""Emily Rose"" to ""The Exorcist."" One is a horror movie, the other is more court drama. But in another sense, the goal of both movies is the same. The author of ""The Exorcist"" has been quoted as saying that through ""The Exorcist"" he hoped to awaken in people belief in God, through belief in the devil. If, as the Bible says, fear of the Lord represents the beginning of wisdom, then perhaps the fear of the devil represents the beginning of the beginning of wisdom. And, in fact, the agnostic lawyer (in ""Emily Rose"") says as much.So which movie is more successful at achieving its goal? The answer to that question depends on the viewer. To paraphrase an old philosophical principle, one can only receive what he is able to receive. For those who are attracted to the horror genre, ""The Exorcist"" is the obvious choice. ""The Exorcist"" is effective on a gut level and, overall, is a superior movie. That's no slight to ""Emily Rose,"" since I would rank ""The Exorcist"" as one of the ten or twenty most influential movies in American movie history.""Rose"" takes a more cerebral approach to the phenomenon of possession, and is noteworthy for its fair presentation of both sides of the possession argument. While it's fairly obvious where the movie-makers' sympathies lie, the writers employ a Thomistic even-handedness in presenting the most persuasive Rationalist arguments against demonic possession. The movie doesn't duck any difficult arguments, and it doesn't ram its viewpoint down anyone's throat either. So the movie should be accessible to athiests, theists and agnostics alike, and a great starting point for discussion.I give especially high marks to movie-makers for the careful explication of Church teaching, and for the following memorable line. Paraphrasing: ""Some people believe that what we see is all that is. Other people believe that the world around us is guided by supernatural entities. Both beliefs can't be true, but one of them must be true. And both beliefs are chilling.""Yes they are. Yet most of us try to live somewhere in the middle.Revelation 3:15-16""I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!

950067,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B000BTJDG2,titania86,"[1, 3]","* spoilers *Emily Rose is a normal girl from a religious household. She receives a full ride to a university and is nothing but ecstatic. While there, she starts to have terrifying fits of violence, speaking in tongues, and other bizarre behavior. After being prescribed a drug to combat epilepsy, which her doctor believed was her affliction, the fits continued. She and her family decided that medicine failed them and that it was a spiritual sickness, opting for an exorcism rather than conventional treatments. Emily Rose died from starvation and her self inflicted wounds. Father Richard Moore, the exorcist, is on trial for negligent homicide, defended by Erin Bruner, a woman unsure of her beliefs. She has her work cut out for her as Moore wants to share Emily's story and refuses to do anything but argue that the exorcism was necessary and demons possessed her.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a mix of courtroom drama and exorcism horror film. As the trial goes on, Emily's story is filled in piece by piece. Sometimes scenes would be shown with the religious explanation and the again with the science explanation with changes to accommodate the view. This way of showing the story prevents any one side from being seen as more legitimate than the other. At the beginning, the trial was pretty even in the way the story was told, keeping uncertainty intact and presenting each side. Unfortunately, this didn't continue for the entire film. About halfway through, the religious side is presented as more sympathetic and plausible. Erin Bruner, played by Laura Linney, is seen as more appealing than the prosecutor. The prosecutor is more abrasive and lacks respect for Father Moore, his religion, and his entire defense, which I think is completely warranted. Most of the audience holds some sort of religious belief, so most would take offense to his approach. Unfortunately, even though he has more credible witnesses and explanations, the audience will sympathize with Erin because they relate to her. Erin, on the other hand, brings in dubious witnesses such as an anthropologist and psychiatrist with expertise in different culture's spiritual beliefs. Her arguments boil down to pseudoscience and logical fallacies. She also finds herself the victim of cheesy spiritual attacks, making the debate between religion and science completely moot since the film acknowledges demons and their attacks as fact.Emily Rose comes from a conservative and very religious family that live in a rural area. She is nineteen years old and goes to college to advance her life beyond what she would have had if she stayed at home. College is a place of self discovery, experimentation, and, of course, learning. Shortly before the possession starts, she wrote a letter to her doctor (odd) that she met a boy named Jason and went to a dance with him. She didn't want to tell her mother because she disapproved of dances and warned her about boys. Repression of anything resembling sexuality is pretty run of the mill for the devoutly religious, so it isn't a coincidence when her possession starts in Jason's presence. Like most exorcism stories, it boils down to the male religious leaders oppressing and hurting young women because of their burgeoning sexuality. This one is simply more subtle in its delivery because of the faith vs. science debate and added courtroom drama.The ending of the film is particularly infuriating. Father Moore is found guilty, but also goes free. This makes the sentencing completely meaningless. A girl starved to death under his care. It takes a while to starve to death and is completely preventable. I don't understand how anyone could sympathize with this priest when he stood by with plenty of resources available to help her and allowed her to starve to death. He claimed she wouldn't eat, but then you take to a hospital where they have alternate ways of feeding her. Her self inflicted wounds weren't even attempted to be treated even as a doctor stood by. The entire situation is supremely messed up and calls to mind situations where people allow faith to justify horrific acts. The case this is based on is that of Anneliese Michel, who went through 10 months of voluntary exorcisms and eventually died of an eating disorder, weighing 68 pounds. The two priests and her parents were convicted of negligence with the causes being misidentification of a mental disorder, religious hysteria, and abuse. It's disgusting that this film takes a tragic case of abuse, lessens the unpalatable details, and twists it into pro-religious propaganda.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a disappointing film due to the mutilation of the original story and its misogynistic message.

950070,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BTJDG2,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Emily Rose is dead, and the court of law must determine the reason. I know horror film fans would love the film, and some reviewers have found it intelligent, but here I beg to disagree. Yes, the film is not bad, but at the same time I believe somewhere deep inside `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' there is a better film that could have been.The spooky opening scene effectively introduces us to the world where the supposedly possessed girl was living in a secluded house. Then you are to meet Tom Wilkinson' priest Father Moore who is charged for negligence that the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) says resulted in the death of Emily Rose. Very ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) takes up the case to defend the priest.From this point, `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' starts to look like two films in one, one about the courtroom and the other about the death of Emily Rose.[COURTROOM DRAMA] The film says it is based on the true events, which are in themselves intriguing and intelligent too - `People vs. Exorcist' -- but what you see in the film's two hours you saw somewhere else in other countless courtroom dramas. The film has strong acting from the strong cast, but the characters are terribly flat. Though the frequent flashbacks attempt to hide the fact, the courtroom drama itself is boring and fails to live up to our expectation that we have from the initial scenes. The ambitious female lawyer is working under the slimy guy in suit. New evidence appears and witness appears and disappears as in some other films. The judge is severe (but fair). Haven't we seen them somewhere else before?[HORROR] Horror part of the film, which is mainly shown in the flashback scenes are slightly better, greatly helped by the very committed acting from Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose. She doesn't have to be Linda Blair with her rotating head, but it is easy to imagine she had to endure a lot. The film tries to give us shocks very often always with Ms. Carpenter doing something painful, like bending her body backward, scratching the wallpaper, and eating insects. And of course she has to growl like a demon. It is a cheap trick, some might say, but at least it is not boring.And whatever the producers might say about the film and its `based on the truth' story, we are attracted to the scary part of the film, and `Emily Rose' is certainly scary.

This movie not only doesn't live up to William Peter Blattys first movie it doesn't live up to the third one Legion Exorcist III with George C. Scott. Not sure it was even as good as the horrible Heretic or the last two bombs that they did twice cause they stunk.Now to get to Emily Rose. I found this movie to be one thing that a movie based on an exorcism should at least try to be and that is scarey. It wasn't scarey in the least. Not one time. As a court room drama I thought it was boring and blah. If they were going to present this as a court room drama they could have just done that and not passed judgement or had all the hocus pocus mumbo jumbo and let you decide. But they try to make it realistic by having and showing a trial (which I guess did happen in Germany in the real story of a girl with Grand Maul Epileptic Siezures that a bunch of morons convinced themselves was demonic possession and pumped her full of drugs and her haulucinations along with the epilepsy convinced them that she didn't need medical care but a witch doctor priest and they let her starve to death and die of neglect).I thought Laura Linney was boring and Campbell Scott was so ineffective and boring that I didn't even record or recognize him simply cause I didn't care.

However unlike the character of Emily Rose in this thought provoking drama none of our demons are named Lucifer. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" tackles the issue of faith, how science has displaced our belief system rationalizing everything around us and pulled us out of the psychological barbaric dark ages. The film dares to ask, what if our rational side is wrong? What if there are supernatural forces beyond our comprehension which drive the world around us every day? A compelling tale that mixes fact (the film is based on the true story of Anneliese Michel documented by Dr. Felicitas Goodman in the book ""The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel"") with the format of a suspense thriller, court room drama and delves into the place of faith and reason in our society. I've seen many people disappointed by the fact that this isn't ""The Exorcist"". This is a suspense drama NOT a horror film like ""The Exorcist"". The exorcism itself isn't the focus of this movie but, instead, a sidebar. This is really about the after effects of what happens to Father Moore and Erin.Laura Linney plays defense attorney Erin Bruner an agnostic gun for hire that recently won a highly publicized murder trial. When the head of her firm (Colm Feore) asks her to take on a case for the Catholic Church involving a priest Father Moore (Tom Wilinson) accused of negligent homicide of Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) she finds her disbelief melting as she's drawn further and further into the case. It seems that Emily, her family and Father Moore believe that she was possessed by the Devil. The prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) is a man of strong religious beliefs who finds himself convinced that the girl was an undiagnosed epileptic who died because she was denied nutrition, medical help and the medication to control her seizures. This collision of church and state creates more than sparks as Erin discovers disturbing evidence that Father Moore may be right. She's further disturbed when strange things begin to occur to her just as they did to Emily and to Father Moore after the death of Emily. A warning though to fans expecting gore galore--this isn't your typical horror film like ""The Devil's Rejects"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Instead, it's more of a suspense thriller using elements of the horror genre.A thought provoking film filled with intelligent performances, some genuinely scary sequences and many unanswered questions, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" may come across as a bit too pat at its conclusion but the ride itself makes the film worth it. This unrated version runs about 3 minutes longer than the theatrical version.""Exorcism"" doesn't have the heavenly glow of the many brightly colored epics and comic book films we've seen this year and that works to the film's advantage. Filled with moody cinematography, striking images and plenty of mystic fog the transfer looks very good. There are some minor issues with compression particularly during one sequence involving heavy fog but, on the whole, the film captures the stark and scary look of its theatrical debut. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround soundtrack becomes genuinely spooky during many of the scenes involving Emily and Father Moore but the more tense court room scenes come across as much more passive involving only the ambience of the court. That stark contrast between these two worlds and experiences make the scenes involving Emily's ""breakdown"" and exorcism all the more riveting.We get a featurette that examines the history of the film and how the real event inspired the filmmakers to tackle such a daunting project with such an unusually intelligent approach. There's also a featurette that focuses on the visual approach for the film this is interesting as the director is, essentially, telling two different stories from two different points of view. As I mentioned before very few films have balanced the thriller aspects with those looking at the role of faith in our society and ""Exorcism"", like ""The Exorcist"", manages to transcend the limitations of the genre. We also get a single deleted scene that, although important from a character development point of view, clearly would have slowed the narrative down and was wisely extracted.The commentary by director/co-writer Scott Derrickson focuses on many aspects of the production from the elements they borrowed from the real case to those of performance and integrating visual effects into the film in a believable fashion. The latter was missing from both ""Dominion"" and ""The Exorcist: The Beginning"" and, hence, undermined both those films from becoming little more than a footnote in the suspense/thriller/horror genre. In many respects, Derrickson's film acts almost as a ""sequel"" to ""The Exorcist"" (as that film was also based on a real life exorcism they share an incident that occurred as the basis of their projects). Derrickson's comments are intelligent and thoughtful about the project and the challenges he and his cast faced in making the story both compelling and believable.The unrated version (which is the version I saw)doesn't appear to me to feature any more gore than the theatrical version. My guess is that it features scenes that run just a tad bit longer but weren't included in the theatrical version. While the film sputters a bit by the time of the conclusion, the two hour journey was still more than worthwhile. A warning though to fans expecting gore galore--this isn't your typical horror film like ""The Devil's Rejects"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". The film manages to combine elements of ""The Exorcist"" and shows like ""Law & Order"" into a compelling mix all its own. Drawn into the darkness that consumes Emily both Father Moore and Erin are changed forever by their experience.",5,"""Once you see the darkness, I believe you hold onto it for the rest of your

950077,A2ZKAK8WNWCYEF,B000BTJDG2,"W. Dent ""Life Lover""","[2, 2]","Jennifer Carpenter who became known to most of us via her characterization of Debra Morgan on the hit Showtime series Dexter, hits the ball out of the park as Emily Rose. Granted the movie doesn't allow us to see a whole lot of Emily as much of the script deals with the events surrounding her rather than focus on her specifically, but Ms. Carpenter's appearances on screen greatly impact the stories overall haunting atmosphere. Much has been written about her ability to contort her face and body to the point where the make-up and special effects departments could take a few days off during the shoot, but one has to see her performance to fully understand the depth of her abilities. The lack of vanity in her portrayal of Emily Rose is astounding. She does not act in this movie....she BECOMES Emily Rose. Moreover, for most of her on screen appearances in this movie, she becomes the demons which inhabited Emily's mind and body! No mean feat!The cast of this movie are for the most part, veterans of the big screen and all contribute greatly to the movie's overall success. Erin Bruner, played by Laura Linney,actually becomes the main character in this movie, portraying a rising attorney who takes the case initially to make senior partner in her firm. She quickly becomes engrossed in the beliefs and motives of her client, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson)helped by certain supernatural occurrences in her own life. Although Father Moore is not privy to exactly what occurrences are taking place in Ms. Bruner's life, he warns her to watch out for spiritual attacks due to her involvement in the case. She is transformed from being a cynic to being less of a cynic to allowing for the possibility that things not seen with the naked eye might nevertheless exist. These new perspectives lead her to give one of the more brilliant closing statements in T.V./Movie history!The supporting cast is stellar and Kenneth Welsh who plays Dr. Mueller is deserving of special mention. His frightened performance as the Dr. who discovers that being a witness to exorcism is no walk in the park, speaks to the audience, most of whom have never been to a real life exorcism, very directly. He states that if he had known, he never would have agreed to participate. It is obvious in the movie that he is not speaking to the subsequent trial but to the horrors that are now a part of his life. Having seen the dark forces, he can never be the person he was before his encounter.This movie kept me entranced throughout and stuck with me even unto now. Judging from the articles I have since read online, many people were struck by this movie to the point of further investigation into the actual story upon which the movie was based. Movies that stick with you beyond the closing credits are rare these days. This one will haunt you.

950078,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B000BTJDG2,Willy D. Reviewer,"[3, 7]","Read the other One Star reviews -- they trash this film and deservedly so.Let me review it from the legal end.  The court room drama is bogus.  It doesn't matter if the real story took place in Germany, or ""based on"" in America -- legal procedure does not work as portrayed.  For example, the judge scolds the defense attorney in open court for being late.  That is grounds to request a mistrial (which would be denied) and later used as one of the issues on appeal.  The judge would have called both attorneys to the bench and quietly told them if either one was late they would be held in contempt of court.  By scolding the attorney in front of the jury -- which would not have been called in until both attorneys were present -- it sends a message to the jury that the judge is anti-defense attorney.More than likely some of the jurors were christian and maybe catholic.  (A good defense attorney would have made sure at least 4 of the jurors were catholic in an attempt to hang the jury.)  The D.A. does everything he can to insult the priest -- thereby insulting the jurors christian beliefs.  Even if the jurors don't believe in the priest's exorcism rites, they do believe in Christianity.  The D.A. has made himself unlikeable to the jury.  He shows the priest no respect and thereby the Christians of the jury no respect.(It is not uncommon for a jury to side with the attorney they like, regardless of the facts of the case.)A doctor who can help the defense approaches the defense attorney and says he will testify for the priest.  He is the key that will set the priest free.  What does the defense attorney tell him?  Come to court tomorrow morning!  The first thing she would have done is that night take his deposition in the presence of an attorney from the D.A.s office.  Then when he was killed, she could have entered that document into evidence.  A document does not carry the weight of live testimony with a jury, but it does with a Court of Appeals.  So, the doctor is accidentally killed and she has no great witness nor a document of his testimony.Half way into the trial, she discovers that she needs an M.D. who can rebut the states M.D.!  Excuse me, she would have deposed this M.D. prior to the trial -- she would have known exactly what his testimony was going to be.  Prior to the trial she would have lined up at least 3 M.D.s to rebut the states witness.  She would not wait to the last minute and have the light bulb go off in her head.And she tells her associate -- during the trial -- that she knows nothing about exorcisms. So the two of them get a stack of books to study -- and she's due back into court the next morning!  In other words, she did not prepare for the trial.  She works for a huge law firm.  This is a high-profile case.  Everyone in that firm would have contributed to making her defense.Out of desperation, she reads a book authored by an ""expert"" in exorcisms.  And what do you know -- the expert is available to testify.  But the expert can only testify as to what people of faith believe exorcisms to be, not if the priest performed a correct exorcism, or if an exorcism was even necessary.  And this is where the D.A. dropped the ball -- he could have (in a polite way) shredded this witness.  He only asked a couple of non-relevant questions.And finally, the defense attorney gives the worst closing argument in the history of jurisprudence.  Rent the film just to watch that closing argument.  She deliberately makes the case for the D.A.  She continually repeats all the strong points of his case, and underlines the weaknesses of her case.  She concludes by saying to effect, ""Hey maybe there are demons -- I don't believe in them -- but the priest did, so you should give him the benefit of the doubt and set him free.""The priest has grounds for appeal based upon his attorney giving up on his defense and surrendering to the D.A., and her lack of preparedness for trial.  He was definitely not represented by a competent attorney.  She should be disbarred.",1,Don't Bother,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,4022,"['Read', 'other', 'One', 'Star', 'reviews', 'trash', 'film', 'deservedly', 'so.Let', 'review', 'legal', 'end', 'court', 'room', 'drama', 'bogus', ""n't"", 'matter', 'real', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'Germany', 'based', 'America', 'legal', 'procedure', 'not', 'work', 'portrayed', 'example', 'judge', 'defense', 'attorney', 'open', 'court', 'being', 'late', 'grounds', 'request', 'mistrial', 'would', 'be', 'denied', 'later', 'used', 'one', 'issues', 'appeal', 'judge', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'attorneys', 'bench', 'quietly', 'told', 'one', 'was', 'late', 'would', 'be', 'held', 'contempt', 'court', 'scolding', 'attorney', 'front', 'jury', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'attorneys', 'were', 'present', 'message', 'jury', 'judge', 'anti-defense', 'attorney.More', 'likely', 'jurors', 'were', 'christian', 'maybe', 'catholic', 'good', 'defense', 'attorney', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sure', 'least', '4', 'jurors', 'were', 'catholic', 'attempt', 'hang', 'jury', 'D.A', 'everything', 'can', 'insult', 'priest', 'thereby', 'insulting', 'jurors', 'christian', 'beliefs', 'Even', 'jurors', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'priest', 'exorcism', 'rites', 'do', 'believe', 'Christianity', 'D.A', 'made', 'unlikeable', 'jury', 'priest', 'respect', 'thereby', 'Christians', 'jury', 'respect', 'not', 'uncommon', 'jury', 'side', 'attorney', 'like', 'regardless', 'facts', 'case', 'doctor', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'defense', 'defense', 'attorney', 'will', 'testify', 'priest', 'key', 'will', 'set', 'priest', 'free', 'What', 'defense', 'attorney', 'tell', 'Come', 'court', 'tomorrow', 'morning', 'first', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'night', 'take', 'deposition', 'presence', 'attorney', 'D.A.s', 'office', 'Then', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'could', 'have', 'entered', 'document', 'evidence', 'document', 'not', 'carry', 'weight', 'live', 'testimony', 'jury', 'Court', 'Appeals', 'So', 'doctor', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'great', 'witness', 'document', 'testimony.Half', 'way', 'trial', 'M.D', 'who', 'can', 'rebut', 'states', 'M.D.', 'Excuse', 'would', 'have', 'deposed', 'M.D', 'prior', 'trial', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'exactly', 'what', 'testimony', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Prior', 'trial', 'would', 'have', 'lined', 'up', 'least', '3', 'M.D.s', 'rebut', 'states', 'witness', 'would', 'not', 'wait', 'last', 'minute', 'have', 'light', 'bulb', 'go', 'off', 'head.And', 'associate', 'trial', 'nothing', 'exorcisms', 'two', 'get', 'stack', 'books', 'study', 'due', 'back', 'court', 'next', 'morning', 'other', 'words', 'did', 'not', 'prepare', 'trial', 'huge', 'law', 'firm', 'high-profile', 'case', 'Everyone', 'firm', 'would', 'have', 'contributed', 'making', 'defense.Out', 'desperation', 'book', 'authored', 'expert', 'exorcisms', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'expert', 'available', 'testify', 'expert', 'can', 'only', 'testify', 'what', 'people', 'faith', 'believe', 'exorcisms', 'be', 'not', 'priest', 'performed', 'correct', 'exorcism', 'exorcism', 'was', 'even', 'necessary', 'where', 'D.A', 'dropped', 'ball', 'could', 'have', 'polite', 'way', 'shredded', 'witness', 'only', 'asked', 'couple', 'non-relevant', 'questions.And', 'finally', 'defense', 'attorney', 'worst', 'closing', 'argument', 'history', 'jurisprudence', 'Rent', 'film', 'just', 'watch', 'closing', 'argument', 'deliberately', 'case', 'D.A', 'continually', 'strong', 'points', 'case', 'weaknesses', 'case', 'saying', 'effect', 'Hey', 'maybe', 'are', 'demons', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'priest', 'did', 'should', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'set', 'free', 'priest', 'grounds', 'appeal', 'based', 'attorney', 'giving', 'up', 'defense', 'surrendering', 'D.A.', 'lack', 'preparedness', 'trial', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'represented', 'competent', 'attorney', 'should', 'be', 'disbarred']",N/A
950079,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B000BTJDG2,Wisconsin Dad,"[4, 6]","The Exorcism of Emily Rose caught me off guard. I thought I was in for a thriller/horror movie with the same old Hollywood elements. Man, was I wrong.The Exorcism, of Emily Rose is a movie based on the real life story of Emily Rose, a young lady who headed off for college and ended up losing her mind or being possessed by Lucifer...you decide.All the elements of a great film are there: wonderful storytelling, incredible acting, good pacing, and entrancing visuals. Jennifer Carpenter (as Emily Rose) puts in one of the best acting performances I have seen in a while. I am headed to find more movies with Carpenter in them as I write. Laura Linney as Erin Bruner and Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore are strong as well.Make no mistake, the Exorcism of Emily Rose is not a horror movie, per se. But...it is very scary. I found this movie more unsettling than any horror movie I have watched this year, and I have watched many. The scene with Erin Bruner in her home was amazingly tense. Also note that there is no blood and gore in the film.This is not a film with average frights, as it may linger in the minds of even seasoned fright buffs. I went to bed after the film (I work second shift), rolled over to look at the alarm clock, and it read 2:59. It turned 3 AM as I looked. I had to get up and check all the doors in the house. I was truly creeped out.I guess the fright in the film comes from the fact that it could happen to any of us. It also comes from the unknown. Was Emily crazy?Anywho, I can't say enough good about this film. It is a court drama, a story about people you will care about, and one heck of a frightening and unsettling film that tackles huge questions about God and demons.Total Score (out of 100) = 8948 (out of 50).

""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is one of them.THE PLOT: The movie is based on the actual story of a German girl who died while being exorcised in the late 1970s. The priest was then put on trial for neglectful homicide. Google it for details.Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) plays an agnostic who defends the priest (Tom Wilkinson), the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) is a believer. This creates some problems: How can an unbeliever defend a believer who performs a service that apparently kills the young woman? How can a believer come against another believer who was simply trying to deliver the girl from spiritual malevolence?The prosecutor makes the case that the woman was ill with various mental disorders and that the exorcism was just a bunch of superstitious mumbo jumbo. By contrast, Erin Bruner argues that these illnesses were the RESULT OF possession -- that the girl's possession brought on the symptoms. This makes sense in light of the scriptural evidence of Jesus Christ delivering people from evil spirits who induced insanity, muteness and deafness.Another important argument of the defense is that a potent drug that Emily was prescribed trapped her in a mode that was resistant to the exorcism.The fascinating story provokes many questions. We need to take an honest look at our mental health practices and institutions. Although there are some genuinely good people working in this field who care about the patients, it seems that the best we can do is drug people and make them, more or less, numbed-up living zombies or even mindless vegetables. Unfortunately this is how they're damned to live the rest of their lives, subservient and dependent on the mental health establishment (that actually needs them to stay ill in order to exist).Such people don't need more drugs and ""therapy."" What they need is delivered. They need delivered from evil spiritual powers that have possessed them. They need FREED. Don't mistake me here, I'm not against mental health people or facilities because I realize they're just doing what they know to do. It's just not working. Again, the mentally ill need delivered not force-fed more drugs and essentially locked-up for the rest of their lives. That's not life, it's living death!Of course, releasing a horde of religious wackos into our mental institutions isn't the answer. Yet, what if some believers who walked in the boldness and authority of Jesus Christ were available, people who show documented evidence of DELIVERING the mentally ill? The New Testament relays case after case of Jesus Christ exorcizing demons from hundreds of people, maybe thousands. He didn't numb `em up and sentence them to a life of living death. Rather he came to set the prisoners free from darkness, heal the sick and heal the brokenhearted! If there are people out there who walk in this same anointing of power and freedom, shouldn't we allow them to minister to our mentally ill?Unfortunately a large percentage of the church is very weak in regards to spiritual deliverance. Except for offering eternal salvation, their gospel is powerless and next to worthless. Yet this wasn't the way of the early church. Paul, Peter and others offered total deliverance. Thankfully, there are still a remnant of these types of believers and these are the ones who can help our mentally ill, as long as the oppressed WANT freedom, healing and deliverance (some WANT to stay dependent and ""cared for"").I'm only raising such moral/theological/philisophical questions because the film provokes it, so please don't be irked at me for getting all heavy and theological.Despite the numerous courtroom scenes there's certainly enough horrifying elements in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" to please most horror fans, just don't expect Freddy or Jason shenanigans. Like my title blurb points out, this film will literally scare the hell out of you.Interestingly, while it's horrifying ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is also somehow warm and faith-affirming, even sometimes beautiful.My only criticism is a theological theory introduced late in the film. This theory is incredible wrong. I won't elaborate except to say that God would never allow the option of Emily's possession as a supposed testimony to the world of the existence of dark spiritual powers, rather His purpose is always to deliver such people, which not only testifies to the existence of the malevolent powers but, more importantly, sets the person FREE and gives glory to God.GRADE: A",5,Scares the hell out of

It challenges you, and probably makes you question about your faith and what you really believe.

On the surface, the two plotlines can only work against each other.  How can the supernatural coexist with the courtroom?  In contrary, this is the film's strength.  The courtroom drama anchors horror elements in ""reality,"" therefore adds depth to the film.  It intensifies the terror.  As a bonus, the film avoids being a clone of ""Exorcist.""The courtroom drama is well-thought out.  It touches upon some enduring issues:Good vs. evilReligious morality vs. Human lawsMedicine vs. SpiritDoctor's obligation to treat vs. Patient's refusal of treatmentAs one watches the movie, he/she is inadventently taking sides, as one of the 12 juries selected.The two plotlines in one movies does have its drawbacks, resulting in some awkward or underdeveloped moments.  For an example, the story suggests that the defense lawyer (Laura Linney) is under demonic attack during the trial, which engenders her spiritual growth.  The subplot adds emotional weight to the story.  However, this suggests that demons are real. The film is taking side of the defense.Despite this, the film is a resounding success.  Scary moments are painful to watch.  Sound effects are creepy.  The acting is superb.
