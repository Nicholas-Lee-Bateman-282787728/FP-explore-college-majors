Otis, on the other hand, not near as good. Sort of dull in spots. Although It had more dark humor than Dr. Giggles. This Blu-ray is a good buy for Dr. Giggles mostly If you can find it inexpensive enough.",4,Get it for Dr. Giggles,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,288,"['had', 'been', 'awhile', ""'d"", 'last', 'seen', 'Dr.', 'Giggles', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'Otis', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Sort', 'dull', 'spots', 'had', 'more', 'dark', 'humor', 'Dr.', 'Giggles', 'Blu-ray', 'good', 'buy', 'Dr.', 'Giggles', 'mostly', 'can', 'find', 'inexpensive', 'enough']",Dr. Giggles/Otis

The main actor is great, sorry I can't recall his name, and he knows his way around the set.

1342566,A24Q7Q8DXQUZ52,B003F17ZO0,Vinnie Rattolle,"[8, 9]","I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray, but the DVD of ""Otis"" has a ton of great extras (commentary, deleted/alternate scenes/ending, featurette, trailers, etc.).  This version, however, has no extras whatsoever.  I thought the point of Blu Ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality.On the plus side, ""Dr. Giggles"" has never looked better, and this seems to be the only Blu Ray release of that film.  Though it's weird that they've paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly 20 years later.If you're only interested in the films themselves, you can't beat the price.  But the lack of extras is irksome.",2,They cut the extras,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,658,"['dunno', 'stand-alone', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'Otis', 'ton', 'great', 'extras', 'commentary', 'deleted/alternate', 'scenes/ending', 'featurette', 'trailers', 'etc.', 'version', 'however', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'thought', 'point', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'was', 'being', 'able', 'jam', 'more', 'disc', 'maintaining', 'superior', 'picture', 'plus', 'side', 'Dr.', 'Giggles', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'be', 'only', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'film', 'weird', ""'ve"", 'paired', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'movie', 'made', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'later.If', ""'re"", 'only', 'interested', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'price', 'lack', 'extras', 'irksome']",Dr. Giggles/Otis
