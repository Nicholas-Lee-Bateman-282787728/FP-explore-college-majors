975223,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EOTSA0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[25, 31]","At the very beginning of ""Side Effects,"" our heroine, Karly Hert (Katherine Heigl), tells us that she sells drugs for a living, quickly adding that she does it legally.  Karly is not a drug pusher; she is a sales rep for a pharmaceutical company.  Writer/director/producer Kathleen Slatery-Moschkau worked several years in just such a job, so her objective here is to air the industry's dirty laundry and possibly convince you that drug pushers might not be that bad in comparison for the simple reason that the drug companies do not take as much of your money.Katy is hired by the company, not because she knows anything about pharmaceuticals, but because she is a babe.  However, Katy is not really comfortable in a corporate world where making money is the bottom line and her boss prefers that she wear panty hose is she is gong to wear a skirt.  On the other hand, when they hired her they gave Katy a company car and that is nothing to sneeze at.  Then Katy meets Zach Danner (Lucian McAfee), who is the antithesis of the world in which she lives.  Zach's goal is build his own house and this ideal makes up for the fact he does not look like your typical leading man in a movie.  Still, Katy is committed to their future together and circles the date on the calendar when she will quit her job so they can go built their home in the woods.At that point ""Side Effects"" takes an interesting satirical turn because Katy decides that instead of following the company's scripts for selling durgs she is going to tell doctors the truth (to wit, their product is not any better than comparable products by their competitors, just more expensive).  I thought Slatery-Moschkau was going to take more advantage of this approach, like they did in the Dudley Moore movie ""Crazy People"" did with its hysterical shtick of telling the truth in commercial advertising, but it becomes a minor yet ironic joke as her unorthodox approach makes Katy successful and gets her on the management track.  That means a nicer company car and as her unscrupulous company gears up for the release of the new anti-depressant that they want to turn into a billion dollar blockbuster, Katy finds herself being led into temptation and putting her future with Zach in doubt.Although ""Side Effects"" is clearly a work of passion and personal commitment for Slatery-Moschkau, she clearly wears too many hats in making this film.  After all, this is her first film and her objectives would be better served by a writer and a director with more experience.  What she does have going for her is that she has gotten Katherine Heigl to play the lead role and even persuaded her to do a couple of semi-nude scenes (the term now being defined as seeing the side of the breasts but drawing the line at coming close to seeing a nipple).  Heigl has the babe part down and her winsome personality makes up for a lot of the flaws of this film.  However, I fully admit that in the end I round up on this film simply because while I would hope that the idea pharmaceutical companies are interested first and foremost with making profits is not news to anybody, it never hurts to be reminded of the fact and to take a look behind the curtain.Slatery-Moschkau does a filmmaker commentary that offers an inside look at the making of the film, but also a medical commentary where she explores the medical issues brought up in the film, based on her decade working for the pharmaceutical industry.  So you can regulate how outraged you want to be by what these companies are doing as you go through the DVD's special features.  Slatery-Moschkau followed up this film with a documentary this year, ""Money Talks: Profits Before Patient Safety,"" which is obviously compatible with the position of this 2005 film.  Too bad the film does not offer any solutions to the problems it details beyond the basic belief that drug companies should not be doing what they are doing.",4,A satirical but not quite scathing indictment of the pharmaceutical industry,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,3919,"['very', 'beginning', 'Side', 'Effects', 'heroine', 'Karly', 'Hert', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'drugs', 'living', 'quickly', 'adding', 'legally', 'Karly', 'not', 'drug', 'pusher', 'sales', 'rep', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'Writer/director/producer', 'Kathleen', 'Slatery-Moschkau', 'worked', 'several', 'years', 'just', 'job', 'objective', 'here', 'air', 'industry', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'possibly', 'convince', 'drug', 'pushers', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'comparison', 'simple', 'reason', 'drug', 'companies', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'money.Katy', 'hired', 'company', 'not', 'anything', 'pharmaceuticals', 'babe', 'However', 'Katy', 'not', 'really', 'comfortable', 'corporate', 'world', 'where', 'making', 'money', 'bottom', 'line', 'boss', 'prefers', 'wear', 'panty', 'hose', 'gong', 'wear', 'skirt', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'hired', 'gave', 'Katy', 'company', 'car', 'nothing', 'sneeze', 'Then', 'Katy', 'meets', 'Zach', 'Danner', 'Lucian', 'McAfee', 'who', 'antithesis', 'world', 'Zach', 'goal', 'build', 'own', 'house', 'ideal', 'up', 'fact', 'not', 'look', 'typical', 'leading', 'man', 'movie', 'Still', 'Katy', 'committed', 'future', 'together', 'date', 'calendar', 'when', 'will', 'quit', 'job', 'can', 'go', 'built', 'home', 'woods.At', 'point', 'Side', 'Effects', 'interesting', 'satirical', 'turn', 'Katy', 'instead', 'following', 'company', 'scripts', 'selling', 'durgs', 'going', 'tell', 'doctors', 'truth', 'wit', 'product', 'not', 'better', 'comparable', 'products', 'competitors', 'just', 'more', 'expensive', 'thought', 'Slatery-Moschkau', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'more', 'advantage', 'approach', 'did', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'movie', 'Crazy', 'People', 'did', 'hysterical', 'shtick', 'telling', 'truth', 'commercial', 'advertising', 'minor', 'yet', 'ironic', 'joke', 'unorthodox', 'approach', 'Katy', 'successful', 'management', 'track', 'nicer', 'company', 'car', 'unscrupulous', 'company', 'up', 'release', 'new', 'anti-depressant', 'want', 'turn', 'billion', 'dollar', 'blockbuster', 'Katy', 'being', 'led', 'temptation', 'putting', 'future', 'Zach', 'doubt.Although', 'Side', 'Effects', 'clearly', 'work', 'passion', 'personal', 'commitment', 'Slatery-Moschkau', 'clearly', 'too', 'many', 'hats', 'making', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'objectives', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'writer', 'director', 'more', 'experience', 'What', 'have', 'going', 'gotten', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'play', 'lead', 'role', 'even', 'persuaded', 'do', 'couple', 'semi-nude', 'scenes', 'term', 'now', 'being', 'defined', 'seeing', 'side', 'breasts', 'drawing', 'line', 'coming', 'close', 'seeing', 'nipple', 'Heigl', 'babe', 'part', 'down', 'winsome', 'personality', 'up', 'lot', 'flaws', 'film', 'However', 'fully', 'admit', 'end', 'round', 'up', 'film', 'simply', 'would', 'hope', 'idea', 'pharmaceutical', 'companies', 'are', 'interested', 'first', 'foremost', 'making', 'profits', 'not', 'news', 'anybody', 'never', 'be', 'reminded', 'fact', 'take', 'look', 'curtain.Slatery-Moschkau', 'filmmaker', 'commentary', 'inside', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'medical', 'commentary', 'where', 'medical', 'issues', 'brought', 'up', 'film', 'based', 'decade', 'working', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'can', 'regulate', 'how', 'outraged', 'want', 'be', 'what', 'companies', 'are', 'doing', 'go', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'Slatery-Moschkau', 'followed', 'up', 'film', 'documentary', 'year', 'Money', 'Talks', 'Profits', 'Patient', 'Safety', 'obviously', 'compatible', 'position', '2005', 'film', 'Too', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'offer', 'solutions', 'problems', 'details', 'basic', 'belief', 'drug', 'companies', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'what', 'are', 'doing']",Side Effects
975224,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B000EOTSA0,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[2, 3]","""Side Effects"" is a recent, low budget film, showing the high budget con game the pharmaceutical companies play and the drug representatives role.  The material is meant to be a scathing, timely commentary on the pharmaceutical industry , however, the movie makes the issue seem trite and lukewarm.  Katherine Heigl plays the pharmaceutical salesperson who is making a big salary with plenty of bonuses.  Wrestling with her conscience, she needs the money and she feels she can push away any doubts on any drug's dubious health claims.  The truth hits her in the face one day, and she has to decide between her career and one true, average salaried boyfriend, Zach (Lucian McAffee).The movie has a bad soundtrack, which irked my senses, plus the story was stiff and unnatural.  Katherine Heigl is beautiful, however,  her many costume and hair-do changes were distracting, and  felt  ""inserted"" to help her get future roles.  ""Side Effects"" did not flow well, and I felt an expose on the pharmaceutical industry should have been more of a documentary.  The scenes showing free gifts, mugs, and food buffets for doctors and staff are a big part of the sales as well as using pretty reps to get the male physicians to ""buy in"" to using new drugs.  Obviously fake interviews with physicians were inserted throughout the film and chopped up the story.The story is about pharmaceutical salesperson Karly (Katherine Heigl) who makes the big bucks, but is her job worth the toll it takes on her conscience?  After many years of pushing pricey drugs without really knowing if they're safe or effective, Karly doubts her career choice daily.  A new love interest by the name of Zach hopes she will drop her job and move into the home he is building.  Karly is pulled both ways and has to make a hard decision, which is predictable.""Side Effects"" has an amazingly weak script, amateurish direction and production, which prevents anyone from enjoying this clumsy watered-down expose.",3,Clumsy Expose of the Pharmaceutical Industry,1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,1972,"['Side', 'Effects', 'recent', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'showing', 'high', 'budget', 'con', 'game', 'pharmaceutical', 'companies', 'play', 'drug', 'representatives', 'role', 'material', 'meant', 'be', 'scathing', 'timely', 'commentary', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'however', 'movie', 'issue', 'seem', 'trite', 'lukewarm', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'pharmaceutical', 'salesperson', 'who', 'making', 'big', 'salary', 'plenty', 'bonuses', 'Wrestling', 'conscience', 'money', 'can', 'push', 'away', 'doubts', 'drug', 'dubious', 'health', 'claims', 'truth', 'face', 'one', 'day', 'decide', 'career', 'one', 'true', 'average', 'salaried', 'boyfriend', 'Zach', 'Lucian', 'McAffee', '.The', 'movie', 'bad', 'soundtrack', 'irked', 'senses', 'story', 'was', 'stiff', 'unnatural', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'beautiful', 'however', 'many', 'costume', 'hair-do', 'changes', 'were', 'distracting', 'felt', 'inserted', 'help', 'get', 'future', 'roles', 'Side', 'Effects', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'well', 'felt', 'expose', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'showing', 'free', 'gifts', 'mugs', 'food', 'buffets', 'doctors', 'staff', 'are', 'big', 'part', 'sales', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'pretty', 'reps', 'get', 'male', 'buy', 'using', 'new', 'drugs', 'Obviously', 'fake', 'interviews', 'physicians', 'were', 'inserted', 'film', 'chopped', 'up', 'story.The', 'story', 'about', 'pharmaceutical', 'salesperson', 'Karly', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'who', 'big', 'bucks', 'job', 'toll', 'conscience', 'many', 'years', 'pushing', 'pricey', 'drugs', 'really', 'knowing', ""'re"", 'safe', 'effective', 'Karly', 'career', 'choice', 'daily', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'name', 'Zach', 'will', 'drop', 'job', 'move', 'home', 'building', 'Karly', 'pulled', 'ways', 'make', 'hard', 'decision', 'predictable', 'Side', 'Effects', 'amazingly', 'weak', 'script', 'amateurish', 'direction', 'production', 'anyone', 'enjoying', 'clumsy', 'watered-down', 'expose']",Side Effects
975225,ACKRYLMR9QGS3,B000EOTSA0,L. Schenck,"[0, 1]","I gave this movie three stars because ....  Well.. I have this thing for Katherine Heigle.  And the 2.3 seconds of her topless is a score!But the rest of he movie sucked.  The topic is one that deserves a serious treatment and that can even be in the quirky-romantic-comedy format but this one was not well executed.  The scenes jumped from one to another with an anoying lack of continuity.

975226,A2E16NM4CZ1N66,B000EOTSA0,"Matt Conner ""psychiatrist""","[12, 15]","This movie has a lot of strikes against it - the different ""locations"" are frequently the same room with furniture rearranged.  Narrative devices like text on screen or interlude interviews are picked up and abandoned at random.  Subplots (in particular, those involving Karly's best friend and the rest of her family) are never resolved, and the dialogue is frequently clunky exposition of company rhetoric.  Many of the supporting actors are obviously not in the same league as the main players, and it's not hard to predict the plot points of the film.But the movie has heart and a winning lead actress in Katherine Heigl, and this movie has become one of my guilty pleasures.  As a medical professional, I have heard all of the arguments for and against drug reps as depicted in this film, but the scenes where Karly shows how hard it is to do her job were particularly convicting.  Corporate ethics aside, these are personal issues, and most of these people are just trying to pay the bills.  The movie really humanizes the industry reps, even if the characters themselves aren't exactly three-dimensional.And yes, Katherine Heigl takes her top off.  Twice.  I would consider it exploitative except that she executive produced this movie, and in that case, if you've got it, flaunt it.  The brief nudity does fit logically into the scenes.In the end, I recommend watching this movie with as light a heart as possible (and a little vodka, if you've got it).  It's not revolutionary, but it raises good discussion points, and it will give you a fix until you can see Katherine Heigl on the far superior Grey's Anatomy.",4,"So bad, it's good",1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1621,"['movie', 'lot', 'strikes', 'different', 'locations', 'are', 'frequently', 'same', 'room', 'furniture', 'rearranged', 'Narrative', 'devices', 'text', 'screen', 'interlude', 'interviews', 'are', 'picked', 'up', 'abandoned', 'random', 'Subplots', 'particular', 'involving', 'Karly', 'best', 'friend', 'rest', 'family', 'are', 'never', 'resolved', 'dialogue', 'frequently', 'clunky', 'exposition', 'company', 'rhetoric', 'Many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'obviously', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'main', 'players', 'not', 'hard', 'predict', 'plot', 'points', 'film.But', 'movie', 'heart', 'winning', 'lead', 'actress', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'movie', 'become', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'medical', 'professional', 'have', 'heard', 'arguments', 'drug', 'reps', 'depicted', 'film', 'scenes', 'where', 'Karly', 'how', 'hard', 'do', 'job', 'were', 'particularly', 'convicting', 'Corporate', 'ethics', 'aside', 'are', 'personal', 'issues', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'pay', 'bills', 'movie', 'really', 'industry', 'even', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'three-dimensional.And', 'yes', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'top', 'off', 'Twice', 'would', 'consider', 'exploitative', 'executive', 'produced', 'movie', 'case', ""'ve"", 'got', 'brief', 'nudity', 'fit', 'logically', 'scenes.In', 'end', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'as', 'light', 'heart', 'possible', 'little', 'vodka', ""'ve"", 'got', 'not', 'revolutionary', 'good', 'discussion', 'points', 'will', 'give', 'fix', 'can', 'see', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'far', 'superior', 'Grey', 'Anatomy']",Side Effects

There is a lot more to pharmaceutical company corruption than this movie portrays, but it certainly reveals more than most people are aware of before seeing it.  I am concerned when friends and neighbors take prescription drugs without taking into account the side effects.  Even though there is plenty of information on the Internet about people's experiences with prescription drugs, few people take the time to research them before getting their prescriptions filled.  Even more concerning, few people realize that even their doctors don't know most of the really serious side effects.  This film brings awareness to the problem of the real dangers of drugs and the corruption of pharmaceutical companies.  I would suggest digging even deeper, but this movie is a great start.  Heigl is great as always, and although this is a low-budget film and does look it, it's worth watching and has a good storyline.
