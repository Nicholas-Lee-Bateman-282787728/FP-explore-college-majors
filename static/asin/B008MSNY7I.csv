1570603,A23GCAHRORAPK7,B008MSNY7I,AnimeFan,"[1, 1]","This anime was very fun to watch. This anime involves a college student, Kimimaro Yoga, who gets invited to a new world known as the Financial District, where Entrepreneurs gather and earn large sums of money. These Entrepreneurs fight daily with their assets, which are the manifestation of their entrepreneurs future, to earn money. However, if an Entrepreneur loses even a small sum of money, their future changes significantly. Kimimaro then fights to redeem the future that was used as collateral. I would highly recommend this anime to any anime fan or anyone who enjoys economics.",5,C: The Money and Soul of Possibility,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,587,"['anime', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'anime', 'college', 'student', 'Kimimaro', 'Yoga', 'who', 'invited', 'new', 'world', 'known', 'Financial', 'District', 'where', 'Entrepreneurs', 'gather', 'earn', 'large', 'sums', 'money', 'Entrepreneurs', 'fight', 'daily', 'assets', 'are', 'manifestation', 'entrepreneurs', 'future', 'earn', 'money', 'However', 'Entrepreneur', 'even', 'small', 'sum', 'money', 'future', 'changes', 'significantly', 'Kimimaro', 'then', 'redeem', 'future', 'was', 'used', 'collateral', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anime', 'anime', 'fan', 'anyone', 'who', 'economics']",N/A
1570604,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B008MSNY7I,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[2, 3]","A [C] Control- The Money of Soul and Possibility Anime ReviewUltimately what was a big draw for [C] Control- The Money of Soul and Possibility was , of course, its animation from the whole universe concept [C] Control- The Money of Soul and Possibility was unique. While the character development in of itself isn't really all that much the character designs are really cool and some outright cute.Kimimaro is a young man that just so happens to be a scholarship student tight on money trying to make some money. He's drawn into a world that involves huge supernatural battles for the winning glory of powerful ""Midas money"" which is set apart from your regular real world money. This money is black and slowly but surely its trying to infect our average real world. The worst part is no one realizes except those involved with The Financial District ,the place where the supernatural battles break loose. So you see an interesting concept! And that is just skimping the surface of this anime series.While character development and complexity certainly lagged with its fresh animation and very interesting fantasy world concept it more that makes up for it. There are times the series does make you reflect and speculate which is an added plus.OK,OK it may just seem like all that is happening here is that really throwing praise to [C] Control- The Money of Soul and Possibility but that is in fact due to the fact that this anime series does deserve the hype.

1570605,A28I728U6VJ8TZ,B008MSNY7I,Chaotic,"[0, 0]","This was a pretty good series, the artwork was great and the dub was also good. Pros of this series were the concept and the way the idea was executed. I loved the artwork, although there was a lot of CG animation for things that I didn't think needed it, such as some of the characters. The score was also decent, not as good as some others, but manageable nonetheless. The only issues I had with this series were the simple facts that the assets (individuals used for &#34;deals&#34;) reminded me of a Pokemon like concept (This series is nothing like such a trivial show, by the way), but besides that, a solid series. I would say a must buy for anyone interested in economics.

1570606,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B008MSNY7I,Coulter Rail,"[1, 2]","3.7 stars really.C: Control is a pleasant surprise.  It starts off with a great premise that's weakly executed and thinly explained, but picks up speed and intelligence, creating a must see anime.  The problem with creating an intricate, philosophical storyline is that if you succeed, you cannot drop the ball and feed us less at the end.  Let's get to it.***PROS***CONCEPTC: Control selects the recent economic upheaval as its platform to design a fantasy combat world.  The premise is sound, but the following story doesn't live up to it for the first 4 episodes.  After that, it feels like the writing staff got their concepts in order and the series begins to slay you with gripping financial ideas, leaps in character growth, and revolutionary metaphors.  For example, when players battle, the winner usually takes all, growing his bank roll and leaving the opponent bankrupt (cool, but becomes tiresome quickly and motivations remain very basic).  This changes!  The main character soon meets a wealthy heavy hitter whose combat philosophy is to earn money from his foes, but not to destroy them.  He declares that if you take down a big fish, the real world suffers.  He is an advocate for bailouts and using money and power to float and sustain the current system (the Responsible Shark).  Another character is introduced who is interested primarily in giving to the poor (the Robin Hood of this world), and we explore how genuine and necessary that role is, and how it's also misleading and unrealistic in solving ALL problems.  Others are driven naively to support their families through this world, even though when they lose they risk that very family.  It's about financial discussions told through fights.  Action fans will stomach the philosophies, and fans of theory will stomach the frequent carnival battles.  If you're fans of both, THEN HERE YOU ARE!ANIMATION:The design of the Financial District (where they fight) is fantastic.  It's a definitive look and you'll remember it.  The character designs are compelling, but not groundbreaking.  They do well blending CG with the animation, but not great.  The fighting regrettably has 3 frame movements, an overuse of CG gimmicks, reused shots, and one-hit-one-kills.  HOWEVER, episode six clearly has a different team at the helm, and the fighting animation leaps into feature film quality.  This team disappears afterwards, but then returns for the final episode.  It's very noticeable if you're an artist or student of animation.  So the animation is good, but after they present you with what they're really capable of (episode 6), you feel disappointed and robbed when it goes away.  So, 2 episodes stellar animation, and 9 episodes good.MUSIC:The music is diverse and fits perfectly with the narrative.  Scenes that would otherwise fall flat are lifted by the score.***CONS***LOST POTENTIAL:This series starts off slow, but then takes off with a blistering speed and embraces an inspiring narrative, poses complicated concepts, and weaves the human equation in and out with grace.  The ending is a quick reset button, rushed gimmick, and sparkling effort to wash their hands of complication.  I would say its style over substance, but it is void of the style the series has championed.  If you're enjoying the show for the action, then it satisfies, but if you've been intrigued by the storyline, its a boring slap in the face.  It resembles Soul Eater, were an extraordinary world is made simple with a single super punch to make the rainbows come out.All in all, this is a good anime.  It's worth the ride.  It just could have been great. An amazingly complicated story was presented and then handled at the end with the creative finesse of Disney.  The ending doesn't ruin the show, but takes 5 stars to 3, easily.  I would still recommend it to anyone, as the series will be entertaining to younglings and the concepts offered in the middle are a must witness for adults.  Enjoy C: Control.I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime.  If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along.

The value of the Yen is low and times are hard. Crime, suicide, and despair have taken hold. Kimimaro is a college student that aspires to be a public servant. That's the only thing he can think of to rise above the grip of poverty. One day a strange fellow approaches him with an offer. He says that if Kimmaro joins a group called the Financial District that he can make money. The catch is that in order to make a profit you must battle the other members. He gets a partner named Masho. Masho is a tenacious young girl that helps him fight. Eventually a financial phenomenon called ""C"" threatens to destroy the Japanese economy once and for all. There are a few members of the Financial District that think they can gain control of ""C"" and stop the collapse. Hense the series title ""C: Control"". But the control of C doesn't guarantee the future will be bright. Kimimaro and Masho must fight to rewrite the events that have set a financial crisis in motion.This series surprised the heck out of me. I didn't expect a whole lot. Sometimes a gamble pays off. This series illustrates that quite profoundly. I was able to get into many of the characters in this series. They are developed pretty well and are very interesting & colorful. This series has excellent animation, voice acting, and a good soundtrack. There is a lot of action, drama, suspense,and a little bit of romance. This series really has a lot going on as well. The plot races along at a very fast speed. It's easy to miss something if you miss even 1 episode. Overall I really enjoyed C: Control. I would like to see a sequel. It would probably be a bit redundant, but it's a great concept. I don't really think this anime will be continued, but it was left open for more if they really wanted to. Anyway, this anime is really good. I highly recommend it to any anime fan. I hope all of you enjoy it as much as I did.",4,Can Money Buy the Future We Want?,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,2001,"['Japan', 'saved', 'financial', 'ruin', 'Sovereign', 'Wealth', 'Fund', 'citizens', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'prosperos', 'life', 'value', 'Yen', 'low', 'times', 'are', 'hard', 'Crime', 'suicide', 'despair', 'have', 'taken', 'hold', 'Kimimaro', 'college', 'student', 'be', 'public', 'servant', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'rise', 'grip', 'poverty', 'One', 'day', 'strange', 'fellow', 'approaches', 'offer', 'Kimmaro', 'group', 'called', 'Financial', 'District', 'can', 'make', 'money', 'catch', 'order', 'make', 'profit', 'must', 'battle', 'other', 'members', 'partner', 'named', 'Masho', 'Masho', 'tenacious', 'young', 'girl', 'fight', 'Eventually', 'financial', 'phenomenon', 'called', 'C', 'destroy', 'Japanese', 'economy', 'once', 'are', 'few', 'members', 'Financial', 'District', 'think', 'can', 'gain', 'control', 'C', 'stop', 'collapse', 'Hense', 'series', 'title', 'C', 'Control', 'control', 'C', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'bright', 'Kimimaro', 'Masho', 'must', 'fight', 'rewrite', 'events', 'have', 'set', 'financial', 'crisis', 'motion.This', 'series', 'surprised', 'heck', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'gamble', 'pays', 'off', 'series', 'quite', 'profoundly', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'many', 'characters', 'series', 'are', 'developed', 'pretty', 'well', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'colorful', 'series', 'excellent', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'series', 'really', 'lot', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'races', 'along', 'very', 'fast', 'speed', 'easy', 'miss', 'something', 'miss', 'even', '1', 'episode', 'Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'C', 'Control', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'sequel', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'bit', 'redundant', 'great', 'concept', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'anime', 'will', 'be', 'continued', 'was', 'left', 'open', 'more', 'really', 'wanted', 'Anyway', 'anime', 'really', 'good', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anime', 'fan', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did']",N/A
