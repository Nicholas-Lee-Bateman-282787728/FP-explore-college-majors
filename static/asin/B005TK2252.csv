1503534,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005TK2252,A kids review,"[2, 2]","Having established herself as an actress of considerable talent, Vera Farmiga turned her sights on the director's chair last year and tackled a fairly weighty subject for her directorial debut. Higher Ground. Based on a memoir by Carolyn Briggs, Higher Ground also stars Farmiga as Corinne, a woman who enters a radical church upon getting married and pregnant at eighteen, only then to question her faith several years later as her marriage begins to fall apart. Like her Up in the Air co-star, George Clooney, it seems Farmiga's transition to behind-the-camera work was a successful one, as Higher Ground is a really good movie, it's a challenging first film with some strong performances, including, of course, Farmiga in the lead role. It's a quiet, thoughtful drama that touches on some philosophical dilemmas, so let that guide whether or not it's your type of Friday rental.",4,Higher Ground,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,881,"['Having', 'established', 'actress', 'considerable', 'talent', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'turned', 'sights', 'director', 'chair', 'last', 'year', 'tackled', 'fairly', 'weighty', 'subject', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'Based', 'memoir', 'Carolyn', 'Briggs', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'also', 'Farmiga', 'Corinne', 'woman', 'who', 'radical', 'church', 'getting', 'married', 'pregnant', 'eighteen', 'only', 'then', 'question', 'faith', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'marriage', 'fall', 'apart', 'Up', 'Air', 'co-star', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Farmiga', 'transition', 'behind-the-camera', 'work', 'was', 'successful', 'one', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'challenging', 'first', 'film', 'strong', 'performances', 'including', 'course', 'Farmiga', 'lead', 'role', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'drama', 'philosophical', 'dilemmas', 'so', 'let', 'guide', 'not', 'type', 'Friday', 'rental']",Higher Ground

I couldn't really feel the attraction the church had for our heroine. I also didn't buy her best friend as a real person; she was too perfect, gorgeous, and movie starish, and was married to a unappealing drippish guy [of course talking about the character, not a real life person or I wouldn't be so harsh].

It is the observations, the marriages that fall apart, the friendships giving way because of illness and disability, the kindness that is bestowed on one another, the flawed and fake caring, the genuine, tender moments between lovers and friends and parents and kids, and the subtle cruelty for the main character, which is the same in any community; silence the one who speaks up and questions authority and power.",5,A transcending movie experience.,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,944,"['one', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'review', 'amazingly', 'insightful', 'portrait', 'human', 'psyche', 'individual', 'versus', 'community', 'screenplay', 'rare', 'experience', 'disappointment', 'love', 'laughter', 'individual', 'community', 'kind', 'movie', 'should', 'win', 'Oscar', 'characters', 'display', 'tenderness', 'harshness', 'reality', 'so', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'shock', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'experience', 'this.This', 'not', 'faith', 'perse', 'religion', 'almost', 'role', 'movie', 'observations', 'marriages', 'fall', 'apart', 'friendships', 'giving', 'way', 'illness', 'disability', 'kindness', 'bestowed', 'one', 'flawed', 'fake', 'caring', 'genuine', 'tender', 'moments', 'lovers', 'friends', 'parents', 'kids', 'subtle', 'cruelty', 'main', 'character', 'same', 'community', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'questions', 'authority', 'power']",Higher Ground
1503539,A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y,B005TK2252,"Greg ""Saganite""","[33, 34]","Professional critics were fairly lukewarm toward this film, although even then, many acknowledged that elements within it are exceptional.  For one thing, it is very unusual to see a serious work that treats religion--and a rather fundamentalist form of Christianity at that--seriously and without insult, irony, or undue reverence.  Most films focusing on related topics either satirize people of faith (Saved!) or offer syrupy endorsements of faithFireproof).  Rarely is faith depicted as the mixed bag it often is.  While ""Higher Ground"" doesn't have the same scope and grandeur, in that one particular--treating faith seriously--it reminded me most ofThe Mission (Two-Disc Special Edition).I was surprised and delighted to see all of the five-star reviews already posted.  My concern is that many people would miss the uniqueness of this film and mistake it for either a hatchet job (because church life and serious spiritual commitments are depicted warts and all--it's not all smooth sailing for this male-dominated, anti-intellectual sect) or an endorsement of fundamentalism (because it's not all bad, either--the movie just assumes that faith provides comforts, joys, principles, and experiences that can have transcendent value for those who hold to it).Sexuality, which is often a hot topic for fundamentalists, is treated frankly and realistically, and consequently provides some of the movie's greatest moments of humor. C.S. Lewis wrote that Eros is a comic spirit, and ""Ground"" does not shy away from that aspect of life.  It also shows a complex and authentically rendered family life that includes alcoholism, divorce, temptation, and the rigors and amazement of parenting.  Too, it tackles illness and loss.  It's a complete package...a touching and meaning-filled drama that will stick with you and will likely provoke some reflection and discussion.From my own experience as a fundamentalist cut from a bolt of cloth not unlike the one featured in ""Ground,"" I can attest to its overall accuracy and authenticity.  I can also attest that, as with the main character, Corinne Walker, books, conversation, museums and personal independence can help lead one away from the less healthy, more smothering aspects of fundamentalism.  In my case, those things led me to question my faith altogether and to reconstruct my life without it, and I am better and more happy as a result.  We never see Corinne abandon her faith, but we don't see her giving up her quest for other, more expansive answers, either.I think ""Higher Ground"" will be enjoyable to anyone open to identifying with someone who might not be just as they are.  A fundamentalist watching it can perhaps gain a better appreciation for the kinds of things that might make that life seem stultifying to some people; and the skeptic or non-religious person might gain some sympathy for how faith provides a foundation for some people to cope better with life's existential trials.",5,A substantial work of sensitivity and excellence.,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,2953,"['Professional', 'critics', 'were', 'fairly', 'lukewarm', 'film', 'even', 'then', 'many', 'acknowledged', 'elements', 'are', 'exceptional', 'one', 'thing', 'very', 'unusual', 'see', 'serious', 'work', 'religion', 'rather', 'fundamentalist', 'form', 'Christianity', 'seriously', 'insult', 'irony', 'undue', 'reverence', 'Most', 'films', 'focusing', 'related', 'topics', 'satirize', 'people', 'faith', 'Saved', 'offer', 'syrupy', 'endorsements', 'faithFireproof', 'Rarely', 'faith', 'depicted', 'mixed', 'bag', 'often', 'Higher', 'Ground', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'scope', 'grandeur', 'one', 'particular', 'treating', 'faith', 'seriously', 'reminded', 'most', 'ofThe', 'Mission', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', '.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'see', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'already', 'posted', 'concern', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'miss', 'uniqueness', 'film', 'mistake', 'hatchet', 'job', 'church', 'life', 'serious', 'spiritual', 'commitments', 'are', 'depicted', 'warts', 'not', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'male-dominated', 'anti-intellectual', 'sect', 'endorsement', 'fundamentalism', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'faith', 'comforts', 'joys', 'principles', 'experiences', 'can', 'have', 'transcendent', 'value', 'who', 'hold', '.Sexuality', 'often', 'hot', 'topic', 'fundamentalists', 'treated', 'frankly', 'realistically', 'consequently', 'movie', 'greatest', 'moments', 'humor', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'wrote', 'Eros', 'comic', 'spirit', 'Ground', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'aspect', 'life', 'also', 'complex', 'authentically', 'rendered', 'family', 'life', 'alcoholism', 'divorce', 'temptation', 'rigors', 'amazement', 'parenting', 'Too', 'illness', 'loss', 'complete', 'package', 'touching', 'meaning-filled', 'drama', 'will', 'stick', 'will', 'likely', 'provoke', 'reflection', 'discussion.From', 'own', 'experience', 'fundamentalist', 'cut', 'bolt', 'cloth', 'not', 'one', 'featured', 'Ground', 'can', 'attest', 'overall', 'accuracy', 'authenticity', 'can', 'also', 'attest', 'that', 'main', 'character', 'Corinne', 'Walker', 'books', 'conversation', 'museums', 'personal', 'independence', 'can', 'help', 'lead', 'one', 'away', 'less', 'healthy', 'more', 'smothering', 'aspects', 'fundamentalism', 'case', 'things', 'led', 'question', 'faith', 'altogether', 'reconstruct', 'life', 'am', 'better', 'more', 'happy', 'result', 'never', 'see', 'Corinne', 'abandon', 'faith', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'giving', 'up', 'quest', 'other', 'more', 'expansive', 'answers', 'either.I', 'think', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'anyone', 'open', 'identifying', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'just', 'are', 'fundamentalist', 'watching', 'can', 'perhaps', 'gain', 'better', 'appreciation', 'kinds', 'things', 'might', 'make', 'life', 'seem', 'stultifying', 'people', 'skeptic', 'non-religious', 'person', 'might', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'how', 'faith', 'foundation', 'people', 'cope', 'better', 'life', 'existential', 'trials']",Higher Ground
1503540,A1XD4DB51KEJFP,B005TK2252,"Jay Linnstrom ""James II""","[1, 1]","My initial reaction was puzzlement.  I could not see who this movie would appeal to.  It had too much frank sexual content and exhibiting of worts among the faithful.  That would sadly shut out a big part of Christians.  Then it also had heavy religious content which may shut out most of secular audience!  So who would enjoy this movie?  Well, luckily, I LOVED it.  When the movie ended I was saying to myself, man, this movie is a masterpiece!  But how many people would see it to recognize it to be a great movie?  I am afraid that this movie is just not as accessible as  Robert Duvall's inspiring 'Apostle', another great Christian movie.First let me come out and say that I am a true believing Christian.  I am probably as 'religious' and 'Christian' as anyone out there.  That may be why I appreciate this movie so much.  However I must also add that this movie is quite challenging to Christians.  This movie is just not aimed to uplift and inspire fellow Christians.  This movie aims to present life as it is,  seen thru the artist's eye.  For that reason,  after seeing the movie,  I really appreciated the original title of this work  -  'This Dark World'.  But I guess such title would have limited this movie's target audience even more! LOL  But people should take heart.  We ARE perceiving only in parts, as through the glass darkly...I wish more Christians would watch a great movie like this rather than the usual 'let us inspire you and affirm your faith' type movies out there.  Yes, we may disagree with some church goers' behaviors in this movie and find them unacceptable.  ( For me, the counselor, 'prophet' was the most unacceptable figure in the whole movie. )But let me take a cue from this great movie and quote you a Bible verse to counteract 'the unacceptable':  ""Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.""  1Peter 4:8To God be the glory.",5,"A great movie, even a masterpiece.

1503541,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B005TK2252,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[4, 4]","All too often, movies focused on an individual's religious struggles have trite endings and pat resolutions. I won't give away the ending of Higher Ground except to say that the film's conclusion- like the entire movie - was neither simplistic nor predictable. The woman at the heart of this movie struggles to reconcile her inquisitive, questioning nature with demands that she  accept Jesus as the ultimate touchstone for her life. She finds the restrictions difficult to obey, including dress codes (or the pressure to follow certain codes) and deferring to men.She desperately yearns to believe and her yearning is poignant. At the same time, she  often feels out of place among those who never question their faith. She is buoyed up by one friend who shares her playfulness and even moments of daring but the friend also has a stronger commitment to her faith. There is  a pivotal moment concerning this friend but I won't reveal more about that. It is shocking and intense.What adds to the power of this film is its potential appeal  to people from many religous backgrounds, particularly those who can relate to the difficulty in finding a spiritual path. Themes that reoccur include the fervent desire to keep learniing, even if this means reading ""forbidden"" books, difficulty in accepting a husband's ultimate authority, pain when scolded by other women in the community for being uppity and out-spoken,etc.Also believable: discovering that the outside world has its own pitfalls, making it harder to find the right direction. Is it within the safety net of all she has known or somewhere else? Again, not simplistic, with fully fleshed out characters.  I am deducting one star for some events which aren't fully explained and seemed a bit baffling- at least to me.  I still highly recommend this movie. It could prompt deep reflection or at least raise interest in different types of Jesus-based worship and the varied lifestyles and communities of some believers.",4,Very honest and realistic look at one woman's struggles with faith,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,1975,"['too', 'often', 'movies', 'focused', 'individual', 'religious', 'struggles', 'have', 'trite', 'endings', 'pat', 'resolutions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'say', 'film', 'conclusion-', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'simplistic', 'predictable', 'woman', 'heart', 'movie', 'reconcile', 'inquisitive', 'questioning', 'nature', 'demands', 'accept', 'Jesus', 'ultimate', 'touchstone', 'life', 'restrictions', 'difficult', 'obey', 'including', 'dress', 'codes', 'pressure', 'follow', 'certain', 'codes', 'deferring', 'men.She', 'desperately', 'yearns', 'believe', 'yearning', 'poignant', 'same', 'time', 'often', 'place', 'who', 'never', 'question', 'faith', 'buoyed', 'up', 'one', 'friend', 'who', 'shares', 'playfulness', 'even', 'moments', 'daring', 'friend', 'also', 'stronger', 'commitment', 'faith', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'concerning', 'friend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'more', 'shocking', 'intense.What', 'power', 'film', 'potential', 'appeal', 'people', 'many', 'religous', 'backgrounds', 'particularly', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'spiritual', 'path', 'Themes', 'reoccur', 'include', 'fervent', 'desire', 'keep', 'learniing', 'even', 'reading', 'forbidden', 'books', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'husband', 'ultimate', 'authority', 'pain', 'when', 'scolded', 'other', 'women', 'community', 'being', 'uppity', 'out-spoken', 'etc.Also', 'believable', 'discovering', 'outside', 'world', 'own', 'pitfalls', 'making', 'harder', 'find', 'right', 'direction', 'safety', 'net', 'known', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Again', 'not', 'simplistic', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'am', 'deducting', 'one', 'star', 'events', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'explained', 'seemed', 'bit', 'baffling-', 'least', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'could', 'prompt', 'deep', 'reflection', 'least', 'raise', 'interest', 'different', 'types', 'Jesus-based', 'worship', 'varied', 'lifestyles', 'communities', 'believers']",Higher Ground

There's no imposed arc or resolution to the gentle moments of a woman's life shown here. We see her low-key movement toward, and then away from, religious attendance.Contrary to what the film's cover might lead one to believe, this is no indictment of another megalomaniacal cult leader. There are no bad guys here. This film does a remarkable job presenting a series of realistic, slice-of-life scenes. We feel as if we are eavesdropping in a woman's everyday kitchen, at her everyday church services.The producers also did a remarkable job finding actors to play the lead as a girl, then as a teen, then as a mature woman. For once, there does appear to be a continuity of features, unlike most films involving time progressions in which it's impossible to believe that child grew into an adult who would look like that.This whole film is absorbingly realistic and touching. As movie-goers, we might be used to more dramatic action, so it takes a while to calm down into the more reflective mood of this piece. For example, it was only when I viewed this movie through for the second time, that I caught the moving coincidence of the scene in which Corinne sits on her church steps, patting a stray dog who has temporarily attached itself to her.This isn't a chick-flick.

1503549,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B005TK2252,Sheryl Fechter,"[9, 9]","Vera Farmiga tackles yet another topic that could have been inflammatory although with her, it is not. Using an honesty and bravery which she is so easily capable of in this her directing debut.  She is looking at the subject of one woman's (Corrine Miller, also portrayed by Farmiga) faith and the eventual questioning about this through the vehicle of the 1970's Fundamentalist movement.  This portrait has a lovely soundtrack (Alec Puro) that brings this all to life and is definitely worth noting.  Farmiga directs without the condescending or mocking tone towards Christianity which is often present in films.  It has an intelligent broader appeal, to the believer and the nonbeliever alike.  It is a question of personal faith, not of righteousness through Christianity.The movie starts with Corrine's childhood in Vacation Bible School with the pastor, Bud (done wonderfully by Bill Irwin).  The picture quickly shifts to Corrine's teenage years. She is a writer and meets her future spouse, Ethan, who wants her to write for his rock band.  They eventually marry and a short while after their first daughter is born.  A heart-pounding tragedy then happens.  This leads the couple to their established adult family life in a fundamental church community.  Ethan Miller (Joshua Leonard) has given up the rock life and is an elder in the church. Corrine is a devoted and devout young wife and mother.  Add to the mix her best friend (Anika) whom Corrine is so close to. She adds light, color, and life to their friendship.  Nika is extremely devout herself as she is also playful and fun for Corrine.There are so many happenings throughout the fifteen year marriage, both in her church life and her personal life. Vera Farmiga handles this with a special skill and precision, which leads our protagonist to doubting and the questioning of her faith. Corrine begs God to help her to ""feel"" Him again.  At this point she says that she ""feels nothing"" when she ""used to be so full"".  One situation which occurs is the horrific happening to Nika and then to their relationship together.  I could literally feel the pain of it rip right through Corrine in a powerful reaction in their church.  I also saw the seeds of a huge loss grow ever deeper as it would send anyone reeling.  Nika is her confidante in life, her dearest friend, and the only one she goes to.Adding laughter of life with friends and family situations, there is some injected humor, although the piece itself is in no way a comedy. Humor is mainly brought into this story from the two friends which keeps their union fresh and close.  What they say or do may be frowned upon by the church although I saw it as anything any two very close` women would share.  This is another reason I find this movie so relevant, these two are friends in the truest form.  The ending is quite brilliant (without giving a thing away).  We simply see Corrine, who has gone through just about everything unexpected in the film, walking out into the bright sunshine on the street.  This leaves an open-ended conclusion and a conclusion for the viewer to decide. See this for its great storytelling and provocative theme.  Also see this for a lively discussion afterwards.  It was very helpful for me on a personal level and left me thinking on it for a long while that is until I purchased it.",5,Faith Is The Issue And How One Keeps It.

1503550,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005TK2252,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Vera Farmiga stars in and directs this new indie based on a memoir by Carolyn S. Briggs, who also co-wrote the screenplay. Set mainly in the 70s and 80s, Farmiga plays 'Corrine', who grows up in a household with a alcoholic father and ends up rebelling against her estranged parents by hooking up with a musician boyfriend who eventually gets her pregnant. A near tragic incident, where their newborn child almost drowns after the band's van falls into a creek, propels the young couple toward becoming members of a group of Christian Fundamentalists.""Higher Ground' then charts Corrine's commitment and eventual estrangement from the group. The sect is depicted not as a bunch of Charles Manson-like crazies but rather young, hippie types who attempt to cope with the modern world in often contradictory ways. Perhaps the best part of the film is in the depiction of how group members don't always fit into the stereotypical view as to how Fundamentalists are supposed to act. For example, the group does not shy away from dealing with the topic of the inability of some male members of the group who are unable to sexually satisfy their wives. The pastor ends up playing an explicit cassette tape, providing sexual instructions that will help the men perform better in bed. Despite the awkwardness of the get together, the Fundamentalists are at least not shown to be complete prudes.Corrine and husband Ethan also seem positively reasonable when they first allow Corrine's sister to stay with them but soon have to kick her out after they discover that she's been holding drugs at their house for a friend. On the downside, Corrine's community does everything they can to alienate her from her faith. Being a bit more intellectually inquisitive, she attempts to interpret some Biblical passages before the congregation in a more intellectually sophisticated way. She ends up being reprimanded by the pastor's wife, who insists that the women in the congregation ""know their place"" and not attempt to preach since that's a ""man's job"".There are other disturbing events that undermine Corrine's attraction to the group. After Corrine's best friend, Annika, is operated on for a brain tumor, she ends up as a virtual vegetable in a wheelchair. The group seems to be in denial about the tragedy and hide their feelings by insisting everything is alright because this was ""God's plan"". Later, when Corrine's marriage breaks down, she's brought to one of the group's marriage counselors, who admits that he cursed a local politician for committing adultery. Corrine seethes as the counselor interprets the politician's death in a car accident the next day, as retribution for his infidelity.Perhaps where 'Higher Ground' falls down the most is in it's lack of development of the principal characters. We really get to know next to nothing about Ethan, except that he loves his children and has a very bad temper. Do the films' scenarists ever show him at work, interacting with people in the work world? He's either completely demonic when he attempts to choke Corrine after she makes it clear she plans to leave him or still a loving father when he shows up at Corrine's family get together. Aside from the domestic histrionics, why not flesh the character out a bit more, as to some idiosyncrasies? The same goes for Corrine. It's actually Annika who has the more interesting personality (before the brain surgery) with her sexually-laced drawings and speaking in tongues. Since she spends almost all her time rebelling against her Congregation, there's little in getting to know Corrine as a flesh and blood human being. At film's end, Corrine has adopted a bit of a saintly persona and like Ethan, the feeling is that we don't get to know her as a completely drawn character portrait at all.Corrine makes it clear at film's end that while she still has respect for the Fundamentalists due to their strong faith, she cannot abide by their narrow-mindedness. I had a little trouble believing that the Congregation would actually let her speak in her final sermon as they had already barred her from speaking when she was part of the group.On the whole, 'Higher Ground' is a noble attempt to critique religious fundamentalism but doesn't quite come off as completely convincing drama or fully fleshed out character portraits.",3,Well-intentioned critique of Christian Fundamentalists flounders without completely fleshed out characters,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,4363,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Vera', 'Farmiga', 'stars', 'directs', 'new', 'indie', 'based', 'memoir', 'Carolyn', 'S.', 'Briggs', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Set', 'mainly', '70s', '80s', 'Farmiga', ""'Corrine"", 'who', 'up', 'household', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'up', 'rebelling', 'estranged', 'parents', 'hooking', 'up', 'musician', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'eventually', 'pregnant', 'near', 'tragic', 'incident', 'where', 'newborn', 'child', 'almost', 'drowns', 'band', 'van', 'creek', 'young', 'couple', 'becoming', 'members', 'group', 'Christian', 'Fundamentalists', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'then', 'Corrine', 'commitment', 'eventual', 'estrangement', 'group', 'sect', 'depicted', 'not', 'bunch', 'Charles', 'Manson-like', 'crazies', 'rather', 'young', 'hippie', 'types', 'who', 'attempt', 'cope', 'modern', 'world', 'often', 'contradictory', 'ways', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'depiction', 'how', 'group', 'members', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'fit', 'stereotypical', 'view', 'how', 'Fundamentalists', 'are', 'supposed', 'act', 'example', 'group', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'dealing', 'topic', 'inability', 'male', 'members', 'group', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'sexually', 'satisfy', 'wives', 'pastor', 'up', 'playing', 'explicit', 'cassette', 'tape', 'providing', 'sexual', 'instructions', 'will', 'help', 'men', 'perform', 'better', 'bed', 'awkwardness', 'get', 'together', 'Fundamentalists', 'are', 'least', 'not', 'shown', 'be', 'complete', 'prudes.Corrine', 'husband', 'Ethan', 'also', 'seem', 'positively', 'reasonable', 'when', 'first', 'allow', 'Corrine', 'sister', 'stay', 'soon', 'have', 'kick', 'out', 'discover', 'been', 'holding', 'drugs', 'house', 'friend', 'downside', 'Corrine', 'community', 'everything', 'can', 'alienate', 'faith', 'Being', 'bit', 'more', 'intellectually', 'inquisitive', 'interpret', 'Biblical', 'passages', 'congregation', 'more', 'intellectually', 'sophisticated', 'way', 'up', 'being', 'reprimanded', 'pastor', 'wife', 'who', 'women', 'congregation', 'know', 'place', 'not', 'attempt', 'preach', 'man', 'job', 'are', 'other', 'disturbing', 'events', 'undermine', 'Corrine', 'attraction', 'group', 'Corrine', 'best', 'friend', 'Annika', 'operated', 'brain', 'tumor', 'up', 'virtual', 'vegetable', 'wheelchair', 'group', 'be', 'denial', 'tragedy', 'hide', 'feelings', 'insisting', 'everything', 'alright', 'was', 'God', 'plan', 'Later', 'when', 'Corrine', 'marriage', 'breaks', 'down', 'brought', 'one', 'group', 'marriage', 'counselors', 'who', 'cursed', 'local', 'politician', 'committing', 'adultery', 'Corrine', 'counselor', 'politician', 'death', 'car', 'accident', 'next', 'day', 'retribution', 'infidelity.Perhaps', 'where', ""'Higher"", 'Ground', 'falls', 'down', 'most', 'lack', 'development', 'principal', 'characters', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'Ethan', 'children', 'very', 'bad', 'temper', 'Do', 'films', 'scenarists', 'ever', 'show', 'work', 'interacting', 'people', 'work', 'world', 'completely', 'demonic', 'when', 'choke', 'Corrine', 'clear', 'leave', 'still', 'loving', 'father', 'when', 'up', 'Corrine', 'family', 'get', 'together', 'Aside', 'domestic', 'histrionics', 'why', 'not', 'flesh', 'character', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'idiosyncrasies', 'same', 'Corrine', 'actually', 'Annika', 'who', 'more', 'interesting', 'personality', 'brain', 'surgery', 'sexually-laced', 'drawings', 'speaking', 'tongues', 'almost', 'time', 'rebelling', 'Congregation', 'little', 'getting', 'know', 'Corrine', 'flesh', 'blood', 'human', 'being', 'film', 'end', 'Corrine', 'adopted', 'bit', 'saintly', 'persona', 'Ethan', 'feeling', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'completely', 'drawn', 'character', 'portrait', 'all.Corrine', 'clear', 'film', 'end', 'still', 'respect', 'Fundamentalists', 'due', 'strong', 'faith', 'can', 'not', 'abide', 'narrow-mindedness', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'believing', 'Congregation', 'would', 'actually', 'let', 'speak', 'final', 'sermon', 'had', 'already', 'barred', 'speaking', 'when', 'was', 'part', 'group.On', 'whole', 'Ground', 'noble', 'attempt', 'critique', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'off', 'completely', 'convincing', 'drama', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'portraits']",Higher Ground
