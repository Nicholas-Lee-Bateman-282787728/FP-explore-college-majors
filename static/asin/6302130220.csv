I found this dramatization of the story by some of my favorite actors to be intriguing.Morey Bernstein (Louis Hayward) in introduced to stage hypnosis at a party where his friend Dr. Deering (Richard Anderson) makes a snide remark saying that Morey is not the type of person that can be hypnotized. So Morey takes up the challenge and soon gets enamored with the mechanics. He practices on his wife and the mirror.Then a friend tells him about Edgar Cayce. Now Morey go off on a regression tangent using his neighbors wife, Ruth (Teresa Wright.) There he meets Bridey Murphy from 19th Century Cork in Ireland. It gets touch and go as to if Ruth will ever come back or be Bridey forever.I can relate to this movie as I practice a bit and even learned how to hypnotize the unhypnotizable by using different methods. In one of my classes I was to be the guinea pig for regression, worked pretty well for this life. When we went to do previous lives I figured I had to be someone important naturally.  So we went at it with somber faces. I ended up naked on a rock naming animals.Here is a fun movie that has regression as a theme.Midsomer Murders: Death in Disguise (1999 TV episode)May Cuttle (Judy Cornwell) is regressed to Gaius Quintus a food taster for a Roman general.",5,You are getting sleepy - you will buy this movie,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,1328,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'Bridey', 'Murphy', 'case', 'found', 'dramatization', 'story', 'favorite', 'actors', 'be', 'intriguing.Morey', 'Bernstein', 'Louis', 'Hayward', 'introduced', 'stage', 'hypnosis', 'party', 'where', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Deering', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'snide', 'remark', 'saying', 'Morey', 'not', 'type', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'hypnotized', 'So', 'Morey', 'up', 'challenge', 'soon', 'enamored', 'mechanics', 'practices', 'wife', 'mirror.Then', 'friend', 'Edgar', 'Cayce', 'Now', 'Morey', 'go', 'off', 'regression', 'tangent', 'using', 'neighbors', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'Bridey', 'Murphy', '19th', 'Century', 'Cork', 'Ireland', 'touch', 'go', 'Ruth', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'back', 'be', 'Bridey', 'forever.I', 'can', 'relate', 'movie', 'practice', 'bit', 'even', 'learned', 'how', 'hypnotize', 'unhypnotizable', 'using', 'different', 'methods', 'one', 'classes', 'was', 'be', 'guinea', 'pig', 'regression', 'worked', 'pretty', 'well', 'life', 'When', 'went', 'do', 'previous', 'lives', 'figured', 'had', 'be', 'someone', 'important', 'naturally', 'went', 'somber', 'ended', 'up', 'naked', 'rock', 'naming', 'animals.Here', 'fun', 'movie', 'regression', 'theme.Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Death', 'Disguise', '1999', 'TV', 'episode', 'May', 'Cuttle', 'Judy', 'Cornwell', 'regressed', 'Gaius', 'Quintus', 'food', 'taster', 'Roman', 'general']",N/A

He doesn't bother with the woman she is but the past life in her, Bridey Murphy who lived in 1800's Ireland. The beautiful Nancy Gates plays his wife who at times believes his interest in Bridey Murphy is more than a medical interest. The movie goes through the complete life of Bridey Murphy including how she reincarnates herself into the woman at the present day.The movie in the beginning tells us that the past lives you've had effect what will happen in your next ones, in other words karma. I kept waiting for the movie to show us this.

Based on the best selling book of the same name, it made sense to me then and I have believed in reincarnation ever since.  The end talks more about hypnotism than reincarnation but if you believe in it then no explanation is necessary.  If you don't believe in reincarnation then no explanation is possible.This is pretty much what most people who have had past lives regressions have experienced, a past life that is unexplainable to non believers.  There's no sense in trying to convince anyone of it.  You have to experience it yourself.  There's a saying, ""I won't believe it unless I see it.""

It also has a good cast, including Teresa Wright and Louis Hayward.Morey Bernstein became fascinated with hypnotism after seeing a woman hypnotized at a party. He did his homework and began practicing on his wife, but finding her a dull subject, he asked his neighbor's wife to volunteer. She did so willingly, but she was no dull subject. Ruth Simmons recalled her childhood easily, but soon moved past that into a former life, that of Bridey Murphy. Bridey lived in Ireland in the early 1800s and died in her 60s. She recounted her childhood, her marriage, and her death, including events after her death. But Bridey showed signs of being ill which seemed to be transferred to Ruth, and the project seemed in need of abandonment.All of Ruth/Bridey's dialogue comes directly from recordings made during real hypnotism sessions created by the real Bernstein in his experiments. Transcripts can be found in Bernstein's book of the same name, and they're astonishing.The reason this film is given 4 stars and not 5 is because of the ending. It drops off immediately and leaves the viewer with many questions, not just about Bridey's case but about Morey's, whether Ruth was hypnotized again, whether she got sick afterward, and whether Morey continued his hypnotism. Luckily, as this is based on a real case, there are ways to find out, but it would have been more satisfying if the movie answered these questions.Unfortunately, this film is only currently available on VHS so it is difficult to find.",4,"Fascinating, Ruined by a quick ending",1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,1600,"['Search', 'Bridey', 'Murphy', 'fascinating', 'true', 'story', 'alone', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'also', 'good', 'cast', 'including', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'Louis', 'Hayward.Morey', 'Bernstein', 'became', 'fascinated', 'hypnotism', 'seeing', 'woman', 'hypnotized', 'party', 'did', 'homework', 'began', 'practicing', 'wife', 'finding', 'dull', 'subject', 'asked', 'neighbor', 'wife', 'volunteer', 'did', 'so', 'willingly', 'was', 'dull', 'subject', 'Ruth', 'Simmons', 'recalled', 'childhood', 'easily', 'soon', 'moved', 'past', 'former', 'life', 'Bridey', 'Murphy', 'Bridey', 'lived', 'Ireland', 'early', '1800s', 'died', '60s', 'recounted', 'childhood', 'marriage', 'death', 'including', 'events', 'death', 'Bridey', 'showed', 'signs', 'being', 'ill', 'seemed', 'be', 'transferred', 'Ruth', 'project', 'seemed', 'need', 'abandonment.All', 'Ruth/Bridey', 'dialogue', 'directly', 'recordings', 'made', 'real', 'hypnotism', 'sessions', 'created', 'real', 'Bernstein', 'experiments', 'Transcripts', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Bernstein', 'book', 'same', 'name', ""'re"", 'astonishing.The', 'reason', 'film', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5', 'ending', 'immediately', 'viewer', 'many', 'questions', 'not', 'just', 'Bridey', 'case', 'Morey', 'Ruth', 'was', 'hypnotized', 'again', 'got', 'sick', 'afterward', 'Morey', 'continued', 'hypnotism', 'Luckily', 'based', 'real', 'case', 'are', 'ways', 'find', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'answered', 'questions.Unfortunately', 'film', 'only', 'currently', 'available', 'VHS', 'difficult', 'find']",N/A
