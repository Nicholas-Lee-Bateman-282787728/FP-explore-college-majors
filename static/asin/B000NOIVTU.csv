The women who plays Tia was very capable. I am not about to give away the story here (how refreshing!) I will say that Jamie Luner is bad-ass. One can almost sympathize with her character here and there, which makes the movie far more interesting than being just a ""she's an evil creature who gets off killing people for cash"" flick. Not to mention, Luner is hot...really hot. So, if you are a Luner fan, or haven't heard of her and want to learn of a red hot redhead with one of the sultriest voices out there, check this out. Yes, it's a Lifetime movie, but it transcends that genre.

She decides to murder her husband for the quarter million dollar insurance money and share it with her lover. She therefore enlists Brent's help in disposing of her husband. However, when the money runs out and Brent has other affairs, Jamie moves away, changes her name and marries wealthy Richard Danforth (William R. Moses), son of aging tycoon Donald Danforth (Lawrence Dane). Annie has now become Marianne and is reasonably settled. But Richter shows up again, also under an alias, and blackmails Marianne. Now Richard's devoted secretary Carrie's Hollings (Lisa Langlois)starts to become suspicious when she has to pay Marianne's parking tickets from a seedy part of town. She investigates and finds Marianne and Richter together - but is spotted by Marianne. Marianne gets Richter to murder her. Because of her vulnerability now, she decides she needs to be rid of him too and uses the same method as she used for her first husband - a lethal injection. She is getting quite practiced now and decides father-in-law Donald needs to go too so that Richard can control the company. Now another of Richard's employees, Tia Montgomery (Sophie Gendron) gets suspicious about both Marianne's behavior and Carrie's and Donald's deaths and she starts investigating, enlisting the help of her sisterKendra.

Teslovich,"[3, 3]","If you're thinking of watching this, belated for a reason DVD release of a 2006 movie, based on the cover then just look at the cover because there's nothing in the movie like it. The scariest scenes are of a few seconds of seeing someone getting an injection and then feigning a heart attack. You'll get a greater thrill from just going to the hospital for an injection of saline (salt water) solution. The movie's writer must never have heard of forensics; needle marks; position of the body; security cameras, autopsies; weird coincidences and patterns and background checks, etc. A California divorce court would be a safer way to gain financial independence.

NO woman was batterd in this movie. This film is about a woman who is married for the second time around, and to a nice wealthy older man. She seems to have everything she ever wanted. But had a nasty little habbit of going about and jabbing deadly needles into people. This would always happen when she found a person annoying. And there were a few of them  who got on her nerves too. This was her own little way of getting rid of those people quickly.
