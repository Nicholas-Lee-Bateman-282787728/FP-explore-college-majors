This movie came on the heels of Kill Me Again, Red Rock West and The Last Seduction.....all of them very entertaining films.This would be best for the first-time viewer, but I still have enjoyed it the three times I've seen it. One thing unusual: Linda Fiorentino actually plays a nice lady! Ray Liotta, Peter Coyote, Christopher McDonald and David Paymer all provide good male performances with Liotta playing the central character.Be warned that this story is a bit unbelievable.

While this movie has its share of flaws and the ending is a little weak, it still was a fun ride for me. Out of the many thrillers out there, this isn't in the top bunch to see at all but it definitely is up there for originality. Now, I'm not going to get into if it was realistic or not because I don't even know but as for the movie, it's a good thriller worth a rent.The movie's about a doctor whose wife is murdered. Following this event, he is suspected of murder, relieved of his charges, loses his children to his step sister but that's not even the worst...the killer isn't found. This doctor is very troubled by this until he meets a promissing doctor working on a drug that could allow one to use the blood of a dead individual to see what they saw. Guess what. He uses it to see what his wife saw and figure out who killed his wife.The movie does has some problems but is a good rental and the flashback scenes are well made.

695267,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B000063JDO,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Director John Dahl has been in the world of television the past decade - and movie audiences have been the much poorer for it. Not surprisingly, I'm a fan of many tv series in his resum&eacute;. This is only one of a handful of feature films he helmed and 'Unforgettable' makes for a well-paced, engaging and taut thriller.In this production Ray Liotta plays Dr. David Krane, chief medical examiner for Seattle. He's a man haunted by many ghosts, but one in particular has been his bloody albatross - he was once suspected of murdering his wife.In fact, many of his colleagues and other law enforcement personnel still believe it. His murder trial ended due to a rookie cop mistake, a legal loophole voided his indictment and he walked away on a technically. But since he wasn't exonerated, even the civil courts believe he's actually guilty - his children have been taken from him and legal custody given to his wife's sister as their permanent guardian.So he lives his life under the constant unyielding shadow of doubt, forced to ignore whispered comments and sideway stares.Until one day he goes to a medical fundraiser where a researcher, Fiorentino's character Dr. Martha Briggs, is investigating the idea of memory transference. Her research suggests that extremely intense memories are captured and carried throughout a person's life, held in dormant state, ready for a biochemical jolt  - and that such memories can be transferred to another biologically compatible individual. Almost everyone at the party listens with polite glassy eyed stares, but not David. He's utterly fascinated. Why? Because he knows that his wife's spinal cord fluid still exists, and in that residual evidence might reveal the identity of the real murderer.But what begins as a search for justice and redemption suddenly spirals out of control as David realizes that there was, and still is, much more to his wife's murder than a random act of violence. And can he deal with what truly happened that rain-soaked night as he lay passed out drunk not thirty feet from her body?In addition to the clever story, what makes this such a good film is the surprising strong chemistry between the film's stars, Ray Liotta and Linda Fiorentino. Better than one would expect given their respective personalities. Again, you sense the hand of Director Dahl finding and revealing in his players the excellence of their skills. What so many directors lack: The ability to craft and work with the talent; to bring out the very best out of the actors and blend their collective talents, creating something new and unexpected.To me, that's one of the definitions of a great director.Admittedly, it's filled with well-trod and cliche'-ridden caricatures making up the supporting cast  - the cigar chomping cops, the moustached loudmouth brute who is really a nice guy, the snide food-munching associate medical examiner, etc. But that's a minor complaint in a much larger and enjoyable production.I love that there's more than a few solid red herrings and multiple believable suspects to choose from, allowing for a perfectly measured blend of mystery and mayhem. Making even a seasoned movie fan second-guess the identity of the true murderer and the real reason behind his wife's death.",4,Taut Intense Thriller,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,3256,"['Director', 'John', 'Dahl', 'been', 'world', 'television', 'past', 'decade', 'movie', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'poorer', 'Not', 'surprisingly', ""'m"", 'fan', 'many', 'tv', 'series', 'resum', 'eacute', 'only', 'one', 'handful', 'feature', 'films', 'helmed', ""'Unforgettable"", 'well-paced', 'engaging', 'taut', 'thriller.In', 'production', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Krane', 'chief', 'medical', 'examiner', 'Seattle', 'man', 'haunted', 'many', 'ghosts', 'one', 'particular', 'been', 'bloody', 'was', 'once', 'suspected', 'murdering', 'wife.In', 'fact', 'many', 'colleagues', 'other', 'law', 'enforcement', 'personnel', 'still', 'believe', 'murder', 'trial', 'ended', 'due', 'rookie', 'cop', 'mistake', 'legal', 'loophole', 'voided', 'indictment', 'walked', 'away', 'technically', 'was', ""n't"", 'exonerated', 'even', 'civil', 'courts', 'believe', 'actually', 'guilty', 'children', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'legal', 'custody', 'given', 'wife', 'sister', 'permanent', 'guardian.So', 'life', 'constant', 'unyielding', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'forced', 'ignore', 'whispered', 'comments', 'sideway', 'stares.Until', 'one', 'day', 'medical', 'fundraiser', 'where', 'researcher', 'Fiorentino', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Martha', 'Briggs', 'investigating', 'idea', 'memory', 'transference', 'research', 'extremely', 'intense', 'memories', 'are', 'captured', 'carried', 'person', 'life', 'held', 'dormant', 'state', 'ready', 'biochemical', 'jolt', 'such', 'memories', 'can', 'be', 'transferred', 'biologically', 'compatible', 'individual', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'party', 'polite', 'glassy', 'eyed', 'stares', 'not', 'David', 'utterly', 'fascinated', 'Why', 'wife', 'spinal', 'cord', 'fluid', 'still', 'residual', 'evidence', 'might', 'reveal', 'identity', 'real', 'murderer.But', 'what', 'search', 'justice', 'redemption', 'suddenly', 'control', 'David', 'was', 'still', 'much', 'more', 'wife', 'murder', 'random', 'act', 'violence', 'can', 'deal', 'what', 'truly', 'happened', 'rain-soaked', 'night', 'lay', 'passed', 'out', 'drunk', 'not', 'thirty', 'feet', 'body', 'addition', 'clever', 'story', 'what', 'such', 'good', 'film', 'surprising', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'film', 'stars', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Better', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'given', 'respective', 'personalities', 'Again', 'sense', 'hand', 'Director', 'Dahl', 'finding', 'revealing', 'players', 'excellence', 'skills', 'What', 'so', 'many', 'directors', 'lack', 'ability', 'craft', 'work', 'talent', 'bring', 'out', 'very', 'best', 'actors', 'blend', 'collective', 'talents', 'creating', 'something', 'new', 'unexpected.To', 'one', 'definitions', 'great', 'director.Admittedly', 'filled', 'well-trod', ""cliche'-ridden"", 'caricatures', 'making', 'up', 'supporting', 'cast', 'cigar', 'chomping', 'cops', 'moustached', 'loudmouth', 'brute', 'who', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'snide', 'food-munching', 'associate', 'medical', 'examiner', 'etc', 'minor', 'complaint', 'much', 'larger', 'enjoyable', 'production.I', 'love', 'more', 'few', 'solid', 'red', 'herrings', 'multiple', 'believable', 'suspects', 'choose', 'allowing', 'perfectly', 'measured', 'blend', 'mystery', 'mayhem', 'Making', 'even', 'seasoned', 'movie', 'fan', 'second-guess', 'identity', 'true', 'murderer', 'real', 'reason', 'wife', 'death']",N/A

Ray Liotta, one of our most underappreciated actors, stars as a medical examiner who was cleared of murdering his wife by a technicality.  In investigating a horrifying killing spree at a pharmacy, Ray thinks the killer is the same one who murdered his wife.  He goes out on a date and meets Linda Fiorentino (quite good in a laconic way), who has developed a serum which allows memory transfer between rats.  But, it is dangerous, and has not been tried on humans.  Liotta is so empassioned with finding his wife's murderer, he steals the drug and uses it, and it does work, but without damage to his heart.  From heron, Liotta finds out that Kim Coates (as a seedy drug dealer) is the one who did the pharmacy killing, and in flashbacks, he sees Coates attacking his wife.  But, is he the true culprit?  Many surprising plot twists evolve, and it is a great film.  Featured are Peter Coyote, as Liotta's friend, a police detective; ""Sex and the City's"" Kim Cattrall has a small role as Liotta's sister in law who has custody of his girls; David Paymer plays Liotta's friend and partner; and Christopher McDonald is a seedy, sleazy cop who thinks Liotta did kill the wife.John Dahl directs with assuredness and the rainy Seattle setting is perfect.An unknown gem.",5,MEMORABLE,1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,1449,"['Once', 'get', 'implausibility', 'plot', 'mainly', 'drug', 'culled', 'Cerebral', 'spinal', 'fluid', 'could', 'do', 'what', 'occurs', 'movie', 'have', 'nervewrackingly', 'good', 'thriller', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'actors', 'stars', 'medical', 'examiner', 'who', 'was', 'cleared', 'murdering', 'wife', 'technicality', 'investigating', 'horrifying', 'killing', 'spree', 'pharmacy', 'Ray', 'killer', 'same', 'one', 'who', 'murdered', 'wife', 'out', 'date', 'meets', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'quite', 'good', 'laconic', 'way', 'who', 'developed', 'serum', 'memory', 'transfer', 'rats', 'dangerous', 'not', 'been', 'tried', 'humans', 'Liotta', 'so', 'empassioned', 'finding', 'wife', 'murderer', 'drug', 'work', 'damage', 'heart', 'heron', 'Liotta', 'out', 'Kim', 'Coates', 'seedy', 'drug', 'dealer', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'pharmacy', 'killing', 'flashbacks', 'Coates', 'attacking', 'wife', 'true', 'culprit', 'Many', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'evolve', 'great', 'film', 'Featured', 'are', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'Liotta', 'friend', 'police', 'detective', 'Sex', 'City', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'small', 'role', 'Liotta', 'sister', 'law', 'who', 'custody', 'girls', 'David', 'Paymer', 'Liotta', 'friend', 'partner', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'seedy', 'sleazy', 'cop', 'who', 'Liotta', 'did', 'kill', 'wife.John', 'Dahl', 'assuredness', 'rainy', 'Seattle', 'setting', 'perfect.An', 'unknown', 'gem']",N/A

The movie sounded interesting to me and it turns out that it is a good science fiction film. Liotta  overhears a research scientists describing a new formula that can act on the brain preserving it's present genetic pattern allowing it to be jump started even if the person or other animal had been killed. Liotta, being a coroner has access to his dead wife's DNA from brain tissue. He is so  obsessed  in finding his wife's killer that he takes that it will work despite the health risks to the heart. Liotta has a lot on his plate from the get go. People still believe he killed his wife including his sister-in-law who has custody of his girls, played by Cattrall. Even the Researcher(Fiorentino) is afraid of him when he first comes to talk to her. But, the drug becomes promising and helps bag a criminal that shot four innocent people in a robbery. Liotta keeps using the drug though though  ignoring the  dangerous side effect.. Puts him in the hospital.The movie has a lot of quick shots as seen by Liotta while drugged and you find yourself looking closely trying to see who just might be the bad guy or girl and weeding out what's significant and what is not.
