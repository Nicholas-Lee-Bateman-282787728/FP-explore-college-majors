No, not just cool but REALLY COOL comedy about black guy who took part in some experiment which upgraded his senses. Kind of super-power. A lot of funny (REALLY FUNNY) situations, dumb, but great jokes etc. etc. Cool movie. I hadn't laughed in such a way for a long time.But then... Oops! The movie became less funny, some kind of soap appeared there, the authors seemed to remember about correctness and that's why the ending wasn't as cool and funny as beginning.I'm so sorry.
