798249,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B0001AVZBW,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 1]","Given that this movie stars the three accomplished western actors James Garner, Dennis Weaver and Claude Akins, you would think that it would be a movie that would present a lot of exciting western action. That is unfortunately not the case, the action seems strained and the acting is not crisp and engaging.James Garner plays a man called Sledge and with his friend Mallory is planning on stealing some gold. However, when Sledge is preoccupied with his woman friend Mallory gets killed over a card game. Sledge goes back to his gang of outlaws and he brings an old man with him. The old man spent time in a prison next to a vault that contained large gold shipments and this gives Sledge the idea to steal the gold. Their first thought is of stealing it while in transit but that is clearly not reasonable as it is guarded by a large number of crack army cavalry troopers.Their next idea is to steal the gold while it is in the prison and they concoct a plan to do so. Although they are successful they immediately run into problems and after a series of gun battles Sledge rides away penniless.While it is clear that this movie just fails to be exciting, it is hard to pinpoint exactly why. The best example is the scene where the gang is playing poker, it goes on far too long and there is no believable tension in the faces of the men as they are gambling away all of their money. Even the climactic confrontation never rises to a level of tension where you are engrossed in the action.",2,A movie that just fails to excite,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,1492,"['Given', 'movie', 'three', 'accomplished', 'western', 'actors', 'James', 'Garner', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'present', 'lot', 'exciting', 'western', 'action', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'action', 'strained', 'acting', 'not', 'crisp', 'engaging.James', 'Garner', 'man', 'called', 'Sledge', 'friend', 'Mallory', 'planning', 'stealing', 'gold', 'However', 'when', 'Sledge', 'preoccupied', 'woman', 'friend', 'Mallory', 'killed', 'over', 'card', 'game', 'Sledge', 'back', 'gang', 'outlaws', 'old', 'man', 'old', 'man', 'spent', 'time', 'prison', 'next', 'vault', 'contained', 'large', 'gold', 'shipments', 'Sledge', 'idea', 'steal', 'gold', 'first', 'thought', 'stealing', 'transit', 'clearly', 'not', 'reasonable', 'guarded', 'large', 'number', 'crack', 'army', 'cavalry', 'troopers.Their', 'next', 'idea', 'steal', 'gold', 'prison', 'concoct', 'plan', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'successful', 'immediately', 'run', 'problems', 'series', 'gun', 'battles', 'Sledge', 'away', 'penniless.While', 'clear', 'movie', 'just', 'be', 'exciting', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'exactly', 'why', 'best', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'gang', 'playing', 'poker', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'believable', 'tension', 'men', 'are', 'gambling', 'away', 'money', 'Even', 'climactic', 'confrontation', 'never', 'level', 'tension', 'where', 'are', 'engrossed', 'action']",N/A

In his all-too-human book, Mr. Garner comes off as mean, petty, and highly partisan. As successful as he has been over the decades, Mr. Garner just never seemed to rise above his inner demons--but that's for another day, another discussion. To be honest, for this movie review--and for any other Garner-related reviews I may write--there is the taint of the actor being a big, personal disappointment. Well, 'to err is human and to forgive is divine', so I forgive Mr. Garner's feet of clay. And while he may be ornery in life, on the screen he will always shine. So, with that said, Garner is a genuine S.O.B.--the very same S.O.B. that the 1970 movie poster advertised about re: its gunslinger namesake. Yep, Sledge is a mean mother and Garner played it well, even with all the annoying, distracting post-production dubbing and sound effects that are the black marks against this and all spaghetti westerns. Of course,""Sledge"" is still a fun, dynamic movie, but it's far from being in my 'top 10' list of best westerns. When you get right down to it, this western has no characters that I  like or care about; even the arid European (Almeria, Spain?) setting is at best dreary and unlike the beautiful, colorful American West it is trying so hard to evoke. ""Sledge"" was directed by the late actor Vic Morrow of ""Combat"" T.V. fame, an hard-working artist much like Mr. Garner. Sadly, Morrow was killed nearly 13 years after he directed ""Sledge""; he died during a freak helicopter accident while performing in a highly forgettable film based on Rod Serling's classic ""Twilight Zone"" television series.

I have an extensive video collection of them, plus a very large library of books based on them.  What does that mean?  Nothing except I know my Italian wessterns.  SLEDGE is an American film company trying to cash in on the Italian western craze.  This wasn't new back then, Eastwood came back to America and made Hang'em High and Burt Lnadcaster's Lawman was made here too all of which were copies of the Italian formula.  SLEDGE tried to go one step further and go to Europe and made an authenic Italian western by Americans.  If that doesn't make much sense then you now know the problem with this movie.  It is too much of a downer even for Italians who loved the down beat plots such as The Great Silence.  Vic Marrow the tv actor and first/only time director knows his Italian westerns but his heavy handed scenes put off the viewer.  Garner is totally unlikeable here.  The hero of an Italian western could be a bad as_, but they usually had  some quirk that balanced out their personality so that the viewer liked them.  Not here you never like Garner and that is hard to do with a TV western icon such as him.  The very depressing ending of this movie leaves a bitter taste in your mouth.  The Great Silence is known for its tragic and very gut wrenching ending but it has a style of sadness that SLEDGE never gets.  As for the music, again it is copy of Italian soundtracks that does quite fit.  Maybe that is what it the main problem is the elements of this western don't fit well together.  Sometimes when you copy of a painting or drawing the images aren't quite right and the least bit of incorrection stands out and mars the picture.

In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960's-70's television series like ""The Rat Patrol"" is a bigger cast and a lot more violence.James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing (""Maverick"", ""Support Your Local Sheriff""-""Gunfighter"" etc.). Unfortunately his earthy likability works against him, as Sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western anti-hero. But Eastwood's stuff was not this flat and uninteresting.I suppose that ""A Man Called Sledge"" could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub-genre. Fans of the slow-paced ""Combat"" television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some then trendy slow-mo shots and cross-dissolves, which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story-telling purpose.The plot is the standard ""big heist"" thing (insert ""The War Wagon"" here) with Sledge plotting how to heist a $300,000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of ""Alias Smith and Jones"" with the same plot.The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer's interest.The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game, gambling away their shares of the loot to  provide some lame reason to extend the story.Then again, what do I know?

The trouble is - how do you rob a gold wagon when it's either locked up in a state prison or is being escorted by forty professionally trained sharpshooters?  James Garner plays the title character in A MAN CALLED SLEDGE, a kind of good spaghetti western/big heist hybrid that was written and co-directed by actor Vic Morrow.The movie treats us to an extended introduction to Sledge before bothering to get to the plot proper.  Luther Sledge is the grimmest western character I've seen Garner play, and his foray to the dark side had me worried for a while.  Sledge has none of the easy charm of Bret Maverick, or either lead character in Garner's ""Support Your Local..."" movies.  Garner is second only to Cary Grant in his ability to charm his way through a movie.  It's that ability - and Jack Elam - that make the ""Support Your Local..."" movies so much fun.  Even cast against type Garner, though, is the best thing about this movie.If everything in this movie were as good as Garner this one would be a classic.  The wide-screen desert location photography, if not quite a feast for the eyes, is certainly a hearty snack.  Co-stars Dennis Weaver and Claude Akins were veteran character actors who'd proven in the past they could work up to the material. Unfortunately their characters are underwritten, making of them something less than clich&eacute;s. The character underwritten to practical invisibility belongs to poor Laura Antonelli, who plays Sledge's love interest.  Although their love plays an increasingly important role in the plot, she isn't in the film for more that a couple of brief scenes.  Not nearly long enough to sell us on their love, or to care all that much when it's jeopardized.  Continuity is another issue that plagues this movie.  Some of the action sequences are simply confusing.  For instance, at one point in the movie one of the main characters is in trouble.  We see the source of that trouble, hear a scream, and then see the injured character tumbling to the ground.  But we never see what happened!  Whenever it was sloppy editing, not enough second unit film available, or a planned and purposeful exclusion, it doesn't help the movie at all.  A tepid endorsement for this one.  The story's intriguing, the acting is strong, and it looks pretty.",3,The curse of other men's gold,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,2387,"['cache', 'gold', 'stored', 'prison', 'notorious', 'outlaw', 'Luther', 'Sledge', 'trouble', 'how', 'do', 'rob', 'gold', 'wagon', 'when', 'locked', 'up', 'state', 'prison', 'being', 'escorted', 'forty', 'professionally', 'trained', 'sharpshooters', 'James', 'Garner', 'title', 'character', 'MAN', 'CALLED', 'SLEDGE', 'kind', 'good', 'spaghetti', 'western/big', 'heist', 'hybrid', 'was', 'written', 'co-directed', 'actor', 'Vic', 'Morrow.The', 'movie', 'extended', 'introduction', 'Sledge', 'bothering', 'get', 'plot', 'proper', 'Luther', 'Sledge', 'grimmest', 'western', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Garner', 'play', 'foray', 'dark', 'side', 'had', 'worried', 'while', 'Sledge', 'none', 'easy', 'charm', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'lead', 'character', 'Garner', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'movies', 'Garner', 'second', 'only', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'ability', 'charm', 'way', 'movie', 'ability', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'make', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Even', 'cast', 'type', 'Garner', 'best', 'thing', 'movie.If', 'everything', 'movie', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'Garner', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'classic', 'wide-screen', 'desert', 'location', 'photography', 'not', 'feast', 'eyes', 'certainly', 'hearty', 'snack', 'Co-stars', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'were', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'who', ""'d"", 'proven', 'past', 'could', 'work', 'up', 'material', 'Unfortunately', 'characters', 'are', 'underwritten', 'making', 'something', 'less', 'clich', 'eacute', 'character', 'underwritten', 'practical', 'invisibility', 'belongs', 'poor', 'Laura', 'Antonelli', 'who', 'Sledge', 'love', 'interest', 'love', 'increasingly', 'important', 'role', 'plot', ""n't"", 'film', 'more', 'couple', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Not', 'nearly', 'long', 'enough', 'sell', 'love', 'care', 'that', 'much', 'when', 'jeopardized', 'Continuity', 'issue', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'simply', 'confusing', 'instance', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'trouble', 'see', 'source', 'trouble', 'hear', 'scream', 'then', 'see', 'injured', 'character', 'tumbling', 'ground', 'never', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Whenever', 'was', 'sloppy', 'editing', 'not', 'enough', 'second', 'unit', 'film', 'available', 'planned', 'purposeful', 'exclusion', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie', 'tepid', 'endorsement', 'one', 'story', 'intriguing', 'acting', 'strong', 'pretty']",N/A
