1010917,A2DDDKF5NZMTFY,B000H7J9JE,Regina McMenamin,"[40, 47]","Highly recommended, SICK AND TIRED (2006) is comedic great, Wanda Sykes's first solo HBO special.  Filmed in Seattle's Moore Theater before a crowd that howls with laughter for the entire 60-minute performance, it was directed by the legendary Keith Truesdell.In it, Sykes perfectly delivers the hilarious persona she's developed over years of appearing on Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Chris Rock Show, to name just a few of her performances.  Like a female curmudgeon, Sykes bemoans her unique frustrations with life, Medicare, politicians, scientists, old people, men and everything in between, including NASA.In the craziest, cranky-baby voice, Sykes steps out of the traditional funny girl role played by popular comediennes like Ellen DeGeneres, Sarah, Silverman, Margaret Cho and Mo'Nique.  Instead she offers the viewer an insider's look into a woman's mind - from an almost male perspective.  But it's not like she's remotely masculine herself.Supremely feminine, Sykes is a girl's girl: sassy, blunt, confident, practical and an extraordinary wordsmith.  Naturally inclined toward confessing every disturbing thought a woman could ever have, she is a goldmine of information for men interested in decoding how women really think.  And for women, she is the fantasy best friend: smart, chatty and undoubtedly a great chick to hit the town with.Watching SICK AND TIRED makes me realize that getting to know Wanda Sykes is like learning to use the Internet.

I didn't find anything I didn't like about it, and considering all the drama about gay marriage now, I was glad she DID elaborate on that topic. (I don't think I paid as much attention to the argument in 2007 as I do now, but the protests are completely out of hand these days.) The booty popping had me in tears. I rewound that a couple times because Wanda Sykes is so cool, I would've never thought she'd do that. I don't think she came down on guys too hard either. I don't know what I was thinking in 2007 (or maybe I've just done some growing up and see where she's coming from), but I think she was exactly right about her thoughts on the stress women can go through. The Q&A; was cool (although the guy who called her ""sexy"" laid it on a bit too thick and got kinda tacky) and her cheering herself on at the radio station was amusing. This was one of my favorite sets by her.(IN 2007) Pros: Sykes never fails me.  I've bought and read her book, watched her t.v. show, her comedy specials, and read her interviews.  She is absolutely the funniest female comedian I've ever seen in action.  I cracked up through this entire movie.  Classic jokes like leaving ___________ at home; A.D.D. in bed; whales; and her always hilarious Bush jokes had me holding my side.  Her and Chris Rock are my favorite comedians because they can make the most serious topic hilarious, but you learn a lesson every time.  It may be a twisted lesson, but a lesson nonetheless.Cons: I'm liberal and I agreed with all of her political points, but she came down on the fellas kinda hard.  She also elaborated on the gay marriage comments a little too long for me; I wanted her to move on to the next joke.Overall, a great performance!

1010924,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000H7J9JE,trebe,"[2, 4]","Comedian Wanda Sykes is a funny lady with an in your face style, and a wicked sense of humor.  In this performance recorded in 2006 in Seattle, her routine plays to her strengths, good timing, and an expressive physical delivery, liberally punctuated by profanity.  Wanda may get a little tongue twisted at times, but it never keeps her from telling you exactly how she feels, as the opinionated Sykes is far from shy.  Her audience seems to be nicely engaged, throughout the 70 minute performance.Subjects like sex, relationships, and discussing her personal life, work well for Sykes, while topics like technology, dislike of the space program, and politics, may not resonate as well.  Sykes' humor is often observational, focusing on current events or her personal adventures.  Some of her better material involves a racist dolphin, older people on the internet, and women's body parts.  Perhaps her most daring venture involves the scenario where a woman has the ability to leave her sex organs at home.Sick and Tired has a few misfires, but the humor is mostly on target (3.5 stars).  If major profanity isn't an issue, you may appreciate some of what Wanda has to say.
