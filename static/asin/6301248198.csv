According to the Grant Guerrero website; there is a &quot;Carpenters, Live at Budokan, 1974&quot; DVD concert.  It was released in Japan in 2002.  It has the same content as the previously released VHS tape, which many Carpenter fans already own.  I am positive the sound and video have been upgraded to the DVD level. If you want to see this DVD, you either have to have an all-region DVD player, or a DVD player that will play Japan-coded DVDs.

For those of you (like me) who already own the VHS version, I am sorry to say that ""Gold"" offers nothing new, no new tracks, no new visuals, no interviews, etc.  Obviously, the DVD format is not utilized to it's full potential and with little creative imagination.  Had there been a full menu on the DVD, plus some additional music videos, this would easily be a 5-star production.  However, for those who have never seen the Carpenters perform, ""Gold"" will be a good introduction to the duo, and serves as an technology upgrade for those who previously bought ""Yesterday Once More"".""Gold"" comprises 15 ""music videos"" of some of the Carpenters' more popular hits.  Please be aware that the term ""music video"" has taken on a whole different meaning (due to MTV), compared to when the Carpenters performed their songs. Instead of creative visual pictures and themes, the ""Gold"" visuals of the Carpenters is mostly standard fare, with Karen out front singing before the Carpenter band.  A few songs are filmed on location; such as ""Please Mister Postman"" at Disneyworld, and ""Ticket To Ride"" in the snowy mountains of Aspen. The songs span the entire breadth of the careers of Karen and Richard Capenter, from ""We've Only Just Begun"" featuring a very youthful Karen Carpenter, to ""Those Good Old Dreams"", with a much more mature Richard and a painfully thin Karen.The sound quality of the songs is excellent, as these songs are taken directly from their albums, with Karen and Richard lip-synching to the recording.  The lip-synching is done so well that in most cases one would swear they are actually singing live. Karen's characteristic rich lovely voice is flawless.I give the production 3-stars only because it could have been so much more.

The music and the pictures speak for themselves. I am not even going to attempt to talk about Karen's voice, the one beyond description, the once in an era, or possibly once in a cosmos, except to say that if you could fill a pitcher with it, I'd gladly pour it in my coffee any morning.Enough of that. Yes, we see Karen more and less thin. The songs are not presented in chronological order, probably to avoid the morbid display of Karen growing sicker and thinner by stages until her epitaph runs across the screen. This is a celebration of her life and talent. Rather than sadness in watching her grow thinner, there is joy in watching her discover herself and her place on the stage.The very first song &quot;We've only Just Begun,&quot; (of course) is an early filming. She is wearing a gawd-awful outfit that emphasizes the extra weight she carries at her waist, and detracts from her attractive and well proportioned shoulders. This may well be the outfit that spurred the review that called her chubby, that started her dieting, and well, this is the disease that Jack built. Not to mention the fact that her hair looks as though it were styled by someone more accustomed to working with Afghan hounds. What really made me cringe, though, is how dammed uncomfortable she looks up there. She tries a couple of tentative gestures, that come off so amateurish my heart breaks. She looks to the right once or twice, but mostly stares in the direction of the camera. She smiles, but doesn't move with the music. In fact, she makes no use of the stage at all. It is as though her shoes are nailed to the floor.By the time she sings &quot;Superstar,&quot; she has learned to wear a loose fitting dress that hides her body, and to stand in low light in a tight follow spot. And to use her face, and the stage to express the music.Once she is thin, she is happily out in full light. Half the time she may not look so healthy, but she has matured as a performer. She is nearly two-dimensional when she sings &quot;Top of the World,&quot; but her dress is beautiful, her hair is beautiful, she knows how to hold a microphone, she uses the stage, she moves with she music, teases Richard, smiles, tosses her head half coquettishly, half wistfully. She is in control at every moment. She really does seem to be on top of the world.Up until the end credits run, and an instrumental &quot;Close to You&quot; plays slowly while more videos and photos of Karen run, and finally the epitaph, the video is joyful. I usually stop it before the second to last song (&quot;Close to You&quot;) , and come away feeling on top of the world myself.Yes, Karen is a great and tragic loss to the world, but we still have our memories-- and our videos.",5,This Video Put Me on Top of the World,1005264000,"11 9, 2001",2001,2817,"['video', 'gorgeous', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'sub-', 'inter', 'titles', 'music', 'pictures', 'speak', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'going', 'attempt', 'talk', 'Karen', 'voice', 'one', 'description', 'once', 'era', 'possibly', 'once', 'cosmos', 'say', 'could', 'fill', 'pitcher', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'pour', 'coffee', 'morning.Enough', 'Yes', 'see', 'Karen', 'more', 'less', 'thin', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'presented', 'chronological', 'order', 'probably', 'avoid', 'morbid', 'display', 'Karen', 'growing', 'sicker', 'thinner', 'stages', 'epitaph', 'screen', 'celebration', 'life', 'talent', 'Rather', 'sadness', 'watching', 'grow', 'thinner', 'joy', 'watching', 'discover', 'herself', 'place', 'stage.The', 'very', 'first', 'song', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'only', 'Just', 'Begun', 'quot', 'course', 'early', 'filming', 'wearing', 'gawd-awful', 'outfit', 'extra', 'weight', 'waist', 'detracts', 'attractive', 'well', 'proportioned', 'shoulders', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'outfit', 'spurred', 'review', 'called', 'chubby', 'started', 'dieting', 'well', 'disease', 'Jack', 'built', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'hair', 'were', 'styled', 'someone', 'more', 'accustomed', 'working', 'Afghan', 'hounds', 'What', 'really', 'made', 'cringe', 'how', 'dammed', 'uncomfortable', 'there', 'couple', 'tentative', 'gestures', 'come', 'so', 'amateurish', 'heart', 'breaks', 'right', 'once', 'twice', 'mostly', 'direction', 'camera', ""n't"", 'move', 'music', 'fact', 'use', 'stage', 'shoes', 'are', 'nailed', 'floor.By', 'time', 'quot', 'Superstar', 'quot', 'learned', 'wear', 'loose', 'fitting', 'dress', 'body', 'stand', 'low', 'light', 'tight', 'follow', 'spot', 'use', 'face', 'stage', 'express', 'music.Once', 'thin', 'happily', 'out', 'full', 'light', 'time', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'so', 'healthy', 'matured', 'performer', 'nearly', 'two-dimensional', 'when', 'sings', 'quot', 'Top', 'World', 'quot', 'dress', 'beautiful', 'hair', 'beautiful', 'how', 'hold', 'microphone', 'stage', 'music', 'Richard', 'head', 'half', 'coquettishly', 'half', 'wistfully', 'control', 'moment', 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'top', 'world.Up', 'end', 'credits', 'run', 'instrumental', 'quot', 'Close', 'quot', 'plays', 'slowly', 'more', 'videos', 'photos', 'Karen', 'run', 'finally', 'epitaph', 'video', 'joyful', 'usually', 'stop', 'second', 'last', 'song', 'quot', 'Close', 'quot', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'top', 'world', 'myself.Yes', 'Karen', 'great', 'tragic', 'loss', 'world', 'still', 'have', 'memories', 'videos']",N/A

To begin with, A&amp;M have failed to recognise the value of DVD techonology which allows for considerable space on the disc.  Many more film clips could have been added, as well as a documentary ... but sadly none of these are provided.
