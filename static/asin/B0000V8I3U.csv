This is the first Kundalini yoga workout that i've ever done and I loved the workout itself. The meditation and chanting will take some getting used to for me but the music is great and the costumes are just that...very costumey looking and almost a little gaudy. The shoot location is great and the quality of the picture is great but it definitely is not a first rate quality production in that there are no separate chapters and her voice which is dubbed in seems really off just in the beginning. As an Intro to Kundalini, a chapter on the basic philosophy and breathing techniques used should be included. All in all though I am definitely looking forward to using this and progressing to the advanced workout. I would definitely recommend yoga for urban living which I also just got and love. It demostrates the breath of fire and it a perfect example of how a yoga dvd should be produced with sections on introductions, breathing techniques and 3 different sections on AM, PM and a longer daily workout.",4,Love it but....,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,1055,"['did', 'first', 'time', 'other', 'day', 'first', 'Kundalini', 'yoga', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'loved', 'workout', 'meditation', 'chanting', 'will', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'music', 'great', 'costumes', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'costumey', 'looking', 'almost', 'little', 'gaudy', 'shoot', 'location', 'great', 'quality', 'picture', 'great', 'definitely', 'not', 'first', 'rate', 'quality', 'production', 'are', 'separate', 'chapters', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'really', 'off', 'just', 'beginning', 'Intro', 'Kundalini', 'chapter', 'basic', 'philosophy', 'breathing', 'techniques', 'used', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'am', 'definitely', 'looking', 'forward', 'using', 'progressing', 'advanced', 'workout', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'yoga', 'urban', 'living', 'also', 'just', 'got', 'love', 'breath', 'fire', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'should', 'be', 'produced', 'sections', 'introductions', 'breathing', 'techniques', '3', 'different', 'sections', 'AM', 'PM', 'longer', 'daily', 'workout']",N/A

Rubbing hands vigorously and then showing close-ups of women with large chests didn't impress me as serious Kundalini Yoga. I was disappointed that the DVD does not include menus (it just runs from beginning to end like a VHS tape). Also, the voice seems to be dubbed in. If you can put all that aside, it is a very challenging Kundalini practice and well instructed.(Although I would not consider it for beginners. I would recommend Ravi Singh's DVDs for beginners.) The best part is Erin's music on the DVD -- it is wonderful and enlightening!

According to the instructor, Kundalini is not so much about the perfect pose, but getting the energy moving in the body. I found it easy, then challenging, but thoroughly enjoyable. Not all exercises are easy to do, and of course, the stretching is something one needs to practice. I thought the soundtrack was exquisite, and I could do most of the exercises. Erin has beautiful shoulders, and she has obviously been teaching classes for a while. I loved this, and highly recommend it.",5,One of my favorites!!,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,565,"[""'m"", 'beginner', 'know', 'nothing', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'found', 'refreshing', 'According', 'instructor', 'Kundalini', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'perfect', 'pose', 'getting', 'energy', 'moving', 'body', 'found', 'easy', 'then', 'challenging', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'Not', 'exercises', 'are', 'easy', 'do', 'course', 'stretching', 'something', 'one', 'practice', 'thought', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'exquisite', 'could', 'do', 'most', 'exercises', 'Erin', 'beautiful', 'shoulders', 'obviously', 'been', 'teaching', 'classes', 'while', 'loved', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
784818,A1AV8GAOH131O4,B0000V8I3U,"Damon Zex ""Filmmaker""","[9, 11]","With beginning or intermediate kundalini sets, often it appears compared to power yoga or ashtanga, that leg activity is sacrificed for upper body movements.  At first glance, I thought that was the case with Manrta Girl's ""An Introduction to Kundalini Yoga and Chanting.""  I initially bought her ""Warrior Workout"" and consider it paradigmatically hard.  Her entire production value interested me and I purchased this easier, though somewhat challenging workout.  Actually, upon close inspection, the legs are adequately worked if one maintains proper form.  For example, after the initial opening upper body set using stomach grinds, shoulder rotations, spinal flexes, and washing machine, there is a comprehensive sciatic nerve stretch which stretches the back and legs, essential after keeping them in easy pose so long.  After the single leg stretches, the legs are again engaged in a double forward bend.  The next primary pose, stretch pose, works the abs, utilizes leg, back, and shoulder muscles equally to maintain proper form.  Cat/cow, is an excellent back/ab follow up to the preceeding exercize.  The bowing/backbend sequence while keeping arms in Venus lock is great for the thighs and butt, as well as the arms, abs, and back.  Once the auric kriya begins, yogic push-ups work the entire body.  The arms are completely engaged.  The leg which is held high in the air forces the butt to tighten, and the single leg maintaining triangle pose experiences a complete stretch in the calf and hamstrings.  The remaining auric set generates an electromagnetic field while completely working the upper body.  I was glad to see the prosperity mantra performed in real time because I have it in a kundalini book but did not know exaclty how to perform it.  All in all, this is a great DVD to do on a day after a super rigorous worlout like power yoga or Erin's Advanced DVD.  I think it is on par with most of the intermediate kundalini DVD's I own.  I hope that it is clear upon close analysis that this workout is more of a complete body workout than it initially appears.  I applaud Erin Kamler at producing two great products.  That's more than most people in this life are capable of doing whether it's in the arts or yoga.",5,A Deceptively Complete and Powerful Workout,1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,2233,"['beginning', 'intermediate', 'kundalini', 'sets', 'often', 'compared', 'power', 'yoga', 'ashtanga', 'leg', 'activity', 'sacrificed', 'upper', 'body', 'movements', 'first', 'glance', 'thought', 'was', 'case', 'Manrta', 'Girl', 'Introduction', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'Chanting', 'initially', 'bought', 'Warrior', 'Workout', 'consider', 'paradigmatically', 'hard', 'entire', 'production', 'value', 'interested', 'purchased', 'easier', 'somewhat', 'challenging', 'workout', 'Actually', 'close', 'inspection', 'legs', 'are', 'adequately', 'worked', 'one', 'proper', 'form', 'example', 'initial', 'opening', 'upper', 'body', 'set', 'using', 'stomach', 'grinds', 'shoulder', 'rotations', 'spinal', 'flexes', 'washing', 'machine', 'comprehensive', 'sciatic', 'nerve', 'stretch', 'back', 'legs', 'essential', 'keeping', 'easy', 'pose', 'so', 'long', 'single', 'leg', 'stretches', 'legs', 'are', 'again', 'engaged', 'double', 'forward', 'bend', 'next', 'primary', 'pose', 'stretch', 'pose', 'abs', 'utilizes', 'leg', 'back', 'shoulder', 'muscles', 'equally', 'maintain', 'proper', 'form', 'Cat/cow', 'excellent', 'back/ab', 'follow', 'up', 'preceeding', 'exercize', 'bowing/backbend', 'sequence', 'keeping', 'arms', 'Venus', 'lock', 'great', 'thighs', 'butt', 'as', 'well', 'arms', 'abs', 'back', 'auric', 'kriya', 'yogic', 'push-ups', 'work', 'entire', 'body', 'arms', 'are', 'completely', 'engaged', 'leg', 'held', 'high', 'air', 'butt', 'tighten', 'single', 'leg', 'maintaining', 'triangle', 'pose', 'complete', 'stretch', 'calf', 'hamstrings', 'remaining', 'auric', 'set', 'generates', 'electromagnetic', 'field', 'completely', 'working', 'upper', 'body', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'prosperity', 'mantra', 'performed', 'real', 'time', 'have', 'kundalini', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'exaclty', 'how', 'perform', 'great', 'DVD', 'do', 'day', 'super', 'rigorous', 'worlout', 'power', 'yoga', 'Erin', 'Advanced', 'DVD', 'think', 'par', 'most', 'intermediate', 'kundalini', 'DVD', 'own', 'hope', 'clear', 'close', 'analysis', 'workout', 'more', 'complete', 'body', 'initially', 'applaud', 'Erin', 'Kamler', 'producing', 'two', 'great', 'products', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'life', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'arts', 'yoga']",N/A

There are no chapters and my dvd player couldn't even bring up a time remain clock. There is no lower body work. I found the backround music unimpressive and after a while I found myself wanting to turn off the music. There are five girls, all attractive (in their 20's) wearing what appears to be costumes with wierd pants split at the sides and tank tops. Four of the girls never speak. The main instructor talks while exercising and I think the voice over is better for the student, like me. This video was relatively expensive and not as complete as other videos I have in my library.

784822,AA1HGLBR664VQ,B0000V8I3U,Scorpio Snake,"[9, 10]","Mantra Girl Presents - An Introduction to Kundalini Yoga and Chanting is a great yoga DVD and has remained my favorite. This DVD is relaxing focusing on breathing with some meditation and chanting whiling giving you a good workout. Set outside the scenery is beautiful and Mantra Girl's music throughout the workout is just amazing. Good instruction is given before each exercise making this a good introduction for someone new to yoga. This will give you a good workout, possibly too much if you are out of shape, but you should be able to take your time and work up to Erin's pace. So this can be a DVD you will use for awhile. I know I have. Afterwards you will feel like you had a good workout and feel very relaxed. I will also add that this is great for the back if you sit at a desk all day like I tend to do for my job. My back would hurt after work but after I started using this DVD it has felt better than it ever has before. The only negative, as others have said, is that the DVD has no menus. All you can do is put this in your DVD player and let it play through. This is not really bad because you probably don't want to skip around anyway as the workout was not made in such a way, but more like attending a class. The only thing I would like to see is an option to play through without all the instruction, as after you have heard it a few times it can be a bit annoying hearing it every time you play the DVD since you already know what to do. Even so this remains my favorite yoga DVD and I highly recommend it.",5,A Great Yoga DVD,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,1530,"['Mantra', 'Girl', 'Presents', 'Introduction', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'Chanting', 'great', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'remained', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'relaxing', 'focusing', 'breathing', 'meditation', 'chanting', 'whiling', 'giving', 'good', 'workout', 'Set', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'Mantra', 'Girl', 'music', 'workout', 'just', 'amazing', 'Good', 'instruction', 'given', 'exercise', 'making', 'good', 'introduction', 'someone', 'new', 'yoga', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'workout', 'possibly', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'shape', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'time', 'work', 'up', 'Erin', 'pace', 'can', 'be', 'DVD', 'will', 'use', 'awhile', 'know', 'have', 'Afterwards', 'will', 'feel', 'had', 'good', 'workout', 'feel', 'very', 'relaxed', 'will', 'also', 'add', 'great', 'back', 'sit', 'desk', 'day', 'tend', 'do', 'job', 'My', 'back', 'would', 'hurt', 'work', 'started', 'using', 'DVD', 'felt', 'better', 'ever', 'before', 'only', 'negative', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'DVD', 'menus', 'can', 'do', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'let', 'play', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'skip', 'around', 'anyway', 'workout', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'such', 'way', 'more', 'attending', 'class', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'option', 'play', 'instruction', 'have', 'heard', 'few', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'annoying', 'hearing', 'time', 'play', 'DVD', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Even', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

I agree with some of the reviewers that it is not a complete beginners kriya.  But what determines what is beginning and intermediate in kundalini yoga is how long the pose is done, anywhere from 1-7 minutes.  I estimate that most of the poses are done for 3 minutes.  Since most of the poses are done with the arms, this makes it seem like an intermediate set.The set is to cleanse the aura.  The 2 meditations at the end are wonderful.  The 1st one is the ""morning call"" ek ong kar sat nam siri wahe guru.  The second one is ""har"" or another name for God.  Get this DVD, if you like kundalini yoga, you will like this.  She doesn't talk too much, the music is nice. Other reviews complained about the outfits.  But that's being ticky and besides you do kundalini yoga with your eyes closed, so who cares what they have on. I will do this DVD again and again.  I dread doing the Advanced DVD because it is SO hard! One more thing, there is a pose where you are kneeling with your hands clasped behind your back and you bow forward and lean back.  You end by doing camel pose for 1 minute or so with breath of fire. This so wonderful for my back!!  I love love this exercise and will probably do it every morning.
