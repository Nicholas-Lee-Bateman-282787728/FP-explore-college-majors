446946,A3B4ONQ8K44XAT,6305076995,,"[3, 3]","I cannot say enough good things about this concert film.  It is a treasure.  For fans of Yes music and fans of good music of any kind, including but not limited to progressive rock, this period in Yes' history is the absolute pinacle.  The members of Yes at this point in time are considered by most to be the best of the best, and the definitive Yes group.  Yes has changed personnel more often than most bands, but this quintet is the real deal, not only maximizing their individual roles within the band, but having actual musical chemistry.  A side note is that Bill Bruford and Alan White actually both played on different tracks, but either one are excellent and both are considered Yes rock royalty.All that said, why haven't the band members, who have made millions of dollars of the Yes brand, and who continue to adore their fans by continuing to tour ad infinitem, and who therefore continue to sell tickets to their shows, which means a lot of money going into their pockets. Why, oh why, can they not bring themselves to finance a blu ray remastering of both the sound and picture of the only recorded film of their greatest tour.  I know I am not alone in having listened to the Yessongs vinyl triple LP live version of this concert and imagined in our collective imaginations what visuals would match those sounds.  Certainly, with today's technology, this cannot be it.  Certainly, tapes must exist of both the audio and video tracks that could be restored to the extent possible then transfered to a blu ray version of this movie with at minimum 2.0 Dolby Digital sound.Please Jon, Steve, Chris, Bill, and Rick (and Alan).  Are you listening Trevor Horn? I know you know how to produce a great sounding recording (90125).  Can you help the boys out?Thanks for your consideration.",4,Great concert films deserve the royal Blu Ray treatment!,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,1796,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'concert', 'film', 'treasure', 'fans', 'Yes', 'music', 'fans', 'good', 'music', 'kind', 'including', 'not', 'limited', 'progressive', 'rock', 'period', 'Yes', 'history', 'absolute', 'pinacle', 'members', 'Yes', 'point', 'time', 'are', 'considered', 'most', 'be', 'best', 'best', 'definitive', 'Yes', 'group', 'Yes', 'changed', 'personnel', 'more', 'often', 'most', 'bands', 'quintet', 'real', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'maximizing', 'individual', 'roles', 'band', 'having', 'actual', 'musical', 'chemistry', 'side', 'note', 'Bill', 'Bruford', 'Alan', 'White', 'actually', 'played', 'different', 'tracks', 'one', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'considered', 'Yes', 'rock', 'royalty.All', 'said', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'band', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Yes', 'brand', 'who', 'continue', 'adore', 'fans', 'continuing', 'tour', 'ad', 'infinitem', 'who', 'therefore', 'continue', 'sell', 'tickets', 'shows', 'lot', 'money', 'going', 'pockets', 'Why', 'oh', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'finance', 'blu', 'ray', 'remastering', 'sound', 'picture', 'only', 'recorded', 'film', 'greatest', 'tour', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'having', 'listened', 'Yessongs', 'vinyl', 'triple', 'LP', 'live', 'version', 'concert', 'imagined', 'collective', 'imaginations', 'what', 'visuals', 'would', 'match', 'sounds', 'Certainly', 'today', 'technology', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Certainly', 'tapes', 'must', 'exist', 'audio', 'video', 'tracks', 'could', 'be', 'restored', 'extent', 'possible', 'then', 'transfered', 'blu', 'ray', 'version', 'movie', 'minimum', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound.Please', 'Jon', 'Steve', 'Chris', 'Bill', 'Rick', 'Alan', 'Are', 'listening', 'Trevor', 'Horn', 'know', 'know', 'how', 'produce', 'great', 'sounding', 'recording', '90125', 'Can', 'help', 'boys', 'out', 'Thanks', 'consideration']",N/A
446947,A3GUZIX0ITZORF,6305076995,applewood,"[1, 1]","Recently I have been having a bit of a personal YES revival. I'm currently reading Bruford's excellent book (Bill Bruford The Autobiography), just watchedYes: The Directors Cutfrom their 2003 reunion tour, and even gotGoing for the One, never one of my favorites, but the one I saw them tour for in the fall of '77. And I am happy to say that of the music, this DVD from '72 is the best yet. Sure the sound is muddy and of questionable pitch - actually it's terrible, but it's not much different than being in the kind of acoustically challenged halls they often had to play in, and if you want the best sound, just listen to the CDs. Instead consider it a bonus, all the easier to imagine actually being there and being really stoned so you could care less (which is pretty much how the audience looks).And what really matters here is seeing the band. Compared to the 2003 show, which is pretty amazing as well, if slightly mellower and more mature, this early show (an abbreviated 70 minute performance from December 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, London) shows them at their peak - at least creatively, if not personally and professionally - a mix of youthful hubris, and musical virtuosity; visionary, confident, showy and enthusiastic. As different as they all are, they all appear to be playing their hearts out. Howe is especially skilled and animated - frankly amazing, and I feel foolish to have never noticed just how much (and how well) he plays the slide guitar. And Anderson, although doing nothing much more than standing there singing, provides the glue that holds it all together. Then as now I have never been able to figure out what he is singing about, but I have never really thought it important to try. Instead I listen to the music of how he says it, letting a few key words register and take my mind with them like the abstract bits of poetry they are. And Wakeman's sequined cape is pretty cool, not to mention his array of analog instruments, and his 6 Wives solo medley is pure over-the-top keyboard wizardry that is... just so 70's. And Squire has some kind of bat wings outfit on..., while White just looks so happy to be playing!Mostly though, this is an unpretentious, even low budget, DVD - no quality audio options, or fancy camera work, and even the concert has minimal stage lights/effects (there is a mirror ball and projected images of microscopic pond life though...). But the performance is great and the video work is adequate to show them doing it. For me, the highlight is seeing the teaser 3 minute glimpse of ""Starship Trooper"" during the closing credits. For the dedicated YES fan this is a 5 star must, especially if you weren't around for this era (focuses mostly on Fragile and Close to the Edge). For those more casually interested in the music, it's more like 3 star, and I recommend just spending your money on the remastered albums from the early 70's.Perhaps for me the best part is seeing, from this perspective of 40 years later, just how ambitious the music was, and how that's what they were into without much extra frills and fluff. Entertainment sure has changed.",4,Live YES At Their Peak,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,3120,"['Recently', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'bit', 'personal', 'YES', 'revival', ""'m"", 'currently', 'reading', 'Bruford', 'excellent', 'book', 'Bill', 'Bruford', 'Autobiography', 'just', 'watchedYes', 'Directors', 'Cutfrom', '2003', 'reunion', 'tour', 'even', 'gotGoing', 'One', 'never', 'one', 'favorites', 'one', 'saw', 'tour', 'fall', ""'77"", 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'music', 'DVD', ""'72"", 'best', 'yet', 'Sure', 'sound', 'muddy', 'questionable', 'pitch', 'actually', 'terrible', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'being', 'kind', 'acoustically', 'challenged', 'halls', 'often', 'had', 'play', 'want', 'best', 'sound', 'just', 'listen', 'CDs', 'Instead', 'consider', 'bonus', 'easier', 'imagine', 'actually', 'being', 'being', 'really', 'stoned', 'so', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'audience', '.And', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'here', 'seeing', 'band', 'Compared', '2003', 'show', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'slightly', 'mellower', 'more', 'mature', 'early', 'show', 'abbreviated', '70', 'minute', 'performance', 'December', '1972', 'Rainbow', 'Theatre', 'London', 'peak', 'least', 'creatively', 'not', 'personally', 'professionally', 'mix', 'youthful', 'hubris', 'musical', 'virtuosity', 'visionary', 'confident', 'showy', 'enthusiastic', 'As', 'different', 'are', 'appear', 'be', 'playing', 'hearts', 'out', 'Howe', 'especially', 'skilled', 'animated', 'frankly', 'amazing', 'feel', 'foolish', 'have', 'never', 'noticed', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'how', 'well', 'slide', 'guitar', 'Anderson', 'doing', 'nothing', 'much', 'more', 'standing', 'singing', 'glue', 'together', 'Then', 'now', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'singing', 'about', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'important', 'try', 'Instead', 'listen', 'music', 'how', 'letting', 'few', 'key', 'words', 'register', 'take', 'mind', 'abstract', 'bits', 'poetry', 'are', 'Wakeman', 'sequined', 'cape', 'pretty', 'cool', 'not', 'mention', 'array', 'analog', 'instruments', '6', 'Wives', 'solo', 'medley', 'pure', 'over-the-top', 'keyboard', 'wizardry', 'just', 'so', '70', 'Squire', 'kind', 'bat', 'wings', 'outfit', 'White', 'just', 'so', 'happy', 'be', 'playing', 'Mostly', 'unpretentious', 'even', 'low', 'budget', 'DVD', 'quality', 'audio', 'options', 'fancy', 'camera', 'work', 'even', 'concert', 'minimal', 'stage', 'lights/effects', 'mirror', 'ball', 'projected', 'images', 'microscopic', 'pond', 'life', 'performance', 'great', 'video', 'work', 'adequate', 'show', 'doing', 'highlight', 'seeing', 'teaser', '3', 'minute', 'glimpse', 'Starship', 'Trooper', 'closing', 'credits', 'dedicated', 'YES', 'fan', '5', 'star', 'must', 'especially', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', 'era', 'mostly', 'Fragile', 'Close', 'Edge', 'more', 'casually', 'interested', 'music', 'more', '3', 'star', 'recommend', 'just', 'spending', 'money', 'remastered', 'albums', 'early', ""70's.Perhaps"", 'best', 'part', 'seeing', 'perspective', '40', 'years', 'later', 'just', 'how', 'ambitious', 'music', 'was', 'how', 'what', 'were', 'much', 'extra', 'frills', 'fluff', 'Entertainment', 'sure', 'changed']",N/A
446948,A3SH2Z6PZ5XBXR,6305076995,A reader,"[0, 0]","Performed and recorded a few months after the release of 'Close to the Edge' and the abrupt departure of drummer Bill Bruford, this show represents Yes as it crested on a tidal wave of critical acclaim and creativity.The standards are all here, of course, with the band performing 'Your Move/All Good People', 'Close to the Edge', 'And You and I', 'Roundabout', 'Yours is No Disgrace' etc. but there are, in my opinion at least, some serious omissions here.  Yes would have been well served to have left out Howe's solo rendition of 'Clap' and Wakeman's theatrical 'Excerpts from Six Wives of Henry the VIII' and instead included, for instance, 'Heart of the Sunrise' and 'Siberian Khatru'- both breathtakingly performed on the Yessongs album but, for reasons unknown, not the movie.  Likewise, the cheesy special effects interspersed with 'Close to the Edge' are unbelievably annoying, especially when the dry ice and mist encloses the stage and performers during the composition's beautifully ethereal middle section.The editing and production could have been better with some scenes not properly synchronized with the sound.  I also found the looping of the applause track to be disconcerting and an unnecessary form of cheap hype.  There are also far too many scenes focusing on Steve Howe - his face, his fingers, his prancing around the stage and not enough of Chris Squire or Rick Wakeman.  Alan White is portrayed the least probably to assuage Bill Bruford fans.The performances themselves are capable but I can never understand why the band insisted on playing each song at double its normal tempo.  Combine that with the muddy sound quality and you almost get cacophony at times, the fine points of the band's musicianship pretty much being lost.  Listen, for example, as Chris Squire tries to play the intricate bass lines of 'Yours is No Disgrace'.  I found myself disappointed as he hurried over the phrasings just to keep up with the rest of the band.  Another problem was Steve Howe's free form guitar solo played during the middle of the same tune.  Quite frankly, it stinks.  His technique is sloppy and downright uninspiring and he appears, at times, to be struggling for ideas but then again, Howe has never been known as a particularly creative improviser, preferring instead, like cohort Chris Squire, to carefully work out and rehearse his solos beforehand.All criticism aside, this concert, to me, represented a peaking for Yes.  Their subsequent work, the many personnel changes, the almost revolving door of band members coming and going, the complacency and boredom that began to set in as the seventies wore on.....These all gradually chipped away at the band's energy and creative hunger and what was known as YES, as it was in 1972, as we see them in concert on this film, soon morphed into something entirely different and unrecognizable.

446949,A3MHWG1OWOQMPG,6305076995,art lewis,"[9, 9]","My love of classic Yes -- particularly the live performances of ""Close to the Edge"" and ""Yours Is No Disgrace,"" on the old Yessongs album, led me to purchase this visual DVD, in part because I needed to actually see Steve Howe's fingers moving over the frets during my favorite parts.The opening minute or so of ""Close to the Edge"" on the old live audio album, Yessongs, for example, is, to me, an absolute miracle of guitar playing by Steve Howe -- someone who at his peak in the 1970s combined phenomenal intricacy of rhythm and texture with phenomenal speed, and a sense of unbeatable wildness with classical discipline, and beauty.  He was a wonderful fusion of the classic and romantic, the formal and the informal, Vivaldi, Country and the most lovely Rock.  So I was disappointed to find that those who filmed the performance rather foolishly filmed, not Steve's fingers on the frets during those moments of incomparable genius during the first minute of so of ""Close to the Edge"" -- instead, unbelievably, the DVD shows a half minute of images of amoebas bifurcating and so on, as one hears the music unfolding in the background.  How could they fail to put this man's fingers and face on film at the moment of his remarkable peak?Similarly, during ""Yours Is No Disgrace"" when Howe is playing the longish, brilliant rapid cascading run of intricately shaped notes that precedes the first vocals of the song -- to me, perhaps the most glorious guitar run in the history of music -- truly a full quantum leap above all the other great guitar players I've heard -- a run I can only picture to you by asking you to combine an image of the delicacy and sense of vastness of the greatest impressionist paintings (seen in person), together with an image of the greatest, fastest action or chase sequences you ever saw in any Hollywood blockbuster.  Unbelievable drama, brilliantly adept dynamism, indeed heroism, fused with ethereal sublimity.  Sometimes, to listen to classic Howe playing guitar, sounds a bit like a classically trained humming bird's invisibly fast wings must be playing the notes, or perhaps it's that time slowed down for Howe, so that despite the incredible speed of the notes, he was able to shape them, and establish remarkably complex rythmic patterns in the midst of that dramatic speed.  And above all, so pleasing to the ear (though one might have to listen a couple of times before the beauty of it begins to dawn).  And despite all the synthesizers and electronic gizmos available to him and, as I understand, innovated by him, he usually chose a wonderfully raw, pure rock guitar sound.And what were the filmakers doing during this mighty run of notes by Howe?  Incredibly, they were filming not Steve Howe's miraculous fingers working the frets, but Chris Squire, bless him, who was not even doing anything much at that moment.  Sheesh.For those who know the old Yessongs live album/CD, I should note that the performance of Yours Is No Disgrace on that album is not the same as the performance on this DVD.  The great longish sort of duet in the middle of the song between Howe and Squire --where Squire interjects every few seconds or so some bass note or other that wonderfully accents Howe's gorgeous lead -- that section, I would say, is not as well done in the concert that was recorded on this DVD -- but it is still great to see Howe on the DVD working out another version (earlier inchoate version?) of the themes worked out so brilliantly on the classic audio recording Yessongs.For those who really love Yes, this DVD is definitely worth it, despite any downsides.  There are other live performances on DVD, but I haven't got those yet.",4,"Magnifico, but.....",1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,3680,"['love', 'classic', 'Yes', 'particularly', 'live', 'performances', 'Close', 'Edge', 'Yours', 'Disgrace', 'old', 'Yessongs', 'album', 'led', 'purchase', 'visual', 'DVD', 'part', 'needed', 'actually', 'see', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'fingers', 'moving', 'frets', 'favorite', 'parts.The', 'opening', 'minute', 'so', 'Close', 'Edge', 'old', 'live', 'audio', 'album', 'Yessongs', 'example', 'absolute', 'miracle', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'someone', 'who', 'peak', '1970s', 'combined', 'phenomenal', 'intricacy', 'rhythm', 'texture', 'phenomenal', 'speed', 'sense', 'unbeatable', 'wildness', 'classical', 'discipline', 'beauty', 'was', 'wonderful', 'fusion', 'classic', 'romantic', 'formal', 'informal', 'Vivaldi', 'Country', 'most', 'lovely', 'Rock', 'So', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'who', 'filmed', 'performance', 'rather', 'foolishly', 'filmed', 'not', 'Steve', 'fingers', 'frets', 'moments', 'incomparable', 'genius', 'first', 'minute', 'so', 'Close', 'Edge', 'instead', 'unbelievably', 'DVD', 'half', 'minute', 'images', 'amoebas', 'bifurcating', 'so', 'one', 'music', 'unfolding', 'background', 'How', 'could', 'fail', 'put', 'man', 'fingers', 'face', 'film', 'moment', 'remarkable', 'peak', 'Similarly', 'Yours', 'Disgrace', 'when', 'Howe', 'playing', 'longish', 'brilliant', 'rapid', 'cascading', 'run', 'intricately', 'shaped', 'notes', 'first', 'vocals', 'song', 'perhaps', 'most', 'glorious', 'guitar', 'run', 'history', 'music', 'truly', 'full', 'quantum', 'leap', 'other', 'great', 'guitar', 'players', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'run', 'can', 'only', 'picture', 'asking', 'combine', 'image', 'delicacy', 'sense', 'vastness', 'greatest', 'impressionist', 'paintings', 'seen', 'person', 'together', 'image', 'greatest', 'fastest', 'action', 'chase', 'sequences', 'ever', 'saw', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'Unbelievable', 'drama', 'brilliantly', 'dynamism', 'indeed', 'heroism', 'fused', 'ethereal', 'sublimity', 'Sometimes', 'listen', 'classic', 'Howe', 'playing', 'guitar', 'bit', 'classically', 'trained', 'humming', 'bird', 'invisibly', 'fast', 'wings', 'must', 'be', 'playing', 'notes', 'perhaps', 'time', 'slowed', 'down', 'Howe', 'incredible', 'speed', 'notes', 'was', 'able', 'shape', 'establish', 'remarkably', 'complex', 'rythmic', 'patterns', 'midst', 'dramatic', 'speed', 'so', 'pleasing', 'ear', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'listen', 'couple', 'times', 'beauty', 'dawn', 'synthesizers', 'electronic', 'gizmos', 'available', 'understand', 'innovated', 'usually', 'chose', 'wonderfully', 'raw', 'pure', 'rock', 'guitar', 'sound.And', 'were', 'filmakers', 'doing', 'mighty', 'run', 'notes', 'Howe', 'Incredibly', 'were', 'filming', 'not', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'miraculous', 'fingers', 'working', 'frets', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'bless', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'doing', 'anything', 'much', 'moment', 'Sheesh.For', 'who', 'know', 'old', 'Yessongs', 'live', 'album/CD', 'should', 'note', 'performance', 'Yours', 'Disgrace', 'album', 'not', 'same', 'performance', 'DVD', 'great', 'longish', 'sort', 'duet', 'middle', 'song', 'Howe', 'Squire', 'where', 'Squire', 'few', 'seconds', 'so', 'bass', 'note', 'other', 'wonderfully', 'Howe', 'gorgeous', 'lead', 'section', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'still', 'great', 'see', 'Howe', 'DVD', 'working', 'out', 'version', 'earlier', 'inchoate', 'version', 'themes', 'worked', 'out', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'classic', 'audio', 'recording', 'Yessongs.For', 'who', 'really', 'love', 'Yes', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'downsides', 'are', 'other', 'live', 'performances', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'yet']",N/A

If you are a Yes fan, you will probably want to view &quot;Yessongs,&quot; especially if you never saw the band live.  I saw the band live about 5 years after this concert was filmed, and not much had changed.  More of a light show, more keyboards for Wakeman, more great tunes, but basically the show was unchanged.&quot;Yessongs&quot; opens up with (a somewhat slower version than the studio version of) &quot;I've Seen All Good People.&quot;  It's a good start to the concert, featuring the skills of all of the members.  Jon Anderson's unique voice, although not captured as well here as on any of their albums, comes through as well as the sound quality will allow.  Chris Squire's bass work and vocals show why he was an integral part of the group.  Wakeman has a few good moments, but mostly is hidden behind his huge sequined cape.  The show really belongs to Steve Howe and his incredible guitar work.  Especially during the first half of the concert, Howe is the primary focus.  Here we see one of the most talented and overlooked guitarists of the 1970's.  Most of the music itself is very good, except for the &quot;Wives of Henry VIII&quot; which is all Wakeman.  Part of what made Yes great was the uniqueness of their sound, the feeling that they were playing music from another world.  The sounds were great, but they were ahead of where the video/audio technology was at that time.  In the year 2001, we are used to well-produced video, great effects, and digital audio.  Unfortunately, none of these elements are present in &quot;Yessongs.&quot;  I would really like to find out if the band was filmed in their later years with a better video/audio set-up.

It was produced from footage from 1973.  It's not Paul McCartney or U2, but it is of sufficient quality for an enjoyable experiance.  It's not fuzzy or materially lacking in any way.  The video is quite clear and gives an accurate reproduction of a Yes concert from 1973.  The camera angles are very good, the camera is not bouncing around all over the place from musician to musician like some of the the more recent DVD's.  I have a Cream DVD from 1968 the quality is really quite good, and this footage is at least as good if not better.

Yes in high gear at the height of their prowess is a scary proposition. If only there was more of this stuff. I'll take all they got.There seem to be a lot of complaints about the quality of the sound and picture. As someone who saw Ladies and Gentlemen, the Rolling Stones, Yessongs, Jimi Hendrix and The Song Remains the Same in movie theaters at the time of their releases, I can't agree. The Hendrix movie and Yessongs are mind-blowing in both audio and image, capturing their subjects in all their glory.On top of being a musically supercharged concert, Yessongs is full of good cinema technique, interesting montages and just the kind of shots you hope to see, like Howe during All Good People, Close to the Edge and Roundabout or Alan White playing the triangle during And You and I. There's even at great shot of a young, ardent fan having the bottom dropped out from underneath him when the band leaves out the final bridge to Yours is No Disgrace. These touches along with the superb set list and excellent sound quality make this the same kind of must to your music DVD collection that, back in the day, made Yessongs a must for your vinyl collection.My only gripe would be that Yessongs VHS, which I originally paid $55.00 for, and vinyl should have included extra material when transferred to DVD and CD.

Long ""JaminRebel""","[1, 1]","YessongsDVD MenuYour MoveI've Seen All Good PeopleThe ClapAnd You and IClose to the EdgeExcerpts from the Six Wives of Henry VIIIRoundaboutYours Is No DisgraceI am giving Yessongs the dvd four stars simply because it captures an awesome band playing in an awesome way. Everything you need to fully appreciate just how GREAT YES was in the early 70's is captured here. I am a merenovice fan compared to many who have commented here, and who will comment, so keep that in mind. That being said I thought the dvd was pretty great. I basically knew every song, and the setlist is a ""greatest hits"" sort of setlist too. Most fans of YES will know the songs. As for the visuals the film quality was pretty good overall. However, anyone can clearly see how the concert was simply SLAPPED ONTO DVD FROM A VIDEO SOURCE. There is absolutely NO remastering of any kind. Near the end of the show I could see lines on the screen from I guess where the video source was scratched. And there are all kinds of video anomalies that anyone would see in an old vhs movie, or any dvd that was never remastered. Still, with all of this being known, the stage was well lighted and very band member was easily recognizable. The image is NOT blurry or fuzzy, and the closeups are good. It is true though that often when someone was playing a solo the camera was not on them. Here I am thinking of Chris Squire on bass, not enough closeups of him playing bass solos. Also, I don't really remember many closeups of Alan White the drummer. As for Rick Wakeman mostly the camera came up to him from behind or from the side. We don't see Rick right in front of us often if ever. Mostly all of the good closeups are on Steve Howe on guitar and Jon Anderson on vocals. The audio is what I had the biggest problem with. The audio isn't so bad, but it seems that it was dubbed on to the film and it doesn't quite match the band and the singer as they play. The sound is synched up closely, but it's not a match. It often seemed like the band was lip synching to a soundtrack. Obviously they were jamming and playing incredibly, but this is what I think is the biggest flaw of the dvd. The other thing that pissed me off was how the dvd case was one of those new cheapos that is mostly hollow and missing plastic. And the disc is a simple silver affair without color. There is no track listing on the dvd insert or on the disc. It does smack of someone making an easy buck. Also, at the end of this concert film we see the movie as being rated G. Wow, straight from a movie theater piece of stock footage to a dvd.Anyway, this is a great band at their peak playing great rock and roll. Forget about what this disc is not and focus on the MUSIC. The MUSIC is what this dvd is suppossed to be about. Yes, the limitations of the dvd are a real pisser, but this concert is just shy of being 40 years old now. The band now has a replacement singer. Time marches on. Don't let the quality of this dvd keep you from enjoying a truely fantastic band who was caught peaking in their craft.",4,"Naysayers need to lighten up, A LOT.

446967,AD29KEJMCAD76,6305076995,Samhot,"[60, 62]","This set here captures Yes in fine form, as they were performing songs to support their 1972 release _Close To The Edge_. As many reviewers have stated, the sound quality is quite faint, which can be inexcusable to many viewers, but the performances are top-notch, and on the whole, is worthwhile for the Yes fan.The six performances on here are for: &quot;Your Move/I've Seen All Good People,&quot; &quot;The Clap,&quot; &quot;And You And I,&quot; &quot;Close To The Edge,&quot; &quot;Jingle Bells/Hallelujah/Roundabout&quot; and &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; as an encore.&quot;Your Move..&quot; is quite a nice performance as vocalist Jon Anderson is using his ethereal upper-register, and Steve Howe is playing mind-blowing material on his guitar (though in the first half, he plays what looks like a mandolin.) The vocal harmonies exchanged by Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire and Steve are nice as well. I also liked watching keyboardist Rick Wakeman clapping his hands during the handclapping section. &quot;The Clap&quot; is an extraordinary workout by Steve Howe. It was nice watching the close-ups on the fretboard, and watching Steve's amazing technique and virtuosity.Elsewhere, hearing and seeing this live performance of &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; was quite refreshing, and sits quite nicely with the studio version. The opening was melodic and mesmerizing, although there were some parts in the beginning where you couldn't see the bandmembers, due to some of the art collages. This may annoy some viewers as this appears in other places during the performance, particularly during the third movement, &quot;I Get Up, I Get Down.&quot; It was almost like magic witnessing Rick Wakeman, wearing his glowing silver cape, playing that soaring synthesizer lead before the crashing rhythm section jumps in to close out that third movement.And, for more Rick Wakeman, he continues his magic on the &quot;Jingle Bells/Hallelujah/Roundabout&quot; medley. The first two parts feature Rick on the keyboards alone. First, he starts with a fairly reverent version of &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; then all of a sudden, it turns into a funked-up, bluesy piece, with the audience members clapping along. Then comes his interpretation of &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; which was magnificently done, as he plays a synthesizer with his left hand, and what I think is a mellotron with his right hand simultaneously. It's unbelievable how he could get orchestral/choiral effects out of his instrument. But, of course, that may as well have been the technology at the time. But, in any event, it was nice to watch what many non-prog rock fans would simply call silliness and indulgence. And to end it all, there's an energetic version of &quot;Roundabout.&quot; The encore was lots of fun as well, which was the fiery live version of &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace.&quot;To end this horribly written review, I'll just say that this should be owned by Yes fans, especially for fans who wish they could have seen the band play live in their 1970s period. Despite the slightly lacking sound quality, this still shouldn't be ignored, as the performances are excellent.",5,Yes' performances outshine the faint sound quality.,1054857600,"06 6, 2003",2003,3152,"['set', 'here', 'Yes', 'fine', 'form', 'were', 'performing', 'songs', 'support', '1972', 'release', '_Close', 'Edge_', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'sound', 'quality', 'quite', 'faint', 'can', 'be', 'inexcusable', 'many', 'viewers', 'performances', 'are', 'top-notch', 'whole', 'worthwhile', 'Yes', 'fan.The', 'six', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'quot', 'Move/I', ""'ve"", 'Seen', 'All', 'Good', 'People', 'quot', 'quot', 'Clap', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Close', 'Edge', 'quot', 'quot', 'Jingle', 'Bells/Hallelujah/Roundabout', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yours', 'No', 'Disgrace', 'quot', 'encore.', 'quot', 'Move..', 'quot', 'quite', 'nice', 'performance', 'vocalist', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'using', 'ethereal', 'upper-register', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'playing', 'mind-blowing', 'material', 'guitar', 'first', 'half', 'what', 'mandolin', 'vocal', 'harmonies', 'exchanged', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'bassist', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'Steve', 'are', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'liked', 'watching', 'keyboardist', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'clapping', 'hands', 'handclapping', 'section', 'quot', 'Clap', 'quot', 'extraordinary', 'workout', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'was', 'nice', 'watching', 'close-ups', 'fretboard', 'watching', 'Steve', 'amazing', 'technique', 'virtuosity.Elsewhere', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'live', 'performance', 'quot', 'Close', 'Edge', 'quot', 'was', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'quite', 'nicely', 'studio', 'version', 'opening', 'was', 'melodic', 'mesmerizing', 'were', 'parts', 'beginning', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'bandmembers', 'due', 'art', 'may', 'annoy', 'viewers', 'other', 'places', 'performance', 'particularly', 'third', 'movement', 'quot', 'Get', 'Up', 'Get', 'Down.', 'quot', 'was', 'almost', 'magic', 'witnessing', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'wearing', 'glowing', 'silver', 'cape', 'playing', 'soaring', 'synthesizer', 'lead', 'crashing', 'rhythm', 'section', 'jumps', 'close', 'out', 'third', 'movement.And', 'more', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'magic', 'quot', 'Jingle', 'Bells/Hallelujah/Roundabout', 'quot', 'medley', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'feature', 'Rick', 'keyboards', 'alone', 'First', 'fairly', 'reverent', 'version', 'quot', 'Jingle', 'Bells', 'quot', 'then', 'sudden', 'funked-up', 'bluesy', 'piece', 'audience', 'members', 'clapping', 'along', 'Then', 'interpretation', 'quot', 'Hallelujah', 'quot', 'was', 'magnificently', 'done', 'synthesizer', 'left', 'hand', 'what', 'think', 'mellotron', 'right', 'hand', 'simultaneously', 'unbelievable', 'how', 'could', 'get', 'orchestral/choiral', 'effects', 'instrument', 'course', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'technology', 'time', 'event', 'was', 'nice', 'watch', 'what', 'many', 'non-prog', 'rock', 'fans', 'would', 'simply', 'call', 'silliness', 'indulgence', 'end', 'energetic', 'version', 'quot', 'Roundabout.', 'quot', 'encore', 'was', 'lots', 'fun', 'well', 'was', 'fiery', 'live', 'version', 'quot', 'Yours', 'No', 'Disgrace.', 'quot', 'end', 'horribly', 'written', 'review', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'should', 'be', 'owned', 'Yes', 'fans', 'especially', 'fans', 'who', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'band', 'play', 'live', '1970s', 'period', 'slightly', 'lacking', 'sound', 'quality', 'still', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent']",N/A
