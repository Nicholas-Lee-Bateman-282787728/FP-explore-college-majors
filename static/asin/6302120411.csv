Susan Cabot and Barboura Morris star in this sordid tale of a cosmestics empire magnate and her desire to hold onto her fading looks.Enter a kooky scientist who has a miracle formula that is taken from queen wasps, and once injected will make you stay young forever!Needless to say, poor Susan gets hooked on the stuff and turns into a wasp creature that goes on a killing spree.A great B-movie, and very enjoyable.  Being a huge fan, I purchased the Elvira's Midnight Madness edition from Rhino Video.

She finally comes across such a serum, or so she thinks!!! The injections that she is given eventually turn her into the title character. Not as bad as you'd think, and really quite fun.

296453,A24GYTKSRBTR7P,6302120411,Matt Hanke,"[3, 6]","Not much to say about this loser of a film.  I really don't understand how &quot;Wasp Woman&quot; has become the B movie classic it is.  Granted it's a Roger Corman film, but that doesn't necessarily make it good.Basically, the movie is about a woman who is the head of a cosmetics company and decides to experiment with &quot;wasp jelly&quot; in order to unlock the secret of eternal youth.  However, her plan backfires when she ends up looking vaguely like a wasp and begins killing people.Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of old B sci-fi and horror films, but this one really did suck.  Aside from the movie being just plain boring, the wasp make up is only seen for a total of about 5 minutes of the actual film time, and doesn't look at all convincing.  That along with a very corny plot and dialogue (even for this kind of film), and completely stale acting, make this an extremely boring movie which should only be viewed by insomniacs who can manage to find it showing on some t.v. station in the early hours of the morning.  If this movie doesn't put them to sleep, nothing will.Watch it if you want to, but please don't say I didn't warn you.",1,Yawn!,988675200,"05 1, 2001",2001,1148,"['Not', 'much', 'say', 'loser', 'film', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'quot', 'Wasp', 'Woman', 'quot', 'become', 'B', 'movie', 'classic', 'Granted', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'good.Basically', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'head', 'cosmetics', 'company', 'decides', 'experiment', 'quot', 'jelly', 'quot', 'order', 'unlock', 'secret', 'eternal', 'youth', 'However', 'plan', 'when', 'up', 'looking', 'vaguely', 'wasp', 'killing', 'people.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'fan', 'old', 'B', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'really', 'did', 'suck', 'Aside', 'movie', 'being', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'wasp', 'make', 'up', 'only', 'seen', 'total', '5', 'minutes', 'actual', 'film', 'time', ""n't"", 'look', 'convincing', 'very', 'corny', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'even', 'kind', 'film', 'completely', 'stale', 'acting', 'make', 'extremely', 'boring', 'movie', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'viewed', 'insomniacs', 'who', 'can', 'manage', 'find', 'showing', 't.v', 'station', 'early', 'hours', 'morning', 'movie', ""n't"", 'put', 'sleep', 'nothing', 'will.Watch', 'want', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn']",N/A

Susan starred in mostly B movies and was good looking but she was murdered by her son in real life. According to actor Christopher Jones, in the book THE GOSSIP COLUMNIST, he was the father of her son. And her son stabbed her to death, being a not too sane person. Chris said he attended the court hearings and the boy, in his early 20's, was never put on trial but sent to a sanitarium before he can come to any trial, if that ever happens.The quality of this DVD is terrible. Looks like it was made off a 16mm print. If only for you to see what Susan Cabot looked like, that is all the good it is for. If Restored it could have been a ""camp"" film. She is in another DVD with Keith Andes, a war story that was restored and looks good too.
