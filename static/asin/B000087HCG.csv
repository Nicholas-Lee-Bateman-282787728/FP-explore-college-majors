735074,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B000087HCG,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[7, 7]","As a class assignment, some college students are each given a piece of a mannequin which they are to decorate with something personal, or that at least says something about them.  Then it is reassembled and they tell the stories behind what they did. This is done at a bar as everyone is getting very drunk.  The stories turn out to be rather interesting.  It could have easily slipped into melodrama, but it manages to instead be quite dramatic.  Anyhow, the mannequin comes to life and begins stalking and killing them.The characters really make this movie, they are very realistic and, with the exception of the uber-obnoxious ingrate, they manage to be rather sympathetic.  The action (killings) are rather uninteresting, as there is little suspense and no gore.  However, the Tawny character is absolutely fabulous to look at, she does an extremely sleazy dance at the bar, and then strips to her undies for a few minutes.  Her character is also really screwed up, real Jerry Springer show material, but still she's interesting and realistic.  There's also another girl in a tube top that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination.  And the main heroine gets stripped to her undies at the end.  I call that good film making.As a bonus, you get the movie Totem on this disk as well (at least it was on my copy).  It's a slow moving, zero budget horror movie about 6 teenagers who are mysteriously drawn to a cabin out in the woods.  There are some demon dolls involved that want 3 of the kids to kill the other 3 so that they may bring the dead back to life and perhaps take over the world or something.  It manages to be vaguely entertaining.  There's also a commentary track for Jigsaw.  I only listened to the first few minutes of it, and rather bizarrely they seem to have every gaffer, best boy and perhaps even the caterer on the track.  I'm looking forward to giving it a listen at some later date.",4,"Bizarre, but fairly good",1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,1912,"['class', 'assignment', 'college', 'students', 'are', 'given', 'piece', 'mannequin', 'are', 'decorate', 'something', 'personal', 'least', 'something', 'Then', 'reassembled', 'tell', 'stories', 'what', 'did', 'done', 'bar', 'everyone', 'getting', 'very', 'drunk', 'stories', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'interesting', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'slipped', 'melodrama', 'instead', 'be', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'Anyhow', 'mannequin', 'life', 'stalking', 'killing', 'them.The', 'characters', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'exception', 'uber-obnoxious', 'ingrate', 'manage', 'be', 'rather', 'sympathetic', 'action', 'killings', 'are', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'little', 'suspense', 'gore', 'However', 'Tawny', 'character', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'look', 'extremely', 'sleazy', 'dance', 'bar', 'then', 'strips', 'undies', 'few', 'minutes', 'character', 'also', 'really', 'screwed', 'up', 'real', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'show', 'material', 'still', 'interesting', 'realistic', 'also', 'girl', 'tube', 'top', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'main', 'heroine', 'stripped', 'undies', 'end', 'call', 'good', 'film', 'making.As', 'bonus', 'get', 'movie', 'Totem', 'disk', 'as', 'well', 'least', 'was', 'copy', 'slow', 'moving', 'zero', 'budget', 'horror', 'movie', '6', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'drawn', 'cabin', 'out', 'woods', 'are', 'demon', 'dolls', 'involved', 'want', '3', 'kids', 'kill', 'other', '3', 'may', 'bring', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 'perhaps', 'take', 'world', 'something', 'be', 'vaguely', 'entertaining', 'also', 'commentary', 'track', 'Jigsaw', 'only', 'listened', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'rather', 'bizarrely', 'seem', 'have', 'gaffer', 'best', 'boy', 'perhaps', 'even', 'caterer', 'track', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'giving', 'listen', 'later', 'date']",N/A
735075,A19LGBGAQVATC8,B000087HCG,Eddie Quist,"[1, 1]","""Jigsaw"" is one of those films that just gets funner the more times that you see it. Directed by Don Adams and Harry Picardi, ""Jigsaw"" tells a rather silly tale about a group of community college students whom are each given a piece of a mannequin to decorate for an art project. Being that they each carry their own personal baggage, they decide to arm the dummie with all sorts of weaponry, (like saws and shotguns). After a drunken unvailing, they decide to burn the newly formed (Rambo-Dummie) as a rite of passage, and to leave their troubles behind... Yeah RIGHT!Needless to say, ol' Jigsaw comes to life and proceeds to take his body pieces back from each of the really dumb students...""Jigsaw"" is chaulk full of campy Horror movie cliches and B-Movie hysteria, and if this is your thing, you should certainly take a look at this often overlooked splatter-piece by ""Full Moon Pictures.The acting is admirable, and the overall production value is decent, so there is really nothing much to complain about here.""Jigsaw"" is NOT a thinking man's Horror film... It is a fun little low budget Indie that simply entertains.

735076,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,B000087HCG,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[3, 4]","Well here's an indie horror film that's better than most. A creepy art teacher comes up with a strange project for his students. They are each to take a mannequin part, decorate it, and bring it in the following week. But class is going at night in the Stinky Pete's bar. A drinking game is involved putting 'Jigsaw' back together.After the grotesque thing is put together (complete with saw blades, sawed off shotguns, Roman candles, and newspaper clippings) it is to be burned. Well of course it comes to life. It now kills off it's creators taking a body part from each.Aimee Bravo as Tawny is the highliught of this film. No nude scenes, but she is so hot I swore she was Daizee Kellogg from BustyAmateurs.com. I had to read the credits to find out who she was. She dances in the bar, tells her classmates a heartbreaking story, and spends a good amount of time in a blue bra and [...]. Well the shotgun shell with her name on it does her in and she doesn't leave her sister behind after-all.Another dude gets strangled with barbed-wire. A girl gets killed in her husbands tractor-trailer. The rig driver gets sawed up along with another kid who tries to escape in a car. Thatleaves the professor and one female student (Stinky Pete had a heart attack).So he knocks her unconscious, strips her to her underwear, and ties her down with Christmas lights (that'll teach her to resist his advances). The professor thinks that Jigsaw just needs one more part, a head. So he's willing to sacrifice his student's life to save his own. Jigsaw comes in and sees her.I'll let you see the ending yourself.Unfortunately the film ends suddenly with the last killing. We never see what Jigsaw does with the parts. The film is short at an hour and fifteen minutes. Too bad we didn't get 15 additional minutes to see the result of Jigsaw's handiwork. But hey, at least the bad guy finally wins one.",5,Art class hell at Stinky Pete's,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,1886,"['Well', 'here', 'indie', 'horror', 'film', 'better', 'most', 'creepy', 'art', 'teacher', 'up', 'strange', 'project', 'students', 'are', 'take', 'mannequin', 'part', 'decorate', 'bring', 'following', 'week', 'class', 'going', 'night', 'Stinky', 'Pete', 'bar', 'drinking', 'game', 'involved', 'putting', ""'Jigsaw"", 'back', 'grotesque', 'thing', 'put', 'together', 'complete', 'saw', 'blades', 'sawed', 'off', 'shotguns', 'Roman', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'be', 'burned', 'Well', 'course', 'life', 'now', 'creators', 'taking', 'body', 'part', 'each.Aimee', 'Bravo', 'Tawny', 'highliught', 'film', 'nude', 'scenes', 'so', 'hot', 'swore', 'was', 'Daizee', 'Kellogg', 'BustyAmateurs.com', 'had', 'read', 'credits', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'bar', 'classmates', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'good', 'amount', 'time', 'blue', 'bra', '[', ']', 'Well', 'shotgun', 'shell', 'name', ""n't"", 'leave', 'sister', 'after-all.Another', 'dude', 'strangled', 'barbed-wire', 'girl', 'killed', 'husbands', 'tractor-trailer', 'rig', 'driver', 'sawed', 'up', 'kid', 'who', 'escape', 'car', 'professor', 'one', 'female', 'student', 'Stinky', 'Pete', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', '.So', 'unconscious', 'underwear', 'down', 'Christmas', 'lights', ""'ll"", 'teach', 'resist', 'advances', 'professor', 'Jigsaw', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'part', 'head', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'student', 'life', 'save', 'own', 'Jigsaw', 'sees', 'her.I', ""'ll"", 'let', 'see', 'ending', 'yourself.Unfortunately', 'film', 'suddenly', 'last', 'killing', 'never', 'see', 'what', 'Jigsaw', 'parts', 'film', 'short', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', '15', 'additional', 'minutes', 'see', 'result', 'Jigsaw', 'handiwork', 'hey', 'least', 'bad', 'guy', 'finally', 'one']",N/A

It's not just a monster hacking away at horny teenagers. You get to know the characters very well and you actually care for most of them. I was at the world premeier and met all the actors. it was fun. I highly recomend you guys buy this movie. it rocks! Even though the horror and scary stuff dosn't happen until the last 35 minutes, it's still really good. The first half is also interesting. It explains the characters backrounds and such before they are set to slaughter, it's actually kind of intersting. My favorite character was Tawny, she was the cutest and the best.
