Actually it was because of the fps scene, where everything happened like in the game. For some reason I wanted to see the movie again and the scene actually took like less than 5 minutes. I understood why they did it and I no longer hate it, though it made movie look different/weird. I mean, it's not the game, right. I liked characters and the story. Wish there were more. Great movie.

959084,A90OOWQZR6QIP,B000CNER1S,Aaron R. Headley,"[5, 6]","Everyone keeps saying you can't make good movies based on video games, but I disagree. Yeah some games should stay as games, mario and double dragon for example. However a lot of new games coming out nowadays have a pretty indebth plot thatI feel would make a good movie. But that requires the film makers to actually care about the source material. Which the director and screenwriter of Doom obviously didn't. I'm not trying to be obsessively nit picky saying the movie has to be exactly like the game, not at all.I mean I can understand taking liberties with the story line a little bit, add a character here change a character there, but there are just somethings you dont change. Like the monsters. WHY make them humans that are now mutated? (A guy named Pinky turns into the Pinky demon....im sorry mutant LAME) Doom was never about mutations. Doom was about demons from hell, PERIOD.I mean that was the biggest thing of doom and its atmosphere, especially in doom 3. the upside down crosses, the pentegrams and demonic symbols, etc. etc. Its like if they made a game based on Aliens, but instead of fighting Aliens you fight robots. I mean seriously, they might as well have called it Resident Evil In Space. For all of you who are wanting to know what a good movie on Doom would be like, read the original Doom book. It was creepy and entertaining. And it followed the doom mythos perfectly.I'm not going to say this movie was without worth, it was a decent time waster, and entertained for an hour and a half, but as a Doom movie it sucked.No one watches a movie called Doom expecting an oscar winning performance, so I'll say the acting was fine, i made it through the movie without gagging. Although I was hoping that the Rock could find the charisma he so aptly uses in the ring and apply it to film, not the case.Special effects were good, but once again, did you watch resident evil? Then this is the standard you should expect for this movie. Nemesis looks hauntlingly familiar to the so called baron of hell in this movie.There is one thing I can say that I actually liked. Originally when I read about it in the paper, I just shook my head and thought it would be the stupidest thing ever. However the first person view portion of the movie was actually done pretty well done. Cheesy, but it was cool. It was basically the only thing in this movie that set it apart from the other sci fi rehash movies out there.As a movie based off the game Doom, I give it 1 star. They could have read the Doom book and scribbled a plot from that and it would have been ten times better for the Doom fans.As just a movie in general, entertainment wise, I would say 2 1/2 to 3 stars. It did keep me preoccupied for that hour and a half.",2,"dissapointing, but not complete garbage",1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2737,"['Everyone', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'games', 'disagree', 'games', 'should', 'stay', 'games', 'mario', 'double', 'dragon', 'example', 'However', 'lot', 'new', 'games', 'coming', 'out', 'nowadays', 'have', 'pretty', 'indebth', 'plot', 'thatI', 'feel', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'film', 'makers', 'actually', 'care', 'source', 'material', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Doom', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'obsessively', 'nit', 'picky', 'saying', 'movie', 'be', 'exactly', 'game', 'not', 'all.I', 'mean', 'can', 'understand', 'taking', 'liberties', 'story', 'line', 'little', 'bit', 'add', 'character', 'here', 'change', 'character', 'there', 'are', 'just', 'somethings', 'dont', 'change', 'monsters', 'WHY', 'make', 'humans', 'are', 'now', 'mutated', 'guy', 'named', 'Pinky', 'Pinky', 'demon', '.im', 'sorry', 'mutant', 'LAME', 'Doom', 'was', 'never', 'mutations', 'Doom', 'was', 'demons', 'hell', 'PERIOD.I', 'mean', 'was', 'biggest', 'thing', 'doom', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'doom', '3.', 'upside', 'down', 'crosses', 'pentegrams', 'demonic', 'symbols', 'etc', 'etc', 'made', 'game', 'based', 'Aliens', 'instead', 'fighting', 'Aliens', 'fight', 'robots', 'mean', 'seriously', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'called', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Space', 'who', 'are', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'Doom', 'would', 'be', 'read', 'original', 'Doom', 'book', 'was', 'creepy', 'entertaining', 'followed', 'doom', 'mythos', 'perfectly.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'was', 'decent', 'time', 'waster', 'entertained', 'hour', 'half', 'Doom', 'movie', 'one', 'movie', 'called', 'Doom', 'expecting', 'oscar', 'winning', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'i', 'made', 'movie', 'gagging', 'was', 'hoping', 'Rock', 'could', 'find', 'charisma', 'so', 'aptly', 'ring', 'apply', 'film', 'not', 'case.Special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'once', 'again', 'did', 'watch', 'resident', 'evil', 'Then', 'standard', 'should', 'expect', 'movie', 'Nemesis', 'hauntlingly', 'familiar', 'so', 'called', 'baron', 'hell', 'movie.There', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'actually', 'liked', 'Originally', 'when', 'read', 'paper', 'just', 'shook', 'head', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'stupidest', 'thing', 'ever', 'However', 'first', 'person', 'view', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'Cheesy', 'was', 'cool', 'was', 'basically', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'set', 'apart', 'other', 'sci', 'fi', 'rehash', 'movies', 'out', 'there.As', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'game', 'Doom', 'give', '1', 'star', 'could', 'have', 'read', 'Doom', 'book', 'scribbled', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'Doom', 'fans.As', 'just', 'movie', 'general', 'entertainment', 'wise', 'would', 'say', '2', '1/2', '3', 'stars', 'did', 'keep', 'preoccupied', 'hour', 'half']",N/A
959085,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000CNER1S,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 0]","I must admit, Doom had much more potential to be a movie than most other games. It's not that it's bad, there still good to be had, but it just could have done so much more. I love the original Doom for SNES and PC, but the movie borrows too much from the first Resident Evil movie and doesn't really capture the spirit of the classic game. Not to mention the fact that I did not know that I would be stamping this film as the 18th zombie I've watched.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A team of marines are sent to Mars to investigate a distress call put out from a remote research center on the planet called the Olduvai Research Station. Strange things begin happening; scientists are dead, terrifying creatures lurk in the dark and wait to eat and infect the soldiers, all while trying to figure out what Chromosome-24 does to the human body when injected into the system. The storyline just isn't that great, it borrows pages from the first Resident Evil movie, only Resident Evil told its story in a much better fashion in every single way and it was more explanatory.GORE FACTOR: Limb-ripping, flesh eating, and even some chainsaw action, but there is very little present most of the time.MUSIC: Why is this music even here? It sucks! There is not much present, and it doesn't fit the themes of the movie.SCARE FACTOR: You will mostly end up laughing at its attempt to be scary, because it is not scary at all. The creature designs sure look great though, and seem to follow the game.ENTERTAINMENT: You will mostly find it to be comedic, even though it is unintentional. Certain action scenes are quite entertaining, while others are just downright stupid. For example: The fight scene at the end of the movie. It's like watching a freaking Jean Claude Van Damme movie for Godsake (UUUUGGGGHHHHH.....). It does a decent job of ripping off Resident Evil, but it just doesn't really follow the spirit of the awesome game.OVERALL: It's worth a rental, maybe even a buy if you're interested enough. Just don't expect to be wowed by anything.THE GOOD: Decent gore, decent ripping off of the first Resident Evil movie, and it's funny.THE BAD: Doesn't really follow the spirit of the game, music is awful, and the movie is unintentionally funny.",3,A BLATANT HACK-JOB VERSION OF RESIDENT EVIL  7.5 OUT OF 10,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,2228,"['must', 'admit', 'Doom', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'potential', 'be', 'movie', 'most', 'other', 'games', 'not', 'bad', 'still', 'good', 'be', 'had', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'love', 'original', 'Doom', 'SNES', 'PC', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'capture', 'spirit', 'classic', 'game', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'stamping', 'film', '18th', 'zombie', ""'ve"", 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'team', 'marines', 'are', 'sent', 'Mars', 'investigate', 'distress', 'call', 'put', 'out', 'remote', 'research', 'center', 'planet', 'called', 'Olduvai', 'Research', 'Station', 'Strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happening', 'scientists', 'are', 'dead', 'terrifying', 'creatures', 'lurk', 'dark', 'wait', 'eat', 'infect', 'soldiers', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Chromosome-24', 'human', 'body', 'when', 'injected', 'system', 'storyline', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'pages', 'first', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'movie', 'only', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'told', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'fashion', 'single', 'way', 'was', 'more', 'explanatory.GORE', 'FACTOR', 'Limb-ripping', 'flesh', 'eating', 'even', 'chainsaw', 'action', 'very', 'little', 'present', 'most', 'time.MUSIC', 'Why', 'music', 'even', 'here', 'not', 'much', 'present', ""n't"", 'fit', 'themes', 'movie.SCARE', 'FACTOR', 'will', 'mostly', 'end', 'up', 'laughing', 'attempt', 'be', 'scary', 'not', 'scary', 'creature', 'sure', 'look', 'great', 'seem', 'follow', 'game.ENTERTAINMENT', 'will', 'mostly', 'find', 'be', 'comedic', 'even', 'unintentional', 'Certain', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'downright', 'stupid', 'example', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'watching', 'freaking', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'Godsake', 'UUUUGGGGHHHHH', '..', 'decent', 'job', 'ripping', 'off', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'spirit', 'awesome', 'game.OVERALL', 'rental', 'maybe', 'even', 'buy', ""'re"", 'interested', 'enough', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'wowed', 'anything.THE', 'GOOD', 'Decent', 'gore', 'decent', 'ripping', 'first', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'movie', 'funny.THE', 'BAD', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'spirit', 'game', 'music', 'awful', 'movie', 'unintentionally', 'funny']",N/A
959086,A39J0B2XU8LH9T,B000CNER1S,AKO-1Critic4U,"[0, 1]","I recently went to the theater to see this video game turned into big screen production. Was I pleasantly surprised? Yes I was. The Rock who was an o.k. actor in the Scorpion King really did an excellent job as the intense tightly controlled Sarge. Carl Urban who played the protagonist against Matt Damons' character Jason Bourne in the Bourne Identity played a superb subdued good tough guy as Sarges' second in command. Also Rosamund Pike played a convincing research bio-chemist assistant and sister to Reaper(Carl Urban).Compared to the video game Doom3 that I found to be an excellent game for its realism including its depicton of Hell and overall playability that puts you in the middle of the action, it rounds out an otherwise incomprehensible plot that the video game cannot answer and won't. By the way, Doom3 is far superior than F.E.A.R. that was a waste of $60.00 on my part and something I will regret for a long time.Now Doom the movie is a well paced cinematic action flick. The special-effects are state of the art and utilized all in the right places except for the first-person shooter sequence that just didn't look right. Maybe the technology is not advanced enough yet? The monster-creatures were really grotesque and frightening. The blood and gore were never overwhelming and appropriately used.The tantalizing aspect of this film is the supposed nature of man. Is he(she) evil vs. good from birth or becomes that way by virtue of the environment? Alas, the screenplay-script indicates that there is an essence of evil in everyone including the very best of us. The difference being the degree of culpability which apparently starts above the 50% marker. Then you become a monster. Even Reaper admitted he was no angel.In summary, good movie.

Completely unoriginal but in its way entertaining. It's paced quite well with some atmospheric moments as the marines try to find out what's going on. The switch to FPS (First Person Shooter) mode as a homage to it's game roots is contrived and a bit pointless, but I suppose it seemed a good idea at the time. It does have flaws, at the beginning Sarge is sensitive enough to give the option of avoiding the mission to Reaper, one of his team who has bad memories of Mars, by the end he's a homicidal tyrant who's happy to shoot his own team members for disobedience. It also has a ""Sewer"" tunnel system that would have looked outdated in Victorian England, why is it on Mars and what the hell did they need a chain saw for, did you see any trees ?

The movie's finale includes a fantastic sequence designed to look just like a FPS game.  Not to mention, having the Rock turn into a villian and the other guy become a hero was a great twist.*The music score/soundtrack is awesome.The Bad Things*A very weak adaptation of the computer game.  The story line is totally different.  There are no scary demons and there is no Hell, just a bunch of ugly zombies on a martian base (albiet, the movie tried to keep up with the demonology by having people turn into demons; it is somewhat interesting).*The movie itself has a weak filming style.  It is very forgetable (save for the last 13 minutes) and indistinctive.  I found much of it dull and boring.Overall, this is like a B-rated flick with good special effects and it just happens to share the title of the computer game.

With that criteria in mind I wasn't disappointed by what I saw. The movie felt just like I thought it would. A close to two hour piece of popcorn fluff based off a video game franchise of the same thing.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is the headlining star of the film with Karl ""Eomer"" Urban playing a close second. The charisma of both actors is all this movie needs. Every other character in the movie either serves as demon-fodder or person-in-jeopardy. They help enough in moving the story (as basic a plot as there is) from one scary action sequence to the next. The special effects is mostly done with animatronics by the house that Stan Winston (FX master of such films like Aliens, Terminator, T2, Predator) built and it helped in making the demons and monster look real. For a film based on a video game this one has a minimum amount of CGI-effects outside of the first-person sequence in the closing part of the movie. That sequence straddles the fence between cool and cheesy but never seems to fall on either one. Just when it started to look laughable something cool happens that reminded me of the game.The way the film ended and changes in certain characters happened was a surprise to me. I wasn't expecting the film ending the way it did and I think that helped in making me enjoy it enough.

He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.It's not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It's just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that's it.  I'm sure the movie would've been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn't really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.Doom is the kind of movie you don't really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I'm sure you don't forget to rewind the tape because that's impolite.The Rock never should have left wrestling.

Then again, anything that involves the Rock and a naked portion of his anatomy is a fine piece...of cinema.And a movie too! Not a great movie, mind you, but still...those muscles, those beautiful white teeth, tho...oh, you wanted a review ON THE MOVIE.  Well, jeez, why didn't you say so.Let's see: Genetic Mutation. Words that are music to my ears. Of course, put genetic mutation and an incredible body in the same film and I'm certainly gonna be there. Honestly, this movie isn't as bad as it could be. The acting is pretty good, the special effects are passable, the story line is resonable, the Rock looks good. Really, really good.I liked the method of travel to Mars. I loved the nano door to the lab. Don't think I've ever see anything like it so between the 'ark' and the door, give 'em a few points for originality. Of course, you knew something was gonna get stuck in it before it was over. I liked a couple of the soldiers and was sorry when they got killed. We all cracked up when we realized one of the monsters was the guy in the wheelchair, not to sound heartless.This isn't an over the top, great work. It only gets the four stars cuz Dwayne looks so darn good in it. I'd have done the same for Diesel. Normally, I'd say let the kiddies have it but they really went overboard on the language. I mean, would it have hurt the film to eliminate the word ""f**k""?  Truly the word was vastly overworked here and parents are gonna start cringing before it's over if they're watching it with their children.Aside from that, it's a fun place to be for a brief time.

I expected this movie to be modeled on Doom 3. I like The Rock and Karl Urban. I really expected this movie to be true to the game. Not even vaguely. I would have thought with Doom III just completed, they could have used the game animations as a guide and simply do the CG route. I would never have expected animatronics and a totally different and unrelated plot. I have a lot of beefs with this movie and not much on likes. The famed ""FPS"" shot sequence would have been cool if the monsters had tried to actually kill Karl Urban but no, they were like the local haunted house players, careful not to touch him as he made his way through the touch less gauntlet. The Monsters are people mutated and gone bad using long dead ""humanoid"" DNA in nefarious experiments on condemned prisoners. Absolutely nothing to do with accidentally opening a portal to hell- NOTHING like the game... and there in lies my anger. The game was a better movie than the movie. The Rock's performance seems rushed and stereotypical and somehow he was poorly cast for this part. Karl Urban and his subtle, sullen character fits in well with the part but it's like a pale leftover performance from Riddick.

959111,AF3RMNRNRSG7W,B000CNER1S,Brynn Huxtable,"[11, 14]","I'm a big fan of the DOOM Game series and when I heard that a movie based on the game was coming out, I was delighted! When I had a look at the trailers and read some reviews in magazines, I was pretty much convinced that the storyline would be very similar to the games and books. But I was sorely mistaken...A Martian Research facility run by the United Aerospace Corporation (U.A.C) has been besieged by an unknown alien force. A team of Special Marines is sent in to investigate the mess and clean up any and all threats in the area. What they discover are horrible, mutated abominations that have been transformed by an extra G-nome (known as C-24)...that's where I have to hit the brakes I'm afraid. Mutants? The guys are sent in to take out mutated humans. That sounds more like Resident Evil! There are no demons, no portals to hell or mighty bosses in this movie...there are 3 types of monsters that appear in the movie, which are all actually nothing more than mutants. You get Zombies, ""Imps"" (I use that term lightly) and the Pinky ""Demon."" No Revenants, Cacodemons, Centaurs...basically this movie professes to be ""DOOM"", but it really isn't. The storyline is almost totally exclusive from the game series! Here are the similarities between the games and the movies:1) Weapons - We see the Enforcer Machine Gun and the token B.F.G, and that's it. No plasma guns or rocket launchers here. The games were about serious firepower and tonnes of violent action!2) Monsters - they look similar to the monsters in the game, but they're really very different in reality. It's just disappointing.3) Setting - Mars. What more can I say?4) One Character - Sarge A.K.A ""The Rock."" The other guys are just new marines and there's no Dr. Malcolm Betruger or Elliot Swan etc.The reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because the action is pretty cool and the First Person action sequence is great! There are some inspired moments in this film, even 1 or 2 interesting twists. It's alot of fun and there's a fair amount of violence and inter-human conflict. However, none of this excuses the fact that this film just isn't ""DOOM."" Perhaps if they had released the film under another name or just followed the storyline of the actual Games Series a bit more, this film would've been really great.The acting is convincing enough, the action fair and overall this is a fair film. If you love action movies, I'm certain you will enjoy this film. If you're a DOOM Games, books or whatever fan, I think you will be rather disappointed by this movie. That's why I'm going for a moderate stance in this review - if you're not a DOOM fan, then all I can say is that you should take the film for what it is and just enjoy it. If you are a DOOM fan, you can watch this film, but don't expect anything really interesting or true to the series to be in it. In short, decide for yourself. I would watch this again for the fun of it, but I would by no means buy the actual film.Overall, ""DOOM"" gets 55% from me because I am a fan of the original series. If you're a fan like me you can use this rating to gauge how much you may enjoy this film, but if you aren't a fan, just go watch or rent this movie and then decide if you want to buy it or B.F.G it into vapour...it's your choice...I personally don't think the film is spectacular, but it's not bad! Just go with your feelings and at the end of the day, that is the most important thing to remember.",3,DOOM!

It is based on the first ""DOOM"" game.DOOM's original storyline was that being portrayed in the film. The original story was that the UAC facility was working on developing the unmaped Martian chromosome which gave them the ability to control human emotions for different purposes. The only problem with the film was the final fight scene between ""REAPER"" and his C.O.(commanding officer) ""SARGE"". As well fought out as the scene was, I am concerned how Dwayne's character ""SARGE"" had obtained the superhuman abilities. I gave the movie 5 stars because that is the max on this site, if I could I would give it ten. This is a great movie. About the only thing I enjoyed more than having the ORIGNAL(ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)""DOOM"" story was the fact that they brought in the classic element from all ""DOOM"" games, the first person shooter scenes. I actually thought the whole of the movie was based in F.P.S. but none the less a great film. Like someone had said before, V.G. movies are not going to win any awards any time soon so just take the V.G. films the way they are made and hopefully you will like them. I agree a few of the acting spots were bad, and they left out quite a few of the monsters. I believe there were only two or three ""Hell Knights"", one or two ""Imp"" Demons. But I was glad to see they had my favorite Demon, ""Pinky"" was included in the film. The zombies were the great touch. There are only so many things you can do with a Zombie monster, but ""DOOM"" has proved yet again that, if you try hard enough to make something like the game, you could break and shatter every rule about Zombies and even make a few new ones.And for anyone who thought ""DOOM"" was a waste of money, the next time you have a thought....just let it go. Because chances are your wrong about something you probably havent even seen. Because everyone has their own taste in movies, if you heard a friend saying you know ""Oh, DOOM sucked completely man. It was a waste of my McDonalds paycheck at $2.50 a day to even go see it"", just keep in mind that everyone is different. Your friend might say it blew wind, you might go see it and be amazed by it like I was.

They're not even worth the celluloid they're on basically. So where does Doom fit? Well, it's not awesome that's for sure. But then again, it's not really terrible. And that's quite surprising, you would think that it would obviously be stupid but then you find yourself enjoying all the gory mayhem and go ""huh, look at that, this film ain't so bad.""A distress signal is sent from a research facility on Mars so a special squad is sent in to retrieve any survivors and neutralize any threat. Shall I go on? Cause that's pretty much it. Soldiers are sent in, they find weirdness, weirdness happens to have teeth and claws, soldiers die and they have to make it out alive.The first 2 Doom games had massive amounts of enemies coming at you so essentially it was a more fast paced game. Doom3 in many ways was like a Resident Evil on Mars. More slower, atmosphere and eerie, the game in a way toned down the ""soldier sent to kick Hell in the balls"" angle to the quiet angle. Well the film follows that route. It's darkly lit, and things go bump in the night suddenly then take off. So in a way it's not the game but it's no Doom3 either.Where is it Doom though? Of course the First-Person shooter scene where a Marine kicks a bunch of demon *** for around 4-5 minutes. This scene was more fun than probably the entirety of the film. It was quite funny at times too such as bringing out the sniper scope, a chainsaw and grenades. It's odd in the special features where they say the DVD can put in the full scene and they show the scene, yet it's the exact same thing that's in the movie. Huh?What can you expect from the rest of the film? Gore, slight nakedness, bad lines, overdone performances, weak character development and really dark hallways. You know, just like many of the recent ""horror"" films. Granted Doom3 was really poorly lit too but at least it helped the game. Here it's like ""I can't see a thing, where's the lighting guy?""The only time I played Doom was playing Doom 2 many years ago, cheat codes on and blazing infinite ammo all over the place. It was fun but at the same time taking on demons wasn't my thing. Zelda, Final Fantasy and Metal Gear Solid however...here's hoping they don't do a MGS movie though, games are movie-like enough.

959121,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B000CNER1S,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[4, 11]","'Doom' disappoints in a major way, plain and simple. Despite the games having a very simple premise, the film still could have been very good. The special effects were over the top, the monsters few and far between and the little screen time that they had was shot so dark and brief that the audience barely had a clue as to what was happening.Ironically it shouldn't be that hard to make a decent film out of the Doom games, all they needed to do was throw lots of different demons from hell at the sole protagonist after killing off most of the marines early on, since that would be an accurate and effective translation of the first game. 'Doom' could have been great if they would have made it similar to 'Starship Troopers', with some exposition but a heavy focus on the action.  As it stands, 'Doom' has lots of exposition that goes nowhere, hence it is all wasted on characters nobody cares about, not to mention that the story does nothing to explain anything.  It is nonsensical at best.The 'Doom' storyline is not deep by any means, but its simplicity had the potential of being put to good use as a thrilling, scary adventure, much like the games themselves.Another major problem of the movie was that none of the characters were likeable, Reaper was about the only one that I didn't despise. Too much time was wasted on setting up the marines who were never charismatic from beginning to end. Virtually no mention of hell or demons, no actual hell dimensional portal, and very few of the demons from the original games made this movie terrible, not to mention Dwayne Johnson's terrible overacting. He's respectable in other films but in this one he just seemed to be doing his old World Wrestling Entertainment 'The Rock' character, and I half-expected him to say ""can you smell what the rock is cooking"" at several points in the film. His constant frown and raised eyebrow was laughable and I never found him intimidating nor convincing in this film. This character was in heavy contrast to his two other good movies, 'The Rundown' and 'Walking Tall', in which he was quite intimidating and did a much better job acting. I guess he just had a hard time finding inspiration for his character portrayal in 'Doom'.Hollywood obviously does not understand video game stories and therefore they fail in translating them onto the big screen 99% of the time. About the only movie that I felt they adapted well from a video game was the first 'Mortal Kombat', not to be confused with its terrible sequel. They kept it simple, stayed true to the game, picked a good cast that embodied the essence of the characters and didn't deviate from the story. It was by no means a great movie, but it was entertaining and fans of the games, which I was at the time, enjoyed it because we felt we were watching the game come to life in a realistic and authentic fashion.'Doom' could have been like 'Mortal Kombat', a fun movie adaption of a well-established video game franchise, but they botched it by trying to make a copy of the 'Resident Evil' movies.  This approach is ridiculous for two reasons: 'Resident Evil' was not faithful to the game, and it wasn't that good of a film.Most fans of the games will probably be disappointed as this movie does not feel or even look like the games, nor does it stay very close to the original storyline.  Terrible acting, bad cinematograpy, weak and silly script and an almost complete avoidance of using the elements that made the games popular in the first place completely destroy this film.It's not scary, funny, thrilling or any other possible redeeming quality.  Even the action offers nothing new except for a short first person perspective, which did not add much to the overall enjoyment.

I expected wooden acting, fake-looking monsters, and a by-the-book plot.  Well, the plot is what you'd expect (if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all, and so forth), but the monsters are genuinely disturbing, if not outright terrifying, and the acting is much better than would be expected.  Also, there are some unique plot twists that help raise this movie above its peers.  Is ""Doom"" the absolute best sci-fi/action/horror movie ever?  Nope.  It's not as revolutionary as its namesake, but it IS a darned good popcorn flick, and much better than many of its kind.

959124,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000CNER1S,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 1]","Maybe it's partly because I'm old enough to remember when Doom was the gaming experience of a lifetime and partly because I can't get enough of seeing The Rock layeth the smacketh down on any sentient being, but I loved Doom.  I wasn't all that confident at the beginning, though.  You've got like seven or eight soldiers going in to the battle zone, and that made me wonder how they were going to string this thing out for an hour and forty five minutes.  Then there's the fact that the movie drastically rewrites the whole Doom story from the origin of the alien creatures to the manner in which things ultimately play out.  Lest I forget, you also have a couple of incredibly annoying characters you have to put up with and just hope they are among the first to die.  When all was said and done, though, there was no doubt that I had enjoyed the heck out of this movie.  It wasn't so much all the blood and gore (although blood and gore are always important) as it was the intelligence of the script.  Stay with me now, and let me explain.  I'm talking context here, and in the context of a cinematic adaptation of a first-person shooter video game, this script is rather exceptional.  The original Doom storyline was changed for a purpose here - and it made for a much better film than it might have been otherwise by taking us beyond a superficial battle of good vs. monstrous evil and allowing for things to play out somewhat differently than I was expecting.  The brother-sister relationship (and let me just thank the filmmakers for not putting some kind of trite romance into the mix) that stands near the heart of the story also plays into the conclusion quite well (and, dare I say it, leaves a little wiggle room for a sequel).While Doom the film isn't just about killing monsters, that's certainly its raison detre - and it does it quite well.  Actually, I would have preferred a lot more violence and a few more monsters, but the film does deliver a satisfying number of violent killings on both sides of the conflict.  I wouldn't have complained about more usage of the BFG, either (and isn't it nice to hear this weapon called by its true name?).  The movie never really approaches any sort of suspense, but the attacks and counter-attacks we do see are quite acceptable.  I was a bit disappointed by one decapitation shot, however, as I didn't even realize it was a decapitation until I saw the headless body on the floor.  Still, I have no real complaints about the level of violence I saw here - or the special effects.  Sure, most of the action is computer-generated, but it's really well done.In a sense, the movie is on the predictable side, yet events didn't play out quite the way I expected them to - and that counts a lot in terms of my personal evaluation.  I also appreciated the sequence in which we view the action from a true first-person perspective - for those few minutes, it almost feels like you're playing a fantastic, futuristic version of the game.  Younger folks who never played the game or experienced the thrill of the Doom phenomenon may not appreciate it like us slightly older folks, but I'm sure they'll still find the sequence pretty darn cool.  And even if they don't, they still have The Rock to entertain them (although I must say I was a little disappointed that we couldn't get at least one People's Eyebrow in there somewhere).  I can't really judge The Rock's acting ability based on this film, as it frankly doesn't require a lot more than acting big and bad all the time, but he certainly comes across as the right man for the role of Sarge.Obviously, I think Doom is an underrated movie.  You expect a lot of big guns, monsters, and gore - and you get them.  You get so much more, however, in terms of the storyline - and that is why I find this film so impressive.",5,Finally ...

959125,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B000CNER1S,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[0, 3]","There's this great song by Godsmack which opens with someone whispering ""what do you see in the dark when the Demons come for you?""""Doom"" manages to ask that same question, only in reverse: what do you see in the dark when the Demons don't show up?Answer: you see ""Doom"", Andrzej Bartkowiak's stunningly tedious little cinematic exegesis on the slaughterfest drug-disguised-as-videogame that revolutionized Gaming As We Know It and may very well have fuelled the home PC craze.In a word, ""Doom"" kicked everybody's a** when it came out.The premise is simple: you're a hellbent-for-leather, tough-as-nails, locked-and-loaded Colonial Space Marine. Things have gone way south on a research base on Mars---or was it the Martian moon Phobos?---anyhoo, communications are dead, and the situation is totally FUBAR. You're sent to clean it up.You get hyper-jumped into the Phobos base, and mutated bloodthirsty zombies and demons and flesh-and-steel monstrosities in the thousands come to rip your face off. You blow them back into Hell. Rinse. Repeat. Boo-yah!Now: the formula for ""Doom"" wasn't anything profound, but it worked: it was pure, raw, nerve-rattling, brain-boggling adrenaline.Raw, pulsing adrenaline. The Gnomes at Id Software had found that magical servo, written it into gaming code, and hardwired it into our fitfully slumbering Reptile Brain.If you played ""Doom"", you found yourself, say, at about 11:00 P.M., with a load of schoolwork piled on the couch behind you, jacked into your computer, a sheen of sweat coating your greasy, slack-jawed, whey-skinned face. I swear to God, you said---just this level---just this next corridor---just to the Research Lab, honest to god, and then I'm going to go study/sleep/work.At 5 in the morning, you were still blasting Pinky Demons and dodging Imp Fireballs, and praying your boss/professor/chick-of-the-moment would understand, even as wan morning-light was feebly forcing its way through the blinds and curtains.So: when ""Doom"" first reared its ugly head, I wasn't expecting much. I didn't need much. I needed a few ready-for-bear, growing-and-spitting Space Marines. I needed a massed, hungry army of demons and hellspawn mutants, Stygian sinew fused cruelly with state-of-the-art Phobos military technology. I needed shotguns, and rocket launchers, and most definitely the BFG, laying waste to huge chunks of the Demon Horde and Martian real estate alike.Most importantly, I needed lots of slaughter. I wanted to be knee-deep in the Dead. What did I get with the cinematic ""Doom""?1)There's very little to see---no seriously, this flick is Dark, as in it's underlit. If you spy a monster---and God knows, I was all eyes!---you'd better not blink, or you'll miss it.And the Phobos base comes off as your late-night Kansas City cheapo haunted house---lots of blind alleys and stairways and ramps and sh*t. Hell, we might as well be following the Rock (who plays ""Sarge"") through the local poultry warehouse.2) Turn off the Ultraviolence. Yep, ""Doom"" the movie is definitely toggled over to the ""Don't Hurt Me"" setting: we get a little gore thrown our way, but it's so minimal, so begrudging, and so tightly edited, that it might as well not be there at all.3) No Demons. Yeah, let's make a flick about marines slaughtering Demons on Mars and---well, skip the demons. Something about genomes and a propensity to evil. If I'd wanted to see a flick about socio-genetics, I'd have stayed in school. Bah Humbug.4) Oh, and no Hell. Did I mention that? ""Doom"" without a gateway to Hell.So---this review could go on. I could talk about Stan Winston fighting the good fight, doing some good critter prosthetics---and from what I could see of them, they *are* good. I could talk about The Rock's squinchy uni-brow. I could talk about how Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike (fraternal twins, according to the plot---a sort of spacefaring Sisters Grimm) spend much of the flick looking painfully constipated.I could even spend a few sentences yakking it up about the first-person shooter segment, meant as a nod to the fans, coming across as something you might see in a more desperate spookhouse at the Wichita County Fair.Or I could just say ""Avoid"", and be done with it.Game Over.JSG",1,Access Denied,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,4223,"['great', 'song', 'Godsmack', 'someone', 'whispering', 'what', 'do', 'see',

Let's face it the video game to movie films haven't been the cream of the crop yet.  No one has really hit the right note to make them appeal to a wider audience as several comic movies have done.  Surprisingly though it turned out to be a fairly enjoyable, soldiers hunting and being hunted by monsters, flick.I never mind changes made to these types of movies (video game, comics, ect...) so long as the essence is maintained and the end product is entertaining.  Even though our monsters don't come directly from Hell, they do come from human evil which is close enough and a slightly more interesting plot device that, at one point, becomes a major plot point about the morality of one of the characters.  Of course the whole, it's a virus and it's genetics, plots are getting a bit old these days and don't necessarily make any more sense than a Hell portal but I can live with it.  We still end up with big ugly monsters who want to eat your spleen and that's the end result we want.The characters were fleshed out well enough for us to care that they were being carved up by ugly monsters (well there was one that you might not care about) and they all contributed to the plot with individual side stories.  Overall much more depth than expected.The Rock's acting impressed me as well.  Sure all he had to do was act big and bad, but that's what he does in almost all movies he's in and if you compare this with his acting in Scorpion King it's much better.  His character also gives us a pretty cool twist in the end I didn't immediately predict so that was nice.Lastly, the video game like first person shooter perspective scene in the movie was certainly interesting.  It is a more than 5 minute scene that puts you in the eye perspective of a character as he travels a base and kills monsters on the way and it pays direct tribute to the games.  I have a feeling people will either love it or not, like liver.  It seemed a cool scene but also distracted from the narrative of the story as it was unlike any other in the movie.

Pretty much everything I know about the original video game came from wikipedia.And yet, even I know what that the movie ""Doom"" doesn't have a lot in common with its source material. But even taken on its own, this movie is kind of a mess -- Karl Urban is one of the few bright spots in an ugly, dragging story that seems to be taking cues from ""Resident Evil."" By the time it grinds to its predictable ending, you'll wish someone would pick up the BFG and shoot the camera.When a research facility on Mars suddenly goes quiet, a squad of space marines are sent in, led by Sarge (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). The goal is to neutralize the threat and allow Dr. Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike) to recover the genetic data the scientists left behind -- which doesn't sit well with her brother John aka ""Reaper"" (Karl Urban) who happens to be on the team.But things go dramatically wrong right away -- the scientists have gone mad, mutated and/or transformed into grotesque creatures. And in true horror movie style, they immediately begin picking off the marines one by one. As Samantha tries to unravel the secret of the extra chromosomes that caused this disaster, Reaper finds that the biggest threat may be from his own team.Andrzej Bartkowiak is one of those directors who just does everything wrong whenever somebody lets him sit in a director's chair -- and he has a special talent for ruining preexisting franchises. Right from the beginning, ""Doom"" is depressingly mediocre, with a lurching, sludgy pace that tries to use jump scares and graphic gore to distract you.Not that I could see half of the jump scares and gore, because Andrzej Bartkowiak apparently decided to save money by never turning on the lights. Perhaps he means for this to be symbolic, especially given the amount of clunky hell/devil/demon references he sprinkles in there... but I suspect it has more to do with really bad direction.But the script is even worse. Movie science tends to be unrealistic at best, but this one introduces a pair of extra chromosomes that give superstrength, super-healing and super-intelligence... instead of, you know, massive birth defects. The most ridiculous part is when we're told that THERE IS A GENE FOR EVIL.It doesn't help that not a single character in this movie is likable. Karl Urban gives a fairly decent performance as the suitably-named Grimm, but his character is still bossy and humorless. Most of the others are either faceless cannon fodder or despicable jerks. We have a drug-addled teenager, a lecherous pedophile, and the charmingly nondescript Rock (whose character only acquires a personality near the end... and it's a hammy one).""Doom"" pretty much describes itself with that title -- a doomed movie that Bartkowiak hammered into the ground in every artistic way.

In an attempt to add a 24th pair of chromosones to the human genome, scientists accidentaly created a creature that infects individuals depending on the good/evil ratio of the person's soul. It is a strange premise and rationel to explain away the events of the film when the video game plot was so very simple. Still, I think the movie really captured the look and feel of Doom 3 and added a lot more. The military squad characters are all very good and the final battle between good and evil is very removed from the DOOM theology but it fits the story well and kinda makes DOOM into a fighting game like Mortal Kombat. And for the DOOM fans that think they know everything about the mythology, this movie does throw some interesting twists and turns at you during the script of the film. And on aq final note, The Rock is really good in this film cuz you get to see two different sides of the character he plays. Karl Urban is great too in the lead HERO roll.

Only occasionally do they enter a room with lighting and stray long enough for us to see what's going on.  Like Glinda, they travel to Mars by bubble (actually a very cool effect they underuse).  Things instantly go awry once the Marines land and takeover.  The body count is vast, the bulk of it done off screen or in the dark.  They gloss over the fact that children were killed.  The range of acting is all over the place, from the wacky pervert Corporal (Richard Brake) to the customary religious nut who cuts himself as penance (Ben Daniels).  Karl Urban, as Staff Sergeant Reaper Grimm, actually does a decent job as opposed to THE Rock who goes from point Z to Z.z during the course of this  movie (one scowl fits all and every occasion).  I've often wondered, is THE his first name and Rock his last?  (Anytime you refer to yourself with a qualifier you run the risk of being identified as such.)Not great, but it does provide a good waste of time and it's worthy to watch again (with a better second feature).

The music, the bloodstained walls, the smears of matter and inards on the walls. I really didn't get that in the film. I mean how could anyone?5.

959143,A3S1YIQQW7AZO,B000CNER1S,EMAN NEP,"[0, 0]","Here we go again. Another movie based off a video game. By now I think people are wary of this genre but for some reason Hollywood thinks it's still worth the effort. Thankfully Doom is much better (in my opinion) than other video-game to movie efforts. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within being a fine example of how not to do it.I have to give Doom credit for its DOOMNESS. The exaggeratedly huge weapons, the dark, creepy environments, the twisted monsters, the experiments gone awry and so on. They really captured the feeling of the game with this one. And the first-person scene was nostalgic without being too gratuitous or drawn-out.But, unlike some video games, movies require a bit more of a plot and this is where Doom has its shortcomings. The whole ""experiment gone awry"" plot has been used to death, in games and in movies, but what's worse is that they had to try and explain it in scientific terms. Please, stop pretending to be something that you're not. Doom is not a thinking man's game, neither should it be a thinking man's movie.I personally think that ""Predator"" and ""Aliens"" are some of the greatest action films ever. What prevents Doom from joining those ranks is when they tried to EXPLAIN everything. WHY were the humans turning into monsters, in scienctific terms (that 24th chromosome jibberish). ""Predator"", if you recall, had none of that, just a bunch of rough, tough special forces guys tearing the place up and getting torn up in return by some alien from . . . somewhere--it was never important why or how it got there.Speaking of ""Predator"", the black guy in ""Doom"" that wields the huge mini-gun-type weapon almost looked like Bill Duke, don't you think?Then, Doom has the ""morale debate"", like in ""Saving Private Ryan"". Is it moral to kill people that may or may not turn into zombies? Last time I spotted a crazy scientist while playing Doom 3 that thought never entered my mind--I just shot him.Overall, not a really great movie, but not a really bad one, either. Or, in Doom terms, I'd say that this movie finished the level with 0 armor, 50% health, and a full clip in the machine gun.",3,HEALTH = 50,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,2125,"['Here', 'go', 'again', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'video', 'game', 'now', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'wary', 'genre', 'reason', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'worth', 'effort', 'Thankfully', 'Doom', 'much', 'better', 'opinion', 'other', 'video-game', 'movie', 'efforts', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'being', 'fine', 'example', 'how', 'not', 'do', 'it.I', 'have', 'give', 'Doom', 'credit', 'DOOMNESS', 'exaggeratedly', 'huge', 'weapons', 'dark', 'creepy', 'environments', 'twisted', 'monsters', 'experiments', 'gone', 'awry', 'so', 'really', 'captured', 'feeling', 'game', 'one', 'first-person', 'scene', 'was', 'nostalgic', 'being', 'too', 'gratuitous', 'drawn-out.But', 'video', 'games', 'movies', 'require', 'bit', 'more', 'plot', 'where', 'Doom', 'shortcomings', 'whole', 'experiment', 'gone', 'awry', 'plot', 'been', 'used', 'death', 'games', 'movies', 'what', 'worse', 'had', 'try', 'explain', 'scientific', 'terms', 'Please', 'stop', 'pretending', 'be', 'something', ""'re"", 'not', 'Doom', 'not', 'thinking', 'man', 'game', 'should', 'be', 'thinking', 'man', 'movie.I', 'personally', 'think', 'Predator', 'Aliens', 'are', 'greatest', 'action', 'films', 'ever', 'What', 'Doom', 'joining', 'ranks', 'when', 'tried', 'EXPLAIN', 'everything', 'were', 'humans', 'turning', 'monsters', 'scienctific', 'terms', '24th', 'chromosome', 'jibberish', 'Predator', 'recall', 'had', 'none', 'just', 'bunch', 'rough', 'tough', 'special', 'forces', 'guys', 'tearing', 'place', 'up', 'getting', 'torn', 'up', 'return', 'alien', 'somewhere', 'was', 'never', 'important', 'why', 'how', 'got', 'there.Speaking', 'Predator', 'black', 'guy', 'Doom', 'huge', 'mini-gun-type', 'weapon', 'almost', 'looked', 'like', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Then', 'Doom', 'morale', 'debate', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'moral', 'kill', 'people', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'turn', 'zombies', 'Last', 'time', 'spotted', 'crazy', 'scientist', 'playing', 'Doom', '3', 'thought', 'never', 'entered', 'mind', 'just', 'shot', 'him.Overall', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'one', 'Doom', 'terms', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'finished', 'level', '0', 'armor', '50', '%', 'health', 'full', 'clip', 'machine', 'gun']",N/A

HAMILTON "".: Just Folks""","[1, 4]","This attempt begins on a promising note with the distinct StarTrekian feeling of the Borg in the opening artwork and sequence.Quickly; however, it shifts into ConAir/Resident Evil mode.  This would not be a bad thing if it had not bore the sense of being enacted by the stand-ins and stunt-doubles of the original Predator cast.Nothing about this movie was original.  Aliens on Mars is not new, fresh, or innovative.  Monster aliens on Mars is not new, fresh, or innovative.  Killer aliens taking out the principles whose only goal is to keep them from reaching Earth is not new...well, you get the idea.Once our would-be heroes/ines reach Mars, the Resident Evil/Aliens/28 Days Later filter is firmly set in place, and remains cemented over the camera lens for the duration of the work.The Rock is obvious, stiff, and awkward.  Half the words coming out of his mouth are delivered as though written for someone else, and executed by the man behind the curtain via a sadistic puppet master against the Rock's will.Their ""ark"" was more or less an odd blend of ideologies from Time Cop-meets-The One-meets-Stargate.  The ""bucket down the stairs"" scene was decidedly Tolkienesque.  There were reminders of Dean Koontz novels, Leviathon, the Sphere, and about a million other movies.The one innovation to be found in this work is the NanoWall.  While nano-technology certainly is not new, I was first introduced to nanites in a Star Trek [NG] episode over a decade ago, but the nanowall was [to this reviewer's memory] at least a creative use of those technologies.The remainder of the cast was unremarkable, but somehow, this move was [at worst] moderately enjoyable and [at best] contained action almost as good as Shawn of the Dead [for what that's worth].I wanted to say also that, while the photography and angles were great, and the CGI and physical costuming exceeded acceptable, the story was inhibited.  The execution was amateurishly delivered, and the final product felt more or less like an insane film editor broke into the Sci-Fi Channel's vaults and locked himself in, splicing together several great movies, leaving out the best parts, and thereby producing a mediocre mess of metal scenes to which there is no accompanying music.  Only that could have made it worse.Decent only if it's Friday/Saturday night, you're home alone, and there's suddenly no cable.This review refers to the Unrated Widescreen Edition.

With all the literature of the world, all the fine screenplays that are stacked on the shelves, all the creative stories that languish in the 'not for profit probably' bins, it seems a raw commentary on today's movie audiences to spend millions of dollars on a game everyone who cares already knows.  But, movies are business and box office demands take precedence.As the narrator of the film states, 'In the year 2026 archaeologists working in the Nevada desert discovered a portal to an ancient city on Mars. They call this portal the Ark. Twenty years later, we're still struggling to understand why it was built and what happened to the civilization that built it' is the apparent 'story'. What follows is a series of conflicts between killers transforming into beasts right out of Hieronymous Bosch and Francis Bacon only to bloody up the claustrophobic computer generated interiors with occasional transmogrifications into mercurial clouds only to reappear.  Much slaughter, much eye dazzling color manipulation, and ever so little story line fill the screen.  The participants in this real time game are The Rock (he needs a role that uses his talent), hunky Karl Urban, Dexter Fletcher, Rosamond Pike, and Richard Brake - all squashed around the set by director and head gladiator Andrej Bartkowiak.Though not meant to be, this film can actually be fun to watch as a hilarious parody of scientific world events.

The Rock as the marine sentdown to investigate the going ons at a scientificfacility is pretty good.I know critics panned the movie but it has somebrights spots, at least the gore and some scenes weredone with some effort, the other parts are not, buteven then you can laugh your butt about them. Itwas kinda funny to see the scientist in the beginninguse keycards (like the game) to escape, it looksmuch cooler in the game than in the movie.Andrzej Bartkowiak does a fair job but I probablywouldn't be excited about his next movie.Rosamund Pike who is Samantha Grimm , another scientistin the movie is pretty darn watchable though likethe role for the most part takes the role seriously.The special effects were average but I guess enoughfor some people. Maybe they could have used more goreor instead of using the computer effects for somecreatures done more prostetic work.In short though due was an ok movie but not somethingI would shell it money for on DVD, it ain't that goodand will never be except for die hard gamers who wantedto see their game on movie screen.",2,Couldn't be much worse or better,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,1727,"[""'ll"", 'certainly', 'not', 'worse', 'House', 'Dead', 'avideo', 'game', 'movie', 'release', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'there', 'arecertain', 'parts', 'Doom', 'liked', 'cheesy', 'wayalso', 'House', 'better', 'acting.The', 'Rock', 'straight', 'most', 'part', 'sensinghe', 'took', 'seriously', 'am', 'surprised', 'themovie', 'obviously', 'geared', 'laughs', 'using', 'videogame', 'fan', 'audience', 'who', ""'ll"", 'practically', 'buy', 'anything.Doom', 'course', 'based', 'classic', 'game', 'ID', 'Softwarewhich', 'took', 'game', 'industry', 'parents', 'storm.Despite', 'being', 'outdated', 'game', 'made', 'thousands', 'dollarsand', 'game', 'Doom', 'went', 'history', 'one', 'morenostalgic', 'games', 'ever', 'Rock', 'marine', 'sentdown', 'investigate', 'going', 'ons', 'scientificfacility', 'pretty', 'good.I', 'know', 'critics', 'panned', 'movie', 'somebrights', 'spots', 'least', 'gore', 'scenes', 'weredone', 'effort', 'other', 'parts', 'are', 'not', 'buteven', 'then', 'can', 'laugh', 'butt', 'Itwas', 'kinda', 'funny', 'see', 'scientist', 'beginninguse', 'keycards', 'game', 'escape', 'looksmuch', 'cooler', 'game', 'movie.Andrzej', 'Bartkowiak', 'fair', 'job', 'probablywould', ""n't"", 'be', 'excited', 'next', 'movie.Rosamund', 'Pike', 'who', 'Samantha', 'Grimm', 'scientistin', 'movie', 'pretty', 'darn', 'watchable', 'likethe', 'role', 'most', 'part', 'role', 'seriously.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'average', 'guess', 'enoughfor', 'people', 'Maybe', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'goreor', 'instead', 'using', 'computer', 'effects', 'somecreatures', 'done', 'more', 'prostetic', 'work.In', 'short', 'due', 'was', 'ok', 'movie', 'not', 'somethingI', 'would', 'shell', 'money', 'DVD', 'ai', ""n't"", 'goodand', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'die', 'hard', 'gamers', 'who', 'wantedto', 'see', 'game', 'movie', 'screen']",N/A

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Doom is the most recent cinematic rendering mined from the video game industry and, like all films with a horror element,  it's better viewed in the dark.  A Marine squad responds to a frenzied call for help from a research facility on Mars and comes face to face with monsters. Led by the intense, military-to-the-core Sarge (the Rock), the marines must prevent the ravening demons from accessing ""the Ark"" teleportation device and gaining entry to our world.Dusted off from the science-run-amok department, Doom is yet another cautionary sci-fi/horror tale, replete with hackneyed characters, familiar uglies in the dark and a formulaic storyline. Somehow, though, I found myself having a good time watching this one. The Rock isn't about to win an Oscar or Emmy any time soon but his alpha male screen presence is undeniable. Karl Urban does yeoman's work as the conflicted John Grimm (codenamed Reaper), adding some depth to his kickass marine character. Icy Rosamund Pike (from James Bond's Die Another Day) detachedly plays Samantha, a forensic archaeologist and Reaper's sister. But she's nice to look at.If you've already seen the vastly superior Aliens or even Resident Evil, then Doom will hold no surprises. Heck, even if you haven't seen the above movies, Doom still won't catch you unawares. Still, there's a tiny morality play acted out just before the film's climax that kinda came out of left field, as well as an unexpected arc of one of the leads that I didn't see coming. The much touted first person shooter segment is pretty cool and places the audience smack-dabbed into the Doom video game universe.The special features aren't shabby: an extended first-person shooter sequence, as well as its ""making of"" segment; an amusing ""Game On!"" piece gives the viewer strategies and tips on how to play Doom 3; ""Basic Training With the Rock"" shows how the cast underwent a special forces mini-boot camp; and the nostalgic ""Doom Nation"" details the history of the various Doom video games and their effect on gamers and fans. I wish, though, that the Rock, Karl Urban or Rosamund Pike had done a film commentary.Gamers and other fans familiar with Dooms 1,2 and 3 are understandably upset that the movie version strayed so far from the games' original story.

959154,A3IF5BJFPH8OG5,B000CNER1S,Hectic,"[2, 6]","I went to the theaters to see this, and like most people, I didn't expect too much.  (Good thing)  Now I have only been a fan of the most recent Doom game, DOOM 3. (For PC)  This movie is loosely based on the entire Doom franchise, not just 1 specific game.  As others have said, the main difference in the movie and the games are that the games deal with actual demons and hell, the movie deals with people who have been turned into a ""demon-esk"" creature because of an engineered alien gene and ""hell"" that exists inside the mind.  (Not actual HELL)  For the most part, I found this movie to be mostly satisfying.  The look of the movie was a lot like Doom 3, with a storyline made from bits and pieces of all three games, with alittle different material written in.  Keeping all this in mind, and I hope that someone that works at a movie studio is reading, Here are guidelines to make a good movie adaptaion.  The only way a movie adapted from a video game, book, comic book, whatever is going to be successful is if they stay true to the source material!  I don't know why the movie studios don't pick up on this!  Look at the movie adaptations out there that have done well, and the ones that have flopped.  (I'm not listing the good and the bad, but think about it for a minute and you can come up with a huge list for both sides)  The ones that were successful stayed true to the original material, while the ones that flopped went down on some wild tangent that barely connected to the original material at all!  There can be exceptions.  If the story is good, and I mean really good, some facts and info from the source material can be changed. (Usually as long as they're minor points)  However, if you change around any major point, fact, whatever; no matter how good the story is the movie will tank!  Take the upcoming Halo movie for example.  I read multiple articles about how Microsoft's production team for the game is heavily involved in every aspect of the production of the movie.  They want to make sure that the movie studios stay true to their original material in the game.  (So when the movie comes out, it won't suck!)  Tell me I'm wrong!

959158,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B000CNER1S,Ian,"[1, 2]","What's with the title you ask?  Oh, i'll let you see and find out *smiles**This review contains some spoilers (which are warned about ahead of time)*On a remote research center on mars, a genetic experiment has gone wrong.  Now...blah, blah, blah, yata, yata, get to the big guns already.Doom is a movie about two things.  One:  Killing things.  Two:  Killing things with bigger guns.  And the movie succeds at seeting out to do what it does.  Kill things.Very (very) loosly based off the famous videogame franchise of the same name, Doom follows some marines as they go to Mars to stop a viral outbreak from turning everyone into zombie like creatures.  Hmm...that sounds like resident evil.  Anyway, we've got the usual loadout of marines armed with big guns(including the BFG) who seek, as the rock says, ""to kill anything that moves"".And kill it they do.  Doom has lots of blood, gore, and bullets flying all over the place.  We've got big guns, lots of bullets, and lots of things dying.  Doom sets out to show us things getting killed by riddling them with bullets, and it does a bang up job of doing so.  Heck, even the famous chainsaw makes a cameo apperance.In addition to killing lots of things, Doom also manages to create a great and creepy atmosphere.  We've got lots of dark, abandoned corridors filled with steam, dark blue lighting (it works very well), and creepy sounds coming from somewhere just ahead.  There are also a few really good scares, including one that chilled me to the bone.  Thumbs up to the atmosphere the movie creates.While most supporting charachters in these kind of movies are simply monster fodder, the marines in this movie actually last longer, and are more interesting then other B grade monster movies.  When a guy gets attacked early on, he actually fights back and lives, rather then dies, as is the industry standard.  Likewise, a defenseless marine puts up a really good fight against a foe who is much more powerful then he is.  The main charachters, the rock, and Karl Urban, are perfect in the roles they play.  The rock is perfectly belivable (and has a big suprise halfway through the movie), and Karl Urban is perfect as Grimm reaper.The plot may be pretty generic, but there is a great plot twist halfway through that greatly suprsied me, raising a serious moral question that most movies don't touch upon, yet in Doom it's done expertly and really makes you think.And yes, there's a first person sequence in the movie.  Does it work?  Well...it feels like one of those haunted houses at a carnival, but yes, it works.But...this isint doom.  Yes, it's set on mars, and some monsters from the game make it in, but it's just not doom.  The choice of monsters they pulled from the game (Doom 3) are weak, and disapointing.  There are only *spoiler warning!  Spoiler warning!*2 zombies, five Imps (who never once throw a fireball), a Pinkey, and a Hell Knight.  That's right.  There's no Caceodemons.  There's no spider mastermind.  There's no Cyberdemon!  Why?!  Why is there no Cyberdemon in a Doom movie?!  It makes no logical sense!*End spoiler warning  End spoiler warning!*The monsters that were chosen to make it into the movie were not very good choices, and could be improved a lot.The biggest issue I have with the movie is it's climax.  No, i'm not going to tell you what it is, but it's WAY out of place.  This is a Doom movie, a movie that (should) be filled with Doom monsters, Doom demons, and big guns (oh wait, they've already got those!), and we've got...this?

I'm stuck in a hotel, with precious little English language programming so it seemed like a good buy.I've read all the bad reviews and have debated buying this movie for a while. I like sci-fi and am a modest fan of Karl Urban. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to realize that The Rock is in desperate need of acting lessons, but did any of us buy this movie under the suspicion that the Academy somehow overlooked this movie for an Oscar?I didn't think so.That said, I found this a really fun ride of a movie. I played Doom for all of about 10 minutes once, so I can't really speak for how well or poorly it stuck to the game's story. I can say it did sort of lean too heavily towards Resident Evil's storyline and, from the other reviews, unnecessarily so since the game's premise was different and likely could have stood on its own.Good tension buildup through a couple of points, good use of lighting and scenery - very reminiscent of Aliens, but too close to Resident Evil to really make it stick with me. I took one star off for that and another off for The Rock's performance.

959167,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000CNER1S,Jason W. Kaiser,"[0, 0]","God this movie was fun!!! Awesome special effects, kick-ass guns, non-stop action, lots and lots of blood and gore, intense monsters and zombies, what more could you ask for? Good acting and a plot you say? Nope, not here, and you know what, who cares!! If anybody went into this expecting good acting and a plot I'm thinkin' they never played the game. The game has always been in-your-face, raw power, great visuals and lots of violence, and you want this in the movie version, and boy do you get it, and then some. Quick question, how many GOOD movies have we had that were derived from video games? Hmmmm, let's list shall we?1.Streetfighter, terrible 2.Super Mario Brothers, even more terrible 3.Alone In The Dark, just plain bad 4.House Of The Dead,  one of the worst movies ever made, oh, by the way, a sequel is in the works, god help us 5.Resident Evil 1 and 2, well, I liked these alot, but there were alot of negatives said about it. I'm sure I missed some, plus we have more on the way, Spyhunter, Bloodrayne (The same director from House Of The Dead and Alone In  The Dark) So, as you can see, the market is getting flooded, so it was real nice to see such a good video game movie such as this.The Rock and Karl Urban lead a group of bad-ass marines in a search and rescue/destroy mission on Mars. Problem is, there is no one to rescue, they have either been killed or mutated into a zombie/monster. Seems the research/archeologists found a 24th chromosone that can either make you super-human, or, well, you know by now I'm sure. But it effects each individual differently,  if you have evil tendencies you will turn, if you are generally good, then no change.The weaponry is so awesome, the guns these marines use are loud and quick, and pack a hell of a punch. Then there is the 'BFG' that The Rock gets to play with later on in the film, I'll give you 1 guess what it stands for...(Bio-Force Gun? nah.......) I'm guessing the monsters were CG, but I'll tell you what, it is some really good CG, They are all really scary looking and mean and nasty. Also the make-up on all the zombies and the blood and gore are all incredible looking, they really did there research into making the monsters/zombies look like something right out of the game. There is a scene toward the end where they switch to a 1st person shooter mode and it is so friggin' cool!! All you see is the end of the gun blowing anything and everything away, looking so much like the game but only better.Now I know acting and plot are important to any movie, and I would usually agree with you, no movie should get 4 stars if the acting sucks and you can't get into the plot. The acting doesn't suck, it's just that it's, well, not there. It's just your usual assortment of testerone-filled men yelling and cursing, you have seen it a hundred times before. This is The Rock's worst performance yet, but he has such a strong presence, and as my wife would say, when your that smokin' hot, who the hell cares?I did like Karl Urban, he of Lord Of The Rings fame, he plays Reaper, at first a total a-hole, but then mellows and kicks alot of butt toward the end. The other marines are all forgettable as are all the doctors and scientists, but it was sure fun watching then all die, some much worst then others.My wife usually does not like these mindless, pointless movies, but she said she had alot of fun (I'm sure The Rock had a little to do with that) and would recommend this to the ladies at work, so I think most women will enjoy it as much as the men. Be warned, it is extremely graphic and violent, just like the game was. There is also alot of language and some generally creepy, suspensefull scenes, I'd say late teens should be fine.

I never got to see this movie in the theater and recently got a chance to see the uncut edition. Honestly my very first impression of the movie was ""this is cool"". Honestly if this movie would have been called ""UAC Marines"", ""Viral Apocalypse"" or something else random, this movie would have done A LOT better. It was actually really good for a sci-fi movie. Much in the vein of Resident Evil meets Mission to Mars. The thing that really made this movie not a movie about DOOM however was the lack of cohesive elements to the game story. In the game it's all about hell and demons and weird psycho doctors wanting to be more psycho. The movie focuses on an ancient race designing a machine called the ARC; this machine makes direct transport to mars possible. There seems to be a problem on mars and the UAC Marines are sent in to investigate. The next about an hour and forty five minutes is all about trying to figure out what happened and destroy the threat if any. It's your very standard sci-fi story but it achieves what it's meant to do. Entertain you for a moment.The movies main downfall is it is only LOOSELY based around the game that everyone wanted to see on film. However to appease the fan boys (girls?) out there DOOM does have a very unique experience visually in the form of a (about 5-10 minute) segment where the camera is completely shot in first person perspective.

Doom was basically no exception with the critics but hardcore fans of all the Doom video games will be very pleased with it. I myself am a huge fan of the old Doom games, and enjoyed Doom 3 pretty well also, even though it got a little mundane about half way through. The movie is based more so on it than the older game, everything is here, the infected scientist's, infected soldiers, and humans in general. The few creatures you actually ,see basically look just like they do in the game, only one thing is missing, the fire ball throwing gimps, which i was a bit dissapointed to not see. The special effects on this are superb, some of the best i've seen in a long time, a lot of it you can't even tell the difference between actual charactars and CGI. For example, towards the end when it switches over to first person you realllly feel like you should be controlling John as he searches for his sister, sadly its a movie. If a game ever comes out with graphics that look like this sequence in the movie, all FPS fans will cream themselves with excitement, i for one would. Also the floor creature that crawls on all fours(or does he in the movie) looks as real as anything i've ever seen in a horror picture. A few things lacking were the floating fireheads, the upside down spiderheads, and the giant supercreature that basically is indestructable in Doom 3. I can't and won't complain though, this is by far one of the best video game adaptations i've seen on the big screen. All the weapons are authentic, the atmosphere, room's, labs, even bathrooms are very much a carbon copy of the game itself. Even though the story is just like the game,(thin), and the acting is well not the greatest but not the worst this is a good (very violent) horror, action, sci-fi movie without the satanic aspects that follow the game. I think had someone like James Cameron had done the film critics probably would have eaten it up, unfortunately we live in a world where the young aspiring directors don't get the respect they deserve, oh well maybe Doom 2 will be next on the list and they'll realize its always been about a VIDEO GAME and always will be!!",4,"If you like the game, you'll like the movie",1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,2285,"['Usually', 'movies', 'based', 'games', 'such', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'pretty', 'much', 'bomb', 'box', 'office', 'fans', 'general', 'Doom', 'was', 'basically', 'exception', 'critics', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Doom', 'video', 'games', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'pleased', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'old', 'Doom', 'games', 'enjoyed', 'Doom', '3', 'pretty', 'well', 'also', 'even', 'got', 'little', 'mundane', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'based', 'more', 'so', 'older', 'game', 'everything', 'here', 'infected', 'scientist', 'infected', 'soldiers', 'humans', 'general', 'few', 'creatures', 'actually', 'see', 'basically', 'look', 'just', 'do', 'game', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'fire', 'ball', 'throwing', 'gimps', 'i', 'was', 'bit', 'dissapointed', 'not', 'see', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'superb', 'best', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'lot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'difference', 'actual', 'charactars', 'CGI', 'example', 'end', 'when', 'first', 'person', 'realllly', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'controlling', 'John', 'sister', 'sadly', 'movie', 'game', 'ever', 'out', 'graphics', 'look', 'sequence', 'movie', 'FPS', 'fans', 'will', 'cream', 'excitement', 'i', 'one', 'would', 'Also', 'floor', 'creature', 'fours', 'movie', 'as', 'real', 'anything', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'horror', 'picture', 'few', 'things', 'lacking', 'were', 'floating', 'fireheads', 'upside', 'down', 'spiderheads', 'giant', 'supercreature', 'basically', 'indestructable', 'Doom', '3', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'though', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'weapons', 'are', 'authentic', 'atmosphere', 'room', 'labs', 'even', 'bathrooms', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'carbon', 'copy', 'game', 'Even', 'story', 'just', 'game', 'thin', 'acting', 'well', 'not', 'greatest', 'not', 'worst', 'good', 'very', 'violent', 'horror', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'satanic', 'aspects', 'follow', 'game', 'think', 'had', 'someone', 'James', 'Cameron', 'had', 'done', 'film', 'critics', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'eaten', 'up', 'unfortunately', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'young', 'aspiring', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'respect', 'deserve', 'oh', 'well', 'maybe', 'Doom', '2', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'list', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'always', 'been', 'VIDEO', 'GAME', 'always', 'will', 'be']",N/A
959171,A2HIYWRDD2QBUI,B000CNER1S,Jim M. Hastings-trew,"[45, 45]","A lot of people like to criticize the DOOM movie as being a ""bad"" movie - a classic example of what goes wrong when you try to transport a thread-bare video game plot to the big screen. I'm here to disagree.It's pretty easy to make the case that DOOM the movie is a terrible translation of DOOM the video game. The core of the ""plot"" from the game is entirely changed. In the game, irresponsible experiments with matter teleportation in a base on Mars opens a rift between our world, and Hell itself. Hell comes spilling through into our reality, and it's up to the player as a lone gun-wielding protagonist to mow his way through thousands of zombie humans and hell-spawned demons till he defeats the very forces of Hell. Nothing of that made it into the movie. The similarities are: It takes place on Mars, and there are guns. There is even a teleporter in the plot but it's simply there as a device to keep the action going quickly between the Mars installation and the final showdown in the bowels of the UAC facility on Earth. No Hell, no demons. This is all replaced by genetic experimentation aimed at creating a ""super human"" - something the ancient Martians failed at, with similar results.This fundamental change to the plot of the story was a disappointment, but you know what? Everything else works. The sets look similar to the ""feel"" of the locations in Doom 3, the genetically altered humans look like a few of the monsters from Doom 3, and there is a hilariously great ""first person shooter"" sequence that had me smiling like a silly kid. Yeah, there's some woeful dialog, yeah, there are some lapses in logic (why would a science installation on Mars have a catacombs-style sewer system with the air-space venting directly into the facility itself - that would be one stinky, humid research lab) but overall, the movie is fun, it's competently made, there are some fun characters, there are some terrific set pieces, and in the end, it's entertaining.The blu-ray release is a bit late to the party - the was one of the first HD-DVD titles released and it's taken a while to come out on the ""other"" HD format. The picture is stunning - dead perfect black levels, zero noise, crisp detail, no artifacting at all. The audio is great - only rarely do the action scenes break down into ""noisy chaos"" - overall it's highly detailed and nuanced.Fans of the game are treated to some ""in-jokes"": The names of most of the scientists in the UAC lab are based on the names of the primary developers of the video game - John Carmack, Tim Willits, etc. While most of the weaponry in the movie is standard military type gear, the BFG 9000 from the game makes an appearance in the movie (looking sort of like a V-8 engine with a trigger). The teams names (Sarge, Reaper, etc.) come from another ID game - Quake 3. The ""first person shooter"" sequence in particular is a shout-out to fans of the genre, and is very well done.Love it, hate it - it's a very well produced HD version of the movie, and despite it's flaws, it's a very entertaining action movie.",4,DOOM is great on Blu-Ray,1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,3056,"['lot', 'people', 'criticize', 'DOOM', 'movie', 'being', 'bad', 'movie', 'classic', 'example', 'what', 'wrong', 'when', 'try', 'transport', 'thread-bare', 'video', 'game', 'plot', 'big', 'screen', ""'m"", 'here', 'disagree.It', 'pretty', 'easy', 'make', 'case', 'movie', 'terrible', 'translation', 'DOOM', 'video', 'game', 'core', 'plot', 'game', 'entirely', 'changed', 'game', 'irresponsible', 'experiments', 'matter', 'teleportation', 'base', 'Mars', 'rift', 'world', 'Hell', 'Hell', 'spilling', 'reality', 'up', 'player', 'lone', 'gun-wielding', 'protagonist', 'mow', 'way', 'thousands', 'zombie', 'humans', 'hell-spawned', 'demons', 'very', 'forces', 'Hell', 'Nothing', 'made', 'movie', 'similarities', 'are', 'place', 'Mars', 'are', 'guns', 'even', 'teleporter', 'plot', 'simply', 'there', 'device', 'keep', 'action', 'going', 'quickly', 'Mars', 'installation', 'final', 'showdown', 'bowels', 'UAC', 'facility', 'Earth', 'No', 'Hell', 'demons', 'replaced', 'genetic', 'experimentation', 'aimed', 'creating', 'super', 'human', 'something', 'ancient', 'Martians', 'failed', 'similar', 'results.This', 'fundamental', 'change', 'plot', 'story', 'was', 'disappointment', 'know', 'what', 'Everything', 'else', 'sets', 'look', 'similar', 'feel', 'locations', 'Doom', '3', 'genetically', 'altered', 'humans', 'look', 'few', 'monsters', 'Doom', '3', 'hilariously', 'great', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'sequence', 'had', 'smiling', 'silly', 'kid', 'Yeah', 'woeful', 'dialog', 'yeah', 'are', 'lapses', 'logic', 'why', 'would', 'science', 'installation', 'Mars', 'have', 'catacombs-style', 'sewer', 'system', 'air-space', 'venting', 'directly', 'facility', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'stinky', 'humid', 'research', 'lab', 'overall', 'movie', 'fun', 'competently', 'made', 'are', 'fun', 'characters', 'are', 'terrific', 'set', 'pieces', 'end', 'entertaining.The', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'bit', 'late', 'party', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'HD-DVD', 'titles', 'released', 'taken', 'while', 'come', 'out', 'other', 'HD', 'format', 'picture', 'stunning', 'dead', 'perfect', 'black', 'levels', 'zero', 'noise', 'crisp', 'detail', 'artifacting', 'audio', 'great', 'only', 'rarely', 'do', 'action', 'break', 'down', 'noisy', 'chaos', 'highly', 'detailed', 'nuanced.Fans', 'game', 'are', 'treated', 'in-jokes', 'names', 'most', 'scientists', 'UAC', 'lab', 'are', 'based', 'names', 'primary', 'developers', 'video', 'game', 'John', 'Carmack', 'Tim', 'Willits', 'etc', 'most', 'weaponry', 'movie', 'standard', 'military', 'type', 'gear', 'BFG', '9000', 'game', 'appearance', 'movie', 'looking', 'sort', 'V-8', 'engine', 'trigger', 'teams', 'names', 'Sarge', 'Reaper', 'etc', 'come', 'ID', 'game', 'Quake', '3', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'sequence', 'particular', 'shout-out', 'fans', 'genre', 'very', 'well', 'done.Love', 'hate', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'HD', 'version', 'movie', 'flaws', 'very', 'entertaining', 'action', 'movie']",N/A

I can't really defend this one though. It stars the Rock who leads a team of soldiers to a lab that I guess is supposed to be on Mars. There's creatures around who start killing the team and it takes the main scientist in the film half the movie to realize that the creatures  used to be human.The direction is shaky and the script and dialogue are just as bad. I don't even know what made the Rock do this movie. It makes Walking Tall look like a good career move. He just barks orders through the whole movie as the camera zooms in and out at him making angry faces. After showing  he can hang with people like John Travolta and Christopher Walken in Be Cool and The Rundown, it baffles me that he'd do this. Hopefully he chose to do Johny Bravo because it has a good script and director. Choosing to do a film based on a cartoon series is about as much of a bad career move as it is to do a film based on a video game though.The acting isn't that good but I think Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings, The Chronichles of Riddick) is decent. He's certainly better here than the Rock. The Rock just isn't likeable here, he chose to do an awful role that's not even fitting for his personality. He's a funny guy and here he's just an angry loud mouth jerk. Who wants to see the Rock in a role like that ? The movie gets even worse when it actually becomes exactly like the video game as all we see is Urban's gun as he fires at monsters that jump at him from all different directions.

But like the books, the movie has to add a lot to the story to make it work.  A simple shooter is not a story.  This movie takes a different direction than the novels.  Most of the action takes place on Mars which can be reached through an ancient gate.  When a science installation comes under attack, a rescue squad is sent.  They don't know what they are going to find but they investigate in a professional manner.Soon they run into some of the horror game players expect.  Strange and powerful creatures no roam the installation.  The team must manage to fight them off while trying to figure out what is going on.  As expected, the body count begins to rise.  As tension escalates it is realized that the horror must not be allowed to get back through the gate to Earth.  Eventually the exact nature of the menace is played big time and we have the final showdown.Considering this is based on a game with almost no story it turned out pretty well.  The team would have been more believable if that had some sort of head protection but the makes wanted the actors faces unobscured.  I was also surprised at changing rates of spread.  For much of the movie it is a slow process but when a scene calls for it, it is almost explosive.  The Jekyll and Hyde nature was quite interesting but I felt the movie ended almost too easily.  There was no mopping up or even checking to see if mopping up would be necessary.

If you go in expecting ""Schindler's List"" - yeah, you are going to be disappointed. For the rest of us, Doom is a fun action flick. I was really tapping my foot and looking at my watch during the first half, but the second half really redeemed the movie for me. There is a great plot twist that makes the whole movie worth while. And, without giving away anything major, there is a GREAT hand-to-hand fight scene near the end that is one of the best ever. The Rock does a pretty good job as Sarge, the lead Marine, but he is way out of his league everytime he is in a scene with Karl Urban. Karl Urban is such a great actor and he really raised Doom up a level (no pun intended!) just by being in it. If Doom does nothing else, I hope that it gives Mr. Urban a chance to get the credit he deserves. All in all, Doom is a fun hour-and-a-half movie.

959196,AG5K5RASCP4PT,B000CNER1S,"L. sherman ""dragonfrost0131""","[4, 8]","Based upon the popular computer game franchise from id Software, the UAC Corporation has opened a gateway to Hell, unleashing demons on the Earth.  The Rock leads a squad of anxious Marines, more like space cowboys, to detain the threat.  Along the way, the identities of the demons are revealed, as the survivors struggle to make their way to the surface of Hell.Sounds like it would make a pretty good concept for a Hollywood movie...too bad no one knew what they were doing when they wrote and produced it.  Whoever developed this piece of garbage probably didn't have a clue as to how to make a movie, and got their limited insight from secondhand sources, people who don't play computer games, but saw a demo somewhere and said, ""Okay, this is how it's done.""  Wrong.I've been a long-time Doom fan, and I even read the exceptional novels by authors Dafydd ab Hugh and Brad Linaweaver.  Although I wasn't big on Doom 3, I accepted that the film would no doubt be based on the best-looking game, and went in with no expectations whatsoever.  I figured there was no way it could be as bad as Resident Evil: Apocalypse, or Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.  Doom taught me an invaluable lesson: don't secondguess the Hollywood studios, because apparently they can always sink further down the turd pipe.To say the movie was a disappointment is an understatement.  Disappointing is what many people said about the Star Wars prequels.  Disappointing, but in the long run, still having their merits as decent films.  Doom is a flat-out bad movie that should have been released straight-to-video, along with another Oscar Award winner, Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation.  For fans of the computer games who are asking what could have been so bad about the movie, why don't you give me a checklist of things you expect to see, and I'll tell you what it didn't have.First, the movie is dark.  It works in a game in which horror and surprise are key elements to gameplay.  In a movie, an audience wants to see what's on screen.  Every time a demon makes an appearance, it either runs away, or moves so fast that the audience can't grasp what's going on.  And also, for those who are familiar with the games, they provide legions of demons, all of which bare nightmarish features.  In the film, you see four, and one of those are the zombies that for some reason look pretty lame.  The only way to tell the Imps apart are their several beady eyes, and no, they don't throw fireballs...they just leap at the Marines and lick their faces.A good portion of the games take place on Mars.  In the movie, the Marines do go to another planet, and can transport back and forth to Earth via a gateway, but you won't see any extra-terrestrial terrain...all the action takes place in sewers and tunnels.Weaponry...a chaingun, a pistol, and the BFG...no plasma rifle.  You might think the BFG would be pretty cool, and it looks that way, but The Rock never actually fires it at a demon...he just tests it out a couple of times, and the blast basically disintegrates things.The twist of the story is very disheartening and uninspired.  Think Resident Evil, the way the Umbrella Corporation injected its workers with the T-Virus...yeah, the ""twist"" as to what the demons really are, is pretty close to the exact same thing.The Rock's character is pretty lame, as the film ends between the last two Marines fighting each other.  There is a five-minute sequences at the end of the film, leading up to this fatal climax, in which the audience gets a representation of the game...the ""good"" Marine fights off some demons as we view it in first-person mode via the video games.  Just what I wanted, to sit and watch someone play a video game.I'm very fair when it comes to watching movies, and not very biased.  Hell, I even liked Super Mario Bros., not because I thought it was a good adaptation of the game (which it wasn't), but because I got a few laughs from it.

959200,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000CNER1S,Mark Turner,"[1, 4]","Over the past 10-20 years Hollywood has seen fit to look towards other areas of entertainment to find new and exciting properties to turn into movies. The two most used have been comics and video games. Both have yielded a number of films from the studios and some have been successful while others faded fast.The problem? For the most part, Hollywood seems to think it can take one of these stories and change it, making it better in their eyes. But the sad thing is that in doing so, they more often than not take out everything that made the original good, entertaining and interesting and replaced it with the same old drek that these producers have churned out over the years. (A prime example is the first HOUSE OF THE DEAD).The game DOOM took the country by storm, following Wolfenstein as the hottest first person shooter to capture game players' minds and money across the country. For those who don't know, a first person shooter is a game where you are the main character, your hand is in front of you center screen holding various weapons as you make your way through an imaginary world.  DOOM featured monsters, music and mayhem and was a great game. I continue to play it myself to this very day. But somewhere from the small PC screen to the theatre screen, something was lost.The film tells the story of a group of Space Marines who are transported to the Mars base when problems arise. It seems that a research project there has gone awry and now the whole base has been quarantined. The Marines are sent in to find out what the problem is, come up with a solution and return things to normal.When they arrive, things are much worse than anticipated. Not only have things gone bad, those in charge of the research have changed and become the next step in some mixed up evolutionary pattern that even they weren't aware of. Reasons are given, explanations of how it all began are eventually forced from those left in charge and the Marines get to do what they do best (and what DOOM players want to see) which is to blow things up real good.Sound like a solid action flick? Well it could be except for several items. First off is the fact that most of the film is shot in the dark, making it mysterious I guess for those who are afraid of only the dark. The thing is the original game takes place in near daylight most of the time. The second is that it takes most of the films 100 minutes to eventually see these creatures enough to recognize them. Once more, while the game shows creatures non stop throughout, here we wait and wait and wait. Lastly, we wait for what we want to see, which is good but not used nearly enough and done in a haphazard way as to make us feel it was tossed in for effect.What's this? It's the whole first person sequence. As seen through the eyes of the films hero, we walked through dark corridors and begin to blow apart numerous creatures and zombies in blood spattering semi-gore. But it's rushed, doesn't fit well into the rest of the film/story and just doesn't provide game players with the same experience that the game does. In essence, it caps off an already disappointing film.While this movie is not the worst of the games to movies genre (see HOUSE OF THE DEAD for the ultimate worst), it still offers nothing new, nothing exciting and nothing of interest to DOOM players. Perhaps these characters, situations and monsters are more familiar to DOOM 3 players, as I've only played the first 2. Any way you look at it, an action film where action consists of just flames shooting out of the ends of various weapons is like no action at all. And the weak story while giving us some motivation as to what's going on, it still seems like the same old thing you've seen since ALIEN first screamed where no one could hear you scream.Perhaps the sorest loser in this movie is The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, whose change in career from superstar wrestler to movie star has been moving along nicely up to this point. Showing he can handle action in films like THE SCORPION KING and WALKING TALL and  comedy in films like BE COOL and THE RUNDOWN, he has turned out to be a fairly good actor. But this movie offers him nothing except to bark orders and shoot off big guns.For DOOM the game fans you will be disappointed. For DOOM the movie fans (who've never played the game) you may find it mildly entertaining. But for me? This DOOM was just DUMB.",2,HOLLYWOOD...GIVE ME BACK MY GAMES!,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,4392,"['past', '10-20', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'seen', 'fit', 'look', 'other', 'areas', 'entertainment', 'find', 'new', 'exciting', 'properties', 'turn', 'movies', 'two', 'most', 'used', 'have', 'been', 'comics', 'video', 'games', 'have', 'yielded', 'number', 'films', 'studios', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'others', 'faded', 'fast.The', 'problem', 'most', 'part', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'can', 'take', 'one', 'stories', 'change', 'making', 'better', 'eyes', 'sad', 'thing', 'doing', 'so', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'take', 'out', 'everything', 'made', 'original', 'good', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'replaced', 'same', 'old', 'drek', 'producers', 'have', 'churned', 'out', 'years', 'prime', 'example', 'first', 'HOUSE', 'THE', 'DEAD', '.The', 'game', 'DOOM', 'took', 'country', 'storm', 'following', 'Wolfenstein', 'hottest', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'capture', 'game', 'players', 'minds', 'money', 'country', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'game', 'where', 'are', 'main', 'character', 'hand', 'front', 'center', 'screen', 'holding', 'various', 'weapons', 'make', 'way', 'imaginary', 'world', 'DOOM', 'featured', 'monsters', 'music', 'mayhem', 'was', 'great', 'game', 'continue', 'play', 'very', 'day', 'somewhere', 'small', 'PC', 'screen', 'theatre', 'screen', 'something', 'was', 'lost.The', 'film', 'story', 'group', 'Space', 'Marines', 'who', 'are', 'transported', 'Mars', 'base', 'when', 'problems', 'arise', 'research', 'project', 'there', 'gone', 'awry', 'now', 'whole', 'base', 'been', 'quarantined', 'Marines', 'are', 'sent', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'problem', 'come', 'up', 'solution', 'return', 'things', 'normal.When', 'arrive', 'things', 'are', 'much', 'worse', 'anticipated', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'things', 'gone', 'bad', 'charge', 'research', 'have', 'changed', 'become', 'next', 'step', 'mixed', 'up', 'evolutionary', 'pattern', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'aware', 'Reasons', 'are', 'given', 'explanations', 'how', 'began', 'are', 'eventually', 'forced', 'left', 'charge', 'Marines', 'get', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'what', 'DOOM', 'players', 'want', 'see', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'real', 'good.Sound', 'solid', 'action', 'flick', 'Well', 'could', 'be', 'several', 'items', 'First', 'off', 'fact', 'most', 'film', 'shot', 'dark', 'making', 'mysterious', 'guess', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'only', 'dark', 'thing', 'original', 'game', 'place', 'near', 'daylight', 'most', 'time', 'second', 'most', 'films', '100', 'minutes', 'eventually', 'see', 'creatures', 'enough', 'recognize', 'Once', 'more', 'game', 'creatures', 'non', 'stop', 'here', 'wait', 'wait', 'wait', 'Lastly', 'wait', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'not', 'used', 'nearly', 'enough', 'done', 'haphazard', 'way', 'make', 'feel', 'was', 'tossed', 'whole', 'first', 'person', 'sequence', 'seen', 'eyes', 'films', 'hero', 'walked', 'dark', 'corridors', 'begin', 'blow', 'apart', 'numerous', 'creatures', 'zombies', 'blood', 'spattering', 'semi-gore', 'rushed', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'rest', 'film/story', 'just', ""n't"", 'provide', 'game', 'players', 'same', 'experience', 'game', 'essence', 'caps', 'off', 'already', 'disappointing', 'film.While', 'movie', 'not', 'worst', 'games', 'movies', 'genre', 'see', 'HOUSE', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'ultimate', 'worst', 'still', 'nothing', 'new', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'nothing', 'interest', 'DOOM', 'players', 'Perhaps', 'characters', 'situations', 'monsters', 'are', 'more', 'familiar', 'DOOM', '3', 'players', ""'ve"", 'only', 'played', 'first', '2', 'way', 'look', 'action', 'film', 'where', 'action', 'just', 'flames', 'shooting', 'ends', 'various', 'weapons', 'action', 'weak', 'story', 'giving', 'motivation', 'what', 'going', 'still', 'same', 'old', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ALIEN', 'first', 'screamed', 'where', 'one', 'could', 'hear', 'scream.Perhaps', 'sorest', 'loser', 'movie', 'Rock', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'change', 'career', 'superstar', 'wrestler', 'movie', 'star', 'been', 'moving', 'along', 'nicely', 'point', 'Showing', 'can', 'handle', 'action', 'films', 'SCORPION', 'KING', 'WALKING', 'TALL', 'comedy', 'films', 'BE', 'COOL', 'THE', 'RUNDOWN', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fairly', 'good', 'actor', 'movie', 'nothing', 'bark', 'orders', 'shoot', 'off', 'big', 'guns.For', 'DOOM', 'game', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'DOOM', 'movie', 'fans', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'game', 'may', 'find', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'DOOM', 'was', 'just', 'DUMB']",N/A

The extended addition has a good number of additional scenes edited out for TV, although a warning is that the box says it is 1 hr 53 min, but it is more like 1 hr 43 min, with almost 10 minutes of end credits.  The action is still good, even more so with the extra scenes that explain more of the action and the raunchiness of the film.  It is entertaining and suspenseful, but this is also pretty brutal sci-fi/monster stuff.  The male lead, Urban, has played the tough warrior in several films of this genre and does a really good job here.  The Rock's character changes towards the end, doing a moral flip-flop that seems to be motivated by fear.  The female lead is a puny, skinny thing with a wierd facial expression, always seeming to be surprised or shocked -- she's frail and vulnerable, classic wimpy female stuff, often screaming, and not the tough chick that has been showing up in a good many films in the last decade.  A Xena type would have been a lot more interesting and fun than this wimpy one, who needs men to protect her.  There are other drawbacks to the film too.  I didn't appreciate the traditional female exploitation by having to have a fully naked woman so the slimy members of the team could make a move to rape her.  That wasn't just demeaning to women but also disgusting and inappropriate, gratuitous rather than meaningful to the film itself.  Also, the bigger problem is that most of the film is just way too dark.  It's very hard to see what's going on.  I kept turning my brightness up on my TV, but of course that doesn't help when the dark portions of the film are also flat.  It just gives you a kind of fog.  Of course, in the end the storyline is rather old, being more or less vampirish, so the film could have been done along more innovative or intellectual lines except that it is just an action thriller and so indicative of the weaknesses in the genre as well as the strengths.  Overall, it was still entertaining, but if there is a Doom 2, it'd be nice to have the writers and producers come into the 21st century where women are concerned, having bold strong women rather than weaklings and victims.",4,"Intense science fiction/horror, entertaining",1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2216,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'TV', 'finally', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'extended', 'addition', 'good', 'number', 'additional', 'scenes', 'edited', 'out', 'TV', 'warning', 'box', '1', 'hr', '53', 'min', 'more', '1', 'hr', '43', 'min', 'almost', '10', 'minutes', 'end', 'credits', 'action', 'still', 'good', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'extra', 'scenes', 'explain', 'more', 'action', 'raunchiness', 'film', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'also', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'sci-fi/monster', 'stuff', 'male', 'lead', 'Urban', 'played', 'tough', 'warrior', 'several', 'films', 'genre', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'Rock', 'character', 'changes', 'towards', 'end', 'doing', 'moral', 'flip-flop', 'be', 'motivated', 'fear', 'female', 'lead', 'puny', 'skinny', 'thing', 'wierd', 'facial', 'expression', 'always', 'seeming', 'be', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'frail', 'vulnerable', 'classic', 'wimpy', 'female', 'stuff', 'often', 'screaming', 'not', 'tough', 'chick', 'been', 'showing', 'up', 'good', 'many', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'Xena', 'type', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'fun', 'wimpy', 'one', 'who', 'men', 'protect', 'are', 'other', 'drawbacks', 'film', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'traditional', 'female', 'exploitation', 'having', 'have', 'fully', 'naked', 'woman', 'slimy', 'members', 'team', 'could', 'make', 'move', 'rape', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'demeaning', 'women', 'also', 'disgusting', 'inappropriate', 'gratuitous', 'rather', 'meaningful', 'film', 'Also', 'bigger', 'problem', 'most', 'film', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'dark', 'very', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'kept', 'turning', 'brightness', 'up', 'TV', 'course', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'dark', 'portions', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'flat', 'just', 'kind', 'fog', 'course', 'end', 'storyline', 'rather', 'old', 'being', 'more', 'less', 'vampirish', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'innovative', 'intellectual', 'lines', 'just', 'action', 'thriller', 'so', 'indicative', 'weaknesses', 'genre', 'as', 'well', 'strengths', 'Overall', 'was', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Doom', '2', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'writers', 'producers', 'come', '21st', 'century', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'concerned', 'having', 'bold', 'strong', 'women', 'rather', 'weaklings', 'victims']",N/A

As to the film's plot, it can be summarized in a single sentence:  a group of &uuml;ber-soldiers lead by their ""Sarge"" (played by The Rock) travel to Mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with DNA recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a Martian archaeological dig.  So, there's tons of shooting, a lot of screams, gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about, a Martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of ""The Sphere"".  Others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include Karl Urban (&uuml;ber-soldier John Grimm) and Rosamund Pike (as John Grimm's sister named Sam).  Why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in ""Doom"" defies logic.To anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1-star film in a theater, you have my deepest sympathy.  To anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of ""Doom"" on DVD, please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price.

But The Rock IS a commanding physical presence and at least he doesn't have an Austrian accent.  And DOOM is one of the best movies made from a video game.  While certainly not the classic that ALIENS is, the movie borrows a lot of that movie's dark atmosphere and it has a great sequence in which you become the shooter; it's just like a video game.DOOM's standard plot focuses on the planet Mars, where a genetic experiment gone wrong (do they ever go right?) unleashes some frightening monsters.  The action is fast and furious; the special effects are great; and there's lots of gore and violence as one would expect from this kind of film.  Karl Urban (LORD OF THE RINGS) gets to be the hero in this one and he's sufficiently macho and controlled; Rosamund Pike is effective as his sister; and Richard Brake is a nasty sex-craved soldier.

It has happened with Super Mario Brothers, Mortal Kombat and the Street Fighter franchises to boot. Yet, while that has happened, the films based on those games didn't fair at all very well. That has happened again with another video game, Doom. This film starring former wrestler now action star The Rock, feels more more like in need of new management. It really seemed more out of the ordinary into obscurity, and the lack of the feeling the popular video game had years ago. I wasn't impressed. I liked the video game a whole lot better.

959207,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000CNER1S,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","When it comes to game-to-film adaptations, we all know not to expect much: casual viewers are left confused as to what in the world is going on, critics are left to assume that the game is just as bad as the movie, and gamers have the pleasure of watching a favored franchise being systematically picked apart by writers who feel their story is more compelling than the source material and directors who have never even laid hands on a control pad. Short of Uwe Boll films and the earliest of live-action attempts (Super Mario Bros., ""Street Fighter: The Movie""), no adaptation does a better job of showing just how incredibly unrelated a movie can be from the game it's based on, in the worst possible way.In ""Doom"", a unit of marines (led by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson,Walking Tall) is sent to a research facility on Mars in response to a distress call in the year 2046. What they find is a base devastated by a monstrous force spawned from genetic experiments trying to replicate magnificent finds of the on-planet archaeological site...You'll notice that I didn't mention hell at all in my summary. That's because in the movie, it has no place or relevance - thus, we have the biggest mistake the film could make. ""Doom"" without hell is like the Arthurian legend without the sword in the stone: it effectively neuters the story of its driving force. Indeed, the actors seem to drift rather aimlessly throughout what begins to feel increasingly like anAliensrip-off...without the cool monsters, of course. Only a handful of Doom creatures are represented (the imp, the hellknight, and the pinky demon), and even they lack the abilities that made the game such a big hit - they just look like guys in rubber suits, without the terrifying speed or strength of their CGI counterparts.With faithfulness to the game not a priority, you'd think that director Andrzej Bartkowiak (Romeo Must Die) could at least give the film a healthy dose of action to keep it alive, but this is not the case: with the minor exception of the Rock/Karl Urban (Out of the Blue) showdown at the end of the film, it's all poorly-lit gunfighting where the marines hit nothing. The acting is also a complete shot in the bucket: though Johnson earned himself a Razzie nomination for the film, it's Urban, Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day), Richard Brake (Hannibal Rising), Razaaq Adoti (Resident Evil - Apocalypse), and the rest of the cast that do the worst jobs with their roles - then again, you can't really blame them, seeing as they're little more than kill-by-numbers characters.Chronologically sandwiched between theAlone in the DarkandBloodRayne, it's easy to see why the movie has already been put out of the minds of most people who've seen it. With the only memorable scene in the film being the lengthy first-person killing spree near the end of the film, there's really nothing to keep viewers attached to the film, unless they're die-hard fans of The Rock. While it's not quite as bad as Boll productions, it's nonetheless not worth the DVD that holds it, and doesn't deserve the respect of gamers.The 20-minute special feature report on the actual game series is cool, though...",2,"""Like the kid said, 'Go to Hell'!""",1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,3164,"['When', 'game-to-film', 'adaptations', 'know', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'casual', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'confused', 'what', 'world', 'going', 'critics', 'are', 'left', 'assume', 'game', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'movie', 'gamers', 'have', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'favored', 'franchise', 'being', 'systematically', 'picked', 'apart', 'writers', 'who', 'feel', 'story', 'more', 'compelling', 'source', 'material', 'directors', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'laid', 'hands', 'control', 'pad', 'Short', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'films', 'earliest', 'live-action', 'attempts', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'Movie', 'adaptation', 'better', 'job', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'incredibly', 'unrelated', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'game', 'based', 'worst', 'possible', 'way.In', 'Doom', 'unit', 'marines', 'led', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'sent', 'research', 'facility', 'Mars', 'response', 'distress', 'call', 'year', '2046', 'What', 'find', 'base', 'devastated', 'monstrous', 'force', 'spawned', 'genetic', 'experiments', 'trying', 'replicate', 'magnificent', 'finds', 'on-planet', 'archaeological', 'site', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'hell', 'summary', 'because', 'movie', 'place', 'relevance', 'thus', 'have', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'film', 'could', 'make', 'Doom', 'hell', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'sword', 'stone', 'effectively', 'story', 'driving', 'force', 'Indeed', 'actors', 'seem', 'drift', 'rather', 'aimlessly', 'what', 'feel', 'increasingly', 'anAliensrip-off', 'cool', 'monsters', 'course', 'Only', 'handful', 'Doom', 'creatures', 'are', 'represented', 'imp', 'hellknight', 'pinky', 'demon', 'even', 'lack', 'abilities', 'made', 'game', 'big', 'hit', 'just', 'look', 'like', 'guys', 'rubber', 'suits', 'terrifying', 'speed', 'strength', 'CGI', 'counterparts.With', 'faithfulness', 'game', 'not', 'priority', ""'d"", 'think', 'director', 'Andrzej', 'Bartkowiak', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'could', 'least', 'give', 'film', 'healthy', 'dose', 'action', 'keep', 'alive', 'not', 'case', 'minor', 'exception', 'Rock/Karl', 'Urban', 'Out', 'Blue', 'showdown', 'end', 'film', 'poorly-lit', 'gunfighting', 'where', 'marines', 'hit', 'nothing', 'acting', 'also', 'complete', 'shot', 'bucket', 'Johnson', 'earned', 'Razzie', 'nomination', 'film', 'Urban', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Die', 'Day', 'Richard', 'Brake', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'Razaaq', 'Adoti', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Apocalypse', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'worst', 'jobs', 'roles', 'then', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'little', 'more', 'kill-by-numbers', 'characters.Chronologically', 'sandwiched', 'theAlone', 'DarkandBloodRayne', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'already', 'been', 'put', 'minds', 'most', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'memorable', 'scene', 'film', 'being', 'lengthy', 'first-person', 'killing', 'spree', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'nothing', 'keep', 'viewers', 'attached', 'film', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Rock', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'Boll', 'productions', 'nonetheless', 'not', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'respect', 'gamers.The', '20-minute', 'special', 'feature', 'report', 'actual', 'game', 'series', 'cool']",N/A
959208,A300FZS4M8ZG7N,B000CNER1S,miktek,"[4, 8]","Clearly with the title DOOM SUCKS one can attain that the film indeed sucked !!! However this would be placing the meaning of the word 'suck' in a very simple concept. Like the film was just bad, like the film just had bad acting and no script, or even that it just was a boring film .Well no, my meaning of DOOM SUCKED goes alot further than any of these.I am a mad, if not even crazy DOOM fan. I have been anticpating this film since last November and have followed most threads and rumours as really any crazed fan would do :/ For me and many others DOOM is all about hell and demons. You are submerged into a mythos which see's the experimentation of portal technology open a pathway from the station directly to hell itself. Here the inhabinents decide to vaction on the mars sub station. Instead of sunshine and surf , on this vaction things get dam rite demonic and bloody.  The whole point of DOOM is too give the gamer a visual, hellish experience that is both fun and addictive.........This conversion to the big screen was itching for the same visual experience wrapped in the very cool notion of hell, expermentation gone wrong, nightmarish creatures and  awesome gun battles with these creatures.Which brings me to the whole DOOM SUCKED thing !!!!!!The opening sequence was a great beginning and truely had the DOOM game written all over. The transion from the Universal logo was not just a simple "" hey here is mars"". For me, the planet screamed DOOM and if i had seen that footage and not know the film was any way realted to DOOM i would have assumed that they ripped it from DOOM. From here we move into a small sequene where we met the 'meat' or soliders depending on how knowledgeable your are off which characters are just monster fodder in these type of films. Here we met the Rock who - well plays the rock really but without his normal more comedic element ( even in The Scorpion King  he had a sense of humour) In DOOM the Rock is your normal template of an Army Sargent and the most he has to emote is walking around dark sewers or labs barking orders.  But to give the man credit all the characters are secondary to what DOOM is all about and really not one of the actors is really strainin that ole acting muscle. And who cares rite, this is DOOM so bring on hell and all it glorious demons. Bring on the hardcore action and gun battles. TUTTI F##KEN FRUITTI !!!!!!About the 30  minute mark i was starting to wonder if  the demons had skipped the vaction this year. After what seemed forever in some dark sewers and labs where you have to sorta lean rite and squit hard  to even get an outline of the actors, i was truely getting frustrated as to whether this was DOOM or some poorly shot war film.  Then finally  we see someting that resembles the IMP demon in DOOM i must say i gotta a little giddy. But this was soon followed by my blood slowly beginning to seep out of my skin and into my lap !!!!!! SUPER SOLIDERS !!!!!!!WHAT THE F##K !!!!!!It would seem that the makers of this film had watched a little too much Resident Evil and in their owe so glorious wisdom thought - "" hey lets remove hell and demons and make it a sythectic virus that will create super soliders with the wonderful side effect of  physcially changing them into monsters while inducing pure rage into there mind"".UUUUMMMMMMM did someone forget that even the packaging of DOOM the game and all its products, spin offs and so forth HAS A GOD DAM PENTAGRAM !!!!!!! So why get so crazy cause they took all hell reference out you say ????? Maybe im crazed, maybe im just plain psycotic but if they had remade the TITANIC with a plane crashing into a mountin wouldn't you thing What the F##K !!!!! HELL YES !!!!Stripping the movie of all its concepts and storyline connection was just a plain stupid move !!! Those who haven't played the game who see the movie will STILL THINK THE MOVIE SUCKS but they won't really understand why it SUCKS !!! The concept of hell and portal expermintation is way cooler and indepentant than  the  Resident Evil virus clone story and replacing demons with Super Soliders gone mad literally tears the fabric of what is DOOM.If  John Carmark (orginal and still leading designer of DOOM) was truely involed in his property being shat on then the man is truely a brillant designer but easily influenced by Hollywoods need to push any film for the mainstream. However it is still beyond me why they changed the concept of what would have at least made the fans drool like a queen mother (Aliens) and may have been moderately kool to a mainstream audience.As a fan film it is a sheer gut wrenchin experience that rips apart whay too much of the fabric that is DOOM. As a main stream movie fan there aint nuthin your haven't seen here before. Lots of dark corridors, brief jumpy moments of CG and monster body suits being thrown around concluding with a typical action brawl between two infected marines. Even if yah just a monster movie fan , if you but all the elements with the monsters together u would only get about 15 mintures of footage if that.To add insult to injury all shots of the Stan Winston desgin monsters are either to dark or too jumpy to really appericated. The only relation these creatures have to the DOOM series is Pinky and i guess the IMP look liked an imp but its not an IMP, it a mutated man who can't even fire fireballs (IMPS throw fire balls god dam it.....)I MEAN COME ON !!!!Furthermore the BMG gun, a classic weapon in the DOOM series appears and it a DOOM moment that is HOT. BUT hot turns to cold fast as not once, NOT ONCE was the weapon used agaisnt one of the so called super solider freaks ( well there was one fire towards one but still !!!).The only glimer of hope was the 4 minute FPS view where for a brief  almost spiritual moment DOOM washed over the auidence and truely delievered some HOT monster action. However, flip-sideeeeeeeeeeeeee !!!! This may have been because i just sat through 1 hour and 20 minutes of pure crap. Any change in pace was a welcomed one.Furthermore at least 2 minutes of this footage were corridors and brief shots of "" the imp blah ( Super Solider)"". In one segement the so called Imp ran from the action down a corridor which is so not an IMP way. An IMP, if it sees yah, it will tear your freaken head off. Imps don't run away and it was small inconsitencies wrapped with huge concept changes that destroyed this film.However, back to that shining moment. The FPS pespective did provide and looked the DOOM way and the fight with Pinky and chainsaw was visually exhilrating. But i didn't pay 14 bucks to see 2 minutes of excitment with Pinky. I can play the game for that !!!!!!Now to add a further commentary to this whole DOOM saga, i saw the film with another DOOM fan (he is a bigger dork than i am because he actually thinks he is kool) and his teenage brother. Furthermore a family member who  is not obsessed with DOOM saw this film. Now the DOOM fan who saw it with me, well lets just say he is still dealing with the trauma and has actually threaten physical violence on John Carmack and trust me  - this boi fights dirty !!!!!!!His brother liked it but then again he liked the Rock and thought it was just a kool action film (arrr the nievity of youth - i liked Biodome when i was 16 ok enough said) !!!! The family member hated it though i had warned him and maybe have put him off but he stated in a heart beat when i asked him about it "" where were the freakin demons"" and he isn't a DOOM fan.The whole movie DOOM experience is over, they can't remake it and they won't do a sequel to it. So we are forever stuck with this dud.With the words - offical videogame translation of DOOM to cellioud -and it is so not !!!! Its merely a cold canvas of the DOOM universe and blank.It sucks and not just simply, no it sucks in  a way that tipafies the very meaning of IT SUCKED !!!!!So there you go, any chance of the DOOM universe on the big screen destroyed !!!!BURNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN !!!!!!!!!!",1,DOOM Sucks !!!,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,8015,"['Clearly', 'title', 'DOOM', 'SUCKS', 'one', 'can',

In an archaeological research building, scientists have been infected by a unanimous virus being spread around. What are the symptoms? They turn into MONSTERS. Disgusting, ugly, slimy monsters bent on violence. A group of expert marines are sent in to kill all the monsters and save anyone they can.WWF superstar The Rock (The Rundown, Walking Tall) plays Sarge, the aggressive leader of the squad. He plays his typical tough guy, Arnold Schwarzenegger-like role. Pumped up with loads of firepower, he leads the team through dark hallways and bloody labs searching for monsters to kill.For those of you unfamiliar with the origin of Doom, it was known as one of the most popular first-person shooter games of its time. Fans have been playing Doom for years and are jumping to see the concept on a much bigger screen than the computer.Ever wonder what its like to see a video game on a big screen at the theater?

It isn't that entertaining to hold attention for the 113 minutes that could easily have been cut down to 90.The start of the film was quite interesting, and the band of marines led by the Rock into a serious level 5 contamination event at a distant lab was good, and the special effects were acceptable.My disappointment drew from the number of scenes that were too dark for the viewer to distinguish anything. In addition, there were periods of fairly exciting action punctuated by lengthy periods of tedium so we could learn more about the interpersonal issues between individuals. Those plot points were poorly presented, and could have been handled more lucidly and without consumption of such large chunks of time squandered.More to my dismay was the manner in which marines conducted their business. For professional warriors, they lacked discipline and tactical coordination. I can only surmise they studied under the George Armstrong Custer philosophy of war. They split their forces into pairs (making them fairly easy to pick off one by one) seemed to be hampered by equipment malfunctions, and were poorly coordinated in what they knew to be a dangerous environment. These marines were not nearly so believable as the marines seen in Aliens, where they behaved much more realistically than these guys!If they had a military adviser on this film, it would surprise me greatly, because their conduct of a combat operation simply was not believable. They didn't even seem to have any idea of phased retreat!The film is an extension of the popular game DOOM, which inspired the shooting spree at Columbine high school in Colorado, according to testimony on record.Before the film was over, I became bored and started looking around for something else to do with my time.

And any film that includes close-ups of Rosamund Pike (""Pride and Prejudice"" - ""Die Another Day"") more than justifies its existence and the current $.19 price tag for a used DVD.Pike not only looks good, she is an excellent actress and injects some self-parody into the film, you can almost hear her wondering if her salary was worth having to do scenes with the rest of her talent-challenged ensemble.There isn't a lot of originality to be found here. Basically it is a big budget money-losing attempt to clone ""Aliens"" while throwing in a few names and inside jokes from the video game. As in ""Deep Rising"" (another money losing ""Aliens"" clone) a squad of mercenaries/Marines/Marines go to a luxury liner/space colony/research station and find that the passengers/ colonists/scientists have been wiped out by undersea/deep space/genetically-altered creatures. They attempt to destroy the creatures but most are killed.The hero is a maverick outsider played by Treat Williams/Sigourney Weaver/Karl Urban. The main villain is a slimy businessman/corporation representative/kill-crazy NCO; who endangers everyone. Comic relief is provided by wisecracking Kevin O'Connor/Bill Paxton/Richard Blake. The group encounters a female survivor played by Famke Janssen/Carrie Hein/Rosamund Pike.Unfortunately for ""Doom"" and ""Deep Rising"" the producers did not hire the writers from ""Aliens"". This oversight will have you wondering how they could sink this much money and effort into the making this movie, and put so little thought into writing the screenplay. Too bad really-because while unoriginal, the premise does have a lot of potential. There was simply a failure to execute so that after a promising beginning things bog down completely and it just becomes an exercise in excess; with endless boring battles between mercenaries with pop guns and monsters whose properties allow them to do anything.Then again, what do I know?

959223,A3QRUU8SKSH5MP,B000CNER1S,Peter Simone,"[0, 0]","On top of being a stereotypical dumb action movie, Doom has all of the characteristics of a disaster on film.  The first flaw is the terrible acting on the part of The Rock.  Granted he looks badass holding an assault rifle, but when he opens his mouth, the problems start.  He is just not a convincing actor at all.  No one else in the film stands particularly above the mediocre mark either.Another problem we have is with the screenwriting.  They took an already one dimensional actor (The Rock), and had him play the one of the most predictible. one dimensional characters I've ever seen.  His personality can be summed up it three words, KILL KILL KILL.  He just came off as cheesy, to the point where if he started giving demons the Rock Bottom and People's Elbow, I wouldn't have been surprised.  Each character is a stereotype.  During the film, I was making bets on who was going to die first.  Following the action movie cliche, I picked the blackest character in the film.  My girlfriend picked a creepy white guy.  I won.Another crippling point to this film is the lack of action.  They spent way too much time just creeping through dark hallways and to little actually killing things.  Before the First Person Shooter sequence, they only kill about 5 demons, if even that many.  Sure, the first person shooter sequence was cool as hell, but it lasted only about 5 minutes.  I thought from the ads that a huge chunk of the movie was going to be like that.  I wanted more of it throughout the movie.  The action wasn't plentiful enough to keep me entertained.The Final Word - This is one of the dumbest of the dumb action movies that I have ever seen.  It's like XXX: State of the Union dumb.  I laughed through all most of the ""scary"" or ""suspenseful"" parts.  It's pretty terrible in all respects, and even if you're a fan of the game, you'll still leave dissapointed.",2,Yet another dumb action movie.,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,1880,"['top', 'being', 'stereotypical', 'dumb', 'action', 'movie', 'Doom', 'characteristics', 'disaster', 'film', 'first', 'flaw', 'terrible', 'acting', 'part', 'Rock', 'Granted', 'badass', 'holding', 'assault', 'rifle', 'when', 'mouth', 'problems', 'start', 'just', 'not', 'convincing', 'actor', 'one', 'else', 'film', 'particularly', 'mediocre', 'mark', 'either.Another', 'problem', 'have', 'screenwriting', 'took', 'already', 'one', 'dimensional', 'actor', 'Rock', 'had', 'play', 'one', 'most', 'predictible', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'personality', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'three', 'words', 'KILL', 'KILL', 'KILL', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'cheesy', 'point', 'where', 'started', 'giving', 'demons', 'Rock', 'Bottom', 'People', 'Elbow', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'character', 'stereotype', 'film', 'was', 'making', 'bets', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'first', 'Following', 'action', 'movie', 'cliche', 'picked', 'blackest', 'character', 'film', 'girlfriend', 'picked', 'creepy', 'white', 'guy', 'won.Another', 'crippling', 'point', 'film', 'lack', 'action', 'spent', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'just', 'creeping', 'dark', 'hallways', 'little', 'actually', 'killing', 'things', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'sequence', 'only', 'kill', '5', 'demons', 'even', 'many', 'Sure', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'sequence', 'was', 'cool', 'hell', 'lasted', 'only', 'about', '5', 'minutes', 'thought', 'ads', 'huge', 'chunk', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'wanted', 'more', 'movie', 'action', 'was', ""n't"", 'plentiful', 'enough', 'keep', 'entertained.The', 'Final', 'Word', 'one', 'dumbest', 'dumb', 'action', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'XXX', 'State', 'Union', 'dumb', 'laughed', 'most', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'parts', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'respects', 'even', ""'re"", 'fan', 'game', ""'ll"", 'still', 'leave', 'dissapointed']",N/A
959224,AQR22MPF45M3P,B000CNER1S,Rachel Ford,"[0, 0]","When I first saw this movie, I was really curious as to what the director had done with (sorry - I played it and had fun doing so, but it's true!) a game with basically zilch for storyline. I was impressed - it was solid enough, futuristic sci-fi - and I ended up loving this movie.The casting was done well, and the characters were great. The secondary characters - Duke, Portman, Goat, Pinky and all the rest - were somewhere between creepy as heck to hilarious (right where they were intended to be); Samantha and Reaper were great protagonists, and Sarge was a good good guy, and a great bad guy.The action sequences were well done, the dialogue was very good and full of memorable lines, and the character development was superb. Very rarely in a movie of this length do you see such a wide variety of characters with enough screen time such that they don't distract from the story/get boring, but actually end up meaningful and memorable. I would say, with the exception of Mac (in particular) and Destroyer (to a lesser extent), who, unfortunately, didn't get quite enough screen time to be anything more than solid supporting figures, all of the significant secondary characters both furthered the storyline, and made a significant impact on the ""feel"" of the story: the noble-but-religiously-paranoid Goat, the devious-disloyal-and-disgusting Portman, the green-but-good Kid, the cheeky-and-full-of-life Duke, etc. These character types all had the potential to be either great or terrible, with little room for something in between - and they all came out great. Furthermore, the development/restoration of Samantha and Reaper's brother-sister relationship was very well done - another area where the film had the potential to go downhill in a hurry, but didn't.And, on a totally geeky note, the first person sequence...rocked!! (I know, I know...not much for the story-telling aspect...but a little nod to the gamers isn't too much to ask for, is it? ;-) )Anyhow, I own the widescreen version, and plan to get the blu-ray. I highly recommend this movie, with the caveat that you should expect it to be very different from the game. Also, for those viewing with the family, keep in mind that this is a video-game-to-movie title -- there is a decent amount of sci-fi gore, (in the unrated version, at least) a brief scene of zombie-nudity ( :P ), and, of course, Portman's * ahem * commentary...so, depending on the age/exposure of your kids, this might not be the best selection for family movie night. :-)That said, let me reiterate - imho, Doom is a great movie, and I strongly recommend it if you want a fun action flick.5/5",5,"""They're Marines, Sam, not poets...""

959225,AQZJBVSPWR2LF,B000CNER1S,Ravenova,"[13, 16]","Once again, the entire premise of the Doom idea has been drastically altered. Surprisingly, although this movie is not an accurate portrayal of the original Doom story, I found it to be massively entertaining and to have a more believable and a more highly developed story line than the original Doom game and subsequent novels. I expected to greatly dislike this movie since it is not true to the original Doom idea that was perpetrated through the first installation in the Doom game series. However, I was greatly pleased to discover that this movie was far better than I could have ever suspected and greatly surpassed the original Doom stories. Also, many claim that this film has no basis in the Doom games. However, it was based on the new and better story line that was developed in the most recent Doom release, Doom III.It all begins in the year 2046 when the archeological site on Olduvai, Mars, discovers that something beyond their nightmares is now creeping along the corridors, seeking the lives of whoever comes too near. In a desperate attempt to regain control of the UAC installation, retrieve crucial research data, and banish the horror that now dwells within it, an elite force of Marines is sent to Mars to decontaminate the facility which has been placed under quarantine until the unearthly creatures are removed. As the Marines force their way deeper into the UAC building, disturbing events begin to transpire and the situation attains a hopeless feel as more and more of the brave soldiers are slain by their mysterious adversaries. What are these grotesque creatures? Where did they come from and what is their ultimate goal? Will Sarge and the remaining Marines be able to contain the threat or will these new horrors soon be coming to earth?  As the plot of the movie unfolds, the true nature of the creatures is revealed in a shocking climax.I was surprised to discover that this movie, unlike so many horror/action movies contains more than sequences of gratuitous violence and graphic gore. The plot and general theme of the story was deeper and contained a greater amount of relevance than the Doom series has attained thus far. I was intrigued by the scientific data and the shocking revelation of the real truth behind the innocent ""research"" that was supposedly transpiring in the UAC facility. Although this same theme of corporate corruption and experiments gone awry has been done an innumerable amount of times, I was still unprepared for the final revelation and was pleased to see that the idea was taken a step further into the realm of morality.I was astounded at the level of characterization presented in this movie. Although the film contained many action sequences and suspenseful scenes in desolate and forbidding corridors, there was a great deal of attention concentrated on the characters' personalities and how they were coping with such depressing and hopeless circumstances. Each character had their own side stories, the most memorable story being that of Reaper who is returning to Olduvai where the ghosts of his tragic childhood most haunt him. Upon his arrival, he discovers his sister, Samantha, is still residing on the planet that he abhors continuing the archeological research that was his parents' demise. Many other characters are also given their own stories most notably, Portman, Duke, and the Kid. As the story progress and the situation worsens, one of the most prominent characters begins to change personalities causing a shocking betrayal to be imminent. Who will survive the evil that has been unleashed on Mars?As many have already noted, this film does not contain many vivid monster scenes. Instead, it concentrates more on the physiological trauma of the characters as they wonder the darkened halls hearing strange and disquieting noises. I found this to be the cause of much suspense. If monsters had been presented often, the suspenseful feel of the movie and the curiosity of the characters toward these hideous creatures would have been eliminated. Instead, the focus of the movie was more on what you are unable to see lurking at the farther end of the corridor than on various monster forms from the game. However, towards the end of the movie in the first person shooter sequence more grisly monster scenes and scenes of carnage are presented for the more bloodthirsty viewer's satisfaction.I found the conclusion of the movie to be most satisfying. Although, the hand to hand combat scene between Sarge and the Reaper was, to state it generously, ridiculous. The acclaimed first person shooter sequence was well done, however it did not fit either with the scene before it nor with the subsequent scene. In my opinion, it would have been better if this sequence had been displayed earlier in the movie instead of being forced into the most touching and surprising scene between the Reaper and his sister. Overall, I found the ending well done and vastly intriguing. I was delighted to see the movie end on an unexpectedly happy note.I felt that the acting was superbly done and well executed. I was completely drawn into the suspense and the tension of the situation. I especially enjoyed the conflict between the Reaper and his sister and the eventual outcome proved to be most touching. The character of Sarge was well presented and proved to be very formidable. All the members of the cast did an excellent job portraying their characters and enabled me as the viewer to feel as though I was in the story wandering the lonely corridors with them.The extra features presented on this DVD were very satisfactory and surprisingly enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the documentary on the Doom game entitled ""Doom Nation"". Other features were entitled Basic Training, Rock Formation, Master Monster Makers, First Person Shooter Sequence, Game Onl, and Doom 3 Xbox Demon. The cinematography and monster makeup were well done. The only element that I was not entirely satisfied with was the sound. Doom was one of those movies that has to be turned up to a setting you almost never use on your television since the dialogue and even the music are surprisingly quiet.For Doom Fans - - - - - >This rendition of the Doom idea is not true to the original Doom game, which transpired on Mar's moons, Phobos and Deimos, and claimed that the monsters were in actuality demons. No port to hell is opened or even mentioned as existing. Also, this film is not true to the Doom novels, which also took place on Phobos and Deimos and claimed that the monsters were alien invaders. No hyperspace tunnel to another realm is presented as it was in these novels nor mentioned as existing. The original monsters such as the fire throwing imp, the grotesque centaur who threw green fire, the Cacodemon, the Cyberdemon, and the menacing Spidermind are not included. Although, a new and improved version of the BFG is present. This film is entirely based on Doom III and does not relate to the original Doom or any of its novels. The monsters portrayed in this film can all be located only in Doom III.In conclusion, this movie contains elements that will appeal to everyone. For those of you who enjoy violent action movies you will not be disappointed with the many well done and suspenseful action sequences. For those of you who enjoy twisting plots and stellar characterization as well as some scientific information then you will find this to be highly enjoyable. And for those of you who are just searching for a good story then you have located it in this film! However, if you a looking for an exact rendition of the original Doom idea you will be disappointed. This story is not the original Doom story and should not be expected to revive the first Doom experience. This story is based entirely on the ideas and monsters presented in Doom III.

I went into this knowing nothing of the movie's premise-except the it stars The Rock and Karl Urban-who I like in other films.My biggest problem with the movie is casting Rock as the villian. Like many-I see him as the next generation's Schwarznegger. You'd hardly EVER see Arnold as the villian-big time no-no. I think the Rock got bad advice to play Sarge in this film.This movie is strictly ""shoot um up"" action movie. I was expecting much more hand to hand fight sequences with Rock and others, but it's unfortunately the ""blast everything in sight"" variety instead. While that can be fun-it's was not done in any sort of original way. Maybe you have to have some knowledge of the game to enjoy the movie-cause without it-I've seem Sci Fi channel TV movies that are better than this.Lastly-a warning for those who know nothing of this film. It is ULTRA gory and violent. Body parts flying off, zombie like creatures biting and eating people, gory creatures, heads being blown off-you get the idea.

959231,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000CNER1S,RMurray847,"[2, 3]","When one contemplates watching a movie like DOOM, surely ones expectations are always pretty low.  Lots of gory sci-fi action is probably all one can hope for.  DOOM provides a fair dose of that...but it also provides other, less welcome aspects...mostly involving guys with big guns walking around dark, steel corridors doing nothing but looking anxious and sweating.I understand that action scenes and such are pretty expensive to make, particularly when they call for convincing CGI monsters.  But to pad the story to feature length by filling it with interminable scenes like this makes the whole enterprise virtually fall apart.  Having just seen the ""unrated director's cut"" at 1:53, I would say the film EASILY has 30 minutes of utterly unneeded padding.Set in the future, a group of marines is dispatched to a research station on Mars, where a significant portion of the base is on lockdown after some kind of mysterious, violent event took place.  The marines, led by ""Sarge"" (The Rock, before he had gone to being Dwayne Johnson and playing a Tooth Fairy) are a typically diverse group, with nary an original character in sight.  Karl Urban is the nominal 2nd in command, and it just so happens that his estranged sister (Rosamund Pike) is a scientist at the station.They poke around for awhile, and after a LONG time, find some monsters and the gunplay commences.  And it all feels like little more than a third-rate ALIENS rip-off.  Monsters appearing behind marines, above marines and below marines.  Our characters picked off one by one.  A conspiracy that implicates the scientists in some pretty shady experiments.  And so forth, from one unoriginal idea to another.Again, that would almost be okay, because it's the action we came for.  But until the last 15 minutes or so, the action feels complete rote and uninspired.  Fortunately, the film goes from being a complete waste of time to a mostly complete waste of time when it finally turns into a direct homage to the classic video game on which it is based.  (In case you didn't know, DOOM was an early - and extremely successful - ""first person shooter"" where the game is played as though through the view of the player.  You see your own gun in front of you and move through corridors and chambers, shooting everything that moves.)  Urban takes on this view and for about five minutes, we get the fun of seeing a beloved, but very old, video game brought to life.  It even emulates the flowing style of the character moving through space...a movement that it trying to emulate real life but doesn't quite.  This is good, clean fun...something the rest of the film misses.The performers are all unremarkable, even Pike, who bounces from these modern action films (DIE ANOTHER DAY) to high-quality projects like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and her wonderful work in AN EDUCATION.  Urban is bland and The Rock is all attitude and no real character.  The special effects were also merely adequate, and the soundtrack was all generic blaring techno.In summation, there really isn't a good reason to see this film.

very well.The Rock,known only here as The Sarge,is one hard nosed,by the book soldier.It seems there is a level 5 security breech at Olduvai Research Station situated on the planet Mars.It's supposed to be an archeological- only dig but a very selective virus has managed to infect several members of the site team.It's up to the Sarge,his right hand man John(Urban) and the rest of the military team to go to Mars and shut down and contain the breech.To get there all must travel through the ""ark"".This is,for lack of a better description,like a watery ball that comes up out of the middle of the floor and when one stands close enough,one gets sucked into and transported directly to the Mars site.Once the entire team arrives the adrenaline starts pumping for them and for us.They make their way methodically through the site labs,meeting up with scientist(and Urbans' sister) Samantha(Rosamund Pike).They go room by room and area by area until they start making contact with the ""breech"".As they ""eliminate"" one breech another eventually appears.It seems the lead scientists they are seeking are the ones responsible for much of the trouble and are infecting each other,but before they can fully comprehend this they are up to their elbows in trouble.The Sarge,unbeknownst to the others and even himself,gets infected early on by coming in contact with comtaminated blood.As things progress his behaviour becomes more and more agressive and erratic until he orders the murder of innocent and uninfected scientists and their families and even shoots one of his own rookie soldiers.During one of the last attacks on the surviving group Urban is injured and the Sarge is taken away.In order to save her brother Samantha injects him with C-24,which is a serum derived from the ancient indigenous population of Mars who have 24 chromosomes.This has the effect of not only saving his life but heightening and enhancing his physical and mental abilities to an unheard of degree.By this time The Sarge returns pretty much converted into one of the monsters they originally came to hunt down.A battle royale ensues which ends up back on Earth,but fortunately for the moment is still contained below ground.It is a back and forth fight for life, but the Sarge is sent back to Mars with a live grenade in hot pursuit,which destroys him.The movie does a good job of keeping the atmosphere dark and gloomy throughout its' 113 minutes and once the group lands on Mars the paranoic level remains high.It is so good in fact that it helps gloss over the weak spots that appear along the way,dialogue or plot related.One nice spot comes at approximately the 90 minute mark where for about five minutes the movie reverts to its' gamer roots and turns into a FPS(first person shooter) demo.We become Urban,whose rifle in the foreground snakes through the corridors and around corners shooting and killing each and every creature it comes into contact with.You almost wish you had a controller in your hand to take control of the action on the screen!This unrated and extended edition DVD includes several mini docs on the making of the movie,an extended FPS secquence,tips for playing the real game and if you have an X-Box you can play the Doom 3 demo right from this disc!Presented in a clear and clean anamorphic 2:35:1 ratio,this movie is a heart thumping,testosterone filled 113 minute thrill

959233,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000CNER1S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[22, 23]","Doom (Andrzej Bartkowiak, 2005)It took fourteen years, but one of the finest videogames of all time finally made it to the big screen. And there are some of us who've been waiting the whole time. And we get a movie starring The Rock?The big surprise is, it's not all that bad.Sure, it's possible to nitpick. What's a Doom movie without revenants, lost souls, archviles, rocket launchers, and for the love of all that's holy the cyberdemon?But when it comes right down to it, why not The Rock in a movie about a bunch of Marines fighting creatures from the depths of Hell? At least they didn't cast Steven Seagal. And when you've only got a little over an hour and a half, you have to cut a few things. At least we got the BFG. (And I wish the BFG's effect in the game was half as cool as its effect in the movie.)The plot, what little there is (and pay attention, because it's different than the game, in one major aspect): A colony on Mars, originally started to support an archaeological dig, shut it down after weird, mysterious things began happening. Without anyone knowing, the head of the genetics lab, Dr. Carmack (Robert Russell, of the recent Dune TV miniseries), has reopened the archaeological dig, putting everyone in the colony in grave danger. They don't know that, of course, until it's far too late. They discover remains who have some pretty odd characteristics, which intrigue Carmack. He does some experiments that go, shall we say, awry. Marines, headed up by Sarge (The Rock), head to Mars in order to find out what's going on. Things blow up.Doom the movie, like Doom the game, is a turn your brain off and watch things getting killed experience. If you were expecting high art, were you playing the same game the rest of us were? This is a movie that's all about violence, special effects, and things blowing up. And that's pretty hard to mess up, as long as you get halfway competent actors and a crack special effects team. Andrzej Bartkowiak (whose name is not Uwe Boll, something for which we can all thank whatever we hold holy) delivers both, and does it in style. The Rock heads up a rather capable acting team-- Reaper (The Chronicles of Riddick's Karl Urban), Duke (Resident Evil: Apocalypse's Raz Adoti), Destroyer (The Four Feathers' Deobia Oparei), The Kid (Al Weaver, recently in Radford's Merchant of Venice adaptation), Goat (Ian Fleming: Bondmaker's Ben Daniels), Mac (Phobia's Yao Chin), and Portman (Munich's Richard Brake).

So I was shocked when it turned out to be a reasonably good movie.The story outline is formulaic and recycled: A special forces unit is dispatched to Mars contain an outbreak of mutant zombies. But as the story unfolds, there were a lot of developments that surprised me. One such development is that it turns out that the Rock can act. He was effective and at the same time quite entertaining in his role as Sarge. Rock's character was a homicidal maniac. But he was also a soldier following orders - trying to prevent the spread of a disease capable of killing millions. Dwayne Johnson struck a fine balance betweencampiness and realism that few have ever really pulled off.I am a little surprised by all the negative reviews. Come on, what do you people want?

959240,ALEEUYVH3Q5SE,B000CNER1S,Sandor Swartz,"[3, 3]","I didn't think it was possible. I thought there was NO way to make a movie that was both completely consistent with the game and yet be an awesome movie. And I was right. But this comes REALLY close to attaining the former constraint and blows away the latter with a BFG 9000. After all, the game is pretty much one guy fighting, unless you have it in multiplayer deathmatch. Not a lot of room for dialogue. It COULD be the story that leads up to the moment the game starts, but I think the route they went was better and it still did the game justice. My hat's off to you, Mr. Wells (the writer), you really did this thing right!I was pleased to see that the preview I saw was all lies. The premise had nothing to do with mapping the human genome gone horribly wrong (which would have been stupid), and everything was out of context. Which made the surprises all the more grand. And there are some MAJOR surprises in this movie. Fortunately I saw it in the theater first, before someone spoiled it for me. I was just kind of expecting it to be a general sort of fight-fight-fighting movie, like say, Blade, but this really had some bizarre, brilliant, unexpected twists. Imagine my surprise when The Rock gets dragged off by the monsters and shouts ""Hey, I'm not supposed to die!"" That would be like.... well, think back to when you first saw the movie Predator. what would have your reaction been if Schwarzenegger got killed halfway through the movie? You'd have said... ""What?""And oh, does this movie ever have a climax! The finale is THE greatest one-on-one fight I have ever seen in any movie. THE greatest anything-on-anything fight I have ever seen in any movie. Like I've seen anything like that in real life. THE greatest anything-on-anything fight I have ever seen. Now, I knew from the movie's website that there was going to be a sequence that was going to be like playing the game, but I didn't know how they were going to pull it off, and half expected that I had misunderstood something, and that REALLY wasn't going to be what would go down because it would be kinda dumb, but they DID it, and it WASN'T. A nice little homage to the game itself as it is played. If it were any longer, it would have started to become annoying (like watching someone ELSE play a video game - you then say ""my turn, my turn!"") but as it is, it is simply an innovative, never-before-seen-in-a-movie viewpoint. Exploring new frontiers. Memento explored the frontier of chronological order, Dragonfly and the 6th Sense demonstrated some weird perspectives (though I'm not sure if they were completely new), but I really don't think anyone has ever done anything quite like this. I keep a list of my favorite movies of all time (a rather extensive list, not the sort of thing one composes off the top of one's head in one sitting or one day), and this sucker just made number 3, right between ""Spaceman"" and ""The Triplets of Belleville"". I think ""Spaceman"" was just a smidgeon more awesome. Poor Triplets of Belleville. Dropping to number 4 like that. It's just not fair.Just as long as they never do the unthinkable and make a Commander Keen movie. Now THERE'S a TERRIBLE idea!

959244,A3O7ZQ7DKQ9KQA,B000CNER1S,sci fi fan,"[0, 0]","I'll keep it short but hopefully interesting as to why this movie is worth viewing despite obvious flaws and failings, first of all the strongest element of this film is the setting, some extremely interesting and convincing environments, research labs, chambers, all very well done, and not cheap looking at all. Monsters always look great, and the director does a good job of keeping the monsters hidden most of the time from camera view, so there is some actual suspense as to when the monsters will appear. Now for the story, - this film actually has a real story, and is not just a shootem-up like I expected, and maybe in some ways this doesn't work. It may have been better just to say there are all these evil aliens and then have the film about fighting them and that's all. But instead, the film actually surprises with an attempt at an immersive and deep story, and I still am not sure what to make of it.

959245,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B000CNER1S,Scooter McGavin,"[5, 9]","For most males of my generation, much of the mid nineties were devoted to sitting in front of the computer playing the granddaddy of all shooters, Doom. Before the game, most video games were family friendly plat formers like Mario Brothers and even games that involved killing things like The Legend of Zelda, the killing was very cartoonish. But with Doom, you took a first person account of blasting hell spawn and zombies complete with blood spatter. There was even a time that there more computers that had some form of Doom on it than Windows. The game eventually gave way to the gorier Quake that featured multiplayer through the internet so you could now spend day on end killing your dorm mates.Then over ten years after its original release and a year after a third installment in the series hit computer screens a movie tie-in made it to theaters despite ever other movie that was based on a videogame has sucked massively. Well of course the one exception being Super Mario Bros. with Bob Hopkins playing the red overall wearing plumber. Okay, enough sarcasm. Transferring Doom into a movie is an odd choice due to the video game being a first person shooter with evil doers being the only other characters in the game. So some changes had to be made for the transition to the big screen. First instead of one space marine shipped off to Mars, we get eight. The biggest change though is that the evil doers don't come out of portal from hell. Where the actually come from in the movie is bit of a spoiler and I won't tell you where or how not because I don't want to spoil you, instead because it's extremely complicated.There in lies one of the big problems with the movie, its way too complicated for a film based on a game where all you had to know was kill anything that moves. When the marines hit Mars, they run into a bunch of scientists that bog down the dialog with way too many big words that you needed to take upper level biology and archeology courses in college to understand. The other big problem is you can't see anything, ever. The lighting in the movie is so dark, even when the evil doers come on screen it's hard to be scared because you have no clue what you are looking at. The only part of the film that old school gamers can appreciate is they discover of the BFG (my censors won't let me tell you what it completely stands for but ""B"" is big and ""G"" is gun) and the segment where film takes on a first person view. But even those inclusions would make it worth sitting through the rest of the film.",1,We're Gonna Need Something with a Little Bit More Kick,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,2536,"['most', 'males', 'generation', 'much', 'mid', 'nineties', 'were', 'devoted', 'sitting', 'front', 'computer', 'playing', 'granddaddy', 'shooters', 'Doom', 'game', 'most', 'video', 'games', 'were', 'family', 'friendly', 'plat', 'formers', 'Mario', 'Brothers', 'even', 'games', 'involved', 'killing', 'things', 'Legend', 'Zelda', 'killing', 'was', 'very', 'cartoonish', 'Doom', 'took', 'first', 'person', 'account', 'blasting', 'hell', 'spawn', 'zombies', 'complete', 'blood', 'spatter', 'was', 'even', 'time', 'there', 'more', 'computers', 'had', 'form', 'Doom', 'Windows', 'game', 'eventually', 'gave', 'way', 'gorier', 'Quake', 'featured', 'multiplayer', 'internet', 'could', 'now', 'spend', 'day', 'end', 'killing', 'dorm', 'mates.Then', 'ten', 'years', 'original', 'release', 'year', 'third', 'installment', 'series', 'hit', 'computer', 'screens', 'movie', 'tie-in', 'made', 'theaters', 'ever', 'other', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'videogame', 'sucked', 'massively', 'Well', 'course', 'one', 'exception', 'being', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'Bob', 'Hopkins', 'playing', 'red', 'overall', 'wearing', 'plumber', 'Okay', 'enough', 'sarcasm', 'Transferring', 'Doom', 'movie', 'odd', 'choice', 'due', 'video', 'game', 'being', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'evil', 'doers', 'being', 'only', 'other', 'characters', 'game', 'changes', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'transition', 'big', 'screen', 'First', 'instead', 'one', 'space', 'marine', 'shipped', 'Mars', 'get', 'eight', 'biggest', 'change', 'though', 'evil', 'doers', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'portal', 'hell', 'Where', 'actually', 'come', 'movie', 'bit', 'spoiler', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'how', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'instead', 'extremely', 'complicated.There', 'one', 'big', 'problems', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'complicated', 'film', 'based', 'game', 'where', 'had', 'know', 'was', 'kill', 'anything', 'When', 'marines', 'hit', 'Mars', 'run', 'bunch', 'scientists', 'bog', 'down', 'dialog', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'big', 'words', 'needed', 'take', 'upper', 'level', 'biology', 'archeology', 'courses', 'college', 'understand', 'other', 'big', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'ever', 'lighting', 'movie', 'so', 'dark', 'even', 'when', 'evil', 'doers', 'come', 'screen', 'hard', 'be', 'scared', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'old', 'school', 'gamers', 'can', 'appreciate', 'discover', 'BFG', 'censors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'tell', 'what', 'completely', 'B', 'big', 'G', 'gun', 'segment', 'where', 'film', 'first', 'person', 'view', 'even', 'inclusions', 'would', 'make', 'worth', 'sitting', 'rest', 'film']",N/A
959246,A2DMEJI0Z0H99J,B000CNER1S,Scott Promish,"[1, 2]","Loosely based on the phenomenally popular computer game series from id Software, DOOM follows a handful of marines sent to investigate an unknown disturbance at a Martian research facility.  Things quickly grow out of their control, however, and disturbing secrets about what's really been going on there are eventually uncovered.Fans are bound to be disappointed by this halfhearted translation of the DOOM franchise.  The premise has been radically altered, much to the film's detriment.  Rather than being the result of an opened portal to Hell (or even an alien world), the antagonists in the film are genetic experiments gone awry.  What this means is that the only monsters you'll get to see are the ones that can be passed off as mutated humans.  With the exception of the ubiquitous zombies (also seen in the slightly betterResident Evil, another game-to-movie with much wasted potential) and a single appearance of one other creature telegraphed well in advance by virtue of a particular character's nickname, only two of the game creatures make an appearance.  Those creatures have sadly been reduced to simple brutes: no special attacks, just mauling, biting, and other basic physical violence.  Remember how you couldn't wait to see what the designers' imaginations had cooked up as you progressed through the games?  Don't get those hopes up for this.  What you see in the first half hour is more or less what you get.  And that's not much.As for the non-gamers in the audience, I suspect they'll be even more bored, since they won't even appreciate the few nods to the game that are present.I could go on about the fourth-rate acting, the laughably moronic script, and the cheap look of the production in general, but the bottom line is that DOOM commits the worst sin a movie made from a video game could do: it simply isn't any fun.The DVD contains the usual behind-the-scenes and effects featurettes but most interesting is a retrospective look at the evolution of the game series and its fan base.  This is a great nostalgia trip for those of us who have been playing since the first shareware discs began circulating - especially if you haven't looked at those classic games in a while.",2,"""I'm not supposed to die!""",1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,2205,"['Loosely', 'based', 'phenomenally', 'popular', 'computer', 'game', 'series', 'id', 'Software', 'DOOM', 'handful', 'marines', 'sent', 'investigate', 'unknown', 'disturbance', 'Martian', 'research', 'facility', 'Things', 'quickly', 'grow', 'control', 'however', 'disturbing', 'secrets', 'what', 'really', 'been', 'going', 'are', 'eventually', 'uncovered.Fans', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', 'halfhearted', 'translation', 'DOOM', 'franchise', 'premise', 'been', 'radically', 'altered', 'much', 'film', 'detriment', 'Rather', 'being', 'result', 'opened', 'portal', 'Hell', 'even', 'alien', 'world', 'antagonists', 'film', 'are', 'genetic', 'experiments', 'gone', 'awry', 'What', 'only', 'monsters', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'are', 'ones', 'can', 'be', 'passed', 'off', 'mutated', 'humans', 'exception', 'ubiquitous', 'zombies', 'also', 'seen', 'slightly', 'betterResident', 'Evil', 'game-to-movie', 'much', 'wasted', 'potential', 'single', 'appearance', 'one', 'other', 'creature', 'telegraphed', 'well', 'advance', 'virtue', 'particular', 'character', 'nickname', 'only', 'two', 'game', 'creatures', 'make', 'appearance', 'creatures', 'have', 'sadly', 'been', 'reduced', 'simple', 'brutes', 'special', 'attacks', 'just', 'mauling', 'biting', 'other', 'basic', 'physical', 'violence', 'Remember', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'designers', 'imaginations', 'had', 'cooked', 'up', 'progressed', 'games', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'up', 'What', 'see', 'first', 'hour', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'get', 'not', 'much.As', 'non-gamers', 'audience', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'be', 'even', 'more', 'bored', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'appreciate', 'few', 'nods', 'game', 'are', 'present.I', 'could', 'go', 'fourth-rate', 'acting', 'laughably', 'moronic', 'script', 'cheap', 'look', 'production', 'general', 'bottom', 'line', 'DOOM', 'worst', 'sin', 'movie', 'made', 'video', 'game', 'could', 'do', 'simply', ""n't"", 'fun.The', 'DVD', 'usual', 'behind-the-scenes', 'effects', 'featurettes', 'most', 'interesting', 'retrospective', 'look', 'evolution', 'game', 'series', 'fan', 'base', 'great', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'first', 'shareware', 'discs', 'began', 'circulating', 'especially', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'classic', 'games', 'while']",N/A

959258,AEMBUPROMU8EI,B000CNER1S,Su,"[2, 2]","Something has gone horribly amiss at the scientific settlement of Olduvai on the planet of Mars, and a panicked Dr Carmack (named after the co-founder of ID Software, which released the game) calls for assistance. Cue the Sarge (Dwayne Johnson, former WWE wrestler ""The Rock"",The Scorpion King (Widescreen Collector's Edition)) and his men - a Special Forces team, the RRTS (Rapid Response Tactical Squad), who are dispatched via the transport system called the ""arc"" to place the site under quarantine and find out what is going on. When they arrive at the settlement they discover more of a problem than they expected.One of the RRTS team has previous experience of Olduvai - his parents were killed on an archaeological dig and his twin sister, Sam (Rosamund Pike), who followed their footsteps, is working on Olduvai. John Grimm known as ""Reaper"" (Karl Urban -Out of the Blue, Bones inStar Trekand Eomer in theThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)) is apprehensive about going back.People tend to fall into one of two camps where this film is concerned - you are either a fan of the games or you haven't seen/played the games.I came to this film without knowing about the video games (in all honesty I'd never heard of the games prior to getting the film), so I came with an open mind and I enjoyed the film for what it is - an action flick with zombies thrown in. The basic story is set up in the first 10-15 minutes after that you simply hang on and watch the action.Not having played the games before I watched the film I did not understand the problem with the demons (or lack of them), yet there is a nod to them in various places throughout the film. Nor did I understand the First Person Shooter scene towards the end of the film. Since watching the film I have purchased the gamesDoom Collector's EditionandDoom 3and have started playing (well, I'm trying) and I now understand the disappointment - but it doesn't stop this being a great action film.On the first few viewings I didn't get the First Person Shooter sequence near the end of the film, since I have started playing the games I now get it and actually jump when some of the monsters appear. For gamers it includes the Big Force Gun (BFG).There are extras (basic training, rock formation, master monster makers, first person shooter sequence, doom nation and game on). There are also subtitles - I know from personal experience that subtitles tend to contain an edited text of what is spoken. These subtitles, however, contain out-and-out errors - for example: ""on you Duke"" becomes ""funny Duke"" (which makes no sense in the scene); ""airway's clear"" becomes ""now he's clear""; and so on - a friend of mine does subtitling and tells me that they get a copy of the script to work from, so there is no excuse for errors like these.If you are into film errors I spotted a couple: one error happens when they are trying to resuscitate one of their team the heart monitor is bleeping and then goes flat line - only then do they put the chest lead connectors on the patient (but still don't connect the leads); I've yet to meet a sergeant/serjeant that will accept being called ""sir""; and US Marines never call each other soldier.I tend to refer to this as Resident Evil in space. It's one of those films which can be watched without too much brain power. It is a great action film which I have enjoyed watching over and over again.",4,enjoyable and fun action film,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,3453,"['Something', 'gone', 'horribly', 'amiss', 'scientific', 'settlement', 'Olduvai', 'planet', 'Mars', 'panicked', 'Dr', 'Carmack', 'named', 'co-founder', 'ID', 'Software', 'released', 'game', 'assistance', 'Cue', 'Sarge', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'former', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'Rock', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'men', 'Special', 'Forces', 'team', 'RRTS', 'Rapid', 'Response', 'Tactical', 'Squad', 'who', 'are', 'dispatched', 'transport', 'system', 'called', 'arc', 'place', 'site', 'quarantine', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'When', 'arrive', 'settlement', 'discover', 'more', 'problem', 'expected.One', 'RRTS', 'team', 'previous', 'experience', 'Olduvai', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'archaeological', 'dig', 'twin', 'sister', 'Sam', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'who', 'followed', 'footsteps', 'working', 'Olduvai', 'John', 'Grimm', 'known', 'Reaper', 'Karl', 'Urban', '-Out', 'Blue', 'Bones', 'inStar', 'Trekand', 'Eomer', 'theThe', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Trilogy', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'Special', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'apprehensive', 'going', 'back.People', 'tend', 'fall', 'one', 'two', 'camps', 'where', 'film', 'concerned', 'are', 'either', 'fan', 'games', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen/played', 'games.I', 'came', 'film', 'knowing', 'video', 'games', 'honesty', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'games', 'prior', 'getting', 'film', 'so', 'came', 'open', 'mind', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'what', 'action', 'flick', 'zombies', 'thrown', 'basic', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'first', '10-15', 'minutes', 'simply', 'hang', 'watch', 'action.Not', 'having', 'played', 'games', 'watched', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'problem', 'demons', 'lack', 'yet', 'nod', 'various', 'places', 'film', 'did', 'understand', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'purchased', 'gamesDoom', 'Collector', 'EditionandDoom', '3and', 'have', 'started', 'playing', 'well', ""'m"", 'trying', 'now', 'understand', 'disappointment', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'great', 'action', 'film.On', 'first', 'few', 'viewings', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'sequence', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'started', 'playing', 'games', 'now', 'get', 'actually', 'jump', 'when', 'monsters', 'appear', 'gamers', 'Big', 'Force', 'Gun', 'BFG', 'are', 'extras', 'basic', 'training', 'rock', 'formation', 'master', 'monster', 'makers', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'sequence', 'doom', 'nation', 'game', 'are', 'also', 'know', 'personal', 'experience', 'tend', 'contain', 'edited', 'text', 'what', 'spoken', 'subtitles', 'however', 'contain', 'out-and-out', 'errors', 'example', 'Duke', 'funny', 'Duke', 'sense', 'scene', 'airway', 'clear', 'now', 'clear', 'so', 'friend', 'mine', 'subtitling', 'tells', 'get', 'copy', 'script', 'work', 'excuse', 'errors', 'these.If', 'are', 'film', 'errors', 'spotted', 'couple', 'one', 'error', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'resuscitate', 'one', 'team', 'heart', 'monitor', 'bleeping', 'then', 'flat', 'line', 'only', 'then', 'do', 'put', 'chest', 'lead', 'connectors', 'patient', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'leads', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'meet', 'sergeant/serjeant', 'will', 'accept', 'being', 'called', 'sir', 'US', 'Marines', 'never', 'call', 'other', 'soldier.I', 'tend', 'refer', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'space', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'too', 'much', 'brain', 'power', 'great', 'action', 'film', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'over', 'again']",N/A
959259,A15MPXKU6SXLES,B000CNER1S,"Sunny Skies ""readaholic""","[2, 7]","I will start out by saying I never played the Doom game, but I am always up for some good action mixed with horror. My perception and review of this movie will not be based on the game, because I know nothing about it except the premise. When I am in the mood for an action movie, I am not expecting Oscar-winning performances. If there is a good plot, believable actors and great special effects, I'm a happy camper. Well ? out of 3 is not so good.  This movie is not an Aliens, Predator or Terminator. Hell, it's not even a Tomb Raider or Final Fantasy (both of which are better than this movie).One thing I remember hearing about the Doom game was that it was a shot-`em-up with lots of monsters, action and creepiness. The beginning starts out promising in the lab, but goes down hill from there. After reading about the premise of the Doom game (gateway to Hell opened), I thought that sounded like a fantastic plot...not sure why Hollywood tends to rewrite winning formulas. Anyway, I thought the movie was shot almost in the dark. It was especially difficult to see what was happening during the first third of the movie.Another weird thing was the perspective in the movie changes about 2/3 of the way through. For about 20 minutes, when one of the main characters is injected with the 24th chromosome, you see what is happening on the screen only through his eyes (just like the trailer's I've seen for the Doom game). During this sequence he shoots at third rate ""monsters""... most of them just stand there and wait for him to shoot them!  This is drastically different than the rest of the movie and is really strange. The acting was fair. I thought the ""Rock"", the female scientist, the black guy protecting the female and the male pervert character did an okay job. They also throw in a moral dilemma near the end of the movie that seems to come out of left field. It doesn't even seem to gibe with how the Rock character has acted throughout the first part of the movie.When the guys were fighting the monsters it was so dark it was difficult to see the creatures. That was probably to cover up for poor production and sets and/or substandard creature creation.  Some rooms they go in they turn on lights, the other rooms they never turn on lights. My final say: I was NEVER scared in this movie and that is saying a lot. I'm one of those people that watches scary movies through spread fingers over my face (don't laugh, it's a protection ritual). I never jumped, my heart didn't race, even the special effects didn't make me say wow. I kept waiting, but nothing exciting happened. Don't waste your money.

This movie is NOTHING like the game. For those who haven't played the game, let me explain. In the game, an archeological expedition on mars somehow opens a gateway to Hell. Not only do creatures from Hell start invading this universe, but Hell itself is starting to come through. Your mission, close the gateway and destroy anything that gets in your way. Now, in the Doom movie, there is an archeological expedition on Mars, but there's also a stupid BS story plot about genetically mutating humans by injecting them with DNA from human-like remains they find in the dig. In the game, the monsters were non-stop, and there were many different kinds. In the movie, there are only zombies, monsters, and the one half-monster thing in the end with the stupid Segway-like hindquarters, which isn't explained at all. I mean, why did this guy change into a total different beast than EVERYBODY else? This is just STUPID. Also, the monsters in the game were fearless. In the final scene, monsters are seen running away in fear in the movie, but that would never happen in the game. Also, only a couple of the very cool weapons in the game are used in the movie. And the scenes with the BFG don't do it justice. The monsters in the game weren't interested in converting humans either; they were only interested in killing them. None of this ""selective"" killing and mutating thing like you see in the movie.Ok, so game aside, even if you have never played the game, you'll still think the movie is stupid. The special effects are hokey, the story is stupid, and the acting is horrible. The first few moments of the movie were cool. I thought, hey, this is going to be pretty cool. But it was downhill from there. Even the FPS scenes, which could have been cool, were retarded. I hate this movie. I hate that people will see it and think the game is stupid just because the movie was stupid. The only reason I give it two stars was for the concept of the Arc and of the Nano-walls. By the way, what the heck was the purpose of the nano-walls? Why only were some walls that way? Why even have doors at all if you can have technology that allows you to pass through walls?

959269,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000CNER1S,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 14]","The game is something you play, not watch. I don't know why some film producers keep making movies based on video games such as `Super Mario Brothers' `Tomb Raider' and `Resident Evil.' Like them `Doom' is inspired by a video game of the same name, which I have never played. If I have never played it, that is not because I hate playing computer games. I am sure playing the game is a much better experience than just watching it. You see, I can control (or try to control) the whole situation of the game. In film, you just watch.Still, though I give the film only two stars, watching `Doom' is much better than watching dismally bad `House of the Dead' and perhaps two `Resident Evil' films. It is absolutely meaningless to say that the film's plot is familiar and recycled. There is no other way for anyone to make a film out of shooting game, of which main purpose is to provide the thrills of shooting and being shot, bitten, or killed. Plot is only a starting point.So I didn't complain when the film introduced us to the near future world of the year 2026, and the special force led by `Sarge' played by The Rock sitting before a PC without wearing a shirt. These eight soldiers (including top-billed Karl Urban, the real star of the film) are sent to the laboratory of one corporate facility on Mars, where something went wrong, but what went wrong you can successfully guess before the rescue team. So far everything resembles `Resident Evil,' but even when I noticed that, I didn't boo or leave. No, there is another reason for me to dislike the film.Though Director Andrzej Bartkowiak quite wisely shortened the introductory part of the film, his job gets slack and lazy after the team arrive at Mars. In addition to the poorly designed creatures, the team's prolonged search for the survivors damages the pace of the film, only to make the bigger and better action sequences and shoot-outs in the final chapter less impressive. But this awfully slow-paced middle-part has been seen in the films by Andrzej Bartkowiak, who gave us `Romeo Must Die' and `Exit Wounds' the latter being the last decent film starring Steven Seagal. Certainly photographer-turned-director Bartkowiak can deliver, but he takes too much time before doing that.And in the last shoot-outs, the filmmakers made an interesting decision to insert the shooter's viewpoint while fighting the monsters. As you see on the smaller screen of video game, you see the evil creatures get shot and blown up to pieces, the point of view that shows how a solider sees things over the barrel of a gun. Then I was reminded of two things; one is the point where I started - game is made for us to play. The other is the name of James Cameron, who improved the POV idea by using the video monitors attached to the soldiers. Here I expected to see Cameron's brilliant touch which elevated the clich&eacute;d ideas to the higher places with adrenaline-filled intense direction. Maybe I shouldn't have.`Doom' is not a terrible film. It is a passable fun movie, but I couldn't find the reason why this film should be made.",2,Unimaginative and Passable Shoot-the-Monsters Flick: Better Than 'House of the Dead' But Thas's Not Saying Much,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,3085,"['game', 'something', 'play', 'not', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'film', 'producers', 'keep', 'making', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'games', 'such', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Brothers', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Doom', 'inspired', 'video', 'game', 'same', 'name', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'not', 'hate', 'playing', 'computer', 'games', 'am', 'sure', 'playing', 'game', 'much', 'better', 'experience', 'just', 'watching', 'see', 'can', 'control', 'try', 'control', 'whole', 'situation', 'game', 'film', 'just', 'watch.Still', 'give', 'film', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'watching', 'Doom', 'much', 'better', 'watching', 'dismally', 'bad', 'House', 'Dead', 'perhaps', 'two', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'films', 'absolutely', 'meaningless', 'say', 'film', 'plot', 'familiar', 'recycled', 'other', 'way', 'anyone', 'make', 'film', 'shooting', 'game', 'main', 'purpose', 'provide', 'thrills', 'shooting', 'being', 'shot', 'bitten', 'killed', 'Plot', 'only', 'starting', 'point.So', 'did', ""n't"", 'complain', 'when', 'film', 'introduced', 'near', 'future', 'world', 'year', '2026', 'special', 'force', 'led', 'Sarge', 'played', 'Rock', 'sitting', 'PC', 'wearing', 'shirt', 'eight', 'soldiers', 'including', 'top-billed', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'are', 'sent', 'laboratory', 'one', 'corporate', 'facility', 'Mars', 'where', 'something', 'went', 'wrong', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'can', 'successfully', 'guess', 'rescue', 'team', 'So', 'far', 'everything', 'resembles', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'even', 'when', 'noticed', 'did', ""n't"", 'boo', 'leave', 'No', 'reason', 'dislike', 'film.Though', 'Director', 'Andrzej', 'Bartkowiak', 'quite', 'wisely', 'shortened', 'introductory', 'part', 'film', 'job', 'slack', 'lazy', 'team', 'arrive', 'Mars', 'addition', 'poorly', 'designed', 'creatures', 'team', 'prolonged', 'search', 'survivors', 'damages', 'pace', 'film', 'only', 'make', 'bigger', 'better', 'action', 'sequences', 'shoot-outs', 'final', 'chapter', 'less', 'impressive', 'awfully', 'slow-paced', 'middle-part', 'been', 'seen', 'films', 'Andrzej', 'Bartkowiak', 'who', 'gave', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'latter', 'being', 'last', 'decent', 'film', 'starring', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Certainly', 'photographer-turned-director', 'Bartkowiak', 'can', 'deliver', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'doing', 'that.And', 'last', 'shoot-outs', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'interesting', 'decision', 'insert', 'shooter', 'viewpoint', 'fighting', 'monsters', 'see', 'smaller', 'screen', 'video', 'game', 'see', 'evil', 'get', 'shot', 'blown', 'up', 'pieces', 'point', 'view', 'how', 'solider', 'things', 'barrel', 'gun', 'Then', 'was', 'reminded', 'two', 'things', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'started', 'game', 'made', 'play', 'other', 'name', 'James', 'Cameron', 'who', 'improved', 'POV', 'idea', 'using', 'video', 'monitors', 'attached', 'soldiers', 'Here', 'expected', 'see', 'Cameron', 'brilliant', 'touch', 'elevated', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ideas', 'higher', 'places', 'adrenaline-filled', 'intense', 'direction', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have.', 'Doom', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'passable', 'fun', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'made']",N/A
959270,A1ZWNTA6Q968U2,B000CNER1S,Tyrel_Roo,"[0, 2]","(WARNING - SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!)What is it about video games that draws the attention of movie producers?  Maybe they're fans that want to express their love of the game.  Maybe it's the allure of not having to come up with a story.  Maybe they're just trying to cash in on the crop and profit from the games' popularity.  I personally think it's the latter.  Who knows?Whatever the reason, the fact is that these movies are going to be made, and the results, as we know, are usually iffy.  By that, I mean that they usually suck.  I personally think that ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" and the first ""Resident Evil"" are the only video game movies so far that do their games justice; I thought that ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" was an excellent stand-alone work, and while ""Resident Evil"" had a storyline that was completely different from any of the games, it still had the exact same themes and the exact same feel.The ""Doom"" movie doesn't even do that.  You see, the first ""Doom"" and its rehash, ""Doom 3"", aren't exactly known for their storytelling; bearing this in mind, however, they still have a story:  Scientists at the Union Aerospace Corporation, on Mars, accidentally open a portal to Hell.  Lots of nasties comes through, and only you can stop them and save Earth from being overtaken.  It's pretty vague, but it's still a story.Because it's so vague, I can understand why a director might be compelled to ""fill in"", as it were.  Andrzej Bartkowiak and his writers, however, go way, way, way beyond that.  They threw out out EVERYTHING that gave ""Doom"" what little substance it had and, instead, invented something that's closer to a bad ""Resident Evil"" fanfic, riddled with more holes than a wheel of aged Gruyere, as in:- The whole concept of the Pinky character is bad, his appearance as the ""Doom"" Pinky is anticlimactic and given away right from the character's introduction, and his transformation doesn't make any sense.  Why did he transform into the ""Doom"" Pinky when everybody else that got infected turned into an Imp?- The movie's architecture is even more absurd than that of the games, which is quite an acheivement.  You know how, if you threw a plate of spaghetti at a map of Dallas, Texas, you'd have the layout of the city's roads?  It's like that, only worse.- The ""24th Chromosome"" plot device insulted my intelligence even more than ""Jake and Silent Bob Strike Back"".  It doesn't make any sense.  A chromosome is not the same thing as a virus,  the concept of a virus physically mutating somebody to the extent seen in the movie is absurd, and they are certainly don't have the intelligence needed to pick and choose a victim.  The last time I checked, virii have no intelligence at all, and it is debatable as to whether they are even living things.  At least the ""Resident Evil"" virus, as an artificial organism, is conceivable.  I realize that this is called ""science fiction"" for a reason, but the first word in ""science fiction"" is ""science"".- The final fight between Sarge and whatsisface is laughable and anticlimactic, especially considering that whatsisface's role as the main character is established in the last fifteen minutes or so.- Speaking of Sarge, his descent into madness seems to have been invented in the middle of the movie's production.  It's poorly written, poorly executed, and makes about as much sense in concept as the architecture, Pinky, and ""The 24th Chromosome"".- The whole R.A.T.S. idea was even more silly than ""The 24th Chromosome"".  I was never convinced that it was a formidable police force, especially considering that half of its anonymous thugs were so annoying that I was glad to see them die.  It didn't help the already pedestrian threat of the Imps, either.  Um, some scientists were killed by some critters out in a remote part of the base, so now we have to evacuate the whole facility.  Yeah.- The whole concept of the Ark is also silly.  Apparently, somebody was digging for.. something.. in the middle of the Nevada desert, and they found this blob thing that sent you to Mars if you stepped into it, and they figured out how to control it.  Either that or the whole facility was already there and they altered it for human use, which is not quite as silly, but silly nonetheless.These are only some of the problems.  The only things that make this ""Doom"" are the logo, Mars, the name of the UAC, three of the enemies, and the woefully misused BFG.Look.  I can't keep you from seeing the movie.  If the idea of a hack movie based on an already bad video game doesn't put you off, or if you are morbidly curious, or if you just absolutely have to spend that ten bucks, then go for it.

Certainly there is a lot of blood and gore later on - mind-numbingly so - and the movie does capture the game series' feeling of violent, claustrophobic encounters in dark corriders with the beasties.  The much-mentioned ""first person shooter"" scene near the end is a slightly fun tribute to the game, but as a scene in the movie it doesn't work too well.  A few of the effects are pretty cool, including the ""BFG"" (when fired) and the ARC portal.  However, this movie soon came to feel pointless to me, and I wasn't the only audience member with that reaction.  A guy seated behind me periodically yawned loudly throughout the flick.  Let's hope the studio doesn't waste any bucks on a sequel.  For a better violent action movie based on a video game, I recommend the first Resident Evil film instead of this one.",2,Not a chick flick,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,1068,"['2', '1/2', 'stars', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'game', 'series', 'Doom', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'entertaining', 'expected', 'main', 'problem', 'are', 'few', 'encounters', 'mutant', 'creatures', 'first', '30', '40', 'minutes', 'i.e.', 'not', 'enough', 'going', 'Certainly', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'later', 'mind-numbingly', 'movie', 'capture', 'game', 'series', 'feeling', 'violent', 'claustrophobic', 'encounters', 'dark', 'corriders', 'beasties', 'much-mentioned', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'scene', 'end', 'slightly', 'fun', 'tribute', 'game', 'scene', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'well', 'few', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'including', 'BFG', 'when', 'fired', 'ARC', 'portal', 'However', 'movie', 'soon', 'came', 'feel', 'pointless', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'audience', 'member', 'reaction', 'guy', 'seated', 'periodically', 'yawned', 'loudly', 'flick', 'Let', 'hope', 'studio', ""n't"", 'waste', 'bucks', 'sequel', 'better', 'violent', 'action', 'movie', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'recommend', 'first', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'film', 'instead', 'one']",N/A

A VIDEO GAME that weakly translates into a movie.DOOM's plot is pretty much similar to the game's plot but HOLLYWOOD needs to realize that there is a lot of difference in playing a game, since this has a better chance of immersing you in it and watching a bad sci-fi flick. The movie as usual takes place in Mars, where there has been a report of a major disturbance. THE ROCK'S band of special soldiers get teleported on a search and contain mission and ends up being massacred.I wish I can say more about the film, but it is so shallow I will spoil everything for all those who hasn't seen it. There is some sort of synthesized super-drug that affects good and bad folks differently, so the rest you can figure out. Lots of zombies who can infect people, 2-4 kinds of beasties and ONLY ONE SPECIAL WEAPON used 2-3 times in the movie. The beasts were designed poorly and the effects are nothing you haven't seen before. There is a lot of action and the highlight of the movie is the last fight and it can be viewed as mediocre. An annoying FIRST-PERSON VIEW is in the movie which I don't know why it was there.THE ROCK'S charisma is wasted in this flick, I wish they could have added more depth to the movie like obstacles, radioactive wastes or something (like in the game)The movie has decent action scenes, so there may be some people who thinks it is tight, but it fails in immersing you in the scenes and afterwards you'll feel like you just wasted your afternoon.A good weekend rental, if you're a hard-core video gamer, you might want to add to your collection.

I knew that what made Doom Doom, which is the implementation of the gates of hell, literally, has been removed to give space for some stupid resident-evil-like genetics/virus stuff. Yeah, only that it was more clever even in resident evil. When the big answer to the bizarre monster attacks came I was really laughing out loud. It reminded me of THE SWAMP THING from Wes Craven, where some virus was turning humans into mutants, the good ones becoming super humans, the bad ones becoming evil, mindless monsters. Ups I gave away one seemingly important plot point. Never mind, to know that this kinda ""explanation"" is coming should only serve.Now actually, I wasn't looking for Doom, the gamemovie, I was looking for a stupid, dumb movie where people are being chased throught corridors, where clich&eacute;e shocks like cats jumping out of vent shafts and similiar stuff happens, where a group of people slowly gets decimated by fairly unseen monsters etc. Yeah, at this point the movie succeeds very well. It can't be called trash as it is with movies like ""Biohazard"" etc. Given the explanations you get every now and then, it's a joke. But I liked it enough for what I desired the evening we watched this film. It's just a huge shame they didn't take the idea of hell, even as placative as in the games where hell was a gate to another, burning-caves-like-dimension with red skinned demon and so on. I was told that they didn't use this idea because Warner studios were afraid they'd have to get rid of thousands of thousans of anti-Marylin-Manson-bible-fanatics blocking the theater entrances. It's understandable for the folks in the united states.

As much as I like ""movies made to win oscars"", I equally love mindless action, serious drama, teen comedies and the odd slasher/parody flick. Maybe the one star is a little harsh. The movie wasn't boring at all. I have seen plenty of movies where I literally wanted to RUN out of the movie theatre, wishing I had just used the money to light a cigarette with. I sat through the movie, excited...waiting for ""the part"" where all hell breaks loose and the carnage unleashes...That part never came. The movie is basically a Special Forces-type Squad, looking through a dark Research Wing on a Martian Base. They have lights attached to their guns and they walk around stealthily, investigating strange sounds. Every 10  minutes, a monster jumps out of the dark...shots are fired...dude dies...monster disappears. You can't even see most of the monsters clearly (coz it's dark!). The game (Doom 3) was detailed (almost TOO detailed) and plain beautiful.I'm tempted to believe the average episode of ""The X-Files"" is shot on a bigger budget with better production values. And I'm absolutely certain most ""The X-Files"" episodes have more (and better) action sequences than this dull movie. Even Buffy is more visceral than this!Ask a PC gamer what Doom symbolises: carnage, mayhem, destruction, all hell breaks loose, scary, tense, nerve-rattling and trigger-happy mainacal madness! This movie1) Totally altered the game plot and took inspiration from Resident Evil (Opening a portal to Hell vs. Genetic Research gone bad)2) Stresses on the BFG so much initially, you're sure you're gonna witness a cool BFG shootout in the climax. Never happens.3) Wastes a phenom like The Rock, giving him not a single memorable action sequence...or even a good catch-phrase.4) The camera is too jerky...maybe its supposed to disorient you or I don't know what...you can't ever see the monsters in all their details & glory...probably because the SFX team didn't do a good job and didn't want you to see them up close.5) Isn't the least bit funny...I remember reading a review that described one of the characters as ""The Comic Relief"" in the squad. I honestly can't remember one funny thing he said.I had huge expectations from this movie. I LOVE mindless action movies. Sometimes, I just want to watch things explode in a bloody mess at loud volumes with a stellar picture. For a ""sci-fi"" action thriller based on a horror-themed game, Doom offers absolutely no environment, you won't even ONCE jump out of your seat, you won't break a sweat, you won't feel tense as the music grows louder, you will exclaim to yourself ""WTF"" when the plot turns out to be a rehash of Resident Evil, you will laugh at the pseudo-scientific theory Rosamund Pike comes up with to form the main plot twist (about how the infection affects people) etc.But you will stay glued to your seats, waiting for the action and ""the good doom-style fun"" to start...but alas, that never happens. Not even worth renting. It's just a big...disappointment.

Houp ""RAREfiend""","[3, 5]","Like most adaptations of comic books and video games, Doom has some great ideas but has no idea what to do with them, so it inevitably does nothing whatsoever.  This is a movie that has no aspirations whatsoever.  In most cases, at least a film of this nature will try to full the audience into appreciating it by incorporating cheesy special effects.  Doom doesn't even go that far; I think we've reached a point in Western Civilization where if you know the audience isn't coming to see unique characters, social commentary, or intriguing plot, you should at least satisfy them with something more than men in a rubber suit.  No, they give us a single interesting CGI creature and then have a desultory, one-on-one showdown between two humans.  This kind of climax is more appropriate, more befitting, and certainly more entertaining when it happens among the tumbleweeds of Main Street in a Western.Logically, little makes sense.  Why are there ultra-modernized hallways interspersed with lugubrious, outdated hallways?  Why do the monsters only seem interested in spending time in the spooky hallways?  After seeing the carnage of one BFG blast, why would anyone think about firing it a second time when he is in an artificial environment on a planet with a poisonous atmosphere?  Doesn't an extra chromosome cause Down Syndrome?  But I guess all of this isn't very important, since the plot is fairly irrelevant anyway.  The characters are stock.  And they certainly don't behave with anything resembling practical psychology.  Simply put: I don't believe in them.  Would Samantha really be so open-minded about Duke's repulsive come-ons?  Would the Sarge, who was so considerate as to request Grimm to remain on Earth, really have the change of character that the film depicts?  I don't see the connection.  Perhaps you can explain it to me.Ultimately, I knew I was in for disappointment when the characters were already maneuvering through dark hallways, chased by elusive shadows, and firing at nonexistent enemies while the movie was only twenty minutes old.  I quickly realized that the plot couldn't go in too many new directions if this was already happening.  But then, like most video games, that's all the matters.  The first person experience is interesting, but it is only a gimmick.  And the whole mutation, evolution, monsterization plotline has been done before in countless zombie movies and video game movies; two months from now, I won't be able to separate the plots of Doom and Resident Evil in my mind.
