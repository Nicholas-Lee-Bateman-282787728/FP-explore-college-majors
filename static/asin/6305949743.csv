484241,A2GDEPPC8BAZRY,6305949743,"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[12, 20]","I indeed recommend this film - for any an open mind out there that would revel in the twining of such view, or in the depth of such color ~~ as what is found in this movie...And so, for that prodigious elite who've read this far, I'll bestow upon you a premise and an opinion:  This is a story of Ruth, a young woman who, while in India and in a moment of reverie, wholeheartedly gives away her body and soul to the cult of Chidaatma Baba, no less even to Chidaatma Baba himself.  Her family back in Australia, when they learn of this, invest their every available extreme of effort, time, and money into restoring her to sensibility.  For the task they hire an American, P.J. Waters, a reputed cult exiter.Now, I must say that I've rarely seen two more excellent actors pitted so fatefully against each other than in this instance, with Kate Winslet as Ruth, and Harvey Keitel as P.J.  Ah - and it's a perfect dance of chemistry!As he strives to free her soul, which shakes the core of her beliefs - she strives to free his body, which shakes the core of his passion.  And they both deliver - and succeed ultimately in tearing each other apart.Yet there is no loss of hope - no desolation of feeling to be found at the end of this unique, exhausting film.  I actually found myself lifted higher - an ascendant plane - a scope of optimism - (oh - I could go on, but I'll spare ya, this time...)What really sucked me in - drew me entranced, like air, no matter, into whatever course upon this drama meant to take me - was the music:  Opening with Neil Diamond's HOLLY HOLY, and continuing absolutely flawlessly through every note of every song on the whole balance of this soundtrack.  I mean, really, how can anything be less than beautiful art to the ears and to the soul than the music of both Alanis Morissette and Neil Diamond on the same soundtrack?  And here you have Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel in the same movie!Indeed, Ruth's theme is HOLY HOLLY, her battle-cry YOU OUTA KNOW, while P.J.'s is I AM, I SAID - And Ruth, shouting the lyrics as she speeds down a barren Australian highway, actually adds more passion (a feat I'd never before dreamt possible) to Morissette's YOU OUTA KNOW.  How wonderful!A long time ago, when I was still but a child, Neil Diamond did his own rendition of Leonard Cohen's SUZANNE.  One disappointment in this film was that they did not use this beautiful song, for in the end it was fitting for our heroine and hero's bemusement as their humanity betrays them -  As they struggle to ascend from depths of shame and vulnerability, with Ruth naked and pleading, with P.J.'s plaintive &quot;Be Kind&quot; as he grovels after her wearing a red dress. Suppose that any good life, like any good movie, may be splotched here and there with pain, and with humility.And it's the stuff of such poetry - for among other heart-wrenching stanzas, in the brooding SUZANNE, he sang: &quot;And you want to travel with him - Ah, you want to travel blind - And you think that you may trust him - For he's touched your perfect body - With his mind...&quot;",4,Devastating,972086400,"10 21, 2000",2000,3079,"['indeed', 'recommend', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'there', 'would', 'revel', 'twining', 'such', 'view', 'depth', 'such', 'color', '~~', 'what', 'found', 'movie', 'so', 'prodigious', 'elite', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'far', ""'ll"", 'bestow', 'premise', 'opinion', 'story', 'Ruth', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'India', 'moment', 'reverie', 'wholeheartedly', 'away', 'body', 'soul', 'cult', 'Chidaatma', 'Baba', 'less', 'even', 'Chidaatma', 'Baba', 'family', 'back', 'Australia', 'when', 'learn', 'invest', 'available', 'extreme', 'effort', 'time', 'money', 'restoring', 'sensibility', 'task', 'hire', 'American', 'P.J', 'Waters', 'reputed', 'cult', 'exiter.Now', 'must', 'say', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'seen', 'two', 'more', 'excellent', 'actors', 'pitted', 'so', 'fatefully', 'other', 'instance', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Ruth', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'P.J', 'Ah', 'perfect', 'dance', 'chemistry', 'free', 'soul', 'core', 'beliefs', 'free', 'body', 'core', 'passion', 'deliver', 'succeed', 'ultimately', 'tearing', 'other', 'apart.Yet', 'loss', 'hope', 'desolation', 'feeling', 'be', 'found', 'end', 'unique', 'exhausting', 'film', 'actually', 'found', 'lifted', 'higher', 'ascendant', 'plane', 'scope', 'optimism', 'could', 'go', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'ya', 'time', 'What', 'really', 'sucked', 'drew', 'entranced', 'air', 'matter', 'course', 'drama', 'meant', 'take', 'was', 'music', 'Opening', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'HOLLY', 'HOLY', 'continuing', 'absolutely', 'flawlessly', 'note', 'song', 'whole', 'balance', 'soundtrack', 'mean', 'really', 'how', 'can', 'anything', 'be', 'less', 'beautiful', 'art', 'ears', 'soul', 'music', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'same', 'soundtrack', 'here', 'have', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'same', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'Ruth', 'theme', 'HOLY', 'HOLLY', 'battle-cry', 'YOU', 'OUTA', 'KNOW', 'P.J', 'AM', 'SAID', 'Ruth', 'shouting', 'lyrics', 'down', 'barren', 'Australian', 'highway', 'actually', 'more', 'passion', 'feat', ""'d"", 'never', 'before', 'dreamt', 'possible', 'Morissette', 'YOU', 'OUTA', 'KNOW', 'How', 'wonderful', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'child', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'did', 'own', 'rendition', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'SUZANNE', 'One', 'disappointment', 'film', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'beautiful', 'song', 'end', 'was', 'fitting', 'heroine', 'hero', 'bemusement', 'humanity', 'struggle', 'ascend', 'depths', 'shame', 'vulnerability', 'Ruth', 'naked', 'pleading', 'P.J', 'plaintive', 'quot', 'Be', 'Kind', 'quot', 'wearing', 'red', 'dress', 'Suppose', 'good', 'life', 'good', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'splotched', 'here', 'there', 'pain', 'humility.And', 'stuff', 'such', 'poetry', 'other', 'heart-wrenching', 'stanzas', 'brooding', 'SUZANNE', 'sang', 'quot', 'want', 'travel', 'Ah', 'want', 'travel', 'think', 'may', 'trust', 'touched', 'perfect', 'body', 'mind', 'quot']",Holy Smoke!

484243,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305949743,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","When your big breakout film is `The Piano', which is possibly one of the greatest films ever made, there is a big weight on your shoulders to create something of equal magnitude your next go around.  Campion proved herself a very interesting and unique visionary director with `The Piano', but `Holy Smoke' seems like a giant step backwards.Please note that this is very hard for me to say, beings that I worship the ground Kate Winslet walks on.`Holy Smoke' deals with a very deep and poignant premise; a young woman being brainwashed by religion and her family desperately seeking to free her from her mental bondage.  The premise really could have given birth to a fantastic character study and marvelously rooted importance, especially with Winslet and Keitel onboard, but instead it proves to be a missed opportunity.  The film, although sporting a weighty subject, feels empty; lacking in substance.  It almost makes light of a very tragic subject, and while Winslet tries hard to bring an air of honesty to her performance the script ultimately bogs her down to where her character comes off uninteresting.Ruth Barron, after visiting with friends in India, finds herself under the spell of a certain cult, uprooting her life for a new.  Her friends and family are worried, obviously, and hire a deprogrammer, PJ Waters, to break that spell.  Waters has some issues of his own, issues that in my opinion get in the way of the heart of the story.  We seem to focus more on his relationship with Ruth (as troubled as it may be) instead of the real reason for his entrance into her life.  She is to spend three days with him, and in those three days he is to attempt to bring her to reason.`Holy Smoke' has its moments, moments where Winslet breaks away from the confines of the script and actually relays to the audience the weight of this subject.  You can see in her eyes the deception and then total plunge into confusion as her newfound beliefs come crashing down on her.  Sadly, these moments are few and far in between.  The sub-plots involving Waters and even Ruth's family take center stage and crowd out the real root of the story.Campion loses her grip on this one, but she still has `The Piano' to reference when considering her talent.  Winslet delivers a fine performance, but the script barely gives her room to truly shine.  Many consider this her finest performance, but I consider this more her greatest character, and had that character been written better it could have proved to be her greatest performance.  Keitel, an actor I usually enjoy, is rather uninspired here and delivers a tragically overrated performance.  Yes, Winslet is really the only redeeming factor for this film, and she can only redeem so much on her own.",2,Ultimately goes up in smoke...,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,2750,"['When', 'big', 'breakout', 'film', 'Piano', 'possibly', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'big', 'weight', 'shoulders', 'create', 'something', 'equal', 'magnitude', 'next', 'go', 'around', 'Campion', 'proved', 'very', 'interesting', 'unique', 'visionary', 'director', 'Piano', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'giant', 'step', 'backwards.Please', 'note', 'very', 'hard', 'say', 'beings', 'worship', 'ground', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'walks', 'on.', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'deals', 'very', 'deep', 'poignant', 'premise', 'young', 'woman', 'being', 'brainwashed', 'religion', 'family', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'free', 'mental', 'bondage', 'premise', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'birth', 'fantastic', 'character', 'study', 'marvelously', 'rooted', 'importance', 'especially', 'Winslet', 'Keitel', 'onboard', 'instead', 'be', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'film', 'sporting', 'weighty', 'subject', 'feels', 'empty', 'lacking', 'substance', 'almost', 'light', 'very', 'tragic', 'subject', 'Winslet', 'hard', 'bring', 'air', 'honesty', 'performance', 'script', 'ultimately', 'bogs', 'down', 'where', 'character', 'off', 'uninteresting.Ruth', 'Barron', 'visiting', 'friends', 'India', 'spell', 'certain', 'cult', 'uprooting', 'life', 'new', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'worried', 'obviously', 'hire', 'deprogrammer', 'PJ', 'Waters', 'break', 'spell', 'Waters', 'issues', 'own', 'issues', 'opinion', 'get', 'way', 'heart', 'story', 'seem', 'focus', 'more', 'relationship', 'Ruth', 'as', 'troubled', 'may', 'be', 'instead', 'real', 'reason', 'entrance', 'life', 'spend', 'three', 'days', 'three', 'days', 'attempt', 'bring', 'reason.', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'moments', 'moments', 'where', 'Winslet', 'breaks', 'away', 'confines', 'script', 'actually', 'relays', 'audience', 'weight', 'subject', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'deception', 'then', 'total', 'plunge', 'confusion', 'newfound', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'Sadly', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'sub-plots', 'involving', 'Waters', 'even', 'Ruth', 'family', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'crowd', 'out', 'real', 'root', 'story.Campion', 'grip', 'one', 'still', 'Piano', 'reference', 'when', 'considering', 'talent', 'Winslet', 'fine', 'performance', 'script', 'barely', 'room', 'truly', 'shine', 'Many', 'consider', 'finest', 'performance', 'consider', 'more', 'greatest', 'character', 'had', 'character', 'been', 'written', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'proved', 'be', 'greatest', 'performance', 'Keitel', 'actor', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'rather', 'uninspired', 'here', 'tragically', 'overrated', 'performance', 'Yes', 'Winslet', 'really', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'redeem', 'so', 'much', 'own']",Holy Smoke!

I wanted this movie to be good, but it just wasn't! The story seemed to lag in places, and other times it simply lacked a story at all! Events occured that simply did not make sense! In one scene Kate kisses a girl, but it's never explained, except that she's basically drunk, and dillusional!  In another she goes out in the desert stark naked and starts to urinate on herself! In the next scene she is haveing sex, but the next day she hates him again! It was a well established fact that she was basically a loon, but that was all that was established!The story starts after too many events have already occured. It is explained that Kate and another girl went to India, but the reason is never given, and that she got involved with a cult, while the other girl went back home to Sydney. Kate's mother then goes to India to retrieve her, but her mind is gone. Her parents then bring in a man who's job it is to bring Winslet back to reallity!  But then, she starts a bizarre relationship with him, although in reality this is highly unlikely since the man is at least twice Winslet's age!By the end of the film they both are laying together in the back of a pickup riding on a desert road, their destination is not explained, but in this film, nothing else is either.Kate is usually such a good actress, and she would be in this too, if there had just been a good story!

Tricked by her Mother under the false pretense that her Father is dying, she returns home only to find a professional deprogrammer, PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel) has been hired to bring her back to her ""senses."" Whisked away against her will to a secluded farmhouse in the Outback, a three day confrontation ensues between the two. By the end of the allotted time you're left to wonder who's deprogramming who.I had no expectations concerning the film `Holy Smoke' yet it still took me totally by surprise. Kate Winslet not only demonstrates once and for all how talented an actress she is but displays a sensual side that left me speechless (well nearly anyway). Harvey Keitel also delivers an excellent performance perfectly capturing the subtly of a man slowly moving beyond his clever facade to reveal his true nature within.`Holy Smoke' is definitely a movie in a genre of its own making. What begins as a journey to spiritual self-realization slowly evolves into a psychological tale of sensuality, eroticism and obsession. Add to the mix several intermittent epiphanies reminiscent of a `60's psychedelic voyage through inner space and you have before you a unique one-of-a-kind film. Expect the unexpected when watching for just when everything has fallen apart and lays in shambles the story returns its audience back to the spiritual path and reconciles the combatants for an unexpected conclusion. This film is surely a shamanic tale in a twentieth century setting encompassing the eternal cycle of birth, death and rebirth.

That pushes this  movie a bit over the top toward movie's end as the two stars get more and  more entwined.  I did like, however, the whole idea of a film's turning the  religious deprogramming experience on its head, where the deprogrammer and  not the &quot;religious fanatic&quot; strikes the viewer as the crazy  person.  Experience Winslet's extended family in the movie (Keitel's  employers) for even a little while and you will easily understand how the  religious, withdrawn life would have enormous appeal for her.  I couldn't  stand that family!  This film is sort-of a romance between the characters  played by Keitel and Winslet.  Its not like its writer-director's (Jane  Campion's) &quot;Piano&quot;, which also starred Keitel, but the romance  element is there.  Who convinces whom of his/her beliefs?  Well, you'll  have to see the film to find out that but there is nothing that takes the  expected route in this film.  I enjoyed Keitel even more in the recent  &quot;Finding Graceland,&quot; where he manages to convince me by film's  end that he's Elvis Presley.  I have yet to see Winslet in a role where she  fails to deliver a full blast performance and this was no exception.  I  thought she looked great in her one nude scene.

484250,A13QVQBHH2R1ZB,6305949743,critical reader,"[2, 3]",". . . of Kate Winslet, of Pam Grier, of a great soundtrack, of an intriguing premise, of the beautiful landscape of Australia, of the initial compelling scenes in India . . . I could go on and on about the many missed opportunities here.Kate Winslet's character, Ruth, starts out as a wide-eyed Australian girl who becomes mesmerized by an ashram in India and its leader.  Her family becomes concerned and concocts a plan to bring her back to Australia and rescue her with the help of a professional deprogrammer.  Somewhere along the line, Ruth is able to emotionally overwhelm the deprogrammer and manipulate him.Great premise, right?!  Unfortunately, the whole thing is undone by the uneven tone (is it a slapstick comedy? a melodrama? a character study? an erotic film? - it's all of the above! and it doesn't work!) and so many other problems. Ruth's family is cartoonish.  Harvey Keitel, as the deprogrammer, devolves into a complete mess and - by the end - a scary weirdo. Ruth's character was completely inconsistent - maybe the movie was trying to show her evolving over time, but it was all such a mess that I didn't buy it.  The Ruth/deprogrammer relationship was convoluted and unconvincing.  The dialogue was simply laughable at times.  The ending didn't make much sense from all that we'd seen happen - it was like they hit the 2-hour mark and slapped an ending on.And seriously - has any man ever watched a woman pee down her leg and thought ""God, that's sexy!""

484253,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6305949743,Dennis Littrell,"[24, 25]","Kate Winslet plays Ruth Barron, a young Australian woman who goes to India and becomes smitten with the touch of a charismatic guru, so much so that she changes her name and forsakes her family to stay in India and attend to and worship the guru.  Her parents become alarmed.  Her mother goes to India to trick her into coming back to Australia so that she can be deprogrammed by a professional from the United States that they have hired (P.J. Waters as played by Harvey Keitel).What director Jane Campion does with this once familiar theme is most interesting.  She puts the deprogrammer to the test, so to speak, and initiates a struggle of will between the deprogrammer and his young charge.  The key scene arrives as Ruth comes naked into P.J.'s arms in order to test his professionalism (and her sexual power).  I don't know about you but I think a naked and passionate Kate Winslet would test any man's motivation and make him think twice about what he really wants to do.The psychological idea behind the story is this question, What is the nature of the guru's hold on his flock?  Is it spiritual or is it profane?  Do the young women who follow him desire him as an alpha male or is it spiritual deliverance they seek?  Naturally Ruth believes the latter and the deprogrammer the former.  But what is the deprogammer's motivation?  Is this just a job for him or does he feel he is helping to free his clients from some kind of mental slavery?  Or is he just another sort of phony guru himself?Keitel in black hair and black moustache and devil's mini goatee dressed in black with a menacing look and a lot of physical energy (despite being 60-years-old when this film was released) contrasts sharply with Winslet's youthful beauty and beguiling voluptuousness.  Strength of character is something Kate Winslet brings to any role, even including her outstanding performance as Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996), a role that is usually played wiltingly.  Here one senses that her strong will and determination are going to be quite a match for the deprogrammer who gives himself three days alone with her to break her attachment to the guru.Two questions: One, if he is successful, will that just mean that she has transferred her allegiance from the Indian guru to him?  Will it mean that his psychological strength is greater than that of the guru in far-off India?  Two, in what respect is such a forced confinement with someone who is in physical control going to lead to a variant of the ""Stockholm syndrome"" experienced by some women held hostage, e.g., flight attendants on hijacked planes, and the famous case of Patty Hearst?  Will the captive become enamored of her captor?Campion handles this most interesting theme by focusing on the sexual and carnal nature of the relationships.  The test of will between P.J. and Ruth becomes a question of Can she seduce him and thereby strip him of his professionalism?  The movie is candid about sex and sexuality in a way that emphasizes the power dynamics of sexual relationships.  There is some full frontal nudity and the sex scenes are steamy beyond what one usually sees in an R-rated film.  (If seeing Kate Winslet naked might offend you, I recommend you close your eyes.)Harvey Keitel did an outstanding job in a very demanding role and was entirely convincing (despite being a little too old for the part); but as usual Kate Winslet completely took over the film with her commanding countenance, her superior acting skills, her great concentration and her mesmerizing charisma.  If there is a better, more captivating young actress working today, I don't know who she is.Her role here might be compared with her performance in Hideous Kinky (1998) in which she goes to Morocco to find enlightenment among the Sufis.  That is a more charming film, and she is outstanding, but this one gives greater range to her skills.Notable (and watchable!) as a counterpoint to Winslet's Ruth is sexy and sleazy Sophie Lee as Yvonne who is so taken with P.J. that she fairly begs him to make love to her.  Also impressive is Julie Hamilton as the woebegone and stumbling mother.Of course I would say see this for Kate Winslet, and if you are a fan, you sure don't want to miss Holy Smoke since it includes one of her best performances; however, what really impressed me is the original and daring conception and direction by Jane Campion who is best known for The Piano (1993), a film that received an Oscar nomination for the best direction and starred Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill.So see this for Jane Campion who is not afraid to show human nature in the raw.",4,Can Kate deprogram the deprogrammer?,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,4638,"['Kate', 'Winslet', 'Ruth', 'Barron', 'young', 'Australian', 'woman', 'who', 'India', 'smitten', 'touch', 'charismatic', 'guru', 'so', 'much', 'name', 'family', 'stay', 'India', 'attend', 'worship', 'guru', 'parents', 'become', 'alarmed', 'mother', 'India', 'trick', 'coming', 'back', 'Australia', 'can', 'be', 'deprogrammed', 'professional', 'United', 'States', 'have', 'hired', 'P.J', 'Waters', 'played', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'director', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'once', 'familiar', 'theme', 'most', 'interesting', 'deprogrammer', 'test', 'so', 'speak', 'struggle', 'will', 'deprogrammer', 'young', 'charge', 'key', 'scene', 'Ruth', 'naked', 'P.J', 'arms', 'order', 'test', 'professionalism', 'sexual', 'power', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'naked', 'passionate', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'would', 'test', 'man', 'motivation', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'what', 'really', 'do.The', 'psychological', 'idea', 'story', 'question', 'What', 'nature', 'guru', 'hold', 'flock', 'spiritual', 'profane', 'Do', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'follow', 'desire', 'alpha', 'male', 'spiritual', 'deliverance', 'seek', 'Naturally', 'Ruth', 'latter', 'deprogrammer', 'former', 'what', 'deprogammer', 'motivation', 'just', 'job', 'feel', 'helping', 'free', 'clients', 'kind', 'mental', 'slavery', 'just', 'sort', 'phony', 'guru', 'Keitel', 'black', 'hair', 'black', 'moustache', 'devil', 'mini', 'goatee', 'dressed', 'black', 'menacing', 'look', 'lot', 'physical', 'energy', 'being', '60-years-old', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'sharply', 'Winslet', 'youthful', 'beauty', 'beguiling', 'voluptuousness', 'Strength', 'character', 'something', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'role', 'even', 'including', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Ophelia', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Hamlet', '1996', 'role', 'usually', 'played', 'wiltingly', 'Here', 'one', 'strong', 'will', 'determination', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'quite', 'match', 'deprogrammer', 'who', 'three', 'days', 'alone', 'break', 'attachment', 'guru.Two', 'questions', 'One', 'successful', 'will', 'just', 'mean', 'transferred', 'allegiance', 'Indian', 'guru', 'Will', 'mean', 'psychological', 'strength', 'greater', 'guru', 'far-off', 'India', 'Two', 'what', 'respect', 'such', 'forced', 'confinement', 'someone', 'who', 'physical', 'control', 'going', 'lead', 'variant', 'Stockholm', 'syndrome', 'experienced', 'women', 'held', 'hostage', 'e.g.', 'flight', 'attendants', 'hijacked', 'planes', 'famous', 'case', 'Patty', 'Hearst', 'Will', 'captive', 'become', 'enamored', 'captor', 'Campion', 'most', 'interesting', 'theme', 'focusing', 'sexual', 'carnal', 'nature', 'relationships', 'test', 'will', 'P.J', 'Ruth', 'question', 'Can', 'seduce', 'thereby', 'strip', 'professionalism', 'movie', 'candid', 'sex', 'sexuality', 'way', 'power', 'dynamics', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'steamy', 'what', 'one', 'usually', 'R-rated', 'film', 'seeing', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'naked', 'might', 'offend', 'recommend', 'close', 'eyes', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'very', 'demanding', 'role', 'was', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'usual', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'completely', 'took', 'over', 'film', 'commanding', 'countenance', 'superior', 'acting', 'skills', 'great', 'concentration', 'mesmerizing', 'charisma', 'better', 'more', 'captivating', 'young', 'actress', 'working', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'is.Her', 'role', 'here', 'might', 'be', 'compared', 'performance', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', '1998', 'Morocco', 'find', 'enlightenment', 'Sufis', 'more', 'charming', 'film', 'outstanding', 'one', 'greater', 'range', 'skills.Notable', 'watchable', 'counterpoint', 'Winslet', 'Ruth', 'sexy', 'sleazy', 'Sophie', 'Lee', 'Yvonne', 'who', 'so', 'taken', 'P.J', 'fairly', 'begs', 'make', 'love', 'Also', 'impressive', 'Julie', 'Hamilton', 'woebegone', 'stumbling', 'mother.Of', 'course', 'would', 'say', 'see', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'are', 'fan', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'however', 'what', 'really', 'impressed', 'original', 'daring', 'conception', 'direction', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'Piano', '1993', 'film', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'best', 'direction', 'starred', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Sam', 'Neill.So', 'see', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'human', 'nature', 'raw']",Holy Smoke!

That may seem a simplistic statement, but I cannot discern a demographic pattern.  Women I thought might like their films don't and while some men do, many  don't.  Chapman/Campion films are provocative, off-beat, and pure works of  art. Think of it -- &quot;Sweetie&quot;, &quot;Angel at My Table&quot;,  &quot;The Piano&quot;, &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; and now &quot;Holy  Smoke&quot; -- what a lineup. If you didn't like their earlier films, you  probably won't like this one. Harvey Keitel, and Kate Winslet do an amazing  job of acting in this film. It could not have been easy dramatize a number  of the scenes as there are embarrassing moments for both.Winslet plays  Ruth Barron, a young Australian girl who has found religion in India. Her  alarmed parents send for a cult deprogrammer -- an older man named  P.J.Waters played by Harvey Keitel. Most of the film centers on how PJ goes  about trying to deprogram Barron.Campion has a wry sense of humor, and  much of this film is probably tongue and cheek. For example, picture Pam  Grier (PJ's partner-deprogramer) singing the &quot;Our Father&quot; at a  critical moment preceding an apparent miracle! It's probably fruitless to  try to decode Campion's films completely. Like any work of art, they speak  to different people in different ways. To me, they are inspirational. And,  I love her films because they are about women and their quest for love,  fulfillment, acceptance and salvation.Does PJ succeed in breaking Ruth  and/or restoring her by exposing the shallowness of her new-found  convictions? Does Ruth succeed in retaining her faith or does she find it?  It is said an inward spiritual change is often accompanied by an outward  sign.  This is a complex film about inward spiritual change, faith,  salvation, miracles and love. In the end both PJ and Ruth undergo a  sea-change.

I should say that the acting by most the cast is top notch.  I especially enjoyed the performance by Juie Hamilton who plays the mother.  Winslet does a great job portraying the subtle effects of being brain washed by a cult.  She (and Campion) keep the experience from being a solid, obviously negative thing and make it believable that a smart teenage girl could be sucked into such a mess.Keitel's character is increibly complexed.  A rock star ego'd de-programer from the U.S. with all the American cowboy attitude that other countries seem to expect from us.  His hair is horrible colored black with a personality like nails on a chaulkboard.  He has a few scenes in this film that are incredible, including a near touching scene with Winslet's sister-in-law who he makes easy sexual prey of.If you are looking for some rare Winslet sex scenes, this is the movie for you!  It's always surprising what actors will do if the film is artsy enough.  And once again, we see more or Keitel then we really need to.  If you're looking for something as good as The Piano, you may want to pass this up and save yourself the disappointment.  It is a movie you will remember for a while and it is thought provoking.

It was rather unexpected. The womanly, voluptuous and talanted Kate Winslet (who again does some nude scenes, as she seems to do in many films) plays a woman who travels with a friend to India and comes under the influence of some kind of a cult leader and stays in India. Her family creates a story about her father dying to convince her to return to her home in Australia. The plan works, and when she returns to Australia she finds that the family has hired a professional ""cult deprogrammer"" (Harvey Keitel) to make her come to her senses. Winslet and Keitel are both outstanding in their roles, and as their characters spend a lot of time together, you discover that Winslet has conquered this seemingly unconquerable man. He falls in love with her, and by the end of the film, he is chasing her through the desert wearing make-up, a red dress, and telling her that he wants to marry her, and they can even return to India to be with the Baba (by whom she was taken in in India)!

484258,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,6305949743,"""eurotrashgirl""","[3, 4]","In this sometimes whimsical but always entertaining film, veteran film director Jane Campion tries to do more than she actually does, ie: create a modern feminist classic, but it's ok, because she was aiming high, and the arrow lands right about on the bull's eye anyway. At least I think it does! I can't be completely sure.Holy Smoke! is a bit of an off-centered and whimsical film, mixing silly-esque comedy, drama and a pseudo-documentary style together in a way which doesn't always make sense, or even necessarily work very well.The film bears some resemblance to 1999's &quot;Hideous Kinky,&quot; which featured another knock-out performance by Winslet, and which also dealt with issues of identity and religion and the implications of being a completely &quot;free-spirited&quot; woman, ie: how in focusing solely on finding enlightenment for ourselves, we may be cutting ourselves off from the very thing that fills our lives with meaning and maturity, ie: our relationships with others.In Holy Smoke!, Winslet plays Ruth Barron, a headstrong, Australian teenager hungry for meaning in her life. While Ruth is away in India, her family learns that Ruth may have fallen prey to a religious guru. In order to suppress their fears, they hire &quot;famed American cult deprogrammer&quot; PJ Waters, played by Harvey Keitel.Once Ruth gets pulled back to Australia and meets the ultra-macho PJ,sparks fly like crazy!  Waters is being paid by Ruth's  family to &quot;deprogram&quot; her, and is thus in a position of  authority over her. But she's not a stupid girl, and by no means is she a weak one! She fights back with all her might from having her identity, and the truths which she feels she has discovered in her travels, taken from her.Isolated from the world at large and Ruth's family for three days in a shack in a remote part of the Australian outback, a battle between the two ensues. For power, for each other, for themselves. In the process, an unlikely relationship forms between them which both know can't last for long, but which is explosive in its power to change them both forever.By the end of this gender-bending shocker, PJ, (who Campion obviously wants us to see as taking on the &quot;female&quot; role, he is, after all, in a dress, and wearing lipstick,  which Ruth had put on him), has surrendered fully to Ruth,  only to be scorned. He has been seduced, raped in a sense, of his  identity, his hard metallic shell, and he lies, covered in  dust and blood, a soldier wounded in battle. He sees a mirage of Ruth, waving to him in the heat of the desert sun. Is she his savior? Or is the search for a religion/spirituality external to onesself always the giving up of one's own power? Campion seems to ask these, and other questions, but answering them proves more difficult, chimeric.As Ruth says in a postcard one year after their tryst, &quot;Something happened out there, didn't it?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; PJ responds, &quot;and in case you didn't notice, it almost killed me.&quot; And she finally says it, &quot;I don't know why, but I think I love you.&quot; Respect and love were the unlikely offspring of their tearing each other apart. They were both involved in the war, between each other, between the sexes, and they have forged a bond which can't be broken upon surviving it and coming out the other end.In the end, Ruth is shocked and disgusted at the *power* which she finds bottled up inside her, the power which she throws shamelessly at PJ in a desparate attempt at showing that she too is strong, she too is OK, she too knows &quot;the Truth.&quot; Through her journey with PJ, she realizes that his words to her, &quot;Be Kind,&quot; were all she was looking for, and how miserably she had failed in doing just that. It is in this way that she comes one step closer to being the independent, caring woman she has wanted all this time to be.By all means, this is a feminist film, and it may catch some people off guard with its extreme portrayals of vulnerability and power. However, the intensity and depth of this film is taken down a notch every now and again with bits of comic relief provided by Ruth's hilarious dysfunctional family, especially early on in the film.The voluptuous Winslet is positively luminous in this film. She lights up the screen like there's no tomorrow. Men and women alike will be transfixed.",4,"Feminism, Comedy, Sex, and Kate Winslet",970531200,"10 3, 2000",2000,4371,"['sometimes', 'whimsical', 'always', 'entertaining', 'film', 'veteran', 'film', 'director', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'tries', 'do', 'more', 'actually', 'ie', 'create', 'modern', 'feminist', 'classic', 'ok', 'was', 'aiming', 'high', 'arrow', 'right', 'bull', 'eye', 'anyway', 'least', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'sure.Holy', 'Smoke', 'bit', 'off-centered', 'whimsical', 'film', 'mixing', 'silly-esque', 'comedy', 'drama', 'pseudo-documentary', 'style', 'together', 'way', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'even', 'necessarily', 'work', 'very', 'well.The', 'film', 'resemblance', '1999', 'quot', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'quot', 'featured', 'knock-out', 'performance', 'Winslet', 'also', 'issues', 'identity', 'religion', 'implications', 'being', 'completely', 'quot', 'free-spirited', 'quot', 'woman', 'ie', 'how', 'focusing', 'solely', 'finding', 'enlightenment', 'ourselves', 'may', 'be', 'cutting', 'off', 'very', 'thing', 'lives', 'meaning', 'maturity', 'ie', 'relationships', 'others.In', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'Winslet', 'Ruth', 'Barron', 'headstrong', 'Australian', 'teenager', 'hungry', 'meaning', 'life', 'Ruth', 'away', 'India', 'family', 'Ruth', 'may', 'have', 'fallen', 'prey', 'religious', 'guru', 'order', 'suppress', 'fears', 'hire', 'quot', 'famed', 'American', 'cult', 'deprogrammer', 'quot', 'PJ', 'Waters', 'played', 'Harvey', 'Keitel.Once', 'Ruth', 'pulled', 'back', 'Australia', 'ultra-macho', 'PJ', 'fly', 'crazy', 'Waters', 'being', 'paid', 'Ruth', 'family', 'quot', 'quot', 'thus', 'position', 'authority', 'not', 'stupid', 'girl', 'means', 'weak', 'one', 'back', 'might', 'having', 'identity', 'truths', 'discovered', 'travels', 'taken', 'her.Isolated', 'world', 'large', 'Ruth', 'family', 'three', 'days', 'shack', 'remote', 'part', 'Australian', 'outback', 'battle', 'two', 'ensues', 'power', 'other', 'process', 'unlikely', 'relationship', 'forms', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'explosive', 'power', 'change', 'forever.By', 'end', 'gender-bending', 'shocker', 'PJ', 'who', 'Campion', 'obviously', 'see', 'taking', 'quot', 'female', 'quot', 'role', 'dress', 'wearing', 'lipstick', 'Ruth', 'had', 'put', 'surrendered', 'fully', 'Ruth', 'only', 'be', 'scorned', 'been', 'seduced', 'raped', 'sense', 'identity', 'hard', 'metallic', 'shell', 'covered', 'dust', 'blood', 'soldier', 'wounded', 'battle', 'mirage', 'Ruth', 'waving', 'heat', 'desert', 'sun', 'savior', 'search', 'religion/spirituality', 'external', 'onesself', 'always', 'giving', 'one', 'own', 'power', 'Campion', 'ask', 'other', 'questions', 'answering', 'more', 'difficult', 'chimeric.As', 'Ruth', 'postcard', 'one', 'year', 'tryst', 'quot', 'Something', 'happened', 'out', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'quot', 'quot', 'Yes', 'quot', 'PJ', 'quot', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'almost', 'killed', 'me.', 'quot', 'finally', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'think', 'love', 'you.', 'quot', 'Respect', 'love', 'were', 'unlikely', 'offspring', 'tearing', 'other', 'apart', 'were', 'involved', 'war', 'other', 'sexes', 'have', 'forged', 'bond', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'broken', 'surviving', 'coming', 'out', 'other', 'end', 'Ruth', 'shocked', 'disgusted', '*power*', 'bottled', 'up', 'power', 'shamelessly', 'PJ', 'desparate', 'attempt', 'showing', 'too', 'strong', 'too', 'OK', 'too', 'quot', 'Truth.', 'quot', 'journey', 'PJ', 'words', 'quot', 'Be', 'Kind', 'quot', 'were', 'was', 'looking', 'how', 'miserably', 'had', 'failed', 'doing', 'just', 'way', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'being', 'independent', 'caring', 'woman', 'wanted', 'time', 'be.By', 'means', 'feminist', 'film', 'may', 'catch', 'people', 'off', 'guard', 'extreme', 'portrayals', 'vulnerability', 'power', 'However', 'intensity', 'depth', 'film', 'taken', 'down', 'notch', 'now', 'again', 'bits', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'Ruth', 'hilarious', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'especially', 'early', 'film.The', 'voluptuous', 'Winslet', 'positively', 'luminous', 'film', 'screen', 'tomorrow', 'Men', 'women', 'alike', 'will', 'be', 'transfixed']",Holy Smoke!

484260,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305949743,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 5]","The burning question about ""Holy Smoke"" is what were Jane and Anna Campion smoking when they wrote this muddle.  Ruth (Kate Winslet) is a confused young woman who goes to India on vacation and falls in with a religious cult.  However, Ruth is not the only one who has an identity crisis.  This entire film has an identity crisis.The film starts out straightforward enough and seems to be a drama about deprogramming cult victims.  As it progresses, it veers willy-nilly into various genres using elements of farce, film noir, camp, satire and sexual perversion to name a few.  Director Jane Campion (Best Writing Oscar and nominated for Best Director for ""The Piano"") seems to think that to cook a great stew, the chef must include every food known to man.  What this produces is a jumbled mess, with a disconcerting lack of continuity and cohesion.Lost in this poorly crafted story are some interesting ironies.  The first is how critical the Christian world is of religious cults when all religions, including Christianity are cultish.  The second is how the people who are purportedly doing the saving are often more messed-up than the lost souls they profess to be rescuing.Other than the discombobulated story, Campion's direction is excellent.  She has a wonderful eye and brings numerous beautiful shots and interesting perspectives to the screen.  For instance, she shows great nuance in defining characters by their feet, with numerous close-ups of foot garb and bare feet.  This is a unique perspective, which adds something about the character we wouldn't ordinarily see in a film, but that we would notice if we were actually there.The acting is also excellent.  Harvey Keitel has made a career out of playing dark and outlandish characters, so he is the perfect choice.  His character requires someone who can be both tough and pathetic and Keitel excels at both.  Kate Winslett is something of a mystery.  After coming out of nowhere to hit the big time in ""Titanic"", she seems determined to slink back into obscurity by playing odd characters in minor films.  Her two films after ""Titanic"" were ""Hideous Kinky"" and ""Holy Smoke"", both third tier vehicles (the two films together grossed less than $4 million compared with ""Titanic"" at $600 Million in the U.S. and $1.2 Billion worldwide).  She also seems to have an indelible clause in her acting contract that requires every film to have a frontal nude scene no matter how out of shape she gets.  To say that she is Rubenesque in this film is the kindest of understatements.  Despite these peculiarities, her acting is outstanding as always.  Her character is very complex and she plays her enigmatically, where you can never be sure if she is the victim or the manipulator.  Why she doesn't hold out for roles that are more substantial is beyond me.This film has a number of good points that are diluted by an overly ambitious director who throws too much excrement against the wall.  I rated it a 5/10 on the strength of the acting and Campion's photography.  It probably would have worked as a film noir satire of deprogramming if she refrained from making the family so farcical.  This is a film that most people will either love or hate.

One day they meet with those who do not believe in reason but only in hypnosis and meditation. But do not think these manipulators are the criminals. They are just revealing that the subconscious or the unconscious can take over and become the central axle of our psyche, not because we would be losing our minds but because it IS the central axle of the human psyche.Twenty centuries of Christianity, on the western side, more generally thirty centuries of Semitic religion on the Jewish, Christian and Moslem sides have shifted our psyche from the natural central axle to re-center it onto what we call consciousness, reason and logic. We have just repressed the rest under the name of unconscious and subconscious, even the ID of Sigmund Doctor Freud. It is obvious to anyone who has some sense that all other traditions that are five or ten thousand old are more human than our short lived one (or ones) but we don't know. We have forgotten how the basic and fundamental element of our Semitic traditions, the famous Genesis is the total and systematic rejection of the previous principles to replace them with a new one, the vision of the sole God and his spirit creating everything from nothing.When we can meet with the older tradition we get berserk, mesmerized and even hypnotized and we accuse that other tradition to manipulate our minds though we have willfully castrated and destroyed the deeper side of our awareness of life. This film is nothing but the revelation of the depth of this western alienation and self-amputation and at the same time the absolute impossibility to let go with our artificial beings and enter the meditation that would make us merge with the living force of the universe and not the survival instinct of our mechanized, scientized and technologized petty umbilical enjoyment of the city ghettos in which we live. Out worse invention was Scientology that turns this artificial life and thinking of ours front side back by grafting the mental depth of Asian philosophy onto the antagonistic existentialism of psychoanalysis. Mark my word. The Chinese and the Indians right now, and some others along with them, are doing just the reverse and they will take over the world because they will still be rotating around the real axle of humanity and life, the mental force as opposed to reason and logic.We will understand that and react when it will be too late because we cannot cope with the idea that we had had it all wrong all along and that the real stuff is still alive in Asia and is coming of age after a long hibernation. That is not going to be ""Good Morning Vietnam"" but both ""Good Night Western Hemisphere"" and ""Good Morning Far East of the Rising Sun"". The film is trying to make us believe we still have a chance. It is full of beans. We don't even have one tenth of a chance. We are looking in the west for the generation of leaders who are going to bring us to that consciousness:If we are lucky the USA will choose the right man in November, not the one who knows how to win wars, but the one who believes in change, not because he is going to bring that change, but because he will have to be able to welcome the change that is coming all by itself.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Caught by the other side of the mind,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,3419,"['typical', 'neurotic', 'psychotic', 'schizophrenia', 'western', 'world', 'suddenly', 'confronted', 'other', 'side', 'conscious', 'controlling', 'tyrannical', 'psyche', 'Christian', 'mental', 'delinquent', 'One', 'day', 'meet', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'reason', 'only', 'hypnosis', 'meditation', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'manipulators', 'are', 'criminals', 'are', 'just', 'revealing', 'subconscious', 'unconscious', 'can', 'take', 'over', 'become', 'central', 'axle', 'psyche', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'losing', 'minds', 'central', 'axle', 'human', 'psyche.Twenty', 'centuries', 'Christianity', 'western', 'side', 'more', 'generally', 'thirty', 'centuries', 'Semitic', 'religion', 'Jewish', 'Christian', 'Moslem', 'sides', 'have', 'shifted', 'psyche', 'natural', 'central', 'axle', 're-center', 'what', 'call', 'consciousness', 'reason', 'logic', 'have', 'just', 'repressed', 'rest', 'name', 'unconscious', 'subconscious', 'even', 'ID', 'Sigmund', 'Doctor', 'Freud', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'sense', 'other', 'traditions', 'are', 'five', 'ten', 'thousand', 'old', 'are', 'more', 'human', 'short', 'lived', 'one', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'forgotten', 'how', 'basic', 'fundamental', 'element', 'Semitic', 'traditions', 'famous', 'Genesis', 'total', 'systematic', 'rejection', 'previous', 'principles', 'replace', 'new', 'one', 'vision', 'sole', 'God', 'spirit', 'creating', 'everything', 'can', 'meet', 'older', 'tradition', 'get', 'berserk', 'mesmerized', 'even', 'hypnotized', 'accuse', 'other', 'tradition', 'manipulate', 'minds', 'have', 'willfully', 'castrated', 'destroyed', 'deeper', 'side', 'awareness', 'life', 'film', 'nothing', 'revelation', 'depth', 'western', 'alienation', 'self-amputation', 'same', 'time', 'absolute', 'impossibility', 'let', 'go', 'artificial', 'beings', 'enter', 'meditation', 'would', 'make', 'merge', 'living', 'force', 'universe', 'not', 'survival', 'instinct', 'mechanized', 'scientized', 'technologized', 'petty', 'umbilical', 'enjoyment', 'city', 'ghettos', 'live', 'worse', 'invention', 'was', 'Scientology', 'artificial', 'life', 'thinking', 'ours', 'front', 'side', 'back', 'grafting', 'mental', 'depth', 'Asian', 'philosophy', 'antagonistic', 'existentialism', 'psychoanalysis', 'Mark', 'word', 'Chinese', 'Indians', 'right', 'now', 'others', 'are', 'doing', 'just', 'reverse', 'will', 'take', 'world', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'rotating', 'real', 'axle', 'humanity', 'life', 'mental', 'force', 'opposed', 'reason', 'logic.We', 'will', 'understand', 'react', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'can', 'not', 'cope', 'idea', 'had', 'had', 'wrong', 'along', 'real', 'stuff', 'still', 'alive', 'Asia', 'coming', 'age', 'long', 'hibernation', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Good', 'Night', 'Western', 'Hemisphere', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Far', 'East', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'believe', 'still', 'have', 'chance', 'full', 'beans', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'one', 'tenth', 'chance', 'are', 'looking', 'west', 'generation', 'leaders', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'bring', 'consciousness', 'are', 'lucky', 'USA', 'will', 'choose', 'right', 'man', 'November', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'how', 'win', 'wars', 'one', 'who', 'change', 'not', 'going', 'bring', 'change', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'welcome', 'change', 'coming', 'all', 'itself.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Holy Smoke!

In a way, it's more bizarre than surreal classics like Eraserhead, because it deals with real people and the strange things they do with and to one another.Kate Winslet plays Ruth, a callow young Australian who gets involved with a cult on a trip to India.  Her talk of reincarnation and living in light baffles her parents, who are convinced she's been  brainwashed (though Ruth's 'conversion' seems more of a whim than a rebirth).  So they hire PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel), a 'cult exiter,' to talk her down.Waters is all American swagger, dyed black hair, all-black wardrobe, snakeskin cowboy boots.  He simmers with smooth arrogance; he expects no trouble from his troubled teen charge.  He spirits her away to an isolated hut, and all heck breaks loose.Refreshingly, this isn't a movie about faith and religion.  I was  none-too-eagerly anticipating long discussions about God.  Instead, the conversation veers into sex and gender roles, exposing PJ's arrogance for the chauvinism it is, letting Ruth give him harsh lessons in female empowerment.None of this makes too much sense -- the conversations are non sequitur, events unfold contrary to one's expectations.  But it's fascinating and hilarious, so that's forgivable.  The important thing to remember is that you're watching a *comedy*; don't make the mistake of taking the proceedings more seriously than did the filmmakers.If nothing else, watch it for the cinematography.  Campion knows how to set up a shot; the whole film is infused with Australia's glowing oranges and reds.

484268,A1TZKP96PFDVFE,6305949743,"K. Carpenter ""Mettle""","[5, 8]","HOLY SMOKE was looking good for the first 30 minutes or so of the film.  I had just watched Kate Winslet in HIDEOUS KINKY the night before, so I wasn't really prepared for the comedic tone of HOLY SMOKE.  Actually, I think HOLY SMOKE would be a better film if it hadn't been treated as an off-the-wall comedy and had instead been depicted as quirky drama.So, at first, I was intrigued by the unfolding story of Ruth (Winslet) looking for a rock to cling to in India, in a cult led by the dubious guru known as Baba.  When her nervous mother showed up on the scene with asthma and fears of pestilence, I was hooked.  Then Campion ripped Ruth out of India (right when it was getting interesting) and plopped her back in Australia with her dysfunctional family and P.J. (Harvey Keitel), the cult reprogrammer.  The remainder of the film consisted of little more than Ruth and P.J. going at one another, both verbally and coitally, while Ruth's family fretted farcically in the background.At the last minute, Campion tried to imbue the story with some kind of credibility by glossing over the subject of kindness and how important it is in our emotional development, but it was too little, too late.  By then, Winslet had urinated down her own legs (what was that supposed to be about?) and Keitel was babbling and wearing an ugly dress, lipstick and cowboy boots.Sorry to have to say it, because I had greater hopes for this film, but it's really not worth watching.",1,A great lead-off spirals into unimpressive farce.,972432000,"10 25, 2000",2000,1463,"['HOLY', 'SMOKE', 'was', 'looking', 'good', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'HIDEOUS', 'KINKY', 'night', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'prepared', 'comedic', 'tone', 'HOLY', 'SMOKE', 'Actually', 'think', 'HOLY', 'SMOKE', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'treated', 'off-the-wall', 'comedy', 'had', 'instead', 'been', 'depicted', 'quirky', 'drama.So', 'first', 'was', 'intrigued', 'unfolding', 'story', 'Ruth', 'Winslet', 'looking', 'rock', 'cling', 'India', 'cult', 'led', 'dubious', 'guru', 'known', 'Baba', 'When', 'nervous', 'mother', 'showed', 'up', 'scene', 'asthma', 'fears', 'pestilence', 'was', 'hooked', 'Then', 'Campion', 'ripped', 'Ruth', 'India', 'right', 'when', 'was', 'getting', 'interesting', 'plopped', 'back', 'Australia', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'P.J', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'cult', 'reprogrammer', 'remainder', 'film', 'consisted', 'little', 'more', 'Ruth', 'P.J', 'going', 'one', 'verbally', 'coitally', 'Ruth', 'family', 'fretted', 'farcically', 'background.At', 'last', 'minute', 'Campion', 'tried', 'imbue', 'story', 'kind', 'credibility', 'glossing', 'subject', 'kindness', 'how', 'important', 'emotional', 'development', 'was', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'then', 'Winslet', 'had', 'urinated', 'down', 'own', 'legs', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Keitel', 'was', 'babbling', 'wearing', 'ugly', 'dress', 'lipstick', 'cowboy', 'boots.Sorry', 'have', 'say', 'had', 'greater', 'hopes', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'worth', 'watching']",Holy Smoke!

Bernabo,"[5, 7]","""Holy Smoke!"" did not turn out to be the movie I was given to expect based on the title and opening scenes, which was disappointing because I was rather interested in seeing the movie I thought I was going to see.  Granted, since the director of this 1999 film is Jane Campion, I should have known what the conflict was going to be, but I am almost always thinking ahead when watching a movie and this time I saw a fork in the road where they was not one to be seen.As we saw in ""The Piano,"" Campion's heroines tend to be women who have to travel to some new place to find out who they really are.  In ""Holy Smoke!"" this transformation has always taken place for Ruth Baron (Kate Winslet), who has found a spiritual awakening with a guru in India.  Despite the fact that this is communicated to us by a collage of images of richly saturated colors while Neil Diamond sings ""Holly Holy"" it appears to be a meaningful transformation, even if the guru is not even a second rate holy man.  But as far as her family back in Australia are concerned, Ruth has fallen in with a cult, and so her mother is dispatched to New Dehli to bring her daughter home with a false tale that her father is on his deathbed.  Instead she finds a deprogammer, PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel), brought in from the States at some expense to bring her back to the fold.I should have realized that Ruth's faith could not run deep, but the animosity of her family towards her new life and new beliefs is based on racism more than religion.  Consequently I was anticipating that Ruth was going to have the better of Waters, and was expecting a debate that represented the clash between East and West.  Instead, ""Holy Smoke!"" comes down to a battle of the sexes.  Ruth and her deprogrammer are sequestered in a halfway house in the Outback where Waters plans to break Ruth in three days, and their initiate discussions strongly suggest that she can give as good as she gets.  In fact, we never doubt that Ruth is smarter than Waters and her entire family put together.  He lets her walk about outside and play with rocks, which turns out to be just one of many mistakes that he makes in underestimating her.Then, suddenly, Ruth is standing there naked in the night and all discussions on the relative merits of competing belief systems is completely forgotten.  I knew that Ruth was going to turn the tables on Waters, but I did not think it would debunking his machismo.  Such a confrontation is certainly worth the having, but setting it up with the notion of deprogramming is just the wrong way to go.  You can make a comedy about deprogramming, or you can have a serious film about it, but using it as nothing more than an excuse to put these two people in a shack in the Outback seems a waste.Ironically, Ruth reveals herself to be such a strong personality that it seems odd she would give herself body and soul to anyone, let alone a guru in India.  In contrast we have to believe that Waters' partner in the deprogramming (Pam Grier) must be the key to the operation because his arguments are rather insipid and his ability to withstand either Ruth or her sister-in-law (Sophie Lee) is nonexistent.  He really does not present much of a challenge for Ruth, and the worst he looks the less impressive her achievement, and the less we think of this film.  It is only Winslet's performance that redeems this film and makes it worth the watching, but then she was why I checked it out in the first place.",3,It is the good idea for a movie that goes up in smoke here,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,3471,"['Holy', 'Smoke', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'expect', 'based', 'title', 'opening', 'scenes', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'rather', 'interested', 'seeing', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'Granted', 'director', '1999', 'film', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'what', 'conflict', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'am', 'almost', 'always', 'thinking', 'ahead', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'time', 'saw', 'fork', 'road', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'seen.As', 'saw', 'Piano', 'Campion', 'heroines', 'tend', 'be', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'travel', 'new', 'place', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'transformation', 'always', 'taken', 'place', 'Ruth', 'Baron', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'found', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'guru', 'India', 'fact', 'communicated', 'collage', 'images', 'richly', 'saturated', 'colors', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'sings', 'Holly', 'Holy', 'be', 'meaningful', 'transformation', 'even', 'guru', 'not', 'even', 'second', 'rate', 'holy', 'man', 'as', 'far', 'family', 'back', 'Australia', 'are', 'concerned', 'Ruth', 'fallen', 'cult', 'so', 'mother', 'dispatched', 'New', 'Dehli', 'bring', 'daughter', 'home', 'false', 'tale', 'father', 'deathbed', 'Instead', 'deprogammer', 'PJ', 'Waters', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'brought', 'States', 'expense', 'bring', 'back', 'fold.I', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'Ruth', 'faith', 'could', 'not', 'run', 'deep', 'animosity', 'family', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'beliefs', 'based', 'racism', 'more', 'religion', 'Consequently', 'was', 'anticipating', 'Ruth', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'better', 'Waters', 'was', 'expecting', 'debate', 'represented', 'clash', 'East', 'West', 'Instead', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'down', 'battle', 'sexes', 'Ruth', 'deprogrammer', 'are', 'sequestered', 'halfway', 'house', 'Outback', 'where', 'Waters', 'break', 'Ruth', 'three', 'days', 'initiate', 'discussions', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'can', 'give', 'as', 'good', 'fact', 'never', 'doubt', 'Ruth', 'smarter', 'Waters', 'entire', 'family', 'put', 'together', 'walk', 'outside', 'play', 'rocks', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'mistakes', 'underestimating', 'her.Then', 'suddenly', 'Ruth', 'standing', 'there', 'naked', 'night', 'discussions', 'relative', 'merits', 'competing', 'belief', 'systems', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'knew', 'Ruth', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'tables', 'Waters', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'debunking', 'machismo', 'confrontation', 'certainly', 'having', 'setting', 'up', 'notion', 'deprogramming', 'just', 'wrong', 'way', 'go', 'can', 'make', 'comedy', 'deprogramming', 'can', 'have', 'serious', 'film', 'using', 'nothing', 'more', 'excuse', 'put', 'two', 'people', 'shack', 'Outback', 'waste.Ironically', 'Ruth', 'be', 'such', 'strong', 'personality', 'odd', 'would', 'give', 'body', 'soul', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'guru', 'India', 'contrast', 'have', 'believe', 'Waters', 'partner', 'deprogramming', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'must', 'be', 'key', 'operation', 'arguments', 'are', 'rather', 'insipid', 'ability', 'withstand', 'Ruth', 'sister-in-law', 'Sophie', 'Lee', 'nonexistent', 'really', 'not', 'present', 'much', 'challenge', 'Ruth', 'worst', 'less', 'impressive', 'achievement', 'less', 'think', 'film', 'only', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'film', 'watching', 'then', 'was', 'why', 'checked', 'out', 'first', 'place']",Holy Smoke!

484271,A1NF3VPMUFHRCC,6305949743,"Literary Lass ""neocat_08840""","[10, 17]","Jane Campion, of ""The Piano"" fame, directed and co-wrote this film, which I can't neatly categorize as drama, melodrama, comedy, or horror parody. I suspect Campion may have thought she was cranking out a ""cult classic"" about cults, but the movie is too filled with nonsensical plot holes and character inconsistencies to really grab a mass audience or even a dedicated tribe of a few.I was prompted to rent the DVD after the return of Elizabeth Smart, the young teenage girl from Utah who was alleged to have been kidnapped. Upon her surprising return, there were suddenly rumors of brainwashing and cult activity. Being a child of pop culture, I instantly thought, ""Hmmm, isn't HOLY SMOKE sort of about that same thing?""The film does focus on a young, determined woman (Kate Winslet)who leaves her home and family behind to trek to India. Accompanied by a schoolmate, Winslet falls under the spell of a guru. She stays behind to practice her newly acquired faith, and her friend goes back to the Outback to alarm family and friends about Winslet's embracing of all things Asian. One instantly gets the feeling that these are people who are opposed to curry, saris, and meditation on principle.The heroine's family comes across as a ragtag lot of dopers, drinkers, adulterers, asthmatics, bigots, and Bible Belt-ers. They are a sorry group, and Campion exploits their flaws and foibles. Obviously, these are people who should not be judging anyone else's call to God, but they do, and their meddling naturally goes awry.Pooling together their meager resources, they hire a world-famous American deprogrammer. He's embodied by Harvey Keitel, and his performance is best described as fearless and intense.The relationship between ""cult buster"" and ""cult hostage"" walks a fine line between parody and paranoia. I can't believe such treatments are actually utilized--they seem to blur ethical lines and inflame Amnesty International concerns.When all is said and done, this is a movie that exasperates and confounds. It seems to be three separate films stitched together: 1) an earnest treatise on who has the right to judge anyone's religious or ethical allegiance. Aren't we all free to worship and believe as we see fit? 2)a battle of the sexes, very derivative of ""Swept Away"" or ""The Night Porter."" 3) a comedy of manners in the style of John Waters's recent efforts or Baz Luhrman's early work.It's a big, ambitious mess. If you really want to see a movie about cults and people who need rescuing, rent ""Ticket to Heaven,"" starring Nick Mancuso, Meg Foster, and Kim Cattrall. If the premise of brainwashing is what grabs you, there's nothing better than ""The Manchurian Candidate.""

I was just bewildered, because it was obvious that Jane Campion was trying to make a 'different' film. Sadly for her, she took on way too many ideas, issues and themes to address in one movie, and no matter what one might think, 'Holy Smoke' is an unmitigated disaster due to this. To say that this film has no direction is an understatement. I wouldn't say that Campion made a mistake with this movie, but I do agree that it deserved to be a critical flop.Kate Winslet as usual is excellent and radiant, and the cinematography here is spellbinding - excellent work. Also, the opening scenes in India are fab, and very well researched. The scene where Ruth's third eye opens is both comic and breathtaking, but all of this translates to nothing. Campion sets solid groundwork, and then forgets to take off. Instead, she shifts the focus from the true meaning of spiritual enlightenment, to one of the battle between the sexes, and this is boring. Harvey Keitel is insufferably horrendous as the 'exorcist'. And Ruth's entire family (I hate the way they made the entire family seem dysfunctional - a cheating father, a lunatic mother, a sex-straved sister, a gay brother - as if that was a 'deficiency', and a retarded brother) literally 'rapes' her to hand her over to therapy. This grips you in the beginning, but all of Kate's acting cannot veil the fact that her character is weakly written and confused.The VHS version of this film is strikingly close to the DVD version in terms of color transfer. The shots of the Australian outback, Indian streets, and the images of Kate Winslet as an Indian Goddess who enlightens Keitel are all beautiful and well done and look splendid on film. The thoroughly unbelievable climax though, sinks whatever hope you might have had of this film recovering and you end up pitying Campion. What were they thinking? This is no 'Hideous Kinky', and I am thankful for that. That was a classy, direct film with heart. This is an empty, yet pretty shell. Good to look at but not worth anything. I cannot believe Kate Winslet let herself be wasted in such a role.

The DVDs of ""Enigma,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""The Holiday,"" ""the Reader,"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" are on my shelves, and I know that I will be watching them all again and again for years to come.  And I know she'll gift us with many great performances in the future. (and I loved Harvey Keitel's performance in ""Pulp Fiction"" and while ""Bad Lieutenant"" was grim, it was at least interesting).But ""Holy Smoke!"" totally misses the mark.  The idea of Kate Winslet being brainwashed by a cult and then getting locked in a house for three days with a deprogrammer with issues of his own could have been such a great story...if only they had played it straight as the utterly serious and tragic subject that something like that happening would be in real life.  Instead the movie descends rapidly into weirdness and improbability.  I lost patience with the film the night that Keitel's character shows Winslet's a cheesy movie about cults.  We're asked to believe that on viewing just a few minutes of this single film, Winslet's entire faith in her religious leader is shattered.  Somehow, I think it takes a lot more to break the faith of someone caught up in the clutches of a cult.But it got even worse after that.  How worse?  Well, right after Keitel destroys her faith with a single film, she's apparently so distraught that she burns her clothing and he finds her naked outside of the remote house they're staying in.  She kisses him and tells him she doesn't feel loved.  That's not so hard to believe if we accept she'd really have a crisis of faith at that point.  Keitel's character resists her and walks away...so far so good.  But what apparently changes his mind is when --I'm not making this up-- she pisses herself.  I don't have a clue as to what that was supposed to mean since the movie was a ""serious"" project and not some piece of twisted fetish erotica (maybe it emphasized how completely vulnerable she was but blech!)  And that apparently does the trick, she and Keitel make the two-backed beast and let me say, it ain't dreamily erotic like Winslet's seduction of David Cross is in ""the Reader""...just coarse and unpleasant.  After that, it descends into even more weirdness until the deal is sealed with a wildly improbable happy ending.The only thing I can think of when I consider this movie is ""Wow, Kate Winslet really, really, REALLY wanted to avoid being typecast as a standard Hollywood star after her role in the monster-hit ""Titanic"" (a movie that I hated because of the terrible script)...and there's no movie too strange for Harvey Keitel.The movie's only redeeming features is that Kate Winslet looks lovely then as she doesn now (and curvy unlike so many anorexic ""super models"") and does a convincing Australian accent.  Oh, and the scenery in Australia where the film was shot is beautiful, but that's hardly worth subjecting yourself to this film.I can only hope that when Kate Winslet, who I adore, recalls this film, she winces and her next project will either be a worthy ""serious film"" like ""the Reader,"" a joyful romp like ""the Holiday,"" or even better something like the gem ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""",1,"Horrible, but it could have been such a great story",1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,3218,"['Kate', 'Winslet', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'DVDs', 'Enigma', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Holiday', 'Reader', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'are', 'shelves', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'years', 'come', 'know', ""'ll"", 'gift', 'many', 'great', 'performances', 'future', 'loved', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'was', 'grim', 'was', 'least', 'interesting', '.But', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'totally', 'mark', 'idea', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'being', 'brainwashed', 'cult', 'then', 'getting', 'locked', 'house', 'three', 'days', 'deprogrammer', 'issues', 'own', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'story', 'only', 'had', 'played', 'straight', 'utterly', 'serious', 'tragic', 'subject', 'something', 'happening', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'Instead', 'movie', 'rapidly', 'weirdness', 'improbability', 'lost', 'patience', 'film', 'night', 'Keitel', 'character', 'Winslet', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'cults', ""'re"", 'asked', 'believe', 'viewing', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'single', 'film', 'Winslet', 'entire', 'faith', 'religious', 'leader', 'shattered', 'Somehow', 'think', 'lot', 'more', 'break', 'faith', 'someone', 'caught', 'up', 'clutches', 'cult.But', 'got', 'even', 'worse', 'How', 'worse', 'Well', 'right', 'Keitel', 'faith', 'single', 'film', 'apparently', 'so', 'distraught', 'clothing', 'naked', 'remote', 'house', ""'re"", 'staying', ""n't"", 'feel', 'loved', 'not', 'so', 'hard', 'believe', 'accept', ""'d"", 'really', 'have', 'crisis', 'faith', 'point', 'Keitel', 'character', 'walks', 'away', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'apparently', 'mind', 'when', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'mean', 'movie', 'was', 'serious', 'project', 'not', 'piece', 'twisted', 'fetish', 'erotica', 'maybe', 'emphasized', 'how', 'completely', 'vulnerable', 'was', 'blech', 'apparently', 'trick', 'Keitel', 'make', 'two-backed', 'beast', 'let', 'say', 'ai', ""n't"", 'dreamily', 'erotic', 'Winslet', 'seduction', 'David', 'Cross', 'Reader', 'just', 'coarse', 'unpleasant', 'even', 'more', 'weirdness', 'deal', 'sealed', 'wildly', 'improbable', 'happy', 'ending.The', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'when', 'consider', 'movie', 'Wow', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'really', 'really', 'REALLY', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'being', 'typecast', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'role', 'monster-hit', 'Titanic', 'movie', 'hated', 'terrible', 'script', 'movie', 'too', 'strange', 'Harvey', 'Keitel.The', 'movie', 'only', 'redeeming', 'features', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'lovely', 'then', 'now', 'curvy', 'so', 'many', 'anorexic', 'super', 'models', 'convincing', 'Australian', 'accent', 'Oh', 'scenery', 'Australia', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'hardly', 'worth', 'subjecting', 'film.I', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'when', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'adore', 'film', 'next', 'project', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'worthy', 'serious', 'film', 'Reader', 'joyful', 'romp', 'Holiday', 'even', 'better', 'something', 'gem', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind']",Holy Smoke!

This suggests that his style ofmovie is an acquired taste. The directors have taken on manyrisks in this work, mainly in regards to its commercialpotential.The script, as a concept, has the right ingredients, the rightstructure, with many right decisions, such as that touching onthe filming locale (Australian landscapes and its desert)reinforcing its natural beauty.Here, Kate Winslet, plays Ruth, (who is no match for HarveyKeitel's acting, playing PJ Waters .) He is a self-professedexorcist to those under the mindcontrol of cultists.Although, KW's physical charisma is admirable, she seems tostruggle a bit in relaying visually a depth occasionally over the90 minutes. Overall, she delivers in terms of the role, but quiteless naturally than HK.So, this will be a difficult film to watch, and an unpleasant oneat that, by many viewers, partly  from the controversial aspectsthat are touched upon, but mainly from the mature subject mattershown.Of course, the story would not have been the same withoutpresenting those elements,  and neither would the sensationalistaspect be as effective without the extensive eye-candy, (from thesparseness of clothes that is the case  in much of the movie, bythe actresses.)At the same time, the story is paradoxical.

484282,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305949743,Roland E. Zwick,"[11, 11]","The subject of cult deprogramming has been dealt with in serious terms by any number of filmmakers, but director Jane Campion seems to be the first to approach it from a satirical perspective. The employment of such a mocking tone could easily open an artist to charges, on the one hand, of anti-religious bigotry and, on the other, of treating too lightly the real devastating consequences - for both the `victim' and their family - of a person's involvement in either the cult itself or the deprogramming that comes after. For the sheer audacity of her vision then, the Australian filmmaker - along with her co-writing sister, Anna - deserves a certain amount of acknowledgement and praise. Unfortunately, `Holy Smoke,' after a rather promising first half, falters badly, becoming, in the final analysis, mannered, unfocused and, above all, pointless in both its tone and message.The first half of the film is fitfully amusing as we are introduced to Ruth (Kate Winslet) and her colorful Aussie family, the Barrons. It seems that Ruth, on a vacation to India, has fallen under the spell of a hypnotic guru and her disapproving family has devised a scheme to haul her back and submit her to the methods and wiles of PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel), the world's most successful cult deprogrammer. So far so good as Ruth's `mum' (played by the delightful Julie Hamilton) hops aboard a plane to India to find her daughter and bring her back to Australia and, consequently, her senses. Mum's fumbling attempts to comprehend this alien, exotic culture provide the heartiest laughs in the film. Unfortunately, once Ruth and PJ are locked away in an isolated cabin in the outback for a bit of one-on-one deprogramming, the film completely loses its way, abandoning the eccentric members of Ruth's family and forcing us to observe, almost exclusively, these two far less interesting characters. For a while the film does raise a few pointed issues. We wonder, for instance, what kind of people fall prey to these brainwashing spiritual leaders; then we ask ourselves, if the alternative of returning to a presumably empty existence is really so much better. We contemplate as well whether the deprogrammer really has the answers - or is he, in addition to restricting the freedom of choice of this adult individual, himself compensating for some internal emptiness he fears to acknowledge? Sadly, such morally ambiguous themes go largely unexplored, as Ruth and PJ lock horns in an increasingly bizarre and decreasingly funny battle of wills. Soon, Ruth is wandering aimlessly around the compound stark naked (funny, usually it is Keitel who does the full frontal nudity thing in his films!) and PJ is allowing her to dress him up in women's clothing and daub his face in lipstick and makeup. As the Campion sisters lose their grasp on the themes they have so brilliantly set up, we become more and more uninterested in the story's outcome. Ruth never becomes a full-fledged character in her own right. We are given virtually no inkling of what kind of life she led before her trip to India or of what exactly led to her feeling of spiritual emptiness. PJ, predictably, violates his own professional ethics code by falling in love and sleeping with his patient, an act that has not the comic thrust to compensate for its queasy distastefulness.Thus, despite a promising beginning - and some very good performances by a gifted cast - `Holy Smoke' leaves the audience pondering the why and wherefore of its existence. If one is going to make a comedy out of such touchy material, one had best figure out a clearer destination and map out a better strategy to get there.",2,promising but pointless,970876800,"10 7, 2000",2000,3654,"['subject', 'cult', 'deprogramming', 'been', 'dealt', 'serious', 'terms', 'number', 'filmmakers', 'director', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'be', 'first', 'approach', 'satirical', 'perspective', 'employment', 'such', 'mocking', 'tone', 'could', 'easily', 'open', 'artist', 'charges', 'one', 'hand', 'anti-religious', 'bigotry', 'other', 'treating', 'too', 'lightly', 'real', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'victim', 'family', 'person', 'involvement', 'cult', 'deprogramming', 'sheer', 'audacity', 'vision', 'then', 'Australian', 'filmmaker', 'co-writing', 'sister', 'Anna', 'certain', 'amount', 'acknowledgement', 'praise', 'Unfortunately', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'rather', 'promising', 'first', 'half', 'falters', 'badly', 'becoming', 'final', 'analysis', 'mannered', 'unfocused', 'pointless', 'tone', 'message.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'fitfully', 'amusing', 'are', 'introduced', 'Ruth', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'colorful', 'Aussie', 'family', 'Barrons', 'Ruth', 'vacation', 'India', 'fallen', 'spell', 'hypnotic', 'guru', 'disapproving', 'family', 'devised', 'scheme', 'haul', 'back', 'submit', 'methods', 'wiles', 'PJ', 'Waters', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'world', 'most', 'successful', 'cult', 'deprogrammer', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Ruth', 'mum', 'played', 'delightful', 'Julie', 'Hamilton', 'plane', 'India', 'find', 'daughter', 'bring', 'back', 'Australia', 'consequently', 'senses', 'Mum', 'fumbling', 'attempts', 'comprehend', 'alien', 'exotic', 'culture', 'provide', 'heartiest', 'laughs', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'once', 'Ruth', 'PJ', 'are', 'locked', 'away', 'isolated', 'cabin', 'outback', 'bit', 'one-on-one', 'deprogramming', 'film', 'completely', 'way', 'abandoning', 'eccentric', 'members', 'Ruth', 'family', 'forcing', 'observe', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'two', 'far', 'less', 'interesting', 'characters', 'film', 'raise', 'few', 'pointed', 'issues', 'wonder', 'instance', 'what', 'kind', 'people', 'fall', 'prey', 'brainwashing', 'spiritual', 'leaders', 'then', 'ask', 'alternative', 'returning', 'presumably', 'empty', 'existence', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'contemplate', 'as', 'well', 'deprogrammer', 'really', 'answers', 'addition', 'restricting', 'freedom', 'choice', 'adult', 'individual', 'compensating', 'internal', 'emptiness', 'acknowledge', 'Sadly', 'such', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'themes', 'go', 'largely', 'unexplored', 'Ruth', 'PJ', 'lock', 'horns', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'decreasingly', 'funny', 'battle', 'wills', 'Soon', 'Ruth', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'compound', 'stark', 'naked', 'funny', 'usually', 'Keitel', 'who', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'thing', 'films', 'PJ', 'allowing', 'dress', 'up', 'women', 'clothing', 'daub', 'face', 'lipstick', 'makeup', 'Campion', 'sisters', 'lose', 'grasp', 'themes', 'have', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'set', 'up', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'uninterested', 'story', 'outcome', 'Ruth', 'never', 'full-fledged', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'are', 'given', 'virtually', 'inkling', 'what', 'kind', 'life', 'led', 'trip', 'India', 'what', 'exactly', 'led', 'feeling', 'spiritual', 'emptiness', 'PJ', 'predictably', 'own', 'professional', 'ethics', 'code', 'falling', 'love', 'sleeping', 'patient', 'act', 'not', 'comic', 'thrust', 'compensate', 'queasy', 'distastefulness.Thus', 'promising', 'beginning', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'gifted', 'cast', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'audience', 'pondering', 'why', 'wherefore', 'existence', 'one', 'going', 'make', 'comedy', 'such', 'touchy', 'material', 'one', 'had', 'best', 'figure', 'out', 'clearer', 'destination', 'map', 'out', 'better', 'strategy', 'get', 'there']",Holy Smoke!

She is one of those young, very talented and oh so beautiful actresses, who isn't afraid to risk being taken seriously by appearing nude. Keira Knightley is another terrific young lady in this category. In this film, Kate plays a wayward young woman, Ruth, who has fallen under the spell of a religious cult guru in India. Her family tricks her into returning to Australia and then hires an expert cult ""exiter"" to deprogram her. In a role very unlike his role in Campion's ""The Piano,"" Harvey Keitel looks very much in shape and turns in a decent performance as PJ, the deprogrammer. PJ is very impressive as he demonstrates to Ruth that he is very knowledgeable about her idol and his teachings. Unfortunately, the time spent on this display of his religious prowess is entirely too brief. Rather than focusing on Ruth's deprogramming and taking the time to make her transformation believable, the film begins to concentrate primarily on their relationships. To me, it would have made for a more interesting film to delve into the reasons why Ruth and PJ believe what they do. Was PJ in a cult earlier in his life? If so, what brought him out of it and drove him to become a deprogrammer? Why was Ruth initially so drawn to this guru that she packed her bags and moved to India? Is she philosophical, or is she as gullible and shallow as the film makes her appear? Instead of exploring these, the film takes the easy way out, and both Ruth and PJ change very abruptly after only a little conversation. Both are allegedly strong-willed; yet, both too easily forego their convictions. Ruth watches a video about cults while catching glimpses of PJ being fondled by her sister-in-law. Suddenly she breaks down. Are we supposed to believe it had never occurred to her she might have been drawn into a cult? She seems entirely too clever for that. Or, perhaps she has lost faith in her deprogrammer and begins to see him either as a common man or even the object of her jealousy? Neither seems likely, and I'm not certain the Campions knew either as they wrote the script. In fact, the entire movie seems as though it cannot decide what it wants to be: a comedy, drama, romance or something else. Ruth never really seems to love PJ until after he professes his love for her, and even then it is not convincing. Perhaps they are two of a kind, motivated by a search for love (or fulfillment of some sort). Who knows? The film starts out well, but becomes fairly unpersuasive by its finale.

484287,A27A3AZA7L12N6,6305949743,Stephen M. Bauer,"[5, 8]","The movie with the flip title of Holy Smoke, from the Academy award winning filmmaker Jane Campion (The Piano) has great cinematography, a good script and excellent performances by Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet  (The Titanic), but the story lacks something in its resolution.Kate Winslet plays a twenty-something who leaves her family in Australia to become a follower of a guru in India.  Her family in the outback is nuclear, and large, but they are somewhat frayed around the edges.  Kate is very emotionally intelligent, uninhibited, sensuous, sexy, beautiful and full of life and love.  (Hint: I'm in love with her!)  She went to India with a friend looking for a higher love and more meaning to life than she found with her family in the outback.  She feels and believes she has found it with her guru.Kate's family, especially her narrow and close-minded mother, is terribly disturbed about this.  To them travelling to India and following a guru are as screwed-up as one can get.  Of course, her mother thinks she's doing drugs.  Kate's mother in particular is a psychological basket case.  She is blind to the fact that her daughter is bursting with life and freer than the whole rest of the family put together.The family hires a professional cult deprogrammer, an old, very hard looking (like Charles Bronson ) and very macho Harvey Keitel to deprogram Kate.  The general deprogramming process consists in kidnapping the person for several days and assaulting their most cherished beliefs until they give them up.In going to India and following the guru, what Kate did was no different than going on a pilgrimage or retreat and having a religious conversion.  By comparison, her life would have been several orders of magnitude more controlled had she joined a convent.  One of the things Kate's family is so upset about is that she considers herself married to the guru.  (She has had no relations with him.)  This is no different than a Catholic nun who considers herself a bride of Christ, which is what all vowed nuns consider themselves.I don't believe in differentiating between cults and the so-called legitimate religions, but nothing about Kate's new lifestyle and beliefs has any of the characteristics of what we popularly associate with cults.I found the initial abduction scenes very disturbing.  To see such a free spirit being captured like an animal is emotionally wrenching.  Legally, it's kidnapping.It feels all the worse because the kidnappers think they are doing a great good and because the parents are authorizing it.  What they did is in the same moral category as murder, murdering your own child, but in this case it is murdering your child's spirit.  The process, as depicted in the film, is beyond emotionally abusive.  One feels rage at such a violent attempt to destroy a person's soul.Throughout, the persistent and indomitable Kate tries several creative means to try and escape.  Soon after Harvey Keitel has Kate sequestered, he starts have sexual relations with her.  This occupies the longest part of the film.  Harvey Keitel makes a colossal fool out of himself.  Near the end, Harvey Keitel's girlfriend, an African American career woman, shows up unexpectedly from Houston, Texas.  Her arrival and actions are not blended in to the film credibility.  When she arrives, she finds Kate nude on a coach and puts two and two together.  She appears only a little bit upset at Harvey, and intellectualizes by telling him that he could ruin the girl.The film is full of ironies and paradoxes.  The family believed Kate was under the control of the guru, but Harvey Keitel abducted her after freely returning to the outback to visit her family.  At the beginning Harvey Keitel tells Kate how he followed a guru when he was a young man and was sexually abused by him.  That is exactly what Harvey does to Kate the next day.  At the end, when Kate's mother and aunt realize that Harvey has been abusing Kate, they get so desperate, they pathetically dig an old crucifix out of a closet and try to recite the Our Father.  (This is the only indication of western religion in the film.)  Kate's mother, ever pathetic, can't remember the words.  Kate is the one who should be praying for her family not the other way around.Harvey Keitel's job was to break Kate.  In the end, it was Harvey Keitel who broke down.  I can't call it a triumphant victory.  Kate didn't break Harvey Keitel; he broke himself.  All Kate did was survive.The images of the outback, especially the deserted highways running are wonderfully.  The are different enough from anything else as to appear surreal.  I love he idea of a place where you can drive for hours without seeing another vehicle, where you can drive like a nut or on the wrong side of the road and no one will know or care.I'm not sure if I should recommend this movie or not.

Based on the cast and the strength of the film maker, I thought Holy Smoke would have a good script, strong performances and something to say.  Indeed, the film began with much promise, only to bogged down by what I would call an awful second and dreadful third act.  How the characters get from point A to point F is beyond me and certainly not motivated by what was shown on the screen.  If this movie was designed to question the roles of men and women in religious circles, question physical vs. mental domination in relationships, or question choices vs. others' perceptions of those choices, it would have been a worthwhile use of kodak film.  In the end, the film suffers from too many ideas, too little cohesion and too much self-importance.I would suggest avoiding this film, almost as much as I would avoid Gigli.",1,Truly an Ugly Movie,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,930,"[""'ve"", 'sat', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'pretentious', 'films', 'attempt', 'escape', 'Hollywood', 'drivel', 'Based', 'cast', 'strength', 'film', 'maker', 'thought', 'Holy', 'Smoke', 'would', 'have', 'good', 'script', 'strong', 'performances', 'something', 'say', 'Indeed', 'film', 'began', 'much', 'promise', 'only', 'bogged', 'down', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'awful', 'second', 'dreadful', 'third', 'act', 'How', 'characters', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'F', 'certainly', 'not', 'motivated', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'screen', 'movie', 'was', 'designed', 'question', 'roles', 'men', 'women', 'religious', 'circles', 'question', 'physical', 'vs.', 'mental', 'domination', 'relationships', 'question', 'choices', 'vs.', 'others', 'perceptions', 'choices', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worthwhile', 'use', 'kodak', 'film', 'end', 'film', 'suffers', 'too', 'many', 'ideas', 'too', 'little', 'cohesion', 'too', 'much', 'self-importance.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'avoiding', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'avoid', 'Gigli']",Holy Smoke!

The denizens of the modern world are hungry for love, and in its absence, they fill the void with unintimate sex, gurus, powertrips and consumerism.In the case of this movie, we see that both Keitel and Winslet are looking to fill this void in their own ways.  Winslet with starry-eyed guru worship; Keitel's sex addiction to younger women to distract him from the onslaught of age.  Though Keitel is by profession a de-programmer, we see that he is just as &quot;programmed&quot; as his patient.In the end though, Keitel and Winslet succeed in delivering each other from ersatz love based on &quot;mauvaise foi&quot; and find the real thing.

The plot is an attractive young woman goes to India. She joins an ashram but her parents in Australia are to lacking in sensitivity to understand the beauty of her choice. They lure her back to Australia and have Harvey Kietel try to deprogram her.  She is the stronger as she has experienced beauty.The portrayal of the parents is simply grotesque. The script one of the most leaden with dialogue that is embarrassing to listen to.
