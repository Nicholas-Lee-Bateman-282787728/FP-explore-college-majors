305058,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,6302272645,Alistair McHarg,"[39, 39]","A Soldier's Story simply has everything working for it, and the result is a frequently overlooked masterpiece that will add depth to any collection of American film.  It works as a murder mystery and it works as an astounding inside look into cultural psychology.  Certainly the themes of racism - and self-hatred - are universal.  But this snapshot of southern race relations in 1944, seen in a military context, is also very specific, and more powerful still because of this specificity.That these able-bodied men are not in Europe says a great deal, that they are baseball players from the Negro League tells us that even the national pastime was not truly national in 1944.  When Captain Davenport, played with spellbinding dignity and power by Howard Rollins, arrives to investigate the murder of a hated drill instructor, he is the first black officer most of the men have ever encountered.  Capt. Davenport's seriousness and dedication drive a wedge into the status quo, revealing layers of racism in white and black soldiers alike.One of this movie's rewards is getting to watch familiar actors just starting their ascent, Denzel Washington, Robert Townsend (Hollywood Shuffle), and David Alan Grier to name a few.  Even Philly's own chanteuse, Patti LaBelle, lends some characteristically high notes.  But the star of this film is Sergeant Waters, the murdered drill instructor, played with smoldering intensity and conviction by Adolph Caesar.  Hard to believe he did not receive an Oscar, after being nominated.In Sgt. Waters, Caesar creates a man of multi-layered psychological complexity, whose hatred of blacks is more vicious than any white man's ever could be, whose assimilation of white culture is more desperate than any white man's ever is.  Sgt. Waters believes himself to be a transformational man, a black who has put the embarrassing shuck-and-jive eye rolling behind him, a man who must kill his own blackness to be free.  In doing so, he is responsible for the death of the film's most thoroughly innocent and likable character, C.J. Memphis, played admirably by Larry Riley.By baiting Memphis, Sgt. Waters severs not only his ties to his true self, but to his humanity, in an attempt to further his crackpot philosophy.  At this point he is more than doomed, he is damned.  A Soldier's Story is not only a masterpiece of craftsmanship, it is a deeply truthful and humanistic story.  Engrossing, but more than mere entertainment - art.",5,Our Nation's Story,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2461,"['Soldier', 'Story', 'simply', 'everything', 'working', 'result', 'frequently', 'overlooked', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'add', 'depth', 'collection', 'American', 'film', 'murder', 'mystery', 'astounding', 'inside', 'look', 'cultural', 'psychology', 'Certainly', 'themes', 'racism', 'self-hatred', 'are', 'universal', 'snapshot', 'southern', 'race', 'relations', '1944', 'seen', 'military', 'context', 'also', 'very', 'specific', 'more', 'powerful', 'still', 'able-bodied', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'Europe', 'great', 'deal', 'are', 'baseball', 'players', 'Negro', 'League', 'even', 'national', 'pastime', 'was', 'not', 'truly', 'national', '1944', 'When', 'Captain', 'Davenport', 'played', 'spellbinding', 'dignity', 'power', 'Howard', 'Rollins', 'investigate', 'murder', 'hated', 'drill', 'instructor', 'first', 'black', 'officer', 'most', 'men', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'Capt', 'Davenport', 'seriousness', 'dedication', 'drive', 'wedge', 'status', 'quo', 'revealing', 'layers', 'racism', 'white', 'black', 'soldiers', 'alike.One', 'movie', 'rewards', 'getting', 'watch', 'familiar', 'actors', 'just', 'starting', 'ascent', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Robert', 'Townsend', 'Hollywood', 'Shuffle', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'name', 'few', 'Even', 'Philly', 'own', 'chanteuse', 'Patti', 'LaBelle', 'characteristically', 'high', 'notes', 'star', 'film', 'Sergeant', 'Waters', 'murdered', 'drill', 'instructor', 'played', 'smoldering', 'intensity', 'conviction', 'Adolph', 'Caesar', 'Hard', 'believe', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'being', 'nominated.In', 'Sgt', 'Waters', 'Caesar', 'man', 'multi-layered', 'psychological', 'complexity', 'hatred', 'blacks', 'more', 'vicious', 'white', 'man', 'ever', 'could', 'be', 'assimilation', 'white', 'culture', 'more', 'desperate', 'white', 'man', 'ever', 'Sgt', 'Waters', 'be', 'transformational', 'man', 'black', 'who', 'put', 'embarrassing', 'shuck-and-jive', 'eye', 'rolling', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'kill', 'own', 'blackness', 'be', 'free', 'doing', 'so', 'responsible', 'death', 'film', 'most', 'thoroughly', 'innocent', 'likable', 'character', 'C.J', 'Memphis', 'played', 'admirably', 'Larry', 'Riley.By', 'baiting', 'Memphis', 'Sgt', 'Waters', 'not', 'only', 'ties', 'true', 'self', 'humanity', 'attempt', 'further', 'crackpot', 'philosophy', 'point', 'more', 'doomed', 'damned', 'Soldier', 'Story', 'not', 'only', 'masterpiece', 'craftsmanship', 'deeply', 'truthful', 'humanistic', 'story', 'Engrossing', 'more', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'art']",N/A

I had seen Denzel Washington in &#34;Carbon Copy&#34;, David Harris in &#34;The Warriors&#34;, and Robert Townsend earlier that year in &#34;Streets of Fire&#34;, but all were still new to the scene at the time.Howard Rollins, Jr. is excellent in his role as a captain in the U.S. Army sent down by the bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. to investigate the death of Sgt. Waters,  a black sergeant, played in retrospective scenes by Adolph Caesar.  (Caesar was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to Haing S. Ngor in &#34;The Killing Fields&#34;.)  Thre prevailing view that the KKK was involved in the killing is quickly dismissed fairly early in the movie, but that still leaves a couple of white officers who encountered him the night of the killing.Most of the movie is spent with various soldiers in the platoon reminiscing about their encounters with Sgt. Waters.  The movie itself was based on a Broadway play, so that should give any of you folks out there a clue, this is not a shoot-em-up type of war movie, it's a drama.  A well-executed drama, to be sure, but a drama nonetheless.  It should be noted that Denzel Washington is not the focal point of the movie, for those of you hoping to see him prominently.

The black soldiers are segregated in a Southern camp and are chomping at the bit to get to Europe and kick some Nazi butt. These guys have a tough sergeant who wants them to be a pride to their race. He does everything he can to not be thought of as black and he doesn't want his men doing anything that will make whitey feel less of them, so he rides them, particularly the rural blacks, to get them to act white. One night he gets really drunk. On his way back to the barracks he is murdered. A black officer from D.C. is sent in to handle the investigation.This is very much like ""In the Heat of the Night"" in that both deal with murder investigations and strained race relations. Here, though, the focus deals as much with black to black relations as it does black to white relations and it's uncomfortable to watch. The sergeant is ashamed of being black. He wants to advance in the white man's world and figures to do so by acting white. He rides his men hard to do the same thing to the point his riding drives one of his men to commit suicide.This was adapted from a play and much is done to not give it a staged look. All the production values are good. The acting is very good. Adolph Caesar is great as the sergeant. Howard Rollins is good as the investigator.

Rollins, Jr., is magnetic as the Army Captain sent to investigate the murder of a black Sergeant in Louisiana during World War II; his careful detective work uncovers the complex layers of racism (both externalized and internalized) that led up to the crime.  Adolph Caesar gives a superb, Oscar-nominated performance as the (unsympathetic) victim whose story is told through a series of flashbacks.  And Larry Riley, David Alan Grier, Robert Townsend, and the always-magnificent Denzel Washington register strongly in important supporting roles.  Effective as both a mystery and a social commentary, this worthy nominee for the 1984 Best Picture Oscar is tightly directed by Norman Jewison.The DVD presentation of this recent screen classic offers an excellent film-to-video transfer, featuring a sharp picture and crisp sound.  The disc contains both the widescreen and fullscreen editions, and includes the original theatrical trailer.  Also offered is a short but very moving 1999 documentary entitled &quot;March to Freedom&quot;, which recounts several astonishing real-life stories of racism in the American armed forces during World War II.

While this film explores the issue of racism and intra-racial prejudice, it does so without being overwhelming or preachy.Howard Rollins gives a solid performance in the role of Captain Davenport; a stoic and principled officer who is assigned to solve the murder of a black NCO--Sgt. Vernon Waters--at a military base outside of Tynin, Louisiana. Davenport is determined to solve this murder and he's not going to let the white racist senior officers stand in his way. At the same time, he doesn't let the enlisted black soldiers suck-up to him because he's on a mission and he wants to get at the truth, no matter what.Adolph Caesar plays the hard-ass, irascible Sgt. Waters. Caesar plays this role for all it's worth and he does a great job of making the viewer feel his contempt for southern blacks and for himself.Robert Townsend adds a bit of comic relief to this tense drama in his role of the bumbling sycophant Coporal Ellis. For all the fawning attention he gives to Captain Davenport, you, the viewer, can understand and feel Ellis' sense of pride in working with a black officer.Denzel Washington also gives a convincing performance in the role of Private Peterson. Peterson is the angry young black man who not only resents the white racist society in which he lives but also the blacks who try to keep other black people down. This inner rage is played out in a very tense verbal exchange between Peterson and Waters which ultimately culminates in a fight between the two men.The only weakness this movie has is its reliance of the flashback throughout the film.

Indeed, there are parts of it that I sometimes still repeat in my mind, like they had become part of my internal dialogue with myself.  I enjoyed this film so much that I was almost afraid to see it again, though I knew I had to.  This time, though, I watched it with my son (11) and was both riveted by the story and delighted to answer his questions (which I am happy to say was not easy!).The time is 1944, with the segregated US Army at a base in the deep south.  A division of blacks - many of whom played in the Negro Baseball Leagues - was kept together and was the best team in the entire army.  However, the NCO in charge of the team was murdered, which a black captain (a pioneer and the first officer that many southern whites had ever seen, to their dismay) was sent to investigate.  Though there appear to be obvious answers as to who did it and humiliating barriers set up for him, he presses ahead with his work like a juggernaut.The most fascinating part was the way he peels back the many layers of the characters of the murdered NCO and a man he mercilessly persecuted.  It is a wonderful double portrait of the complexity of hate, of both racial and personal identity, of the abuse of authority, and of course of black culture near the end of the era of Jim Crow.  The language is wonderfully salty, the images vivid, and concerns of the men completely believable yet with plenty of historical context.

I usually don't watch TV because I'm annoyed by commercial interruptions. But, this film captured my interest because of how well it played out as flashbacks being put together to come to a conclusion about a murder.  This is a suspenseful story with an unexpected conclusion.Tynin, Louisiana 1944.  A black non-commissioned officer was murdered.  Shot to death on a roadside near a bridge, outside of a predominately black army base with only white officers.  A black army officer lawyer (Howard Rollins, Jr.) comes from Washington D.C. to Louisiana to investigate the murder.  No one has ever seen a black officer before and white officers only heard of the possibility that a black man could be an officer.  As you can imagine, this black officer doesn't get much support from the white officers on the base.This is a powerful film of perseverance, courage, determination, pride, and accomplishment against overwhelming odds.  And the cast is fabulous.  Howard Rollins, Jr.  Adolph Caesar, David Alan Grier, Denzel Washington, Art Evans, David Harris, Larry Riley (as C.J. Memphis), Wings Hauser, and many other stars you know you've seen before.  And it even includes Patti Labelle as Big Mary belting out some fabulous Southern Rockin' Blues.This is my very favorite film that has Denzel Washington, although ""Mississippi Masala"" is a close second.",5,Definately one of my favorite American movies.,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,1421,"['think', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'edited', 'TV', 'version', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'TV', ""'m"", 'annoyed', 'commercial', 'interruptions', 'film', 'captured', 'interest', 'how', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'flashbacks', 'being', 'put', 'together', 'come', 'conclusion', 'murder', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'unexpected', 'conclusion.Tynin', 'Louisiana', '1944', 'black', 'non-commissioned', 'officer', 'was', 'murdered', 'Shot', 'death', 'roadside', 'bridge', 'predominately', 'black', 'army', 'base', 'only', 'white', 'officers', 'black', 'army', 'officer', 'lawyer', 'Howard', 'Rollins', 'Jr.', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Louisiana', 'investigate', 'murder', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'black', 'officer', 'white', 'officers', 'only', 'heard', 'possibility', 'black', 'man', 'could', 'be', 'officer', 'can', 'imagine', 'black', 'officer', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'support', 'white', 'officers', 'base.This', 'powerful', 'film', 'perseverance', 'courage', 'determination', 'pride', 'accomplishment', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'cast', 'fabulous', 'Howard', 'Rollins', 'Jr.', 'Adolph', 'Caesar', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Art', 'Evans', 'David', 'Harris', 'Larry', 'Riley', 'C.J', 'Memphis', 'Wings', 'Hauser', 'many', 'other', 'stars', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'even', 'Patti', 'Labelle', 'Big', 'Mary', 'belting', 'out', 'fabulous', 'Southern', 'Rockin', 'Blues.This', 'very', 'favorite', 'film', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Mississippi', 'Masala', 'close', 'second']",N/A

Sergeant Waters has been shot dead and Washington DC has sent a black attorney, poorly played by Howard Rollins (the only poor part of the film), to investigate the case.  Rollins' forced and contrived portrayal made me yearn for Sidney Poitier, who would have been perfect for the role.  The plot has the attorney question the black platoon of baseball players, of which Waters had been in charge, in an effort to discoverer Waters' murderer.  Blacks were not allowed to fight side by side with whites until later on in World War II, as the film clearly depicts.Waters was a man looking to improve the quality of his black race, and part of his plan was to eliminate the uneducated southern Negro, whom he regarded as an embarrassment for black people.  Like the man with the masterplan in Germany, Waters schemes, on a much smaller level, to rid the ballplayers of their best athlete - guitar picking, story-telling, likeable, ignorant C. J.Denzel Washington plays a key role in the movie, and does it convincingly. He is an intelligent member under Waters' charge, who defies Waters' behavior and openly challenges it.The movie provides much sadness regarding the ignorance of all people whether black or white, and additional sadness regarding how some people believe they have the right to control human destiny at any cost whether it is the slaughter of ten million people or the taking of a single life.  But a glimmer of hope for the human condition is provided at the end when the white captain and black captain ride together as equals in front fo the white southern battalion, blacks incorporated,  as they prepare to go to war.This is a movie I will watch again, more than once.
