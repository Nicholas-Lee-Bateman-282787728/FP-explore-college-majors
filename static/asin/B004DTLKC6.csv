1397456,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B004DTLKC6,Andrew Raker,"[16, 16]","When I was a child, Wishbone used to be my favorite TV program. To this day, I wish there was a way to purchase all the episodes in DVD quality [Note: one can purchase nearly all the episodes now from people who have compiled the episodes and burned them onto DVDs - but it is not the same].Anyway, the four episodes on this disk are quite enjoyable and should interest young children. I still occasionally enjoy watching a Wishbone episode. Unfortunately, I have already purchased all four of the episodes on this disk when Hit Entertainment released them individually on DVD a few years ago. Therefore, I have not purchased this collection, but since I am very familiar with all four episodes, I thought I would still write this review.PAW PRINTS OF THIEVES tells a watered-down story of The Adventures of Robin Hood, in which Wishbone plays the character of Robin Hood. For the parallel story in Oakwood, Joe is faced with the dilemma of helping Ellie (the lunch lady) take food to the food bank, even though it is against Mr. Bison's (the school food director's) policy.In short, the theme of the episode is - ""Is it ever right to break bad rules for a good cause, even if it means you might get in trouble?""In THE IMPAWSIBLE DREAM, Don Quixote and his companion Sancho Panza (played by Wishbone) embark on a journey, where among other things, Don Quixote engages in fighting windmills, which he claims are disguised as giants, while searching for the golden helmet of Mambrino. Back on Oakdale, Joe Talbot tries to break the Guinness free-throw record. Of course, Joe falls short of accomplishing this nearly impossible feat, and like Don Quixote eventually realizes he does not have to do anything spectacular to earn the respect of his friends such as Samantha Kepler and David Barnes.In HUNCHDOG OF NOTRE DAME, Joe becomes jealous that Samantha has befriended Nathaniel, a boy who is having a difficult time making friends on Oakdale's hockey team since he (Nathaniel) is not a good skater. Of course, Damont, who is an excellent ice skater, is no help in boasting Nathaniel's confidence. Meanwhile, in communicating the French literary classic ""Notre Dame de Paris"", Wishbone plays Quasimodo and defends Esmerelda. Claude Frollo becomes quite angry at this.In HOT DIGGETY DOG [one of the Wishbone episodes I thought was somewhat weak], Joe and his friends, while helping Wanda plant a new tree for Earth Day, uncover a time capsule. Meanwhile, Wishbone imagines himself as Professor Liendenbrock. Wishbone and Alex (the professor's nephew) attempt to dig their way to the center of the earth while facing numerous dangers - which are communicated through very poor special effects.However, overall, in my opinion, the episodes are worth the purchasing purchase of eight dollars. They teach literature and Larry Brantley provides a very energetic voice for the dog Wishbone.",5,Favorite Childhood TV Series,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,2882,"['When', 'was', 'child', 'Wishbone', 'used', 'be', 'favorite', 'TV', 'program', 'day', 'wish', 'was', 'way', 'purchase', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'quality', '[', 'Note', 'one', 'can', 'purchase', 'nearly', 'episodes', 'now', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'compiled', 'episodes', 'burned', 'DVDs', 'not', 'same', ']', '.Anyway', 'four', 'episodes', 'disk', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'should', 'interest', 'young', 'children', 'still', 'occasionally', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Wishbone', 'episode', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'already', 'purchased', 'four', 'episodes', 'disk', 'when', 'Hit', 'Entertainment', 'released', 'individually', 'DVD', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Therefore', 'have', 'not', 'purchased', 'collection', 'am', 'very', 'familiar', 'four', 'episodes', 'thought', 'would', 'still', 'write', 'review.PAW', 'PRINTS', 'OF', 'THIEVES', 'watered-down', 'story', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Wishbone', 'character', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'parallel', 'story', 'Oakwood', 'Joe', 'faced', 'dilemma', 'helping', 'Ellie', 'lunch', 'lady', 'take', 'food', 'food', 'bank', 'even', 'Mr.', 'Bison', 'school', 'food', 'director', 'policy.In', 'short', 'theme', 'episode', 'ever', 'right', 'break', 'bad', 'rules', 'good', 'cause', 'even', 'might', 'get', 'trouble', 'IMPAWSIBLE', 'DREAM', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'companion', 'Sancho', 'Panza', 'played', 'Wishbone', 'embark', 'journey', 'where', 'other', 'things', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'fighting', 'windmills', 'are', 'disguised', 'giants', 'searching', 'golden', 'helmet', 'Mambrino', 'Back', 'Oakdale', 'Joe', 'Talbot', 'break', 'Guinness', 'free-throw', 'record', 'course', 'Joe', 'short', 'accomplishing', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'feat', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'eventually', 'not', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'spectacular', 'earn', 'respect', 'friends', 'such', 'Samantha', 'Kepler', 'David', 'Barnes.In', 'HUNCHDOG', 'OF', 'NOTRE', 'DAME', 'Joe', 'jealous', 'Samantha', 'befriended', 'Nathaniel', 'boy', 'who', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'making', 'friends', 'Oakdale', 'hockey', 'team', 'Nathaniel', 'not', 'good', 'skater', 'course', 'Damont', 'who', 'excellent', 'ice', 'skater', 'help', 'boasting', 'Nathaniel', 'confidence', 'Meanwhile', 'communicating', 'French', 'literary', 'classic', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'de', 'Paris', 'Wishbone', 'Quasimodo', 'Esmerelda', 'Claude', 'Frollo', 'quite', 'angry', 'this.In', 'HOT', 'DIGGETY', 'DOG', '[', 'one', 'Wishbone', 'thought', 'was', 'somewhat', 'weak', ']', 'Joe', 'friends', 'helping', 'Wanda', 'plant', 'new', 'tree', 'Earth', 'Day', 'time', 'capsule', 'Meanwhile', 'Wishbone', 'Professor', 'Liendenbrock', 'Wishbone', 'Alex', 'professor', 'nephew', 'attempt', 'dig', 'way', 'center', 'earth', 'facing', 'numerous', 'dangers', 'are', 'communicated', 'very', 'poor', 'special', 'effects.However', 'overall', 'opinion', 'episodes', 'are', 'purchasing', 'purchase', 'eight', 'dollars', 'teach', 'literature', 'Larry', 'Brantley', 'very', 'energetic', 'voice', 'dog', 'Wishbone']",N/A

1397463,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B004DTLKC6,Kathy-W,"[1, 1]","What can I say that hasn't already been said about this show? I grew up watching it and I haven't found an equal to it since then. The production values are excellent and many details are surprisingly attentive (the music, the costumes, etc.). While there isn't always a totally happy ending, there IS always something important for children to take away from it (both in the literature sequences and the ""real life"" ones). These points range from defining true friendship to the pitfalls of liars/phonies to bullying and random acts of kindness. The admirable thing about inserting such values is that many of them are subtle as well as effective since they equated some of them with classic literary examples (a feat that basically hadn't been attempted before OR after this show). This show is responsible for my interest in reading AND writing...not because it conditioned viewers into reading ""boring old books"" but by pointing out just how much STORY was in some stories. This show made things exciting without being completely goofy and hokey.While this show does mention death when applicable to classic literature, it is done very tastefully (absolutely no blood and guts to frighten the little ones!). The age range is actually hard to gauge for this show - the stories made sense to me at 7 years old, but observant children who are even younger might still have fun with it. Who doesn't like a spunky talking dog?As others have said, I dearly wish that more episodes were available. The 4 included in this release are the same 4 you can buy separately. If money is no object to you, there are 20 or so different VHS tapes you can find (with one episode each), but this will take some digging (and money!) if you want brand new specimens. Those of you who were clever enough to tape all 50-odd episodes when this show was still airing should cherish those tapes as long as possible. I've been told that the copyright owners of this show have left the possibility open to release more episodes on DVD *if* enough interest is generated in this 4-episode release.

The delightful television series featuring the adorable Jack Russell terrier is one that brings back so many memories.  I used to hurry to my dorm room and watch this show at every opportunity.  Wishbone's wittisms appeal to adults and children alike, and the adventures of Joe Talbot and his two friends, David and Samantha, serve as excellent modern examples of the classic stories being told.All the episodes on this DVD are great.  My favorites are:1.  ""Hunchdog of Notre Dame"": During a game of hockey, an awkward boy named Nathaniel is picked last.  He is constantly being mocked by the other kids.  Only Samantha takes an interest in him.  Wishbone portrays the hunchback, Quasimotto, an outcast bellringer in Paris's cathedral.  ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" by Victor Hugo.2.  ""Pawprints of Thieves"": This story is my favorite.  Joe helps a cafeteria worker take food to the food bank, even though this action is against school policy.  Wishbone portrays the legendary Robin Hood, who, along with his band of merry men, take from the rich to give to the poor.  During their quest, they are pursued by the ruthless and cunning sheriff of Nottingham.  Superb acting makes this episode one to cherish.The other episodes are equally good especially ""Impawsaible Dream.""I hope that other episodes in this series are released.  It's a wonderful tool that stimulates imagination, and Wishbone's antics need to be preserved.  Happy viewing and God bless you all.(Please look for my fantasy novel, Crimilia, which is available on this site.
