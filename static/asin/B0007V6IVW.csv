The 3-Disc set only includes 13 episodes of AC show, meaning by this that it's not the complete second season. Although it includes the original aired sequence of the episodes, which is good, the ""OCC Holiday Special (Santa Bike)"" is not included. Also contains as the last episode the Mikey Special which belongs to season one. As a DVD description, it has nice intros, episodes selection and special features. Unfortunately for people interesting in other languages, it does NOT include any subtitles (spanish,french,...), but it includes closed captions.",4,Another 13 American Chopper Episodes,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,609,"['when', 'episodes', 'list', 'get', 'messy', '3-Disc', 'set', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'AC', 'show', 'meaning', 'not', 'complete', 'second', 'season', 'original', 'aired', 'sequence', 'episodes', 'good', 'OCC', 'Holiday', 'Special', 'Santa', 'Bike', 'not', 'included', 'Also', 'last', 'episode', 'Mikey', 'Special', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'description', 'nice', 'intros', 'episodes', 'selection', 'special', 'features', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'interesting', 'other', 'languages', 'NOT', 'include', 'subtitles', 'spanish', 'french', 'closed', 'captions']",American Chopper The Series - Second Season
891665,A2HBJQT0H22MU0,B0007V6IVW,"Glenn Martin ""Never Read a Book Just Once""","[27, 27]","This set is the second season of American Chopper.  I am pleased to say I don't think there was as many screaming matches in this series as there was in the first.  Although they still do have a couple of doosies and in one episode you have to wonder why Vinnie doesn't quit in disgust!  There did feel like there was a couple of ""filler"" episodes with this series, in particular the Football Bike and Mikey Special.  The Mikey Special was just a wrap-up of what we have already seen in the last two seasons so I felt it was a waste of space.  Regardless of that, still enjoyed the second series immensely and am hanging to buy the third!Disc One:Tool Bike (Snap On tools bike, very very cool seeing the Snap On factory)Tool Bike 2Football BikePOW/MIA BikeDisc Two:POW/MIA Bike 2POW/MIA Bike 3Miller Welder BikeMiller Welder Bike 2Disc Three:Celebrity Bike (awesome bike for Jay Leno!)Celebrity Bike 2Liberty Bike (not as good as I thought it would be...)Liberty Bike 2Mikey Special",4,Another Great Season,1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,982,"['set', 'second', 'season', 'American', 'Chopper', 'am', 'pleased', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'there', 'was', 'many', 'screaming', 'matches', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'still', 'do', 'have', 'couple', 'doosies', 'one', 'episode', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'Vinnie', ""n't"", 'quit', 'disgust', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'couple', 'filler', 'series', 'particular', 'Football', 'Bike', 'Mikey', 'Special', 'Mikey', 'Special', 'was', 'just', 'wrap-up', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'felt', 'was', 'waste', 'space', 'Regardless', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'series', 'immensely', 'am', 'hanging', 'buy', 'third', 'Disc', 'One', 'Tool', 'Bike', 'Snap', 'tools', 'bike', 'very', 'very', 'cool', 'seeing', 'Snap', 'factory', 'Tool', 'Bike', '2Football', 'BikePOW/MIA', 'BikeDisc', 'Two', 'POW/MIA', '2POW/MIA', '3Miller', 'Welder', 'BikeMiller', 'Welder', 'Bike', '2Disc', 'Three', 'Celebrity', 'Bike', 'awesome', 'bike', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Celebrity', 'Bike', '2Liberty', 'Bike', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Liberty', 'Bike', '2Mikey', 'Special']",American Chopper The Series - Second Season
891666,A379UEHO1247ME,B0007V6IVW,"GRIZZLY ""Grizzly""","[5, 69]","Speaking on the authority of a REAL Biker who has LIVED the Lifestyle for over 35 of my almost 53 years, during which I have ridden the same '63 Harley Panhead, (which I built and rebuilt from the ground up with my own two hands), longer than the Turtle Kids have been alive, My Brothers and I all find Orange County Chumps to be some of the Funniest Comedy on DVD! Their Ol'Man is one of the greatest comedians to try and call himself a ""biker""; seemingly, the only thing that HE works at is running his MOUTH! What little I have been able to watch of this show without developing acute nausea, I have NEVER seen Turtle, Sr. EVER pick up a tool or lend a hand to help anyone at ANYTHING.The bikes built by OCC may have some eye appeal, but are otherwise a waste of parts & labor, as they are totally unridable; you would need an entire parking lot to turn one of them around, and the spider bike in particular, with its ridiculous rear fender, would give you a radical shower if one attempted to ride it on wet pavement, much less in the rain!(And I would LOVE to know what company sells them INSURANCE!)My Brothers and I have long debated which is more hilarious, the Turtles, with their hour long screaming matches, or the sidewalk commandos who give the mighty OCC free advertising, running around with T-shirts & other gear, none of whom OWN, or probably even KNOW HOW to ride a MOTORCYCLE! Only Hang-arounds and Wannabees worship these comedians; REAL Bikers only LAUGH at them! The only reason this gets two stars is for the comedy element!As far as other reviewers who are so critical of my well earned opinion are concerned, just read their other reviews (if they have any)!At least Jesse James RIDES his creations to shows! The Turtles TRAILER Theirs (and then have to FLY IN their mechanics when one of their monstrosities breaks down!) JESSE may be terminally commercial, but at least he's HONEST!",2,WANNABEE WORSHIP Pt.
