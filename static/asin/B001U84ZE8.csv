I bought this series in order to brush up on it because it's been quite a while since I've done any painting.  It's fun, easy and you'd be surprised at what you can do with a little practice.

Each 1 hour episode was intriguing, and seemed so simplistic in the methods and art of painting.  Since I am just learning a new hobby, I thought, ""What better way to learn to paint?"".  I was not wrong.  These instructional DVD's show you lots of tips and tricks to learning how to master the art of painting.Highly recommend this series of DVD's as well as any other Bob Ross set you can get your hands on.",5,Bob Ross Joy of Painting DVD Series,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,476,"['remember', 'growing', 'up', 'being', 'fascinated', 'watching', 'Bob', 'Ross', 'paint', '1', 'hour', 'episode', 'was', 'intriguing', 'seemed', 'so', 'simplistic', 'methods', 'art', 'painting', 'am', 'just', 'learning', 'new', 'hobby', 'thought', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'learn', 'paint', 'was', 'not', 'wrong', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'show', 'lots', 'tips', 'tricks', 'learning', 'how', 'master', 'art', 'painting.Highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'Bob', 'Ross', 'set', 'can', 'get', 'hands']",N/A
1238521,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B001U84ZE8,Michael Valdivielso,"[2, 2]","Nine one hour episodes, created as instructional painting guides, with a half-hour episode from the Joy of Painting series.  Wonderfully detailed and complete, its price tag may seem a tad high.  But please note educational material is always going to cost twice or more than material for entertainment.  For the price I could have gotten three brand new 25 episode anime sets.  Or four used ones.  Or six short, semi-new, 13 episode, anime sets.  Or 10 happy meals.  And the price will likely only go up.But it is a must for those of you who wish to learn how to paint or are fans of the great, late Bob Ross.  Each episode is a self-contained class, in which he explains what materials are needed, how to set up your work space, tools, use of the brushes and how to set up the canvas.  THEN he gets into color, light, shape, background, and so-on.  He is a wonderful teacher as long as his calm voice does not put you to sleep.A star was removed only for the price which, as I said, is pretty high.
