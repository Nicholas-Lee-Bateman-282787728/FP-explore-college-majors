292134,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,6302035139,Brooser Bear,"[14, 20]","This film is inconsistent in many ways. Set up as a forbidden love story between two teen agers bitterly opposed by the father of the girl, the film stops making sense that you realize that the girl's family is supposed to be a bunch of progressive ex-hippies who encourage their children to experiment and hold wildest parties on the block. Why hate the kid when he is trying so desperately to become part of the clan? The enemy number two is the girl's brother, who happens to be this guy's best friend who introduced him to his sister in the first place!Beyond that the film starts falling apart. Father forbids them to see each other for a month because of the girl's failing grades, and the kid goes bonkers and sets the house on fire. The obvious question is, why aren't they talking in school, and what sort of friendship is it that can't survive a thirty day separation? Unless the guy is obssessed with the girl and the girl is not interested.Whatever merits the original novel had got lost in this screen adaptation. No reason for the attraction is given, nor does the film show any relationship between the two beyond sexual attraction. The girl's folks are not at all recognizable as former hippies, but you can definitely see traces of old world aristocracy in them, with the duck hunting and with pretensions to preppiness and upper classdom, why then did they introduce the kid to the girl in the first place, by a jealous brother no less???Finally, the film disgisted me because the guy is clearly a stalker and the girl is objectified, and the whole affair is shown as GREAT LOVE! On a couple of occasions the guy forces himself on the unwilling girl and they explode into passionate lovemaking. In the final analysis the message in the film validates every stalker in that the object of their obssession will yield to them in the end if only they get through to her against all odds and against all reason.

292143,AX41R9BU1FPF3,6302035139,"Joseph J. Brigante ""Joseph Brigante""","[0, 0]","This is by far the most neglected film of 1981 and it also is the most unappreciated film of 1980s.This is Franco Zeffirelli's analogy to his own film in 1968, Romeo and Juliet.  Now many people would not want to agree with this, but that's what it is.  There are a some scenes to prove it. Here they are:1) When at the first party at Jade's (Brooke Shields) house, we here a cover version of Lionel Ritchie's Endless Love sung by a female.  As this song is going on, we see our main characters, Jade and David (Martin Hewitt) looking at each other with the camera eventually making them connect.  In these case , we see Jade leaving her father and going to embrace David.  It is in the same realm of Juliet (Olivia Hussey) and Romeo (Leonard Whiting) at the party where he is masked.  During the scene, we can see there romantic connection just like another beautiful theme song also plays.  At that time the music is from Nino Rota.2)  Jade's father Hugh (Don Murray) is ultimately distraught when he realized his daughter Jade is being intimate with David.  A problem he has is that  David, is low-middle class from a socialist family, while he is wealthy liberal doctor.  In this modern sense, Jade is a Capulet and David is a Montague.The interesting thing about the father is that he is the ultimate hypocrite.  He has parties at his house where many of the guests do drugs.  He claims he believes in free expression and being yourself.  Well he can't handle it when he knows his daughter of 15 years old is having sex with a 17 year old. (Sounds familiar of the actors in Romeo and Juliet, Hussey 15 and Whiting 17)David is not allowed to see Jade for 30 days with reservation after the time claimed.  If you really love someone, that is close to death.  So the father's mean spirited attitude and seeing the truth shows his prejudice of breaking the two up.A major difference in Endless Love's conclusion to director Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet is that the final is more disturbing.  That what really can hurt the viewer.  I will not give the specific ending away, but that is the truth.  And don't think that audiences that saw the film then (1981 in theaters and on VHS in the 1980s) didn't loath this.  Yet, you have to give credit for showing something realistic then a bubble gum ending.  Most romantic films that have come out in the 1990s till today always have a happy sugar coated ending that satisfies the audience.  This movie shows that with the stereotypical myth of the rich girl and the poor boy, there can be a different turn of events.To also let you know, the US region 1 DVD  in totally blank of extras.  It's widescreen and you have the options of languages and subtitles.  We don't have to be magicians to figure out how any company was going to treat this film on DVD when it was released.  I even figured they wouldn't even have the theatrical trailer, and I was right.  But I still wanted to buy it as this film will always be a part of my life.P.S.  One of the most stand out scenes that is never mentioned is when David is looking at Jade get on the elevator to see her mother.  The simple look of Brooke Shields is so breathtaking, that it is a moment in history.  And that is the truth.Thanks for reading, Joseph",3,"A 5 star film, but 2 stars for the US DVD",1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,3250,"['far', 'most', 'neglected', 'film', '1981', 'also', 'most', 'unappreciated', 'film', '1980s.This', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'analogy', 'own', 'film', '1968', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Now', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'agree', 'what', 'are', 'scenes', 'prove', 'Here', 'are:1', 'When', 'first', 'party', 'Jade', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'house', 'here', 'cover', 'version', 'Lionel', 'Ritchie', 'Endless', 'Love', 'sung', 'female', 'song', 'going', 'see', 'main', 'characters', 'Jade', 'David', 'Martin', 'Hewitt', 'looking', 'other', 'camera', 'eventually', 'making', 'connect', 'case', 'see', 'Jade', 'leaving', 'father', 'going', 'embrace', 'David', 'same', 'realm', 'Juliet', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'Romeo', 'Leonard', 'Whiting', 'party', 'where', 'masked', 'scene', 'can', 'see', 'there', 'romantic', 'connection', 'just', 'beautiful', 'theme', 'song', 'also', 'time', 'music', 'Nino', 'Rota.2', 'Jade', 'father', 'Hugh', 'Don', 'Murray', 'ultimately', 'distraught', 'when', 'realized', 'daughter', 'Jade', 'being', 'intimate', 'David', 'problem', 'David', 'low-middle', 'class', 'socialist', 'family', 'wealthy', 'liberal', 'doctor', 'modern', 'sense', 'Jade', 'Capulet', 'David', 'Montague.The', 'interesting', 'thing', 'father', 'ultimate', 'hypocrite', 'parties', 'house', 'where', 'many', 'guests', 'do', 'drugs', 'free', 'expression', 'being', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'when', 'daughter', '15', 'years', 'old', 'having', 'sex', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Sounds', 'familiar', 'actors', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Hussey', '15', 'Whiting', '17', 'David', 'not', 'allowed', 'see', 'Jade', '30', 'days', 'reservation', 'time', 'claimed', 'really', 'love', 'someone', 'close', 'death', 'father', 'mean', 'spirited', 'attitude', 'seeing', 'truth', 'prejudice', 'breaking', 'two', 'up.A', 'major', 'difference', 'Endless', 'Love', 'conclusion', 'director', 'Zeffirelli', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'final', 'more', 'disturbing', 'what', 'really', 'can', 'hurt', 'viewer', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'specific', 'ending', 'away', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'audiences', 'saw', 'film', 'then', '1981', 'theaters', 'VHS', '1980s', 'did', ""n't"", 'loath', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'showing', 'something', 'realistic', 'then', 'bubble', 'gum', 'ending', 'Most', 'romantic', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', '1990s', 'till', 'today', 'always', 'have', 'happy', 'sugar', 'coated', 'ending', 'audience', 'movie', 'stereotypical', 'myth', 'rich', 'girl', 'poor', 'boy', 'can', 'be', 'different', 'turn', 'events.To', 'also', 'let', 'know', 'US', 'region', '1', 'DVD', 'totally', 'blank', 'extras', 'widescreen', 'have', 'options', 'languages', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'magicians', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'company', 'was', 'going', 'treat', 'film', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'even', 'figured', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'was', 'right', 'still', 'wanted', 'buy', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'part', 'life.P.S', 'One', 'most', 'stand', 'out', 'scenes', 'never', 'mentioned', 'when', 'David', 'looking', 'Jade', 'get', 'elevator', 'see', 'mother', 'simple', 'look', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'so', 'breathtaking', 'moment', 'history', 'truth.Thanks', 'reading', 'Joseph']",N/A

Perhaps the passage of time makes the film seem shallow and morbid in its sappiness but what comes out on the screen is two love-crazed teenagers driven to distraction. A 15-year-old girl is best off forging a solid core identity and not having emotional turbulence that young  romantic love provokes. A 17-year-old boy about to graduate high school should be looking towards his future. The parents are as much to blame in the story line for their lack of guidance and misunderstanding about the overwhelming feelings teenage hormones have on adolescent minds.If you like sappy romance without the strength of acting, dialogue, and a decent story.... Endless Love is your tale. Otherwise ... just get over it. There are better told tales of the heart out there.Suggestions: Cinema Paradiso, Under the Tuscan Sun, The Truth about Cats and Dogs, and even that 1997 international blitzkrieg Titanic.",1,Endless Therapy perhaps????,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,1169,"['have', 'be', 'kidding', 'Maybe', 'endless', 'therapy', 'more', 'telling', 'title', 'book', 'was', 'international', 'bestseller', 'movie', 'only', 'shadow', 'what', 'Scott', 'Spencer', 'wrote', 'Endless', 'Love', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'Love', 'Story', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'Perhaps', 'passage', 'time', 'film', 'seem', 'shallow', 'morbid', 'sappiness', 'what', 'out', 'screen', 'two', 'love-crazed', 'teenagers', 'driven', 'distraction', '15-year-old', 'girl', 'best', 'forging', 'solid', 'core', 'identity', 'not', 'having', 'emotional', 'turbulence', 'young', 'romantic', 'love', 'provokes', '17-year-old', 'boy', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'should', 'be', 'looking', 'future', 'parents', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'blame', 'story', 'line', 'lack', 'guidance', 'misunderstanding', 'overwhelming', 'feelings', 'teenage', 'hormones', 'have', 'adolescent', 'minds.If', 'sappy', 'romance', 'strength', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'decent', 'story', 'Endless', 'Love', 'tale', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'get', 'are', 'better', 'told', 'tales', 'heart', 'out', 'there.Suggestions', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'Truth', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'even', '1997', 'international', 'blitzkrieg', 'Titanic']",N/A

I've always been so fond of the memorable scene at the end with Ann (Shirley Knight)and Jade (Brooke Shields)walking in the snow. I love the way that scene transitions to the final shot with Jade walking across the street (with the title score playing in the background). I'm also fond of the casting in this movie; I think Shirley Knight especially shines in her role as Jade's free-loving mother. Handsome Don Murray never looked sexier in his role as Jade's dad, but I think Zeffirelli fails to get a fully believable performance out of him and James Spader, cast as Jade's brother. Some of the hostility in the scenes between the Murray, Spader and Hewitt characters seem contrived and over-the-top. (And speaking of contrived, how did that little fire of the porch end up burning down the whole house? At the point where the characters are screaming and running out of the house, the fire could have been easily contained with a few buckets of water.) Hewitt, though, is impressive in his first role as David. I'm very surprised that Hewitt didn't capture more starring roles after this box office success. Shields, still a blossoming actress here, isn't always convincing in her role as Jade, but she still has her moments and her striking beauty leaves a lingering impression. And to the credit of Hewitt and Shields, the chemistry between David and Jade is very believable.

292156,A5QE86H97FDJA,6302035139,Mynameisthis,"[3, 5]","Writing about this film brings back a flood of memories because when I first saw it, it was in the theater and I saw it with some friends and a girl who I refer to as my &quot;endless love&quot;. Nowadays, it's popular to refer to such a person as a soul-mate but for me and in that time in my life, she was my endless love and to this day, over 20 years later, I'm still in love with her.This film has to be seen through that light. It has to be viewed through the eyes of what you remember most about that one person who you would have done anything for, perhaps even things that would have taken you beyond the boundaries of sanity and legality.The film itself wasn't a great production and it's difficult to squeeze a book the size of the original novel into a film only that long but at the same time, it was a stroke of genius. While there have been teen films that explored love on a superficial level, I can't think of any films that looked at love from the perspective of such a powerful obsessive desire.Speaking for myself, there was a time when I would have done anything to convince this one girl that being with me was a fundamental truth and I would have given my life for her. Looking back of course, you mature, you become more self-involved, you think more so of your needs and what you want to get through life. But there was a time when I looked at life through the eyes of love and sacrifice. At that time, it seemed more like you were living in a Disney film and the happy ending was right around the corner.&quot;Endless love&quot; is the story of just such an obsession. Forgetting about some of the plot points and angles and silliness of the production, if you can just put yourself into that time of your life when obsession dominated your thinking and then feel your way through the film as to what the main character, David, was feeling as he lost his true love and then started losing his hold on his sanity.

292157,A2X25C107CSLOR,6302035139,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[12, 17]","Although much maligned, this movie isn't that bad. At least I was able to sit all the way through it, which I can't say for a lot of more heralded titles. Based on Scott Spencer's novel about teenage love, as Pauline Kael has observed it's like the male version of  Splendor in the Grass. In Splendor Natalie Wood was so nuts about Warren Beatty that she was packed off to a loony bin. Here Martin Hewett is just as obsessive about Brooke Shields, and he's the one who ends up institutionalised. Director Franco Zeffirelli is more interested in presenting the teenagers as modern day Romeo and Juliet and he pulls back on the sex that was rampant in the book. Hewitt and Shields still have sex but it's staged so unerotically that the fact that Shields needs sleeping pills becomes a joke. It can't be that her recreation makes her too hyped to sleep, and considering how often they are seen to engage in activity, it's a wonder she can stay awake at all. Zefferilli probably equals Spencer's purple-ness in a climactic brawl, and with the hysterical performances of Don Murray as Shield's father and Beatrice Straight at Hewitt's mother. As Hewitt's father, Richard Kiley is quietly assuming, and as Shield's mother Shirley Knight is warm and tender, this being one of her last films before she began to gain weight. The &quot;liberal&quot; household that Knight and Murray share, which is meant to be a catalyst for the love that the teenagers are just &quot;too young to handle&quot;,  also has odd indications of incest, and this prepares us for a later scene where Knight makes a pass at Hewitt. That Hewitt is using Knight to get to her daughter still doesn't seem to shift the shame of an older woman/younger man seduction off Knight, and the fact that he had been sleeping with her daughter makes things even more queazy. Thankfully Knight manages to retain her dignity, but the point that she is still an attractive woman seems beside the point of Hewitt's rejection. When Hewitt is banned from visiting Shields at her home, we wonder why that means he cannot speak to her at school. And when Shields' family have a party, we also wonder why Hewitt is not invited. From the glimpses we get of Shields at the party, she hardly seems pining for her &quot;endless love&quot; partner, so we are apt to believe the information Hewitt has overheard  - that the couple have broken up, and the implication being that Shields is again a free agent. These mixed messages culminate in Hewitt confronting Shields and nearly raping her to make her admit she still loves him. Hewitt is required to act more than Shields, since his character has more at stake than hers in the narrative, and though he falls back on boyish head-lowering and makeup provides him with a masculinising stubble, he is convicing when he cries in the rain. Shields however is used like a model. Cinematographer David Watkin captures her at what may be the height of her beauty, a standard Shields has been unable to rise above in her adult years. This film also features James Spader in one of his early snooty roles as Shields' brother, and a beefy Tom Cruise in one scene.",3,the love every parent fears,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,3145,"['much', 'maligned', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'least', 'was', 'able', 'sit', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'lot', 'more', 'heralded', 'titles', 'Based', 'Scott', 'Spencer', 'novel', 'teenage', 'love', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'observed', 'male', 'version', 'Splendor', 'Grass', 'Splendor', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'was', 'so', 'nuts', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'was', 'packed', 'off', 'loony', 'bin', 'Here', 'Martin', 'Hewett', 'just', 'as', 'obsessive', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'institutionalised', 'Director', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'more', 'interested', 'presenting', 'teenagers', 'modern', 'day', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'back', 'sex', 'was', 'rampant', 'book', 'Hewitt', 'Shields', 'still', 'have', 'sex', 'staged', 'so', 'unerotically', 'fact', 'Shields', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'joke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'recreation', 'too', 'hyped', 'sleep', 'considering', 'how', 'often', 'are', 'seen', 'engage', 'activity', 'wonder', 'can', 'stay', 'awake', 'Zefferilli', 'probably', 'Spencer', 'purple-ness', 'climactic', 'brawl', 'hysterical', 'performances', 'Don', 'Murray', 'Shield', 'father', 'Beatrice', 'Straight', 'Hewitt', 'mother', 'Hewitt', 'father', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'quietly', 'assuming', 'Shield', 'mother', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'warm', 'tender', 'being', 'one', 'last', 'films', 'began', 'gain', 'weight', 'quot', 'liberal', 'quot', 'household', 'Knight', 'Murray', 'share', 'meant', 'be', 'catalyst', 'love', 'teenagers', 'are', 'just', 'quot', 'too', 'young', 'handle', 'quot', 'also', 'odd', 'indications', 'incest', 'later', 'scene', 'where', 'Knight', 'pass', 'Hewitt', 'Hewitt', 'using', 'Knight', 'get', 'daughter', 'still', ""n't"", 'seem', 'shift', 'shame', 'older', 'woman/younger', 'man', 'seduction', 'Knight', 'fact', 'had', 'been', 'sleeping', 'daughter', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'queazy', 'Thankfully', 'Knight', 'retain', 'dignity', 'point', 'still', 'attractive', 'woman', 'point', 'Hewitt', 'rejection', 'When', 'Hewitt', 'banned', 'visiting', 'Shields', 'home', 'wonder', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'school', 'when', 'Shields', 'family', 'have', 'party', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'Hewitt', 'not', 'invited', 'glimpses', 'get', 'Shields', 'party', 'hardly', 'pining', 'quot', 'love', 'quot', 'partner', 'are', 'apt', 'believe', 'information', 'Hewitt', 'overheard', 'couple', 'have', 'broken', 'up', 'implication', 'being', 'Shields', 'again', 'free', 'agent', 'mixed', 'messages', 'culminate', 'Hewitt', 'confronting', 'Shields', 'nearly', 'raping', 'make', 'admit', 'still', 'Hewitt', 'required', 'act', 'more', 'Shields', 'character', 'more', 'stake', 'hers', 'narrative', 'back', 'boyish', 'head-lowering', 'makeup', 'masculinising', 'stubble', 'convicing', 'when', 'rain', 'Shields', 'however', 'used', 'model', 'Cinematographer', 'David', 'Watkin', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'height', 'beauty', 'standard', 'Shields', 'been', 'unable', 'rise', 'adult', 'years', 'film', 'also', 'James', 'Spader', 'one', 'early', 'snooty', 'roles', 'Shields', 'brother', 'beefy', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'one', 'scene']",N/A

Brooke's best flicks of all times, especially during her adolescent years before she even did the sitcom SUDDENLY SUSAN on NBC from 1996-2000.ENDLESS LOVE was a moderate box-office success when Universal released this in the Summer of 1981 and the film's theme song by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie was also called ""Endless Love"" which became a #1 hit on the radio on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the biggest-selling single in Diana Ross's career, especially after this movies theatrical release in the Summer of 1981.In suburban Chicago, 15-year old Jade Butterfield(Brooke Shields)and 17-year old David Axelrod(Martin Hewitt)fall in love after being introduced by Jade's big brother Keith Butterfield(Jimmy Spader)whom was also supposed to be David's best friend while Jade & David develop an all-consuming and passionate relationship who become hot-and-heavy as their relationship progresses which ends up turning Jade's household upside down causing things to go from bad to worse, especially after Keith turns his back on David after discovering that David has been banging his sister and when Jade's father Hugh Butterfield(Don Murray)littereally catches David with his pants down bare-assed in Jade's bedroom with Jade half-naked too.Jade's family is known in their community for a Bohemian lifestyle; they allow the 2 to make love in Jade's bedroom, but in contrast to the openness of her family, David's home life is dull since his folks are wealthy political activists who aren't actively involved in his life.One night Jade's mother Ann Butterfield(Shirley Knight)sneaks downstairs in the middle of the night and starts living vicariously after catching David humping Jade in the living room with the 2 lovebirds buck-naked in front of the fireplace, but Ann surprisingly doesn't even try to stop them even though that would be unacceptable to most parents, not to mention 2 teenagers having sex in a parents house while the parents are still there is quite suicidal and dumb.As Jade's relationship with David resumes; Hugh gets more and more suspicious of the couple by watching them with increasing unease & soon Jade comes to the realization that her intimacy with David are leading to her sleep deprivation & adversely causing her to to do poorly at school, so then Hugh firmly and subsequently tries to persuade David to stop seeing Jade for the rest of the school year till Summer vacation, but then Ann is able to coax David into agreeing with Hugh, despite David being strongly opposed to Hugh's idea while David's relationship with Jade goes no where, but downhill from there on forward.Unfortunately, the movie becomes a sad story from there on since David pulls a stunt by starting a fire on the Butterfield's porch to make himself look like a hero to win Jade back by warning the family about the fire on time, but then his idea backfires and winds up in smoke when the flames spread too far and the Butterfield's entire house ends up getting lost in the fire resulting in David being arrested & incarcerrated in a crazy house for 2 years after going to trial for arson & is forbidden from ever going near Jade or her family again.Nevertheless, David continues to write daily, but his letters are held and never mailed & doesn't recieve them till upon his exit discovering why Jade never wrote back to him thus renewing his spark to pursue her, but when David gets released on probation, he goes searching for Jade & remains in love with her.Meanwhile; following the loss of the Butterfield's home, the Butterfield family has moved to New York & Ann and Hugh end up in divorce, but when David gets spotted by Hugh on the streets in Manhattan, Hugh gets killed by a moving car while chasing after David across the street, but then Hugh's new girlfriend Ingrid Orchester(Penelope Milford)and Keith automatically jump to the conclusion that it's David's fault for Hugh's death since David was seen at the scene of the accident & then Keith tries to convince Jade that Hugh wouldn't be dead if it wasn't for David, but Jade still refuses to buy Keith's story & turns to David for the truth, but then Keith gets in a big scuffle with David before he even got a chance to explain how Hugh's accident actually occured & then David gets arrested again by the police for brawling & disturbing the peace and then winds up in prison this time seemingly doomed to never see Jade again, but Jade is still convinced that nobody will ever love her the way David does.So then the movie ends with a tearjerking final scene with Jade walking toward the prison where David is being held and doing time at while the song ENDLESS LOVE by Lionel Richie & Dionne Warwick is played and making you wonder why Jade and David wasted their life and wasted their time trying to stay together and reconcile instead of trying to move on with somebody new and avoiding all these hassles, impracticalities, and tragedies & trouble, along with the fact David & Jade's relationship seemed to more sexual than anything else.But I guess the producers wanted Brooke Shields & Martin Hewitt not to move on to start a new life with someone new in order to make the movie fit up with it's title to show us what ""Endless Love"" can also be as well, especially since we all have a tendency to do stupid things when we're in love, especially when we're young including premarital sex and not always picking the right ones to date and/or marry for that matter either.By the way; ENDLESS LOVE was also the feature film debut for a number of actos such
