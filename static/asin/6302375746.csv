I first saw this film when it debuted in the 70s, then again on scratchy VHS in the eighties, and now finally on pristine digital DVD in the 21st century. While there's no denying the datedness of the hairstyles, fashions, and omnipresent cigarettes, there's also something very current in its diversity: female and male, old and young, black, white, and brown.The film has been lovingly restored, with a wonderful where-they-are-now section in the bonus features.  For those who survived that tumultuous time, it was nice to see that they had aged along with me, these old familiar faces that look almost like old friends now.  If you look beyond superficial fashion, of course, a movie like this can never be dated because it's about people talking about their lives.",5,Word Is Out AGAIN!,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,797,"['was', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'debuted', '70s', 'then', 'again', 'scratchy', 'VHS', 'eighties', 'now', 'finally', 'pristine', 'digital', 'DVD', '21st', 'century', 'denying', 'datedness', 'hairstyles', 'fashions', 'omnipresent', 'cigarettes', 'also', 'something', 'very', 'current', 'diversity', 'female', 'male', 'old', 'young', 'black', 'white', 'brown.The', 'film', 'been', 'lovingly', 'restored', 'wonderful', 'where-they-are-now', 'section', 'bonus', 'features', 'who', 'survived', 'tumultuous', 'time', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'had', 'aged', 'old', 'familiar', 'look', 'almost', 'old', 'friends', 'now', 'look', 'superficial', 'fashion', 'course', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'dated', 'people', 'talking', 'lives']",N/A

The first feature-length documentary about lesbian and gay identity made by gay filmmakers, the film had a huge impact when it was released and became an icon of the emerging gay rights movement of the 1970s.In honor of its place in our collective history, Word Is Out has been selected for the Legacy Project for GLBT Film Preservation by Outfest and the UCLA Film & Television Archive. The original film negative will be restored this year, and the re-mastered 35 mm print  will be shown at public events in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It will then be available for international exhibition through Word Is Out's longtime distributor, New Yorker Films.The 30th anniversary DVD will include the original theatrical version of the film, exclusive updates on the cast and the filmmakers and an homage to Peter Adair, originator and inspired producer of Word is Out who died of AIDS in 1996.Quoted from the Word is Out Website: [...]Donate to the effort if you can....",5,The Originial Producers are trying to fund a DVD....,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,1276,"['Quoted', 'Word', 'Out', 'Website', '[', ']', 'celebrate', '30th', 'anniversary', 'WORD', 'IS', 'OUT', 'Mariposa', 'Film', 'Group', 'begun', 'production', 'DVD.Thirty', 'years', 'ago', '1977', 'Word', 'Out', 'Stories', 'Lives', 'startled', 'audiences', 'country', 'when', 'appeared', 'movie', 'theaters', 'television', 'first', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'lesbian', 'gay', 'identity', 'made', 'gay', 'filmmakers', 'film', 'had', 'huge', 'impact', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'became', 'icon', 'emerging', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', '1970s.In', 'honor', 'place', 'collective', 'history', 'Word', 'Out', 'been', 'selected', 'Legacy', 'Project', 'GLBT', 'Film', 'Preservation', 'Outfest', 'UCLA', 'Film', 'Television', 'Archive', 'original', 'film', 'negative', 'will', 'be', 'restored', 'year', 're-mastered', '35', 'mm', 'print', 'will', 'be', 'shown', 'public', 'events', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'San', 'Francisco', 'will', 'then', 'be', 'available', 'international', 'exhibition', 'Word', 'Out', 'longtime', 'distributor', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Films.The', '30th', 'anniversary', 'DVD', 'will', 'include', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'exclusive', 'updates', 'cast', 'filmmakers', 'homage', 'Peter', 'Adair', 'originator', 'inspired', 'producer', 'Word', 'Out', 'who', 'died', 'AIDS', '1996.Quoted', 'Word', 'Out', 'Website', '[', ']', 'Donate', 'effort', 'can']",N/A
309145,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,6302375746,Haunted Flower,"[3, 3]","""Word Is Out"" was the first feature-length documentary about homosexuality made by gay filmmakers and was premiered in 1977. Twenty-six people of very different backgrounds, ages, races, and lifestyles were selected after interviewing 140 people to tell the stories of their lives.Thank goodness times have improved compared to what these people had to deal with in 1977 or even as far back as the 1940s and 1950s for some. There is still a long way to go, but this film does serve as a marker for how much progress has been made in the meantime. For example, one lesbian couple even though they were excellent parents to their kids from previous marriages had them removed from their home due to the type of environment the kids were being raised in.There are some amazing interviews that get these people to open up about when/how they discovered they were different from others and how it affected their lives. How it affected those around them and the challenges with finding other like-minded people to communicate with. Many of them felt like they were all alone in the world. Also they talked about what they hoped for in the future in terms of rights for gays and lesbians. One very vocal woman said it had to be about women only fighting for women's rights and not worry about the guys since women have it tougher.Many of these stories are emotional and talk of the hardships of being sent away to a mental facility and threatened with or had electroshock therapy used upon them to ""cure"" them. A few stories are on the funny side like a bunch of women dressing like men to join up in the armed forces. What is most amazing is that these stories are being shared at all in this time period and many of their feelings on subjects are heavily relevant today, 70s hairstyles and clothes or not.""Word is Out"" is being released now to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Gay Pride marches. The film has been newly restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive and its Outfest Legacy Project due to time taking its toll on existing prints and the film rarely being seen anymore although it was a landmark in cinema. The restoration is pretty great and seeing it now captures so much of the feel of the time period. This documentary had been shown in theaters around the world and on prime-time television and helped countless people accept themselves as well as their friends and families and positively impacted the American culture.Bonus Features:Then and Now - Thirty Years Later is a fabulous featurette about the history behind this film. Note that there is no single director but a collective group that worked together and called themselves the Mariposa Group. They made decisions together and shared responsibility.The Afterthoughts section gives you a chance to see some of the interviewees as they are today and how their lives have changed and what they thought of the film and their involvement in it.One small featurette is of the Mariposa Group remembering Peter Adair, one of their members who passed away. Executive producer David Bohnett quickly speaks about the film's impact and there are additional credits for the restoration and a trailer for this film and a PSA for the Outfest Legacy Project.",5,Amazing interviews for that point in time that are an eye-opening experience,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,3220,"['Word', 'Out', 'was', 'first', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'homosexuality', 'made', 'gay', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'premiered', '1977', 'Twenty-six', 'people', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'ages', 'races', 'lifestyles', 'were', 'selected', 'interviewing', '140', 'people', 'tell', 'stories', 'lives.Thank', 'goodness', 'times', 'have', 'improved', 'compared', 'what', 'people', 'had', 'deal', '1977', 'even', 'far', 'back', '1940s', '1950s', 'still', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'film', 'serve', 'marker', 'how', 'much', 'progress', 'been', 'made', 'meantime', 'example', 'one', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'even', 'were', 'excellent', 'parents', 'kids', 'previous', 'marriages', 'had', 'removed', 'home', 'due', 'type', 'environment', 'kids', 'were', 'being', 'raised', 'are', 'amazing', 'interviews', 'get', 'people', 'open', 'up', 'when/how', 'discovered', 'were', 'different', 'others', 'how', 'affected', 'lives', 'How', 'affected', 'challenges', 'finding', 'other', 'like-minded', 'people', 'communicate', 'Many', 'felt', 'were', 'alone', 'world', 'Also', 'talked', 'what', 'hoped', 'future', 'terms', 'rights', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'One', 'very', 'vocal', 'woman', 'said', 'had', 'be', 'women', 'only', 'fighting', 'women', 'rights', 'not', 'worry', 'guys', 'women', 'have', 'tougher.Many', 'stories', 'are', 'emotional', 'talk', 'hardships', 'being', 'sent', 'away', 'mental', 'facility', 'threatened', 'had', 'electroshock', 'therapy', 'used', 'cure', 'few', 'stories', 'are', 'funny', 'side', 'bunch', 'women', 'dressing', 'men', 'join', 'up', 'armed', 'forces', 'What', 'most', 'amazing', 'stories', 'are', 'being', 'shared', 'time', 'period', 'many', 'feelings', 'subjects', 'are', 'heavily', 'relevant', 'today', '70s', 'hairstyles', 'clothes', 'not', 'Word', 'Out', 'being', 'released', 'now', 'celebrate', '40th', 'anniversary', 'Gay', 'Pride', 'marches', 'film', 'been', 'newly', 'restored', 'UCLA', 'Film', 'Television', 'Archive', 'Outfest', 'Legacy', 'Project', 'due', 'time', 'taking', 'toll', 'existing', 'prints', 'film', 'rarely', 'being', 'seen', 'anymore', 'was', 'landmark', 'cinema', 'restoration', 'pretty', 'great', 'seeing', 'now', 'so', 'much', 'feel', 'time', 'period', 'documentary', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'theaters', 'world', 'prime-time', 'television', 'helped', 'countless', 'people', 'accept', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'families', 'positively', 'impacted', 'American', 'culture.Bonus', 'Features', 'Then', 'Now', 'Thirty', 'Years', 'Later', 'fabulous', 'featurette', 'history', 'film', 'Note', 'single', 'director', 'collective', 'group', 'worked', 'together', 'called', 'Mariposa', 'Group', 'made', 'decisions', 'together', 'shared', 'responsibility.The', 'Afterthoughts', 'section', 'chance', 'see', 'interviewees', 'are', 'today', 'how', 'lives', 'have', 'changed', 'what', 'thought', 'film', 'involvement', 'it.One', 'small', 'featurette', 'Mariposa', 'Group', 'remembering', 'Peter', 'Adair', 'one', 'members', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'Executive', 'producer', 'David', 'Bohnett', 'quickly', 'film', 'impact', 'are', 'additional', 'credits', 'restoration', 'trailer', 'film', 'PSA', 'Outfest', 'Legacy', 'Project']",N/A
309146,ACIJVXJWC1SJO,6302375746,R. Geatz,"[2, 2]","I first saw this film upon its release in the late 1970s.  I journeyed from my Appalachian small town to the big city of Washington DC just to see it.  This film certainly changed my life... and may have saved it.  It gave me the courage to come out and confidence, knowing that I was not alone.  Seeing it more than 30 years later fills me with nostalgia and reminds me what a good film it is, regardless of my orientation.  You get to know a diverse and interesting group of gay people--all shapes and sizes, genders and ethnicities.  The seventies styles will induce smiles among those old enough to remember them, and there's a sense of joy in recognizing how far we've come in the past three decades.  There are lots of laughs, too.... especially funny is Pat Bond's stories of passing as straight in the military pre-DADT. But there are moments of tremendous sadness and disgust as some of the people recount the misery they endured... often at the hands of their own families.The extras provide added dimension--with follow-up interviews with some of the subjects a quarter-century later.  It's heartwarming to see these survivors--wrinkled, gray and happy. Those missing remind us of how many men from that generation have been lost to AIDS.
