You know, a standard &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; treatment.  Instead, this is a great look at one family trying to survive in the economic maelstrom that is Argentina, circa 2001.  The tough economic conditions pressure Ricardo Darin's Rafael throughout the first third of the movie.  It builds and builds to a crescendo.  He spends the last hour+ trying to pick up the pieces.The movie never feels contrived or forced.  The translation is crisp and not overwhelming.  The sound quality is excellent - all of the dialogue can be heard, replete with that distinctive Argentinian accent.Although Darin is excellent here, I've got to think that this movie will long be remembered as Natalia Verbeke's stunning debut.

The writer and director have created a universal story about the place to which we've come as a society in the 21st Century.  The alienation of the individual whether by self induced means of over-reaching in career achievement, by the problem of the senior citizens groping for a place in this fast paced, youth oriented world, or by the 'new' diseases such as Alzheimers - all are put into his story, stirred with love and intellect, and the result is a feast for the soul and the heart.  Ricardo Darin subtly progresses from a divorced, distant father completely absorbed by a restaurant business he inherited and has only submerged himself in because of his need to at some point please his mother.  Hector Alterio is his father who remains at the side of his Alzheimer wife (incredibly portrayed by the immensely gifted Norma Aleandro), seeking only to grant her 'forgotten' wish of a true wedding.  The simplicity of this gesture of love alters the lives of all characters.  After a stay in the ICU following a myocardial infarction, the son (Darin) finds his way back to the meaning of love, of family, of changing the focus of his life.  This story may sound banal as stated, but with a cast of main and supporting actors of  this quality, I doubt there will be a dry eye in the room when you gift yourself with this film.

It's sad to realize how many of us fall in this category, where a business meeting can take precedence over those, more important things in one's life, but it happens.

It takes place in Argentina, during its 2001 economic crisis, but I think that everybody can relate to the subject it tackles, disregarding the place where one lives.The main character is Rafael (Ricardo Dar&iacute;n), a self-absorbed man in his forties who runs a prestigious Italian restaurant, ""Belvedere"". Rafael is separated, and has a daughter he often forgets to pick up due to his numerous responsibilities. Rafael also has a beautiful girlfriend, Naty (Natalia Verbeke), but doesn't pay her enough attention, so their relationship starts to go to the dogs.Rafael's relationship with Nino (H&eacute;ctor Alterio), his father, is good, but he hasn't seen her mother Norma (Norma Aleandro) in a year. He had a huge argument with her after dropping out of university, and they stopped talking to each other. Some time after that, his mother got Alzheimer's disease, an illness that made her forgetful and disoriented. As a result of all this, they never really manage to patch things up.Truth to be told, Rafael doesn't seem to mind. His entire life is his job, and he is content. That is, until he has a heart attack, something that leads him to revaluate his priorities, and to see things from another perspective. An excellent example is that while before he was against his father's idea of marrying Norma in a church (in a belated religious wedding after 44 years of being married), he ends up helping him to do exactly that. In a way, he realizes that even though Norma won't be aware of what exactly is happening, his parents would be doing something terribly important to them.But will Rafael be able to change his life after making such a tremendous mess out of things?. What is more, will he learn the real meaning of the word ""family""?. Watch ""Son of the bride"", and learn all that, and more.

710895,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00006BS7S,Randy Keehn,"[0, 0]","After watching ""Son of the Bride"" I found myself making comparisons to the movie ""All that Jazz"" which I had seen again recently.  In both movies, we follow a middle-aged divorcee as he struggles in his stressful job, juggling his personal life around a young girl friend and his responsibilities to look after a young adolescent daughter.  Chain-smoking as he struggles to maintain his focus, interacting out of necessity with his ex-wife, the stress builds itself up to a heart attack.  It is from that point that the movies finish in different directions.  While ""All that Jazz"" becomes a look, with regret, to the past, ""Son of the Bride"" becomes a look, with hope, to the future.This movie turns out to be quite the comedy.  We get a sense of comedy from the alzheimers-suffering mother who can swear like a sailor even when talking to a young child.  However, after about the first two thirds of the movie, I found myself laughing out loud on several occassions.  Part of the reason for that is how well the script and direction set up the characters and scenarios so well.  As excellent as the humor is, the real smiles we get are for the endearing statement of love that the movies strongly delivers.  In perhaps the signature scene of the film, our main character, Rafael, debates a Catholic priest over the ""44 years of love"" that his parents have achieved.  The priest doesn't exactly disagree with the point but can't see beyond the rules and regulations that obscure the truth.  There's another scene when Rafael's girl friend talks about what she was looking for in a relationship (and introduces us to Dick Watson) that further underscores the love of Rafael's parents.  However, these and other scenes don't tell the story as well as the actors Hector Alterio and Norma Aleandro do themselves.  The story culminates in a feel good finish that puts all the stress and chaos behind and gives us a bright future by showing us where true happiness comes from.",5,All That Love,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,1971,"['watching', 'Son', 'Bride', 'found', 'making', 'comparisons', 'movie', 'Jazz', 'had', 'seen', 'again', 'recently', 'movies', 'follow', 'middle-aged', 'divorcee', 'stressful', 'job', 'juggling', 'personal', 'life', 'young', 'girl', 'friend', 'responsibilities', 'look', 'young', 'adolescent', 'daughter', 'Chain-smoking', 'maintain', 'focus', 'interacting', 'necessity', 'ex-wife', 'stress', 'up', 'heart', 'attack', 'point', 'movies', 'finish', 'different', 'directions', 'Jazz', 'look', 'regret', 'past', 'Son', 'Bride', 'look', 'hope', 'future.This', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'comedy', 'get', 'sense', 'comedy', 'alzheimers-suffering', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'swear', 'sailor', 'even', 'when', 'talking', 'young', 'child', 'However', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'found', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'occassions', 'Part', 'reason', 'how', 'well', 'script', 'direction', 'set', 'up', 'characters', 'scenarios', 'so', 'well', 'As', 'excellent', 'humor', 'real', 'smiles', 'get', 'are', 'endearing', 'statement', 'love', 'movies', 'strongly', 'delivers', 'perhaps', 'signature', 'scene', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Rafael', 'Catholic', 'priest', '44', 'years', 'love', 'parents', 'have', 'achieved', 'priest', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'disagree', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'rules', 'regulations', 'obscure', 'truth', 'scene', 'when', 'Rafael', 'girl', 'friend', 'talks', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'relationship', 'Dick', 'Watson', 'further', 'love', 'Rafael', 'parents', 'However', 'other', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'Hector', 'Alterio', 'Norma', 'Aleandro', 'do', 'story', 'feel', 'good', 'finish', 'stress', 'chaos', 'bright', 'future', 'showing', 'where', 'true', 'happiness']",N/A
710896,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,B00006BS7S,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[5, 6]","This little seen Argentinian film is, simply put, one of the most refreshing comedies of the last few years. Nominated for a Foreign Language Film Academy Award in 2001, the movie stars Ricardo Darin (Nine Queens) as Rafael, a man who operates a restaurant once owned by his parents, Nino and Norma.Basically, the film shows us how Rafael's life changes through a series of events that happen to him and his family, with the final message being that there's more to life than work, and that love is the strongest force there is (at least, that's my take). The tag line says it all: ""If life passed you by, what are you waiting for to catch up?"". It has some of the funniest dialogues ever, showcasing, in a not-so-stereotypical way, how people from Buenos Aires speak and behave (and I should know, my wife's family's from there!) - although it should be said that some of it may get lost in the translation, especially when really local expressions are used.The acting is excellent accross the board. Darin is great as the not-so-likeable protagonist, with whom we grow closer as the movie progresses, and most of the other characters, like his girlfriend Naty (the lovely Natalia Verbeke), his ex-wife (Claudia Font&aacute;n) and others, while not having that much screen time, give great performances. But the best acting of the film is done by H&eacute;ctor Alterio, as Nino, Rafael's father, Norma Aleandro (they've worked together in many films, most notably The Official Story, and most recently Cleopatra, with Natalia Oreiro) who plays Norma, his Alzheimer's disease suffering mother, and by Eduardo Blanco, who plays Juan Carlos, his wacky childhood friend who has become an actor.If you're in the mood to try something that's decidedly not Hollywood, yet refreshing, funny and heartwarming, be sure to give this movie a look.

Ricardo Darin is one of today's best actors--he would be much more appreciated if he made movies in English.  Stories of mid-life crises are often tedious.  One wishes the actors would get on with it.  But this story is interesting with great acting (Norma Aleandro is superb as his mother) and witty dialog.  Even if you know Spanish its probably better to have the English subtitles on when you watch it, but this movie is one you can watch several times without loss of enjoyment.",5,Perhaps the best of Ricardo Darin,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,550,"['Interesting', 'story', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'various', 'mid-life', 'crises', 'Ricardo', 'Darin', 'one', 'today', 'best', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'appreciated', 'made', 'movies', 'English', 'Stories', 'mid-life', 'crises', 'are', 'often', 'tedious', 'One', 'actors', 'would', 'get', 'story', 'interesting', 'great', 'acting', 'Norma', 'Aleandro', 'superb', 'mother', 'witty', 'dialog', 'Even', 'know', 'Spanish', 'probably', 'better', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'loss', 'enjoyment']",N/A
