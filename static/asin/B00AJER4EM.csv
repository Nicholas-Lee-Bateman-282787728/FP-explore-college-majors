Marold""","[5, 7]","I think it is no accident that two out of the three five star reviews were written by people who saw a performance by this troupe live, on stage, as this production demonstrates the strengths of a live performance, especially in an Elizabethan theatre, and the drawbacks of filming such a performance.The recreation of the Globe was a delight. I confess I suspect the theatre is substantially larger than the original, although the shape is the same. The stage puts the actors very close to the audience. At a few points, the actors interact with audience members. Unfortunately, that means there is no way to have cameras come up to film the actors with close-ups. All the filming was probably done from three stationary cameras in the center, and to the left and right of the stage, at the back of the ""groundlings"" (See Shakespeare's Hamlet, Act III, Scene II: ""...to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise."") I was even skeptical of whether the actors wore microphones, or whether all the dialogue was picked up by small microphones around the stage. For a person with normal hearing, with normal or slightly higher volume than normal, all the dialogue could be heard plainly; however, I can appreciate the problem of a person with impaired hearing. The lighting and the sound from the group of instruments on the Mezzanine level above the stage was a bit weak.The acting by the principals, Charles Edwards as Benedick and Eve Best as Beatrice, was superior. The acting by most others was good by Shakespearean standards. I agree with the reviewer who was not happy with the characterization of Dogberry and his scenes. I looked at Dogberry's dialogue in the play, and I see very little which would support the kind of business and conceits played by this Dogberry.In many ways, this production suffers in comparison to Kenneth Branagh's production with an all star cast. Even Dogberry is played by a major name actor, Michael Keaton and lesser roles are played by actors in the front rank of Shakespearean acting such as Richard Briars and Brian Blessed. Keaton's interpretation of Dogberry is far more imaginative than the one in this production, although it seems a fair number of Dogberry's scenes were cut by Branagh. But the comparison is unfair, as they are virtually two different media, which we happen to see on film. This production has the virtue of being complete, as Shakespeare wrote it, not twisted about here and there, as when Branagh puts Balthazar's ""hey, nonny, nonny"" song in Beatrice's mouth.Get this version if you want true Shakespeare. Get Branagh's version if you want a glittering interpretation.",4,"Great Benedick and Beatrice, Weak Dogberry",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,2707,"['think', 'accident', 'two', 'three', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'were', 'written', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'performance', 'troupe', 'live', 'stage', 'production', 'strengths', 'live', 'performance', 'especially', 'Elizabethan', 'theatre', 'drawbacks', 'filming', 'such', 'performance.The', 'recreation', 'Globe', 'was', 'delight', 'confess', 'suspect', 'theatre', 'substantially', 'larger', 'original', 'shape', 'same', 'stage', 'actors', 'very', 'close', 'audience', 'few', 'points', 'actors', 'interact', 'audience', 'members', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'have', 'cameras', 'come', 'up', 'film', 'actors', 'close-ups', 'filming', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'three', 'stationary', 'cameras', 'center', 'left', 'right', 'stage', 'back', 'groundlings', 'See', 'Shakespeare', 'Hamlet', 'Act', 'III', 'Scene', 'II', 'split', 'ears', 'groundlings', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'capable', 'nothing', 'inexplicable', 'dumb', 'shows', 'noise', 'was', 'even', 'skeptical', 'actors', 'wore', 'microphones', 'dialogue', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'small', 'microphones', 'stage', 'person', 'normal', 'hearing', 'normal', 'slightly', 'higher', 'volume', 'normal', 'dialogue', 'could', 'be', 'heard', 'plainly', 'however', 'can', 'appreciate', 'problem', 'person', 'impaired', 'hearing', 'lighting', 'sound', 'group', 'instruments', 'Mezzanine', 'level', 'stage', 'was', 'bit', 'weak.The', 'acting', 'principals', 'Charles', 'Edwards', 'Benedick', 'Eve', 'Best', 'Beatrice', 'was', 'superior', 'acting', 'most', 'others', 'was', 'good', 'Shakespearean', 'standards', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'characterization', 'Dogberry', 'scenes', 'looked', 'Dogberry', 'dialogue', 'play', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'would', 'support', 'kind', 'business', 'conceits', 'played', 'Dogberry.In', 'many', 'ways', 'production', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'production', 'star', 'cast', 'Even', 'Dogberry', 'played', 'major', 'name', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'lesser', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'actors', 'front', 'rank', 'Shakespearean', 'acting', 'such', 'Richard', 'Briars', 'Brian', 'Blessed', 'Keaton', 'interpretation', 'Dogberry', 'far', 'more', 'imaginative', 'one', 'production', 'fair', 'number', 'Dogberry', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'Branagh', 'comparison', 'unfair', 'are', 'virtually', 'two', 'different', 'media', 'happen', 'see', 'film', 'production', 'virtue', 'being', 'complete', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', 'not', 'twisted', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'Branagh', 'Balthazar', 'hey', 'nonny', 'nonny', 'song', 'Beatrice', 'mouth.Get', 'version', 'want', 'true', 'Shakespeare', 'Get', 'Branagh', 'version', 'want', 'glittering', 'interpretation']",N/A

1612386,A1HWWRHXZ5GKP1,B00AJER4EM,"Eric Brinkman ""nyingpo""","[0, 0]","I have to admit, this is not my favorite production of Much Ado. But, if at the end of this performance, if you don't feel happy for Benedict and Beatrice, you are a plain villain! and have no soul. That two people could find each other such as this, and fall in love, gives hope for the world.At the risk of repeating myself (see my other reviews), if you haven't seen a Globe Theatre production of Shakespeare, you haven't seen Shakespeare. Seeing Shakespeare performed in his native environment (an outdoor circular theatre where the ""groundlings"" are right up to the stage), you realize why Shakespeare wrote some of the things he wrote or staged the action the way he did. In this production, about 20 minutes from the end, the way Benedict interacts with an audience member is hilarious.That being said, the director chose to stage this adaption as more leaning towards farce. Claudio, at the beginning of the play, acts like an idiot, and Don John hams up his villainy for comedic effect. Okay, I guess, but I think Kenneth Branagh's version is probably closer to what Shakespeare intended. The scene in that version where Beatrice asks Benedict to kill Claudio is harrowing (the hairs on my neck stand up every time I watch it). In this version, you never really worry about anything that will happen; it's all comedy and farce and you know it will be fine. Again, nothing necessary wrong with that, but I prefer my Shakespeare less modern (""comedy"" in modern usage means laughs; ""comedy"" in Shakespeare's time just meant everything works out in the end).The advantage this performance has over others (including Branagh's version) is that the text is not abridged. They perform every line of the original play; the only alteration I caught was they replaced the ""boy"" that gets Benedict's book with Margaret (I guess to save an actor). It's nice to see the play in its entirety (the only other way is to watch the BBC version).So if you like Shakespeare, this is must-see viewing. And please check out the other Globe productions on DVD, especially Henry IV Part 1.",5,"not my favorite, but you still have to watch it",1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,2074,"['have', 'admit', 'not', 'favorite', 'production', 'Much', 'Ado', 'end', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'happy', 'Benedict', 'Beatrice', 'are', 'plain', 'villain', 'have', 'soul', 'two', 'people', 'could', 'find', 'other', 'such', 'fall', 'love', 'hope', 'world.At', 'risk', 'repeating', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Globe', 'Theatre', 'production', 'Shakespeare', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Shakespeare', 'Seeing', 'Shakespeare', 'performed', 'native', 'environment', 'outdoor', 'circular', 'theatre', 'where', 'groundlings', 'are', 'right', 'stage', 'realize', 'why', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', 'things', 'wrote', 'staged', 'action', 'way', 'did', 'production', '20', 'minutes', 'end', 'way', 'Benedict', 'audience', 'member', 'hilarious.That', 'being', 'said', 'director', 'chose', 'stage', 'adaption', 'more', 'leaning', 'towards', 'farce', 'Claudio', 'beginning', 'play', 'idiot', 'Don', 'John', 'up', 'villainy', 'comedic', 'effect', 'Okay', 'guess', 'think', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'version', 'probably', 'closer', 'what', 'Shakespeare', 'intended', 'scene', 'version', 'where', 'Beatrice', 'Benedict', 'kill', 'Claudio', 'harrowing', 'hairs', 'neck', 'stand', 'up', 'time', 'watch', 'version', 'never', 'really', 'worry', 'anything', 'will', 'happen', 'comedy', 'farce', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'Again', 'nothing', 'necessary', 'wrong', 'prefer', 'Shakespeare', 'less', 'modern', 'comedy', 'modern', 'usage', 'comedy', 'Shakespeare', 'time', 'just', 'meant', 'everything', 'out', 'end', 'advantage', 'performance', 'over', 'others', 'including', 'Branagh', 'version', 'text', 'not', 'abridged', 'perform', 'line', 'original', 'play', 'only', 'alteration', 'caught', 'was', 'replaced', 'boy', 'Benedict', 'book', 'Margaret', 'guess', 'save', 'actor', 'nice', 'see', 'play', 'entirety', 'only', 'other', 'way', 'watch', 'BBC', 'version', '.So', 'like', 'Shakespeare', 'must-see', 'viewing', 'please', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'Globe', 'productions', 'DVD', 'especially', 'Henry', 'IV', 'Part', '1']",N/A

1612389,A1V9VW14946PNC,B00AJER4EM,Richard Askenase,"[1, 1]","I have seen three different Shakespeare plays at the Globe theater in London, and they have all been a fantastic experience.  Two of them (Othello (Shakespeare's Globe Theatre Production)andHenry VIII: Shakespeare's Globe Theatre) have been released as dvd's  But, I haven't watched them yet.  This is the first dvd from the Globe that I have watched- and loved it.The reconstructed Globe theater is essentially an exact reproduction of a theatre (almost on this exact spot) where many of Shakespeare's plays were actually performed.  It is open air, quite ""natural"", with seats and standing room (groundlings) just as in 1600.  In fact, to me, with only a slight exaggeration, it is very much like being back 400 years and watching one of his plays.  Certainly the productions are meant to be reasonably authentic to those times.  And what great fun it is.""Much Ado"" is my favorite comedy, with great verbal wit between Beatrice and Benedict, and a plot and dialogue that it quite easy to follow. Here, Charles Edwards as Benedict really shines for me with a terrific performance.  All of the actors were very good, but I thought he was excellent (as did my wife).The staging was quite effective and funny, and it was well filmed.The closeness of the audience (the groundlings) and being able to see audience members in the background in some shots, makes this whole performance really come alive.  And, it even rained (drizzled) throughout much of the performance which heightened the reality of it even more.  Terrific.Let me say that if you get to London (and you should- a great city) you must go to the Globe theater to see a Shakespeare play.  The regular season is May through early October.  I understand that they are building a small indoor theater (about 300 seats) with candle lighting(!!) which is due to open in 2014 to put on plays all year.  Don't miss it.  But, these dvd's are a very good substitute.",5,"Terrific live performance, well captured on film.
