Unfortunately, I shouldn't have listened to these 3 previous reviews.  This film was made in 1986.  Nothing shocking here, nothing even remotely intersting.  It shows clips of old horror movies, from Bela Lugosi to the movies The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and other films of that era.  It had Elke Sommer giving the most interesting narrative about her haunted house.  They talked to a few psychics, took way too much time on the Amityville Horror, which has already been proven a hoax for many years now.  For this day and age, this DVD is sort of a waste of time.  I wish now that I had spent the money on something else.  But like I said, I was judging from the reviews....",1,More money wasted....,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,770,"['know', 'pretty', 'much', 'go', 'reviews', 'other', 'folks', 'when', 'deciding', 'buy', 'product', 'not', 'Unfortunately', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'listened', '3', 'previous', 'reviews', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1986', 'Nothing', 'shocking', 'here', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'intersting', 'clips', 'old', 'horror', 'movies', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'movies', 'Exorcist', 'Poltergeist', 'other', 'films', 'era', 'had', 'Elke', 'Sommer', 'giving', 'most', 'interesting', 'narrative', 'haunted', 'house', 'talked', 'few', 'psychics', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'already', 'been', 'proven', 'hoax', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'day', 'age', 'DVD', 'sort', 'waste', 'time', 'wish', 'now', 'had', 'spent', 'money', 'something', 'else', 'said', 'was', 'judging', 'reviews']",Hollywood Ghost Stories

966259,A2QO4P5SGAZYI8,B000E1P2EO,Nancy A. Fox,"[1, 1]","This is a fun program as long as you keep certain things in mind:1) This was produced in the late 1980s2) The producers were attempting to seriously look into actual hauntings connected with Hollywood.If you want the most up-to-date information, look elsewhere. In fact, I'd recommend looking into the History Channel's Haunted History series, I believe they've produced one on Hollywood. The Haunted History program is a few years old, but it would be more current than this film.If you want wild sensational stories, you won't find that here either. The producers were trying to show the difference between alleged real life hauntings and Hollywood movies. If you read into the phenomena reported in purported hauntings, they consist mostly of strange sounds, odd smells, cold spots, and short lived apparitions. Most of this wouldn't make a very interesting movie or television show, so while most Hollywood ghost stories start with this sort of phenomena it certainly doesn't end there.A couple of the cases that were looked into were made into successful Hollywood ghost/horror films such as The Entity and The Amityville Horror. It was nice contrasting and comparing the Hollywood treatment of these stories. When this show was recorded, the Amityville Horror was still being debated as to whether it was real or a hoax with strong opinions on both sides, but today it's pretty much regarded as a hoax.I especially enjoyed the interviews with Elke Sommer talking about the haunting at her former residence, and I enjoyed the interviews with parapsychologists who discuss their investigations. One person made a point to say how unlike movies like Poltergeist their investigations are.John Carradine is a fun choice for the host. He may be a little over-the-top, but he seems like he's enjoying himself. The clips from famous horror movies are also a lot of fun to watch. So if you are a fan of classic Hollywood ghost stories, as well as fascinated by real life hauntings, you would probably enjoy this DVD. You're not going to come away with any great ""Truths"", but it's an interesting hour of entertainment and you can learn a few things as well.",4,Recommended with Reservations,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,2154,"['fun', 'program', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'certain', 'things', 'mind:1', 'was', 'produced', 'late', '1980s2', 'producers', 'were', 'attempting', 'seriously', 'look', 'actual', 'hauntings', 'connected', 'Hollywood.If', 'want', 'most', 'up-to-date', 'information', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'fact', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'looking', 'History', 'Channel', 'Haunted', 'History', 'series', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'produced', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'Haunted', 'History', 'program', 'few', 'years', 'old', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'current', 'film.If', 'want', 'wild', 'sensational', 'stories', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'show', 'difference', 'alleged', 'real', 'life', 'hauntings', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'read', 'phenomena', 'reported', 'purported', 'hauntings', 'consist', 'mostly', 'strange', 'sounds', 'odd', 'smells', 'cold', 'spots', 'short', 'lived', 'apparitions', 'Most', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'television', 'show', 'so', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'ghost', 'stories', 'start', 'sort', 'phenomena', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'end', 'there.A', 'couple', 'cases', 'were', 'looked', 'were', 'made', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'ghost/horror', 'films', 'such', 'Entity', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'was', 'nice', 'contrasting', 'comparing', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'stories', 'When', 'show', 'was', 'recorded', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'debated', 'was', 'real', 'hoax', 'strong', 'opinions', 'sides', 'today', 'pretty', 'much', 'regarded', 'hoax.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'interviews', 'Elke', 'Sommer', 'talking', 'haunting', 'former', 'residence', 'enjoyed', 'interviews', 'parapsychologists', 'who', 'discuss', 'investigations', 'One', 'person', 'made', 'point', 'say', 'how', 'movies', 'Poltergeist', 'investigations', 'are.John', 'Carradine', 'fun', 'choice', 'host', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'enjoying', 'clips', 'famous', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'So', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'ghost', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'fascinated', 'real', 'life', 'hauntings', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'come', 'away', 'great', 'Truths', 'interesting', 'hour', 'entertainment', 'can', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'as', 'well']",Hollywood Ghost Stories
