880751,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0007GP714,C. O. DeRiemer,"[24, 24]","Hetty Wainthropp is a popular sleuth from British television who has shown up on PBS now and then. She's played by Patricia Routledge as a practical, no-nonsense woman with a sense of humor who got in the sleuthing game when her husband retired and she decided she could solve a mystery as well as the next person and make a little extra money doing it. The series started in 1996. This is the pilot. It was made in 1990 and wasn't picked up. It took six years before people figured out how to make the show work. This pilot, unfortunately, sort of demonstrates why the powers passed the first time.Hetty is reluctantly asked to find the lost son of her best friend's husband. He'd been married once before. She does so by being smart and persistent, but then she's asked by the son to find his son, a 16-year old who has gone missing. Eventually she does, but only after some adventures.Unfortunately, the mystery is much less a mystery than a family drama. Much time is spent on the characters' past. A good deal of time at the end is spent with Hetty trying to bring back some spirit to her best friend after the husband dies of a stroke. By the end of the program the grandson is going to work with Hetty on more cases and Hetty's husband is starting to complain about all the frozen meals she leaves him while she's out sleuthing.Patricia Routledge is great in breathing character and interest into Hetty. It's the story itself that just doesn't have a lot of energy. Still, it was fun to see how Hetty got her start and to compare the changes that were made between this pilot and, six years later, the series.",3,"Pleasant, But Not Particularly Engrossing",1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,1616,"['Hetty', 'Wainthropp', 'popular', 'sleuth', 'British', 'television', 'who', 'shown', 'up', 'PBS', 'now', 'then', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Routledge', 'practical', 'no-nonsense', 'woman', 'sense', 'humor', 'who', 'got', 'sleuthing', 'game', 'when', 'husband', 'retired', 'decided', 'could', 'solve', 'mystery', 'as', 'well', 'next', 'person', 'make', 'little', 'extra', 'money', 'doing', 'series', 'started', '1996', 'pilot', 'was', 'made', '1990', 'was', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', 'took', 'six', 'years', 'people', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'show', 'work', 'pilot', 'unfortunately', 'sort', 'demonstrates', 'why', 'powers', 'passed', 'first', 'time.Hetty', 'reluctantly', 'asked', 'find', 'lost', 'son', 'best', 'friend', 'husband', ""'d"", 'been', 'married', 'once', 'before', 'so', 'being', 'smart', 'persistent', 'then', 'asked', 'son', 'find', 'son', '16-year', 'old', 'who', 'gone', 'missing', 'Eventually', 'only', 'adventures.Unfortunately', 'mystery', 'much', 'less', 'mystery', 'family', 'drama', 'Much', 'time', 'spent', 'characters', 'past', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'end', 'spent', 'Hetty', 'trying', 'bring', 'back', 'spirit', 'best', 'friend', 'husband', 'stroke', 'end', 'program', 'grandson', 'going', 'work', 'Hetty', 'more', 'cases', 'Hetty', 'husband', 'starting', 'complain', 'frozen', 'meals', 'out', 'sleuthing.Patricia', 'Routledge', 'great', 'breathing', 'character', 'interest', 'Hetty', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'energy', 'Still', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'Hetty', 'got', 'start', 'compare', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'pilot', 'six', 'years', 'later', 'series']",N/A
880752,AY12DBB0U420B,B0007GP714,Gary Peterson,"[6, 6]","I found last night's movie while cleaning out our DVD shelves. It's ""Hetty Wainthropp in Missing Persons"" and starring Patricia Routledge, one of England's leading actresses. My wife used to live in England and likes mysteries so I suspect that's the origin of this DVD. Supposedly, it was the pilot episode for a TV series, but I'm uncertain of the fate of the series, and I would probably not be interested in watching further episodes.In this movie, Hetty Wainthropp began a career as a private investigator by helping her best friend's husband track down his long-lost (about 50 years) son and set up a rather touching reunion. Then, as it turned out, the son's teen-age son was also missing and off went Hetty into her new career of finding missing persons. It's an interesting story, but could have used considerable re-writing. The first half of the movie really bumbled along and I considered turning it off several times. The second half became much more dramatic and the last third was quite touching in places. I could see how Patricia Routledge was so highly regarded.Parts of the movie simply defied credibility. For example, when Hetty was going to London to find the lost teen-age boy, the pimply-faced boy sitting next to her on the bus was, unbeknownst to her, the boy she was looking for. Well, what can I say? What are the odds of something like that in a city the size of London? In any case, she was unsuccessful in finding the boy and decided to return home. She got on the bus, and a young boy, you guessed it, the one  she was looking for, sat down next to her. Now, does that strain credibility, or what? There were a lot of other things in the movie that needed cleaning up.In any case, the movie really bumbled along but turned out to be not a bad movie, but a very imperfect one. The photography and setting was interesting and the sound track wasn't bad. I'd say it deserves four stars.Gary Peterson",4,"The Beginning Of A Career.

880755,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B0007GP714,Shopper,"[1, 1]","I adored Ms Routledge in her role as Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances. She was so good, I assumed she had always been a comedic actress. Therefore, imagine my surprise when I came across a pilot of a mystery series with Ms Routledge in the lead role. Clearly, I had to investigate further. The pilot, ""Missing Persons"" was filmed in 1990 (just before ""Keeping Up Appearances"", which ran 1990 thru 1995). To put it bluntly, it was not very good, and unsurprisingly, was not immediately picked up for development. Thankfully, some clever soul eventually recognized the material's potential and after ""Keeping Up Appearances"" ended, the new series went full steam. ""Hetty Wainthropp Investigates"" is based on a novel ""Missing Persons"" by David Cook. The author used a real life character, his own mother, as an inspiration for Hetty. ""Missing Persons"" tells the story of how Hetty, a working class housewife, discovers late in life an affinity for intuitive thinking and an appreciation for earning her own wage. In the course of her professional pursuits, Hetty comes accross Robert, a wayward youth she and her husband eventually accept into their humble home (due to the time lapse, in the series the teen actor playing Robert was replaced by the pre-Lord-of-the-Rings Dominic Monaghan).The pilot ""Missing Persons"" did not age well. The action stalled quite frequently and vast parts were written poorly. Then there was the odd singing number and all-too-often talk about aching feet. I strongly advise that you view the pilot for historical purposes only. Then, promptly forget it and move on to the MUCH improved and highly entertaining series.
