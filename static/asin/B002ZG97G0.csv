1302697,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002ZG97G0,Craig Whittle,"[0, 0]","DIARY OF A WIMPY KIDSTARRING: Zachary Gordon, Robert Capron, Steve Zahn, Rachael Harris, Devon Bostick, Chloe Mortez, Grayson Russell and Karan BrarWRITTEN BY: Jackie Filgo, Jeff Filgo, Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah; based on the book by Jeff KinneyDIRECTED BY: Thor FreudenthalRated: PGGenre: ComedyRelease Date: 19 March 2010Review Date: 25 March 2010It's probably safe to say that nine out of 10 people, who received public education, had at the very least felt uncomfortable at some point during the process. This is largely what will cause so many to relate to the humor found in the new comedy Diary of a Wimpy Kid.This film will no doubt become one of those that has created several stars. It's oozing with talented child actors who will make it big in the years to come; primarily it's two lead actors Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron. Diary of a Wimpy Kid reminded me of a PG version of High Fidelity; Gordon as John Cusack and Capron being Jack Black. Several of the actors portraying side characters, have bright futures in acting as well.The film is based on the popular book that has spawned several sequels, written by Jeff Kinney. Our host is Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) and he wants us to know something: he's about to start his first day of middle school, and wants nothing more than to be popular. Oh, and he wanted this to be a journal, but his mom bought him a diary by mistake.Being the second shortest kid in school, and having what others consider an outcast for a best friend, Rowley (Robert Capron); Greg has his work cut out for him.Greg is so caught up with fitting in that he completely neglects, manipulates, and constantly tries to change his best friend Rowley. Despite the fact that it hasn't exactly worked out so well for him thus far, Greg has a textbook idea of what it takes to be popular. We can at least hand it to him that he does want his pal to be popular too.Like a little Zack Morris in training, Greg has plan after plan to get people to notice and appreciate him. Tormented by his older brother, (Devon Bostick) who promises he will never survive middle school; Greg has to prove him wrong. He tries everything from joining the wrestling team, to signing up for the school's honor program, always dragging Rowley along with him.Rowley is more than content with who he is and he really steals the show in several scenes. He's a chubby kid, who's a bit of a mamma's boy and doesn't quite understand that kids no longer `play'; as is shown in one funny scene where everyone laughs at him when he asks Greg if he'd care to partake in this once perfectly acceptable activity.Just like any good movie should, especially one for kids, Diary of a Wimpy Kid has an important moral theme, and man does it go to drastic lengths to get it across. Like a bar of soap after a foul word or two, the themes of integrity and friendship are placed into our mouths, and then sealed shut until the end of the film. The taste sets on our tongue and we have more than learned our lesson by the movie's conclusion; and rightfully so. I just hope that youngsters, who the film is aimed at, will pick up on it, as the ending is rather abrupt with showing our hero learn his lesson. And we learned it without a doubt; but did Greg?The film could have been a little better I suppose, but it was still better than a lot of comedies I've seen lately, and delivered far more than I expected. Kids will love it and it's a clean film for them to enjoy. As a bonus, adults will laugh quite a bit as well. Still not convinced mom and dad? Did I mention Steve Zahn plays Greg's dad?",4,Diary of a Wimpy Kid Review,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,3591,"['DIARY', 'A', 'WIMPY', 'KIDSTARRING', 'Zachary', 'Gordon', 'Robert', 'Capron', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Rachael', 'Harris', 'Devon', 'Bostick', 'Chloe', 'Mortez', 'Grayson', 'Russell', 'Karan', 'BrarWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Jackie', 'Filgo', 'Jeff', 'Filgo', 'Gabe', 'Sachs', 'Jeff', 'Judah', 'based', 'book', 'Jeff', 'KinneyDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Thor', 'FreudenthalRated', 'PGGenre', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '19', 'March', '2010Review', 'Date', '25', 'March', '2010It', 'probably', 'safe', 'say', 'nine', '10', 'people', 'who', 'received', 'public', 'education', 'had', 'very', 'least', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'point', 'process', 'largely', 'what', 'will', 'cause', 'so', 'many', 'relate', 'humor', 'found', 'new', 'comedy', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid.This', 'film', 'will', 'doubt', 'become', 'one', 'created', 'several', 'stars', 'oozing', 'talented', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'big', 'years', 'come', 'primarily', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Zachary', 'Gordon', 'Robert', 'Capron', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'reminded', 'PG', 'version', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'Gordon', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Capron', 'being', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Several', 'actors', 'portraying', 'side', 'characters', 'have', 'bright', 'futures', 'acting', 'well.The', 'film', 'based', 'popular', 'book', 'spawned', 'several', 'sequels', 'written', 'Jeff', 'Kinney', 'host', 'Greg', 'Heffley', 'Zachary', 'Gordon', 'know', 'something', 'start', 'first', 'day', 'middle', 'school', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'popular', 'Oh', 'wanted', 'be', 'journal', 'mom', 'bought', 'diary', 'mistake.Being', 'second', 'shortest', 'kid', 'school', 'having', 'what', 'others', 'consider', 'outcast', 'best', 'friend', 'Rowley', 'Robert', 'Capron', 'Greg', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'him.Greg', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'fitting', 'completely', 'manipulates', 'constantly', 'tries', 'change', 'best', 'friend', 'Rowley', 'fact', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'worked', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'thus', 'far', 'Greg', 'textbook', 'idea', 'what', 'be', 'popular', 'can', 'least', 'hand', 'want', 'pal', 'be', 'popular', 'little', 'Zack', 'Morris', 'training', 'Greg', 'plan', 'plan', 'get', 'people', 'notice', 'appreciate', 'Tormented', 'older', 'brother', 'Devon', 'Bostick', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'survive', 'middle', 'school', 'Greg', 'prove', 'wrong', 'everything', 'joining', 'wrestling', 'team', 'signing', 'up', 'school', 'honor', 'program', 'always', 'dragging', 'Rowley', 'him.Rowley', 'more', 'content', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'several', 'scenes', 'chubby', 'kid', 'who', 'bit', 'mamma', 'boy', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'no', 'longer', 'play', 'shown', 'one', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'everyone', 'when', 'Greg', ""'d"", 'care', 'partake', 'once', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'activity.Just', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'especially', 'one', 'kids', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'important', 'moral', 'theme', 'man', 'go', 'drastic', 'lengths', 'get', 'bar', 'soap', 'foul', 'word', 'two', 'themes', 'integrity', 'friendship', 'are', 'placed', 'mouths', 'then', 'sealed', 'shut', 'end', 'film', 'taste', 'tongue', 'have', 'more', 'learned', 'lesson', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'rightfully', 'so', 'just', 'hope', 'youngsters', 'who', 'film', 'aimed', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'ending', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'showing', 'hero', 'learn', 'lesson', 'learned', 'doubt', 'did', 'Greg', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'suppose', 'was', 'still', 'better', 'lot', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'delivered', 'far', 'more', 'expected', 'Kids', 'will', 'love', 'clean', 'film', 'enjoy', 'bonus', 'adults', 'will', 'laugh', 'quite', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'not', 'convinced', 'mom', 'dad', 'Did', 'mention', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Greg', 'dad']",N/A

1302699,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG97G0,C. Sawin,"[4, 7]","It's always kind of awkward going into a movie you know is based on a book, but you never read the source material since it never interested you. Now there's a movie and a buzz beginning to pick up, but you still don't see the attraction. So if you're forced to see the movie and don't like it, is it because you convinced yourself you weren't going to like it going in or is it because it's just not a good movie? Well an open mind is a good thing, but sometimes things just aren't your cup of tea and you don't like a movie because it's either not good or it's aimed at an audience that you don't fit into. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is shelved somewhere between not being good and being aimed at a younger audience.The movie begins with an incredibly predictable opening and it kind of sets the tone for the rest of the movie while also giving you an idea of the hell you're about to sit through. In a nutshell, Diary of a Wimpy Kid is about middle school pains; the ups and downs of trying to blend in and be popular while dealing with the outrageous transition from elementary to middle school. As an adult, middle school isn't exactly something you think about regularly. High school? Yes. Middle school? Not so much. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is able to make you feel a little nostalgic about middle school and triggers memories similar to what Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) is trying to accomplish. School is obviously going to be the most important part of your life, right? After school activities, being popular, and attaining that class favorite moniker in the yearbook is the only way you'll ever get anywhere in this world.But a slight wave of nostalgia isn't really enough to make this movie worthwhile. It's incredibly juvenile, which is to be expected. But the humor will more than likely come off as some of the most dense material you've heard in quite some time; sibling rivalry, getting peed on, boogers, hairy moles, and being creeped out by unusual individuals among other things. It really just feels very immature like trying to go back and watch ""Sesame Street"" in your thirties even though you don't have any kids.I mostly feel like the movie would've been stronger if it was entirely animated. While live-action gives the movie a more realistic and relatable quality, the subject matter felt better suited for animation and the short bits that were animated were easily some of the highlights. Obnoxious children are one of my pet peeves. That is one thing nobody should have to be forced to succumb to ever and this movie is just filled with nothing but that. Rowley (Robert Capron) wasn't, but he was also twice as immature as everyone else around him. Meanwhile Chloe Moretz was a welcome addition to the cast and seemed to be somewhat normal despite being an outcast, but her character was totally pointless. She works for the school newspaper and hangs out underneath bleachers. That's all she does. And all the while we're stuck listening to kids being called ""turd burglars"" and have to learn about the ""cheese touch."" Greg complains several times about the morons around him and it's nothing more than the pot calling the kettle black as Diary of a Wimpy Kid is fairly moronic the majority of the time.The entire first half of the wrestling scene seemed to be ripped straight from the W.T.F. episode of ""South Park."" They complained about the uniforms, were inspired by ""fake"" wrestling, and the coach even made a speech about REAL wrestling being better than ""fake"" wrestling. In a movie like this, that probably isn't a good thing having a PG-rated movie being compared to a TV-MA show since there's essentially no way one can live up to the other. It was kind of sad more than anything.The main thing that plagues Diary of a Wimpy Kid is that there doesn't really seem to be any sort of clear message the movie can really offer its audience. Should I ignore advice from my older brother? Not join any after school activity ever? Stand up for my friends? Do the right thing? Dance with my mom? Eat moldy cheese off the ground? Be proud of who I am and not change to fit in? All of these are glossed over, but never really fully developed.Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a cluttered family film. It feels like it's dumbed-down to appeal to a younger audience while the humor and storyline is ridiculously childlike and leaves no room for older individuals to jump on board. Its shades of nostalgia and small additions of animation are somewhat charming, but are incapable of saving the film from mostly being an exhaustive effort at entertainment.",2,A goofy movie with little purpose,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,4565,"['always', 'kind', 'awkward', 'going', 'movie', 'know', 'based', 'book', 'never', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'never', 'interested', 'Now', 'movie', 'buzz', 'beginning', 'pick', 'up', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'attraction', 'So', ""'re"", 'forced', 'see', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'convinced', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'like', 'going', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'Well', 'open', 'mind', 'good', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'things', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'aimed', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'shelved', 'somewhere', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'being', 'aimed', 'younger', 'audience.The', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'predictable', 'opening', 'kind', 'sets', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'also', 'giving', 'idea', 'hell', ""'re"", 'sit', 'nutshell', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'middle', 'school', 'pains', 'ups', 'downs', 'trying', 'blend', 'be', 'popular', 'dealing', 'outrageous', 'transition', 'elementary', 'middle', 'school', 'adult', 'middle', 'school', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'something', 'think', 'regularly', 'High', 'school', 'Yes', 'Middle', 'school', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'able', 'make', 'feel', 'little', 'nostalgic', 'middle', 'school', 'triggers', 'memories', 'similar', 'what', 'Greg', 'Heffley', 'Zachary', 'Gordon', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'School', 'obviously', 'going', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'life', 'right', 'school', 'activities', 'being', 'popular', 'attaining', 'class', 'favorite', 'moniker', 'yearbook', 'only', 'way', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'anywhere', 'world.But', 'slight', 'wave', 'nostalgia', ""n't"", 'really', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'incredibly', 'juvenile', 'be', 'expected', 'humor', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'come', 'off', 'most', 'dense', 'material', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'quite', 'time', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'getting', 'peed', 'boogers', 'hairy', 'moles', 'being', 'creeped', 'out', 'unusual', 'individuals', 'other', 'things', 'really', 'just', 'feels', 'very', 'immature', 'trying', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'thirties', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids.I', 'mostly', 'feel', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stronger', 'was', 'entirely', 'animated', 'live-action', 'movie', 'more', 'realistic', 'relatable', 'quality', 'subject', 'matter', 'felt', 'better', 'suited', 'animation', 'short', 'bits', 'were', 'animated', 'were', 'easily', 'highlights', 'Obnoxious', 'children', 'are', 'one', 'pet', 'peeves', 'one', 'thing', 'nobody', 'should', 'have', 'be', 'forced', 'succumb', 'ever', 'movie', 'just', 'filled', 'nothing', 'Rowley', 'Robert', 'Capron', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'also', 'twice', 'as', 'immature', 'everyone', 'else', 'Meanwhile', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'was', 'welcome', 'addition', 'cast', 'seemed', 'be', 'somewhat', 'normal', 'being', 'outcast', 'character', 'was', 'totally', 'pointless', 'school', 'newspaper', 'hangs', 'out', 'underneath', 'bleachers', 'while', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'listening', 'kids', 'being', 'called', 'turd', 'burglars', 'have', 'learn', 'cheese', 'touch', 'Greg', 'several', 'times', 'morons', 'nothing', 'more', 'pot', 'calling', 'kettle', 'black', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'fairly', 'moronic', 'majority', 'time.The', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'wrestling', 'scene', 'seemed', 'be', 'ripped', 'straight', 'W.T.F', 'episode', 'South', 'Park', 'complained', 'uniforms', 'were', 'inspired', 'fake', 'wrestling', 'coach', 'even', 'made', 'speech', 'REAL', 'wrestling', 'being', 'better', 'fake', 'wrestling', 'movie', 'probably', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'having', 'PG-rated', 'movie', 'being', 'compared', 'TV-MA', 'show', 'essentially', 'way', 'one', 'can', 'live', 'up', 'other', 'was', 'kind', 'sad', 'more', 'anything.The', 'main', 'thing', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'sort', 'clear', 'message', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'offer', 'audience', 'Should', 'ignore', 'advice', 'older', 'brother', 'Not', 'join', 'school', 'activity', 'ever', 'Stand', 'up', 'friends', 'Do', 'right', 'thing', 'Dance', 'mom', 'Eat', 'cheese', 'ground', 'Be', 'proud', 'who', 'am', 'not', 'change', 'fit', 'are', 'glossed', 'never', 'really', 'fully', 'developed.Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'cluttered', 'family', 'film', 'dumbed-down', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audience', 'humor', 'storyline', 'ridiculously', 'childlike', 'room', 'older', 'individuals', 'jump', 'board', 'shades', 'nostalgia', 'small', 'additions', 'animation', 'are', 'somewhat', 'charming', 'are', 'incapable', 'saving', 'film', 'mostly', 'being', 'exhaustive', 'effort', 'entertainment']",N/A

There is not a whole lot of ambiance for the film, but dialogue and music is crystal clear, no an immersive soundtrack but is appropriate for this type of film.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin.SPECIAL FEATURES""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" comes with the following special features:Feature Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Director Thor Freudenthal and writer Gabe Sachs.Deleted Diary Pages - A few short featurettes which include the short featurettes such as  Fregley's Scavenger Hunt (2:56) which grossed out my wife, Chirag's Trail of Tears (2:37) which shows locations of where he has been bullied, Fregley's Shuffle (:47) and the film's deleted scenes: Mom Drops Greg  Off at School, Greg and Rowley Jump Over the Wall, Mr. Winsky's Safety Patrol Assignment, Mom Suggests a Friendship Card, Greg Meets Fregley's mom, Greg has the Cheese Touch and there is also a gallery (which you need to use your remote) to view five of Rowley's Lost ""Zoo-Wee Mama"" cartoons.And Now a Word from Our Author - (3:39) Author Jeff Kinney talks with young actors Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron about the film.  This featurette is a Blu-ray exclusive.Theatrical TrailerEXTRAS:The version of ""Diary of Wimpy Kid"" that I am reviewing comes with a DVD and also a Digital Copy of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:As a parent of a child who is captivated with each yearly book release of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"", for years I have seen him laugh and reference the book (especially the ""cheese touch"") many times.  Even learning a few things from the book that we had to discipline him a few times.But for the most part, it's a book about the life of boys going into middle school and learning quickly about popularity and not wanting to be last in popularity. As much as we hope as parents that the experiences that we had back in school will no longer affect children these days, the fact is that it will continue to be a part of a student's life throughout grade school, even no matter what country you live in.  Children are faced with a lot of situations and some just don't want to be labeled unpopular or be mistreated by classmates.""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" is about a boy named Greg Heffley who desires to be popular but unfortunately, he is too fixated by it and each time he tries too achieve popularity, it backfires.But what happens when Greg tries to impose his wanting to be popular on his friend Rowley (who just cares about being friends with Greg and not too interested of being popular).While there is a lesson to be learned about Greg's attitude of wanting to be popular and even hurting his friendship with Rowley , I can understand the criticism by a few critics who have felt that the character of Greg Heffley is unpleasant.  And I have to agree.If I was a parent of Rowley and found out another child was making him change or to partake in things that they are not interested in, my advice would be to enjoy life the way you want and if that friend doesn't accept you, don't hang out with them.I have not read any of the ""Diary of the Wimpy Kid"" books but while I sat there watching alongside my wife and son, my wife would mutter ""that's not very nice!"" while my son, holding his first ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" book, was really getting into the film.  Even I found myself saying ""what a jerk!"" when it came to Greg's actions.But I suppose that is the case for not just Greg but a lot of people who try to change themselves to become popular.  Some are able to become athletes and discover their true potential, some exceed in other areas in school but some fail miserably.  Greg Heffley is the latter and has to learn through his experiences that he was not a good friend and he put his scheme of trying to be popular ahead of his own friendship with Rowley.  And there is a lesson to be learned with this film.I suppose that children who read the book will enjoy this film, while parents may feel ""why is there a film about a kid who is a bad influence?"" or maybe even remind them of the troubles of their own past in grade school.  Personally, I looked at the film as a good example of karma.  What goes around, comes around and in the case of Greg Heffley, he learns an important lesson that being a jerk is not cool!As for the Blu-ray release, you get an audio commentary, a few short featurettes including a disgusting featurette with the character of Fregley and deleted scenes.  And with this version that I am reviewing, the Blu-ray comes with a DVD and digital copy.  So, great for parents on a commute or wants to keep their children occupied with the film on their smartphone or tablet.Overall, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" is an enjoyable film but I do acknowledge some of the concerns that parents have towards the main protagonist and his actions.  My son felt this is one of the best movies he watched and for me, I felt the film carries a lot of humor but also an intriguing take of one child's worries of becoming popular or unpopular in middle school.  But also featuring an important message at the end of the film that I felt children could learn from.While some parents will be protective of their children and may not approve of the behavior of children as featured in this film, I do feel it's a family film that can encourage conversations between parents and their children but also a film that families can watch together.",4,"Diary of a

I have not read the books, so can't compare the movie to them, but both my husband and I did find this funny. As others have said, it centers on the nerdy protagonist Greg heading to middle school, and trying ploy after ploy to become popular. At first he does this alongside his even-nerdier best friend Rowley, but after betraying Rowley, Greg is on his own. He has to learn important lessons about friendship and loyalty, and so the movie has a good heart in the end.The portrayal of middle school here is pretty disturbing, as well as the cluelessness of the parents involved, and I worried about how it would impact my elementary school-aged kids, so I tried to talk about that and they all rolled their eyes and said ""Mom, it's just a movie."" They seemed to get that some of it was for comedic effect. There is also some bullying themes, and sexual innuendos (including Greg's older brother being caught with porn) that they didn't get, and I had to dance my way around a bit. But mostly I felt it was fine for elementary-aged children (every parent has to judge this for themselves of course.) The interactions between the kids feel real (for better or for worse), and my kids seemed to respond to that, and in the end the message is really about the importance of friendship. loyalty,  and being yourself, so that I could support.

And this movie paints that picture very well. I don't mean they dumbed it down. This movie was smart with a very good message: ""Never turn on your friends"". What I mean is it shows how kids worry about simpler things in middle school. And they are frequently hilarious, just like the entirety of this movie. Zachary Gordon did an A+ job as Greg.

I haven't been to a theater in ages to see a movie so....I wanted to see the Clash of the Titans remake, but I was a few days too early prior to its release. So it was between Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland sequel and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I picked Alice, but my two kids that are big fans of thebook seriesoutvoted me and picked Wimpy Kid.Ultimately my kids liked the movie and so did I. But there was something very familiar about the movie, and I've never even seen page 1 of any of the books. My kids both said that the familiarity came from how closely the movie followed the books...or should I say `book'. Because my oldest (age 11) said that almost the entire movie was from just the first book in the series (which I can neither confirm nor deny). But if my oldest is correct, this of course suggests a wide open door for sequels aplenty.But I've got a better idea than Wimpy Kid big screen sequels. How about a TV series? Ah...that's it! That's where the familiarity is for me! Diary of a Wimpy Kid reminds me of and is very similar to the Nickelodeon TV series that ran between 2004 and 2007 called Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide. Coincidentally(?), The Wimpy Kid book series picked up right as the Ned TV series came to an end in 2007.Both Ned's Declassified and Wimpy Kid follow the same story line: The ups & downs, the ins & outs, the trials & tribulations, and most importantly the rights and wrongs of making it through middle school and managing friendships therein.Of all the Nickelodeon shows that I've ever sat in for as my kids watched, I think that Ned was definitely the most educational, while at the same time being funny and entertaining. Wimpy Kid fits the exact same mold, but it's like trying to take a lot of Ned episodes and cram them all into one two-hour feature film.So my verdict would be to forgo the trip to the theater for Wimpy Kid and instead really get your money's worth by purchasingseason 1 of Nedfor many more hours of middle school entertainment. Wait for the Blu Ray/DVD or even cable release of Wimpy Kid. And if you run out of Ned's season 1 episodes prior to Wimpy Kid's DVD release, you can always go forseason 2 of Ned.",3,Ned's Declassified: The Motion Picture,1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,2357,"['wife', 'had', 'special', 'Girls', 'Night', 'Out', 'party', 'house', 'week', 'booted', 'kids', 'house', 'was', 'up', 'find', 'something', 'do', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'theater', 'ages', 'see', 'movie', 'so', '.I', 'wanted', 'see', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'remake', 'was', 'few', 'days', 'too', 'early', 'prior', 'release', 'was', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'sequel', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'picked', 'Alice', 'two', 'kids', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'thebook', 'seriesoutvoted', 'picked', 'Wimpy', 'Kid.Ultimately', 'kids', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'did', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'familiar', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'page', '1', 'books', 'kids', 'said', 'familiarity', 'came', 'how', 'closely', 'movie', 'followed', 'books', 'should', 'say', 'book', 'oldest', 'age', '11', 'said', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'can', 'neither', 'confirm', 'deny', 'oldest', 'correct', 'course', 'wide', 'open', 'door', 'sequels', 'aplenty.But', ""'ve"", 'got', 'better', 'idea', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'big', 'screen', 'sequels', 'How', 'TV', 'series', 'Ah', 'where', 'familiarity', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'very', 'similar', 'Nickelodeon', 'TV', 'series', 'ran', '2004', '2007', 'called', 'Ned', 'Declassified', 'School', 'Survival', 'Guide', 'Coincidentally', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'book', 'series', 'picked', 'up', 'right', 'Ned', 'TV', 'series', 'came', 'end', '2007.Both', 'Ned', 'Declassified', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'follow', 'same', 'story', 'line', 'ups', 'downs', 'ins', 'outs', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'most', 'importantly', 'rights', 'wrongs', 'making', 'middle', 'school', 'managing', 'friendships', 'Nickelodeon', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'sat', 'kids', 'watched', 'think', 'Ned', 'was', 'definitely', 'most', 'educational', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'exact', 'same', 'mold', 'trying', 'take', 'lot', 'Ned', 'episodes', 'cram', 'one', 'two-hour', 'feature', 'film.So', 'verdict', 'would', 'be', 'forgo', 'trip', 'theater', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'instead', 'really', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'purchasingseason', '1', 'Nedfor', 'many', 'more', 'hours', 'middle', 'school', 'entertainment', 'Wait', 'Blu', 'Ray/DVD', 'even', 'cable', 'release', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'run', 'Ned', 'season', '1', 'episodes', 'prior', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'DVD', 'release', 'can', 'always', 'go', 'forseason', '2', 'Ned']",N/A

He is a grown teenager, that is normal. And then to make him apologize to all the women as if he is disrespecting them, when they are the ones who star in the magazine, is completely absurd! That scene was not neccessary for a kids movie.Almost universally bad casting. The characters look nothing like as depicted in the book. Greg was all wrong.
