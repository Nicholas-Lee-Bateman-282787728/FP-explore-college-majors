Much respect to actor Mark Lassise who shoulders this film as Shiver's The Clown,one of the most visually frightning additions to the list of great horror villains. Although the film has its flaws it always seems to redeem itself with a brilliant horror sequence that makes you forget about any minor budget issues(like bad acting!). 'FEAR OF CLOWNS' is an excellent new horror film & Kevin Kangas is a Director that horror fans should watch out for!

Okay, I know B-movies can be fun, like Killer Klowns from Outer Space. But that movie was supposed to be silly. This film was trying to be scary!! What??!! I'm all for laughs with a good cheesy horror flick on a weekend but you have to draw the line somewhere. This was a waste of my time as well as the director and the dreadful actors. I hope I never see those people again in anything! I thought Shivers had potential but the whole concept was totally wasted. The storyline didn't make a lick of sense and nothing was believable or frightening at all. And how about that technicolor blood? I thought we've outgrown that since the 60's and 70's! There is nothing fun or scary about this piece of crap whatsoever, and it totally mocks what indie horror should be. Either you're a spoof or you're not. Make up your mind before you make it people! This is a huge let down! I dozed several times during it and prayed for it all to be over. Please ignore this when you stop by the video store. The case and all of it's 4 star ratings are deceiving.

She meets Rick Ganz (Life 101, Hunting Humans) at an art gallery and they hit it off nicely in which they become more and more closer to each other until she finds magazines in his place with articles on her and what not. Meanwhile a sadistic dude named Shivers The Clown played by Mark Lassise (Vampire Sisters, The Watcher) is after her killing people left and right, flexing his muscles whilst swinging his axe. It is an Indie Horror movie but it's bad. Sorry for the lame summary (forgot names) but still this movie is beyond boring.
