In this instance, the lack of details did help the movie in one instance: the lack of high tech jargon may have made it more accessible to people who aren't interested in it.

94278,A34PAZQ73SL163,0790730979,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[8, 15]","Disclosure is the first movie I remember questioning the monolithic ""men are a bunch of b-stards"" worldview which has been propagated by our media, our universities, and society as a whole since our institutions have been contaminated by the radicals of the 1960s. It also marked the first time that email was an intrinsic part of a storyline or that it was even used in film. Back in 1994, it must have appeared twice as cold and impersonal as it does today.The story's theme is foreshadowed by the words of a ""surplused"" or laid-off older worker  in the very beginning. Michael Douglas knows him from their joint commutes upon a Seattle ferry. He warns that ""we used to have fun with girls, now they want our jobs."" Soon after, we are introduced to Demi Moore's character, whose desire is exactly that. She alludes to the future when she sees Douglas waiting for the elevator and asks, ""Going down?"" He certainly is.The real landscape of Disclosure is not Seattle or the corporate world; the action takes place within society's battle of the sexes, a battle that never should have never been faught at all. There is no reason why relations between the sexes has to be cut-throat or adversarial. We were made to be complementary to another and that is how our interactions should have remained, yet the western world allowed some of the worst arguments about human behavior ever blathered to be accepted as the truth.Our courts, legislators, academics, and even Presidents have given recognition to bogus concepts like ""the patriarchy"" and that heterosexual intercourse demeans women. In fact, sex often achieves the exactly opposite result. It turns women into mothers who then perpetuate our species. The rise of womyns' studies programs and the legitimacy given to the hysterical denunciation of 49 percent of the population illustrates well the old saying that all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing, and that is precisely what the mass of men have done in regards to radical feminism. Instead of standing up for themselves and their brothers, they extended chivalry to those who were women in name only, and had no investment in the lives the majority of the earth's women live. To supine before those who desire your destruction is suicide, and the exploitation of men like the one played by Michael Douglas here will occur again and again until the ominous hate-spewed cloud of radical feminism is blown from our shores.God bless you, Michael Crichton and Barry Levinson for calling attention to this heinous state of affairs at such an early date.",5,The First Celluloid Attack on Political Correctness.,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2580,"['Disclosure', 'first', 'movie', 'remember', 'questioning', 'monolithic', 'men', 'are', 'bunch', 'b-stards', 'worldview', 'been', 'propagated', 'media', 'universities', 'society', 'whole', 'institutions', 'have', 'been', 'contaminated', 'radicals', '1960s', 'also', 'marked', 'first', 'time', 'email', 'was', 'intrinsic', 'part', 'storyline', 'was', 'even', 'used', 'film', 'Back', '1994', 'must', 'have', 'appeared', 'twice', 'cold', 'impersonal', 'today.The', 'story', 'theme', 'foreshadowed', 'words', 'surplused', 'laid-off', 'older', 'worker', 'very', 'beginning', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'joint', 'commutes', 'Seattle', 'ferry', 'used', 'have', 'fun', 'girls', 'now', 'want', 'jobs', 'Soon', 'are', 'introduced', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'desire', 'exactly', 'future', 'when', 'Douglas', 'waiting', 'elevator', 'asks', 'Going', 'down', 'certainly', 'is.The', 'real', 'landscape', 'Disclosure', 'not', 'Seattle', 'corporate', 'world', 'action', 'place', 'society', 'battle', 'sexes', 'battle', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'faught', 'reason', 'why', 'relations', 'sexes', 'be', 'cut-throat', 'adversarial', 'were', 'made', 'be', 'complementary', 'how', 'interactions', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'yet', 'western', 'world', 'allowed', 'worst', 'arguments', 'human', 'behavior', 'ever', 'blathered', 'be', 'accepted', 'truth.Our', 'courts', 'legislators', 'academics', 'even', 'Presidents', 'have', 'given', 'recognition', 'bogus', 'concepts', 'patriarchy', 'heterosexual', 'intercourse', 'demeans', 'women', 'fact', 'sex', 'often', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'result', 'women', 'mothers', 'who', 'then', 'perpetuate', 'species', 'rise', 'womyns', 'studies', 'programs', 'legitimacy', 'given', 'hysterical', 'denunciation', '49', 'percent', 'population', 'well', 'old', 'saying', 'evil', 'triumph', 'good', 'men', 'do', 'nothing', 'precisely', 'what', 'mass', 'men', 'have', 'done', 'regards', 'radical', 'feminism', 'Instead', 'standing', 'up', 'brothers', 'extended', 'chivalry', 'who', 'were', 'women', 'name', 'only', 'had', 'investment', 'lives', 'majority', 'earth', 'women', 'live', 'supine', 'who', 'desire', 'destruction', 'suicide', 'exploitation', 'men', 'one', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'here', 'will', 'occur', 'again', 'again', 'ominous', 'hate-spewed', 'cloud', 'radical', 'feminism', 'blown', 'shores.God', 'bless', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'calling', 'attention', 'heinous', 'state', 'affairs', 'early', 'date']",N/A

Demi Moore is Meridith, a former lover of Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas), and she is hot and hard. Willing to do whatever it takes to rise in the corporate chain, Meridith is named to a position making her Sanders' boss. She invites him to her office to, as she puts it, rehash old times and discuss the upcoming new ones. When he is there, she is extremely aggressive in pressing Sanders to have sex, until he finally tosses her off of him and quickly leaves. As he is walking out, she threatens to destroy his career for having turned her down.Sanders consults a lawyer about pursuing sexual harassment charges and this starts several rounds of ruthless corporate protectiveness. Sanders' company is in merger talks that will be worth hundreds of millions of dollars so the employees have a great deal at stake. Former friends become backstabbing opponents overnight and Sanders quickly becomes persona non grata, having all his executive privileges revoked. It is a dirty battle, but the company and Meredith make mistakes and Sanders is vindicated.As a computer science professor, I was enamored with the interface to the data storage system. It was a virtual reality interface where the person is in a simulated data storage area and can simulate the opening of drawers with the documents popping out on voice command.

94285,A2GYX971VETQBV,0790730979,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[3, 7]","I can still remember reading Michael Crichton's DISCLOSURE for the first time.  I was in the sixth grade and this novel completely caught me up in a world in which I didn't belong (and yet, strangely felt a part of).  I only recently watched the film version of the novel and I have to say I was sadly disappointed.  The topic of Crichton's novel is so rich: sexual harassment in the workplace.  It could have spawned a really interesting & intriguing thriller.  Instead, the movie gets caught up in Crichton's obsession with technology and computers.  Admittedly, these elements are in the novel (as they are in all of his books).  But, Crichton is generally able to place interesting characters into interesting situations.  The point of the story is to explore those characters and follow their development.  The technology, ideally, just serves to complicate matters and place our characters in ever unfamiliar and evolving territory, allowing their development to be interesting and complicated.DISCLOSURE, however, decides to focus more heavily on those technical aspects of Crichton's work, pushing the characters to the back burner and rendering the famous ""sex"" sequence the climax of the film (no pun intended).  It should not be the climax, but that is the impression the audience is left with.  For the rest of the movie, we are asked to jump through a whole bunch of hoops as a viewer, turning the interesting story of sexual harassment into a ""whodunit"" mystery in which we are trying to figure out the conspiracy behind the entire plot.  My only wish is that DISCLOSURE had decided to tackle its own issues along the way.Michael Douglas is perfectly cast in his role.  It seems that in most of his films, he plays men in unending pursuits of sexual pleasure.  (In fact, as an aside, I would have liked to have seen him in Tom Cruise's role in EYES WIDE SHUT.  He would have been perfect).  Demi Moore is sexy as ever and DISCLOSURE provides audiences with one more chance to see her assets-a chance she seems so willing to grant us in the 1990s that it must have been a conditional clause in her contract.  Despite her performance, however, there is something that doesn't quite fit.  Demi Moore is not the best choice to play Meredith, in my opinion.  There is just something about her that makes her ""smart & cunning"" female unconvincing.  Meredith is supposed to be a devil in disguise, yet a devil who is taken, in some respects, by Douglass's character.  But here, Moore seems to be playing a caricature instead of a complex human being.  Instead of garnering some sympathy from the audience, which she does in the novel, she becomes the convenient villain to be sacrificed by the deus ex machine ending.If you are a fan of Crichton's work or just want to see Demi Moore do her thing, you will probably get a kick out of DISCLOSURE.

94303,A1OBJ2263JCK5,0790730979,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[3, 3]","""Disclosure"" is a highly suspenseful, high-tech thriller, which tries to get us to think a little about office politics and the balance of power between the sexes in the workplace. In the film we meet Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas), who feels like he's on top of the world. He's head of manufacturing for a  high-tech, electronics corporation, which is about to be bought out in a merger. Everyone at the company with stock options is expecting to become very wealthy from the deal. On top of all this, Tom is fully expecting to be made head of the devision. Well, reality can sometimes be brutal. Tom dosn't get his promotion. Instead it goes to Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore) an attractive, female business executive (and an old flame of Tom's), who can help the company with the merger. At a late night meeting Meredith demands sex from Tom and practically rapes him in her office. To make matters worse, Meredith then goes and slaps Tom with a sexual harrassment suit. It becomes obvious to Tom, that Meredith and the big bosses in Corporate are plotting to get rid of him. He must use all his wits and skills to save both his job and reputation. This is suspenseful film in which Barry Levinson's direction and Paul Attanasio's taunt script (based on a Michael Crichton novel) leaves us on the edge of our seats. The film shows us how our hero is slowly being sacrificed by an almost mechanical use of office politics all in the name of the almighty dollar. The film also looks at the balance of power between the sexes. In the film we are told that sexual harrasment isn't about sex, but power. It puts forth some interesting questions about, what happens when sexual harrasment occurs, but it is the female, who is the agressor and the male is the victim. Does society hold a double standard? Does ""no"" mean no when a man says it. Do females, who hold power in the work place, have the same rights to abuse their power as their male counter parts? My favorite scene in the film is where in a legal mediation the Meredith character incredulously argues this very point as an excuse for her actions. The look exchanged between the mediator and the corporation's lawyer is priceless! Besides the wonderful direction and script, there is also a top notch cast. Michael Douglas gives a great proformance as the hard working manager, who suddenly finds his happy world turned upside down by office politics at their worst. Demi Moore is equally good as Meredith, a female corporate shark, who exudes both power and sex appeal at the the same time. Her two-faced lies and underhanded dealings are so well perpetuated, that she just is a villainess, that we love to hate! Donald Sutherland also gives a great performance as the slimey CEO of the company, who is really pulling all the strings in this drama. Finally, I want to mention Joseph Hodges' amazing set design for this movie. The ultra-modern office building, where most of the movie's action takes place is made of glass and steel, greatly contributing to an atmosphere of coldness and tension.

It's over long, convoluted, and there's too much jargon that a simple person like me won't understand. I seriously thought the film would be better, but it wasn't and I'm very disappointed. The only good point about it was Demi Moore's character. Michael Douglas? I don't see what the women see in him, but this was a great film for him, as if you go by what the press say about him, then he really is a sex addict!The film sticks closely to the book (what I can remember of it anyway) and is full of fancy 'new' technology, with mobiles like bricks etc, which really dates the film. It suffers from the same problem that The Net suffers from. There's no fear about Y2K now (can anyone remember what all the fuss was about?), and everyone has accepted new fangled technology into their lives. There are two main points I noticed between the book and the film: Tom's lawyer, Louise Fernandez, had more of an important role, but in the film she was reduced to a bit part; in the book, they talked about how Meredith Johnson got to where she was (an important key), but in the movie, they left most of that out.There's a sex scene included in this, which was the worst sex scene I've ever seen. From what it sounds like, Meredith & Tom were in a very passionate, intense, highly sexual relationship years ago, but when they meet again, and she 'seduces' him, there's just nothing there. Even she doesn't try very hard. There's no passion there, and it just makes cringe-worthy viewing. There's no feeling of ever having loved someone, or feeling safe in their arms, or wanting to look into their eyes. This whole scene is just like rape (which it basically comes down): cold, hard, sex.The thing I loved about this movie was the way Meredith's character changed image-wise. Before she seduced Tom, it was all low cut, short skirts powersuits, lacy black bra etc. After she accuses him of sexually harrassing her, it's all very prim and proper, with the neck of her suit practically choking her.This really isn't a movie worth bothering with, and neither is the book.

Douglas is perfectly cast in the role of a man who refuses to be victimized by his female boss.

94320,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0790730979,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 6]","Michael Douglas and Demi Moore fight the battle of the sexes in the film version of Michael Crichton's novel ""Disclosure"".  A rising star at one of those Seattle firms that churns out consumer high-tech, Tom Sanders (Douglas) finds his career at stake instead.  Losing his promotion to Meredith Johnson (Moore), who knows less about high-tech than sleeping her way to an exec position, Sanders tries to make the best of things.  This is complicated by three things - Sanders's division is having problems delivering a line of new CD-ROM players, his company is in the formative stages of a crucial merger and Johnson has set her sights on him....for something.  Sanders and Johnson had had an affair some time before, and Johnson's predatory habits give a not-so-subtle hint as to what that must have been like.  When Sanders - now a family man - resists, Johnson turns the tables on him, accusing him of sexual harassment.Director Barry Levinson wisely underplays the controversial aspects of the book.  (Despite Crichton's sincere belief that he was taking on a PC establishment that refuses to see women in terms other than victims of aggressive white males, the corporate intrigue aspect of the story undermines this - Sanders's victimization stemmed largely from forces that wanted Johnson to oust Sanders.  This is a common occurrence in Crichton's polemical novels where the author rails at forces like PC or media manipulation when some undrlying cloak and dagger is the real culprit.)  Those who shun Sanders after Johnson's accusations become known are reacting less to PC angst than a fear for their careers.  Instead, Levinson plays up The ""man against the conspiracy"" angle - with Douglas playing detective, sneaking into computer files, pulling out answering machine messages and tracking down any leads.  Much of the suspense is artificial, but it works.",4,Not the anti-PC book that Crichton wrote.....luckily,1012348800,"01 30, 2002",2002,1869,"['Michael', 'Douglas', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'fight', 'battle', 'sexes', 'film', 'version', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'novel', 'Disclosure', 'rising', 'star', 'one', 'Seattle', 'firms', 'out', 'consumer', 'high-tech', 'Tom', 'Sanders', 'Douglas', 'career', 'stake', 'instead', 'Losing', 'promotion', 'Meredith', 'Johnson', 'Moore', 'who', 'less', 'high-tech', 'sleeping', 'way', 'exec', 'position', 'Sanders', 'make', 'best', 'things', 'complicated', 'three', 'things', 'Sanders', 'division', 'having', 'problems', 'delivering', 'line', 'new', 'CD-ROM', 'players', 'company', 'formative', 'stages', 'crucial', 'merger', 'Johnson', 'set', 'sights', '.for', 'something', 'Sanders', 'Johnson', 'had', 'had', 'affair', 'time', 'Johnson', 'predatory', 'habits', 'give', 'not-so-subtle', 'hint', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'When', 'Sanders', 'now', 'family', 'man', 'resists', 'Johnson', 'tables', 'accusing', 'sexual', 'harassment.Director', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'wisely', 'controversial', 'aspects', 'book', 'Crichton', 'sincere', 'belief', 'was', 'taking', 'PC', 'establishment', 'see', 'women', 'terms', 'other', 'victims', 'aggressive', 'white', 'males', 'corporate', 'intrigue', 'aspect', 'story', 'Sanders', 'victimization', 'stemmed', 'largely', 'forces', 'wanted', 'Johnson', 'oust', 'Sanders', 'common', 'occurrence', 'Crichton', 'polemical', 'novels', 'where', 'author', 'forces', 'PC', 'media', 'manipulation', 'when', 'undrlying', 'cloak', 'dagger', 'real', 'culprit', 'who', 'shun', 'Sanders', 'Johnson', 'accusations', 'become', 'known', 'are', 'reacting', 'less', 'PC', 'angst', 'fear', 'careers', 'Instead', 'Levinson', 'up', 'man', 'conspiracy', 'angle', 'Douglas', 'playing', 'detective', 'sneaking', 'computer', 'files', 'pulling', 'out', 'answering', 'machine', 'messages', 'tracking', 'down', 'leads', 'Much', 'suspense', 'artificial']",N/A

Haines,"[2, 8]","The clawing of women into positions of corporate power was supposed to  bring a new era of &quot;humanity&quot; and softness into the business scene.  This  film demonstrates what a false promise that was, on the assumption  anyone believed it.  The struggle to gain positions at the narrow end of the  corporate pyramid grows more intense the higher the role.  And Vice  Presidents are pretty near the top.  Demi Moore usurps Michael Douglas  for one of these niches, but her victory tastes bitter-sweet since they were  once intense lovers.  Now he's contentedly married, a parent, and well  settled in his mid-level position.Once that scenario is established, the film takes some bizarre twists.  One  her first day in the new role, Moore decides to seduce Douglas.  While the  idea of reversing sexual harassment roles is intruiging, here it seems more  than a little contrived.  It's far too sudden; we could have done with a little  build-up.  Especially given the duration of the seduction in the film.  Nor is  there any real motivation given for Moore's action.  Is it revenge for  leaving her [we don't know that happened]?  Jealousy for Douglas' wife?  Whatever the cause, it's implausible that a climbing corporate woman  would put so much at risk through such a blatant act.Once the failed encounter is past, we're subjected to the sordid &quot;disclosure&quot;  of the event and its ramifications on other lives through the remainder of  the film.  Harassment hearings are never charming affairs, with contestents  and their advocates striving to make each other look bad and succeeding  long before any resolution is achieved.  Although nobody in this film  shines in performance, Roma Maffia almost walks with it as Douglas'  lawyer.  Even Donald Sutherland's role, which could also have been  enhanced, is made too superficial to give him breathing room.  It's  inspiring to see this issue raised, it needs more exposure.  Unfortunately,  this isn't the film to make it happen.",3,Is this early backlash?,982454400,"02 18, 2001",2001,1994,"['clawing', 'women', 'positions', 'corporate', 'power', 'was', 'supposed', 'bring', 'new', 'era', 'quot', 'humanity', 'quot', 'softness', 'business', 'scene', 'film', 'what', 'false', 'promise', 'was', 'assumption', 'anyone', 'believed', 'struggle', 'gain', 'positions', 'narrow', 'end', 'corporate', 'pyramid', 'more', 'intense', 'higher', 'role', 'Vice', 'Presidents', 'are', 'pretty', 'top', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'usurps', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'one', 'niches', 'victory', 'bitter-sweet', 'were', 'once', 'intense', 'lovers', 'Now', 'contentedly', 'married', 'parent', 'well', 'settled', 'mid-level', 'position.Once', 'scenario', 'established', 'film', 'bizarre', 'twists', 'One', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'role', 'Moore', 'seduce', 'Douglas', 'idea', 'reversing', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'roles', 'intruiging', 'here', 'more', 'little', 'contrived', 'far', 'too', 'sudden', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'build-up', 'Especially', 'given', 'duration', 'seduction', 'film', 'there', 'real', 'motivation', 'given', 'Moore', 'action', 'revenge', 'leaving', '[', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'happened', ']', 'Jealousy', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'cause', 'implausible', 'climbing', 'corporate', 'woman', 'would', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'risk', 'blatant', 'act.Once', 'failed', 'encounter', 'past', ""'re"", 'subjected', 'sordid', 'quot', 'disclosure', 'quot', 'event', 'ramifications', 'other', 'lives', 'remainder', 'film', 'Harassment', 'hearings', 'are', 'never', 'charming', 'affairs', 'contestents', 'advocates', 'striving', 'make', 'other', 'look', 'bad', 'succeeding', 'long', 'resolution', 'achieved', 'nobody', 'film', 'shines', 'performance', 'Roma', 'Maffia', 'almost', 'Douglas', 'lawyer', 'Even', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'role', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'enhanced', 'made', 'too', 'superficial', 'give', 'breathing', 'room', 'inspiring', 'see', 'issue', 'raised', 'more', 'exposure', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'film', 'make', 'happen']",N/A

Now the thing about Disclosure that will keep you watching is not just the tension between those two characters. You will know who from the two is right, you will know who is wrong, but it are the people around them who are making it difficult: they don't know who did it which leads to nice thrilling situations.The casting of Disclosure is perfectly alright: Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as Tom Sanders and acts very good and believable. He shows us how a man in his situation feels very clearly and does that well-acted.Demi Moore is maqnificent as the bad guy, or I mean Bad girl in this motion picture. She acts on a certain way that will make you know how dangerous the woman is she is playing, which is superb.Even though Disclosure is not a Thriller with gunshooting, running and high speed pursuits, it fits perfectly allright next to those kind of Thrillers. Disclosure is at first a kind of sexual thriller with a highly erotic scene, but then goes to the level where it gets labeld a kind of office/court thriller. But don't worry, for the biggest part the film may take place in an office: it will put you at the end of your seat at some suspencefull moments.It is greatly shot, professionally made, well-directed and has performances that are perfectly alright. The story is written by and based on the novel by Michael Crichton. He knows how to write those kind of thrilling stories as we all know, but some things you just see coming in this film. That is too bad, but still, you have to expect some of the unexpected, cause that will be present to.Conclusion: Disclosure is a nice, well made, erotic and tensefull Thriller which also has some good dramatic moments. Recommended to Thriller fans, Demi Moore fans, Michael Douglas fans and to anyone else who wants to see a thriller where the situations get hot and out of hand.Like the tagline of the film says: sex is power.

There are no car chases, explosions or fistfights, in fact no violence at all unless you count a woman's attempt to rape a man. After initial surprise, the hero's wife actually supports her husband (a movie first?) And at a sedate staff meeting (an unlikely climax), the good guy wins using superior intelligence instead of force. Not many movies go against the grain of the genre and remain as thrilling as this one.Like the Michael Crichton novel, ""Disclosure"" reverses even the sexual harrassment. A man (Michael Douglas) is the victim of a woman (Demi Moore) who has become his boss at a computer company. It's a provocative premise if you don't examine her motives as closely as Crichton's book did. Like the seductresses in ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Fatal Attraction,"" Moore wants his body, then his life. Because he plays this role so often and so well, Douglas has become typecast as a sexual object. I guess there are worse fates awaiting actors his age.With the exception of Moore, who is much too obvious, it has  excellent actors, among them Donald Sutherland and Dennis Miller (in hs pre-comic days.) It takes full advantage of the Seattle settings and a multi-level office complex of steel, glass and stairs that workers might well cross a picket line to enter.
