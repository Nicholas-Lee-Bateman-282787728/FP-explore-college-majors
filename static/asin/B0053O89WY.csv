Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","THE BIG BANG THEORY was a failed pilot until creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady re-wrote the script to take advantage of the chemistry between lead actors Jim Parsons and Johnny Galecki. The series went on the air in 2007 and quickly became a national favorite. Most comedies traffic in stereotypes and this series is no different, centering on a group of socially inept geniuses who run afoul of the pretty but intellectually average girl who lives across the hall--but the fun of the series is in the way it undercuts the stereotypes, giving us glimpses of humor and humanity in unexpected and often laugh-out-loud ways.The first season was a little ify, with writers and actors working to set the characters and their various storylines; the fifty season was also a little ify, as the series struggled to accomodate new characters.  But the fifth season nails everything down perfectly, continuing to focus on Leonard (Johnny Galecki) as he struggles to maintain a long distance romance with Pryia (Aarti Mann) while still coping with his affection for Penny (Kaley Couco)--and swerves brilliantly into the evolving relationship between Sheldon and Amy (Jim Parsons and Mayim Bialik) and the impending nuptuals of Howard and Bernadette (Simon Helberg and Melissa Rauch.)  In the meantime, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) struggles to find a girlfriend of his own, which leads to comic disaster.As usual, each episode is wickedly, wildly funny.  My own favorite, however, is ""The Infestation Hypothesis,"" in which Penny horrifies germaphobe Sheldon by rescuing a seemingly attractive chair from the street.  In any case, this is THE BIG BANG THEORY at top form, and very, very funny.

Sure there's always something happening... yet it feels like certain elements have gotten stagnant. Like how in 90% of this season, Sheldon is still the epitome of cold scientific condescenscion. Only a couple of times (towards the end) does his character actually show any genuine humane side. Otherwise, he's mostly a total jerk or his condescenscion seems to be a set-up for someone else's joke (which, more often than not, actually does seem good).With the setting up Howard with his fiancee, Beatrice, for their wedding, there's always (as normal) mixups, misdirections, and misadventures. And some of them turn out to be better than others.It's toward the end of this season that's got me at a personal dilemma.

1439150,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B0053O89WY,"JJD ""John""","[5, 8]","I remember September 2007 being a great month for geek culture on TV. It saw the inception of shows such as &#34;Chuck&#34;, &#34;Reaper&#34; (an ill fated show simply because the CW didn't know what to do with it), and a hillarious little sitcom about two insufferable nerds whose lives are upheaved when a simple, yet incredibly vivacious gal from the midwest moves across the hall. In subsequent seasons, they managed to keep the geek-centric formula firmly in place, yet allowing the characters to grow.Fast forward to 2011/2012 which brought us a fifth season, and it barely resembles it's first four seasons. While there are a few classic moments here, it just isn't nearly what it once was. There are dozens of bawdy sitcoms riddling the airwaves these days. Most of which have no heart or inventive writing. It would seem to me that this show seems to be moving in that direction. Virtually gone are the inside physics jokes, nods to geek culture (comics, movies, video games) and in their place are the kind of plotlines and character development one would associate with shows like &#34;Two And A Half Men&#34;. Characters like Amy (while amusing when initially introduced) have gone completely off the reservation into the realm of...well...creepy. What should have been a great recurring character has completely overstayed her welcome and has become the albatross to a show once sailing with agreeable wind and blue skies. Bernadette is yet another character that has overstayed her welcome. No matter how you sell it, I just can't buy Wolowitz's capacity to keep a girl like Bernadette and the longer he does...the less I buy it. Raj's quasi homosexual tendencies, while charming and inventive at first, have become old hat and are, well, rather dull. They really seem to have lost their grip on how to write Raj this season.Leonard's prowess when it comes to the opposite sex has also taken a quantum leap into the realm of the absurd. Between Raj's incredibly gorgeous sister and his little run in with a very sexy comic book fan, I have to wonder how and when Leonard got all this &#34;game&#34;! The Penny attraction, I get. He's basically the sweet guy next door in a world of men that have treated her badly (as she's constantly attracted to the worst sort of men there are). Now we are expected to believe that, as of season five, his awkwardness has all but gone and he's able to attract such INCREDIBLY beautiful women that would be (in reality) WAY out of his league. He's not a bad looking guy...but come on!!What used to be something I looked forward to every week has become that kind of show that is easily dismissable.Such a shame, because this was once one of the most inventive and original shows on the airwaves.",2,"...And so the ""shark jumping"" begins.",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,2744,"['remember', 'September', '2007', 'being', 'great', 'month', 'geek', 'culture', 'TV', 'saw', 'inception', 'shows', 'such', '34', 'Chuck', '34', '34', 'Reaper', '34', 'ill', 'fated', 'show', 'simply', 'CW', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'hillarious', 'little', 'sitcom', 'two', 'insufferable', 'nerds', 'lives', 'are', 'upheaved', 'when', 'simple', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'vivacious', 'gal', 'midwest', 'hall', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'managed', 'keep', 'geek-centric', 'formula', 'firmly', 'place', 'yet', 'allowing', 'characters', 'grow.Fast', 'forward', '2011/2012', 'brought', 'fifth', 'season', 'barely', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'are', 'few', 'classic', 'moments', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'are', 'dozens', 'bawdy', 'sitcoms', 'riddling', 'airwaves', 'days', 'Most', 'have', 'heart', 'inventive', 'writing', 'would', 'seem', 'show', 'be', 'moving', 'direction', 'Virtually', 'gone', 'are', 'inside', 'physics', 'jokes', 'nods', 'geek', 'culture', 'comics', 'movies', 'video', 'games', 'place', 'are', 'kind', 'plotlines', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'would', 'associate', 'shows', '34', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', '34', 'Characters', 'Amy', 'amusing', 'when', 'initially', 'introduced', 'have', 'gone', 'completely', 'reservation', 'realm', 'well', 'creepy', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'recurring', 'character', 'completely', 'overstayed', 'welcome', 'become', 'albatross', 'show', 'once', 'sailing', 'agreeable', 'wind', 'blue', 'skies', 'Bernadette', 'yet', 'character', 'overstayed', 'welcome', 'matter', 'how', 'sell', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Wolowitz', 'capacity', 'keep', 'girl', 'Bernadette', 'longer', 'less', 'buy', 'Raj', 'quasi', 'homosexual', 'tendencies', 'charming', 'inventive', 'first', 'have', 'become', 'old', 'hat', 'are', 'well', 'rather', 'dull', 'really', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'grip', 'how', 'write', 'Raj', 'season.Leonard', 'prowess', 'when', 'opposite', 'sex', 'also', 'taken', 'quantum', 'leap', 'realm', 'absurd', 'Between', 'Raj', 'incredibly', 'gorgeous', 'sister', 'little', 'run', 'very', 'sexy', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'when', 'Leonard', 'got', '34', 'game', '34', 'Penny', 'attraction', 'get', 'basically', 'sweet', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'world', 'men', 'have', 'treated', 'badly', 'constantly', 'attracted', 'worst', 'sort', 'men', 'are', 'Now', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'season', 'five', 'awkwardness', 'gone', 'able', 'attract', 'such', 'INCREDIBLY', 'beautiful', 'women', 'would', 'be', 'reality', 'league', 'not', 'bad', 'looking', 'guy', 'come', 'What', 'used', 'be', 'something', 'looked', 'forward', 'week', 'become', 'kind', 'show', 'easily', 'dismissable.Such', 'shame', 'was', 'once', 'one', 'most', 'inventive', 'original', 'shows', 'airwaves']",Big Bang Theory:S5 (DVD)

Sometimes the story lines aren't as good as they could be, but overall it's one of my favorite tv shows. One of the things I like the best about the show is that the characters all care about each other. They may get irritated with each other and have arguments, but there's no outright nastiness or mean-spiritedness on the show. That's refreshing when so many comedies rely on nasty comments and humiliation of characters to get laughs. Jim Parsons' character (Sheldon Cooper) is as delightful as he is annoying. I enjoy watching Sheldon develop as a character. Really, they all do and it's good to see. Too many shows lack character development and get stuck in a rut. BBT does not.

And it looks like there are a fair number of ""bonus features"" on the set. So, yay for that!

If movies & TV start getting released this way, either Blu+DVD+UV (preferred, if cost is equivalent) or Blu+ UV, I can tell I'll be buying a lot more. It just makes good economic sense. Kind of a 3-fer.I like this kind of release and hope more studios get on board with it. I'll probably slant my buying habits toward this kind of release over releases that are ONLY one or the other, or barebones releases, etc. So, make it happen. Of course, in a decade, everything will probably be all-digital. But, until then. The combo pack + UV approach seems like the best of all worlds.So far, it looks like only season 1, 2, & 5 of Big Bang Theory have been released this way, but not yet 3 & 4? *Sad panda.* Guess I'll hold off on season 3 & 4 until they get re-released under the new scheme.

Started watching it when the repeats started airing in 2011.  My favorite episode is in season 4 what I call ""the Raiders"" episode.The 5th season is good, but NOT nearly the best.  I consider the 4th season the best.As a ""Star Wars"" & ""Indiana Jones"" fan I want to know why not one actor from any of those films have been on.2 favorite episodes in season 5:  episode 19 ""The Weekend Vortex"" & 20 ""The Transporter Malfunction"".Now, I am going to stick up for ""Star Trek"" fans here.  Episode 5 ""The Russian Rocket Reaction"" is another Wil Wheaton episode BUT the blu ray/DVD package does not mention Brent Spiner.  And, of course episode 20.  Leonard Nimoy has been mentioned in more than one episode in the series, my favorite when Penny gives Sheldon the autographed napkin.  So, having him do the voice of the ""Spock"" action figure was great.  BUT, he got NO MENTION in the credits or the blu ray/DVD episode list like Spiner.I did feel the season finale about the wedding was a let down.  You normally get surprises in finales & season openers, so episode 1 of season 6 should be fantastic to make up for the ""no surprises"" season 5 finale.Normal, good extras in the packages.You have 2 blu ray disc & 3 DVD disc in this.Looking forward to season 6.",4,Good but not the best season Normal good extras,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,1325,"['Star', 'Wars', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'fan', 'was', 'late', 'bloomer', 'show', 'Started', 'watching', 'when', 'repeats', 'started', 'airing', '2011', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', '4', 'what', 'call', 'Raiders', '5th', 'season', 'good', 'NOT', 'nearly', 'best', 'consider', '4th', 'season', 'best.As', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'fan', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'actor', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'on.2', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', '5', 'episode', '19', 'Weekend', 'Vortex', '20', 'Transporter', 'Malfunction', '.Now', 'am', 'going', 'stick', 'up', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'here', 'Episode', '5', 'Russian', 'Rocket', 'Reaction', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'episode', 'BUT', 'blu', 'ray/DVD', 'package', 'not', 'mention', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'course', 'episode', '20', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'been', 'mentioned', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'series', 'favorite', 'when', 'Penny', 'Sheldon', 'autographed', 'napkin', 'So', 'having', 'do', 'voice', 'Spock', 'action', 'figure', 'was', 'great', 'BUT', 'got', 'MENTION', 'credits', 'blu', 'ray/DVD', 'episode', 'list', 'Spiner.I', 'did', 'feel', 'season', 'finale', 'wedding', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'normally', 'get', 'surprises', 'finales', 'season', 'openers', 'so', 'episode', '1', 'season', '6', 'should', 'be', 'fantastic', 'make', 'up', 'surprises', 'season', '5', 'finale.Normal', 'good', 'extras', 'packages.You', 'have', '2', 'blu', 'ray', 'disc', '3', 'DVD', 'disc', 'this.Looking', 'forward', 'season', '6']",Big Bang Theory:S5 (DVD)

1439230,A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B0053O89WY,NeuroSplicer,"[227, 282]","In the cult tradition of SPARTACUS, the halls of every science department now echoes: ""I AM SHELDON""!Currently into its fifth season, THE BIG BANG THEORY proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. Even if the show seems to have slowed down form its initial explosive impetus, I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is **consistently** brilliant!Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.His equally super-intelligent (yet sexually confused girlfriend), Amy Farrah Fowler, (which Sheldon finally claimed) received a far more enlarged role this fifth season. However, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to ""help"" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.Leonard tried his hand in a long-distance relationship this season with his friend Raj's sister, Priya, but he seems to be gravitating back towards Penny once more.Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer (whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution), he also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.Howard used to be the show-stealer. Whenever he entered the scene you just knew he would offer such an outrageous perceptive that would render you speechless. Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by his fianc&eacute;e, Bernadette, who is very likeable, but also is cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the ""poor Indian"" defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley. His character, even in the fifth season, remains underdeveloped.Then there is Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.One of the best fifth season moments: slipping in the ""Who is the greatest?"" cheer between Sheldon's patented knock of repeated ""Penny!"".The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,THE UNIVERSE IS STARTING TO CONDENSE,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,4180,"['cult', 'tradition', 'SPARTACUS', 'halls', 'science', 'department', 'now', 'AM', 'SHELDON', 'Currently', 'fifth', 'season', 'THE', 'BIG', 'BANG', 'THEORY', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'funny', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'aired', 'Even', 'show', 'have', 'slowed', 'down', 'form', 'initial', 'explosive', 'impetus', 'had', 'not', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'hard', 'ever', 'best', 'days', 'FRASIER', 'SEINFELD', 'BIG', 'BANG', '**consistently**', 'brilliant', 'Sheldon', 'Cooper', 'unavoidably', 'king', 'show', 'massive', 'black', 'hole', 'Universe', 'will', 'child', 'prodigy', 'now', '24', 'years', 'old', 'theoretical', 'physicist', 'PhD', 'absolutely', 'social', 'skills', 'known', 'sexual', 'drive', 'Sheldon', 'may', 'be', 'verge', 'unifying', 'fields', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'car', 'save', 'life', 'break', 'smile', 'even', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'mere', 'homo', 'sapiens.His', 'equally', 'super-intelligent', 'yet', 'sexually', 'confused', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Farrah', 'Fowler', 'Sheldon', 'finally', 'claimed', 'received', 'far', 'more', 'enlarged', 'role', 'fifth', 'season', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'addition', 'show', 'character', 'only', 'blur', 'focus', 'form', 'Sheldon', 'only', 'room', 'one', 'idiosyncratic', 'genius', 'number', 'comically', 'charged', 'situations', 'gum', 'up', 'show', 'flow.Leonard', 'Hofstadter', 'Sheldon', 'roommate', 'primary', 'keeper', 'experimental', 'physicist', 'who', 'Sheldon', 'help', 'steering', 'towards', 'teaching', 'career', 'Sheldon', 'idiosyncrasies', 'personal', 'neurosis', 'not', 'mention', 'crush', 'neighbor', 'Penny', 'Which', 'crush', 'lunar', 'eclipses', 'follow', 'predicted', 'yet', 'unavoidable', 'periodicity.Leonard', 'tried', 'hand', 'long-distance', 'relationship', 'season', 'friend', 'Raj', 'sister', 'Priya', 'be', 'gravitating', 'back', 'towards', 'Penny', 'once', 'more.Howard', 'Wolowitz', 'only', 'one', 'PhD', 'Sheldon', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'forget', 'engineer', 'crowning', 'achievements', 'were', 'mechanized', 'arm', 'used', 'space', 'shuttle', 'liquid', 'waste', 'management', 'solution', 'also', 'managed', 'wreck', 'Mars', 'Rover', 'hopes', 'landing', 'girl', 'made', 'sure', 'one', 'can', 'prove', 'anything', 'fact', 'short', 'man', 'severely', 'outdated', 'misguided', 'sense', 'fashion', 'still', 'mother', 'using', 'collection', 'pickup', 'lines', 'straight', 'men', 'magazines', 'advice', 'columns', 'yet', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'just', 'hilarious.Howard', 'used', 'be', 'show-stealer', 'Whenever', 'entered', 'scene', 'just', 'knew', 'would', 'offer', 'such', 'outrageous', 'perceptive', 'would', 'render', 'speechless', 'Now', 'only', 'Howard', 'character', 'was', 'allowed', 'continue', 'stellar', 'trajectory', 'been', 'weighted', 'down', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Bernadette', 'who', 'very', 'likeable', 'also', 'cramping', 'style', 'Not', 'mention', 'slowly', 'yet', 'inescapably', 'turning', 'scary', 'mother.Rajesh', 'Koothrappali', 'particle', 'astrophysicist', 'fashion', 'sense', 'close', 'absolute', 'zero', 'severe', 'case', 'shyness', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'front', 'women', 'inebriated', 'using', 'poor', 'Indian', 'defense', 'father', 'rich', 'doctor', 'who', 'Bentley', 'character', 'even', 'fifth', 'season', 'underdeveloped.Then', 'Penny', 'proverbial', 'good', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'came', 'California', 'stardom', 'aspirations', 'so', 'far', 'waitress', 'sequence', 'bad', 'boyfriends', 'Sheldon', 'fact', 'calculated', 'exact', 'number', 'extrapolated', 'bell-curve', 'started', '14', 'obviously', 'neighbors.One', 'best', 'fifth', 'season', 'moments', 'slipping', 'Who', 'greatest', 'cheer', 'Sheldon', 'patented', 'knock', 'repeated', 'Penny', '.The', 'show', 'unavoidably', 'use', 'previous', 'sitcom', 'combinations', 'odd', 'couple', 'unfulfilled', 'love-interest', 'mismatch', 'even', 'one', 'discern', 'are', 'used', 'such', 'fresh', 'manner', 'left', 'great', 'entertainment', 'way', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'own', 'DVD', 'writing', 'so', 'smart', 'jokes', 'fly', 'so', 'fast', 'many', 'non-verbal', 'just', 'way', 'savor', 'weekly', 'air', 'time', 'Well', 'may', 'be', 'Sheldon', 'could', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'can', 'compare', 'intellect', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",Big Bang Theory:S5 (DVD)

1439246,A194GQYVY9HXUP,B0053O89WY,Ray-Review,"[9, 16]","Over the past 2 years I have loved The Big Bang Theory, I currently own seasons 1-4 on DVD which were great (season 4 has its problems) but I have followed the show since I began watching it. Seasons 1-3 were probably one of the funniest episodes of the Big Bang Theory because the jokes were fresh, the characters were great the writing was clever and overall the show was original. I loved the dynamics of all the characters of these grown nerds that are intellectually gifted but socially disabled associating themeselves with a normal beautiful girl that is struggling to get by. What made the show so great in the first place was that it showed how opposites attract, a group of ""nerds"" are able to co-exist with a beautiful girl that under any other circumstance would have nothing to do with these kind of guys. I loved the show up until season 4, the formula that made it great, just took a dramatic shift, all of the characters changed with a couple of exceptions. The addition of Amy and Bernadette was okay in the beginning, mainly because it gave the characters of Sheldon and Howard more humanity having relations with a female comapanion which was a nice balance to the Leonard/Penny dynamic. I actually liked Amy and Bernadette in the beginnig, Amy is a female Sheldon which is a nice twist, and Bernadette is a sexy petite woman whose appeal is her bubbly personality. But once these female character became a part of the permanent cast, it turned out to be the biggest downfall to the show as a wholeWhen I was watching season 5's episodes, I just realized that we barely have moments where it's just the 4 guys (Sheldon/Leonard/Howard/Raj). Thats what annoyed me the most because the female dynamics were added to evolve the characters, but what it did was actually kill their personalities. Howard's charm completely dissolved this season, because his character has changed from the guy that hit on every woman possible, to being stuck to one woman which is Bernadette (I can't blame him though). Ultimately Howards character just isn't funny to me anymore, he may have his moments but his characters runs dry for me. Amy's character is also another character I have a problem with. In the beginning she is introduced as the female Sheldon, a genius whose wit and misunderstanding of human behavior matches Sheldon perfectly, but in this season, she is just the most annoying character in the show, I'm sorry to all the Amy fans but she gets on my last nerves. She tries too hard to fit in to the point that I don't even feel sorry that she is incapable of doing so, she has a relationship with Sheldon however she has an ambiguous fatal attraction towards Penny that was funny in Season 4, but now is just creepy. There is practially no bromance of Howard and Raj anymore which is what I actually missed the most, I missed the interactions between them which is almost non-existant in this season. Raj is also a character that is underused in the series, and ever since the arrival of Bernadette and Amy, his character in the show has bcome useless.Sheldon is my personal favorite since the beginning seasons. Jim Parson's ability to recite extremely long dialogues with such agility and comedic timing is a true talent. His personality was a fresh of breath air when the show began, but something just clicked in my head that changed my perception of Sheldon's character this season. Sheldon was always known as the repulsive character whose too smart for his own good, which hasn't changed in Season 5, and that is precisely the problem. I guess after 4 seasons of Sheldon, I have met my ends meet with the character at this point. You would think Sheldon would have progressed and adjusted a little bit after having a girlfriend and befriending Penny for awhile now, but thats just not the case and I think thats the most frustrating thing. After watching this season, I think I am now fed up with the show, there's just nothing original or exciting about the show anymore. Sure it has it's funny moments here and there but it just wasn't what it used to be. I can tell that some of the storylines are forced and the writing has become stale. And maybe its just me, but I even noticed that some of the actors are starting to look disinterested during the show especially Johnny Galecki (Leonard), he's not as energetic as he used to be and his delivery lacks the urgency he once had in earlier seasons. The Big Bang Theory was once my favorite show, but I guess I have outgrowned it. If you're still a fan of the Big Bang Theory then by all means pick this DVD up, but as for me I'm returning this DVD to Target and I might just give up on the show all together.

They had me a bit worried at the beginning of season 4, but everything took off nicely and it came on strong to earn 5 stars.  As for season 5, while this is still one of the funniest, if not the funniest show on TV right now, it's simply not as funny.  I will say, just about the time I'm thinking maybe a particular episode is not ""making it,"" something happens or is said that makes me laugh out loud and saves it.I use to find Howard and Raj very funny, now I find them a bit pathetic.  It may be that they've always been a bit pathetic but the show was just so fast paced and funny that I didn't notice that much.  I do believe they moved much too quickly into the Howard and Bernadette wedding/marriage thing.  It may just be me, but the Penny and Leonard characters seem, at times, to be just going through the motions . . . a bit distant or disconnected (I blame the writers and director, not the actors).  Sheldon seems to have put on a pound or two; his face and neck seem much fuller.  It may be that the very, very successful and award winning actor playing the part is now living the good life a bit.  It seems to change the character a bit; it seems to give his facial expressions (which have always been hilarious) less impact.  All and all, it's still a very funny show.Edit May 3, 2012:  Interestingly, tonight's episode (the day after my posting above) was quite good and very funny.  Another episode this good, and I'll have to go to 4 1/2 stars. ;-)Edit August 20, 2012:  Well, with all things said and done, I give the 5th Season 4 1/2 stars without reservation!  They've got everything in place to have a 5 Star 6th Season, I really hope they pull it off.  I've grown very fond of the characters in the show.  Good luck on making the 6th Season another winner.Edit January 13, 2013:  The 6th Season is very interesting.  I do believe the ""gals"" are stealing the show.  For me the funniest scenes have been those involving the girls.

I don't understand why people never want anything to change, especially with the Big Bang Theory. The whole premise of the show is the four geeky guys learning about the world of girls and dating--their universe is expanding, hence the title ""The Big Bang Theory."" There is only so much you can do with 5 people and if they never did anything except sit around and play video games and Klingon Boggle then it would get extremely BORING and everyone would be complaining that the show needs to take on a new direction and add new characters. You would really want to see 5+ seasons of Howard being a perv and all the others failing at life? That's not funny, that's sad! Amy and Bernadette aren't going anywhere anytime soon, so deal with it.Anyway, this season opens up with the aftermath of Raj and Penny's night together, and it isn't what everybody automatically assumed it was, which ""ruined"" the show. And even Sheldon decides to take his friendship with Amy to the next level, by offering to be her boyfriend (with strict rules and guidelines that guarantees that nothing changes physically). Howard gets a chance to go into outer space, and when he goes to training camp, we have hysterical (and disgusting) results. And Leonard finally breaks up with Raj's sister Priya, which I am happy about because she wasn't really nice. The only thing I'm concerned about is Penny drinking a lot.This season we also had the 100th episode. I thought it was pretty funny, and some other people thought it was so ""disappointing.""A few of my favorite episodes this season are ""The Infestation Hypothesis,"" ""The Good Guy Fluctuation,"" ""The Rhinitis Revelation,"" ""The Shiny Trinket Manuever,"" ""The Werewolf Transformation,"" ""The Launch Acceleration,"" ""The Countdown Reflection"" and ""The Weekend Vortex.""6/13/12 Edit: The season finished on a high note with Howard getting married to Bernadette on the roof of the apartment, on the same morning as Google Earth does their satellite image, so they have their wedding captured on Google Earth. And a few days after, he took off to outer space. While everybody was watching the launch on TV, they all grabbed each other's hands. And SHELDON grabbed AMY'S hand. That shows how much he's grown in 5 years. I don't get why people have such a problem with that when it is SUPPOSED to happen.The show has been renewed through season 7, so they must be doing something right.4.5/5 for me! :)",5,Season 5--you cannot expect the show to stay EXACTLY the same.,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,2542,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'now', 'are', '3/4', '5th', 'season', 'favorite', 'sitcom', 'will', 'update', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'never', 'want', 'anything', 'change', 'especially', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'whole', 'premise', 'show', 'four', 'geeky', 'guys', 'learning', 'world', 'girls', 'dating', 'universe', 'expanding', 'hence', 'title', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', '5', 'people', 'never', 'did', 'anything', 'sit', 'around', 'play', 'video', 'games', 'Klingon', 'Boggle', 'then', 'would', 'get', 'extremely', 'BORING', 'everyone', 'would', 'be', 'complaining', 'show', 'take', 'new', 'direction', 'add', 'new', 'characters', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'see', '5+', 'seasons', 'Howard', 'being', 'perv', 'others', 'failing', 'life', 'not', 'funny', 'sad', 'Amy', 'Bernadette', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'anytime', 'soon', 'deal', 'it.Anyway', 'season', 'up', 'aftermath', 'Raj', 'Penny', 'night', 'together', ""n't"", 'what', 'everybody', 'automatically', 'assumed', 'was', 'ruined', 'show', 'even', 'Sheldon', 'take', 'friendship', 'Amy', 'next', 'level', 'offering', 'be', 'boyfriend', 'strict', 'rules', 'guidelines', 'nothing', 'changes', 'physically', 'Howard', 'chance', 'go', 'outer', 'space', 'when', 'training', 'camp', 'have', 'hysterical', 'disgusting', 'results', 'Leonard', 'finally', 'up', 'Raj', 'sister', 'Priya', 'am', 'happy', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'nice', 'only', 'thing', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Penny', 'drinking', 'lot.This', 'season', 'also', 'had', '100th', 'episode', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'other', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'disappointing', 'few', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'Infestation', 'Hypothesis', 'Good', 'Guy', 'Fluctuation', 'Rhinitis', 'Revelation', 'Shiny', 'Trinket', 'Manuever', 'Werewolf', 'Transformation', 'Launch', 'Acceleration', 'Countdown', 'Reflection', 'Weekend', 'Vortex', '6/13/12', 'Edit', 'season', 'finished', 'high', 'note', 'Howard', 'getting', 'married', 'Bernadette', 'roof', 'apartment', 'same', 'morning', 'Google', 'Earth', 'satellite', 'image', 'have', 'wedding', 'captured', 'Google', 'Earth', 'few', 'days', 'took', 'off', 'outer', 'space', 'everybody', 'was', 'watching', 'launch', 'TV', 'grabbed', 'other', 'hands', 'SHELDON', 'grabbed', 'AMY', 'hand', 'how', 'much', 'grown', '5', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'people', 'have', 'problem', 'when', 'SUPPOSED', 'happen.The', 'show', 'been', 'renewed', 'season', '7', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'right.4.5/5']",Big Bang Theory:S5 (DVD)
