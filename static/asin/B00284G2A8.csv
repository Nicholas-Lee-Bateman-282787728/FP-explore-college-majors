1255123,A1V8OYLDDQERDH,B00284G2A8,Bakuryuu Tyranno,"[13, 16]","Just recently I'd re-watched a movie I thought was a good version of the usual Sci-Fi Channel formula, even more recently I've seen a creature feature with a storyline that surpasses that formula completely! I think the best I could do to summarize the feel of this movie is to say that if other Sci-Fi Channel movies were originally novels the channel had dumbed down to make adaptations of, Wyvern would be a faithful adaptationUPDATE: Okay, now I have a good movie comparison. I'd say it's less like the average Sci-Fi Channel movie than it is like Lake Placid or maybe Tremors. Slower pace, charismatic oddball characters etc.Comparatively, I think the CGI is better than the flying creatures from Tremors 3 and possibly a bit worse than Lake Placid though I'm not overly familiar with that one. Needless to say its better than what you'd expect from a TV movie.So the title creature... its actually pretty good. The wyvern's anatomy is pretty good( I've had the misfortune of seeing some movies with silly-looking dragons recently, two of which had the heads of species of reptiles that just looked out of place).Also we get gore effects in which the blood actually behaves like blood (not common for this channel) and when vehicles are damaged it looks a lot better than the obvious CGI model tumbling cars we normally get in low-budget, er... everything.A lot of the characters have unusual quirks. They also react a lot more realistically to seeing people killed than the characters of most Sci-Fi Channel movies... or for that matter, most modern horror movies (let's face it; in most horror movies, even if people care before a character dies, they forget pretty quickly when that character dies)Most importantly, though, this movie is very story-based and a lot of the deaths take place offscreen. If your idea of a good horror movie involves seeing lots of people slaughtered onscreen, I think you'd enjoy it a lot less.",5,Definitely worth waiting for!,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,1932,"['Just', 'recently', ""'d"", 're-watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'version', 'usual', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'formula', 'even', 'more', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'creature', 'feature', 'storyline', 'formula', 'completely', 'think', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'summarize', 'feel', 'movie', 'say', 'other', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movies', 'were', 'originally', 'novels', 'channel', 'had', 'dumbed', 'make', 'adaptations', 'Wyvern', 'would', 'be', 'faithful', 'adaptationUPDATE', 'Okay', 'now', 'have', 'good', 'movie', 'comparison', ""'d"", 'say', 'less', 'average', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movie', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'maybe', 'Tremors', 'Slower', 'pace', 'charismatic', 'oddball', 'characters', 'etc.Comparatively', 'think', 'CGI', 'better', 'flying', 'creatures', 'Tremors', '3', 'possibly', 'bit', 'worse', 'Lake', 'Placid', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'familiar', 'one', 'Needless', 'say', 'better', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'TV', 'movie.So', 'title', 'creature', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'wyvern', 'anatomy', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ve"", 'had', 'misfortune', 'seeing', 'movies', 'silly-looking', 'dragons', 'recently', 'two', 'had', 'heads', 'species', 'reptiles', 'just', 'looked', 'place', '.Also', 'get', 'gore', 'effects', 'blood', 'actually', 'blood', 'not', 'common', 'channel', 'when', 'vehicles', 'are', 'damaged', 'lot', 'better', 'obvious', 'CGI', 'model', 'tumbling', 'cars', 'normally', 'get', 'low-budget', 'er', 'everything.A', 'lot', 'characters', 'have', 'unusual', 'quirks', 'also', 'react', 'lot', 'more', 'realistically', 'seeing', 'people', 'killed', 'characters', 'most', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movies', 'matter', 'most', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'let', 'face', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'even', 'people', 'care', 'character', 'forget', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'when', 'character', 'Most', 'importantly', 'though', 'movie', 'very', 'story-based', 'lot', 'deaths', 'take', 'place', 'offscreen', 'idea', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'seeing', 'lots', 'people', 'slaughtered', 'onscreen', 'think', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'lot', 'less']",Wyvern: Maneater Series
1255124,A2WB9VCULDR27Q,B00284G2A8,"brownie ""dogs AND dinosaurs rule!!!!!""","[26, 32]","Wyvern: DVD ReviewGrade: AI waited for Wyvern to premiere for a while when it did on the Sci-Fi channel, (January 31, 2009-it was one of those Sci-Fi Saturday new movies) and recorded it and watched it the next day. The fact that it still sticks in my mind almost five months later is an incredible feat to me--I watch a ton of movies but rarely to I witness a gem like this one.From the opening credits to the end credits, Wyvern has an energy to it that most horror movies don't have. It grabs you, and doesn't let go until the end. So after the movie had premiered on the Sci-Fi channel to good ratings (from what I hear, I'm not the only one that liked the movie better than typical Sci-Fi movies), I expected it to be immediately picked up for DVD, like other new releases had been. So I waited, and waited, and waited, and...waited some more. Finally it's here--and by the Maneater series, to my surprise.The Maneater series, which includes such titles asBlood Monkey,In the Spider's Web,Shark Swarm,Eye of the Beast,Grizzly Rage,Maneater,Vipers,The Hive (Wide Screen Edition), and the soon-to-be-releasedSea Beast, are normally hit-and-miss. For example, I absolutely hated Blood Monkey, but Vipers was pretty good, and Sea Beast ranks up among my favorite movies. I was glad to hear that Wyvern was getting a Maneater DVD release though--they come in nice slipcases, and run at cheap prices. (15 bucks for a new DVD isn't bad these days, considering that other new horror DVD's like My Bloody Valentine sell for about 30 bucks new.)So now that I know Wyvern is basically getting the Sci-Fi channel deluxe DVD treatment, (the Maneater series are just about all made- for-the-Sci-Fi-channel movies that did well) I'm glad the Sci-Fi channel made the right choice for Wyvern, seeing as it is probably their best movie. (It also seems that they also had a bigger budget on this one!)If you missed Wyvern on T.V., (it's a shame--I haven't seen re-runs on it, which is strange for a Sci-Fi channel movie) then here's the plot: A glacier melts, thawing out a prehistoric dragon that had been trapped in the ice. The dragon is hungry, and starts to feed on the residents of a near-by town...but not just for itself--this dragon's a mama. A trucker, a D.J., and a waitress, along with the survivors of the town, now try to stop the dragon, before it's babies hatch...The plot is a lot better than typical Sci-Fi fare, I can tell you that...The acting is really good--great actually. For a movie like this you don't expect even decent acting, but the actors play their characters with enthusiasm, another rarity for the channel.Yet another rarity would be the most shocking of them all--the CGI looks fantastic. The dragon lives and breathes, and packs a mean bite. It doesn't look like a video game reject, and is beautifully detailed--it looks as if they actually put money into designing the dragon. Have you ever heard the Sci-Fi channel do that?In the end the dragon looks real, the actors act real, and the plot sounds great--so what are you waiting for--a dragon to come and eat you? Wyvern packs the most fun into its running time, and I got to say, the most fun into a Sci-Fi movie in, well, ever!",5,Sci-Fi Channel's Best Movie To Date!,1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,3204,"['Wyvern', 'DVD', 'ReviewGrade', 'AI', 'waited', 'Wyvern', 'premiere', 'while', 'when', 'did', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'January', '31', '2009-it', 'was', 'one', 'Sci-Fi', 'Saturday', 'new', 'movies', 'recorded', 'watched', 'next', 'day', 'fact', 'still', 'mind', 'almost', 'five', 'months', 'later', 'incredible', 'feat', 'watch', 'ton', 'movies', 'rarely', 'witness', 'gem', 'opening', 'credits', 'end', 'credits', 'Wyvern', 'energy', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'end', 'So', 'movie', 'had', 'premiered', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'good', 'ratings', 'what', 'hear', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'liked', 'movie', 'better', 'typical', 'Sci-Fi', 'movies', 'expected', 'be', 'immediately', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'other', 'new', 'releases', 'had', 'been', 'So', 'waited', 'waited', 'waited', 'waited', 'more', 'Finally', 'here', 'Maneater', 'series', 'surprise.The', 'Maneater', 'series', 'such', 'titles', 'asBlood', 'Monkey', 'Spider', 'Web', 'Shark', 'Swarm', 'Eye', 'Beast', 'Grizzly', 'Rage', 'Maneater', 'Vipers', 'Hive', 'Wide', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'soon-to-be-releasedSea', 'Beast', 'are', 'normally', 'hit-and-miss', 'example', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'Blood', 'Monkey', 'Vipers', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Sea', 'Beast', 'up', 'favorite', 'movies', 'was', 'glad', 'hear', 'Wyvern', 'was', 'getting', 'Maneater', 'DVD', 'release', 'come', 'nice', 'slipcases', 'run', 'cheap', 'prices', '15', 'bucks', 'new', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'bad', 'days', 'considering', 'other', 'new', 'horror', 'DVD', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'sell', 'about', '30', 'bucks', 'new', 'So', 'now', 'know', 'Wyvern', 'basically', 'getting', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'deluxe', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'Maneater', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'made-', 'for-the-Sci-Fi-channel', 'movies', 'did', 'well', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'made', 'right', 'choice', 'Wyvern', 'seeing', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', 'also', 'also', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'one', 'missed', 'Wyvern', 'T.V.', 'shame', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 're-runs', 'strange', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'movie', 'then', 'here', 'plot', 'glacier', 'melts', 'thawing', 'out', 'prehistoric', 'dragon', 'had', 'been', 'trapped', 'ice', 'dragon', 'hungry', 'feed', 'residents', 'near-by', 'town', 'not', 'just', 'dragon', 'mama', 'trucker', 'D.J.', 'waitress', 'survivors', 'town', 'now', 'try', 'stop', 'dragon', 'babies', 'hatch', 'plot', 'lot', 'better', 'typical', 'Sci-Fi', 'fare', 'can', 'tell', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'great', 'actually', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'even', 'decent', 'acting', 'actors', 'play', 'characters', 'enthusiasm', 'rarity', 'channel.Yet', 'rarity', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'shocking', 'CGI', 'fantastic', 'dragon', 'lives', 'breathes', 'mean', 'bite', ""n't"", 'look', 'video', 'game', 'reject', 'beautifully', 'detailed', 'actually', 'put', 'money', 'designing', 'dragon', 'Have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'do', 'end', 'dragon', 'real', 'actors', 'act', 'real', 'plot', 'great', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'dragon', 'come', 'eat', 'Wyvern', 'most', 'fun', 'running', 'time', 'got', 'say', 'most', 'fun', 'Sci-Fi', 'movie', 'well', 'ever']",Wyvern: Maneater Series

I can't say that I've ever managed to sit through a SyFy produced film all the way through, but the raves for Wyvern had me sold that this was better than the rest.  Far from great, I found the acting rather perfunctory, and I just couldn't suspend disbelief on the CGI wyvern.

It is the same formula as most of their recent releases like Sea Beast. Monster eats people. Lots of gore & bodies being ripped apart. The obligatory scene of someone vomiting in front of the camera after seeing some people ripped to shreds. The average acting. If you are into these type of movies than you will like it, but for those of us that want something better than CGI dragons on a SY FY channel budget , you better seek elsewhere. I watched it out of curiosity. Next time Ill know better...Wyvern is a species of dragon that invades Alaska & lays eggs and its up to the apparent population of 20 to save them. CGI dragons arent all that thrilling & the cast was negligible,including a weak love triangle that never really developed.I cant really say much else other than it just wasn't all that good & made me want to watch something from the Bert I Gordon / Roger Corman 50s B monster movies.

I'm not expecting much from a movie like this, but a flaw is a flaw, especially if it's something that is a bit too obvious.1. Why was the nest on the ground and not high up somewhere or at least protected in a hard to reach cave? Not to mention the nest looks lame.2. They were surprised to find out there were eggs at the nest, but wait, that's why it would build a nest in the first place, so shouldn't they have already expected something like that? It's like a DUH moment.3. Scene where main guy runs out of building to save the doctor, who was obviously a bait and the trap was acknowledged by everyone currently there. Yet, he runs out, without any clear plan, and a guy who is healthy enough to run somewhat...sacrifices his life to save the doctor who is basically almost dead anyway. Nice trade *frowns*. The doctor dies btw. I'm guessing his role was to reveal information on the eggs, but man that's sorta wack.4. Scene where the fat woman cop (no offense but she was fat or would you sensitive people prefer if I call her big boned?) got snatched by the wyvern. So the wyvern dives down to snatch her, so he would fly over the people that are watching, yet as they scream, they continue to stare ahead of them ground level instead of a shadowy outline of the dragon flying over them, carrying the heavy load?5. The main character guy just didn't fit too well with the waitress. I'm sorry, he looks like her dad.I'm a bit confused as to the mentality and taste of the people that gave this anywhere above a 3 star. I guess you really can't believe reviews on here, it's best to watch yourself.The movie was predictable and typical from beginning to end and please do not throw in excuses like ""low budget"", ""small film"" etc to try to justify anything. A bad film with a boring plot and an even more boring ending is A BAD FILM PERIOD.It's basically a goofy movie.....no serious attention or attempt was put into it and you can tell.

1255141,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00284G2A8,trebe,"[1, 3]","Generally relying heavily on special effects, expectations may be low for most SyFy Channel productions, but Wyvern (2009) is a monster flick that is quite scary and entertaining, for a cable TV movie.  Although it is ultimately marred by a ridiculous ending, it holds together pretty well up to that point, and is a pretty fun watch.Apparently released from being trapped in the polar ice cap, the wyvern, a legendary winged reptilian creature, is now free and apparently very, very hungry.  In the town of Beaver Mills, Alaska, population 307, the residents are about to celebrate their last day with sunlight, before being plunged into darkness for a while, when the wyvern swoops out of the sky and strikes.The quality of the special effects and CGI, used to generate the mythical dragonlike monster are crucial, and fortunately they are quite well done.  Of course we know the wyvern is not really there, but it looks reasonably close to being real, and moves and flies very realistically.  The beast is vicious, and appears to be quite cunning, taking out a chopper in impressive fashion, and landing on the ground and chomping people whole.  Perhaps the budget ran out, as the special effects in the final action sequence, are very disappointing.Law enforcement are among the creature's first victims, and truck driver Jake Suttner (Nick Chinlund) emerges as the leader of a group of survivors.  Erin Karpluk (Being Erica) gives a strong, credible performance as Claire, the owner of the local cafe, which serves as the headquarters for the survivors.  The rest of the cast is solid and turn in good performances.  Don Davis (Stargate SG-1) plays an ex-military type who's preparedness turns out to be an asset.  Barry Corbin (Northern Exposure, One Tree Hill), is a hunter, John Shaw the local police chief, and Tinsel Korey is the local radio DJ, and appears wielding a gun on the DVD's cover art.The wyvern has been unbelievably busy.  Besides terrorizing the town, it somehow manages to attack all the vehicles on the road leaving the area, killing everyone.  And most importantly, she has made a nest, which contains three eggs.  The survivors mount a mission to destroy the eggs, but a plan to electrocute the creature fails.  This leads to Jake's successful, but horribly executed dispatching of the deadly creature.While predictable in some respects, director Steven Monroe's film, delivers some genuine surprises and real thrills.  It is no masterwork, but up until the putrid ending, the story is pretty solid, and the acting not bad, for a film of this type.  With realistic expectations, it is worth seeing, but you might want to rent, or pick it up used.",4,"despite an absolutely putrid ending, Wyvern is definitely entertaining . . .",1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2674,"['Generally', 'relying', 'heavily', 'special', 'effects', 'expectations', 'may', 'be', 'low', 'most', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'productions', 'Wyvern', '2009', 'monster', 'flick', 'quite', 'scary', 'entertaining', 'cable', 'TV', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'marred', 'ridiculous', 'ending', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'point', 'pretty', 'fun', 'watch.Apparently', 'released', 'being', 'trapped', 'polar', 'ice', 'cap', 'wyvern', 'legendary', 'winged', 'reptilian', 'creature', 'now', 'free', 'apparently', 'very', 'very', 'hungry', 'town', 'Beaver', 'Mills', 'Alaska', 'population', '307', 'residents', 'are', 'celebrate', 'last', 'day', 'sunlight', 'being', 'plunged', 'darkness', 'while', 'when', 'wyvern', 'sky', 'strikes.The', 'quality', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'used', 'generate', 'mythical', 'dragonlike', 'monster', 'are', 'crucial', 'fortunately', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'course', 'know', 'wyvern', 'not', 'really', 'there', 'reasonably', 'close', 'being', 'real', 'moves', 'flies', 'very', 'realistically', 'beast', 'vicious', 'be', 'quite', 'cunning', 'taking', 'out', 'chopper', 'impressive', 'fashion', 'landing', 'ground', 'chomping', 'people', 'whole', 'Perhaps', 'budget', 'ran', 'out', 'special', 'effects', 'final', 'action', 'sequence', 'are', 'very', 'disappointing.Law', 'enforcement', 'are', 'creature', 'first', 'victims', 'truck', 'driver', 'Jake', 'Suttner', 'Nick', 'Chinlund', 'leader', 'group', 'survivors', 'Erin', 'Karpluk', 'Being', 'Erica', 'strong', 'credible', 'performance', 'Claire', 'owner', 'local', 'cafe', 'headquarters', 'survivors', 'rest', 'cast', 'solid', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'Don', 'Davis', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'ex-military', 'type', 'who', 'preparedness', 'out', 'be', 'asset', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'hunter', 'John', 'Shaw', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'Tinsel', 'Korey', 'local', 'radio', 'DJ', 'wielding', 'gun', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art.The', 'wyvern', 'been', 'unbelievably', 'busy', 'terrorizing', 'town', 'somehow', 'attack', 'vehicles', 'road', 'leaving', 'area', 'killing', 'everyone', 'most', 'importantly', 'made', 'nest', 'three', 'eggs', 'survivors', 'mount', 'mission', 'destroy', 'eggs', 'plan', 'electrocute', 'creature', 'Jake', 'successful', 'horribly', 'executed', 'dispatching', 'deadly', 'creature.While', 'predictable', 'respects', 'director', 'Steven', 'Monroe', 'film', 'genuine', 'surprises', 'real', 'thrills', 'masterwork', 'up', 'putrid', 'ending', 'story', 'pretty', 'solid', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'type', 'realistic', 'expectations', 'worth', 'seeing', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'pick', 'up', 'used']",Wyvern: Maneater Series
1255142,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00284G2A8,Wuchak,"[4, 6]","Syfy's ""Wyvern"" (which originally aired in January, 2009) is a story about an Alaskan hamlet attacked by some sort of dragon-like creature, recently awoken from its long frozen hibernation. It's directed by the great grade-B-monster-flick director Stephen R. Monroe who also did ""Sasquatch Mountain"", ""Ogre"", ""It Waits"" and the remake of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (which will hit theaters this October).What I liked:- The story is taken seriously without being dead-serious.- The cast is good and the characters seem real and three-dimensional.- Erin Karpluk plays one of the main characters, Claire. She's also one of the most gorgeous females to walk the face of the earth. Nuff said.- The dragon isn't just causing havok without rhyme or reason; it has a plan.- The CGI creature is effective.The ending is an obvious homage to Spielberg's excellent 1971 TV flick ""Duel"".The film runs about 90 minutes and was filmed in Vancouver, BC (big surprise).BOTTOM LINE: If you enjoy modern monster-in-the-woods flicks like ""Goblin"", ""It Waits"" and ""Ogre"" you'll likely appreciate ""Wyvern"", which is on par with ""Goblin"" but a bit better than the other two.GRADE: B",4,Well done monster flick and...
