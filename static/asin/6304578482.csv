It's about two best friends who go to their high school reunion to try to impress all their old classmates. They reunite with old flames, old crushes, and old allies. I love the  part when they have a &quot;tounge-lashing&quot; with the ex cheerleaders. The dancing scene was weird, but funny. And the movie started with the most perfect song to get you in the mood for the flick: NO DOUBT's 'Just a Girl'. The movie has clever and witty jokes, and is filled with 80's music. Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe on 'FRIENDS') is awesome and really ditsy, Mira Sorvino ('Replacement Killers') is also very fresh and clever!

It's a movie to watch more then once and you never get sick of it.  I am a male and just by seeing this movie about these two women, Romy ( Mira Sorvino ) and Michele ( Lisa Kudrow ,) going sarcasm crazy and just having a fun time in life.Romy and Michele weren't losers in high school, but they definitely weren't the popular girls.  They were just there.  The "" A "" group, made up of a few girls, were the popular group and really made their life hell.  Kristy Masters, I don't know the actresses name, was a total, well, female dog and was mean to Romy and Michele.  Romy and Michele were like best friends and they only did stuff with each other.Now it's 10 years later, and the girls are about 27.  They still have their sarcasm and everything, and they live together in California.  Romy bumps into Toby, Janeane Garafolo, at the place she works, the Jaguar Car Dealership.  Toby says how the 10 year reunion is coming up and Romy was puzzled ... she never got an invitation.  So the girls decide to go to the reunion, but one problem ... they want to look successful.  They want to show everyone how good they look, how they act, how proud they are that they live in California while everyone else is stuck in Tuscon, Arizona, where the reunion is.  I will stop here, as I don't want to tell the whole movie.Anyways, just see this movie.

428784,A1M26ZBUZRVQT1,6304578482,"AllReviews ""Your Mo-o-o-o-vieMaven's Kwik Kri...","[2, 2]","Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion  (1997) Mira Sorvino, Lisa KudrowIf you hated your years in high school (and I imagine probably everyone but the select few ""populars"" did...ergo the wide appeal of this film!!) then you will connect with this satiric, wild ride chock-full of witty dialogue & brilliant characterizations.Before a scant 5 minutes have passed in this film, the scriptwriters get your attention right out of the starting gate with great lines between the title characters such as: ""You know we've seen Pretty Woman like 36 times and I never get tired of making fun of it"" and later on in a nightclub when they determine that there are just no hot guys there and decide to dance with each other, Romy wonders if it would be better to be a lesbian. Michelle asks her if she wanted to try having sex together just to see if she was. ""Oh no"" Romy says ""the idea of having sex with a woman just freaks me out."" But then after a moment of careful reflection concludes ""but...if neither of us has gotten married by the time we're 30, ask me again.""This movie took a chance on hiring what were then relatively new to the game players (Alan Cumming - ""I am invincible"" Boris from Golden Eye, Mira Sorvino from Mighty Aphrodite and Jeane Garafolo - Carmine the Bowler's daughter from Mystery Men) and was rewarded with the complex portrayals that usually come with older & more experienced actors. We all know how people can get stuck in a time warp and feel that either high school or college was the best years of their lives and never grow out of it. Such teen-angst-turned-impenetrable-adult-fortress is a hard one to pull off, but this cast does it beautifully. I particularly liked the quirky underlying Wizard of Oz-ish There's No Place Like Home theme - or in our heorines' case - There's No Better Person To Be Than Yourself.And the movie's title provides the perfect platform for the double entrende of the concept 'Reunion'. Our 2 girls discover on their road trip that the reunion they really wanted was with themselves and to reach a true understanding of how wonderfully original, kooky and happy they really are.",5,This One Hits It On The Head - Time After Time,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,2136,"['Romy', 'Michelle', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', '1997', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Lisa', 'KudrowIf', 'hated', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'imagine', 'probably', 'everyone', 'select', 'few', 'populars', 'did', 'ergo', 'wide', 'appeal', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'connect', 'satiric', 'wild', 'ride', 'chock-full', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'brilliant', 'characterizations.Before', 'scant', '5', 'minutes', 'have', 'passed', 'film', 'scriptwriters', 'get', 'attention', 'right', 'starting', 'gate', 'great', 'lines', 'title', 'characters', 'such', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Pretty', 'Woman', '36', 'times', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'making', 'fun', 'later', 'nightclub', 'when', 'determine', 'are', 'just', 'hot', 'guys', 'there', 'decide', 'dance', 'other', 'Romy', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'be', 'lesbian', 'Michelle', 'wanted', 'try', 'having', 'sex', 'together', 'just', 'see', 'was', 'Oh', 'Romy', 'idea', 'having', 'sex', 'woman', 'just', 'freaks', 'out', 'then', 'moment', 'careful', 'reflection', 'gotten', 'married', 'time', ""'re"", '30', 'ask', 'again', 'movie', 'took', 'chance', 'hiring', 'what', 'were', 'then', 'relatively', 'new', 'game', 'players', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'am', 'invincible', 'Boris', 'Golden', 'Eye', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'Jeane', 'Garafolo', 'Carmine', 'Bowler', 'daughter', 'Mystery', 'Men', 'was', 'rewarded', 'complex', 'portrayals', 'usually', 'come', 'older', 'more', 'experienced', 'actors', 'know', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'get', 'stuck', 'time', 'warp', 'feel', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'was', 'best', 'years', 'lives', 'never', 'grow', 'Such', 'teen-angst-turned-impenetrable-adult-fortress', 'hard', 'one', 'pull', 'off', 'cast', 'beautifully', 'particularly', 'liked', 'quirky', 'underlying', 'Wizard', 'Oz-ish', 'Place', 'Home', 'theme', 'heorines', 'case', 'Better', 'Person', 'Be', 'Than', 'Yourself.And', 'movie', 'title', 'perfect', 'platform', 'double', 'entrende', 'concept', ""'Reunion"", '2', 'girls', 'discover', 'road', 'trip', 'reunion', 'really', 'wanted', 'was', 'reach', 'true', 'understanding', 'how', 'wonderfully', 'original', 'kooky', 'happy', 'really', 'are']",Romy and Michele's High School Reunion VHS

428789,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304578482,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are a comedic dream team in `Romy and Michele's High School Reunion', a film that pits the two unlikely heroes against a slew of bullies from their past.Romy White and Michele Weinberger are content with their lives.  They think of themselves as two cool chicks, but when they are faced with the prospect of seeing all their High School friends (and enemies) they realize that their lives are not that impressive after all.  In a rash attempt to make themselves appear better than they really are they concoct a plan to deceive their entire graduating class, telling them that they invented post-its.  Of course, as is to be expected, their faade will not last, but in the end they triumph as their inner person is found to be more desirable than that of their former acquaintances.The films likeability hinges drastically on the comedic timing of the two leads, both of whom sell their characters brilliantly.  Kudrow is arguably the most effective of the two, her `Phoebe' brand of humor in full force here and proves that if any of the `Friends' cast mates should have received a `spin-off' it should have been Kudrow.  Sorvino, complete with that gruff manly voice, is also a comedic force, playing to Kudrow's strengths brilliantly.  This is not a smart comedy by any means, but the acting of these two is very smart for they help make these simple clich&eacute;d characters feel fresh and new to us.  Janeane Garofalo is also hysterical here, delivering a brilliantly satirical supporting performance.The film is a constant barrage of jokes that land for the most part (and the script is littered with quotable lines) and this helps take the simple plot to another level.  One may worry that the films running time would be too much for the flimsy plot to handle, but in the end one almost wishes that the running time were a tad longer since Sorvino and Kudrow are so funny.  That and the killer soundtrack make this one of those experiences you don't want to see end.`Romy and Michele's High School Reunion' is predictable, but it's a fun type of predictable (much like the recent `Baby Mama').  It is truly a moment when predictability is very welcome.Besides, who can hate this movie after watching that brilliantly choreographed interpretive dance routine?",4,"It's like `Night at the Roxbury', only funnier...",1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,2296,"['Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'are', 'comedic', 'dream', 'team', 'Romy', 'Michele', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', 'film', 'two', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'slew', 'bullies', 'past.Romy', 'White', 'Michele', 'Weinberger', 'are', 'content', 'lives', 'think', 'two', 'cool', 'chicks', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'prospect', 'seeing', 'High', 'School', 'friends', 'enemies', 'realize', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'impressive', 'rash', 'attempt', 'make', 'appear', 'better', 'really', 'are', 'concoct', 'plan', 'deceive', 'entire', 'graduating', 'class', 'telling', 'invented', 'post-its', 'course', 'be', 'expected', 'faade', 'will', 'not', 'last', 'end', 'triumph', 'inner', 'person', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'desirable', 'former', 'acquaintances.The', 'films', 'likeability', 'drastically', 'comedic', 'timing', 'two', 'leads', 'whom', 'sell', 'characters', 'brilliantly', 'Kudrow', 'arguably', 'most', 'effective', 'two', 'Phoebe', 'brand', 'humor', 'full', 'force', 'here', 'Friends', 'cast', 'mates', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'spin-off', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Kudrow', 'Sorvino', 'complete', 'gruff', 'manly', 'voice', 'also', 'comedic', 'force', 'playing', 'Kudrow', 'strengths', 'brilliantly', 'not', 'smart', 'comedy', 'means', 'acting', 'two', 'very', 'smart', 'help', 'make', 'simple', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'characters', 'feel', 'fresh', 'new', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'also', 'hysterical', 'here', 'delivering', 'brilliantly', 'satirical', 'supporting', 'performance.The', 'film', 'constant', 'barrage', 'jokes', 'land', 'most', 'part', 'script', 'littered', 'quotable', 'lines', 'take', 'simple', 'plot', 'level', 'One', 'may', 'worry', 'films', 'running', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'handle', 'end', 'one', 'almost', 'running', 'time', 'were', 'tad', 'longer', 'Sorvino', 'Kudrow', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'killer', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'one', 'experiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'end.', 'Romy', 'Michele', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', 'predictable', 'fun', 'type', 'predictable', 'much', 'recent', 'Baby', 'Mama', 'truly', 'moment', 'when', 'predictability', 'very', 'welcome.Besides', 'who', 'can', 'hate', 'movie', 'watching', 'brilliantly', 'choreographed', 'interpretive', 'dance', 'routine']",Romy and Michele's High School Reunion VHS

I had no idea -going by the description of this movie- that it would be focusing on a 10-year reunion.

They really want to impress their classmates, in particular a group of ignorant and sassy young ladies who the two girls *despised* while going through high school.So the girls find a way to impress their old classmates until the big day arrives, and of course, there's relationship segments involving a certain boy that one of the girls likes.It's a very likeable style of humor.  The jokes aren't necessarily one-liners, but the humor comes more in the way in how the storyline develops.  It's not for everyone though.  Don't expect immediately, jaw-droppingly amazing jokes.

428796,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304578482,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[4, 5]","Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) have been friends since they met at Sagebrush High in Tucson. Since then they both moved to Los Angeles, and they live together, but other than getting out of Tucson they are what might be described as under achievers. Michele is unemployed and Romy works as a cashier in the service department of a Jaguar dealership. They do, however, have flair, style, and share a unique fashion sense.At the Jaguar dealership Romy recognizes Heather Mooney (Janeanne Garofalo), another Sagebrush alumna, in line. Heather is obviously doing well if she can afford a Jag. She has no time for old High School chums, and barely conceals her disdain, until Heather hears that Romy is still friends with Michele, and it is revealed that Heather had a crush on Sandy Frink (Alan Cumming), who totaled ignored Heather because of his infatuation with Michele.Michele, for her part, was indifferent to Sandy's affection, because Sandy was kind of a dork. They called him the Frink-a-zoid, and isn't that always the way it is with these love triangles, or perhaps it was a trapezoid or even a rhomboid, or some other kind of oblique-angled parallelogram with unequal adjacent sidesThe 10-Year High School Reunion looms on the horizon and the die is cast. Though Heather claims she wouldn't be caught dead there, they all have a date with destiny.Romy and Michele want to lose weight, get good jobs, and good boyfriends. When two weeks proves to be too short a time to meet their objectives, they go to Plan B: Claim to be the inventors of Post-Its, and therefore rich and successful. That plan doesn't really work out, either, but at least we get a good comedy romp where scores are settled, lessons are learned, and a good time is had by most.Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow create quite the whacky kooks. Though Sorvino won an Oscar for Mighty Aphrodite, she doesn't have to resort to quite such a cartoonish voice for her Romy. Though Sorvino is certainly talented, I always thought that Oscar she won for Aphrodite was kind of a My Cousin Vinnyish fluke. If I could hand out Oscars, she'd get one for this movie instead. The part where she tells off the queen bee of the ""A"" group alone could qualify her for one.Romy and Michele are bottle blonde bimbos, but their dark roots are showing. Lisa Kudrow received a degree in Biology from Vassar College, and Mira Sorvino a degree in Asian Studies from Harvard University, so during production of Romy and Michele, they nicknamed each other ""Smart"" and ""Smarter"".An excellent counterbalance to their blonde humor is the dark and bitter Janeanne Garofalo. She makes those withering remarks that you wish you would've thought of back when you were being tormented in High School. She is a tough cookie, but then she has that vulnerable side. She can take the most polite and pedestrian prose, but through her brilliant delivery you sense the subtle malice seething underneath that thin veneer.Alan Cumming made a great dork, and though he was kind of a deus ex machina, plot wise, he does get to finally dance with his beloved Michele, though only if Romy can dance with her, so it is still a triangle, albeit an isosceles triangle with the two equal sides of Romy and Michele. It is an interesting twist on the whole dance at the prom or reunion scene, and is set to the lovely 80's ballad ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper. The title fits in well with the whole reunion theme, too.Director David Mirkin does a great job for someone who has mostly worked in television. He keeps the jokes and pop culture references flowing -- Mary Tyler Moore Show, Pretty Woman, Footloose -- he has the boys in the Jaguar Service Department watching The Simpsons, and as an inside joke, it is one that he directed. Though he worked mostly in television, it was good television. Besides The Simpsons, there was the brilliant but short lived Chris Elliot vehicle Get a Life, Newhart, and The Larry Sanders Show. Mirkin did a great job directing this film, and even his name is funny.Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence, a  glorified pot-au-feu, an animated merkin, I settled for ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion."" Ah, the High School Reunion Genre, it must have been something in the zeitgeist of 1997, because that year also saw the release of ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" also featuring a 10-Year High School Reunion; only this one had a better selection of music, and the protagonist, Martin Q. Blank, was a professional hit man, so his problem was what to tell people he did for a living since graduating.The shot gun marriage of action movie with High School Reunion comedy that was ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" didn't work nearly as well as R&M;'sHSR, but Romy and Michele also had trouble telling people what they did for a living, since Romy was a cashier, and Michele was unemployed. Not very impressive.Though Romy and Michele were not very impressive, ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" was very impressive. Very impressive, indeed.---------------------Michele: Hey Romy, remember Mrs. Divitz's class, there was like always a word problem. Like, there's a guy in a rowboat going X miles, and the current is going like, you know, some other miles, and how long does it take him to get to town? It's like, 'Who cares?

I love the music, I love to laugh at the styles that were popular then, and I love to laugh at pictures of myself with mile-high hair.&quot;Romy &amp;  Michele's High School Reunion&quot; brought back a lot of those memories.  From the music to the clothes to the &quot;high-school mentality,&quot; I  laughed continuously through it.  Even my boyfriend got a kick out of it.  He doesn't normally like &quot;chick flick&quot; movies - he steers clear  of them.  However, I found him laughing right along with me.This movie  also struck a nerve with me:  high school pettiness.  References to the  &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; crowd made me practically  nod my head in agreement.Romy and Michele's desperate effort to fit in  can mirror many people's experience when it comes to being liked by the  &quot;in&quot; crowd.  Their attempts to fit in and appear successful are  laughed at and announced to the whole school (this is where the old high  school pettiness comes in, even after 10 years) and Romy is devestated.  All she ever wanted was to fit in, to have others like her.Michele is  quick to remind Romy that when it came right down to it, their high school  years weren't all that bad.  She had FUN.  So, why not do at the reunion  what they should have come for in the first place?  Be themselves!  Stop  trying to impress people!  Who cares what other people think?Overall,  this movie is a fun romp to liven the spirits.

Two fun-loving but less than intellectually astute blondes (let's just say that they're not the type of people whom you engage in the Hegelian dialectic with) find out that their 10 year high school reunion is coming up.  As they both lead what they believe to be very ""ordinary"" lives, they have a plan to lie about their professions so as to impress their former classmates.The strongest point of this DVD is its cute satire of what can & does happen at HS reunions.  So many times the people who were thought to be ""shoe-ins"" for success end up falling flat on their faces.  Meanwhile, the quiet people whom nobody ever paid any attention to end up becoming mega-successful.  This is a theme that is played out in a myriad of ways throughout the film.It is demonstrable that Mira Sorvino is a dynamic actress who can play just about any kind of character there is.  She could easily go from playing a ditzy girl in the present film to playing college professor in her next project if she so chose.It remains to be seen how far Lisa Kudrow's talents can stretch.  The clueless blonde she plays in this story is pretty much a clone of her FRIENDS persona.  I'd like to see her in a role that she's not typecast as.The good news for this film is that Kudrow and Sorvino work well with each other.  They are believable as best friends who have virtually never been apart.  If nothing else, we get to view Kudrow in about a dozen different hairstyles during the movie, and she looks FABULOUS in all of them!If you're looking for a cheesy flick that has some satirical moments, this movie is worth a look.  It's not hilariously funny, but there are some comical moments.

It stars Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow, who play Romy and Michele respectively. They receive an invitation to their 10 year high school reunion. Through &quot;flashbacks&quot; we see what they were like in high school, as well as a bunch of other characters like Heather, Sandy, and more. Romy and Michele don't have any boyfriends, and Michele isn't working. Once they start doing their forms for the reunion to see what they've been up to, they realize their lives aren't very impressive and decide to do something about it. They devise a plan and say that they invented Post It Notes. Romy &amp; Michele have a falling out on the road trip there, and a weird dream ensues. Back to reality, at the reunion, dressed as business woman, they are laughed out of the place when their lie is uncovered by Heather. Romy &amp; Michele make up and are friends again, and decide to have fun nonetheless. They realize it doesn't matter what anyone thought of them, that they had fun with each other nonetheless. They come in their own flashy outfits that their peers would have remembered them in, and ultimately take the place by storm and show up everyone who did them wrong in high school. Michele finally hooks up with Sandy, who had a crush on her in high school, Romy sets her crush straight, and they go back to live a fabulous life in LA where they own their own fashion store. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow were made for these roles, it's truly a great movie for laughs and smiles. Oh and the soundtrack for the movie is excellent, 80's classics!

Anyway, my college roommate and I would watch this movie when fighting stress, trying to hide from stupid people at college, and for relaxation (which means that we watched it about every other week).  A most necessary escapism!The opening scene, in which R & M are making fun of ""Pretty Woman"" (""As if the salesgirls there aren't bigger whores than she is""....""i get so happy when they let her shop!"") is pretty much evocative of the whole movie - comparing themselves with other women, shopping for jobs and men.Another great scene is when they're at the club, looking for suitable men, and Romy gets away from one guy with the excuse, ""I cut my foot before, and my shoe is filling up with blood.""A wonderful movie in general, especially for individualists who were never part of cliques, who despise people that still grade others with shallow high school hierarchy systems.Laugh outloud funny, and Janeane Garafalo's character is a perfectly independent blend of bitterness, sarcasm, and bitchiness. ""This dress exacerbates the genetic betrayal that is my legacy.""Especially enjoyed the 80s high school flashbacks. Dressing like Madonna for the prom, happily basking in their fashion skills and originality (but of course Billy had to ruin it). When one of the A-list crowd put the magnets on Romy's back, it was so tragic. As Michele said later, ""You couldn't help that you had scoliosis!"" Duh! Bullies who pick on people for traits that they cannot change should be dragged out into the street and shot (Garfield used to say that, I believe).The reunion itself is both sad and a relief.

The two stars keep the film moving along, despite the various lapses in David Mirkin's direction, and the weird suspicion that the cute idea can't sustain a full-length feature film. (Proven by the lenghy mid-dream sequence). However, Sorvino and Kudrow are definitely worth seeing the film for. They know their characters, and become them, making these unbelievable women totally real. The supporting cast include the always wonderful Alan Cumming, Camryn Manheim, and Janeane Garofalo as a vicious, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed former classmate, who has some amazingly funny lines, and proves to be one of the better characters in the film.

428857,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6304578482,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 1]","In 1997, David Mirkin, in his big-screen directorial debut, directed the light-hearted comedy ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"", which was written originally as the play ""The Ladies Room"" by Robin Schiff (who was also one of the film's executive producers).  The story is about two ditzy blondes in their late 20's, Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow), who live together in Southern California and decide to attend their ten-year high school reunion in Tucson, Arizona.  Having little cash, the two manage to borrow a car to drive to Tucson, but become concerned about making a big impression on their former high school classmates.  They invent a story about them being businesswomen and inventors and reminisce about their high school days.  Throughout high school, Romy was infatuated with football star Billy Christianson (Vincent Ventresca), but he was dating the conceited Christy Masters (Julia Campbell).  Christy's friends included Cheryl (Mia Cottet), Kelly (Kristin Bauer) and Lisa Luder (Elaine Hendrix), who were otherwise known collectively as the ""A-Group"".  A nerdy guy named Sandy Frank (Alan Cumming) was infatuated with the then-back-brace-wearing Michelle, who wasn't particularly interested in him.  Then there were the other assorted high school personalities including the fast-talking & insensitive Heather Mooney (Janeane Garofalo), the maudlin Toby Walters (Camryn Manheim) and the shy nameless cowboy (Justin Theroux).Though the plot and dialog are simple, the combination of the wonderful acting by Lisa Kudrow, Mira Sorvino, Janeane Garofalo and Julia Campbell, as well as the film's fantastic soundtrack, make ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" a very entertaining comedy.  Songs in the film's mostly 1980's soundtrack include, but are not limited to, ""Just A Girl"" (by ""No Doubt""), ""Y.M.C.A.""

It was a nice, lite, airy comedy about a real horror story we have all dealt with : high school.  Two dizzy blondes who had been friends since those days and are still together have returned to their high school for the ten year reunion.  They really haven't amounted to much, but try to reinvent themselves as success stories to impress their former classmates.This was a clever idea, but the idea did not stretch out enough to make a quality movie out of it.  I have been to my ten year reunion, and I must say that you feel sort of like a loser.  You can use it as a motivation to make things better for you, but we all lack in some way.  What is so funny is that, at least at my reunions, the popular kids, whose high school experience must have been so wonderful because they made everyone else so miserable, didn't show up.  People go right back to the same cliques they were in, even if they haven't seen or spoken to each other in years.  Maybe you don't have the loving spouse, fame, fortune, steller career or whatever else is so important, but neither do others.  The Mean Girls are losers.

Really, I'm just here to testify that R&M;, from the first time I saw it in 1997 and in each of the probably dozen viewings since, remains one of the funniest 'guilty pleasure' films of all time!  AND it has a heart of pure gold at the center of all the hysterical post-high school hijinks.  The vintage 1980's New Wave soundtrack alone is worth the cost of admission!Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino dive into their characters with a fearless gusto, creating iconic (if slightly moronic) 1990's versions of clubgirls who are BFF's since high school, and continue to be the essential supports for each other's sometimes fragile and yet utterly unwarranted and overblown self esteem. It's kind of ironic, and more than a little pleasureable watching two of Hollywood's brightest and most generous actresses portraying such completely self-absorbed, delusional characters!The rest of the cast is equally brilliant and deliciously funny.  Janeane Garofalo is wicked as R&M;'s fellow high school alum, a nicotine-addicted, angst-ridden, goth-girl who just can't get past her loner status in HS, even though she's gone on to create success for herself following her heart....or rather her cravings. Cameron Mannheim seems impossibly naive, young and vulnerable playing the classmate who was involved in everything, and annoyed the hell out of the rest of the class. Alan Cumming is literally unrecognizable as his character morphs from nerdy HS geek to Billionaire mogul.  And on and on, the cast of largely at the time upandcoming actors seem to really enjoy playing their parts as if they were hitting for the outfield fence....which could go wrong in another film, with another script or another director, but here it just adds layer upon layer of comedic icing to this cinematic confection!I won't go into all the plot turns and contrivances, but suffice to say R&M; is chock full of funny (and occasionally sweet) scenes providing a look into the minds of these young women who refuse to see their rather mundane lives as anything less than full blown exciting, and their exuberance is contagious!  Can we just talk a minute about the dance club scene early on in the film, where R&M;, disappointed at that night's prospects in the club, decide to dance together, and casually step out onto the dancefloor, launching in a perfectly synchronized and choreographed disco pas de deux???YES, I love Romy and Michele---I always have and I always will.

428870,A27RUG27Y2HHIL,6304578482,Pessimystica,"[5, 6]","This movie was actually a LOT better than I thought it would be.  I watched it on TV out of mere curiousity, esp. since my own reunion wasn't too far off at the time.  It really does make anyone reflect on their high school days & wonder what really has changed.  Romy & Michele ""like totally"" remind me of the relationship I had with my best friend & how we were like in high school... best friend loners that just wanted to be noticed and accepted.  The thing that always blew my mind was that for some reason, there were only the select few that were ""popular"", but who really gives them that position, only for it to not to even matter after graduation?  Other than just mere wishing, I never actually tried to be apart of the ""in"" crowd, I was too busy being a band nerd, & that was what my high school life was centered on so I wouldn't have to dwell with the social aspects.  Even still, I tried so hard to be the best, which I succeeded in, but what was I really doing it for, myself, or for everyone else's approval?  That's exactly what Romy & Michele want is approval, & they're gonna try as hard as they can to get it...only to realize, what were they actually doing it for in the first place?  I think a LOT of people can relate to this.  Another question still weighs my mind... ""What's the point of going if we're not gonna impress people?""  For the most part, you should go to a reunion because you want to, not just to impress people... but wouldn't it be nice at the same time to make someone gasp at your envious life?  Just for the record, I did have mine, but I didn't go because of various (convenient) conflicts.  If I did go, I at least wanted to talk & reflect with those classmates of mine (mostly in band) that actually did make that difficult period worth while.Kudrow & Sorvino make a cute, awesome pair...I can't really think of anyone else able to pull off their characters as well.  Janeane Garofalo's character is equally amusing with her uber sarcastic comments.  There are so many funny scenes & memorable lines, like the hilarious ""Oh Ramon"" scene, esp. when she says ""you wanted it to be believable""....yes, smile if you wish.  Romy had her voice all too well planned out for when she announces: ""I invented post-its"".  Then when they try to impress the A crowd, you can't help but laugh when Michele says ""We're not the ones who got fat,"" or ""I hope your babies look like monkeys!""  Very very silly, but you can't help but laugh and agree.  You also can't help but feel for the girls' relationship, like when Romy realizes that they can't accessibly find new jobs & boyfriends in 2 weeks, & Michele says in her encouraging voice, ""But I thought you said we could?"", & then later she also tells her ""I thought high school was a blast"", referring to the fact that it was a blast because of Romy... which I totally related to.  And who can't help but love the 80's tunes!The main drawback to the movie is the audience it caters to... which, of course, is female.  I even made my mom watch it, and she liked it.  I certainly have never met any men who have admitted to watching it, but I'm sure some could find it enjoyable once they get past the girly-ness.  It does seem overly girly at times, like all the fashion talk (I'm not much of a fashion buff myself), but this is overlooked for me because I'm always drawn to the various points the movie makes, like how it pokes fun at stereotypes & how materialistic society is.  Quite possibly I liked it so much because I related to the characters, and if you don't relate to the characters, you might not ""get it""... or maybe you will.  In a way, they reminded me of female versions of Beavis & Butthead... where they're in their own world, one's smarter, but they still have lots of witty things to say.  Who knows, it may have been really boring if the girls had been extremely intelligent... but who cares, it was fun the way it was.  Either way, even though the movie may seem silly & simple on the outside, on the inside is a lot of laughs & thoughts to stay with you through each viewing.

428875,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6304578482,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","A high school reunion can be many different things to different people, and those who attend one do so for a variety of reasons.  For some, it's a return to the ""glory days;"" for others, it can be a masochistic attempt to purge the memories of a past they'd rather forget, but cannot; still others will go seeking vindication and/or retribution for real or imagined injuries suffered at the hands of juvenile miscreants during the formative years.  Then there are those who will go out of simple curiosity (""I wonder what so-and-so looks like now?) or just because it sounds like it might be fun.  And then there are those who would rather have red hot coals pressed into their eye sockets than show up at such a shindig.  Call it different strokes for different folks; but whatever you call it, you're going to meet all of these and more, in ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,"" directed by David Mirkin, a light comedy that indicates that the past may have, indeed, been everything you thought it was, and more-- but that perhaps you just hadn't seen it clearly at the time.  And, upon returning to the scene of the crime, as it were, you discover that ten years of maturing and endlessly revisiting certain school days situations in your mind can do to your perception of it what laser surgery on the eyes can do for a myopic-- for maybe the first time in your life, you can actually see everything crystal clear, and the way it really was back in ""The day.""It's been ten years since lifetime friends Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) graduated from high school, left Small Town, U.S.A. and headed for L.A., where their respective endeavors have at last taken them both to the very top of the minimum wage pay scale.  When the news of their ten-year reunion comes down the pike to them, they're excited and want to go.  Upon reflection, however, it occurs to them that returning to an environment that was less than accepting of them a decade ago, without having accomplished anything more than successfully drawing breath on a daily basis, could possibly be construed as the proverbial fools errand.  They'd just be setting themselves up for the likes of perpetual Prom Queen Christy Masters (Julia Campbell) and her ""top of the `in-crowd'"" cronies (all of whom are sure to be in attendance) to once again come in for the kill.  Not a happy prospect.Romy and Michele, however, have learned a couple of things since high school (and probably no more than that; it's why they're where they are today), and they put their heads together and concoct a plan through which they will finally obtain that which has always eluded them:  The cherished esteem of their peers (and most especially, that of  Christy Masters and her cohorts).  And it's so simple-- all they have to do is attend the reunion as a pair of successful businesswomen!  They even come up with the kind of business they're ""in,"" just on the off-chance someone should ask (what are the chances of that!).  It's a brilliant plan, it's foolproof and it's going to be fun.  And with that, Romy and Michele are off to their high school reunion.Light comedy, like a meal consisting of ""lite"" ingredients, can be a delicious and satisfying treat for the cinematic palate.  When properly prepared and dished up in just the right proportions, it can be a cause for celebration; and Mirkin's film is just that-- a cause for celebration.  It's well crafted and delivered, works on a number of different levels and will appeal to a wide audience, inasmuch as the subject of the film is one to which most people are going to be able to identify and relate, and on a very personal basis, at that.  Without question, personal experience and individual frame of reference are going to determine how this one is received, and on which level; and it will hinge on which group from among those listed above in paragraph one the viewer falls into.  For some, this film is going to be fun-- taken at face value by the curious who just want a few laughs-- and they won't be disappointed, because this is funny stuff.  For others, however, beyond the surface humor, it may tap into some dark corners of the psyche, revealing things that have been repressed, possibly, but not forgotten.  And regardless to which group the viewer belongs, it will be those with a keen sense of perception that will understand that this is a comedy with some very serious underpinnings.Again, it's the personal experience and frame of reference that will come into play here.  Those of a more superficial bent will see Romy and Michele as prime targets to be set up and used for fun; mere objects of derision held aloft for the merriment of others.  The more astute will recognize the cruelty enacted upon them for just what it is:  Cruelty.  And it's a sad fact that for many-- the ""real"" Romys and Micheles of the world-- the price of the education received in high school was high, indeed:  Tuition paid in psychological scars carried-- in too many instances-- throughout the remainder of one's life; scars born of the cruelty meted out by the ""perfect"" upon those deemed ""unworthy"" of acceptance in the prevailing social order.  Heavy stuff for a ""light"" comedy?  Perhaps.  But it's what makes this film so good; it entertains-- Sorvino and Kudrow together?  Forget about it, they're terrific-- but it also makes you think.  And, hopefully, it will encourage the ""real"" Christy Masters' of the world to pause and reflect upon past deeds and ""judgments"" handed down in the throes of juvenile self-righteousness.  ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" is funny-- very funny-- but it also says something that is genuinely worth saying.",4,Mira and Lisa's High School Reunion Movie,1029888000,"08 21,

When Romy runs into an old high school classmate (Jeanne Garofalo, who I usually like) at work, Romy and Michelle decide to go to their 10th high school reunion.

When they get there, the old popular girls are still total witches and treat them pretty shabbily -- except for one who is now a fashion editor and compliments them on the clothes they've made to wear. Meanwhile, as a side note, Garofalo is also there, hooking up with a mysterious cowboy from her high school past. The ending is pretty predictable, but pretty funny nonetheless and while this isn't a highbrow comedy, this movie is a very funny comedy and worth a good viewing or two.
