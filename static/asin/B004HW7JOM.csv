Then a friend recommended it to me, so I gave it another shot ...and now I can't get enough. The three guys in the show write, direct and act, and they do a really good job. The Blu-ray is a steal at the price it's offered at, and there's a few little bonuses on there worth watching.

1410140,A8ZSAECESMS1Q,B004HW7JOM,AnnKay21,"[1, 1]","I love this show! Finally comedy central makes a worthwile sitcom.  As described, it is a slacker/stoner comedy...and I have adored every single minute of it!  Sure it's over the top and the humor is often crude, but its perfect for the lead characters. - Anders, Blake, Adam, and Kyle have amazing on screen chemistry.  My favorite is Blake. - He manages to be endearing amidst some pretty coarse humor. - And you'll likely spend half an episode wondering if he's wearing a curly wig.  Adam is really quite funny - sort of like Jack Black.  Anders is the straight man and a pretty decent rapper.  He shows his skills throughout the first season.  Kyle is great as the addled drug dealer.  In one scene Kyle says he's wearing ""camel-flauge"" to Ander's dismay.  The guys write the show (Kyle directs some of the episodes).  Frankly I think this comedy is more clever than it's given credit for.  And I can't wait until it comes out on dvd.  Amazingly the actors were picked by Comedy Central from their youtube video postings.  They have their own website called ""mail order comedy"".  Although their amatuer stuff is a little rough around the edges it's still pretty funny.  Anyway, I predict an even bigger following of fans in the second season of Workaholics - which should start September 20th.  And if you're still not sure about the show, you should watch a clip on comedy central to see if it's a good fit for you.

1410158,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004HW7JOM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Despite its title, the Comedy Central produced ""Workaholics"" is not a traditional work place sitcom.  It is a quintessential stoner/slacker comedy featuring three friends as they adapt (or refuse to adapt) to the increasingly complex world of adulthood.  The guys are continuously rude, obnoxious and/or clueless and yet the bonds of their friendship may stretch, but never break--even when they behave in the most horrifying ways to one another.  Unabashedly silly and crude, and oftentimes hilarious, this comedy makes no apologies for what it is.  Not for sensitive viewers, this is in-your-face aggressive without a concern for political correctness or appropriateness.  It is the irreverent ""anything can happen"" feel that is the core selling point for this ridiculously appealing show.  I suspect that if you enjoy the wild antics of ""Workaholics,"" you will become a fervent and vocal supporter of the show.  If, however, it all seems a bit juvenile for your taste--there is a good chance you will absolutely loathe this program.  This could very well be a love-it or hate-it proposition.Season One lines up ten episodes which spend about equal time between work and other recreational activities.  Some of the strongest episodes do deal specifically with the job site.  In one episode, the boys vie for a promotion and their warfare against one another becomes increasingly brutal.  In another, the boys organize a strike when the bosses won't recognize a completely ridiculous holiday.  The season finale (with an invaluable assist by guest Chris Parnell as the company's CEO) has the guys fighting to save the company itself!  It's all over-the-top and silly but that's the charm.  In one of the show's most uncomfortable episodes, the boys befriend a child predator because he's a cool guy.  Hey, you can't argue with that kind of reasoning!The show succeeds on the chemistry between its leads--Anders Holm, Blake Anderson, and Adam DeVine.  While all fill their particular niche to perfection, it is Holm that is the stand-out for me.  The only character that straddles the worlds of adolescence and adulthood--he is oftentimes made the stooge for trying to be successful.  Jillian Bell provides great support as an off-beat co-worker that gets into her share of trouble as well, and Maribeth Monroe is delightful as the boss consistently pushed over the edge of reason.  This is a deft comedy of slapstick and silliness.  Its humor is crude and juvenile.  If you don't like that sort of thing--then, by all means, stay far away.  If, however, your looking for a good fix of rude and rollicking laughs--give it a shot.
