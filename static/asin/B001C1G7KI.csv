The only drawback for me was the inclusion of the actress (that's a stretch); Lake Bell. I couldn't have been happier when she left the program. Now it's better than ever. The interaction between Shatner, Spader and Auberjonois keeps us in stitches and second guessing what someone will pull out of their hat (rabbit) again and again.

1173871,A2XB3GDFOQPBR9,B001C1G7KI,"Jan Levine Thal ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","Boston Legal was zany from the start and seemingly intentionally offensive to everyone at one time or another. As a political correctness freak (yes, I'm pro -- there are only about three of us left in the country and the other two aren't speaking to me) who is easily offended, I was surprised at how easily I embraced the show. Occasionally I'd be annoyed at a plot line that seemed virtually pointless until I tumbled to whatever was being said, sometimes about pointlessness itself. Frequently the subject matter was topical and handled with complexity (news shows, learn! learn!). Above all, I think the enduring contribution was the writing, but I suspect these particular actors were crucial. The acting was pitch-perfect, creating a brilliantly larger-than-life comedy that required actors to be nuanced multi-taskers. For instance, James Spader, completely believable as an aging womanizer offered equal verisimilitude as the brilliant legal mind who usually delivered the 11th hour summation. Candace Bergen, always a joy, created a persona with a sharp tongue yet consistent acumen and integrity (slightly straining credulity since she was meant to be head of a financially successful firm before the 2008 crisis). William Shatner had so much fun as the buffoon-savant, one could only laugh in horror at his antics. Many other skilled actors, famous and not, joined the cast for shorter or longer stints. And as the characters themselves said during the final episode, a cast of generally great actors (and older ones, at that) will not soon be seen again on a show this smart.
