327455,A3Q77CS1DEQLMG,630267672X,Alessandro Bruno,"[5, 6]","Mediterraneo is an excellent title for this film, for I truly think it exposes the mediterranean character and as a very mediterranean person myself I identified fully with the lack of organization, improvisation and genral unwillingness to follow, or modify, orders that the group of Italian  soldiers display as they invade the island.  In truth several abandoned and semi-abanodened Greek islands weer 'colonized' by the Italian army in WWII and just like the soldiers in the film, many had no idea what was going on in the rest of the war. The film is therefore very good from this standpoint.  However, it's also good at showing the affinity that Mediterraneans share and the ease with which the Italians adapt to the island, even becoming reluctant to elave when the time comes.  Then agian, many leave to go to Italy in search of opportunities, the chance to re-build a better Italy after the tragedy of fascism and Mussolini. if the film had stopped here it would have been very good; however, there's more, and perhaps only those very familair with Italian politics in the early 90's could have captured the subtle criticism.  Indeed, the film is really an indictement of the modern era.  The film was made when Italy was deep into an investigation that uncovered several layers of corruption at the governmental and high business level.  The investigation was known as Mani Pulite - Clean Hands - and its outcome was a shake-up of the old parties and oled politicians, or so it seemed.  The film then shos that nothing had really changed since Mussolini, the great nation that was supposed to be did not arise and the prospects for improvement were no better.  The main characters meet again in fact on the island in the present as they escaped the relaity of Italy once more.  Despite this obvious self-criticism I also think the film shows some of the more positive aspects of Italys' non-greatness.  the fact that it can laugh at itself and the subtle defiance of authority that preserves and respects individuality, not to mention the sense of humor that can develop into a people in such circumstances.As a final note I found the film's music to be superb.",5,20th century iliad?,1007942400,"12 10, 2001",2001,2171,"['Mediterraneo', 'excellent', 'title', 'film', 'truly', 'think', 'mediterranean', 'character', 'very', 'mediterranean', 'person', 'identified', 'fully', 'lack', 'organization', 'improvisation', 'genral', 'unwillingness', 'follow', 'modify', 'orders', 'group', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'display', 'invade', 'island', 'truth', 'several', 'abandoned', 'semi-abanodened', 'Greek', 'islands', 'weer', ""'colonized"", 'Italian', 'army', 'WWII', 'just', 'soldiers', 'film', 'many', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'rest', 'war', 'film', 'therefore', 'very', 'good', 'standpoint', 'However', 'also', 'good', 'showing', 'affinity', 'Mediterraneans', 'share', 'ease', 'Italians', 'adapt', 'island', 'even', 'becoming', 'reluctant', 'elave', 'when', 'time', 'Then', 'agian', 'many', 'leave', 'go', 'Italy', 'search', 'opportunities', 'chance', 're-build', 'better', 'Italy', 'tragedy', 'fascism', 'Mussolini', 'film', 'had', 'stopped', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'however', 'more', 'perhaps', 'only', 'very', 'familair', 'Italian', 'politics', 'early', '90', 'could', 'have', 'captured', 'subtle', 'criticism', 'Indeed', 'film', 'really', 'indictement', 'modern', 'era', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'Italy', 'was', 'deep', 'investigation', 'uncovered', 'several', 'layers', 'corruption', 'governmental', 'high', 'business', 'level', 'investigation', 'was', 'known', 'Mani', 'Pulite', 'Clean', 'Hands', 'outcome', 'was', 'shake-up', 'old', 'parties', 'oled', 'politicians', 'so', 'seemed', 'film', 'then', 'shos', 'nothing', 'had', 'really', 'changed', 'Mussolini', 'great', 'nation', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'did', 'not', 'arise', 'prospects', 'improvement', 'were', 'better', 'main', 'characters', 'meet', 'again', 'fact', 'island', 'present', 'escaped', 'relaity', 'Italy', 'once', 'more', 'obvious', 'self-criticism', 'also', 'think', 'film', 'more', 'positive', 'aspects', 'Italys', 'non-greatness', 'fact', 'can', 'laugh', 'subtle', 'defiance', 'authority', 'individuality', 'not', 'mention', 'sense', 'humor', 'can', 'develop', 'people', 'such', 'circumstances.As', 'final', 'note', 'found', 'film', 'music', 'be', 'superb']",Mediterraneo VHS

327465,A3N7QVBNKU5S2M,630267672X,J. Brackett,"[8, 9]","This film story is culturally valuable because of the ways in which it contradicts itself. The film's credits say that it is, ""Dedicated to all those who are running away."" A line of dialogue reinforces this idea. Lorusso says, ""In times like these, escape is the only way. To live and keep dreaming."" And yet at the end of the film, Antonio, Lorusso and the Sergeant are all together again on the Greek island that they had wanted to escape so badly at the story's start. They escaped the war by accident. They escaped the reality of their desertion periodically with drugs, sex and games. But the film asserts that once a person allows a culture, a place, or a people to move them, there is no escaping it. Once a person finds beauty within a situation and makes a home out of it, the good feelings and ideals created in that context are forever within them.  When Lorusso returns to the island many years after, he says of Italy, ""They didn't let us change anything."" His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence, where people can grow and change, and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in war-torn Italy, he ""escaped"" once again to the island where he had been happy.The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers, the Sergeant admits early on, are a ""platoon of misfits"": a Bacchus-like Russian, a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife, a pair of goat-herding brothers from the mountains, a weak and feminine but ever-loyal Antonio, a man in love with Lorusso, and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly, and their nationalistic feelings, if they ever had any, quickly wane. ""I feel abandoned,"" one of the men comments. Lorusso says, ""They left us here and here we'll stay."" Staying on the island, early in the story, doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since ""Greece is the Tomb of Italians"" is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns, as the characters do, that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm. Beautiful cinematography and music ease the audience into a comfortable life on the Greek island along with the soldiers; their senses are our senses, their feelings our feelings, because the elements of film are so carefully crafted. The Sergeant's statement about the ""poets, philosophers, warriors, and goddesses"" from which they are all descended sets the tone for the film. Antonio recognizes the poet within himself, Vasilissa the goddess. The Sergeant is clearly a philosopher and Lorusso learns to project his warrior-like tendencies towards compassionate means, such as protecting his friends. The story, by allowing us to feel and witness such growth within such ordinarily quirky and believable characters, suggests that such a compassionate existence is available for everyone. The film is dedicated to the audience, who is allowed to escape within its beauty for a while, and come out knowing a little better what human compassion is capable of.",5,"""Dedicated to all those who are running away""",1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,3173,"['film', 'story', 'culturally', 'valuable', 'ways', 'film', 'credits', 'say', 'Dedicated', 'who', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'line', 'dialogue', 'reinforces', 'idea', 'Lorusso', 'times', 'escape', 'only', 'way', 'live', 'keep', 'dreaming', 'yet', 'end', 'film', 'Antonio', 'Lorusso', 'Sergeant', 'are', 'together', 'again', 'Greek', 'island', 'had', 'wanted', 'escape', 'so', 'badly', 'story', 'start', 'escaped', 'war', 'accident', 'escaped', 'reality', 'desertion', 'periodically', 'drugs', 'sex', 'games', 'film', 'once', 'person', 'culture', 'place', 'people', 'move', 'escaping', 'Once', 'person', 'beauty', 'situation', 'home', 'good', 'feelings', 'ideals', 'created', 'context', 'are', 'forever', 'When', 'Lorusso', 'island', 'many', 'years', 'Italy', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'change', 'anything', 'life', 'island', 'had', 'given', 'ideal', 'compassionate', 'existence', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'grow', 'change', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'capable', 'achieving', 'war-torn', 'Italy', 'escaped', 'once', 'again', 'island', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'happy.The', 'beauty', 'story', 'immense', 'craftsmanship', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'moving', 'had', 'compassionate', 'existence', 'not', 'been', 'created', 'unlikely', 'people', 'unlikely', 'place', 'soldiers', 'Sergeant', 'early', 'are', 'platoon', 'misfits', 'Bacchus-like', 'Russian', 'frequent', 'deserter', 'who', 'get', 'back', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'pair', 'goat-herding', 'brothers', 'mountains', 'weak', 'feminine', 'ever-loyal', 'Antonio', 'man', 'love', 'Lorusso', 'man', 'love', 'donkey', 'are', 'anything', 'soldierly', 'nationalistic', 'feelings', 'ever', 'had', 'quickly', 'wane', 'feel', 'abandoned', 'one', 'men', 'comments', 'Lorusso', 'left', 'here', 'here', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'Staying', 'island', 'early', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'welcome', 'proposition', 'Greece', 'Tomb', 'Italians', 'written', 'wall', 'town', 'audience', 'characters', 'do', 'townspeople', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'harmless', 'welcoming', 'warm', 'Beautiful', 'cinematography', 'music', 'ease', 'audience', 'comfortable', 'life', 'Greek', 'island', 'soldiers', 'senses', 'are', 'senses', 'feelings', 'feelings', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'Sergeant', 'statement', 'poets', 'philosophers', 'warriors', 'goddesses', 'are', 'descended', 'tone', 'film', 'Antonio', 'poet', 'goddess', 'Sergeant', 'clearly', 'philosopher', 'Lorusso', 'project', 'warrior-like', 'tendencies', 'towards', 'compassionate', 'means', 'such', 'protecting', 'friends', 'story', 'allowing', 'feel', 'witness', 'such', 'growth', 'such', 'ordinarily', 'quirky', 'believable', 'characters', 'compassionate', 'existence', 'available', 'everyone', 'film', 'dedicated', 'audience', 'who', 'allowed', 'escape', 'beauty', 'while', 'come', 'out', 'knowing', 'little', 'better', 'what', 'human', 'compassion', 'capable']",Mediterraneo VHS

Subsequently, the Italians are forced to interact with the local Greek populace with everything that that entails.  When the Germans arrive, things get a bit more complicated...Mediterraneo, is a film that touches on human relations, and such concepts as hope, honor and inner strength.Needless to say, all the actors have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least; without exceptions, they give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.

It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor (!!!), and the music are all WONDERFUL!In short, Mediterraneo is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!Strongly recommended along with Malena for the lovers of such films.",5,A movie worth watching!,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,1369,"['Definitely', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'Mediterraneo', 'screen', 'story', 'small', 'Italian', 'military', 'force', 'consisting', 'eight', 'men', 'Greece', 'WWII', 'one', 'islands', 'Subsequently', 'Italians', 'are', 'forced', 'interact', 'local', 'Greek', 'populace', 'everything', 'When', 'Germans', 'arrive', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'complicated', 'Mediterraneo', 'film', 'human', 'relations', 'such', 'concepts', 'hope', 'honor', 'inner', 'strength.Needless', 'say', 'actors', 'have', 'truly', 'outdone', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'exceptions', 'give', '100', '%', 'really', 'chemistry', 'AMAZING', 'Very', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'movie', 'doubt', 'guaranteed', 'provide', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'laughs', 'not', 'mention', 'few', 'tears', 'film', 'simple', 'enough', 'great', 'job', 'describing', 'people', 'day', 'problems', 'face', 'just', 'show', 'simplicity', 'often', 'far', 'better', 'complexity', 'when', 'trying', 'present', 'issues', 'human', 'nature.The', 'setting', 'plot', 'dialogues', 'humor', 'music', 'are', 'WONDERFUL', 'short', 'Mediterraneo', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'seriously', 'consider', 'adding', 'movie', 'collection', 'Strongly', 'recommended', 'Malena', 'lovers', 'such', 'films']",Mediterraneo VHS

327471,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,630267672X,Mr. Cairene,"[31, 33]","An eight man battalion is sent by the Italian army to secure a  strategically unimportant Greek island. When we first meet them they are  arguing about anything and everything. The first ten minutes of  Mediterraneo seem like a photograhped play, complete with oddball character  going head to head with each other in small, darkly lit sets. It is only  when these characters meet the locals that the film blossoms into a sunny,  lyrical  and strangely uplifiting experience.Most reviews have  described it as a comedy, since Mediterraneo offers us a soldier who goes  to war with a donkey called Silvana, an artistic battalion leader who would  rather paint a cathedral then display any kind of leadership and a  loud  sargent trying to hypnotise his fellow soldiers in a soccer game, I would  agree that it is a very funny film. But its more then that. With the help  of cinematographer Italo Petriccione, director Salvatores's film is like a  whimisical dream, a rose tinted memory. He seems aware that the virginal  romantic soldier and the prostitute with a heart of gold are cliches, but  in context of this picturesque little poem their romance made me  inexplicably and ridiculously happy.There is something enormously  endearing about the Italian language. Maybe its the way the words stretch  out, &quot;Medeeteryaano&quot;, that makes it seem so passionate. My  Italian is about as good as Roberto Benigni's English, but listening to the  language spoken by its native speakers is always a pleasure. It just seems  less cynical.The film made me believe that these men could forget  themselves for three years in the spiritual and sensual paradise they were  sent to conquer. Underscored with some incredibly beautiful bazouki music,  Mediterraneo possesses a giddy indescribable charm.",4,For Silvana,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,1796,"['eight', 'man', 'battalion', 'sent', 'Italian', 'army', 'secure', 'strategically', 'unimportant', 'Greek', 'island', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'are', 'arguing', 'anything', 'everything', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Mediterraneo', 'seem', 'photograhped', 'play', 'complete', 'oddball', 'character', 'going', 'head', 'head', 'other', 'small', 'darkly', 'lit', 'sets', 'only', 'when', 'characters', 'meet', 'locals', 'film', 'blossoms', 'sunny', 'lyrical', 'strangely', 'uplifiting', 'experience.Most', 'reviews', 'have', 'described', 'comedy', 'Mediterraneo', 'soldier', 'who', 'war', 'donkey', 'called', 'Silvana', 'artistic', 'battalion', 'leader', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'paint', 'cathedral', 'then', 'display', 'kind', 'leadership', 'loud', 'sargent', 'trying', 'hypnotise', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'soccer', 'game', 'would', 'agree', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'more', 'then', 'help', 'cinematographer', 'Italo', 'Petriccione', 'director', 'Salvatores', 'film', 'whimisical', 'dream', 'rose', 'tinted', 'memory', 'aware', 'virginal', 'romantic', 'soldier', 'prostitute', 'heart', 'gold', 'are', 'cliches', 'context', 'picturesque', 'little', 'poem', 'romance', 'made', 'inexplicably', 'ridiculously', 'something', 'enormously', 'endearing', 'Italian', 'language', 'way', 'words', 'stretch', 'out', 'quot', 'Medeeteryaano', 'quot', 'seem', 'so', 'passionate', 'Italian', 'as', 'good', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'English', 'listening', 'language', 'spoken', 'native', 'speakers', 'always', 'pleasure', 'just', 'less', 'cynical.The', 'film', 'made', 'believe', 'men', 'could', 'forget', 'three', 'years', 'spiritual', 'sensual', 'paradise', 'were', 'sent', 'conquer', 'Underscored', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'bazouki', 'music', 'Mediterraneo', 'giddy', 'indescribable', 'charm']",Mediterraneo VHS

327473,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,630267672X,Randy Keehn,"[5, 6]","""Mediterraneo"" is a FUN movie.  It's a very likeable story of a group of Italian marines who follow an assignment to occupy an obscure Greek Aegean island during the early period of WWII.  Due to a series of escapades, they lose their contact with the outside world.  Instead, they get caught up in their own little world for the next three years.  That may sound like a boring movie but things happen from time to time and the excerpts we see are generally pretty funny.  The different personalities emerge and their variety allows the writer and the actors plenty of room for development.  In the end, the marines are ""rescued"" by their new allies; the British.  Initially, all of the soldiers were focussed on getting out of this forsaken island.  In the end, the island had become their home and their ""rescue"" was a mixed blessing.  A post script ending brings the feeling together in a poignant way.The acting is very good although all of the actors and actresses were new to me.  I especially appreciated the character who played Sargeant Lo Russo.  The cinematography is excellent which helped to give the viewer a sense of paradise for these errant marines.  I found the movie to be a relaxing, humorous, touching experience.  I got used to the Italian with English subtitles with no problem and even got to where I could follow some of the dialogue without looking at the subtitles.  The movie won an Oscar, I believe, for Best Foreign Language film.  I've used that category to find a number of very good to excellent films that I probably would have never seen.
