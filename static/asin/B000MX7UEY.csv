I remember watching it as a child, and watching it on the Disney Channel, but I couldn't remember the title of it. Luckily, when I was looking through movies on Amazon.com, I saw the cover of the movie, and I knew what it was. I knew that if I didn't buy it now, the price would go up later. So, if you like movies that are like a cross between Narnia and the Goonies, you'd better buy this movie fast, because prices have gone up on Amazon lately.",4,I was glad to see it on DVD,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,562,"['once', 'tried', 'watch', 'youtube.com', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'show', 'remember', 'watching', 'child', 'watching', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'title', 'Luckily', 'when', 'was', 'looking', 'movies', 'Amazon.com', 'saw', 'cover', 'movie', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'now', 'price', 'would', 'go', 'up', 'later', 'So', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'cross', 'Narnia', 'Goonies', ""'d"", 'better', 'buy', 'movie', 'fast', 'prices', 'have', 'gone', 'up', 'Amazon', 'lately']",N/A

I saw it twice, once when it first aired and once after.  I had fond memories with OG but now this falls in the category of ""childhood things I should have left alone"".  That's not to say that my case is the norm.  But I've been revisiting a LOT of things from my childhood and it's been a near 100% success.  Unfortunately, this isn't what I consider a good nostalgic revisit.  Certainly not a total loss.  The voice work is great. The animation is okay, although the transfer here is minimal and details get a little lost among the lacking color, mugginess and slight out-of-focus nature of the image (that isn't to say this is a terrible transfer....just could be better with some cleanup).  The story is much more simple than I remember.  It definitely reminds me of stuff like The Goonies, which I still enjoy quite a lot.  Journey to the Center of the Earth, it is not.  But if you have younguns in the house you might get more enjoyment out of it than I did (youngun-less, just 2 dogs, one that often shows interest in TV but not on this..hee hee).I heard there was a redo of this in 2006.  Interesting.  Anyway, I do hope more of these ""Weekend Specials"" make it to DVD in the near future like they did with the Afterschool School specials.  I bought this and Cougar, another that aired on Weekend Specials.  The one I really want is the Soup shorts, Soup and Me ... Soup for President.  I have a feeling I'd still adore those like I once did.At any rate, I'm not upset that I spent the money on this.  It did bring back memories...so it did it's job.  :)",3,Time marches on...,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,1647,"['Bought', 'nostalgic', 'purposes', '41', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'remembered', 'teens', 'saw', 'twice', 'once', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'once', 'had', 'fond', 'memories', 'OG', 'now', 'category', 'childhood', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'alone', 'not', 'say', 'case', 'norm', ""'ve"", 'been', 'revisiting', 'LOT', 'things', 'childhood', 'been', 'near', '100', '%', 'success', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'what', 'consider', 'good', 'nostalgic', 'revisit', 'Certainly', 'not', 'total', 'loss', 'voice', 'work', 'great', 'animation', 'okay', 'transfer', 'here', 'minimal', 'details', 'get', 'little', 'lost', 'lacking', 'color', 'mugginess', 'slight', 'out-of-focus', 'nature', 'image', ""n't"", 'say', 'terrible', 'transfer', '.just', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'cleanup', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'remember', 'definitely', 'stuff', 'Goonies', 'still', 'enjoy', 'quite', 'lot', 'Journey', 'Center', 'Earth', 'not', 'have', 'younguns', 'house', 'might', 'get', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'did', 'youngun-less', 'just', '2', 'dogs', 'one', 'often', 'interest', 'TV', 'not', 'this..hee', 'hee', 'was', 'redo', '2006', 'Interesting', 'Anyway', 'do', 'hope', 'more', 'Weekend', 'Specials', 'make', 'DVD', 'near', 'future', 'did', 'Afterschool', 'School', 'specials', 'bought', 'Cougar', 'aired', 'Weekend', 'Specials', 'one', 'really', 'want', 'Soup', 'shorts', 'Soup', 'Me', 'Soup', 'President', 'have', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'still', 'adore', 'once', 'did.At', 'rate', ""'m"", 'not', 'upset', 'spent', 'money', 'did', 'bring', 'back', 'memories', 'did', 'job']",N/A

The movie has 3 parts to it and brings back so many memories.  I could not remember the name for years, other than the little green guys keep saying the same word, ""Og"".  Finally after numerous searches I found the Secret World of Og.The movie is separated into three parts, and runs credits for each even if you choose ""play all"".  There was a hitch in the disc in that I wanted to watch only the first segment, and choose ""Play 1"" and right before the end of the segment it went back to the main menu.Great movie for kids with action, adventure, and fun.  There are a few scary moments, but quicker get resolved.  Think of this show as Alice in Wonderland ala green little people.  As an adult I still love it, glad I bought it, and think the writers must have enjoyed whatever Lewis Carroll was smoking. *S*",5,Just as Good as When I was a Kid,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,905,"['kid', 'would', 'catch', 'one', 'segments', 'movie', 'tv', 'always', 'missed', 'ending', 'movie', '3', 'parts', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'could', 'not', 'remember', 'name', 'years', 'other', 'little', 'green', 'guys', 'keep', 'saying', 'same', 'word', 'Og', 'Finally', 'numerous', 'searches', 'found', 'Secret', 'World', 'Og.The', 'movie', 'separated', 'three', 'parts', 'credits', 'even', 'choose', 'play', 'was', 'hitch', 'disc', 'wanted', 'watch', 'only', 'first', 'segment', 'choose', 'Play', '1', 'right', 'end', 'segment', 'went', 'back', 'main', 'menu.Great', 'movie', 'kids', 'action', 'adventure', 'fun', 'are', 'few', 'scary', 'moments', 'quicker', 'get', 'resolved', 'Think', 'show', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'ala', 'green', 'little', 'people', 'adult', 'still', 'love', 'bought', 'think', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'was', 'smoking', '*S*']",N/A

I thought it would be would be more of a movie when the kids had to help the green people save there home from the forces of evil.  but it was really teaching the green people to get out more and not have to learn things from comic books all the time.

1051606,A2AYI0LBQYGK1G,B000MX7UEY,M. McCollum,"[0, 0]","I remember watching this special one weekend and being so captivated by it that its imagery stuck with me for nearly 30 years.  I never forgot the magical world that existed underneath the playhouse of a normal family neighborhood.  It was so creative and is still somewhat entertaining to watch, in a nostalgic way.  The twist of the little green men from the secret world of OG being compulsive hoarders of comic books is something only the mind of Mark Evanier would think to add to this tale.  I'm glad to see that this cartoon has been preserved and made available to those who are interested.  The only let down is the actual performance of the DVD.  It seems to jump around in the story and skip over certain parts at random, so that each viewing can be a little different.  The ""chapters"" offered aren't really chapters and if you assume you are viewing the entire story by watching each chapter you will be missing out.  The other viewing option is to watch the entire story in one sitting.  You pretty much see the complete story this way.  Long story short, some more care and thought could have definitely been given to the production of the DVD to do justice to the Secret World of OG.",3,A hard-to-find cartoon cult classic,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,1198,"['remember', 'watching', 'special', 'one', 'weekend', 'being', 'so', 'captivated', 'imagery', 'stuck', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'never', 'forgot', 'magical', 'world', 'existed', 'playhouse', 'normal', 'family', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'so', 'creative', 'still', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'nostalgic', 'way', 'twist', 'little', 'green', 'men', 'secret', 'world', 'OG', 'being', 'compulsive', 'hoarders', 'comic', 'books', 'something', 'only', 'mind', 'Mark', 'Evanier', 'would', 'think', 'add', 'tale', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'cartoon', 'been', 'preserved', 'made', 'available', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'only', 'let', 'down', 'actual', 'performance', 'DVD', 'jump', 'around', 'story', 'skip', 'certain', 'parts', 'random', 'viewing', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'different', 'chapters', 'offered', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'chapters', 'assume', 'are', 'viewing', 'entire', 'story', 'watching', 'chapter', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'other', 'viewing', 'option', 'watch', 'entire', 'story', 'one', 'sitting', 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'complete', 'story', 'way', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'more', 'care', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'definitely', 'been', 'given', 'production', 'DVD', 'do', 'justice', 'Secret', 'World', 'OG']",N/A
1051607,AZP335D31XNA7,B000MX7UEY,RetroMan,"[0, 0]","The Secret World of OG is a sorta lost 80s Hanna Barbera animated treasure that is worth re-visiting. The music is wonderful and the animation though dated is still detailed and gives you a feel of what H-B in 80s was about. This special was actually animated by Southern Star Animation which was a Hanna Barbera subsidy studio based in Australia that also animated 80s cartoons like Teen Wolf, Bernstein bears and CBS Storybreak.OG aired as part of the ABC Weekend Specials which was full of gems that have yet to be released on dvd fully, due to licensing issues the series will probably never be released in seasons and just come out individually as has been the case with what few shows have seen a dvd release. You had to wait each week to see all three parts of OG and it left you hanging each week to see what would happen next. The big issue this dvd has is quality control, the 3 parts option on the dvd should show you each episode as it aired without the commercials of course, but what you get it just a small part of the episode themselves which makes no sense at all. Who knows if they ran out of space on the dvd and had to cut the single episodes short. It's a real lack of quality control and the only way to see all three episodes is to press the play all option. It would have made complete sense to have play all option play the three parts like a movie, removing the end credits and preview before each episode so it plays like a full movie. Then leave the parts with the preview before the episode starts and the end credits for each episode like it originally aired. It's not rocket science but all in all I am just glad this cult classic actually made it to dvd and we can all see it again and share it to a new generation. CBS Storybreak was a similar series and also really needs a dvd release one day. Despite a bit of quality control I was very glad to have this dvd and overlooked the single parts option flaw and just watched the play all option!Cougar seems like the only other ABC weekend special to come out in region 1 and in region 2 Lochnagar came out there.
