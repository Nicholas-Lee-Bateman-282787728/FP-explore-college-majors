(Whew. I know that last sentence was lousy grammar but I love this film!) The formula for this film is pretty standard--underdog/renegade servicemen show they're superior to the narrow-minded, know-it-all brass. Brings to mind McHale's Navy, Operation Petticoat, Mr. Roberts, and other classics in this style. I found this film to be a comedy upgrade on every one of those greats. Kelsey Grammer is a highly creative submarine tactician whose ideas have got him frowned upon by Admiral Bruce Dern and smiled upon by Admiral Rip Torn. They knock heads over Captain Grammer and decided to put him to the test. He's to participate in war games that will decide his future as a submarine captain. His naval opponents are the best crews, submarines and warships of the modern navy, while he gets a diesel-class sub from the 1950's and the usual navy misfits and trouble-makers for his own crew. Failure on the horizon? Hardly. Grammer is hilariously upbeat, and his crew's individual oddball traits are fuel for running gags that never get old the entire course of the film. There's a radioman who's had one too many shocks to the brain and has become a human electricity conductor, a sonar man who can hear change drop on a dock while he's 30 feet below the surface, an alcoholic engineer who uses his whiskey to power the vessel, a flatulent cook and a bipolar first mate--that's just a few. It's a full crew of people like this, and they are all packed into an old sub and turned loose on the ocean and the modern navy.

401553,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,6304107641,Brent Butler,"[3, 3]","""Down Periscope"" is the story of a naval officer with a troubled career past who is given a chance at redemption. All he has to do is take a green and misfit crew into an obsolete submarine, and beat a fleet of the US Navy's finest, up to date warships! With unorthodox tactics fueled by the off the wall behavior of his crew, he of course makes this ""no win"" scenario highly competitive.This film was a big surprise for me. The cast looks primed for sort of a dumb comedy with the potential to be more irritating than funny. For a feature film, it is rather low budget, putting together TV stars with career long supporting acting from film. Still, it had Kelsey Grammar, who has never failed to come through. Joining him was Lauren Holly (Picket Fences), Rob Schneider (with his own set of over the top comedies, such as ""Deuce Bigalow"", Bruce Dern, Rip Torn, William H. Macy, and others.Luckily for everyone, the chemistry was there. The performances (and many of the jokes) are broad, as they needed to be for this movie to succeed. Rob Schneider is really the only actor that goes over the top, with the consequence that he was forced to ""walk the plank""! The cast took this film seriously and provided strong performances in each circumstance, and the result is a very entertaining comedy. I didn't personally find any ""laugh out loud"" moments, but I found myself consistently amused and interested.Don't miss the end credits, which contain a music video of the cast performing antics to Men at Work's famous song, ""In the Navy"".

But wait, as the widescreen version (both are allegedly included on the DVD) played, it didn't look right to me.  I started flipping between the widescreen and standard versions, and it confirmed my worst fears: THE STUDIO CARVED THE WIDESCREEN VERSION OUT OF THE STANDARD VERSION!  I have never seen this done before on DVD.  You will see the tops of everybody's heads cut off in the opening scenes.  Later in the movie when captain Kelsey Grammar accuses dive officer Lauren Holly of being &quot;almost out of uniform,&quot; the joke is completely ruined by the cropped view of Holly's uniform.  This magnifying of the screen lowers the contrast and makes it look grainy.  Did the studio think we wouldn't notice?  I think this really shows contempt for us, the customers.  When I buy a widescreen DVD, I expect to see what I saw in the theater!  But here, you'll see more by watching the standard version.  This is inexcusable.The audio is presented in 5.1, which adds a great deal to this movie.  However, better use could have been made of the surround speakers; the background is not well separated.Now the movie:  Kelsey Grammar is a &quot;think outside the box&quot; naval officer given command of the Stingray, a World War II Vallejo class Diesel sub.  His assignment is to try to outwit the nuclear navy and run a blockade.  To sabotage his efforts, Admiral Bruce Dern gives him the worst crew he can find including diving officer Holly, sonar man Harlan Williams, and an electrician who's taken &quot;a lot of volts.&quot;  Down Periscope was sunk by the critics when it came out--Roger Ebert put it on his worst of the year list.  The humor is sophomoric and silly, and therein lies the charm of this movie.  It has a good heart.  Grammer is perfect as a goofball captain who is really very, very good at his job.  This is kind of movie that will either work on you or it won't.  If you like silly movies, give Down Periscope a shot.  As for the butchering of the widescreen version of this movie on the DVD, let's hope this doesn't start a trend.",3,The Studio Must Think We're Idiots,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,2199,"['love', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', '20', 'times', 'tape', 'least', 'So', 'when', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'morning', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'put', 'player', 'wait', 'widescreen', 'version', 'are', 'allegedly', 'included', 'DVD', 'played', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'started', 'flipping', 'widescreen', 'standard', 'versions', 'confirmed', 'worst', 'fears', 'STUDIO', 'CARVED', 'THE', 'WIDESCREEN', 'VERSION', 'OUT', 'THE', 'STANDARD', 'VERSION', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'done', 'DVD', 'will', 'see', 'tops', 'everybody', 'heads', 'cut', 'off', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Later', 'movie', 'when', 'captain', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'dive', 'officer', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'being', 'quot', 'almost', 'uniform', 'quot', 'joke', 'completely', 'ruined', 'cropped', 'view', 'Holly', 'uniform', 'magnifying', 'screen', 'contrast', 'look', 'grainy', 'Did', 'studio', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'think', 'really', 'contempt', 'customers', 'When', 'buy', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'expect', 'see', 'what', 'saw', 'theater', 'here', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'watching', 'standard', 'version', 'inexcusable.The', 'audio', 'presented', '5.1', 'great', 'deal', 'movie', 'However', 'better', 'use', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'surround', 'speakers', 'background', 'not', 'well', 'separated.Now', 'movie', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'quot', 'think', 'box', 'quot', 'naval', 'officer', 'given', 'command', 'Stingray', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Vallejo', 'class', 'Diesel', 'sub', 'assignment', 'try', 'outwit', 'nuclear', 'navy', 'run', 'blockade', 'sabotage', 'efforts', 'Admiral', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'worst', 'crew', 'can', 'find', 'including', 'diving', 'officer', 'Holly', 'sonar', 'man', 'Harlan', 'Williams', 'electrician', 'who', 'taken', 'quot', 'lot', 'volts.', 'quot', 'Down', 'Periscope', 'was', 'sunk', 'critics', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'put', 'worst', 'year', 'list', 'humor', 'sophomoric', 'silly', 'therein', 'charm', 'movie', 'good', 'heart', 'Grammer', 'perfect', 'goofball', 'captain', 'who', 'really', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'either', 'work', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'silly', 'movies', 'give', 'Down', 'Periscope', 'shot', 'butchering', 'widescreen', 'version', 'movie', 'DVD', 'let', 'hope', ""n't"", 'start', 'trend']",Down Periscope VHS

He is up for promotion and his own submarine command, but due to his past history, including an incident where, intoxicated, he got a tattoo on his private parts, he has incurred the enmity of one member of the board, RADM Yancey Graham (Bruce Dern), who opposes his promotion.Dodge is given a command, but of an old WWII biesel rustbucket,the U.S.S. Stingray, and ordered to take part in an exercise pitted against the nuclear navy, to see if an old diesel sub, in the wrong hands, could get by our modern defenses and sink a target vessel in Norfolk harnor.

Kelsey does a bang-up job as the confident, sure-footed decision-maker, Captain Dodge (famous for getting drunk, passing out, and waking up with a tattoo on his hoo-hoo) who is assigned as commander of an ancient, rust-encrusted submarine. To complete the really bad assignment, Captain Dodge is given a, shall we say, ""most unusual"" crew, comprised of a man called Sonar, whose hearing is way past exceptional (when some coins are dropped on the floor of another submarine, he is able to determine that somebody just dropped 45 cents - he can also imitate whale-talk); the son of an Admiral who only wants to be kicked out of the navy; a loud-mouthed subordinate who tries to take over the submarine, only to be charged with mutiny, and what follows is a hysterically funny scene where he is made to walk the plank; and the ships electrician, who spends much of his time getting electrical shocks from the bad wiring, and sundry other characters, including Lauren Holly, as the only female aboard.  Bruce Dern portrays an Admiral who hates Captain Dodge, and plots to make his life as difficult as possible.This is one of the few films I've ever watched that I didn't want to end because it is so much fun, but the great sing-along as the ending credits roll should not be missed.",5,Too Good To Miss.....,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,1523,"['ordered', 'DVD', 'loved', 'Frasier', 'television', 'program', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'much', 'anything', 'other', 'comedy', 'movie', 'laugh', 'riot', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'portraying', 'character', 'completely', 'Frasier', 'Kelsey', 'bang-up', 'job', 'confident', 'sure-footed', 'decision-maker', 'Captain', 'Dodge', 'famous', 'getting', 'drunk', 'passing', 'out', 'waking', 'up', 'tattoo', 'hoo-hoo', 'who', 'assigned', 'commander', 'ancient', 'rust-encrusted', 'submarine', 'complete', 'really', 'bad', 'assignment', 'Captain', 'Dodge', 'given', 'shall', 'say', 'most', 'unusual', 'crew', 'comprised', 'man', 'called', 'Sonar', 'hearing', 'way', 'past', 'exceptional', 'when', 'coins', 'are', 'dropped', 'floor', 'submarine', 'able', 'determine', 'somebody', 'just', 'dropped', '45', 'cents', 'can', 'also', 'imitate', 'whale-talk', 'son', 'Admiral', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'kicked', 'navy', 'loud-mouthed', 'subordinate', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'submarine', 'only', 'be', 'charged', 'mutiny', 'what', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'made', 'walk', 'plank', 'ships', 'electrician', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'getting', 'electrical', 'shocks', 'bad', 'wiring', 'sundry', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'only', 'female', 'aboard', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Admiral', 'who', 'Captain', 'Dodge', 'plots', 'make', 'life', 'as', 'difficult', 'possible.This', 'one', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'great', 'sing-along', 'ending', 'credits', 'roll', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Down Periscope VHS

The comments about ""polishing the ol' torpedo"" and ""You're almost out of uniform, ensign,"" were worth the price of the flick by themselves. And the rest of the crew did a good job too, mostly unknowns who seemed to get into the spirit of the whole comedic farce as well.

401664,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,6304107641,Marshall Lord,"[1, 1]","I had been told that this screwball naval comedy included every submarine film cliche known to man, and noted that it had not been a particularly huge hit when it came out ten years ago. But as the hero was played by Kelsey Grammer (Frasier) I thought it would be worth picking up a pre-viewed copy to throw into my computer drive to enliven the last 90 minutes of a four-hour train journey.In the event this film was vastly better than I had expected and the other passengers must have wondered what I was laughing at.Grammer plays Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge, a highly talented but utterly unconventional submarine officer whose sense of humour and far from by-the-book attitudes have placed him in grave danger of being passed over for command of his own boat. The film opens with a fierce debate at a promotion board,at which Rear Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern) who has taken a particular dislike to Dodge, argues that he is too maverick a personality to be trusted with command of a nuclear submarine.But there is a compromise on offer. Graham's superior, Vice Admiral Winslow (Rip Torn) who is not quite so prejudiced against unconventional officers if they get the job done, has noticed that the former Soviet Union is selling off old diesel summarines in job lots to tin-pot unstable countries like Iran and Iraq. (Quite a prescient point given that this film was made five years before 9/11).Admiral Winslow wants to test the possibility that the ultra-sophisticated high tech units deployed to defend the US coast against equally sophisticated attackers might make mistakes if faced with a much lower tech but crafty opponent - particularly if the enemy captain is highly unconventional or, in his words ""a pirate.""So they give Dodge command of an ancient rustbucket of a diesel submarine called ""Stingray"" and invite him to see if he can get past all the much better equipped defenders of two key naval bases.Admiral Winslow has a soft spot for Dodge, and gives him a green light to ignore the rules the way a real rogue attacker would; Admiral Graham is determined to humiliate him and does his best to make the Stingray's task ""Mission Impossible."" He starts by assigning Dodge a ""crew from hell"" of oddballs and misfits. These include a mad martinet, Martin Pascal (Rod Schneider) as his XO, and Lieutenant Emily Lake, (Lauren Holly), the first woman ever to serve as diving officer on a US submarine but who has no previous experience outside a simulator. Almost all of the crew have a combination of strengths and weaknesses - for example the sonarman, nicknamed ""Sonar"" (Harland Williams) has absurdly good hearing but is a very odd character and rather too prone to saying what he thinks. (Fortunately for the Stingray, Sonar's last captain got rid of him despite his enormous skill at the job because he thought Sonar was a security risk). Other members of the misfit crew are played by Harry Dean Stanton, Ken Hudson Campbell, Toby Huss, Duane Martin, Jonathan Penner, and Bradford Tatum, and they work together brilliantly - the cast obviously had a lot of fun making this.Tom Dodge has to weld his peculiar crew into a team and take on an opposition which is determined not to give him an even break. He tries every trick that's not in the book to get past them ...Apart from the crew of Stingray and the two admirals, one other performance of note in the film is given by William H Macy as Captain Knox of the USS Orlando, which was Tom Dodge's last sub before being given command of the Stingray. The Stingray keeps running into the Orlando and having to get past her on her way to the objectives of the exercise. Macy gives a brilliantly understated performance as a competent but unimaginative officer who has to display great reserves of self-control as he keeps falling foul of Dodge's maverick tricks. But you have to feel sympathy for Captain Knox as he holds on to his professionalism - something at which Admiral Graham is rather less successful ...There are a fair number of things in this film which could only ever happen in Hollywood and not in real life, but although it is very funny and silly, you can suspend your disbelief most of the time.I found this film laugh-out-loud funny and srongly recommend it.P.S. Don't turn your DVD player off as soon as the credits start to roll - there is an amusing comic video clip accompanying the credits and cast list which is worth watching and listening to. It shows Kelsey Grammer as Dodge peering through the periscope at various cast members including himself (double take), Annie Talbot in her underwear, and some highly musical ""singing sailors"" who I think are actually pop stars, dancing around the deck of the Stingray.",5,Highly amusing nautical comedy,1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,4707,"['had', 'been', 'told', 'screwball', 'naval', 'comedy',

This is the classic story of the British naval novel translated to the American submarine fleet: i.e. the unconventional officer shows his worth, captures the hearts of his crew and wins promotion due to tactical brilliance against long odds.Kelsey Grammer plays Captain Tom Dodge, a naval officer with a black mark on his record who has had the misfortune to earn the enmity of a two-star Admiral who is blocking his promotion. Dodge is given the command of a rust-bucket sub dating from World War II and secret orders to ""think like a pirate"" during a war game exercise in which he is to play the part of a renegade enemy sub. The goal he is given is to attack first Charleston and then a dummy naval ship at Norfolk.Naturally the crew he is given is a crowd of screw-ups, cut-ups, misfits and one woman, Lt. Emily Lake, who is part of a pilot program to see if women can serve on submarines. It is as if DAS BOOT just became ""Dat Booty"". The each member of the crew is given individual comic solo turns, each more funny than the last. The deadpan timing and talent assembled here make this rust bucket sub excursion more fun than a barrel of monkeys.When this movie first came out, it didn't receive the attention it deserved. This might be because Kelsey Grammer was a TV star who didn't translate well to the big screen. It might also be because the military was not in such high favor--the movie was ahead of its time. The film almost sunk without a trace, but I recommend it highly for home viewing.

Ward. While it's competent, he makes the mistake of going for the cheap laugh with too many silly shots of the various crew members taking clownlike falls while mugging for the camera, which is unfortunate since the cast is full of very good and funny character actors that I've seen a lot funnier in other movies. Kelsey Grammar handles his role extremely well, stepping away from Frasier and jumping into the role of Lt. Commander Thomas Dodge like a tailor-made suit and letting the goofy side of the character shine with just the right amount of restraint to keep it from becoming clownish. It's really good to see him stretch a bit with this role, which is about as far from Frasier as I've ever seen him go. Grammer is an excellent actor (even though the only roles I'm familiar with him doing are Fraiser Crane, which he not only invented but absolutely owns, Sideshow Bob [which is sort of a Frasier variation], and this) and he does a great job with the role - he isn't happy with his assignment but does his best because of his sense of duty. He's wise enough to know how to handle the motley crew he's given and experienced enough to know how to fulfill his assignment. The cliches fly pretty thick, but Grammer keeps everything on an even keel. Rob Schneider, however... I'm going to assume it was Ward who instructed him to act as over-the-top as he does, but his constant screaming and calling the crew members ""retard"" gets old very fast. It's a workmanlike comedy and is satisfying on its own level. And, like I said, it's great to see Kelsey Grammer do something new.",3,"Not bad, but not great",1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,1732,"['movie', 'good', 'premise', 'excellent', 'cast', 'had', 'name', 'what', 'exactly', 'wrong', ""'d"", 'point', 'direction', 'David', 'S.', 'Ward', 'competent', 'mistake', 'going', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'too', 'many', 'silly', 'shots', 'various', 'crew', 'members', 'taking', 'clownlike', 'falls', 'mugging', 'camera', 'unfortunate', 'cast', 'full', 'very', 'good', 'funny', 'character', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'funnier', 'other', 'movies', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'role', 'extremely', 'well', 'stepping', 'away', 'Frasier', 'jumping', 'role', 'Lt', 'Commander', 'Thomas', 'Dodge', 'tailor-made', 'suit', 'letting', 'goofy', 'side', 'character', 'shine', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'restraint', 'keep', 'becoming', 'clownish', 'really', 'good', 'see', 'stretch', 'bit', 'role', 'far', 'Frasier', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'go', 'Grammer', 'excellent', 'actor', 'even', 'only', 'roles', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'doing', 'are', 'Fraiser', 'Crane', 'not', 'only', 'invented', 'absolutely', 'Sideshow', 'Bob', '[', 'sort', 'Frasier', 'variation', ']', 'great', 'job', 'role', ""n't"", 'happy', 'assignment', 'best', 'sense', 'duty', 'wise', 'enough', 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'motley', 'crew', 'given', 'experienced', 'enough', 'know', 'how', 'fulfill', 'assignment', 'cliches', 'fly', 'pretty', 'thick', 'Grammer', 'everything', 'even', 'keel', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'however', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'was', 'Ward', 'who', 'instructed', 'act', 'as', 'over-the-top', 'constant', 'screaming', 'calling', 'crew', 'members', 'retard', 'old', 'very', 'fast', 'workmanlike', 'comedy', 'satisfying', 'own', 'level', 'said', 'great', 'see', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'do', 'something', 'new']",Down Periscope VHS

Considering this was Kelsey Grammer's first starring movie, I was very curious (as a great fan of Frasier) but cautious.  No need to be.  Hugh Wilson's script was as good as we could have asked for, and Grammer pulled off one of his best acting experiences in his career...believable, intelligent, funny, and on the mark.  To stop the review here would not do justice, though.Let's begin with the actors.  What an amazing cast!  First, you have Rip Torn, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Dern, and William H. Macy...these are heavyweights in the acting world and boy do they come through.  Bruce Dern is especially good playing real jerks and this is no exception.  The remaining cast includes Lauren Hotty...er Holly, Rob Schneider (giving a solid, give-it-all-you-got performance), Ken Hudson Campbell, and Harland Williams (always funny...check out the movie ROCKETMAN if you love off-the-wall humor).Then there's the sea-going action.  As a real fan of submarine movies (another reason I was cautious of this movie at first), I was blown away at the amount of attention to detail they gave to this part of the film.  Since it was a comedy, they could have just given scant attention to the action part of it and left it to dialogue to carry the movie.  But no!  They went all out and gave the viewer a wonderful action movie to boot (of course not Das Boot, the great submarine film...).  Anyway, the bottomline is that folks that like this genre won't be disappointed.When you get a chance, watch this film.  As one that would like to buy a Special Edition DVD in widescreen of this movie, I know I will be disappointed since I doubt it will ever materialize.

401715,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6304107641,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 6]","Kelsey Grammer is Tom Dodge, the sit-com producer's idea of nuclear submarine commander.  Passed over for promotion repeatedly in the past, he has languished as the executive officer of other-people's subs.  When he is passed over again, a sympathetic admiral (Rip Torn) comes up with an idea to save Dodge's career while enhancing his own pet project.  Dumbfounded that he is now to get command of his own boat (Dodge's then-superior is a bit dumbfounded himself, and decodes Dodge's promotion papers twice) he is shocked to find that his new command is actually a mothballed and rust-coated WWII relic.  The diesel-powered USS Stingray looks like a fossil from the days of the Monitor and the Merrimack, but it's the ""perfect"" sample target for a nuclear navy in the post-Soviet years.  (US submariners had spent much of their career training to find and fight other nuclear subs rather than the non-nuclear boats which actually comprise the majority of the world's submarine fleets; diesel-electric subs lack the extensive pumping systems used in nuclear plants, which makes them inherently quieter and harder to track.  They are also cheaper to operate and acquire which, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, makes them possible tools for terrorists).Getting little support from the higher-ups for his end of Rip Torn's wargames, Dodge culls together a rogue-crew: a compulsively angry XO (Rob Schneider), a demented chief engineer (Harry Dean Stanton), a less-than stellar diving officer (Lauren Holly - who also becomes the subject of the misfit crew's many pranks) and various other second-string sailors.  As the Stingray takes to the sea, it finds itself the quarry of the modern nuclear navy, barely keeping itself undetected (quick action saves the day).  As Stingray succeeds, another admiral (played by Bruce Dern) decides to take command of the entire operation, less obsessed with Dodge's cranky sub than Dodge himself.""Down"" is a fun though not hysterical flick.  Kelsey Grammer is actually quite good (I've never caught his show) as a sub driver, and watching it you begin to wonder how much better the flick could have been if it wasn't just played for laughs - a sort of advfenture movie that was also funny (the flick is actually light on the laughs as it is).  A bunch of ex-sub drivers could have gotten together to craft a story that didn't need to be an extended episode of ""McHale's Navy"".  Though hardly the most realistic submarine movie ever made, the plot dealing with nuts-and-bolts of submarine life were actually more fun than the jokes.

401716,A1VSB17UK2H4S4,6304107641,Roy Jaruk,"[9, 11]","In the World War II comedy Operation Petticoat, sub skipper Captain Matt Sherman (Cary Grant) had the challenge of trying to get the USS Sea Tiger, badly damaged alongside the dock in the Phillipines in a Japanese air raid, ready for sea with a paucity of spare parts, a misogynistic Chief Motor Machinist's Mate, a neurotic ship's yeoman, a ship's cook who is not only an escaped prisoner but also a Marine, and a green as grass lieutenant (jg) who is the biggest con man and scrounger in the Pacific Fleet. Once his boat is halfway seaworthy, Captain Sherman must successfully sail the crippled Sea Tiger to safety in Australia, with half a dozen Army nurses and a bunch of Filipino women and children as passengers, while both sides are hunting for him.  Quite a challenge.His modern-day successor is Captain Thomas Dodge of the USS Stingray (Kelsey Grammer), who while not facing depth charges and strafing runs from an armed enemy, has equally daunting challenges of his own.The premise of the comedy Down Priscope is a question actually raised in the 1990s by the United States Navy.  The Russians at the time were selling off Soviet-era diesel submarines to anyone who had the money to pay for them.  Most of the buyers were not and aren't friends of ours. The question the Navy needed to answer was, ""Could a diesel boat with a smart, resourceful, daring skipper and a dedicated crew penetrate American harbors and sink ships here - or maybe plant an atomic bomb?""  This was not (and still isn't) an idle question.  In real life, the Navy studied the matter and concluded no diesel-powered pigboat had a prayer of actually carrying out such a mission successfully.  The suggestion that the Navy buy or borrow a diesel sub and test the hypothesis was not followed through.In David S. Ward's comedy, however, it is.Lt. Commander Tom Dodge, executive officer of the USS Orlando, is between a rock and a hard place, career-wise.  He has a reputation in the submarine force as a maverick and unorthodox officer whose antics sometimes border on the foolhardy.  He has been recommended for command of his own nuclear attack sub twice before and not been selected for command.  If he's passed over again, it's '3 strikes and you're out.'  His captain, Carl Knox (well played by William H. Macy), has written a fitness report on Dodge that should see him moldering away behind a desk ashore until he retires.  Both are surprised when Dodge is ordered to take command of his own boat.Vice Admiral Dean Winslow (Rip Torn, in a small but powerful performance), Commander of Submarines Atlantic Fleet, handpicks Dodge for a very special mission.  He is to recommission the USS Stingray, a late-World War II Balao-class diesel submarine last upgraded in 1958, and see whether the conventional wisdom of the Navy - that a diesel sub hasn't a prayer of sneaking into a U.S. harbor without getting caught - is correct.  He tells Dodge, ""Don't go by the book. Think like a pirate.""  Dodge still is reluctant to take the job, but he and COMSUBLANT set up a side bet.  Winslow gives Dodge two live Mark 37 torpedoes (obsolete by current standards but good fish in their day) and anchors a target ship outside Norfolk Harbor.  If Dodge can manage to sneak past the Navy ships trying to find him and sink the target ship, they'll talk about Dodge taking command of a nuclear sub.Rear Admiral Yancey Graham (Bruce Dern) is commanding the defenders in the war game.  He is no fan of Tom Dodge's, has never lost a war game, and does everything he can to stack the deck in his own favor.  He assigns Captain Dodge a hand-picked crew.The Stingray gets a psychotic executive officer; a retired diesel chief engineer recalled to active duty, who looks and acts like a beach bum - until the chips are down; the most insolent Motor Machinists Mate First Class you can imagine, a self-avowed pain in the neck who still has some growing up to do; a ship's electrician who is a walking example of why electroshock therapy has been outlawed; and a dive officer, Lt. Emily Lake (Lauren Holly), who is a test case to see if women can successfully serve in submarines - and while she's a qualified Surface Warfare Officer, she has absolutely no experience in submarines.Dodge also gets an ace in the hole Graham probably never intended to give him: A sonarman with ears like a bat who speaks Humpback.  He's a weirdo, but a genius with the listening gear.  All things considered, the Stingray could do worse.Dodge puts his boat back in commission and refits her, and then the games begin.  I'll not give away the details, but Tom Dodge has some moves worthy of Mush Morton, Red Ramage and Gene Fluckey. He isn't above stealing a couple of pages from Admiral Dan Gallery's books either as he faces off against his old skipper in the USS Orlando.  Things get interesting enough that Admiral Graham decides to get involved personally, putting his own service reputation and career advancement on the line.Who will win in the end?  Watch the movie and find out. Be prepared to be entertained as the end credits roll by the Village People's rock video of their hit, ""In the Navy.""  That alone would make the DVD worth buying.  However, this movie entertains in and of itself.  Down Periscope belongs in the collection of anyone who likes submarine movies.I strongly suspect that if Matt Sherman of the USS Sea Tiger and Tom Dodge of the USS Stingray ever got together over a couple of beers at the Officer's Club, they'd find a whole lot to talk about.  Down Periscope is a worthy successor to Operation Petticoat in the ship-based comedy genre, and we owe David S.

Commander Thomas Dodge, a man who's spotty military record and unorthodox style, has him on the verge of being washed out of the Navy's command program.  Over the objections of Rear Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern), Dodge is awarded the command of the USS Stingray, an ancient diesel powered submarine, manned by a crew of less than top line sailors, headed by the excitable Lt. Martin Pascal (Rob Schneider), and an untested female dive officer Lt. Emily Lake (Lauren Holly).Vice Admiral Winslow (Rip Torn) assigns Dodge the task of testing the US Navy's capability to respond to the threat posed by a diesel sub.  Among others, Dodge finds himself pitted against the USS Orlando, a top of the line nuclear sub under Commander Knox (William H. Macy), Dodge's ex-CO.  Mostly due to Dodge's unorthodox methods, the Stingray completes its mission, much to the dismay of Admiral Graham, who later assumes active command of the operation against Dodge.Kelsey Grammer is likable as the commander of this feel good affair, that doesn't press too hard to be funny, and really doesn't have many big laughs.
