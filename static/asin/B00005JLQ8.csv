603063,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JLQ8,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 0]","(3 1/2 *'s) The second of Tim Allen's `Santa Clause' series, we find a holiday film that is brisker, sweeter, and more eventful than its predecessor.  Between Director Michael Lembeck's laudable ability to keep the story at a proper pace, this yuletide misadventure flies with greater trajectory and a more cohesive sense of purpose.  Despite the TV nature of the comedy, five screenwriters bring real heart and humor to the hearth in a venue that brings some hearty ""Ho, Ho, Ho's"" to one's belly as well as some tears to  one's eyes.  Sweet enough to move with enough real life resonance to prevent it from being a hollow confection, `Santa Clause 2' really delivers.This time Scott Calvin (Allen) has settled in at the Santa helm only to find the finer print of his business card contract requires him to have a ""Mrs. Claus(e)"" by Christmas Eve.  To deliver, he must deliver...In the meantime, he discovers his resentful son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd) has gotten himself on the naughty list.  Returning to his original southern latitude, he tries to get quality time with his son and find a suitor who will keep him suited.  If this weren't enough, he has to cheer up a jaded principal, Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell) and rekindle the Christmas spirit at Charlie`s school. To keep the North Pole in order, Chief Elf Bernard (David Krumholtz) and his first mate, Curtis resort to ingenuity by cloning Santa with wickedly mutant results.  Will Santa deliver the toys on time for Christmas Eve and win on all fronts?  'Santa Clause 2' charmed me with its resolutions.While it is descriptions of this movie series that has kept me away so long, it is the execution with the aforementioned use of the writers' wit and the director's wisdom that makes this movie higher on my holiday ""favorites"" list.",4,"Oh, What Fun It Is To Ride in Santa's One Reindeer Sleigh...Ayyy!",1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1795,"['3', '1/2', '*', 'second', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'series', 'find', 'holiday', 'film', 'brisker', 'sweeter', 'more', 'eventful', 'predecessor', 'Between', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Lembeck', 'laudable', 'ability', 'keep', 'story', 'proper', 'pace', 'yuletide', 'misadventure', 'flies', 'greater', 'trajectory', 'more', 'cohesive', 'sense', 'purpose', 'TV', 'nature', 'comedy', 'five', 'screenwriters', 'bring', 'real', 'heart', 'humor', 'hearth', 'venue', 'hearty', 'Ho', 'Ho', 'Ho', 'one', 'belly', 'as', 'well', 'tears', 'one', 'eyes', 'Sweet', 'enough', 'move', 'enough', 'real', 'life', 'resonance', 'prevent', 'being', 'hollow', 'confection', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'really', 'delivers.This', 'time', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'Allen', 'settled', 'Santa', 'helm', 'only', 'find', 'finer', 'print', 'business', 'card', 'contract', 'have', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', 'e', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'deliver', 'must', 'deliver', 'meantime', 'resentful', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'gotten', 'naughty', 'list', 'Returning', 'original', 'southern', 'latitude', 'get', 'quality', 'time', 'son', 'find', 'suitor', 'who', 'will', 'keep', 'suited', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'cheer', 'up', 'jaded', 'principal', 'Carol', 'Newman', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'rekindle', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'Charlie', 's', 'school', 'keep', 'North', 'Pole', 'order', 'Chief', 'Elf', 'Bernard', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'first', 'mate', 'Curtis', 'resort', 'ingenuity', 'cloning', 'Santa', 'wickedly', 'mutant', 'results', 'Will', 'Santa', 'deliver', 'toys', 'time', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'win', 'fronts', 'Clause', '2', 'charmed', 'resolutions.While', 'descriptions', 'movie', 'series', 'kept', 'away', 'so', 'long', 'execution', 'aforementioned', 'use', 'writers', 'wit', 'director', 'wisdom', 'movie', 'higher', 'holiday', 'favorites', 'list']",Santa Clause 2

603072,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JLQ8,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","Tim Allen returns to role that gave him his biggest box office success back in 1994. Good 'ol Saint Nick. Why did it take so long to get a sequel to the smash hit original made?. Well, Allen himself said they could never find the right storyline and that they wanted it to be perfect. It took 8 years to find the right story?. The plot of this movie pretty much sounds like the obvious storyline to do, so I'm surprised it took them almost a decade to realize it. Scott Calvin(Allen), has been Santa in the north pole for many years now and many believe that he has been the best Santa ever. The glimpses into the north pole and the Santa village and workshop are wonderful. This is what I have always imagined the place to look like. However, the place is located underground, and that's the first time I have seen them do that. Head elf Bernard(David Krumholtz), is back, and is followed around by the #2 elf, who is played by Spencer Breslin, who was seen in &quot;The Kid&quot;, and the upcoming &quot;The Cat In The Hat&quot; movie. Santa gets his annual naughty and nice list and is shocked to see that his son, Charlie, is on the naughty list. But Bernard has bigger news. It is written in the clause agreement that made Scott Santa that he has to get married, get a Mrs. Clause, or he will be desantified. Will no longer be Santa. Ho no!. He travels back to town to catch up on what Charlie has been doing, being reunited with his ex-wife, and her horrible sweater wearing husband Neil, once again played by Judge Reinhold. As the desantification beings, and Scott begins to shrink his body weight and lose the beard, he gets involved with Charlie's ice princess principal, Principal Newman, played by the lovely Elizabeth Mitchell. He realizes that she may be the one he has been looking for, but has to get her to realize it before his time is up and he is no longer Santa. In the meantime, the north pole is being overrun by a replacement Santa who quickly becomes dictator-ish and causes chaos and mayhem. This sequel is sweet, warm, and fun. I can't say it is as good, or has the same kind of magical feel and quality to it as the wonderful original, but it comes close. Then again, what sequel really does?. It's good, clean family fun, and everyone should enjoy it. Tim Allen, not surprisingly, carries the film. There were moments and scenes with no real spark, but were made by his being there. His jokes and overall presence lift the film and make it what it is. Eric Lloyd returns as Charlie, and he isn't bad. Dealing with young teen angst and the big secret he has to carry about his father really weighs on him and he does a pretty good job of making it seem real. Nothing special, but he gets the job done. I would of liked more screen time for Reinhold, but what are you going to do?. What the film lacked was the awe and specialness of the original. The original just seemed natural as these magical things begin to happen and everyone has to deal with them. Since everything has been set for quite some time now in this film, the enchantment isn't the same. Don't get me wrong because it is still there, but it's not the same. SNL alum Molly Shannon delivers one of the best moments when she cameos as a potential love interest for Scott. She delivers a doozy of a Christmas tinged Shania Twain song and it's hilarious. Also, original cast member Peter Boyle, who played Scott's boss in the oringal, has an uncredited cameo here playing Father Time. So, in the end, what you get is a really fun, nice movie that gives sequels a pretty good name. There's no harm, no foul, but the first is still the best.",4,Time To Believe Again,1069286400,"11 20, 2003",2003,3630,"['Tim', 'Allen', 'role', 'gave', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'back', '1994', 'Good', ""'ol"", 'Saint', 'Nick', 'Why', 'did', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'sequel', 'smash', 'hit', 'original', 'made', 'Well', 'Allen', 'said', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'right', 'storyline', 'wanted', 'be', 'perfect', 'took', '8', 'years', 'find', 'right', 'story', 'plot', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'sounds', 'obvious', 'storyline', 'do', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'took', 'almost', 'decade', 'realize', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'Allen', 'been', 'Santa', 'north', 'pole', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'many', 'believe', 'been', 'best', 'Santa', 'ever', 'glimpses', 'north', 'pole', 'Santa', 'village', 'workshop', 'are', 'wonderful', 'what', 'have', 'always', 'imagined', 'place', 'look', 'However', 'place', 'located', 'underground', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'do', 'Head', 'Bernard', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'back', 'followed', '2', 'elf', 'who', 'played', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'who', 'was', 'seen', 'quot', 'Kid', 'quot', 'upcoming', 'quot', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'quot', 'movie', 'Santa', 'annual', 'naughty', 'nice', 'list', 'shocked', 'see', 'son', 'Charlie', 'naughty', 'list', 'Bernard', 'bigger', 'news', 'written', 'clause', 'agreement', 'made', 'Scott', 'Santa', 'get', 'married', 'get', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'will', 'be', 'desantified', 'Will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'Santa', 'Ho', 'back', 'town', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'Charlie', 'been', 'doing', 'being', 'reunited', 'ex-wife', 'horrible', 'sweater', 'wearing', 'husband', 'Neil', 'once', 'again', 'played', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'desantification', 'beings', 'Scott', 'shrink', 'body', 'weight', 'lose', 'beard', 'involved', 'Charlie', 'ice', 'princess', 'principal', 'Principal', 'Newman', 'played', 'lovely', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'been', 'looking', 'get', 'realize', 'time', 'up', 'no', 'longer', 'Santa', 'meantime', 'north', 'pole', 'being', 'overrun', 'replacement', 'Santa', 'who', 'quickly', 'dictator-ish', 'chaos', 'mayhem', 'sequel', 'sweet', 'warm', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'as', 'good', 'same', 'kind', 'magical', 'feel', 'quality', 'wonderful', 'original', 'close', 'Then', 'again', 'what', 'sequel', 'really', 'good', 'clean', 'family', 'fun', 'everyone', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'film', 'were', 'moments', 'scenes', 'real', 'spark', 'were', 'made', 'being', 'there', 'jokes', 'overall', 'presence', 'lift', 'film', 'make', 'what', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'returns', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Dealing', 'young', 'teen', 'angst', 'big', 'secret', 'carry', 'father', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'seem', 'real', 'Nothing', 'special', 'job', 'done', 'would', 'liked', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Reinhold', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'What', 'film', 'lacked', 'was', 'awe', 'specialness', 'original', 'original', 'just', 'seemed', 'natural', 'magical', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'everyone', 'deal', 'everything', 'been', 'set', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'film', 'enchantment', ""n't"", 'same', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'there', 'not', 'same', 'SNL', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'when', 'cameos', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Scott', 'doozy', 'Christmas', 'tinged', 'Shania', 'Twain', 'song', 'hilarious', 'Also', 'original', 'cast', 'member', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'who', 'played', 'Scott', 'boss', 'oringal', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'here', 'playing', 'Father', 'Time', 'So', 'end', 'what', 'get', 'really', 'fun', 'nice', 'movie', 'sequels', 'pretty', 'good', 'name', 'harm', 'foul', 'first', 'still', 'best']",Santa Clause 2

Can you guess what this clause is called??  Yup, the Mrs. Clause... ha.  This flick focuses on the adventures of Scott Calvin as he heads home to try to find a wife and bounces back to the North Pole as things start to fall apart without Santa's presence at the helm.

603077,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,B00005JLQ8,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[8, 9]","I confess that I never saw THE SANTA CLAUSE in its entirety, but I saw little bits of it. Tim Allen did a commendable job and the film was perfectly harmless for children. But if a children's movie doesn't entertain adults then it completely fails. It is in this important requirement that THE SANTA CLAUSE 2 succeeds. It is entertaining, good hearted, and has an impressive look to it.That impressive look comes across in the opening sequence in the North Pole. Santa's workshop is bustling with elves. They are clearly played by children who wear makeup wisely limited to the ears. At the same time the place comes across like FAO Shwartz with a gigantic upgrade. The elves are making the toys that Santa must deliver when trouble starts. A surveillance plane is approaching their territory, and picking up the sounds coming from the workshop. Aanta turns to elves who monitor a security section like NORAD in WARGAMES. (They go to ""ElfCon 1"", a nice touch.) Eventually the crisis is abated, and it's back to business. Santa then conducts a meeting with all the other legendary figures: The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, Father Time, Cupid, and even The Sandman. When I saw who was cast in the role of Sandman I burst out laughing. (I wouldn't dream of revealing who it is. Some great jokes will come out of it.)Everything seems wonderful, but Santa comes down with two major problems. His son Charlie from the real world is on the ""naughty"" list, and if Santa doesn't get married before Christmas Eve at midnight, it's all over. So, he must go back to the Real World, find out what's up with Charlie and find someone to be Mrs Clause. Charlie is in trouble at school for painting graffiti, but after meeting his principal and her feelings about Christmas, it becomes understandable why he did it.Without giving away too many secrets, I can say that Santa only has a limited amount of Santa magic to use while he is in the real world. Meanwhile the head elf and his assistant try to cover up the fact that Santa must leave and go right on schedule. It results in a subplot that's a nice touch and is good for some funny moments. At the same time I felt Tim Allen projects a complete sense of good will and a belief that he really is Old Saint Nick.

If you don't have these, you definitely need to get them both.  Honestly, Tim Allen is just wonderful in them and really makes the story quite frankly.  Writers or not, he just takes it and goes and I would think that the majority of what he says is ""ad lib"" on his part.This sequel to the first is really great.  You never really buy sequels as a rule, but this one is definitely different.  When Allen finds out he has to get married to stay Santa, it's pretty amusing to see what the elves go through to get him married off.  Everything from making a ""fake Santa"" gone bad, to destroying the fake Santa's army of bad tin soldiers, keeps the kids entertained throughout.  It's a very sweet story, one that explains a lot about the Santa legend to those children with questions.  It definitely has the Disney touch, with I think is great and not a marketing thing at all as indicated in the review at the top of this item description.  Anyway, be sure to grab this set - I still feel really sad when Allen is refusing to be Santa in the first movie and the sad face of the child that they show afterwards.  It's just heartbreaking.

603096,A2VBI34EIGLG9C,B00005JLQ8,Emily,"[3, 6]","Well, I have to preface this review by saying that The Santa Clause (I) might be my favorite movie EVER, and so of course I was expecting great things from the sequel. After seeing it in the theater I did feel that sense of early Christmas magic (didn't hurt that it was snowing out), but also an empty sense of yet another dissapointing sequel.Sure, the kids will love this movie, that is if they aren't sCaRed by it. (Yes, evil-toy-come-to-life imitation Santa is one frightening dude.) But if you really want a movie that'll enrich the family Christmas spirit, go for the original. The Santa Clause II is simply TRYING TOO HARD--there are too many tangled plot lines that are supposed to be rather wry, but end up feeling cheezy and awkward. Yes, I mean the council of mythical beings, the whole &quot;Mrs. Clause&quot; idea, that gross farting reindeer, etc etc. Surely it still has moments of genuinely warm humor and Christmas cheer, but the magic is gone. Oy that sounds insincere, but I mean it.The simple conflict of family tensions and believing in Santa has been resolved--so they desperately need new ones, but those that they have come up with simply don't feel right. Luckily, Eric Lloyd still plays Charlie, and he's wonderful and quite believable. (yes, he made me cry) And of course, Judge Reinhold as Neil, my favorite--still wearing those creepy sweaters. Actually, my REAL favorite is David Krumholtz as Bernard (!!), but unfortunatley Bernard is no where near as surly as he was in the last movie--he's become virtually without personality, only to be replaced by the annoyingly surly elf Curtis.Ok, but I said that this movie was fun, right? Well, Tim Allen does prop up all of the extraneous plot lines and saggy jokes with his very funny but solidly likeable portayal of Santa-dad. And for some reason, it does invoke feelings of Christmas cheer. But after that some nausea. So I'd reccommend 1 over 2, unless you're a DIEHARD FAN like me...which is somewhat odd considering this is a xmas movie geared towards seven year olds! However, if you're really at a loss for xmas cheer, rent it and have a really OK time.",2,"Another Sequel--Fun, but Overdone",1069286400,"11 20, 2003",2003,2138,"['Well', 'have', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'might', 'be', 'favorite', 'movie', 'EVER', 'so', 'course', 'was', 'expecting', 'great', 'things', 'sequel', 'seeing', 'theater', 'did', 'feel', 'sense', 'early', 'Christmas', 'magic', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'was', 'snowing', 'out', 'also', 'empty', 'sense', 'yet', 'dissapointing', 'sequel.Sure', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'sCaRed', 'Yes', 'evil-toy-come-to-life', 'imitation', 'Santa', 'one', 'frightening', 'dude', 'really', 'want', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'enrich', 'family', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'go', 'original', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'II', 'simply', 'TRYING', 'TOO', 'HARD', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'tangled', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'rather', 'wry', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'cheezy', 'awkward', 'Yes', 'mean', 'council', 'mythical', 'beings', 'whole', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Clause', 'quot', 'idea', 'gross', 'farting', 'reindeer', 'etc', 'etc', 'Surely', 'still', 'moments', 'genuinely', 'warm', 'humor', 'Christmas', 'cheer', 'magic', 'gone', 'Oy', 'insincere', 'mean', 'it.The', 'simple', 'conflict', 'family', 'tensions', 'believing', 'Santa', 'been', 'resolved', 'desperately', 'need', 'new', 'ones', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'Luckily', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'still', 'Charlie', 'wonderful', 'quite', 'believable', 'yes', 'made', 'cry', 'course', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Neil', 'favorite', 'still', 'wearing', 'creepy', 'sweaters', 'Actually', 'REAL', 'favorite', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'Bernard', 'unfortunatley', 'Bernard', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'surly', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'become', 'virtually', 'personality', 'only', 'be', 'replaced', 'annoyingly', 'surly', 'Curtis.Ok', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'right', 'Well', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'prop', 'up', 'extraneous', 'plot', 'lines', 'saggy', 'jokes', 'very', 'funny', 'solidly', 'likeable', 'portayal', 'Santa-dad', 'reason', 'invoke', 'feelings', 'Christmas', 'cheer', 'nausea', ""'d"", 'reccommend', '1', '2', ""'re"", 'DIEHARD', 'FAN', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'considering', 'xmas', 'movie', 'geared', 'towards', 'seven', 'year', 'olds', 'However', ""'re"", 'really', 'loss', 'xmas', 'cheer', 'rent', 'have', 'really', 'OK', 'time']",Santa Clause 2

But that's not the only problem with ""The Santa Clause 2"" -- the problem is its lack of freshness and enjoyability. The first film was a real Christmas treat; funny, ocassionally rather surprisingly witty, and always with a tender side and a refreshing Holiday spirit.The second vehicle -- though filmed eight years apart from the first -- seems like a cash-in, and nothing more. Santa (Tim Allen), a.k.a. Scott Calvin (look at the initials), is as happy as can be. He's been Santa Claus for the past eight years, and the children have been happier since he became Santa. (Who takes these polls?) But as Christmas draws closer, Scott realizes that not only is his son, Charlie, on the Naughty List, there's a second clause in the contract that states he must become married to ""The Mrs. Claus"" in 27 days, or he'll be history.The head elf, Bernard, along with the help of another fellow elf (Specer Breslin, ""The Cat in the Hat""), duplicates a fake Santa to watch over things as the real Scott goes home to tend to family matters. But the new Santa Claus is an evil dictator who comes to work in Hitler's outfit and demands that all children be given coal. It's the funniest part of the movie, apart from when Evil Santa says to Good Santa, ""You are a sad, strange little man,"" which is of course a little Disney in-joke. (Tim is mimicking his own Buzz Lightyear character from Disney/Pixar's ""Toy Story."")""The Santa Clause 2"" got a lot of good reviews that called it an enjoyable and charming little movie, but I missed something. The first film was something both kids and adults alike could equally enjoy. Allen was funnier, the film was funnier, and it was much more charming than this. And for a film made eight years earlier, its special effects are superior. (At the end of ""2,"" Scott hangs off the back of Evil Santa's flying sleigh and...it simply has to be seen to be appalled by.)There's a major plot hole in the entire idea of Santa Claus existing in our world that need not be pointed out by me -- and I won't, in case there are children reading this. But whereas the first film had fun with the notion of Santa Claus being real, ""The Santa Clause 2"" bashes it all over the head. Charlie cries at one point because his dad has ""the best job in the world"" but he is unable to tell all his friends. Boo-hoo. The thing is, ""The Santa Clause 2"" takes the idea of Santa Claus too far. It's not fun anymore. Just watch the first -- and far superior -- film instead.Another thing: The first film seemed very down to earth, very simple and fun. This movie is all over the place. A television show director made ""The Santa Clause 2,"" and it's very evident that this is so. The movie is too sporadically daffy and serious and not at all inspired. I still remember seeing the first film and being delighted by its sheer heart.

It wasn't a BAD movie, it just wasn't what I was expecting after the first one.The basic plot is that Santa (Tim Allen) finds out 28 days before Christmas that he must find a wife (which is called the Mrs. Clause) before Christmas or else he cannot be Santa any longer.  Since he needs to be finding a wife and at the North Pole supervising toy making, some of his elves make a toy clone version of him to stay at the North Pole.  He goes down to the town his son lives in to find a wife, and immediately latches on to the son's super hot principal.  The rest I won't ruin for those who want to see it.Ok... I really liked the crazy clone Santa plotline - I thought it was hilarious.  It might be a little too scary for extremely young kids (especially since he wears a Saddam Hussein like outfit), but I think most will be able to handle it with no problems.I could not STAND the reindeer.  The animatronics were horrible and the reindeer itself was just annoying (and I really hate when a movie with so much promise stoops to fart jokes).  If they had left that entire part out of the movie, I think it would have been much better.Overall, the story is cute.  I liked it - its worth renting around Christmas time with the family.

603121,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLQ8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 18]","""The Santa Clause 2: The Mrs. Clause"" is a decent enough sequel, buoyed mainly by Tim Allen's engaging performance, which is added by the fact that all of his comic excess is vented through the ""toy"" Santa that is created to fool the elves at the North Pole while Santa is out shopping for a wife.  The movie splits into two plot lines.  For the kiddies there is the toy Santa deciding to maintain a strict interpretation of what it means to be ""naughty"" and put coal in the stocking of every child.  For the adults there is the attempt of Scott/Santa to woo, win and wed Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell), the principal at the school where Charlie Calvin (Eric Lloyd) has been defacing school property with anti-Christmas graffiti.As the clock ticks down on the efforts to find his Mrs. Claus, Scott begins the process of de-Santification, which means the beard and belly end up disappearing.  The best sequence of the film is when Scott manages to actually talk himself into a date with Principal Newman and uses his entire reserve of magic to impressive her, which he does.  We are impressed, even though part of what he does is the same sort of thing that convinced Charlie's step-father Neil (Judge Reinhold) that Santa was real the last time around.  But for me this movie comes down to the moment when Carol has to become convinced of the truth and I did not find the movie's solution to that pivotal moment to be particularly memorable or moving, as much as I wanted it to be.However, that objection will matter not a whit to the small fry who will be more concerned with flying reindeer and the final encounter with the toy Santa's army of toy soldiers (which ends up as a very weak rehash of ""Babe in Toyland"").  Still, a holiday movie this time of year that the kids will enjoy is a good thing.  There are some nice character bits turned in by Art LeFluer as the Tooth Fairy, Peter Boyle as Father Time, Michael Dorn as the Sandman, Kevin Pollack as Cupid, and Molly Shannon as a prospective bride who is clearly Santa's #1 fan.

And kids the world over have never been happier.Unfortunately, this Christmas Scott's hit a couple snags.  First, his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) is acting up.  In fact, after he's caught spray painting the school, he winds up on Santa's naughty list.Even more pressing, elf Curtis (Spencer Breslin) has discovered another clause.  It seems Santa needs a Mrs. Claus or he will stop being Santa.  In fact, he's already loosing weight and returning to his original form.  If he isn't married by Christmas, he'll cease being Santa forever.Naturally, the month before Christmas is the busiest time of the year for Santa and the elves.  So he leaves behind a robot duplicate of himself and heads to his ex-wife's house.  He hopes to reconnect with Charlie and find someone willing to marry him.  So why is the first person to catch his eye the Christmas hating principal of Charlie's school (Elizabeth Mitchell)?  Will it work, or is Scott doomed to cease being Santa forever?The first movie is one of my favorite Christmas films.  In fact, I watch it every year.  While this sequel doesn't capture all the charm of the original, this is still a fun movie.  It's nice seeing the entire cast of the first movie back, and they do a good job.

603130,A38ZU5T1A1RNUO,B00005JLQ8,Mike,"[15, 17]","A nice holiday film. Pretty good sequel.  Not quite as warm as the first, but touching at times and certainly enjoyable family entertainment.  The plot is ok; the writing is good.About seven years after the events in the first ""Clause"", the North Pole is bustling with activity about a month before Christmas.  The opening sequence gives a nice, fanciful view of Santa's village and workshops.  You see Santa as a good manager/leader happily encouraging the elves in their efforts.But trouble is on the horizon - literally in the opening sequence and figuratively in the form of two problems: Charlie, Santa's son, has grown into a teenager and is getting in trouble for rebelling against a repressive school principal with no holiday cheer; and Santa finds another ""clause"" that says he must find a Mrs. Claus or he will be ""de-Santafied"", reverting back to Scott Calvin.  And he has only 28 days before this marriage must occur, coinciding of course with Christmas Eve.A cute scene occurs at the North Pole as it is Santa's turn to host a Board Meeting of Legendary Characters: The Easter Bunny, Cupid, The Tooth Fairy, Mother Nature, Father Time (Peter Boyle) and The Sandman (Michael Dorn of Star Trek:TNG fame).Charlie now has a six year old stepsister and this young actress does a very nice job with her role. She is charming.While Santa is away looking for a wife and tending to Charlie's troubles, bad tidings occur at the North Pole - beware of soul-less technology and a rigid enforcement of ""the rules""!I don't like giving anything away for people who plan to see the movie.  I would suggest that this movie will work much better if you have seen the first movie.  So if you haven't seen ""The Santa Clause"", rent and watch that before this.I also wonder how effective this movie would be for children under six. This sequel's content, while rated G, feels a bit older than the first.The acting is well-done and comes across as genuine, though the Bernard character seems a bit overplayed with more broad physicality than seems needed.Happy Holidays!",3,3 1/2 stars,1036195200,"11 2, 2002",2002,2061,"['nice', 'holiday', 'film', 'Pretty', 'good', 'sequel', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'warm', 'first', 'touching', 'times', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'entertainment', 'plot', 'ok', 'writing', 'good.About', 'seven', 'years', 'events', 'first', 'Clause', 'North', 'Pole', 'bustling', 'activity', 'month', 'Christmas', 'opening', 'sequence', 'nice', 'fanciful', 'view', 'Santa', 'village', 'workshops', 'see', 'Santa', 'good', 'manager/leader', 'happily', 'encouraging', 'elves', 'efforts.But', 'trouble', 'horizon', 'literally', 'opening', 'sequence', 'figuratively', 'form', 'two', 'problems', 'Charlie', 'Santa', 'son', 'grown', 'teenager', 'getting', 'trouble', 'rebelling', 'repressive', 'school', 'principal', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'Santa', 'clause', 'must', 'find', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', 'will', 'be', 'de-Santafied', 'reverting', 'back', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'only', '28', 'days', 'marriage', 'must', 'occur', 'coinciding', 'course', 'Christmas', 'Eve.A', 'cute', 'scene', 'North', 'Pole', 'Santa', 'turn', 'host', 'Board', 'Meeting', 'Legendary', 'Characters', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Cupid', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'Father', 'Time', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Sandman', 'Michael', 'Dorn', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'fame', '.Charlie', 'now', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'stepsister', 'young', 'actress', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'role', 'charming.While', 'Santa', 'away', 'looking', 'wife', 'tending', 'Charlie', 'troubles', 'bad', 'tidings', 'occur', 'North', 'Pole', 'beware', 'soul-less', 'technology', 'rigid', 'enforcement', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'people', 'who', 'plan', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'will', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'So', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'rent', 'watch', 'this.I', 'also', 'wonder', 'how', 'effective', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'children', 'six', 'sequel', 'content', 'rated', 'G', 'bit', 'older', 'first.The', 'acting', 'well-done', 'across', 'genuine', 'Bernard', 'character', 'bit', 'overplayed', 'more', 'broad', 'physicality', 'needed.Happy', 'Holidays']",Santa Clause 2

603132,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00005JLQ8,Monty Moonlight,"[3, 3]","Eight years ago, strange circumstances and a legal clause resulted in single father Scott Calvin becoming the world's new Santa Claus. Since then, he has proven himself to be the best man for the job. Everyone, from kids to elves, absolutely loves him! Unfortunately, Curtis, the number-two elf and keeper of the Elf Handbook, managed to overlook a second, VERY important clause. In order to remain Santa, Scott Calvin has to satisfy The Mrs. Clause. That is to say, Scott has to find a wife if he wants to keep being the man in the red suit, and he's only got until midnight on Christmas Eve to do it! With only 28 days to find Miss Right and Scott ""desantafying"" a little more all the time, he and Bernard, the number-one elf, agree to use Curtis's plan to install a living, life-size toy Santa in Scott's place to keep the elves from worrying. With that problem solved, Scott climbs aboard faithful reindeer Comet and flies to his former hometown to try and settle two problems at the same time. He not only has to find himself a wife, he also has to deal with his teenage son, Charlie, whose acting out in the form of graffiti on his school's campus has landed him on the naughty list!As Scott, gradually transforming back into his pre-Santa self (in other words, looking more and more like actor-comedian Tim Allen), goes out on blind-dates arranged by his ex-wife and verbally duels with Charlie and attractive Principal Carol Newman, the replacement Santa is going on a power trip at the North Pole, eventually turning the happy village of elves into a police state with the help of his army of giant toy soldiers. When Scott finally shows principal Newman how good he can be with children, he impresses her enough to land a first date that proves to be a very charming and magical evening. However, the situation at the North Pole and the approaching Christmas Eve deadline are not giving Scott a lot of time for solidifying a relationship. There's still the whole ""I'm Santa Claus"" issue to deal with, and it doesn't help that Principal Newman has issues with Christmas. Scott also still has to work out things with his troubled son. Meanwhile, Charlie's little sister is getting suspicious of her visiting ""Uncle"" Scott's true identity. After all, he came into town on a reindeer! Everything comes to a head on Christmas Eve, when Curtis shows up at the door in a desperate effort to bring Santa home to defeat the toy Santa-clone and save Christmas! But, there's still a little matter of an unconfirmed wedding to deal with  too! Can Scott Calvin, AKA Santa Claus, manage it all in time?!!!Comedian Tim Allen returns to the North Pole a second time to give us ""Santa Clause 2: The Mrs. Clause,"" and it's every bit as enjoyable as Disney's first hit Santa Clause film! Don't be put off by the submarine film spoof in the beginning. Once this movie gets going, it's a magical sleigh ride from start to finish. The stuff at the North Pole is funny, cute, and extra saccharine for the kiddies, but the real high points come on Scott's dating adventures. His doomed blind-date with Saturday Night Live alumnus Molly Shannon is hilarious, and his enchanting evening with Carol is a Christmas card come to life! The kids in the cast strut some fantastic talent, but the adults win the laughs with Judge Reinhold back as Neil, Art LaFleur onboard as the Tooth Fairy (along with a slew of other stars as enjoyable fantasy icons), Elizabeth Mitchell as the lovely Principal Carol Newman, David Krumholtz returning as Bernard the Head-Elf, and Tim Allen in the double role of Scott ""Santa"" Calvin and the delightfully rotten toy Santa-Clone. Director Michael Lembeck does an awesome job of creating a sequel that stands on its own ground while staying true to the original. It's a Christmas movie, so you know there'll be great music and plenty of holiday eye-candy! The DVD comes with its share of holiday gifts too. There are deleted scenes, a gag reel, a game, some fun behind the scenes featurettes, and a kid-friendly desire throughout the disc to ""keep the illusion alive."" In fact, that last aspect makes the director's commentary a real trip!

Chalk,"[3, 8]","First, before any of you start throwing stones, let me just say that I thought The Santa Clause was a wonderful movie and it remains to this day one of our family holiday, (and throughout the year, actually) favorites. It was fresh and original and FUNNY! This sequel, was far inferior to it's predecessor in many ways. I agree with one of the other reviewers that Tim Allen seemed rather uncomfortable or stiff in his portrayal of Santa Claus this time around. The storyline wasn't believable in the slightest. Charlie has turned from sweet inventor of the CD (cocoa/cookie dispenser) to a sullen, graffitti spraying punk. All of a sudden, many years after Santa has been on the job at the North Pole, NOW he has to marry within a matter of a few weeks so that he can continue ""being"" Santa. Why now? What happened? The lady who is to become Mrs. Claus, Principal Newman, isn't believable in any realm when she suddenly changes her tone from stern disciplinarian to syrupy over-sweetened Mrs. Claus. Comet was EXTREMELY irritating and even frightening to my 1 and 1/2 year old baby. He cried! The only bright spot in this film was the young fellow who portrayed the little elf Marcus. He is not only adorable, but quite professional and believable. The few times I chuckled was when he was stealing each scene he was a part of. Now I realize this ""review"" may sound a bit harsh, but if you value your time, as I do, and would rather not waste any of it then I wouldn't purchase this dvd. I would suggest as an alternative enhancing your holiday dvd library by purchasing ""poetry on film"" such as It's a Wonderful Life, The Homecoming, A Christmas Carol with Alistair Sim, or The House Without a Christmas Tree, to name a few.

Disney brought this movie out last year when the first Santa Clause movie (with Tim Allen) came out in 1994. I don't know when this is taking place, but I have heard that the movie begins 8 years after the orginal movie took place. The movie does not say when it it is taking place, but I do know that is take place, at least 8 years after the orginal, since Charlie (Scott's son) was a little boy, when his dad became Santa Clause, when the old one fell off his roof, and now he is a teenager. This is a rare live action movie with a G rating. And usually live action movies, would have a higher rating like PG, or even higher. As the movie opens, Scott (Tim Allen) has been Santa Clause for some years now, and now even more children believe in Santa Clause, since Scott took the job. But there are stuff that is going on, that Scott doesn't know. And that head elf Bernard (David Krumholtz) has been bugging Curtis (Spencer Breslin) about breaking some bad news to Santa Clause. And when Curtis asks Bernard, why he does he have to do it, Bernard explains to Curtis that he is the head elf, and it is not his job to give bad news to Santa. Santa's son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) who is know a teenager, has landed him on ""this year's naughty list"". And it gets even worser when Curtis and Bernard tell Santa shows Santa that on the card, some information that was missed. And that is that he needs a Mrs. Clause. And he has until Christmas Eve to find a wife. And the process begins, that he will start to lose his stomach, and white hair, and then it will contiune on until he can't be Santa any more. And that he has to go back to earth, to help his son, and maybe to find a new wife. Then Curtis comes up with the idea of cloning Santa, and have a look a like, stay at the north pole, and does Santa's duties, while Scott Calven returns to Earth, to find out what is going on with his son, Bernard is against, but Scott is cloed, and Scott asks Bernard to lie to the elfs, that he has changed his appearance. Even though, how much Bernard hates the idea, he does it any way. When Scott returns to earth, he learns that Charlie has done graftti all over his school, and is even facing susupention. And has to attend a meeting wit his ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson), Neil (Judge Reinhold), Charlie, and his son's principal Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell). It may be a good idea, to see the first movie, before this one, to find out how Scott got the job as Santa in the first place, before you see this one. The movie reunites most of the cast from the Santa Clause, all the elves in the first one, are not back, and there newcomers like Curtis, Carol and Charlie's baby relative Lucy (Liliana Mumy)",4,The Santa Clause is back!,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,2828,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'listied', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'when', 'title', 'just', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'Disney', 'brought', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'first', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'came', 'out', '1994', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'taking', 'place', 'have', 'heard', 'movie', '8', 'years', 'orginal', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'movie', 'not', 'say', 'when', 'taking', 'place', 'do', 'know', 'take', 'place', 'least', '8', 'years', 'orginal', 'Charlie', 'Scott', 'son', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'when', 'dad', 'became', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'when', 'old', 'one', 'fell', 'roof', 'now', 'teenager', 'rare', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'G', 'rating', 'usually', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'higher', 'rating', 'PG', 'even', 'higher', 'movie', 'Scott', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'been', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'years', 'now', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'children', 'believe', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Scott', 'took', 'job', 'are', 'stuff', 'going', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'know', 'head', 'Bernard', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'been', 'bugging', 'Curtis', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'breaking', 'bad', 'news', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'when', 'Curtis', 'Bernard', 'why', 'have', 'do', 'Bernard', 'Curtis', 'head', 'elf', 'not', 'job', 'give', 'bad', 'news', 'Santa', 'Santa', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'know', 'teenager', 'landed', 'year', 'naughty', 'list', 'even', 'worser', 'when', 'Curtis', 'Bernard', 'tell', 'Santa', 'Santa', 'card', 'information', 'was', 'missed', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'find', 'wife', 'process', 'will', 'start', 'lose', 'stomach', 'white', 'hair', 'then', 'will', 'contiune', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Santa', 'more', 'go', 'back', 'earth', 'help', 'son', 'maybe', 'find', 'new', 'wife', 'Then', 'Curtis', 'up', 'idea', 'cloning', 'Santa', 'have', 'look', 'like', 'stay', 'north', 'pole', 'Santa', 'duties', 'Scott', 'Calven', 'Earth', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'son', 'Bernard', 'Scott', 'cloed', 'Scott', 'Bernard', 'lie', 'elfs', 'changed', 'appearance', 'Even', 'how', 'much', 'Bernard', 'idea', 'way', 'When', 'Scott', 'earth', 'Charlie', 'done', 'graftti', 'school', 'even', 'facing', 'susupention', 'attend', 'meeting', 'wit', 'ex-wife', 'Laura', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'Neil', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Charlie', 'son', 'principal', 'Carol', 'Newman', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'see', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Scott', 'got', 'job', 'Santa', 'first', 'place', 'see', 'one', 'movie', 'most', 'cast', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'elves', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'not', 'back', 'there', 'newcomers', 'Curtis', 'Carol', 'Charlie', 'baby', 'relative', 'Lucy', 'Liliana', 'Mumy']",Santa Clause 2

603158,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B00005JLQ8,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[2, 6]","In Brief8 years ago Scott Calvin became Santa Clause due to a clause in the contract that he discovered on the previous Santa who fell from his roof.  Since then he has enjoyed bringing joy to the world, but life is tough when he has a son and broken marriage back in the States.  Now a new clause has been found in the small print of the contract card: he has to find a Mrs Clause to marry by Christmas Eve or else he will no longer be Santa.  With this weight on his shoulders he returns home to sort out the problems with his troubled son leaving a toy Santa in his place who is a stickler for the rules and decides that maybe not that many children in the world have been good after all!  Chaos ensues, will Santa find his wife, will he sort out the mess at the North Pole, and will he sort out his son, all before Christmas Eve is over!!!ReviewThe Santa Clause was in my mind the definitive Santa movie, it appealed to both adults and kids alike and didn't have Dudley Moore in it nor was it so overfilled with sugary sweetness that I wanted to puke.  Well may he rest in peace but thankfully Moore isn't in this film, so the alcohol content may be low but the sugar content is definitely high.  So high in fact that a warning should be placed on the poster ""This film is rated U and may contain some scenes that could cause tooth decay in viewers of a sensitive nature.""As a rule of thumb, Hollywood film-makers see a sequel and either add kids or animals to the mix, don't believe me check out Robocop 3 or Mad Max 3 to name two.  The Santa Clause 2 has elves, who are either sleeping in the summer or are very busy at Christmas so are conveniently played here by children for the sake of the film.  However this is not a bad movie, my rating of two stars acts as a guide to those that remembered the first film when the were young and thought they might get in the Christmas spirit and see the second, don't!  Watch the first on TV and save some money, however if you do have kids or want to borrow a neighbours so you can see it anyway you can double the rating to four stars as any child under 10 will love it.Tim Allen is always a pleasure to see, and the movie from an adult's perspective takes a good 20 minutes to kick in, as he then returns to his former state, Scott Calvin leaving behind a dictator Toy Santa (Allen in toy makeup and full Buzz Lightyear mode) to hold the North Pole fort.  Out of the main role of the main man, Allen excels and the humour from an adult perspective is apparent and funny, while the romance shared between Calvin and Carol (Mitchell) is genuine and touching.The VerdictAll in all, this piece of Christmas cheer is well worth the effort if you have children that you'd like to take.  Its inoffensive and joyous and from that perspective is a rare treat at the cinema today, but it has little to offer anyone in their teens or older, which is a shame as based on the first film that's an opportunity that has been missed.",2,A MISSED OPPORTUNITY,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,2968,"['Brief8', 'years', 'ago', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'became', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'due', 'clause', 'contract', 'discovered', 'previous', 'Santa', 'who', 'fell', 'roof', 'then', 'enjoyed', 'bringing', 'joy', 'world', 'life', 'tough', 'when', 'son', 'broken', 'marriage', 'back', 'States', 'Now', 'new', 'clause', 'been', 'found', 'small', 'print', 'contract', 'card', 'find', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'marry', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'else', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'Santa', 'weight', 'shoulders', 'home', 'sort', 'out', 'problems', 'troubled', 'son', 'leaving', 'toy', 'Santa', 'place', 'who', 'stickler', 'rules', 'maybe', 'not', 'many', 'children', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Chaos', 'ensues', 'will', 'Santa', 'find', 'wife', 'will', 'sort', 'out', 'mess', 'North', 'Pole', 'will', 'sort', 'out', 'son', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'ReviewThe', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'was', 'mind', 'definitive', 'Santa', 'movie', 'appealed', 'adults', 'kids', 'alike', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'was', 'so', 'overfilled', 'sugary', 'sweetness', 'wanted', 'puke', 'Well', 'may', 'rest', 'peace', 'thankfully', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'film', 'alcohol', 'content', 'may', 'be', 'low', 'sugar', 'content', 'definitely', 'high', 'So', 'high', 'fact', 'warning', 'should', 'be', 'placed', 'poster', 'film', 'rated', 'U', 'may', 'contain', 'scenes', 'could', 'cause', 'decay', 'viewers', 'sensitive', 'nature', 'rule', 'thumb', 'Hollywood', 'film-makers', 'see', 'sequel', 'add', 'kids', 'animals', 'mix', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'check', 'out', 'Robocop', '3', 'Mad', 'Max', '3', 'name', 'two', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'elves', 'who', 'are', 'sleeping', 'summer', 'are', 'very', 'busy', 'Christmas', 'so', 'are', 'conveniently', 'played', 'here', 'children', 'sake', 'film', 'However', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'rating', 'two', 'stars', 'guide', 'remembered', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'thought', 'might', 'get', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'see', 'second', 'do', ""n't"", 'Watch', 'first', 'TV', 'save', 'money', 'however', 'do', 'have', 'kids', 'want', 'borrow', 'neighbours', 'can', 'see', 'anyway', 'can', 'double', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'child', '10', 'will', 'love', 'it.Tim', 'Allen', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'movie', 'adult', 'perspective', 'good', '20', 'minutes', 'kick', 'then', 'former', 'state', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'leaving', 'dictator', 'Toy', 'Santa', 'Allen', 'toy', 'makeup', 'full', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'mode', 'hold', 'North', 'Pole', 'fort', 'main', 'role', 'main', 'man', 'Allen', 'excels', 'humour', 'adult', 'perspective', 'apparent', 'funny', 'romance', 'shared', 'Calvin', 'Carol', 'Mitchell', 'genuine', 'touching.The', 'VerdictAll', 'piece', 'Christmas', 'cheer', 'well', 'effort', 'have', 'children', ""'d"", 'like', 'take', 'inoffensive', 'joyous', 'perspective', 'rare', 'treat', 'cinema', 'today', 'little', 'offer', 'anyone', 'teens', 'older', 'shame', 'based', 'first', 'film', 'opportunity', 'been', 'missed']",Santa Clause 2

603160,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLQ8,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","In 1994, Tim Allen's feature debut film ""Santa Clause"" was released to be a commercial success.  Eight years later, somehow they decided to make a sequal to the original, which, by the way, I didn't remember much.  I saw it, that's for sure, but no images remain in my mind.Possibly the same fate would be waiting for this one, which features the titular character Scott Calvin, now called Santa and living around the North Pole with cute elves.  He is happy, working for the good kids all over the world,; however, he is suddenly informed that there is one clause he should have known much earlier.  That is, Santa must have a wife, Mrs. Clause so to speak, and he has to find a spouse within the deadline.  And that is coming very near, like, about one month.Five scriptwriters are credited to concoct the story, which I find very weak and even dated -- I said to myself, ""must be married?""  The filmmakers clearly didn't think about the possibility that not all the children watching this film share the same image of ""family,"" but I can forget that part.  That's a comedy, so just make us laugh.And as a comedy, ""Santa Clause 2"" doesn't work well.  There are some funny moments such as plastic Santa played by Allen in special make-up, or flatulant reindeer, but I don't think adults would find them memorable.  In fact, I don't believe that kids watching the film might be bored unless they are very young pre-teens.  The production designs are decently done, and Tim Allen and other cast do their best to be amusing, but how do you think when the film begins with a scene in which you see the surprised faces of airplane crew flying over the North Pole, who happen to hear the Christmas song of Smokey Robinson coming from underground?  Is this tame gag so funny?It is said that Hollywood studios, including Walt Disney company which produced this film, lack in originality, but the true problem is not that.  It is that they lack confidence.  If only the script pursued the premise of marrying Mrs, Clause much further, I was thinking about that while watching the film.  Elizabeth Mitchell plays superbly the headmaster of a school with her rather cold, cynical attitude towards kids, and the romance between her and Tim Allen has some good moments.  Of course, her cynicism is to be dismantled.  But the film meanders among the unnecessary sub-plots about Scott Calvin's son, Judge Reinhold - Wendy Crewson family (did you remember they were in the original?) and the conference of traditional fairies.  There are many sketches, but none of them can sustain the whole film.People say ""kids might love it""; perhaps they might, but you cannot underestimate kids.  (I'd really like to know the opinions of teenagers, especially above 16.)  As for adults, I don't think this is a good idea to spend the time.  The premise of ""Be married, be a Santa"" never sounds enticing to me.",2,"(In fact 2.5 Stars) The Film Offers Many, But Ends Up Flimsy",1040515200,"12 22, 2002",2002,2883,"['1994', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'feature', 'debut', 'film', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'was', 'released', 'be', 'commercial', 'success', 'Eight', 'years', 'later', 'somehow', 'decided', 'make', 'sequal', 'original', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'saw', 'sure', 'images', 'remain', 'mind.Possibly', 'same', 'fate', 'would', 'be', 'waiting', 'one', 'titular', 'character', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'now', 'called', 'Santa', 'living', 'North', 'Pole', 'cute', 'elves', 'happy', 'working', 'good', 'kids', 'world', 'however', 'suddenly', 'informed', 'one', 'clause', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'much', 'earlier', 'Santa', 'must', 'have', 'wife', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'speak', 'find', 'spouse', 'deadline', 'coming', 'very', 'near', 'one', 'month.Five', 'scriptwriters', 'are', 'credited', 'concoct', 'story', 'find', 'very', 'weak', 'even', 'dated', 'said', 'myself', 'must', 'be', 'married', 'filmmakers', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'possibility', 'not', 'children', 'watching', 'film', 'share', 'same', 'image', 'family', 'can', 'forget', 'part', 'comedy', 'so', 'just', 'make', 'laugh.And', 'comedy', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'plastic', 'Santa', 'played', 'Allen', 'special', 'make-up', 'flatulant', 'reindeer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'adults', 'would', 'find', 'memorable', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'kids', 'watching', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'bored', 'are', 'very', 'young', 'pre-teens', 'production', 'designs', 'are', 'decently', 'done', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'other', 'cast', 'do', 'best', 'be', 'amusing', 'how', 'do', 'think', 'when', 'film', 'scene', 'see', 'surprised', 'airplane', 'crew', 'flying', 'North', 'Pole', 'who', 'happen', 'hear', 'Christmas', 'song', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'coming', 'underground', 'tame', 'gag', 'so', 'funny', 'said', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'including', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'company', 'produced', 'film', 'lack', 'originality', 'true', 'problem', 'not', 'lack', 'confidence', 'only', 'script', 'pursued', 'premise', 'marrying', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'much', 'further', 'was', 'thinking', 'watching', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'superbly', 'headmaster', 'school', 'rather', 'cold', 'cynical', 'attitude', 'towards', 'kids', 'romance', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'good', 'moments', 'course', 'cynicism', 'be', 'dismantled', 'film', 'meanders', 'unnecessary', 'sub-plots', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'son', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'family', 'did', 'remember', 'were', 'original', 'conference', 'traditional', 'fairies', 'are', 'many', 'sketches', 'none', 'can', 'sustain', 'whole', 'film.People', 'say', 'kids', 'might', 'love', 'perhaps', 'might', 'can', 'not', 'underestimate', 'kids', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'know', 'opinions', 'teenagers', 'especially', '16', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'idea', 'spend', 'time', 'premise', 'Be', 'married', 'be', 'Santa', 'never', 'enticing']",Santa Clause 2

603162,AID8OJP77VK6Y,B00005JLQ8,unicornelia,"[3, 3]","""The Santa Clause"" is a holiday movie that my family has watched and loved multiple times every year. It really captured the spirit of the day in a way that EVERYONE can appreciate. ""The Santa Clause 2"" was something I didn't bother to see in theaters, because it's been my experience that Disney can't do sequels right. Based on past failures, this could have truly been a terrible film. Luckily, I heard from a friend who became absolutely obsessed with it and counted down the days to its DVD release. She said it was not only, in her opinion, slightly better than the first, but that it was a generally wonderful and very funny movie. Sufficiently persuaded to purchase the DVD, I now can honestly say that I'm glad I did.In this movie, the entire original cast returns for a story that's actually quite clever for a ""part II."" Colorful and fun from beginning to end, the humor is genuine, and not the 'corny' kind you might expect. Actually, my favorite line is when the ""number two elf,"" Curtis, says, ""The Desantafication process has begun!"" He shouts it so loudly and rapidly it's scary--but mad humorous. If you don't already know the story, here it is in a nutshell: Scott needs a wife in order to remain Santa forever; the ""Mrs. Clause."" His son Charlie is falling into 'bad behavior' because he feels neglected and upset that he must keep his father's secret, when his dad's got the coolest job of all. While Scott is courting the school principal using magic, back at the North Pole, chaos is ensuing as the toy santa goes awry and develops a persona not unlike Hitler. He whips the elves into long, miserable work hours and is just basically cruel, screwing up the entire process of Christmas by deciding that most kids are naughty and they all deserve only coal.The reindeer, Scott's ex-wife and Neil, the hilarious Council of Legendary Figures, etc., all combine to make a truly satisfying movie that is a very, very worthy successor to ""The Santa Clause."" I am pleased to say, a longtime fan of the original was not disappointed at all. (Warning: The most irritating character by far is Molly Shannon's small role of Tracy, Scott's first dismal attempt at finding a Mrs. Clause. Tracy has an unhealthy obsession with country music and bursts into a highly embarassing singing-and-dancing performance of a Shania Twain song with lyrics twisted to be about Christmas--UNDER THE WATCH OF EVERYONE IN A PUBLIC RESTAURANT WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF THE START OF A FIRST DATE. Something's wrong with this woman. She's one of those, ""I-am-not-with-her, I've-never-seen-her-before-in-my-life"" kind of humilating freaks of nature whom you'd NEVER wanna be caught dead with in public. The scene is funny--still, I dunno about anyone else, but I felt really awful for Scott. I mean, he responded the way any normal red-blooded American would, and then Tracy storms out on him for not ""supporting her ambition"" when she ""put herself out there"" which she claims was ""not an easy thing to do."") Bernard has a big role, and is even more likable in this one; he doesn't like Curtis much, but he's used to having Scott as Santa. ""Chet"" is the new, inexperienced reindeer-in-training who is completely horrible at guiding a sleigh--or just flying, for that matter. The Tooth Fairy, who wants to change his name to Tooth Man, Tooth Guy, Molinator, Tooth, Plaque Man, Captain Floss, or as I recall, Roy, is hysterical. ""No kid will leave a tooth under their pillow for some guy named Roy,"" claims Cupid. Eh heh...it's probably true.Also, BE SURE TO WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURES!! They're excellent. The interview with the Legendary Figures is hilarious. Gotta love Cupid. ""Deleted scenes"" & ""gag reel"" are tons of fun. Watch the movie with the audio commentary from Micheal Lembeck as well as the hysterically funny ten-minute ""Exploring the North Pole w/ Curtis."" These are too much fun & they give greater insight into the rivalry betwixt Curtis and Bernard. Banana, anyone?!So on the whole, it's a great film. For everybody. I'd see it if I were you.

The first film was utterly charming and the law of diminishing returns usually applies to sequels. I was very pleasnatly surprised to find that Santa Clause 2, while not quite as inventive as the first film, was a fun and charming movie. There's a number of sequences that rank up there with the first movie and, although the film feels a bit rushed towards the end (we only see one blind date in the movie but, heck with Molly Shannon from SNL, it's a great little scene).It seems that Scott Calvin aka Santa missed another little bit of fine print in the Santa contract. He has to find a Mrs. Clause or he'll no longer be Santa. To prevent the elves from panicing while he's gone, one of the other elves comes up with a machine that can create a duplicate full size &quot;toy&quot; Santa. With the temporary Santa in place, Scott begins to see the effects of his desantafying, in other words, he returns to looking like Scott Calvin. There's another problem awaiting Scott when he returns home--his son Charlie has been &quot;tagging&quot; (i.e. painting graffiti) the high school he's going to and has been caught his his principle Carol(Elizabeth Mitchell).Scott returns home and ends up staying with his ex-wife and her husband (the clueless and marvelous Judge Reinhold). Scott's ex sets him up on a number of blind dates (as mentioned before we only see one but it is quite funny). When Charlie gets caught tagging again at the school, Scott negoiates detention vs. having his son expelled but there's a catch--Scott has to help Charlie serve detention. Scott suddenly notices a romantic spark between he and Carol. When Scott decides to woo her the film has some of its most effecting moments.Back at the North Pole the Toy Santa has gone bananas--after reviewing the rule book, he decides that every child in the world deserves a lump of coal. He also decides to retool the toy factory into a coal factory. Now Scott has to save his position as Santa and Christmas.Tim Allen is marvelous as both Scott Calvin, Santa and the Toy Santa. His natural comedic flair and timing help make the tone of the film (which veers from comedy to a number of touching moments) work. Elizabeth Mitchell also gives a nicely nuanced performance as Carol. Despite her beauty, she's believable as the drill disciplinarian princple and Scott's love interest. I was really surprised to see the young actor who played Charlie in the first movie in this one as well. Unlike a lot of child actors, he's managed to retain many of the qualities that made him so effective in the role in the first place. Although Judge Reinhold has made a number of stinker movies over the past decade, it doesn't detract from his ability to light up the screen. He's a natural, goofy comic presence.The DVD comes with a number of deleted scenes and it's pretty clear why they were deleted. Still, the scene between Mother Nature and Father Time would have been great in the movie. The cameos include appearences by Michael Dorn (Worf from Star Trek) as the Sandman, Peter Boyle as Father Time and Kevin Pollack as a love challenged Cupid.The gag reel isn't quite as funny as I would have thought but there is a chuckle or two there. The True Confessions of The Legendary Figures features &quot;interviews&quot; with the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Mother Nature and there's also Operation Toy BOx: Save Santa Set Top Game which I didn't have a chance to try.DVD Rom features include Coloring Book Activity, a fairly lame Reindeer Games gameas well as two other games I didn't have the time to try.The Santa Clause 2 is fun entertainment for the whole family. While it isn't quite as original as the first movie, there's still plenty of creative invention that keeps this film rolling along.",3,Santa needs to watch out for the fine print...,1069545600,"11 23, 2003",2003,3812,"['honestly', 'had', 'pretty', 'low', 'expectations', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'utterly', 'charming', 'law', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'usually', 'applies', 'sequels', 'was', 'very', 'pleasnatly', 'surprised', 'find', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'inventive', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'charming', 'movie', 'number', 'sequences', 'rank', 'there', 'first', 'movie', 'film', 'bit', 'rushed', 'end', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'blind', 'date', 'movie', 'heck', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'SNL', 'great', 'little', 'scene', '.It', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'Santa', 'missed', 'little', 'bit', 'fine', 'print', 'Santa', 'contract', 'find', 'Mrs', 'Clause', ""'ll"", 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'Santa', 'prevent', 'elves', 'panicing', 'gone', 'one', 'other', 'elves', 'up', 'machine', 'can', 'create', 'duplicate', 'full', 'size', 'quot', 'quot', 'Santa', 'temporary', 'Santa', 'place', 'Scott', 'see', 'effects', 'desantafying', 'other', 'words', 'looking', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'problem', 'awaiting', 'Scott', 'when', 'home', 'son', 'Charlie', 'been', 'quot', 'tagging', 'quot', 'i.e', 'painting', 'graffiti', 'high', 'school', 'going', 'been', 'caught', 'principle', 'Carol', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', '.Scott', 'home', 'up', 'staying', 'ex-wife', 'husband', 'clueless', 'marvelous', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Scott', 'ex', 'sets', 'up', 'number', 'blind', 'dates', 'mentioned', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'quite', 'funny', 'When', 'Charlie', 'caught', 'tagging', 'again', 'school', 'Scott', 'detention', 'vs.', 'having', 'son', 'expelled', 'catch', 'Scott', 'help', 'Charlie', 'serve', 'detention', 'Scott', 'suddenly', 'romantic', 'spark', 'Carol', 'When', 'Scott', 'woo', 'film', 'most', 'effecting', 'moments.Back', 'North', 'Pole', 'Toy', 'Santa', 'gone', 'bananas', 'reviewing', 'rule', 'book', 'child', 'world', 'lump', 'coal', 'also', 'retool', 'toy', 'factory', 'coal', 'factory', 'Now', 'Scott', 'save', 'position', 'Santa', 'Christmas.Tim', 'Allen', 'marvelous', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'Santa', 'Toy', 'Santa', 'natural', 'comedic', 'flair', 'timing', 'help', 'make', 'tone', 'film', 'veers', 'comedy', 'number', 'touching', 'moments', 'work', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'also', 'nicely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Carol', 'beauty', 'believable', 'drill', 'disciplinarian', 'princple', 'Scott', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'see', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Charlie', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'child', 'actors', 'managed', 'retain', 'many', 'qualities', 'made', 'so', 'effective', 'role', 'first', 'place', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'made', 'number', 'stinker', 'movies', 'past', 'decade', ""n't"", 'detract', 'ability', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'natural', 'goofy', 'comic', 'presence.The', 'DVD', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'pretty', 'clear', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'Still', 'scene', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'Father', 'Time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'cameos', 'include', 'appearences', 'Michael', 'Dorn', 'Worf', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Sandman', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Father', 'Time', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'love', 'challenged', 'Cupid.The', 'gag', 'reel', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'chuckle', 'two', 'there', 'True', 'Confessions', 'Legendary', 'Figures', 'quot', 'interviews', 'quot', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'also', 'Operation', 'Toy', 'BOx', 'Save', 'Santa', 'Set', 'Top', 'Game', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'try.DVD', 'Rom', 'features', 'include', 'Coloring', 'Book', 'Activity', 'fairly', 'lame', 'Reindeer', 'Games', 'gameas', 'well', 'two', 'other', 'games', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'try.The', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'family', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'original', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'plenty', 'creative', 'invention', 'film', 'rolling', 'along']",Santa Clause 2
