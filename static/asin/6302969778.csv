You could watch ""Knife in the Water"" in Polish without any subtitles and still get chills.  A young, privileged couple pick up a hitchhiker and take him out on their boat for the day.  That's it.  The rest is the suspense that builds between the three, especially between the two men, almost destined by biology and the nature of confined spaces to fight it out over the girl, at least symbolically, if not literally, to the death.

348527,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302969778,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I think most people know who Roman Polanski is.  I mean, he's made such classics as `Chinatown' and the recent Oscar darling `The Pianist'.  Sadly, even if you know who he is, most likely you've never seen his debut film `Noz w Wodzie'.  This small yet startlingly powerful character study pits man against man in what may be one of the better directorial debut's in cinema.The films premise sounds rather simple.  You have a couple who are getting ready for a day of sailing when a young hitchhiker jumps out in front of their car.  They reluctantly give him a lift, and then for no apparent reason they invite him to sail with them for the day.  The couple is already at odds with one another.  The husband is quite older than his bride, and maybe that plays into their confliction, but this new face (a young man around the same age as the wife) presents a further struggle for the couple.This is where the film transcends its `simple' plot.The husband and the hitchhiker find themselves at odds as they struggle to outdo the other.  In everything they feel as though their male ego is being bruised by the presence of the other.  The husband, no doubt trying to prove his superiority, invited the hitchhiker to join them thinking he was an easy target.  This young man is more than up for the challenge though, and that proves to be almost too much for the husband to take.  The wife seems almost confused by the actions of the men around her, but as the day trickles away she begins to disgust both of them.  As the two men continue to look for ways to humiliate the other they bring themselves to a dark place, where one contemplates murder and the other contemplates adultery.The film works almost perfectly.  Polanski knows how to build tension very well, and he delivers a fluid and tightly woven film with some nicely crafted performances as well.  I will say that the film can, at times, feel long.  The score, which I appreciated at first, kind of gave some of the scenes a soap opera vibe and I think that took away from the serious nature of the film.  The acting is good, but never truly great.  The two leading men (Leon Niemczyk and Zygmunt Malanowicz) are very good in scenes, but Jolanta Umecka is merely `there', never really taking hold of the potential within her character.The films final moments are brilliantly realized, and the final act of dominance that comes is superbly understated (I love how this film plays everything so small so as to create a beautiful illusion that nothing that extraordinary is happening).  This is a must see film that is elevated by Polanski's marvelous direction (hard to believe this is his debut) that exemplifies intensity with every sharp turn of the camera.",4,Sometimes the darkest creatures known to man are men themselves...,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,2719,"['think', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'mean', 'made', 'such', 'classics', 'Chinatown', 'recent', 'Oscar', 'darling', 'Pianist', 'Sadly', 'even', 'know', 'who', 'most', 'likely', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'debut', 'film', 'Noz', 'w', 'Wodzie', 'small', 'yet', 'startlingly', 'powerful', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'man', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'directorial', 'debut', 'cinema.The', 'films', 'premise', 'rather', 'simple', 'have', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'day', 'sailing', 'when', 'young', 'hitchhiker', 'out', 'front', 'car', 'reluctantly', 'give', 'lift', 'then', 'apparent', 'reason', 'invite', 'sail', 'day', 'couple', 'already', 'odds', 'one', 'husband', 'quite', 'older', 'bride', 'maybe', 'confliction', 'new', 'face', 'young', 'man', 'same', 'age', 'wife', 'further', 'struggle', 'couple.This', 'where', 'film', 'simple', 'plot.The', 'husband', 'hitchhiker', 'find', 'odds', 'struggle', 'outdo', 'other', 'everything', 'feel', 'male', 'ego', 'being', 'bruised', 'presence', 'other', 'husband', 'doubt', 'trying', 'prove', 'superiority', 'invited', 'hitchhiker', 'join', 'thinking', 'was', 'easy', 'target', 'young', 'man', 'more', 'challenge', 'be', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'husband', 'take', 'wife', 'almost', 'confused', 'actions', 'men', 'day', 'away', 'disgust', 'two', 'men', 'continue', 'look', 'ways', 'humiliate', 'other', 'bring', 'dark', 'place', 'where', 'one', 'murder', 'other', 'adultery.The', 'film', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'Polanski', 'how', 'build', 'tension', 'very', 'well', 'fluid', 'tightly', 'woven', 'film', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'can', 'times', 'feel', 'long', 'score', 'appreciated', 'first', 'kind', 'gave', 'scenes', 'soap', 'opera', 'vibe', 'think', 'took', 'away', 'serious', 'nature', 'film', 'acting', 'good', 'never', 'truly', 'great', 'two', 'leading', 'men', 'Leon', 'Niemczyk', 'Zygmunt', 'Malanowicz', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'Jolanta', 'Umecka', 'merely', 'there', 'never', 'really', 'taking', 'hold', 'potential', 'character.The', 'films', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'realized', 'final', 'act', 'dominance', 'superbly', 'understated', 'love', 'how', 'film', 'everything', 'so', 'small', 'so', 'create', 'beautiful', 'illusion', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'happening', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'elevated', 'Polanski', 'marvelous', 'direction', 'hard', 'believe', 'debut', 'intensity', 'sharp', 'turn', 'camera']",Knife in the Water VHS

348530,A2EWA6WBOJO1QC,6302969778,"bdlion ""Have Gun Will Travel""","[43, 46]","A fascinating, suspensful film debut for Roman Polanski, who already shows great promise with his amazingly original camera angles and creative shots. However, Criterion allowed Polanski to dictate the terms of the disc in which the step back/forward function is disabled. This is maddening, especially if one misses a subtitle or two when pondering some of his amazing shots.Another complaint I have is about the subtitles. I don't speak Polish, but it seems to me there is a lot of spoken dialogue that is not translated into English. I can recall several instances when the characters speak, but no subtitles appear. A harmless error, or a glaring mistake? I don't have an answer.This doesn't detract from the movie itself, which is excellent. Five stars would have been given if not for these flaws. However, I do hope Criterion does not repeat the very rude mistake of disabling disc functions in any other future editions of their releases.

348531,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6302969778,Bomojaz,"[5, 5]","A married couple (played by Leon Niemczyk and Jolanta Umecka) on their way to the harbor and a yachting outing pick up a young hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz). From then on the two men engage each other in a childish but brutal war of wills, as each tries to outbully the other. Malanowicz joins the couple on their yacht and near the end falls overboard; when he doesn't surface Niemczyk dives in after him. A short while later Malanowicz re-emerges, hops back on board, and makes love with Umecka. Niemczyk and Umecka later confront each other with some upsetting truths about the incident.This was Roman Polanski's first feature film, and it reveals what a master he was already; he knows exactly how to build the tension between Niemczyk and Malanowicz, heightening it ever more by having Umecka, who doesn't say or do much, always in the picture prancing around in her bikini or short sun dresses: the sexual tension is intense. Polanski's use of symbols - the knife, the pole, the wind directing the boat this way and that - is also masterful. Some think this is Polanski's best movie or that he never made better movies once he came to America, but they must be forgetting CHINATOWN.

348532,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6302969778,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[6, 13]","This slight yet compelling film worked its way into the NY Times' list of ""1000 best films ever made,"" so I thought I'd give it a look.  Like most Americans who came of age in the ""Star Wars"" era, I've always found foreign films to be nearly impenetrable, for the most part, so I'm a bit handicapped by the way I've become accustomed to Hollywood spoon-feeding stories to me without a lot of subtext.....and this is a film brimming with subtext like a Hemingway novel.The film opens with a couple taking a silent Sunday drive to the marina for a day of sailing.  The tension is palpable; this couple, as one will later sing about on a dare, has lost the passion of their relationship.  They encounter a teenaged hitchhiker who hails them by standing in the middle of the road; the husband says he should have run the guy over but angrily accedes to his wife's unspoken desire to give him a ride.  This pair knows each other quite well.For some bizarre reason they take the hitching teen sailing with them, and while this is later explained I never bought the explanation as to why they would invite him or as to why he would accept, when he apparently has someplace farther down the road and this ride was only part of the way to his destination.  Since the entire film hangs on their decision to sail, all three on a sloop, everything that follows is IMO tainted by lack of a plausible explanation.  Ultimately it's a Hemingway-ish unspoken he-man ""king of the mountain"" competition, apparently.One cannot fault director Roman Polanski's choice of camera angles, the cinematography (reminds me of the Swedish films of the time), or the inerrant acting skills of the three (this is critical because there are only three human characters on screen for the duration; one could certainly make a case for nature being the fourth character and the student's knife as the fifth).  Ultimately the story has a satisfying payoff, and one can even accept the gamesmanship that goes on among the various relationships within this triangle.  But the fatal flaw, to my view, is the inexplicable decision of the writer to invite the student to sail with them, and the equally inexplicable decision of the student to accept.  The only plausible explanation to me would be mutually macho posturing, something so banal to me that it's as bad as having no explanation at all.I never did care for Hemingway.",3,If Hemingway were Polish,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,2388,"['slight', 'yet', 'compelling', 'film', 'worked', 'way', 'NY', 'Times', 'list', '1000', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'look', 'most', 'Americans', 'who', 'came', 'age', 'Star', 'Wars', 'era', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'foreign', 'films', 'be', 'nearly', 'impenetrable', 'most', 'part', ""'m"", 'bit', 'handicapped', 'way', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'Hollywood', 'spoon-feeding', 'stories', 'lot', 'subtext', '..and', 'film', 'brimming', 'subtext', 'Hemingway', 'novel.The', 'film', 'couple', 'taking', 'silent', 'Sunday', 'drive', 'marina', 'day', 'sailing', 'tension', 'palpable', 'couple', 'one', 'will', 'later', 'sing', 'dare', 'lost', 'passion', 'relationship', 'encounter', 'teenaged', 'hitchhiker', 'who', 'standing', 'middle', 'road', 'husband', 'should', 'have', 'run', 'guy', 'angrily', 'accedes', 'wife', 'unspoken', 'desire', 'give', 'ride', 'pair', 'other', 'quite', 'well.For', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'take', 'hitching', 'teen', 'sailing', 'later', 'explained', 'never', 'bought', 'explanation', 'why', 'would', 'invite', 'why', 'would', 'accept', 'when', 'apparently', 'someplace', 'farther', 'road', 'ride', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'way', 'destination', 'entire', 'film', 'hangs', 'decision', 'sail', 'three', 'sloop', 'everything', 'IMO', 'tainted', 'lack', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'Hemingway-ish', 'unspoken', 'he-man', 'king', 'mountain', 'competition', 'apparently.One', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'choice', 'camera', 'angles', 'cinematography', 'Swedish', 'films', 'time', 'inerrant', 'acting', 'skills', 'three', 'critical', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'human', 'characters', 'screen', 'duration', 'one', 'could', 'certainly', 'make', 'case', 'nature', 'being', 'fourth', 'character', 'student', 'knife', 'fifth', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'satisfying', 'payoff', 'one', 'can', 'even', 'accept', 'gamesmanship', 'various', 'relationships', 'triangle', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'view', 'inexplicable', 'decision', 'writer', 'invite', 'student', 'sail', 'equally', 'inexplicable', 'decision', 'student', 'accept', 'only', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'would', 'be', 'mutually', 'macho', 'posturing', 'something', 'so', 'banal', 'as', 'bad', 'having', 'explanation', 'all.I', 'never', 'did', 'care', 'Hemingway']",Knife in the Water VHS

348534,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,6302969778,Christopher Culver,"[1, 1]","Released in 1962, KNIFE IN THE WATER (Polish: N&oacute;z w wodzie) was director Roman Polanski's full-length debut. Married couple Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are driving to the marina when they pick up a hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz). Though Andrzej is initially angry at the young man for standing the middle of the road, he invites him to come sailing. Once on the boat, tension arises between the two men because of Krystyna sexual appeal and the hitchhiker's poverty versus Andrzej's affluence. Not only is the title a metaphor for the boat as it moves through the lake, but it also refers to the intimidating knife that the young man carries with him.KNIFE IN THE WATER is entertaining enough. The cinematography on the lake and the low-key soundtrack by jazz legend Krzysztof Komeda are memorable. But personally I don't find this to be an especially great film. It feels derivative of Italian cinema of the time, without an original touch. The casting of the weathered, 32 year-old Malanowicz as a 19 year-old student undermines its credibility. I suspect that the film gained so much attention on release due to its risque nature (especially novel in a film from the Eastern Bloc) instead of its intrinsic merit.The Criterion Collection release of this film consists of two DVDs.

But I can only say that after many years of having been a Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown fan --I think Roman Polanski is a better director than WRITER.The discordant inconsistent nature of all of these films is part of their charm but it prevented me from caring for even one of Polanski's characters. This does not seem to be of any concer for him. Atmosphere is everything, and as is evidenced all over the place in his student films, he will sacrifice all other semblances of narrative if accomlpishes this.Probably my favorite piece in the entire collection is the ""When Angels Fall"" short from 1959. The dream-imagery here foreshadows much of Rosemary's decent into paranoia and hallucinatory states -- so as a lover of that film I found it very interesting to see these roots.

Filmed principally aboard a sailboat in the lake region of northern Poland the film examines the potentially explosive interactions between three people confined in this restricted setting.A squabbling couple pick up a young hitchhiker on their way to the marina where they are about to embark on a weekend sailing trip.  The husband an arrogant, bourgeoise writer Andrzej decides to invite the young man along for reasons that will soon become apparent.  The hitchhiker, a landlubber is initially ill at ease on the water.  The wife Krystyna is sympathetic to his plight.  Andrzej however uses this as a wedge to commence berating the boy to help evoke within himself feelings of superiority.The drama continues with the writer putting down the boy to bolster his own ego in front of his wife.  A storm hits and the group in forced below decks where the confrontation continues and threatens to erupt in violence.Ultimately the plot reaches a climax when the writer throws the boys treasured knife into the water causing the boy, who could not swim, to dive in after it and apparently drown.Polanski using a cast of only three demonstrates his immense skill in fabricating a taut drama with a nicely conceived plot and very decent cinematography on a shoestring budget.",4,The conflicted male ego,1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,1393,"['Knife', 'Water', 'early', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'effort', 'simple', 'unfettered', 'yet', 'analytical', 'probe', 'human', 'condition', 'Filmed', 'principally', 'sailboat', 'lake', 'region', 'northern', 'Poland', 'film', 'potentially', 'explosive', 'interactions', 'three', 'people', 'confined', 'restricted', 'setting.A', 'squabbling', 'couple', 'pick', 'up', 'young', 'hitchhiker', 'way', 'marina', 'where', 'are', 'embark', 'weekend', 'sailing', 'trip', 'husband', 'arrogant', 'bourgeoise', 'writer', 'Andrzej', 'invite', 'young', 'man', 'reasons', 'will', 'soon', 'become', 'apparent', 'hitchhiker', 'landlubber', 'initially', 'ill', 'ease', 'water', 'wife', 'Krystyna', 'sympathetic', 'plight', 'Andrzej', 'however', 'wedge', 'commence', 'berating', 'boy', 'help', 'evoke', 'feelings', 'superiority.The', 'drama', 'writer', 'putting', 'down', 'boy', 'bolster', 'own', 'ego', 'front', 'wife', 'storm', 'hits', 'group', 'forced', 'decks', 'where', 'confrontation', 'erupt', 'violence.Ultimately', 'plot', 'climax', 'when', 'writer', 'boys', 'treasured', 'knife', 'water', 'causing', 'boy', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'swim', 'dive', 'apparently', 'drown.Polanski', 'using', 'cast', 'only', 'three', 'immense', 'skill', 'fabricating', 'taut', 'drama', 'nicely', 'conceived', 'plot', 'very', 'decent', 'cinematography', 'shoestring', 'budget']",Knife in the Water VHS
348537,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6302969778,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 4]","Roman Polanski is at his best as a filmmaker when he focuses on the realist and small moments of horror in a human life. When he goes a bit overboard, and into the grotesque or surreal, such as in The Fearless Vampire Killers, or: Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Neck, Rosemary's Baby, or Chinatown, his films tend to lose their way, even if still good. When his focus remains tightly on the real, such as in Repulsion or The Pianist, his films are amongst the best on screen. His very first feature film, 1962's Knife In The Water (N&oacute;z W Wodzie), is more in line with the latter films, and as such, is one of the best debut films in cinema history, and was even a nominee for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1963 Academy Awards, where it lost to Federico Fellini's 8.Filmed in black and white, not long after Polanski finished film school, the 94 minute film features only three characters- not a single other actor, not even an extra, and is a taut psychological exploration of masculinity and testosterone. Yet, despite that, it's a stretch to term the film a `thriller,' as many critics have. There is very little action in the film, at least in a material sense. The real crux of the film revolves about the mental games that the two male characters play with each other, to impress the lone female in their group. In a sense, the film has much in common with many of the American television dramas of the 1950s, even though it was filmed on a real lake.The film opens with a married couple driving in the countryside, early one Sunday morning. They are headed to their boat on the lake. He is a fortysomething, dark-haired sportswriter and avid sailor, named Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk), while his brunet wife, Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka), is a bit younger, nearing thirty, and at first seems a bit chunky and nebbishy, as she wears cat-like granny glasses. As the film progresses, she will appear more and more svelte and sexy, and it is this subtle evolution which seems to kick the two males into overdrive. The third character is a blond hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz), in his early twenties, whose name is never revealed throughout the film. Andrzej nearly runs him down on the road, then offers him a ride, seemingly to show off his prowess in front of his wife. He rides with them to the deserted marina, and is about to take off, when Andrzej offers to let him come on the trip on their sailboat, the Christine. After first declining, the young man accepts, stating he knew Andrzej would ask. This is his first upping of the ante, as he lets it be known that he is no naf. Krystyna merely watches the two men tangle, early on.... Another thing that sets the film apart from lesser works is that it was very cogent in its critiques of Soviet dominated Poland, yet it still works today at a more personal level. As example, in its day, there was a direct stab at the supposed classlessness of a Communist society, for the married couple are obviously well off Party apparatchiks- replete with a fancy car, yacht and apartment, who worry if their windshield wipers will be stolen, if they leave their car for a day. They are stolen, at film's end, but even such a worry says much for the dire state of things in the Soviet bloc. The young hitchhiker is the common man, the young idealistic sort that totalitarian states despise, and a good deal of the tension between the men has to do not only with testosterone, but with class differences. But, it is the testosteronic tension that still resonates and carries the film today. Also, there is a Twilight Zone-like otherworldliness to this film that also resonates. After all, it's a Sunday morning, there are many other boats docked in the marina, but only the three characters in the film are boating, as if they are occupying some usually unseen portion of an Apocalyptic film's world.Knife In The Water is a quiet film, unlike showier Hollywood knockoffs, thus why it still works, and has not dated. It could be set in any part of the world over the last hundred or so years, for the setup is timeless, even if Polanski's denouement is unique. If Andrzej wins, and the youth is really dead, there is the classic might makes right motif. If the youth dispatches Andrzej, then there is the classic father/son conflict, but if the film ends with all three surviving, and with the woman holding the upper hand in a conflicted state between the three, then the narrative has taken a turn toward realism and depth with strong claims to being great art. Polanski makes all the right choices in this film. That all the `action' takes place in about a twenty-four hour period only heightens the intensity of the subtle gamesmanship on all three parties' parts, and allows the narrative to be both naturalistic, yet also classically dramatic. When one can get `the best of both worlds,' to such a degree, one is accomplishing alot, and Roman Polanski's Knife In The Water does that and much more. Would more art supply the `much more' it often promises, works like this film would not surprise and delight the viewer to such a satisfying degree.",4,Great debut,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,5107,"['Roman', 'Polanski', 'best', 'filmmaker', 'when', 'realist', 'small', 'moments', 'horror', 'human', 'life', 'When', 'bit', 'overboard', 'grotesque', 'surreal', 'such', 'Fearless', 'Vampire', 'Killers', 'Pardon', 'Me', 'Teeth', 'Are', 'My', 'Neck', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Chinatown', 'films', 'tend', 'lose', 'way', 'even', 'still', 'good', 'When', 'focus', 'tightly', 'real', 'such', 'Repulsion', 'Pianist', 'films', 'are', 'best', 'screen', 'very', 'first', 'feature', 'film', '1962', 'Knife', 'Water', 'N', 'oacute', 'W', 'Wodzie', 'more', 'line', 'latter', 'films', 'such', 'one', 'best', 'debut', 'films', 'cinema', 'history', 'was', 'even', 'nominee', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', '1963', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'where', 'lost', 'Federico', 'Fellini', '8.Filmed', 'black', 'white', 'not', 'long', 'Polanski', 'finished', 'film', 'school', '94', 'minute', 'film', 'only', 'three', 'characters-', 'not', 'single', 'other', 'actor', 'not', 'even', 'extra', 'taut', 'psychological', 'exploration', 'masculinity', 'testosterone', 'stretch', 'term', 'film', 'thriller', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'film', 'least', 'material', 'sense', 'real', 'crux', 'film', 'mental', 'games', 'two', 'male', 'characters', 'play', 'other', 'impress', 'lone', 'female', 'group', 'sense', 'film', 'much', 'common', 'many', 'American', 'television', 'dramas', '1950s', 'even', 'was', 'filmed', 'real', 'lake.The', 'film', 'married', 'couple', 'driving', 'countryside', 'early', 'one', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'are', 'headed', 'boat', 'lake', 'fortysomething', 'dark-haired', 'sportswriter', 'avid', 'sailor', 'named', 'Andrzej', 'Leon', 'Niemczyk', 'brunet', 'wife', 'Krystyna', 'Jolanta', 'Umecka', 'bit', 'younger', 'nearing', 'thirty', 'first', 'bit', 'chunky', 'nebbishy', 'cat-like', 'granny', 'glasses', 'film', 'will', 'appear', 'more', 'more', 'svelte', 'sexy', 'subtle', 'evolution', 'kick', 'two', 'males', 'overdrive', 'third', 'character', 'blond', 'hitchhiker', 'Zygmunt', 'Malanowicz', 'early', 'twenties', 'name', 'never', 'revealed', 'film', 'Andrzej', 'nearly', 'down', 'road', 'then', 'ride', 'seemingly', 'show', 'off', 'prowess', 'front', 'wife', 'deserted', 'marina', 'take', 'off', 'when', 'Andrzej', 'let', 'come', 'trip', 'sailboat', 'Christine', 'first', 'declining', 'young', 'man', 'accepts', 'stating', 'knew', 'Andrzej', 'would', 'ask', 'first', 'upping', 'ante', 'be', 'known', 'naf', 'Krystyna', 'merely', 'two', 'men', 'tangle', 'early', 'thing', 'film', 'apart', 'lesser', 'works', 'was', 'very', 'cogent', 'critiques', 'Soviet', 'dominated', 'Poland', 'yet', 'still', 'today', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'example', 'day', 'was', 'direct', 'stab', 'supposed', 'classlessness', 'Communist', 'society', 'married', 'couple', 'are', 'obviously', 'well', 'Party', 'apparatchiks-', 'replete', 'fancy', 'car', 'yacht', 'apartment', 'who', 'worry', 'windshield', 'wipers', 'will', 'be', 'stolen', 'leave', 'car', 'day', 'are', 'stolen', 'film', 'end', 'even', 'worry', 'much', 'dire', 'state', 'things', 'Soviet', 'bloc', 'young', 'hitchhiker', 'common', 'man', 'young', 'idealistic', 'sort', 'totalitarian', 'states', 'despise', 'good', 'deal', 'tension', 'men', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'testosterone', 'class', 'differences', 'testosteronic', 'tension', 'still', 'film', 'today', 'Also', 'Twilight', 'Zone-like', 'otherworldliness', 'film', 'also', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'boats', 'docked', 'marina', 'only', 'three', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'boating', 'are', 'occupying', 'usually', 'unseen', 'portion', 'Apocalyptic', 'film', 'world.Knife', 'Water', 'quiet', 'film', 'showier', 'Hollywood', 'knockoffs', 'thus', 'why', 'still', 'not', 'dated', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'part', 'world', 'last', 'hundred', 'so', 'years', 'setup', 'timeless', 'even', 'Polanski', 'denouement', 'unique', 'Andrzej', 'youth', 'really', 'dead', 'classic', 'might', 'right', 'motif', 'youth', 'dispatches', 'Andrzej', 'then', 'classic', 'father/son', 'conflict', 'film', 'three', 'surviving', 'woman', 'holding', 'upper', 'hand', 'conflicted', 'state', 'three', 'then', 'narrative', 'taken', 'turn', 'realism', 'depth', 'strong', 'claims', 'being', 'great', 'art', 'Polanski', 'right', 'choices', 'film', 'action', 'place', 'twenty-four', 'hour', 'period', 'only', 'intensity', 'subtle', 'gamesmanship', 'three', 'parties', 'parts', 'narrative', 'be', 'naturalistic', 'yet', 'also', 'classically', 'dramatic', 'When', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'best', 'worlds', 'degree', 'one', 'accomplishing', 'alot', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Knife', 'Water', 'much', 'more', 'Would', 'more', 'art', 'supply', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'surprise', 'delight', 'viewer', 'satisfying', 'degree']",Knife in the Water VHS

A wealthy couple on its way to spend a weekend on their yacht picks up a young and attractive hitchhiker. The middle-aged husband, a successful and cynical sportswriter invites the young man on board, perhaps to show off his nice yacht, his seamanship, and eventually, his superiority. His young and sexy wife does not say much but as the yacht moves along and tension between two men rises, she seems to enjoy the presence of a passenger and the obvious competition between them for her attention.Made of the very simple material, the film is a brilliant psychological thriller that shows the young writer-director's extraordinary ability to create menace on the screen throughout the profound study of the characters' deep hidden emotions.

The three characters, (the only three people seen in the entire movie, as a cost saving measure Polanski tells us in the DVD extra), are as perfectly formed and developed, understated and powerful, as we could expect from an Ingmar Bergman troupe of actors. Unlike most DVD extra director interviews, Polanski's inclusion of surprising facts about the film actually enhances the viewing of it. We learn of the difficulties involved with getting a film accepted by the then, (1962), socialist minded, communist controlled Polish film board, which explains some unusual dialogue concerning the difficulties of being a university student. The dialogue was added only after the censor board determined the film was of no social value.  The actress, Jolanta Umecka, in an accomplished solid performance, was discovered at a municipal swimming pool, specifically for the casting of the film, and had no previous acting credentials. The actor, Zygmunt Malanowicz, had an inappropriate high pitched voice, so it was dubbed by Polanski's own speaking voice. The film itself is perfect satisfying drama. The DVD extras, including several Polanski student films, makes it shine all the more.",5,"CRITERION COLLECTION OF POLANSKI'S ""KNIFE IN THE WATER""",1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,1456,"['Three', 'people', 'fairly', 'leisurely', 'sailboat', 'excursion', 'Polish', 'lake', 'rather', 'dull', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'absorbing', 'intense', 'drama', 'even', 'mundane', 'manual', 'rigors', 'sailing', 'becomes', 'exciting', 'metaphor', 'human', 'manipulation', 'three', 'characters', 'only', 'three', 'people', 'seen', 'entire', 'movie', 'cost', 'saving', 'measure', 'Polanski', 'DVD', 'extra', 'are', 'perfectly', 'formed', 'developed', 'understated', 'powerful', 'could', 'expect', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'troupe', 'actors', 'most', 'DVD', 'extra', 'director', 'interviews', 'Polanski', 'inclusion', 'surprising', 'facts', 'film', 'actually', 'viewing', 'learn', 'difficulties', 'involved', 'getting', 'film', 'accepted', 'then', '1962', 'socialist', 'minded', 'communist', 'controlled', 'Polish', 'film', 'board', 'unusual', 'dialogue', 'concerning', 'difficulties', 'being', 'university', 'student', 'dialogue', 'was', 'added', 'only', 'censor', 'board', 'determined', 'film', 'was', 'social', 'value', 'actress', 'Jolanta', 'Umecka', 'accomplished', 'solid', 'performance', 'was', 'discovered', 'municipal', 'swimming', 'pool', 'specifically', 'casting', 'film', 'had', 'previous', 'acting', 'credentials', 'actor', 'Zygmunt', 'Malanowicz', 'had', 'inappropriate', 'high', 'pitched', 'voice', 'was', 'dubbed', 'Polanski', 'own', 'speaking', 'voice', 'film', 'perfect', 'satisfying', 'drama', 'DVD', 'extras', 'including', 'several', 'Polanski', 'student', 'films', 'shine', 'more']",Knife in the Water VHS

It is much better than I remember since I saw it when it was first shown in the U. S. The plot is simple and straight-forward. A Polish couple, Leon Niemczyk and Jolanta Umecka, pick up a young hitchhiker Zygmunt Malanowicz and invite him to go sailing with them on a beautiful Polish lake. These three are the only characters in this low budget film although the lack of money certainly did not affect its quality. The movie teems with sexual energy as well as a certain scary quality that Polanski of course was to perfect in later works. Much is made of the hitcher's knife (phallic symbol?) which he bandies about and the viewer is never certain that something ominous is not about to happen. There isn't a lot of dialogue although not much is necessary so the subtitles aren't much of a bother.Shot in beautiful black and white, the film often has the look of still photography. Some of the frames are suitable for framing. Polanski in a very informative interview included with the DVD discusses his art school and still photography background. He also says that the female in the movie had no previous acting experience and that he ""discovered"" her at a public swimming pool and that his own voice was dubbed for the young hitchhiker whose voice was too high pitched.The beautiful cinematography, the fine directing and understated acting make this film a joy to watch.",5,"Revisiting ""Knife in the Water""",1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,1572,"['gave', 'world', 'Chinatown', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Macbeth', 'Pianist', 'Tess', 'great', 'Polish', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'released', 'first', 'feature', 'film', '1962', 'Knife', 'Water', 'much', 'better', 'remember', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'U.', 'S.', 'plot', 'simple', 'straight-forward', 'Polish', 'couple', 'Leon', 'Niemczyk', 'Jolanta', 'Umecka', 'pick', 'up', 'young', 'hitchhiker', 'Zygmunt', 'Malanowicz', 'invite', 'go', 'sailing', 'beautiful', 'Polish', 'lake', 'three', 'are', 'only', 'characters', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'lack', 'money', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'affect', 'quality', 'movie', 'sexual', 'energy', 'as', 'well', 'certain', 'scary', 'quality', 'Polanski', 'course', 'was', 'perfect', 'later', 'works', 'Much', 'made', 'hitcher', 'knife', 'phallic', 'symbol', 'viewer', 'never', 'certain', 'something', 'ominous', 'not', 'happen', ""n't"", 'lot', 'dialogue', 'not', 'much', 'necessary', 'subtitles', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'bother.Shot', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'often', 'look', 'still', 'photography', 'frames', 'are', 'suitable', 'framing', 'Polanski', 'very', 'informative', 'interview', 'included', 'DVD', 'art', 'school', 'still', 'photography', 'background', 'also', 'female', 'movie', 'had', 'previous', 'acting', 'experience', 'discovered', 'public', 'swimming', 'pool', 'own', 'voice', 'was', 'dubbed', 'young', 'hitchhiker', 'voice', 'was', 'too', 'high', 'pitched.The', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'fine', 'directing', 'understated', 'acting', 'make', 'film', 'joy', 'watch']",Knife in the Water VHS

348551,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302969778,Randy Keehn,"[4, 6]","I recently saw ""Knife in the Water"" for the first time.  It was in Polish with subtitles which always means that the viewer has to watch intently.  That was OK because the actors all acted intently.  This is one of those European-style movies of the 1960's where people confront themselves.  Some of these movies do so in often outlandish settings.  However, the setting in ""Knife in the Water"" was so casual that I was beginning to wonder what could possibly happen to create a meaningful story.  I was gradually able to understand how the setting was able to work out quite well.The plot, for lack of a better term, has a couple in their 30's pick up a 19 year-old hitchhiker.  They do so after a near-disasterous ""run-in"" and the relationship between husband and hitchhiker becomes the focus of our attention.  The couple is on their way to a Sunday outing in their sailboat.  Hitchhiking is so bad on a Sunday (apparently few private cars in Poland and the truckers take the day off) that the couple invites the hitchhiker to join them.  This is about the point where I started to wonder, ""Where the heck is this movie going?""  However, the husband starts acting like a ship's captain treating the boy like a servant and he, in turns asserts his independence.  This friction is what carries the movie.  That may not sound like much but the subtlety of the script, direction and acting makes for a very introspective movie.  It explores the relationships of one to another (although these people should have realized early on that they didn't belong together).  The conflict escalates later in the movie and we are witness to the extreme examples of our inability to properly relate to one another.  I had figured out a couple of different ways for the movie to end but neither of them were used.  The actual ending left the picture unended.  A choice needed to be made; what was the right one?  In essence, the director left that up to the audience to decide.If this film is not noteworthy for anything else, it is important as the first film by the talented director, Roman Polanski.  After seeing his recent movie, ""The Pianist"", I was reminded what a genius Polanski is.  Much of that genius is present in ""Knife in the Water"" although this movie will be more limited in its' appeal.  If you like the writings of Camus and Sartre or the films of Bergman, this should be quite an enjoyable film to watch.  If you find that stuff boring or irrelevant, you'll probably react the same way to ""Knife in the Water"".

It stands out compared to other Polish films of the time because it has a contemporary story.  Other directors, such as Andrzej Wajda, did make films with contemporary stories but the majority of the Polish movies in the early 1960s were about the war.One remarkable aspect about this movie is there are only three actors.  There is a middle-age man named Andrzej, his young wife Krystyna and a young man.  The sparks that result from the trio are enough to totally keep the story interesting and suspenseful.On the way to the lake, the couple picks up a young man hitchhiking.  The young man is a wise guy and a risk taker.  They take him along with them to their boat and go sailing.  Andrzej sees the young man's character and wants to teach him a lesson.  Both of the men are very alike and get a kick out of the game of cat and mouse they play.  The men use shows of bravado and laughter as weapons, no doubt trying to not only outdo the other but also impress Krystyna.  Krystyna tries to keep the situation as calm as possible as both try to outwit each other.The tension builds and builds the longer they are together.  One can't help but think that the film is titled Knife in the Water.  How and when the knife will play a role is always on the back of one's mind.  Considering the great tension between the men, it just seems like a matter of time before the knife settles their dispute.Keeping in mind the story is relatively simple, just three people going on a boat together, Polanski has to be given a lot of credit that he made the film so intense.",5,It stands out compared to other Polish films,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,1637,"['Knife', 'Water', 'Noz', 'w', 'Wode', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'out', 'compared', 'other', 'Polish', 'films', 'time', 'contemporary', 'story', 'Other', 'directors', 'such', 'Andrzej', 'Wajda', 'did', 'make', 'films', 'contemporary', 'stories', 'majority', 'Polish', 'movies', 'early', '1960s', 'were', 'war.One', 'remarkable', 'aspect', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'actors', 'middle-age', 'man', 'named', 'Andrzej', 'young', 'wife', 'Krystyna', 'young', 'man', 'sparks', 'result', 'trio', 'are', 'enough', 'totally', 'keep', 'story', 'interesting', 'suspenseful.On', 'way', 'lake', 'couple', 'up', 'young', 'man', 'hitchhiking', 'young', 'man', 'wise', 'guy', 'risk', 'taker', 'take', 'along', 'boat', 'go', 'sailing', 'Andrzej', 'young', 'man', 'character', 'teach', 'lesson', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'alike', 'get', 'kick', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'play', 'men', 'use', 'shows', 'bravado', 'laughter', 'weapons', 'doubt', 'trying', 'not', 'only', 'outdo', 'other', 'also', 'impress', 'Krystyna', 'Krystyna', 'keep', 'situation', 'as', 'calm', 'possible', 'try', 'outwit', 'other.The', 'tension', 'builds', 'longer', 'are', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'film', 'titled', 'Knife', 'Water', 'How', 'when', 'knife', 'will', 'play', 'role', 'always', 'back', 'one', 'mind', 'Considering', 'great', 'tension', 'men', 'just', 'matter', 'time', 'knife', 'dispute.Keeping', 'mind', 'story', 'relatively', 'simple', 'just', 'three', 'people', 'going', 'boat', 'together', 'Polanski', 'be', 'given', 'lot', 'credit', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'intense']",Knife in the Water VHS

348556,ACM90BRKX73OG,6302969778,Tom,"[0, 1]","Knife in the Water, Roman Polanski's first film (1962), is widely considered to be one of the two greatest directorial debuts in film history next to Citizen Kane.An alpha male and his young, voluptuous wife pick up a hitchhiker and invite him for a day of sailing. The two roosters spend the following day and night posturing for the attention of the sumptuous female. A challenging premise for a 94 minute film? Most assuredly but Polanski pulls it off nicely. Leon Niemczyk is superb as the cocksure Andrezej. Jolanta Umecka, in her film debut, is tantalizing as the sexually ripe Krystyna. Zygmunt Malanowicz gives a decent performance as the unsure, young drifter. Not satisfied with Malanowicz's voice, Polanski ended up dubbing over it with his own. Polish jazz legend Krzysztof Komeda's score was cool at the time but rankles today. Jerzy Lipman's cinematography is outstanding.
