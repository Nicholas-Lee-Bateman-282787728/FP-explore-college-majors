The result was a little absurd, and while I'm not a fan of violence, it weakened the believability that the two gay main characters are a don's crackerjack team of hit men.  In an early scene, the ""bad guys"" fire shots, but somehow they are defeated with fists.  And then again, a militia armed to the teeth with firepower is foiled without any gunplay.  What??  Why??  If the movie was a fair amount more silly and campy, that might have worked but most of the main characters and their scenes are not comic.The movie explores the concept of internalized homophobia where the gay couple seek out the most masculine jobs (therefore, they're hit men) they can find.  They also find themselves offended at effeminate gay stereotypes.  An interesting concept, but it actually felt a little offensive anyway.  The idea that heterosexual mafiosi decided they had to act ridiculously flaming to pass as cater waiters was kind of misguided.  Moreover, the directors had to find a way to make the mafia hit men the good guys, and that was just a big mess.There are some funny moments, but I would sooner recommend movies such as Big Eden and Sordid Lives.",3,Really rather average,1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,1264,"['think', 'filmmakers', 'gave', 'hard', 'task', 'making', 'mafia', 'film', 'aiming', 'minimum', 'violence', 'result', 'was', 'little', 'absurd', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'violence', 'weakened', 'believability', 'two', 'gay', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'don', 'crackerjack', 'team', 'hit', 'men', 'early', 'scene', 'bad', 'guys', 'fire', 'shots', 'somehow', 'are', 'defeated', 'fists', 'then', 'again', 'militia', 'armed', 'teeth', 'firepower', 'foiled', 'gunplay', 'What', 'Why', 'movie', 'was', 'fair', 'amount', 'more', 'silly', 'campy', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'comic.The', 'movie', 'concept', 'internalized', 'homophobia', 'where', 'gay', 'couple', 'seek', 'most', 'masculine', 'jobs', 'therefore', ""'re"", 'hit', 'men', 'can', 'find', 'also', 'find', 'offended', 'effeminate', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'interesting', 'concept', 'actually', 'felt', 'little', 'offensive', 'anyway', 'idea', 'heterosexual', 'mafiosi', 'decided', 'had', 'act', 'ridiculously', 'flaming', 'pass', 'cater', 'waiters', 'was', 'kind', 'misguided', 'Moreover', 'directors', 'had', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'mafia', 'hit', 'men', 'good', 'guys', 'was', 'just', 'big', 'mess.There', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'would', 'sooner', 'recommend', 'movies', 'such', 'Big', 'Eden', 'Sordid', 'Lives']",N/A

My opinion?... throw out these actors, writers, and director and start over! The movie plays into stereotypes in a cheap and demeaning manner for all groups targeted in the movie: the mafia, Italians, gays, and the religious/militia-right. Example: teaching mafia members who are to pose as ""gay"" waiters means to act effeminate. This movie would have been better using this cast and director had the script been revised without the gay angle.The only way I ""knew"" Stephen and Danny were gay partners is because the trailer says so. Nothing in any of the scenes between these two suggested this is a partnership... no kissing, no touching (except for a 2-second hand-holding), not even a glance of affection- yawn! The two main characters come off as ""straight buddies/roommates,"" not two men who are supposed to have genuine feelings for each other. Christopher Gartin and Greg Lauren appeared ""bored"" playing these two. In so many scenes they both appear to have ""far away distant stares."" As a viewer, I asked myself many times, ""Hello? Is anyone home?"" (heh heh) The result is that Stephen and Danny come of as one-dimensional characters. The actors' portrayals look more like ""robots"" than ""people"" with their quality of acting in this film.Over all result? I became bored early watching this film, hoping it would get better, but it just kept sinking to lower depths. This is not a crisp, intelligent parody, but a cheap, ""flop-on-your-face,"" sophomoric effort. Anyone who believes this movie will foster an awareness or tolerance between the straight and gay communiities knows little of both groups. This movie is one of those ""sanitized"" efforts that goes to great attempts to dilute any actual reflection of gay men with feelings for each other and give them bland, shallow personalities so as not to offend all the ""grannies in Nebraska in their tennis shoes."" (heh heh)My recommendation for superior quality films in this genre? ""Gone, But Not Forgotten,"" ""All Over the Guy,"" ""Defying Gravity,"" or ""I Think I Do"" will better enlighten, entertain, and satisfy with more complex, sympathetic characters and quality plots than ""Friends and Family"" will.

772245,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0000C23FY,Get What We Give,"[2, 7]","Friends and Family could have been much better than it was. It SHOULD have been much better than it was. Lead actors Greg Lauren (Ralph Lauren's nephew) and Christopher Gartin are certainly game for the adventure. There are even a couple of really good actors in the mix: Tony Lo Bianco, Anna Maria Alberghetti, Tovuh Feldshuh, and comic actor Meshach Taylor. Unfortunately, director Kristen Coury and screenwriter Joseph Triebwasser are not really up to the task. The movie is somewhat clever, if not a rip off of several other films (the whole thing feels like ""The Wedding Banquet"" meets ""The Godfather"" meets ""They Went Thata Way and Thata Way"").Stephen and Danny are lovers who are out to everyone, including their parents - however, they are not OUT about their profession - they are lieutenants in the Mob - they kill people for a living. (Hilarious huh?) Stephen's parents (his father is an upper eschelon FBI guy) are dropping in for a visit and expect a big party for his father's sixtieth and since Stephen and Danny are big time caterers (or so they've told his parents) they know it will be great. Add to this that the daughter of Mr. Torcelli (the mob boss) is marrying a non-Italian and the fiance's parents are coming in for the party too (thinking it is for them). Here's the big hilarious catch: unbeknownst to the fiance, his parents are the leaders of an anti government faction and they want to use the party in New York as a spring board for their take over of the U.S.Wow! Can't believe I got all of that right! Can't believe they put all of that in this movie....As I said, Lauren and Gartin are up for the challenge. They look good and they are decent actors. Tovuh Feldshuh, who is a fine actress and has been very good in other parts is not only horribly miscast as the ""true"" leader of the anti government group, but she hams it up waaaaay beyond what the part calls for. Meshach Taylor is an after thought. He is doing some bizarre accent that has no nationality and comes off much more like his character Hollywood in ""Mannequin"" than anything else. One can only presume that his part is largely on the cutting room floor. Tony Lo Bianco is good as the mob boss, but far too self effacing. The whole thing feels like the only characters fleshed out well are the lead, gay characters. And interestingly, in 2003 when gay is everywhere and man to man kissing and affection can be found on cable and even on public television, these two lovers never so much as buss each other on the cheek.The whole premise is silly beyond belief - but it is intended to be so. However, the execution of it is never quite as it should be. Instead of feeling like comedy (and I'm sure some slapstick is intended) it just feels like it was done on the cheap and poorly executed. Ms. Coury shoots long shots from too far away and at very unflattering angles. She cannot direct an action sequence either. When the lovers are shown to be fighting an attempted hit on a mob boss...well, let's just say you could drive a Mack truck through the whole process...it's slow and obviously directed and not believable at all.Basically, there is a lot of stuff going on here that could be really good, but the script isn't tight enough and the direction isn't sharp enough to pull it all off. It would seem that there is enough material here for one and a half movies, but too much for the abilities of the technical staff of this film.Fun to watch and far better than most offerings from Wolf Video, Family and Friends is worth a look, but it's not going to break my belief that just because a movie is ""gay"" doesn't make it good.",2,"2 parts good, 1 part silly equals so so delivery",1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,3628,"['Friends', 'Family', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'Lead', 'actors', 'Greg', 'Lauren', 'Ralph', 'Lauren', 'nephew', 'Christopher', 'Gartin', 'are', 'certainly', 'game', 'adventure', 'are', 'even', 'couple', 'really', 'good', 'actors', 'mix', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Alberghetti', 'Tovuh', 'Feldshuh', 'comic', 'actor', 'Meshach', 'Taylor', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Kristen', 'Coury', 'screenwriter', 'Joseph', 'Triebwasser', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'task', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'clever', 'not', 'rip', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'Wedding', 'Banquet', 'Godfather', 'Went', 'Thata', 'Way', 'Thata', 'Way', '.Stephen', 'Danny', 'are', 'lovers', 'who', 'are', 'everyone', 'including', 'parents', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'profession', 'are', 'lieutenants', 'Mob', 'kill', 'people', 'living', 'Hilarious', 'huh', 'Stephen', 'parents', 'father', 'upper', 'eschelon', 'FBI', 'guy', 'are', 'dropping', 'visit', 'expect', 'big', 'party', 'father', 'sixtieth', 'Stephen', 'Danny', 'are', 'big', 'time', 'caterers', 'so', ""'ve"", 'told', 'parents', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'Add', 'daughter', 'Mr.', 'Torcelli', 'mob', 'boss', 'marrying', 'non-Italian', 'fiance', 'parents', 'are', 'coming', 'party', 'too', 'thinking', 'Here', 'big', 'hilarious', 'catch', 'unbeknownst', 'fiance', 'parents', 'are', 'leaders', 'anti', 'government', 'faction', 'want', 'use', 'party', 'New', 'York', 'spring', 'board', 'take', 'U.S.Wow', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'got', 'right', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'put', 'movie', '.As', 'said', 'Lauren', 'Gartin', 'are', 'up', 'challenge', 'look', 'good', 'are', 'decent', 'actors', 'Tovuh', 'Feldshuh', 'who', 'fine', 'actress', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'other', 'parts', 'not', 'only', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'true', 'leader', 'anti', 'government', 'group', 'hams', 'up', 'waaaaay', 'what', 'part', 'Meshach', 'Taylor', 'thought', 'doing', 'bizarre', 'accent', 'nationality', 'off', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'Hollywood', 'Mannequin', 'anything', 'else', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'presume', 'part', 'largely', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'good', 'mob', 'boss', 'far', 'too', 'self', 'effacing', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'only', 'characters', 'fleshed', 'out', 'well', 'are', 'lead', 'gay', 'characters', 'interestingly', '2003', 'when', 'gay', 'everywhere', 'man', 'man', 'kissing', 'affection', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'cable', 'even', 'public', 'television', 'two', 'lovers', 'never', 'so', 'much', 'buss', 'other', 'cheek.The', 'whole', 'premise', 'silly', 'belief', 'intended', 'be', 'so', 'However', 'execution', 'never', 'quite', 'should', 'be', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'slapstick', 'intended', 'just', 'feels', 'was', 'done', 'cheap', 'poorly', 'executed', 'Ms.', 'Coury', 'shoots', 'long', 'shots', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'very', 'unflattering', 'angles', 'can', 'not', 'direct', 'action', 'sequence', 'either', 'When', 'lovers', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'fighting', 'attempted', 'hit', 'mob', 'boss', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'could', 'drive', 'Mack', 'truck', 'whole', 'process', 'slow', 'obviously', 'directed', 'not', 'believable', 'all.Basically', 'lot', 'stuff', 'going', 'here', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'script', ""n't"", 'tight', 'enough', 'direction', ""n't"", 'sharp', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'would', 'seem', 'enough', 'material', 'here', 'one', 'half', 'movies', 'too', 'much', 'abilities', 'technical', 'staff', 'film.Fun', 'watch', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'offerings', 'Wolf', 'Video', 'Family', 'Friends', 'look', 'not', 'going', 'break', 'belief', 'just', 'movie', 'gay', ""n't"", 'make', 'good']",N/A

772248,A3OA0PLUJKWEJ3,B0000C23FY,"John Parker Marmaro ""gilfaethwy""","[2, 4]","Perhaps because I wasn't expecting much, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. It is a farce, but it plays with audience preconceptions as much as character relationships. The two lead characters (in what is really a largely ensemble film) are two male lovers-- for all intents and purposes an old married couple-- who work together. Their job? The are strongarm and hitmen for a mafia don. The don loves them as if they were family, and they are equally affectionate and protective of him. Though both are Italian, he bemoans the fact that they are not Sicilian, for if they were he would be tempted to leave them the family ""business"".  He has two sons-- both of whom are straight, married, and fathers-- but neither seems cut out for, or indeed, desirous of taking over the business (one wishes to be a chef and the other a designer). The don also has a beautiful daughter, who is more into, and interested in, the family ""business"" than either of her brothers. She is devoted to our two heroes, as is her father, and indeed all of her family.Trouble in paradise lumbers onto the picture when the parents of one of the hitmen decide to surprise him by visiting. This causes a great deal of consternation-- not because of the gay relationship he is in, which his parents not only know about but seem to enthusiastically accept-- but because he has not told them of his own ""profession""-- and his parents think he and his partner run a catering business.  It is further complicated by the fact that his father is a secret ""deep cover"" FBI (or is it CIA?) agent, which his mother does not know.  Worse yet, the father would be obligated to turn the son and partner in if he knew.  At the same time, the Don's daughter becomes engaged to a young man from the midwest, whose parents, on learning of the engagement, decide to visit NYC-- not primarily to see their son, but to launch ""the second American revolution"" to free the country from the occupying army of the federal government. (Yes, they're looney-tunes).This all could be egregiously formulaic and cutesy... and indeed, I agree with other reviewers in the observation that it seems odd the lead couple never even give each other a peck on the cheek. But the whole thing is handled in an agreeably breezy, appropriately farcical way. For example, Stephen, the hitman whose mother and father are coming to visit, is on them phone with his mother who is bemoaning the violence and danger of New York City, while he and his lover dress, a major element of which is loading and hiding (in their clothing) their various impressive firearms. Much of the humor is handled in this deadpan way. At any rate, these very interesting and oddly matched ingredients are all poured over ice, stirred, and -- voila! Ecce Farce. Not Moliere or Feydeau, but a very amiable and humorous cocktail which should please most palates.  I rarely suggest ""gay"" themed films to my straight friends but this is one I think I will suggest... it might not evoke belly laughs, but there is nothing wrong with some delighted chuckling. Most of all, the film doesn't have delusions of grandeur, as ""verkakte"" as it is... moreover it is pleasantly well-acted by most of the cast. So if you'd like an amusing, very droll and generally very drily humorous little film, you could do a helluva lot worse than this!

772250,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0000C23FY,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[19, 20]","Friends and Family is a delightful and clever comedy. The plot, and many subplots actually, are a bit far-fetched, but they provides pure escapism, which we all need sometimes. The characters, as unbelievable as they are, come out as totally outrageous, much needed in a comedy of this nature. The story becomes so over the top, it borders on ridiculous, but manages to entertain,  while being totally hilarious.I really enjoyed this film and smiled throughout at the pure absurdity of it all. The cast was good, the acting okay, but the characters were terrific in my mind. Yes, some people might consider these people stereotypes, but the stereotype came about for a reason....these people actually EXIST! The only real problem I had, and for a movie like this it's a big one, is the displays of affection between the two leads. I don't need to see full on gay sex, but it would have been nice to have seen the couple at least share a light kiss or two. The end did have them hold hands, with beautiful dialogue expressing their love for each other, and I would have liked to see more of that throughout, just a couple more times at least. It showed a human side to these killers that we just needed to see more of.This is a cross between La Cage Aux Follies (The Birdcage), The Sopranos, and Mambo Italiano, but is too Disneyfied for it's own good. Actually, it's one 'gay film' the whole family can enjoy-- no sex, no profanity, and only very mild violence. I'd definitely rate it a PG.

FUSCO ""yawnmower""","[17, 18]","There are many fun twists of plot and character in this amiable little comedy.A young, handsome, successful, cosmopolitan gay couple live in a chic New York townhouse.  Stephen (played by seductive, stunningly built Greg Lauren) is horrified when his over-the-top force-of-nature mother announces her arrival from Indiana to celebrate his father's 60th birthday.  Stephen and his lover Danny (funny, sweet, sexy, incredibly endearing Christopher Gartin) are still in the closet - not  sexually but professionally.  They have pretended to be caterers but are really enforcers, protectors, and trusted allies of Don Patrizzi, a mafia godfather.The boys need help, and everyone joins in to throw a swanky birthday dinner party for Stephen's father.  Patrizzi's own sons are more interested in cooking and sewing than the family business, so they plan the affair.  The macho mafia `muscle' chip in as high-spirited cater waiters, and adopt very stereotypical gay personae for the evening, with hilarious results.  The plot twists and turns, involving the Don's daughter, her bland midwestern fianc&eacute;, his surprisingly unconventional parents, and a senator.In addition to beautiful Greg Lauren and Christopher Gartin to gaze upon wistfully, the film is remarkably replete with extraordinary New York landmarks and interiors for a small independent film.  Director Kristen Coury has designed her film in a rich, urbane, airy style which harks back to the great technicolor farces of the 50's.Stephen and Danny, refreshingly, are not typical movie/TV gays.  No Will and Grace. No camp.  They are reserved, deferential, and loving.  One yearns, at first, for the couple to be more openly affectionate with each other, but when they finally do touch, at the end of their affable story, it is a moment of pure poetry.",5,"stylish, fun, intelligent, and whimsical",1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,1813,"['are', 'many', 'fun', 'twists', 'plot', 'character', 'amiable', 'little', 'comedy.A', 'young', 'handsome', 'successful', 'cosmopolitan', 'gay', 'couple', 'live', 'chic', 'New', 'York', 'townhouse', 'Stephen', 'played', 'seductive', 'stunningly', 'built', 'Greg', 'Lauren', 'horrified', 'when', 'over-the-top', 'force-of-nature', 'mother', 'arrival', 'Indiana', 'celebrate', 'father', '60th', 'birthday', 'Stephen', 'lover', 'Danny', 'funny', 'sweet', 'sexy', 'incredibly', 'endearing', 'Christopher', 'Gartin', 'are', 'still', 'closet', 'not', 'sexually', 'professionally', 'have', 'pretended', 'be', 'caterers', 'are', 'really', 'enforcers', 'protectors', 'trusted', 'allies', 'Don', 'Patrizzi', 'mafia', 'godfather.The', 'boys', 'need', 'help', 'everyone', 'joins', 'throw', 'swanky', 'birthday', 'dinner', 'party', 'Stephen', 'father', 'Patrizzi', 'own', 'sons', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'cooking', 'sewing', 'family', 'business', 'plan', 'affair', 'macho', 'mafia', 'muscle', 'chip', 'high-spirited', 'cater', 'waiters', 'adopt', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'gay', 'personae', 'evening', 'hilarious', 'results', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'involving', 'Don', 'daughter', 'bland', 'midwestern', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'surprisingly', 'unconventional', 'parents', 'senator.In', 'addition', 'beautiful', 'Greg', 'Lauren', 'Christopher', 'Gartin', 'gaze', 'wistfully', 'film', 'remarkably', 'replete', 'extraordinary', 'New', 'York', 'landmarks', 'interiors', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'Director', 'Kristen', 'Coury', 'designed', 'film', 'rich', 'urbane', 'airy', 'style', 'back', 'great', 'technicolor', 'farces', ""50's.Stephen"", 'Danny', 'refreshingly', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'movie/TV', 'gays', 'Will', 'Grace', 'camp', 'are', 'reserved', 'deferential', 'loving', 'One', 'first', 'couple', 'be', 'more', 'openly', 'affectionate', 'other', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'touch', 'end', 'affable', 'story', 'moment', 'pure', 'poetry']",N/A
772252,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0000C23FY,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 2]","The 2001 comedy ""Friends and Family"" is about a New York City gay couple, Stephen Torcelli (Greg Lauren) and Danny Russo (Christopher Gartin), who have the unusual jobs of working as bodyguards for a mafia godfather named Victor Patrizzi (Tony Lo Bianco).  How they became his bodyguards is because they were both former rangers from the U.S. Army.  Though Danny's parents are never introduced, Stephen's parents, Mr. Torcelli (Frank Pellegrino) and Ada Torcelli (Beth Fowler), decide to pay Stephen a surprise visit.  Of course, this causes a huge dilemna for Stephen: not because he's gay, but because of the jobs that he & Danny have.  Apparently, Stephen had lied to his parents that he and Danny owned a catering business.  Added to this unlikely scenario is that Stephen's father is a retired FBI agent.  Fearing that Stephen's father might turn them in, Stephen and Danny talk with Victor who decides to help them make it appear that his bodyguards are nothing more than simple caterers by throwing a lavish party for Mr. Torcelli.  Victor's daughter Jenny (Rebecca Creskoff) then convinces the other mafia family members appear to help Stephen and Danny at the dinner.  They then decide to try and act gay with the help of their Stephen & Danny's friend Richard Grayson (Edward Hibbert, better known for his work on the 1993-2004 TV show ""Frasier"").  Now, if this plot doesn't seem over the top yet, now let's talk about Jenny's boyfriend Damon Jennings (Brian Lane Green) who unbeknownst to him has two para-military, militia-loving parents, Matt Jennings (Patrick Collins) and Alma Jennings (Tovah Feldshuh), who want nothing more than to find a way to make a huge political statement against the U.S. federal government.  As you might guess, the opulent dinner for Stephen's father is where all of these over the top plot elements come together.""Friends and Family"" is an entertaining film, but some parts are a bit slow and keeping track of the complex array of characters can become bothersome.  Though Stephen and Danny are supposed to be a loving couple, they are never seen kissing or showing any real physical contact.  Clearly, the film's director, Kristen Coury, was more interested in creating an unlikely series of events for a whimsical group of characters to come together.  Though there were some funny scenes in the film (such as Stephen and Danny trying to help cook or Richard trying to teach mafia men to act gay), the over-the-top plot tends to overwhelm more than make people laugh.  Consequently, I rate ""Friends and Family"" with 3 out of 5 stars.  Other notable characters include Frankie Patrizzi (Lou Carbonneau), Vito Patrizzi (Daniel Mastrogiorgio), Eddie (Richard Petrocelli), Bruno (Meshach Taylor) and Stella Patrizzi (Anna Maria Alberghetti).",3,"Entertaining, but a Bit Over the Top",1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,2782,"['2001', 'comedy', 'Friends', 'Family', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'gay', 'couple', 'Stephen', 'Torcelli', 'Greg', 'Lauren', 'Danny', 'Russo', 'Christopher', 'Gartin', 'who', 'have', 'unusual', 'jobs', 'working', 'bodyguards', 'mafia', 'godfather', 'named', 'Victor', 'Patrizzi', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'How', 'became', 'bodyguards', 'were', 'former', 'rangers', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Though', 'Danny', 'parents', 'are', 'never', 'introduced', 'Stephen', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'Torcelli', 'Frank', 'Pellegrino', 'Ada', 'Torcelli', 'Beth', 'Fowler', 'decide', 'pay', 'Stephen', 'surprise', 'visit', 'course', 'huge', 'dilemna', 'Stephen', 'not', 'gay', 'jobs', 'Danny', 'have', 'Apparently', 'Stephen', 'had', 'lied', 'parents', 'Danny', 'owned', 'catering', 'business', 'Added', 'unlikely', 'scenario', 'Stephen', 'father', 'retired', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Fearing', 'Stephen', 'father', 'might', 'turn', 'Stephen', 'Danny', 'talk', 'Victor', 'who', 'help', 'make', 'appear', 'bodyguards', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'simple', 'caterers', 'throwing', 'lavish', 'party', 'Mr.', 'Torcelli', 'Victor', 'daughter', 'Jenny', 'Rebecca', 'Creskoff', 'then', 'other', 'mafia', 'family', 'members', 'appear', 'help', 'Stephen', 'Danny', 'dinner', 'then', 'decide', 'try', 'act', 'gay', 'help', 'Stephen', 'Danny', 'friend', 'Richard', 'Grayson', 'Edward', 'Hibbert', 'better', 'known', 'work', '1993-2004', 'TV', 'show', 'Frasier', 'Now', 'plot', ""n't"", 'seem', 'top', 'yet', 'now', 'let', 'talk', 'Jenny', 'boyfriend', 'Damon', 'Jennings', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'Green', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'two', 'para-military', 'militia-loving', 'parents', 'Matt', 'Jennings', 'Patrick', 'Collins', 'Alma', 'Jennings', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'who', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'huge', 'political', 'statement', 'U.S.', 'federal', 'government', 'might', 'guess', 'opulent', 'dinner', 'Stephen', 'father', 'where', 'top', 'plot', 'elements', 'come', 'together', 'Friends', 'Family', 'entertaining', 'film', 'parts', 'are', 'bit', 'slow', 'keeping', 'track', 'complex', 'array', 'characters', 'can', 'become', 'bothersome', 'Stephen', 'Danny', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'loving', 'couple', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'kissing', 'showing', 'real', 'physical', 'contact', 'Clearly', 'film', 'director', 'Kristen', 'Coury', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'creating', 'unlikely', 'series', 'events', 'whimsical', 'group', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'were', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'such', 'Stephen', 'Danny', 'trying', 'help', 'cook', 'Richard', 'trying', 'teach', 'mafia', 'men', 'act', 'gay', 'over-the-top', 'plot', 'overwhelm', 'more', 'make', 'people', 'Consequently', 'rate', 'Friends', 'Family', '3', '5', 'stars', 'Other', 'notable', 'characters', 'include', 'Frankie', 'Patrizzi', 'Lou', 'Carbonneau', 'Vito', 'Patrizzi', 'Daniel', 'Mastrogiorgio', 'Eddie', 'Richard', 'Petrocelli', 'Bruno', 'Meshach', 'Taylor', 'Stella', 'Patrizzi', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Alberghetti']",N/A
772253,A3QFC8X23IR3QC,B0000C23FY,"Michael C. Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[3, 4]","""Friends and Family"" a film homage to the screwball comedies of the 1930's is a big puffy souffl?.  The opening credits are clever and beautifully photographed. They set up a perfect tone for a sparkling comedy of screwball manners. After the credits fade, something goes wrong and all the air in this concoction slowly escapes like a whoopee cushion being sat upon by a large mobster.The premise of the film is clever and with a talented cast of fine New York actors there are moments in the movie that are indeed funny. But you have to wait for them. This film is not the rollercoaster ride it wants to be, it is the line waiting to get onto it.In possession of one of the truly handsome faces on the screen today, Greg Lauren is coolly menacing as the straight acting Steven Torcelli gay mob hit man with his partner/lover Danny Russo. His comic timing is well placed and contrasts well with the zany characters he is surrounded by. As Steven's boyfriend and fellow killer, Christopher Gartin does well in the bland role of Danny. Yet with most of the comedy chores going to Lauren he becomes not much more than comedic wallpaper.  Tony Lo Bianco is well cast as the Don of the mob family and brings well-timed humor to his role especially in his phone conversation with the Senator. Anna Maria Alberghetti turns the role of wife to the Don into something other than the expected creating a comic black widow eager to have her sons assume the roles of killers for the family.Tovah Feldshuh and Brian Lane Green catapult themselves over the top as midwestern parents of the boy who is to marry into the mob family. They have fun in their roles but somehow their comedy is too strident and clashes with the rest of the ensembles more polished performances.  Beth Fowler gives the best performance in the film and has just the right edge to her character as the mother of Steven. She steals the spotlight every time she appears on screen.The look of the film is marvelous. The cinematography by John Leuba is so rich and atmospheric that it gives ""Friends and Family"" the look of a studio film from the era it means to honor. But a film such as this needs to have much more going for it than just a pretty face, it needs energy.The major problem with ""Friends and Family"" lies in two camps. First there is the screenplay by Joseph Triebwasser. There are a few good scenes, but where it strives to be a light and fast-paced comedy in the manner of Hawks or Capra is fails. It is not much more than a plodding pilot for a WB sitcom. It needs tightening and several more re-writes and a good injection of smart dialog. Smart fast paced dialog is essential for screwball to succeed. The second problem is in the direction and editing. This was Kristen Coury's first time at bat as a director and it is a valiant and ambitious effort. So the problem of pace is not hers alone but must fall partiality in the laps of her editors, Tom Swartwout and Hector Venegas.  A good director and editor can work together to tighten timing and pace where it is needed. That does not happen here. Nowhere is it more evident than in the third act at the banquet. Where the action should be frenetic and zany it grinds on and punctures the comic intent of the scene. It is evident that that the lack of time and money available to the production added to the problems in this scene and we are left with some odd jumps in cutting and loss in some vital connecting information. The whole film is building to this final madcap ending yet we are left sitting on the floor twiddling our fingers while the action stops for all the characters to reflect and yawn.  I agree with the screenwriter, maybe it would have been funnier to have Anna Maria Alberghetti save the day.",2,A BIG PUFFY SOUFFLE,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,3745,"['Friends', 'Family', 'film', 'homage', 'screwball', 'comedies', '1930', 'big', 'puffy', 'souffl', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'clever', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'set', 'up', 'perfect', 'tone', 'sparkling', 'comedy', 'screwball', 'manners', 'credits', 'fade', 'something', 'wrong', 'air', 'concoction', 'slowly', 'whoopee', 'cushion', 'being', 'sat', 'large', 'mobster.The', 'premise', 'film', 'clever', 'talented', 'cast', 'fine', 'New', 'York', 'actors', 'are', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'indeed', 'funny', 'have', 'wait', 'film', 'not', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'be', 'line', 'waiting', 'get', 'it.In', 'possession', 'one', 'truly', 'handsome', 'screen', 'today', 'Greg', 'Lauren', 'coolly', 'menacing', 'straight', 'acting', 'Steven', 'Torcelli', 'gay', 'mob', 'hit', 'man', 'partner/lover', 'Danny', 'Russo', 'comic', 'timing', 'well', 'placed', 'contrasts', 'well', 'zany', 'characters', 'surrounded', 'Steven', 'boyfriend', 'fellow', 'killer', 'Christopher', 'Gartin', 'well', 'bland', 'role', 'Danny', 'most', 'comedy', 'going', 'Lauren', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'comedic', 'wallpaper', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'well', 'cast', 'Don', 'mob', 'family', 'well-timed', 'humor', 'role', 'especially', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Senator', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Alberghetti', 'role', 'wife', 'Don', 'something', 'other', 'expected', 'creating', 'comic', 'black', 'widow', 'eager', 'have', 'sons', 'assume', 'roles', 'killers', 'family.Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'Green', 'catapult', 'top', 'midwestern', 'parents', 'boy', 'who', 'marry', 'mob', 'family', 'have', 'fun', 'roles', 'somehow', 'comedy', 'too', 'strident', 'clashes', 'rest', 'ensembles', 'more', 'polished', 'performances', 'Beth', 'Fowler', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'just', 'right', 'edge', 'character', 'mother', 'Steven', 'spotlight', 'time', 'screen.The', 'look', 'film', 'marvelous', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Leuba', 'so', 'rich', 'atmospheric', 'Friends', 'Family', 'look', 'studio', 'film', 'era', 'honor', 'film', 'such', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'energy.The', 'major', 'problem', 'Friends', 'Family', 'two', 'camps', 'First', 'screenplay', 'Joseph', 'Triebwasser', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'where', 'be', 'light', 'fast-paced', 'comedy', 'manner', 'Hawks', 'Capra', 'fails', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'plodding', 'pilot', 'WB', 'sitcom', 'tightening', 'several', 'more', 're-writes', 'good', 'injection', 'smart', 'dialog', 'Smart', 'fast', 'paced', 'dialog', 'essential', 'screwball', 'succeed', 'second', 'problem', 'direction', 'editing', 'was', 'Kristen', 'Coury', 'first', 'time', 'bat', 'director', 'valiant', 'ambitious', 'effort', 'problem', 'pace', 'not', 'hers', 'alone', 'must', 'fall', 'partiality', 'laps', 'editors', 'Tom', 'Swartwout', 'Hector', 'Venegas', 'A', 'good', 'director', 'editor', 'can', 'work', 'together', 'tighten', 'timing', 'pace', 'where', 'needed', 'not', 'happen', 'here', 'Nowhere', 'more', 'evident', 'third', 'act', 'banquet', 'Where', 'action', 'should', 'be', 'frenetic', 'zany', 'comic', 'intent', 'scene', 'evident', 'lack', 'time', 'money', 'available', 'production', 'added', 'problems', 'scene', 'are', 'left', 'odd', 'jumps', 'cutting', 'loss', 'vital', 'connecting', 'information', 'whole', 'film', 'building', 'final', 'madcap', 'ending', 'yet', 'are', 'left', 'sitting', 'floor', 'twiddling', 'fingers', 'action', 'characters', 'reflect', 'yawn', 'agree', 'screenwriter', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'have', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Alberghetti', 'save', 'day']",N/A

There are a couple of surprisingly poignant and meaningful moments, and you sometimes forget you are watching a wild farce.It's certainly not a tip of the hat to those looking for lots of affection between the two handsome leads.  In fact, this film downplays the gay angle, and everybody in the movie pretty much knows and is comfortable with our two Kens.This leaves lots of room for trouble with the parents.  I couldn't help thinking about Meet the Parents and Mambo Italiano, where the parents are more a force to be reckoned with than any other force on earth.I wasn't planning to watch the whole movie in one night, but stayed up late because I couldn't turn it off.
