1355461,A1LIS4BFMI6C4A,B003NKU9AK,A. Jasper Rains,"[4, 6]","I must admit that I went into this film a bit of a skeptic. The storyline just seemed a little too ""Hallmark Channel"" for me.The movie begins with 8 year old Tyler Doherty, who is suffering from brain cancer and writing letters to God that he leaves for the postman every day. His mother is returning to work as a nurse and life is trying to continue after Tyler has undergone painful radiation treatments.We are also introduced to the postal workers of the area (which area we never know). There is Walter the over achieving veteran postal worker who doesn't feel right taking time off; Lester the kind and gracious boss; Carl, the over eager middle manger and Brady, the slacker Iraq ex-service man who is an alcoholic. In a not so shocking twist of fate, Brady gets assigned Walter's walking route which includes Tyler's home.Tyler eventually is well enough to go back to school. His best friend Sam (Samantha not Samuel), is his protector and confidant. On his first day back a bully is particularly mean to him and Sam proceeds to smash the trouble maker's face in his lunch. The three wind up in the principal's office.Brady continues to drink. He  doesn't know what to do with the letters to God that Tyler continues to write. He decides to take them to a church where the pastor tells him that he doesn't believe that they came into Brady's possession by chance. The pastor prays with him. Brady keeps the letters, unopened. Through collecting the letters Brady becomes a close friend to the family and his drinking stops.The movie continues with more exposition explaining how Tyler's cancer affects the entire neighborhood. Tyler becomes the light of many people's world and he points several characters to a relationship with Christ. The movie takes a deeply emotional turn in its falling action. It concludes by letting us know that the story is based on true events and showing us several cancer survivors that we assume had something to do with the film's production.I will say that this, in similar fashion to the much superior film To Save A Life released earlier this year, has upped the quality expectations for Christian movies. However, To Save A Life captured real, gritty, life and made little apologies for its realism. Letters to God does play as I feared, much like a TV movie. It is a quality TV movie but nonetheless not what you expect when you attend a theater to see a film. It's scope is small and not quite full enough for a large theater venue.The acting is far superior to many films of this genre. Jeffery Johnson does a fine job portraying the troubled Brady who is a complex character driven by his past mistakes with his own family and the uneasy pull to become a part of this new one. He is understated in his subtext. His feelings seem real and his character is one of the best written in the film. We see his hurt and regret and can believe that it is true as he battles his past and its demons.Robyn Lively is not as strong but turns an adequate performance as the struggling mother of a child with cancer. In her most emotional scene, one of the few in the movie that actually rings true to the doubts and grief of struggling with a terminal illness, Lively is a bit over the top and flirts with overacting. She does reign it in just as she brushes over doing the scene and making it unbelievable. You do trust her performance when it comes to the scenes where she shows love and emotion toward her sick son.There is a surprise appearance of Ralph Waite (of The Walton's and more recently the Kevin Costner/Whitney Houston film The Bodyguard) as Sam's grandfather. He is a fine actor but the role was written in such a way that it seems a waste that someone with Waite's pedigree would play the part.You get the sense that Tanner Maguire, who plays Tyler, is trying a bit too hard. Although, the script he has to work with makes believability hard to grasp. Tyler is written in such a way that Mcguire never really has the freedom to delve into the fears and hurts of someone struggling with cancer. He also is a bit too old to be believable as an eight year old. He often has a glossy look that I am not sure is meant to be Tyler's wandering thoughts to Heaven or Maguire's confusion on how to play a child who seems to not struggle much with the fact that he is terminally ill.Bailee Madison is cute on 110 on a 10 point scale, playing the role of the best friend Sam. The director often uses her to make the crowd say ""awww"" and forget that cancer is messy. She is a fine young actress and I will admit that her final scenes and voice overs came the closest to manufacturing genuine emotion from me.Actually the most restrained and believable performance was turned in by Michael Bolten (not the singer) who plays Tyler's older brother, Ben. We can  believe that he cares for his brother and sense his genuine pain at losing first his father (in a ""sudden"" way that is never disclosed) and now the threat of losing his only brother as well. Bolten never seems to overdo his emotions and the writers stay away from the emotionally manipulative tone that haunts other characters in the scripting of Ben. Bolten also demonstrates a quality musical talent in a scene late in the film.The Gospel is very plain in this movie. Those who felt that To Save A Life lacked the over the top salvation message should be amply pleased by it's presentation in Letters to God. Although I thought the restraint shown in To Save A Life was necessary for the tone of that film, I am happy that the filmmakers of Letters To God did not shy away from the road to true peace. We see lives changed by the work of Jesus and His name is credited many times.The movie is worth your time. Perhaps it would be best viewed in your home on a more intimate format than the big screen. It is always pleasant to go to a movie and be entertained and not have to feel like you have somehow compromised your values by watching it. Letters to God will help get us further down the road to consistent quality Christian film making. If we continue to put quality first, we can only expect for movies with a faith message to get better. I do believe that God can (and will) use this film to further His Kingdom and in the end, I know that is what matters most.",3,Misses the Mark Some,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,6266,"['must', 'admit',

Some don't agree you have to forgive others that is so cruel all time. I am telling you now, I used thinking that too. But God's love is growing inside me ,and I may not like the idea of forgiving someone who is so mean to me. They say something unforgettable and unforgiven, yet if you hold grudge. What is really the point of that? It is only eating you up. Just let it go and stop dwelling in past. When I have God's love, wisdom and strengten, it show me it ain't stoppin' there or there. It is keeping growing and growing. So be example in the walking of Jesus by keeping giving love to a person. No matter what they did or who they. That what he does in the movie. Yea, that why the enemy of his is angry and making funny of him. He just mad 'cuz he thought he should be weak as a cancer victim. But with God's love that he keeps giving, he gains the strength.

We can't always see what God's plans are and it seems He is always having to show us that we can trust Him no matter what situation or circumstances comes into our lives. God knows our hearts and He knows what we can handle. Sometimes when we are going through the worst time of our lives is when Christ' light shines through the brightest. Tyler Doherty is an eight year old who's childlike faith is strong and courage indomitable when facing brain cancer. Through his experience he actually mentors those around him including his family and new friend the reluctant postman (he doesn't want a walking route). Tyler's influence changes his life as he is having marital problems and isn't allowed to see his own son. As the movie title suggests Tyler's sends his prayers to God via letters which he hands to the mailman. He doesn't know where they are going but in his childlike trusting heart he knows they are going to the right place. I will stop right here as I don't want to give the whole movie away but I will say if you watch the whole thing you will need a box of tissues handy. Inspirational? You bet!

By the end of this movie, you are definitely going to need it.Tyler Doherty is an 8 year old who is battling cancer. His way of praying is to write letters to God. He has one for the mail carrier almost very day. Brady, a man whose life has fallen apart and who seeks solace in alcohol, is a new mail carrier who takes over the route. On his first day, Tyler pukes on his shoes. Nevertheless, he and Tyler soon become friends. He still isn't sure what to do with all of his letters to God, however. In time, both his friendship with Tyler and his family, and the letters himself will change his life.The idea of writing letters to God takes off and by the end of the movie, many people have joined Tyler in praying in this matter. This movie just may inspire you to write one or more of your own to God.This is truly an amazing, heartbreaking story about faith and trusting in God even when all seems hopeless.

This movie plays like a weak TV movie, with a script that's horribly predictable and acting that sometimes approaches decent.  The direction is simply all over the place--sometimes it seems to be getting serious, only to immediately fall into slapstick silliness.  All of the typical cliches of this genre of film are here, rolled out one after another until you stop expecting any originality at all.  Also, all of the stereotypical characters are present in full force--the down-and-out drunk, the cheerful sick kid, the sassy-but-cute neighbor/best friend, the rebellious teen son, the ""caring"" employer vs. the man who wants the drunk fired--and they definitely add to the predictability.  (And tell me how anyone who misses four of his first twelve days at his post office job and shows up hung over two hours late a day after he missed work isn't going to be fired!  Holes in the plot don't help!)  It was extremely difficult to watch.I do like the idea that people can be shown praying together in a movie.  I like the idea that faith can be shown in a film without apology.  I like seeing people acknowledge their beliefs and try to live up to them, and seeing people treat each other nicely.  I also like a film that doesn't feel a need to fill its time with swearing and/or sex and violence.  But so many other films treat this topic better--this wouldn't be bad to watch at a time when you really don't have anything else to do, but keep your expectations low.
