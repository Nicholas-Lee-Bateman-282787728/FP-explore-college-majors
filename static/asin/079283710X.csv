137880,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,079283710X,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 9]","`Goodbye, Mr. Chips' is a sweet and heartfelt film.  It is designed to make your heart swell and get the tear ducts working, and for the most part it succeeds.  It has a slew of delightful performances (the standout being Greer Garson) as well as a familiar yet always engaging plot.Still, something is missing here.In telling the story about a teacher at a boarding school, this film falls short in an area I find very important; details.  The main focus of the film is of Mr. Chips and his impact on the school where he teaches.  The film opens at the end so-to-speak, with Chips tired and reflecting on his life.  Told in flashbacks, the film takes us back to his first day at the school and the way the boy's behavior caused him to become slightly rigid and lose their favor.  We are then introduced to the beautiful Katherine, who becomes his wife.  We then move his later years where he is nearly forced to retire all the way to the point where he deems it necessary to retire, only to be drawn back in again before, well, `the end'.I know that some are going to have a major issue with what I'm about to say, but it has to be said; this film jumps around by such large margins that it becomes rather hollow.  We lose nearly all of the character development.  To be honest, I have NO idea why Mr. Chips made such an impact on his students.  One minute they hate him, then he has them over for tea and they love him.  There are maybe TWO scenes where he even has any real interaction with his students.  To tell you the truth, I don't even know who Mr. Chips really was.The film tries to tell so much that it winds up telling us very little.I know that this is (obviously) an uncommon opinion, but if you read my reviews then you know that I'm always honest to my own personal viewpoint.  This isn't to say that I didn't `like' this film, because I did; to an extent.  The performances were delightful (I even found Terry Kilburn's multi-faceted performance to be a great `child' performance considering the time, although I will say that the film didn't flesh out his relationship with Chips nearly enough) and the films overall appeal is that of `charm', but it lacks the depth it was trying to establish.Greer Garson (who really should have been in the supporting category at that year's Oscars) is a stunning force in this film.  She reminded me of Kate Winslet, which is always a good thing.  She understood her characters subtle sensuality, and that cheeky independence that is so becoming.  Her first scene alone is the films biggest highlight.  In fact, her character is probably the most fleshed out of them all, and it's all in the way she handles her character's scenes (for she doesn't have very many).In the end, I certainly recommend this film.  It is delightful and sweet and will probably bring a tear to your eyes.  I just expected more (and I don't think what I expected was too much to deliver).",3,"Tries to do so much, but...",1277251200,"06 23, 2010",2010,2919,"['Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'sweet', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'designed', 'make', 'heart', 'swell', 'get', 'tear', 'ducts', 'working', 'most', 'part', 'slew', 'delightful', 'performances', 'standout', 'being', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'as', 'well', 'familiar', 'yet', 'always', 'engaging', 'plot.Still', 'something', 'missing', 'here.In', 'telling', 'story', 'teacher', 'boarding', 'school', 'film', 'short', 'area', 'find', 'very', 'important', 'details', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'impact', 'school', 'where', 'film', 'end', 'so-to-speak', 'Chips', 'tired', 'reflecting', 'life', 'Told', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'back', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'way', 'boy', 'behavior', 'caused', 'become', 'slightly', 'rigid', 'lose', 'favor', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'beautiful', 'Katherine', 'who', 'wife', 'then', 'move', 'later', 'years', 'where', 'nearly', 'forced', 'retire', 'way', 'point', 'where', 'necessary', 'retire', 'only', 'be', 'drawn', 'back', 'again', 'well', ""end'.I"", 'know', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'major', 'issue', 'what', ""'m"", 'say', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'around', 'such', 'large', 'margins', 'rather', 'hollow', 'lose', 'nearly', 'character', 'development', 'be', 'honest', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'made', 'such', 'impact', 'students', 'One', 'minute', 'hate', 'then', 'over', 'tea', 'love', 'are', 'maybe', 'TWO', 'scenes', 'where', 'even', 'real', 'interaction', 'students', 'tell', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'really', 'film', 'tries', 'tell', 'so', 'much', 'up', 'telling', 'very', 'little.I', 'know', 'obviously', 'uncommon', 'opinion', 'read', 'reviews', 'then', 'know', ""'m"", 'always', 'honest', 'own', 'personal', 'viewpoint', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'did', 'extent', 'performances', 'were', 'delightful', 'even', 'found', 'Terry', 'Kilburn', 'multi-faceted', 'performance', 'be', 'great', 'child', 'performance', 'considering', 'time', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'flesh', 'out', 'relationship', 'Chips', 'nearly', 'enough', 'films', 'overall', 'appeal', 'charm', 'depth', 'was', 'trying', 'establish.Greer', 'Garson', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'supporting', 'category', 'year', 'Oscars', 'stunning', 'force', 'film', 'reminded', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'understood', 'characters', 'subtle', 'sensuality', 'cheeky', 'independence', 'so', 'becoming', 'first', 'scene', 'alone', 'films', 'biggest', 'highlight', 'fact', 'character', 'probably', 'most', 'fleshed', 'way', 'character', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'many', '.In', 'end', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'film', 'delightful', 'sweet', 'will', 'probably', 'bring', 'tear', 'eyes', 'just', 'expected', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'deliver']",N/A

137890,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,079283710X,C. Middleton,"[3, 5]","Although some would disagree, Sam Wood's 1939 version of the novella by James Hilton (1934) stands out firm as one of the best adaptations of this sentimental story of a shy but dedicated teacher.Director Sam Wood was known more for his later films, Our Town, staring a young and handsome, William Holden and a beautiful, Martha Scott. Another sentimental favourite from that prolific period for filmmaking in Hollywood: For Whom the Bell Tolls, staring Gary Cooper and the stunning Ingrid Bergman. Sam Wood's career grew as he became more adept at his trade; however, ""Chip"" is a wonderful rendition of the popular novella, and in fact, the first film adaptation in a long line of films.Robert Donat plays the leading role with great skill and charm as we see him recall his sixty-five year career as a teacher at a traditional English school for boys, in a series of flashbacks spanning over an entire lifetime. Donat captured the old teacher's humour and charm, his dedication and ultimately, his sensitive caring attention to all his students. The aging process, which the character must go through, is done with surprising realism, as old Chip actually appeared his 84 years.Greer Garson is absolutely gorgeous, as she meets Chip on a mountaintop in the Swiss Alps while on holiday, although seeming to old Chip that she is way out of his league, this beautiful woman falls head over heels for the teacher and marries him, joining him at the school. Of course she charms the faculty and the students, showing old Chip a more human side to his students. The famous scene where she dies giving birth to their first child, and old Chip, typically English, that traditional stiff upper lip, decides to take his class despite the fact that his wife and new born child have just died. Not knowing this terrible tragedy, the boy's play an April fools joke on their old teacher, and soon later, the students discover what has actually happened, which would cause tears to fall for even the hardest of hearts. The expressions the boy's have on there faces, reveals a sadness and compassion for their old teacher that is very touching. And despite the obvious sentimentality, for the story, this sadness, to my mind, is entirely appropriate.This is a wonderful tale, a testimony to the profession of teaching, a sentimental journey of a simple man's life who influenced generation after generation of young men, showing them what it means to be human.This DVD would be an excellent addition to anyone's library.",5,The First and the Best,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2506,"['would', 'disagree', 'Sam', 'Wood', '1939', 'version', 'novella', 'James', 'Hilton', '1934', 'out', 'firm', 'one', 'best', 'adaptations', 'sentimental', 'story', 'shy', 'dedicated', 'teacher.Director', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'was', 'known', 'more', 'later', 'films', 'Town', 'staring', 'young', 'handsome', 'William', 'Holden', 'beautiful', 'Martha', 'Scott', 'sentimental', 'favourite', 'prolific', 'period', 'filmmaking', 'Hollywood', 'Whom', 'Bell', 'Tolls', 'staring', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'stunning', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'career', 'grew', 'became', 'more', 'adept', 'trade', 'however', 'Chip', 'wonderful', 'rendition', 'popular', 'novella', 'fact', 'first', 'film', 'adaptation', 'long', 'line', 'films.Robert', 'Donat', 'leading', 'role', 'great', 'skill', 'charm', 'see', 'recall', 'sixty-five', 'year', 'career', 'teacher', 'traditional', 'English', 'school', 'boys', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'spanning', 'entire', 'lifetime', 'Donat', 'captured', 'old', 'teacher', 'humour', 'charm', 'dedication', 'ultimately', 'sensitive', 'caring', 'attention', 'students', 'aging', 'process', 'character', 'must', 'go', 'done', 'surprising', 'realism', 'old', 'Chip', 'actually', 'appeared', '84', 'years.Greer', 'Garson', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Chip', 'mountaintop', 'Swiss', 'Alps', 'holiday', 'seeming', 'old', 'Chip', 'way', 'league', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'head', 'heels', 'teacher', 'marries', 'joining', 'school', 'course', 'faculty', 'students', 'showing', 'old', 'Chip', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'students', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'giving', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'old', 'Chip', 'typically', 'English', 'traditional', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'take', 'class', 'fact', 'wife', 'new', 'born', 'child', 'have', 'just', 'died', 'Not', 'knowing', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'boy', 'play', 'April', 'fools', 'joke', 'old', 'teacher', 'soon', 'later', 'students', 'discover', 'actually', 'happened', 'would', 'cause', 'tears', 'fall', 'even', 'hardest', 'hearts', 'expressions', 'boy', 'have', 'sadness', 'compassion', 'old', 'teacher', 'very', 'touching', 'obvious', 'sentimentality', 'story', 'sadness', 'mind', 'entirely', 'appropriate.This', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'testimony', 'profession', 'teaching', 'sentimental', 'journey', 'simple', 'man', 'life', 'who', 'influenced', 'generation', 'generation', 'young', 'men', 'showing', 'what', 'be', 'human.This', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'addition', 'anyone', 'library']",N/A

However, as directed by the prolific veteran Sam Wood, this heartwarming film endures because the time-spanning story - adapted by R.C. Sherriff, Claudine West and Eric Maschwitz - celebrates the power of the dedicated teacher in small-scale, defining episodes over the course of sixty-three years. Known affectionately as ""Chips"", Charles Edward Chipping is a master in Latin at Brookfield, a prestigious boys' boarding school. He arrives in his early twenties in 1870 and remains there until 1933, all the while maintaining his gentle but firm-handed character and fundamentally shy demeanor. Through his perseverance and genial humor, he earns the respect of generations of students who pass through the hallowed halls.The story is told in flashback as the aged Chips looks back on his career. His initial days are a trial by fire with the rambunctious boys, but he soon becomes an established member of the faculty. When he moves implacably into middle age, Chips realizes how lonely he is, and his good friend, German master Max Staefel takes him to Austria to hike the Alps. In a most fanciful segment about forty minutes into the movie, he is traipsing through the treacherous terrain much like Robert Conway did in another classic Hilton adaptation, Frank Capra'sLost Horizon. On a misty mountaintop, Chips meets the headstrong Katherine Ellis, a young English suffragette, and love blooms. She injects the necessary joie de vivre into his mundane existence, and they marry most contently. She dies upon childbirth, and Chips returns with renewed spirit to teaching. He goes on despite efforts to put him out to pasture and leads a most fulfilling life.Given that the film is essentially a character piece that needs to keep us in rapt attention despite its seemingly modest scope, Robert Donat delivers one of cinema's most memorable portrayals. Indeed, his performance managed to take the Oscar away from the likes of Clark Gable (Gone with the Wind), Laurence Oliver (Wuthering Heights) and James Stewart (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) in that magic year when the Hollywood studios peaked. In her American film debut and at the beginning of her reign as MGM's class-conscious leading lady, Greer Garson makes an indelible impression as the spirited Katherine, though her character barely lasts a half-hour and leaves with little trace. A few years before his defining work at Warner Brothers inNow, VoyagerandCasablanca, Paul Henreid is a feisty, likeable presence as Staefel. MGM production values are pretty standard here with the Alpine sections a bit too artificial even by studio standards. The 2004 DVD offers a decent print but no extras.",5,Robert Donat's Memorable Portrait Showcases Teaching as The Noblest Profession,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,2861,"['Based', 'James', 'Hilton', '1934novella', '1939', 'MGM', 'chestnut', 'such', 'product', 'time', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'pre-WWII', 'morale-boosting', 'sentimentality', 'stiff-upper-lip', 'British', 'protagonist', 'However', 'directed', 'prolific', 'veteran', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'endures', 'time-spanning', 'story', 'adapted', 'R.C', 'Sherriff', 'Claudine', 'West', 'Eric', 'Maschwitz', 'power', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'small-scale', 'defining', 'episodes', 'course', 'sixty-three', 'years', 'Known', 'affectionately', 'Chips', 'Charles', 'Edward', 'Chipping', 'master', 'Latin', 'Brookfield', 'prestigious', 'boys', 'boarding', 'school', 'early', 'twenties', '1870', 'there', '1933', 'while', 'maintaining', 'gentle', 'firm-handed', 'character', 'fundamentally', 'shy', 'demeanor', 'perseverance', 'genial', 'humor', 'respect', 'generations', 'students', 'who', 'pass', 'hallowed', 'halls.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'aged', 'Chips', 'back', 'career', 'initial', 'days', 'are', 'trial', 'fire', 'rambunctious', 'boys', 'soon', 'established', 'member', 'faculty', 'When', 'implacably', 'middle', 'age', 'Chips', 'how', 'lonely', 'good', 'friend', 'German', 'master', 'Max', 'Staefel', 'Austria', 'hike', 'Alps', 'most', 'fanciful', 'segment', 'forty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'traipsing', 'treacherous', 'terrain', 'much', 'Robert', 'Conway', 'did', 'classic', 'Hilton', 'adaptation', 'Frank', ""Capra'sLost"", 'Horizon', 'misty', 'mountaintop', 'Chips', 'headstrong', 'Katherine', 'Ellis', 'young', 'English', 'suffragette', 'love', 'blooms', 'necessary', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'mundane', 'existence', 'marry', 'most', 'contently', 'childbirth', 'Chips', 'returns', 'renewed', 'spirit', 'teaching', 'efforts', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', 'most', 'fulfilling', 'life.Given', 'film', 'essentially', 'character', 'piece', 'keep', 'rapt', 'attention', 'seemingly', 'modest', 'scope', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'one', 'cinema', 'most', 'memorable', 'portrayals', 'Indeed', 'performance', 'managed', 'take', 'Oscar', 'away', 'likes', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Laurence', 'Oliver', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'magic', 'year', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'peaked', 'American', 'film', 'debut', 'beginning', 'reign', 'MGM', 'class-conscious', 'leading', 'lady', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'indelible', 'impression', 'spirited', 'Katherine', 'character', 'barely', 'half-hour', 'little', 'trace', 'few', 'years', 'defining', 'work', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'inNow', 'VoyagerandCasablanca', 'Paul', 'Henreid', 'feisty', 'likeable', 'presence', 'Staefel', 'MGM', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'pretty', 'standard', 'here', 'Alpine', 'sections', 'bit', 'too', 'artificial', 'even', 'studio', 'standards', '2004', 'DVD', 'decent', 'print', 'extras']",N/A

The film, made in 1939, is a tribute to the English public school system. This is the story of the life of a school teacher, Mr Chipping (exceptionally well played by Robert Donat).Chipping starts off as a well meaning, shy and nervous teacher. Along the way, he meets the lovely Kathy (Green Garson) whom he falls in love with at first sight. They marry and his assertive wife resurrects his love and great appreciation of teaching and his students. After the marriage, Chipping (affectionately named Chips by his wife) is viewed in a new light by students and colleagues. Mr Chips is trusted and admired by pupils due to his empathy and dry sense of humour. He eventually wins the appointment of Housemaster.Tragically, Chips loses his wife during childbirth. However, he spends the remainder of his life as a well respected and devoted teacher who is a champion of learning.

137900,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,079283710X,Gavin Wilson,"[79, 85]","This is a wonderfully sentimental depiction of public school life in the Victorian and Edwardian eras and beyond.  Chipping, like so many other schoolmasters of the time, lives a cloistered life on which the outer world only occasionally impinges -- mostly during wartime.In the film, he ventures out on only one other memorable occasion -- a holiday with the school German teacher to the Tyrol where he meets the handsome Greer Garson (in her first movie appearance), who somewhat improbably falls for him.  This sets off a chain of sentimental events: marriage, introductions to the common room, tea with the boys, her death through childbirth, and a never-ending cycle of Colleys (played by the same actor, but with a slightly different haircut for each generation).  The school hymn is also designed to pluck the heart stings.The movie was actually filmed at Repton.  I went to a similarly confined, all-boys, English public school, set in a country town miles from anywhere else, though somewhat more recently than the Chips era.  Many of the masters never married because it was so difficult for them to meet any women.  We still had corporal punishment -- which Chips continues to inflict even when brought out of retirement to become head during World War One.  This film does not reflect the grubby reality of public school life -- the author must have had his rose-tinted spectacles on when he wrote this -- but it's hard not to be moved by it.I have special memories of first seeing this at the age of 12 in our headmaster's study, together with all the other senior boys at the prep school.  Today, its meaning for me is more about staying in the same place for a long time, while all about you moves on.  (I've recently completed 25 years with the same employer!)  I also enjoyed trying to work out how many of the Tyrol scenes were shot in the studio.  (At one stage, Chips and his friend even walk against a film background.)The DVD has no special extras, but the picture and sound quality is reasonable.  I haven't tried the film on my teenage children, but I think this is one of the few black and white movies that they would be absorbed by.

Mr. Chipping may not be the most exciting or charismatic teacher, but he earns the respect and admiration of those around him.  Greer Garson gives a warm, appealing performance as the lady who steals Donat's heart, showing him how to enjoy life and to open up.  All of their scenes together are terrific, although my favourite scene is of Donat trying to teach during an air raid.  Having read the book as well, I can say this film captures the story well and extends it, and this movie is in a different league then the ill-conceived musical version of the sixties.

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS!This film turned in 1939 tells the story of life of Mr Chippings, who took a post of teacher at Brookfield Public School in 1870, worked there until his permanent retirement in 1918 and still lives near the school in 1933, at the ripe age of 83, willingly advising students and teachers. For the young boys, who are always welcome to come visit him for some tea and biscuits, he is a kind of legend (""Chips has been here for hundreds and hundreds of years"") as for many of them he taught also their fathers, grandfathers - and in at least one case he meets the grandgrandson of one of his first pupils! We hear the story of his life through his memories - and this is a wonderful tale (albeit sometimes also very sad).The beauty of this film is resides in its warmth and humour and a kind of INNOCENCE, which is no more really pictured in films made in our times... Robert Donat, a British actor mostly forgotten today, plays Mr Chippings and he got very desservedly an Oscar for his performance! Greer Garson, a British actress also little known today, plays a secondary but still very important role of Katherine, a woman Mr Chips meets in the middle of his life in quite unique circumstances...Lyn Harding, an actor alreay quite aged in 1939 (he was 72), whose formidable appearance made him possibly the best Professor Moriarty ever, makes a short but unforgettable appearance as the Headmaster of Brookfield, Dr Wetherby - and I am almost certain that in Harry Potter's series the character of Dumbledore was at least partially inspired by him... In fact, some scenes in this film seemed to me also to have been inspirations for Hogwarts school...I must confess that towards the end I cried. A LOT! And I am really not a teenage girl... Also, be prepared that some scenes describing the years 1914-1918 will break your heart.One more reflection (digression) here, before concluding. What an incredible year for the cinema was 1939: ""Gone with the wind"", ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"", ""Stagecoach"", ""Ninotchka"", ""Wuthering heights"", ""Gunga Din"", ""Beau geste"", ""The women"", ""Drums along the Mohawk"", ""Stanley and Livingstone"", ""Good bye Mr Chips"", ""The little princess"", ""Young Mr Lincoln"", etc. It seems almost as if God inspired filmmakers to make a special effort for the last year of peace, before the greatest tragedy in human history...To conclude, this is one of the best films I ever watched, a great treasure of world cinema and a uniquely moving and magical film.

The young Mr. Chipping is a new instructor at an elite English public (boarding) school.  Through a serious of missteps his debut as a new master is near disastrous.  As a result he becomes a cold exacting master just so he can function as an instructor.While he performs competently in the classroom, he is considered a social cripple.  The students are either indifferent or hate him.  The other faculty and administration consider him extremely competent professionally but socially maladjusted.  Not knowing any other way to function he continues in this manner for years.  This culminates in his being passed over for a critical promotion.This is a crippling blow to a middle-aged man with aspirations for headmaster.  However, another faculty member instinctively realizes that this is a good man in need of a friend.  He drags the reluctant Mr. Chipping on a bicycle tour of Europe.  This trip changes his life forever.Mr. Chipping meets a woman (played by Greer Garson in her film debut) who becomes the great love of his life.  That's what this movie is about, love and how it transforms our lives.  Mr. Chipping becomes Mr. Chips beloved by students, faculty and administration.  This woman teaches him to love and communicate with other people, especially the students.This film was made in 1939, considered by some the greatest year in the history of motion pictures.  ""Gone with the Wind"" and `The Wizard of Oz"" both came out this year.  Against some stiff competition, Mr. Donat won the `Best Actor' Oscar.  This isn't too surprising though.  Mr. Chips ages from his early twenties until his eighties.  While Robert Donat did not act much (poor health) his every performance was extraordinary.

It starts 58 years after his arrival and the current Headmaster was a student of Chipping 37 years ago.  It is the first day of school and Chips is determined not to miss assembly.At afternoon tea (actually 4 pm) he falls asleep and starts to dream of his arrival 58 years ago.  Chipping is a mild manner man and the boys takes advantage of that.  Chipping's career has been unspectacular.  While he is liked, he is not well liked.Chipping goes on holiday (that's British for vacation) with the German Master to Germany.  While hiking, he ""rescues"" a woman, Katherine Ellis, he thought was in distress.  The next day they part.  But Chips keeps hoping they will meet again.  In Vienna they meet up again.  As Kathy's train is leaving, Chips gets the nerve to ask her to marry him.Back at the school, everyone instantly falls for Kathy.  (Well, who wouldn't fall in love with Greer Garson?)  Kathy turns her charms to the boys, make her the most popular person at the school.With Kathy by his side, Chipping's career begins to flourish.  Things are going great, a baby Chipping is coming.  Unfortunately, both Kathy and the baby die in child birth.Time passes by and so does the school.  The Head demands that Chipping retires and the school rallies round Chipping.  Eventually Chipping does retire.  But then WWI breaks out and he is pressed into service, as Headmaster.  The war ends and he returns to retirement.Robert Donat won the Oscar beating heavyweight competition that year (Gable, Olivier, Rooney and Stewart).  Garson was only on the screen for 30 minutes but she nabbed a Best Actress nomination (losing to Vivien Leigh).  Garson would win three years later for Mrs. Miniver.Technically, this is a great film.  The art direction is beautiful, and considering the budget, it was spectacular.

Well-directed and just superbly acted by Robert Donat in the title role, this film is an endearing classic.The basic story is that of a traditional English schoolmaster, set in a period from mid-Victorian to pre-WWII.  It's a gentle tale of the meaning of a man's life and how we can rise to excellence in our modest professions and touch the lives of many.  Mr. Chipping (""Chips"" as his students affectionately know him) leads a rich life, although also fraught with sorrows.There is still much relevance to the film--the tragedy of war, the importance of a balanced education, and the evils of caste.Yes, the film is sentimental and a little manipulative, but you will probably not mind.  In fact, you may cry your eyes out.Compared to R.F.

The tribute to the English public school system and to one Mr. Chipping is done with immaculate care in every respect; it is a serene, tenderly heart-warming story.  Like the story, the film is nostalgic: if we never knew a Mr. Chips, we should have - he belongs in every young man's past. Robert Donat gives an incredibly fine charactisation of the much-loved schoolmaster.  Donat's performance is noteworthy not merely for his uncanny ability to make a convincing transition from young schoolmaster to octogenarian, but for his subtle underlining (if underlining can be subtle) of the dramatic moments in an essentially undramatic life.  Chips was a shy person; like an iceberg, two-thirds of him was always subsurface.  Donat wisely understated him playing him softly which doubled his poignance.  It is only when he is seen as a crotchety old man scattering across campus in his tattered robe - that Donat went a TRIFLE overdrawn: a fraction of the cute and overacted side.  But that is just and impression  and not deep enough to discredit an otherwise flawless performance.  Greer Garson's portrait of Katherine, the assertive young woman who changed the dour Mr. Chipping into the loveable Mr. Chips is altogether believable and quite entrancing: here is one of the nicest people we could ever wish to encounter!

137931,A27FYYS44LH7KD,079283710X,Thucydides 1,"[8, 13]","I'd been vaguely aware of this movie and its reputation as a revered classic all my life, but until two nights ago, when I selected it from the ""free"" movies list on Comcast cable, I'd never seen it.  In my naivete I didn't even know that Robert Donat was in the starring role, and, being equally honest, didn't have a very clear idea of exactly who he was anyway.It's hard to say this, but, very truthfully, I thought that both this story and Robert Donat in particular were a bit out of their depth when compared to the other recognised movie titans of the period. That said, I feel that many similar movies and the actors in them were products of a dominant ""zeitgeist"" of the 1930's that often included simplistic, stereotypical representations of subject material and formulaeic plot development and acting styles. This moviemaking period was often characterised by sudden introductions, hasty plot developments, and unrealistically quick resolutions. Much relied on the assumption that the audience would be willing to supplant disbelief with a protracted set of assumptions even more readily than willingness to suspend it.These 1930's-esque ""norms"" are especially binding on this movie, based as it already is on the strait-laced, ultra-ritualised realm of an English upper-class boys' preparatory school. Because so many of both the setting, and behavioral parameters of the actors are ""cast in stone"" by the background of the situation in which they occur, there is little ability to develop any interesting spontaneity, and that's most likely what we who are reviewing this movie in the early 21st Century mean when we say that it's quite predictable, and ""schmaltsy"". It is.Actually, the only really surprising moments in the movie come when Mr Chipping takes a whirlwind vacation with one of his fellow instructors to the Alps, where he meets his future wife in a series of peculiarly contrived scenes that return quickly to the ""settled order"" of the movie, and so the spark of the unexpected is quickly extinguished.  If this sounds like rubbish, consider the death of the wife in childbirth. If you are in the least perceptive, you know that his wife will die in childbirth within seconds of the appearance of the family doctor. There's less than two minutes of ""run-up"" to this stunning, heart-breaking event. She's declared in trouble and then dies, all within no more than four minutes. The climax of this tragic turn of events is rushed out so quickly that there isn't even a farewell scene between the man and his beloved wife.Perhaps you see that my disappointment is not so much with this one movie as it is with an entire method of movie-making.  ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" is not, repeat, not a bad movie, but in my opinion it certainly is not a great movie, especially when compared with ground-breaking contemporary films of its era like, ""Gone With The Wind"", ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Gunga Din"", ""Grapes of Wrath"", ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"", ""Citizen Kane"", etc.Now that I've conveyed the impression of being an unsentimental snot, I'll tell you that, in spite of myself, I had tears in my eyes during some of the scenes. I loved the atmosphere of the background setting of the old English boys' school and was reminded of ""The Priory School"" (one of the superb episodes of ""The Return of Sherlock Holmes"", starring the late Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke). Quite a number of the scenes showing developments in the boys' lives were quite moving, especially as they were being dragooned off to their deaths in one war after another....So, by all means, see the movie and I hope you enjoy it. I hope to see it again myself. I also hope I've helped to clarify some things for you so that you won't have disappointment in your expectations.",3,"Had the wrong expectation, but enjoyed it anyway",1192147200,"10 12, 2007",2007,3759,"[""'d"", 'been', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'movie', 'reputation', 'revered', 'classic', 'life', 'two', 'nights', 'ago', 'when', 'selected', 'free', 'movies', 'list', 'Comcast', 'cable', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'naivete', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'was', 'starring', 'role', 'being', 'equally', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'clear', 'idea', 'exactly', 'who', 'was', 'anyway.It', 'hard', 'say', 'very', 'truthfully', 'thought', 'story', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'particular', 'were', 'bit', 'depth', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'recognised', 'movie', 'titans', 'period', 'said', 'feel', 'many', 'similar', 'movies', 'actors', 'were', 'products', 'dominant', 'zeitgeist', '1930', 'often', 'included', 'simplistic', 'stereotypical', 'representations', 'subject', 'material', 'formulaeic', 'plot', 'development', 'acting', 'styles', 'moviemaking', 'period', 'was', 'often', 'characterised', 'sudden', 'introductions', 'hasty', 'plot', 'developments', 'unrealistically', 'quick', 'resolutions', 'Much', 'relied', 'assumption', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'supplant', 'disbelief', 'protracted', 'set', 'assumptions', 'even', 'more', 'readily', 'willingness', 'suspend', 'it.These', ""1930's-esque"", 'norms', 'are', 'especially', 'binding', 'movie', 'based', 'already', 'strait-laced', 'ultra-ritualised', 'realm', 'English', 'upper-class', 'boys', 'preparatory', 'school', 'so', 'many', 'setting', 'behavioral', 'parameters', 'actors', 'are', 'cast', 'stone', 'background', 'situation', 'occur', 'little', 'ability', 'develop', 'interesting', 'spontaneity', 'most', 'likely', 'what', 'who', 'are', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'early', '21st', 'Century', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'quite', 'predictable', 'schmaltsy', 'is.Actually', 'only', 'really', 'surprising', 'moments', 'movie', 'come', 'when', 'Mr', 'Chipping', 'whirlwind', 'vacation', 'one', 'fellow', 'instructors', 'Alps', 'where', 'future', 'wife', 'series', 'peculiarly', 'contrived', 'scenes', 'return', 'quickly', 'settled', 'order', 'movie', 'so', 'spark', 'unexpected', 'quickly', 'extinguished', 'rubbish', 'consider', 'death', 'wife', 'childbirth', 'are', 'least', 'perceptive', 'know', 'wife', 'will', 'die', 'childbirth', 'seconds', 'appearance', 'family', 'doctor', 'less', 'two', 'minutes', 'run-up', 'stunning', 'heart-breaking', 'event', 'declared', 'trouble', 'then', 'dies', 'more', 'four', 'minutes', 'climax', 'tragic', 'turn', 'events', 'rushed', 'out', 'so', 'quickly', ""n't"", 'even', 'farewell', 'scene', 'man', 'beloved', 'wife.Perhaps', 'see', 'disappointment', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'movie', 'entire', 'method', 'movie-making', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'not', 'repeat', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'opinion', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'ground-breaking', 'contemporary', 'films', 'era', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Gunga', 'Din', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'etc.Now', ""'ve"", 'conveyed', 'impression', 'being', 'unsentimental', 'snot', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'spite', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'scenes', 'loved', 'atmosphere', 'background', 'setting', 'old', 'English', 'boys', 'school', 'was', 'reminded', 'Priory', 'School', 'one', 'superb', 'episodes', 'Return', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'starring', 'late', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'Edward', 'Hardwicke', 'number', 'scenes', 'showing', 'developments', 'boys', 'lives', 'were', 'quite', 'moving', 'especially', 'were', 'being', 'dragooned', 'deaths', 'one', 'war', '.So', 'means', 'see', 'movie', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'hope', 'see', 'again', 'also', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'clarify', 'things', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'disappointment', 'expectations']",N/A

Murphy's law rules the day - anything that can go wrong for Mr Chipping does go wrong. He begins his teaching career as an incredibly shy and nervous young man, and threatens to wind up a lonely bachelor until the beautiful Greer Garson bumps into him atop a Swiss mountain and it is love at first sight for the unlikely pairing. Things turn sour, however, as they seem to at almost every turn in poor Chips' life. However, when all else is said and done, Chips can look with a sense of pride and achievement upon his teaching career, spanning over sixty something years, during which time he has touched myriads of young boy's lives with his cheery character and wisdom.So, Chip's deathbed speech really puts everything into perspective - this is a somewhat melancholy film with only short-lived moments of 'feel-good' until the very end when the value and purpose of Chip's life all makes sense and we see that, despite all his misfortune, he had accomplished much in a pre-George Bailey sort of way.
