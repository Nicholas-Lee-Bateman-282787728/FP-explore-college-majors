The colors are really vibrant and the bears and sweet and cute making it a hit.

1015350,A3CDR7VEX55JAD,B000HOJR6C,"Red Wood ""critic""","[0, 0]","My wife grew up with both the Care Bears and the Gummi Bears. She could watch these things around the clock for hours on end. With that said, I did not. I came from an early period, when Christmas presentations were still the old films ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"", as well as the TV greats ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Frosty the Snowman"", by Rankin/Bass. If she were to review this, it would be through the ceiling with love and memories, so I thought I would, instead, review it, since I'd purchased it for her and the fact that I am not biased in the least (meaning I am not a fan, yet I do not have any reason to despise the bears). The movie seems a bit plodding and has really nothing whatsoever to do with The Nutcracker. However, if you love the Care Bears, you may enjoy this one, too.",2,"Need to Be a Fan, For Certain",1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,828,"['wife', 'grew', 'up', 'Care', 'Bears', 'Gummi', 'Bears', 'could', 'watch', 'things', 'clock', 'hours', 'end', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'came', 'early', 'period', 'when', 'Christmas', 'presentations', 'were', 'still', 'old', 'films', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'as', 'well', 'TV', 'greats', 'Rudolph', 'Red-Nosed', 'Reindeer', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'Rankin/Bass', 'were', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'ceiling', 'love', 'memories', 'thought', 'would', 'instead', 'review', ""'d"", 'purchased', 'fact', 'am', 'not', 'biased', 'least', 'meaning', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'yet', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'reason', 'despise', 'bears', 'movie', 'bit', 'plodding', 'really', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'Nutcracker', 'However', 'love', 'Care', 'Bears', 'may', 'enjoy', 'one', 'too']",Care Bears: Nutcracker

She really enjoyed it and now my 4 yr old cousin insists on watching it every day, if not more. This is a cute, fun Care Bear version of the Nutcracker that both little boys and girls will love, and parents can tolerate.
