198033,ABNPNMB2U63O0,6300180204,B Leuri,"[1, 3]","I bought this movie for several reasons, amongst them I like the period and enjoy Tom Hanks in particular.It's set in World War 2, the Holy Land, and Hanks is an RAF fighter pilot recovering from being shot down.So much for the backdrop.The scenes are superb, the props excellent and the acting get 5* from almost all involved.The viewer is wrapped into the world of the middle east in an entirely beleivable way.The love story that becomes the focal point blossoms, it's accurate and portrays we've all felt after the first few meetings.The plot then delves into the aspects of prejudice within and external to families, of clannish beliefs, of anti-semitism and shows the prejudice there works both ways. As the saying goes, ""as you give, so shall you recieve"". It highlights the attempts of four young people of their time in trying to change this world of bigorty and small mindedness. It highlights in this case that it is often the women who are most vitriolic, especially against their own. I found myself wishing that such people could really have their actions filmed then be forced to watch themselves.The conclusion to the movie was unusual, it left me feeling like only ""Fellowship of the Ring"" had before - so what's next? There's no definitive conclusion for me [others may view it differently], and there was so much more that could have been added to enhance the storyline. This alone cost it 2 stars.I'm not disappointed I bought it, and will watch it more than once, but suspect I'll continue to be left with the unfilled anticipation I felt when watching the credits the first time.",3,Stunning acting but no ending?,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,1601,"['bought', 'movie', 'several', 'reasons', 'like', 'period', 'enjoy', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'particular.It', 'set', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Holy', 'Land', 'Hanks', 'RAF', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'recovering', 'being', 'shot', 'down.So', 'much', 'backdrop.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'superb', 'props', 'excellent', 'acting', 'get', '5*', 'almost', 'involved.The', 'viewer', 'wrapped', 'world', 'middle', 'east', 'entirely', 'beleivable', 'way.The', 'love', 'story', 'focal', 'point', 'blossoms', 'accurate', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'first', 'few', 'meetings.The', 'plot', 'then', 'aspects', 'prejudice', 'external', 'families', 'clannish', 'beliefs', 'anti-semitism', 'prejudice', 'there', 'ways', 'saying', 'give', 'so', 'shall', 'recieve', 'attempts', 'four', 'young', 'people', 'time', 'trying', 'change', 'world', 'bigorty', 'small', 'mindedness', 'case', 'often', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'vitriolic', 'especially', 'own', 'found', 'wishing', 'such', 'people', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'actions', 'filmed', 'then', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', 'themselves.The', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'was', 'unusual', 'left', 'feeling', 'only', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'had', 'what', 'next', 'definitive', 'conclusion', '[', 'others', 'may', 'view', 'differently', ']', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'enhance', 'storyline', 'alone', 'cost', '2', 'stars.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'bought', 'will', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'be', 'left', 'unfilled', 'anticipation', 'felt', 'when', 'watching', 'credits', 'first', 'time']",Every Time We Say Goodbye VHS

198057,A3EKK7FDAZECS9,6300180204,T. Quach,"[92, 92]","This movie is amazing.  I saw it once many years ago and I never really got over it.  It's an incredibly dramatic, romantic, touching, and realistic story of young love in the 1940s.  Hanks plays a WWII American pilot stationed in Jerusalem who falls in love with a Sephardic girl played by Christina Marsillach.  Of course, Marsillach's family is dead-set against their daughter dating the American.  The film focuses in on their forbidden love affair, and Hanks and Marsillach have amazing on-screen chemistry.  The characters are remarkably real and raw, as is the storyline.  There is no sugar-coated perfect ending, but it's not depressing either.  This is one of those rare films that is able to capture at once both the dispair of human prejudices and the optimism of human determination.  I rewatched this movie recently, and I was overwhelmed by the same feelings I felt when I watched it for the very first time.  Although it's out of print and one of Tom Hanks' lesser known films, it's definitely worth the effort.  Try getting your hands on a copy--you won't regret it.
