Yes I've seen plenty of his films and I've enjoyed them especially ""Penny Serenade"", ""Vivacious Lady"", ""Swing Time"", and ""Woman of the Year"" but all of these works while enjoyable are slight. I guess ""Giant"" had lots of ambition though. But I fear I'm just getting myself in more and more trouble the longer I go on.""The More the Merrier"" is a great 1940s romantic comedy. Jean Arthur stars as Connie Milligan, a young woman trying to do her part during the war by renting out half of her apartment during a housing shortage. One of the many people who answer the ad is Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn), who has come to Washington to address the shortage. Benjamin convinces Connie to her let rent him the room. Connie, being the respectable woman she is originally wanted to rent it out to a woman. Because after all what would people say about a man and woman living together who aren't even married, why it might turn out to be ""The Talk of the Town"". Joe Carter (Joel McCrea) also answers the ad. Joe is going to Africa and only needs a place for a week. So Benjamin decides to play matchmaker and rents half of his half to Joe without telling Connie.And there you pretty much have the set-up for this movie. What makes a movie like this so funny to watch is no one is acting it up. We find that so often today in comedies. People like Adam Sandler or Mike Myers constantly winking at us telling us they are funny. It ruins the experience for me. I don't want them to tell me what I'm suppose to think. Don't they know the only way to get real laughs out of a situation is to play it serious. The viewer has to believe in the characters and the situation.George Stevens understands this. Many people may not think of Stevens as a man who knows comedy but you'll be surprised. He was a cinematographer for Hal Roach and filmed several Laurel & Hardy shorts including ""Brats"", ""Below Zero"" and ""The Hoose-Gow"". And as I briefly mentioned before started his career by directing comedies and musicals. He also directed two Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey comedies; ""The Nitwits"" and ""Kentucky Kernels"".There is only one thing about ""The More the Merrier"" I don't quite understand. Why does Benjamin want Connie and Joe to get married? Why does he feel its his business? This didn't bother me enough where it spoiled the movie for me but it just kept me thinking.The movie was nominated for 6 Oscars and won one. Charles Coburn won ""Best Supporting Actor"" while the movie was up for ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"" and ""Best Actress"". Of course it lost to ""Casablanca"". We often think 1939 was the greatest year for Hollywood but 1943 wasn't so bad either. Besides ""Casablanca"" and ""The More the Merrier"" also up that year for awards were ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", Ernst Lubitsch's ""Heaven Can Wait"" and Noel Coward's ""In Which We Serve"".I think anyone who enjoys comedies from the period or Stevens or any of the talent involved will enjoy this film. It really is an example of the kind of great entertainment coming out of the Hollywood studio systems at the time.Bottom-line: Maybe the best of George Stevens early comedies. The cast manages to get their parts down and play it serious. I can think of anyone else in these roles.

344929,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6302909007,Bobby Underwood,"[4, 4]","Written with the wonderful Jean Arthur in mind, this warm and often funny take on the housing and male shortage during WWII has a perfect cast and a romantic charm all its own. Charles Coburn won an Academy Award in support of Arthur and McCrea, who gives another of his very fine but often overlooked performances from the 1940's.Unlike the bold and zany tilt of Carole Lombard or the swanky sophistication of Constance Bennett, Arthur's magic in comedy was her serious reactions to often very funny situations. She was more down-to-earth than many other contemporaries and there was almost a Chaplinesque pathos, if you will, to some of her best performances. The viewer might know everything was going to turn out okay for her, but Arthur's characters always seemed to have their doubts, their happiness hanging by a very precarious, though often very funny, thread.What Lombard and Arthur did have in common, at least in ""The More the Merrier,"" was Lombard's photographer, Ted Tetzlaff. Director George Stevens brought out her vulnerability while Lombard's favorite cinematographer gave the audience glimpses of Arthur's more subdued but still palpable ""wow"" factor. It may have been only a fleeting glance, as in the rooftop beach scene, but it was certainly there, even if she joined Claudette Colbert in not exploiting it.Here Jean Arthur is Constance Milligan, a working girl in Washington doing her patriotic duty during wartime by renting out a portion of her apartment. But the girl she'd had in mind instead turns out to be the hilariously pushy Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn). Dingle is a hoot trying to stick to Constance's rigid by-the-second schedule for everything. When he rents out half of his space and decides to play matchmaker, the film takes on a charm all its very own.Joel McCrea is terrific as regular guy Joe Carter, about to head for Africa courtesy of Uncle Sam. He makes seal noises in the shower and is half the train trying to stick to Connie's schedule; choo choo sounds included! When Dingle discovers she's been engaged for a very long time to someone she doesn't even love, he goes full speed ahead trying to soften her heart in Joe's direction.Her gradual submission to her own feelings for Joe is highlighted by his charming and tender confession of love for her and proposal of marriage through the partition which separates their living quarters. The stars are both warm and real here, making for a memorably touching scene not easily forgotten by romantics.A kicked-out Dingle won't be deterred from what he knows is best for both of them. When propriety gets in the way, the sly Dingle nudges them towards each other where they belong. They make a fabulous threesome in this true film classic. You won't want to miss Coburn and McCrea reading Dick Tracy on the ""beach"" while a distracting Arthur, in high heels none the less, gets a tan.

That alone is a tremendous recommendation for anyone who likes a good romantic comedy, especially if you've found yourself let down by the more mindless entries into the genre (the recent ""Must Love Dogs,"" for example).Some fine synopses of ""The More the Merrier"" can be found elsewhere on this page, so I'll not be repetitive.  Let me just say how wonderful it is to find a film that perfectly captures that magical moment in time when two people have the locomotives of their lives derailed by finding each other completely by accident.  Well, OK, not completely; Mr. Dingle is the engineer of this particular train wreck, the sheer joy of which is not fully clear to anyone until the final five minutes of the film, an ending that is so beautifully planned, constructed, and executed that it gives me goose bumps.The other marvelously pleasurable aspects of this film include the realistic way the dialogue unfolds.  Most films have had the life rehearsed out of them; ""OK, I say this, then pause for a beat so the audience can laugh, then you say this while I wait to respond to what you've said.""  In TMtM, on the other hand, characters sometimes mumble, dialogue overlaps, there are scenes when two characters seem to be ad libbing at the same time, etc., just like the viewer is a fly on the wall rather than watching a polished Hollywood product.  Ah, 'tis a rare and precious thing, this.And finally, TMtM reminds us how sad it is that today's films usually substitute nudity for sexiness.  I have rarely seen a sexier scene than the one where Joel McCrea is walking Jean Arthur home.  He just can't keep his hands off her shoulders, neck, and face, and she half-heartedly fends him off; she has a loveless engagement to be married, and he is a distraction...but ultimately she can't withstand her own feelings for him.  It's heartbreakingly sweet and sensuous, without being the least bit prurient.

344934,A91BK8S5QH98K,6302909007,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[4, 24]","On the cover of the DVD this movie is described as a scandalous romantic comedy.  And I have to say, scandalous is the appropriate term.  Due to the time period there isn't any nudity nor any love scenes.  But that's about all it lacked.  The plot centers around a girl in Washington D.C. who rents out half of her apartment to help ease the housing shortage in D.C.  Well an eccentric millionaire moves in and decides to play match maker.  What we end up with then is a very long and prolonged movie focusing on scenes where Connie and Joe almost get together, but then don't.  The overtones of intimacy are rather strong throughout the film.  And it seems like the writers were fascinated with their ability to get in a swear word by using Admiral Farragut's quote of ""D--- the torpedoes full steam ahead."" over and over and over again.

344935,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302909007,C. O. DeRiemer,"[14, 14]","Was I ever wrong. For years I looked upon Charles Coburn as a fat, porcine old gentlemen who always had a big, wet-chewed cigar in his mouth. I was so awed by the cheesy melodrama of Kings Row that I barely noticed his startling performance as Dr. Gordon, the cruel, vindictive surgeon who made Drake McHugh cry out, ""Where's the rest of me?"" Then I saw The Lady Eve, and then The Devil and Miss Jones. And now, The More the Merrier. Not only could Coburn define surgery at its worst, I finally realized that he was one of the most subtle and skilled practitioners of high-class comedy. Coburn won the Academy Award for best supporting actor for his work in The More the Merrier. He could just as justifiably won it for Eve and Miss Jones. As good a movie as The More the Merrier is, and as good as Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea are, Charles Coburn as Benjamin Dingle, ""a well-to-do retired millionaire,"" who turns out to be an uncommonly sly cupid, refocuses the movie every time he's on screen.We're in the middle of WWII in Washington and housing is almost impossible to come by. Connie Milligan (Jean Arthur) places an ad for a roommate to share her two-bedroom flat. Benjamin Dingle (Coburn) is in town on business and without a hotel room. He spots the ad, bulls his way past a hoard of eager applicants and simply fast talks his way in. He notices that this attractive young woman seems to have a lonely life. In fact, she's engaged to a Washington bureaucrat as romantic as an officious waiter. It's not long before Dingle spots Joe Carter (Joel McCrea) looking for a room. Joe is tall and good-looking. Within minutes Dingle has subleased half of his subleased room to Joe. It won't be long before the three of them are falling over each other. But will Connie and Joe fall for each other? Dingle, with guile and good-intentions, is going to give it a try.This could be as conventionally predictable as a Luci-Desi episode. Thanks to director George Stevens, a bright, funny script, and Arthur, McCrea and Coburn, it's anything but. The More the Merrier is a classy and funny romantic comedy that, especially in the first half, comes close at times to a classic Marx Brothers routine. It even helps at times to appreciate many of the situations as comedy routines, so highly polished by first-rate actors that the comedy pile-ups and split-second timing seem spontaneous. Let's see...for starters there's the ""explaining the morning action plan with diagram"" routine with Arthur and Coburn, the ""who gets the bath, who gets the egg"" routine with Coburn, Arthur and McCrea, the ""where's my pants"" routine with Coburn, the ""Connie and Joe and the leather traveling bag"" routine with Arthur and McCrea, and the ""Who did you go with to the beach"" routine with Arthur and McCrea. Sure, we have three actors playing cute...but if they ever appear that they're playing cute it won't be either cute or funny. Arthur and Coburn are experts at this kind of straight-faced, split-second community comedy, and McCrea, it turns out, is good at it, too.As often as Jean Arthur in the Thirties and Forties had some excellent leading men to work with -- McCrea, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, Charles Boyer, James Stewart and Ronald Colman among others -- it might just be that her perfect partner in comedy was Charles Coburn. They starred in three pictures together:The Devil and Miss Jonesin 1941, The More the Merrier in 1943 and The Impatient Years in 1944. Arthur was a strong, skilled actress who could be fey, puzzled, endearing, innocently romantic, completely natural, sexy and subtle. Her voice, instantly recognizable, helped define her screen persona. She could come across as vulnerable, but she more than held her own in her movies. I can't think of any movies she made after the mid-Thirties that weren't defined as ""Jean Arthur movies."" Coburn, old enough to be her grandfather, was so good an actor -- a comic actor when called upon -- that he managed to make a balance with her that is part of the mystery of why some actors click together and others don't. It's to his skill that he was able to make this connection with other actors as well. Just watch him inThe Lady Eveshare any scene with Barbara Stanwyck.The More the Merrier is one of Hollywood's proudly sweet-natured romantic comedies, with a lot of fast-paced physical action thrown in. Even the sentimentality is amusing. The movie was remade in 1966 as Walk, Don't Run with Gary Grant, Samantha Egger and Jim Hutton. For lessons in how to turn a bright, clever romantic comedy into a plod, Cary Grant's last film, unfortunately, is the one to see.",4,"This classy romantic comedy stars Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea...and

This is one of many great films directed and produced by the legendary George Stevens.  Connie Milligan (Jean Arthur) is a young woman with patriotism in mind, who decides to rent out half of her apartment to someone, due to the housing shortage in wartime Washington DC.  Connie had a female roommate in mind, but, that isn't what she gets.  Mr. Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn) shows up at her front door--an elderly, retired millionaire, whose itinerary is two days ahead of schedule, and is seeking lodging, since his suite at the hotel is still booked up.  Connie's grudgingly forced attempts to compromise with the gentleman, without starting a scandal, is just the beginning of the screwball humor in the film......Mr. Dingle decides that Connie needs a clean-cut nice young man...not the uptight, too old fiancee she is currently seeing.  Joe Carter (Joel McCrea) literally shows up on the frontstep, and the opportunity presents itself for Mr. Dingle to engage in matchmaking, as he rents out  his half of the apartment to the young man.I enjoy the broad humor of this film, that isn't at all dated in my perception.  Also , the leads are likeable and believeable in their roles.

Previously, he has managed to get inside of it himself.I had seen McCrea and Arthur together in the screen for the first time in the Early Talkie ""The Silver Horde"" (1930), a nice and entertaing adventure yarn (she plays his spoiled rich fianc&eacute;e), but neither Arthur had yet blossomed into the excellent actress and deft comediene she was yet to become in the mid 1930's, nor had the great chemistry between both stars developed the way it did in this gem of a movie.As I said before, in spite of censorship's shortcomings and the Code's restrictions, great directors such as George Stevens (the man who gave us Kate Hepburn's ""Alice Adams"" or Liz Taylor's ""A Place in the Sun"") knew how to handle the scenes and show us, insinuating it in a subtle way, in this case, the sexual tension between Connie Milligan and Joe Carter. In fact, never I had seen McCrea or Arthur in such sexy-romantic-""physical"" scenes (by 40's standards), showing the love and desire they feel for each other, all the longing for ""more"".McCrea seems so much ""passionate"" in his romantic secenes, than usual, and Arthur looks sexy to the hoot. What a fine figure this lady had! She surely looks much younger than the 43 years old she was when she made this movie and gets to wear some sexy-outfits (I liked her especially with her hair ""loose"") and even a translucid (or look-through) black nightgown.Trust me, this is one of the most engaging, romantic, amusing, comedies from Hollywood's Golden Era, that you can get.Now, one more time Columbia-Sony leads us into mistake, with its statement on the back-cover of the DVD Case, that this film was ""remastered in high definition"". The quality of the transfer is so-so, pretty uneven I'd dare to say, with many imperfections. But then, it's the only DVD edition available of this masterpiece, so buy it anyway!

The DVD, bought for me thru Amazon by relatives, appears overly sharpened compared to the tape; having seen this film on the big screen at MOMA, I'd say the VHS is visually more faithful to the original. But I give a very, very skilled cast and good direction the benefit. Set along the lines of 30's screwball comedies, this film has the formula right but lacks inspiration after the first 30 minutes, mainly because the writers abandoned earlier plot premises along with any semblance of character consistency. Still, the first third is crackling good fun. It soon fizzles and many of the plot devices just don't work, starting with Coburn's out-of-character dirty trick (which was not at all amusing). Near the end look for a classic flirting and kissing sequence that stands out all the more brilliantly amid the other comedy routines that not only don't work but don't make any sense. Its flaws are mostly due to poor plotting and writing, not to mention weird turnarounds in character development -- but this remains a keeper because of a truly wonderful cast and skilled direction. It's also a great look at wartime living in Washington DC, which was pretty much the same zoo it is today. Jean Arthur is almost breathlessly cute; she and the cast do as well as could be expected with some flawed writing. The movie was remade as ""Walk, Don't Run"" (Cary Grant's last film), a disastrously lame effort at ""improving"" the imperfect original. The actor who comes off best here is McCrae, who managed to keep his character consistent and whose talent for comedic underplaying is pure genius.",3,"DVD is same movie as the VHS, same comments",1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,1685,"['Too', 'bad', 'way', 'post', 'half-star', 'ratings', 'here', 'mine', 'would', 'be', '3-1/2', 'instead', '4', 'DVD', 'bought', 'thru', 'Amazon', 'relatives', 'overly', 'sharpened', 'compared', 'tape', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'MOMA', ""'d"", 'say', 'VHS', 'visually', 'more', 'faithful', 'original', 'give', 'very', 'very', 'skilled', 'cast', 'good', 'direction', 'benefit', 'Set', 'lines', '30', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'film', 'formula', 'right', 'inspiration', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'mainly', 'writers', 'abandoned', 'earlier', 'plot', 'premises', 'semblance', 'character', 'consistency', 'Still', 'first', 'third', 'crackling', 'good', 'fun', 'soon', 'fizzles', 'many', 'plot', 'devices', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'starting', 'Coburn', 'out-of-character', 'dirty', 'trick', 'was', 'not', 'amusing', 'end', 'look', 'classic', 'flirting', 'kissing', 'sequence', 'out', 'more', 'brilliantly', 'other', 'comedy', 'routines', 'not', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'flaws', 'are', 'mostly', 'due', 'poor', 'plotting', 'writing', 'not', 'mention', 'weird', 'turnarounds', 'character', 'development', 'keeper', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'skilled', 'direction', 'also', 'great', 'look', 'wartime', 'living', 'Washington', 'DC', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'zoo', 'today', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'almost', 'breathlessly', 'cute', 'cast', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'flawed', 'writing', 'movie', 'was', 'remade', 'Walk', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Run', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'last', 'film', 'disastrously', 'lame', 'effort', 'improving', 'imperfect', 'original', 'actor', 'who', 'off', 'best', 'here', 'McCrae', 'who', 'managed', 'keep', 'character', 'consistent', 'talent', 'comedic', 'underplaying', 'pure', 'genius']",N/A

344948,A1W6AMIGHPX3UQ,6302909007,J. Merritt,"[7, 7]","This underrated 1943 comedy stars Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea, and the fabulous Charles Coburn. Set in Washington, DC during World War II, it's the story of a young woman (Arthur) forced by the drastic housing shortage to take in two male boarders. Or, I should say, she agrees to rent to Coburn, who then takes it upon himself to sublet half of his half to McCrea. The film then evolves into a question of whether Coburn will be able to orchestrate a union between Arthur and McCrea. (If the plot sounds familiar, it's because it was remade in 1966 as ""Walk, Don't Run,"" Cary Grant's last film).While the ending isn't hard to see coming, the ride is great fun. Joel McCrea was either immensely limited as an actor or just very subtle, but in any case his deadpan delivery serves him well here. The real star of the show, though, is Coburn. Arthur displays her trademark agitation through the entire picture, in this case no doubt because she knows Coburn is going to steal every one of their scenes together. He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this, and deservedly so. With a single performance at the age of 66, he cornered the market in kindly but devious elder statesmen.",5,"Good Work All Around, But It's Charlie's Show",1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,1178,"['underrated', '1943', 'comedy', 'stars', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'fabulous', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'Set', 'Washington', 'DC', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'Arthur', 'forced', 'drastic', 'housing', 'shortage', 'take', 'two', 'male', 'boarders', 'should', 'say', 'rent', 'Coburn', 'who', 'then', 'sublet', 'half', 'half', 'McCrea', 'film', 'then', 'question', 'Coburn', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'orchestrate', 'union', 'Arthur', 'McCrea', 'plot', 'familiar', 'was', 'remade', '1966', 'Walk', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Run', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'last', 'film', 'ending', ""n't"", 'hard', 'see', 'coming', 'ride', 'great', 'fun', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'was', 'immensely', 'limited', 'actor', 'just', 'very', 'subtle', 'case', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'well', 'here', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'Coburn', 'Arthur', 'trademark', 'agitation', 'entire', 'picture', 'case', 'doubt', 'Coburn', 'going', 'steal', 'one', 'scenes', 'together', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'deservedly', 'so', 'single', 'performance', 'age', '66', 'cornered', 'market', 'kindly', 'devious', 'elder', 'statesmen']",N/A

Jaco,"[5, 5]","During WWII, the people trying to live in the Washington, D.C. area have to deal with a housing shortage, so when Jean Arthur's character offers half of her 2-br apartment as a patriotic gesture, clever Charles Coburn snags it.  Dismayed that such a delightful and pretty girl (and in this film, Jean Arthur's assets are on display more here than in any other I've seen) is without a proper husband, especially with D.C. being 8 to 1 women over men, he makes it his business to set her up. Along comes Joel McCrea who becomes Coburn's roommate in half of his half of the apartment.The convolutions of plot that result are a true delight, and the steamy signature scene when McCrea and Arthur say goodnight on her stoop pushes the limit of Hollywood's censors, but throughout one can sense the overriding feeling that ""hey, it's war time - give the folks, especially the boys overseas, something to fight for"" is uppermost in the filmmakers' minds.  Scenes with beautiful women abound, but some of them, such as when the factory women give McCrea a group wolf whistle, show just how much life back home misses those who are not there.This is an adorable movie, with adorable characters designed to (and succeeding at) giving you a good time.

344955,A1UDOU7QLVX9QB,6302909007,Linda J. Barrett,"[8, 8]","This comedy is set in Washington D.C., smack in the middle of WW II...1943 to be exact. At the time, Washington D.C. was one of the busiest and most crowded cities in the U.S. The housing shortage was at an all time high, with homes, apartments and hotel rooms at a premium.  It wasn't unusual for hotel lobbies, train stations...even park benches...to be filled with the overflow of people unable to find somewhere to live, or to stay for a night. To remedy this, many opened their homes by renting out rooms as a way of contributing to the war effort. This is working premise of ""The More the Merrier"".Retired millionaire, Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn) has turned up several days early for an important meeting in Washington and finds his reserved hotel room unavailable. Forced to find accommodations elsewhere, the wily Dingle wanders through one of Washington's parks and sees a statue of Admiral David Farragut and his famous words, ""Damn the torpedoes! Full steam ahead!"" Taking this as a sign, he uses this inspiration to connive his way into the apartment of Constance Mulligan (Jean Arthur) a single, attractive and very patriotic young woman who has placed a ""For Rent"" ad in one of the papers and is ready to sub-let her apartment. She's determined to rent to a woman and is reluctant to open her apartment to a ""strange"" man. With some quick talking and ready cash, however, Dingle gets Ms. Mulligan to relent for one week. Within moments of his moving in, Dingle asks Ms. Mulligan why she isn't married...doesn't she want to be married? Would she be interested in marrying if an upright, honest, strong, down-to-earth type should happen along? And so Dingle's role as Dan Cupid begins and the plot thickens.In a very short while, Joe Carter (Joel McCrea) arrives on the scene, drawn by the same ""For Rent"" ad.  Dingle spots him before Ms. Mulligan does and immediately sizes him up as the upright, honest, strong, down to earth type perfect for our heroine and sub-lets his half of the apartment to Joe...without Ms. Mulligan's knowledge or approval, of course. The plot thickens and so do the laughs. This is considered by most to be one of the finest comedies of the 1940s. Directed by George Stevens, known by many for his superlative color WWII documentaries and his movies directing the wonder team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, this film is his absolute best. The entire cast is perfect, with Charles Coburn winning an Oscar for best supporting actor. Jean Arthur is sensational and portrays Constance Mulligan in her unique way...incredibly sexy and demure at the same time. Add to this the fact that she was one of the few actresses during this time that could pull-off playing a woman in her 20s while she, herself, was in her 40s! As for Joel McCrea...known for his droll, understated acting...he plays Joe Carter with wit and humor that really lets his talent shine.The chemistry between McCrea and Arthur is palatable and this movie must have set a lot of hearts a fluttering. With women movie goers out numbering the men, this was perfect fare for all those love starved, male deprived women in the viewing audience. This movie is downright sexy...truly...more than almost any movie of its time...certainly any comedy. The scene on the apartment steps where Joe is trying to put the moves on Constance is one example, but the best moment is in the apartment. Only a thin wall separates their bedrooms, with their beds ""meeting"" up against this wall. In one pivotal scene, Stevens has managed to ""bleed out"" the wall, so it appears that they are actually in bed together. This was heavy stuff considering that the Hays Office at the time censored anything that showed a married couple in the same bed...let alone an unmarried couple. This was Steven's very clever way of getting around this and boy does it work! I know it may be hard to believe in this era of anything goes that something so seemingly innocent could be so erotic, but it was...is!With an incredible cast, masterful direction, a great screenplay (Garson Kanin worked on the screenplay and it shows, although he's not officially credited) and wonderful cinematography, ""The More the Merrier"" is one of those movies any fan of Hollywood's Golden Age should have in their collection. If you're not sure you're ready to purchase it, see if your local library has it in their collection, or check TCM for their next showing...but, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Dimes to dollars you'll end up purchasing it, it's that good.

344958,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6302909007,MadMacs,"[2, 2]","Was watching a TCM rebroadcast of this film and learned that Jean Arthur never felt she was 'sexy' or 'alluring' - thinking herself more the plucky sweet sister type. Understandably both hosts disagreed, and this film proves why.Filmed during the height of World War II - when the entire country ""went to war"" - it was considered everyone's civic and patriotic duty to endure whatever was necessary so that the Axis powers would not win. This amazing, and almost inconceivable act in the modern fractured USA, included both large and small feats of sacrifice. From families who gave up food for the war effort, to small kids who would run around collecting bits and pieces of metal for recycling; from women picking up hammers-n-rivets in the factories to older folks who became civil servants well past their retirement years. Everyone pitched in, everyone contributed.In this midst, and central to the theme of this wonderful film, was Washington D.C. During the war the nation's capitol was literally overrun with people. Not just from our country, but people from across the world who were scrambling about their business in what was considered the bastion of freedom for the entire planet. And on a practical level - that meant living space was a premium luxury. With so many people and a limited fixed number of accommodations, it was every citizen's duty to open up their residences and help ease the overcrowding. A small housing unit that would normally accept one or two persons would now take in three, four, even five people. And that's if you were lucky.'Merrier' begins with one of the unlucky.Army Sergeant Joe Carter, played by Joel McCrea, gets stuck in between duty assignments with no place to stay before shipping out. Despite herculean efforts, he ends up sleeping in a public park. However, fate intervenes when he meets a clever older gentleman: Mr. Benjamin Dingle. Wonderfully played by veteran actor Charles Coburn who, during this period in films, was one of the big screen's best loved movie con artists and manipulators. By hook or crook seems to be Mr. Dingle's motto as he locates Sgt. Carter a place to bed down by sneaking him into an already overcrowded apartment.Said unit is owned by Jean Arthur's character Ms. Connie Milligan. A native to D.C., she opens her doors as her patriotic duty. And having already sub-leased her space to the wily Mr. Dingle, unwittingly sets in motion the series of comic events that will lead to true love.Already incredibly enjoyable, one scene in particular stood out. At the movie's climax (a most fitting entendre if there ever was one) both she and Joe have endured a long terrible night of electric sexual tension - when the thin bedsheet separating the pair ""accidentally"" falls down and Connie is caught in a sheer black nightie. Yowza!If Jean Arthur's squeaks and moans aren't enough to make a man rise out of his... chair, then you might want to consider seeking a position on the other team. &lt;g>Fantastic romantic-comedy that never loses its edge!Movie Notes:- Later remade as 1966's 'Walk, Don't Run', the last film in the storied career of one of my all-time favorite actors, Cary Grant.- If you enjoyed this film, please check out a similar romantic comedy produced in the same period: From 1944, 'Standing Room Only', with the stunning Paulette Goddard and Fred MacMurray.",4,"Jean Arthur - Black Nightie - 'Nuff Said.

Being the patriotic sort Constance Milligan  (Jean Arthur) decided to do what thousands of other Washingtonians did during those hectic years.....sublet her apartment.  She put a small ad in the local newspaper and dozens of folks showed up on her doorstep to inquire.  Now Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn) was a retired millionaire who was in town to advise government officials on how to ease the housing crunch and paradoxically found himself without a place to stay.  Mr. Dingle also saw Constance Milligan's ad in the paper and through a combination of deception, persistence and persusion was able to finagle his way into sharing this apartment against the better judgement of his landlady.  Constance's instincts were dead on.  Dingle would prove to be a meddling old busybody and a constant thorn in her side.  George Stevens' 1943 madcap comedy ""The More The Merrier"" tells the hilarious story just what happened over the next few days.  And in the end Constance Milligan would get more than she bargained for....much more!Benjamin Dingle had barely settled into his half of the apartment when he started asking Constance some pretty personal questions.  She had just recorded the following entry into her diary:  ""Wednesday... just rented half of apartment to funny old man named Dingle.  At least someone around to break the silence.""  It seems as though Dingle had sized up his new roommate pretty quickly and fairly accurately.  He wondered why Constance was not married and opined that she should hook up with ""a high type, clean-cut young fellow"". Then Dingle asked her if she kept a diary. She answered with an emphatic ""No!"". To which Mr. DIngle replied ""There are two kinds of people Miss Milligan. Those who don't do what they want to do so they write down in a diary about what they haven't done and those who are too busy to write about it because they are out doing it."" Ouch! The plot thickens the next day when one of those them there ""high type, clean cut young fellows"" shows up looking for a place to stay. Dingle takes matters into his own hands and sublets his half of the apartment to a soldier named Sergeant Joe Carter (Joel McCrea) who is in town for just a few days before shipping out to an overseas assignment. And as you might expect all hell breaks loose when Constance learns of this arrangement. After she catches Dingle reading her diary she tosses him out on his ear but winds up agreeing to let Joe Carter stay for just a few more days. It turns out Benjamin Dingle was right. Sparks fly and Joe and Connie fall in love.""The More The Merrier"" turns out to be yet another extremely entertaining film from Hollywood's Golden Age.  Once again, Jean Arthur turns in a stellar performance.  I could not take me eyes off her.  She really is the classic ""girl next door"" and I have become a huge fan over the past few years.  I now own most of the films she appeared in.  Charles Coburn is delightful as Dingle and Joel McCrea does a workmanlike job in the role of Joe Carter.

Frustrated but not defeated, he slyly acquires himself an apartment with Connie Milligan (Jean Arthur). She is not happy to be sharing a room with a man, let alone a man who cannot even follow a schedule properly, but she resigns herself to the situation. Then Dingle invites a soldier (Joel McCrea) on leave to stay in half of his half of the apartment and makes a profit from it. Joe obviously likes Connie and she tries to hide her admiration for him too, but she is engaged to a much older and incredibly high strung businessman, Mr. Pendergast (Richard Gaines).If you never had a fondness for Arthur, watch The More the Merrier. She is just gorgeous in all of her scenes and her costumes are to die for. It is fun to watch her small emotional changes too. Not once does she go over the top with her acting; she always gets a laugh when appropriate and becomes vulnerable when we need to like her character. She was a master actress, and is certainly one of the most underrated leading ladies of the golden age. She and McCrea are wonderful together, and aided by director George Stevens' soft lighting, their scenes are very romantic. The film is very funny too; each of the characters contribute to the fun.

344967,A315WMPERH1S0Z,6302909007,Tee,"[12, 12]","THE MORE THE MERRIER was one of the biggest hits of 1943 and one of the very best comedies of the 1940's.  It received many Oscar nominations and won the Best Supporting Actor award for Charles Coburn as well as earning the great Jean Arthur her only nomination (a crime!) for the Best Actress Academy Award.  This is a truly amazing comedy that touches on virtually every comedy genre from slapstick to romantic to verbal bantering.  Coburn is great fun although I do agree with one reviewer his character at times really pushes the envelope and comes close to being out of line but fortunately the film is so light-hearted, well acted and directed the character's presumptuous edges never become unpleasant.  As great as Colburn is this movie really belongs to Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea, two great stars who may have just missed being superstars by a hair but here (as on many other occasions) showing they had the talent and charisma to equal their more celebrated contemporaries.  Neither of them have ever been as sexy as they are here, Jean's sloppy brushing of her teeth not withstanding.  One of the most amazing things about the movie is practically a three-person play despite running 104 minutes, quite long for a comedy from the era. Richard Gaines as Jean's nerdy steady has the only sizable supporting role, everyone else virtually plays a bit part.  This movie has some of the best laugh outloud gags of any film I've ever seen with a tender romance nicely bubbling under the surface.I own the VHS release and while most of the print is quite flawless, it has many bad spots in it with lines, dirt, and scratches.  I'm very disappointed to read in another review that the DVD version is not much better, perhaps the same.  This seems to be a consistent problem with vintage Columbia films released on video or DVD, I've noticed similar problems with MISS GRANT TAKES RICHMOND and THEODORA GOES WILD.  Hasn't it ever crossed these people's minds to use multiple prints of a film and cut out the bad bits in a superior print and splice in the same scenes that are not damaged in a second print? That would really not be much of an effort.  It seems as if Columbia doesn't even screen some of the prints they use as their masters.
