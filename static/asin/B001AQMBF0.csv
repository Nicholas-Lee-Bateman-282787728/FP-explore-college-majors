As I note in my title, this series was pretty watchable in its first two seasons because of a very strong performance by the actors playing the two Caffey brothers.But I felt that by Season 3, the series really started to veer away from what I thought was plausible ...and given the incredible reality of what happened during the real Bulger case, I was surprised they didn't rely on events that we know did happen (albeit fictionalized for this series).  Consider these items and how believable you find them:1.  Michael Caffey commits about eight or nine murders in a single year.  Whitey Bulger committed about 19 total murders in about 18 years.2.  Michael Caffey murders an associate US Attorney and we don't see a particularly strong reaction by the police (granted, he &#34;disappeared&#34; the body), but I would think that if an AUSA who was working on organized crime cases mysteriously vanished, there would be massive pressure by federal and local law enforcement to find out what would happen and Michael Caffey, his Irish friends, and the local mafia would find themselves under unbelievable pressure.  Consider this:  Whitey Bulger never did anything like that because he knew the heat it would generate.3.  The idea that Declan would be heading up an investigation into corruption was preposterous.  He had been a drug addict, had witnessed his partner murder an FBI agent, and then stood by and allowed Michael to disappear that corpse as well.  On the witness stand, he would have been destroyed by a competent lawyer.4.  Eileen suddenly transforms from a coke snorting, pot smoking, vicodin inhaling addict into mother of the year without any difficulties. I would have bought her cleaning up her act some but it would have been a lot more believable if we'd seen her actually attend an AA or Narcotics Anonymous Meeting or maybe even go through some withdrawal pains.Another thing I don't understand is why the series didn't use some of the same real life plot that made the Bulger case so incredible in real life.  Bulger had at least two FBI agents in his pocket and several more just about there, and he had at least one corrupt local police officer as well.  These men compromised law enforcement investigations and got informants murdered.  But the show used none of that.So while I can give a recommendation to watch the first two seasons of this show, I can't endorse the third.",2,"The first two seasons of this were pretty good, but the third became too implausible for me to be able to watch",1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,2768,"['60', 'spoilers', 'why', 'someone', 'who', 'afraid', 'learning', 'key', 'plot', 'details', 'would', 'read', 'review', 'show', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'titled', '62', 'got', 'interested', 'series', 'reading', 'very', 'good', 'book', 'real', 'life', 'Irish-American', 'gangster', 'who', 'inspired', '34', 'Brotherhood.', '34', ""'m"", 'referring', 'course', 'James', '34', 'Whitey', '34', 'Bulger', 'note', 'title', 'series', 'was', 'pretty', 'watchable', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'actors', 'playing', 'two', 'Caffey', 'brothers.But', 'felt', 'Season', '3', 'series', 'really', 'started', 'veer', 'away', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'plausible', 'given', 'incredible', 'reality', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'Bulger', 'case', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'events', 'know', 'did', 'happen', 'fictionalized', 'series', 'Consider', 'items', 'how', 'believable', 'find', 'them:1', 'Michael', 'Caffey', 'eight', 'nine', 'murders', 'single', 'year', 'Whitey', 'Bulger', 'committed', '19', 'total', 'murders', 'about', '18', 'years.2', 'Michael', 'Caffey', 'murders', 'associate', 'US', 'Attorney', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'particularly', 'strong', 'reaction', 'police', 'granted', '34', 'disappeared', '34', 'body', 'would', 'think', 'AUSA', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'organized', 'crime', 'cases', 'mysteriously', 'vanished', 'would', 'be', 'massive', 'pressure', 'federal', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Michael', 'Caffey', 'Irish', 'friends', 'local', 'mafia', 'would', 'find', 'unbelievable', 'pressure', 'Consider', 'Whitey', 'Bulger', 'never', 'did', 'anything', 'knew', 'heat', 'would', 'generate.3', 'idea', 'Declan', 'would', 'be', 'heading', 'up', 'investigation', 'corruption', 'was', 'preposterous', 'had', 'been', 'drug', 'addict', 'had', 'witnessed', 'partner', 'murder', 'FBI', 'agent', 'then', 'stood', 'allowed', 'Michael', 'disappear', 'corpse', 'as', 'well', 'witness', 'stand', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'competent', 'lawyer.4', 'Eileen', 'suddenly', 'coke', 'snorting', 'pot', 'smoking', 'vicodin', 'inhaling', 'addict', 'mother', 'year', 'difficulties', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'cleaning', 'up', 'act', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'believable', ""'d"", 'seen', 'actually', 'attend', 'AA', 'Narcotics', 'Anonymous', 'Meeting', 'maybe', 'even', 'go', 'withdrawal', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'same', 'real', 'life', 'plot', 'made', 'Bulger', 'case', 'so', 'incredible', 'real', 'life', 'Bulger', 'had', 'least', 'two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'pocket', 'several', 'more', 'just', 'there', 'had', 'least', 'one', 'corrupt', 'local', 'police', 'officer', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'compromised', 'law', 'enforcement', 'investigations', 'got', 'informants', 'murdered', 'show', 'used', 'none', 'that.So', 'can', 'give', 'recommendation', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'endorse', 'third']",Brotherhood: The Final Season

Durham ""Big Evil""","[6, 6]","The third, and sadly final, season of Showtime's Brotherhood finds the world of the Caffee family getting rocked like never before.  For gangster Michael (Jason Isaacs), he's finding that being in charge isn't as cracked up as it could be, made even more so by the release of Freddie Cork (Kevin Chapman) who himself isn't happy about his new role.  For Tommy Caffee (Jason Clarke), he seeks to leave his life of politics behind him and finally move his pregnant wife Eileen (Annabeth Gish) and family off of The Hill, which soon enough becomes easier said than done.  The rest of the crew has their hands fill as wel, including controlling matriarch Rose (Fionnula Flanagan) and her failing health, Colin (Brian F. O'Byrne) finds his loyalties to Michael tested, and Declan's (Ethan Embry) quest for peace with his wife and job hits a few roadblocks as he makes some huge discoveries that could shake The Hill and the Caffee's to their cores.  The third season of Brotherhood really finds the series hitting its stride, which is a crying shame considering that it got the axe after struggling ratings-wise.  Still, we should be glad that creator Blake Masters managed to wrap things up as much as he did here, and we weren't left on a never-to-be-resovled cliffhanger.

I sure hope this isn't the end of it, but if so, there is a certain inevitable kind of resolution to the various situations. What really amazes me is how the camera will linger on what would normally be considered a mundane scene, allowing you to soak up all of the nuances of the characters lives. This is not something you will find on any other TV show and indeed most movies, as they are so bereft of character development and their plots are so contrived that they must resort to constantly moving the camera around and fast cuts to try to keep you from becoming bored with their vacuity.

The blasphemy and nudity/sex scenes were unnecessary, and frankly, uncomfortable to listen to and watch.  It just didn't do anything for the story and if nothing else, it slowed it down with such detours.  It would have had a much greater sense of drama and intensity without such dialog and diversions.  I hate when writers/producers compromise an otherwise great story/series in this way, rather than utilizing great dialogue to propel the story / action or even no dialogue they stoop to blasphemy and explicit language.  Could have used more interesting shots or hints on what might happen for realism and suspense rather than relying on bad sex scenes / nudity.A really good trilogy that could have been awesome with some audio and scene editing as noted above.  Otherwise, great cast, believable characters, just enough grit and tension, fast pace, good story and turn of events.
