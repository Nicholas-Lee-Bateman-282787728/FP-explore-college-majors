Most of the other collections in this series have two good and one so-so episode on them. These three are really the bottom of the barrel, particularly in ""Jackets"" you can tell the writers had run out of ideas. Nevertheless it remains educational and my toddler enjoys it occasionally in rotation with his other videos in the series...",3,Not the best in the series,1044576000,"02 7, 2003",2003,464,"['three', 'Elmo', 'World', 'episodes', 'Hats', 'Jackets', 'Shoes', 'collected', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'most', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'adults', 'Most', 'other', 'collections', 'series', 'have', 'two', 'good', 'one', 'so-so', 'episode', 'three', 'are', 'really', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'particularly', 'Jackets', 'can', 'tell', 'writers', 'had', 'run', 'ideas', 'Nevertheless', 'educational', 'toddler', 'occasionally', 'rotation', 'other', 'videos', 'series']",Elmo's World - Head to Toe With Elmo

He loves it, but it may be one of the ones a grown-up can tolerate least.  Discuesses shoes, jackets, hats...YOu have not really reach your limit with Elmo until you put up with Jacket and Jill jokes.  One real complaint though...Elmo tells kids that when a jacquet is dirty, it goes into the washing machine.

I have purchased most of the ""Elmo's World"" DVDs for my toddler, who is three years if age. He loves Elmo and counts and sings along with him during the video. I think that  Elmo's songs could be a little more inventive, (when Elmo sits at his piano and just repeats the same word over and over I think it's odd--couldn't anyone write a chorus?) but that is my only complaint.
