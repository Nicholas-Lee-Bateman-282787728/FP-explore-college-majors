I dig this movie. You could watch it with your brain behind your back and relax with your fingers all covered with drizzly popcorn butter... or you can have a genuinely smart romp through the land of suspense and cool.The plot is fairly simple. A woman is kidnapped (Kim Basinger) by a sharper than average group of badguys who seem to know a little too much about the good guys. William H. Macy is great as the cop who just wants to retire and open a day-spa with his wife, though the situation just doesn't sit well with him. Jason Statham... ah, what a cool cat... he will eventually be the action star to sit on the Schwarzeneggar and Stallone throne, along with The Rock (yeah I said it). Anyway, she manages to piece together a broken telephone and again manages to make a single random call that becomes her and her families' only hope.Overall, you can easily (after reading much more indepth reviews) pretty much sum up the story, but thats not my job today. Its a great movie, and surprisingly so. Some people have labeled this movie as ""tone-deaf"" because of the two contrasting themes between Statham's dead-serious I will kill you attitude towards his kidnapee's, and the funny moments that surround William H. Macy and Chris Evans. Well, I think its a nice balance, and I also think that those people don't have five full bars. Buy it, you can watch it when the friends come over.

Cellular was marketed as a suspense thriller but it is full of fluffy jokes and robotic acting.

865339,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006D3HGA,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 6]","Do you know what I liked about this story?  I loved the imagination that was created when the film ended.  If you don't know what I am talking about, let me explain.  I walked away from this film interested in seeing where Ryan and Basinger's relationship was going to go.  After a traumatic incident like the one they experienced together, you can't help but wonder if possibly they will have this darker and haunting relationship built off that trauma after the credits finish rolling.  Just a thought that I had.  There has to be some psychological issues going on between them (though with the acting that both possessed, I don't think you could tell), and I think that would make for a better story than what was presented here.  Nonetheless, that is what I like to call ""wishful thinking"" and another genuine story that will never be created.  So, faced with the challenge ... wait ... my cell phone is ringing ... ok, I'm back ... faced with the challenge of writing this review, I must try to be as clich&eacute; as possible (it would only be respectful).This action packed cellular ride showcased the poor acting ability of Kim Basinger and the honest proof that Oscar's are sometimes just handed out to anyone.  Couldn't they have afforded Marisa Tomei?  Either way, from the unbelievable turn as a science teacher to also a doctor, there was nothing real about her performance.  Even when she was frightened, she wasn't actually frightened, but instead ""acting"" frightened.  There was no depth or range to her character.  I didn't care if she survived or died throughout this entire story.  There was nothing that attached me to her, other than the fact that she was like a feminine MacGyver of sorts.  Then, if Basinger's acting wasn't poor enough, you also had to deal with the ability of Chris Evans to work with a cell phone.  I mean, please, if you were given a script and your co-actor was a piece of machinery, you really have to start thinking about which direction you want your career to go.  Evans only has about three faces of surprise and excitement, and he used them all within the first three minutes of the film.  The rest of the time we are left with nothing more than recycled emotions as he attempts to upstage his cell phone.  It was pathetic.  With these two actors anchoring the film down on both ends, it made me happy to have a cell phone in this picture.  Without it, I don't think there would have been any value to this.  Could you image this film with a rotary phone?  HA.  That would have made a much better film than what was presented here.I would like to take a moment to compliment the cell phone on its ability in this film.  I don't know about you, but I hope that it was paid better than the actors that were involved.  I hope it had its own trailer, its own entourage, and everything it desired.  Was there an audition for this cell phone?  I think I would have enjoyed seeing the audition tapes as a supplemental feature to this DVD.  When Oscars come around again this year, I would not be surprised to see the cell phone perhaps be nominated?  Is that too much to ask?  I mean, look at the world today.  Cell phone is at the peak of its game.  Everyone has one, and everyone is talking to one.  It is the biggest star this world has ever seen, and finally it has the ability to showcase its talent in this film.  I loved everything this cell phone did in this movie, especially the ending.  While you may think that it was a climactic moment between Statham and Macy, I thought that I was biting my fingers over the cell phone more than the human element.  When it rang at the end, I nearly jumped.  What other actor could bring that much emotion to the screen ... none ... other than this multi-talented cell phone.  I wouldn't be surprised it the next picture that it chose to do would be perhaps a period piece film.  You know, stretch its talent.  Don't be surprised if you see more from this amazing actor as the years progress.  I think it is likely to take the place of the ""Hall of Fame"" actor, the cigarette.  Just watch and see!Overall, outside of the cell phone, this was a poor film.  This film is labeled as an ""action"" film, but for some reason laughter bellowed from me more than actual excitement.  Cellular was riddled with implausible events coupled with clich&eacute;d moments that screamed Hollywood control.  While it did showcase some great actors who have developed a fine body of work, this film proves that even the mighty can fall.  Statham needs to stop working for money and Macy was just getting paid.  Basinger needs to remarry Baldwin and live off his money for awhile.  With bad acting and just this hysterical dilemma, the mixed bag of messages seemed to just get further and further away from reality.  It became a comedy instead of an action film.  From the beginning to the end, there was nothing redeeming about this picture (outside of the acting from the cell phone).  I have trouble seeing what people loved about this film.  Honestly, if this were to happen to you, would you steal cars, shoot people, and cause explosions?  Nope, I think the general public would just hang up.  Test this theory out when you have the time.Grade: two bars out of five",2,"You haven't been kidnapped today, have you?",1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,5242,"['Do', 'know', 'what', 'liked', 'story',

Those in need of evidence that Hollywood is really an overgrown puppy mill whose only mission is to perpetuate itself should start here.  Cliches, cheesy gimmicks, and one-sentence concepts - suitable for elevators - stroll with comfortable familiarity as if to suggest - Hollywood really is the one place where they believe practice makes perfect.Writer Larry Cohen is also responsible for a somewhat less idiotic communications industry film called Phone Booth, another ""high-concept thriller.""  In Phone Booth, a man could not hang up because a high-powered rifle-wielding psycho wouldn't let him.  In Cellular, a man cannot hang up because the fate of leggy, luscious Kim Basinger - trapped in an attic by creepy corrupt cops - depends on it.  (Apparently Hollywood writers spend a lot of time thinking about phones.)  This movie is so profoundly lazy it doesn't even leave SoCal for its setting, instead treating us to Brentwood footage, (Spoiler Alert: Look for the shot with O.J. wielding a large knife and guilty conscience), and Santa Monica Pier where hundreds of bikini clad girls stroll and troll, cell phones embedded in their ears.  Cohen turned over his story to neophyte screenwriter Chris Morgan presumably because it's hard to mess up a paint-by-numbers project.Highlights:  William H. Macy as a cop who actually has a personality, unlike the other cops in this movie, he's not made of cardboard.  Chantille Boudousque, an enchanting sylph so chilly she still manages to beam beneath the blistering heat.  Rick Hoffman, a man who has turned the hideousness of his visage into an asset.  Part human and part beaver, (or rat); Hoffman - in his blue Porsche - externalizes the inner ugliness that must, simply must, be at the core of all lawyers.  Chris Evans as Ryan, the protagonist, manages to not look embarrassed by the poor writing and direction - that's acting!  Product placement - the producers of this film obviously shopped it around to all the cell carriers, see if you can figure out who won!  Kim Basinger.  Basinger - an actual actress - spends much of this movie alone in an attic, which enables her to demonstrate her skills without being dragged down by the carnage elsewhere.When cell phones first became popular, I thought of them as a luxury item only used by people with a compelling need to communicate - a business or family emergency.  In no time at all they were ubiquitous, and now provide opportunities for socially abominable behavior that were unthinkable short years ago.  Today, there is no illusion that the conversations held on cell phones are any different from conversations held anywhere else, they are cheap, lazy, pointless, unimaginative, dull, false, and exist simply to fill the air.  The same could be said of this movie.

865343,AXGZIUUVTKWEK,B0006D3HGA,"A. Minutella ""mystery buff""","[3, 4]","I'm surprised at the negativity ""Cellular"" has received by other viewers: this is a highly enjoyable, intricately (yet plausibly) plotted, and very well acted spill-your-popcorn movie along the lines of ""Speed."" I won't rehash the plot; a lot of it relies on surprise and twists. Yes, the action gets cartoonish, even outlandish, but this is not meant to be Shakespeare, just a fast paced adventure and, taken in its context, is actually fairly clever (unlike so many mindless action pics nowadays, you can tell some thought actually went into the screenplay). As for Kim Basinger, don;t listen to what others say: she gives a solid, emotional performance; you genuinely see she wants to not only save herself but protect her family too. Chris Evans remains consistently engaging throughout, the perfect everyman suddenly thrust into a mind boggling situation. Jason Stratham gives a deliciously menacing turn as a villian, and William Macy provides some nice comic relief. Because both Basinger and Evans give such fine performances, we genuinely care for their characters, which makes the very last scene between the two of them all the more exhilarating.

865345,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0006D3HGA,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","`Cellular' is not a good movie.  Despite that fact it is entertaining to a degree and does provide a sliver of enjoyment.  Watching this movie the other night I was forced to realize that not everything entertaining is necessarily desirable.  I may never watch this movie again but that doesn't mean that for a few moments I wasn't excited at least a little.  `Cellular' has a few things going for it but it has so many detractors that you can't help but notice every flaw.  That's the clincher for this poorly devised action thriller.  It doesn't have enough going for it to offset the amount of wrongs here.  The plot is weak, the acting is horrible and the action scenes are tired and overdone.The plot revolves around woman who is kidnapped and locked in a dusty old room.  This man comes in and smashes the only telephone in the room with a sledgehammer (why didn't he just remove it civilly) and then goes on yelling about something (""give me what I want"").  Obviously frazzled this woman pieces the phone together so that she can contact the outside world (whatever) and happens to get connected to the arrogant Ryan.  Ryan doesn't believe her story at first but then overhears the kidnappers and is suddenly convinced.  He then sets off on a race against time to save this woman and her family.  Along the way a burnt out cop on the verge of retirement gets sucked into the case when Ryan frantically seeks his help only to get the brush off (in a scene that is so unrealistic it made my eyes do circles).The acting, as I mentioned, is atrocious.  Kim Basinger is utterly terrible as the kidnapped Jessica.  It just seems like amateur student acting.  I normally at least enjoy her acting somewhat.  She was flawless in `L.A. Confidential' and convincing in `8 Mile' but here she is a complete waste.  Another waste is Chris Evans.  I hate this kid; unfairly but I do.  It's funny, my wife is always talking about how she hates Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel because they are too pretty...that's how I feel about Chris Evans.  I hate him.  That, and he can't act to save his life.  His performance is comical.  He almost reaches Paul Walker levels here.  I won't rip on Jason Statham too much because you don't expect him to act, you just expect him to kick and punch and yell a lot and he does.  Acting is not his forte.  In fact the only redeemable acting point here is William H Macy who seems to have perfected being solid in mediocre films (why can't he get another `Fargo'?).  He also has like the best use of the F-word in a movie I've ever seen.`Cellular' tries to be high-octane and keep us at the edge of our seats but its lack of originality in action sequences can leave the audience a bit bored.  There is a lot going on but we've seen all of it done before.Like I said, there are moments of excitement and it is overall a tad entertaining, but it's not a good movie in the least.  There are plenty of action thrillers that succeed on a much higher level at entertaining and enthralling the audience that I can't think of any justification to bother with this movie at all.

865348,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0006D3HGA,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","At the moment this review was submitted, I was 24 minutes into a nerve-wracking crime film called CELLULAR (2004), a DVD I recently bought here at AMMY.The action in this one starts almost immediately. Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger), a HS science teacher, drops her 11-year-old son off at the school bus stop. She goes home and soon after, four thugs crash thru a door that's mostly window. Jessica's housekeeper is shot dead for trying to hit the alarm, and Martin's kidnapped. Brought to an unknown location and imprisoned in the attic, one of Jessica's captors, Jason Statham (as Ethan, the main bad guy) enters this makeshift cell with an axe. He smashes a wallphone that's behind terrifed Jessica, then leaves.Jessica fiddles with the wires of this wrecked phone and totally by chance reaches a young man named Ryan (Chris Evans) on his cellphone. At first Ryan doesn't believe her frantic story, but he's soon convinced and tried to help the victim. At the point I paused the film, Ryan had driven to the 11-year-old's school to try to find him before the kidnappers, who are using Jessica's SUV, can snatch the kid. His attempt fails. The crooks speed off with the child; Ryan follows in the school security guard's subcompact patrol car. During his pursuit on a crowded freeway and with Jessica listening over the phone, Ryan's forced off the road and into oncoming traffic. It's a very exciting sequence in a movie that promises a lot more action before the end credits.From what I've seen so far, I can definitely recommend CELLULAR. It's doubtful this one will leave you (or me) bored or sleepy.Also in the cast, Jessica Biel, Noah Emmerich (as an LAPD detective) and William H.

865352,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0006D3HGA,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Cellular is a pretty good but somewhat predictable action movie.  It's about a young man played by Chris Evans cruising the beaches and streets after trying to get back together with an old girlfriend, when suddenly he receives a call on his cell phone from a woman he's never met (played by Kim Basinger) claims she's been kidnapped and needs help.  So what happens then is that the young man soon realizes this is NOT a prank call and spends quite a bit of his time running around looking for help (24-style, remember that TV show?) and when nobody gives him the time of day or believes a single word he says, he goes looking for the kidnapped woman himself.  Enticing plot.Of course the young man does what's natural, and not only because he's young, arrogant and immature- he doesn't believe her.  He believes it's a prank call.  However, it's not.  Now what I noticed upon Kim making that phone call is that, her acting here is less than believable, so it's sort of unintentional that the young man wouldn't believe she's telling the truth based on her acting alone (and truthfully, her acting never really improves throughout the film either).It turns out dirty cops are responsible for the kidnapping, though the storyline pertaining to why they're doing it doesn't seem very fulfilling overall.  Other than the cops demanding that the young man hand over the evidence that pertains to their dirty doings, the viewer very well could miss the reason for Kim and her family being kidnapped since the movie never really elaborates on why it's happening.  It's mildly disappointing in that regard.Overall, there's honestly nothing special or out of the ordinary about Cellular other than it effectively satisfies that urge to see an action movie with lots of gun shootings, physical fights, etc.  Of course you frequently have to suspend disbelief because more often than not it turns into a highly exaggerated action flick.To name one example, when Chris Evans is asked by Kim Basinger to pick up her child (hilariously named Ricky Martin) from school before the kidnappers grab him, what are the odds Chris Evans would call out Ricky's name, the child would turn around and see him RIGHT before being forced into a car by the dirty cops?  Furthermore, the young man was acting very jittery and suspicious the entire time he was asking for the adminstrators office, and yet, the cop (or security guard) never seems to realize Chris might not be in any way related to the child which is reason for concern.  Also, was Chris Evans seriously hoping that he'd be able to get the kid into HIS car without the kid questioning he might be a kidnapper?  If the kid was aware what to do in case of a potential kidnapping, he'd have screamed his lungs off.  Minor complaints.  Then again... had these events occurred, the film probably would have turned even *more* predictable.Oh and of course, Kim Basinger's acting is severely questionable as I mention above.  Sometimes she exaggerates and over-shakes whenever the one dirty cop would enter the room she was thrown into, and the writing quite often is questionable in that, she's portrayed as an innocent and harmless woman who's scared out of her mind, and yet, she'd often find ways to elude the bad guys and find a way to safety or inflict exaggerated harm (such as escaping and smashing a vehicle in a barn to help her trapped child escape).  What?  Doesn't really seem remotely believable, but again, it's an action flick.  It's supposed to deliver unbelievable moments such as these to satisfy viewers.  Jason Statham is a really good actor and shows his skills quite convincingly as a dirty cop, and William H. Macy as the good cop offers a few spectacular moments as well.Overall, a pretty good way to pass 85 minutes.  It satisfies that urge to see a kidnapped family find a way to freedom.",4,make sure you don't miss that phone call,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,3847,"['Cellular', 'pretty', 'good', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'action', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'cruising', 'beaches', 'streets', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'suddenly', 'call', 'cell', 'phone', 'woman', 'never', 'met', 'played', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'help', 'So', 'what', 'then', 'young', 'man', 'soon', 'NOT', 'prank', 'call', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'running', 'around', 'looking', 'help', '24-style', 'remember', 'TV', 'show', 'when', 'nobody', 'time', 'day', 'single', 'word', 'looking', 'kidnapped', 'woman', 'Enticing', 'plot.Of', 'course', 'young', 'man', 'what', 'natural', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'arrogant', 'immature-', ""n't"", 'believe', 'prank', 'call', 'However', 'not', 'Now', 'what', 'noticed', 'Kim', 'making', 'phone', 'call', 'acting', 'here', 'less', 'believable', 'sort', 'unintentional', 'young', 'man', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'telling', 'truth', 'based', 'acting', 'alone', 'truthfully', 'acting', 'never', 'really', 'film', '.It', 'out', 'dirty', 'cops', 'are', 'responsible', 'kidnapping', 'storyline', 'pertaining', 'why', ""'re"", 'doing', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'fulfilling', 'overall', 'Other', 'cops', 'demanding', 'young', 'man', 'hand', 'evidence', 'dirty', 'doings', 'viewer', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'miss', 'reason', 'Kim', 'family', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'why', 'happening', 'mildly', 'disappointing', 'regard.Overall', 'honestly', 'nothing', 'special', 'ordinary', 'Cellular', 'other', 'effectively', 'urge', 'see', 'action', 'movie', 'lots', 'gun', 'shootings', 'physical', 'fights', 'etc', 'course', 'frequently', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'highly', 'exaggerated', 'action', 'flick.To', 'name', 'one', 'example', 'when', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'asked', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'pick', 'up', 'child', 'hilariously', 'named', 'Ricky', 'Martin', 'school', 'kidnappers', 'grab', 'what', 'are', 'odds', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'would', 'call', 'out', 'Ricky', 'name', 'child', 'would', 'turn', 'around', 'see', 'RIGHT', 'being', 'forced', 'car', 'dirty', 'cops', 'Furthermore', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'acting', 'very', 'jittery', 'suspicious', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'asking', 'adminstrators', 'office', 'yet', 'cop', 'security', 'guard', 'never', 'realize', 'Chris', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'way', 'related', 'child', 'reason', 'concern', 'Also', 'was', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'seriously', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'kid', 'HIS', 'car', 'kid', 'questioning', 'might', 'be', 'kidnapper', 'kid', 'was', 'aware', 'what', 'do', 'case', 'potential', 'kidnapping', ""'d"", 'have', 'screamed', 'lungs', 'off', 'Minor', 'complaints', 'Then', 'again', 'had', 'events', 'occurred', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'even', '*more*', 'predictable.Oh', 'course', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'acting', 'severely', 'questionable', 'mention', 'Sometimes', 'over-shakes', 'whenever', 'one', 'dirty', 'cop', 'would', 'enter', 'room', 'was', 'thrown', 'writing', 'quite', 'often', 'questionable', 'portrayed', 'innocent', 'harmless', 'woman', 'who', 'scared', 'mind', 'yet', ""'d"", 'often', 'find', 'ways', 'elude', 'bad', 'guys', 'find', 'way', 'safety', 'inflict', 'exaggerated', 'harm', 'such', 'escaping', 'smashing', 'vehicle', 'barn', 'help', 'trapped', 'child', 'escape', 'What', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'remotely', 'believable', 'again', 'action', 'flick', 'supposed', 'deliver', 'unbelievable', 'moments', 'such', 'satisfy', 'viewers', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'skills', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'dirty', 'cop', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'good', 'cop', 'few', 'spectacular', 'moments', 'well.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'way', 'pass', '85', 'minutes', 'urge', 'see', 'kidnapped', 'family', 'find', 'way', 'freedom']",N/A
865353,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0006D3HGA,Benjamin,"[4, 6]","""Cellular"" is a really fun thriller whose entire plot is generated through a mobile phone. The phone is such an important, dare I call it this, character that it gets title billing, and I'm amazed its brand name wasn't listed alongside the rest of the cast, which includes Kim Basinger, Jason Statham, William H. Macy and Chris Evans.The terrific Evans, a young actor whose largest claim to fame at this point is probably his role ""Jock With Whipped-Cream Nipples"" in ""Not Another Teen Movie, is the everyman hero of the film. His call-to-action is a literal call to his new fully-equipped cell phone.The person making the call is Jessica Martin, a science teacher who's been abducted and trapped in an attic that has a smashed phone in it. She doesn't know where she is or why she's been abducted, but she is able to make a random, local call out of the room by piecing together the wires of the smashed phone.From that gimmick, the director and writers have crafted a pretty effective, reasonable thriller that manages to surprise and involve the audience while also finding out the dramatic potential in every single possible thing that could happen to a cell phone.I've not seen a thriller like this one since ""Panic Room."" Though ""Panic Room"" was a better movie, both films benefit from allowing its characters to behave reasonably within their parameters. Nobody does anything that seems at all illogical, and the cell phone-based twists and the plot device that the captors are looking for keep the movie lively and interesting.And, of course, the ending showdown fight between two really unlikely actors is genuinely entertaining, the sort of movie scene you'd never expect to see - considering the actors involved.""Cellular"" is a pretty good thriller.

Basinger manages to place a random outside call, contacting the cell phone of a young man named Ryan (Evans). Once she convinces him that she is, indeed, in danger, Ryan goes out to find help, only to find himself in over his head as he races to rescue Jessica's young son and husband from the kidnappers, and try to unravel the reasons she was abducted in the first place.The movie does require a degree of suspension of disbelief - that Jessica could tap into the phone lines and contact a random person decent enough to help and close enough to actually do something about it. Guess she wasn't wired for long distance. But once you get past that, it's really an enjoyable thriller. Since her life depends on maintaining contact with Ryan, mundane things like a bad signal or a phone battery running low suddenly become genuinely suspenseful.

He gradually becomes more and more concerned with her and her family to the point he will risk his life for them. He has to steal things in order to keep her on the line and try to find her.

Anyway, here's the rundown of the movie and my opinion of it.Kim Brassinger (Jessica Martin) who teaches at the same school her son attends school. She comes out and before she could blink an eye, she was kidnapped and locked up in some attic. Of course, the suspects destroyed the phone so she couldn't make a phone call. Obviously, the son was their next victim. In the next few scenes we get to see Ryan who is lazy, irresponisble, and self-centered who just got dumped by his ex-girlfriend and trys to suck up to get the relationship started back up again. Luckily, Jessica does wire the phone back together and somehow ends up getting Ryan who doesn't believe that she is really kidnapped until he does go to the police station and hear the suspects torturing her. This is where a soon to be retired police officer gets involved in the situation as he tells ryan to go the 4th floor to handle the Jessica's call but some dirty cops who are in the mix of the situation find a way to stop the call from reaching it's destination. Ryan must now try to stop the boy from being kidnapped but was a second too late. Now he ends up stealing cars and cutting lines at phone store to get an extender to keep his cell phone from disabling the call. He tries to prevent the husband (real estater) from be the next victim but again was a split second too late. During the movie, we discover why this family is being kidnapped as the husband had footage of some more evil acts performed by the dirty cops and his sidekicks. The soon to be retired cop is starting to catch on the case as he visits the Martin household and discovers that noone in the family is at the house, so he suspects that Jessica could be in some trouble. Progressing on, the kidnappers take the husband to a bank to capture the tapes but Ryan was able to intercept them and make a deal to meet them at Venice Beach (The movie was in California)with the family intact and unharmed. The cop I mentioned showed up as well.

It's not the greatest movie in the world but it is a lot of fun to watch. Now the reason I'm giving this a 3 and not a 4 is because of one detail. Kim Basinger's horrid acting, she can't do dramatic if she was held at gun point.The film techniques used were extraordinary. The shot of William H. Macy in the Boathouse where the camera revolves around him is one of my favorites. Then during the car sequences where he speeds around town looking for Kim Basingers son, or the cell charger, or when he car jacks the lawyer are just well done.The film is basically about this woman who is kidnapped by five strangers. Thats all I can tell you now, but the plot development is so wonderful that you wont be left behind. The twist I thought was wonderful, it was not streching it and it wasn't leaving it dull. It was just right.I think it would've been funnier if Keanu Reeves played Chris Evans part, and you had Gene Hackman as William H. Macy's character. Glenn Close as Kim Basingers part.

Consider Celluar (2004) and Phone Booth (2003).  In Cellular the main character played by Kim Basinger has been kidnapped and manages to make a random phone call with a broken landline phone--her life depends on getting help by staying on the phone.  She manages to call someone on his cell phone--that's why the movie is called Cellular.  In Phone Booth the main character played by Collin Farrell has been trapped in a phone booth by a psycho sniper who will shoot him if he leaves the phone booth--his life depends on placating the would-be killer by staying on the phone.  Neither of these phone-thriller films are great, but I liked Cellular better.While Cellular's plot is more involved and more interesting the Phone Booth's plot, Cellular's script seriously needed another re-write before they filmed it.  Kim Basinger's character calls some twenty-something doofus on the phone.  Too much of this short film focuses on the doofus and his buddy hanging out on the beach and checking out women.  Is this supposed to be character development?  Are we supposed to be impressed by his transformation from doofus to good Samaritan?  All I got out of these scenes is that the doofus is shallow and likes to check out scantily-clad women on the beach.  Then for the climatic finale, the script writers seem to have forgotten about the Kim Basinger character and focus almost exclusively on the doofus and the cop played by William H. Macy.  Considering that the whole story revolves around the bravery and ingenuity of the Kim Basinger character in figuring out how to use the broken phone pieces to place a call while being frequently threatened by terrible bad guys, why does she basically become a helpless damsel in distress in the last act?  This was a disappointing development in the film.  Despite these complaints, the story is fairly engaging.Cellular includes a documentary on the story that inspired the movie.  This story has nothing to do with anyone being stuck on the phone, but rather the plot twist which makes the film a lot more interesting than just a story about someone making a phone call to get help.  The documentary feels like some slapped-together DVD feature (which it is), but the tale it tells is very compelling--in fact, more compelling than the film Cellular.  The whole time I was watching the documentary, I kept wondering why the film makers didn't make the film more faithful to their source material.This isn't a great film, but it is reasonably entertaining.  If you are in the mood for a thriller from a few years ago revolving around the idea of making phone calls while in peril, Cellular is a better choice than Phone Booth.",3,Another Phone Thriller,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2840,"['reason', 'Hollywood', 'making', 'films', 'pairs', 'someone', 'good', 'idea', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'someone', 'else', 'same', 'good', 'idea', 'movie', 'Consider', 'Celluar', '2004', 'Phone', 'Booth', '2003', 'Cellular', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'make', 'random', 'phone', 'call', 'broken', 'landline', 'phone', 'life', 'getting', 'help', 'staying', 'phone', 'call', 'someone', 'cell', 'phone', 'why', 'movie', 'called', 'Cellular', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'been', 'trapped', 'phone', 'booth', 'psycho', 'sniper', 'who', 'will', 'shoot', 'phone', 'life', 'placating', 'would-be', 'killer', 'staying', 'phone', 'phone-thriller', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'liked', 'Cellular', 'Cellular', 'plot', 'more', 'involved', 'more', 'interesting', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'plot', 'Cellular', 'script', 'seriously', 'needed', 're-write', 'filmed', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'character', 'twenty-something', 'doofus', 'phone', 'Too', 'much', 'short', 'film', 'focuses', 'doofus', 'buddy', 'hanging', 'out', 'beach', 'checking', 'out', 'women', 'supposed', 'be', 'character', 'development', 'Are', 'supposed', 'be', 'impressed', 'transformation', 'doofus', 'good', 'Samaritan', 'got', 'out', 'scenes', 'doofus', 'shallow', 'likes', 'check', 'out', 'scantily-clad', 'women', 'beach', 'Then', 'climatic', 'finale', 'script', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'character', 'focus', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'doofus', 'cop', 'played', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Considering', 'whole', 'story', 'revolves', 'bravery', 'ingenuity', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'character', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'use', 'broken', 'phone', 'pieces', 'place', 'call', 'being', 'frequently', 'threatened', 'terrible', 'bad', 'guys', 'why', 'basically', 'become', 'helpless', 'damsel', 'distress', 'last', 'act', 'was', 'disappointing', 'development', 'film', 'complaints', 'story', 'fairly', 'engaging.Cellular', 'documentary', 'story', 'inspired', 'movie', 'story', 'nothing', 'do', 'anyone', 'being', 'stuck', 'phone', 'rather', 'plot', 'twist', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'just', 'story', 'someone', 'making', 'phone', 'call', 'get', 'help', 'documentary', 'feels', 'slapped-together', 'DVD', 'feature', 'tale', 'very', 'compelling', 'fact', 'more', 'compelling', 'film', 'Cellular', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'documentary', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'film', 'makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'more', 'faithful', 'source', 'material.This', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'are', 'mood', 'thriller', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'revolving', 'idea', 'making', 'phone', 'calls', 'peril', 'Cellular', 'better', 'choice', 'Phone', 'Booth']",N/A

865380,A3ORWAR4CAOPAC,B0006D3HGA,DRob,"[0, 1]","If the movies Speed and Phone Booth had a baby, Cellular would be the offspring, and that's not a bad thing. From the moment sloucher Ryan (Chris Evans) answers his cell phone and hears a strange woman (Kim Basinger) on the other end of the line, the action flows fast and furious.Basinger plays the part of Jessica Martin, a science teacher who lives in Brentwood with her young son and her realtor husband. Her day starts off normally enogh as she puts her little boy on the bus to school and returns to her house. Then a strange man breaks through the glass on her backdoor, kills the maid, and drags a kicking and screaming Basinger out the door. He takes her to an unknown location and locks her in an attic.Basinger kicks and screams a lot in this movie, but she is also very resourceful. She manages to connect two wires on a broken phone and dials a random number, which just happens to belong to Ryan, who is on his way to Office Depot to pick up several boxes of t-shirts in an effort to prove to his ex-girlfriend that he has turned over a new leaf and has changed his slacker ways.Once Jessica convinces Ryan that she is not a prank call, he forgets the t-shirts and throws himself wholeheartedly into trying to save the life of Jessica, her son and husband. The result is an exciting ride full of twists and turns- an unctious lawyer, an officious school security guard, and a bored police officer who is counting the days to his retirement when he and his girfriend can open their own day spa (one of William H. Macy's usual good performances.)Just when it looks as though Ryan and Jessica are going to lose contact-- Ryan's battery runs low, he nearly loses the signal in a stairwell, he drops the cell phone from the roof of a tall building, Ryan comes up with a way to keep the contact going so he can continue to try to find where Jessica is being held.The movie does require you to suspend belief as all kinds of improbably things happen and various obstacles are set up to prevent Ryan from just finding a cop and turning the cell phone, and Jessica, over to the police. However, if you just sit back and accept its premise, you are in for a wonderfully wild ride.If you liked Speed and Phone Booth, then you will probably enjoy this movie. It won't leave a lasting imprint in your mind; after a few weeks (days?) it will fade into the background along with all of the other action flicks you've seen, but during the time you are watching it, you will have a great time.",5,When a Stranger Calls on the Cellphone...,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2490,"['movies', 'Speed', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'had', 'baby', 'Cellular', 'would', 'be', 'offspring', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'moment', 'sloucher', 'Ryan', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'cell', 'phone', 'strange', 'woman', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'other', 'end', 'line', 'action', 'fast', 'furious.Basinger', 'plays', 'part', 'Jessica', 'Martin', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'Brentwood', 'young', 'son', 'realtor', 'husband', 'day', 'normally', 'enogh', 'little', 'boy', 'bus', 'school', 'returns', 'house', 'Then', 'strange', 'man', 'breaks', 'glass', 'backdoor', 'maid', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'Basinger', 'door', 'unknown', 'location', 'attic.Basinger', 'kicks', 'lot', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'resourceful', 'connect', 'two', 'wires', 'broken', 'phone', 'dials', 'random', 'number', 'just', 'belong', 'Ryan', 'who', 'way', 'Office', 'Depot', 'pick', 'up', 'several', 'boxes', 't-shirts', 'effort', 'prove', 'ex-girlfriend', 'turned', 'over', 'new', 'leaf', 'changed', 'slacker', 'ways.Once', 'Jessica', 'Ryan', 'not', 'prank', 'call', 't-shirts', 'wholeheartedly', 'trying', 'save', 'life', 'Jessica', 'son', 'husband', 'result', 'exciting', 'ride', 'full', 'twists', 'turns-', 'unctious', 'lawyer', 'officious', 'school', 'security', 'guard', 'bored', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'counting', 'days', 'retirement', 'when', 'girfriend', 'can', 'open', 'own', 'day', 'spa', 'one', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'usual', 'good', 'performances', 'Just', 'when', 'Ryan', 'Jessica', 'are', 'going', 'lose', 'contact', 'Ryan', 'battery', 'low', 'nearly', 'signal', 'stairwell', 'cell', 'phone', 'roof', 'tall', 'building', 'Ryan', 'up', 'way', 'keep', 'contact', 'going', 'can', 'continue', 'try', 'find', 'where', 'Jessica', 'being', 'held.The', 'movie', 'require', 'suspend', 'belief', 'kinds', 'improbably', 'things', 'happen', 'various', 'obstacles', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'prevent', 'Ryan', 'just', 'finding', 'cop', 'turning', 'cell', 'phone', 'Jessica', 'police', 'However', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'accept', 'premise', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'wild', 'ride.If', 'liked', 'Speed', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lasting', 'imprint', 'mind', 'few', 'weeks', 'days', 'will', 'fade', 'background', 'other', 'action', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'are', 'watching', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'time']",N/A

Of course, i wanted to see it and it was high on my list but after reading many reviews that said it was not all that great and it was a silly action romp, my expectations were low. Fortunately, just after Kim Bassinger is kidnapped withing the first 5 minutes of the film, the tension mounts and hardly lets up. Even as things are sort of mellow (when introduced to Ryan just after the kidnapping, you can't get the womans peril out of your head) the tension still lingers. The instant Ryan gets the call... you can tell the chain reaction is not going to be pretty. Coincidentally, in movies like this, nothing is ever easy and goes according to plan... and Cellular is no exception to that rule. What makes this film interesting is that Ryan is never in any real danger but everything he does will have detrimental consequences. When it comes to a point where everything is just bad and going downhill fast, Ryan puts himself in danger doing something that some of the bad guys should spend more time doing. And from there, the movie spins into a whirlwind of over the top action fun. The final conflict is intense and when it comes to a moment of survive or be killed, certain characters manage to hold their own quite seriously. In one pivotal scene, Kim Bassinger uses her knowledge of human anatomy to set into motion a chain of events that are frighteningly intense and action packed. You could see her emotion as she tells her son that she is going to take him home. Honsetly, this woman is a real good actress. Ryan (played by Chris Evans) is a funny guy who should not be taken seriously, but once he gets into the moment, you have no choice but to. The role is refreshing and fun and you can tell that the young star had fun playing him. This is a good movie... full of action, suspense and drama. There is even a bit of humor involved... which seems to be a common factor in action films. Look for a couple cameos as well... one being highly humerous involving loud boom boom music.

What impresses me so much about this film is that I hadn't. Writer Chris Morgan takes the concept of a man on a phone call that he cannot hang up, and moves it in every direction imaginable and some that I didn't see coming. The script is neatly put together, and although it is unlikely to go down as one of the greatest action movies of all time, it is funny, smart and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next, right to the end.As a side note, people who are thinking of watching this film because of Jason Statham (whose picture features prominently on the DVD cover), should be aware that Statham's role is relatively minor. This is Chris Evans's film, not Jason Statham's.

865394,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006D3HGA,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","CELLULAR is one of the best action movies of the past few years.  Written by the creator of 'Phone Booth' Larry Cohen, this gripping thriller steps outside the phone booth and into the cyberspace of cellular telephones and in doing so replaces the claustrophobia of 'Phone Booth' with the cosmic angst of the individual connected to the outer world by the nebulously mysterious ether of wireless communication.  Cohen's inventive story has been adapted for the screen by Chris Morgan who finesses Cohen's tale  to a nonstop breathless action blitz.  Under the astute direction of action specialist David R. Ellis, this film starts with a moment of repose and then drives into action with a force that is spellbindingly 'vivace'.Science teacher Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger, in one of her most well developed characters on film) casually walks her young son to the school bus and then returns home to an abrupt crash entry by some thugs headed by Ethan (Jason Statham, here as evil personified) who kidnap her and lock her in an attic of a strange old home, carefully destroying the wall mounted telephone.  The thugs are after Jessica's husband for reasons unknown to her.  Left to her own devices, she manages to use her scientific knowledge to piece together the parts of the broken phone and pow! she makes connection to the cell phone owned by a seeming loafer of a young surfer Ryan (Chris Evans, in a career turning performance) strolling Santa Monica boardwalk.After some exchange,  Jessica convinces Ryan that she is a hostage, talks him into protecting her son at his school, and the chase is on.  Ryan turns from a laissez-faire surfer into a committed helper to a woman in need and the tension that builds between these two actors, whose only connection is vocal thru a cell phone, is razor sharp.As a side bar, a retiring disillusioned cop Mooney (William H. Macy, just as superb as always) is serendipitously drawn back into his profession when it becomes clear that the reason for the kidnapping is that Jessica's husband has a video that captured some rotten dealings by some bad cops (Ethan being one of them), cops with whom Mooney has worked and whose drive to capture returns Mooney's origins as a good cop. The chase for the tape includes some of the best action stunts on film.  The manner in which the story resolves is exciting and if predictable, still thrilling.As if this truly fine film weren't enough, the DVD adds some of the most interesting featurettes I've seen.  There is an extended discussion about the history of the telephone  from its humble beginnings to its present state and the philosophy of the current effect of cell phones on our lives is staggering. There is also a fine short on the making of the film that really enhances your appreciation for the people involved in this craft. And finally, there is a documentary about the Rampart Police scandal that is parallel to the bad cop aspect of this film.  Very enlightening and well produced. So for every reason, this DVD of CELLULAR is important and serves the widest audience possible.

865396,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0006D3HGA,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","As someone who considers his cell phone to be as indispensable as trousers, CELLULAR resonates with me. Plus, I happen to work in Santa Monica and I've also harbored a longtime crush on Kim Basinger (I write this as I sigh and make googly eyes at the moon). So I'm definitely what one might call a target audience. But I think quite a few of us are, yes? Who doesn't have a cell phone nowadays, with all the things it can do? If you don't have one, this movie may persuade you to come across. Or not. CELLULAR also does a good job of going over some of the hassles attached to owning a cellular, possibly only omitting the part where you incur carpal tunnel from overtexting. Many old hands are of course already down, but those few still in the dark and restricted to those rotary dially thingees from the Stone Age (*cough* someofmyolderrelatives) will marvel at the cellular as a multi-functional device.CELLULAR's plot flaunts a gimmicky premise, but I think it's an irresistible one and holds up for the entire hour and a half. One telling question is presented: Just how far would you go to help out a total stranger? Kim Basinger (still hot) plays Jessica Martin, a high school science teacher who is kidnapped for some nebulous reason. Locked up in the attic of an isolated farmhouse, she's able to piece together enough of a shattered landline telephone to place a frenzied random call. The unwitting recipient is a young, flighty twenty-something named Ryan (Chris Evans), motoring on the L.A. freeway, and, at first, it's not a sure thing that he'll take her seriously (he even puts her on hold). But something in Jessica's desperate tone erodes Ryan's skepticism and, soon, he's skedaddling all over L.A. on her behalf, racing against time (I call these scenes Ryan's ""roaming minutes""). Who woulda thunk that this airheaded beefcake had it in him to do the right thing?I've seen CELLULAR quite a few times now; I've even watched the crapolla Bollywood version (called SPEED). But this original version is plenty riveting, with its breakneck pace lending a sense of immediacy. The story takes place in one sunny Cali day, and just about in real time. Much of the tension lies in that Jessica's sole and tenuous contact with the outside world (and the one best chance of rescue) is the continuing phone line to Ryan. The writers must've have spent time and then some, scribbling down the many ways a cell phone can function and go wrong. Ryan not only attempts to rescue Jessica's young son (who's targeted for abduction) and then her husband (whom the villains are frantically seeking), but Ryan also caroms from one cellular crisis to another. Battery running low, bad reception, dropped calls... The film demonstrates a playful tone with these scenes, as each dilemma unfolds and the audience commiserates. I know I've dreaded driving into a tunnel whilst in celly dialogue, altlhough I've not yet been compelled to resort to Ryan's actions to obtain a new phone charger. But maybe if Kim Basinger rings me up, all desperate and kidnapped...Because the narrative construction dictates that focus is more on plot than characterization, most of the characters are written with broad strokes, although I think the actors are skillful enough that they do register with the audience. Chris Evans does unexpectedly well as the undependable slacker become reluctant good samaritan. Kim Basinger milks her damsel-in-distress part for all it's worth, and she's fairly convincing and all quivery-lipped. Evans and Basinger, in particular, have the harder task, what with mostly interacting with a phone, so credit to them for credible make-believe. Jason Statham glowers unwholesomely and proves that he's quite menacing as a villain. The only role which is truly fleshed out is William H. Macy's Officer Mooney, a quirky near-retired desk cop who's in over his head (or is he?). It's always interesting, watching Macy; the guy consistently elevates whatever picture he's in. Lastly, the so very jeerable Rick Hoffman has an awesome cameo as an unbelievably boorish lawyer. Perhaps two of the film's most gratifying moments happen when his Porsche is stolen... and then stolen again.Yes, set in sunny Cali, and partly on the Santa Monica Pier, so plenty of sun-drenched bikinis adorning lovely beach worshippers. ""There's a lot of babe-ocity up there."" (to quote William H. Macy in the bonus featurette). Jessica Biel has a tiny supporting role, so that's a bit of okay. CELLULAR also offers plenty of loud but sometimes thrilling chases, on car and on foot, and of shootouts and rescue attempts (some of which fail), and some clever uses of the cell phone. There's even a twist or two. The characters may be cardboard (excepting Macy's) but the protagonists are very likeable, and the outrageousness of the situations are salvaged by the characters' movitations and actions, which I think are believable and hold true to the film's internal logic.Special features on the dvd include: the laid back audio commentary by Director David Ellis, his daughter Tawny (co-producer), and sister Annie (Asst. Stunt Coordinator); 5 deleted/alternate scenes with optional audio commentary (including more of Ryan's surfer bud Chad and an alternate ending with Ryan's ex-girl Chloe (Jessica Biel); three featurettes: ""Calling Out"" - the history & science of the cell phone (19 minutes); ""Dialing Up CELLULAR"" - the Making Of segment (26 minutes); and ""Code of Silence: Inside the Rampart Scandal"" - a documentary about the 1999 police corruption scandal which rocked the LAPD (27 minutes); and the theatrical trailer.If you're like some of my relatives and are technologically challenged, or if you've just purchased a cell phone and feel a bit overwhelmed with all those crazy buttons, it wouldn't hurt to sit and watch this movie. It's a bit like a tutorial. Although, with the cellular advances they've made in recent years, there's probably a need for a CELLULAR 2.",4,...deserves a good reception...,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,5960,"['someone', 'who',

The movie is about a science teacher named Jessica Martin who is kidnapped. She is placed in an abandoned house where she reassembles enough of a shattered pay phone to call someone. She randomly calls and reaches a young man, whom she pleads his help. He first thinks that it's a scam and a prank call, but soon he realizes that this is very serious. For the whole movie, you wonder why was she kidnapped which is nicely explained later on. The movie has some tense and thrilling moments and some great comic moments notably when the young man holds up a phone store to get a charger, which he pays for! Funny stuff!

But a ringing phone must be answered.""Those words were Kiefer Sutherland's closing lines inPhone Booth [Blu-ray] and they could easily be the last words in Cellular, too. It's interesting that the script comes from the writer of Phone Booth (that would be Larry Cohen, the brains behindManiac CopandThe Stuff), a movie about a man trapped in one tiny place on the phone to a complete stranger and yet Cellular is about a man trapped on the phone to a complete stranger who is free to go anywhere he wants.Only Cellular is a more satisfying and complete film than Phone Booth. It doesn't make any attempt at satire, or make fun of the media, but does have terrific energy and intelligence. No, Cellular is NOT a no-brainer.Ryan, played by Chris Evans (no, not the ginger, speccy nerd from British TV), is a punk kid who never takes anything seriously and is far too laid back to keep his girlfriend happy. But his life crosses paths with a woman in trouble. Will he finally grow up when her fate becomes his responsibility? Kim Basinger (aging more gracefully than I previously assumed) is that woman. She's being held in a spooky old attic by corrupt cop Jason Statham and painstakingly ""repairs"" a broken phone. She's about to reach out to somebody, anybody. The only number she manages to hook up to is Ryan's.He immediately takes the problem to the fuzz. The only cop who will listen is Mooney (William H Macy), but he's too fed up and dismissive to take much notice. Not at first, anyway. As Ryan races around the city, overcoming difficult and dangerous obstacles, Mooney puts it all together and slowly realizes things ain't what they seem.I had only ever seen Evans in the rather dull Perfect Score before this movie, but he made for a totally cool hero that everyone can relate to. Most actors his age irritate the hell out of me. I can only imagine how bad this film would have been with Seann William Scott, or Shai LeBeouf.Basinger does everything she can with her damsel in distress. It's usually quite insulting to an actress's intelligence to reduce her to such a clich&eacute;, though she manages to bring integrity and desperation to the role more convincingly than most actresses her age.And of course we all love and adore Jason Statham. He may be a skinhead with a funny sounding voice, but be it hero or villain he's dead cool and makes Vin 'Donald Duck' Diesel look real lame despite being nothing more than a low-rent Bruce Willis himself.Director David Ellis races through the far-fetched plot without looking back and keeps everything fast-paced and exciting right up to the last minute. He's the man who made a good sequel out of a bad original (that would be Final Destination) and with many other directors the ludicrousness of the plot would be all too apparent. Here, we don't get a single breath to take it all in.The show-stealing is split two ways. Macy is great as the Ned Flanders-type cop, but Rick Hoffmann is hilarious as an obnoxious lawyer who stands in Ryan's way and gets his comeuppance not once, not twice, but thrice.There's not been a kidnapping thriller as gripping as this since Kurt Russell lost his wife inBreakdown.

She fixes a broken phone where she is heald captive and gets the hold of a cell of a complete stranger (Chris Evans). He thinks it's a prank at first but becomes convinced it's for real and decides to help her out. Along the way he has to worry about his battery dieing on his cell or going under a tunnel. If he loses the connection she won't be able to call him again and..he's her only hope as she dramatically tells him.The movie is fun and well written. It finds many ways to be creative and thows many obstacles at the hero. It's also funny in some scenes. Like when the killers are looking for Chris Evans and one says ""he's the one with a cell"" and the other replies ""everyone is on a cell"" and you see a big crowd of people talking on their cells. I found that funny because it's certainly not far from the truth. It's like people can't live without cell phones these days and are almost on them 24/7. Plus Kim Basinger's horrible performance makes it also funny to me. She talks like she lost her voice and is always crying. I found the funniest part to be when she goes to make her getaway. She cuts a bad guy and talks about being a biology teacher and how she cut a major artery and in a crying hysterical voice says...""I'm I'm sorry"" and runs away. So if anything is bad about this movie it's her performance by a longshot. I think her performance is still entertaining though and it didn't ruin the movie for me. Also William H.

CELLULAR has me thinking that perhaps life is passing me by.Jessica Martin (Kim Bassinger) lives the good life in the SoCal suburb of Brentwood - you know, where OJ lived - with her realtor husband Craig (Richard Burgi) and 11-year old son Ricky (Adam Taylor Gordon). One day, after waving Ricky off on the school bus, Jessica's home is invaded by three thugs led by Greer (Jason Statham). After shooting the housekeeper - perhaps one of the shortest bit parts in history, the intruders carry Martin off to a house in the hills (with a million $ view of the San Fernando Valley), where she's locked in the attic with a smashed phone until Craig hands over an item about which she knows nothing. Being a high school science teacher, Jessica coaxes the phone back to life and dials out by touching two wires together. Calling blindly, she manages to reach the young and irresponsible Ryan (Chris Evans) cruising the coast down by Venice Beach. After much tearful pleading, Martin convinces Ryan that her plight is real, and this launches the latter off on a day-long odyssey of chases and violence as he tries to rescue Jessica and her soon-to-be-abducted son, all the while maintaining that tenuous phone connection to the near-hysterical woman. Obviously, Ryan has never heard the old adage, ""No good deed goes unpunished.""CELLULAR has everything necessary for a vicarious, nail-biting thrill ride at the movies. There's the truly vicious villain (Greer), the gorgeous damsel in distress (Jessica), and the completely engaging knight-errant (Ryan), all perfectly played by their respective actors in an ingenious plot. Then there's the delicious supporting role of William H. Macy as Mooney, the police desk sergeant who reluctantly gets involved in the mayhem when all he really wants is to retire and run a day spa with his girlfriend. And to top it off, the film's creators bedevil Ryan with those little daily annoyances that the viewers will personally know so well: a patronizing sales clerk, having to ""take a number"" in a crowded store, an obnoxious lawyer, bad cellular reception in tunnels and stairwells, an officious security guard, a driver in the next car playing the stereo too loud, slowpokes in the fast lane, and street delays caused by inopportune construction.CELLULAR isn't one of the year's greatest cinematic achievements, but, for pure entertainment value and fun, it rates 5 stars if you're not too discriminating and willing to overlook a few credibility gaps.

It got mixed reviews from critics (Ebert & Roeper loved it). I however (and a LOT of people will not agree with me) thought it was the third best film of 2004. I thought it was an extremely entertaining movie, the acting was good, it was funny, it had every genre combined into one. It was a great movie. I originally saw it in the theatre and when it came out on DVD, I rented it and it is still a spectacular movie. The movie stars Kim Basinger as Jessica Martin.Jessica is a teacher who sends her child off to school goes back into her house (if her kid is going to school,why isn't she). 5 men break into her house, shoot her housekeeper, and take her to a house and lock her in the attic. They shatter the phone and she begins clicking wires together and ends up calling Ryan (Chris Evans). Ryan doesn't believe her at first,however. Then after hearing her kidnapper threaten her and such he begins too. Jessica tells Ryan that they may be going after her son and husband, at which point he begins to rush and try to save this family he doesn't know. William H.Macy stars as Mooney, a police officer who's about to retire. Macy utters some of the funniest lines in the film. But one minor character I have to point out is the lawyer. The lawyer (I don't know the character or actors name) gets his car stolen by Ryan, and he is funny. One part I want to point out is a scene where he is talking to a lady in at an impound to get his car back:Impound Lady:Do you want your car back.Lawyer: Let me think about that for a second....Yes. But i'm not gonna pay for it.Impound Lawyer: Fine. TAKE IT OUT BACK!Lawyer: No! Wait. OK, fine. I'll pay for it. Who do I make it out too, Lady Who Sucks?The guy is very funny.

Cellular resembles that superior 1993 thriller right down to the same locations. (If I see one more shootout on that damn pier.) Cellular however is strangely mixed with a collection of those only in Los Angeles crackpots similar to those found in everything from Volcano to Out in Fifty.The resulting mismatch of tones is one part thriller (Kim Basinger trapped in an attic) one part Speed (Chris Evans driving around L.A.) and one part Randy Newman video.Credibility (usually important to a thriller) is thrown out early with great force. Kim Basinger shows her kid of to a private Los Angeles Academy (she is a science teacher but surprisingly not at work herself); walks back to her Brentwood home (I'm guessing 2.5 million); greets her live in maid and is then quickly and violently kidnapped.The kidnappers then drive off with Basinger in her own Porsche minivan. So what is the first thing she says to our hero Chris Evans ?""I don't know why they kidnapped me. We aren't rich. I'm just a school teacher?"" Uh-huh.Well needless to say Sigourney Weaver's upper west side apartment in Ghostbusters had more credibility. The ""it"" the kidnappers are after is even sillier. Without giving too much away one wonders why the husband didn't turn ""it"" into the nearest TV station.The villains themselves are right out of a rejected script for the Shield. The movie has enough action to be entertaining for stretches and Kim Basinger does do a commendable job with a strangely written role. (Besides her I'm not rich howler she is also saddled with a monologue, right out of the talking killer handbook, where instead of running away after stabbing a man she explains at some length how as a science teacher she knew exactly which artery to cut.)Lackluster villains, a constantly changing tone, and contrived credibility sink the film at the end however. Sadly if my High School teacher looked like Kim Basinger and the curriculum consisted of how to steal phone service and stab people (not to mention live like a millionaire on a teachers salary) I probably would have ended up at MIT rather than some party school named after a drugstore.",3,Out of Area Roaming Charges Apply,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,2201,"['Cellular', '5', '10', ""'m"", 'having', 'Falling', 'Down', 'flashbacks', 'again', 'Cellular', 'resembles', 'superior', '1993', 'thriller', 'right', 'down', 'same', 'locations', 'see', 'one', 'more', 'shootout', 'damn', 'pier', 'Cellular', 'however', 'strangely', 'mixed', 'collection', 'only', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'crackpots', 'similar', 'found', 'everything', 'Volcano', 'Out', 'Fifty.The', 'resulting', 'mismatch', 'tones', 'one', 'part', 'thriller', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'trapped', 'attic', 'one', 'part', 'Speed', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'driving', 'around', 'L.A.', 'one', 'part', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'video.Credibility', 'usually', 'important', 'thriller', 'thrown', 'out', 'early', 'great', 'force', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'kid', 'private', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Academy', 'science', 'teacher', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'work', 'back', 'Brentwood', 'home', ""'m"", 'guessing', '2.5', 'million', 'live', 'maid', 'then', 'quickly', 'violently', 'kidnappers', 'then', 'drive', 'off', 'Basinger', 'own', 'Porsche', 'minivan', 'what', 'first', 'thing', 'hero', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'kidnapped', 'are', ""n't"", 'rich', ""'m"", 'just', 'school', 'teacher', 'Uh-huh.Well', 'needless', 'say', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'upper', 'west', 'side', 'apartment', 'Ghostbusters', 'had', 'more', 'credibility', 'kidnappers', 'are', 'even', 'sillier', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'nearest', 'TV', 'station.The', 'villains', 'are', 'right', 'rejected', 'script', 'Shield', 'movie', 'enough', 'action', 'be', 'entertaining', 'stretches', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'do', 'commendable', 'job', 'strangely', 'written', 'role', ""'m"", 'not', 'rich', 'howler', 'also', 'saddled', 'monologue', 'right', 'talking', 'killer', 'handbook', 'where', 'instead', 'running', 'away', 'stabbing', 'man', 'length', 'how', 'science', 'teacher', 'knew', 'exactly', 'artery', 'cut', 'Lackluster', 'villains', 'constantly', 'changing', 'tone', 'contrived', 'credibility', 'sink', 'film', 'end', 'however', 'Sadly', 'High', 'School', 'teacher', 'looked', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'curriculum', 'consisted', 'how', 'steal', 'phone', 'service', 'stab', 'people', 'not', 'mention', 'live', 'millionaire', 'teachers', 'salary', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'MIT', 'rather', 'party', 'school', 'named', 'drugstore']",N/A

Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 5]","I was looking forward to this movie because the story (woman trapped in small room by bad guys with only a pieced together phone as her link to the outside world) sounded intriguing. Unfortunately, the script, dialogue and characterizations didn't deliver.SIDE NOTE: The DVD IS worth renting if only because it contains a documentary about the REAL case on which the movie was based. Be aware, however that the DVD won't last long, it isn't a high-quality DVD.I wanted to care about these characters, I really did. But they didn't come across as anything but stereotypes, moving around like chess pieces in a very boring game.Even worse, this script was written with nearly every stereotype in the world including:1. The damsel in distress who begs for help until she finally rises to the occasion and turns things around, something she could have done much earlier.2. The young guy, who seems to be heartless and immature, who is amazingly able to become a hero and perform extraordinary acts of daring that would test a seasoned veteran driver, gymnast, etc. Every time his cell phone battery got low, he'd have to make some move that defied belief - like backing up in a crowded tunnel with cars behind him, cars hurtling toward him at high speed.3. The cop who is burned out and ready to quit but steps up to the plate and comes through in a pinch. Played by Wiliam H. Macy, I found him the best of the bunch, simply because Macy can take nearly any role and make it unique.4. The arrogant jerk of a lawyer who gets his comeuppance when his car gets stolen - not once, but twice. Along the way, this guy manages to hit every stereotype out there - from his sneering attitude to his bullying of underlings.To be fair, the primary focus of the movie seemed to be action and suspense, with character development a minor part of the whole puzzle - but even when it came to action and suspense, it just didn't grab me the way similar movies -movies like Speed -have done. It was slick, way too slick, a formula movie without enough heart.Maybe next time the director will put as much time into character development as special effects.",3,Macy and Bassinger deserve better than this  thin script,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,2134,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'story', 'woman', 'trapped', 'small', 'room', 'bad', 'guys', 'only', 'pieced', 'together', 'phone', 'link', 'outside', 'world', 'sounded', 'intriguing', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'dialogue', 'characterizations', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver.SIDE', 'NOTE', 'DVD', 'IS', 'renting', 'only', 'documentary', 'REAL', 'case', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'Be', 'aware', 'however', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', ""n't"", 'high-quality', 'DVD.I', 'wanted', 'care', 'characters', 'really', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'anything', 'stereotypes', 'moving', 'chess', 'pieces', 'very', 'boring', 'game.Even', 'worse', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'nearly', 'stereotype', 'world', 'including:1', 'damsel', 'distress', 'who', 'help', 'finally', 'occasion', 'things', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'earlier.2', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'heartless', 'immature', 'who', 'amazingly', 'able', 'become', 'hero', 'perform', 'extraordinary', 'acts', 'daring', 'would', 'test', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'driver', 'gymnast', 'etc', 'time', 'cell', 'phone', 'battery', 'got', 'low', ""'d"", 'have', 'make', 'move', 'defied', 'belief', 'backing', 'up', 'crowded', 'tunnel', 'cars', 'cars', 'hurtling', 'high', 'speed.3', 'cop', 'who', 'burned', 'out', 'ready', 'quit', 'up', 'plate', 'through', 'pinch', 'Played', 'Wiliam', 'H.', 'Macy', 'found', 'best', 'bunch', 'simply', 'Macy', 'can', 'take', 'nearly', 'role', 'make', 'unique.4', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'lawyer', 'who', 'comeuppance', 'when', 'car', 'stolen', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'way', 'guy', 'hit', 'stereotype', 'there', 'sneering', 'attitude', 'bullying', 'underlings.To', 'be', 'fair', 'primary', 'focus', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'action', 'suspense', 'character', 'development', 'minor', 'part', 'whole', 'puzzle', 'even', 'when', 'came', 'action', 'suspense', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'way', 'similar', 'movies', '-movies', 'Speed', '-have', 'done', 'was', 'slick', 'way', 'too', 'slick', 'formula', 'movie', 'enough', 'heart.Maybe', 'next', 'time', 'director', 'will', 'put', 'much', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'special', 'effects']",N/A
865416,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0006D3HGA,Kenji Fujishima,"[2, 4]","David R. Ellis' CELLULAR is not really a very significant movie, but it works quite well as a clever, entertaining thriller. In a time when overlength and bombast seem to characterize many Hollywood big-budget action blockbusters, here is a thriller that never takes itself too seriously, has fun with its admittedly gimmicky premise, and is refreshingly concise at 94 minutes.Larry Cohen gets the story credit for this movie (Chris Morgan wrote the screenplay), but Cohen looms large anyway, since, in many ways, CELLULAR is a spiritual sequel to his PHONE BOOTH, an old script of his that was touched up and filmed by Joel Schumacher in 2001. PHONE BOOTH used its trapped-in-a-phone-booth premise to enact a morality play of sorts; CELLULAR has no such pretensions to be anything other than a breezy suspense flick. But, lest that makes this movie sound entertaining but insubstantial...well, the movie does have some funny gags in it that lightly but sharply satirize how widespread cell phone usage has become, and perhaps how we've all come to rely a bit too highly on it.That's the great thing about CELLULAR. Within its thriller plot---in which a kidnapped woman (Kim Basinger) dials a random number and pins her and her daughter's hopes of staying alive on a hedonistic young man (Chris Evans) and his cell phone---director David R. Ellis still manages to bring real wit and freshness to the proceedings, rather than trying to make too much of a big deal out of the plot, which is basically standard thriller stuff with a neat gimmick to it. Not even that supposed action auteur Michael Bay would have had as much fun with the retiring-cop cliche as Ellis does with William H. Macy's character, a policeman who has dreams of opening up his own day spa (and has a few amusing scenes in which he discusses beauty products with others). Macy is a sheer delight in this movie, playing this quirky cop for all its worth; all the performances manage to be convincing (although the genial Chris Evans is perhaps too much of a lightweight to be an effective action hero).All these little loving touches---the quirky characters, the little bits of satire---add up to make CELLULAR a witty and entertaining suspense ride. The twisty plot, in the end, is negligible; enjoy this movie for its sheer sense of fun, and savor its clever touches.

She is so much more down-to-earth than other screen stars, so that even with her amazing beauty, she always seems like a person we might actually know.  When she is abducted so brutally it's really wrenching and like the old ""SORRY WRONG NUMBER"" with Barbara Stanwyck we go crazy with suspense hoping that her connection will last until she can be rescued.  Only more so, because in the 1940s movie Stanwyck was pretty much a negative character whom you could never identify with, whereas here Kim's playing a very sympathetic part.  I think she and Chris Evans make a pretty good scream team, even though she's so much older than he is.  The studios should try re-teaming them.

865418,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0006D3HGA,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[8, 11]","A lot of thrillers have used modern technology--cell phones, internet, etc.--as trappings, in the classic James Bond manner.  Cellular is one of the first to use it as the actual motivating force of the story.The beginning of this movie is abrupt.  When a glass door is kicked out and a housekeeper is shot in the back, and it's still the establishing shot, this is perhaps a little sudden.  The only thing we have established for ourselves in advance is that Kim Basinger is a science teacher with a son.But then things begin to move.  Why is Kim being held captive by men in bomber jackets and five-o'clock shadows that reach their eyebrows?  Will she be able to rebuild the smashed phone enough to contact anybody?  Will she get out within the two-hour time limit on feature films?Kim reaches Chris Evans on a cell phone and, with some importuning, manages to convince him to help her fight her way to freedom.  From this point, this film moves forward in fits and starts, as action films tend to do, bit I was gripping my knees the whole time.  It was that engaging.In fairness, this film is imperfect.  The establishment is too short and the climax is too long.  William H. Macy, in a supporting role, appears to have been transplanted from a David Mamet film, and doesn't match the playful tone of the beginning or the tension of the rest.  And this film is loud--it's set in Los Angeles, and it tries to capture the level of ambient noise that city carries with it from day to day.But at no point did I feel it wasn't proceeding in an appropriate linear manner, or that the story was enforced upon the characters.  The situation was perhaps artificial, but it was presented plausibly.  It moves forward because it moves forward, not because director David R. Ellis or writers Larry Cohen and Chris Morgan tried to force it.This isn't film as art.  It's simple-minded, physical, and aims for the gut more than the head.  But it succeeds as what it is, and feels like one of the best action thrillers in recent years.  If that's what you're looking for, this is your film.",4,New Classic Style,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2077,"['lot', 'thrillers', 'have', 'used', 'modern', 'technology', 'cell', 'phones', 'internet', 'etc.', 'trappings', 'classic', 'James', 'Bond', 'manner', 'Cellular', 'one', 'first', 'use', 'actual', 'motivating', 'force', 'story.The', 'beginning', 'movie', 'abrupt', 'When', 'glass', 'door', 'kicked', 'out', 'housekeeper', 'shot', 'back', 'still', 'establishing', 'shot', 'perhaps', 'little', 'sudden', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'established', 'ourselves', 'advance', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'science', 'teacher', 'son.But', 'then', 'things', 'begin', 'move', 'Why', 'Kim', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'men', 'bomber', 'jackets', ""five-o'clock"", 'shadows', 'reach', 'eyebrows', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'rebuild', 'smashed', 'phone', 'enough', 'contact', 'anybody', 'Will', 'get', 'two-hour', 'time', 'limit', 'feature', 'films', 'Kim', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'cell', 'phone', 'importuning', 'convince', 'help', 'fight', 'way', 'freedom', 'point', 'film', 'forward', 'fits', 'starts', 'action', 'films', 'tend', 'do', 'bit', 'was', 'gripping', 'knees', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'engaging.In', 'fairness', 'film', 'imperfect', 'establishment', 'too', 'short', 'climax', 'too', 'long', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'supporting', 'role', 'have', 'been', 'transplanted', 'David', 'Mamet', 'film', ""n't"", 'match', 'playful', 'tone', 'beginning', 'tension', 'rest', 'film', 'loud', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'capture', 'level', 'ambient', 'noise', 'city', 'day', 'day.But', 'point', 'did', 'feel', 'was', ""n't"", 'proceeding', 'appropriate', 'linear', 'manner', 'story', 'was', 'enforced', 'characters', 'situation', 'was', 'perhaps', 'artificial', 'was', 'presented', 'plausibly', 'forward', 'forward', 'not', 'director', 'David', 'R.', 'Ellis', 'writers', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'Chris', 'Morgan', 'tried', 'force', 'it.This', ""n't"", 'film', 'art', 'simple-minded', 'physical', 'gut', 'more', 'head', 'what', 'feels', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'thrillers', 'recent', 'years', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film']",N/A
865419,A1E85KPLPYVW8E,B0006D3HGA,"Kolors ""Jimmy""","[3, 4]","Cellular is a sad attempt at taking the cell phone craze that's swept America and tries to incorporate it into a popcorn action/thriller. I think the filmmakers really thought that because of cell phone popularity they could make an action/thriller where all the events in the plot are centered around a cell phone, and it would be well-received and successful. Wrong.First of all, the idea behind this movie could've been executed much better. They just did this film in such a ridiculous manner it was almost comical. Okay, the movie is about a woman, who after she is kidnapped and locked in an attic, rewires a smashed phone that is in the room with her and after many attempts is only able to make one random call. The call is made to the cell phone of a guy named Ryan. She tells him her situation and convinces him to stay on the phone with her because he is her only hope and she more than likely won't be able to make another call if he hangs up. He then decides to be a hero and goes on a quest to save the woman and her family using her guidance on the phone. Along his journey he must overcome massive feats of traffic, low cell phone batteries, poor signals, poor voice quality, the threat of dropped calls and using up too many minutes.A lot of the scenes where Ryan can't drive through a tunnel because he will lose his signal on his cell, or when his cell phone is almost dead and he has to go through any-means-necessary to get a charger are supposed to be exciting, but are just stupid and laughable.Other than that, all the acting in the movie was pretty crappy. The only thing going for this movie was some okay action although it was minimal, and a lot of laughable moments, some intentional, others were not.",2,An action thriller driven by a cell phone?

I predicted that I would think that ""Cellular"" was 'Phone Booth' without the booth. This was not quite the case.In fact, it's almost as if they're two sides of the same coin. ""Phone Booth"" was made interesting because of the claustrophobia created by the booth. ""Celluar"" also uses the titular device very much to its advantage. (battery dying, etc.)However ""Cellular""'s greatest achievement is thrusting a very unwilling man into an extraordinary position. Admiittedly, my action film experience is rather limited especially in recent years but I would venture to say that the plot device of an ordinary man having heroism thurst upon him is realtively uncommon. Just off the top of my head I can think of ""Panic Room"" as the last hostage film I've seen. In that film and other films as far back as the Humphrey Bogart version of ""Desperate Hours"" the characters must save THEMSELVES from danger. In the typical action film the detached hero is usually a John McClane-like supercop, not John Q. Passerby. While this selfless bravery is one of the hardest things to believe in the film it is also what keeps us rooting for him.As is to be expected, there are quite a bit of ridiculous close calls, but I would urge you to shut-off the part of your brain that reminds you of the often hilarious implausibility of it all, and buckle-up to ENJOY the undenably entertaining ride.",3,"Not as good as ""Phone Booth"", but not a rehash either",1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,1570,"['Cellular', 'immediately', 'comparison', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'reasons', 'are', 'compounded', 'when', 'one', 'screenwriter', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'was', 'co-writer', 'film', 'predicted', 'would', 'think', 'Cellular', 'was', ""'Phone"", 'Booth', 'booth', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'case.In', 'fact', 'almost', ""'re"", 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'was', 'made', 'interesting', 'claustrophobia', 'created', 'booth', 'Celluar', 'also', 'titular', 'device', 'very', 'much', 'advantage', 'battery', 'dying', 'etc', 'However', 'Cellular', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'thrusting', 'very', 'unwilling', 'man', 'extraordinary', 'position', 'Admiittedly', 'action', 'film', 'experience', 'rather', 'limited', 'especially', 'recent', 'years', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'plot', 'device', 'ordinary', 'man', 'having', 'heroism', 'thurst', 'realtively', 'uncommon', 'Just', 'top', 'head', 'can', 'think', 'Panic', 'Room', 'last', 'hostage', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'other', 'films', 'far', 'back', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'version', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'characters', 'must', 'save', 'THEMSELVES', 'danger', 'typical', 'action', 'film', 'detached', 'hero', 'usually', 'John', 'McClane-like', 'supercop', 'not', 'John', 'Q.', 'Passerby', 'selfless', 'bravery', 'one', 'hardest', 'things', 'believe', 'film', 'also', 'what', 'rooting', 'him.As', 'be', 'expected', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'close', 'calls', 'would', 'urge', 'shut-off', 'part', 'brain', 'often', 'hilarious', 'implausibility', 'buckle-up', 'ENJOY', 'undenably', 'entertaining', 'ride']",N/A

Without question, Chris Evans is adorable, but he's also a really good actor.  And the predicament he finds himself in...well, let's just say he rises to the challenge and becomes a hero, whether he wanted to in the beginning or not.William H. Macy, as always, just shines in his role as the detective who cares...and who also plans to open a day spa with his wife (which brings about a few comical moments in an otherwise fast paced, tense hour and a half).  Kim Basinger is also good in this movie, but it's the guys that steal the show.  I won't comment on Jessica Biel because my mom always taught me that if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.  But I will say that I'm glad that her part in this movie was brief.The only problem I had with the movie is that, after all the times I've watched it, I'm still a little confused over how Chris Evans' character was able to reconnect with the woman using the cell phone belonging to the man whose car he hijacked for a second time.All in all, I couldn't be happier to recommend Cellular to anyone.

865423,A356RFKNIG043B,B0006D3HGA,K. Swanson,"[5, 7]","4.5 stars for the Rampart docCellular is annoying after a while due to its main device, the looooong phone call. It grates after five minutes or so but goes on for muuuuuuch longer than that! The dialogue is insipid, the director has no idea how to make it seem real or even properly dramatic, and it all quickly devolves into a boring and bothersome mess.Basinger was never much of an actress, and is true to form. Statham is way too nice as the bad guy; he's getting used to being the hero and is afraid to be really nasty here. Too bad, as he's a great villain, but not here. Macy is the only decent thing in this flick, but even his turn at comic relief gets old. All in all, a big pass on this one.BUT. It's a sad day when the extra documentaries on a dvd blow away the feature, but that's what happens here. I didn't watch the making-of...who cares to if the film sucks? The doc on cell phones is pretty good, though, and is properly critical of how they've screwed up our lives (I still don't have one, proudly!). The real highlight of this dvd is the doc on the LA Rampart police corruption scandal. It's brief and to the point, and eventually points out convincingly that the entire LA police department was invloved in drug dealing and various other crimes that they supposedly swore to protect those of us who pay their salaries from. The doc shows top police brass shutting the investigation down as it gets too close to the truth.But hey, anyone who can read and use logic knows what they're hiding. Our gov't admitted to trading guns for powder in the Iran-Contra scandals, so we know our military runs drugs. Many books by ex-CIA agents prove that the agency has dealt and no doubt still deals much of the hard drugs in this country. Every year since we invaded Afghanistan the H production has gone up. Coincidence? Yeah, right.This documentary shows how street cops are involved in aiding and abetting the drug-dealers who run our government and start our wars to keep the police state in place and the money and power flowing their way. When the truth is almost uncovered suddenly the chief of our largest police force stops the investigation, no doubt at the behest of its bosses in the military and CIA. This is not conspiracy theory. It's easily provable fact. Read the books by ex-agents, read the Iran-Contra testimony, read the various books on how crack started in LA in the 80s as a very successful form of controlling the black population and filling our private, for-profit prisons and keeping the police state ever stronger. It's working better every day for them while this country goes down the economic and moral tubes.No nutty theories here. Just well-documented fact. That Americans refuse to believe it only shows how deeply hypnotized we are by the media and our own greed and national ego.Call someone on your cell phone and tell them about it.",3,"Weak script, annoying film, but dvd documentary on bad cops is great",1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,2881,"['4.5', 'stars', 'Rampart', 'docCellular', 'annoying', 'while', 'due', 'main', 'device', 'looooong', 'phone', 'call', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'muuuuuuch', 'longer', 'dialogue', 'insipid', 'director', 'idea', 'how', 'make', 'seem', 'real', 'even', 'properly', 'dramatic', 'quickly', 'boring', 'bothersome', 'mess.Basinger', 'was', 'never', 'much', 'actress', 'true', 'form', 'Statham', 'way', 'too', 'nice', 'bad', 'guy', 'getting', 'used', 'being', 'hero', 'afraid', 'be', 'really', 'nasty', 'here', 'Too', 'bad', 'great', 'villain', 'not', 'here', 'Macy', 'only', 'decent', 'thing', 'flick', 'even', 'turn', 'comic', 'relief', 'old', 'big', 'pass', 'one.BUT', 'sad', 'day', 'when', 'extra', 'documentaries', 'dvd', 'blow', 'away', 'feature', 'what', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'making-of', 'who', 'film', 'sucks', 'doc', 'cell', 'phones', 'pretty', 'good', 'properly', 'critical', 'how', ""'ve"", 'screwed', 'up', 'lives', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'proudly', 'real', 'highlight', 'dvd', 'doc', 'LA', 'Rampart', 'police', 'corruption', 'scandal', 'brief', 'point', 'eventually', 'points', 'out', 'convincingly', 'entire', 'LA', 'police', 'department', 'was', 'invloved', 'drug', 'dealing', 'various', 'other', 'crimes', 'supposedly', 'swore', 'protect', 'who', 'pay', 'salaries', 'doc', 'top', 'police', 'brass', 'shutting', 'investigation', 'down', 'too', 'close', 'truth.But', 'hey', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'read', 'use', 'logic', 'knows', 'what', ""'re"", 'hiding', ""gov't"", 'admitted', 'trading', 'guns', 'powder', 'Iran-Contra', 'scandals', 'know', 'military', 'runs', 'drugs', 'Many', 'books', 'ex-CIA', 'agents', 'prove', 'agency', 'dealt', 'doubt', 'still', 'much', 'hard', 'drugs', 'country', 'year', 'invaded', 'Afghanistan', 'H', 'production', 'gone', 'up', 'Coincidence', 'Yeah', 'right.This', 'documentary', 'how', 'street', 'cops', 'are', 'involved', 'aiding', 'abetting', 'drug-dealers', 'who', 'run', 'government', 'start', 'wars', 'keep', 'police', 'state', 'place', 'money', 'power', 'flowing', 'way', 'When', 'truth', 'almost', 'uncovered', 'suddenly', 'chief', 'largest', 'police', 'force', 'investigation', 'doubt', 'behest', 'bosses', 'military', 'CIA', 'not', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'easily', 'provable', 'fact', 'Read', 'books', 'ex-agents', 'read', 'Iran-Contra', 'testimony', 'read', 'various', 'books', 'how', 'crack', 'started', 'LA', '80s', 'very', 'successful', 'form', 'controlling', 'black', 'population', 'filling', 'private', 'for-profit', 'prisons', 'keeping', 'police', 'state', 'ever', 'stronger', 'working', 'better', 'day', 'country', 'down', 'economic', 'moral', 'tubes.No', 'nutty', 'theories', 'here', 'Just', 'well-documented', 'fact', 'Americans', 'refuse', 'believe', 'only', 'how', 'deeply', 'hypnotized', 'are', 'media', 'own', 'greed', 'national', 'ego.Call', 'someone', 'cell', 'phone', 'tell']",N/A

865426,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,B0006D3HGA,Larry Scantlebury,"[4, 6]","High school Science Teacher Jessica Martin is walking her son Ricky to a school bustop in Brentwood, California. OK. That part seems a little odd. Jessica, a teacher and her husband, she later says, is a not too successful real eastate agent. Yet the house she returns to (why is she walking Ricky anyway . . . it's Brentwood not Brooklyn) has to be worth $750,000 easy.But suspending your disbelief at the opening, this movie really grabs you right after that. The casting of William Macy as the retiring cop, similar to Robert Duvall's role in ""Falling Down"" is excellent. Jason Stratham, the English Footballer cum Hollywood bad guy is another good decision although he still has a slight cockney accent that seems out of place for a tough, street savvy thug. Perhaps not in West London but in West LA, a handicap.Jessica's slapped around and taken to an out of the way home with an attic, where she is stashed. The plot hinges on Kim Bassinger being able to put together a smashed telephone by rubbing two copper wires together. Having no idea whom she is calling, naturally she ends up with a self absorbed surfer ""dude"" when he picks up his ringing cell phone.It could have gone comic here but the transition from a selfish womanizing kid to the ulikely role of hero is well played by Chris Evans.Truly, there are some gaps in the flow of the movie but you're not going to the movie to see Kenneth Branagh in one of the Henry plays. It's an exciting ride, worth the money. Lots of excitement and it's a fairly well kept secret for the first 3/4th of the movies as to why Jessica/Kim was kidnapped.It's worth the ride, and as one of the editorial comments above stated, Kim Bassinger is a lot more substantive now than she was 20 years ago. 5 stars.

865429,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006D3HGA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","""Cellular"" is one of the rare films of the action-thriller genre that I have seen in recent years where I am not wringing my hands and rolling my eyes because the characters are being stupid.  If I yell at a character in a movie to do something and they do it, then I have to take that as being a good sign.  This is important, because with a film like ""Cellular,"" which is trying to milk a gimmick for everything it is worth, you need to have something else going for you and I think this 2004 film certainly does.  This might not be a great action-thriller, but it is a whole lot better than most of the competition I have seen in recent months.Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger) is a high school biology teacher who sends her son, Ricky (Adam Taylor Gordon) off to school on the bus and walks back into her house in Brentwood.  Suddenly these men break into her home and drag her away to an attic.  Their leader (Jason Statham) uses a sledgehammer to smash the phone in the attic and then demands to know where her husband has hidden ""it.""  Of course, Jessica knows nothing about what he is talking about, but she does know enough about science to get the broken phone to work, although she has to touch wires to come up with numbers at random.When somebody finally answers the phone, it is Ryan (Chris Evans), a young man with girl friend problems who think the call is a joke.  Then some things happen to change his mind and she convinces him to go to a police station and give the phone to a copy, in this case one named Mooney (William H. Macy).  But Fate is going to make this difficult and it is Ryan who is caught up in trying to help Jessica, especially since there are other things that need to be done besides simply finding out where she is and rescuing here.  Whereas Jessica knows her biology (giving her a free shot with a short knife is not a good idea), Ryan is more of a quick-thinking opportunist.  When he has to act, he makes his decisions on the fly.  They might not always be right, but he is always in motion.  He also gets credit for determination, because overall his success rate is pretty low if you keep a running score.Meanwhile, Mooney has not forgotten about the kid who ran into the police station talking about a woman named Jessica Martin being kidnapped.  Maybe he is distracted because he is preoccupied with thoughts about the Day Spa he wants to open, or maybe things just need to percolate in his mind for a while.  But both Jessica and Ryan are dealing with an endless stream of split-second decisions, so Mooney provides ""Cellular"" with some necessary breathing space and some moderate comic relief.  So both Ryan and Mooney are trying to come to Jessica's aid, and we know that it is not until they are all in the same area that we will be getting to the climax of this one.  Until then, we get to enjoy the ride.If it seems like ""Cellular"" is the flip side of ""Phone Booth,"" there are certainly plenty of reasons to think so.  Larry Cohen, who came up with the story for ""Cellular"" did the screenplay for ""Phone Booth"" (which also had some smart characters in terms of Forest Whitaker's cop).  Chris Morgan did the screenplay and clearly at some point in the process of producing this movie people sat around and came up with a comprehensive list of everything that can be done with a cell phone.  You name it, it pops up at some point in this movie, and if you are going to do a gimmick then going all the way with it is a pretty good idea (even if the last exchange of the movie is pretty lame).Yes, this movie has moments where things get a bit outrageous, but they usually involve Ryan driving his car in the wrong direction despite the presence of lots of other cars, and are just minor complications given the big picture.  ""Cellular"" also has yet another one of those scenes that I am really tired of seeing, to wit: a trained police officer gets the drop on a bad guy and is pointing his gun at the bad guy, whose gun is by his side.  The bad guy gets away, although I insist that a trained police officer would be able to drop the suspect in his tracks (but it never happens in the movies).  So on the basis of that I was going to round down on the rating for this film, but then Ryan does exactly what you should go with a door to take out a bad guy, and I end up rounding up.In terms of the performances the one that stands out from the crowd is Statham as the leader of the bad guys.  He has a great scowl for most of the film and in his final scene he gives a nice look that indicates he fully appreciates the irony of what has happened to him.  Basinger is forced to play between controlled hysteria and uncontrolled hysteria by the script and Macy finds a way to fill every one of his silences with nicely nuanced actions.  Evans makes a nice transition from the hormonal case he plays at the beginning to the frantic but determined hero he has to be for most of the film, which becomes the key performance in director David R. Ellis' film because Ryan's character provides the requisite believability in the exaggerated storyline.  You either buy into this one and enjoy it, or just write it off as absurdity from start to finish.  Fortunately, I grant the absurdity of such far as a starting point.",5,"I do not have a cell phone, but I see they could be useful",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,5256,"['Cellular', 'one', 'rare',

In a similar situation, you might enjoy it.It does some things well:If you're a screenwriter, it gives you a library of every cliche in every old Warner Bros. B-movie or every old Saturday serial. It also skewers many parts of our culture skilfully, such as car improundment. It also serves as an effective counterbalance to the political sturm and drang ofBill O'ReillyBill MoyersBill Maher.It does the rest poorly:The two opening scenes begin with insipid and stupid dialogue. (Of course they do telegraph that we need to relax, eliminate judgment, and just enjoy the ride.) There is no acting worth noting. William H. Macy misunderstands this and tries sincerely to act, as this movie demands a below-comic-book level of acting. Villain Jason Statham makes the same mistake. The miscast husband is a character actor known for playing tough guys but his character is totally passive and meek. Whereas prim and pretty Kim Basinger takes a beating over and over but is physically heroic as she remains dressed and made up for a big date. The only interesting thing about the acting lead, Chris Evans (who?) is how come he's a dead-ringer for Ricky Nelson before he became Rick Nelson. The situations are never believable, not remotely.It's really an awful movie. I can just smell one of the writers (there are two) trying to do something meaningful and dramatic, while the other acts as a shill for doltish cynical producers. (By the way, New Line honcho Bob Shaye has a tiny uncredited role.) It's like they were trying to combine ""Oklahoma"" with ""Doggie in the Window.""

865431,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0006D3HGA,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 6]","Directed by David R. Ellis who directed ""Final Destination 2"" and was the 2nd unit director for numerous productions including ""Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone"" & ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" ""Cellular"" is a pleasing romp that keeps you glued to the screen as long as you don't expect too much or analyze to closely.Since her breakthrough in the James Bond ""Never Say Never Again"" in 1983, Kim Basinger's career has had its ups & downs.  ""8 Mile,"" ""The Natural,"" ""9 & 1/2 Weeks"" and of course her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""L.A. Confidential"" in 1997 were all screen highs.  In ""Cellular,"" she actually makes fairly thin material look very good.  I particularly enjoyed the scene just after cutting the vein on the guard & escaping, she crashes a car into the shed to free her son, only to break down weeping as she has to choose between fleeing with her son and saving her husband.Chris Evans is currently riding high as the Human Torch in ""The Fantastic Four,"" one of this summer's action flicks.  He's a good looking lad who pops his shirt on & off faster than David R. Ellis can yell, ""Cut!""  His good natured self-deprecating humor makes him extremely likeable, even if his emotional range is as thin as the polish on a good Ferrari.Larry Cohen who was the screen writer for the Colin Ferrell film ""Phonebooth"" doesn't fine tune this script, mining the cell phone craze for as much distance as it will take him.There are some fine supporting performances in the film.  Jason Statham whose performance in ""The Transporter"" made it a great action hit and warranted the sequel soon to open does a good job as Greer, the dirty cop trying to keep a lid on the police corruption that lines his pockets.  He doesn't waste time on being conflicted about ethics.  He prefers money to protecting and serving & has a gleeful sneer as he bashes Basinger about the face.William H. Macy whose lone Oscar nomination came in 1996 for ""Fargo"" and has played in other great films such as ""Seabiscuit"" in 2003 plays the retiring cop Mooney, who is focused on setting up a day spa that his coworkers irritatingly keep mischaracterizing as a ""beauty parlor.""  His nose for solving the crime finally clicks as he wears the green algae and results in his somewhat improbably beating up a hunkier cop and cuffing him to the merry-go-round.  We get a sense of depth of character that Macy adds to Mooney's lines on the page.In smaller but still excellent supporting roles, Jessica Biel from ""Seventh Heaven"" & ""Ulee's Gold"" plays Ryan's girlfriend who wants to save the whales and go out with a guy who's not so superficial.  Caroline Aaron who has played in so many films including ""Working Girl,"" ""Primary Colors,"" & ""Sleepless In Seattle"" turns in a delightful cameo as Mrs. Mooney wearing the red algae and intent on getting the right beauty mask mix.  Adam Taylor Gordon as the son Ricky Martin does a great job in his first film as the little boy caught up in events who loves his mom and is scared.  Rick Hoffman who I first enjoyed in the 1-season ABC series ""Philly"" and has also appeared in ""Bloodwork"" & ""The Day After Tomorrow"" plays a self-absorbed lawyer who won't get off his phone and finds Ryan stealing his car twice.  Noah Emmerich as the dirty detective Jack Tanner turns in a creepy job as another authoritative cop.  His is one of those faces that you know you've seen before (""Crazy In Alabama,"" ""Windtalker,"" ""Beyond Borders), who turns in consistently excellent supporting performances.  We're delighted when we find that the murder film is still stored Ryan's cell phone.So while this is hardly a classic movie or film perfection, it does deliver and keep the audience attention.

But what if a woman is kidnapped and she calls a random cell phone number begging the person at the other end to save her life.  That is the premise of this 2004 film which grabbed my attention right at the beginning and held me glued to the DVD until the final frame.Kim Bassinger is the lady in distress and gives an outstanding performance.  She's actually 52 years old now and a veteran actress, and this role seems to have been made for her.  Chris Evans is cast as the young man with the cellular phone who has to jump through hoops to save her. Of course we know he'll save her.  This is that kind of movie.  The joy of the film is the way it happens and that's why I have to applaud the screenwriter, Larry Cohen, who keeps the tension high and the obstacles constant and real.  William H. Macy also gives one of his usual great performances.  This time he's cast as a cop who is about to retire.  He not only provides comic relief, but his performance is nothing short of excellent.

865438,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0006D3HGA,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[4, 6]","I officially love this movie! It was excellent, so much better than I was expecting it to be. I thought it felt quite long, although that doesn't mean it was slow in the slightest, it held my attention, and my mind didn't drift once.Kim Basinger's performance in this can't be faulted, although she reminded me slightly of Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 (don't know why), and someone else too (who, of course I can't remember). Jason Statham was excellent (shame on you Kelly Brook), and the lovely Chris Evans (later to be seen in Fantastic Four) was a little slow to begin with, although his character soon grew the more the film went on. Also, if you're a fan of Friends (you knew I was gonna say that), look out for a guy credited as 'Cellular' Store Assistant, otherwise known as Ernie Grunwald. He played a character called Tom Gordon in The One With The Memorial Service, in series 9. (He was also in Men In Black II) Also, an absolutely hilarious character was the guy credited as the WLSUU2 Lawyer, played by Rick Hoffman. This guy is hilarious!!! He's so funny, and for the couple of scenes he's on-screen, you won't be able to stop laughing.Larry Cohen worked on the script while he tried to get his screenplay Phone Booth (another favourite 'phone' movie of mine) sold. In a New Yorker article he says he wrote Cellular with the intention that it would be the direct opposite to Phone Booth. (Phone Booth is about a man trapped on a phone in a booth, Cellular is about a man who is still trapped on a phone but can go anywhere). However his friends told him that he had written the same screenplay twice.There are a lot of New Line references in this movie, although they completely bypassed me, despite being told to watch for them. I'm hopeless with studios - I'm not as organised as some, who sort their DVDs by studio THEN alphabetical - and the only New Line movies I could think of were Freddy vs Jason and Butterfly Effect. (I also saw a probably unintentional reference to Speed, which I thought was funny!) New Line Chairman Robert Shaye has a cameo as the irate man in the police station. Ricky's backpack is that of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. At the kidnappers' house, the New Line Cinema movie Final Destination 2 is playing on the television.Producer Dean Devlin has a cameo as the cab driver who drives Ryan. When Ryan is at the LAX, you can hear the boarding call for ""Flight 180 to Paris"". That is the same plane that blew up in Final Destination, also from New Line Cinema.The car stunts in this were absolutely amazing, although with the rule in the UK recently passed that you weren't allowed to talk & drive at the same time, I doubt it would have worked here! Chris Evans did his own car stunts. Before production began, he was trained for five weeks at Los Angeles stunt school. Most of the stunts are done by the actors themselves, also.The credits are the most original credits I've seen in a long time - probably since the Scream trilogy, when a still of the actor from the movie is against their name. This has the the cast names on a cellphone screen, which is so cool, and really well done.The extras on the DVD include: commentary by director David Ellis, writers Larry Cohen and Chris Morgan; deleted/alternate scenes; 3 exciting featurettes: ""Celling Out"" - a look at cell phones in today's culture, ""Dialing Up Cellular: Making of the film"", and ""Code Of Silence"" - Inside the Rampart scandal.This is an excellent, adrenaline-packed movie, that comes highly recommended.",4,"Amazing what a science teacher can do, isn't it?",1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,3538,"['officially', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'thought', 'felt', 'quite', 'long', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', 'slow', 'slightest', 'held', 'attention', 'mind', 'did', ""n't"", 'drift', 'once.Kim', 'Basinger', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'reminded', 'slightly', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Terminator', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'someone', 'else', 'too', 'who', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'was', 'excellent', 'shame', 'Kelly', 'Brook', 'lovely', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'later', 'be', 'seen', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'begin', 'character', 'soon', 'grew', 'more', 'film', 'went', 'Also', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Friends', 'knew', 'was', 'gon', 'say', 'look', 'out', 'guy', 'credited', ""'Cellular"", 'Store', 'Assistant', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Ernie', 'Grunwald', 'played', 'character', 'called', 'Tom', 'Gordon', 'One', 'Memorial', 'Service', 'series', '9', 'was', 'also', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'Also', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'character', 'was', 'guy', 'credited', 'WLSUU2', 'Lawyer', 'played', 'Rick', 'Hoffman', 'guy', 'hilarious', 'so', 'funny', 'couple', 'scenes', 'on-screen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'laughing.Larry', 'Cohen', 'worked', 'script', 'tried', 'get', 'screenplay', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'favourite', ""'phone"", 'movie', 'mine', 'sold', 'New', 'Yorker', 'article', 'wrote', 'Cellular', 'intention', 'would', 'be', 'direct', 'opposite', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'man', 'trapped', 'phone', 'booth', 'Cellular', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'trapped', 'phone', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'However', 'friends', 'told', 'had', 'written', 'same', 'screenplay', 'are', 'lot', 'New', 'Line', 'movie', 'completely', 'bypassed', 'being', 'told', 'watch', ""'m"", 'hopeless', 'studios', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'organised', 'who', 'sort', 'DVDs', 'studio', 'THEN', 'alphabetical', 'only', 'New', 'Line', 'movies', 'could', 'think', 'were', 'Freddy', 'vs', 'Jason', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'also', 'saw', 'probably', 'unintentional', 'reference', 'Speed', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'New', 'Line', 'Chairman', 'Robert', 'Shaye', 'cameo', 'irate', 'man', 'police', 'station', 'Ricky', 'backpack', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'kidnappers', 'house', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'movie', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'playing', 'television.Producer', 'Dean', 'Devlin', 'cameo', 'cab', 'driver', 'who', 'Ryan', 'When', 'Ryan', 'LAX', 'can', 'hear', 'boarding', 'call', 'Flight', '180', 'Paris', 'same', 'plane', 'blew', 'up', 'Final', 'Destination', 'also', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema.The', 'car', 'stunts', 'were', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'rule', 'UK', 'recently', 'passed', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'talk', 'drive', 'same', 'time', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'here', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'did', 'own', 'car', 'stunts', 'production', 'began', 'was', 'trained', 'five', 'weeks', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'stunt', 'school', 'Most', 'stunts', 'are', 'done', 'actors', 'also.The', 'credits', 'are', 'most', 'original', 'credits', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'probably', 'Scream', 'trilogy', 'when', 'still', 'actor', 'movie', 'name', 'cast', 'names', 'cellphone', 'screen', 'so', 'cool', 'really', 'well', 'done.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'commentary', 'director', 'David', 'Ellis', 'writers', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'Chris', 'Morgan', 'deleted/alternate', 'scenes', '3', 'exciting', 'featurettes', 'Celling', 'Out', 'look', 'cell', 'phones', 'today', 'culture', 'Dialing', 'Up', 'Cellular', 'Making', 'film', 'Code', 'Silence', 'Rampart', 'scandal.This', 'excellent', 'adrenaline-packed', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

I should say here that it has some funny moments sprinkled throughout as well - look for scenes with the lawyer!They did a great job of very slowly revealing what the ""prize"" was that the bad guys wanted from this family. In fact, they did a very good job of very slowly revealing who all of the members of the family in question even were and also just exactly who the bad guys really were!We thought that Chris Evans as Ryan, plays the part of the reluctant hero very well. He starts out very frivolous but rises to the occasion as soon as he realizes that what is going on is very real.One odd thing was that I thought Kim Basinger looked kind of ""rough"" at the beginning of the movie (like life hadn't treated her very well) when you expected her to look at her best.  Then later on, during her ordeal, she looked better and better.  That didn't seem to make much sense.  Remember:  Science teachers ROCK!Jason Statham was STELLAR in his role and William H Macy was superb in his role.To be honest, I had never heard of this movie, but I got it because it came up in an Amazon recommendation when I bought ""Fantastic 4"" and ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer.""  I am so happy that I got this DVD!  Although my heart is still racing!I think this is a great movie and I highly recommend it for it's fast paced action.

865441,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0006D3HGA,Michael Butts,"[2, 5]","My philosophy on movies is fairly simple:  there are some movies that suspending belief cannot be achieved:  such as biopics, movies where facts are vital.  Then there are movies that suspending belief gives you the enjoyment of watching an entertaining movie, whether or not it's plausible, no matter how far over the top it goes, you find yourself drawn in, like a good comic book.  CELLULAR falls into the latter; it's one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen recently.  And why?  Sure it's plot is ludicrous, the characters do things a real person would never do, but this IS a movie, a fictional piece of fluff, but done with such finesse and a sense of commitment by the actors that CELLULAR grabbed me from the start and I enjoyed every silly, action-packed, minute!Director David Ellis keeps the action fast and frenetic, and the cast is great.  Oscar winner Kim Basinger may phone in her performance, but that is not an insult.  She's very convincing in her fierce desire to protect her family.  As evidenced in movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK, being a heroine in distress can give a good actress a good performance.  Chris Evans (this is my first encounter with this young actor) is inventive, energetic and fun to watch as he overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to save this woman he's never met.  He is required to carry most of the movie and I found him great to route for.  William H. Macy again demonstrates his range in the role of the soon to retire policeman who is going to open a day spa with his wife.  Macy in avocado paste on his face is a delight!  Jason Statham (Transporter, Ghosts of Mars) reminds me of a bigger Bruce Willis and his cool, but demonic, performance is tense.  Rick Hoffman has as deliciously funny small part as the snooty lawyer who falls victim to Evans' heroics.  Rounding out the cast are Jessica Biel (Blade Trinity), Noah Emmerich (Miracle), Eric Christian Olsen and Matt McColm (Subterfuge).  Even the annoying soundtrack (not John Ottman's score, but the let's put the pop songs in for the teen tunes) can't distract from the film's enticement.I really liked this movie, again, because it entertained me and that is truly why I watch a movie.",5,PHONETASTIC PHUN,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,2200,"['philosophy', 'movies', 'fairly', 'simple', 'are', 'movies', 'suspending', 'belief', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'achieved', 'such', 'biopics', 'movies', 'where', 'facts', 'are', 'vital', 'Then', 'are', 'movies', 'suspending', 'belief', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'not', 'plausible', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'top', 'find', 'drawn', 'good', 'comic', 'book', 'CELLULAR', 'latter', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'why', 'Sure', 'plot', 'ludicrous', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'real', 'person', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'movie', 'fictional', 'piece', 'fluff', 'done', 'such', 'finesse', 'sense', 'commitment', 'actors', 'CELLULAR', 'grabbed', 'start', 'enjoyed', 'silly', 'action-packed', 'minute', 'Director', 'David', 'Ellis', 'action', 'fast', 'frenetic', 'cast', 'great', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'may', 'phone', 'performance', 'not', 'insult', 'very', 'convincing', 'fierce', 'desire', 'protect', 'family', 'evidenced', 'movies', 'WAIT', 'UNTIL', 'DARK', 'being', 'heroine', 'distress', 'can', 'give', 'good', 'actress', 'good', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'first', 'encounter', 'young', 'actor', 'inventive', 'energetic', 'fun', 'watch', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'obstacles', 'save', 'woman', 'never', 'met', 'required', 'carry', 'most', 'movie', 'found', 'great', 'route', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'again', 'range', 'role', 'soon', 'retire', 'policeman', 'who', 'going', 'open', 'day', 'spa', 'wife', 'Macy', 'avocado', 'paste', 'face', 'delight', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Transporter', 'Ghosts', 'Mars', 'bigger', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'cool', 'demonic', 'performance', 'tense', 'Rick', 'Hoffman', 'as', 'deliciously', 'funny', 'small', 'part', 'snooty', 'lawyer', 'who', 'victim', 'Evans', 'heroics', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'Miracle', 'Eric', 'Christian', 'Olsen', 'Matt', 'McColm', 'Subterfuge', 'Even', 'annoying', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'John', 'Ottman', 'score', 'let', 'put', 'pop', 'songs', 'teen', 'tunes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'distract', 'film', 'enticement.I', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'again', 'entertained', 'truly', 'why', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

But, while ""Phone Booth"" kept the main character trapped in a phone booth for the entire movie, ""Cellular"" allows the good guy freedom to rove all over the city as long as he has his cell phone with him.  Ryan (Evans) receives a phone call on his cellular phone from Jessica (Basinger).  She tells him that she has been kidnapped and has managed to get the smashed phone that she has working.  She needs his help.  She has no idea why she has been kidnapped, bur is worried about her son and husband.  When Ryan finally comes to believe her, he sets out to save her and her family.""Cellular"" keeps the tension at a high level throughout its running time, and that is its saving grace.  It is not until later, looking back, that you realize that some of what has gone before stretches credibility.  And that is ok.  Basinger and Evans are very good in the lead roles, and William H. Macy is his usual excellent best in a supporting role as a cop who does not believe Ryan at first.  They work well together, and the bond that they form is believeable.  The reasons for the kidnapping are also plausible.""Cellular"" is a pleasant find in the doldrums of September cinema.

865444,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0006D3HGA,mirasreviews,"[10, 13]","""Cellular"" is a fast-paced action/suspense from the get-go. It has barely set the scene when a group of men burst into Jessica Martin's (Kim Basinger) suburban home, abduct her, and imprison her in an attic. To make sure she is unable to communicate with the outside world, her captor, Ethan (Jason Statham), takes a baseball bat to the only telephone in the attic, and old but functioning rotary dial model. Unable to find any means of escape, a terrified Jessica places her hope in the shattered telephone, whose wiring still works in spite of having no dial or handset. Eventually, she gets through to someone: a flippant self-centered young man named Ryan (Chris Evans) who is intent on running an errand for his girlfriend and annoyed by the unexpected caller on his cell phone. Initially incredulous, Ryan becomes convinced of Jessica's kidnapping story and tries his best to help her her while driving around Los Angeles trying desperately not to lose her signal.""Cellular"" excels at being fast and exciting. Accepting that Ryan cannot find any police officer to help him requires suspension of disbelief. The car chases are nothing that I haven't seen so many times before that I really didn't want to see it in this movie. And Ryan's personality will rub some members of the audience the wrong way. He's annoying. But none of that is enough to undermine ""Cellular""'s compact, energetic entertainment value. Kim Basinger is really quite convincing as a terrified, desperate wife and mother. She's a strong character who tries to control what she can of her situation, so avoids any ""damsel in distress"" clich&eacute;. And since there is no romantic interest between Jessica and her would-be savior, Ryan, ""Cellular"" sidesteps another clich&eacute;. Cell phones are ubiquitous in contemporary film, but this is one of the few that succeeds in using them to advance the plot in a believable well-integrated fashion. Most of the acting in ""Cellular"" is actually speaking into a telephone. It can't be easy to make so much dialogue phone conversations and hang the film's arc on that. Characters who are glued to a telephone conversation are isolated even in a crowd -a concept not lost on screenwriter Larry Cohen, who also wrote ""Phone Booth"". ""Cellular"" isn't a great film, but an entertaining one. You won't fall asleep!The DVD (New Line 2005): Bonus features include 3 documentaries, an audio commentary, a theatrical trailer, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). ""Calling Out"" (18 minutes) is about the history of telephones and the social implications of mobile (cellular) phones. Telecommunications engineers Dr. Martin Cooper and Joel Engel, technology journalists, and a psychologist talk about how cell phones work and what they mean for us and for the future. ""Dialing Up Cellular"" (25 minutes) is a documentary about making the film, including comments on the film's conception, performances, and filming the car chases. Writers Larry Cohen and Chris Morgan, director David Ellis, the cast, and various crew are interviewed. ""Code of Silence: Inside the Rampart Scandal"" (25 minutes) is about the 1999 police corruption scandal that involved the LAPD's Rampart Division. I found it very interesting since I am not an Angelino and was not familiar with the details of this case. The audio commentary is by director David Ellis, his sister and assistant stunt co-ordinator Annie Ellis, and his daughter and Associate Producer Tawny Ellis. Over the course of the commentary, they call various members of the film's cast and crew on their cell phones to get their comments.

I give huge credit for that to actor Chris Evans in his first starring role.  He emotes quite well, very realistically, considering that he's practically on a cell phone for most of the movie.  His facial expressions and comments are fun to watch.Kim Basinger plays the terrified victim, who pretty much yells and screams a lot, but she has a few tricks up her sleeves as well, so that's a relief.  To reveal anything more about the film would spoil the plot, as there are some neat twists thrown in, while also falling prey to some moments of predictability as well.  Its a good suspense and action film that packs a lot of punch in the short 90 minute duration.  After seeing the deleted scenes, I personally think the original ending was better.  Its just a few seconds longer, but it packs more of a punch.  Overall, a film worth watching and it will undoubtedly remind you of ""Speed"" and ""Phone Booth"" as a perfect blend of both.  This film probably launched Chris Evans' career, so expect to see more of him in the future.There are a few short documentaries on the disk...including one on the way cell phones have transformed society.  It is surprisingly accurate, even down to some of the negatives associated with cell phone usage (people discussing the minutaie of their lives to the poor unfortunate souls on the other end of the line; people even using it while at a urinal--which I did happen to witness once and thought it crossed the line in cell phone etiquette).  Very fascinating documentary...cell phones are here to stay and I still haven't succumbed to the pressures of owning one (I guess I still value the idea of being ""unreachable"").",4,"When ""Speed"" Meets ""Phone Booth""",1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2064,"['saw', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'pitched', 'studios', 'Cellular', 'Speed', 'meets', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'exactly', 'what', 'Sure', 'suspense-film', 'formula', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'gimmick', 'one', 'cellular', 'phone', 'instead', 'phone', 'booth', 'bus', 'bomb', 'can', 'not', 'drop', '55', 'mph', 'still', 'interesting', 'premise', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'give', 'huge', 'credit', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'very', 'realistically', 'considering', 'practically', 'cell', 'phone', 'most', 'movie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'comments', 'are', 'fun', 'watch.Kim', 'Basinger', 'terrified', 'victim', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'yells', 'lot', 'few', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeves', 'as', 'well', 'relief', 'reveal', 'anything', 'more', 'film', 'would', 'spoil', 'plot', 'are', 'neat', 'twists', 'thrown', 'also', 'falling', 'prey', 'moments', 'predictability', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'suspense', 'action', 'film', 'lot', 'punch', 'short', '90', 'minute', 'duration', 'seeing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'personally', 'think', 'original', 'ending', 'was', 'better', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'longer', 'more', 'punch', 'Overall', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'remind', 'Speed', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'perfect', 'blend', 'film', 'probably', 'launched', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'career', 'so', 'expect', 'see', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'short', 'documentaries', 'disk', 'including', 'one', 'way', 'cell', 'phones', 'have', 'transformed', 'society', 'surprisingly', 'accurate', 'even', 'down', 'negatives', 'associated', 'cell', 'phone', 'usage', 'people', 'discussing', 'minutaie', 'lives', 'poor', 'unfortunate', 'souls', 'other', 'end', 'line', 'people', 'even', 'using', 'urinal', 'did', 'happen', 'witness', 'once', 'thought', 'crossed', 'line', 'cell', 'phone', 'etiquette', 'Very', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'cell', 'phones', 'are', 'here', 'stay', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'succumbed', 'pressures', 'owning', 'one', 'guess', 'still', 'value', 'idea', 'being', 'unreachable']",N/A

Leaving the question of whether they had they wrong family in the first place. Living her in a strange attic with only a broken telephone, she fixed it just enough to manage a call to whoever out there and a with sheer luck she managed to hit the right number to Ryan, a bystander stranger who managed to caught her call with his cellphone, thinking it's a prank call at first, but she managed to talked him into going to a police station to let her talk with a police officer.Time passes and her kidnappers visits her time to time, asking her the same question, increasing the stakes by taking her son hostage so she would tell them where her husband was at the moment. Most of the time, her secret phone call to ryan undiscovered. in the other end however, Ryan keeping pace as he race against time to either trying to rescue her son or her husband. In the process, he met Mooney (William H. Macy), a good cop, who slowly catch on with crime in process.

Good on the packagers.There were a few brilliant touches in the story line that I wont give away but they were perfect in light of the movie's title. (nudge nudge wink wink)  Basingers acting is great...very genuine, not something she's always done. The movie is also funny at times with that stupid lawyer in the mix....great bit of comic relief.  Overall this I felt was a brilliant idea and well executed. The only thing that might have been a bit over the top was the bad guys original actions that are the premice for the story in the first place. perhaps a more plausible bad guy story might have been chosen, but frankly it doesn't matter much, though it does make the danger of the situation that much more pressing.

865462,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0006D3HGA,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""Cellular"" is a race-against-the-clock thriller with a better-than-average gimmick.  Kim Bassinger plays a Brentwood mother who is kidnapped by a band of thugs and taken to a remote location.  When she finds a way to operate a damaged phone, she randomly calls a young man on his cell phone whom she convinces to help her thwart the bad guys in their scheme.  With Bassinger on the other end of the line, Chris Evans races madly around West Los Angeles in pursuit of the villains.There`s no doubt that, for it to work, ""Cellular"" requires a complete suspension of disbelief from its audience, but if you're willing to put yourself in the filmmakers' hands and go with it, you'll have a fun time.  There are enough twists and turns of the plot, enough car chases, and enough moments of unexpected humor to keep us from questioning the storyline too closely.  Evans is attractive and athletic as the unassuming hero and Bassinger pours on the tears as the frantic but resourceful innocent victim.  But it is William H. Macy, as a soon-to-be-retired police veteran, who does most of the real acting in the film.Sort of a cross between ""Speed"" and ""The Slender Thread,"" ""Cellular"" makes for a soothing and relaxing 90-minute break from the trials and travails of real life.",3,works well within its context,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,1269,"['Cellular', 'race-against-the-clock', 'thriller', 'better-than-average', 'gimmick', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'Brentwood', 'mother', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'band', 'thugs', 'taken', 'remote', 'location', 'When', 'way', 'operate', 'damaged', 'phone', 'randomly', 'young', 'man', 'cell', 'phone', 'whom', 'help', 'thwart', 'bad', 'guys', 'scheme', 'Bassinger', 'other', 'end', 'line', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'races', 'madly', 'West', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'pursuit', 'villains.There', 's', 'doubt', 'work', 'Cellular', 'complete', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'audience', ""'re"", 'willing', 'put', 'filmmakers', 'hands', 'go', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'are', 'enough', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'enough', 'car', 'chases', 'enough', 'moments', 'unexpected', 'humor', 'keep', 'questioning', 'storyline', 'too', 'closely', 'Evans', 'attractive', 'athletic', 'unassuming', 'hero', 'Bassinger', 'pours', 'tears', 'frantic', 'resourceful', 'innocent', 'victim', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'soon-to-be-retired', 'police', 'veteran', 'who', 'most', 'real', 'acting', 'film.Sort', 'cross', 'Speed', 'Slender', 'Thread', 'Cellular', 'soothing', 'relaxing', '90-minute', 'break', 'trials', 'travails', 'real', 'life']",N/A

A kidnapped woman is able to fix a broken telephone to the point where she can make a call to an unknown person.  My only problem is that I completely and utterly hate cell phone.  Everyone I see yapping on the phone at the stoplight, grocery story, bathroom, and virtually everywhere else, I just want to scream ""you are not that important that you need to contacted at any given moment.""  I only carry a cell phone when I drive just because my hoopie can give out on me at any given moment.  So needless to say, I had a bias against the film going in.The movie stars Kim Basinger, best known for Final Analysis, as the previously mention damsel in distress, while Chris Evans, who has such gems as Not Another Teen Movie and Fantastic Four on his resume, as the knight in shinning amour, except a sword he carries a cell phone that probably cost a couple hundred. Filling out the cast is William H Macy, challenging Samuel L Jackson for number of movies he's in regardless of quality, Jessica Biel as the token hot chick even though she rarely can fill the role properly, and Kim's husband is played by Susan Mayer's ex-husband.There were plenty of plot holes throughout the movie, the one that bugged me the most was the school schedules in the movie.  First the little kid gets out of school at 1:45, who actually get out that early.  Then his mother is a high school science teacher, yet she has enough time to walk to him to the bus stop and take a shower, and still not be late for school herself.  How much later does high school start after elementary school in California, in all the schools in my area, high school starts about an hour earlier?  And speaking of the shower, why didn't the housekeeper answer the phone while Kim was in there and even is she isn't allowed to answer it, why didn't she her the warning message?  But I did like how her science job helped her out later in the film.The movie also falls flat when it tries to interject humor into the script.  Kim's son having the same name as a cheesy singer just doesn't work and ruins the urgency of the moment and Evan's character being introduced as he was in a romantic comedy complete with a ex-girlfriend he wants to get back with and Stifler type sidekick also seems out of place too.  There were even more scenes of this included in the deleted scenes including a token performance this time by G Love.  The only thing that actually got me to chuckle was Macy's porn star mustache.  The movie also utilizes everything that could wrong with cell phones, tunnels, running out of juice, crossing signals, the latter being the most entertaining which involves a evil LA lawyer.",3,Don't Ever Call Me Again,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,2702,"['trailer', 'Cellular', 'looked', 'intriguing', 'kidnapped', 'woman', 'able', 'fix', 'broken', 'telephone', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'make', 'call', 'unknown', 'person', 'only', 'problem', 'completely', 'utterly', 'hate', 'cell', 'phone', 'Everyone', 'see', 'yapping', 'phone', 'stoplight', 'grocery', 'story', 'bathroom', 'virtually', 'everywhere', 'else', 'just', 'want', 'scream', 'are', 'not', 'important', 'need', 'contacted', 'given', 'moment', 'only', 'carry', 'cell', 'phone', 'when', 'drive', 'just', 'hoopie', 'can', 'give', 'out', 'given', 'moment', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'had', 'bias', 'film', 'going', 'in.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'best', 'known', 'Final', 'Analysis', 'previously', 'mention', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'who', 'such', 'gems', 'Not', 'Teen', 'Movie', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'resume', 'knight', 'shinning', 'amour', 'sword', 'cell', 'phone', 'probably', 'cost', 'couple', 'hundred', 'Filling', 'out', 'cast', 'William', 'H', 'Macy', 'challenging', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'number', 'movies', 'regardless', 'quality', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'token', 'hot', 'chick', 'even', 'rarely', 'can', 'fill', 'role', 'properly', 'Kim', 'husband', 'played', 'Susan', 'Mayer', 'ex-husband.There', 'were', 'plenty', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'one', 'bugged', 'most', 'was', 'school', 'schedules', 'movie', 'First', 'little', 'kid', 'school', '1:45', 'who', 'actually', 'get', 'out', 'early', 'Then', 'mother', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'yet', 'enough', 'time', 'walk', 'bus', 'stop', 'take', 'shower', 'still', 'not', 'be', 'late', 'school', 'How', 'much', 'later', 'high', 'school', 'start', 'elementary', 'school', 'California', 'schools', 'area', 'high', 'school', 'hour', 'earlier', 'speaking', 'shower', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'housekeeper', 'phone', 'Kim', 'was', 'even', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'answer', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'warning', 'message', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'science', 'job', 'helped', 'out', 'later', 'film.The', 'movie', 'also', 'flat', 'when', 'interject', 'humor', 'script', 'Kim', 'son', 'having', 'same', 'name', 'cheesy', 'singer', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'urgency', 'moment', 'Evan', 'character', 'being', 'introduced', 'was', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'complete', 'ex-girlfriend', 'get', 'back', 'Stifler', 'type', 'sidekick', 'also', 'place', 'too', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'scenes', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'token', 'performance', 'time', 'G', 'Love', 'only', 'thing', 'actually', 'got', 'chuckle', 'was', 'Macy', 'porn', 'star', 'mustache', 'movie', 'also', 'everything', 'could', 'wrong', 'cell', 'phones', 'tunnels', 'running', 'juice', 'crossing', 'signals', 'latter', 'being', 'most', 'entertaining', 'evil', 'LA', 'lawyer']",N/A

The finale happens on a beach that must be awefully compact because everyone ends up in the right place (even under a bridge during high tide) in a matter of moments.What can one say.

About 19 minutes.Dialing up Cellular (SD 1.78:1 ratio) Documentary making-of. Great footage about custom rigs and other events to making the movie. Over 25 minutes.3rd Documentary contains spoilers for those who haven't seen the movie. So I won't give any info. It's also good and about 27 minutes long.Other Extras include Commentary, Deleted Scenes in HD, and the HD Theatrical Trailer.I have tested all the features on both my PS3 and PC with software BD player. Subtitles and all features work as expected.NOTE: If you do not find my product reviews helpful. Please leave me a comment before marking my reviews as unhelpful.

This documentaty involves a dirty cop involved with stealing drugs from the evidence room of police headquarters and re-selling it on the street.

865474,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0006D3HGA,Tim Janson,"[2, 5]","The basic plot of cellular is an interesting one.  A woman is kidnapped and held captive in an attic but doesn't know where.  She manages to make a random call from a destroyed phone and reaches a man for help.  But how does he help her?  How does he find her?  Interesting concept for a thriller.Unfortunately the concept doesn't pay off so well in this fun but highly improbable thriller.  Kim Basinger plays the woman in question, Jessica Martin.  A Brentwood suburbanite science teacher who is kidnapped as the movie opens.  She's tossed into a dingy attic which happens to have an old-style dial phone.  But the kidnappers smash it with a sledgehammer.  But, with skill McGyver would envy, Jessica manages to tie wires together and tap them to make a call.  After several attempts, she finally reaches the cellphone of Ryan (Chris Evans), a self-absorbed 20 year old who was just dumped by his girlfriend Chloe (Jessica Biel in a surprisingly small role).Jessica mamages to convince Ryan that it isn't a hoax and Ryan goes to the police station for help.  William H. Macy plays the desk Sergeant Office Mooney who is on his last day of work before quitting to open a day spa!  Then begins an entire series of events so ridiculous that it stretches the boundry of believability until it tears in loud pop.  Mooney is about to take speak to Jessica when a fight breaks out between rival gang members sitting in the lobby.  Why were there gang members sitting in the lobby?  Evidently only to interrupt Mooney, who advises Ryan to go up to the fourth floor and see a detective.  But while in the stairwell, mere feet from the fourth floor door, Ryan starts to lose his signal.  If the call disconnects he knows he won't get Jessica back so he leaves WITHOUT talking to a cop.Now, my cell phone sometimes loses a signal in buildings, but I've never known it to get worse as I climbed stairs.  In fact, I've found usually the opposite is true.  Next we have the fact that Ryan's phone SHOULD have recorded the phone number of that incoming call, a fact he ignores now but uses in full later in the film when it's convenient.  Ryan then has to race to Jessica's son's school to prevent him from being kidnapped but gets held up and fails.  Then has to race to LAX and prevent Jessica's husband and fails.  He picks the wrong guy wearing a Lakers jacket, stupidly never even asking his name.Mooney visits the Martin home and a female member of the kidnappers poses as Jessica.  But this woman has an accent.  When Mooney calls later, the female voice on the answering machine has no accent so Mooney goes back to investigate and has a shootout with the false Jessica who turns out to be a cop.It all climaxes as impossibly as the rest of the movie as Mooney, a rather slight, fifty something year old cop manages to outfight bigger, stronger kidnappers half his age and the young Ryan also proves to be much smarter than the bad guys.  But that's just how the movie goes.  There are holes in the plot big enough to drive a bulldozer through.  The kidnappers are one-dimensional screen baddies who prove too stupid to rob a lemonade stand let alone pull off this crime.But to give credit where credit is due, the movie is fast-paced and whisks you off from the opening minutes and rarely slows down. They don't want to give you a chance to catch your breath and realize how dumb the film is I guess.  Chris Evans is particularly good as the reluctant hero Ryan and William H. Macy adds a needed bit of credibility and humor as Mooney.  Basinger however fluctuates from being the helpless victim to being much too smart for her captors.As a fast-paced thriller it works ok.  Fill those plot holes in with warm fuzzy thoughts.

They steal the family's Porsche SUV and stash her away in the attic of a safehouse as a prisoner. One of the thugs, played by Jason Statham (The Transporter), smashes the attic telephone with a sledgehammer, narrowly missing Jessica Martin's head. The scene is meant to intimidate her.Left alone, she manages to mend the phone enough to allow her to ""dial"" random numbers by touching a couple of wires together. She ends up connecting to the cell phone of Ryan, a seemingly unremarkable college-aged dude with a totally hot girlfriend who he's trying to stay with despite her disinterest in his juvenile ways. While running an errand to impress his girlfriend, Ryan receives a phone call from the captive Jessica Martin, a total stranger who he at first disbelieves. Ryan soon takes up Jessica's cause and stumbles through a series of misadventures in order to save her life.The supporting cast saves this film from being a dud. Rick Hoffman is absolutely hilarious as the slick, wanna-be woman-magnet lawyer who has his new Porsche carjacked by our hero. This guy needs to be in more films! William H. Macy plays a cop who is nearing retirement and dreams about opening up a day spa - a most unlikely career for a man to go into. As usual, Macy is superb, even in this lightweight film. Jason Statham is menacing, mean and intense as one of the key bad guys. He's not as charismatic as he was in the Guy Ritchie films, but he is a talent in need of a suitable film to launch his career to greater heights. Kim Basinger and her film family won't win any awards her, but she truly does look frazzled and worried.Sure, there are holes in the plot and scenes that are too contrived to be really believable, but this is not a dreadful film. Still, compared to superior movies like Collateral and Spartan, Cellular is formulaic and mostly forgettable.

865476,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006D3HGA,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","'Cellular' is based on the story by the underrated B-movie maestro Larry Cohen, who previously wrote the script of 'Phone Booth.'  This new one starring Kim Basinger and Chris Evans is as incredible and thrilling as that Colin Farrell thriller.  Some say, perhaps with good reasons, that 'Cellular' is improbable.  I say, yes it is, and that's why it is so good.Larry Cohen's story (scripted by Chris Morgan) is simple. Sciense teacher at high school Jessica (Basinger) is kidnapped by hoods breaking into her house, and is confined in a small room.  The only connection with the outer world is an old  telephone, which the leader of the kidnappers (Jason Statham) smashes into pieces.But, Jessica reassembles the debris, and tries to make a call outside, and finally one Californian boy Ryan (perfect Evans) receives it.  Over the phone, Jessica pleads him to listen and give her a help.  But will he be convinced of the words of Jessica, total stranger to him?  And if so, how?The film often gets silly, but somehow manages to keep on going without losing the fast-paced thrills.  The director David R. Ellis ('Final Destinations 2') did a fine job in constantly providing new premises in the plot, and though you see car chases and shoot-outs, the film does not rely on them when it wants to be most entertaining.This is an unusual choice for Kim Basinger, but she is very good as the kidnapped mother, and Chris Evans gives star-making performance as Ryan, to whom every audience will relate.  But, as you know, when William H. Macy shows up as a dogged cop, and is even allowed to shoot like in a John Woo films, he gets the best prize.'Cellular' gets more and more contrived as it goes on, and there are too many plot holes in the script, but each set-piece is well-crafted, and it is very enjoyable to experience the thrill ride.",4,Implausible But Enjoyable thrill Ride,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,1836,"[""'Cellular"", 'based', 'story', 'underrated', 'B-movie', 'maestro', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'who', 'previously', 'wrote', 'script', ""'Phone"", 'Booth', 'new', 'one', 'starring', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'incredible', 'thrilling', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'thriller', 'say', 'perhaps', 'good', 'reasons', ""'Cellular"", 'improbable', 'say', 'yes', 'why', 'so', 'good.Larry', 'Cohen', 'story', 'scripted', 'Chris', 'Morgan', 'simple', 'Sciense', 'teacher', 'high', 'school', 'Jessica', 'Basinger', 'kidnapped', 'hoods', 'breaking', 'house', 'confined', 'small', 'room', 'only', 'connection', 'outer', 'world', 'old', 'telephone', 'leader', 'kidnappers', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'pieces.But', 'Jessica', 'debris', 'tries', 'make', 'call', 'finally', 'one', 'Californian', 'boy', 'Ryan', 'perfect', 'Evans', 'phone', 'Jessica', 'listen', 'give', 'help', 'will', 'be', 'convinced', 'words', 'Jessica', 'total', 'stranger', 'so', 'how', 'film', 'often', 'silly', 'somehow', 'keep', 'going', 'losing', 'fast-paced', 'thrills', 'director', 'David', 'R.', 'Ellis', ""'Final"", 'Destinations', '2', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'constantly', 'providing', 'new', 'premises', 'plot', 'see', 'car', 'chases', 'shoot-outs', 'film', 'not', 'rely', 'when', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining.This', 'unusual', 'choice', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'very', 'good', 'kidnapped', 'mother', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'star-making', 'performance', 'Ryan', 'whom', 'audience', 'will', 'relate', 'know', 'when', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'up', 'dogged', 'cop', 'even', 'allowed', 'shoot', 'John', 'Woo', 'films', 'best', 'prize', 'more', 'more', 'contrived', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'script', 'set-piece', 'well-crafted', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'thrill', 'ride']",N/A
865477,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0006D3HGA,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 4]","Sometimes I watch a movie and it turns out to be far more entertaining than I thought it would be. Such is the case with CELLULAR. I had seen the ads for the film and even though it starred Kim Bassinger, I thought that the movie wasn't going to be entertaining at all.  My brother had seen the movie when it came out in theatres and had enjoyed it immensely; he as especially intrigued by the ""average citizen becoming a hero"" angle.  When I borrowed the movie from him to watch, I tried my best to put my predispositions aside and suspended my disbelief.  I surprisingly found myself becoming immersed in an action-packed and suspenseful story.CELLULAR takes places in the showy and flashy wealthy environment of Southern California.  Jessica Martin (Kim Bassinger) is a high school science teacher who lives with her realtor husband and son in the L.A. suburb of Brentwood.  After dropping her son off at school, Jessica's home is invaded by a gang of thugs, her housekeeper is shot, and she is kidnapped and taken hostage.  The kidnappers want something her husband has and she has no idea what it is.  The criminals lock her in the attic and smash the building's only phone as they plan to later kidnap both her son and her husband.  Jessica must teach at a private high school because she is able to scrounge together the parts and revive them into a working telephone.  She is only able to call blindly and reaches a self-absorbed, young, and immature kid named Ryan (Chris Evans) who is cruising down Venice Beach on an errand for his ex-girl friend in an attempt to win her back.  At first Ryan thinks the call is a joke, but he soon becomes convinced and attempts to help Jessica as best he can.  Thus begins a lengthy adventure of car chases, attempted killings, more kidnappings, uncaring salespeople, a carjacking, people playing their car stereos too loud, and crooked cops for Ryan all while trying to maintain a constant conversation with Jessica via his cell phone.The basic concept of CELLULAR seems incredulous at first.  However, it works rather well.  Cell phones have become ubiquitous in our modern society (except I don't have one yet) and as far fetched as some of the events in movie seem at first, the more one thinks about the situation the more credible the idea becomes.  The film's writer, Larry Cohen, also wrote the movie PHONE BOOTH.  This movie tackles some of the same issues that were touched upon in that film, but fleshes them out a bit.  Should Cohen decide to write another movie about communication devices it could very well be a sensation.Perhaps another reason that CELLULAR works so well is because of the acting.  Even if you have no desire to see the movie because of the concept, see the film because of Kim Bassinger and William H. Macy, who plays a good cop named Mooney who is preparing to retire from the force.  Bassinger is lovely to watch and her portrayal of a kidnapped mother is convincing.  Macy brings a lot of humanity and humor to a character that could have been rather dry and dull in the hands of a lesser actor.  Chris Evans also does a decent job and seems to mature as an actor as his character matures as a person on screen.  Some of that might be because Evans ended up doing almost all of his own stunts in the film.Overall, I really enjoyed watching CELLULAR.  It's not necessarily a great movie, but it is a good action/suspense/thriller that isn't a waster of one's time.The DVD includes three documentaries, an audio commentary, and a trailer.  I found the documentaries informative and engaging.  One, ""Calling Out"" is on the history of telephones and how cellular phones have and are continuing to change society.  ""Dialing Up Cellular"" is about the making of the film.  ""Code of Silence: Inside the Rampart Scandal"" is about a 1999 LAPD corruption scandal.

865479,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B0006D3HGA,William Hare,"[14, 23]","When Alfred Hitchcock approached his last film, ""Family Plot"", he held an international video news conference from Universal Studios.  He patiently explained how the film consisted of two stories that intersected.  In the case of ""Cellular"" this applies, with the stories being threaded together by cell phones.Kim Basinger is a yuppie Brentwood housewife whose husband is a realtor.  Her son is 14 and attends a private school in nearby Westwood.  She is astonished when a group of hoodlums break into her home and kill her housekeeper.  They then throw her into a garage and lock the door, destroying her telephone connection.Frightened that her husband and son are about to be killed in what she is convinced is a mistake, she pieces wires together until she is able to make a cell phone call.  The person on the other end of the line is irresponsible early twenty-something beach kid Chris Evans, who, until Basinger suddenly enters his world, is concerned about little else beyond getting back together with the girlfriend who has broken up with him because she believes he is immature and irresponsible.When the hoodlums find and abduct Basinger's husband at Los Angeles International Airport she learns that the abductions are anything but a mistake.  Basinger's husband is in possession of incriminating evidence.Evans grows up fast under great duress as he seeks to save Basinger's life.  The hoodlums are cops gone bad who are hell bent on retrieving the incriminating piece of evidence.  To tell more would be to give away important details of a non-stop action thriller set mainly in the Santa Monica area, with some of the climactic moments of the film occurring at Venice Pier.William Macy is about to quit the police force out of boredom and start a day spa with his wife, who is heavily into new age rejuvenation creams.  When Evans enters his life he forgets what boredom was and concentrates on saving some intended victims from homicidal desperados because they know too much.Larry Cohen was the perfect person to write this story since his previous effort ""Phone Booth"" was also spun around talk technology.  Director David Ellis was an ideal choice with his background as a second unit director and stunt coordinator.  This film has enough action twists and turns to last a long time.At the film's end an exhausted Evans implores Basinger, ""Please don't call me again.""  She relieves tension by laughing as they feel relief over barely escaping with their lives.",3,Two Stories Threaded by a Cell Phone,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,2483,"['When', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'approached', 'last', 'film', 'Family', 'Plot', 'held', 'international', 'video', 'news', 'conference', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'patiently', 'explained', 'how', 'film', 'consisted', 'two', 'stories', 'intersected', 'case', 'Cellular', 'applies', 'stories', 'being', 'threaded', 'together', 'cell', 'phones.Kim', 'Basinger', 'yuppie', 'Brentwood', 'housewife', 'husband', 'realtor', 'son', '14', 'private', 'school', 'nearby', 'Westwood', 'astonished', 'when', 'group', 'hoodlums', 'break', 'home', 'kill', 'housekeeper', 'then', 'throw', 'garage', 'lock', 'door', 'destroying', 'telephone', 'connection.Frightened', 'husband', 'son', 'are', 'be', 'killed', 'what', 'convinced', 'mistake', 'together', 'able', 'make', 'cell', 'phone', 'call', 'person', 'other', 'end', 'line', 'irresponsible', 'early', 'twenty-something', 'beach', 'kid', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'who', 'Basinger', 'suddenly', 'world', 'concerned', 'little', 'else', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'broken', 'up', 'immature', 'irresponsible.When', 'hoodlums', 'find', 'abduct', 'Basinger', 'husband', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'International', 'Airport', 'abductions', 'are', 'anything', 'mistake', 'Basinger', 'husband', 'possession', 'incriminating', 'evidence.Evans', 'fast', 'great', 'duress', 'save', 'Basinger', 'life', 'hoodlums', 'are', 'gone', 'bad', 'who', 'are', 'hell', 'bent', 'retrieving', 'incriminating', 'piece', 'evidence', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'away', 'important', 'details', 'non-stop', 'action', 'thriller', 'set', 'mainly', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'area', 'climactic', 'moments', 'film', 'occurring', 'Venice', 'Pier.William', 'Macy', 'quit', 'police', 'force', 'boredom', 'start', 'day', 'spa', 'wife', 'who', 'heavily', 'new', 'age', 'rejuvenation', 'creams', 'When', 'Evans', 'life', 'what', 'boredom', 'was', 'concentrates', 'saving', 'intended', 'victims', 'homicidal', 'desperados', 'know', 'too', 'much.Larry', 'Cohen', 'was', 'perfect', 'person', 'write', 'story', 'previous', 'effort', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'was', 'also', 'spun', 'around', 'talk', 'technology', 'Director', 'David', 'Ellis', 'was', 'ideal', 'choice', 'background', 'second', 'unit', 'director', 'stunt', 'coordinator', 'film', 'enough', 'action', 'twists', 'last', 'long', 'time.At', 'film', 'end', 'exhausted', 'Evans', 'implores', 'Basinger', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'again', 'tension', 'laughing', 'feel', 'relief', 'barely', 'escaping', 'lives']",N/A
865480,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B0006D3HGA,Wisconsin Dad,"[1, 5]","Cellular is a story of a school teacher named Jessica, played by Kim Basinger, who is kidnapped (seemingly for no reason) out of her house after dropping her son off for school. Jessica is thrown into a locked attic where she soon pieces together a smashed phone and dials a random number. The random number she dials reaches a cell phone owned by Ryan (Chris Evans). Ryan proceeds to do everything within his power to save Jessica, and in doing so the mystery as to why she was kidnapped is revealed.The movie moves fast, has some intrigue, but carries very few twists and turns. There is one huge twist in Cellular, and that is revealed fairly early on. After that. it is mainly a movie about Ryan and Jessica, and whether they can work together to rescue Jessica.The story lacks real depth, and the characters lack any real flavor. They could have been any character with any background and the movie would not have changed.The acting was OK. Chris Evans and William Macy held the movie together. Without them it would have flopped, and would have been horrendous. Kim Basinger was at times very good, and at times very unbelievable. The only other cast member that played a significant role in the film was Rick Hoffman. Rick was tremendously entertaining to watch, and has a powerful command on screen. Every line he says either leaves you laughing or angry, or both.Over all the movie had many weak points and was utterly forgettable. But, with that said,it was an OK diversion for 2 hours. If you are looking for a thriller, Cellular is decent entertainment, but not a great film.You will watch it, at times enjoy it, at times be bored by it, and by tomorrow you will forget it. You will not buy it, and  won't go out of your way to recommend it.Total Score (out of 100) = 3821 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.6 (out of 10). Acting.
