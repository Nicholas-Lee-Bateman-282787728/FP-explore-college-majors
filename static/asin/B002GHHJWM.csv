1267500,A2P2HDYS3LTAQP,B002GHHJWM,J.S.,"[0, 3]","I love comedy albums/performances, and yet it's rare that a comic can come up with 60+ minutes of truly prime material every six months, or a even a year or more. Patton Oswalt (Ratatouille, Big Fan) is operating on a rare level these days, and this show from Washington, D.C. in 2009 displays him at a career peak; he kills with every joke and story, managing to blend fannish/nerdish obsessiveness with the American, everyday humdrummery. In my book, the late George Carlin remains the standup Gold Standard, David Cross's vitriol is sidesplitting and utterly essential, and Henry Rollins's ease at humorous storytelling makes him always worth seeing, but Oswalt is firmly in their company -- he creates albums that bear repeat listens, and have provided me and my friends with fits of laughter. LOLLIPOPS and FEELIN' both had their moments, but this is Oswalt at his most consistent.",5,"Fantastic, intelligent comedy",1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,886,"['love', 'comedy', 'albums/performances', 'yet', 'rare', 'comic', 'can', 'come', 'up', '60+', 'minutes', 'truly', 'prime', 'material', 'six', 'months', 'even', 'year', 'more', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Ratatouille', 'Big', 'Fan', 'operating', 'rare', 'level', 'days', 'show', 'Washington', 'D.C.', '2009', 'displays', 'career', 'peak', 'joke', 'story', 'managing', 'blend', 'fannish/nerdish', 'obsessiveness', 'American', 'everyday', 'humdrummery', 'book', 'late', 'George', 'Carlin', 'standup', 'Gold', 'Standard', 'David', 'Cross', 'vitriol', 'sidesplitting', 'utterly', 'essential', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'ease', 'humorous', 'storytelling', 'always', 'seeing', 'Oswalt', 'firmly', 'company', 'albums', 'bear', 'repeat', 'listens', 'have', 'provided', 'friends', 'fits', 'laughter', 'LOLLIPOPS', 'FEELIN', 'had', 'moments', 'Oswalt', 'most', 'consistent']",Patton Oswalt: My Weakness Is Strong
1267501,A3F19JZZ07PDX0,B002GHHJWM,Philippe Landry,"[9, 15]","Patton is known for deriding the stale droves of comics that overpopulated the late-80s/early-90s but when he went into his bit on the rigors of flying I thought I was watching Stand-Up Spotlight with Rosie O'Donnell. Seriously? Flying an airplane is annoying? I think I've heard this bit a millions times. Also, his references to depression, drugs and drinking make this an awkward set: He may be laughing at it but I just feel sorry for him in a way. The references to domestic life dull his edge as well. Most of all, the ""Bush bad/Obama good"" stuff is kinda played.It seems like instead of being Patton Oswalt he's just doing what it takes to be Patton Oswalt, i.e. making a joke and then sprinkling some reference to Tom Waits or whatever other indie musician to make the ""alternative comedy"" connection. It's like he's finally realized how to hit his mark, with his delivery becoming less slick and more like a formula. Maybe it's because this set was done in a theatre for Comedy Central rather than at places like the 40 Watt that it feels so out of place from his regular stuff. I had been watching his new sets from the Purple Onion and Amoeba and heard the Frankensteins & Gumdrops EP and was getting really excited because I was expecting all of that awesome material to be on his next album, especially the bit about Daniel Plainview being a phone sex operator. Except for the Family Crest bit NONE OF IT MADE IT TO THIS SET!After David Cross became the worst comedian ever with his constant arrogant whining Patton Oswalt was a breath of fresh air, bereft of all the preachy posturing. His impish self-deprecation and perverse witticisms knew no bounds. Now his set is becoming a self-loathing hatefest filled with creepy anxiety and banality. At least we have Feelin' Kinda Patton and Werewolves & Lollipops.Fare thee well, sailor! Sail the sea of fame, but come home soon!",3,Airplane humor?

1267503,AQY5XBYSENNZQ,B002GHHJWM,Quickbeam,"[7, 8]","I'm a fan so I had pre-ordered this DVD, not realizing the special would be on TV. So, I felt sort of consumer duped at first. However, the DVD/CDs have bits that weren't on the Comedy Central airing so yea! me.I've been a comedy fan since the 70's so I'm old and I know what I like/don't like. I have come to find that when my beloved favorite comedians find love/children, their acts circle the drain. I don't begrudge them happiness as people but it really screws with the funny.This special is far more into the love/children/personal demons area than I like. Oswalt tries to snark it up but it doesn't always work. Far too often I found myself saying ""oh, gee...Patton is depressed?...."" or ""really, he took acid?..."" and hurting for him rather than finding the follow up humor funny. He's a winsome guy, painfully bright and I missed the balls-to-the-wall bitter insight.That being said, second rate Patton is better than anything else out there right now. If he toured the midwest I'd drive many hundreds of miles to see a show. I appreciate that he makes so much of his work available. And I'm a completist so it is worth it to me to have it ALL.Oswalt is a master of wordplay and I can't hear things like ""a sheetcake of victory"" enough. There were a lot of laughs on this DVD. I hope he can wrest himself out of the domesticity issues to tease apart his act from his home life in the future. I need my Patton a little sharper edged.The extras are pretty funny and Patton clearly has friends who will do anything for him (Jon Hamm!)",4,"Classic Patton, why the DVD is worth it....",1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,1541,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'so', 'had', 'pre-ordered', 'DVD', 'not', 'realizing', 'special', 'would', 'be', 'TV', 'So', 'felt', 'sort', 'consumer', 'duped', 'first', 'However', 'DVD/CDs', 'have', 'bits', 'were', ""n't"", 'Comedy', 'Central', 'airing', 'so', 'yea', 'me.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'comedy', 'fan', '70', 'so', ""'m"", 'old', 'know', 'what', 'like/do', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'find', 'when', 'beloved', 'favorite', 'comedians', 'find', 'love/children', 'acts', 'circle', 'drain', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'happiness', 'people', 'really', 'funny.This', 'special', 'far', 'more', 'love/children/personal', 'demons', 'area', 'like', 'Oswalt', 'snark', 'up', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'Far', 'too', 'often', 'found', 'saying', 'oh', 'gee', 'Patton', 'depressed', 'really', 'took', 'acid', 'hurting', 'rather', 'finding', 'follow', 'up', 'humor', 'funny', 'winsome', 'guy', 'painfully', 'bright', 'missed', 'balls-to-the-wall', 'bitter', 'being', 'said', 'second', 'rate', 'Patton', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'toured', 'midwest', ""'d"", 'drive', 'many', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'see', 'show', 'appreciate', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'available', ""'m"", 'completist', 'worth', 'have', 'ALL.Oswalt', 'master', 'wordplay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'things', 'sheetcake', 'victory', 'enough', 'were', 'lot', 'laughs', 'DVD', 'hope', 'can', 'wrest', 'domesticity', 'issues', 'tease', 'apart', 'act', 'home', 'life', 'future', 'need', 'Patton', 'little', 'sharper', 'edged.The', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Patton', 'clearly', 'friends', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'Jon', 'Hamm']",Patton Oswalt: My Weakness Is Strong
