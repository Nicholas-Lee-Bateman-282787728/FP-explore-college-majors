But one of their first stops is Las Vegas where Hagerty loses all their savings in one of the casinos. They try to get their money back from the casino, which is a wildly funny scene filled with irony as Brooks uses all the skills he ever mustered out in California in his job. He fails, of course. They go to Arizona and take menial jobs, but eventually make their way to NYC where Brooks takes a job with his old company. The end might seem a cop-out, but not if the message is you can't try to be something you're not.

If they had skirted Las Vegas, this wouldn't have happened, and the movie wouldn't have had much of a story.Pure genius would have been having the inherent contradictions in their ""plan"" -- instead of the fortuitous gambling problem -- slowly unhorse them:  being nickled and dimed to death on RV repairs, rent, food, medical expenses, moving violations, dental bills, etc.  Until they're virtually run into the ground and forced to live at subsistence level in some unpleasant climate.  This would have definitely been a hilarious and far-reaching ""message.""As it was, though, really the only reason their big scheme went awry was almost sheer randomness: it turned out the wife had an undiagnosed gambling problem.  I maintain this is a fatal flaw in the execution of (what I take to be) Brooks's vision, since, without this having happened, we as viewers do not see how things were inevitably going to go wrong.

108044,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0790740680,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","It's been almost twenty years since I last saw this 1985 movie, but it remains Albert Brooks' funniest and most scathing in its view of the pretensions of yuppie America in the mid-1980's. In a screenplay co-written with Monica Johnson, Brooks portrays David Howard, an over-the-top ambitious, Type-A creative director at a big advertising agency in LA. Upon being bypassed for a big promotion in a hilariously biting scene, he decides to shuck it all, including a new expensive home he just bought, and convince his wife Linda to join him on a cross-country journey to ""touch Indians"" in a bid to capture an ""Easy Rider""-type escape fantasy. In typically insulated fashion, Brooks cannot let go of all his materialistic tendencies, as he decides to do it in an oversized Winnebago with all the amenities and a nest egg of $150K. What he doesn't realize is that Linda was feeling even more trapped by their possession-oriented lifestyle and in a night of cathartic release, loses almost all their money at the roulette table at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas.How David and Linda deal with their sudden downward mobility provides the film's funniest moments: David's ad-man pitch to the Desert Inn casino owner (played with amiably controlled ferocity by director Garry Marshall) to get his money back; interviews with a baffled drug store owner and an equally baffled unemployment counselor in the small Arizona town where they park their mobile home; David humiliated, angry and envious as a school crossing guard; and the teen-aged Der Wienerschnitzel manager praising Linda to David on her detection of frozen French fries in the deep fryer. Some of the dialogue is priceless, especially when David explains to Linda how she can never utter the words ""nest"" and ""egg"" ever again. Brooks also inserts hilarious catchphrases like ""Mercedes leather"" and ""a hundred thousand dollars!"" with comic precision. My favorite line is David's self-description to the casino boss...""I'm a high-paid advertising consultant. These are professional opinions you're getting.""As an actor, Brooks' persona is as acerbic as ever and luckily doesn't have the somewhat gooey softening that came later with ""Defending Your Life"" and ""Mother"". Still fresh off her hilarious ""Airplane"" movies, Julie Hagerty plays Linda with that same wonderful sense of bewilderment that fits her character here, especially in the face of David's post-Vegas meltdown at Hoover Dam as she is pressured to be the voice of reason. The one problem I have with the movie - and it's a rather significant one - is that it stops rather abruptly with the couple hauling their Winnebago to New York where he is literally chasing the job he felt was beneath him before. It just feels like there is some personal revelation missing, and instead, Brooks went for an extended sight gag. That's too bad because Brooks the filmmaker manages the difficult feat of having us empathize with this couple misdirected by ideals they never really had and expectations of themselves that were unrealistic given their value system. By the way, this also happens to be Brooks' most cinematic movie with wonderfully composed shots, especially of the mobile home traveling through the breathtaking southwest.

108047,A23JNLBAE18XO0,0790740680,Frank R. Schoonover,"[1, 1]","Lost In America, a 1985 movie directed by Albert Brooks, is a very good American movie and one of the best films that the 1980's had to offer. The film was co-written by Brooks with Monica Johnson and stars Brooks alongside his then girlfriend Julie Hagerty as his wife Linda and has a special appearance by Garry Marshall as the CEO of the casino in Las Vegas, which became their first stop.It all starts with David and Linda Howard making plans preceding a hoped for promotion at the advertising agency that David works for. But after insulting his boss, when he doesn't get the promotion but a transfer to New York City instead, David is fired from his job and convinces his wife to quit her job at a woman's clothing store and they sell everything, buy a Winnebago and decide to hit the road to discover America and what America is really all about. They have a giant nest egg of $144,000 tucked away nicely and in easy reach in the motor home.Things go awry after their stop in Vegas to renew their wedding vows. Linda gambles almost all of their money away(a reversal of fortune here. Usually it's the husband who gambles the money away in these situations, not the wife. The wife is usually the smarter one of the two)and after a pretty amusing scene where the husband fails to talk the CEO of the casino,(cameo by Garry Marshall), into refunding all of their money that was lost in the casino, which is when the comedy really begins and is one of the films funniest moments, they take off and seperate after a real wing dinger at the Hoover Dam, which is another one of the films funniest moments, and than get back together and wind up in Arizona where they both get jobs. Linda at a fast food restaurant and David as a crossing guard, where he is taunted by kids left and right, which is another of the films funniest moments, and gives David a sheer lesson in anger management. Another funny moment was when the motorcycle cop pulls David and Linda over for doing over 80 miles in a 55 Mile Per Hour Zone where Linda talks the motorcycle cop out of giving them a speeding ticket by saying that her husband has based his whole life on the movie Easy Rider and David telling him that he looks like The Terminator.  For those of you who haven't seen this very good comedy drama film as of yet, I won't spoil it for any of you. I will say that this movie has more references to the cult classic Easy Rider than any other movie in memory.Lost In America is for those who have always wondered what it would be really like to drop out of society and see how those on the outside of society live. It is also for those who ever thought that they had good luck that actually turned out all bad in the end and even when you feel that you lost everything, you never really do if you have love right in front of you and that love is better than nothing and more valuable than all the money in the world.Brooks really works wonders both behind and in front of the camera. He and Hagerty make a great team as the husband and wife who yearn for freedom and later finding out that true love and intimacy, with that special person in your life, is better than anything else the world has to offer. The chemistry between Brooks and Hagerty is really overwhelming and is the main highlight of the film and it does indeed work out great. Albert Brooks really is a very talented film maker, actor and a very talented comedian. Lost In America proves this in more ways than one.Not only that, this film was a commercial success, though it wasn't a blockbuster. The film was also well received by critics.I first saw this movie back in 1986 on HBO when I was 16. I watched this movie at my sister's house and, though I was 16 years old at the time, I thought that it was a wonderful movie and I really enjoyed it. After buying the DVD in 2008 from Amazon, I watched it again and I still enjoyed the film as much as I did when I first saw it. Lost In America is a very good American film and it is not only one of the best films of the 1980's, it also shows that there are still film makers in the United States of America that still know how to make a very good film. Albert Brooks may never take on the world by storm, but I will take Albert Brooks over Woody Allen anyday. Yes I would.The digitally mastered DVD has the movie looking beautiful with all the colors blending in very well.

Fun begins with Albert  not getting the promotion he thinks he deserves and talks his wife (played  by Airplane's Julie Haggerty) into not moving into a new house- rather, buy  a Winebago and &quot;touch Indians&quot; for the rest of their lives. A  stop in Las Vegas to renew wedding vows turns the dream life into a  disatster, as Haggerty blows there savings at the roulette table  (&quot;22&quot;)  What follows is how they come to terms with this event  and how they try to piece their life together in a trailor park in the  Southwest- the only place they have enough money to buy gas to get to.  A  scene when Brooks confronts Haggerty on &quot;breaking the nest egg&quot;  is certainly one of the funniest exchanges in movie history. Brooks is  blessed with a keen perceptual sense and his &quot;high brow&quot; humor is  not to be missed. His ties to producer Janes Brooks (co-creator of  &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and cameo role in Brooks' &quot;Modern  Romance&quot;) reflect that.  This is a must for any video library.

Albert is an up and coming, mobile advertiser with a large firm. He is counting his money and making plans,expecting a big promotion. Except what he is offered is a lateral move to New YorkCity. He is highly offended and acts out, losing his job. He talks his wife, Julie Hagearty into quitting her job, and like the 'Easy Rider',they hit the road looking for adventure. Adventure they find, but not what they expected.After losing their money they end up in Arizona. Albert works a crossing guard for $5.50'an hour, and his wife is an Assistant Manager in a frankfurter fast food. Her boss is half her age. Neither is satisfied and after a short discussion, they jettison their plans for a new direction.This is a funny film, lots of laughs, but then lots of emotion. Working your way up the corporate ladder, wanting more things and more money. Is it enough? Is this what life is all about, living in a Winnebaggo,traveling the highways?Albert Brooks has long been a comedian I admire. He is full of irony and terrific stories.

108071,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790740680,Reviewer,"[21, 24]","Without question, Albert Brooks is the absolute master of subtle humor. In ""Lost In America,"" the writer-director-star weaves an hilarious tapestry that is no less than a paean to an entire generation of Yuppies.  When  David Howard (Brooks), the creative director for one of the largest  advertising agencies in the world, fails to get the promotion he's ""waited  his whole life for,"" he quits his job (""Well, I got fired, but it's the  same thing-""), then convinces his wife, Linda (Julie Hagerty), to do the  same.  They then proceed to sell their house, liquidate all their assets  (""We got a ride on the inflation train you would not believe,""), buy a  thirty-foot motor home and drop out of society in order to ""find""  themselves.  Patterning himself after the guys in ""Easy Rider,"" David's  plan is for them to set off across America, to ""Touch Indians, see the  mountains and the prairies and all the rest of that song,"" and they leave  Los Angeles with a new motor home, a substantial nest egg and an anxious  sense of adventure.  It all soon goes awry, of course, and what follows are  some of the funniest scenes you'll ever see in an intelligent comedy.  Among the most memorable are the ones with Michael Greene (As David's  boss), when he informs David that instead of a promotion he's being  transferred to New York to work on their latest acquisition, Ford (""We got  trucks, too.""); one with Garry Marshall (As a casino manager in Las Vegas);  and finally, the scene in which David explains the concept of the ""nest  egg"" to Linda, which has to be, historically, one of the classic comedy  scenes of all time.  The solid supporting cast includes Tom Tarpey (Brad  Tooey, the ""bald-headed man from New York""), Ernie Brown, Art Frankel,  Charles Boswell and Joey Coleman.  Written by Brooks and Monica Johnson,  ""Lost In America"" is a timeless comedy classic that can be enjoyed over and  over again.",5,A Classic From the Master,953424000,"03 19, 2000",2000,1914,"['question', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'absolute', 'master', 'subtle', 'humor', 'Lost', 'America', 'writer-director-star', 'weaves', 'hilarious', 'tapestry', 'less', 'paean', 'entire', 'generation', 'Yuppies', 'When', 'David', 'Howard', 'Brooks', 'creative', 'director', 'one', 'largest', 'advertising', 'agencies', 'world', 'get', 'promotion', 'waited', 'whole', 'life', 'job', 'Well', 'got', 'fired', 'same', 'thing-', 'then', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Julie', 'Hagerty', 'do', 'same', 'then', 'proceed', 'sell', 'house', 'liquidate', 'assets', 'got', 'ride', 'inflation', 'train', 'would', 'not', 'believe', 'buy', 'thirty-foot', 'motor', 'home', 'drop', 'society', 'order', 'find', 'Patterning', 'guys', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'David', 'plan', 'set', 'off', 'America', 'Touch', 'Indians', 'see', 'mountains', 'prairies', 'rest', 'song', 'leave', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'new', 'motor', 'home', 'substantial', 'nest', 'egg', 'anxious', 'sense', 'adventure', 'soon', 'awry', 'course', 'what', 'are', 'funniest', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'most', 'memorable', 'are', 'ones', 'Michael', 'Greene', 'David', 'boss', 'when', 'David', 'instead', 'promotion', 'being', 'transferred', 'New', 'York', 'work', 'latest', 'acquisition', 'Ford', 'got', 'trucks', 'too', 'one', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'casino', 'manager', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'finally', 'scene', 'David', 'concept', 'nest', 'egg', 'Linda', 'be', 'historically', 'one', 'classic', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'time', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Tarpey', 'Brad', 'Tooey', 'bald-headed', 'man', 'New', 'York', 'Ernie', 'Brown', 'Art', 'Frankel', 'Charles', 'Boswell', 'Joey', 'Coleman', 'Written', 'Brooks', 'Monica', 'Johnson', 'Lost', 'America', 'timeless', 'comedy', 'classic', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'over', 'again']",N/A
