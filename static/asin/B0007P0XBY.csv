It spends about 10 minutes talking about the cause of the tsunamis and the measures taken by some countries to look out for the arrival of the next ones. However, it also states nobody knows these measures will save lives.Also, as reviewer, Himanshu Shangari, said it missed recent ones that hit Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan in March 2011. It's because this DVD was released in 2005.If I just wanted to know tsunami disasters happened in the past, I could have searched the Web for free.",2,"Waste of money and time because 90 percent of the time, it shows the interviews of Tsunami survivors from all over the word",1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,638,"['waste', 'money', 'time', '90', 'percent', 'time', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'Tsunami', 'survivors', 'world', '10', 'minutes', 'talking', 'cause', 'tsunamis', 'measures', 'taken', 'countries', 'look', 'out', 'arrival', 'next', 'ones', 'However', 'also', 'nobody', 'measures', 'will', 'save', 'lives.Also', 'reviewer', 'Himanshu', 'Shangari', 'said', 'missed', 'recent', 'ones', 'hit', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia', 'Japan', 'March', '2011', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', '2005.If', 'just', 'wanted', 'know', 'tsunami', 'disasters', 'happened', 'past', 'could', 'have', 'searched', 'Web', 'free']",National Geographic - Tsunami: Killer Wave
