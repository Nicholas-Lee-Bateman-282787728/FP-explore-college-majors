My copy is the ""Special Edition"" which includes a ""Making of..."" feature which is more than half the value of the DVD.The chief value of the movie proper is its' very, very beautiful and creative photography.But that has a drawback too as it is an overload of scenes of birds flying.Much of the flying footage is of various Geese species - no doubt because Geese are easy to ""imprint"" and thus unafraid of humans, camera and flying. Virtually all the birds photographed are larger species - Geese, Swans, pelagic birds, a couple land-oriented species (e.g. Western Grebes, Cranes, and Sage Grouse).You won't learn a tremendous amount about Migration but the movie and the ""Making of..."" trailer will provide you with considerable entertainment.",3,Very entertaining nnot overly Educational,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,793,"['Winged', 'Migration', 'DVD', 'Jacques', 'Perrin', 'copy', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Making', 'feature', 'more', 'value', 'DVD.The', 'chief', 'value', 'movie', 'proper', 'very', 'very', 'beautiful', 'creative', 'photography.But', 'drawback', 'too', 'overload', 'scenes', 'birds', 'flying.Much', 'flying', 'footage', 'various', 'Geese', 'species', 'doubt', 'Geese', 'are', 'easy', 'imprint', 'thus', 'unafraid', 'humans', 'camera', 'flying', 'Virtually', 'birds', 'photographed', 'are', 'larger', 'species', 'Geese', 'Swans', 'pelagic', 'birds', 'couple', 'land-oriented', 'species', 'e.g', 'Western', 'Grebes', 'Cranes', 'Sage', 'Grouse', '.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'Migration', 'movie', 'Making', 'trailer', 'will', 'provide', 'considerable', 'entertainment']",Winged Migration

776502,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0000CGNEH,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[3, 5]","Four years of film footage were edited to make this incredible film on the yearly migrations of birds, mostly the large water fowl, from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica, with North America, the Amazon and Africa in between. Facts about the flight patterns are briefly put on the screen, the longest journey followed is that of the Arctic tern, flying 12,500 miles. The panoramic scenery is spectacular, with a scene of an Arctic avalanche being very memorable. Yes, much of the film is manipulated, but the beauty of it is undeniable, and it's educational in the sense of seeing these birds in action, in their living and mating, and the miracle of their migrations.Not all of them make it, and it shows how some journeys are cut short by predators, whether shot down, or eaten by a larger creature, or in the case of a tern with a broken wing, getting attacked and devoured by a hoard of crabs. Some of these depictions are devised to tug on our heart strings, and might not be suitable for young children, like the unfortunate goose that gets stuck in urban sludge, and another bird whose nest is in the path of a threshing machine. The filmmakers state that the tern and goose were rescued after the scenes was shot, and one assumes that the thresher was hopefully stopped in time.The pelicans in Africa, brilliantly colored parrots in the Amazon region, and penguins in Antarctica are unforgettable. The greater sage grouse, with spiked tail in all his glory strutting his stuff in Idaho, and the Northern gannet diving into the Arctic sea, looking more like a missile than a bird are also images that stay in one's mind. This film was directed by Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud, with a crew of fifteen cinematographers, among them Thierry Machado, and it has a lovely peaceful score by Bruno Coulais. Both Machado and Coulais were part of the creative force behind the mesmerizing 1996 ""Microcosmos."" Narrated by Philippe Labro, ""Winged Migration"" has won many awards, and was nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar.

You are likely to be awed by these images, and wonder ""how did they film this"" all the time. Unfortunately, I also had a few reservations: one (a minor, perhaps) is that the documentary is a bit too long, even for the most enthusiasts of bird lovers. Second, the version I saw was dubbed in a very strongly accented english, which was distractive. Third (and perhaps more seriously), some of the sequences are obviously staged (for example, a parrot escaping from a cage in the Amazon): for a movie that purports to be a documentary, seeing something to be staged is an obvious disappointment. These criticisms aside, I believe this movie is very much worthwhile watching.",4,"Fine documentary, with a few reservations",1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,786,"['fine', 'french', 'documentary', 'migratory', 'birds', 'same', 'team', 'made', 'insect', 'documentary', 'Microcosmos', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'awed', 'images', 'wonder', 'how', 'did', 'film', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'had', 'few', 'reservations', 'one', 'minor', 'perhaps', 'documentary', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'even', 'most', 'enthusiasts', 'bird', 'lovers', 'Second', 'version', 'saw', 'was', 'dubbed', 'very', 'strongly', 'accented', 'english', 'was', 'distractive', 'Third', 'perhaps', 'more', 'seriously', 'sequences', 'are', 'obviously', 'staged', 'example', 'parrot', 'escaping', 'cage', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'be', 'documentary', 'seeing', 'something', 'be', 'staged', 'obvious', 'disappointment', 'criticisms', 'aside', 'believe', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'watching']",Winged Migration

Rogers,"[2, 3]","My lovely bride and I were fortunate to see this at the Seattle Film Festival, and were very impressed by the scope and achievement of this work. Seeing it on DVD would be nice, but I can't imagine it would compare at all to the experience of seeing it on the big screen.The filmmakers spent three years collecting their amazing images of all types of birds migrating north to south and back again (the Wall Street Journal had an article about how they did it; I seem to recall it involved a lot of graduate students). What they've put together is a wonderful example of what the cinematographic art can do when not encumbered by special effects, computer animation, or even much of a narrative line. The timeless, God-ordained patterns of migration are enough of a plot to drive 90 minutes of great visuals. There's a surprising mix here of drama, humor, choreography, some danger, some death, and mesmerizing images of huge flocks swooping and diving as one.An hour and a half of bird pictures might sound pretty snooze-inducing to a lot of people, but don't compare this to run-of-the-mill nature documentaries on TV. It's something quite different, and even folks who aren't particularly into birds or nature films should probably give this a chance.

776505,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0000CGNEH,Andy Orrock,"[5, 6]","Although the images in 'Winged Migration' are fabulous, I found myself frustrated by the (very) sparse narration.  Not that I wanted a constantly chattering voice over, but something a little meatier would have helped out a non-birder like myself.I also question some of the editing decisions that were made.  For a movie focusing on the wonders of migration, the only images locked in my mind a month after my viewing are a damaged bird falling victim to a swarm of crabs (an almost nightmare-inducing scene), gulls feasting on a baby penguin and geese being shot by hunters.  I don't think was the 'take away' the filmmakers wanted to imprint on its viewers.For those who say these scenes depict the dangers and realities of migration, look at the &quot;Making Of...&quot; extra on the DVD.  This is not a documentary, it's (esentially) a piece of nature art staged by the filmmakers.  In fact, seeing how they filmed these scenes will really make you re-think this entire movie and see it in a new light.  No doubt, it's a brilliant technical achievement by the crew. But when you raise the birds yourselves, crate and fly them to a location...well, let's just say Sir David Attenborough won't be calling anytime soon for advice on the making of &quot;Life of Birds, Vol. II.&quot;",3,Needs more narration,1083628800,"05 4, 2004",2004,1284,"['images', ""'Winged"", 'Migration', 'are', 'fabulous', 'found', 'frustrated', 'very', 'sparse', 'narration', 'Not', 'wanted', 'constantly', 'chattering', 'voice', 'something', 'little', 'meatier', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'out', 'non-birder', 'myself.I', 'also', 'question', 'editing', 'decisions', 'were', 'made', 'movie', 'focusing', 'wonders', 'migration', 'only', 'images', 'locked', 'mind', 'month', 'viewing', 'are', 'damaged', 'bird', 'falling', 'victim', 'swarm', 'crabs', 'almost', 'nightmare-inducing', 'scene', 'feasting', 'baby', 'penguin', 'geese', 'being', 'shot', 'hunters', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', ""'take"", 'away', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'imprint', 'viewers.For', 'who', 'say', 'scenes', 'depict', 'dangers', 'realities', 'migration', 'look', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'DVD', 'not', 'documentary', 'esentially', 'piece', 'nature', 'art', 'staged', 'filmmakers', 'fact', 'seeing', 'how', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'will', 'really', 'make', 're-think', 'entire', 'movie', 'see', 'new', 'light', 'doubt', 'brilliant', 'technical', 'achievement', 'crew', 'when', 'raise', 'birds', 'yourselves', 'crate', 'fly', 'location', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Sir', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'calling', 'anytime', 'soon', 'advice', 'making', 'quot', 'Life', 'Birds', 'Vol', 'II.', 'quot']",Winged Migration

It took a lot of teamwork and expertise.The cast and crew endured extreme climates and altitudes, ranging from arctic to desert. They filmed in heavy rain, mountains and valleys, marshes, etc.The viewer can come to appreciate the bird's survival instinct, and their adaptation to conditions that range from inhospitable to lethal, to people.Artificial? Yes, very. The traditional approach, of a naturalist roughing it can not feature migratory animals. They are stationary in one geographical zone, for example, the rainforest in central america, and usually in one season, such as spring. They can observe the behavior of toucans and parrots in spring, in their habitat in the panama canal region.I fully recommend ''winged migration.'' They fulfilled the title's promise; it showcases the conditions that birds endure when they fly across continents.

You'll fly with a bird's eye view through miles and miles of country, city, industry, farms and amazing vistas that are a treat to watch.I bought the DVD and have yet to watch it again in one sitting.  I put it on the other morning because I find the music and even the very brief narration found throughout the film to be peaceful and meditative.  Yet about half way through it I found myself sitting on the couch in peaceful repose just watching.  And it was quite hypnotic and relaxing.

The roughly hour and a half of video is simply spellbinding (and both my cats liked it as well as I did). The ""how we did it"" special features were all the more interesting after seeing the accomplishment.On reflection, I did reduce my rating to four stars from five, entirely due to two scenes where migrating geese are shot by ""hunters"", and one (although more natural) scene at the seashore where crabs are pursuing a wounded bird - with the implication that they succeeded.

If you don't, the documentary 'Winged Migration' may change your mind. Shot in more than 40 countries all around the world, the movie examines the phenomenon of migration. What makes birds travel thousands miles? The answer is easy: survival.In order to survive to climate changes, birds go to one point to other in the planet, trying to reach more favorable temperatures. Later on, they will be back to their hometown. Full of beautiful images, the movie follows many groups of birds showing their way of life, things we could never have thought of. Birds are much more close to humans in behavior than we could imagine in our wildest dreams. There are feelings for every taste: familiar relations, jealousy, envy --there are two birds that seem to be 'fighting' which has the more beautiful tail--, love and an incredible taste for ballet. Yes, if you don't believe me, go and see the movie.It comes with no surprise that such delicate work was produced, written and directed by Jacques Perrin, the same man behind the documentary 'MicroCosmos'. 'Winged' received a deserved nomination for the Oscar. But it is not the main reason to watch this movie. If you think your life is hard, think again.

I'd been amazed at short clips I'd seen, but thought -- How interesting can it be to watch birds flying?  Well, I wound up watching the complete 90 minutes -- so did my husband, so did our children -- and then I watched all the extra dvd features as well, because once you see the film you'll HAVE to know how they got the footage, and that is almost as fascinating.Some people will be upset to know that the action is largely &quot;staged&quot;.  I was at first.  But as I began to comprehend the enormous effort and commitment involved by all the participants, who imprinted the hatchlings and then spent hundreds of hours with them, I began to appreciate that it was quite an impressive project.  Same with the inclusion of several people in the film -- at first it was jarring, but then I decided I was glad to see a few positive interactions between the avian and human world.  Filming takes place all over the world and with many different species, including grebes, storks, pelicans, parrots, penguins and several species of geese.  While the filming is spectacular in general, occasionally there are shots that will take your breath away.  Caveat: There are also a few scenes that will take explaining (or distraction, if you're alert) for the youngest viewers -- hunting, an injured bird eaten by crabs and a quail nesting in the path of farm equipment -- otherwise of inspirational beauty for the whole family.  After we watched, we talked about birds, read stories about birds, drew some pictures of birds and then went back and watched our favorite scenes again!The dvd extras are a must!  In addition to director's commentary, there is a 52-minute featurette show the imprinting and bonding process and the use of scaffolds, ultralight planes, gliders, ships and hot air balloons for filming, as well as the many problems (and their solutions) encountered during filming.  Another featurette depicts the composition and recording of the soundtrack (17 min).  There are also interesting and informative filmmaker interviews (25 minutes), a trailer and narrated stills.  Minimal narration is in English, and subtitles are available in English, Hindi, Portuguese and Spanish.I was glad to hear that the birds are now living in Normandy under the supervision of 7 caretakers, with hopes of turning the area into an educational reserve.Brilliant!

776519,A1GB1Q193DNFGR,B0000CGNEH,Bruce Lee Pullen,"[0, 1]","Footnote: Actual Official Review: **** 1/2 stars (four star and a half rating)Unbeknownst to the prevailing abiding aristocratic cinematic world mood of obliviousness to all things natural except in the most fervent degree of mindless environmental ferocity, nature apparently seems to only exclusively receive mention through the one-dimensional prism of vapid unspecifics. These trite simplifications of lushly boundless fact into chronically simplistic fiction is quite common throughout the film industry: exploitation of nature for political ulterior intentions, the general absenteeism of nature from view unless it's scripted to instantly underscore some usually cheap deadpan emotional resonance from audiences, or it's inbred invisibility as background unless previously fashioned as scapegoat for narrative laziness appears relentlessly in an incommunicable number of films over the years. This constant oversight has been the preceding extent for how corporate film pseudo-sophistication has afforded the natural world in the frighteningly shallow cinematic landscape that is modern film today. It takes the miraculous discovery of something so undisputedly priceless to once again allow one to swell in unrestrained awe at what still is dazzlingly unexplainable in the real natural world.Winged Migration (2001, French original title: Peuple migrateur, Le) lavished upon all the cinema going multitudes of 2002 a unprecedented and wholly unanticipated bountifully fertile untarnished tapestry of the untamed physical world with the infinitely ambiguous wonderment and dizzyingly uncontrolled amazement that effortlessly made pale all the Burly Brawls, digital interstate car chases, and animatronics robotic sophistication that you're ever likely to see from going to the movies this year or last. Co-directed by Jacques Cluzaud, Michel Debats (assistant director on Himalaya (1999)), and Jacques Perrin (also the film's ""lively"" narrator and financial producer), Winged Migration was an improbably painstaking four-year documentary film project that in truly bewilderingly epic form gallantly attempts and conclusively unnaturally accomplishes unnaturally to crowingly focus on the spring and fall migrations of over a dozen species of birds around the globe , as they unflinchingly travel across the unending countryside, transcontinental oceanic divides, and the brutal violations of the archaically blind elements to reach their summer and winter resting places before the treacherous immovable progression of the seasons finally catches up with them. It's an astronomical biological race against time as the lives of untold flocks of pelicans, albatrosses, south Atlantic king penguins, bald eagles, geese of all denominations, and the levitating dominion of flying birds everywhere encroachingly invade upon the inarticulate inexpressible promised lands of their own birth where millions expire along the way and millions more are breathed into existence. This premise may sound very absurd to those weaned on the technologically vacuous bins of mindlessly ridiculous entertainment that obstinately gag the imagination of tomorrow's adults (yes please, can we watch See Spot Run, Good Boy, Cat in the Hat, or Scooby Doo, can we Mom, can we, can we?). Increasingly though the dramatic life and death results of Winged Migration's pristinely rendered families of birds on the run from nature's densely unforgiving clock is so much more moving, in all the absolute concrete conviction of that word.Bewitchingly hearkening wordless grandeur, gliding on the adamantly unspecified unlimited fringes of mystic atmosphere over pressurized sky, these mystic weightless ambassadors of expeditious flight have agelessly inspired numerous laments on the immeasurable vastness of nature, here is another mercilessly inspiring flabbergasting ode to the incalculable wonders that lay beyond human identification. Riding the bottomless untold expanses of furiously relentless sky and unyieldingly lasting longer than recorded time itself, birds remain to some an eternal bridge to the unconscious will of cosmic inception. These fluttering endlessly ascending vessels of peerless clandestine design aerodynamically master the inconceivably unfathomable and morally unwitting every single day of their essentially anonymous lives. Yet there is no hesitation no lapsing of fundamental responsibility to live on, to carry the seed of antiquity to the next generation, and inscribe the craft of memory to the physically monogamous allegiances of the future. The congenital disposition and abstinent resolve to pass down what once was to what will be remains agelessly stupefying no matter how many times you experience it.These thousand, multi-thousand, and hundreds of miles of globetrotting that compose those grasping strides for life are splendorous and astonishing in of themselves, and yet they invariably take place equally in the ethereal pressurized envelope of space just as judiciously and fatefully as below beneath the shadow of gusting air as life's numerous channels of providence and circumstance work themselves through to their inevitable conclusions. Waiting there in the camera's lens by their side, you encounter and witness the unwontedly uncognitive wilderness of causality as what must be done is ultimately achieved given the will of nature's equilibrium. The randomness of slaughter as an undefended baby penguin chick is left vulnerable for the submissively compliant lunges of gratification, the biological terrorism of removing the fruits of one breed and remorselessly replacing them with another, the instinctive deployment of problem solving skills desperately needed to emancipate one from captivity, and the elastic charismatic expanding of nature to fill all of those little problems that may just have palpable answers beyond the enclosure of understanding allows, including the contorting of a fish to invariably go down one's throat more effortlessly. For these birds, existence remains the attainable only through the incomprehensible of the never-ending. As you attentively witness the perceived balladic ballet of weightless enveloping masses of birds breathlessly cascading across the endless mammoth body of insurmountable sky throughout this incredibly accomplished film, you view the intangible all-encompassing purity of nature unviolated and unblemished by man's sometimes sanctimoniously shallow and peripherally narcissistic viewing of her.As for the DVD edition of Winged Migration, it includes an impressive 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, a ravishing Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track, director's commentary, documentary supplements, and so much more.P.S.

Despite a century of airplanes there is still nothing akin to winging off into the blue, crannying through small openings in trees, scaling sheer cliff faces. Never before has the idea of real bird-like flight been so perfectly expressed on film as it has in director Jacques Perrin's masterful documentary film Winged Migration. Naysayers have decried the film is not a documentary because many of the birds were raised from birth, then trained to obey humans, bonded to them for they were the 1st things the birds saw after birth, called imprinting), so they're not `really' wild animals. Another objection is that the film, on several occasions, intersperses computer graphics with the `authentic' documentary sequences.These objections are bushwah- this film is 1 of the most unique & exhilarating pieces of film- documentary or not- ever made. It goes & we see them interact in ways never not just seen before, but not really imagined. Yet, despite how informative it is the film is really about how birds live, in an interior sense. Most people watching this film will have ideas that birds migrate, are sensitive to earth's electromagnetic fields, & acutely aware of the seemingly most trivial landmarks, but it's when the film focuses in on a species or flock that we realize that all the birds are individual. Unlike the Alfred Hitchcock film, The Birds, these creatures are not mindless automata. Because they are not as sophisticated as humans does not mean they do not possess a high degree of sophistication, & 1 might even argue bird culture. Mating dances, flight patterns, hunting routines, are all delineated in detail, & we see the travails & triumphs of groups, even as some individuals fall prey to death in its myriad forms- human hunters, industrial waste, other birds, & in a particularly chilling scene a bird with a broken wing who is pursued on a beach by a horde of voracious sand crabs.Of course, being a documentary there is not a real plot, we just follow the different flocks through the course of a year. What intrigues is how the footage got so close to the birds? Some was taken while flying in ultra-light aircrafts, the noise of which the birds were made accustomed to while still in their eggs. Other footage was culled from hot air balloons & some from ground vehicles. Regardless of its provenance the visuals dazzle far more than any cyberworld can. Take your faraway worlds & galactic rides- give me this earth, this view, this way!

776524,A2KP0ONGECY1WT,B0000CGNEH,"cs211 ""cs211""","[17, 19]","For anyone who can appreciate a good nature documentary (think National Geographic special, or IMAX nature film), Winged Migration is a must see.  The many shots of birds in flight, taken from a camera that is cruising along with the flock, just feet away, create a visceral feeling of what a bird's-eye view must really be like (and as the rest of the film shows, the view while flying is probably the best part of being a bird).  The geographic settings are spectacular (they include the Arctic and Antarctic, the American Southwest, the Sahara Desert, the Amazon, and just two cities, New York and Paris), and show that much of this planet, including the most stunning regions, is outside the scope of normal human experience.  However, man and birds do interact, and the scenes in which they do are thought provoking and carry an obvious message.  The musical score is well matched to the scenes, and the very minimal narration, which just serves to state the obvious, isn't needed at all.Now, the young kid's eye view:I took three girls to see this film, aged 8, 7, and 3.  The 3 year-old's favorite scenes were the cute baby birds interacting with their parents.  She enjoyed the flying scenes a little, but quickly tired, and once she had eaten her fill of popcorn and candy, she was ready to move onto something more exciting.  The older girls initially liked the flying scenes, but since they don't know enough about the geography of the planet to appreciate all the different settings (they did recognize New York and Paris on their own, but that's about it), they got bored.  They also liked the cute animal scenes, including the rock hopper penguins, but there weren't enough of these to hold their interest.  The scenes of birds meeting their demise didn't appear to affect them (and after all, the death of Bambi's mother is much more traumatic), but this also means that they didn't get the message that the filmmaker was communicating.  All in all, I would definitely not recommend Winged Migration for young kids.  Now, could the filmmakers have made a film that would have succeeded in appealing to all ages?  Yes, but it would of necessity have had to lose the subtlety and unobtrusive style that undoubtedly makes it appealing to many adults.",4,"Most adults will be enraptured, but not young kids",1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,2262,"['anyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'good', 'nature', 'documentary', 'think', 'National', 'Geographic', 'special', 'IMAX', 'nature', 'film', 'Winged', 'Migration', 'must', 'see', 'many', 'shots', 'birds', 'flight', 'taken', 'camera', 'cruising', 'along', 'flock', 'just', 'feet', 'away', 'create', 'visceral', 'feeling', 'what', ""bird's-eye"", 'view', 'must', 'really', 'be', 'rest', 'film', 'shows', 'view', 'flying', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'being', 'bird', 'geographic', 'settings', 'are', 'spectacular', 'include', 'Arctic', 'Antarctic', 'American', 'Southwest', 'Sahara', 'Desert', 'Amazon', 'just', 'two', 'cities', 'New', 'York', 'Paris', 'show', 'much', 'planet', 'including', 'most', 'stunning', 'regions', 'scope', 'normal', 'human', 'experience', 'However', 'man', 'birds', 'do', 'interact', 'scenes', 'do', 'are', 'thought', 'provoking', 'carry', 'obvious', 'message', 'musical', 'score', 'well', 'matched', 'scenes', 'very', 'minimal', 'narration', 'just', 'state', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'needed', 'all.Now', 'young', 'kid', 'eye', 'view', 'took', 'three', 'girls', 'see', 'film', 'aged', '8', '7', '3', '3', 'year-old', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'were', 'cute', 'baby', 'birds', 'interacting', 'parents', 'enjoyed', 'flying', 'scenes', 'little', 'quickly', 'tired', 'once', 'had', 'eaten', 'fill', 'popcorn', 'candy', 'was', 'ready', 'move', 'something', 'more', 'exciting', 'older', 'girls', 'initially', 'liked', 'flying', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'geography', 'planet', 'appreciate', 'different', 'settings', 'did', 'recognize', 'New', 'York', 'Paris', 'own', 'got', 'bored', 'also', 'liked', 'cute', 'animal', 'scenes', 'including', 'rock', 'hopper', 'penguins', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'scenes', 'birds', 'meeting', 'demise', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'affect', 'death', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'much', 'more', 'traumatic', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'message', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'communicating', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'Winged', 'Migration', 'young', 'kids', 'Now', 'could', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'succeeded', 'appealing', 'ages', 'Yes', 'would', 'necessity', 'have', 'had', 'lose', 'subtlety', 'unobtrusive', 'style', 'undoubtedly', 'appealing', 'many', 'adults']",Winged Migration

As many reviewers here have noted (to their peril!), this is not a National Geographic documentary.  It is not agenda free.  This vehicle is freighted with all kinds of &quot;messages,&quot; so much so that the beauty of the birds gets caught in the net of earnestness.No one can deny that the visual images presented to us in &quot;Winged Migration&quot; are breathtaking and unforgettable. What is forgettable is the narration that Perrin forces upon the images. In an apparent attempt to give the film some kind of symmetry or narrative arc, Perrin tries to tie it all together with insightful commentary.There is literally nothing interesting in the narration nor is there any information offered that any high school science student couldn't offer as well.  What's worse, there seems to be a &quot;birds good, people bad&quot; message underlying all of this.Another annoyance is the effort to unite all these species of birds in the concept of migration. Honestly, can you honestly compare penguins and parrots with geese and finches? They may all be birds, but their stories and journeys are remarkably different.The computer animation seems out of place as well, feeling like another attempt by the filmmakers to make the footage fit together. So much of it seems like an after-thought.  The selection of which birds to include seems haphazard.  Sure, they all look good on film, but is there truly anything unifying beyond, &quot;They're all birds and they move from place to place.&quot;The images don't need much commentary at all. The graphics tell us what bird is being featured and how far it travels. The commentary misses the most interesting aspects of the footage, namely the community of birds that we witness on the screen.  Why try to extract a unifying theme at all.  Lose the narrator and the &quot;story&quot; and just let the birds fly (or swim).See this film for the beautiful images of birds in flight, but you'll have to forgive the awkward and contrived human element.",4,"Visually stunning, conceptually problematic",1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,2122,"['originally', 'reviewed', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'now', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'even', 'more', 'concerned', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'noted', 'peril', 'not', 'National', 'Geographic', 'documentary', 'not', 'agenda', 'free', 'vehicle', 'freighted', 'kinds', 'quot', 'messages', 'quot', 'so', 'much', 'beauty', 'birds', 'caught', 'net', 'earnestness.No', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'visual', 'images', 'presented', 'quot', 'Winged', 'Migration', 'quot', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'unforgettable', 'What', 'forgettable', 'narration', 'Perrin', 'forces', 'images', 'apparent', 'attempt', 'give', 'film', 'kind', 'symmetry', 'narrative', 'arc', 'Perrin', 'tie', 'together', 'insightful', 'commentary.There', 'literally', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'narration', 'there', 'information', 'offered', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'student', 'could', ""n't"", 'offer', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'worse', 'be', 'quot', 'birds', 'good', 'people', 'bad', 'quot', 'message', 'underlying', 'this.Another', 'annoyance', 'effort', 'unite', 'species', 'birds', 'concept', 'migration', 'Honestly', 'can', 'honestly', 'compare', 'penguins', 'parrots', 'geese', 'finches', 'may', 'be', 'birds', 'stories', 'journeys', 'are', 'remarkably', 'different.The', 'computer', 'animation', 'place', 'well', 'feeling', 'attempt', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'footage', 'fit', 'together', 'So', 'much', 'after-thought', 'selection', 'birds', 'include', 'haphazard', 'Sure', 'look', 'good', 'film', 'there', 'truly', 'anything', 'unifying', 'quot', ""'re"", 'birds', 'move', 'place', 'place.', 'quot', 'images', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'commentary', 'graphics', 'tell', 'what', 'bird', 'being', 'featured', 'how', 'far', 'commentary', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'footage', 'namely', 'community', 'birds', 'witness', 'screen', 'Why', 'try', 'extract', 'unifying', 'theme', 'Lose', 'narrator', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'just', 'let', 'birds', 'fly', 'swim', 'film', 'beautiful', 'images', 'birds', 'flight', ""'ll"", 'have', 'forgive', 'awkward', 'contrived', 'human', 'element']",Winged Migration

The moviemakers flew in ultralights alongside various birds of the world, oftentimes over exotic locations.  The result is images so stunning that it is hard to believe they are not enhanced by CGI.  While there is no storyline per se, I found myself laughing throughout the movie at the antics of the birds.  The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (sadly, it lost to a vastly inferior film--Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine).This is the kind of film where you want the best possible resolution, and this blu-ray transfer does not disappoint.  The level of detail is stunning in most scenes, particularly those shot in direct sunlight.  Color saturation is strong.  At times it felt like you were right there with the birds.  Some scenes shot in lowlight or overcast conditions have film grain, but it is soft, not gritty.  I can live with that.  The sound was fine, I suppose, although my eyes were so absorbed in the visuals that I did not pay too much attention to the audio.Parental Advisory: This movie is rated G.

776529,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0000CGNEH,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 7]","Breathtaking!  Beautiful!  There are so many positive things that one can say about ""Winged Migration"", the popular 2001 documentary film/natural tale that captured the attention of audiences around the world with its ambitious plan to showcase a birds migration during the Winter and its return back.  Ambitious because it would involve a large crew and a global filmmaking effort plus cinematography never before seen at that time.With a crew of 450 people, 17 pilots and 14 cinematographers, an ambitious documentary directed by three individuals Jacques Cluzaud, Michel Debas and Jacques Perrin with their goal to  show people about birds who migrate and travel the globe.Many people know that birds migrate once the Winter comes but where do they go? What do they do?  This natural tale, which the directors prefer to use than calling it a ""documentary"" is all about watching dozens upon dozens of different birds from all seven continents and what they do.  Quite literally, the cycle of life amongst the birds and captured on film.What is most amazing about ""Winged Migration"" is that you are right there.  It's like having a front row seat as you are very close to the actual birds flying nearby.  From India to New York, to Africa and then to the rain forests of South America Peru, to Japan, Vietnam, Australia, the arctic North and South Pole, over 40 countries and filming in all seven countries during the Summer and the immense cold, this was among the most ambitious films that I have ever seen.What is most striking about the film is its beautiful cinematography.  As mentioned, birds are close by, so close that you feel you can touch them.  And then seeing the camera focusing on the flock of birds as it flies right by the rainforests, the desert, the arctic, the ocean with castles and old architecture right below them.  There are also awesome shots overhead.  Showing the scope of the landscape or how many birds have flocked to an area.  It's just amazing cinematography.The film uses nearly 590 miles of film to create an 89 minute documentary.  For example, in the scene in the arctic, one reel of film is 4-minutes long.  With film being so expensive, the filmmakers had challenges of wondering when to make good use of the film while sitting in the frigid arctic for hours filming.  When do you shoot?  Do they wait for something to happen?  Definitely a risky and difficult filming task but they pulled it off.""Winged Migration"" is a film that does its best to showcase the life of these birds as they migrate thousands of miles and then return back to where they come from.  Some going from Africa to Europe, others from the North Pole all the way to the South Pole.  The fact that the filmmakers covered so many birds and followed them so far around the planet.  A feat so ambitious, so difficult, so challenging and so risky but something not done before in the sake of filmmaking, what we are able to get is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking films ever created.The goal of the filmmaker was to create a film that would be a symphony of nature.  So, while you watch the film which is occasionally narrated and features occasional subtitles when introducing a bird or region and how far it has traveled, it's all about what you see on video, the beauty of them flying and traveling thousands of miles around the planet.  And then in conjunction with the beautiful visuals comes the beautiful music of Bruno Coulais and the Bulgarian choir.  Again, everything comes together perfectly!VIDEO & AUDIO:""Winged Migration"" is featured for the first time in High-Definition ala 1080p with an aspect ration of 1:85:1.  All shots are outdoors, different types of weather depending on the continent.  Near the desert, near the snow, near lush green backdrops of grass and trees and the ocean.  The different types of birds and their own different colors.  ""Winged Migration"" is all about its vibrant colors.  And the beautiful cinematography showcases that vibrancy and sure, it was beautiful on DVD but on high definition, a film like ""Winged Migration"" is just breathtaking and knowing that this film is not utilizing CG in the filming of the birds, that the beauty we see on screen.As for the audio, audio is presented in English, Portuguese and Spanish in Dolby True HD 5.1.  There is occasional narrative but the film is all about its music.  And the symphony-based music by Bruno Coulais and the vocal groups from Bulgaria and the music overall was just fantastic to listen to.  There are scenes where you will hear the birds singing and chirping and that what you hear all around your entire home theater surround.  Music and ambient sound of the birds play a big part in this film.As for subtitles, ""Winged Migration""is subtitled in Danish, English (UK), English (US), Finnish, Hindi, Norwegian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Latin Am) and Swedish.SPECIAL FEATURES:The special features of ""Winged Migration"" is probably one of the most important to watch because you get to learn if the crew saved any of the birds that were in harms way or just shot as nature intended it to be:* Full Length Director's Commentary - Despite the thick French accent, the commentary track is very important to listen to because you get good insight of the filmmaking process.  Of what was actually shot live and what was created to make a point.  For example, there is a scene with the birds flying through industries and showcase a storyline about pollution.  The scene shows birds walking through, what looks like oil and one getting trapped in it.  All birds escape but one.  One is stuck.  It makes you wonder, did the bird die in the oil or did the crew save it?  You realize through the commentary that the oil is not oil but black milk, so the bird was not harmed.  The scene was shot as it is to make a point about pollution.  So, there are many commentary segments that are just informative.  You also learn more through the various featurettes on disc.* ""Making of Winged Migration""- A 52-minute featurette on the making of the film.  You realize that a good number of the birds have been imprinted.  Meaning, when they were born, the first thing they saw was a human and thus, they were attached to the humans and taught how to migrate.  Similar to the 1996 film ""Fly away Home"", ""Winged Migration"" showcases various birds that were imprinted and thus, how various filming through the ground, oceans and sky were done.  You learn of the challenges of filming in New York and Paris but also all over the world and the risky challenges faced by the crew.  The film was shot in 48 countries, all seven continents and the challenges include shipping cranes to Senegal to film a scene but weather wasn't cooperating and the birds got sick.  So, the film crew had to face certain situations such as making sure the birds were taken care of.  With so many film crews, it was very important that filming was done right.  You learn how difficult, risky and challenging it was to do this film but so many people around the world took part in working on ""Winged Migration"" to make the film possible and to make it happen.* ""Creating the Music"" Featurette - With the film focusing so much on the music, a 17-minute featurette was made to showcase the music of Bruno Coulais and the use of a Bulgarian orchestra that Jacques Perrin recommended and then having Nick Cave sing the ending theme.* About the Film - This nine minute featurette is about ""imprinting"".  How many of these birds are raised and trained to obey their imprinter, the sounds of a vehicle, human or horn and for their migration.* Further comments - This 14 minute featurette is possibly the most informative piece for those who were wondering about certain segments.  In one scene in Africa, a bird with a broken wing is shown walking.  While all these crabs pursue it.  You are then left with a shot with the crabs all on top of what appears to possibly be the bird that was injured.  But it is revealed that the crew stepped in and actually saved the bird.  One of the few scenes where the film crew decided to save a bird instead of filming the actual and natural killing of the birds.  Another scene was of the cuckoo and how the bird was eliminating all eggs from a nest and wanting to be the sole bird to be raised by another bird (part of its instinct).  The bird would then grow older, migrate to a country like France, find a mate and then the eggs would then be brought to a nest of the bird that raised it.  Also, explanation of the filming of the Rockhopper penguins and how a certain bird would go and kill and eat the sick penguin babies or the babies that lost its parents.  Very informative segment.* Photo Gallery with Filmmaker Commentary - A 13-minute featurette showcasing photos of birds in flight and the various types of birds featured on the film.The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:""Winged Migration"" was a rare film to come out in 2001.  The enormity of following birds as it traveled the globe and having film crews document them migrating in all continents and 48 countries is just amazing.  And watching it on film and seeing the behind-the-scenes makes you appreciate the film much more because what was an ambitious idea became reality.So, you ask yourself the question.  Would you enjoy a film like ""Winged Migration""?  There is no major plot, it's a straightforward nature film about the many birds who migrate.  So, it depends on how you feel about nature and if you can watch a film about birds traveling around the world.  Many have been in awe of beautiful cinematography and the accompanying music. It's definitely a special and unique film and if you want to watch beauty in action, beauty from all continents captured on film, you really can't go wrong with ""Winged Migration"".

776530,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B0000CGNEH,D. Hartley,"[7, 7]","One fellow reviewer found some scenes in ""Winged Migration"" to be ""bizarrely orchestrated"". If Mr. ""One-Star"" had bothered to listen to the director's commentary, he would have heard Jacques Perrin state: ""This film is neither fiction, nor a documentary."" This breathtaking nature tale no more pretends to be a ""documentary"" than ""The Bear"", ""Never Cry Wolf"", or even ""Walking With Dinosaurs"", ever did. Closer in spirit to visual tone poems like ""Koyaanisqatsi"" or ""Baraka"", ""Winged Migration"" is best enjoyed as a purely sensual, almost meditative experience (no -I'm not a New Age looney, just a fan of pure CINEMA). Many memorable scenes; a segment with graceful white swans landing on snow is one of the most transcendent movie moments in recent memory. For once, the ubiquitous DVD ""Making Of..."" featurette is not the usual self-stroking ego-fest, but as fascinating as the film itself. It turns out that our principal ""stars"" ARE in fact, ""actors"", who have been raised from hatching by members of the film crew, who have developed a remarkable communication with the birds through this imprinting process. When you learn that several hundred people risked thier lives daily for over four years, travelling the globe to produce this amazing 85 minutes for our entertainment, it reveals the ""It's just a bunch of boring birds flying around!"" reviewers to be even more clueless than we already suspected.

776532,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0000CGNEH,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[108, 139]","Ahhh... Now it is clear to me why, despite having adored this film when I saw it on the big screen last spring, I was unable to write a review of it, until now.  The reason is, sadly, that the film is a fake.  A skillful, mesmerizing fraud, but a fraud nonetheless.  In the theatre, we all thought, ""oh! how did they get that shot!"" and ""wow -- I never knew birds did that!""  But watching the DVD -- or, more precisely, the behind-the-scenes featurette that we all knew would be on the DVD -- it all becomes apparent why the birds were so strangely accessible to director Jacques Perrin and his French film crew.  The reason is that the majority of the birds seen in the film -- the Canadian snow geese in the Southwestern desert, the stately pelicans on the coast of Senegal, the elegant cranes perched astride one another atop Saharan sand dunes -- were all hatched, imprinted, conditioned and trained to perform as ""actors"" by Perrin and his crew.  These birds didn't migrate to these picturesque locales; they were shipped there in cages and posed amid various props and scenarios.  Their handlers whizzed before them, in jeeps and ultralight planes, honking bicycle horns and shouting ""Allez! Allez!"" (the sounds the birds had been trained to respond to) as the somewhat befuddled birds tried to please their bipedal, Gallic surrogate parents.Setting aside the issues involved in presenting these carefully engineered scenes as representative of ""instinctive migration"" (I'm sure that *real* nature documentarians are fuming about this film...), this is also disturbing because the filmmakers never fully disclose the results of their inter-species machinations.  Does this mean that the scenes in which birds die were also engineered by the director?  When, for example, some adorable ducks waddle into a toxic waste pit in Eastern Europe, seemingly of their own innocent accord, is it actually because they were plopped there by a cynical and callous film crew, sacrificial lambs to the aesthetic and political sensibilities of their human ""friends""?  When a goose is felled by a hunter's bullet, were the hunters trucked onto the set as well?  Did Perrin and his grad student scientific cohorts feel any affection for or responsibility towards the animals they had raised, or were the birds mere props?  And what happened to the dozens of avian actors, once the filming was over?  Did they continue on as a research project at some university somewhere, or did Perrin and his crew have  celebratory dinner of roast fowl and liver pate afterwards?  The DVD, neither the feature film or the ""making of"" featurette, doesn't deal with any of the ethical implications of their work, and though I thought the film itself was a work of jaw-dropping beauty and amazing technical wizardry, learning the real story behind its production left a bad taste in my mouth.( Initially, I would have given this a 5+ rating; then, based on what I learned about the production itself, I leaned towards a ""wish-I-could-give-it-a-zero"" 1...

Some of these migrations are merely hundreds of miles; others longer than 2500 miles, crossing continents and oceans.Directors Jacques Perrin, Jacques Cluzaud, and Michel Debats and their team spent four years and crossed seven continents to capture these wonderful creatures in their migratory patterns,  With stunning cinematography and breathtaking scenery, they put the viewer both above the birds, giving a view of the world as seen from the skies, and at eye level with the birds, flying and gliding alongside them, making the viewer feel as if he/she were part of the flock.Interspersed with some narration and music, they rely much on visuals to show how and why the birds migrate, to show the hardships they must face, such as weather and natural predators, and to display how mankind is making an impact of them through hunting and pollution.Picture and sound quality on the DVD are wonderful, much better than when I saw it in the theater.

This documentary film follows the life of migratory birds from the beginning of their flight all the way through to the end, which is really just the return to where they started.  What makes ""Winged Migration"" different, interesting, and beautiful is the level of video photography in the film.  I have no idea how it was done (I didn't watch any of the bonus features on the DVD), but the camera was right next to the birds in flight, so the viewer has the closest approximation of being in flight as is possible while watching a movie.  The close ups of the birds in flight are absolutely amazing.Visually, ""Winged Migration"" is a stunning film.  The narration, however, is very brief so we are left with mostly just the images of the birds.  An example of the narration is these sentences, ""For many birds in Europe the journey's end is Africa.  But many will fall by the wayside.""  These two sentences comprised the entire narration for at least a ten to fifteen minute sequence.  Narration is hardly needed for this film to be captivating.  We see the hazards of migration: the weather, natural predators, hunters, farmers, and the environmental impact of man.  We see incredibly beautiful landscapes from a bird's eye view (in this case, literally).""Winged Migration"" is a visual film.  This is the appeal of it.  It is really the best National Geographic film that has ever been made, except that it wasn't made by the good people at National Geographic.  But, that is the style of ""Winged Migration"".

My wife and I left the special studio screening exclaiming, ""How'd they do that!?""The film begins along a minor waterway in Europe as a flock of geese begins its annual migration north to its summer breeding ground. It then cuts to other locales around the world as other species of large birds - usually cranes, swans, and storks, but also gannets, loons and others - begin their respective journeys. In all cases, the captioning identifies the species, their start points and destinations, and the miles between the two.  Occasionally, Perrin makes the point more spectacularly by superimposing the flying flock on an image of the Earth taken from near-orbit. Voice overs are kept to a minimum.Except for New York (with the WTC still standing), Paris, and a dismal industrial wasteland in eastern Europe, the flocks are shown flying through unpopulated landscapes both varied and magnificent: beaches, ice fields, Monument Valley, northern tundra, open oceans, snow-covered mountains, Asian farmlands, forest-enclosed lakes, deserts, and tropical rainforests. The sunset and weather (blizzards, fog, thunderstorms) provide dramatic backdrops. Then, at journey's end, the birds are shown in their summer habitats - usually steep, dramatic cliffs or rock-strewn shores with sea-ravaged margins.But certainly the most eye-popping camera work is with the bird formations on the wing. The apparent vantage point of the lens is among the flock, with individual birds only an arm or hand-length away above, below, or to the side. I mean, you're RIGHT THERE! You'd think they'd have to be computer animated models. But a disclaimer at the film's beginning states that no special effects were used in the filming of the birds.While Perrin emphasizes the round trip to, and the stay in, the breeding grounds, he doesn't gloss over the dangers. The viewer watches as individual birds fall victim to animal predators, human hunters and poachers, and industrial pollution. Some circumstances are heartrending, as when a disabled bird is surrounded and overcome by predatory crabs on an African beach.Before concluding back at the same waterway and with the same flock of geese which began his documentary, the filmmaker makes a digression at first seemingly inconsistent with the title, i.e. with flightless Emperor penguins in the southern hemisphere. Of course, they use their wings to swim a couple hundred miles.WINGED MIGRATION is a film to remind us that the real world can be just as spectacular and amazing as any one of the mega-budget, FX-laden, mindless thrillers dished out to the masses.

""Winged Migration"" takes the viewer to sights and heights not possible for man - along migratory paths with several species of birds.  During their 2000-, 3000- or even 4000-mile journies, we are witnesses to the trials, hazards and obstacles they face.  It's hard to imagine these creatures enduring this journey twice a year, every year, especially when one considers the multiple dangers at every turn.  Yet they do.Environmental hazards, predators, weather, and of course, the worst hazard of all - man himself.  It was particularly upsetting to view the ""hunting scene"" in this film.  Imagine  flying 1000 miles or more to get to your breeding ground, only to get shot out of the sky by some Saturday-morning hunter.  Nice.  Viewers beware - although this film has great beauty, there are some equally disturbing scenes.Some reviewers have complained that parts of the film were not real, or ""staged"" with ""bird actors.""  These people are missing the point.  In order to tell the story of these birds, to get close enough to them, the producers had to use birds that were comfortable with their presence.  The birds used for these scenes were raised by humans.  This should in no way take away from the power of the film.

There should DEFINITELY be some sort of dialogue a la PBS nature shows, so you actually LEARN something while watching the nice shots.  This movie was killing my brain after a while.2.  This movie is the ""Faces of Death"" of wildlife.  Not in the good way, but rather watching the whole thing only to find out most of the movie was staged with captive-raised birds flown in different locations, instead of a real look at migrating birds.3.  I'm almost certain the description on the DVD case claims the movie is about the migration of a flock of birds, and the journeys they take to do it.  Turns out, it wasn't even close to that, but rather different shots of different birds, and almost all the shots were just staged (see 2).Overall, the movie was just too long and shallow.  They made a few scenes to keep your interest (crabs, traps, and hunters), but without a real story, narraration, or ANY form of useful information, it doesn't sit well as a movie OR a documentary (I certainly wouldn't call staged flights with pet birds a documentary)It's a real shame, they could have done so much more with the footage.

You've never seen anything quite like this, and I commend the filmmakers for being able to ""fly with the birds"" the way they did.  When the Canada Geese fly through the snowstorm, or when you see the baby bird jump off the cliff and fly for the first time, your jaw just drops at how amazing it is.  It will be nice to see the ""Making of"" section of the DVD.That's the good.  This is the bad:1. No information.  None.  The movie will tell you which birds you're following, how far they need to fly, and then you're on your own.  What do these birds eat?  How often do they stop?  When do they mate?  You will receive no answers.  Occasionally the film will show you some birds ""dancing,"" or in the case of the grouses, making amazing noises with sacs in their chests.  I can only assume it's part of some mating ritual, because there was nothing in the film to tell me.  This irritated me.2.  There were parts of this film that were obviously staged, and usually that's ok.  But I take issue with how it was done here.  I believe the filmmakers were trying to show how humans pose a danger to migrating birds.  In order to do this, they proceeded to film some hunters who were obviously aware they were being filmed (and probably hired by the filmmakers), shooting and killing birds, as we watch them fall from the sky.  I know hunting birds is legal, but in a movie where the whole idea is to show the wonder and grandeur of these birds, this message and the blunt way it was delivered was out of place.  There are other examples of this, as when the combines rush towards the baby bird in the wheat field, with appropriately scary music accompanying it.  Just not in the spirit of the film.3.  The length.  I could be very wrong, but I kind of feel like these French filmmakers were trying to outdo the BBC and Discovery Channel, both well known for their nature documentaries.  If this film would dish out some helpful info once and a while, I could have comfortably sat for an hour and a half.  But as it is, it gets old fast, even with the great filmmaking.I would say, rent it, watch it once, and then go to PBS and Discovery to actually LEARN something about these birds.

Filmmaker Jacques Perrin spent years of production, thousands of miles in traveling and countless man-hours in training, not only the birds, but the intrepid team of naturalists and film crewmembers that were in large part responsible for the well-being of their subjects. No matter how you slice it, it's a towering achievement of documentary cinema.Or is it? The fascinating extra feature details how the flocks of geese et al that are seen in the film were trained from hatching to &quot;imprint&quot; on humans, so that they would stick close to people and filming them in flight would be possible. There are vivid accounts of the numerous difficulties the production crew encountered in shipping their charges to remote locations, releasing them, following them in dangerously fragile-looking flying machines (especially invented for the film), and hoping the birds would do their bidding.Ultimately, the troubling question that was raised in my mind was: to what extent can this be called a &quot;documentary&quot; when so many scenes were in effect staged for the camera? Certainly watching the feature alone, with its laconic titles giving facts about various species, their flight paths and distances traveled gives no clue of the immense preparation involved. Also, what happened to the birds once filming was finished? One doubts they were simply released into the wild to live normal lives.All this is not to take away from the astonishing visuals that resulted, but to suggest that the viewer needs to know more about the exact nature of this film than is evident from simply seeing the finished product.

It is just amazing to see the miles they fly over long periods of time.  It's amazing to see that they don't tire mid-flight and just skydive to the ground.

It's beautiful to see different mating rituals, including some of the most fascinating and graceful dances.  Of course, we see the chicks.

Summers in the Artic is short-lived.Not everything is pretty in this film.  You'll see a small bird with a broken wing, devoured by a group of crabs.  You'll see ducks and geese being shot down mid-flight by hunters.  You'll see a duck stuck in a mud of oil.  You'll see a duck entwined with a piece of netting around one of her feet.

Unfortunately, it suffered from the following problems from my perspective:- No ""character development."" That is, you see a lot of different kinds of birds flying and some on-the-ground footage, but  you are told virtually nothing about the various birds. ""The such and such flies X miles from some place to some other place,"" says the subtitle. Then you watch some of those birds flying for a while and then onto the next bird. I kept wanting to know about the birds, but teaching me about them apparently wasn't part of the intent of the film.- I expected it to be about migrating birds. To a great extent it was, but a lot of it was footage filmed of hand-raised birds trained to fly with ultralights and boats and those birds weren't migrating anywhere. They were shipped in crates on planes to the various locations. They don't explain this during the film. During the film it just seemed weird that migrating birds would let anything with a camera get that close. It's not until the ""making of"" featurette that they tell you they hand-raised a bunch of birds, imprinted on them, and trained them to fly with ultralights and alongside boats. Don't get me wrong. They invested a lot of time and energy raising and imprinting those birds, and they did a great job, but I felt like I'd been sold a bill of goods watching a movie about migrating birds when much of the footage was actually of pet birds flying with ultralights while not migrating anywhere.

It's a full 99 minutes of exquisite cinematography of migrating birds, some species flying as far as 12,500 miles each year.  There are a few captions, which tell the name of the bird and the amount of mileage they fly in order to migrate.  There's also some light background music as well as natural sounds, and a few sentences, spoken by the director.  Other than that, it's only the birds, whose migratory patterns were followed for three years.At the beginning of the film there's a disclaimer informing the audience that there were no special effects were used. And so I sat there in wonder of how they were able to achieve all their shots.  There's the beauty of birds flying in formation, close up shots of them feeding their young, competing with each other, stopping to rest.  And there's one magnificent shot of fleeing an avalanche.There are different species filmed in different areas of the world.  We see the Artic Circle, the American Southwest, the industrial areas of Eastern Europe, the vast oceans, the skyline of cities and even a shot as they fly past the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty.

This film places the audience inside flocks of birds are they travel thousands of miles twice every year in search of food and a place to breed. To say that the images are extraordinary and breathtaking is somehow an understatement. We see over 40 species of migrating bird -geese, ducks, cranes, storks, terns, penguins, pelicans, swans, and more- up close as they face the challenges of their long journeys. We also observe the birds as they breed, care for their young, search for food, and interact among themselves. There are several species of non-migratory birds who reside alongside the migrators featured as well.""Winged Migration"" was conceived and directed by Jacques Perrin and was filmed on 7 continents by 5 film crews over the course of 3 years. The filmmakers employed traditional gliders, remote-controlled gliders, helicopter-style gliders, helicopters, a Delta plane, an ultra-light motorized aircraft, hot air balloons, and even a bicycle to get these spectacular images. It is the Delta plane that was able to infiltrate the flocks and get the amazing in-flight close-ups that you see in the film. ""Winged Migration"" has very little narration, and what it does have is a little awkward. There is the occasional subtitle to tell you what species you are looking at and how far it migrates. And there is the occasional voice-over narration by Jacques Perrin. I am giving the film 5 stars in spite of its spotty written-then-spoken-then-written narration because the stunning images and the opportunity for the audience to see this extraordinary phenomenon up-close, as no human has been able to do before, more than makes up for the narration problems. And the narration does address the basic  ""What is that?"" and ""What is it doing?"" questions that would otherwise go unanswered. But the story of ""Winged Migration"" is told primarily with spectacular images accompanied by a musical score by Bruno Coulais.""Winged Migration"" is a Must-See for bird lovers and for anyone who loves beautiful images.

It is, well...just a darn good watch.&quot;Winged Migration&quot; doesn't seek to tell a story but does so unintentionally.  It is the story of a million birds answering the pull of nature, heeding the call of instinctual collective unconscious stamping, by soaring and flapping their way over forty countries, all the continents, season by season.  And what do you know, we have it all captured on film for our enjoyment in our very own dens and enclosed sheltered spaces of the human world.French director Jacques Perrin and his worldly film crew went through some considerable effort and even danger to bring this work of art to you and me.  Through Pavlovian bonding Perrin and Crew have raised flocks of birds to accept their ultra-lites, balloons, flying machines, cameras, as one of their own allowing these up close shots of the rhythm and rhyme of bird flight.  The end effect is stunning.What you will realize if you should so choose to purchase these DVD is that you are getting two films for the price of one.

This has led to a rise in the number of nature movies that make it big dollar-wise.  The most recent example is probably this 1.5 hour film on migrating birds.  Filmed and narrated by Europeans, this movie looks at the yearly life of migratory birds in the Northern Hemispher.  The footage revolves around two migrations, the one north to the Arctic during spring and summer, and the one south to the equator during fall and winter.  Both migrations thin the ranks, but both are done for survival; one to reach feeding grounds and the other to reach nesting grounds.  The movie shows multiple species big and small both in N. America and Eurasia.  The footage is quite exquisite with numerous shots of birds in the air, sleeping on mountain slopes, nesting on beachside cliffs, landing on hot desert dunes and getting stuck in mud, garbage, swamps and other traps natural and manmade.  The cinematography is top notch, and the dialogue is kept to a minimum.

With a bare minimum of subtitles (the bird and its migratory path is given for each set of birds the filmmakers tracked) and only slightly more narration by Perrin, the veteran actor of the trio (recently seen in Brotherhood of the Wolf, but no doubt best known for Cinema Paradiso), Winged Migration forces the viewer to concentrate on the birds, the places past which the birds fly, and the various hardships the birds have to endure, both natural and man-made.The true brilliance of the film's mostly silent take on things can be seen repeatedly, but perhaps never so well as a scene about thirty minutes into the film, while the filmmakers are tracking Canadian geese through the American west. One goose gets separated from the flock by a mustang stampede, of all things. The others take off before the lone goose can see them again, and by the time the dust settles, they're out of sight. The lone goose honks a few times, then wanders, for all the world looking dejected, behind a tumbleweed. It is as powerful a snippet of film as has been seen in any fictional drama. And the movie is full of little pieces like this.Winged Migration was criminally neglected in theaters, only seeing limited American release even after its Academy Award nomination. You were cheated of seeing it on the big screen, most likely (and one can only imagine after renting it how much more powerful it would have been when thirty feet wide), but don't cheat yourself out of it altogether.

""Winged Migration"" - adhering to the proposition that a picture is indeed worth a thousand words - offers a soaring, visually astonishing tribute to all the cranes, geese, swans and assorted other birds that have, since time immemorial, made long and dangerous airborne treks from one corner of the globe to another.  Like no nature special you've ever seen, directors Jacques Cluzaud, Michel Debats and Jacques Perrin and no fewer than fifteen credited cinematographers create a visual poem to these feathered marvels by taking us right into the thick of the action, somehow managing to get their cameras to fly, in beautifully coordinated fashion, right alongside the birds at amazing speeds and altitudes.  Seeing is believing in the case of this film, and even after seeing it, you still may not believe it.  That's how eye-popping and visually dazzling an experience this film is.With only minimal narration (some of it spoken and some of it subtitled), the filmmakers provide some helpful information regarding the particular species we are seeing and its migratory patterns.  But the film is far more of an aesthetic visual experience than an educational one. For long stretches of the movie, the birds merely fly along in majestic silence or backed up by haunting symphonic mood music (much of it reminiscent of the work in ""Koyaanisqatsi"").In addition to the birds themselves and their amazing feats, the cinematography captures, with blindingly crystal clarity, the awesome beauty of the various landscapes through which these extraordinary creatures travel (there's even a shot of the birds flying past the Twin Towers).

The answer is that sometimes the simplest, most basic art is the most enjoyable.

If you savour a well-made film, or if you are an aspiring documentary producer, this one's a must-watch. I hesitate to call it a documentary, it's so riveting it's nearly a silent film with a cast of thousands.The production values are stunning and make you frequently wonder How They Did That. The answer to which is a combination of gliders, balloons, helicopters and a special type of aircraft known as the Ultra Light Motorized craft that had a camera tied to it. It took 2 years to film this hour and a half. If I may, the 'screenplay' is fantastic.Then there's the creative employment of sound. Often the only background score is the fluttering of wings; the cameras get so close we can see the birds' muscles straining as they thump the air.Nature's rhythm is so balanced one cannot help but wonder how magnificent its choreographer must be. One species of cranes does a sort of dance, almost ballet-like. At least until one of them tumbles over. There's something strangely elegant in the way a flock of predator birds swipe at other birds in the air, or do synchronized swimming on the surface of a lake. Even a relatively grotesque scene with crabs chasing down an injured bird carries along with it a struggle to survive on both ends.It isn't all pretty pictures though, the film has a subtle undercurrent against man's tinkering with nature. The freedom of flight is suddenly interrupted by hunting, and the score abruptly ends as a gun is fired and a goose falls struggling from the sky. One shot somehow makes a duck decoy in the water scary. Agricultural machinery invades the nest of a hatchling. In another scene, a company rests in an industrial plant, avoiding many obstacles but finding danger in an oily mess.The beauty of the film lies in how it achieves a sense of natural endurance. Birds have been doing this for as long as they have existed, but a juxtaposed shot of the World Trade Center reminds us how all of our technological and architectural wonders are, in the wider scheme of things, trivial and fleeting.I do have a minor gripe. The seasonal migration of birds is still quite a mystery (birds fly the same exact route, often thousands of miles, year after year) but the narrative provides little insight into its secrets, content instead in naming the different species and the distances they fly. This was perhaps a directorial decision, there's a lot in the film that needs no language, but still one that I shall deduct a star for.Treat yourself to it at least once, you'll be struck with awe and envy for those wings in the sky.

A superb documentary that also seves as one of the greatest stories of adventure ever filmed; though the birds's migrations are the focal point we see numerous aspects of the lives of these fascinating creatures.  Their travels are often over tremendous distances and against incredible dangers - as with the emperor penguins in the magnificent ""March Of The Penguins"", it's just amazing what these winged beings overcome on an annual basis.  The hardships faced aren't the only aspect of ""Winged Migration"": the beauty, incredible cuteness, personalities and majesty of the movie's subjects are often front and center.The cinematography capturing all this is phenomenal, often filmed high up in the sky, apparantly using hang-gliders, hot-air balloons and the like.  It's rare that a visual record of this scale has ever been attempted in capturing one of the world's greatest real-life wonders.  Imagine a film in which, scene after scene, every shot is like the best photos in National Geographic or the best nature 'coffee table' type books, and you've got the idea of what ""Winged Migration"" captures.  Everything that's been said about the impact of this movie, and more, is proven true as soon as one starts watching this.""Winged Migration"" is rated G, but one might want to make sure that younger children watch it with an older person.  The challenges faced by the birds are tremendous, and not all of their stories meet with happy endings, sometimes obviously and other times with situations that can only be surmised as being unlikely to end well.  Although it's shown as non-graphically as it can be while still faithfully recording the events - and while obviously made with an eye towards heightening awareness of the unnecessary dangers faced by the birds due to human factors [i.e. the now polluted and despoiled areas travelled through by some of the migrators] - some of the footage can be difficult to take, and can make you wish someone had lent a helping hand.

It could have been a great documentary but instead they made a mediocre artsy film out of it.

The narration is very sparse and sometimes you would like just a little more explanation of what you are seeing.

776619,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000CGNEH,Tsuyoshi,"[24, 25]","[The following review is based on the version released in Japan, which runs 99 minutes.]Director of this Oscar-nominated documentary ""The Travelling Birds"" aka ""Winged Migration"" is Jacque Perrin, perhaps best remembered for his role in ""Cinema Paradisso"" (as adult Salvatore), but he is also a producer whose works include ""Himalaya"" and ""Microcomos,"" and he now again delivers an astonishing film about the migratory birds.  If you like beautiful photography, don't miss it.The film, shot over the time of three years, is about the migratory birds -- cranes, swans, and so on, even penguins (yes, some of them travel more than 500 miles) -- but do not be mistaken.  The narration is limited to the minimum amount, and the film does not tell much about the birds' habits, or reasons for or the ways of traveling.  The strength of the film solely lies in its visuals, which, as other reviewer says, would make you wonder ""How did they do it?""Yes, the camera follows as close as possible to the FLYING birds, very near to their side, or even to their tails, so you can watch the wings beating the air or the slight movements of feathers.  The camera work is simply incredible, tracing the birds over the stormy sea or the snow-covered wilderness, and it captures the lively features of these birds that fly so powerfully and gracefully.But some parts of the film, though not explicitly, shows the perils of their long travel that ranges more than thousand miles.  The film reveals plights of birds, sometimes deaths, in a very understated way.  The beauty of the film does not hide the reality of their travel, which are in fact very dangerous.According to the material I bought at a multiplex in Japan, the  camera crew too had to fly to chase the flying birds, using the light-weight plane to get closer to them.  If you have seen Anna Paquin's 1996 film ""Fly Away Home,"" you may remember a small airplane she rode, with a triangular wing over the saddle and a propeller at the back of it.  So, the filmmakers were also risking their lives.Beautiful as the film is, you may feel a little weary after seeing many shots of these birds, for the film intentionally avoids introducing a story in it.  Instead of that, the film let the birds show their lives as much as they can.  Sometimes they are humorous, sometime painful, but always beautiful, and that is the greatest merit of the film.",5,Fly Away Home: Astonishing Documentary on Migratory Birds,1050710400,"04 19, 2003",2003,2388,"['[', 'following', 'review', 'based', 'version', 'released', 'Japan', '99', 'minutes', ']', 'Director', 'Oscar-nominated', 'documentary', 'Travelling', 'Birds', 'aka', 'Winged', 'Migration', 'Jacque', 'Perrin', 'perhaps', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'Cinema', 'Paradisso', 'adult', 'Salvatore', 'also', 'producer', 'works', 'include', 'Himalaya', 'Microcomos', 'now', 'again', 'delivers', 'astonishing', 'film', 'migratory', 'birds', 'like', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'it.The', 'film', 'shot', 'time', 'three', 'years', 'migratory', 'birds', 'cranes', 'swans', 'so', 'even', 'penguins', 'yes', 'travel', 'more', '500', 'miles', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'mistaken', 'narration', 'limited', 'minimum', 'amount', 'film', 'not', 'tell', 'much', 'birds', 'habits', 'reasons', 'ways', 'traveling', 'strength', 'film', 'solely', 'visuals', 'other', 'reviewer', 'would', 'make', 'wonder', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'Yes', 'camera', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'FLYING', 'birds', 'very', 'side', 'even', 'tails', 'can', 'watch', 'wings', 'beating', 'air', 'slight', 'movements', 'feathers', 'camera', 'work', 'simply', 'incredible', 'tracing', 'birds', 'stormy', 'sea', 'snow-covered', 'wilderness', 'lively', 'features', 'birds', 'fly', 'so', 'powerfully', 'gracefully.But', 'parts', 'film', 'not', 'explicitly', 'perils', 'long', 'travel', 'more', 'thousand', 'miles', 'film', 'reveals', 'plights', 'birds', 'sometimes', 'deaths', 'very', 'understated', 'way', 'beauty', 'film', 'not', 'hide', 'reality', 'travel', 'are', 'fact', 'very', 'dangerous.According', 'material', 'bought', 'multiplex', 'Japan', 'camera', 'crew', 'too', 'had', 'fly', 'chase', 'flying', 'birds', 'using', 'light-weight', 'plane', 'get', 'closer', 'have', 'seen', 'Anna', 'Paquin', '1996', 'film', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'may', 'remember', 'small', 'airplane', 'rode', 'triangular', 'wing', 'saddle', 'propeller', 'back', 'So', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'also', 'risking', 'lives.Beautiful', 'film', 'may', 'feel', 'little', 'weary', 'seeing', 'many', 'shots', 'birds', 'film', 'intentionally', 'introducing', 'story', 'Instead', 'film', 'let', 'birds', 'show', 'lives', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'humorous', 'sometime', 'painful', 'always', 'beautiful', 'greatest', 'merit', 'film']",Winged Migration
776620,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0000CGNEH,Tucker Andersen,"[6, 8]","This is a work of art that took director and co-producer Jacques Perrin four years to film. Amazingly, the five crews involved used no special effects to film the birds, but instead used a huge variety of equipment including gliders, balloons and helicopters to track the various birds on their long distance migratory journeys on routes that encompassed as many as 12,000 miles. In fact, a special aircraft was developed specifically for use in this film. (See FILM JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL for more detail.) And the effect is in many ways a tour de force. Many of the sequences are thrilling, on occasion you actually get the sensation of flying with the birds.This is more than just a film with spectacular footage of birds in flight; it is also a nature film that illustrates the harshness of life and the difficulty of survival for these creatures. Of course, there is the arduous nature of the migration itself, but also the difficulty of gathering sufficient food, the danger of predators (especially of the injured and the young), and even spectacular footage of a natural disaster (an Himalayan avalanche). There are also shots of the harm inflicted by humans - birds caught in industrial pollution, birds trapped for sale, and birds in flight shot by hunters as their formations pass overhead. Thus, despite its beauty this is not a film for the sqeamish. ( Interestingly, man's influence is also shown to be beneficial at times, as when a freighter is used as a resting place for some exhausted birds far from land during their migration to the Antarctic summer. )There is occasional narration by Perrin (in English but heavily accented) and some brief descriptive subtitles regarding the species being viewed and their migratory routes, but the film is almost entirely a visual experience broken only by the sounds of the birds and the noises of their habitat. It is very moving, and the beginning and final scenes have a wonderful symmetry. To fully appreciate the artistry of this film and feel at one with the birds you preferably should see it in a theater on a large screen or at least in a totally darkened room with no distractions on a very large screen TV. This is not a movie to be watched casually while involved in other activities.With such glowing words of praise, why not an unreservedly enthusiastic five star rating? For several reasons - first, I felt that the film would have benefitted greatly if more information concerning what we were watching had been presented to the viewers. The use of more extensive subtitles could have done this very unobtrusively. Second, to the extent posssible it would have been more interesting if it contained a better balance between examples of the larger birds which dominated the film and other species. (Maybe they found this too technically challenging.) Third,it would have been very educational without detracting from the exoerience if there had been some explanation of the techiques used and a chance for the theatergoers to actually see some of the equipment used. (I.e., let us go watch some of the filming itself. Of course, this could be included on a DVD, but this is a documentary and if presented at the start of the film would have enhanced our experience while viewing it.) It would have also addressed my final observation - that paradoxically I felt that the film was both too long and too short. It is approximately ninety minutes in length; after about an hour some of the footage started to seem repetitive. And yet when it concluded I felt that I wanted to know more and there were aspects of this incredible endeavor that were left uncovered. Thus, an introductory background which included some of the footage seen later in the film would have relieved some of the monotony which I began to experience near the conclusion. Also, my personal criteria for a five star rating include a desire to see the film multiple times and probably own the DVD, and those criteria are not met in this case. So, if the subject matter appeals to you, I highly recommend this film but it is definitely for a limited audience.",4,(3 1/2) Amazing Cineamatography- A Stunningly Beautiful Film,1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,4097,"['work', 'art', 'took', 'director', 'co-producer', 'Jacques', 'Perrin', 'four', 'years', 'film', 'Amazingly', 'five', 'crews', 'involved', 'used', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'birds', 'instead', 'used', 'huge', 'variety', 'equipment', 'including', 'gliders', 'balloons', 'helicopters', 'track', 'various', 'birds', 'long', 'distance', 'migratory', 'journeys', 'routes', 'encompassed', 'as', 'many', '12,000', 'miles', 'fact', 'special', 'aircraft', 'was', 'developed', 'specifically', 'use', 'film', 'See', 'FILM', 'JOURNAL', 'INTERNATIONAL', 'more', 'detail', 'effect', 'many', 'ways', 'tour', 'force', 'Many', 'sequences', 'are', 'thrilling', 'occasion', 'actually', 'get', 'sensation', 'flying', 'birds.This', 'more', 'just', 'film', 'spectacular', 'footage', 'birds', 'flight', 'also', 'nature', 'film', 'harshness', 'life', 'difficulty', 'survival', 'creatures', 'course', 'arduous', 'nature', 'migration', 'also', 'difficulty', 'gathering', 'sufficient', 'food', 'danger', 'predators', 'especially', 'injured', 'young', 'even', 'spectacular', 'footage', 'natural', 'disaster', 'Himalayan', 'avalanche', 'are', 'also', 'shots', 'harm', 'inflicted', 'humans', 'birds', 'caught', 'industrial', 'pollution', 'birds', 'trapped', 'sale', 'birds', 'flight', 'shot', 'hunters', 'formations', 'pass', 'overhead', 'Thus', 'beauty', 'not', 'film', 'sqeamish', 'Interestingly', 'man', 'influence', 'also', 'shown', 'be', 'beneficial', 'times', 'when', 'freighter', 'used', 'resting', 'place', 'exhausted', 'birds', 'far', 'land', 'migration', 'Antarctic', 'summer', 'occasional', 'narration', 'Perrin', 'English', 'heavily', 'accented', 'brief', 'descriptive', 'subtitles', 'regarding', 'species', 'being', 'viewed', 'migratory', 'routes', 'film', 'almost', 'entirely', 'visual', 'experience', 'broken', 'only', 'sounds', 'birds', 'noises', 'habitat', 'very', 'moving', 'beginning', 'final', 'scenes', 'have', 'wonderful', 'symmetry', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'artistry', 'film', 'feel', 'one', 'birds', 'preferably', 'should', 'see', 'theater', 'large', 'screen', 'least', 'totally', 'darkened', 'room', 'distractions', 'very', 'large', 'screen', 'TV', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'watched', 'casually', 'involved', 'other', 'activities.With', 'such', 'glowing', 'words', 'praise', 'why', 'not', 'unreservedly', 'enthusiastic', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'several', 'reasons', 'first', 'felt', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'greatly', 'more', 'information', 'concerning', 'what', 'were', 'watching', 'had', 'been', 'presented', 'viewers', 'use', 'more', 'extensive', 'subtitles', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'unobtrusively', 'Second', 'extent', 'posssible', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'contained', 'better', 'balance', 'examples', 'larger', 'birds', 'dominated', 'film', 'other', 'species', 'Maybe', 'found', 'too', 'technically', 'challenging', 'Third', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'educational', 'detracting', 'exoerience', 'had', 'been', 'explanation', 'techiques', 'used', 'chance', 'theatergoers', 'actually', 'see', 'equipment', 'used', 'I.e.', 'let', 'go', 'watch', 'filming', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'included', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'presented', 'start', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'experience', 'viewing', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'addressed', 'final', 'observation', 'paradoxically', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'short', 'approximately', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'length', 'hour', 'footage', 'started', 'seem', 'repetitive', 'yet', 'when', 'concluded', 'felt', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'were', 'aspects', 'incredible', 'endeavor', 'were', 'left', 'uncovered', 'Thus', 'introductory', 'background', 'included', 'footage', 'seen', 'later', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'relieved', 'monotony', 'began', 'experience', 'conclusion', 'Also', 'personal', 'criteria', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'include', 'desire', 'see', 'film', 'multiple', 'times', 'probably', 'own', 'DVD', 'criteria', 'are', 'not', 'met', 'case', 'So', 'subject', 'matter', 'appeals', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'definitely', 'limited', 'audience']",Winged Migration

That's how I felt after watching this otherwise beautiful, serene and sometimes heartbreaking depiction of birds in flight.One of the principles of movie making is continuity. Winged Migration doesn't have it. One of the principles of documentaries is that one provides at least rudimentary background info on the subject being covered; Winged Migration is inconsistent. Whereas March of the Penguins had (for me) just one moment where I felt the editing had missed something, Winged Migration could have been a thousand times better than what is presented here. No frame of reference; some footage of birds that apparently don't migrate; awkward subtitles introducing the name of a bird and where they begin and end their migration; not a single bird's voyage covered from beginning to end.To make matters worse, the entire project is not made with birds at large, rather, it's all staged. I understand from the behind the scenes footage that it was necessary to raise the birds from egg to adulthood together with humans so that the birds would be adjusted to human presence, facilitating film making, but why then is it necessary to include footage of birds being killed on a hunt and birds dying while traversing difficult (industrial) terrain? Isn't the average viewer already aware of the difficulties birds face? If this type of footage is so important, why leave out commentary that could describe the setting, the motivation, and the result of human environmental intervention on bird populations chances of survival, for example?What bothered me most though was the lack of continuity and the hopping around from one continent to another and back. With regard to the sparse commentary, it sounds like the director decided he would provide the commentary himself rather than a trained actor or voice-over specialist.All in all, this movie doesn't do credit to the effort of the many humans and birds involved in its making. I hope that someone will be allowed to rescue the remaining many miles of footage and create a better product.

Thankfully, I took a chance and my fears were assuaged upon arrival.This repackaged version with the 3-picture-band cover appears to have the same special features as the original release, such as the 'Making-of' documentary featurette, the full-length Director's Commentary, a featurette on 'Creating the Music', a 'Photo Gallery with Filmmaker Commentary', Interviews, Bonus Trailers, Animated Menus, Scene Selections, and Weblink.

It is like watching one of those tv specials where all the magic tricks are explained. Interesting, but you never look at them the same way. The doc will explain how it was all done.

I actually saw it twice in the theatre, and I was so mesmerized to see what an amazing journey the birds endured during migration season.Aside from the impeccable cinematography when capturing the birds on film, it was also quite educational to learn how the birds survive the weather, finding food, and guiding the younger generation. The birds migrate in a group, and sometimes they may not make it to the final destination, because they get shot by the hunters in the wild. I was very disturbed to see that scene. There are some comical moments when the some of the birds have a peculiar behaviours, such as the way they dance or swim or sing. It really showed the characteristics of individual kind of birds.The soundtrack is very enjoyable, because it is well coordinated with the birds movements. The ""making of"" in the dvd's special feature is worth watching, because they show you all the behind the scenes and the complicated preparation and training of some the birds including the Canada Geese.

It's full of inner silence, rather than the inner cacophony of most American stuff.  Maybe someone in Hollywood will take a lesson from it.
