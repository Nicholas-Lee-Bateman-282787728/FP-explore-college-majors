232831,A1SNW62LJ7OEFH,6300268764,"Mr. Bernie Tinirau ""BERNIE T""","[0, 0]",One of my all time favourites...a very well acted drama with a great cast fronted by a very young and handsome Richard Gere. Has some wonderful moments of acting particularly from Paul Sorvino....I suppose it is a bit of a man's movie as opposed to a chick flick but it can be enjoyed by everyone.

Gere is great in this role and it's nice to see Marilu Henner in a small supporting role.  I really enjoyed the relationship between Gere's role and his younger brother, and only wish there were more scenes of this.  Also, look for a pre Freddy Kruger Robert Englund in this film  Good relationship,character study and good acting by all.",4,Forgotten Richard Gere gem,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,434,"['had', 'totally', 'forgotten', 'film', 'recently', 'purchased', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Gere', 'great', 'role', 'nice', 'see', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'relationship', 'Gere', 'role', 'younger', 'brother', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'scenes', 'Also', 'look', 'pre', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'film', 'Good', 'relationship', 'character', 'study', 'good', 'acting']",N/A

Loud and boisterous are Tony and Paul. this is the story of an Italian family struggling to survive in 1975 (????) there was a struggle???? Anyway, Richard Gere loves his little brother, Richard is a young 18 maybe and the little brother is maybe 6 or 7. Here it comes...little brother is thin...OH MY GOD! the mother played by Lelia Goldoni, is a nightmare in every possible way...overacts and her character is literally a moron...screeching about killing herself because her son is thin?????!!!!!!
