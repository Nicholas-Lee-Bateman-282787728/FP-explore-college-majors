222743,A2582KMXLK2P06,6300216756,B. E Jackson,"[1, 4]","Yes, Lifeguard is a severely dated film about a lifeguard who has to make a tough decision whether he wants to continue being a lifeguard on the sandy beaches of California, or get a more serious job as a car salesman.Along the way he falls in love with about 3 different women.  Which one will he end up with?  You'll have to watch it the entire way through in order to find out... that is, if you don't become bored in the process.This movie slightly misses the mark in a few area.  For one thing, it's not interesting the entire way through.  Like many 70's films, the storyline is designed in a way to focus on a handsome lead character (in this case, Sam Elliott).  This kind of drives me nuts because there's more to a storyline than simply focusing *constantly* on one star.It's especially annoying because the camera work follows Sam Elliott's character as he smiles, laughs, becomes angry at something (or someone) etc.  This is more a complaint I have with 70's films period.  It's like following the lead character around all over the place is supposed to be a good enough substitute for a weak storyline.  It's not.  As a result, the majority of a movie like Lifeguard feels like complete filler.What it comes down to however is the fact that the storyline is just really weak.  The only truly exciting moments are when Sam's character gets involved in all kinds of weird or dangerous situations at the beach in his lifeguard role.  He deals with all kinds of troublemakers and perverts.I felt this movie just doesn't have a good enough storyline to take up over an hour and a half of playtime.  I realize it's a 70's film so we can't expect top of the line storytelling quality, but it most certainly could have been more interesting than this.",3,it's a love story...

Much like the main character, Lifeguard Rick, the viewer subtly touches on so many different emotions during this film that it's hard to define exactly what you're experiencing at any given time. But in the end you are left with a quiet contentment, an understanding and acceptance of who you are and what is the right choice for yourself no matter what the mainstream opinion might be.Paul Williams' song ""Time and Tide"" was removed from the soundtrack when this movie hit the T.V. screen.

222753,A14JEURPY1CXZB,6300216756,James D. Leverton,"[40, 41]","It's amazing to me which films endure and which don't.  After 40 years, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" looks like a relic from another era, and it's considered an all-time classic.  Yet 30 years after it's release, Daniel Petrie's minor 1976 film ""Lifeguard"" looks as good now as it did upon its release, and remains as timely and vital as ever, even though noone would consider it a classic of its era.Actually, on the big screen, ""Lifeguard"" resembled a glorified TV movie.  On TV, however, it looks great, especially in this wonderful widescreen transfer.  And it serves as a reminder that sometimes small, heartfelt films with modest aspirations can endure and be effective long after the same era's pretentious and overblown message pictures.  ""Lifeguard"" could be described as ""Baywatch"" with brains, but its much more than that.  How wonderful it is to see a movie set in Southern California and on the beach where the beachgoers look like real people and not surgically-altered superbabes.  And although all of the featured lifeguards are men, you get the idea if they hired a woman, she'd look like Alexandra Paul and not Pamela Anderson.  Even the women star Sam Elliott gets involved with look like real, average women--future Oscar nominees Kathleen Quinlan and Anne Archer chief among them.  Believe me, it's a real treat to watch normal people onscreen for a change.Elliott stars as Rick, a career lifeguard who is beginning another summer on the beach, with a new assistant/trainee (Parker Stevenson).  He befriends a lonely teenager (Quinlan) who has just moved to L.A. from San Diego (and who has an obvious crush on him), has a few one-night stands and meets his parents for dinner, whereas his father lets him know he's tired of his son wasting his life at the beach.  This sends him into an early mid-life crisis, especially when an old high school friend who owns a Porsche dealership offers him a ""respectable"" job selling cars.  But it's not until he attends his 15-year high school reunion and reunites with his divorced high school flame Cathy (Archer) that he begins to seriously consider hanging up his trunks for good, especially when Cathy lets him know her interest depends on it.  So, obviously, Rick has some serious thinking to do:  give up the job he loves for the respectability of a job he doesn't.  It's a simple story, but as most simple stories do, it resonates still.""Lifeguard"" is a sweet, even funny movie that will obviously appeal to women, but is also a painless date film.  The entire cast is good, with Elliott the obvious standout.  Filmed before he matured into the grizzled, tough cop/cowboy/military type he now excels at, it's refreshing to see him play such a regular, flawed guy.  My only problem with his character is that he is so level-headed, a decision he makes involving his relationship with Quinlan's character seems completely out of character and even more stupid than it is.  Maybe it's because today's morality is so much different than it was then.  Either way, it's a jolt.  Also, Quinlan is typically wonderful, and Stevenson offers able support as the rookie and Rick's sounding board.  Archer, although second-billed, doesn't make her entrance until the second half of the film and then has barely ten minutes screen time.  She's professional as always.The photography and look of the film still look great so many years later, with none of the swimwear or fashions seemingly out-of-date, compared to other eras.

I did things like that in the 70s, and would probably still do them today if I could get away with it. It's the kind of stuff that makes a bad movie great!And a movie worth owning for its historical value alone. Plus, it's amusing and excruciating at the same time.This five-star pick is an absolutely horrible movie, a shallow tale, one that I'll bet Sam Elliott is embarassed by (understandably), and probably posterity's most succinct, accurate snapshot of youth lifestyles on the Southern California coast in the 1970s. I know because I was there -- I was only a year or two older than Kathleen Quinlan's character, almost as cute, and easily as stupid.

We may also remember how the loose morality of the times made for a lot of cheap fun and worse misery. The tortuously sappy soundtrack captures it perfectly. The movie is a profile in the worst of 1970s America.I give this movie five stars because it is so pleasantly and unpleasantly honest and accurate. It presents authentic insight into the bad 70s.

He wants Rick to come work for him.  To add to this, he goes to his thirty year high school reunion.

I finally saw it again, thirty years later, time of course changed that, but it's still a nostalgic film, and a very good one at that.Like a lot of films from that era, there are aspects of it that are dated, especially in it's look, the costumes, hair styles, and attitude. But there's something wondrous about Sam Elliot's character (Rick), and the inner struggle of his character growing older as a lifeguard. And the ending was both revealing, even a little inspiring. So while on the surface, this film might look like Baywatch 70's style, it has way, way more meaning than that.What's interesting for me is that at 14 I wanted to be the hunky guy who drives a corvette, gets the girls, and is confident, quiet and strong. I never became that, and by the time I was 30, my life, and certainly career, was in a very different direction. But a little part of me still lived that dream. What made watching the film many years later quite interesting is that while I never was a hunky lifeguard, etc. I went through my share of relationships, career changes, and difficulties of aging in a changing world, which made Rick a character I think a lot of us could identify with. That might make this sound like a guy movie, but it's not. It's a good (if a bit old) date film too, and I think a lot of women would like it as well.The film still looks good, with good cinematography presented in a nice widescreen format, the acting is good, especially Elliot who may surprise some here, and it sounds good.

I never heard of it before but the story took me right in and captivated me throughout. This is truly a secret gem from the 70s.What makes it work so well? For one thing the film is truly realistic. It's like they filmed a story of real people. That's how good the writing and acting is.Parker Stevenson appears as a lifeguard apprentice who works with Elliott throughout the summer. The fact that he's a college student and goes back to school at the end of the film adds to Elliott's crisis.A handful of items I found interesting in the story:-- Elliott instructs Stevenson to not mess with the underage cuties on the beach who often tend to flirt with lifeguards. He then does this very thing with a girl named Wendy (Quinlin), who says she's 17 but could very well be as young as 15 (girls are known to lie in such situations). Elliott's character in the film seems pretty mature, honest and intelligent. Was he being hypocritical? I think his actions reveal the crisis he's undergoing. He's getting older and his manhood is being threatened by the numerous people encouraging him to get a ""real"" job. Wendy makes him feel like a man and he unwisely gives into temptation. I lost some respect for the character when this happened but, you'll see, he ""sees the light"" later on.-- The film effectively shows that Wendy wasn't ready for a sexual relationship with Elliott or anyone else. When Elliott informs her that they simply can't be together her breakdown is potent. This leads to another event that, I'm sure, drives home the point for Elliott to never mess with ""jailbait"" ever again.-- At Elliott's reunion he gets tired of hearing negative reactions to his still being a lifeguard so he opts for ambiguity, ""I work for the county."" Have you ever done that?-- The film reflects the loose sexual morals of the pre-AIDS 70s era e.g. ""You're hot, let's have sex! And, no, I'm not interested in marriage."" Also, one woman is shown totally nude near the beginning. Despite this, it's NOT a T&A; exploitation flick; the flimmakers were obviously simply shooting for realism. To support this, the beach scenes are filled with realistic-looking people, unlike Baywatch which exclusively showed incredibly bodacious babes walking the beach in the background. I've been to numerous southern Californian beaches on four separate vacations and know this isn't true.-- Speaking of Baywatch, that tv series obviously used ""Lifeguard"" as a prototype. I've only seen a couple of whole episodes in my life so I'm not the right person to ascertain that show's quality, but I think it's pretty safe to say there's no comparison. In other words, don't allow a negative impression of Baywatch keep you away from ""Lifeguard.""-- Elliot's friend (Stephen Young) encourages him to take a lucrative job selling Porsches. When he goes to the dealership for an interview you can tell he's almost ready to lose his cookies at the prospect of being a car salesman despite the better money. Have you ever experienced this? I have.The film runs 96 minutes and was filmed on location on the beaches just south of L.A. (Torrance).The score is 70s light pop, including Paul Williams ""Time and Tide."" It's not to my tastes but it fits the film.FINAL ANALYSIS: ""Lifeguard"" is about numerous important topics that we can all relate to -- aging, career choices, (early) mid-life crisis, manhood, staying true to oneself, responsibility, love, sex, competition, consequences, and much more. Although it's generally a ""quiet film"" it smacks of reality and is full of insights. If you're in the mood for a great drama you can't go wrong. And, yes, this is Elliott's best role and performance IMHO.PERSONAL GRADE: A",5,Great drama about the summer of '75 in southern California,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,4287,"['Filmed', '1975', 'Lifeguard', 'story', 'aging', 'L.A.', 'lifeguard', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'summer', ""'75"", 'early', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'when', 'friends', 'family', 'continually', 'reveal', 'disappoval', 'career', 'choice', 'heightened', 'when', '15-year', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'where', 'recently-divorced', 'ex-flame', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Elliot', 'cute', 'underage', 'teen', 'beach', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlin', 'who', 'feel', 'Adonis.I', 'remember', 'cathing', 'Lifeguard', 'tv', 'sometime', ""'90s"", 'can', 'remember', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'heard', 'story', 'took', 'right', 'captivated', 'truly', 'secret', 'gem', '70s.What', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'truly', 'realistic', 'filmed', 'story', 'real', 'people', 'how', 'good', 'writing', 'acting', 'is.Parker', 'Stevenson', 'lifeguard', 'apprentice', 'who', 'Elliott', 'summer', 'fact', 'college', 'student', 'back', 'school', 'end', 'film', 'Elliott', 'crisis.A', 'handful', 'items', 'found', 'interesting', 'story', 'Elliott', 'Stevenson', 'not', 'mess', 'underage', 'cuties', 'beach', 'who', 'often', 'tend', 'flirt', 'lifeguards', 'then', 'very', 'thing', 'girl', 'named', 'Wendy', 'Quinlin', 'who', '17', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'as', 'young', '15', 'girls', 'are', 'known', 'lie', 'such', 'situations', 'Elliott', 'character', 'film', 'pretty', 'mature', 'honest', 'intelligent', 'being', 'hypocritical', 'think', 'actions', 'reveal', 'crisis', 'undergoing', 'getting', 'older', 'manhood', 'being', 'threatened', 'numerous', 'people', 'encouraging', 'get', 'real', 'job', 'Wendy', 'feel', 'man', 'unwisely', 'temptation', 'lost', 'respect', 'character', 'when', 'happened', ""'ll"", 'see', 'light', 'later', 'on.', 'film', 'effectively', 'Wendy', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Elliott', 'anyone', 'else', 'When', 'Elliott', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', 'breakdown', 'potent', 'event', ""'m"", 'sure', 'home', 'point', 'Elliott', 'never', 'mess', 'jailbait', 'ever', 'Elliott', 'reunion', 'tired', 'hearing', 'negative', 'reactions', 'still', 'being', 'lifeguard', 'ambiguity', 'work', 'county', 'Have', 'ever', 'done', 'film', 'loose', 'sexual', 'morals', 'pre-AIDS', '70s', 'era', 'e.g', ""'re"", 'hot', 'let', 'have', 'sex', ""'m"", 'not', 'interested', 'marriage', 'Also', 'one', 'woman', 'shown', 'totally', 'nude', 'beginning', 'NOT', 'T', 'A', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'flimmakers', 'were', 'obviously', 'simply', 'shooting', 'realism', 'support', 'beach', 'scenes', 'are', 'filled', 'realistic-looking', 'people', 'Baywatch', 'exclusively', 'showed', 'incredibly', 'bodacious', 'babes', 'walking', 'beach', 'background', ""'ve"", 'been', 'numerous', 'southern', 'Californian', 'beaches', 'four', 'separate', 'vacations', 'know', ""n't"", 'true.', 'Speaking', 'Baywatch', 'tv', 'series', 'obviously', 'used', 'Lifeguard', 'prototype', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'couple', 'whole', 'episodes', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'right', 'person', 'ascertain', 'show', 'quality', 'think', 'pretty', 'safe', 'say', 'comparison', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'negative', 'impression', 'Baywatch', 'keep', 'away', 'Lifeguard', 'Elliot', 'friend', 'Stephen', 'Young', 'take', 'lucrative', 'job', 'selling', 'Porsches', 'When', 'dealership', 'interview', 'can', 'tell', 'almost', 'ready', 'lose', 'cookies', 'prospect', 'being', 'car', 'salesman', 'better', 'money', 'Have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'have.The', 'film', 'runs', '96', 'minutes', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'beaches', 'just', 'south', 'L.A.', 'Torrance', '.The', 'score', '70s', 'light', 'pop', 'including', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'Time', 'Tide', 'not', 'tastes', 'film.FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'Lifeguard', 'about', 'numerous', 'important', 'topics', 'can', 'relate', 'aging', 'career', 'choices', 'early', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'manhood', 'staying', 'true', 'oneself', 'responsibility', 'love', 'sex', 'competition', 'consequences', 'much', 'more', 'generally', 'quiet', 'film', 'reality', 'full', 'insights', ""'re"", 'mood', 'great', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'yes', 'Elliott', 'best', 'role', 'performance', 'IMHO.PERSONAL', 'GRADE', 'A']",Lifeguard VHS
