44337,AK2Q7ML2RANDN,0783117388,A. Eby,"[3, 9]","To know the title of ""Sex and the City"" is to know its premise: four female friends who live in New York and talk about sex throughout each episode.  Being a show about sex (and being on HBO), it is extremely ribald and frequently graphic.  I'm often pretty appalled at Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte's antics, and sometimes disgusted.  Here are four beautiful, designer-clothes-bedecked women with all the time in the world to eat in fancy NYC restaurants and talk about the men they sleep with.  Where's the reality in that?  Where's the morality?  Well, the show advertises itself as being about sex; it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  It's unnecessary to show Miranda in court or Samantha in an office.  That's not what we want to know about these women.  As far as the second question goes, all I can say is, if you want morality, don't watch TV.  I passionately love ""The Sopranos"" and don't feel a bit guilty watching it, and it's certainly not more moral than ""Sex"".  So I've given up telling myself not to watch it.  It's really quite addicting.  The characters are so vivid, the acting so spot-on, and the humor so sharp that it's hard not to like the show.  Miranda and Samantha are particular favorites of mine.  They're silly, neurotic, childish, and absolutely lovable.  I may not care too much for the premise, but I could watch those two mix cement and enjoy myself.

44344,A33693RRRFK55Q,0783117388,"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted""","[29, 55]","Ughhh....OK, I HATE this show.  I know the women love it, and so do most of the gay boys.  Well, I'm a gay boy, but to me this show is like the straight female version of ""Queer As Folk"" - i.e., a relentless pandering to the stereotypical stupidities of a particular demo.  To mention only one minor point: no straight man would ever be interested in any of these women, so the ""sex"" part is immediately suspect.  But of course this show isn't actually about sex - it's about clothes clothes clothes.  Which brings up another point: why do women feel that it's empowering to be represented as vapid label whores?What's worse, this show has allowed people like Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrell to actually think that they are hot stuff, so now we'll have to look at endless shampoo commercials in which they try to appear ""sexy"" (or something) for the camera.  I swear, the next time I see SJP on a magazine cover looking like somebody just smacked her right in her ugly mug (her version of ""sexy""), but obviously really just modeling her several thousand dollars in threads and bling, I'm gonna barf on the newsstand.  Besides, I'm pretty convinced she's a drag queen - like a bad one, like the kind you'd see drunk on the bus at midnight - in spite of her alleged children with (the obviously gay) Matthew Broderick.  Then there's Cattrell, who is like some kind of dessicated blond debutante that probably turned heads once, you know, sometime back in the eighteenth century.  Again, only her gay fans find her attractive, and that's more of an academic thing.  But of course, the very mediocrity of their looks is one of the true reasons these women are such a hit with women.  The SITC ""girls"" all have a steady stream of hot young studs pandering to their vaseline-lens fantasy of themselves as liberated, desirable women, and the female viewership feeds off this vicariously.  To the effect that you really are more likely, in this post-SITC world, to hear a throng of middle-aged women at the next table cackling loudly over the poor sexual performance of their respective mates, as an occassional break in their otherwise nonstop dissection of the latest Dolce & Gabbana catalog.Sorry, but ""IMHO,"" this show does nothing positive for women. Actually it makes for a fairly airtight explanation of the historical ascendancy of men - we rule the earth because you're too busy matching obscenely overpriced handbags with grotesquely expensive shoes.  Not that I really think this of women (necessarily), but just as ""QAF"" would leave you with the impression that all gay men are conceited, puerile, sexaholic idiots with recreational drug habits, ""SITC"" firmly entrenches females in the old stereotype of shallow, catty, emotionally stunted fashion plates whose sole idea of ""empowerment"" is to be lit well as they pounce victoriously towards the camera swathed head to toe in somebody's Name.

44349,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0783117388,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[7, 7]","Based on the bestselling novel by Candace Bushnell, the HBO original series Sex And The City took the television world by storm following its release in the summer of 1998. Following the exploits of four young and educated female friends living and working in New York City, the show revolves around the various relationships and life problems experienced by each member of the group. Sporting an experienced and talented cast, the show has developed a strong, borderline fanatic following...Sarah Jessica Parker (the de facto lead character of the show) stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a popular sex columnist for a local newspaper who travels in numerous Manhattan social circles. Carrie is engaged in a tempestuous on-again, off-again relationship with a mystery man always referred to as ""Mr. Big"". The young urban professional shares her life with three best friends who have similarly interesting jobs - Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer tired of being single given the societal ramifications; Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), a promiscuous publicist who enjoys non-exclusive relationships; and Charlotte McDougal (Kristin Davis), an art museum curator who is relatively less open about her sexuality... Together, the women seek each other's advice on the ever-present and varying predicaments in which they find their romantic relationships...The Sex And The City (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere in which the four stars make a pact at Miranda's birthday party that they will start having sex like men (i.e. without feeling or attachment).

Those are just a few of the fairy tales of the show.  A post-feminist, post-modern fairy tale is exactly what SATC is....If these women honestly want a man to have a real relationship with, why do they find glaring defects in the available men they meet?

A more upscale, glittery crew than Seinfeld, but it's the same emotionally unavailable, incapable of having a relationship crew as the one on Seinfeld.  The women on SATC complain about modelizers, womanizers, and every other variety of -izers, but they're just as obsessed with ideas of male perfection.  It doesn't matter if the guy is sweet, kind, genuine, or otherwise acceptable.  If they can find one thing wrong with him, he gets discarded.  They're as shallow as the men they complain about.What are the chances that 4 women in NYC have their level of education and income, but not one of them is involved in a personal growth program?

Well, we live and ( hopefully ) learn!Alright, I'll be the first to confess that the above paragraph, while written tongue-in-cheek, does perhaps hold a hint of truth to it as well. But you'll have to let me explain why. After sitting through both discs of this ( not so ) groundbreaking HBO series I've just a couple of thoughts in mind. The first one being that while I enjoyed the show very much it also left me a vague, somewhat empty feeling inside. Don't misunderstand me, I like watching four attractive female leads ( and heaven forbid they shouldn't be attractive! ) in a cosmopolitan setting, with cute apts., cute clothes (and even cuter dates as well! ) but other than a little 'table talk' concerning sex ( and one or two 'steamy' scene's to keep it controversial! ) there was not much dialogue here that I found exactly mesmorizing. For the most part the women featured here, while successful in business, are in constant need of attention and reassurance. Again, while attractive, they simply aren't all that emotionally interesting! Samantha, played by the amazing Kim Cattrall, the one who 'sleeps around' the most, is without a doubt, because of her promiscuity, the most honest woman this show has to offer. While the others, at least in the first season, tend to eat, drink, talk and sleep ""SEX"" it is only Samantha who seems confident enough to live life by her own terms instead of merely complaining about the lack of men in their lives....or the lack of life in their men! It's been stated that men tend to think about sex at least once every twenty seconds....but if this series is any indication, than I suspect these women may actually have 'cornered the market' in that regard. Do female viewer's truly want another show that expounds the age old notion that all women do is whine and complain about men....and the virtues of shopping! Or are the creaters of this series, by writing characters that seem to be in a constant state of crisis concerning the opposite sex, simply pandering to women's worst instincts in attempting to keep viewer's tuned in.I don't doubt for a moment that the issues presented on this show are, at once, important and honest. But unfortunately, by resorting to the same  stereo-types that we've seen countless times before on the screen than I suspect that the 'meat' of these issues are being lost. And, sad to say, in the long run, it may inadvertenly sabotage the very show they've created. Again, it's obviously a very well put together program but , for the most part, it does have all the depth of an issue of Cosmopolitan magazine! Could it be that the producer's of "" Sex and the City "" want to have their cake and eat it to? Make no mistake, the creaters of this wonderful show are fully aware of what's marketable to women and it seems they've taken full advantage of their expertise in that area. To sell this program as 'ground-breaking' television by virtue of simply pushing the sex factor only proves how really purient ( to say nothing of being easily titillated! ) we as Americans still are . I guess, even after all these years, ""SEX"" really does sell!In the end, while I look forward to the second season ( yes, I know I'm behind already! ) I must admit that I may be watching the series for all the wrong reasons. And while I'm aware that there may be real concerns that are being addressed here I simply find it rather difficult to get past what I consider this 'lipstick vogue' factor that the show relies heavily on in an effort to keep the program trendy and "" hip "". I do like "" Sex and the City "" and no doubt men can learn some things from this program. But the real issue might just be "" IS THIS WHAT WOMEN REALLY WANT?

Having now wrapped its third season (and being catapulted from &quot;cult&quot; status to &quot;it&quot; show), this 2-disc set lets you experience these characters and appreciate how much they have developed over time. While this foursome might easily have fallen into mere stereotype, the writers and actresses have not made sure not to allow that to happen.  This is a smartly-written and perfectly-cast &quot;situation&quot; comedy.I have not noticed any quality issues with this DVD set that others have spoken about in their reviews...but I will likewise admit to not being not enough of an expert being fairly new to DVDs.  The set also includes the wonderful &quot;teaser&quot; commercials for each episode.  The shows definitely hold-up on repeat viewings (an important aspect to me for any DVD/video purchase).As the breeziest half-hour on television today (and the last couple of years), I recommend the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; set to any fans or the series or those who might not have HBO.

I was a little bit disturbed by the way Carrie talked to the camera in the first few episodes... but the first season kicks off the season by introducing us to the City that Never Sleeps.EPISODE 1 ""SEX AND THE CITY"": We meet the four ladies; Mr. Big comes onto the scene; we also meet Sanford Blatch and his opinion on gay relationships and sex; the women discuss (and try out) the theory that women can have sex the same way men can.EPISODE 2: ""MODELS AND MORTALS"": The episode is all about models, as Miranda dates a guy obsessed with them (a ""modelizer"") and Carrie briefly dates a man who is a model.EPISODE 3: ""BAY OF MARRIED PIGS"": Carrie visits married friends at their house in the Hamptons and the ladies discuss the differences between married couples and singles. Miranda is set up with a lesbian for a corporate party.EPISODE 4: ""VALLEY OF THE TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS"": Carrie keeps running into Big, and considers dating him; Samantha goes for a guy in his twenties.EPISODE 5: ""THE POWER OF FEMALE SEX"": While playing poker the four women discuss the idea of women using sex to gain power; Carrie runs into an old friend of hers who introduces her to a charming French architect.EPISODE 6: ""SECRET SEX"": You know that promotional photo of Carrie on the side of the bus in the credits? This is the episode in which that photo is taken. Carrie starts dating Big; she ponders the question of some people who are ashamed of the people they date; Charlotte dates a rabbi.EPISODE 7: ""THE MONOGAMISTS"": Carrie tries to have a monogamous relationship with Big; Miranda gets serious with Skipper.EPISODE 8: ""THREE'S A CROWD"": The ladies discuss the topic of threesomes, as Samantha becomes involved with a married couple and Charlotte and her boyfriend try to add another woman to their bedroom routine.EPISODE 9: ""THE TURTLE AND THE HARE"": At a friend's wedding, Samantha is asked out on a date by another guest; when she is dumped, she tries for another guy who was at the wedding.

44372,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,0783117388,"""eurotrashgirl""","[64, 69]","First she took LA, now she takes Manhattan! With Sex and the City, now in its third season on HBO, Sarah Jessica Parker has created a compulsively watchable series! Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, the alter-ego of real-life NYC-based writer Candace Bushnell (the blonde bombshell of Manhattan Sex Columnists!), who is the author of the book which started it all.Thanks to great writing, real-life NYC backgrounds, and enthusiastic acting by the four female leads, Sex and the City is nearly flawless in its excellence and fun. If it has a flaw, perhaps it is that it is *completely addicting*!In addition to Parker's Carrie, there's Samantha, the beautiful, fun, (read, quite a bit more promiscuous than even the daring of us would ever be in real life!), and ever-so-spunky PR Executive. Confident, hilarious, and tough, her one-liners are a highlight of the show. Samantha is played by the &quot;grow on you till you absolutely love her&quot; Kim Cattrall. Then there's Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), the lawyer who some at her law firm, where she is trying to make Partner, think is gay. She's also very spunky, and adds another dimension to the four-tette of gals with her dry humour and sarcasm. Finally, there's Charlotte (Kristin Davis), the self-described husband hunter who is much more conservative than the other three, but who still loves men, and who can't wait to find her Mr. Right. The comedy and fun lies in watching her search, often in vain, for just that, in the available (and as we see, sometimes not-so-available) pool of Manhattan men!To round things out, there are beautiful men to boot! There's Mr. Big, Carrie's on-again, off-again Prince Charming, who will slay you with his charm, his smile, his mysterious appearances, cute little waves (usually directed towards the smitten Carrie), and his just as mysterious disappearances. He's Beautiful Eye Candy, and has just enough of that Bad Boy Elixir to keep Carrie (and all of us) yearning for more more MORE! Mr. Big, or &quot;Big,&quot; as he is called by the ladies, is played by Chris Noth from Law and Order (Det. Mike Logan).Manhattan and all of New York City are just as much characters on the show as Carrie and her buds. The show is filmed on location all over NYC, and this really makes the show what it is. Living in real Manhattan apartments, the characters take walks in Central Park, along New York's city streets, by day, and by night, and spend afternoons and evenings at various restaurants and clubs around the city. All these great settings on the show make me want to visit New York, and see in person the unique greatness which shines on the screen. This show has a more realistic view of NYC than, say, the film You've Got Mail, and others. Sex shows NYC as lovely, fast-paced, gritty, and thrilling, all at the same time. I think the show gives you a tiny window into what it would be like to live in New York: the sounds, the people, the rhythm. Though of course, these gals do quite well with their work, and so have great apartments, and shop early and often for their $400.00 Manolo Blanhik or Jimmy Choo shoes, so 'realistic' is all relative! This show is just for *fun*. It's happy, and it's got just enough &quot;non&quot; thrown in with its fiction to make it a show which is truly exciting to watch, even for the third or fourth time. These gals feel like articulate and stylish friends that I get to visit now and again, and who consistently make me Laugh out Loud! Forget Therapy! Get enough  &quot;Sex!&quot;If you are going to buy the first season of Sex and the City, the DVD's the way to go, if possible. First of all, there's better picture quality, but the true greatness comes in not having to fast-forward to get to all your favorite episodes! Plus, the six episodes on each disc are laid out clearly on a menu, complete with short descriptions and previews, if its been a while since you've had your 'Sex,' and you want to get right to the best bits! That said, there's not much filler here, the half-hour episodes are pretty much packed with excellent, witty writing, and va va voom acting. Please note that this show does contain risque subject matter and scenes, and so is really appropriate for adults only.This is a must-see for all you women out there, and for the men, well, I think you'll love it just as much. It's impossible to watch only one episode per sitting. But I dare you to try! Good luck! :)",5,What a girl wants.....?

Kinda blows one's credibility, I'd say.  Still, while it seems that most reviewers either love or hate this series, there IS a kind of middle ground, at least as far as this first season goes.  It's all frothy fun: sharply written and very well acted, photographed and directed.  But SEX AND THE CITY's first year falls a few notches shy of greatness.  Maybe it's because, ultimately, the characters really are a little annoying in their shallowness--although like most people you get to know over time, you get to like them better after a while and forgive them their foibles, at least somewhat.  I think the real problem may be the show's brevity.  It probably doesn't clock in any shorter than any network sitcom, but it seems to be trying to say more, do more, be more.

This show is neither mature nor adult. This show is really just a glorified sitcom, with dirty talk and some very short (and not erotic) sex scenes. The 4 women are very superficial, and are not very realistic. Constantly eating out at posh restaurants in Manhattan (there are other burroughs in NYC, such as Queens and Brooklyn, where it is much cheaper to eat) every day, sleeping with a different man each week, buying as many things as they can, partying all hours of the night, and they still find time to work their professional jobs. These women are supposed to be ""professionals"", but if that were the case, they would never be able to keep up their lifestyles (even with doing Red Bulls and coke all day). I feel that these women are very unhappy, and they look for fullfilment through a hedonistic lifestyle. I hark back to the 1960's in the films L'avventura and La Dolce Vita, where this kind of lifestyle was depicted as cheap (spiritually speaking), hollow, shallow, and depressing (and it still is, regardless of what the media may tell you). Most of their affairs are quite meaningless, it's mostly sex without emotion, and the conversations remind me more of locker room talk written by sitcom writers. And the sex scenes (which many people told me they were so hot) are tepid at best. I have seen films by European art filmmakers (Bertolucci and Breillat, to name a few) that are light years more honest and artistic than anything this show can put out. Americans have very childish attitudes towards sex, almost childlike. They giggle at dirty talk, and try to show off their ""knowledge"" of sex, like when a 6th grader discovers the sex ed book, and brags about the new dirty words he/she has discovered.

I'd never seen these episodes, having started watching during season 3, and I was curious about the history between Carrie and Big, as well as having a thirst for a new fix of this great HBO original program.I was surprised that the very first show (pilot) was pretty weak, but that is the ONLY episode I wasn't crazy about. Getting to know Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha from the start is great fun. As the first season goes on, we really get to know the four distinct and seperate characters with their common problem, finding a normal man in the Big Apple.I really find this show very entertaining, and am very happy with my two ""Sex..."" sets. If you've never seen the show, or started late like I did, here's a chance to catch up on what you've missed. I'm sorry I didn't tape season three, but I'm wising up and taping all the shows now, new and repeat, when aired.For the single lady who is searching for her prince, or for the married lady like me who has been lucky enough to find hers, at some point you'll relate to this show, or at the very least, you'll be entertained.

Every word of the show is poisonously funny and oddly very melodramatic. Carrie pours her heart, and the hearts of her friends, into her column titled ""Sex and the City."" In it, she discusses the faulty and/or nonexistance of romance in modern society. The show is sort of sad in a way, reminding us all of the pain of being single.

With the passing of its British counterpart, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous,&quot; thank God that HBO  has come up with a show that is intelligent and hilarious. Carrie Bradshaw,  a &quot;sex anthropologist&quot; who writes a column about the modern  woman's dating woes, finally finds the right man in Mr. Big, although in  one second season episode she thinks the relationship is over because he  won't let her leave a hair dryer at his apartment. Carrie is the only  &quot;single and fabulous&quot; woman that has a stable relationship.  Although she sometimes strays, &quot;He was straight and a smoker.  Everything that I was looking for that night.&quot; Her nympho high society  friend Samantha has &quot;survived the dating scene in New York for the  past 30 years by becoming a hybrid. The body of a woman with the ego of a  man.&quot; Samantha at least has the decency to sleep with a man only once  before moving on, and on and on and on. Charlotte on the other hand, is a  naive good girl who seems to lure bad boys. Miranda is a successful lawyer  but is a paranoid woman, suffering from various neurosis. In one episode,  she has the fantasy that she will remain single forever and end of dying  eaten by her cat. Miranda prevents this by overfeeding her cat. These are  all very real and interesting women, whose problems you can watch and say,  &quot;Yeah that's exactly what happens!&quot; The show is pure pleasure to  behold, with Carrie and her whacked-out friends trying to survive the  single life in a New York filled with neverending chaos. I hope that they  keep struggling forever, because without Sex and the City, Sunday nights  wouldn't be as much fun!

44394,A24TCT2CY6KY68,0783117388,"Katherine Petersdorf ""Author, Film Producer &...","[1, 1]","For the Series as a whole: it is a fun and fast paced show, probably because each season has so few episodes. It is funny and if you love drama it always has the too. There is a girl who is like each major type of women so you always have someone to connect to.For the DVDs Set: The box is so easy to break. The box was slightly breaking at the seem when it was shipped to me, by the end of the first week the two halves of the box were apart and they can't be fixed because it is three pieces of plastic barley glued together. It is a very cheap box, I suggest you invest in a dvd book if you want them to be safe.About the episodes of Season 1Sex and the City Season 1 Review:""Sex and the City"": The Sex and the City Pilot ""Sex and the City"" is probably the best pilot I have ever seen. It is was interesting, had a great rhythm, I loved the way she interacted with the audience, and it followed the first three articles featured in the book so very well.The girls looks a little older in the pilot than the series, which is odd because it was pilot and is filmed long before episode two.I thought that this episode was Sarah Jessica-Parker's best hairstyle in the series. It fit her face perfectly.I wasn't a fan of Charlotte wearing glasses, and her hair in the pilot, they were trying too hard to make her look the same age as the other girls.""Models and Mortals"": First of all, I know that some people find beautiful women to be shallow but just because a girl is thin and beautiful doesn't mean she is stupid, illiterate, or lazy. Not all girls uses beauty to get what they want in life.Also the final statement by Mr. Big about women, so many people read into that as that you can't be beautiful and funny, but there are tones of funny girls who are beautiful.I was also offended by the TV art where he filmed all those women without permission. I also I work with models at lot in my profession and I have to say I have never worked with a model would slept around all the time, nor have I met more than 1 or 2 who were dumb.I think this episode unappreciated the work and dedication it takes to become a model. You have to work more than one job most of the time, waitress work is the most common, you have to take your free time to rush back and forth across town to meet with designers, most of whom will make you try on tons of clothing, critique everything about you, and then not hire you. It takes so much time, money, and dedication, if someone was really lazy and unintelligent they couldn't become a model.""Bay of Married Pigs"": The Bay of Married Pigs was a fairly good episode. I found some of the incidents in the episode beyond humorous.The idea of there being a cold war between Marries and Singles is a great plot for the episode. I feel that cold war in real life as well and I think it is an important issue to cover.Samantha's part of the episode seems untrue to her personality. I felt like it was poor writing on the staff for this episode.The format of the episode was okay, but I do wish that there would be more story lines that branch off for the other characters, but it was centered around Carrie and Miranda instead of all four, as it usually is.I felt weird about Miranda's part of the story, the way she treated her fix up wasn't right, she was nice enough to her, but she just used her in the end.""Valley of the Twenty-Something Men"": I enjoyed this episode a lot more than most of the episodes in Season 1. The idea of dating younger men is really hip among contemporary projects since the late 90's. I think it is because we are becoming more open about relationships and realizing that gender and age don't really matter when you lust for or love someone.I thought that the realization Carrie has about men being a drug was the best part of the episode. It was that moment in which the audience realized with her that it isn't about their age, their job, or even if they like you back, it is about the fact that all romantic relationships make you feel like you're floating on air and that feeling is addictive.Carrie seemed to be dating the younger man for validation in herself though, where as Miranda just wanted someone who wouldn't challenge her. I think the reasons behind the girl's choices in men where a little unreasonable and over the top, but it wouldn't be SATC if there wasn't something drama-queen like in the story line.""The Power of Female Sex"": This episode was actually a pretty good one, even though the ideal of the story is women using sex to get what they want out of life. It wasn't the topic that was fun, it was the reality in what happened that was fun.I enjoyed the fact that the beautiful French man thought of Carrie as a hooker the whole time and that Carrie thought she was falling in love with a romantic foreigner.The conversation between the girls that morning was over the top though, I felt like they were trying to hard to make a feminist statement with the discourse between Miranda and Samantha. Samantha's statement was something that a strong women who owned her own company would never make, and it seemed like they only had her say the line to insight a fight about women's rights. The show itself was a statement about how women can be strong and take care of themselves, they didn't need to add more atop of it.""Secret Sex"": When watching this episode I could feel the male influence that had just joined the series. The idea that there are women in the world that men have sex with and don't want others to know about is upsetting. The episode made it sound like every man in the world had one and that it was a normal thing.The way that Carrie reacted to the situation, just assuming that she was the secret set of Mr. Big was stupid. She freaked out about nothing and showed up drunk? I would have dumped her on the stop if I were him.All things considered I felt the episode was poorly written, and the relationships mentions in it where very stereotyped.""The Monogamists"": This episode didn't do it for me. I love Sex and the City, but this episode just was awful. It was another drama-queen episode instead of something fun and fresh. I don't know if it is just me, but Mr. Big and Carrie had so many episodes together when they were dating that were annoying and upsetting.The way Carrie reacted upset me the most, she knew he was dating other women and yet she got together when him again at the end of the episode? The way she let Mr. Big walk all over her all the time made me feel like she was weak not a good role model, she couldn't make a relationship work and yet she wrote advice on them?Charlotte's part of the episode was really great, though. I felt like a ton of women could relate to her relationship problem. She didn't want to do something and he wasn't okay with that, and I'm sure every women has something different that they don't wish to do that comes between them and a man who pretends to be perfect.The idea that there aren't men who want to be monogamous was just wrong though, I've met plenty of them, I also lived a small town in the mid west that was mostly Christian and that valued being married forever and frowned on divorce.""Three is a Crowd"": This was the first episode in which you really got all four of them's stories at the same time, which was the hallmark of the series and what made the audience love it so much.Carrie's part of the story was frustrating. She through such a fit about Mr. Big having been married in the past. I felt like going in meeting the wife under false pretenses was lame on her part, how Shallow was she? Okay, he was married and he didn't tell her before them, but really she didn't ask. How would she have reacted if he told her on the first date? And, he left his wife and she was still acting like he wasn't his wife and not her.Charlotte's part of the episode was great, it was one of Charlotte's best episodes. I felt like she wasn't a prude for a moment and it made me like her more. I may have never liked Charlotte if it wasn't for this episode. I had to say though, the guy who was dating her was just using her for sex and he wanted a three-way because he wanted to have someone else to sleep with before he left her.Miranda's part of the episode was downright funny. She has the same kind of reaction that I probably would have had when her friends didn't want to have sex with her. I don't think she wanted to sleep with them, she just wanted to feel beautiful. I think that her answering that ad and then leaving was little over the top though, she should know she is beautiful just the way she is.Sam's part of the episode was pretty laid back for Sam. She usually is so much more fun and interesting but her sleeping with a guy and then the wife wanting to be part of the relationship, that was a-typical.""The Turtle and the Hare"": This episode of SATC was a great episode, not because of the humor but because of how true to life it was. I think addressing the fact that most people don't marry for love was a bold call on the writer's part and very relate able.Sam's part was the most relate able, she thought that she could change a man into what she wanted in a relationship,and I watch women do that all the time and wonder why they keep failing. I think it was a learning experience for her viewers.Carrie's reaction to the situation was over the top again. The more I watch SATC the more I realize how much of a drama-queen she is. I think she enjoys ruining her relationships.""The Baby Shower"": This was a very funny episode, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I watch it.Carrie's part of the story was fun, I think all women feel that way when they miss a period. For the firs time in a while I didn't think Carrie was over reacting to something in her relationship with Mr. BigSam's part of the story made me wonder about the writers. When I think of Sam I feel like she has an ego and great self-esteem but this episode made it seem like she doesn't have any and that she sleep around to hide that.Charlotte's part of the story was sad, and very real. I felt like Lily was a horrid friend, doing what she did. I really wanted Charlotte not to give up because Lily stabbed her in the back to make herself look betterMiranda's part of the story was so placid, it felt like she really didn't have a story. That part about her Dog Pepper was terrifying.""The Drought"": This episode was so funny, everyone's part of the story just made me want to laugh and most of season 1 wasn't that funny, it was drama, drama, drama.Carrie's part of the episode was just over the top. She fart, she is human and she (as the Drama Queen she is) thought that Mr. Big was going to leave her over it. I though it was funny that she had to paint her house to not go to his house and jump him. She kept reading into everything.Miranda's part of the story was so funny, the guy outside the movie store and the gummy bears. I felt bad for her, but at the same time I wanted to know how funny she would act at 5 months.Charlotte's part of the story was also funny. She though that having a physical relationship wasn't important, until she couldn't have it. The ways she tried to change her situation were just so humorousSam's part of the story was cute. The idea that someone like Sam would be having sex was just out of place, and the idea that she thought she could do it was just so unrealistic to her character. Each moment had me really laughing hard.The couple outside of Carrie's window was insane, I keep wondering if that was filmed for this project or if it was a clip from an adult movie.""Oh Come All Ye Faithful"": I hated this episode. It was the worst one for all of season 1, which is saying a lot because this is one of my top 10 favorite TV showsCarrie's Part of the episode upset me beyond words. I spent a whole season dealing with all the drama that was Carrie and Mr. Big's relationship and then she dumped him for something so normal. Why would he have her meet his mom before he was ready to marry her or movie in with her?Miranda's part of the episode made me feel awkward, the way the guy acting during their love scenes made me blush and it is hard to make me blush. It was kind of creepy, I didn't get why she would date such an odd man who was way below her league.I think that at the end when the relationship between Carrie and Mr. Big ended I was actually happy. It really takes all 6 seasons to fall in love with Mr. Big if you don't like Macho Egocentric men with commitment issues. I felt like Carrie finally had a change to get a real guy and it made me want to keep watching the show.",5,One of My Top 10 Most Loved TV Shows,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,12598,"['Series', 'whole',

Hinton ""avid reader""","[8, 8]","Before the ladies of Sex and the City had a clothing budget that rivaled Oprah's net worth, they were just four thirty-somethings focused on navigating the trials and tribulations of dating in Manhattan. The first season is pretty much verbatim from the Candace Bushnell book of columns for which the show is named, and it bears very little resemblance to the show that eventually evolved. The pilot looks very much like it was filmed in the mid-90s and seems to have been filmed months, if not years, before the following episodes. SJP's hair is a dingy brown, Kristin Davis is sporting a flipped bob haircut, Cynthia Nixon has a cell phone so huge it reminds me of Zach Morris', and Kim Cattrall has the worst hair extensions I've seen since Britney Spears. Also, the first season has a ""man on the street"" section where, similar to the HBO show Real Sex, the camera focuses on typical New Yorkers and asks them how they feel about the topic of Carrie's topic for the week. Carrie herself talks to the camera frequently as well, which can be disconcerting if you've only seen the later episodes. There are all sorts of little hidden gems in this original season, like the knowledge that Samantha actually had her eyes set on Big way before Carrie got him, Charlotte's been obsessed with marriage from the very beginning, and Miranda wasn't always such a workaholic. Though it's not nearly as good as the seasons that followed, the first season of Sex and the City is definitely worth watching to see the humble beginnings of a show that changed the way women view themselves, their friendships, and their relationships.",4,The season that started it all,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,1621,"['ladies', 'Sex', 'City', 'had', 'clothing', 'budget', 'rivaled', 'Oprah', 'net', 'worth', 'were', 'just', 'four', 'thirty-somethings', 'focused', 'navigating', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'dating', 'Manhattan', 'first', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'verbatim', 'Candace', 'Bushnell', 'book', 'columns', 'show', 'named', 'very', 'little', 'resemblance', 'show', 'eventually', 'evolved', 'pilot', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'filmed', 'mid-90s', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'months', 'not', 'years', 'following', 'episodes', 'SJP', 'hair', 'dingy', 'brown', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'sporting', 'flipped', 'bob', 'haircut', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'cell', 'phone', 'so', 'huge', 'Zach', 'Morris', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'worst', 'hair', 'extensions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Also', 'first', 'season', 'man', 'street', 'section', 'where', 'similar', 'HBO', 'show', 'Real', 'Sex', 'camera', 'typical', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'asks', 'how', 'feel', 'topic', 'Carrie', 'topic', 'week', 'Carrie', 'talks', 'camera', 'frequently', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'disconcerting', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'later', 'episodes', 'are', 'sorts', 'little', 'hidden', 'gems', 'original', 'season', 'knowledge', 'Samantha', 'actually', 'had', 'eyes', 'set', 'Big', 'way', 'Carrie', 'got', 'Charlotte', 'been', 'obsessed', 'marriage', 'very', 'beginning', 'Miranda', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'such', 'workaholic', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'seasons', 'followed', 'first', 'season', 'Sex', 'City', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'show', 'changed', 'way', 'women', 'view', 'friendships', 'relationships']",N/A

44400,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0783117388,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 11]","Now that the ""Six and the City"" girls are living happily ever after and we know how their stories end, going back and revisiting the complete first season reminds us of their respective starting points.  In the beginning, at a thirty-something birthday party for Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), the birthday girl, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) decide that they are going to start having sex like men (i.e., without feeling), an idea that Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) rejects.  By the end of that first episode it becomes clear that each of the quartet has their respective roles, which establishes a series of key oppositional pairs.Miranda is the pessimist, while Charlotte is the eternal optimist.  Charlotte is interested in falling in love and having it all, while Samantha is only interested in really great sex.  The impulsive Samantha is interested in trying just about anything as soon as it pops into her mind, while the analytical Carrie has to think things through (and turn them into a newspaper column) before she can determine the proper course of action.  Carrie is willing to try and make things happen, while Miranda is just watching life pass her by.  There are more oppositional pairs to work out, but you get the idea how ""Sex in the City"" is always positioned to look at everything from at least two sides.  In fact, it does not seem right if we do not discover that what is happening to each of the four characters in a particular episode does not touch upon a common theme.  For example, in ""The Drought,"" if Carrie's relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) is entering a less physical stage then it will turn out that the man Charlotte is dating is not interested in having sex, that Samantha discovers not having sex is erotic, and Miranda has not been having sex for months.The recurring element for ""Sex and the City: The Complete First Season"" is the process of elimination by which Carrie and her friends come to terms with what they want in a man.  Specific episodes help them decide that they do not want a ""modelizer"" or a ""twenty-something"" guy.  Even in the early stages of her relationship with Mr. Big, Carrie focuses more on what she does not want (e.g., not to be a ""secret lover"" and not to be told that he is not interested in every getting married again) than on what she does.  I want to reconceptualize the entire six season run of the show as one of those logic games where you are told things like the person who drinks coffee lives next to the blue house and you have to figure out which person lives in the green house and which person eats pancakes.The other interesting thing is that at the start the other three women are all more Carrie's friends than they are each other's.  Charlotte might invite Samantha over to spend the night, but their views on the world are not exactly compatible.  The constant thread from the first episode to the last is obviously Carrie's tortured relationship with Big, but while we are watching those fight the inevitability of their feelings for one another, Carrie's friends start to strengthen the ties that bind them to each other.  Still, notice how often Carrie serves as a buffer between them and how long it takes for some of these dyads to reach the point where they can exist on their own.The only serious flaw with these first season episodes was when Carrie had to deal with faux issues such as a fake marriage to Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson) or a pregnancy scare, but simply because those are rather standard plotlines for shows about single women.  Fortunately, even when the series takes a misstep and covers old ground in does so in a fresh way, mainly because Carrie and her friends are willing to talk about everything from fetishes to the Rabbit.  It is that boldness and audacity that made ""Sex and the City"" stand out right from the beginning.That is why the idea that HBO would forget about showing theatrical films and just devote itself to producing television shows and movies has so much appeal to me.  I already watch more shows on HBO than any other network and when I list the top 10 shows on television they always have at least half of them.  Now, if only their DVD sets for these series would stop being the most expensive ones on the market.",5,"Carrie Bradshaw begins exploring ""Sex and the City""",1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,4302,"['Now', 'Six', 'City', 'girls', 'are', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'know', 'how', 'stories', 'end', 'going', 'back', 'revisiting', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'respective', 'starting', 'points', 'beginning', 'thirty-something', 'birthday', 'party', 'Miranda', 'Hobbs', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'birthday', 'girl', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'decide', 'are', 'going', 'start', 'having', 'sex', 'men', 'i.e.', 'feeling', 'idea', 'Charlotte', 'York', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'rejects', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'clear', 'quartet', 'respective', 'roles', 'series', 'key', 'oppositional', 'pairs.Miranda', 'pessimist', 'Charlotte', 'eternal', 'optimist', 'Charlotte', 'interested', 'falling', 'love', 'having', 'Samantha', 'only', 'interested', 'really', 'great', 'sex', 'impulsive', 'Samantha', 'interested', 'trying', 'just', 'about', 'anything', 'as', 'soon', 'mind', 'analytical', 'Carrie', 'think', 'things', 'turn', 'newspaper', 'column', 'can', 'determine', 'proper', 'course', 'action', 'Carrie', 'willing', 'try', 'make', 'things', 'happen', 'Miranda', 'just', 'watching', 'life', 'pass', 'are', 'more', 'oppositional', 'pairs', 'work', 'out', 'get', 'idea', 'how', 'Sex', 'City', 'always', 'positioned', 'look', 'everything', 'least', 'two', 'sides', 'fact', 'not', 'seem', 'right', 'do', 'not', 'discover', 'what', 'happening', 'four', 'characters', 'particular', 'episode', 'not', 'touch', 'common', 'theme', 'example', 'Drought', 'Carrie', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'entering', 'less', 'physical', 'stage', 'then', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'man', 'Charlotte', 'dating', 'not', 'interested', 'having', 'sex', 'Samantha', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'erotic', 'Miranda', 'not', 'been', 'having', 'sex', 'months.The', 'recurring', 'element', 'Sex', 'City', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'process', 'elimination', 'Carrie', 'friends', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'want', 'man', 'Specific', 'help', 'decide', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'modelizer', 'twenty-something', 'guy', 'Even', 'early', 'stages', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Carrie', 'more', 'what', 'not', 'want', 'e.g.', 'not', 'be', 'secret', 'lover', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'not', 'interested', 'getting', 'married', 'again', 'what', 'want', 'reconceptualize', 'entire', 'six', 'season', 'run', 'show', 'one', 'logic', 'games', 'where', 'are', 'told', 'things', 'person', 'who', 'coffee', 'lives', 'blue', 'house', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'person', 'green', 'house', 'person', 'eats', 'pancakes.The', 'other', 'interesting', 'thing', 'start', 'other', 'three', 'women', 'are', 'more', 'Carrie', 'friends', 'are', 'other', 'Charlotte', 'might', 'invite', 'Samantha', 'spend', 'night', 'views', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'compatible', 'constant', 'thread', 'first', 'episode', 'last', 'obviously', 'Carrie', 'tortured', 'relationship', 'Big', 'are', 'watching', 'fight', 'inevitability', 'feelings', 'one', 'Carrie', 'friends', 'start', 'strengthen', 'ties', 'bind', 'other', 'Still', 'notice', 'how', 'often', 'Carrie', 'buffer', 'how', 'long', 'dyads', 'reach', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'exist', 'own.The', 'only', 'serious', 'flaw', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'was', 'when', 'Carrie', 'had', 'deal', 'faux', 'issues', 'such', 'fake', 'marriage', 'Stanford', 'Blatch', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'pregnancy', 'scare', 'simply', 'are', 'rather', 'standard', 'plotlines', 'shows', 'single', 'women', 'Fortunately', 'even', 'when', 'series', 'misstep', 'covers', 'old', 'ground', 'so', 'fresh', 'way', 'mainly', 'Carrie', 'friends', 'are', 'willing', 'talk', 'everything', 'fetishes', 'Rabbit', 'boldness', 'audacity', 'made', 'Sex', 'City', 'stand', 'out', 'right', 'beginning.That', 'why', 'idea', 'HBO', 'would', 'forget', 'showing', 'theatrical', 'films', 'just', 'devote', 'producing', 'television', 'shows', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'appeal', 'already', 'watch', 'more', 'shows', 'HBO', 'other', 'network', 'when', 'list', 'top', '10', 'shows', 'television', 'always', 'have', 'least', 'half', 'Now', 'only', 'DVD', 'sets', 'series', 'would', 'stop', 'being', 'most', 'expensive', 'ones', 'market']",N/A

They have different personalities, but are fast friends. Samantha is a sex kitten who loves her single, swinging life. Charlotte is sweet and idealistic. Miranda is tough talking and confident. Carrie Bradshaw is a mix of all of them, probably closest in beliefs to those who watch the show. All the women are beautiful in their own way, but it is Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie who is the most vulnerable, natural, and thus the most beautiful. Carrie Bradshaw writes a weekly newspaper column called ""Sex in the City,"" where she explores dating dilemmas and philosophizes about them.The actresses aren't the only stars of the show. We have all heard about the shoes, the clothes, that fans of the show have demanded and purchased in high numbers. And not only the clothes, but even more so the City herself. The show is filmed all over New York - in the parks, at night on the streets, in innumerable restaurants with amazing ambience, in apartments, and clubs. Searching for meaning in the concrete jungle is a daunting task, and we are happy to share their experiences.The show IS very risque, with lots of nudity, sex, bad language, graphic dialouge. Yet the show has a moral heart - everything the friends do has consequences they must suffer. And in the end, doing what is right almost always prevails over what feels right.Season 1 contains two discs with six episodes each. Disc One has more belly laughs than the second, but they are both good. We are introduced to the four friends and their different attitudes. Carrie meets Mr. Big, who plays a large part on the show. These episodes were first aired on HBO June -August of 1998. The prominent shots of the Twin Towers in this pre-9/11 time are poignant.Disc One:Episode 1: Sex and the City - The four friends are introduced.Episode 2: Models and Mortals - Carrie encounters a man who is obsessed with dating only models.Episode 3: Bay of Married Pigs - Carrie loses her friendship with a married couple (and the use of their house in the Hamptons) when the husband exposes himself to her. Even though it is not Carrie's fault, the wife treats her like a homewrecker.Episode 4: Valley of the Twenty-Something Guys - Has one of the biggest laughs of the whole first season. I was roaring with laughter, and had my husband come and watch that part. Carrie explores the idea of thirty-something women dating twenty-something guys in order for the women to boost their own self-esteem.Episode 5: The Power of Female Sex - On a whim, Miranda dates a puppyish boy named Skipper. Skipper becomes obsessed with Miranda.Episode 6: Secret Sex - Carrie explores the fact that some people have ""secret sex"" - sex with someone they like and with whom the sex is great. Yet, they are ashamed to introduce this person to their friends.Disc Two:Episode 7: The Monogamists - Carrie asks the question, is monogamy obsolete?Episode 8: Three's a Crowd - Charlotte is pressured by her boyfriend to engage in a threesome.Episode 9: The Turtle and the Hare - Samantha tries to make over a financially successful, but horrendously nerdy man.Episode 10: The Baby Shower - The four women attend a baby shower for one of their former wild friends. ""The Cult of Motherhood"" is a very funny idea that I wonder if it is true.Episode 11: The Drought - Miranda is suffering from a sex drought; Samantha tries yogic celibacy; Charlotte gets addicted to a new vibrator called The Rabbit.Episode 12: O Come All Ye Faithful - Carrie tells Mr. Big she loves him, with disastrous results - got to wait for second season to see what happens! This episode tries to explore religion, but fails to draw as meaningful a conclusion as the rest of the episodes.",5,Absolutely Perfect,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,3800,"['Sex', 'City', 'four', 'single', 'professional', 'women', 'late', 'twenties', 'early', 'forties', 'who', 'live', 'Manhattan', 'have', 'different', 'personalities', 'are', 'fast', 'friends', 'Samantha', 'sex', 'kitten', 'who', 'single', 'swinging', 'life', 'Charlotte', 'sweet', 'idealistic', 'Miranda', 'tough', 'talking', 'confident', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'mix', 'probably', 'closest', 'beliefs', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'women', 'are', 'beautiful', 'own', 'way', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Carrie', 'who', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'natural', 'thus', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'weekly', 'newspaper', 'column', 'called', 'Sex', 'City', 'where', 'dating', 'dilemmas', 'them.The', 'actresses', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'stars', 'show', 'have', 'heard', 'shoes', 'clothes', 'fans', 'show', 'have', 'demanded', 'purchased', 'high', 'numbers', 'not', 'only', 'clothes', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'City', 'show', 'filmed', 'New', 'York', 'parks', 'night', 'streets', 'innumerable', 'restaurants', 'amazing', 'ambience', 'apartments', 'clubs', 'Searching', 'meaning', 'concrete', 'jungle', 'daunting', 'task', 'are', 'happy', 'share', 'experiences.The', 'show', 'very', 'risque', 'lots', 'nudity', 'sex', 'bad', 'language', 'graphic', 'dialouge', 'show', 'moral', 'heart', 'everything', 'friends', 'do', 'consequences', 'must', 'suffer', 'end', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'almost', 'always', 'over', 'what', 'right.Season', '1', 'contains', 'two', 'discs', 'six', 'episodes', 'Disc', 'One', 'more', 'belly', 'laughs', 'second', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'introduced', 'four', 'friends', 'different', 'attitudes', 'Carrie', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'who', 'large', 'part', 'show', 'episodes', 'were', 'first', 'aired', 'HBO', 'June', '-August', '1998', 'prominent', 'shots', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'pre-9/11', 'time', 'are', 'poignant.Disc', 'One', 'Episode', '1', 'Sex', 'City', 'four', 'friends', 'are', 'introduced.Episode', '2', 'Models', 'Mortals', 'Carrie', 'man', 'who', 'obsessed', 'dating', 'only', 'models.Episode', '3', 'Bay', 'Married', 'Pigs', 'Carrie', 'friendship', 'married', 'couple', 'use', 'house', 'Hamptons', 'when', 'husband', 'Even', 'not', 'Carrie', 'fault', 'wife', 'homewrecker.Episode', '4', 'Valley', 'Twenty-Something', 'Guys', 'one', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'had', 'husband', 'come', 'watch', 'part', 'Carrie', 'idea', 'thirty-something', 'women', 'dating', 'twenty-something', 'guys', 'order', 'women', 'boost', 'own', 'self-esteem.Episode', '5', 'Power', 'Female', 'Sex', 'whim', 'Miranda', 'puppyish', 'boy', 'named', 'Skipper', 'Skipper', 'obsessed', 'Miranda.Episode', '6', 'Secret', 'Sex', 'Carrie', 'fact', 'people', 'have', 'secret', 'sex', 'sex', 'someone', 'like', 'whom', 'sex', 'great', 'are', 'ashamed', 'introduce', 'person', 'friends.Disc', 'Two', 'Episode', '7', 'Monogamists', 'Carrie', 'question', 'monogamy', 'obsolete', 'Episode', '8', 'Three', 'Crowd', 'Charlotte', 'pressured', 'boyfriend', 'engage', 'threesome.Episode', '9', 'Turtle', 'Hare', 'Samantha', 'make', 'over', 'financially', 'successful', 'horrendously', 'nerdy', 'man.Episode', '10', 'Baby', 'Shower', 'four', 'women', 'attend', 'baby', 'shower', 'one', 'former', 'wild', 'friends', 'Cult', 'Motherhood', 'very', 'funny', 'idea', 'wonder', 'true.Episode', '11', 'Drought', 'Miranda', 'suffering', 'sex', 'drought', 'Samantha', 'yogic', 'celibacy', 'Charlotte', 'addicted', 'new', 'vibrator', 'called', 'Rabbit.Episode', '12', 'O', 'Come', 'All', 'Ye', 'Faithful', 'Carrie', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'disastrous', 'results', 'got', 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'see', 'what', 'episode', 'explore', 'religion', 'draw', 'meaningful', 'conclusion', 'rest', 'episodes']",N/A
44407,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,0783117388,Luis Hernandez,"[29, 34]","From the creative mind of producer Darren Star (television's &quot;Melrose Place&quot;)comes this excellent, witty, and energetic series of four girlfriends living in New York City and exploring the topic that was once exclusively for men when it came to conversation, &quot;sex.&quot;  Based on the bestselling book by Candace Bushnell, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; revolves around the lives of four young, urban professional in search of the perfect relationship and orgasm.Sarah Jessica Parker (&quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; ; &quot;LA Story&quot;) plays Carrie Bradshaw, a weekly columnist for a local paper, who writes a column regarding sex and relationships in the big city. Kim Catrall (&quot;Masquerade&quot;; &quot;Mannequin&quot;) is Samantha,  a big time publicist. Cynthia Nixon (&quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot;-1999 version) plays Miranda, a lawyer and Kristin Davis Plays Charlotte, an art gallery curator who is a bit prudish when it comes to sex.When these four Manhattanites get together, they do cause a commotion in whatever they do, and on this two-disc set, HBO Video treats viewers with the first twelve episodes of the popular new series where anything (and mostly everything) goes.The episodes which explore such topics as monogamy, threesomes, baby showers, and other topics that normal to the everyday denizen of a large metropolitan mecca such as New York contain the most wittiest scripts and scenarios that I have ever seen on television. Due to the lack of network censors, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; popularity thrives on its' ability to use profanity, sex, nudity, and other adult themes that are taboo on broadcast stations.The show also contains other delightful character that win will you over as a new fan. Chris Noth (television's &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;) is always excellent in whatever role he takes, and as Carrie's love interest , &quot;Mr. Big&quot;, he will swoon you with his charm and elegance. And what would the average heterosexual girl living in the big city be without her gay best friend? In Carrie's case, her best gay friend, Stanford, is her very own Rupert Everett. His tales of dating in the gay scene, in addition to his flamboyance will cause you to both have pity and amusement for this funny sidekick.While this show will mainly appeal to urban women and gay men, it should be viewed and enjoyed by all. With all the recent network rip-offs airing on television already (e.g. UPN's &quot;Girlfriends&quot;), I can guarantee it would be worth your time and money to purchase this series and enjoy what can be called the most original television comedy in recent years at home.The DVD edition contains a great motion main menu powered by a flavorful salsa beat, and some of the special features on the set include DVD-Rom web links to related sites, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the series, episode previews, language selection (English and Spanish tracks), and subtitles (English and French subtitles).I am anxiously awaiting the second season to be released on DVD. I have e-mailed HBO Video, but they haven't replied to my e-mail yet, but if anyone from the company is reading this, please be aware that fans are hungrily awaiting for more seasons to be released on this great format!",5,Sex and the City Rules!,970185600,"09 29, 2000",2000,3266,"['creative', 'mind', 'producer', 'Darren', 'Star', 'television', 'quot', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'quot', 'excellent', 'witty', 'energetic', 'series', 'four', 'girlfriends', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'exploring', 'topic', 'was', 'once', 'exclusively', 'men', 'when', 'came', 'conversation', 'quot', 'quot', 'Based', 'bestselling', 'book', 'Candace', 'Bushnell', 'quot', 'Sex', 'City', 'quot', 'lives', 'four', 'young', 'urban', 'professional', 'search', 'perfect', 'relationship', 'orgasm.Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'quot', 'Honeymoon', 'Vegas', 'quot', 'quot', 'LA', 'Story', 'quot', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'weekly', 'columnist', 'local', 'paper', 'who', 'column', 'regarding', 'sex', 'relationships', 'big', 'city', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'quot', 'Masquerade', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mannequin', 'quot', 'Samantha', 'big', 'time', 'publicist', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'quot', 'Out-of-Towners', 'quot', '-1999', 'version', 'Miranda', 'lawyer', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'Plays', 'Charlotte', 'art', 'gallery', 'curator', 'who', 'bit', 'prudish', 'when', 'sex.When', 'four', 'Manhattanites', 'get', 'together', 'do', 'cause', 'commotion', 'do', 'two-disc', 'set', 'HBO', 'Video', 'viewers', 'first', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'popular', 'new', 'series', 'where', 'anything', 'mostly', 'everything', 'goes.The', 'episodes', 'explore', 'such', 'topics', 'monogamy', 'threesomes', 'baby', 'showers', 'other', 'topics', 'normal', 'everyday', 'denizen', 'large', 'metropolitan', 'mecca', 'such', 'New', 'York', 'contain', 'most', 'wittiest', 'scripts', 'scenarios', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'Due', 'lack', 'network', 'censors', 'quot', 'Sex', 'City', 'quot', 'popularity', 'ability', 'use', 'profanity', 'sex', 'nudity', 'other', 'adult', 'themes', 'are', 'taboo', 'broadcast', 'stations.The', 'show', 'also', 'other', 'delightful', 'character', 'win', 'will', 'over', 'new', 'fan', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'television', 'quot', 'Law', 'amp', 'Order', 'quot', 'always', 'excellent', 'role', 'Carrie', 'love', 'interest', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'quot', 'will', 'swoon', 'charm', 'elegance', 'would', 'average', 'heterosexual', 'girl', 'living', 'big', 'city', 'be', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'Carrie', 'case', 'best', 'gay', 'friend', 'Stanford', 'very', 'own', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'tales', 'dating', 'gay', 'scene', 'addition', 'flamboyance', 'will', 'cause', 'have', 'pity', 'amusement', 'funny', 'sidekick.While', 'show', 'will', 'mainly', 'appeal', 'urban', 'women', 'gay', 'men', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'enjoyed', 'recent', 'network', 'rip-offs', 'airing', 'television', 'already', 'e.g', 'UPN', 'quot', 'Girlfriends', 'quot', 'can', 'guarantee', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'money', 'purchase', 'series', 'enjoy', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'most', 'original', 'television', 'comedy', 'recent', 'years', 'home.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'great', 'motion', 'main', 'menu', 'powered', 'flavorful', 'salsa', 'beat', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'include', 'DVD-Rom', 'web', 'links', 'related', 'sites', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'making', 'series', 'episode', 'previews', 'language', 'selection', 'English', 'Spanish', 'tracks', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'subtitles', '.I', 'am', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'second', 'season', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'have', 'e-mailed', 'HBO', 'Video', 'have', ""n't"", 'replied', 'e-mail', 'yet', 'anyone', 'company', 'reading', 'please', 'be', 'aware', 'fans', 'are', 'hungrily', 'awaiting', 'more', 'seasons', 'be', 'released', 'great', 'format']",N/A

Based on all the criticism that I'd heard about the series, I expected that these women would little more than trendchasers who sleep with every man they meet. While there is a fair amount of casual sex and high fashion in each episode, the show does have more depth than that. This is the story of four women supporting each other through life's pitfalls. Because this is television, the writers had to make it interesting or no one would watch, so there are many unrealistic situations. And while I am sure that some people really do live like this, I'd be willing to bet that they're not happy about it.This is adult entertainment, and yes most grown people have sex. We mght not all be having kinky sex and certainly not as much as these girls, but some people are such prudes that anything even remotely sexual is going to ruffle their feathers.These characters are consumed with getting older and trying to find relationships. Even the promiscous Samantha really does want to settle down with one man, but since she's been burned a few times she's pretending that empty sex is enough for her when the truth is that she resorts to that because that's all she can get.These women are not supposed to be role models and their behavior surely isn't anything that a normal person would want to imitate. I actually feel sorry for them in most episodes because they are truly miserable. Carrie loves a man who won't commit to her. Charlotte believes in fairy tales and happily-ever after. Miranda is jaded and harsh. And Samantha is oversexed and shallow.Nonetheless, I enjoy the show because it's funny and well-written. I too am single and in my 30's in an urban area, so I can appreciate a lot of what these women are going through. But  I'm not about to start sleeping around and maxing out my credit card on couture shoes just because I see some fictional characters doing it on television.

It's about these women who sit around and complain about dating and love and sex. The thing is, they constantly shadow their experiences onto all of Manhattan, as if what happens to them (or what they want) is pretentiously representative of the whole borough.Then, the lead character constantly addresses the camera directly, without any other conversational or narrative premise. It's even worse than &quot;Malcom in the Middle&quot;.It's also aimed squarely at women, and it totally misses me. But my wife didn't really find it intersting, either. &quot;I don't know if would be worth the wait a week for the next episode of this show.&quot;On top of it, I'm left with the feeling that the column that Carrie is supposed to be writing is not very insightful. Presumably, she's writing about her circle of friends and their expeirences--that's premise to making Carrie's point of view interesting, isn't it? But her friends never read the column, I guess.

Geyer ""outcast_searcher""","[1, 1]","As a straight single male who confesses to being baffled by most women's personalities, I found this first series was full of intrigue and some surprises.It would seem that single women, as well as men, lead lives of (sometimes) quiet desparation. Here you have 4 women, 3 of which constantly claim to be looking hard for ""Mr. Right"" for the fulfillment of marriage. The 4th's closet tendencies in this direction come to light as well.So, what are some of the earth shaking problems several of the oft-cited otherwise PERFECT men have (which make them unacceptable husband material)? One twenty-something just isn't quite smooth and sophisticated enough - somewhat puppy-like socially. Another (how shocking) would like to have his partner engage in oral sex with him. A third commits the unpardonable sin of being ""too small"" - and sadly the solution his very experienced partner comes up with is crying instead of talking to him about it. And finally, the dreaded failure to commit to lifelong plans soon enough, despite being completely candid about where he stands and some of the negative life-experiences he's had to explain his position.Sorry girls, but if this is even a vague hint of the truth, it's little wonder it's so hard to find ""true love"" these days. There are no ""perfect"" men (or women) of course.There are certainly epiphanies one can understand and relate to. The classic stereotype of the 30-something woman waking up after a sleepover sex-date in the CLASSIC 20-something bachelor's apartment, and morning drivel-macho-rant he spouts was a riot, and right-on for far too many of my former friends in bygone years, for example. The too-sad pregneant suburbia mom-to-be that we learn how much she HATES her post-single-wild life, despite all her bluster to the contrary to her new-mom peers the day before sounded like it had a ring of truth.Looking forward to the second season DVD release (I never watch HBO).

Fall in love with Mr. Big (Chris Noth - of Law & Order fame), naturally.This series is one of my all time television favorites.  It deals with the oft' taboo subject of sex with frank humor and down right crude legitimacy.  The characters are well drawn and the plot lines are engaging.Why then has HBO done such a lousy job in mastering the series for DVD?!?  There is so much digital grit that the image quality on these discs is akin to watching a regular television signal through the worst blizzard of the century.  Colors are muddy and weak.  Contrast levels are horribly low. There are all sorts of aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement problems.  BOTTOM LINE: this is one of the worst examples of DVD mastering ever!If you absolutely can't live without the series I suppose you'll have to buy it like this. But if I were you, I'd much prefer having my guilty little pleasures preserved in memory's eye from watching the series, as presented in considerably better quality, on HBO television.*Aside: I usually don't comment on presentation but the packaging of the discs is equally pathetic.

The world SATC depicts is very much the pre-9/11 America of the Clinton era - buoyant, culturally liberal, overconfident and slightly intoxicated with its own economic success. The cumulative impact of 9/11, the Iraq War and a great financial crash have taken their toll and the series now seems emblematic of a quite different, altogether less vulnerable era.

44446,AV5G37VFE5NVD,0783117388,Tom Benton,"[5, 5]","In 1998, just as the so-called ""king"" of all sitcoms was ending, Darren Star (creator of ""Melrose Place"" and ""Beverly Hills, 90210"") created his own - ""Sex and the City,"" very loosely based upon the book by reknowned columnist and socialite Candance Bushnell.  The series revolved around the misadventures of Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) and her group of self-obsessed girlfriends: successful lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), whose seemingly constant single status has led many to believe she's homosexual; naive Charlotte (Kristin Davis), whose life revolves around marriage; and Samantha (Kim Cattrall), who may have slept with every man in New York - on numerous occasions.  Together, these young, beautiful, and talented women struggle through the late-90s (and eventually early millennium) dating scene, wondering why they're single, what makes men tick, and just looking for love in the Big Apple.The first season, which aired in 1998, includes 12 delightful episodes.  Within the first few enough personality types have been mentioned (such as ""Modelizers,"" those who are addicted to sleeping with models) and enough ridiculous events have occurred to make the series potentially as memorable and quotable as ""Seinfeld.""  The largest story of the first season revolves around Carrie's uncertain relationship with the mysterious Mr. Big (""Law & Order""'s Chris Noth).  Carrie knows she loves him, deeply and truly, but does he love her?""Sex and the City"" is one of those series that makes you thank your lucky stars for HBO.  The freedom that comes with running a show on HBO is incredible.  There is uncensored and restrainless nudity and foul language (which may put off the more timid viewer), an essential part of the show.  I imagine that without this, the show wouldn't have been anywhere near as popular or even as good, and on any normal station would probably have flopped.  (To see what I mean, watch the HBO version of one episode, and then watch that same episode during the edited TBS re-runs.)Not that the show's all about getting naked and cursing.  There's much more here, particularly a stellar cast.  Parker is a heroine for the 90s, and the other girls are normal enough for us to sympathize, but also more than funny enough to keep us entertained.  Noth is unquestionably the male highlight, a tall, dark, and devilishly handsome man whose mysterious nature just adds to his charm.  The cast is supported by writing that's thoughtful, witty, and creative.  Unlike Meredith Grey's episodic musings on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" Carrie Bradshaw's are truly meaningful, and I'm sure legions of women can identify with the problems faced by Carrie and her gang.All in all, the first season of ""Sex and the City,"" though short (each episode runs a mere 23 minutes on average), is a blast.  The characters are down-to-earth and very human, the cast is brilliant, and if the show's attitude toward men is a little chauvinistic, the exemplary writing more than makes up for it.  It's romantic, it's fun, it's clever - ""Sex and the City"" is an irresistible piece of TV candy that I would highly recommend to anyone looking to try a new flavor.NOTE: If you are at all familiar with the show, or even have a hunch that you'll like it, I'd recommend you shell out the money to purchase thecomplete series set, a gorgeous package and a MAJOR improvement over the pitiful single-season releases.",5,"Romantic, witty, and irresistible TV candy",1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,3416,"['1998', 'just', 'so-called', 'king', 'sitcoms', 'was', 'ending', 'Darren', 'Star', 'creator', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'created', 'own', 'Sex', 'City', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'reknowned', 'columnist', 'socialite', 'Candance', 'Bushnell', 'series', 'revolved', 'misadventures', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'group', 'self-obsessed', 'girlfriends', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'Miranda', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'seemingly', 'constant', 'single', 'status', 'led', 'many', 'believe', 'homosexual', 'naive', 'Charlotte', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'life', 'around', 'marriage', 'Samantha', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'slept', 'man', 'New', 'York', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'Together', 'young', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'women', 'struggle', 'late-90s', 'eventually', 'early', 'millennium', 'dating', 'scene', 'wondering', 'why', ""'re"", 'single', 'what', 'men', 'tick', 'just', 'looking', 'love', 'Big', 'Apple.The', 'first', 'season', 'aired', '1998', '12', 'delightful', 'episodes', 'first', 'few', 'enough', 'personality', 'types', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'such', 'Modelizers', 'who', 'are', 'addicted', 'sleeping', 'models', 'enough', 'ridiculous', 'events', 'have', 'occurred', 'make', 'series', 'potentially', 'memorable', 'quotable', 'Seinfeld', 'largest', 'story', 'first', 'season', 'revolves', 'Carrie', 'uncertain', 'relationship', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Law', 'Order', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Carrie', 'deeply', 'truly', 'love', 'Sex', 'City', 'one', 'series', 'thank', 'lucky', 'stars', 'HBO', 'freedom', 'running', 'show', 'HBO', 'incredible', 'uncensored', 'restrainless', 'nudity', 'foul', 'language', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'more', 'timid', 'viewer', 'essential', 'part', 'show', 'imagine', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'anywhere', 'popular', 'even', 'good', 'normal', 'station', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'flopped', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'watch', 'HBO', 'version', 'one', 'episode', 'then', 'watch', 'same', 'episode', 'edited', 'TBS', 're-runs', 'Not', 'show', 'getting', 'naked', 'cursing', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'particularly', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Parker', 'heroine', '90s', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'normal', 'enough', 'sympathize', 'also', 'more', 'funny', 'enough', 'keep', 'entertained', 'Noth', 'unquestionably', 'male', 'highlight', 'tall', 'dark', 'devilishly', 'handsome', 'man', 'mysterious', 'nature', 'just', 'charm', 'cast', 'supported', 'writing', 'thoughtful', 'witty', 'creative', 'Meredith', 'Grey', 'episodic', 'musings', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'are', 'truly', 'meaningful', ""'m"", 'sure', 'legions', 'women', 'can', 'identify', 'problems', 'faced', 'Carrie', 'gang.All', 'first', 'season', 'Sex', 'City', 'short', 'episode', 'mere', '23', 'minutes', 'average', 'blast', 'characters', 'are', 'down-to-earth', 'very', 'human', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'show', 'attitude', 'men', 'little', 'chauvinistic', 'exemplary', 'writing', 'more', 'up', 'romantic', 'fun', 'clever', 'Sex', 'City', 'irresistible', 'piece', 'TV', 'candy', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'try', 'new', 'flavor.NOTE', 'are', 'familiar', 'show', 'even', 'have', 'hunch', ""'ll"", 'like', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'shell', 'out', 'money', 'purchase', 'thecomplete', 'series', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'package', 'MAJOR', 'improvement', 'pitiful', 'single-season', 'releases']",N/A

I really don't know any high class, high paid women like Sam who hop in and out of the sack and are happy about it.  If she were 22 then I'd understand but come on it's just downright sickening.  She obviously has issues.  They all have issues.  They live in the center of the universe and all of them have trouble finding a man.  These women are going to wind up single and alone forever.  Yes, even Charlotte who's married and divorced she'll be alone also.  There are no perfect men out there.If you're waiting for perfection you'll have a long wait.  I'm deeply disturbed by the way that sex is treated so casually especially by the Samantha character.  Her behavior is downright Conditesque!!  It's borderline psychotic!!  Men if you meet a woman who's happy to hop from bed, to bed, to bed run like the wind.  Does the film &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; ring any bells?The only real women in the world who act like these women are women with severe emotional issues.  They all need to be in counseling.

It revolves around the 30 year old Carrie and her group of friends with their relationship and sex issues. Seeing these women have real life problems we have all been through before is rather comforting. Not to mention, the dialogue is snappy and laugh bursting.
