883226,A47OISX4AV8I,B0007N1AM2,AngelosOne,"[26, 30]","This show was one of the best shows that once again, was never given a chance.  I watched most of its run on ABC, which was hard, since it was aired unevenly, and I often didn't know whether it was supposed to be on or not.I was quite sad to find that it had been cancelled. My mom was sad as well, since I had gotten her hooked on it too :)Anyway, I loved the show's most thought provoking quote ""God is Now here."" It's a big deal in the series, as you will find that it is the first time that those words had ever appeared (written in blood), because previously, anytime they had been written, it was ""God is nowhere.""Very intense show that made you think.  I especially loved the Airplane episode, where everyone gets their wish. It had a touching side story of true unconditional love.This show, by Angel co-creator David Greenwalt, was a gem that wasn't allowed to see the light.  Buy/pre-order this and treat yourself to some very smart ideas regarding religion mythos (even if you are not religious, it's a good character driven show.)Just a little bit of trivia.  In Angel's season 4, there is a shout-out to this show (it had already being cancelled) where they have a chuch with a sign saying ""God is Nowhere.""",5,An excellent show...,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,1220,"['show', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'watched', 'most', 'run', 'ABC', 'was', 'hard', 'was', 'aired', 'unevenly', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'not.I', 'was', 'quite', 'sad', 'find', 'had', 'been', 'cancelled', 'mom', 'was', 'sad', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'gotten', 'hooked', 'too', 'Anyway', 'loved', 'show', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'quote', 'God', 'Now', 'here', 'big', 'deal', 'series', 'will', 'find', 'first', 'time', 'words', 'had', 'ever', 'appeared', 'written', 'blood', 'previously', 'anytime', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'was', 'God', 'nowhere', 'Very', 'intense', 'show', 'made', 'think', 'especially', 'loved', 'Airplane', 'episode', 'where', 'everyone', 'wish', 'had', 'touching', 'side', 'story', 'true', 'unconditional', 'love.This', 'show', 'Angel', 'co-creator', 'David', 'Greenwalt', 'was', 'gem', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'see', 'light', 'Buy/pre-order', 'treat', 'very', 'smart', 'ideas', 'regarding', 'religion', 'mythos', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'religious', 'good', 'character', 'driven', 'show', 'Just', 'little', 'bit', 'trivia', 'Angel', 'season', '4', 'shout-out', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'being', 'cancelled', 'where', 'have', 'chuch', 'sign', 'saying', 'God', 'Nowhere']",Miracles - The Complete Series
883227,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0007N1AM2,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[49, 56]","I'm so fed up with broadcast corporations cancelling shows that have even the slightest hint of cerebral value. FOX tops my list of stations that have an almost A.D.D. style of shoot and cancel -- they did the same thing to WONDERFALLS, another fine series that made you think.MIRACLES was off to an excellent start: put a young man in the priesthood on a special Catholic task force who's sole purpose is to seek out reported miracles in the world, then report back to a cardinal as to if they were real, fake, or unknown. Paul Callan (Skeet Ulrich, Scream) is this one-man force who has science, religion, and a wobbling faith all tied up inside himself. MIRACLES starts out showing us this dark man visiting a cemetery being moved. When they dig up the coffins, a nun who was buried there falls out of the bottom of her casket. And she's in perfect condition, even though she's been dead for 160 years. Come to find out, the graveyard is sitting next to an apricot orchard, and apricots have a preservative effect. Paul realizes this immediately and kicks open a few other coffins to prove it -- inside those are perfectly preserved corpses, too. Thus we get to see that Paul isn't looking for miracles, but is simply trying to give credence to the unexplained.Also in the first episode, we get to see Paul nearly killed in a train versus automobile crash. While lying in the crumpled car, he sees his blood on the windshield; and it forms a sentence (this is called Hemography) that reads ""God is now here."" And then a young boy (whom he'd been investigating because of claims that the boy healed with a touch of his hands, but then became ill after each ""healing"") comes to him and heals Paul ...then the boy dies. When Paul reports back to the cardinal about what he'd experienced, the cardinal dismisses his claim, so Paul up and quits the church. But in the wings is waiting a man who runs a special paranormal research agency. Alva Keel (Angus Macfadyen, Braveheart) becomes Paul's new boss, and the discoveries they make are terribly disturbing.Apparently, most people who've seen the message that Paul saw in his blood didn't see ""God is now here."" They saw ""God is nowhere."" And so begins their spiritual, paranormal, and dark journey.The thing that bugged me most about this series was its title, MIRACLES. I didn't see most of what they found to be miraculous as much as disturbingly dangerous. But even so, the series held together pretty well regardless of its name.Paul has to try and overcome the fact that he was saved by a child who gave up his life for Paul's. This horrible event haunts Paul throughout the series as we repeatedly witness his visions and dreams of the boy, eyes bleeding, face gaunt, hair falling out.It is worth noting, too, that this series has very little in the way of spiritual upliftingness. There are touches of it, but mostly the episodes hit on something dark coming, something terrible. The apocalypse maybe?The viewer is never given any insight into what exactly is in store for Paul and his paranormal investigations. And, unfortunately, we'll never really know for sure since the show was cancelled (can I bare my b&tt; so that FOX executives can kiss it!)But I do have a theory of my own. Paul was an orphan and never knew his mother or father, and this plays a vital part of Paul's character and how we view him. He's a loner, but a good person at heart. He's just suffering over what to do with his questioning faith in ...everything. But everyone in the series wants to be near him and trusts him. He also goes through Hell on Earth; during his investigations he almost always gets the cr@p beat out of him, only to recover and move on to the next case. I think he was being set up for something large and important; perhaps to become an angel or a type of disciple for the next coming.But, again, who knows. FOX's idiocy has ruined another great character show. Morons!I didn't give the show 5 stars because some of the episodes were pretty pedestrian in nature and easy to figure out, but the acting, excellent filming, and haunting music all made this a very watchable series.",4,Another Cancellation of a Good TV Series.

This series was a political hot potato that ABC took a chance on because of its quality and potential, but any broadcast network show that blatantly takes on the Catholic church (by making the higher-ups look like bloodless bureaucrats) must expect some fallout.  They got it, and since the ratings weren't spectacular ""Miracles"" flailed and was yanked from the spring 2004 schedule.  Definite candidate for Trio's ""Brilliant But Cancelled"" showcase.So, what is ""Miracles""?  It's a kind of amalgam of ""The X-Files,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and ""The Twilight Zone,"" just to give you a feel for what the show is like in general.  It's about a young priest (Skeet Ulrich) whose job is to investigate alleged miracles, with an eye to authenticating any such legitimate event.  These miracles are always bogus, and he is therefore brought to a place where he has serious doubts about his faith, and when he is the beneficiary of what he believes to be an actual miracle that his higher-ups don't want to know about, he quits his job and finds his way to employment with a fellow investigator (Angus McFadyen) who is investigating the same thing....but has some disturbing information about the miracle the younger priest had experienced.I've been scrounging the 'net for months waiting for a DVD to be made available, and here it is.  Although there are only 13 episodes and obviously there'll be no final payoff of the story, the episodes I saw in the U.S. were extraordinary in terms of stories and production values.  Ulrich is not the greatest actor in the world, but neither was David Duchovny of ""The X-Files,"" so I can live with that.  These are fascinating tales of imaginative fiction, and most shortcomings can be overlooked.It's not surprising that a TV series of this quality would fall through the cracks in these days of reality TV and the need of the networks to cut costs (mediocre ratings not acceptable unless program is relatively cheap to produce, as are reality and news shows), so let's just be happy ""Miracles"" was given the go-ahead in the first place....although ABC ultimately displayed the typical network short-sightedness of axing a program that had just begun to find its audience.",5,Hurray!,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2335,"['Obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'actual', 'DVD', 'yet', 'will', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'about', 'two', 'months', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'preordering', 'series', 'was', 'political', 'hot', 'potato', 'ABC', 'took', 'chance', 'quality', 'potential', 'broadcast', 'network', 'show', 'blatantly', 'Catholic', 'church', 'making', 'higher-ups', 'look', 'bloodless', 'bureaucrats', 'must', 'expect', 'fallout', 'got', 'ratings', 'were', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'Miracles', 'flailed', 'was', 'yanked', 'spring', '2004', 'schedule', 'Definite', 'candidate', 'Trio', 'Brilliant', 'Cancelled', 'showcase.So', 'what', 'Miracles', 'kind', 'amalgam', 'X-Files', 'Exorcist', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'just', 'give', 'feel', 'what', 'show', 'general', 'young', 'priest', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'job', 'investigate', 'alleged', 'miracles', 'eye', 'authenticating', 'such', 'legitimate', 'event', 'miracles', 'are', 'always', 'bogus', 'therefore', 'brought', 'place', 'where', 'serious', 'doubts', 'faith', 'when', 'beneficiary', 'what', 'be', 'actual', 'miracle', 'higher-ups', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'about', 'job', 'way', 'employment', 'fellow', 'investigator', 'Angus', 'McFadyen', 'who', 'investigating', 'same', 'thing', '.but', 'disturbing', 'information', 'miracle', 'younger', 'priest', 'had', 'experienced.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scrounging', ""'net"", 'months', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'here', 'are', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'obviously', ""'ll"", 'be', 'final', 'payoff', 'story', 'episodes', 'saw', 'U.S.', 'were', 'extraordinary', 'terms', 'stories', 'production', 'values', 'Ulrich', 'not', 'greatest', 'actor', 'world', 'was', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'X-Files', 'can', 'live', 'are', 'fascinating', 'tales', 'imaginative', 'fiction', 'most', 'shortcomings', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'surprising', 'TV', 'series', 'quality', 'would', 'fall', 'cracks', 'days', 'reality', 'TV', 'need', 'networks', 'cut', 'costs', 'mediocre', 'ratings', 'not', 'acceptable', 'program', 'relatively', 'cheap', 'produce', 'are', 'reality', 'news', 'shows', 'so', 'let', 'just', 'be', 'happy', 'Miracles', 'was', 'given', 'go-ahead', 'first', 'place', 'ABC', 'ultimately', 'displayed', 'typical', 'network', 'short-sightedness', 'axing', 'program', 'had', 'just', 'begun', 'find', 'audience']",Miracles - The Complete Series

As pointed out, this show was killed not because of any controversy, but because of the war in Iraq. After three airings, ABC pre-empted the Monday timeslot three out of four weeks. By the time the three remaining episodes saw the light of day, the only ones watching were the dedicated Angel fans who loved David Greenwalt's work. So despite critical praise, the show vanished. Like Wonderfalls, here was another character driven show in an age of only plot driven fodder like the CSI and Law & Order franchise. Like most networks over the last few years, they don't know what to do with shows that put character development over predictable action, sex and violence. So ABC stumbled and thusly had no faith in that viewers would find the show. Had they been smart -and had wanted to keep the show - they should've started reairing the show in April of 2003, but that opened a whole barrel of over issues. Still, they could've saved it for the summer or even held it back until late August. Whatever, I am glad this show is coming to DVD. It deserves to be seen, and while I'm sure only Buffy and Angel fans will buy this, maybe we can convince more people outside those two franchises to buy it. I mean, I showed a friend Wonderfalls, and he was so impressed with -at the time he first though this was an Ally McBeal rip-off - he went out an bought the set. I was happy. This show should've continued. Maybe, if enough people buy this, someone might be convinced to do a big screen version.

Only a handful of episodes aired before the show was canceled by ABC. It is hard to believe that such an intriguing show that is so well written met the fate of early cancellation. Skeet Ulrich stars as Paul Callan in this series as a young man whose job is to discover potential miracles. In the pilot episode his faith is seriously waning. At times he even questions whether God exists, of course he didn't utter such a phrase on network television, his exact words were , ""I wonder sometimes if we are on our own down here."" It is learned that Paul was a foster child and this explains his ties to the church. When he is assigned to visit a family with a young boy, he assumes it will be another false miracle. When he meets this young boy named Tommy, he is intrigued to find that the boy has healing powers. He also realizes that everything Tommy heals someone, he gets sicker himself. Tommy's father feels the boys should continue to heal others despite his own sickness, Tommy's mother wants her son to stop healing and to save his straight for himself. Paul promises to stay by Tommy's side.Not wanting to be a spoiler, but Paul eventually leaves Tommy's family. The incident with the young boy renews Paul's faith and inspires him to continue on with his pursuit of miracles. When he returns to his job and tells the church his findings, he is shocked when the dispel the miracles that he has just witnessed. He quits his job, hooks up with a mysterious man (Angus Macfayden), and a former police officer (Maria Ramirez), they form their own operation in the pursuit of explorer strange occurrences that have a dark underside.This is a very interesting show and if you like shows like X-Files and CSI, you will love this show and be hooked. You will want to watch the entire series. By the way, the DVD box set includes 7 episodes that never aired in the United States. This isn't a real religious show as some might think it is based on the title. It is more of a supernatural thriller type of show. Watch one episode and you will be hooked. Thanks to Shout Factory you can enjoy this show on DVD.

""Miracles"" had thoughtful writing, solid acting (gotta love the Skeeter!) and the beginnings of an intricate story line involving a Miracle-busting Paul Callan (Skeet Ulrich) who works for the Catholic church investigating purported signs of Godly presence. Weave in a great role for Hector Elizondo and you have all the makings of an innovative, original drama--just the kind of offering ABC was itchin' to dump. So, when the head program guy at ABC caught his own reflection in the mirror, he apparently became too distracted to restore ""Miracles"" to a decent, consistent time slot after the network was done with its ratings darling of the week--its news coverage of ""shock and awe"" in Iraq.""Miracles"" is one of the reasons viewers should NEVER watch network TV shows until they've been on at least three years. DON'T make an emotional commitment to a show if the networks aren't willing to do the same. Once a show's been on for three years, you'll at least be able to view a decent number of episodes via DVD, downloading, NetFlix, etc. In the short term, yes, this will cause more good shows to get cancelled while the broadcast networks learn their lesson (and remember, they're VERY slow learners). Over time, however, ABC (and, to a lesser extent, CBS, NBC and FOX) will learn American viewers aren't going to get attached to good quality dramas knowing they may get axed in favor of the next ""America's Got X-Factors Dancing With the Survivors"" knockoff. And maybe that'll make them not jerk around with their schedules so much that they preclude great shows like ""Miracles"" from developing a regular weekly following (remember, ""Cheers"" had horrendous ratings its first year, but NBC stuck with it and it became one of the most beloved, and popular shows of all time--not to mention spawning an excellent spinoff with ""Frazier""). Or, maybe it'll just drive us to watch more shows on cable networks, which is where ""Miracles"" would have thrived if given half a chance...Remember, more frequently than not, ABC stands for ""Already Been Cancelled"". Make them stop! Or, for those few souls who actually had a chance to watch ""Miracles"", visualize a world where it's not ""ABC is Now Here""; it's ""ABC is Nowhere"".",5,This is why broadcast network TV shouldn't be supported,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,2586,"['GREAT', 'series', 'cancelled', 'prematurely', 'nitwits', 'AB-Now-You-', 'C', '-It-Now-You-Do', ""n't"", 'can', 'go', 'way', 'back', 'ABC', 'shows', 'such', 'Tenspeed', 'Brownshoe', 'circa', '1980', 'way', 'ABC', 'Life', 'Mars', 'circa', '2009', 'LAST', 'network', 'TV', 'show', 'bothered', 'watching', 'regularly', 'hitting', 'lot', 'great', 'prematurely', 'dumped', 'shows', 'Miracles', 'had', 'thoughtful', 'writing', 'solid', 'acting', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'Skeeter', 'beginnings', 'intricate', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'Miracle-busting', 'Paul', 'Callan', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'who', 'Catholic', 'church', 'investigating', 'purported', 'signs', 'Godly', 'presence', 'Weave', 'great', 'role', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'have', 'makings', 'innovative', 'original', 'drama', 'just', 'kind', 'offering', 'ABC', 'was', 'itchin', 'dump', 'So', 'when', 'head', 'program', 'guy', 'ABC', 'caught', 'own', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'apparently', 'became', 'too', 'distracted', 'restore', 'Miracles', 'decent', 'consistent', 'time', 'slot', 'network', 'was', 'done', 'ratings', 'darling', 'week', 'news', 'coverage', 'shock', 'awe', 'Iraq', 'Miracles', 'one', 'reasons', 'viewers', 'should', 'NEVER', 'watch', 'network', 'TV', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'been', 'least', 'three', 'years', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'make', 'emotional', 'commitment', 'show', 'networks', 'are', ""n't"", 'willing', 'do', 'same', 'show', 'been', 'three', 'years', ""'ll"", 'least', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'decent', 'number', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'downloading', 'NetFlix', 'etc', 'short', 'term', 'yes', 'will', 'cause', 'more', 'good', 'shows', 'get', 'cancelled', 'broadcast', 'networks', 'learn', 'lesson', 'remember', ""'re"", 'VERY', 'slow', 'learners', 'time', 'however', 'ABC', 'lesser', 'extent', 'CBS', 'NBC', 'FOX', 'will', 'learn', 'American', 'viewers', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'attached', 'good', 'quality', 'dramas', 'knowing', 'may', 'get', 'axed', 'favor', 'next', 'America', 'Got', 'X-Factors', 'Dancing', 'Survivors', 'knockoff', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'make', 'not', 'jerk', 'schedules', 'so', 'much', 'preclude', 'great', 'shows', 'Miracles', 'developing', 'regular', 'weekly', 'following', 'remember', 'Cheers', 'had', 'horrendous', 'ratings', 'first', 'year', 'NBC', 'stuck', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'popular', 'shows', 'time', 'not', 'mention', 'spawning', 'excellent', 'spinoff', 'Frazier', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'just', 'drive', 'watch', 'more', 'shows', 'cable', 'networks', 'where', 'Miracles', 'would', 'have', 'thrived', 'given', 'chance', 'Remember', 'more', 'frequently', 'not', 'ABC', 'Already', 'Been', 'Cancelled', 'Make', 'stop', 'few', 'souls', 'who', 'actually', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'Miracles', 'visualize', 'world', 'where', 'not', 'ABC', 'Now', 'Here', 'ABC', 'Nowhere']",Miracles - The Complete Series

It is about a team of investigators that look into strange occurrences.  These occurrences cannot be explained by laws of reason or logic.  Each episode takes you on a journey of mystery and intrigue.  It is often dark but you can't turn away.  The writing is excellent-the actors make you care about the characters.  Each member of the team is brought to this time for different reasons.  It is a show that touches your emotions-all of them.  One moment you will feel hope and then the next, you feel fear.

This was surprisingly good, though a bit rough. We did watch the whole series in under two days. Just kept wanting to see what would happen next. This series had real potential but I guess never picked up too many viewers. Some episodes are absorbing. Skeet Ulrich seems very uncomfortable initially as a un professed priest, but more believable as a former seminarian and an investigator of the paranormal. He has special feel or connection to the supernatural world which he doesn't quite know how to integrate in his life. You could really pick apart a few things, but it is better just to enjoy the stories and let them take you along.It was weird the directors or writers seem to think the Catholic church still commonly uses a Latin rite. One of those TV things. More spooky that way. I half expected that Paul Cullen would be revealed as another Damien due to his background as an orphan, his supernatural vibe, and the East Coast setting. What is there is of this series can be enjoyed, even if you can tell there are bits to be filled in and finished. No regrets on the purchase and will watch it again some rainy weekend this winter.Side comment-Skeet Ulrich looks very natural with kids on screen. He really seems to connect with them, even when they are ghosts. It seems like he ought to be cast in roles were he interacts even more with juveniles, perhaps as a slightly edgy or intense sports coach, teacher, youth probation officer, single Dad, etc. Wish there was more out there for him, he's very enjoyable to watch in roles that play to his strengths.",5,We watched episode after episode,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,1686,"['never', 'saw', 'series', 'TV', 'bought', 'curiosity', 're', 'watching', 'Jericho', 'seeing', 'cross', 'reference', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'bit', 'rough', 'did', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'two', 'days', 'Just', 'kept', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'series', 'had', 'real', 'potential', 'guess', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'too', 'many', 'viewers', 'episodes', 'are', 'absorbing', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'initially', 'un', 'professed', 'priest', 'more', 'believable', 'former', 'seminarian', 'investigator', 'paranormal', 'special', 'feel', 'connection', 'supernatural', 'world', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'integrate', 'life', 'could', 'really', 'pick', 'apart', 'few', 'things', 'better', 'just', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'let', 'take', 'along.It', 'was', 'weird', 'directors', 'writers', 'seem', 'think', 'Catholic', 'church', 'still', 'commonly', 'Latin', 'rite', 'One', 'TV', 'things', 'More', 'spooky', 'way', 'half', 'expected', 'Paul', 'Cullen', 'would', 'be', 'revealed', 'Damien', 'due', 'background', 'orphan', 'supernatural', 'vibe', 'East', 'Coast', 'setting', 'What', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'bits', 'be', 'filled', 'finished', 'No', 'regrets', 'purchase', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'rainy', 'weekend', 'winter.Side', 'comment-Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'very', 'natural', 'kids', 'screen', 'really', 'connect', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'ghosts', 'ought', 'be', 'cast', 'roles', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'juveniles', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'edgy', 'intense', 'sports', 'coach', 'teacher', 'youth', 'probation', 'officer', 'single', 'Dad', 'etc', 'Wish', 'was', 'more', 'there', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'roles', 'play', 'strengths']",Miracles - The Complete Series
