Then, when it was released in VHS commercial format, I purchased that. I donated that copy to the Visiting Nurse Association I was employed at.  Several of my co-workers borrowed the tape & used it as part of their continuing education & to stay certified.  Then, I purchased the DVD.  I have watched this program a BUNCH of times.  Each viewing brings another little piece of information for my brain.  I am a Home Health Aide who has cared for a few clients affected by AD & this video is a helpful resource.When you suspect that either you or a family member is starting to show signs of AD - GET THIS VIDEO & watch it - more than once.  Another that has proven helpful is ""Alzheimer's Disease: Facing the Facts"".  That was the second video I purchased & it may also prove to be helpful.

791577,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00012FXO0,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Having lost two loved ones to Alzheimer 's disease, I was very eager to see how this documentary would explore the topic. I was not disappointed. There was plenty of footage showing just how hard it is for the families and caregivers of the ill to carry on and deal with their loved one's ""disappearing"" right in front of them; and we also get a good deal of time devoted to seeing just how stressful and devastating the initial diagnosis and early Alzheimer's can be for those afflicted with the disease.The film deals with Alzheimer's in two ways: the human level and the much more scientific level. On a human level, this documentary does a superb job. The footage with patients and their family caregivers, including several rather candid interviews, is both poignant and quite memorable. We see that hard choices must eventually be made about the person in an advanced stage of Alzheimer's: would they want to be kept alive if they got pneumonia? Would they want to be resuscitated in the event of a heart attack? It depends on the individual case; there is no right or wrong answer for all patients and for all families.On a scientific level, there is considerable time for the documentary to explain how Alzheimer's ravages the human brain and we see researchers struggling for decades at a time to identify a gene that can cause a person to be particularly likely to get an aggressive form of Alzheimer's that occurs comparatively early in life--as early as thirty-nine in the case of one woman discussed in this documentary! Some of this is sad but on the bright side science is clearly making noticeable strides toward their dream of being able to slow down the illness and, of course, halting the disease or even curing it someday.There's more still to the documentary; the footage will move you without a doubt and I don't want to spoil it for you by giving too much more away.The DVD comes with a couple of extras that I liked. There is a 30 minute ""Q&A;"" session hosted by David Hyde Pierce; and the interview with the author of ""The Forgetting--Alzheimer's: Portrait of an Epidemic,"" David Shenk, is well worth your time. There is yet another interview with filmmaker Elizabeth Arledge.The Forgetting - A Portrait of Alzheimer's is a fine documentary that explores many aspects and angles of this disease on both a human level and a scientific level. I highly recommend this DVD for people who are caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease; and people studying aging in general would do well to add this to their collections, too.",5,fine documentary about the sad and long goodbye,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,2550,"['Having', 'lost', 'two', 'loved', 'ones', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'was', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'documentary', 'would', 'explore', 'topic', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'was', 'plenty', 'footage', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'families', 'caregivers', 'ill', 'carry', 'deal', 'loved', 'one', 'disappearing', 'right', 'front', 'also', 'get', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'devoted', 'seeing', 'just', 'how', 'stressful', 'devastating', 'initial', 'diagnosis', 'early', 'Alzheimer', 'can', 'be', 'afflicted', 'disease.The', 'film', 'deals', 'Alzheimer', 'two', 'ways', 'human', 'level', 'much', 'more', 'scientific', 'level', 'human', 'level', 'documentary', 'superb', 'job', 'footage', 'patients', 'family', 'caregivers', 'including', 'several', 'rather', 'candid', 'interviews', 'poignant', 'quite', 'memorable', 'see', 'hard', 'choices', 'must', 'eventually', 'be', 'made', 'person', 'advanced', 'stage', 'Alzheimer', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'kept', 'alive', 'got', 'pneumonia', 'Would', 'want', 'be', 'resuscitated', 'event', 'heart', 'attack', 'individual', 'case', 'right', 'wrong', 'answer', 'patients', 'families.On', 'scientific', 'level', 'considerable', 'time', 'documentary', 'explain', 'how', 'Alzheimer', 'human', 'brain', 'see', 'researchers', 'struggling', 'decades', 'time', 'identify', 'gene', 'can', 'cause', 'person', 'be', 'particularly', 'likely', 'get', 'aggressive', 'form', 'Alzheimer', 'comparatively', 'early', 'life', 'as', 'early', 'thirty-nine', 'case', 'one', 'woman', 'discussed', 'documentary', 'sad', 'bright', 'side', 'science', 'clearly', 'making', 'noticeable', 'strides', 'dream', 'being', 'able', 'slow', 'down', 'illness', 'course', 'halting', 'disease', 'even', 'curing', 'more', 'still', 'documentary', 'footage', 'will', 'move', 'doubt', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'away.The', 'DVD', 'couple', 'extras', 'liked', '30', 'minute', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'hosted', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'interview', 'author', 'Forgetting', 'Alzheimer', 'Portrait', 'Epidemic', 'David', 'Shenk', 'well', 'time', 'yet', 'interview', 'filmmaker', 'Elizabeth', 'Arledge.The', 'Forgetting', 'Portrait', 'Alzheimer', 'fine', 'documentary', 'many', 'aspects', 'angles', 'disease', 'human', 'level', 'scientific', 'level', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'caring', 'loved', 'ones', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'people', 'studying', 'aging', 'general', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections', 'too']",N/A
791578,A2E7E9EWADK4S6,B00012FXO0,"Rosemary Thornton ""Niece of Murder Victim, Ad...","[12, 13]","October 2005, I spent several days at the bedside of my beloved Auntie, waiting for her to pass on. It was the end of a very long road for us. Those last few days, sitting at her bedside in a St. Louis nursing home, I prayed for her, held her hand, stroked her face and arms and even crawled up in her bed so that I could hold her in my arms and tell her how much I loved her.On a sunny, brisk Tuesday morning, I was holding her hand when she took her last breath and left for heaven.When she passed on, I stood there and wept. For the next hour, all I could think was, ""Thank God, it's over. Thank God, it's over. Thank God, she's free.""Auntie had Alzheimer's for many, many years. I'd been her caretaker and advocate and power-of-attorney for the last five years.All in all, it was light duty, as she was in a nursing home. I was the one who mended her clothes, kept her wheelchair tires pumped up, had conniption fits when she wasn't properly cared for (and scared the nursing staff into caring for her more properly!), sang her songs, gave her hugs, clipped her toenails, reviewed her medical chart once a month, talked to the doctors and nurses and inspected her body once a month for bruises and sores and anything else.In 2002, when a family member came to town for a visit, I urged him to ""come visit Auntie"" and he obliged. After 60 seconds with her, he turned and ran back outside saying only, ""I can't deal with this. I love her too much to see this.""That's when I learned more about what love really looks like. As St. Augustine said, ""What does love look like? It has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men. It has the eyes to see misery and want. That is what love looks like.""And that's what this movie really brought out. True love - real love - is taking care of someone when they sink into the abyss of Alzheimer's. It's having the moral courage to hold someone's hand and stay with them, mentally, physically and emotionally, even when all that you know of them seems to have disappeared.That said, it was almost impossible for me to watch this powerful documentary. Too close. Too painful. Too honest. But it was also a relief and a comfort. To know that my most secret prayers and thoughts and hopes (that caused me pain and guilt and regret), were the same prayers and thoughts and hopes that others experienced when dealing with this diseaase.For instance, during the last week of Auntie's life, I caught myself praying *intensely* that she would pass soon. When the full force of that prayer hit me - the realization that I was praying *for* someone's death - I jumped up and ran outside and sat by the duckpond in front of the nursing home. Tears rolled down my face as I stared aimlessly at the small pond in front of me.What was I doing? Praying for my beloved auntie to die? What kind of person am I to ask for such a thing? I'd been entrusted with her care and here I was asking God to end her life??And in this documentary ""The Forgetting"" I saw that other family members went through this same torment: Wanting their loved one at peace but hating themselves for praying for someone's demise.That's one example of about 25. There are a lot of secret thoughts one harbors when dealing with a loved one who has Alzheimer's. And I'm talking about the person who *really deals* with the loved one. The person who is DOWN IN THE TRENCHES doing the fighting, doing the praying, and DOING THE WORK.""The Forgetting"" did a beautiful and honest job of capturing those thoughts and feelings and emotions that the loved ones face through the long, slow course of this disease.Speaking as someone who just emerged from those trenches, I highly recommend this documentary. This morning, several hours after watching the video (last night), I feel more peace about Auntie's passing than ever before. I feel as though someone took my hand and said, ""it's okay. You did all the right things.""Buy it, rent it, watch it, but be prepared to shed a few tears.Rose Thorntongentlebeam@hotmail.com",5,"powerful, memorable and honest",1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,4010,"['October', '2005', 'spent', 'several', 'days', 'bedside', 'beloved', 'Auntie', 'waiting', 'pass', 'was', 'end', 'very', 'long', 'road', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'sitting', 'bedside', 'St.', 'Louis', 'nursing', 'home', 'prayed', 'held', 'hand', 'stroked', 'face', 'arms', 'even', 'crawled', 'up', 'bed', 'could', 'hold', 'arms', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'sunny', 'brisk', 'Tuesday', 'morning', 'was', 'holding', 'hand', 'when', 'took', 'last', 'breath', 'left', 'heaven.When', 'passed', 'stood', 'wept', 'next', 'hour', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'Thank', 'God', 'over', 'Thank', 'God', 'over', 'Thank', 'God', 'free', 'Auntie', 'had', 'Alzheimer', 'many', 'many', 'years', ""'d"", 'been', 'caretaker', 'advocate', 'power-of-attorney', 'last', 'five', 'years.All', 'was', 'light', 'duty', 'was', 'nursing', 'home', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'mended', 'clothes', 'kept', 'wheelchair', 'tires', 'pumped', 'up', 'had', 'conniption', 'fits', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'properly', 'cared', 'scared', 'nursing', 'staff', 'caring', 'more', 'properly', 'sang', 'songs', 'gave', 'hugs', 'clipped', 'toenails', 'reviewed', 'medical', 'chart', 'once', 'month', 'talked', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'inspected', 'body', 'once', 'month', 'bruises', 'sores', 'anything', 'else.In', '2002', 'when', 'family', 'member', 'came', 'town', 'visit', 'urged', 'come', 'visit', 'Auntie', 'obliged', '60', 'seconds', 'turned', 'ran', 'back', 'outside', 'saying', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'love', 'too', 'much', 'see', 'when', 'learned', 'more', 'what', 'love', 'really', 'like', 'St.', 'Augustine', 'said', 'What', 'love', 'look', 'ears', 'hear', 'sighs', 'sorrows', 'men', 'eyes', 'see', 'misery', 'want', 'what', 'love', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'brought', 'out', 'True', 'love', 'real', 'love', 'taking', 'care', 'someone', 'when', 'sink', 'abyss', 'Alzheimer', 'having', 'moral', 'courage', 'hold', 'someone', 'hand', 'stay', 'mentally', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'have', 'disappeared.That', 'said', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'watch', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'Too', 'close', 'Too', 'painful', 'Too', 'honest', 'was', 'also', 'relief', 'comfort', 'know', 'most', 'secret', 'prayers', 'thoughts', 'hopes', 'caused', 'pain', 'guilt', 'regret', 'were', 'same', 'prayers', 'thoughts', 'hopes', 'others', 'experienced', 'when', 'dealing', 'diseaase.For', 'instance', 'last', 'week', 'Auntie', 'life', 'caught', 'praying', '*intensely*', 'would', 'pass', 'soon', 'When', 'full', 'force', 'prayer', 'hit', 'realization', 'was', 'praying', '*for*', 'someone', 'death', 'jumped', 'up', 'ran', 'outside', 'sat', 'duckpond', 'front', 'nursing', 'home', 'Tears', 'rolled', 'down', 'face', 'stared', 'aimlessly', 'small', 'pond', 'front', 'me.What', 'was', 'doing', 'Praying', 'beloved', 'auntie', 'die', 'What', 'kind', 'person', 'am', 'ask', 'such', 'thing', ""'d"", 'been', 'entrusted', 'care', 'here', 'was', 'asking', 'God', 'end', 'life', 'documentary', 'Forgetting', 'saw', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'went', 'same', 'torment', 'Wanting', 'loved', 'one', 'peace', 'hating', 'praying', 'someone', 'demise.That', 'one', 'example', 'about', '25', 'are', 'lot', 'secret', 'thoughts', 'one', 'harbors', 'when', 'dealing', 'loved', 'one', 'who', 'Alzheimer', ""'m"", 'talking', 'person', 'who', '*really', 'deals*', 'loved', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'DOWN', 'IN', 'THE', 'TRENCHES', 'doing', 'fighting', 'doing', 'praying', 'DOING', 'THE', 'WORK', 'Forgetting', 'did', 'beautiful', 'honest', 'job', 'capturing', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'loved', 'ones', 'face', 'long', 'slow', 'course', 'disease.Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'emerged', 'trenches', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'morning', 'several', 'hours', 'watching', 'video', 'last', 'night', 'feel', 'more', 'peace', 'Auntie', 'passing', 'ever', 'feel', 'someone', 'took', 'hand', 'said', 'okay', 'did', 'right', 'things', 'rent', 'watch', 'be', 'prepared', 'shed', 'few', 'tears.Rose', 'Thorntongentlebeam', '@', 'hotmail.com']",N/A
