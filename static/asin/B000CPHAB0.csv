If you wonder what's going wrong today with our kids: they've become so violent, so hyper, so emotionally immature while sexually precocious, you shouldn't look very far. Look at their environment. See who's around in the streets and in their homes. Bad influences in the street? Yes. No father figure at home? For sure. Rich parents who spoil their kids by ""buying"" their love? Plenty. Busy parents who trust money will do the job of raising? Mostly. Now how on earth can these kids ever develop their brains, grow mentally, aquire a culture, if we are still bustling with environmental (out-of-school) problems?All the violence and sex that floods our society has to reflect on our kids behavior. It's normal that the violence they see, and suffer, out there impacts them so much that they mainly try to survive in the jungle of peer pressure and street gangs. It's just too much.This documentary is concise, right on target. It gives no concessions to political correctness and is straight common sense. A breeze of fresh air amid all the babble from administrators and pedagogues. Straight talk. Higly recommended. Besides, it's very entertaining, high quality image, and engrossing from the go.It'll do you good.

959871,A3I3CQ0Y9472FA,B000CPHAB0,GenXmom,"[0, 0]","There are so many parenting books on the market it would someone months of full-time reading to sort through them, then there are parenting books targeted at raising boys or girls. Raising Cain is a documentary offshoot of the seminal book, and it was a very insightful viewing for me, a mom of a typically developing boy. If you haven't read the original book and don't have time to, you should at least see this documentary. Sometimes an audio-visual presentation has a stronger ability to shock some truth into you, and parents really need to see all the messages directed at boys -- messages that over time deny boys' feelings, a chance to develop emotional intelligence and true empathy, and essentially their humanity. On top of that a pervasive popular culture of violence and cruelty chips away at boys' foundation and has led too many youths to a life of violence and criminality.Raising Cain: Exploring the Inner Lives of America's Boys does a good job of balancing the nature versus nurture question, but sheds light on the nurture/environment problems to wake us up to the realization that these problems can be changed. Perhaps some of the video's content may seem like hash and rehash to those who are well informed about boys' troubles and youth crises, but I think it does a good job presenting the information to a wide audience who may not have realized the problems cross socioeconomic lines.I can highly recommend this video to parents, educators, child psychologists, and administrators!

959872,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B000CPHAB0,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[33, 33]","Even if you've read the book, don't miss the chance to see this, recently featured on public television stations across the country. It is a real eyeopener and demonstrates HOW and WHY boys are being shortchanged by both our educational system (a primary focus of the documentary)as well as by society and by stereotypes.I watched this one with my husband and two sons and they were soon talking excitedly about how ""true"" the documentary was, how they got it ""right"" and how they'd captured the very real challenges and heartbreaking experiences of trying to fit into an eductional system which isn't geared to the unique traits and abilities of boys.Agree or not, this one will get you thinking and raises some interesting points such as:1. Girls tend to read earlier than boys and are more verbal than boys.2. Smart boys tend to blossom in all male schools but are generally squelched in schools where both genders are in the same classrooms.3. Intelligent boys may ""pretend"" to be stupid in order to appear cool or to avoid teasing from other kids.4. EVERY boy needs to master some skill. Athletic ability seems to be the first choice but if a male isn't athletically skilled, music or other abilities can help fill the gap.But this movie goes far beyond the few points I've brought up. A major feature is the close-up view of several individuals, each of them offering a different perspective on being male in our society. I also like the fact that the film focuses on both elementary school boys and high school students, devoting about 1/2 the documentary to each age.Absolutely a MUST for parents, teachers and anyone interested in raising happy, productive young males.",5,A must-see for anyone parenting boys!,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,1678,"['Even', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'chance', 'see', 'recently', 'featured', 'public', 'television', 'stations', 'country', 'real', 'eyeopener', 'HOW', 'WHY', 'boys', 'are', 'being', 'shortchanged', 'educational', 'system', 'primary', 'focus', 'documentary', 'as', 'well', 'society', 'stereotypes.I', 'watched', 'one', 'husband', 'two', 'sons', 'were', 'soon', 'talking', 'excitedly', 'how', 'true', 'documentary', 'was', 'how', 'got', 'right', 'how', ""'d"", 'captured', 'very', 'real', 'challenges', 'heartbreaking', 'experiences', 'trying', 'fit', 'eductional', 'system', ""n't"", 'geared', 'unique', 'traits', 'abilities', 'boys.Agree', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'get', 'thinking', 'interesting', 'points', 'such', 'as:1', 'Girls', 'tend', 'read', 'earlier', 'boys', 'are', 'more', 'verbal', 'boys.2', 'Smart', 'tend', 'blossom', 'male', 'schools', 'are', 'generally', 'squelched', 'schools', 'where', 'genders', 'are', 'same', 'classrooms.3', 'Intelligent', 'may', 'pretend', 'be', 'stupid', 'order', 'appear', 'cool', 'avoid', 'teasing', 'other', 'kids.4', 'EVERY', 'boy', 'master', 'skill', 'Athletic', 'ability', 'be', 'first', 'choice', 'male', ""n't"", 'athletically', 'skilled', 'music', 'other', 'abilities', 'can', 'help', 'fill', 'gap.But', 'movie', 'far', 'few', 'points', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'up', 'major', 'feature', 'close-up', 'view', 'several', 'individuals', 'offering', 'different', 'perspective', 'being', 'male', 'society', 'also', 'fact', 'film', 'elementary', 'school', 'boys', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'devoting', '1/2', 'documentary', 'age.Absolutely', 'MUST', 'parents', 'teachers', 'anyone', 'interested', 'raising', 'happy', 'productive', 'young', 'males']",Raising Cain: Exploring the Inner Lives of America's Boys  PBS Home Video

I found it to be right there verging on incredible.True... true... true... you'll find yourself thinking this over and over throughout this documentary. Don't let yourself think this is just an angry, harsh critique of the USA. I know some people don't like that. The tone isn't angry at all. This is an honest exploration into the emotional lives of boys, from preschool to highschool. Or more precisely, the lack of emotional lives that so much of American society tries to impose on its boys and men. It's somewhere between inspiring and saddening.In the younger aged sections, I thought the Japanese study/footage was incredible.

She told me that it helped her to understand why her son was so different from girls. She also had her husband view it and he said he understood why their son preferred his mother emotional support more and that he would be there for him when he came into puberty.With the schools attempt to feminize boys (the only way that would succeed is to emasculate them),there should be mandatory classroom instruction for teachers before they can get their credentials. All parents should insist that what's suggested by the film be implemented in all segment of our culture so we can stop the bleeding that alienated boys have caused to their fellow beings.There are other media that parents should read or view. There's institutional abuse (book-Harmful to Minors), parents who are more focused on themselves rather than their children (Norwegian film - Lakki, The Boy who could Fly).Teenagers have a difficult enough time what with bullying in schools, lack of personal privacy at home, and many others that make life very difficult for teenagers.I wish Michael Thompson had gone into boys emerging puberty on the subject of sex that was dealt with in the French film 'Murmur of the Heart'.",5,Mandatory Viewing,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1413,"['infant', 'boys', 'are', 'released', 'parents', 'hospitals', 'should', 'make', 'mandatory', 'parents', 'view', 'outstanding', 'film.I', 'had', 'niece', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'impressed', 'information', 'got', 'video', 'told', 'helped', 'understand', 'why', 'son', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'girls', 'also', 'had', 'husband', 'view', 'said', 'understood', 'why', 'son', 'preferred', 'mother', 'emotional', 'support', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'came', 'puberty.With', 'schools', 'attempt', 'feminize', 'boys', 'only', 'way', 'would', 'succeed', 'emasculate', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'classroom', 'instruction', 'teachers', 'can', 'get', 'credentials', 'parents', 'should', 'insist', 'what', 'suggested', 'film', 'be', 'implemented', 'segment', 'culture', 'can', 'stop', 'bleeding', 'alienated', 'boys', 'have', 'caused', 'fellow', 'are', 'other', 'media', 'parents', 'should', 'read', 'view', 'institutional', 'abuse', 'book-Harmful', 'Minors', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'focused', 'rather', 'children', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'Lakki', 'Boy', 'who', 'could', 'Fly', '.Teenagers', 'have', 'difficult', 'enough', 'time', 'what', 'bullying', 'schools', 'lack', 'personal', 'privacy', 'home', 'many', 'others', 'make', 'life', 'very', 'difficult', 'teenagers.I', 'wish', 'Michael', 'Thompson', 'had', 'gone', 'boys', 'emerging', 'puberty', 'subject', 'sex', 'was', 'dealt', 'French', 'film', ""'Murmur"", 'Heart']",Raising Cain: Exploring the Inner Lives of America's Boys  PBS Home Video
