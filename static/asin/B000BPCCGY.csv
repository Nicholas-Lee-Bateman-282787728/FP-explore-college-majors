947187,A2809U2S14N0K1,B000BPCCGY,BernardZ,"[3, 3]",I like submarine movies.Here the acting is wooden. The special effects are quite good. The story needs work. Overall the story is too short. It needs work eg whose mysterious submarine was it and what was its mission. The story could have used a few extra scenes.Some of the twists are quite unbelievable eg the way they get the caption to go on the second mission and the way the XO behaves on  the mission.There are much better submarine movies out there but this is worth seeing.,3,Too short,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,482,"['like', 'submarine', 'movies.Here', 'acting', 'wooden', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'story', 'work', 'story', 'too', 'short', 'work', 'eg', 'mysterious', 'submarine', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'mission', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'few', 'extra', 'scenes.Some', 'twists', 'are', 'quite', 'unbelievable', 'eg', 'way', 'get', 'caption', 'go', 'second', 'mission', 'way', 'XO', 'behaves', 'mission.There', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'submarine', 'movies', 'there', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

This version does not contain at least two scenes where Adrian Paul and Mike Doyle are kissing (they are lovers). The movie was originally titled, ""Tides of War."" Another scene edited out is when Catherine Dent's character tells Adrian Paul's character that she has found the letters that he sent to Mike Doyle's character.I rate this version of the movie 1 star for editing those scenes.

There were some good action scenes, and I liked the basic plot, so it's a shame there weren't a few more revisions to the script dealing with the characters. I think this could've been a fantastic action movie with just a little tweaking. The conversations made the actors sound 'stock'.

He looked very good in the uniform and he played the role of the Captain very well.  I read the other reviews for USS Poseidon-Phantom Below, and I did not know that there was supposed to be any gay element in the movie. That the commander had just lost his best friend in a tragic accident that he felt responsibility for as the captain was the only message that I got. It seems that the movie was edited from the origional,Tides of War.  At any rate, the story could have focused more on the phantom submarine that hunted them but overall it was an enjoyable movie and well worth what I paid for it used.",5,Adrian Paul Delivers,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,689,"['bought', 'movie', 'beacuse', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'was', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'uniform', 'played', 'role', 'Captain', 'very', 'well', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'USS', 'Poseidon-Phantom', 'Below', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'gay', 'element', 'movie', 'commander', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'best', 'friend', 'tragic', 'accident', 'felt', 'responsibility', 'captain', 'was', 'only', 'message', 'got', 'movie', 'was', 'edited', 'origional', 'Tides', 'War', 'rate', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'phantom', 'submarine', 'hunted', 'overall', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'well', 'what', 'paid', 'used']",N/A

947194,AJ1XZYGXJGKU4,B000BPCCGY,Stephen C. Coyle,"[2, 2]",Remember back in high school when students put on a play and all the students delivered their lines without any feeling or emotion? This movie is just like that.Also certain aspects of the story just make no sense. For instance some people in the Navy (like the submarine's new executive officer) do everything in their power to keep Commander Habley from proving that there really is a North Korean sub out there with stealth technology. Why do they go to such extreme lengths to keep this stealth sub a secret? Their actions are never explained.
