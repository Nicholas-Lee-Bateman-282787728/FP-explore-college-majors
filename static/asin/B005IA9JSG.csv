I so wish they would have done some movies along the way to show how the gang continued on....hopefully happily ever afters with Ross and Rachel, Monica and Chandler and family, Phoebe and Mike.  At least we did get another year and a half of Joey....still not enough.  I don't think I could ever get enough of these characters.  Very enjoyable from writing to main characters, to friends of friends, love them all.",5,"Love it except like most fans, sorry to see it end.",1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,506,"['Sorry', 'see', 'end', 'did', 'tie', 'up', 'young', 'people', 'adulthood', 'pretty', 'nicely', 'so', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'movies', 'way', 'show', 'how', 'gang', 'continued', '.hopefully', 'happily', 'ever', 'afters', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'family', 'Phoebe', 'Mike', 'least', 'did', 'get', 'year', 'half', 'Joey', 'not', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'enough', 'characters', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'writing', 'main', 'characters', 'friends', 'friends', 'love']",Friends: The Complete Ninth and Tenth Seasons

I would recommend to go with the separate packaging, instead of the full package deal. This way is a lot cheaper.

Often the repeats do not have the entire show, to afford more commercials to air.But if you enjoyed the series, you'll love the bonus features, especially the gag reels, usually on the final DVD of the season, along with several fun games.",5,building a library,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,451,"['liked', 'series', 'was', 'airing', 'network', 'television', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'repeats', 'several', 'television', 'channels', 'highlights', 'owning', 'DVDs', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'entire', 'episode', 'repeats', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'entire', 'show', 'afford', 'more', 'commercials', 'air.But', 'enjoyed', 'series', ""'ll"", 'love', 'bonus', 'features', 'especially', 'gag', 'reels', 'usually', 'final', 'DVD', 'season', 'several', 'fun', 'games']",Friends: The Complete Ninth and Tenth Seasons

For anyone who has ever been part of a group of tight knit friends....this series is a well written, well acted reminder of the ups and downs, ins and outs, triumphs and tragedies, pain and pleasure of that dynamic.  It is a series that stands the test of time and will entertain you and fill your heart over and over as you continue to enjoy its life like quirkiness.",5,Friends: The Ninth and Tenth Seasons,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,507,"['completed', 'series', 'collection', 'humble', 'opinion', '34', 'Friends', '34', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'television', 'comedy', 'series', 'ever', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'part', 'group', 'tight', 'knit', 'friends', '.this', 'series', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'reminder', 'ups', 'downs', 'ins', 'outs', 'triumphs', 'tragedies', 'pain', 'pleasure', 'dynamic', 'series', 'test', 'time', 'will', 'entertain', 'fill', 'heart', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'life', 'quirkiness']",Friends: The Complete Ninth and Tenth Seasons
