971360,A29BBGTRC3CRXX,B000EBGEA0,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This video has episodes with both Joe and Steve.  My son is 18 months old and loves Blues Clues.  He doesn't seem to have a preference when it comes to Joe or Steve so it's great to see both of them on this one.  The episodes are about a bunch of different jobs, Blue going to the doctor for a check up, playing mechanic, and playing store.  So a lot of options on this!  Great purchase!",5,Great DvD,1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,387,"['video', 'episodes', 'Joe', 'Steve', 'son', '18', 'months', 'old', 'Blues', 'Clues', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'preference', 'when', 'Joe', 'Steve', 'great', 'see', 'one', 'episodes', 'are', 'bunch', 'different', 'jobs', 'Blue', 'going', 'doctor', 'check', 'up', 'playing', 'mechanic', 'playing', 'store', 'lot', 'options', 'Great', 'purchase']",N/A

971362,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000EBGEA0,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[55, 55]","""Blue's Jobs"" is a 10th anniversary DVD release. While, like other ""Blue's Clues"" DVDs, it doesn't contain any special features (other than promos), it does contain four great episodes from the show. For those who don't like ""Blue's Room"" --- take heart, all of the episodes on this DVD are from before ""Blue's Room"" segments were added to the show. This DVD also has no episodes with talking-and-singing clues. And for those who don't like Joe (I personally do), two of the episodes feature Steve.The episodes on the DVD are:""Occupations""This a Steve episode. In this episode, Steve pretends to be a news reporter, while and the viewers play Blue's Clues to figure out what occupation Blue wants to pretend to be. An absolute classic. That's the news, now everyone knows.""Blue Goes to the Doctor""Blue's checkup at the doctor was recently ranked one of the show's ten biggest moments on Nick Jr. Now you can see it for yourself. Some viewers were very pleased that this episode broke a stereotype by featuring a female doctor. This is a Joe episode.""Mechanics""In this episode, the viewers and the characters get to pretend to be mechanics. A nice Steve episode.""Playing Store""In this episode, the characters have all set up various stores. The characters and viewers learn about buying and selling in this Joe episode.All episodes generally seem to fit the theme very nicely. The promos on the DVD include a look at the upcoming Backyardigans release, ""Mission to Mars.""",4,Another Nice Set of Episodes,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,1470,"['Blue', 'Jobs', '10th', 'anniversary', 'DVD', 'release', 'other', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'contain', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'promos', 'contain', 'four', 'great', 'episodes', 'show', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Blue', 'Room', 'take', 'heart', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'Blue', 'Room', 'segments', 'were', 'added', 'show', 'DVD', 'also', 'episodes', 'talking-and-singing', 'clues', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Joe', 'personally', 'do', 'two', 'episodes', 'feature', 'Steve.The', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'Occupations', 'Steve', 'episode', 'episode', 'Steve', 'be', 'news', 'reporter', 'viewers', 'play', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'occupation', 'Blue', 'pretend', 'be', 'absolute', 'classic', 'news', 'now', 'everyone', 'Blue', 'Goes', 'Doctor', 'Blue', 'checkup', 'doctor', 'was', 'recently', 'ranked', 'one', 'show', 'ten', 'biggest', 'moments', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'Now', 'can', 'see', 'viewers', 'were', 'very', 'pleased', 'episode', 'broke', 'stereotype', 'featuring', 'female', 'doctor', 'Joe', 'episode', 'Mechanics', 'episode', 'viewers', 'characters', 'get', 'pretend', 'be', 'mechanics', 'nice', 'Steve', 'episode', 'Playing', 'Store', 'episode', 'characters', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'various', 'stores', 'characters', 'viewers', 'learn', 'buying', 'selling', 'Joe', 'episode.All', 'generally', 'seem', 'fit', 'theme', 'very', 'nicely', 'promos', 'DVD', 'include', 'look', 'upcoming', 'Backyardigans', 'release', 'Mission', 'Mars']",N/A
