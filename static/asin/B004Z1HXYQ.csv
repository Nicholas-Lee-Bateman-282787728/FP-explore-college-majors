I guess since it was filmed at a higher resolution for IMAX, which makes sense, but you really need to see it to believe it. I've met Jewel backstage at one of her shows and enjoyed the concert as well, and this Blu-ray does a nice job of replicating her concerts for someone who wants to see her in the comfort of their own home. Highly, highly recommend this title to those with a Blu-ray player and HDTV.",5,WOW!

Gregory""","[2, 2]","In today's over-the-top spectacles that accompany hit albums (whether there is real talent involved or not) Jewel's performance might even seem sedate. But there is so much power and emotion behind her vocals that it doesn't matter. This isn't a sideshow, this isn't a carnival or lightshow, this is simply great music and great vocals presented in it's best possible way. It looks and sounds great on blu ray. And there is a lot here to enjoy, two concerts as well as  a few additional live numbers (and one music video). The interview is a bit on the short side (about 9 minutes) so it's a bit too short to be of much significance, though it's still a joy to watch. However the way it's conducted leads one to think maybe this was more a rehearsed interview as her answers seem more thought out and detailed, than they would have had it been more spontaneous. The visuals are great and Jewel is very beautiful so it's fun to watch her run through the songs, as it is easy to be captivated by her performance. The emotions of each song shines through as if this was her first time ever singing these songs, and of course there is the power of her vocals that I had mentioned before. The interplay between her and her audience is also a treat to watch. As she is first and foremost a folk artist the storytelling behind the songs is just as engaging as the songs themselves. Jim Croce was also great to listen to between songs. It was great to hear her sing some of the more well-known radio hits with a slight vocal twist, it added to the overall flavor of the original (while keeping her from getting bored with these older songs as well). Anyone who is a fan of folk/rock singing/storytelling and anyone who favors live music over lip synched spectacles owe themselves to give this a listen. Even on the songs that I am not a fan of it's so enthralling to see her put so much of herself into it. She has a great voice, and looks great on film, and this blu ray showcases all of her talents and then some. Definitely worth the price to add this in your collection.",5,Essential and Enjoyable,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,2066,"['today', 'over-the-top', 'spectacles', 'accompany', 'hit', 'albums', 'real', 'talent', 'involved', 'not', 'Jewel', 'performance', 'might', 'even', 'seem', 'sedate', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'emotion', 'vocals', ""n't"", 'matter', ""n't"", 'sideshow', ""n't"", 'carnival', 'lightshow', 'simply', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'vocals', 'presented', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'great', 'blu', 'ray', 'lot', 'here', 'enjoy', 'two', 'concerts', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'additional', 'live', 'numbers', 'one', 'music', 'video', 'interview', 'bit', 'short', 'side', '9', 'minutes', 'bit', 'too', 'short', 'be', 'much', 'significance', 'still', 'joy', 'watch', 'However', 'way', 'conducted', 'one', 'think', 'maybe', 'was', 'more', 'rehearsed', 'interview', 'answers', 'seem', 'more', 'thought', 'out', 'detailed', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'spontaneous', 'visuals', 'are', 'great', 'Jewel', 'very', 'beautiful', 'fun', 'watch', 'run', 'songs', 'easy', 'be', 'captivated', 'performance', 'emotions', 'song', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'singing', 'songs', 'course', 'power', 'vocals', 'had', 'mentioned', 'before', 'interplay', 'audience', 'also', 'treat', 'watch', 'first', 'foremost', 'folk', 'artist', 'storytelling', 'songs', 'just', 'as', 'engaging', 'songs', 'Jim', 'Croce', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'listen', 'songs', 'was', 'great', 'hear', 'sing', 'more', 'well-known', 'radio', 'hits', 'slight', 'vocal', 'twist', 'added', 'overall', 'flavor', 'original', 'keeping', 'getting', 'bored', 'older', 'songs', 'well', 'Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'folk/rock', 'singing/storytelling', 'anyone', 'who', 'live', 'music', 'lip', 'synched', 'spectacles', 'owe', 'give', 'listen', 'Even', 'songs', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'so', 'enthralling', 'see', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'voice', 'great', 'film', 'blu', 'ray', 'talents', 'then', 'Definitely', 'price', 'add', 'collection']",Jewel: The Essential Live Songbook

1434020,A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ,B004Z1HXYQ,Peter Tsang,"[24, 24]","The blu-ray itself is excellent and has two concerts on it, for which it gets five stars.  In general, the concerts seem to have a folksy/bluesy/storytelling flavor with perhaps a tiny hint of country, in a unique and hard to define Jewel style, which is somewhat different than her ""pop"" like radio songs.  The second concert has eight songs accompanied by an orchestra so those songs have a classical flavor to them.Let me give you a sampling of some of the songs from the second concert.  Jewel carefully strums her guitar on ""Foolish Games"" and ""You Were Meant For Me"".  She and the orchestra perform ""I'm Sensitive"" and ""Hands""; both are beautifully rendered with strings and air instruments and ""Hands"" is especially heavenly with the plucking of the harp.  Jewel almost seems to be scatting on ""Who Will Save Your Soul"".  She sings the aria ""Per La Gloria D'Adorarvi"".  And on ""Yodel,"" she belts out her Swiss yodeling.Jewel only had two albums released.  So you may only know a few hit songs from the radio.  Most of the other songs may not be familiar to most people.But be careful, and be aware that this blu-ray is actually a re-release of an earlier blu-ray.  The covers are exactly the same on both the older and the newer releases, with the same picture of Jewel.  The difference is that the older one came with an extra cardboard cover that fits over the plastic blu-ray case;  the newer one has just the plastic blu-ray case.  But again, both the newer release and the older release are exactly the same, with the same two concerts.There is one more difference, actually for the better.  The older release has two discs, with one concert on each disc.  The newer release contains both concerts on one disc so it is more convenient.The price is quite a bit lower on this re-release; so by all means, if you like  Jewel, get this blu-ray.",5,A re-release,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,1852,"['blu-ray', 'excellent', 'two', 'concerts', 'five', 'stars', 'general', 'concerts', 'seem', 'have', 'folksy/bluesy/storytelling', 'flavor', 'perhaps', 'tiny', 'hint', 'country', 'unique', 'hard', 'define', 'Jewel', 'style', 'somewhat', 'different', 'pop', 'radio', 'songs', 'second', 'concert', 'eight', 'songs', 'accompanied', 'orchestra', 'so', 'songs', 'have', 'classical', 'flavor', 'them.Let', 'give', 'sampling', 'songs', 'second', 'concert', 'Jewel', 'carefully', 'strums', 'guitar', 'Foolish', 'Games', 'Were', 'Meant', 'Me', 'orchestra', 'perform', ""'m"", 'Sensitive', 'Hands', 'are', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'strings', 'air', 'instruments', 'Hands', 'especially', 'heavenly', 'plucking', 'harp', 'Jewel', 'almost', 'be', 'scatting', 'Who', 'Will', 'Save', 'Soul', 'sings', 'aria', 'Per', 'La', 'Gloria', ""D'Adorarvi"", 'Yodel', 'belts', 'out', 'Swiss', 'yodeling.Jewel', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'albums', 'released', 'may', 'only', 'know', 'few', 'hit', 'songs', 'radio', 'Most', 'other', 'songs', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'most', 'people.But', 'be', 'careful', 'be', 'aware', 'blu-ray', 'actually', 're-release', 'earlier', 'blu-ray', 'covers', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'older', 'newer', 'releases', 'same', 'picture', 'Jewel', 'difference', 'older', 'one', 'came', 'extra', 'cardboard', 'cover', 'plastic', 'blu-ray', 'case', 'newer', 'one', 'just', 'plastic', 'blu-ray', 'case', 'again', 'newer', 'release', 'older', 'release', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'same', 'two', 'one', 'more', 'difference', 'actually', 'better', 'older', 'release', 'two', 'discs', 'one', 'concert', 'disc', 'newer', 'release', 'concerts', 'one', 'disc', 'more', 'convenient.The', 'price', 'quite', 'bit', 'lower', 're-release', 'means', 'like', 'Jewel', 'get', 'blu-ray']",Jewel: The Essential Live Songbook
