1601871,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B009SLANLI,Amit Talpade,"[5, 5]","Paresh Rawal( Kanji Bhai) is a sharp businessman who unfortunately loses his place of business in an earthquake. The insurance company refuses to settle his claim stating that this was an act of God thus can&#8217;t be covered by insurance. Desperate, Kanji decides to file a case against God and the insurance company and thereby enraging his community and holy men. OMG raises hell and how&#8230;..This film is based on the Gujarati play, Kanji Viruddh Kanji, which was made in Hindi as Krishan versus Kanhaiya. As the film unfolds, Kanji confronts the holy god men who he thinks are the collection agents for God and the temples serving as places of business. Lord Krishna (Akshay Kumar) decides to step in and do something about the mess that has engulfed Kanji.Akshay Kumar as Krishna Vasudev Yadav is amazing as the modern incarnate of the playful God. Akshay needs to applauded for standing on the sidelines and let the other actors take over in a film which was produced by him. Almost all of the Godmen are fashioned on their real life couterparts, Govind Namdeo as the bald religious preacher is evil and full of double standards. Mithun Chakraborty is the effeminate spiritual guru that leads the band of holy leaders. The female holy woman is played by Poonam Jhaver. Paresh Rawal steals the show and runs with it briliiantly, he gets to deliver some of the best lines of 2012- Yeh log mujhe (Bhagavad) Gita sikhayenge? In logon ki IQ bhi room temperature se low hai.' The actor shows remarkable acting and it is heartening to see that Paresh Rawal getting more camera time than Akshay Kumar.A great fim and could easily be one of the best films of 2012.

1601875,A1TUUFVEW3O5PX,B009SLANLI,"Steve Kohn ""usarmycwo""","[0, 1]","After watching the movie, you'll agree it should have been titled ""Act of God."" That was already taken but, actually, so was ""Oh My God."" Ah well, whatever it's called, it's an enjoyable couple hours.I wish I could endorse it more enthusiastically, but the film has some fundamental flaws that keep it from getting a 5-star rating for me.Still, no doubt at all that it's entertaining. It has beautiful women (Miss Americas everywhere you look), clever dialogue, plenty of humor, and a Bollywood song/dance that has no bearing on the movie but will produce colors on our HDTV with a vibrancy we've never seen before.The movie is about a shopkeeper whose insurance company won't pay a claim, saying the damage was caused by an ""act of God."" So he sues. During the trial he's his own lawyer, and a fine one, too.In court he skewers organized religion (actually, just Hinduism; Islam and Christianity are hardly mentioned). His case is helped by the appearance of God. Yes, Krishna himself in human form.So the movie will probably offend both religious and atheist alike. Fortunately, I'm neither, so was able to sit back and enjoy.
