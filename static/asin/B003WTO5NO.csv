1369667,AP3XMO9BZLKQY,B003WTO5NO,gooniemcfly,"[18, 19]","This is a great double feature containing the first two Howling movies. It contains The Howling with the same special features that are on the single special edition disc that was released in 2003. It has a couple ""making of"" features along with an director and cast audio commentary. It is presented in both widescreen and fullscreen. It is a double-sided disc with the movie on one side and the special features on the other side. The Howling 2 is on a separate double-sided disc with a widescreen presentation on Side A and fullscreen presentation on Side B. Like the earlier single-disc release it has no special features. Both movies played great. The Howling is a classic. The second one is not well-regarded by fans and critics but I really like it. It is great to see Christopher Lee being a sport and starring in the second movie. There is only one little downside to this double feature. There is a separate disc holder and since The Howling 2 is double-sided the holder scratches the second disc. But even with all the scratches The Howling 2 disc plays great. So if you don't already have the first two Howlings and given that you like them you basically get two movies for the price of one.",5,This Is A Great Set For Those Who Don't Already Own The First Two Seperately,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1203,"['great', 'double', 'feature', 'containing', 'first', 'two', 'Howling', 'movies', 'Howling', 'same', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'single', 'special', 'edition', 'disc', 'was', 'released', '2003', 'couple', 'making', 'features', 'director', 'cast', 'audio', 'commentary', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'double-sided', 'disc', 'movie', 'one', 'side', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'side', 'Howling', '2', 'separate', 'double-sided', 'disc', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'Side', 'A', 'fullscreen', 'presentation', 'Side', 'B', 'earlier', 'single-disc', 'release', 'special', 'features', 'movies', 'played', 'great', 'Howling', 'classic', 'second', 'one', 'not', 'well-regarded', 'fans', 'critics', 'really', 'great', 'see', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'being', 'sport', 'starring', 'second', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'little', 'downside', 'double', 'feature', 'separate', 'disc', 'holder', 'Howling', '2', 'double-sided', 'holder', 'second', 'disc', 'even', 'scratches', 'Howling', '2', 'disc', 'plays', 'great', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'first', 'two', 'Howlings', 'given', 'like', 'basically', 'get', 'two', 'movies', 'price', 'one']",N/A

The production values are pretty high and given the time period the make up and such is above par. The plot is pretty good and special effects work just fine. I think it is a good horror movie and will watch it a couple of times a year.'Howling II' is a different matter. Look, I like movies so bad they are 'good' but I have to admit that this one is hard to take. It has all the appearance of a porno movie at times. I'm not sure who they folks are that made or appear in this, but somehow they talked Christopher Lee into appearing in it and it is a mid-career appearance of Sybil Danning, a Queen of B movies.The production values are god-awful and the script seems, at times, to have been written by a bunch of high-school stoners.I'll watch it again and see if I can get any enjoyment out of it being so bad; but the first time I tried I had to shut it off.However the packaging of 'Howling 1 and 2' is a great idea for cheap access.",4,Some Good News And Some Bad News,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,994,"[""'Howling"", 'pretty', 'good', 'creature-feature', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'pretty', 'high', 'given', 'time', 'period', 'make', 'up', 'such', 'par', 'plot', 'pretty', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'just', 'fine', 'think', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'couple', 'times', 'year', ""'Howling"", 'II', 'different', 'matter', 'Look', 'like', 'movies', 'so', 'bad', 'are', ""'good"", 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'hard', 'take', 'appearance', 'porno', 'movie', 'times', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'folks', 'are', 'made', 'appear', 'somehow', 'talked', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'appearing', 'mid-career', 'appearance', 'Sybil', 'Danning', 'Queen', 'B', 'movies.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'god-awful', 'script', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'bunch', 'high-school', 'stoners.I', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'being', 'so', 'bad', 'first', 'time', 'tried', 'had', 'shut', 'off.However', 'packaging', ""'Howling"", '1', '2', 'great', 'idea', 'cheap', 'access']",N/A
