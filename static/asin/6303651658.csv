384193,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6303651658,Douglas Doepke,"[5, 8]","Hollywood has had a long tradition of dumb blonde performers who could be counted on to produce more than their share of belly-laughs. None, however, was more expert at the trade than Judy Holiday whose untimely death robbed filmdom of one of its most accomplished comediennes. This movie, along with Born Yesterday, is among her very best, and should not be missed.Film fans may want to note that there's a direct line of descent from Holiday in this movie to Reese Witherspoon in the recent megahit Legally Blonde. Like Witherspoon's character in Blonde, everyone underestimates Holiday's Laura Partridge and with similarly devastating results. In both cases, it's that sweetly scatterbrained exterior that  conceals a shrewd and determined inner woman, a combination which proves deadly for those who would happily exploit them. Here, it's the Board of a soulless corporation ( just then emerging from the 50's decade of growth) that falls into Holiday's trap with hilarious results. The Board itself is a stellar lineup of character actors: from the curmudgeonly Fred Clark, to the cultured John Williams, to the scheming Ray Collins, all familiar faces from the Late Late Show and pompously perfect targets for a womanly comeuppance. Holiday's pixilated exchanges with these smugly officious scofflaws are minor gems.Those interested in charting the rise of the women's movement might also note an important contrast between the two films. Holiday's character, for all her wiles and willpower, must eventually succumb in typical 50's fashion to her stronger male half as played by the always redoubtable Paul Douglas. On the other hand, Witherspoon's post-Gloria Steinam character discovers a hidden self-sufficiency that requires no Douglas counterpart, producing a typically 90's note of feminist triumph. But these are merely incidental reflections on an underrated movie that truly sparkles because of the comedic lustre of its star, the unforgettable Judy Holiday, in a role that suits her to the proverbial T.",5,A Holiday Showcase,1059350400,"07 28, 2003",2003,2020,"['Hollywood', 'had', 'long', 'tradition', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'performers', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'counted', 'produce', 'more', 'share', 'belly-laughs', 'None', 'however', 'was', 'more', 'expert', 'trade', 'Judy', 'Holiday', 'untimely', 'death', 'robbed', 'filmdom', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'comediennes', 'movie', 'Born', 'Yesterday', 'very', 'best', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Film', 'fans', 'may', 'want', 'note', 'direct', 'line', 'descent', 'Holiday', 'movie', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'recent', 'megahit', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'Witherspoon', 'character', 'Blonde', 'everyone', 'underestimates', 'Holiday', 'Laura', 'Partridge', 'similarly', 'devastating', 'results', 'cases', 'sweetly', 'scatterbrained', 'exterior', 'shrewd', 'determined', 'inner', 'woman', 'combination', 'deadly', 'who', 'would', 'happily', 'exploit', 'Here', 'Board', 'soulless', 'corporation', 'just', 'then', 'emerging', '50', 'decade', 'growth', 'Holiday', 'trap', 'hilarious', 'results', 'Board', 'stellar', 'lineup', 'character', 'actors', 'curmudgeonly', 'Fred', 'Clark', 'cultured', 'John', 'Williams', 'scheming', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'familiar', 'Late', 'Late', 'Show', 'pompously', 'perfect', 'targets', 'womanly', 'comeuppance', 'Holiday', 'pixilated', 'exchanges', 'smugly', 'officious', 'scofflaws', 'are', 'minor', 'gems.Those', 'interested', 'charting', 'rise', 'women', 'movement', 'might', 'also', 'note', 'important', 'contrast', 'two', 'films', 'Holiday', 'character', 'wiles', 'willpower', 'must', 'eventually', 'succumb', 'typical', '50', 'fashion', 'stronger', 'male', 'half', 'played', 'always', 'redoubtable', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'other', 'hand', 'Witherspoon', 'post-Gloria', 'Steinam', 'character', 'hidden', 'self-sufficiency', 'Douglas', 'counterpart', 'producing', 'typically', '90', 'note', 'feminist', 'triumph', 'are', 'merely', 'incidental', 'reflections', 'underrated', 'movie', 'truly', 'sparkles', 'comedic', 'lustre', 'star', 'unforgettable', 'Judy', 'Holiday', 'role', 'suits', 'proverbial', 'T']",Solid Gold Cadillac VHS

Judy Holliday (as ""Laura Partridge"") attends a stockholder's meeting.  The meeting goes by too routinely.  They almost neglect to see the waving hand of Miss Holliday.  Naturally being a stockholder herself, she has a question to ask, before they vote for Treasurer. She does ask some very simple, honest questions, but these white-collar showboats just can't give her an honest answer without the push-off or feeding their face.  Well, this smart blonde woman makes a motion and since she does own 10 shares, she would like to form a stockholders committee of her own to discuss the ""too big"" salaries of the showboats.  She does get involved and this woman will make some unselfish changes.  Watch the business and the fun begin.

384197,A3BU6QT97HMF,6303651658,Joseph Hart,"[5, 9]","To begin with, I wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol!  That said, this is a rare case (the 1st of its kind?) of a movie being better than the play it was based on.  The general framework was of course the same, but in the play Judy Holliday's part was taken by Josephine Hull, a very funny little old lady (who also scored both on Bway and on the screen in ""Harvey"" and ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" to name the only 2 that I know of), and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges, it blossomed in the film.  One problem, there simply were no witty lines, either in the play or the movie.  This is odd for Kaufman (though the play was produced in 1953, very late in his career), but about par for Burrows (early in his career).  But still it was clever and interesting, the play had more structure than the movie (typical of Kaufman), but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play, which surprised me very much and made me wonder about Kaufman.  Also the flick left out all the naughty words which I'm sure Hull barked out with delicious abandon!  (Note:  Kaufman co-wrote the play, Burrows adapted it for the screen.)  This I think was more a sit-com than an actually witty Kaufman comedy.  And finally, Judy Holliday did NOT play a ""dumb blonde""!  She only did that in ""Born Yesterday.""",4,Almost Solid Gold,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1398,"['begin', 'wish', 'so-called', 'reviewers', 'would', 'stop', 'giving', 'away', 'plots', 'movies', 'extol', 'said', 'rare', 'case', '1st', 'kind', 'movie', 'being', 'better', 'play', 'was', 'based', 'general', 'framework', 'was', 'course', 'same', 'play', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'part', 'was', 'taken', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'very', 'funny', 'little', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'also', 'scored', 'Bway', 'screen', 'Harvey', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', 'name', 'only', '2', 'know', 'love', 'interest', 'stage', 'was', 'only', 'hinted', 'edges', 'blossomed', 'film', 'One', 'problem', 'simply', 'were', 'witty', 'lines', 'either', 'play', 'movie', 'odd', 'Kaufman', 'play', 'was', 'produced', '1953', 'very', 'late', 'career', 'par', 'Burrows', 'early', 'career', 'still', 'was', 'clever', 'interesting', 'play', 'had', 'more', 'structure', 'movie', 'typical', 'Kaufman', 'movie', 'did', 'things', 'plot', 'were', 'suggested', 'left', 'undone', 'play', 'surprised', 'very', 'much', 'made', 'wonder', 'Kaufman', 'Also', 'flick', 'left', 'out', 'naughty', 'words', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Hull', 'barked', 'out', 'delicious', 'abandon', 'Note', 'Kaufman', 'co-wrote', 'play', 'Burrows', 'adapted', 'screen', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'sit-com', 'actually', 'witty', 'Kaufman', 'comedy', 'finally', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'did', 'NOT', 'play', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'only', 'did', 'Born', 'Yesterday']",Solid Gold Cadillac VHS

Hickey,"[6, 6]","I saw this film this week with a theater audience, who were completely engaged as a group with the plot points because of the charming performances.  The comedic range of Judy Holliday in this film is astonishing, and she is giftwrapped for viewers' full appreciation by period fashions of 1956.  There is an immediate smile as Holliday and Paul Douglas head for the lunch counter at Schrafts, Douglas is warned that a bridge toll will cost him twenty-five cents, and the steno pool uses the latest in Smith Corona typewriters.  The entire cast works well together with material that was naughty on Broadway half a century ago during the Eisenhower years, wringing the naughtiness out for us with subtly knowing leers.Of particular interest to me was watching Ray Collins shortly before he immortalized Lt. Tragg on the b&w; PERRY MASON and a dozen years after he played the political foil to Welles's Kane.

384202,A27M15DFUPV1CK,6303651658,peterfromkanata,"[47, 47]","Although older film buffs remember her fondly, I suspect that Judy Holliday is not as familiar to classic cinema fans today as she should be. She was a beautiful, charming actress who sparkled in comedy roles. While her career took off in the late 40s, it was during the 50s that she made her most famous films, although the number of movies were relatively few. She was caught up in the communist witch-hunts of the 50s, which--to Hollywood's disgrace--had an impact on her film career, and the number of quality roles offered. She was not the only victim during those dark days. By the 60s, she was seriously ill, and succumbed to breast cancer, at age 44.""The Solid Gold Cadillac"" gave Ms. Holliday one of her best roles. As a minor shareholder in a major company, her character asks some simple, but pointed questions at a stock-holders' meeting that lead to various complications for a very greedy, dishonest and unethical Board of Directors, played by John Williams ( smarmy and unscrupulous ), Fred Clark ( a two-faced bully ) and Ray Collins ( indignant and crooked ). She also becomes involved with the founder of the company, played by Paul Douglas, a decent man with too much integrity for those sharks on the Board. The whole cast is excellent, and the plot is consistently amusing.I found the main theme of this film to be just as relevant today. We are living in an era of high-profile corporate scandal ( eg. Enron, Hollinger, the list goes on and on ). When these situations are investigated, what is found at the bottom ? Nothing but pure, unadulterated greed. The more things change, etc. Actually, I could see ""The Solid Gold Cadillac"" being updated today--technology has changed, the ""numbers"" are a lot bigger--but good old-fashioned greed is still around, big-time ! I could see one of our current actresses, with a flair for comedy, having a big hit with this ""remake"".
