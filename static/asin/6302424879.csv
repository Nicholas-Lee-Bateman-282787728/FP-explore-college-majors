The movie recounts Winston Churchhill's life before he entered politics, and boy what a life he led before his 25th birthday! If Winston had never entered politics, he would still have gone down in history as a noted soldier/writer.Winston saw it all. He was there in the 1897 punitive expidition on the northwest frontier of India when the area went up in flames. He was there too in 1898 in the Sudan when the Viceroy of India, Lord Herbert Kitchener, decided to take back Khartoum from the Mahdi forces, who 13 years earlier had taken Khartoum and killed General Gordon. During this campaign, Winston took part in the last charge of British cavalry! He was there in the Boer War (1899-1901). While helping British soldiers retreat from a Boer commando trap, Winston was captured, but subsequently escaped. Unknown to Winston during the time he was running from the Boers, his escape had turned him into a world celebrity. All the papers from America to Europe were speculating as to the fate of the young Winston. Those papers on the British side of the war were hoping his escape was successful, while those who favored the Boers were hoping for his re-capture. After three weeks on the run, Winston crossed into East-Portuguese territory and FREEDOM!

311890,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302424879,Dr. James Gardner,"[4, 5]","Winston Churchill was one of the giants of the 20th Century and a personal hero of mine, so I look forward to any coverage of his life. ""Young Winston"" is an excellent departure from the blood and guts bio pics that tell us how Churchill saved the world in the 40s, so on this point alone the film gets high marks. But beyond merely giving us so much of Churchill's story that we were not acquainted with, the film has some great performances, notably from Robert Shaw as Winston's father and Simon Ward as Young Winston.Robert Shaw (1927-78) is known for many fine performances, from his Oscar nominated role as Henry VIII in ""A Man for All Seasons"" (1966) to his mega hits in ""From Russia with Love"" (1963), ""The Sting"" (1973) and ""Jaws"" (1975). Despite these great performances, I think his role in this film is his best performance ever.This was Simon Ward's (1941) third film and his best. He appeared in about a dozen more films, most of them forgettable, and then retired in 1992. Ward's performance is excellent. He seems to grow into the role, and by the time the film ends, we are looking at the Winston Churchill that we came to know.Anne Bancroft (1931-2005) appears as Winston's mother. Young Winston was only a few years following ""The Graduate"" (1966) yet Bancroft looks a decade younger. She had a distinguished career with an Oscar in 1962 for ""The Miracle Worker"" and a Golden Globe in 1964 for ""The Pumpkin Eater"" and 1967 for ""The Graduate."" Her performance in Young Winston earned her a well deserved BAFTA best actress nomination.The film has a basket of English actors from Jack Hawkins, Anthony Hopkins, Patrick Magee, Edward Woodward, John Mills and Ian Holm. Each puts in their limited screen time and does an admirable job, but no one is on screen long enough to make much of an impression.The film is directed by Richard Attenborough (1923). Better known for his work as an actor (""The Great Escape"", ""The Sand Pebbles"", ""Jurassic Park""), his work as a director has won him a DGA and an Oscar (""Gandhi"") and a BAFTA (""Shadowlands""). This film was his second as a director.FWIW - Attenborough and Anthony Hopkins got along so well in this film that they made 4 more together including ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Chaplin"", and ""Shadowlands"".Carl Foreman (1914-84) wrote the screenplay. Foreman was nominated 6 times for an Oscar and won once (""The Bridge at the River Kwai""). He won WGA awards for ""High Noon"" (1952) and ""The Men"" (1950). Foreman also wrote ""The Guns of Navarone"" (1961) which so enchanted Churchill that he asked him to work on this film.The top grossing films in 1972 included the terrific western ""Jeremiah Johnson"" along with ""The Godfather"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"", ""Cabaret"", ""Deliverance"", and ""The Getaway"". The big Oscar winners were ""The Godfather"" (Picture, Actor) and ""Cabaret"" (Director, Actress, Supporting Actor). Other memorable films from that year included ""The Candidate"", ""Last Tango in Paris"", ""The Ruling Class"", ""Way of the Dragon"",  and ""Pink Flamingoes"".The film was nominated for 3 Oscars (Screenplay, Art, Costume). It won a BAFTA for Costume and was nominated for Actor (Robert Shaw), Actress (Anne Bancroft), Art (Geoffrey Drake), and Best Newcomer (Simon Ward). It won the Golden Globe as Best English Language Foreign Film and Carl Foreman won a British Writer's Guild award for the screenplay.This film will appeal to fans of British films and biographies, and to anyone interested in the historical account of one of the 20th Century's greatest men.",4,Rare look at Churchill's early years,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,3521,"['Winston', 'Churchill', 'was', 'one', 'giants', '20th', 'Century', 'personal', 'hero', 'mine', 'look', 'forward', 'coverage', 'life', 'Young', 'Winston', 'excellent', 'departure', 'blood', 'guts', 'bio', 'pics', 'tell', 'how', 'Churchill', 'saved', 'world', '40s', 'so', 'point', 'alone', 'film', 'high', 'marks', 'merely', 'giving', 'so', 'much', 'Churchill', 'story', 'were', 'not', 'acquainted', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'notably', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'Winston', 'father', 'Simon', 'Ward', 'Young', 'Winston.Robert', 'Shaw', '1927-78', 'known', 'many', 'fine', 'performances', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'role', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'A', 'Man', 'Seasons', '1966', 'mega', 'hits', 'Russia', 'Love', '1963', 'Sting', '1973', 'Jaws', '1975', 'great', 'performances', 'think', 'role', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'ever.This', 'was', 'Simon', 'Ward', '1941', 'third', 'film', 'best', 'appeared', 'dozen', 'more', 'films', 'most', 'forgettable', 'then', 'retired', '1992', 'Ward', 'performance', 'excellent', 'grow', 'role', 'time', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'came', 'know.Anne', 'Bancroft', '1931-2005', 'Winston', 'mother', 'Young', 'Winston', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'following', 'Graduate', '1966', 'yet', 'Bancroft', 'decade', 'younger', 'had', 'distinguished', 'career', 'Oscar', '1962', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'Golden', 'Globe', '1964', 'Pumpkin', 'Eater', '1967', 'Graduate', 'performance', 'Young', 'Winston', 'earned', 'well', 'deserved', 'BAFTA', 'best', 'actress', 'nomination.The', 'film', 'basket', 'English', 'actors', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'John', 'Mills', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'puts', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'admirable', 'job', 'one', 'screen', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'much', 'impression.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', '1923', 'Better', 'known', 'work', 'actor', 'Great', 'Escape', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'work', 'director', 'won', 'DGA', 'Oscar', 'Gandhi', 'BAFTA', 'Shadowlands', 'film', 'was', 'second', 'director.FWIW', 'Attenborough', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'got', 'along', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'made', '4', 'more', 'together', 'including', 'Bridge', 'Too', 'Far', 'Chaplin', 'Shadowlands', '.Carl', 'Foreman', '1914-84', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Foreman', 'was', 'nominated', '6', 'times', 'Oscar', 'won', 'once', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'won', 'WGA', 'awards', 'High', 'Noon', '1952', 'Men', '1950', 'Foreman', 'also', 'wrote', 'Guns', 'Navarone', '1961', 'so', 'enchanted', 'Churchill', 'asked', 'work', 'film.The', 'top', 'grossing', 'films', '1972', 'included', 'terrific', 'western', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'Godfather', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'Cabaret', 'Deliverance', 'Getaway', 'big', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'were', 'Godfather', 'Picture', 'Actor', 'Cabaret', 'Director', 'Actress', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Other', 'memorable', 'films', 'year', 'included', 'Candidate', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'Ruling', 'Class', 'Way', 'Dragon', 'Pink', 'Flamingoes', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', '3', 'Oscars', 'Screenplay', 'Art', 'Costume', 'won', 'BAFTA', 'Costume', 'was', 'nominated', 'Actor', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'Actress', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Art', 'Geoffrey', 'Drake', 'Best', 'Newcomer', 'Simon', 'Ward', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'English', 'Language', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'won', 'British', 'Writer', 'Guild', 'award', 'screenplay.This', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'British', 'films', 'biographies', 'anyone', 'interested', 'historical', 'account', 'one', '20th', 'Century', 'greatest', 'men']",Young Winston VHS

By all rights young Winston should have been an upper class twit or a hopeless depressive. Although born in a palace he had a childhood none of us would want. His parents were terrible as the movie plainly shows. Her father was a brilliant, complex man and is wonderfully portrayed by Robert Shaw (Quint from Jaws and Red Grant in From Russia with Love). On his good days Lord Churchill is a distant father, and a poor husband but Robert Shaw makes you care about him when he destroys his career and you pity him when his mind starts to decay.The late Anne Bancroft plays Jenny Churchill who although one of the most beautiful and charming women in England was a somewhat negelctful mother who didn't seem to pay attention to her son until he was grown and began to pull away from her.Then the movie goes from sad to funny to sad again. Teenaged Winston developes a brittle cocksureness that alienates quite a few people but is an effective cover and reaction to the crappy childhood he endured.Finally, after his father's death Winston ungergoes a Henry V-esque transformation.

G. Wodehouse might say.  It is particularly engaging in that every reader knows more about the brash young upstart at its center than did the middle-aged failure who wrote it.I have given the film just three stars because of this very faithfulness.  Alas, the film is paced like a book, not a movie.  What seems dazzling in the leisurely spaces of the 367-page 1949 edition is simply leaden when put on the screen with its quite different rhythm.By the way, WSC's father, Lord Randolph Churchill, died of syphilis, not of a tumor, as the film makes quite clear.",3,Faithful to its source (unfortunately),1070409600,"12 3, 2003",2003,881,"['film', 'quite', 'faithful', 'source', 'quot', 'Early', 'Life', 'quot', 'partial', 'autobiography', 'published', '1930', 'when', 'WSC', 'career', 'was', 'fully', 'dumpster', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'mere', 'divider', 'two', 'brilliant', 'Randolphs', 'father', 'son.The', 'book', 'crackling', 'read', 'full', 'old', 'umpity-oof', 'P.', 'G.', 'Wodehouse', 'might', 'say', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'reader', 'more', 'brash', 'young', 'upstart', 'center', 'did', 'middle-aged', 'failure', 'who', 'wrote', 'it.I', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'just', 'three', 'stars', 'very', 'faithfulness', 'Alas', 'film', 'paced', 'book', 'not', 'movie', 'What', 'dazzling', 'leisurely', 'spaces', '367-page', '1949', 'edition', 'simply', 'leaden', 'when', 'put', 'screen', 'quite', 'different', 'rhythm.By', 'way', 'WSC', 'father', 'Lord', 'Randolph', 'Churchill', 'died', 'syphilis', 'not', 'tumor', 'film', 'quite', 'clear']",Young Winston VHS

311901,A1VUA80DLZGWIP,6302424879,LT Sharpe,"[4, 14]",This film starts very strongly with action in the northwest frontier of India but then spends an hour concentrating on Winston's childhood and his ailing father.  About 1 hour after the initial battle we pick up his wartime exploits again in the Boer war where there are some exciting action scenes involving a train.  Then we see the story of Winston's escape out of Boer territory and finally the last 30 minutes or so  involve his political ambitions.  If it had just concentrated on his wartime experiences it would have been great.  The battle sequences they did do appeared very realistic and accurate.  The Sudan campaign is mentioned but we don't get to see it.

311902,A3KCMH49L6KTHM,6302424879,Moonfish,"[2, 2]","A very interesting dramatized introduction to Winston Churchill. I have been reading Churchill'sMy Early Life: 1874-1904simultaneously and it is clear that Attenborough very much followed the autobiography in his own creative fashion. The unique mixing of time is Attenborough stamp on the film. However, he is pretty accurate and often uses specific quotes from Churchill's book. I found the film enticing as an introduction to the time of the late 19th century (I actually showed my kids (9 and 11) the first half of the film) as well as to Churchill as a personality. I am now interested in reading more of Churchill (his early writings such asThe Story of the Malakand Field Force (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)) and to read about the times in Tuchman'sThe Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914.The photography, acting and writing were excellent. I very much recommend this film as an introduction to the times (upper class England in the 1890s) as well as an inroad to learning more about Winston Churchill. Highly recommended!PS!
