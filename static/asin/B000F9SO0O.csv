There were definitely comedic moments with that type of humor, but I was pleasantly surprised at the more serious moments in this movie. It deals with one of Madea's nieces being abused by her fiance, a foster child in need of guidance and discipline, and a commentary on the degradation of black society.The part I enjoyed the most was at the end of the family reunion, where Maya Angelo criticized all the young people for acting like the portrayal of ""cool black culture"" (gambling, sexually explicit, bad language, lack of education, etc etc).I ended up laughing quite a bit because I saw some of my family members personal flavor in this. The ""old style"" of discipline and child rearing included a few smacks and stern lectures. Oh Madea, I feel like you were at my family reunions.... There was some gross humor (fart jokes) which I never have liked and doubt I ever will; but they weren't so prominent that  it detracted from the movie a lot.I recommend that you rent or buy this movie.

985832,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,B000F9SO0O,Cecily Champagne,"[19, 34]","A friend selected this movie to watch last night, and - I must say - I'm blown away.  I have absolutely never seen a worse movie in my life.  Glancing over some of the comments below, I see that a lot of Amazon reviewers apparently enjoyed this film.  This truly baffles me.  Could we really have watched the same movie?To begin with, MADEA'S FAMILY REUNION has a lipid, melodramatic script, and most of the cast can be faulted with serious over-acting.  Unfortunately, these are the least of this film's problems.I would say that MADEA'S FAMILY REUNION's major fault is that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be.  Scenes with Madea (a violent, sharp-tongued old lady, played by actor Tyler Perry),  seem to strive for comedy (although I would emphasize the word ""strive""), while scenes involving a pair of sisters - one emotionally scarred from years of sexual abuse and the other dealing with a physically abusive fianc&eacute; - strike an infinitely more serious note.  Is this movie another Black-man-in-a-dress comedy, or is it a Hallmark special?There are also instances of more specific internal confusion.  For example, moments after the film asks us to have sympathy for the sister who is hit by her fianc&eacute;, it asks us to laugh as Madea beats up on her new foster child.  Since when is beating a young girl into submission funny?  Another example: just after the other sister reveals that her stepfather repeatedly raped her as a child, we find ourselves at the big ""family reunion,"" where a table full of lecherous old men drool over the rear-end of one of their teenage relatives.  I guess I don't get it.  Does this movie think that incest is tragic or hilarious?On top of these major failings, the movie was clearly very carelessly made.  Here are just 2 examples: watch the scene between the sexually abused sister and her bus driver-boyfriend, just after he takes their children out for ice cream.  It cuts back and forth between closeups of her face and his.  When we are looking at his face, he's got his hand along the side of her face.  When we look at her face, his hand is under her chin ... bad editing!  Here's another example of the movie's lack of thought: just before the wedding at the end of the film, the physically abused sister has big curly hair.  Moments later, when the ceremony actually begins, her hair has miraculously been straightened and styled.  I'm not a beautician, but I do know that straightening curly hair is no easy process.  Although these details are really insignificant, I think they're indicative of the lack of care or forethought that was put into this mess of a film.While I would love to see more movies that are dominated by an African American cast, I think there is something to be said for quality.  I found MADEA'S FAMILY REUNION to be *offensively* bad.  If you don't agree with me, I really have to wonder if you've ever actually seen a good movie or know how to recognize one.  If you're looking for a film with a predominantly Black cast, watch a Spike Lee movie - I recommend DO THE RIGHT THING.  Do you want a great comedy?  Try LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.  Do you want to see men in dresses?  Watch SOME LIKE IT HOT.  You've got to trust me: it gets so much better than this.",1,confused trash,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,3258,"['friend', 'selected', 'movie', 'watch', 'last', 'night', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'blown', 'away', 'have', 'absolutely', 'never', 'seen', 'worse', 'movie', 'life', 'Glancing', 'comments', 'see', 'lot', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'apparently', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'truly', 'Could', 'really', 'have', 'watched', 'same', 'movie', 'begin', 'MADEA', 'FAMILY', 'REUNION', 'lipid', 'melodramatic', 'script', 'most', 'cast', 'can', 'be', 'faulted', 'serious', 'over-acting', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'least', 'film', 'problems.I', 'would', 'say', 'MADEA', 'FAMILY', 'REUNION', 'major', 'fault', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'be', 'Scenes', 'Madea', 'violent', 'sharp-tongued', 'old', 'lady', 'played', 'actor', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'seem', 'strive', 'comedy', 'would', 'emphasize', 'word', 'strive', 'scenes', 'involving', 'pair', 'sisters', 'one', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'years', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'other', 'dealing', 'physically', 'abusive', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'strike', 'infinitely', 'more', 'serious', 'note', 'movie', 'Black-man-in-a-dress', 'comedy', 'Hallmark', 'special', 'are', 'also', 'instances', 'more', 'specific', 'internal', 'confusion', 'example', 'moments', 'film', 'have', 'sympathy', 'sister', 'who', 'hit', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'laugh', 'Madea', 'up', 'new', 'foster', 'child', 'when', 'beating', 'young', 'girl', 'submission', 'funny', 'example', 'just', 'other', 'sister', 'reveals', 'stepfather', 'repeatedly', 'raped', 'child', 'find', 'big', 'family', 'reunion', 'where', 'table', 'full', 'lecherous', 'old', 'men', 'drool', 'rear-end', 'one', 'teenage', 'relatives', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'think', 'incest', 'tragic', 'hilarious', 'top', 'major', 'failings', 'movie', 'was', 'clearly', 'very', 'carelessly', 'made', 'Here', 'are', 'just', '2', 'examples', 'watch', 'scene', 'sexually', 'abused', 'sister', 'bus', 'driver-boyfriend', 'just', 'children', 'out', 'ice', 'cream', 'back', 'forth', 'closeups', 'face', 'When', 'are', 'looking', 'face', 'got', 'hand', 'side', 'face', 'When', 'look', 'face', 'hand', 'chin', 'bad', 'editing', 'Here', 'example', 'movie', 'lack', 'thought', 'just', 'wedding', 'end', 'film', 'physically', 'abused', 'sister', 'big', 'curly', 'hair', 'Moments', 'later', 'when', 'ceremony', 'actually', 'hair', 'miraculously', 'been', 'straightened', 'styled', ""'m"", 'not', 'beautician', 'do', 'know', 'straightening', 'curly', 'hair', 'easy', 'process', 'details', 'are', 'really', 'insignificant', 'think', ""'re"", 'indicative', 'lack', 'care', 'forethought', 'was', 'put', 'mess', 'film.While', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'are', 'dominated', 'African', 'American', 'cast', 'think', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'quality', 'found', 'MADEA', 'FAMILY', 'REUNION', 'be', '*offensively*', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'really', 'have', 'wonder', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'actually', 'seen', 'good', 'movie', 'know', 'how', 'recognize', 'one', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'predominantly', 'Black', 'cast', 'watch', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'recommend', 'DO', 'RIGHT', 'THING', 'Do', 'want', 'great', 'comedy', 'Try', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'Do', 'want', 'see', 'men', 'dresses', 'Watch', 'SOME', 'IT', 'HOT', ""'ve"", 'got', 'trust', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Madea's Family Reunion

985835,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000F9SO0O,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[4, 6]","Last year Tyler Perry found himself thrust into the limelight with ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman."" I was curious (who wasn't), but the thrashing it took at the hands of the critics kept me away. This year he's back delivering more box office gold with ""Madea's Family Reunion,"" and this one I couldn't resist. It just seemed too unique. This film, formerly a play, written by our most successful black playwright, involves the writer/director dressing in drag and taking the crazed black woman stereotype to the mountain top. For the most part the film does fairly well for itself. It examines class and violence in our society, just not terribly well. But a great comic performance by Perry as Madea nearly saves the film.The story involves two sisters. One is in a great relationship that is only tempered by the fact that he is a bus driver. The other is on the verge of marrying a rich, handsome man with a real knack for smacking her around (and not in the good way). Meanwhile, their out to lunch aunt Madea spends her time trading insults with her husband and raising a foster child. Like far too many films aimed at black audiences these days (""Something New,"" ""Trois"") there is a heavy emphasis on wealth. Lisa is told to suck up the beatings, presumably because her husband to be is rich. Madea cheerleads her foster child when she tells her that she wants to be a lawyer, and we all know the only sexy thing about law is the cash it can make you. Ultimately, the film comes down against the gold diggers, but still enjoys swimming in materialism. A ridiculously lavish wedding fills the screen for the last ten minutes of the film, but since it's for the non-greedy characters Perry thinks he can have his wedding cake and eat it too. The ending is what sunk ""Madea's Family Reunion"" for me. Its portrayal of extreme happiness and shameless showiness had me gagging.The other main problem I had was with its muddled philosophy on violence. The entire film is a collision course between Madea's ""good"" violence and Carlos' ""bad"" violence. The problem lies in an early scene where Madea beats her foster child for not going to school. By having the hero engage in the behavior without any repercussions (other than the scene of ""Good Times"" in the background which shows the negative side of parental violence) means that the film is endorsing it. Of course there is such a thing as good violence as seen when the wife beater gets his comeuppance. But the fact that the film fails to distinguish between hitting a little girl and hitting a wife beater is to its detriment. There are some very good things happening here though. The humor comes class free and you'll laugh because of it. Uncle Joe gets some darn funny lines in that contribute to a very funny script. Also, the fact that Perry has a past in theater shows. His scenes are given time to develop and he has no use for CGI or stunts. I wasn't riveted, but I was entertained. If you can get past the philosophical hypocrisy and lack of character development then you'll love this film, unfortunately I could not. **3/4",3,Larger Than Life Characters in OK Movie,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,3086,"['Last', 'year', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'found', 'thrust', 'limelight', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Black', 'Woman', 'was', 'curious', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrashing', 'took', 'hands', 'critics', 'kept', 'away', 'year', 'back', 'delivering', 'more', 'box', 'office', 'gold', 'Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'unique', 'film', 'formerly', 'play', 'written', 'most', 'successful', 'black', 'playwright', 'writer/director', 'dressing', 'drag', 'taking', 'crazed', 'black', 'woman', 'stereotype', 'mountain', 'top', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'fairly', 'well', 'class', 'violence', 'society', 'just', 'not', 'terribly', 'well', 'great', 'comic', 'performance', 'Perry', 'Madea', 'nearly', 'film.The', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'One', 'great', 'relationship', 'only', 'tempered', 'fact', 'bus', 'driver', 'other', 'verge', 'marrying', 'rich', 'handsome', 'man', 'real', 'knack', 'smacking', 'around', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'Meanwhile', 'lunch', 'aunt', 'Madea', 'time', 'trading', 'insults', 'husband', 'raising', 'foster', 'child', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'aimed', 'black', 'audiences', 'days', 'Something', 'New', 'Trois', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'wealth', 'Lisa', 'told', 'suck', 'up', 'beatings', 'presumably', 'husband', 'be', 'rich', 'Madea', 'foster', 'child', 'when', 'be', 'lawyer', 'know', 'only', 'sexy', 'thing', 'law', 'cash', 'can', 'make', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'down', 'gold', 'diggers', 'still', 'swimming', 'materialism', 'ridiculously', 'lavish', 'wedding', 'screen', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'non-greedy', 'characters', 'Perry', 'can', 'have', 'wedding', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'ending', 'what', 'sunk', 'Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'portrayal', 'extreme', 'happiness', 'shameless', 'showiness', 'had', 'gagging.The', 'other', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'muddled', 'philosophy', 'violence', 'entire', 'film', 'collision', 'course', 'Madea', 'good', 'violence', 'Carlos', 'bad', 'violence', 'problem', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'Madea', 'foster', 'child', 'not', 'going', 'school', 'having', 'hero', 'engage', 'behavior', 'repercussions', 'other', 'scene', 'Good', 'Times', 'background', 'negative', 'side', 'parental', 'violence', 'film', 'endorsing', 'course', 'such', 'thing', 'good', 'violence', 'seen', 'when', 'wife', 'beater', 'comeuppance', 'fact', 'film', 'distinguish', 'hitting', 'little', 'girl', 'hitting', 'wife', 'beater', 'detriment', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'things', 'happening', 'here', 'humor', 'class', 'free', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'darn', 'funny', 'lines', 'contribute', 'very', 'funny', 'script', 'Also', 'fact', 'Perry', 'past', 'theater', 'shows', 'scenes', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'develop', 'use', 'CGI', 'stunts', 'was', ""n't"", 'riveted', 'was', 'entertained', 'can', 'get', 'philosophical', 'hypocrisy', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'could', 'not', '**3/4']",Madea's Family Reunion

The film is an adaptation of the stage play of the same name. Madea's Family Reunion hit theaters in early 2006 on the heels of Perry's successful 2005 movie Diary of a Mad Black Woman. Madea's Family Reunion opened at #1 in the US box office and held that spot for two consecutive weekends. The film was written and directed by Tyler Perry.Perry stars in the film as Madea and as several other supportin characters . Consider yourself warned, there is far less Madea in this film than in the previous film. In the early scenes of the movie Madea is awarded a foster daughter (Ke Ke Palmer) by the courts. The girl has a bad mouth and is unruly. Naturally Madea ""whips"" her into shape. Although this storyline was mentioned heavily in the promotion of the film this storyline is actually the least developed in the film.The primary storylines are those of Madea's Lisa and Vanessa. Lisa is a refined beautiful woman engaged to a wealthy Atlanta businessman named Carlos (Blair Underwood). He is very abusive. Despite the abuse her mother Victoria (Lynn Whittfield) encourages her to stay in the relationship. Lisa's sister Vanessa is emotionally battered and bruised single mother of two. When she meets a handsome bus driver named Brian (Boris Kodjoe), she is afraid to open her heart and love and be loved.Madea's Family Reunion-The Movie is an excellent film with an all star black cast. Maya Angelou, Cicely Tyson, and Jennifer Lewis are just a few of the talents rounding out the cast. Some of the most impressive acting came from Lisa Arrindell Anderson who portrayed Vanessa in the film.Madea's mannerism's and one liner's bring needed laughs to a film with a strong and powerful message.",4,Great acting all around,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1794,"['Tyler', 'Perry', 'movie', 'Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion-The', 'Movie', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'adaptation', 'stage', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'hit', 'theaters', 'early', '2006', 'heels', 'Perry', 'successful', '2005', 'movie', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Black', 'Woman', 'Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'opened', '1', 'US', 'box', 'office', 'held', 'spot', 'two', 'consecutive', 'weekends', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Tyler', 'Perry.Perry', 'film', 'Madea', 'several', 'other', 'supportin', 'characters', 'Consider', 'warned', 'far', 'less', 'Madea', 'film', 'previous', 'film', 'early', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Madea', 'awarded', 'foster', 'daughter', 'Ke', 'Ke', 'Palmer', 'courts', 'girl', 'bad', 'mouth', 'unruly', 'Naturally', 'Madea', 'whips', 'shape', 'storyline', 'was', 'mentioned', 'heavily', 'promotion', 'film', 'storyline', 'actually', 'least', 'developed', 'film.The', 'primary', 'storylines', 'are', 'Madea', 'Lisa', 'Vanessa', 'Lisa', 'refined', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'engaged', 'wealthy', 'Atlanta', 'businessman', 'named', 'Carlos', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'very', 'abusive', 'abuse', 'mother', 'Victoria', 'Lynn', 'Whittfield', 'stay', 'relationship', 'Lisa', 'sister', 'Vanessa', 'emotionally', 'battered', 'bruised', 'single', 'mother', 'two', 'When', 'handsome', 'bus', 'driver', 'named', 'Brian', 'Boris', 'Kodjoe', 'afraid', 'open', 'heart', 'love', 'be', 'loved.Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion-The', 'Movie', 'excellent', 'film', 'star', 'black', 'cast', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'Jennifer', 'Lewis', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'talents', 'rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'most', 'impressive', 'acting', 'came', 'Lisa', 'Arrindell', 'Anderson', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Vanessa', 'film.Madea', 'mannerism', 'one', 'liner', 'bring', 'needed', 'laughs', 'film', 'strong', 'powerful', 'message']",Madea's Family Reunion

I simply did not think much of it; it wasn't exciting, there was too little of Madea, the storyline of the mother letting her new husband rape her child with a different man was fairly impossible to believe (though I admit not completely impossible) as was the mother's personality (I find it hard to believe someone is THAT evil-hearted). I like Tyler Perry and I like his films. This one was not a bad film as I do not regret the time I spent watching it, in other words, it was entertaining enough. Just the sweet bus driver who is ""really a good man"" and the evil husband/fiancee was done already in ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"". I guess while there is quite a bit to enjoy about this film (mostly Madea and Uncle Jim), it just doesn't feel fresh enough. But perhaps what I really expected was a pure comedy from Tyler Perry, and what I got was yet another morality play.Nonetheless, Perry fans will enjoy this film. Like all of Perry's films, the music was superb. And like other reviewers have mentioned the ""Grits and Al Green"" scene was so perfect!

Clark ""MusiMan""","[1, 2]","It would've been a way better movie if there was more Madea, her name is in the title of the movie and after the meat of the story was dropped, out of nowhere the family reunion comes up at the end. No where in the movie did you see her get it together and she only talked about it once or twice. And some of the actors were unutilized and had the wrong roles. Let me start with Jennifer Lewis; the character was too much for a role that small and if she had the role of the mother than the movie could've been more enjoyable. Not to say Ms. Lynn Whitfield didn't do it justice but it was a bit weak here and there. Some of Madea's jokes were below what I expected and the whole grit performance between the pretty girl and Blair Underwood didn't compare to what Kim Elise did to her husband in the last movie. It looked more like a parody and less entertaining than say the limousine scene in ""What's love got to do with it"".The movie was okay, could've been more heavier than the last movie and the performances were alright but the scenes were too brief to grasp. So the girl got beaten but it was very brief, Lisa Arrindell was pretty good but it was less than I expected. There was not enough fire in the movie or enough passion.

985863,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000F9SO0O,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[10, 11]","A number of viewers has ridicule this film saying that it's just a  men in drag trying to be funny which has been done before and that is true, but none of those have been done like this.Madea's Family Reunion is about family, love, hurt, painful secrets and laughter. It features the infamous, gun-toting tell-it-like-it-is Madea, but this movie introduces a lot of well-rounded characters that are played by some incredible actors. We meet Vanessa the older of the two nieces in the movie. She has two out-of-wedlock children and has moved in with Madea. We also meet her sister Lisa, the younger and meek one who is engaged to a wealthy and violent investment banker named Carlos. To round out this group is Victoria, Lisa and Vanessa's mother, a strong-willed, domineering mother who has a favoritism for Lisa and a troubled past with Vanessa.Although the film is titled Madea's Family Reunion, the viewer gets caught up in this dual story of the sisters. One finding what love is, and one finding out what love isn't. The movie boasts powerful issues that are acted out to perfection. Tackling such controversial issues is rarely seen in films today where the movie industry has caught remake and horror fever. What is most compelling is the way Perry tells this story of love and pain, it is without color. Anyone, no matter what race or status can relate to this movie.I also liked how the movie tackled foster parenting. Madea takes in Nikki, a rough quick little girl who has been passed around in the foster care system. With a little patience, a lot of love and encouragement, we see her metamorphosis into a sweet young lady.The film also features strong matriarchs, garnering appearances from both Cicely Tyson and Maya Angelou. The family reunion scene in the movie is exhilarating and honest. It also gives a very moving speech by Cicely Tyson that defies time.This is a must-see. A movie that tackles the good and the bad. There is good acting, great story lines, great character development, great music and it will leave you feeling stronger, encouraged and educated on the lessons that life deals us. Don't assume this movie is like the play or is simply about a man in drag. Trust me, it is not. You will be pleasantly surprised and definitely entertained.",4,One of Perry's compelling story told of love and pain without color.,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,2276,"['number', 'viewers', 'ridicule', 'film', 'saying', 'just', 'men', 'drag', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'true', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'this.Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'family', 'love', 'hurt', 'painful', 'secrets', 'laughter', 'infamous', 'gun-toting', 'tell-it-like-it-is', 'Madea', 'movie', 'lot', 'well-rounded', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'incredible', 'actors', 'meet', 'older', 'two', 'nieces', 'movie', 'two', 'out-of-wedlock', 'children', 'moved', 'Madea', 'also', 'meet', 'sister', 'Lisa', 'younger', 'meek', 'one', 'who', 'engaged', 'wealthy', 'violent', 'investment', 'banker', 'named', 'Carlos', 'round', 'out', 'group', 'Victoria', 'Lisa', 'Vanessa', 'mother', 'strong-willed', 'domineering', 'mother', 'who', 'favoritism', 'Lisa', 'troubled', 'past', 'Vanessa.Although', 'film', 'titled', 'Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'viewer', 'caught', 'up', 'dual', 'story', 'sisters', 'One', 'finding', 'what', 'love', 'one', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'love', ""n't"", 'movie', 'powerful', 'issues', 'are', 'acted', 'perfection', 'Tackling', 'such', 'controversial', 'issues', 'rarely', 'seen', 'films', 'today', 'where', 'movie', 'industry', 'caught', 'remake', 'horror', 'fever', 'What', 'most', 'compelling', 'way', 'Perry', 'story', 'love', 'pain', 'color', 'Anyone', 'matter', 'what', 'race', 'status', 'can', 'relate', 'movie.I', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'movie', 'tackled', 'foster', 'parenting', 'Madea', 'Nikki', 'rough', 'quick', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'passed', 'foster', 'care', 'system', 'little', 'patience', 'lot', 'love', 'encouragement', 'see', 'metamorphosis', 'sweet', 'young', 'lady.The', 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'matriarchs', 'garnering', 'appearances', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'family', 'reunion', 'scene', 'movie', 'exhilarating', 'honest', 'also', 'very', 'moving', 'speech', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'must-see', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'great', 'music', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'stronger', 'encouraged', 'educated', 'lessons', 'life', 'deals', 'Do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'movie', 'play', 'simply', 'man', 'drag', 'Trust', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'definitely', 'entertained']",Madea's Family Reunion

However, I came across and thought, why not.  It is pretty funny despite the fact that the movie focused more on Madea's troubled nieces and their love lives rather than on Madea.To avoid jail time for removing an electronic ankle monitoring device, Madea is ordered to foster a young runaway girl.  Madea and this young girl are hilarious.  The girl has an awful attitude which is really a wall surrounding her fears.  However, Madea is having none of it and she isn't afraid to use the belt.Madea's two nieces are having love troubles.  One of them has 2 young children and basically has been scarred from ever falling in love again.  However, the driver on the public bus that she rides frequently finds her attractive and wants to ask her out.  The other niece is engaged to one of the city's most eligible bachelor (Underwood).  The problem is that this bachelor is physically abusive.  She wants to leave the relationship but her conniving mother pressures her to stay and suffer.  Meanwhile, both nieces have emotional issues with their mother.While the movie is hilarious, there's a serious side as well...dealing with domestic violence, accountability, marriage.  At the family reunions, the elders (Angelou & Tyson) address the family to wake up and start caring for one another.I thought that *Madea's Family Reunion* had some good laughs.

985883,A1LF4NXBKM5W01,B000F9SO0O,marsdaman,"[0, 0]","FIRST, to the good stuff...Tyler Perry really wrote a great one here! This is a sequel to Madea's Diary of a Mad Black Woman, but strangely--like the movie before it--can stand on its own. It picks up sometime after the first one(maybe a few months, maybe a few years). Madea[Tyler Perry in drag] is forced by Judge Mablean(TV divorce judge) to be foster mom to this troubled young girl(Keke Palmer) who simply has no one to look up to. Madea is your ideal old school black mother of the world--which means she is the best thing for you as long as you don't cross her! She lives with her brother, wisecracking Grandpa Joe(who gets on everyone's nerves; is a selfish malcontent; and is just plain nasty). She quickly gets the girl in line with her own infectious brand of tough love along with having to keep Joe in line, too(Joe would really take some effort if not for Madea's SPECIAL tactics). If you watched the first one, then you know that there's at least one other family member to which all other family members are satellites to. This movie has Madea and 2 stepsisters in Madea's family with everyone else revolving around them somehow. Now, Madea's home is once again a home for family ""runaways"" so to speak. This time, it's the rejected 1 of the 2 grown sisters--staying with her. The older sister[mother of 2] catches the eye of Boris Kodjoe[(city bus driver)(father of 1)]. She plays hard to get at first--maybe indicating that she doesn't trust men. She eventually warms to his overtures, as he's funny and they have a lot in common. Now, the other sister is ""Cinderella"" to her mother(Lynn Whitfield). She has pampered this sister her whole life and now--that's she grown--she's still at it! Whitfield[Victoria] and her daughter's fiancee(Blair Underwood) have this typical ambivalent relationship. She wants her to follow in her footsteps--marry rich. Like Whitfield's own marriage before(alluded to and not shown), the man is a serious problem for the woman! Blair Underwood(Carlos) is abusive and controlling to a weak minded woman who has always had the red carpet laid out for her. Her older stepsister(both have the same mother--Victoria) is much stronger bc she wasn't special(her daddy wasn't valued as much--not rich). Whitfield even sacrificed the older daughter to the rich husband in order to keep him(child molester)!Enough drama so far. So far, Joe and Madea clash and Madea and Palmer clash and the older sister and mother clash and the younger sister and her fiancee clash and sexual abuse(not shown) and Joe cracks on or is nasty with everyone that he comes across! Phew! There's still the wedding day, family reunion, and the younger sister transmutes into the older stronger sister--with some help from Madea and the family. These three events take you to the end. I can't say any more without spoiling it and I've left some important parts out(as they aren't needed to tell the story), so I'll bid you adieu!Let me get to the problems which make it 4.5 star rating: Drag queen(absolutely can't stand it if they are dating a dude--which did not happen in this movie). Fart scene with Papa Joe, Madea, and Kodjoe: When someone ""CUTS CHEESE"" and it stinks really bad, It gets on you. He's going out on a date; can you say problem?! She came out and didn't smell anything in the house or on him either. The part where she gets really IRATE about Kodjoe taking her kids out while she was sleeping; she's supposed to be mad; she was NOT supposed to make an excuse for him in the end(I'm not saying it isn't something that they couldn't get passed, but so soon; your children are more precious than anything besides a spouse on this earth; her problem mother Victoria let him off the hook with only a scolding; she should have stuck firm and kept to her point that he made a mistake; for all she knew, he could have been a child molester like her stepfather. This kind of thing really takes time and he should understand that--if he loved her). There is also a part before the wedding that is just not common sense, bc if there's no blinding or ""worse""(there is almost always retribution--won't spoil it) These things are minor for the most part.",5,This movie was very funny and dramatic; a real  great time!,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,4175,"['FIRST', 'good', 'stuff', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'really', 'wrote', 'great', 'one', 'here', 'sequel', 'Madea', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Black', 'Woman', 'strangely', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'up', 'sometime', 'first', 'one', 'maybe', 'few', 'months', 'maybe', 'few', 'years', 'Madea', '[', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'drag', ']', 'forced', 'Judge', 'Mablean', 'TV', 'divorce', 'judge', 'be', 'foster', 'mom', 'troubled', 'young', 'girl', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'who', 'simply', 'one', 'look', 'up', 'Madea', 'ideal', 'old', 'school', 'black', 'mother', 'world', 'best', 'thing', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'cross', 'brother', 'wisecracking', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'who', 'everyone', 'nerves', 'selfish', 'malcontent', 'just', 'plain', 'nasty', 'quickly', 'girl', 'line', 'own', 'infectious', 'brand', 'tough', 'love', 'having', 'keep', 'Joe', 'line', 'too', 'Joe', 'would', 'really', 'take', 'effort', 'not', 'Madea', 'SPECIAL', 'tactics', 'watched', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'know', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'family', 'member', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'movie', 'Madea', '2', 'stepsisters', 'Madea', 'family', 'everyone', 'else', 'revolving', 'somehow', 'Now', 'Madea', 'home', 'once', 'again', 'home', 'family', 'runaways', 'so', 'speak', 'time', 'rejected', '1', '2', 'grown', 'sisters', 'staying', 'older', 'sister', 'mother', '2', ']', 'catches', 'eye', 'Boris', 'Kodjoe', '[', 'city', 'bus', 'driver', 'father', '1', ']', 'hard', 'get', 'first', 'maybe', 'indicating', ""n't"", 'trust', 'men', 'eventually', 'overtures', 'funny', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'Now', 'other', 'sister', 'Cinderella', 'mother', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'pampered', 'sister', 'whole', 'life', 'now', 'grown', 'still', 'Whitfield', '[', 'Victoria', ']', 'daughter', 'fiancee', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'have', 'typical', 'ambivalent', 'relationship', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'marry', 'rich', 'Whitfield', 'own', 'marriage', 'alluded', 'not', 'shown', 'man', 'serious', 'problem', 'woman', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'Carlos', 'abusive', 'controlling', 'weak', 'minded', 'woman', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'red', 'carpet', 'laid', 'out', 'older', 'stepsister', 'have', 'same', 'mother', 'Victoria', 'much', 'stronger', 'bc', 'was', ""n't"", 'special', 'daddy', 'was', ""n't"", 'valued', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'rich', 'Whitfield', 'even', 'sacrificed', 'older', 'daughter', 'rich', 'husband', 'order', 'keep', 'child', 'molester', 'Enough', 'drama', 'so', 'far', 'So', 'far', 'Joe', 'Madea', 'clash', 'Madea', 'Palmer', 'clash', 'older', 'sister', 'mother', 'clash', 'younger', 'sister', 'fiancee', 'clash', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'not', 'shown', 'Joe', 'cracks', 'nasty', 'everyone', 'Phew', 'still', 'wedding', 'day', 'family', 'reunion', 'younger', 'sister', 'older', 'stronger', 'sister', 'help', 'Madea', 'family', 'three', 'events', 'take', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'spoiling', ""'ve"", 'left', 'important', 'parts', 'out', 'are', ""n't"", 'needed', 'tell', 'story', 'so', ""'ll"", 'bid', 'adieu', 'Let', 'get', 'problems', 'make', '4.5', 'star', 'rating', 'Drag', 'queen', 'absolutely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'are', 'dating', 'dude', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'movie', 'Fart', 'scene', 'Papa', 'Joe', 'Madea', 'Kodjoe', 'When', 'someone', 'CUTS', 'CHEESE', 'really', 'bad', 'going', 'out', 'date', 'can', 'say', 'problem', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'smell', 'anything', 'house', 'part', 'where', 'really', 'IRATE', 'Kodjoe', 'taking', 'kids', 'out', 'was', 'sleeping', 'supposed', 'be', 'mad', 'was', 'NOT', 'supposed', 'make', 'excuse', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'passed', 'so', 'soon', 'children', 'are', 'more', 'precious', 'anything', 'spouse', 'earth', 'problem', 'mother', 'Victoria', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'only', 'scolding', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'firm', 'kept', 'point', 'made', 'mistake', 'knew', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'child', 'molester', 'stepfather', 'kind', 'thing', 'really', 'time', 'should', 'understand', 'loved', 'also', 'part', 'wedding', 'just', 'not', 'common', 'sense', 'bc', 'blinding', 'worse', 'almost', 'always', 'retribution', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'things', 'are', 'minor', 'most', 'part']",Madea's Family Reunion

Black people = majority. White people never serve a major role in this guy's movie, the best they can be is the background actors. This is NOT a racist comment, this is the truthful observation, anyone that watches Tyler's movies, especially those listed above, should have seen it a mile away. I'd go into more details, but meh....I know this movie is situated in Atlanta and the majority are black, however, in his movies you can clearly see white people in the background so you can't possibly justify his racially VERY unbalance group of actors.2. Has Madea (only in this movie, she appears a lot less often and has weaker lines and actions).3. The teaching of moral value, he likes making movies that speak out to the black community, but should appeal partially as well to everyone else.4. Usually has relationship or domestic issues like being abused or whatnot.5. Fairytale ending or good ending. Sorry, but because he's using real life situations, he should not fool people into thinking that everything works out great in the end with everyone singing and smiling and the world is working itself out. Tell that to my life. Real life situations do NOT always end great and does not always end up with you being with some sort of hottie/stud that is perfect in every way. Also, many of the people in this movie, especially the lead actors, are unrealistically good looking. I just don't understand why someone so concentrated with real life situation portray real life in such a fabcriated and exaggerated manner. This goes for most of his movies.Sorry to say, but this movie is nowhere NEAR as good as the two movies I listed above. Madea, as said, appears less often. The humor isn't as fun, even the drama is not as well built because you really start to notice that he's starting to use the same formula, it is almost a mimic. He's starting to lose his credibility as a writer in my personal opinion. I felt this way about this movie because it's the third one I've watched after the other two. It works in this formula:FORMULA:1. Girl has problem with guy.2. Then comes the perfect black man that not only looks perfect, but acts perfect (how unrealistic? So what...you have to look good in order to be good to a woman? A perfect gentleman does NOT have to look like a stud...that's one negative to Tyler Perry's movies, he hits in a realistic mark but his characters and the way they're fabricated is unrealistic to the majority of the population)3. Then she tries to work it out and in the end you get a moral teaching of some sort and everything works out like some sort of fairytale.In this movie, it's a bit different from that formula, but watch those two other movies first than watch this one. You'll see that I mean. He lost a lot of credibility in my book.Tyler Perry, if you're reading this... (LMAO Yeah right...), your movies are great! They're so good I actually made my mom watch it and she loved it, which is rare. But please change your formula and the way you write your movies. You do not have to stick with the same stuff over and over.Maybe make a movie where the guy is the one that is abused first or the person that rescues her is not some stud.

Anderson ""sma331""","[7, 11]","I've never seen any of Tyler Perry's plays live, but enjoyed ""Diary of a Mad Blackwoman the Movie"" so much, I saw Madea's Family reunion in theaters twice, and I'm having regular Tyler Perry marathons with his movies and the plays on the regular.  I've become a new Tyler Perry fan.Madea's Family Reunion tackles family unity, and domestic abuse.  Lisa is engaged to Carlos, he is handsome, he is well off, and he is abusive.  He tells her ""He will love her to death"", and he means that literally.  Lisa tries to reveal her abuse to her mother who simply replies ""well you have to stop doing what you are doing to make him angry.""  Mom is played by the beautiful, and talented Lynn Whitfield, and let me tell you, she played this part well!!!  Evil, she was simply evil!!!One scene had Lisa out with her sister and a friend.  She forgets her cell phone, and that had her nervous.  When they return to her house, a male dancer arrives, and Lisa tries to get rid of him, but Carlos comes home first.  He seemed okay with Lisa having fun, but you knew what would happen when she finally got her sister and friend to leave.  It was obvious, but when it happens, you still react to what he does.Vanessa is a single mother who is trying to simply focus on raising her two adorable children, but bus driver Frankie Henderson really wants to get to know her, and finally wears her down enough to go on a date with him.  Frankie is a single father to a son.Madea goes to court for removing her house arrest anklet, and ends up taking home a child to foster after bragging she will take in anyone who needs help.  The car ride is hilarious, because Nikki keeps snapping her gum, and Madea can't stand gum snapping.  When Nikki starts removing her earrings claiming she will fight an old woman, Madea turns around in her front seat and leaps at Niki to give her the spanking she deserves for being disrespectful.Vanessa who is Lisa's sister does not have a good relationship with their mother at all.  During one argument Vanessa tells Mom ""You will rot in hell"", and Mom replies ""I vacation there!!!""  Evil, I said Mom was Evil!!!The scene that still grips me is when Vanessa remembers being sexually abused, and Mom trying to justify the action.  I mean that was horrible, and Mom expects Lisa to take care of her, little does Lisa know that her Trust Fund is being depleted by Mom.  Hey Mom, get a job!!!The family reunion scene was also a good one.  I thought the speech that was done was one that is needed, and had to be said.  `""Young black women more then thighs, and hips take your place!!  What happened to pride and respect?""  I thought the speech was powerful.  Very powerful.This is an excellent movie.  I just wonder why Henry Simmons scenes where cut out of the film.  He was in the movie, and I wondered why because his part was so small, then you watch the extras and see he and his wife actually had more scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor.I'm looking forward to seeing his latest release Daddy's Little girls when it comes out in theaters.",5,Keep that pot of hot grits handy!!!,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,3059,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'plays', 'live', 'enjoyed', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Blackwoman', 'Movie', 'so', 'much', 'saw', 'Madea', 'Family', 'reunion', 'theaters', 'twice', ""'m"", 'having', 'regular', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'marathons', 'movies', 'plays', 'regular', ""'ve"", 'become', 'new', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fan.Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'tackles', 'family', 'unity', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Lisa', 'engaged', 'Carlos', 'handsome', 'well', 'off', 'abusive', 'will', 'love', 'death', 'literally', 'Lisa', 'reveal', 'abuse', 'mother', 'who', 'simply', 'well', 'have', 'stop', 'doing', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'make', 'angry', 'Mom', 'played', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'let', 'tell', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'Evil', 'was', 'simply', 'evil', 'One', 'scene', 'had', 'Lisa', 'out', 'sister', 'friend', 'cell', 'phone', 'had', 'nervous', 'When', 'return', 'house', 'male', 'dancer', 'arrives', 'Lisa', 'tries', 'get', 'rid', 'Carlos', 'home', 'first', 'seemed', 'okay', 'Lisa', 'having', 'fun', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'sister', 'friend', 'leave', 'was', 'obvious', 'when', 'still', 'react', 'what', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'trying', 'simply', 'focus', 'raising', 'two', 'adorable', 'children', 'bus', 'driver', 'Frankie', 'Henderson', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'finally', 'down', 'enough', 'go', 'date', 'Frankie', 'single', 'father', 'son.Madea', 'court', 'removing', 'house', 'arrest', 'anklet', 'up', 'taking', 'home', 'child', 'foster', 'bragging', 'will', 'take', 'anyone', 'who', 'help', 'car', 'ride', 'hilarious', 'Nikki', 'snapping', 'gum', 'Madea', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'gum', 'snapping', 'When', 'Nikki', 'removing', 'earrings', 'claiming', 'will', 'fight', 'old', 'woman', 'Madea', 'around', 'front', 'seat', 'leaps', 'Niki', 'give', 'spanking', 'being', 'disrespectful.Vanessa', 'who', 'Lisa', 'sister', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'relationship', 'mother', 'one', 'argument', 'Vanessa', 'Mom', 'will', 'rot', 'hell', 'Mom', 'vacation', 'there', 'Evil', 'said', 'Mom', 'was', 'Evil', 'scene', 'still', 'when', 'Vanessa', 'remembers', 'being', 'sexually', 'abused', 'Mom', 'trying', 'justify', 'action', 'mean', 'was', 'horrible', 'Mom', 'Lisa', 'take', 'care', 'little', 'Lisa', 'know', 'Trust', 'Fund', 'being', 'depleted', 'Mom', 'Hey', 'Mom', 'get', 'job', 'family', 'reunion', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'one', 'thought', 'speech', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'one', 'needed', 'had', 'be', 'said', 'Young', 'black', 'women', 'more', 'then', 'thighs', 'hips', 'take', 'place', 'What', 'happened', 'pride', 'respect', 'thought', 'speech', 'was', 'powerful', 'Very', 'powerful.This', 'excellent', 'movie', 'just', 'wonder', 'why', 'Henry', 'Simmons', 'scenes', 'where', 'cut', 'film', 'was', 'movie', 'wondered', 'why', 'part', 'was', 'so', 'small', 'then', 'watch', 'extras', 'see', 'wife', 'actually', 'had', 'more', 'scenes', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'latest', 'release', 'Daddy', 'Little', 'girls', 'when', 'out', 'theaters']",Madea's Family Reunion

Madea) and villains (eg. Carlos) in this movie.  I can understand how one might get the impression that abuse is being condoned in certain contexts, although I'm not sure that Tyler Perry means to condone it so much as just share what he knows, to show what goes on in real life, and try to balance it with enough comedy that we can bear to hear about the tragic aspects of it.  I think Tyler does well to shed light on it all.  While his subsequent films show more subtlety as a writer and director, I can't help but love his earlier, raw, ""unrefined"" work just as much as his more recent, ""polished"" gems like ""The Family that Preys"".Some great quotes from the making of ""Madea's Family Reunion"" featurette on the DVD:""A world that most people hide.  The abuses, the childhood horrors that a lot of us have.  The molestations.

I especially enjoy the way the mother-daughter interractions between the main characters play out in the film. I watch this when I need something funny but at the same time deep and uplifting.This movie covers quite a lot and at the center of it is Madea who is funny as hell. After awhile you forget it's Tyler Perry in drag- the character is so good. It takes on a whole life of its own-funny and outrageous, yet real and down to earth somehow- with a lot of wisdom to offer. Some serious themes are touched upon and at the heart of it is a great moral (for everyone).
