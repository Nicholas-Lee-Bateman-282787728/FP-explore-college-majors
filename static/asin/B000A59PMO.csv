921529,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000A59PMO,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Veronica Mars, Season 1I used to watch this TV show on occasion. Its an interesting variation of the classical private detective story where justice is sought through a small business rather than a government agency. The setting seems implausible, could a teenage girl really have the maturity and experience to work as a private detective? What about state laws that license and regulate this occupation? The stories also seem implausible for teenagers. One advantage of using a teenager is this: if caught doing something illegal they should get a lighter sentence, or have it written off as a youthful prank. Popular television series will last for more than three years. Its not so much that is was bad as it was not that great. These stories are a modern version of &#8220;Nancy Drew&#8221;, another teenage detective from an earlier generation. Why does Veronica want to hang out with the spoiled children of the super rich? Does this show maturity? Or part of her undercover work?The story here is that Veronica&#8217;s father used to be Sheriff. When a teenage girl was found murdered her father was treated as a suspect. [Most victims know their murderer.] The father was a very wealthy and powerful man so the Sheriff was force out of a job! [Was this plausible in modern life?] This educated the viewer about the realities of the real world where the rich have much more power than the average voter. Could a rich man have so much power over an elected Sheriff? These stories also reflect the life and culture of the 1990s. Veronica&#8217;s mother had gone away, leaving the possibility or a reunion and more drama. The unsolved murder of that girl could provide other dramatic possibilities. Showing how information is gathered is educational. I wonder how much could be gathered from the Internet today? The movie &#8220;The Net&#8221; shows the dangers of providing personal information to anyone.Detective stories originate in the 19th century, &#8220;Sherlock Holmes&#8221; set a standard that was often imitated but never equaled. Eyewitness testimony was the most important in solving crimes. Even today it is most important when there are witnesses. They also knew of the possible faults in eyewitness identification (The Tichbourne Claimant). Trave evidence, as used by Sherlock Holmes, provided an objective witness to a crime. But Holmes also warned against improper conclusions (&#8220;a stick points in two directions&#8221;). Knowledge gained led to improved police investigations in the 20th century. The use of outside experts became rare. Often defense lawyers requested them to challenge the evidence gathered by the police (as in the Simpson murder trial).Today private detectives are usually hired for private investigations (divorce actions, insurance claims, business problems, and tracing a missing person). &#8220;The Maltese Falcon&#8221; and &#8220;Farewell, My Lovely&#8221; were stories that began with the hunt for a missing person. The Pinkerton Agency was employed by banks, trains, and express agencies to catch robbers and thieves. Businessmen realized that socialization lowered their costs so a government agency, a National Office of Investigation, would perform these tasks at a much lower cost. Costs would come from everyone&#8217;s taxes not from the few who benefitted from their work. What was the eventual effect from a more powerful government agency? It also did the counter-intelligence work that any government needs. The movies about private detectives were followed by stories about government agents.",3,I Was a Teenage Detective,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,3561,"['Veronica', 'Mars', 'Season', '1I', 'used', 'watch', 'TV', 'show', 'occasion', 'interesting', 'variation', 'classical', 'private', 'detective', 'story', 'where', 'justice', 'sought', 'small', 'business', 'rather', 'government', 'agency', 'setting', 'implausible', 'could', 'teenage', 'girl', 'really', 'have', 'maturity', 'experience', 'work', 'private', 'detective', 'What', 'state', 'laws', 'license', 'regulate', 'occupation', 'stories', 'also', 'seem', 'implausible', 'teenagers', 'One', 'advantage', 'using', 'teenager', 'caught', 'doing', 'something', 'illegal', 'should', 'get', 'lighter', 'sentence', 'have', 'written', 'off', 'youthful', 'prank', 'Popular', 'television', 'series', 'will', 'last', 'more', 'three', 'years', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'stories', 'are', 'modern', 'version', '8220', 'Nancy', 'Drew', '8221', 'teenage', 'detective', 'earlier', 'generation', 'Why', 'Veronica', 'want', 'hang', 'out', 'spoiled', 'children', 'super', 'rich', 'show', 'maturity', 'part', 'undercover', 'work', 'story', 'here', 'Veronica', '8217', 'father', 'used', 'be', 'Sheriff', 'When', 'teenage', 'girl', 'was', 'found', 'murdered', 'father', 'was', 'treated', 'suspect', 'Most', 'victims', 'know', 'murderer', ']', 'father', 'was', 'very', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'man', 'Sheriff', 'was', 'force', 'job', '[', 'Was', 'plausible', 'modern', 'life', ']', 'educated', 'viewer', 'realities', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'rich', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'power', 'average', 'voter', 'Could', 'rich', 'man', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'elected', 'Sheriff', 'stories', 'also', 'reflect', 'life', 'culture', '1990s', 'Veronica', '8217', 's', 'mother', 'had', 'gone', 'away', 'leaving', 'possibility', 'reunion', 'more', 'drama', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'girl', 'could', 'provide', 'other', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'Showing', 'how', 'information', 'gathered', 'educational', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'gathered', 'Internet', 'today', 'movie', '8220', 'Net', '8221', 'dangers', 'providing', 'personal', 'information', 'anyone.Detective', 'stories', 'originate', '19th', 'century', '8220', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', '8221', 'set', 'standard', 'was', 'often', 'imitated', 'never', 'equaled', 'Eyewitness', 'testimony', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'solving', 'crimes', 'Even', 'today', 'most', 'important', 'when', 'are', 'witnesses', 'also', 'knew', 'possible', 'faults', 'eyewitness', 'identification', 'Tichbourne', 'Claimant', 'Trave', 'evidence', 'used', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'provided', 'objective', 'witness', 'crime', 'Holmes', 'also', 'warned', 'improper', 'conclusions', '8220', 'stick', 'points', 'two', 'directions', '8221', 'Knowledge', 'gained', 'led', 'improved', 'police', 'investigations', '20th', 'century', 'use', 'outside', 'experts', 'became', 'rare', 'defense', 'lawyers', 'requested', 'challenge', 'evidence', 'gathered', 'police', 'Simpson', 'murder', 'trial', '.Today', 'private', 'detectives', 'are', 'usually', 'hired', 'private', 'investigations', 'divorce', 'actions', 'insurance', 'claims', 'business', 'problems', 'tracing', 'missing', 'person', '8220', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', '8221', '8220', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Lovely', '8221', 'were', 'stories', 'began', 'hunt', 'missing', 'person', 'Pinkerton', 'Agency', 'was', 'employed', 'banks', 'trains', 'express', 'agencies', 'catch', 'robbers', 'thieves', 'Businessmen', 'realized', 'socialization', 'lowered', 'costs', 'government', 'agency', 'National', 'Office', 'Investigation', 'would', 'perform', 'tasks', 'much', 'lower', 'cost', 'Costs', 'would', 'come', 'everyone', '8217', 's', 'taxes', 'not', 'few', 'who', 'benefitted', 'work', 'What', 'was', 'eventual', 'effect', 'more', 'powerful', 'government', 'agency', 'also', 'did', 'counter-intelligence', 'work', 'government', 'needs', 'movies', 'private', 'detectives', 'were', 'followed', 'stories', 'government', 'agents']",Veronica Mars: Season 1
921530,AWMLV7I2E49RM,B000A59PMO,Adam B.,"[0, 0]","This show was one that I missed while it was airing, and I'm glad I was able to find it again, years later.In the vein of a lot of the CW/WB series, this show featured a group of high school students, many of them good looking, trying to find their way in the world.  Unlike most of the other shows along those lines, this series dealt with some very serious topics in a real way and featured great acting and writing to make it all work better than most.The series opens revealing that Veronica (Kristen Bell) is a Junior in High School, who has to deal with the fact that she is being ostracized by her peers after the tragic death of her best friend, and the replacement of her father as the Sheriff who people felt botched the investigation into her friend's death by going after one of the town's most influential and wealthy citizen.  In addition, she was victimized herself around the same time and trying to come to terms with the ramifications of that.Instead of fleeing the town, her father opens a private investigation service, where she helps out and even participates in some of the investigations.  This lets him to continue looking into the murder, while also earning a living mostly checking on potential cheating spouses in the wealthy town.Even with the serious topics shown on the series, the wit and humor of the show, particularly through the snide remarks of Veronica and her friends and family, shines through, allowing often very serious topics to be dealt with in a palatable and often enjoyable way.  This is definitely a show that deserves its ""cult status"" as a highly crafted show where the people involved in its creation put through a solid, heart-felt effort to produce something worth watching.",5,Great show with heart and attitude,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,1728,"['show', 'was', 'one', 'missed', 'was', 'airing', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'again', 'years', 'later.In', 'vein', 'lot', 'CW/WB', 'series', 'show', 'featured', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'many', 'good', 'looking', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'world', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'lines', 'series', 'dealt', 'very', 'serious', 'topics', 'real', 'way', 'featured', 'great', 'acting', 'writing', 'make', 'work', 'better', 'most.The', 'series', 'revealing', 'Veronica', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Junior', 'High', 'School', 'who', 'deal', 'fact', 'being', 'ostracized', 'peers', 'tragic', 'death', 'best', 'friend', 'replacement', 'father', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'people', 'felt', 'botched', 'investigation', 'friend', 'death', 'going', 'one', 'town', 'most', 'influential', 'wealthy', 'citizen', 'addition', 'was', 'victimized', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'ramifications', 'that.Instead', 'fleeing', 'town', 'father', 'private', 'investigation', 'service', 'where', 'even', 'participates', 'investigations', 'continue', 'looking', 'murder', 'also', 'earning', 'living', 'mostly', 'checking', 'potential', 'cheating', 'spouses', 'wealthy', 'town.Even', 'serious', 'topics', 'shown', 'series', 'wit', 'humor', 'show', 'particularly', 'snide', 'remarks', 'Veronica', 'friends', 'family', 'shines', 'allowing', 'often', 'very', 'serious', 'topics', 'be', 'dealt', 'palatable', 'often', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'definitely', 'show', 'cult', 'status', 'highly', 'crafted', 'show', 'where', 'people', 'involved', 'creation', 'put', 'solid', 'heart-felt', 'effort', 'produce', 'something', 'worth', 'watching']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

921532,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000A59PMO,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 7]","What would you get if you crossed the beloved children's book Harriet the Spy with elements from CSI as well as any classic mystery-television program like Matlock, Murder She Wrote, and Magnum P.I. adding just a dash of youthful interjection?  Out of the bubbly cauldron you would discover a flawless television program called Veronica Mars.  Through my small knowledge of I don't think I ever picked up on the enormous originality of this program.  Perhaps I had given up on television at the time, or just didn't think that the station known as UPN could produce anything of value.  I was wrong, dead wrong.  Veronica Mars is one of the most original, creative, suspenseful, and intelligent shows out there.  While I may be basing this solely on the first season, I do not think that with the high energy of the characters, simple yet fun storylines, and edgy undertones that it will ever change.  This first season introduced me to a whole new world surrounding Neptune High and specifically the dramatic past of one Veronica Mars.Veronica Mars is not your typical murder/mystery television show.  This program combines one part Twin Peaks, one part After-School Special, and one part My So-Called Life with more precision and ease than I have witnessed in most Hollywood films.  We are led, adventure after adventure, by a young, energetic, and intelligent (lethal combination) amateur sleuth named Veronica Mars.  Her best friend, Lilly Kane, was just murdered and her father, the local sheriff of Neptune, blamed the wrong person.  Now, this community of Hollywood superstars, corporate presidents, and the wealthiest individuals, has shunned her family.  The worst part of it all, she has to go to school with all of their children.  We open this season with Veronica friendless, yet determined to pursue her truth and discover the real killer of her best friend.Coupled with a group of individuals that do not overact, seem grounded in their characters, and feel just like those you would meet in a high school setting, we spend episode after episode getting closer to the truth, while also getting closer to each one of these individuals.  This is what made this show grow on me.  By watching just one or two episodes, you see that this is going to be a decent series, but it isn't until you fully get involved into the second disc that you see the power behind our characters, story, and themes.  This is one of those rare television programs where you feel a connection with all the characters, yet trust none of them.  With Veronica solving ""mini-mysteries"" throughout the series while solely discovering the truth about Lilly, you cannot help but think that everyone is somehow involved.  The truth may be there, but until the final episode, you believe nothing.Veronica Mars works because of its minor characters and strong central character.  Veronica (played by Kristen Bell) keeps you glued to your television with her strong wit, ironclad charm, and fearless personality.  She wants the truth, and we (the audience members) find ourselves rooting for her the entire time.  This show will take you back to your high school years and make you wish that you had the brains and ability that Veronica had.  I remember watching this show and my wife saying that if it were airing when she was in school, she would see Veronica as an exceptional role model.  She would want to solve crimes/mysteries within her own school.  I am surprised that UPN hasn't publicized this series further.  For me, it was amazing to watch the great Harry Hamlin in action.  I had never seen any of his films or soap opera days, but to see him and his real-life wife in action made a new fan out of me.  With cutting edge Inspector Gadget like objects, Veronica Mars is the hero of a new generation.  Rob Thomas has successfully developed a show that would appeal to both a young and older audience and UPN is just sitting on it.I suggest everyone should go out and purchase this DVD now.  My wife and I zoomed through the entire first season in the course of about three days.  Even until the final episode we could not figure out the entire mystery, and the ending still left us with puzzles on our minds.  Again, this show is perfect.  Looking back I see no flaws, no errors, nothing short of pure, 100% entertainment that will both make you laugh while play with your mind.  In my eyes, Veronica Mars is flawless.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"A long time ago, we used to be friends ...",1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,4434,"['What', 'would', 'get', 'crossed', 'beloved', 'children', 'book', 'Harriet', 'Spy', 'elements', 'CSI', 'as', 'well', 'classic', 'mystery-television', 'program', 'Matlock', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'adding', 'just', 'dash', 'youthful', 'interjection', 'bubbly', 'cauldron', 'would', 'discover', 'flawless', 'television', 'program', 'called', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'small', 'knowledge', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'picked', 'up', 'enormous', 'originality', 'program', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'television', 'time', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'station', 'known', 'UPN', 'could', 'produce', 'anything', 'value', 'was', 'wrong', 'dead', 'wrong', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'creative', 'suspenseful', 'intelligent', 'shows', 'out', 'there', 'may', 'be', 'basing', 'solely', 'first', 'season', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'high', 'energy', 'characters', 'simple', 'yet', 'fun', 'storylines', 'edgy', 'undertones', 'will', 'ever', 'change', 'first', 'season', 'introduced', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'surrounding', 'Neptune', 'High', 'specifically', 'dramatic', 'past', 'one', 'Veronica', 'Mars.Veronica', 'Mars', 'not', 'typical', 'murder/mystery', 'television', 'show', 'program', 'one', 'part', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'one', 'part', 'After-School', 'Special', 'one', 'part', 'My', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'more', 'precision', 'ease', 'have', 'witnessed', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'are', 'led', 'adventure', 'adventure', 'young', 'energetic', 'intelligent', 'lethal', 'combination', 'amateur', 'sleuth', 'named', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'best', 'friend', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'was', 'just', 'murdered', 'father', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Neptune', 'blamed', 'wrong', 'person', 'Now', 'community', 'Hollywood', 'superstars', 'corporate', 'presidents', 'wealthiest', 'individuals', 'shunned', 'family', 'worst', 'part', 'go', 'school', 'children', 'open', 'season', 'Veronica', 'friendless', 'yet', 'determined', 'pursue', 'truth', 'discover', 'real', 'killer', 'best', 'friend.Coupled', 'group', 'individuals', 'do', 'not', 'overact', 'seem', 'grounded', 'characters', 'feel', 'just', 'would', 'meet', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'spend', 'episode', 'episode', 'getting', 'closer', 'truth', 'also', 'getting', 'closer', 'one', 'individuals', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'grow', 'watching', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'see', 'going', 'be', 'decent', 'series', ""n't"", 'fully', 'get', 'involved', 'second', 'disc', 'see', 'power', 'characters', 'story', 'themes', 'one', 'rare', 'television', 'programs', 'where', 'feel', 'connection', 'characters', 'yet', 'trust', 'none', 'Veronica', 'solving', 'mini-mysteries', 'series', 'solely', 'discovering', 'truth', 'Lilly', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'everyone', 'somehow', 'involved', 'truth', 'may', 'be', 'there', 'final', 'episode', 'believe', 'nothing.Veronica', 'Mars', 'minor', 'characters', 'strong', 'central', 'character', 'Veronica', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'glued', 'television', 'strong', 'wit', 'ironclad', 'charm', 'fearless', 'personality', 'truth', 'audience', 'members', 'find', 'rooting', 'entire', 'time', 'show', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'make', 'wish', 'had', 'brains', 'ability', 'Veronica', 'had', 'remember', 'watching', 'show', 'wife', 'saying', 'were', 'airing', 'when', 'was', 'school', 'would', 'see', 'Veronica', 'exceptional', 'role', 'model', 'would', 'want', 'solve', 'crimes/mysteries', 'own', 'school', 'am', 'surprised', 'UPN', ""n't"", 'publicized', 'series', 'further', 'was', 'amazing', 'watch', 'great', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'action', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'films', 'soap', 'opera', 'days', 'see', 'real-life', 'wife', 'action', 'made', 'new', 'fan', 'cutting', 'edge', 'Inspector', 'Gadget', 'objects', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'hero', 'new', 'generation', 'Rob', 'Thomas', 'successfully', 'developed', 'show', 'would', 'appeal', 'young', 'older', 'audience', 'UPN', 'just', 'sitting', 'it.I', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'should', 'go', 'out', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'now', 'wife', 'zoomed', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'course', 'three', 'days', 'Even', 'final', 'episode', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'entire', 'mystery', 'ending', 'still', 'left', 'puzzles', 'minds', 'Again', 'show', 'perfect', 'Looking', 'back', 'see', 'flaws', 'errors', 'nothing', 'short', 'pure', '100', '%', 'entertainment', 'will', 'make', 'play', 'mind', 'eyes', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'flawless.Grade', '*****', '*****']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

Also, in the movie they went to some trouble to &#34;reset&#34; key characters back to their &#34;roots&#34; for no other reason than to probably set up for an additional movie.  Found that very disappointing.  (Can't say more on that without really spoiling the whole thing, so I won't.).What is it?  Well, Veronica Mars is the daughter of one time Sheriff Keith Mars, follows daddy's footsteps in this case, he loses his job as Sheriff and becomes a private investigator, so she does the same (becomes a private investigator.)  All this while in high school.Her best friend is murdered, Dad accused the most popular rich family in the area and fails to prove it and is kicked out of office.So, Ronnie is one of most hated people in school (which changes as the series progresses, so you get a really nice character interaction development thing going on.)Anyone who's had bad memories or needs for funny revenge (think revenge of the nerds) will enjoy this as Veronica catches criminals and solves mysteries (up to and including murder) with extreme competence, a stun gun and a lot of illegal wire tapping.She's fairly well a sarcastic b*itch and sleeps around a lot, jumping from one boyfriend to the other and back again (repeat and hopefully rinse;  At least between interactions.....).Anyway, clever plots, differing levels of story arc;  Some are resolved in a single episode, others carry on 2-3, all the while there is generally a major plot line continuing in the background, likely for the full length of the season.Downside, if you don't buy into the seasons premise... well, you're screwed for the length of the season.Third season focused a lot on rape for example, which is a sore spot to me, so I didn't click real well with it.Anyway, definitely worth a look see if you want some fairly well thought out mysteries.Thinking on it as I write this, I do believe it was the lame way they treated one of my favorite characters in the movie that put me off on this whole thing.Anyway, enjoy.",3,Not your mother's Nancy Drew,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,2203,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'immensely', 'saw', 'whole', '3', 'seasons', 'movie', 'included.3', 'Stars', 'lack', 'rewatchability', 'once', 'know', 'punch', 'line', 'lot', 'oomph', 'Also', 'movie', 'went', 'trouble', '34', 'reset', '34', 'key', 'characters', 'back', '34', 'roots', '34', 'other', 'reason', 'probably', 'set', 'up', 'additional', 'movie', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'really', 'spoiling', 'whole', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Well', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'daughter', 'one', 'time', 'Sheriff', 'Keith', 'Mars', 'daddy', 'footsteps', 'case', 'job', 'Sheriff', 'private', 'investigator', 'same', 'private', 'investigator', 'while', 'high', 'school.Her', 'best', 'friend', 'murdered', 'Dad', 'accused', 'most', 'popular', 'rich', 'family', 'area', 'prove', 'kicked', 'office.So', 'Ronnie', 'one', 'most', 'hated', 'people', 'school', 'series', 'get', 'really', 'nice', 'character', 'interaction', 'development', 'thing', 'going', 'Anyone', 'who', 'had', 'bad', 'memories', 'needs', 'funny', 'revenge', 'think', 'revenge', 'nerds', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Veronica', 'criminals', 'solves', 'mysteries', 'including', 'murder', 'extreme', 'competence', 'stun', 'gun', 'lot', 'illegal', 'wire', 'tapping.She', 'fairly', 'well', 'sarcastic', 'b*itch', 'sleeps', 'lot', 'jumping', 'one', 'boyfriend', 'other', 'back', 'again', 'repeat', 'hopefully', 'rinse', 'least', 'interactions', '..', '.Anyway', 'clever', 'plots', 'differing', 'levels', 'story', 'arc', 'are', 'resolved', 'single', 'episode', 'others', 'carry', '2-3', 'while', 'generally', 'major', 'plot', 'line', 'continuing', 'background', 'likely', 'full', 'length', 'season.Downside', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'seasons', 'premise', 'well', ""'re"", 'screwed', 'length', 'season.Third', 'season', 'focused', 'lot', 'rape', 'example', 'sore', 'spot', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'real', 'well', 'it.Anyway', 'definitely', 'look', 'see', 'want', 'fairly', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'mysteries.Thinking', 'write', 'do', 'believe', 'was', 'lame', 'way', 'treated', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'movie', 'put', 'off', 'whole', 'thing.Anyway', 'enjoy']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

While powerhouse shows like Lost (which deserves the hype it is getting) and Desperate Housewives (which I doubt deserves the hype it's getting) may get all the credit for making the 2004-2005 television season responsible for the return of the scripted show, critics (as well as a handful of loyal fans) never forget to mention Veronica Mars when discussing that topic.Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) used to be a member of the ""in"" crowd at her affluent high school, Neptune High.  Neptune California is one of the richest areas in America (probably something like Orange County, but that area is reserved for The OC), and as Veronica states in the pilot episode, kids who go to Neptune High have parents who are either millionaires or parents that work for millionaires.  Veronica's dad doesn't exactly fit that profile, but he used to be the town sheriff.  That was enough to get her enough status to date Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn) and be best friends with Lily Kane (Amanda Seyfried), the children of the richest man in town, software designer Jake Kane (Kyle Secor).  She also got to hang around with Lily's boyfriend, Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), the son of A-list stars Aaron (Harry Hamlin) and Lynn Echolls (Lisa Rinna, who is actually married to Hamlin in real life).  However, all that changed about a year prior to the beginning of the series, and the people that used to be Veronica's friends now try to have nothing to do with her.  Lily was killed, and Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), who was still the sheriff at the time, concluded that Lily's father Jake was the culprit.  But when a man named Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson) confessed to the killing, the citizens of Neptune were outraged and had Keith replaced by the incompetant Don Lamb (Michael Muhney).  Soon after, Veronica, in an attempt to prove that she was still cool, went to a girl's party.  At some point, someone slipped her a date rape drug, and she woke up the next day without her underwear on.As the series begins, Keith is now a private investigator, and Veronica is in his tutelage.  She helps him with his cases, while taking on a few herself.  She has become cynical towards her classmates and the law system, and she begins to see her old friends for who they really are, especially Logan.  While he was (usually) nice to the people he liked, he was a total jerk to those he didn't like, and he has a special kind of wrath towards Veronica.  Fortunately for Veronica, she has her keen intellect on her side as well as a few new friends who are fellow outcasts.  Wallace Fennel (Percy Dags III) is a new kid whom Veronica helps on his first day at Neptune High.  After that, they become friends and she often has him do case-related work with her.  Eli ""Weevil"" Navarro (Francis Capra) is a biker gang member who learns to respect Veronica, and does some of her dirty work for her.  Finally there is Mac (Tina Majorino, famous for her role in Napoleon Dynamite), who does computer work for Veronica (sadly, she's only in a few episodes, but I hope that they use her more in Season 2).Early on in the season, Veronica discovers evidence that proves the innocence of Abel Koontz, and the driving story arc of the season is her search for Lily's true killer.  However, there are many great and interesting sub-plots throughout the year, as well as stand-alone stories.  The character development is amazing on this show.  As I stated earlier, Logan is a bit of a psychopath, but as the episodes unfold, we learn that there may be a reason for his behavior.  Many times, we think we have a character figured out, only to learn something new and unexpected about them in a few weeks, such as a supposed affair between Jake Kane and Veronica's mom Lianne (Corinne Bohrer), or an explanation to Duncan's erratic behavior.The guest stars on this show are just as strong as the regular cast.  The Aaron Echolls character is one of my favorites, despite the fact that he is a scumbag.  Hamlin plays him so well and gives a lot of depth to a role that, in the wrong hands, could make Aaron Echolls very one-dimensional.  While the producers weren't able to get a lot of huge guest stars, they did get Alyson Hannigan for an episode as Logan's step-sister Trina Echolls, and the results were great.Many people have called this show ""the next Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and I would have to agree with them.  The writing and acting are on par with the amazing BtVS, and of all the shows that have used the theme of either ""girl power"" or ""high school metaphors"" (there's Charmed, Smallville, Kim Possible, and a bunch of others), this is by far the best and its mission statement is the closest to that of Buffy.  The twist is that while the aforementioned shows involve some sort of special powers (witches, Superman, super secret agent with gadgets), Veronica has no powers.  She is an ordinary girl with an extraoridnary mind.  And that is probably one of its greatest strengths; while it aspires to be as great and in the same vein as Buffy, it does not blatantly rip off the premise.As I said at the beginning of this review, the two shows that most people credit for bringing back scripted TV this year were Lost and Desperate Housewives, even though most television critics listed Veronica Mars as just as worthy of that honor.  Sadly, this show didn't get very high ratings, and many people ignored it (I didn't see it until the second-to-last episode of the season, but what do they expect, it's on UPN!).  Fortunately, it won E! Online's annual ""Save Our Show"" poll with a huge margin over the number two show (Arrested Development, which thankfully won a similar poll in USA Today, which probably helped that show get a third season).  I think that, without winning the poll, Veronica Mars would have been cancelled at the end of the season, and that would have been a shame.  Fortunately, it has been renewed, and there were a few cliffhangers in the season finale that I can't wait to see resolved.  This is a great show, and it has something for everyone.  It's definitely worth a look.",5,Make Friends With Veronica Mars,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,6433,"['am', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'when', 'say', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'UPN', 'best', 'show', 'well',

She is plucky, brave, smart, etc etc. I completely enjoyed the character of Veronica and I enjoyed watching the interaction she had between the other characters. The likable characters are easily likable even with their flaws. It is very quick to see in each season the person who is supposed to be wearing the black hat for the season.Each season has an overarching theme or mystery, except for season three which has several mini mysteries. The theme for season one is 'who raped Veronica Mars?'. While she doesn't tackle this issue in every show it is there, lurking in the background.It is very easy to make the comparison between veronica and Nancy Drew. However, the Nancy Drew mysteries do not tackle such adult subjects. In later seasons they address many other adult issues. Drug use, gang membership, dropping out of school, sex are only a few of them. What disturbed me was how many scenes, especially in season three, there were that had two people in bed.If you are opposed to premarital sex, teens having sex and addressing it very frankly then this may not be the show for you. My daughter who is thirteen found season two and season three to be a 'bit much' (her words). Just something to be aware of going into watching this show.Overall though, I completely enjoyed it. The characters were great. I wanted to find out what would happen to them. I can understand why a movie was made as a follow up to this show. I was left hanging and wanted to know how it ended between Veronica and her nonboyfriend boyfriend.Well worth watching. enjoy.",5,"Five stars for this season, Lower for later seasons",1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,1703,"['started', 'watching', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'dinner', 'discussion.It', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'fall', 'love', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'plucky', 'brave', 'smart', 'etc', 'etc', 'completely', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'Veronica', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'interaction', 'had', 'other', 'characters', 'likable', 'characters', 'are', 'easily', 'likable', 'even', 'flaws', 'very', 'quick', 'see', 'season', 'person', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'wearing', 'black', 'hat', 'season.Each', 'season', 'overarching', 'theme', 'mystery', 'season', 'three', 'several', 'mini', 'mysteries', 'theme', 'season', 'one', ""'who"", 'raped', 'Veronica', 'Mars', ""n't"", 'tackle', 'issue', 'show', 'there', 'lurking', 'background.It', 'very', 'easy', 'make', 'comparison', 'veronica', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'However', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'mysteries', 'do', 'not', 'tackle', 'such', 'adult', 'subjects', 'later', 'seasons', 'address', 'many', 'other', 'adult', 'issues', 'Drug', 'use', 'gang', 'membership', 'dropping', 'school', 'sex', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'What', 'disturbed', 'was', 'how', 'many', 'scenes', 'especially', 'season', 'three', 'were', 'had', 'two', 'people', 'bed.If', 'are', 'opposed', 'premarital', 'sex', 'having', 'sex', 'addressing', 'very', 'frankly', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'show', 'daughter', 'who', 'thirteen', 'found', 'season', 'two', 'season', 'three', 'be', ""'bit"", 'much', 'words', 'Just', 'something', 'be', 'aware', 'going', 'watching', 'show.Overall', 'completely', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'were', 'great', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'follow', 'up', 'show', 'was', 'left', 'hanging', 'wanted', 'know', 'how', 'ended', 'Veronica', 'nonboyfriend', 'boyfriend.Well', 'watching', 'enjoy']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

Veronica Mars is the best thing to ever hit UPN in that network's 11 years(not counting when Buffy transfered over, since it was a WB show). Kristen Bell stars as the title character, and she is a major find. What an absolute gem. I doubt the show would be as good if it were someone else. She is Veronica. Just like Sarah Michelle Geller is Buffy. Set in the California town of Neptune, Veronica Mars deals with our young high school heroine solving the towns' biggest mysteries, along with her detective father, Keith Mars(Enrico Collantoni of ""Just Shoot Me"" fame). The biggest mystery of all is the season long story arc. Who killed Veronica's best friend, Lily Kane?. It's a brilliant whodunit wrapped around intiguing, fully dimensional characters with whip smart dialogue, and teriffic humor. Rounding out the show is Veronica's best friend Wallace, Ex-boyfriend and Lily's brother Duncan Kane(Teddy Dunn), school bully Weevil(Francis Capra), and Lily's boyfriend Logan Echolls(Jason Dohring). Harry Hamlin has a season long recurring guest role, and Buffy vet Alyson Hannigan pops up as Logan's sister. Rob Thomas(not THAT Rob Thomas), is a gifted writer with a strong sense of story and detail. The show, as he writes is, is wonderfully fleshed out and visualized. The show having it's own unique and color scheme. The acting is great all around. Dohring is another great find along with Bell. The ""Pilot"" sets everything up so beautifully. It seamlessly brings you up to date, via flashbacks, of what has brought Veronica and her father to the place they are in now, and sets everything up the way it is now. Other top notch episodes(in a season with nary a bad episode)include the finale, ""Leave It To Beaver"", ""A Trip To The Dentist"", and so on. Quite frankly, there's too many to mention here. But back to Bell. She has such an easy way with a scene and a quip, and she has such a relatable beauty to her.

921577,A3KUEXN9M9FOMH,B000A59PMO,billy,"[3, 3]","Veronica Mars ended before it's time.  Killed off by poor ratings and a Pussycat Dolls reality show, VM was one of the smartest and best shows on television during it's three year run.  Like most great shows with a short run, VM will likely only gain in stature as people begin to realize what they were missing.  Complex shows like this are best viewed in DVD format anyway, and it's must that you start at the beginning.VM starts off in the aftermath of  three life changing events for it's title character, played to perfection by Kristen Bell.  Her best friend Lilly Kane was murdered, she was raped at a party, and her mother took off when her father investigated the popular, rich, and influential Kane family.  Keith lost his job as sheriff, and Veronica loses her boyfriend Duncan Kane and all her friends.  She enters her third year of high school as an outcast, working for her PI dad and taking cases from students for extra cash on the side.There are three reasons why this DVD collection is a must own.1.  The storyline.  VM is structured a lot like Buffy, with a mystery of the week and one over reaching storyline.  The mystery of the week stories are generally well done, with a couple that are kind of unbelievable and convoluted.  But the the major mystery of Lilly Kane's death makes this show a compulsive watch.  There are plenty of details and twists that keep your attention and add suspense.2.  The writing.  VM is one of wittiest and funny shows i've seen in a while.  Veronica has a sharp tongue and all of her friends are also deadly clever, Logan Ecchols in particular.  You'll be quoting lines for a while.3.  The performances.  Kristen Bell is spot on as Veronica.  Her character is very nuanced.  She manages to be tough, indepedent, loving, and fragile all at the same time.  It's no wonder why she's such a hot commodity now.  Enrico Colantoni is great as Keith Mars, Veronica's father, and former sheriff turned PI.  The loving relationship between Veronica and Keith is one of the best parts of the show.  One of the most surprising characters is Logan, a son of a famous movie star who seems to be nothing but a anti-social jerk, but turns out to a much more complex and emotional character than he appears.  That's not even mentioning Percy Daggs and Francis Capra, both are great as Wallace and Weevil respectively.But that being said, VM is not perfect.  There are plenty of moments that seem downright convienent and unbelievable.  The first thing that springs to mind is Wallace working in the attendance office.  Thank goodness for that, because without Wallace Veronica would not have access to countless permanent records.  I'm surprised she never got caught with one because she basically reads them out in the open.  Second is the flashback scenes.  During the flashback scenes Veronica dresses like a librarian, has long hair, and is basically a typical teenage girl.  But in a year she turns from ditzy blonde in to a female Phillip Marlowe.  It's a little unbelievable.But honestly, those complaints really don't matter because the good points far outweigh the bad.  If your a fan of Buffy, or just good TV, pick this DVD set up.  It's addicting.  The next thing you know you'll have watched all of these episodes and you'll be fiending for season two.",5,The Best Season of a Great Show,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,3301,"['Veronica', 'Mars', 'ended', 'time', 'Killed', 'off', 'poor', 'ratings', 'Pussycat', 'Dolls', 'reality', 'show', 'VM', 'was', 'one', 'smartest', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'three', 'year', 'run', 'most', 'great', 'shows', 'short', 'run', 'VM', 'will', 'likely', 'only', 'gain', 'stature', 'people', 'begin', 'realize', 'what', 'were', 'missing', 'Complex', 'shows', 'are', 'best', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'format', 'anyway', 'must', 'start', 'beginning.VM', 'aftermath', 'three', 'life', 'changing', 'events', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'perfection', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'best', 'friend', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'was', 'murdered', 'was', 'raped', 'party', 'mother', 'took', 'off', 'when', 'father', 'investigated', 'popular', 'rich', 'influential', 'Kane', 'family', 'Keith', 'lost', 'job', 'sheriff', 'Veronica', 'boyfriend', 'Duncan', 'Kane', 'friends', 'third', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'outcast', 'working', 'PI', 'dad', 'taking', 'cases', 'students', 'extra', 'cash', 'side.There', 'are', 'three', 'reasons', 'why', 'DVD', 'collection', 'must', 'own.1', 'storyline', 'VM', 'structured', 'lot', 'Buffy', 'mystery', 'week', 'one', 'reaching', 'storyline', 'mystery', 'week', 'stories', 'are', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'couple', 'are', 'kind', 'unbelievable', 'convoluted', 'major', 'mystery', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'death', 'show', 'compulsive', 'watch', 'are', 'plenty', 'details', 'twists', 'keep', 'attention', 'add', 'suspense.2', 'writing', 'VM', 'one', 'wittiest', 'funny', 'shows', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Veronica', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'deadly', 'clever', 'Logan', 'Ecchols', 'particular', ""'ll"", 'be', 'quoting', 'lines', 'while.3', 'performances', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'spot', 'Veronica', 'character', 'very', 'nuanced', 'be', 'tough', 'indepedent', 'loving', 'fragile', 'same', 'time', 'wonder', 'why', 'such', 'hot', 'commodity', 'now', 'Enrico', 'Colantoni', 'great', 'Keith', 'Mars', 'Veronica', 'father', 'former', 'sheriff', 'turned', 'PI', 'loving', 'relationship', 'Veronica', 'Keith', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'show', 'One', 'most', 'surprising', 'characters', 'Logan', 'son', 'famous', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'be', 'nothing', 'anti-social', 'jerk', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'emotional', 'character', 'not', 'even', 'mentioning', 'Percy', 'Daggs', 'Francis', 'Capra', 'are', 'great', 'Wallace', 'Weevil', 'respectively.But', 'being', 'said', 'VM', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'plenty', 'moments', 'seem', 'downright', 'convienent', 'unbelievable', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'Wallace', 'working', 'attendance', 'office', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Wallace', 'Veronica', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'access', 'countless', 'permanent', 'records', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'never', 'got', 'caught', 'one', 'basically', 'out', 'open', 'Second', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'Veronica', 'librarian', 'long', 'hair', 'basically', 'typical', 'teenage', 'girl', 'year', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'female', 'Phillip', 'Marlowe', 'little', 'unbelievable.But', 'honestly', 'complaints', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'good', 'points', 'far', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'fan', 'Buffy', 'just', 'good', 'TV', 'pick', 'DVD', 'set', 'up', 'addicting', 'next', 'thing', 'know', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watched', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fiending', 'season', 'two']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

921582,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000A59PMO,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[20, 180]","Veronica Mars, a teenager at a high school where the wealthy send their teens, is helping solve private investigations through her father's PI business (he's also the former Sheriff of the area.) They live in a fictitious town known as Neptune, California.On top of this, Veronica has to deal with the strife of her classmates (who are much better off than herself), the fact that she comes from a broken home (her mother left her father and her), and try to avoid the local turf wars in her corner of the world.Sounds like a winner, doesn't it?But there are several problems with the basic premise of this series that I just couldn't get my mind around.First (and DEFINITELY foremost) is that the children of millionaires DO NOT go to public schools. They go to private schools. Why would they mingle with the lower classes when they don't have to? The simple answer is that they never would.Secondly, there were a bunch of little things that could've been fixed but weren't. For instance, Veronica gets the headlights of her car bashed in by a rich punk. Then the next scene shows her driving down the street at night ...WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON! Some might argue that she got them fixed, but let's remember that she and her father are not that well off.Thirdly, Sheriffs are not assigned to ""towns""; they patrol and enforce the law in counties. And Neptune is a city/town. Little things like this shows me how poorly the script writers researched various aspects for the show.

921587,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000A59PMO,Brett Corkins,"[7, 8]","Prior to seeing this DVD collection nonstop at every store I went to I wasn't at all familiar with it. By the cover I simply dismissed it as another teen drama next to the other countless drones on TV today. But with each new glance at the box I got more curious as to why it was popular so I read a few reviews. Each one said nothing but good things and the basic plot was pretty intriguing. I eventually bought it and I must say that next to Scrubs, this is my new favorite show on TV now. Sure a teen detective sounds a bit corny but when you add that she is simply helping her dad, who is a P.I., it doesn't sound quite so far out. I was extremely happy to see that they casted Enrico Colantoni of Just Shoot Me fame. I always thought he'd be good in a serious part with comedic touches, and he delivers ten fold as Keith Mars, Veronica's dad. I might add that the chemistry between the two of them is as if they're actually related. As for the rest of the cast, aside from rather emotionless Teddy Dunn, the casting was flawless. Percy Daggs III is perfect as the newbie Wallace, Jason Dohring has that smart alleck air to him as Logan, and Francis Capra as the biker gang leader Weevil is pretty funny. The standout in the cast is without a doubt Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars. Her acting is spot on for each and every scene and passes off as a detective very well.What I really like about this show is that there's two long running mysteries with tons of side projects in each episode. The death of Veronica's friend Lilly being the main focus of the two main mysteries. What's admirable is that they never give up too much information about either case in any episode, it keeps you guessing about what might happen next.Overall I can't complain a bit about this set or show. The extras are up to par with other TV DVDs but the main focus will always be on the show itself. The acting is a major reason this show is good, but the dialogue is what sets it apart from most other shows. You'll be going along fairly serious and then there'll be a part that just makes you laugh. Take the scene in which Veronica is acting like a girl who just discovered she's pregnant in order to see who charged a room to a credit card all while her dad is throwing some big over the top fit about finding out who got his daughter pregnant, that is gold right there. Basically this show has a bit of everything, romance, mystery, comedy, drama, it's all there. So I'm sure everyone will find one quality to like about it.",5,"A great show offered by UPN, surprisingly enough",1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2510,"['Prior', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'collection', 'nonstop', 'store', 'went', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'cover', 'simply', 'dismissed', 'teen', 'drama', 'other', 'countless', 'drones', 'TV', 'today', 'new', 'glance', 'box', 'got', 'more', 'curious', 'why', 'was', 'popular', 'so', 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'one', 'said', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'basic', 'plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'eventually', 'bought', 'must', 'say', 'next', 'Scrubs', 'new', 'favorite', 'show', 'TV', 'now', 'Sure', 'teen', 'detective', 'bit', 'corny', 'when', 'add', 'simply', 'helping', 'dad', 'who', 'P.I.', ""n't"", 'sound', 'quite', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'extremely', 'happy', 'see', 'casted', 'Enrico', 'Colantoni', 'Just', 'Shoot', 'Me', 'fame', 'always', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'good', 'serious', 'part', 'comedic', 'touches', 'ten', 'fold', 'Keith', 'Mars', 'Veronica', 'dad', 'might', 'add', 'chemistry', 'two', ""'re"", 'actually', 'related', 'rest', 'cast', 'aside', 'rather', 'emotionless', 'Teddy', 'Dunn', 'casting', 'was', 'flawless', 'Percy', 'Daggs', 'III', 'perfect', 'newbie', 'Wallace', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'smart', 'alleck', 'air', 'Logan', 'Francis', 'Capra', 'biker', 'gang', 'leader', 'Weevil', 'pretty', 'funny', 'standout', 'cast', 'doubt', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'acting', 'spot', 'scene', 'off', 'detective', 'very', 'well.What', 'really', 'like', 'show', 'two', 'long', 'running', 'mysteries', 'tons', 'side', 'projects', 'episode', 'death', 'Veronica', 'friend', 'Lilly', 'being', 'main', 'focus', 'two', 'main', 'mysteries', 'What', 'admirable', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'case', 'episode', 'guessing', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'next.Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'bit', 'set', 'show', 'extras', 'are', 'up', 'par', 'other', 'TV', 'DVDs', 'main', 'focus', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'show', 'acting', 'major', 'reason', 'show', 'good', 'dialogue', 'what', 'apart', 'most', 'other', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'be', 'going', 'fairly', 'serious', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'part', 'just', 'laugh', 'Take', 'scene', 'Veronica', 'acting', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'discovered', 'pregnant', 'order', 'see', 'who', 'charged', 'room', 'credit', 'card', 'dad', 'throwing', 'big', 'top', 'fit', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'got', 'daughter', 'pregnant', 'gold', 'right', 'there', 'Basically', 'show', 'bit', 'everything', 'romance', 'mystery', 'comedy', 'drama', 'there', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everyone', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'quality', 'like']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

It is Jake who Veronica's dad pursues as the killer of Lilly. He's the local sheriff, but it's a position he doesn't hold much longer when the Kane's fortune and influence force him from his job. The ensuing scandal  breaks up the Mars family. Ultimately Veronica and her dad are forced to go it alone. They stay afloat by manning a small detective agency in town. Veronica goes from popular to outcast as her life and status falls apart. A late night party seals her reputation as the high school tramp, a party that Veronica has very little memory of.Through out the season Veronica redefines herself as she moves from case to case, often working for the very students who shun her. Her office is the high school girls bathroom and her best friend is her smarts, an ability that keeps her one step ahead of  her rivals.Who killed Lilly Kane? Where's Veronica's mom? What really happened at that party? These are just a few of the mysteries Veronica confronts through the first season of this wonderfully crafted show.The acting is far above average from what one might expect in a weekly TV show. Enrico Colantoni , Veronica's dad, is barely recognizable from his days on ""Just Shoot Me"". Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, and Harry Hamlin also shine in their well defined roles. The writing too is more than we deserve. It is clever and full of wit.  Only twice was I able to solve the mysteries presented by the show before Veronica, and then only by a few seconds. The themes that the show explores, class structure and teen angst being the most predominate, are familiar but fresh. This is more that just ""90210"" meets ""Columbo"". It is not a hybrid show, though it's easy to describe it as one.

921614,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000A59PMO,Chris Kennison,"[4, 4]","As great of a show as C.S.I. is, its formulaic method of storytelling makes it, in my opinion, just a MURDER SHE WROTE for the 21st century. Each week there's a murder, each week the murder is solved (WOW, if it were only true in real life), and each week the murders get crazier and more bizarre because after 6 seasons... they have to keep thinking up new ways to kill people. Then there's the well deserved boffo ratings.Which brings me to VERONICA MARS... would Veronica Mars have those kind of ratings if it were on a more widely viewed and more widely dispersed affiliate network? I'm not sure. You have to be willing to commit. The show is more like real life. The who-dunnits aren't so cut and dry.The star of the show Kristen Bell, plays VERONICA MARS, a seventeen year-old Nancy Drewish super-sleuth. Using everything in her power to solve small scale crimes, like finding a missing dog, or finding out who stole the money from a friendly poker game, or even going a little larger and finding missing persons or getting to the bottom of sexual harrasment charges. Yet, you care about these things as if they were the most important thing in the WORLD... because they are... to Veronica.All the while, Veronica, in the back of her mind is treading into areas that may very well be more than she can chew, like why her mother left them and vanished without a trace, and what she may have to do with the murder of her best friend, and the fact that the man sitting in jail for the murder of her best friend is looking more and more innocent and why the parents of her ex-boyfriend are possibly involved in the cover up, and why her ex-boyfriend may be closer to her than she ever imagined, and why she woke up in a strange bed at a party one year ago with her panties off and no recollection of how she got there.It's all very complex and engaging and wonderfully addicting and creative. Watching the show reminds you of how complex the world is and how murders aren't solved in one episode and that just because the T.V. tells you that a murder is solved, doesn't mean it is. Money is power, power is control and control is usually hiding something.Which brings me back to my original point. VERONICA MARS is probably the most intriguing, engaging and most well-written show on television, but it is hiding away on the rarely-seen UPN network... We don't have a UPN affiliate where I live... and it's not even available VIA SATELLITE... that is what makes these DVD release so fantastic.I wanted to watch this show so bad, so I asked for it for Christmas. My fiance watched them in 3 days... cried, laughed, gasped and cooed about how wonderful the show is.

921615,A2QHYTS231GJB3,B000A59PMO,Christie W.,"[1, 2]","I have only recently gotten into Veronica Mars.  I happened to catch most of the third (and last) season and have now rented and seen the first two.  I was disappointed to hear that it has been cancelled.  It's a very unique, witty, and highly addictive series.  The first season introduces us to sassy Veronica who has recently been unceremoniously dumped by her high-class boyfriend Duncan; her best friend, Lilly, has been murdered; her father was ousted as sheriff; and she was sexually assaulted.  Geez!!That's a LOT for anyone to deal with.She's going into her junior year of high school pretty much alone, an outcast from the rest of her classmates.  That is until Wallace shows up, a new kid to Neptune- he isn't aware of her ""sordid"" past and comes to like Veronica for who she really is.  The chemistry between Veronica and Wallace is fun to watch- they really come off as great friends, and show a lot of spark and mischief in just a twinkle of the eye.  The same is true with Veronica and her father, Keith, now a private investigator.  They have a very unique father-daughter relationship.  I'm kinda jealous... They have great rapport- their conversations are always fun, playfully combative and witty banter, the dad is funny/silly/goofball but ultimately cares for and protects Veronica.The season is a fun, roller coaster ride of mystery, intrigue, romance, friendship, and ""normal"" high school drama.  My one complaint is how something is mentioned or happens and then is not resolved (or even brought up again) until a few episodes later.  The season ends on a very suspenseful, stressful, and hugely climactic note.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on season two.  A wonderfully entertaining show that unfortunately was cut short way too soon.It's amazing how much can happen from four little words- ""I need your help"" and how many times Veronica hears them.  But also how many times Wallace (who works in the school office) hears ""I need a favor."" lol...Don't miss out!

While the murder/rape are the main season arcs, there's also little cases peppered throughout the season such as the kidnapping of a mascot, blackmail and parental disappearances.It's strange but looking back on the season, I actually at times forgot what was in each episode. Sure I remember that scene where Veronica found out some important thing but for the life of me I couldn't tell you what episode it was. So in a weird way the show benefits from being watched start to finish but it's not like random click and go where you can watch whatever episode you felt like seeing. It's not a problem for the show but it is something I noticed, as well as with the second season.Despite the fact that there's a lot of main characters, there's not a whole lot of development for them save a couple. While I'm not attacking their acting abilities, the Wallace and Duncan characters seem kind of bland. Best friend and former ex respectively, you'd think there'd be a lot more time spent getting to know them and get backstory but they're mainly there to serve the plot at that time. However of course we have Kristen Bell as the titular character, smart and sassy yet emotional. Jason Dohring is quite the one-liner man has he's quite the likable and charismatic guy Logan and Enrico Colantoli is arguably one of the best TV dad's who can be wise-cracking and caring yet tough and protective without being overbearing.While the main arc of the murder is intriguing, the way it's presented is that it doesn't have that kind of rising action aspect of storytelling where you feel things starting to get more fast paced and climactic, instead saving it for the big finale. While the series doesn't limp towards the last episode for the season, it does feel like the episodes don't start to get compelling as you're going along but rather the feeling that just the fact you're nearing the end is compelling, not the unfolding of the story.While it does look like I have a problem with this season, it's actually cause I mainly said negatives. It's a very intriguing and addictive show although I don't like its free-reign writing. Certain characters almost turn evil/good at the drop of a hat while the rape storyline which was ""solved"" here, is actually debunked and we find out the truth. However, you should definately pick this one up.",5,An excellent first season,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,3220,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'gotten', 'show', 'as', 'soon', 'premiered', 'Literally', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'aired', 'long', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'word', 'mouth', 'find', 'out', 'other', 'ones', 'How', 'did', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'come', 'out', 'Mainly', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Lost', 'Smallville', ""'m"", 'already', 'Due', 'non-supply', 'demand', 'issue', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'season', '1', 'got', 'season', '2', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'season', '1', 'pretty', 'strong', 'season', 'marred', 'probably', 'sense', 'build-up.Taking', 'place', 'town', 'called', 'Neptune', 'California', 'high', 'school', 'student/super-sleuth', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'not', 'having', 'good', 'year', 'best', 'friend', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'was', 'murdered', 'dad', 'Keith', 'Mars', 'sheriff', 'time', 'had', 'job', 'taken', 'away', 'when', 'went', 'Lilly', 'father', 'suspect', 'Veronica', 'had', 'been', 'drugged', 'raped', 'party', 'murder/rape', 'are', 'main', 'season', 'arcs', 'also', 'little', 'cases', 'peppered', 'season', 'such', 'kidnapping', 'mascot', 'blackmail', 'parental', 'disappearances.It', 'strange', 'looking', 'back', 'season', 'actually', 'times', 'forgot', 'what', 'was', 'episode', 'Sure', 'remember', 'scene', 'where', 'Veronica', 'found', 'out', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'episode', 'was', 'So', 'weird', 'way', 'show', 'benefits', 'being', 'watched', 'start', 'finish', 'not', 'like', 'random', 'click', 'go', 'where', 'can', 'watch', 'episode', 'felt', 'seeing', 'not', 'problem', 'show', 'something', 'noticed', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'fact', 'lot', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'development', 'save', 'couple', ""'m"", 'not', 'attacking', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Wallace', 'Duncan', 'characters', 'seem', 'kind', 'bland', 'Best', 'friend', 'former', 'ex', 'respectively', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'getting', 'know', 'get', 'backstory', ""'re"", 'mainly', 'there', 'serve', 'plot', 'time', 'However', 'course', 'have', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'titular', 'character', 'smart', 'sassy', 'yet', 'emotional', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'quite', 'one-liner', 'man', 'quite', 'likable', 'charismatic', 'guy', 'Logan', 'Enrico', 'Colantoli', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'dad', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'wise-cracking', 'caring', 'yet', 'tough', 'protective', 'being', 'main', 'arc', 'murder', 'intriguing', 'way', 'presented', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'rising', 'action', 'aspect', 'storytelling', 'where', 'feel', 'things', 'starting', 'get', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'climactic', 'instead', 'saving', 'big', 'finale', 'series', ""n't"", 'limp', 'towards', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'feel', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'get', 'compelling', ""'re"", 'going', 'along', 'rather', 'feeling', 'just', 'fact', ""'re"", 'nearing', 'end', 'compelling', 'not', 'unfolding', 'story.While', 'look', 'have', 'problem', 'season', 'actually', 'cause', 'mainly', 'said', 'negatives', 'very', 'intriguing', 'addictive', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'free-reign', 'writing', 'Certain', 'characters', 'almost', 'turn', 'evil/good', 'drop', 'hat', 'rape', 'storyline', 'was', 'solved', 'here', 'actually', 'debunked', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'However', 'should', 'definately', 'pick', 'one', 'up']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

The first season was clever and well timed, the acting is first rate, and nothing was &#34;saccharine&#34; or too cutesey, which makes me wonder why the general public wasn't interested in keeping this series in production. Perhaps there is a bit of the &#34;Nancy Drew&#34; concept, plus this is very complicated plot lines that need full attention to the story in progress, and despite the premise of taking place in a high school, perhaps the general viewing public was more interested in the newer ideas that came along at the same time, i.e. reality shows etc. Perhaps it was deemed to be tame at that time.

921630,A14FSB9QNWMKP1,B000A59PMO,"Daniel Fazekas ""fds""","[9, 10]","Rob Thomas envisioned a detective story with a dark, noir feel, while the studio mainly wanted to have a high school drama. What we ended up with is Veronica Mars, often said to be targeted at the young female demographic. Another common comparison says it's the ""new Buffy.""So what's a guy like myself, well past his teens and who never saw a single episode of Buffy, doing here? Frankly, all the narrow statements on who the target demographic and intended audience are supposed to be are only doing a great disservice to the show.It's got a far more general appeal: if you simply like quality shows, witty dialog, fun and mystery, or a good cast, you're bound to like it. It took a lot of glowing recommendations from TV critics and the likes of Joss Whedon to finally convince me to give it a chance, and I'm glad I did.The show's strongest point is probably the acting. Kristen Bell as the titular character does some phenomenal work, and Enrico Colantoni in the role of her father is also a delight to watch. Unbelievable how both of them got overlooked by the Emmys, not even getting a nomination. On the other hand, the show's weakness lies in it being ambitiously grounded in reality. Other than it taking place in the fictional small town of Neptune, it's all meant to be present-day real world stuff. This makes it harder to suspend disbelief if you spot things which are technologically impossible or silly, or violate standard court and police procedures. My recommendation is to avoid most of the extremely nit-picky recaps and forum discussions all around the 'net, lest they unnecessarily point out things you would've never noticed anyway, and lessen your enjoyment.This DVD set release is a mixed bag. It's got some slick design and packaging, all the basic necessities. What it doesn't really have are extras and bonus features. You get 22 minutes of deleted scenes, all jumbled together in one continuous clip, plus one and a half minutes more at the start of the Pilot episode. And that is all. The dearth of extras was explained to be a conscious decision of trying to get the DVD out as early as possible, in order to let new viewers - such as myself - catch up with the story thus far. This, I can support and understand, yet can't help but feel disappointed that it isn't reflected in the selling price at all. In fact, this was easily the most expensive ""TV on DVD"" that I've bought in the past several months. Was it worth it? I'd say yes, and the purchase hopefully also serves as a vote for the network to pick Veronica Mars up for a third season.One final note. While all packaging and information claims this as limited to Region 1 only, all six discs were actually formatted as playable in Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4 as well, which should make it playable almost anywhere in the world (5 and 6 excluded) without any hassle.

921635,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B000A59PMO,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[13, 14]","For those looking for the true heir to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of a sharp script and snappy dialogue look no further than the UPN show Veronica Mars. Not since Sunnydale dropped into a deep chasm has television seen such a fabulous ensemble of talented young actors deliver such inventive dialogue in intelligent, darkly humorously directed fare.In what is possibly one of the best shows on television today Veronica Mars first season aired in fall 2004 and fast developed a devoted fan following.For me Tuesday nights became the most anticipated TV night of the week and I could not get enough of the show or its hot star Kristen Bell. It quickly shot up the rankings on my TiVo season pass where it now sits at number one and my Kristen Bell TiVo wish-list was set to auto-record so I would not miss any program in which she was featured. I remember the anger when my local UPN station decided to air a baseball game instead of one episode - never have I felt more like putting pen to paper to express my displeasure with a programming decision.So what is this show that induces such passion? It's a detective show, no it's a romantic drama, or is it a dark comedy? Well, in reality it is all of this and more. Set in the California city of Neptune, it paints the picture of a society split between the have's such as the rich Kane family or movie star Aaron Echoll's wife and children and the have-nots (notably title character Veronica Mars and her friends Wallace and Weevil).Veronica is the daughter of Keith Mars, the former Sheriff, who was ousted after accusing millionaire software businessman Jake Kane of murdering his daughter (and Veronica's best friend) Lilly.Now a private detective Keith is still investigating the murder and determined in his conviction that the man in jail for the murder is innocent. He is supported in this belief by his daughter a fact which has made her a social outcast from the popular clique to which she once belonged.The murder-mystery and the mystery to a rape that occurred before the show opens both serve as the season-long story arc. But, as Veronica continues her investigation each episode involves the investigation into a lesser mystery. From stolen poker winnings to missing school mascots to  missing dogs and busting a fake ID card ring, Veronica (with the help of Wallace, Mac and assorted other misfits) must navigate a world of secret societies, shady Kane security personnel and a largely hostile school environment.In addition to the great script the other strength of the show is in assembling a wonderful ensemble of young actors. Led by Kristen Bell who as Veronica outdo's Buffy in the dry humor department, and ably supported by Canadian actor Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, the two really display a true father-daughter affection for each other which apparently was true off-screen as well. In addition to this dynamic there is also Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend (and cohort in her investigations) Wallace. Teddy Dunn plays tortured with some secret that he struggles to keep hidden as Veronica's ex-boyfriend Duncan Kane and Jason Dohring appears as Logan, the bad-boy rich kid son of actor Aaron (who is played by Harry Hamlin of LA Law and Clash of the Titans fame). Completing the talented young cast is Francis Capra as biker bad-boy Weevil.Not to spoil the ending of the show for anyone who missed it on its initial run over fall 2004 to spring 2005 or the reruns of select episodes over the summer of 2005, this show needs to be seen to be believed. Sure I am a diehard fan of the show, but I defy any viewer not to became charmed by the drama, romance, humor and well drawn characters. Yes, the mysteries are solved but a lot of the fun comes in the journey towards those last two episodes of the season.On this DVD set of six discs we are promised deleted scenes, a gag reel and extended takes.

Like BtVS, Mars is almost *too* clever at times, and the show almost crosses from being hip to being trendy, but by mid-season the show knows exactly what it's doing and doesn't look back.Running through the season is a strong plotline wherein Veronica tries to solve the murder of a friend of hers (and thereby restore her discredited father's reputation). The last few episodes are filled with revelations, and the finale is an absolute thriller.The regular cast is excellent, especially the father (Enrico Colantoni) and social-nemesis Logan (Jason Dohring) who winds up practically stealing the show. True to its chic-nature, there's also some inspired stunt casting throughout the series, including in this first season Paris Hilton and Alyson Hannigan.All-in-all, Veronica Mars is a top notch program.

I don't think people near the age of 40 (like me) are allowed to watch that network.After hearing my neighbor, a colleague and a relative talking about the show all in the same week, I decided I needed to buy Season One on DVD.  The pilot was cute enough, with clever plot twists and some satisfying resolutions to the conflicts that arose.TV series tend to do one of two things following their pilots -- they get worse or they get better.  Very few seem to be able to accomplish the latter.  VERONICA MARS is one that actually continued to get better throughout the entire first season.  Characters developed, plots became more compelling, and the writers seemed to find a rhythm that really works for the show.Any while it does deal a lot with the angst of teenage life (high school, boyfriends, popularity, and so on), it also deals with far more adult subjects like rape, coping with death, abandonment issues and single parenting.Each episode has Veronica solving little mysteries for friends or schoolmates, but running throughout the entire season are questions about who killed her best friend Lily, and what happened to Veronica's mother, who disappeared shortly after Lily's death.  These season-long story arcs owe a lot to shows like ALIAS and 24, and they keep VERONICA MARS nearly as compelling as those shows.So even if you think this is a ""teenage"" show, I'd recommend that you give it a chance.

She never fails to deliver a quick witted response to peoples slanders against her.  There is no case to hard, no villain to horrific, no relationship too broken to knock her off her feet.  The show is basically about a murder involving her best friend.  The mystery holds well, as do all the cases-of-the-week which never fail to involve great amounts of thought, no matter how silly the are.  The writing is as sharp as Kristen Bell's performance.  She can go from innocent teen one moment, to sarcastic know it all the next, to bubble head the next, to broken hearted girl on her own with an amazing ease.  The only problem with the show in general are the relationship plot lines.Beware of spoiler:The Logan, Duncan, police man triangle is very weak, especially the break up scenes with the police man.  They way that is resolved makes this show almost of 4 star show.  I have never in my life seen such a terrible resolve.  On the other hand, the Logan relationship is bizarre and never really is believable.  Veronica and Logan have chemistry, but not in a romantic way.  Their chemistry is from the contestant arguing.  Duncan and Veronica have a mild but believable chemistry.  The policeman, who gets very little screen time, seems to be the one that she has the most chemistry with, making is almost impossible to believe that she would dump him.end of spoilerwith that downfall, the show still gets a five stars because of the great season finale.  The guilty person is not the one I would have ever thought it was, and the cliff hanger, while a little set-up-for-next-seasons-mystery less, is not all that bad.

I usually give new shows 2 - 3 episodes to draw me in but this show kept my attention from the outset - a high school junior trying to solve her best friend's murder.Kristen Bell was exceptional in this role and I rooted for this character who not only lost her best friend but her mother, boyfriend and people she thought were her friends; she was raped and had to deal with ostracism at school. Anchoring the show is the true chemistry between the actors and the writing - the dialogue on this show is witty and the pacing of the show kept my attention I didn't feel let down or that episodes dragged during mid-season.I also have to commend a few of the co-stars who contributed to this almost magical season namely: Enrico Colantoni as Veronica's father - the disgraced sheriff who is adjusting to life without his job or wife; Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls - best friend of Veronica's ex who enjoys tormenting her; Francis Capra as Weevil - leader of a gang who has an uneasy ""friendship"" with Veronica and Percy Daggs as Wallace Fennel - a new student who is befriended by Veronica.As an older viewer who sometimes shuns shows that I feel are aimed towards teens or those in their 20's, I'm glad that I didn't dismiss this show and I have to admit that it has high replay value.

However, it is so much more than the old ""Nancy Drew"" TV series of the 1970's. This is an intelligent and funny TV series that, although targeted at a teenage audience, is smart enough to interest and entertain adults. The main plot line of this season centres on the murder of Veronica's best friend Lily Kane (Laura Palmer for the next generation), with other continuing storylines and single episode stories along the way, to keep the audience interested... and this definitely maintained my interest. By the final episode, I found myself comparing this series favourably to the much acclaimed ""Damages"", and when Lily's killer was finally revealed, I felt even more satisfied than I did at the end of ""Damages"".

921698,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000A59PMO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Ah, where to start? It's not easy to pigeonhole Veronica Mars, the series. This quirky show from UPN contains elements of the procedural detective mystery, high school/family drama, and the soap opera show, as well as a season-long conspiracy plotline. While this series was engrossing to watch on a televised schedule, this 6-dvd package enriches the viewing experience even more. Not only are the dvds not encumbered with commercials, but there's a more defined sense of immediacy and coherence as you watch multiple episodes in a row, allowing you to soak in more of the show's nuances and plot progressions. The viewer profits from the show's tendency to smoothly mesh ongoing story arcs from episode to episode, building up the season's main storyline and adding more texture to the lesser subplots. Veronica Mars boasts a continuing, season-long murder mystery, great acting and plotting, and comprehensive character development. The series debut and ensuing shows incorporate effective flashback scenes, chronicling Veronica's prior Cinderella life from a year before, which culminate with the shocking murder of her best friend Lilly Kane and Veronica's resulting ostracism by her high school peers.Veronica (Kristen Bell) becomes an assistant to her ex-sheriff father, Keith Mars (the awesome Enrico Colantoni), in his newly formed private detective agency, and she proves to be a resourceful and dogged clue chaser in her own right. She hasn't at all forgotten the brutal slaying of her best friend and means to ultimately rip apart that convoluted veil of conspiracy. Every episode seems to introduce new clues to Lilly's death and progressively finds our sleuth inching ever closer to unearthing the murderer (making it hard for you to miss even one show). The payoff is in Season One's final episode, in which the mystery of Lilly's murder is finally resolved. Meanwhile, she handles the more mundane cases involving credit card fraud, missing persons, a missing high school parrot mascot, a runaway dog, a stolen BMW, a cult, etc. All that, as she continues to transition from living the life of the haves to the life of the have-nots, and while also suffering the woes and pressures of high school life.The show is elevated with that rare grouping of brilliant writing, sensitive directing, and gifted acting. The acting, in particular, is augmented by the talents of Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Jason Dohring. I find their respective characters to be the most developed and the most intriguing. The father-daughter relationship between Veronica and her cool dad Keith is truly wonderful to behold and so enjoyable to watch. And, while I initially disliked the angry, sarcastic, mean-spirited Logan Echolls, Jason Dohring invests his role with so many layers that he very quickly becomes one of the show's most interesting characters. Besides, Dohring has a screen presence that cannot be denied, although he does look like a bitter Peyton Manning. Kristen Bell, of course, propels the show. She effortlessly delivers with a plucky and ironic take on her role that makes Veronica Mars seem simultaneously tough and vulnerable, while being also incredibly resourceful, smart, and sexy. Yeah, I know - that's a lot of adjectives, but they all fit, yes? Even the lesser characters are given ample spotlight. Percy Daggs III (Wallace, Veronica's best bud), Francis Capra (Weevil, likable thug from the wrong side of town), and Harry Hamlin (Aaron Echolls, Logan's movie star dad) all make hefty contributions. But, with all the wrenching, dramatic scenes that went on in this season, my favorite moment still is Veronica doing karaoke, which is a nod to Kristen Bell's multi-faceted skills.Not much in the way of special features here: a tiny booklet summarizing the Season One episodes, over 20 minutes of unaired scenes, and an extended version of the pilot episode with an unaired opening sequence.So, what do we have in the Veronica Mars series? Well, it offers savage high school politics and power plays, the juxtaposed lifestyles of the priveleged and the not-so-priveleged, topical teenager problems, interesting subplots, sparkling dialogue, wicked one-liners, and rich, perfectly nuanced performances. It also offers a young girl who had been kicked to the curb but who stands up for herself and her father and who will never take flak from anyone. Following in the footsteps of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of its edgy high school sensibilities (with Bell matching Sarah Michelle Gellar in the petite, cute, and dry-humored heroine department) and borrowing from David Lynch in its prevailing Twin Peaks-styled mystery, Veronica Mars: The Complete First Season is addictive watching, with several messages to impart. And I even like the theme song.",5,"""A long time ago, we used to be friends"",",1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,4783,"['Ah', 'where', 'start', 'not', 'easy', 'pigeonhole', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'series',

She is a great character because she is easy to relate to and fun to watch. Some of the other characters are boring and weak to watch.My only complaint about this show is that it is inconsistant.  If an episode is good, then it is phenominal.  But inbetween the great episodes there are quite a few that aren't even worth watching.The story starts by introducing Veronica.  She talks about how she was raped the previous year and how her best friend was murdered.  Also, her mother ran out on her.  The season goes on to solve these mysteries along with other mini-mysteries.The best part of this show is the flashbacks.  They go back to show Lily (the friend) and many other things.  It is a great and original way to show how everything happened.Overall, it is an awesome show, but it does have many weak points.

I took the plunge out of curiosity and season one surprised me.  The show is certainly not high brow entertainment.  If you were a Twins Peaks fan this show probably isn't your cup of tea.  Think more along the lines of one of the CSI franchises, though the plots are quirkier and more believable.  Like any CSI episode, however, the plots are predictable, the characters relatively simple, and the resolution of each episode's criminal riddle happens in a brief rush at the end of the show.  Despite that, the show is still entertaining.  Much of that credit goes to Kristin Bell, who plays the lead character with surprising skill.  She manages to ably capture the flavor of the &#34;wrong side of the track&#34; kind of girl and her barely suppressed feelings of anger and anguish are believable.  I do keep wondering how the kids of millionaires and billionaires would be in the same school with less financially endowed students.  Most teachers, unfortunately, are simplistic caricatures.  There are some interesting elements of race and class struggle in each show, though again, somewhat on the simple and obvious side.  The final surprise for me is how interesting the show is as a time machine.  Season One takes place in 2004, which seems pretty recent to me, but on the screen I was shocked by how old the show felt.  No smartphones, no tablets, computer technology of a bygone age, old CRT TVs, reminder after reminder of how quickly modern society changes in the digital era.",4,A Surprisingly Entertaining Time Machine,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,1618,"['discussion', 'new', '34', 'Veronica', 'Mars', '34', 'movie', 'popped', 'up', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'episode', 'early', '2000', 'TV', 'show', 'took', 'plunge', 'curiosity', 'season', 'one', 'surprised', 'show', 'certainly', 'not', 'high', 'brow', 'entertainment', 'were', 'Twins', 'Peaks', 'fan', 'show', 'probably', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'Think', 'more', 'lines', 'one', 'CSI', 'franchises', 'plots', 'are', 'quirkier', 'more', 'believable', 'CSI', 'episode', 'however', 'plots', 'are', 'predictable', 'characters', 'relatively', 'simple', 'resolution', 'episode', 'criminal', 'riddle', 'brief', 'rush', 'end', 'show', 'show', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Much', 'credit', 'Kristin', 'Bell', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'surprising', 'skill', 'ably', 'capture', 'flavor', '34', 'wrong', 'side', 'track', '34', 'kind', 'girl', 'barely', 'suppressed', 'feelings', 'anger', 'anguish', 'are', 'believable', 'do', 'keep', 'wondering', 'how', 'kids', 'millionaires', 'billionaires', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'school', 'less', 'financially', 'endowed', 'students', 'Most', 'teachers', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'simplistic', 'caricatures', 'are', 'interesting', 'elements', 'race', 'class', 'struggle', 'show', 'though', 'again', 'somewhat', 'simple', 'obvious', 'side', 'final', 'surprise', 'how', 'interesting', 'show', 'time', 'machine', 'Season', 'One', 'place', '2004', 'pretty', 'recent', 'screen', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'old', 'show', 'felt', 'smartphones', 'tablets', 'computer', 'technology', 'bygone', 'age', 'old', 'CRT', 'TVs', 'reminder', 'reminder', 'how', 'quickly', 'modern', 'society', 'changes', 'digital', 'era']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

After all, it's the show you should be immersing yourself into, not just the reviews of it.  So I won't keep you long.""Veronica Mars, Season One"" delivers a batch of clever and hearfelt episodes, with not a clunker in the bunch.  Each episode, in addition to delivering some great character stuff, does two things: gives you an entertaining stand-alone story featuring Veronica taking on a P.I. type case, and 2) advances the season-long arc detailing Veronica's investigation into the death of her best friend, Lilly Kane.  Also, to keep viewers from getting too comfortable with the construction of the show, there are also a couple of ""mini arcs"" throughout the season, where Veronica undertakes some longer investigations that compete in importance with the investigation of her friend's death.I liked the way these season-one episodes played fair and actually gave you the clues you need to figure out Lilly Kane's killer, who is revealed in the excellent final episode of this set.  By the way, here's a teeny, tiny mini-spoiler that won't give away anything big but might make you enjoy the show even more:  when trying to figure out who killed Lilly, don't just pay attention to the ""official"" clues discovered during Veronica's investigation of her friend's death; also pay attention to the things you see during the course of the stand-alone stories.  There's info to be mined there!  Nuff said on that score.I loved the close relationship between Veronica and her dad, the daring nature of some of the things that happen to Veronica, the clever banter that is almost never too clever for its own good, and the way that the show respects viewers enough to believe that they can keep up!  In other words, each little mystery is solved and explained, but the solution isn't spoon fed to you.  You sometimes have to pay attention as the solutions are quickly rattled off so the show can get back to what it's really passionate about, namely the character stuff.Oh, well... I seem to be falling into the trap of so many other reviewers here, and keep going on and on about ""Veronica Mars"".

Toteda,"[17, 19]","Once in a while, you stumble upon a show that hooks you in at the beginning, then slowly it begins to lose your interest for a while then maybe near the end leave you perhaps intrigued enough to tune in next season.Well, once in a blue moon do you stumble upon a show that hooks you in at the beginning only to build intensity and quality as the show progresses, leaving your heart to race on many ocassions, building momentum as it comes to a spectacular final three episodes evoking emotions such as joy, shock, rage, and sadness all at the same time. Ladies, gentlemen, young adults, teenagers Veronica Mars IS this type of show!This little UPN show proved itself as the next craze...even though it had to go up against some tough competition in the form of Law and Order:SUV, House, Amazing Race, and One Tree Hill. Nonetheless, a devoted fan base emerged creating much talk and debate among show plot lines, characters and couples.Veronica Mars is a show centered by a young, sassy, intelligent, spy woman (often referred to the Nancy Drew of the 21st century) who has a few issues that all stem from one event, her best friends murder:First the obvious, ""Who killed Lilly Kane?""Also, after her father wrongfully accuses Lilly's father for her murder, Veronica is torn to chose who she will stand by, her father now an outcast, fired as detective , or the popular circle of friends who think she's now crazy. Needless to say she loses her friends and her boyfriend (Lilly's brother ) but gains a chip on the shoulder and a heck of a lot of determination in order to re-gain her fathers respect and put Lilly's ghost to rest by making it her mission to solve her murder.And if that's not enough, she was also drug raped at a party, and has no idea what happened that night.These mysteries and questions are the major plot arcs of the season...they are all raised at the beginning of the season and finally answered in the finale two episodes. How we get from the beginning to the grand finale is pure, poetic television! Sure there are the minor plot lines in-between, and the episodic mysteries much like Smallville was first season...but there is no rock left unturned...the writers and producers thought of everything, and leave their audience feeling excited and satisfied at the end...as well as a little crazy because there is another cliff hanger that leaves you wanting more!Now the actors headed by Kristen Bell (Veronica), her father played by Enrico Colontoni and Perry Daggs III as the best friend Wallace give outstanding performances. They are supported by Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls) who makes you want to love and hate his character, Francis Capra as Weevil our lovable bad-boy, and Teddy Dunn who is Veronica's ex Duncan Kane. Many diss Dunn's performance but I believe he really came into his own near the second half of the season and surpassed all my expectations during the final two episodes. In all, I guess what I'm getting at is that the show is well-casted, and this is hard to do considering that the supporting cast (there are many more I have not mentioned) is a large number of characters important to the progression and suspense of the major plot lines, because they make their characters believable the audience in turn can be taken in so easily by this story and truly care about these characters.I'm glad they're coming out with this season before season two begins because it only means that more people are going to be taken by this series. There are 22 episodes plus extras included are:&quot;a Director's Cut of the Pilot episode, plus 25 minutes of unaired scenes and bloopers&quot; (tvshowsondvd.com)I know the extras are few but the producers and the network wanted to get this out as soon as possible, so hopefully they will make up for extras on the season two set!Just know, that you will not be able to stop watching once you've started...my cousin and I got to the point where we couldn't have anybody else making noise in the room when we were watching mars and by the finale we were going crazy jumping up and down and screaming at the screen! This show is a can't miss for any mystery lover...and well, for anyone who appreciates strong willed protagonist like Veronica Mars, you'll be cheering her on the whole way through.",5,"Come On Sugar, Get a Clue!",1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,4280,"['Once', 'while', 'stumble', 'show', 'beginning', 'then', 'lose', 'interest', 'while', 'then', 'maybe', 'end', 'leave', 'perhaps', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'tune', 'next', 'season.Well', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'do', 'stumble', 'show', 'beginning', 'only', 'build', 'intensity', 'quality', 'show', 'leaving', 'heart', 'race', 'many', 'ocassions', 'building', 'momentum', 'spectacular', 'final', 'three', 'episodes', 'evoking', 'emotions', 'such', 'joy', 'shock', 'rage', 'sadness', 'same', 'time', 'Ladies', 'gentlemen', 'young', 'adults', 'teenagers', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'type', 'show', 'little', 'UPN', 'show', 'proved', 'next', 'craze', 'even', 'had', 'go', 'up', 'tough', 'competition', 'form', 'Law', 'Order', 'SUV', 'House', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Nonetheless', 'devoted', 'fan', 'base', 'emerged', 'creating', 'much', 'talk', 'debate', 'show', 'plot', 'lines', 'characters', 'couples.Veronica', 'Mars', 'show', 'centered', 'young', 'sassy', 'intelligent', 'spy', 'woman', 'often', 'referred', 'Nancy', 'Drew', '21st', 'century', 'who', 'few', 'issues', 'stem', 'one', 'event', 'best', 'friends', 'murder', 'First', 'obvious', 'Who', 'killed', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'Also', 'father', 'wrongfully', 'Lilly', 'father', 'murder', 'Veronica', 'torn', 'chose', 'who', 'will', 'stand', 'father', 'now', 'outcast', 'fired', 'detective', 'popular', 'circle', 'friends', 'who', 'think', 'now', 'crazy', 'Needless', 'say', 'friends', 'boyfriend', 'Lilly', 'brother', 'gains', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'heck', 'lot', 'determination', 'order', 're-gain', 'fathers', 'respect', 'put', 'Lilly', 'ghost', 'rest', 'making', 'mission', 'solve', 'murder.And', 'not', 'enough', 'was', 'also', 'drug', 'raped', 'party', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'night.These', 'mysteries', 'questions', 'are', 'major', 'plot', 'arcs', 'season', 'are', 'raised', 'beginning', 'season', 'finally', 'answered', 'finale', 'two', 'episodes', 'How', 'get', 'beginning', 'grand', 'finale', 'pure', 'poetic', 'television', 'Sure', 'are', 'minor', 'plot', 'lines', 'in-between', 'episodic', 'mysteries', 'much', 'Smallville', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'rock', 'left', 'unturned', 'writers', 'producers', 'thought', 'everything', 'leave', 'audience', 'feeling', 'excited', 'satisfied', 'end', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'crazy', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'wanting', 'more', 'Now', 'actors', 'headed', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Veronica', 'father', 'played', 'Enrico', 'Colontoni', 'Perry', 'Daggs', 'III', 'best', 'friend', 'Wallace', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'are', 'supported', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'Logan', 'Echolls', 'who', 'want', 'love', 'hate', 'character', 'Francis', 'Capra', 'Weevil', 'lovable', 'bad-boy', 'Teddy', 'Dunn', 'who', 'Veronica', 'ex', 'Duncan', 'Kane', 'Many', 'diss', 'Dunn', 'performance', 'believe', 'really', 'came', 'own', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'guess', 'what', ""'m"", 'getting', 'show', 'well-casted', 'hard', 'do', 'considering', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'have', 'not', 'mentioned', 'large', 'number', 'characters', 'important', 'progression', 'suspense', 'major', 'plot', 'lines', 'make', 'characters', 'believable', 'audience', 'turn', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'so', 'easily', 'story', 'truly', 'care', 'characters.I', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'re"", 'coming', 'out', 'season', 'season', 'two', 'begins', 'only', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'taken', 'series', 'are', '22', 'episodes', 'extras', 'included', 'are', 'quot', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Pilot', 'episode', '25', 'minutes', 'unaired', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'quot', 'know', 'extras', 'are', 'few', 'producers', 'network', 'wanted', 'get', 'out', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'so', 'hopefully', 'will', 'make', 'up', 'extras', 'season', 'two', 'set', 'Just', 'know', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'watching', 'once', ""'ve"", 'started', 'cousin', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'anybody', 'else', 'making', 'noise', 'room', 'when', 'were', 'watching', 'mars', 'finale', 'were', 'going', 'crazy', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'screaming', 'screen', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'mystery', 'lover', 'well', 'anyone', 'who', 'strong', 'willed', 'protagonist', 'Veronica', 'Mars', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cheering', 'whole', 'way']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

I decided to give this 10 year old CW show a try after hearing the buzz surrounding the shows fans' funding of a Veronica Mars Movie.  So far, I find Logan and Weevil are especially interesting characters.  Initially presented as shallow bullies, we learn more about their inner lives as the season progresses and come to understand why they act the way they do.Veronica Mars herself is impossibly cool and capable, but having once been part of the in-crowd as the local Sheriff's daughter, dating the richest guy in town's son - both she and her dad now find themselves scratching out a living on the margins of a society that has rejected them.  It's a modern dynamic that's becoming all too common, the &#34;haves&#34; with the financial means and social clout to manipulate the system vs. the have-nots who must hold down jobs to help their struggling parents make ends meet.The most clever bits are when our heroine's detective services are employed in age-appropriate endeavours, such as digging up dirt on the parents of her fellow students (in order to give the kids more leverage), recovering a stolen school mascot, discovering who is selling fake IDs, of finding a runaway friend.  It earns Veronica enough to pay for her own car (fun!) but she also decides to sacrifice her college savings in order to pay for a family member's stint in rehab (not so much fun)There really are schools such as Neptune High, although the personalities are not as extreme.  In my town of Naples, FL, the flagship high school has quite a few millionaire's kids attending the same classes as their servants' kids.  Governor Rick Scott's daughter attended and the school's attendance zone includes the city's only public housing complex.  Granted the rich kids are not nearly as extreme or catty, but history class discussions can get pretty intense around election time!I noticed that in the pilot they used a run-of-the-mill working class apartment building for Veronica and her dad to call home.  In subsequent episodes the producers still have Veronica living in an apartment but it's a much nicer place, being on the beach (No way!) with lush landscaping and richer architectural details.It's an interesting, entertaining and affective show which is included free-of-charge with the price of your Amazon Prime membership fee!",4,Not your regular High School Drama,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,2375,"[""'m"", 'almost', 'done', '1st', 'season', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'decided', 'give', '10', 'year', 'old', 'CW', 'show', 'try', 'hearing', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'shows', 'fans', 'funding', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'Movie', 'So', 'far', 'find', 'Logan', 'Weevil', 'are', 'especially', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Initially', 'presented', 'shallow', 'bullies', 'learn', 'more', 'inner', 'lives', 'season', 'come', 'understand', 'why', 'act', 'way', 'do.Veronica', 'Mars', 'impossibly', 'cool', 'capable', 'having', 'once', 'been', 'part', 'in-crowd', 'local', 'Sheriff', 'daughter', 'dating', 'richest', 'guy', 'town', 'son', 'dad', 'now', 'find', 'scratching', 'out', 'living', 'margins', 'society', 'rejected', 'modern', 'dynamic', 'becoming', 'too', 'common', '34', 'haves', '34', 'financial', 'means', 'social', 'clout', 'manipulate', 'system', 'have-nots', 'who', 'must', 'hold', 'down', 'jobs', 'help', 'struggling', 'parents', 'make', 'meet.The', 'most', 'clever', 'bits', 'are', 'when', 'heroine', 'detective', 'services', 'are', 'employed', 'age-appropriate', 'endeavours', 'such', 'digging', 'up', 'dirt', 'parents', 'fellow', 'students', 'order', 'give', 'kids', 'more', 'leverage', 'recovering', 'stolen', 'school', 'mascot', 'discovering', 'who', 'selling', 'fake', 'IDs', 'finding', 'runaway', 'friend', 'Veronica', 'enough', 'pay', 'own', 'car', 'fun', 'also', 'sacrifice', 'college', 'savings', 'order', 'pay', 'family', 'member', 'stint', 'rehab', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'really', 'are', 'schools', 'such', 'Neptune', 'High', 'personalities', 'are', 'not', 'extreme', 'town', 'Naples', 'FL', 'flagship', 'high', 'school', 'quite', 'few', 'millionaire', 'kids', 'attending', 'same', 'classes', 'servants', 'kids', 'Governor', 'Rick', 'Scott', 'daughter', 'attended', 'school', 'attendance', 'zone', 'city', 'only', 'public', 'housing', 'complex', 'Granted', 'rich', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'extreme', 'catty', 'history', 'class', 'discussions', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'intense', 'election', 'time', 'noticed', 'pilot', 'used', 'run-of-the-mill', 'working', 'class', 'apartment', 'building', 'Veronica', 'dad', 'call', 'home', 'subsequent', 'producers', 'still', 'have', 'Veronica', 'living', 'apartment', 'much', 'nicer', 'place', 'being', 'beach', 'way', 'lush', 'landscaping', 'richer', 'architectural', 'details.It', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'affective', 'show', 'included', 'free-of-charge', 'price', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'membership', 'fee']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

Unfortunately, most teen dramas these days write content that portray teenagers to be mean, callous and inhuman with NO Intelligence as to their choice of behavior which is not the case of a real teenage human being.

Instead, he brought me Veronica Mars and told me he wouldn't give me F&G; until I watched the UPN detective show. Like most, I was skeptical . . . but now, I can't thank him enough.It took me four days to watch the first season, and I downloaded the second season that had aired until that point and finished watching it as it aired on UPN. The second season was excellent, but this first season is absolutely perfect. The dialogue, the stories, and oh, the ACTING. Kristen Bell is amazing as Veronica, and Jason Dohring, playing Logan Echolls, is absolutely superb. Enrico Catolani as Veronica's father is warm and a perfect ally and foil to his daughter, while Francis Capra's Weevil is the pitch-perfect bad boy with a heart of gold.The first season follows Veronica's quest to find the murderer of her best friend, Lilly Kane. Helping her along, whether they know it or not, are her father, Logan, Weevil, best friend Wallace (Percy Daggs III), and ex-boyfriend Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn). But you've probably already read enough plot summaries. My main objective here is to tell you that if you are hesitant to watch, DON'T BE. Buy the season 1 and 2 DVDs and watch season 3 this fall -- this year, it has been given a kinder time slot (Tuesdays at 9:00, immediately following Gilmore Girls), which will hopefully increase viewership.Don't miss out on one of the best shows ever.

I think YA's will love this because each episode deals with the real-life-adult-strength problems and situations teens and tweens deal with on a daily basis.The content has been GP-13 to GP-18, a little bit of language - milder than you hear in everyday conversations.

921813,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000A59PMO,Marc Cabir Davis,"[6, 22]","""Veronica Mars"" is a perfect example of a show that had huge critical acclaim, yet did nothing much for me. I bought this solely on the great reviews from noted critics as well as the extremely thought provoking and well-written reviews here on Amazon, but at the end of the day I have to say that I disagree with the general consensus that this show is a 'classic'.The primary problem for me was that the female lead did not work. Kristen Bell is functional, yes, but more than that she seemed purposely boisterous, with an arsenal of witty one liners out of ""Juno"" that no real person could possibly speak in real life. It felt as if the writers wanted to be hip so badly that everything eventually felt fake. The only recent show where this sort of writing worked was ""Gilmore Girls"" and sadly, the script here was disappointing, especially because I bought the show based on inputs that the script was 'to die for'.Add to that the storyline, which during the first season is not even riveting enough to want to watch the next episode. I am a fan of missing people and murder mysteries, etc, but the plot here seemed vague and not very gripping, and it seemed a task to want to watch subsequent episodes. While well directed, the show didn't quite appeal to my sense of dark humor either, but it was evident they were going for it.""Veronica Mars"" is one of those impulse buys that I regret. As a fan of stuff like ""The Golden Girls"", ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Dead Like Me"", I thought this would also be an offbeat little series that would have repeat value. Unfortunately, I can't imagine ANYONE watching any of these episodes more than once, and for me, watching them only once was itself an exercise.I am sure there are people who swear that this is the greatest TV show ever made, but I beg to differ.

While the ratings are low, it has a loyal following for a very good reason.In the seaside town of Neptune, California, there are the haves and the have-nots.  You're either one or the other with no middle ground.  Veronica used to be part of the popular click.  But that was before her best friend Lily was murdered, her rich boyfriend Duncan dumped her, and her father lost his job as the town Sheriff because of his handling of Lily's murder investigation.  While her dad opened a PI office, her mom split for parts unknown, leaving the two to cope with the changes in town.Because of her station as a former popular girl, Veronica doesn't fit into either crowd.  Fortunately, the detective skills she's learned from her dad help her make friends.  Seems like classmates are constantly coming to her to help with little things like bomb scares or missing pets.  Even teachers turn to her in times of crisis, like false accusations of statutory rape.  Along the way, Veronica begins to pick up pieces of the puzzle of Lily's murder.  Will she piece them all together and figure out who really done it?I tuned into the premier because several friends were planning to watch as well.  I was hooked from the start.  The show is smart with decent mysteries each week.  The clues to the season long mystery of Lily's death were tantalizing as well.  The show is definitely shown through Veronica's eyes, with her voiceover narrating events as well.  Veronica has a sarcastic sense of humor that livens things up and keeps the often-serious storyline from becoming too depressing.  Newcomer Kristen Bell does an outstanding job in the roll, believably hitting all the peaks and valleys each week.  It is rather funny to see Zachery Ty Bryant and Jonathan Taylor Thomas show up in guest rolls as high schoolers.The DVD was rushed out to help build interest in the currently playing season two.  As such, the list of extras is small, limited to some deleted scenes and a season long gag reel.Some of the plot lines are for the more mature, but teens and adults will love this smart, noir drama series.

Kristen Bell really nails this character and Veronica is not a simple character at all.  The mood of the show is surprisingly dark and the stories are complex but believable. Veronica seriously kicks ass without the aid of any super powers or firearms, but instead uses her wits and her moxie (and on rare occasions a taser).  What a concept!  And even though Veronica is literally feared by just about everyone in her high school because of her &#34;skills&#34;, she is a lonely outcast and she is still just a vulnerable teenage girl when it comes to many things.  Each episode has Veronica solving various and numerous problems for people in clever and inventive ways and also dealing with the usual issues of high school life as an outcast.  Additionally, there is a season long story arc about the murder of Veronica's best friend and as the season progresses Veronica learns more and more about the murder.  I am making this sound really simple but believe me there is a lot of complexity involved in these sub-plots.  The end of the season reaches a climax when the murderer is discovered and the ending resolution is suitably exciting, pretty believable, somewhat surprising, and very satisfying.

etc. however, anyone wanting to pass this off as another nancy drew-ish teenage sleuther show is missing out on some of the best writing and acting on television today.kristen bell as veronica mars is absolutely perfect. she's the perfect blend of spunk and vulnerability--a very smart move on the writer's part.  for all her brains and cleverness, underneath it all veronica is mush (just as a 17 year old would be), and bell pulls it off gloriously. it's joy to watch. and yeah, she's Extraordinarily attractive.all around the acting is so solid--particularly jason dohring as logan ecchols. he comes off as a pompous a** in the beginning of the show, yet as we see him progress (or digress) it's hard to fall in love with the kid. there's really not a wink link in the bunch. everyone nails their roles with the just the right mix of levity and gravitas. each is deeply wounded in some way or other, and it's neat to watch each character's particular arc as they come to terms with own demons (and they all have them).and try not to love deputy leo. i dare you. hilarious.the writing is also superb. you almost need the 'annotated veronica mars' just keep up with the writer's jokes and references (it was particularly hilarious to see 'clash of the titans' on the hotel room tv considering harry hamlin, star of said movie, stars at logan ecchols father). i've laughed out loud several times while watching the show in my room alone. i hope the second season builds on the first's...in short, veronica mars is everything you want your TV show to be: funny, moving, well-written, superbly acted, full of mystery and intrigue, likeable characters, evil villians, and great background music to boot (rob thomas: email me. we need to talk. you need me as your soundtrack coordinator). sure, you'll have to suspend disbelief at times, but a trip to neptune, california is well worth the price of admission.the big boys (abc, cbs, nbc, fox) need to stand up and notice what's going on the down the street.  shows like everwood, gilmore girls and now veronica mars are leaving you in the dust. and good for them.",5,the best show on television?

VM has all the smarts and cynicism of Philip Marlowe and that core of un-corruptible ethics which make the classic film noir detective.  In a world where so many detective shows have degenerated into constant bloody murders and sex crimes ... it is refreshing to enjoy a show where not all the mysteries are &#34;murders&#34; ... the series doesn't rely on blood, gore, and gratuitous violence ... it is more clever than that.  VM also deals with Chandler's recurring theme of the Very Rich vs Everyone Else.  &#34;Neptune California ... the town with no middle class&#34;, rings very true if you live in certain areas of coastal Southern Cali.

It has sweeping Shakespearian tragedy drama set in a high school.

Luckily, when this DVD set came out, I was able to, and I enjoyed it quite a lot a bit.Many people proclaimed this show the ""next Buffy"", but it's really the ""first Veronica Mars"". To set up, Veronica is the daughter of PI who both helps her father out on cases between classes, and runs her own cases whenever she can get away with it. The is one main over-arching mystery in the season, and many smaller ones (including the ""case of the week""). Many of the episodes were excellent and even the ones which weren't as good, once I'd watched the whole season, turned out to reveal important little elements and steps towards the grand finale.The story (and mystery), however, wasn't what interested me most. It was the characters. Episode by episode, Veronica, Keith, Logan, Mac, and a few others grew on me in a way few characters in others shows have. A combination of great writing and delivery really brought them to life, and made the show truly something special, and head-and-shoulders above most of the other programming on TV.",4,The First Veronica Mars,1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,1243,"['caught', 'few', 'episodes', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'many', 'shows', 'days', 'really', 'have', 'watch', 'entire', 'thing', 'appreciate', 'serialized', 'arcs', 'season-long', 'plot', 'threads', 'involved', 'Luckily', 'when', 'DVD', 'set', 'came', 'was', 'able', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'lot', 'bit.Many', 'people', 'proclaimed', 'show', 'next', 'Buffy', 'really', 'first', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'set', 'up', 'Veronica', 'daughter', 'PI', 'who', 'father', 'cases', 'classes', 'own', 'cases', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'one', 'main', 'over-arching', 'mystery', 'season', 'many', 'smaller', 'ones', 'including', 'case', 'week', 'Many', 'episodes', 'were', 'excellent', 'even', 'ones', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'once', ""'d"", 'watched', 'whole', 'season', 'turned', 'out', 'reveal', 'important', 'little', 'elements', 'steps', 'grand', 'finale.The', 'story', 'mystery', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'interested', 'most', 'was', 'characters', 'Episode', 'episode', 'Veronica', 'Keith', 'Logan', 'Mac', 'few', 'others', 'grew', 'way', 'few', 'characters', 'others', 'shows', 'have', 'combination', 'great', 'writing', 'delivery', 'really', 'brought', 'life', 'made', 'show', 'truly', 'something', 'special', 'head-and-shoulders', 'most', 'other', 'programming', 'TV']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

921890,A3BX51IRJ8III8,B000A59PMO,"Robert Ropars ""Ropars""","[0, 0]","Imagine David Lynch's seminal TV series 'Twin Peaks' if it had been set in the 21st century and focused on her best friend Donna investigating the murder of Laura Palmer. In a sense, this smart, savvy show is a 'Nancy Drew' update mixed with the type of 'Twin Peaks'-esque scenario (the unsolved murder of a popular, beautiful high school girl causes shockwaves that open old wounds, secrets and lies in a small, close-knit town).Set in the mythical, seaside city of Neptune, California, Veronica Mars is set one year after her best friend Lily Kane, played by always gorgeous and talented Amanda Seyfried, was murdered. Veronica, in the role that made Kristin Bell famous is the daughter of local P.I., former sheriff who lost his job after accusing her father of being involved in the murder. Just prior to the murder, her boyfriend Duncan Kane, Lily's brother, suddenly dumped her and avoids her. In fact, Veronica, who works with her dad in his P.I. firm nights is a complete outcast at her high school.And this is where the show is really strong. Besides having one of the best ensemble casts I've seen, this has to be one of, if not the, best portrayals of high school I've seen. You don't have the feel like some shows/movies that you're watching 20+ actors playing high schoolers. The way the cast talks, acts, dresses, etc. are feel like you're on location at a real high school. It's authentic and very natural in terms of the dialogue.Veronica is smart, sassy, sarcastic and over season one is moving from outright ostracism to growing connections as one by one she helps various individuals (using her smarts and detective skills). It never feels forced or silly. The show has a running story arc related to who really killed Lily (is the wrong person in jail?) and her mom left suddenly at that time and is missing. Why? And how is everything connected to the Kanes, one of the wealthiest families in the area?I heard about the show but had never seen in. I love Kristin Bell and Amanda Seyfried (had no idea she was in it), but what prompted me to check it out was the story of the recent movie made 10 years after the 3rd/final season ended. The story of the fan funding and people talking about how beloved the show is combined with Amazon making all 3 seasons part of Prime and I decided to give it a shot. Now halfway through season 1 I can say I love it.And for awhile it will not feel &#34;dated&#34; as it was made just recent enough that all of the technology and things people are referencing are still for the most part familiar. A few movie/song references and ubiquitous cell phones are old flip phones, but overall doesn't feel like you're watching something &#34;old&#34; and foreign to current viewers.Topically you'll find the show touching on everything from 1%'s vs. 99%'s, high school politics, gender roles, strong females, date rape, racism, etc. The show is great and can't wait to finish all 3 seasons and then watch the movie. Give it a look and have teen/older daughters/sisters? Should be a great one for girls to have a smart role model show which as we know is a rare thing at any point.",5,A worthy follow-up to 'Twin Peaks' 14 years after that show 1st aired,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,3129,"['Imagine', 'David', 'Lynch', 'seminal', 'TV', 'series', ""'Twin"", 'Peaks', 'had', 'been', 'set', '21st', 'century', 'focused', 'best', 'friend', 'Donna', 'investigating', 'murder', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'sense', 'smart', 'savvy', 'show', ""'Nancy"", 'Drew', 'update', 'mixed', 'type', ""'Twin"", ""Peaks'-esque"", 'scenario', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'popular', 'beautiful', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'open', 'old', 'wounds', 'secrets', 'small', 'close-knit', 'town', '.Set', 'mythical', 'seaside', 'city', 'Neptune', 'California', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'set', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'friend', 'Lily', 'Kane', 'played', 'always', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'was', 'murdered', 'Veronica', 'role', 'made', 'Kristin', 'Bell', 'famous', 'daughter', 'local', 'P.I.', 'former', 'sheriff', 'who', 'lost', 'job', 'accusing', 'father', 'being', 'involved', 'murder', 'Just', 'prior', 'murder', 'boyfriend', 'Duncan', 'Kane', 'Lily', 'brother', 'suddenly', 'dumped', 'avoids', 'fact', 'Veronica', 'who', 'dad', 'P.I', 'firm', 'nights', 'complete', 'outcast', 'high', 'school.And', 'where', 'show', 'really', 'strong', 'having', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'casts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'be', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'portrayals', 'high', 'school', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'shows/movies', ""'re"", 'watching', '20+', 'actors', 'playing', 'high', 'schoolers', 'way', 'cast', 'talks', 'acts', 'dresses', 'etc', 'are', 'feel', ""'re"", 'location', 'real', 'high', 'school', 'authentic', 'very', 'natural', 'terms', 'dialogue.Veronica', 'smart', 'sassy', 'sarcastic', 'season', 'one', 'moving', 'outright', 'ostracism', 'growing', 'connections', 'one', 'one', 'various', 'individuals', 'using', 'smarts', 'detective', 'skills', 'never', 'forced', 'silly', 'show', 'running', 'story', 'arc', 'related', 'who', 'really', 'killed', 'Lily', 'wrong', 'person', 'jail', 'mom', 'left', 'suddenly', 'time', 'missing', 'Why', 'how', 'everything', 'connected', 'Kanes', 'one', 'wealthiest', 'families', 'area', 'heard', 'show', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'love', 'Kristin', 'Bell', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'what', 'prompted', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'story', 'recent', 'movie', 'made', '10', 'years', '3rd/final', 'season', 'ended', 'story', 'fan', 'funding', 'people', 'talking', 'how', 'beloved', 'show', 'combined', 'Amazon', 'making', '3', 'seasons', 'part', 'Prime', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'Now', 'halfway', 'season', '1', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'it.And', 'awhile', 'will', 'not', 'feel', '34', 'dated', '34', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'recent', 'enough', 'technology', 'things', 'people', 'are', 'referencing', 'are', 'still', 'most', 'part', 'familiar', 'few', 'movie/song', 'references', 'ubiquitous', 'cell', 'phones', 'are', 'old', 'flip', 'phones', 'overall', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'something', '34', 'old', '34', 'foreign', 'current', 'viewers.Topically', ""'ll"", 'find', 'show', 'touching', 'everything', '1', '%', 'vs.', '99', '%', 'high', 'school', 'politics', 'gender', 'roles', 'strong', 'females', 'date', 'rape', 'racism', 'etc', 'show', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'finish', '3', 'seasons', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'Give', 'look', 'have', 'teen/older', 'daughters/sisters', 'Should', 'be', 'great', 'one', 'girls', 'have', 'smart', 'role', 'model', 'show', 'know', 'rare', 'thing', 'point']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

I won't repeat what the other reviews have said (except that the comparisons to Nancy Drew, Buffy, and Twin Peaks are pretty spot on).  I do want to emphasize that the show isn't perfect.  Some episodes are stronger than others, and of course the premise requires a massive suspension of disbelief, but the overall quality of the series is so far above most other TV that those seem like picky observations.  I will commit heresy though, and suggest that being dropped as a series isn't the worst thing that can happen to a good TV show.  The premise in 'Heroes' had about one good season in it, and that's what we got before it started declining.  Having said that, one or a few good seasons is more than you get in most shows.  Many of the other reviewers have name dropped their favorite shows that others may not be familiar with, so I'll do the same.  Check out 'Slings and Arrows' (18 episodes total, by design), followed by 'Book of Daniel' (only 9 episodes, that was a true loss), 'Clatterford' (12 episodes), and the live action version of 'The Tick' (but not the animated version).

After Gilmore Girls, this show boasts some of the wittiest, fastest-paced dialogue on network TV.  I am a newcomer to Veronica Mars and now an acolyte (thank you, Family Video for sparing me the financial burden of purchasing yet another TV series).  Always a fan of mysteries (provided they aren't too Hannibal Lecter), I can get my fill of whodunits with V. M.'s  neverending subplots and overarching mystery, the as-of-yet inexplicable death of Lilly, Veronica's best friend.I love how clever and confident Veronica is. Also, what a role model for multitasking! I especially like that Veronica doesn't take anyone's garbage--I certainly could learn that lesson from Ms. Mars. (Kristen Bell is a fellow Michigander who grew up only a few hours from my hometown.) The guy who plays Logan is kinda cute (okay, he's bona fide hot, though probably eight years my junior), and I'm glad that his character becomes a better person, or at least a more dynamic person who's rendered sympathetically, towards the end of the first season (though I cringed and was embarrassed for him during the earlier episodes when he said one insensitive, politically incorrect thing after another).Lilly's ghost gives tips and clues to the otherwise hallucinating Veronica and Duncan, Lilly's brother (and possibly, Veronica's half-brother whom Veronica used to date; way too Flowers in the Attic/V.C. Andrews, but hey, Abraham and Sarah were half-brother and sister, too).Wallace is a cool, resourceful young man whom Veroncia is the first to befriend and rescue from a cruel, retaliatory prank, and the two outsiders infiltrate the masterminds of high school and local petty (and not-so-petty) crime.We see for ourselves on Veronica Mars how people's personalities can drastically alter when they are slipped drugs in their drinks (Veronica) or go off their poorly tolerated meds cold-turkey (Duncan). This show sensitively handled how this brain-chemistry alteration can affect a person's behavior and that the said person is not to be blamed, a point I wouldn't mind pressing with the general public.(In the second disc of season one in the episode, ""The Girl Next Door,"" there is a young woman (Jessica Chastain) who is a dead ringer for yours truly and her character's name is also Sarah.

For some reason everyone who had heard of it at all thought that it was a 'Nancy Drew type show'.  No critcism of Nancy implied, but Veronica Mars (both the character and the series) has a very mature, dark and cynical outlook that defies most simplistic expectations.  Veronica isn't always the nicest person; she is cynical, bitter and (highly) vengeful.  She enjoys manipulating people, she can be frighteningly cavalier with the truth (and law... and basic human rights), and she wants to be feared by people that she doesn't like.  But ultimately she is a champion for those who don't have other options. The greatest evil in Veronica's home town of Neptune, is not a serial killer or even the murderer of Veronica's best friend; it is the caste driven system which disenfranchizes many of Veronica's peers, while elevating others.  Veronica Mars is not all social message or politically posturing though, and it brings to the table a number of strengths that make it standout (head and shoulders) among the current crop of teen dramas (the best since Buffy).-Great writing; particularly in the witty repartee and in Veronica's often wickedly cynical expository voice over.-Kristen Bell's extraordinary range and dead on delievery.  Unlike many actor's trying to play smart, she actually seems very smart, and very competent.-A strong story arc that threads through each episode, driving Veronica's actions.-A great supporting cast (both regular and recurring) playing complex characters that have their own agendas and who grow and change throughout the season.There are many dynamics that go on in a show this complex, some of which work better than others.

921930,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B000A59PMO,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[4, 4]","""It's one of the best-written television series I have ever seen, and it has a lot to offer people still mourning the loss of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's smart, funny, edgy, and rewards patient viewers with one hell of a mystery.17-year-old Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell, Spartan) has had a rough year. Her best friend was murdered. Her father Keith (Enrico Colantoni, Galaxy Quest), once the sheriff of the small Soouthern California town of Neptune, was fired during the investigation because his search led him to the very wealthy Kane family, including Veronica's ex-boyfriend Duncan (Teddy Dunn, The Manchurian Candidate). After being fired as sheriff, Keith became a private investigator and Veronica's mom disappeared. She lost her considerable popularity at the prestigious Neptune High, and now works for her dad, when she's not carrying on her own investigation of her friend's murder. She will stop at nothing to find the truth, even if it puts her own life at risk.Much of the credit needs to go to Rob Thomas, who obviously remembers clearly what it feels like to be a teenager. The teen cast is impulsive, uncertain, and frustrated, and watching them interact is almost uncomfortably reminiscent of high school. This could be a drawback for viewers who forget how it feels to be a teen, but it's an impressive feat to those able to remember with immediacy the uncertainty of teenage life. While that alone helps Veronica Mars stand against the competition, the adult characters are also surprisingly well-written. Some of the teachers come across as parodies, but the relationship between Veronica and her father is well developed, and avoids the usual TV parent stereotypes. The series also does a fine job of juggling references to pop culture and high culture. It's quite savvy, making references to things that are still fresh a year after the episodes were broadcast, but it also has a deep well of high culture references. Holders of useless English Literature degrees are going to eat this series up. Culturally adept viewers will also enjoy the celebrity cameos and inside jokes, none of which I will spoil here. Needless to say, it's a very cool show.Equal credit needs to go to the cast. Kristen Bell is truly fantastic as Veronica Mars, with enough charisma to easily carry the show on her own. Veronica is funny, smart, and fiery, but also wins our sympathy through her sincerity and vulnerability. She's good at what she does, even though she often makes very stupid choices. At first glance, the remainder of the characters are stereotypes. There's Weevil (Francis Capra), for instance, the tough local gang leader. A major antagonist early in the season comes is Logan (Jason Dohring), the spoiled son of a rich and famous actor. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is one of Veronica's only friends at the start, a new guy to the school. As the episodes unfold, we gradually see beneath the generic surface of the characters. None of the characters are who they seem at first, and their web of relationships becomes ever more complicated as they interact through the season.After the first two episodes, I was a bit worried that Veronica Mars would settle into a bland TV series groove. It also looked like it may have had too many balls in the air, much like Joan of Arcadia. I didn't need to worry. As the show progresses, a dark edge starts to creep in. There are still a number of funny incidents, but they begin to be overwhelmed by the grim investigation of the main murder. The suspense surrounding the case builds throughout the season, leading to a final few episodes that are nail-bitingly suspenseful and even a bit creepy. Every detail in the series winds up being important, even the details of the cases that aren't part of the main plot. By the end of the season, whole sections of the jigsaw puzzle start to fall into place, until the truth is finally revealed at the very end. I'm looking forward to a second viewing of the season, if only to watch once again how all these details come together.Which brings me to another high point regarding Veronica Mars. Although some threads are left slightly open at the end of the first season, the show has the decency to close off the main plot thread in a satisfying way. If the series had been canceled after the first season (which it thankfully wasn't), it would still be a great story. So many series now seem to be constantly pushing towards the next big twist. Networks are so afraid of failure that they try to string viewers along viewers with the proverbial carrot-always held in front of us, but never within reach. I want to see the second season of Veronica Mars, not because I just have to find out what will happen next, but because the journey of this first season was such an enjoyable one. Whatever Veronica's next big case is, I don't want to miss it. And should the show jump the shark in the future, this season will still stand on its own as a monumental success.bY Dvdverdict.",5,~*  ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS EVER CREATED ~*,1136592000,"01 7,

921935,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B000A59PMO,Thayer,"[15, 16]","I am very happy that there is going to be a second season for the show in spite of the show's non stellar ratings. Thankfully it will not join the Freaks and Geeks, My So Called Life, Undeclared, and Popular club which all were killed off the air too early. Hopefully the second season will get an increased number of viewers that the show really deserves.One of the things I like about the show is that even though each episode has different episode long plots, there are season long plots (Lilly's murder, Veronica's mother) to move the series along. It is serialized in the sense that as the season progresses, we get little clues regarding the major plots. Even though each episode can be regarded as ""stand alone"" episodes, collectively it is a coherent entire seasonKristin Bell carried the show with spunk and charm. Enrico Colantoni was also good. The relationship of Veronica and Keith was the heart and soul of the series. The chemistry between the two was very effective.It's hard to narrow down my 5 favorite episodes of the season since almost all of them were really great. But here are my top 5 episodes of the first season:**************Possible Spoiler*****************1. Leave it to Beaver - I have seen lots of season finales last season, and this VM finale was the most satisfying. It's a perfect culmination as the murderer of Lilly Kane was finally revealed. I was on the edge of the seat the entire episode. And the scene with the paternity results with Keith and Veronica was really moving. And the penultimate scene with Veronica and Lily in the pool with the song ""Lily Dreams On"" in the background was appropriately poignant. This was just a perfect episode.2. A Trip to the Dentist - A stylish episode as Veronica investigates the person who raped her. The flashbacks were nicely done as they were shown the way the witnesses saw them. They were all basically the same but very different in implication because of the minor details that either they failed to mention or choose not to mention or sometimes the way they interpret the situation.3. The Wrath of Con - I love seeing Veronica and the gang pre murder of Lily. We got insights to the major characters especially the relationship of Duncan and Veronica. The Lily montage in the end of the episode was poignant even though we've only known the character for like 4 or 5 episodes.4. Like a Virgin - Abel Koontz and Veronica Mars in the prison was somewhat reminiscent of Clarice and Hannibal Lecter's face off in Silence of the Lambs. There's a big revelation in the end that made you look at prior episodes in different perspective. Plus Veronica's got a great case with the ""purity test"".5. Ruskie Business - this episode was packed the way pickles are packed. Veronica was working on 3 different cases (Logan's mother, Meg's secret admirer, finding Tom Cruz the actor) and none of them were fillers. All had satisfying conclusions. And just when you thought it's over, the episode actually ended on a cliffhanger of a totally different plot which I won't tell you.Grade: A",5,A Kick Ass Series!,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,3059,"['am', 'very', 'happy', 'going', 'be', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'spite', 'show', 'non', 'stellar', 'ratings', 'Thankfully', 'will', 'not', 'join', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'Undeclared', 'Popular', 'club', 'were', 'killed', 'off', 'air', 'too', 'early', 'Hopefully', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'get', 'increased', 'number', 'viewers', 'show', 'really', 'deserves.One', 'things', 'like', 'show', 'even', 'episode', 'different', 'episode', 'long', 'plots', 'are', 'season', 'long', 'plots', 'Lilly', 'murder', 'Veronica', 'mother', 'move', 'series', 'serialized', 'sense', 'season', 'get', 'little', 'clues', 'regarding', 'major', 'plots', 'Even', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'regarded', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'collectively', 'coherent', 'entire', 'seasonKristin', 'Bell', 'carried', 'show', 'spunk', 'charm', 'Enrico', 'Colantoni', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'relationship', 'Veronica', 'Keith', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'series', 'chemistry', 'two', 'was', 'very', 'effective.It', 'hard', 'narrow', 'down', '5', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'almost', 'were', 'really', 'great', 'here', 'are', 'top', '5', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', '**************Possible', 'Spoiler*****************1', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'have', 'seen', 'lots', 'season', 'finales', 'last', 'season', 'VM', 'finale', 'was', 'most', 'satisfying', 'perfect', 'culmination', 'murderer', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'was', 'finally', 'revealed', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'episode', 'scene', 'paternity', 'results', 'Keith', 'Veronica', 'was', 'really', 'moving', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'Veronica', 'Lily', 'pool', 'song', 'Lily', 'Dreams', 'background', 'was', 'appropriately', 'poignant', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'episode.2', 'Trip', 'Dentist', 'stylish', 'episode', 'Veronica', 'person', 'who', 'raped', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'nicely', 'done', 'were', 'shown', 'way', 'witnesses', 'saw', 'were', 'basically', 'same', 'very', 'different', 'implication', 'minor', 'details', 'failed', 'mention', 'choose', 'not', 'mention', 'sometimes', 'way', 'interpret', 'situation.3', 'Wrath', 'Con', 'love', 'seeing', 'Veronica', 'gang', 'pre', 'murder', 'Lily', 'got', 'insights', 'major', 'characters', 'especially', 'relationship', 'Duncan', 'Veronica', 'Lily', 'montage', 'end', 'episode', 'was', 'poignant', 'even', ""'ve"", 'only', 'known', 'character', 'like', '4', '5', 'episodes.4', 'Virgin', 'Abel', 'Koontz', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'prison', 'was', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Clarice', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'face', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'big', 'revelation', 'end', 'made', 'look', 'prior', 'episodes', 'different', 'perspective', 'Veronica', 'got', 'great', 'case', 'purity', 'test', '.5', 'Ruskie', 'Business', 'episode', 'was', 'packed', 'way', 'pickles', 'are', 'packed', 'Veronica', 'was', 'working', '3', 'different', 'cases', 'Logan', 'mother', 'Meg', 'secret', 'admirer', 'finding', 'Tom', 'Cruz', 'actor', 'none', 'were', 'fillers', 'had', 'satisfying', 'conclusions', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'episode', 'actually', 'ended', 'cliffhanger', 'totally', 'different', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'you.Grade']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

In fact, I had to push myself to finish it.  Sometimes I would fall asleep while watching it.All this changed with Veronica and Logan's first kiss.  It's as if this event sparked the series and gave it an interesting edge.  The chemistry between the 2 is great, and Logan is just such an interesting character.  I disliked him tremendously at the beginning, and then found myself rooting for him to the point that I hope he is the one at Veronica's door (cliffhanger at the end of season 1).However, I was disturbed by the following inconsistencies in the show:1.  Veronica Mars' metamorphosis from popular, carefree and superficial teenager (before Lilly's murder) to mature, conscientious, justice-seeking, courageous sleuth (after Lilly's murder) is just not believable.  There is nothing in those flashbacks to suggest she had IT in her.  We do not see how someone who was so sweet, innocent and sheltered could become so hard-edged and cynical.2. At the beginning I found the show to depict a very dark, aggressive high-school environment.  I don't remember high school being like that, but maybe that's they way things are these days.3.  It is highly unlikely that someone who is so much in love with her ex would destroy DNA test results that could prove he is not her half brother, especially someone who is a ""detective"".4.  I did not like her disguises on a couple of shows.  It made me think the creators were trying to go for a Sidney Bristow (Alias) in high school.All this said, Veronica Mars, did manage to hook me, even though it was towards the end, and even though I guessed who Lilly's murderer was 3 shows before the last one.I will buy the second season and hope the writers will have worked out the kinks.",4,"GOOD, BUT...",1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2071,"['WARNING', 'PLOT', 'SPOILERSI', 'had', 'been', 'tempted', 'buy', 'series', 'high', 'reviews', 'received', 'Amazon', 'what', 'really', 'clinched', 'was', 'Stephen', 'King', 'nod', 'article', 'wrote', 'entertainment', 'magazine.While', 'found', 'series', 'entertaining', 'was', 'not', 'obsessed', 'watching', 'do', 'when', 'find', 'series', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'fact', 'had', 'push', 'finish', 'Sometimes', 'would', 'fall', 'asleep', 'watching', 'it.All', 'changed', 'Veronica', 'Logan', 'first', 'kiss', 'event', 'sparked', 'series', 'gave', 'interesting', 'edge', 'chemistry', '2', 'great', 'Logan', 'just', 'such', 'interesting', 'character', 'disliked', 'tremendously', 'beginning', 'then', 'found', 'rooting', 'point', 'hope', 'one', 'Veronica', 'door', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'season', '1', '.However', 'was', 'disturbed', 'following', 'inconsistencies', 'show:1', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'metamorphosis', 'popular', 'carefree', 'superficial', 'teenager', 'Lilly', 'murder', 'mature', 'conscientious', 'justice-seeking', 'courageous', 'sleuth', 'Lilly', 'murder', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'nothing', 'flashbacks', 'suggest', 'had', 'IT', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'sheltered', 'could', 'become', 'so', 'hard-edged', 'cynical.2', 'beginning', 'found', 'show', 'depict', 'very', 'dark', 'aggressive', 'high-school', 'environment', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'high', 'school', 'being', 'maybe', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'days.3', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'ex', 'would', 'destroy', 'DNA', 'test', 'results', 'could', 'prove', 'not', 'half', 'brother', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', 'detective', '.4', 'did', 'not', 'disguises', 'couple', 'shows', 'made', 'think', 'creators', 'were', 'trying', 'go', 'Sidney', 'Bristow', 'Alias', 'high', 'school.All', 'said', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'did', 'manage', 'hook', 'even', 'was', 'end', 'even', 'guessed', 'who', 'Lilly', 'murderer', 'was', '3', 'shows', 'last', 'one.I', 'will', 'buy', 'second', 'season', 'hope', 'writers', 'will', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'kinks']",Veronica Mars: Season 1

921941,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000A59PMO,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[6, 7]","There are two types of people that are thinking of buying this series - those who loved the show and have been waiting for the series, and those who have caught a few episodes (either during the Lost rerun season or on Sundays), find it intriguing and want to know more. The former are going to buy it. To the latter, yes you must buy this.One of the irritating things about watching a series with a continuing storyline is coming in at the middle and dealing with the reruns. To make matters more fun, UPN was showing reruns from both the first season and the second season. So in one episode a character is in jail and in the next he's attending a party. And then one episode pretty much required Season One knowledge as it served as an epilogue to the events of season one complete with the patsy, the patsy's daughter, the ""evil"" agent, and the real murderer. Watching that show before seeing season 1 is frustration - both for the show itself and knowing who the killer is when you watch season one. However, it doesn't ruin season one - just helps you to fill in the blanks a little faster.When I first heard of this show, I thought it was a dumb idea and it's a hard sell, but watching a few episodes really clues me into the genius of Rob Thomas. In a detective series, no one is who they appear to be (to paraphrase G'Kar from the quintessential continuing storyline show) and everyone is under suspicion. In high school, the same dynamic works. The popular cheerleader who has everything going for her has an eating disorder. The freaky kids on the stoner table have more sensitivity than realized. The star football players could be sociopaths or wonderful guys. And a significant portion of the students are gay and very much in the closet.With Veronica Mars, the tension between image and reality plays out through most of the supporting characters. Secrets come out and go back into hiding. The murder mystery takes a backseat to the mystery of who date raped Veronica at a party and why her boyfriend Duncan dumped her so quickly. While Weevil, Duncan, Veronica and the rest of the supporting characters have their secrets and their images, Dohring's turn as Logan Ecchols really plays out.

There's little chance I'd have bothered to investigate it had Joss Whedon not raved about the show on-line.  I decided that I had nothing to lose by giving it a shot, so I went out to Best Buy and picked up the first season.  That was, without a doubt, one of the finest decisions of my young life.""Veronica Mars"" centers on - surprise! - Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell).  Veronica's a high school junior living in Neptune, California, a town populated almost solely by the rich and famous.  Veronica's family is neither rich nor famous, but they may be a little infamous.  Veronica's father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), runs a detective agency and was, at one time, Neptune's sheriff.  That was before the incident that changed Neptune and its inhabitants forever - the murder of Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried).  When the murder occured, Keith Mars accused Lilly's father, billionaire Jake Kane (Kyle Secor) - a move which resulted in the Mars family being shunned by the rest of Neptune and the departure of Veronica's mom, Lianne Mars (Corinne Bohrer).  Now Veronica has devoted her life to clearing her father's name, while dealing with life's many hardships - as well as the negativity from almost everyone around her.I was absolutely mesmerized by this series from the moment the pilot began.  The acting is flawless.  Kristen Bell is just wonderful as Veronica, and Enrico Colantoni is terrific as her loving dad.  Jason Dohring is perfect as Logan Echolls, Veronica's friend-turned-tormentor, while Teddy Dunn plays the part of Duncan Kane, Veronica's ex-boyfriend, very well.  The writing is witty and very clever, not to mention unpredictable - this series is just full of plot twists.  When Lilly's killer is at long last revealed, you won't see it coming.  There's also a fantastic soundtrack, including a magnificent score by Josh Kramon.  To top it off, the show's lighting is noticeably unique and really makes the show seem all the more great.Try as I may to review this season, I really cannot find the words to describe the brilliance of this show.  It's been compared to ""Buffy"", though I think that if anything the show resembles ""Twin Peaks""; truth be told, ""Veronica Mars"" is one of the most unique shows to hit TV in the last decade.  (God bless you, Rob Thomas!) I can rave about this show endlessly, but to know what the show's really like you've gotta buy it.  I can promise you that you will adore this series.Never has a first season of anything been so wonderful as the first season of ""Veronica Mars"".

921952,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B000A59PMO,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[20, 25]","""Veronica Mars"" is one of those rare tv shows that one the outside seem like a wannabe, but when you watch it, it only takes a few minutes before it gets its hooks into you and doesn't let you go; it just straps you in for one hell of a ride.  Ever since the demise of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" I have been searching the air waves for a worthy replacement with ""Gilmore Girls"" becoming the only option.  But then last September I read a newspaper article titled ""Buffy the next generation"" and out of pure curiosity I tuned into an MTV rerun of the pilot.Within minutes I was hooked, but I didn't know why.  The show looked like the OC, talked like Buffy, acted like Gilmore Girls, and felt like nothing I have ever seen.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the show kept bringing me back for more.  Finally I realized that there where two reasons.  The first was the incredible writting.  No show in the annals of history was written like ""buffy the vampire slayer"" but Veronica Mars is giving her a run for her money.  The creators happen to fill the seasons full of episodes that although having no pure focus on the season-long plot, but they helped the season arc along its merry way every single week (that takes alot of planning and pathents) and instead of felling rushed like ""angel"" or being a letdown like ""x-files"" it leads to a sacisfactory ending.  The second reason this show is so likable is the incredible Kristine Bell.  There is no comment to praisworthy not to fit ms. bell, she has the looks of sarah michelle gellar (without the nasty aura), she has the vocabulary of Lauren Grahm, the charm of alyson hannigan, and the innocence of Dakota Flanning.  It will be a downright shame is the Emmys don't recongize her this Thursday was a nomination.I've gone on about how awesome the show is, yet I havn't really told you what it is about.  The show is about Veronica Mars, a 17-year-old girl thats live in the town of Neptune, California (a San Diego Suburb where either your parents makes millions of dollars a year or works for the parents that makes millions of dollars a year) and has a part-time job as the secretary or her father's detective agency, but most the time she is doing the detiving.  The main plot that takes the entire season to play out is how a few months ago her best friend was murdered and at the time her dad was the sheriff and he blamed the girls parents which caused the town to out him of the sheriff position and in turned made Veronica go from Popular to geek.  Durring the season Veronica puts the clues together to who married her friend, and how it was covered up.There is noway that a person can fit enough good things about this show in one review... And there are no negitive comments that i can think of.  If you are a fan of quality television this is the show for you!

On personal experience, it was available at seeming outrageous prices at local stores (even used!), so I opted to order through Amazon (through another vendor but was fulfilled by Amazon , ie: I got the Prime rates).

Instead, it's an m-lock DVD box that stacks all six discs on top of each other. Only one secure lock to hold ALL six discs which, again, are stacked on top of each other.

Kristen Bell enbodies Veronica Mars a girl like Buffy Summers was once a popular girl in high school but because of circumstances out of her control.  In Buffy's case becoming The Slayer.  In Veronica's case however, it is being the daughter of the man who led a witch against Jake Kane the equivelent of Steve Jobs (owner of Apple Computer) in the series' whose daughter Lily Kane was murdered in cold blood who also happened to be Veronica's best friend and older brother of her lover Duncan Kane.  One thing that can be said, about the series' is that there are plot twists that you do not see coming.  Characters who may appear the stereotypes of high school but they are not.  This is not your typical ""teen series"" like out of her own father's mouth she's 17 going on 40.  Veronica is very self aware about who she was before her best friend Lily passed away and who she is now.  She realizes the only reason she was ever popular was her relationship with the Kanes.  I think that only makes her so different than Buffy Summers who never knew where she fit; Veronica knows exactly who she is now.  This is not your typical ""genre"" series' either.  I couldn't tell you one episode from the other because all of Season One feels like one huge film.
