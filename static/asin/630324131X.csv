365579,A1L3JKXFHGJ9TS,630324131X,"Fernando Silva ""fedo""","[19, 20]","I'm reviewing the Alpha DVD Edition of this film, the three stars I gave the product are due to the bad quality of the transfer, because I'd given the film alone, four and half stars. With Alpha's DVD Editions, you either have the luck of getting decent copies (sometimes even very good ones like ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"") or awful ones, like this one in particular.The film is based upon a Play of an Agatha Christie Story and is superbly directed by Rowland V.Lee, with an almost complete English Cast, except for Ms. Harding. The plot is quite simple and suspenseful: a working girl wins a huge amount of money in the Lottery and meets a mysterious, attractive man.It was filmed in 1937, when the leading actress' stardom (Ann Harding) had already waned in the United States (after being one of the Top Stars during the Early Sound Era). Nonetheless, her acting ability and talent are obvious as well as her charm and grace. Basil Rathbone is excellent too as the mysterious man who arrives into her life, giving a skilled performance.The rest of the supporting cast is very good too and the sets and the film's atmosphere give the proper background to this entertaining story. In spite of the bad quality of the transfer, I could enjoy the film's plot completely, because it's so absorbing and well paced, that you forget about the ""technical flaws"" of the copy.If you liked Robert Montgomery's ""Night Must Fall"", this one's for you.

365583,A1ADZQOL0PLBEW,630324131X,Scadhog,"[1, 1]","""Love From a Stranger"" is a seldom seen 1930's thriller based On Agatha Christie' short story ""Philomel Cottage"".  A young woman (Ann Harding) wins a lottery and impulsively marries a suave, mysterious stranger (Basil Rathbone).  As time passes she becomes convinced that he married her for her money and is planning to kill her.One interesting aspect of the movie is the presence of a very young Joan Hickson, who went on to play Miss Marple decades later in the series on PBS.  In this one she plays a simpleminded maid.Somewhat reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's later film ""Suspicion"", this is a fairly entertaining movie.  The acting ranges from stilted (Harding and most of the rest of the cast) to outrageously over the top (Rathbone).  The picture quality is very poor, with everything washed out.  Perhaps this is due to the age of the movie or a poor transfer to DVD.  The writing is okay.  The film does achieve a certain amount of suspense toward the end, although it is somewhat lessened by Rathbone's hammy performance.This is a film I have wanted to see for a long time.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.  Still, it's worth a viewing for Agatha Christie fans.",3,So-so Agatha Christie,1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,1192,"['Love', 'Stranger', 'seldom', 'seen', '1930', 'thriller', 'based', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'short', 'story', 'Philomel', 'Cottage', 'young', 'woman', 'Ann', 'Harding', 'lottery', 'impulsively', 'suave', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'time', 'convinced', 'married', 'money', 'planning', 'kill', 'her.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'presence', 'very', 'young', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'who', 'went', 'play', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'decades', 'later', 'series', 'PBS', 'one', 'simpleminded', 'maid.Somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'later', 'film', 'Suspicion', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'acting', 'ranges', 'stilted', 'Harding', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'outrageously', 'top', 'Rathbone', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'poor', 'everything', 'washed', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'due', 'age', 'movie', 'poor', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'writing', 'okay', 'film', 'achieve', 'certain', 'amount', 'suspense', 'end', 'somewhat', 'lessened', 'Rathbone', 'hammy', 'performance.This', 'film', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'long', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'Still', 'viewing', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'fans']",Love from a Stranger VHS
365584,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,630324131X,"""scotsladdie""","[6, 6]","Based upon the novel PHILOMEL COTTAGE by the great Agatha Christie, this film proves to be a top-notch thriller with brilliant acting between Harding and Rathbone. The plot has Harding justly suspecting Rathbone of wanting to murder her for her money and a clever cat and mouse game ensues, which is thrilling to watch. When Harding (who had just won the lottery) sits down to dinner, knowing the servant has been sent off, the doors are locked and she's all alone with Rathbone in their remote country cottage, it's very scary: she realises what she's married. Ann Harding, all but forgotten today, was a beautifully genteel actress who could really act as well; it's a shame more of her old movies aren't yet on video (I caught THE LIFE OF VERGIE WINTERS one night on TV and she was magnificent!)
