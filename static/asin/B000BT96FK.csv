949101,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B000BT96FK,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[14, 15]","If you are new to Ballykissangel this is a fine show, but it is not the place to jump into this entertaining pastiche of small town Irish life (real or idealized). Season four is not just the fourth year of this program, but really is just the first of several attempts at trying to reinvent itself after huge cast changes.  Bit players Liam & Donal who did their job well as hapless hired hands to the focal character of the show (Brian Quigley) have had their roles upped several fold during this year.  Thus we see them dredge for gold balls in one of the water hazard's at Quigley's golf course. One of them mysteriously (with no explannation) becomes the guardian of a ""pet"" bear; a bear, who obviously then reeks a bit havoc.  The eccentric uncle (making his first appearance) of this Donal character also does likewise with the town in the season's finale.  New faces are also introduced.  The town has a new priest (who brings his sister), a new farmer (with his teenage daughter), and the old farmer's presence is complicated by the arrival of his nephew (also a young adult who predictably catches the eye of the new gal in town).  In short, a lot is new herein & it takes a bit to absorb all of it since all 5 newcomers are introduced en masse.  3 of these, incidentially, are flat-out successful in the roles and add much to providing much needed ballast after the 3rd season lost the progam's 2 central characters.  Father Aiden, as the new understudy to Father Mac, helps to re-center the plot  and his sister provides much needed livliness.  If you pick up the show with this season, however, it'll be odd to go back to the first 3 seasons.  So do partake of the initial 3 seasons (whose episodes, generally speaking, don't significantly suffer much with repeated viewings) first, then delve into and give this selection a try.  (And, if you haven't seen it yet, do treat yourself to seeing the very Irish and funny film ""Waking Ned Devine"".)

The magic just wasn't there as it had been in the first 3 series. Although the series features a large cast with the various storylines the real story centered around Father Clifford and Assumpta, once they were gone what made the series special just wasn't there anymore. The character Sean Dillon is a much needed boost to the series although I find his daughter a little annoying. I wasn't a fan of the new female character as I felt that she was always the person people turned to and she just happened to know or help the person out, i didn't think that was very realistic. The actors who played Father Clifford and Assumpta became a couple in real life during the filming but eventually broke up.

949134,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000BT96FK,Joseph Haschka,"[10, 12]","In case you haven't tuned-in to the British series BALLYKISSANGEL that aired on the telly from 1996 to 2001, its premise was to follow the career of a young priest assigned to the parish church in the Irish town of Ballykissangel (real-life Avoca, County Wicklow, Ireland), and specifically as he interacted with the town's cast of colorful and/or misfit characters. In series 1-3, the priest was Father Peter Clifford (Stephen Tompkinson), and it soon became evident that he was imperiling his priestly vows by falling for the owner of the local pub, Assumpta Fitzgerald (Dervla Kirwan). The growing sexual tension between the two, in addition to the charming and humorous subplots of each episode involving the village's other residents, made the series watchable to the point of addiction.At the end of series 3, Assumpta dies tragically, and Fr. Clifford, grievously heartbroken, departs abruptly. From that point on, beginning with the first episode of series 4, the production becomes but a shadow of its former self.The new priest, a former monk, is Fr. Aidan O'Connell (Don Wycherley), whose character is totally colorless and out of his depth. Without the Clifford-Assumpta axis, the other cast regulars gamely attempt to carry on: the local wheeler-dealer and business schemer, Brian Quigley (Tony Doyle), his daughter Niamh (Tina Kellegher), who takes over ownership and management of Fitzgerald's pub while staying married to Ballykissangel's deer-caught-in-the-headlights Garda officer, Ambrose Egan (Peter Hanly), and Quigley's two idjit can-carriers, Donal (Frankie McCafferty) and Liam (Joe Savino). But, it's just not the same - not even close.Casting tried to keep things alive with several new personae, the most intriguing of which is Fr. Aidan's somewhat mysterious sister, Orla (Victoria Smurfit). Orla is steamy, but by the time I gave up on series 4 at episode 9, the writers had failed to take her character much of anywhere. Probably the most useless newcomer is Colin Farrell as shepherd Eamonn's nephew Danny, on the lam from the big city with a favorite horse for some unexplained reason. With this small-screen appearance, Farrell was perhaps trying to duplicate the early 90s success of Catherine Zeta-Jones in British television's popularThe Darling Buds of May: When the Green Woods Laugh. But, unlike the luscious Catherine, Colin manages only a scruffy and lumpish taciturnity. In any case, it was impossible for this viewer to engage with Danny; another segment of stacked-stone wall around his uncle's pasture would've been more entertaining. Perhaps female viewers find him attractively enigmatic. (Ok, ok, I see the political incorrectness here; Victoria and Catherine are both Hot Babes, and Colin might as well be a rock. I'm a Male Pig; so sue me.)At one point during the filming of BALLYKISSANGEL, Tompkinson and Kirwan became engaged, but they later separated after leaving the show. This perhaps illustrates the improbable truth that television art sometimes mimics real life and, in the cases of BALLYKISSANGEL and its protagonists' love affair, all good things must end. Two stars in admonition of what the former once was and fails to be.Requiescat in pace.",2,Heretofore engaging series achieves epic mediocrity,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,3205,"['case', 'have', ""n't"", 'tuned-in', 'British', 'series', 'BALLYKISSANGEL', 'aired', 'telly', '1996', '2001', 'premise', 'was', 'follow', 'career', 'young', 'priest', 'assigned', 'parish', 'church', 'Irish', 'town', 'Ballykissangel', 'real-life', 'Avoca', 'County', 'Wicklow', 'Ireland', 'specifically', 'interacted', 'town', 'cast', 'colorful', 'and/or', 'misfit', 'characters', 'series', '1-3', 'priest', 'was', 'Father', 'Peter', 'Clifford', 'Stephen', 'Tompkinson', 'soon', 'became', 'evident', 'was', 'imperiling', 'priestly', 'vows', 'falling', 'owner', 'local', 'pub', 'Assumpta', 'Fitzgerald', 'Dervla', 'Kirwan', 'growing', 'sexual', 'tension', 'two', 'addition', 'charming', 'humorous', 'subplots', 'episode', 'involving', 'village', 'other', 'residents', 'made', 'series', 'watchable', 'point', 'end', 'series', '3', 'Assumpta', 'tragically', 'Fr', 'Clifford', 'grievously', 'heartbroken', 'abruptly', 'point', 'beginning', 'first', 'episode', 'series', '4', 'production', 'shadow', 'former', 'self.The', 'new', 'priest', 'former', 'monk', 'Fr', 'Aidan', ""O'Connell"", 'Don', 'Wycherley', 'character', 'totally', 'colorless', 'depth', 'Clifford-Assumpta', 'axis', 'other', 'cast', 'regulars', 'gamely', 'attempt', 'carry', 'local', 'wheeler-dealer', 'business', 'schemer', 'Brian', 'Quigley', 'Tony', 'Doyle', 'daughter', 'Niamh', 'Tina', 'Kellegher', 'who', 'ownership', 'management', 'Fitzgerald', 'pub', 'staying', 'married', 'Ballykissangel', 'deer-caught-in-the-headlights', 'Garda', 'officer', 'Ambrose', 'Egan', 'Peter', 'Hanly', 'Quigley', 'two', 'idjit', 'can-carriers', 'Donal', 'Frankie', 'McCafferty', 'Liam', 'Joe', 'Savino', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'not', 'even', 'close.Casting', 'tried', 'keep', 'things', 'alive', 'several', 'new', 'personae', 'most', 'intriguing', 'Fr', 'Aidan', 'somewhat', 'mysterious', 'sister', 'Orla', 'Victoria', 'Smurfit', 'Orla', 'steamy', 'time', 'gave', 'up', 'series', '4', 'episode', '9', 'writers', 'had', 'failed', 'take', 'character', 'much', 'anywhere', 'Probably', 'most', 'useless', 'newcomer', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'shepherd', 'Eamonn', 'nephew', 'Danny', 'lam', 'big', 'city', 'favorite', 'horse', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'small-screen', 'appearance', 'Farrell', 'was', 'perhaps', 'trying', 'duplicate', 'early', '90s', 'success', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'British', 'television', 'popularThe', 'Darling', 'Buds', 'May', 'When', 'Green', 'Woods', 'Laugh', 'luscious', 'Catherine', 'Colin', 'only', 'scruffy', 'lumpish', 'taciturnity', 'case', 'was', 'impossible', 'viewer', 'engage', 'Danny', 'segment', 'stacked-stone', 'wall', 'uncle', 'pasture', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Perhaps', 'female', 'viewers', 'find', 'attractively', 'enigmatic', 'Ok', 'ok', 'see', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'here', 'Victoria', 'Catherine', 'are', 'Hot', 'Babes', 'Colin', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'rock', ""'m"", 'Male', 'Pig', 'so', 'sue', 'one', 'point', 'filming', 'BALLYKISSANGEL', 'Tompkinson', 'Kirwan', 'became', 'engaged', 'later', 'separated', 'leaving', 'show', 'perhaps', 'improbable', 'truth', 'television', 'art', 'sometimes', 'mimics', 'real', 'life', 'cases', 'BALLYKISSANGEL', 'protagonists', 'love', 'affair', 'good', 'things', 'must', 'end', 'Two', 'stars', 'admonition', 'what', 'former', 'once', 'was', 'be.Requiescat', 'pace']",N/A
