420059,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6304411464,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","STAY HUNGRY (1976)  is an interesting film set in Birmingham, AL. In Arnold Schwarzenegger's first major role he plays himself: a bodybuilder who's come to the U.S. from Austria to compete in the Mr. Universe (Universum) contest. Arnold's body is nothing less than magnificent, as we finally see during the contest. His character (Joe Santo) also strokes a mean hillbilly fiddle in this one.The main story is a rocky romance between Beau Bridges and Sally Field. His parents have died in a plane crash and Beau is living in their Southern mansion, a totally unmotivated guy who seems to live for fun: hunting, sports, etc. Scatman Crothers has been caretaker at the family estate for 52 years, but seeing the way Beau and Sally are carrying on has made him decide to retire.The biggest surprise here is Robert Englund (aka ""Freddie Krueger"" inA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), a Britisher who has that Alabama accent down cold. He works at a gym where Arnold is training. This place is the only piece of property that a syndicate headed by thuggish Joe Spinell (remember him as Balboa's boss inROCKY?) has been unable to buy. He's brought Beau in to help with acquiring this plot of land, but gym owner R.G. Armstrong refuses to sell. This impasse leads to the story's most dramatic moments.Also in the cast: Woodrow Parfrey (mustachioed character actor who resembles Rip Taylor that you'd know if you saw him), Joanna Cassidy, Fannie Flagg and Ed Begley Jr. It's a small film but worth seeing, especially for anyone who'd enjoy a few peeks at Sally Field in her prime and unclothed. Also, Arnold, OMG what incredible muscles, and he knows it, too. Body building is pure narcissism!Zaniest sequence: all the oiled-up show contestants run through the streets of Birmingham and then pose for a gathered crowd, including several standing on top of a moving city bus as they flex.

420061,ALR35EFI69S5R,6304411464,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[30, 32]","For a film with the kind of ensemble star power that this art-film had, one woul d be surprised to find that it also was the first serious role for future mega-star Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing a suprisingly articulate and overwhelmingly personally irresistable bodybuilder, in essence, himself. yet this first attempt at serious acting was with the support of Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, both with big reputations , and also from famed director Bob Rafelson, who has done a lot of stellar work.The plot is a bit silly and contrived; Bridges plays a down on his luck good ole boy, who tries unsuccesfully at first to ploy  his charm into talking the owner of a small and musty gym into relinquishing his lease so Bridges' shady real estate partners can go ahead with a big down-town development. The problem is that Bridges begins to empathize with and befriend this motley crew of off-beat character, including the ever-smiling and instantly likeable Arnold, who shows himself to be quite adept at handling a fiddle. And incidentally, that really is him playing as the film cranks away.The film never saw wide distribution, but is quite interesting because of who was in it as well as for some of the connections hovering just below the surface. The screen writer was also the author of the original novel, a guy named Charles Gaines, who had gone on to later co-author the smash best selling book, &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;, whose primary focus of interest was, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is a good movie for a rainy afternoon, sweet and sentimental in all the right places, if somewhat insubstantial. Think of it as &quot;Going My Way&quot; on steroids! I think you'll be surprised how much you like it, in spite of some hokey moments.

420062,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6304411464,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This is an odd little film that could best be classified as comedy.  Three major stars perform the three primary roles, Jeff Bridges, Sally Field, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. This film is considered to be Schwarzenegger's first serious film role which is ironic because he seems to be playing himself, a smart likeable and sometimes wise mega-bodybuilder.  In fact, it is the Schwarzenegger character that offers the most unique perspective in this film for this world champion body builder serves as a wise catalyst and facilitator to link his former girl friend to a young rich boy trying to find himself but lacking focus and meaning. Sally Field plays the role of a southern girl (Mary Tae Farnsworth), daughter of the Sheriff of Prattville Alabama, who works in a gym in downtown Birmingham. Her relationship with Schwarzenegger is over and to some extent they have become close friends, so much so, that Schwarzenegger helps facilitate her new romance. I actually found this part of the story to be refreshing because I believe that it is possible for people to be lovers, recognize they make better friends than lovers, and then support each other's future life choices. The character played by Schwarzenegger is extremely likable since he is articulate, wise, calm, and dignified.The plot is all about the young man, played by Jeff Bridges (as Craig Blake), trying to find himself and in this instance it involves finding a country girl when all the wealthy girls are available, of trying to begin life as a businessman when his ancestors were among the steel families that built Birmingham, and of trying to find a moral compass when those in his peer group appear to be drunk and greedy good-ole-boys. Bridges plays this part well as he navigates the social scene at the Birmingham Country Club and the back-woods moonshine fiddle parties (where Schwarzenegger actually plays a mean fiddle). It is the body-building theme and characters that adds much to this story for in the gym we see heroes and villains, just as we saw heroes and villains in the Country Club set that Bridges from which Bridges is trying to extricate himself.The novel on which the screenplay is written was by Birmingham native Charles Gaines who later wrote ""Pumping Iron"" with Schwarzenegger as the central character.  Actress, novelist, and screenwriter Fanny Flagg plays a Birmingham socialite in the film. Overall, it is a treat to watch the film if you are from Birmingham because so many familiar landmarks are integrated into the film. The mansion where much of the action takes place is ironically not a southern plantation but was based on George Washington's home, Mt. Vernon. I lived in Birmingham when the film was being made and the Birmingham News reported daily on film activities in the city. It is an interesting film in that Schwarzenegger plays his first serious part and Sally Field plays a nude scene and begins to break from the image she had built as a cute little nun in her TV series The Flying Nun. Jeff Bridges gets to play one of the first of a long line of conflicted characters he will play in his career. I recommend it, it is unique.",4,Southern boy gets good advice from a muscle hunk,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,3148,"['odd', 'little', 'film', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'classified', 'comedy', 'Three', 'major', 'stars', 'perform', 'three', 'primary', 'roles', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'film', 'considered', 'be', 'Schwarzenegger', 'first', 'serious', 'film', 'role', 'ironic', 'be', 'playing', 'smart', 'likeable', 'sometimes', 'wise', 'mega-bodybuilder', 'fact', 'Schwarzenegger', 'character', 'most', 'unique', 'perspective', 'film', 'world', 'champion', 'body', 'builder', 'wise', 'catalyst', 'facilitator', 'link', 'former', 'girl', 'friend', 'young', 'rich', 'boy', 'trying', 'find', 'lacking', 'focus', 'meaning', 'Sally', 'Field', 'role', 'southern', 'girl', 'Mary', 'Tae', 'Farnsworth', 'daughter', 'Sheriff', 'Prattville', 'Alabama', 'who', 'gym', 'downtown', 'Birmingham', 'relationship', 'Schwarzenegger', 'over', 'extent', 'have', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'Schwarzenegger', 'facilitate', 'new', 'romance', 'actually', 'found', 'part', 'story', 'be', 'refreshing', 'believe', 'possible', 'people', 'be', 'lovers', 'recognize', 'make', 'better', 'friends', 'lovers', 'then', 'support', 'other', 'future', 'life', 'choices', 'character', 'played', 'Schwarzenegger', 'extremely', 'likable', 'articulate', 'wise', 'calm', 'dignified.The', 'plot', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Craig', 'Blake', 'trying', 'find', 'instance', 'finding', 'country', 'girl', 'when', 'wealthy', 'girls', 'are', 'available', 'trying', 'begin', 'life', 'businessman', 'when', 'ancestors', 'were', 'steel', 'families', 'built', 'Birmingham', 'trying', 'find', 'moral', 'compass', 'when', 'peer', 'group', 'appear', 'be', 'drunk', 'greedy', 'good-ole-boys', 'Bridges', 'part', 'well', 'social', 'scene', 'Birmingham', 'Country', 'Club', 'back-woods', 'moonshine', 'fiddle', 'parties', 'where', 'Schwarzenegger', 'actually', 'mean', 'fiddle', 'body-building', 'theme', 'characters', 'much', 'story', 'gym', 'see', 'heroes', 'villains', 'just', 'saw', 'heroes', 'villains', 'Country', 'Club', 'set', 'Bridges', 'Bridges', 'trying', 'extricate', 'himself.The', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'written', 'was', 'Birmingham', 'native', 'Charles', 'Gaines', 'who', 'later', 'wrote', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'Schwarzenegger', 'central', 'character', 'Actress', 'novelist', 'screenwriter', 'Fanny', 'Flagg', 'Birmingham', 'socialite', 'film', 'Overall', 'treat', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'Birmingham', 'so', 'many', 'familiar', 'landmarks', 'are', 'integrated', 'film', 'mansion', 'where', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'ironically', 'not', 'southern', 'plantation', 'was', 'based', 'George', 'Washington', 'home', 'Mt', 'Vernon', 'lived', 'Birmingham', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'Birmingham', 'News', 'reported', 'daily', 'film', 'activities', 'city', 'interesting', 'film', 'Schwarzenegger', 'first', 'serious', 'part', 'Sally', 'Field', 'nude', 'scene', 'break', 'image', 'had', 'built', 'cute', 'little', 'nun', 'TV', 'series', 'Flying', 'Nun', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'play', 'one', 'first', 'long', 'line', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'will', 'play', 'career', 'recommend', 'unique']",Stay Hungry VHS
420063,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304411464,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Stay Hungry, directed by Bob Rafelson, has the charm of an amateur production, but at times it almost feels like a documentary. The standouts are two future Oscar winners--Jeff Bridges and Sally Fields--and the future Governor of California, The Terminator himself--Arnold Schwarzenegger. Those three really shine--in spite or because of their youth.Jeff Bridges is Craig Blake, the scion of a once rich Texas family now in decline. Now an orphan, he dwells in the family mansion as he tries to find his way in the world. Uncle Albert (Woodrow Parfray), in voice over, gives the exposition. His nephew may have fallen in with the wrong crowd, some shady real estate developers in plaid blazers, but he hopes that he will find his moral compass soon, and succeed at his chosen profession, whatever that turns out to be.In order to convince Thor Erickson, the gym owner, to sell out to the sleazy Real Estate developers Craig Blake tries to infiltrate the inner circle--Arnold as Joe Santo training for the Mr. Universe contest. He feigns interest at first, but as he comes under the spell of the charismatic body builder, not to mention Mary Tate Farnsworth, the yoga instructor (Sally Fields) who orbits in his wake, his allegiance shifts.Bridges is trying to find his moral compass, but he doesn't really have the navigational skills to withstand the peer pressure of the sleazy Real Estate Developers, or the spoiled socialite crowd he runs with. Though he has genuine feelings for the less well-to-do Mary Tate Farnsworth, he foolishly lets her wear a revealing dress to a posh party, virtually guaranteeing that she will be shunned. Arnold, on the other hand, warns her that she is dressed inappropriately. He is--by comparison--a paragon of virtue. Though he will love and leave Zoe (Joanna Cassidy), a socialite, saying he doesn't want to get too comfortable, that he wants to stay hungry--he is humble and handles most situations well. He is a born politician. Thor is banking on Arnold--Santo, I mean--winning the Mr. Universe contest, he may even be exploiting him--but Joe Santo is grateful and wants to pay him back. Thor wears a cheap toupee, drinks, sniffs amyl nitrate poppers, and may be getting a little too relaxed with the prize money he is holding for the body building contest. Trouble looms.Arnold is shown to be a man of many talents, not merely a body builder. He plays fiddle with a Bluegrass band, a talent he picked up at an amazingly brisk pace. I wonder if he can actually play the violin? I wouldn't put it past him. Though he might have had his image burnished somewhat by the film makers, it is easy to see why he was able to rise so quickly in politics. He is a Zen Master, a guru for the young grasshopper Bridges plays. Arnold Schwarzenegger won a Golden Globe Award for ""Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture"", even though his debut was in Hercules in New York (1969). In that one he was credited as Arnold Strong, but Stay Hungry bills him as ""Introducing Arnold Schwarzenegger.""That is one of the interesting things about Stay Hungry. Seeing Arnold, Bridges, and Fields at the beginning of their careers. Sally Fields is awesomely cute, and we get to see a lot of her, if you catch my drift. I liked her. I really liked her. She won an Oscar for Norma Rae and she was Forest Gump's Mum. She was Gidget AND the Flying Nun. She was even--not that anyone remembers--Bonnie Banner on Hey, Landlord! Lately she has been back on TV on Brothers & Sisters, and her love interest is Jeff's brother Beau Bridges! Now the title is starting to make sense.Jeff Bridges goes from shallow to deep over the course of the film (the dude abides), and Arnold--Arnold is just amazing. Even though he ended his political career in disgrace, he was able to keep up the facade until AFTER he was out of office. And since he can't be President, unless there is some kind of Constitutional Amendment--looking less and less likely now that his illicit affairs and illegitimate children have surfaced--he has gone as far as he can go in politics. I think the fact that he fooled everyone (except of course, me) for so long is a testament to his acting ability. He'll be back.The Bottom Line is that Stay Hungry is quite entertaining, and a chance to see some future stars just before they blow up to the Nth Magnitude. Besides the three stars, the supporting cast are excellent. Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger from Nightmare on Elm St.) is Arnold's 'grease man,' and R.G. Armstrong (Pruneface from Dick Tracy), as Thor, the gym owner, is an absolute hoot. Scatman Crothers is 'Shining' as Craig Blake's butler. There is also a scene with a very young Ed Begley Jr., and Helena Kallianiotes is the sassy karate instructor. Wasn't she in Five Easy Pieces? My fact checkers say yes she was, and that classic film was also directed by Bob Rafelson.

420064,A17TDSX354MP7Y,6304411464,CPTScott,"[4, 8]","I've been a fan of Arnold's for a long long time and enjoyed following his career as a bodybuilder and actor.I recently re-read his autobiography ""Education Of A Bodybuilder"" which is a great look into the life of this interesting and dedicated individual. The movie ""Stay Hungry"" was mentioned so I figured I'd try to see if I could check it out. Fortunately my library had a copy so I gave it a shot.My wife and I just finished watching it and all I could say was ""That's an hour and forty minutes of my life I'll never get back"".It had a great cast and the basic idea of the story wasn't bad.  It's about a rich heir from an old southern family who is involved with a bunch of seedy businessman who are trying to buy out some land to build a high rise. The last place that needs to be bought is a building w/ a ""fitness spa"" in it. The fellow (Jeff Bridges) who is trying to get the building ends up getting friendly with a bunch of the folks there, including falling in love w/ a quirky woman (Sally Field) and so he decides not to pursue the business deal much to the consternation (to put it nicely) of his business associates. Not a bad storyline but it really is done in a way that I found disjointed and silly to the point of almost insulting (I was insulted by the fact that I wasted my time). Perhaps it was a relevant approach during the era it was filmed (for example the old Peter Seller's Pink Panther movies don't stand up for me though were funny back when they were made, though other movies, such as Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"" is still as good today as it was back then, perhaps even better!).I guess for fans of Arnolds (and Sally Field and Jeff Bridges) there is a nostalgic element that they might find attractive (which is why I gave it two rather than one star) but for me it was really not worth the time.Obviously I'm one of a few people reviewing this who didn't like it so perhaps you should check it out and judge for yourself, I just wanted to share my impressions.I've written many reviews here and this is only one of a small handful of negative reviews I've given but I felt compelled to share my thoughts on it.On the flip side, if you are interested in early Arnold, check out ""Pumping Iron"" the 25 anniversary DVD, it's totally amazing and includes a 45 or so minute documentary on the making of ""Pumping Iron"" w/ lots of previously unreleased footage.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

These plans fall along the wayside when he falls for the gym's cute gymnast(Sally Field) and developes a friendship with the champion bodybuider(Schwarzenegger).This film takes a while to warm to because of it's unique rhythms.  Bridges' character isn't an easy one to warm to because he seems a little self-absorbed and impulsive.  That said, credit director Bob Rafelson for taking difficult material and making it interesting.  As for Arnold's performance, he's very charismatic and has little trouble tackling the dramatic elements required of him.

This was the turning point for all of the stars.The film takes place in Birmingham, Alabama.  The Blake's have been part of Birmingham society forever.  Craig (Jeff Bridges) recently lost his parents and are at odds with himself.  He has fallen in with some shady real estate developers.  Craig has been given the assignment to buy the last piece of property for a development.  This building is a gym.The gym contains an assortment of characters. The receptionist is Mary Kate Farnsworth (Sally Field), Joe Santo (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a former Mr. Austria training for the Mr. Universe Competition,Joe and Mary Kate take his Craig and his friend society Dorothy to the lake.  The lake is where Joe and Mary Kate go to relax.  This is the beginning of the relationship between Craig and Mary Kate.Craig gets further drawn into their culture when Joe takes him to meet some of his fiddling friends.  This is a great scene with people who play music just for enjoyment.Things start to go wrong for Craig when Craig's business partners trash the gym.  Then Joe brings Mary Kate and Joe to a country club event.  When Joe took Craig to his friends, the accept him for who he is but the country club set want Joe and Mary Kate to know they just guests.The day of the Mr. Universe contest arrives.  Troy and Vernon have been set up with hookers and Vernon and the hookers steal the prize money.  When the contestants suspect something is wrong, a crazy chase through the streets happen.  A lot of this is impromptu with the citizens of the city as observers.In the end, Craig and Mary Tate find each other.At the time of this film Sally Field was still in transition.  Norma Rae was still three years away and Sybil had not aired yet.  This was an early chance to see her potential.  She shines as the little hill girl who escaped to the big city.Jeff Bridges had some early success with films like The Last Picture Show.  But he never became a star in his own right.  Stay Hungry would be one of many great performances that he did not capitalize on.Arnold Schwarzenegger was the world's most renowned body builder but his first two films were disastrous quickies designed to capitalize on his name.  This was his first quality film.  Arnold knew that he over his head with this part, so he played it as close to himself as possible.  And that paid off for Arnold winning the Golden Globe and critics awards.The cast featured numerous actors that made their name in the 80's and 90's, mostly on television.  Robert Gilliland (Designing Women) played Craig's business partner.  Ed Begley, jr. (St. Elsewhere / Arrested Development) played a country club friend.  Fannie Flagg (The New Dick Van Dyke Show / Match Game) as a country club matron.  Joanna Cassidy (Who Framed Roger Rabbit / Six Feet Under) is a society dilettante.  Roger Mosley (Magnum PI) and Robert Englund (Nightmare on Elm Street) are two guys who work at the gym.
