1158283,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00180IPM6,Chris Luallen,"[4, 4]","Rosario is a single mom who has immigrated illegally to the United States in order to give her family the opportunity for a better life. But to do so she has had to leave her 9 year son, Carlitos, behind in Mexico. Carlitos misses his mother greatly. So, after his grandmother dies, Carlitos pays off some rookie Chicano smugglers to bring him into the USA. But the smugglers have their vehicle impounded at the border crossing in El Paso, Texas and from here Carlitos must embark on a difficult and treacherous journey to find his mother in Los Angeles.I first must say that this is not a top notch movie in certain aspects. It is predictable, sentimental, and has several gaps in logic. For example, why didn't Carlitos simply use the phone number of his mom's employer that had been given to him. But I guess realism isn't really the purpose of this movie. Instead it manages, quite successfully, to affect you emotionally. This is in large part due to a fine acting job by the young Adrian Alonso. He turns Carlitos into such a brave, bright, charming kid that it is impossible not to root for him.The debate over illegal immigration often is based on American's fears of those who are considered culturally and linguistically different. But this film really puts a human face on the difficult struggles facing so many illegal immigrants and the courage and determination they show while seeking to better their circumstances.The similarities that bring us together as human beings are so much greater than the differences of culture and language.

1158285,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00180IPM6,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","This certainly lived up to expectations of being ""a nice movie,"" an involving story about a young Mexican boy who sneaks into the United States to try to find his mother in Los Angeles.She had been in L.A. for four years and, frankly, I forget why. They don't dwell on that, but there must have been a good reason since she loves the kid and vice-versa. Each Sunday morning at 10, she calls him from the same spot. That's a key to the story.When the woman's mother dies, ""Carlito's"" grandmother who had been looking after the young boy, the kid decides his options aren't good at that point and he needs to take a big chance to see if he can find his way to Los Angeles. Yes, you have to suspend your beliefs here a bit, as the odds on a kid actually being able to do that - all with no money! - are astronomical, but it's fun to watch him on his journey and how he makes do with what little he has. Some of the friendships he makes are truly touching and in a way, the best part of the film.While writing this, it makes me flashback to the film ""The Straight Story"" when an old man on a tractor drives 300 miles across Iowa to see his long-lost brother. He is befriended by many people along the way, some who go to extraordinary lengths to help a stranger. That's the case here, too.We also get a good profile of the mother, her best friend and a wonderful man she meets during this story, all of which takes place in one week. Each ""chapter"" of the film is broken down into days. Yes, the film is slightly preachy concerning immigration but the story is so good that one forgets about the political aspect, no matter what side one is on.The last half hour will keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering exactly things how will turn out.

1158286,A1ENC0ALMHVBU,B00180IPM6,"D. HupFons ""Hup234""","[7, 7]","Excellent acting, superb directing, and a touching story.  Adrian Alonso, an amazingly talented young actor, and the also very talented Kate del Castillo lead this cast of mostly little known actors/actresses (except America Ferrera, who only has a small but important role) in a story that will warm your heart.Although the ending is somewhat predictable, the acting, directing, and plot twists are so well done that the movie will entertain you and keep you wondering how this drama will play out to its conclusion.  Expect to see more fine work in future films from Alonso, del Castillo, and the director Patricia Riggen.Be sure to watch BOTH special features.  The ""Making of"" is nearly 30  minutes long and well worth watching for more depth about the story, characters, director, and cast.  The 10-minute ""Mural"" feature is also excellent.  I particularly recommend viewing it AFTER watching the movie.  It provides an interesting behind the scenes look at a mural that was created in East LA about UNDER THE SAME MOON, but, even more intriguing is the glimpse it provides of this little understood art form and its role in the mostly Mexican/Hispano-American community within East LA.CAUTION: although most strident illegal immigration opponents would not be attracted to a movie of this nature, the film does subtly portray(through lyrics of the various songs on the music track of the film and through the heartbreaking portrayal of the separated mother and son) illicit cross-border forays sentimentally and somewhat justifiably.  It's clear to this viewer, especially after watching the ""Making of"" feature, that the director's intent was to highlight the HUMAN DRAMA that is part of the universal reality SHARED BY MANY people who leave behind their family and enter another country, legally or illegally.  I mention this because I did NOT find the film to be a ""pro"" illegal immigration treatment, but rather a heartfelt look into the real-life saga of separated loved ones, especially parents and their children.Overall, a strong 4.5 stars for this charming treat from our closest neighbor to the South (Mexico).

1158291,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00180IPM6,Grady Harp,"[41, 44]","Sensitive director Patricia Riggen has, in LA MISMA LUNA (UNDER THE SAME MOON), succeeded in creating a story about the travails of the illegal immigrants from Mexico that serves as a reminder to all of us that one of the reasons for the obsession to take the risks of crossing the border is an attempt to find a better life. While this story concept is by no means a novel one, writer Ligiah Villalobos has provided a script that avoids taking sides, but instead concentrates on creating wholly believable characters caught in the web of immigration - from both sides of the wall. This little film from Mexico is, above all, a film about love, about courage and about resilience and is portrayed by a very fine cast in every role.Rosario (Kate del Castillo) is a single mother who crossed the border four years earlier in order to support her young son Carlitos (a superb young actor, Adrian Alonso) and her ailing mother by working double jobs as a housekeeper in Los Angeles.  She keeps in touch with Carlitos with weekly phone calls and sends him gifts as well as money and love.  When Rosario's mother dies, Carlitos takes life into his own hands and plans to cross the border with a little help from his experience with a wise old lady Coyota (Carmen Salinas) who aids immigrants. With his savings in his backpack and his heart aimed toward Los Angeles he sets out on his journey and is thwarted at every turn.  He is picked up by two Hispanic students from the US (America Ferrara and Jesse Garcia) whose attempt to transport Carlitos is halted at the border - with the little Carlitos hidden under the seat of the now towed away car.  Carlos escapes from the car in El Paso, meets up with some illegal workers who are arrested, leaving the hidden Carlitos with a reluctant companion Enrique (Eugenio Derbez) who is able to aid Carlitos (reluctantly!) to escape to Los Angeles.  Through many 'jobs' and untoward situations Carlitos finally finds his way to the spot where he hopes he will meet his mother.The rhythms of the cinematography, the sets, the flavors of both sides of the border, and the music that accompanies the film all contribute to making this story real and believable - and VERY touching. While Kate del Castillo is the major star of the film, it is the performance by Adrian Alonso that remains in the mind long after the credits are shown.

You know who you are...smile...) It didn't matter! I was transported from the first frame.Carlitos, played by Adrian Alonzo, is a nine-year-old Mexican boy who lives with his grandmother and works for a &#34;Coyote.&#34; He sees many aspiring immigrants, desperate to get to the United States, fork over astonishing amounts of money for safe passage. Every Sunday morning at 10:00 AM, his mother calls him from a pay phone in California where she works as a domestic, saving her money to pay her son's way... eventually....The apple didn't fall very far from the tree, as he too, has been saving HIS money! They are both desperate to be together; she has been gone for four long, sad, formative years.His sickly grandmother dies in the night and Carlitos knows if he stays, a sleazy uncle will take over, simply to get his hands on the $300.00 Carlitos receives each month from his hard-working mother, played by the lovely Kate del Castillo. He has a general idea of how people cross the border, so he grabs his savings and takes off. Most of the script is in Spanish, and the captions are welcome, but the translation is realistic and authentic.America Ferrera from the television show &#34;Ugly Betty&#34; does a cameo in this film, and one of the principal actors, Eugenio Derbez, is evidently a well-known and much loved comic actor in Mexico. I know he's really good in THIS role.

Under the Same Moon almost flew under my radar after a read a few critical reviews of it that stressed the director's inexperience and reliance on clich&eacute;s... and yes it does get a little heavy handed with the emotions.  But it has a very compelling story, whether you believe in open borders or 50 foot high concrete walls.Carlito's contacts with his mother have been limited for the last four years to a once a week phone call to the local pay phone.  She's working in Los Angeles (illegally) and trying to save enough money for an immigration attorney to legalize her status and bring Carlito to live with her.  In the meantime, he lives with his grandmother and scratches for coins by selling chewing gum and doing odd jobs.  The film establishes him as a very resourceful kid early on, which lends a degree of believability to later developments.When his grandmother dies, Carlito enlists the help of two well-meaning (but decidedly amateur) people smugglers (one of whom played with understated perfection by America Ferrara of Ugly Betty fame).  As you might guess, things go wrong and Carlitos is soon fending for himself to travel from Texas to LA.Under the Same Moon could have been just a hokey piece of immigration propaganda, but it focuses more on a story of love held by mother and son.  And if you're lucky enough to watch it, you just might have your understanding expanded with regard to the erstwhile law breakers that constitute much of our illegal immigrant population.  Like a 9 year old boy determined to reunite with his mother, it's a complex scenario that won't easily be solved.One final note, we watched this Spanish language movie with our 11 year old granddaughter (the first time she's ever watched a subtitled film).

There are two parallel stories here:- one is the love story between a child and his mother, and how each will undergo great danger for the other, the other is the wider story of why people migrate. That story needs to be spelled out in words of one syllable to some people, and that is perhaps the reason why the film is so unsubtle. Rest assured, though, that this film isn't saying ""immigrants good, locals bad"", it shows humanity and inhumanity in both groups.

Zwick,"[1, 1]","Written by Ligiah Villalobos and directed by Patricia Riggen, ""Under the Same Moon"" is a bit like what you`d get if you crossed ""El Norte"" with a heart-tugging tale by Charles Dickens.  Nine-year-old Carlitos lives with his grandmother in Mexico while his mother struggles to make ends meet in Los Angeles.  Despite the harsh conditions of her life, Rosario is saving as much money as she can so that eventually Carlitos will be able to come and live with her.  When his grandmother dies, Carlitos decides to make the dangerous trek to LA on his own, encountering numerous obstacles and assorted colorful characters along the way.  (The plot is highly reminiscent of ""A Boy Ten Feet Tall,"" a British film from the 1960s in which an orphaned boy travels thousands of miles from Port Said to Durban, South Africa in search of the aunt who lives there).Sentimental in the best sense of that term, this crowd-pleasing tearjerker is a simple but touching tale of the undying love between a mother and a son and of the resilient spirit that allows people living in difficult circumstances to carry on and endure.  The movie shimmers with lovely performances by the exquisite Kate del Castillo as Carlitos' devoted, longsuffering mother; Maya Zapata as her no-nonsense, pragmatic best friend; Eugenio Derbez as a cynical day laborer who finds himself unexpectedly saddled with a pint-sized companion who always seems to get the better of him, and, above all, young Adrian Alonso who, as Carlitos, lights up the screen with his authenticity, sincerity and warmth.  (America Ferrera also has a small role as a college student from the states who smuggles babies across the border to help reunite them with their parents).In the tradition of ""The Bicycle Thief,"" ""Forbidden Games, "" ""Sundays and Cybele,"" ""The 400 Blows"" and countless others, ""Under the Same Moon"" is a small, heartfelt film that artfully conveys a child's-eye-view of the adult world.",4,sentimental crowd-pleaser,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,1942,"['Written', 'Ligiah', 'Villalobos', 'directed', 'Patricia', 'Riggen', 'Same', 'Moon', 'bit', 'what', 'd', 'get', 'crossed', 'El', 'Norte', 'heart-tugging', 'tale', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Nine-year-old', 'Carlitos', 'grandmother', 'Mexico', 'mother', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'life', 'Rosario', 'saving', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'can', 'so', 'eventually', 'Carlitos', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'come', 'live', 'When', 'grandmother', 'dies', 'Carlitos', 'make', 'dangerous', 'trek', 'LA', 'own', 'encountering', 'numerous', 'obstacles', 'assorted', 'colorful', 'characters', 'way', 'plot', 'highly', 'reminiscent', 'A', 'Boy', 'Ten', 'Feet', 'Tall', 'British', 'film', '1960s', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'travels', 'thousands', 'miles', 'Port', 'Said', 'Durban', 'South', 'Africa', 'search', 'aunt', 'who', '.Sentimental', 'best', 'sense', 'term', 'crowd-pleasing', 'tearjerker', 'simple', 'touching', 'tale', 'undying', 'love', 'mother', 'son', 'resilient', 'spirit', 'people', 'living', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'carry', 'endure', 'movie', 'shimmers', 'lovely', 'performances', 'exquisite', 'Kate', 'del', 'Castillo', 'Carlitos', 'devoted', 'longsuffering', 'mother', 'Maya', 'Zapata', 'no-nonsense', 'pragmatic', 'best', 'friend', 'Eugenio', 'Derbez', 'cynical', 'day', 'laborer', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'saddled', 'pint-sized', 'companion', 'who', 'always', 'get', 'better', 'young', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'who', 'Carlitos', 'up', 'screen', 'authenticity', 'sincerity', 'warmth', 'America', 'Ferrera', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'college', 'student', 'states', 'who', 'smuggles', 'babies', 'border', 'help', 'reunite', 'parents', '.In', 'tradition', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'Forbidden', 'Games', 'Sundays', 'Cybele', '400', 'Blows', 'countless', 'others', 'Same', 'Moon', 'small', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'artfully', ""child's-eye-view"", 'adult', 'world']",N/A

After being separated for four years, Carlitos' Grandmother dies, leaving him all alone with no way to contact his Mother.  When a friend refuses to help him cross the U.S. border, he seeks other means to find his Mother in Los Angeles.  The film is almost entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.Although touching and very funny (Enrique steals the show!), this film glorifies illegal immigration, insults people who have immigrated legally to the United States, and makes me wonder if Mexicans see all Americans as rich people who want to exploit them.  I can say that this movie really got into my head and heart and made me ponder this issue.As an American whose ancestors came through Ellis Island, I am angered that anyone would attempt to take advantage of the nation my family adopted legally.  As a Southern Nevadan, I see a partial reality of illegal immigration up close, and it's not pretty.  As a Christian, I am humbled to remove the plank of judgment from my own eye before plucking the splinter of illegal immigration from my brother's.  Illegal immigration is not just against the law.  It is sin.  And since I am not without sin, myself, I can only drop my stone and pray for my brothers and sisters.  My intent is not to sound preachy.  The film is of such a cutting-edge political issue, however, that it could be considered propaganda designed to incite illegal behavior.

I would hope instead that any movie watcher will see this film anyway and be rewarded with a life affirming family love story.The performances, graceful music, relevant locales and (sometimes rushed but believable) scenarios fill the story line with the necessary themes to make this an inspirational film. The Superman song is hilarious as I had never heard it before - great lyrics. The most interesting thing about this experience was my 6-year old daughter (who speaks only a few words of Spanish) was completely intrigued by the entire piece. The boy actor is obviously ahead of his years, and his expressions and delivery made my girl realize what was happening without even knowing the full dialogue.The DVD has a decent transfer, and both docus on the disc are worth watching. Docu #1 is over 30 minutes long covering the creation, inspiration and logistics of making the film. Only after watching it did I realize the power of the mother/son relationship showed in the film, even though they shared no scenes together. Docu #2 reveals the artwork/murals created for the film and in respect to the film throughout the Boyle Heights and neighboring areas. For those that revel in the appreciation of mural artwork and the artists behind them - the DVD would be a must-see just for this.Putting aside all the political and personal issues being written here and elsewhere, I believe the whole family can sit down and watch this film.

We have seen that more recently in AKEELAH AND THE BEE, with Keke Palmer, Laurence Fishburne, Angela Bassett.LA MISMA LUNA spends much time with various misadventures of actor Adrian Alonso, who plays a 9-year old boy. Early in the movie, he must hide underneath an automobile seat to be smuggled into the U.S., with the goal of meeting his long-lost mother in Los Angeles. The boy is almost caught, during the border inspection. Also, the viewer worries about him suffering from heat exhaustion since he must hide in a hot automobile. America Ferrera of SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELLING PANTS, plays one of the smugglers driving the car. Then, the car is towed to El Paso (with the boy still under the seat).Once in the impoundment lot in El Paso, the boy escapes and meets up with a drug addict in a bus station. The boy wants the drug addict to drive him back to the impoundment lot, where he had accidently dropped his money (a wad of dollar bills). The drug addict is nervous and tense, and cavorts with dealers and pimps. When it turns out that the wad of money is no longer at the lot, the drug addict becomes more nervous and threatening.Eugenio Derbez meets up with the boy, during tomatoe-picking work in a greenhouse (in real life, Eugenio Derbez is a Mexican actor who usually plays comedic roles). Eugenio is an illegal alien, who lives on a day-to-day basis, finding jobs picking vegetables or washing dishes in restaurants. He tries to get rid of Adrian (the 9-year old) and tells him to stop following him like a puppy. Another cliff-hanger occurs, when the I.N.S. invade a tomato greenhouse, and try to round up the illegal aliens. Adrian and Eugenio escape.A turning point occurs, when a group of low-life thugs approaches Adrian, with thoughts of roughing him up, and stealing his backpack (another cliff-hanger). From that point on, Eugenio decides to take care of Adrian, and to ensure that he arrives in L.A. (to find his mother). The greatest moment in this film (in a film with many great moments), occurs when the police arrive to pick up the boy and Eugenio, sleeping in a city park. Eugenio runs away, and yells at the boy that he should run too. Eugenio willingly sacrifices himself (he is easily caught by the police), with the clear-cut goal of causing a distraction that facilitates the boy's escape.A comparison of Adrian's adventures, with those of Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, in STAR WARS, is inevitable. In both films, a likeable protagonist encounters various characters, some devious and shifty, some that are overtly evil, and others that at first appear shifty and immoral but turn out to be faithful and helpful.The film shifts back and forth from the boy and then to his mother, who works as a part-time maid in L.A. And so, in addition to the boy's continuous stream of adventuresome cliff-hangers, the viewer is provided with a more conventional tear-jerker account of his mother. The mother is miserable for being separated from her 9-year old (however, one might question the mother's instincts, as she has been in L.A. for four entire years.  Is life in Mexico that bad, that a mother would abandon her kid for four years?)The film has a happy ending. The ending is an act of genius, for two reasons. First of all, it ties together a mystery that involves a laundromat, mural, and pizza joint. In this sense, LA MISMA LUNA can be compared to CHINATOWN, with Jack Nicholson, or CITIZEN KANE, with Orson Wells. Both of these movies have the recurring theme of a mysterious clue, that is solved after much delay. The second reason, which occurs during the last few seconds of the film, as that this part of the film could very well be the most understated ending of any movie ever filmed.

The offer, basically, was several million dollars for all the land north of the densely inhabited states in southern Mexico. Included in this offer were the territories which included the US states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. These territories were held by Spaniards as land grants. Texas was not covered by the treaty because it had already been captured (do you remember the Alamo?)The reason that I bring up these facts is that most American don't know that all these states were once part of Mexico and that we bought a lot of real estate for pennies on the dollar.
