I have followed it for several years, so I was anxious to watch this movie.However, what came across as an interesting concept quickly turns into ""Who will have the next cameo"". There are several times in the movie where I felt the plot took a backseat to getting someone screen time.This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but the only thing to laugh at is the poor plot. I can not believe this movie was able to get the star power in it. Not even a high rolling cast of actors could save this terrible story.I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more poker and less filler and uninteresting plot lines.In the end, this is no where near the quality of movie I Was hoping it would be. If you are looking for a poker-ish movie watch Rounders or 21. Skip this one all together and save yourself the time.",2,Interesting concept poor execution,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,897,"['Let', 'prefice', 'review', 'saying', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'world', 'Series', 'Poker', 'ESPN', 'have', 'followed', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'anxious', 'watch', 'movie.However', 'what', 'came', 'across', 'interesting', 'concept', 'quickly', 'Who', 'will', 'have', 'next', 'cameo', 'are', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'where', 'felt', 'plot', 'took', 'backseat', 'getting', 'someone', 'screen', 'time.This', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'only', 'thing', 'laugh', 'poor', 'plot', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'star', 'power', 'Not', 'even', 'high', 'rolling', 'cast', 'actors', 'could', 'save', 'terrible', 'story.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'poker', 'less', 'filler', 'uninteresting', 'plot', 'lines.In', 'end', 'where', 'quality', 'movie', 'Was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'looking', 'poker-ish', 'movie', 'watch', 'Rounders', '21', 'Skip', 'one', 'together', 'save', 'time']",The Grand
1141555,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B0013ERFFU,Andrew McCaffrey,"[1, 3]","There's enough funny material in THE GRAND to construct a really funny, sharp comedy film, if the feature were on the short side (say about an hour).  Unfortunately, the film as released runs a long one hundred and four minutes.  It's notoriously difficult to stretch a light, comedy movie for over an hour and a half, and despite possessing a lot of good things one could say about it, THE GRAND shows us why length can hurt.The film starts with an entire tournament worth of poker players attempting to win a ten million dollar grand prize.  While eventually the cast is whittled down to six, many of the secondary characters get a fair amount of screen time.  The guy with the most compelling case for getting the money is Woody Harrelson (our protagonist), a man who is emerging from a two year stint in rehab and looking to win the money in order to keep his dead grandfather's casino financially afloat.The cast is filled with a plethora of well-known actors and comedians.  So much so that it's more of a shock when a new character is introduced and one doesn't, in fact, recognize the actor or actress.  For the most part, the cast is uniformly good; even actors I don't usually care for did an admirable job.  Kudos to the rarely seen Gabe Kaplan who easily walks away with every scene he's in.So it wouldn't be fair to point any fingers of blame for the film's woes in the direction of the actors.  The problems come mostly from the outline of the script and the pacing.  The film really starts to drag the farther along it goes.  This isn't helped by the fact that during the final third, the emphasis appears to move from telling jokes to concentrating on the outcome of the poker games.  I don't think this worked.  The poker stuff was fine when it was a stage for telling jokes, but I don't think it was developed enough for it to carry what nominally is a light and fun comedy.A film of this length isn't helped by recurring jokes and situations that simply aren't funny.  You'll remember the funny announcers from BEST IN SHOW.  There is a similar gimmick here, but it lightning fails to strike twice.  Just because something was funny in a similar mockumentary, it doesn't follow that the same idea will work in a different film.If you're a fan of any of the huge number of celebrities who appear, then you'll probably want to check it out.  And even if you aren't, this is still a film worth watching once.  The actors and comedians are all hugely funny.  Many of the one-liners and gags are simply great.  But there is some wasted potential here, which is a shame given the cast and the parts of the film that do succeed.",3,A cool half grand,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,2640,"['enough', 'funny', 'material', 'THE', 'GRAND', 'construct', 'really', 'funny', 'sharp', 'comedy', 'film', 'feature', 'were', 'short', 'side', 'say', 'hour', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'released', 'long', 'one', 'hundred', 'four', 'minutes', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'stretch', 'light', 'comedy', 'movie', 'hour', 'half', 'possessing', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'THE', 'GRAND', 'why', 'length', 'can', 'hurt.The', 'film', 'starts', 'entire', 'tournament', 'worth', 'poker', 'players', 'attempting', 'win', 'ten', 'million', 'dollar', 'grand', 'prize', 'eventually', 'cast', 'whittled', 'down', 'six', 'many', 'secondary', 'characters', 'get', 'fair', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'guy', 'most', 'compelling', 'case', 'getting', 'money', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'protagonist', 'man', 'who', 'emerging', 'two', 'year', 'stint', 'rehab', 'looking', 'win', 'money', 'order', 'keep', 'dead', 'grandfather', 'casino', 'financially', 'afloat.The', 'cast', 'filled', 'plethora', 'well-known', 'actors', 'comedians', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'shock', 'when', 'new', 'character', 'introduced', 'one', ""n't"", 'fact', 'recognize', 'actor', 'actress', 'most', 'part', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'good', 'even', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'care', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'Kudos', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Gabe', 'Kaplan', 'who', 'easily', 'away', 'scene', 'in.So', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair', 'point', 'fingers', 'blame', 'film', 'woes', 'direction', 'actors', 'problems', 'come', 'mostly', 'outline', 'script', 'pacing', 'film', 'really', 'drag', 'farther', ""n't"", 'helped', 'fact', 'final', 'third', 'emphasis', 'move', 'telling', 'jokes', 'concentrating', 'outcome', 'poker', 'games', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'poker', 'stuff', 'was', 'fine', 'when', 'was', 'stage', 'telling', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'developed', 'enough', 'carry', 'what', 'nominally', 'light', 'fun', 'comedy.A', 'film', 'length', ""n't"", 'helped', 'recurring', 'jokes', 'situations', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'funny', 'announcers', 'BEST', 'IN', 'SHOW', 'similar', 'gimmick', 'here', 'lightning', 'fails', 'strike', 'twice', 'Just', 'something', 'was', 'funny', 'similar', 'mockumentary', ""n't"", 'follow', 'same', 'idea', 'will', 'work', 'different', 'film.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'huge', 'number', 'celebrities', 'who', 'appear', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'still', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'actors', 'comedians', 'are', 'hugely', 'funny', 'Many', 'one-liners', 'gags', 'are', 'simply', 'great', 'wasted', 'potential', 'here', 'shame', 'given', 'cast', 'parts', 'film', 'do', 'succeed']",The Grand

He must battle his reputation, his inner demons, and his luck to take the crown and save himself and his casino.But, unfortunately, there's a lot holding back the film.

An hour into The Grand, I realized I had not laughed once.Here are (only some of) our characters (and some explanation why the work fails as comedy):Deuce Fairbanks:Dennis Farina plays this Rascal-riding poker-legend who assaults casino-goers with his power-scooter. Expect no surprises here.The German:Werner Herzog is a stereotypical blood-thirsty, sadistic German. He carts a menagerie of furry animals to the casino because he ""must kill something everyday."" Again, expect no surprises here.Harold Melvin:The name says it all. Chris Parnell plays a ""Rainman"" type character (sans the warmth but including the screaming). He is an uber-nerd who still lives with his mother (Estelle Harris) and obsessively carries a sippy-cup containing his vitamins (a.k.a. ""brainjuice""). Mocking people who suffer from Asperger Syndrome (or any form of Autism) ... not funny. Listening to George's mom from Seinfeld ""curse a blue-streak"" ... also not funny (or even shocking ... just low).Andy Andrew:""Mad About You""'s Richard Kind plays a small-town math teacher. He won his spot at The Grand through a real online poker-playing site (which I am not permitted to mention here). (Talk about shameless product-placement!!) His wife owns a ribbon-store (which is just a little too random for my taste ... silly for the sake of being silly).One-Eyed Jack Faro:The much-loved Woody Harrelson plays the heir to the ""Rabbit's Foot"" casino. Unfortunately, his destructive drug-habit proves a detriment to his business (no kidding).Some of televison's most adored stars play minor-roles: Hank Azaria, Ray Romano, Jason Alexander, Gabe Kaplan etc...

It starts off rather slowly, but Penn quickly hits his stride -- the resulting movie has all of Vegas' flashy glitz, and the quirk factor of a long-lost Christopher Guest mockumentary.Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson) inherited the Lucky Rabbit's Foot casino from his grandfather, but the casino has fallen on hard times -- primarily because Jack is addicted to everything he can snort, inject or drink, and he's been married seventy-four times. As the movie opens, he's been living in rehab for two years straight.Now a casino mogul (a gloriously cutthroat Michael McKean) is going to raze the Rabbit's Foot unless Jack can produce the money. His only hope is to win The Grand, a professional poker competition against some of the greatest poker players in the world -- including frustrated housewife, her obnoxious brother, a vitriol-tongued savant, a cutthroat veteran, a psychopathic German and a teacher from the Frostbite Amputation Capital of the World.So despite sponsoring the Grand, Faro joins it. But to save the Rabbit's Foot, he's not only going to have to survive the first rounds -- he'll have to use luck and skill to deal with the most cutthroat and/or talented poker players in the world. Tensions rise as the players work towards the final round -- but who will win ten million dollars?When one of the characters intently tells the camera that he recites the Mentat oath ""before I drink my brain juice,"" you know that Penn has hit comedic gold. The first ten minutes of ""The Grand"" are rather tedious, since Penn is only introducing the idea of the Grand and Faro's situation. But once he starts introducing the characters and bringing them together, the mockumentary really gets moving.It follows the basic mockumentary formula -- a camera follows the characters around, and they talk seriously about bizarre things. Animal murder, Star Trek, pyromania (""I got this blowtorch as a wedding present...""), addictions and winning the competition (""I want to see the others crushed and disappear and crumble,"" the German says with the calm of a true psychopath). Even the poker commentators get in on the weirdness (""And it's easy, with the patented Mike Werbe flash cards!"").And along the way, the characters do some pretty weird stuff too, such as Jack hitting on a pretty new employee only to find that she's one of his countless ex-wives. Since the characters spend a great deal of time sitting down, Penn has to compensate with lots of amusing dialogue (""... also, you have corn in your teeth"") and he's good at making things just slightly too surreal.Despite all the quirk, it would be easy for ""The Grand"" to lapse into tedium because it's basically about people playing a card game, albeit for high stakes. But Penn's hilariously mocking writing (""Where are you from, your country? Is everyone as miserable as you?"") and quickly shifting visions of the Strip and casinos keep things interesting. Lots of light, flash and sparkle.Harrelson does a nice solid job as a much-married Vegas heir, who seems to be perpetually stoned and laid-back even when being ejected from his own casino. But you can see a little desperation in the scene with Michael McKean, who is utterly hilarious as the evil, weird Steve Lavisch (he wears a hard hat when he looks at his construction models).And the other actors are also great -- Cheryl Hines is excellent as a wife who supports her family because of her hubby's fantasy football obsession, while Dennis Farina is deliciously nasty, Chris Parnell is unspeakably rude and weird (""Your bet on the river was as transparent as a cloaked Romulan bird of prey!""), and David Cross is bombastically horrific as Hines' ""identical twin"" brother.And Werner Herzog deserves a special shout-out for playing The German. Yes, that is the character's name. The great director does a wonderful, straight-faced job as a clearly insane poker-player who likes to kill small animals, and at one point informs Melvin, ""I will SQUISH you."" He's awesome.""The Grand"" happily lampoons the wonderful world of pro poker, and it entertains a great deal along the way.

Considering the actors involved (Harrelson, Cross, Hines) it's surprising that more wasn't said of the film upon its release. Harrelson is the core of the film -- a man addicted to everything who must win the tournament to buy back the casino his grandpa built. Harrelson plays his burnout addict with a mixture of hopelessness and enthusiasm that brings him above cliche. In fact, most of the actors manage to bring some perfect tic that sparkles in every scene. Chris Parnell's Dune-worshipping ""genius"" rises above the lame trekky nerd that films like this seem to rely on because of a lack of imagination.I guess the real accomplishment of the film is that Zak Penn & Matt Bierman construct interesting enough characters that allow the actors to provide depth through improvisation. Determining what was on the page and what was discovered during filming is almost impossible (without listening to the commentary track, of course).The film is fun, but loses steam in the last 30 minutes because the demands of the storyline require a focused look at the game of poker itself. People who aren't into poker may find themselves lost or bored at this point, whereas knowledge of the game wasn't required for the first two-thirds. I suspect Penn isn't concerned with that, but I was disappointed that even with my understanding of poker (don't mistake that for an interest), I considered skipping ahead just to find out what happens.I'm not sure how re-watchable this movie is. There are plenty of funny moments (Michael McKeon's scenes in particular), but the pace isn't strong enough to warrant repetitive viewings (something good comedies offer -- at least, comedies I'd want to own).One thing I noticed -- the sound on the DVD is very low. I had to double our volume just to get a reasonable listening level. Strange and sad, considering the bulk of the movie is dialog.",3,Funny? yes.

(One could argue that Las Vegas is in a continuous state of self-satire, and that the current incarnation of poker is a dumbed-down apology for the noble game, but never mind.) And ""The Grand"" includes many zingers at both subjects, both scripted and nicely improvised.  But after about half an hour, I caught myself looking at my watch, and I realized that I wasn't sure what the film was really all about. I think that good satire needs a central character with whom you either empathize (think Graham Chapman in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian""), or squirm (e.g. Ricky Gervais in ""The Office"").

I usually flip right past those poker tournaments that are always being shown on cable these days - although, after watching this movie, I think I'll be more inclined to put down the remote and stop to watch them from now on.  This movie is a very well-edited mix of written dialogue and (more) actor improvisation that surprisingly works most of the time.  There are a few parts, mostly involving Woody Harrelson's character, that are a little over-the-top.  However, even those are pretty funny in context.  Most of the actors (except one) are pretty serious poker players in real life, so they were able to get completely into their parts.  In fact, the climactic final round of the tournament was staged as a REAL game between the actors where the director and producer actually did NOT KNOW who was going to win.  Because of that, they pre-shot different versions of some of the post-tournament scenes because some actors had to leave early and they didn't know in advance which ending they'd need to use.  The unused scenes show up as extras on the dvd.  Because they were playing for real, the final showdown between Woody Harrelson and Cheryl Hines was a huge shock for both the actors and the audience.  It was great to see the genuine surprise on their faces, rather than to see them ""acting"" surprised.  So, I recommend the movie itself quite highly.  However, as a bonus, this dvd also has one of the most informative and entertaining commentary tracks I've heard with a movie.  Usually, directors drone on and on about camera angles and lighting.  These guys just let loose with anecdotes about every interesting thing that happened while they were making the movie, and it is as entertaining as the movie itself.

I try to catch at least some of the championship rounds every year; so much so that I recognize many of the pros now.  So, I thought a movie with that basis would be fun. Unfortunately, this wasn't.This movie was incredibly slow; in fact, we finally turned it off 45 minutes in. There was very little plot, or motivation.  While I'm sure most professional poker players only play for the love of the game and the money, I didn't even get that from the players in this film. Casino owner wants to win the jackpot to buy back his casino.  I'm supposed to care, why?  I think this movie would have been better if there was more actual poker playing and less ""character development."" The little cut scenes about the characters and their families that were supposed to resemble the personal bits in championships were just annoying and silly. I enjoy the World Series of Poker for the strategy, for the tension between the players, for the energy...this movie has NONE of that. And since you know it's fake, you can't even drum up any suspense for the jackpot.I'm guessing this was supposed to be funny, but all it had were bad stereotypes. You have the statistics genius who has horrible social problems and lives at home with his mother. There's the internet player that has no idea how to play poker, but is very lucky. The drug-addict casino owner, the punk mother with a mouth full of foul language, the old-timer who reminisces about how much Vegas has changed...it goes on.  They took every one of the ""pros"" from the real world, magnified them tenfold and through them into this movie.  On the surface, you'd think ""spoofing"" the real poker stars would work.  But this wasn't really a spoof and you know these are actors, and they aren't nearly as funny as a real life person who's an a@@ at the poker table!

""A New Yorker""","[0, 0]","Though not bad it had room for improvement but what makes ""The Grand"" successful in its on right is that it really does come across as a documentary. While it focuses a great deal on the wacky players, it also spends a great deal of time on the game itself. Penn is said to have given each actor some guidelines, letting them improvise the characters and to make things a tad more realistic, the final game was completely unscripted and played out exactly as the cards fell and though I never conceived that this had been the case (one would assume that the all important final showdown would be scripted), the final few hands certainly felt authentic. Not only was the interaction and game itself interesting but Penn and the actors involved managed to create characters that one cares for and regardless of who won, someone deserving was going home empty handed.Each character is brought to life by a talented cast including Woody Harrelson as Faro, the out of luck, drugged up casino owner trying to win the big jackpot in order to save his own casino, David Cross and Cheryl Hines as Larry and Laine, siblings working through sibling rivalry and family issues, Dennis Farina as Deuce, the old timer who's been gambling since the beginning of time and reminisces about the old Vegas, Chris Parnell as the ""Dune"" obsessed socially awkward math wiz who still lives with his mom, Richard Kind as the new comer who apparently doesn't know what he's doing and Werner Herzog as the violent The German who believes ""coffee is for pussies"" and prefers to get his frustration out by killing animals. Though these are the main players, the cast of this film is a who's who of Hollywood and the gambling world with appearances from Hank Azaria, Brett Ratner, Jason Alexander and recognizable real-life poker stars Daniel Negreanu, Phil Hellmuth Jr. and Doyle Brunson (though I'm sure there are a number of others I don't recognize).""The Grand"" is humorous not always laugh out loud but funny. The comedy is in the characters along with their actions. Penn succeeds at something else as well: allowing the actors to create personas that one can't help but feel attached to and then bringing it all together into a film that feels truly authentic in an off the wall sort of way. Aside from that, it's about poker so if you don't like the game, you may want to avoid this but if you can follow a poker game with some entertainment you might come out with a winning hand.",3,Poker Anyone...............,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,2459,"['not', 'bad', 'had', 'room', 'improvement', 'what', 'Grand', 'successful', 'right', 'really', 'come', 'documentary', 'great', 'deal', 'wacky', 'players', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'game', 'Penn', 'said', 'have', 'given', 'actor', 'guidelines', 'letting', 'improvise', 'characters', 'make', 'things', 'tad', 'more', 'realistic', 'final', 'game', 'was', 'completely', 'unscripted', 'played', 'out', 'exactly', 'cards', 'fell', 'never', 'conceived', 'had', 'been', 'case', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'important', 'final', 'showdown', 'would', 'be', 'scripted', 'final', 'few', 'hands', 'certainly', 'felt', 'authentic', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'interaction', 'game', 'interesting', 'Penn', 'actors', 'involved', 'managed', 'create', 'characters', 'one', 'regardless', 'who', 'won', 'someone', 'deserving', 'was', 'going', 'home', 'empty', 'handed.Each', 'character', 'brought', 'life', 'talented', 'cast', 'including', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Faro', 'out', 'luck', 'drugged', 'up', 'casino', 'owner', 'trying', 'win', 'big', 'jackpot', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'casino', 'David', 'Cross', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Larry', 'Laine', 'siblings', 'working', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'family', 'issues', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'Deuce', 'old', 'timer', 'who', 'been', 'gambling', 'beginning', 'time', 'reminisces', 'old', 'Vegas', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'Dune', 'obsessed', 'socially', 'awkward', 'math', 'wiz', 'who', 'still', 'mom', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'new', 'comer', 'who', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'violent', 'German', 'who', 'coffee', 'pussies', 'prefers', 'get', 'frustration', 'out', 'killing', 'animals', 'are', 'main', 'players', 'cast', 'film', 'who', 'who', 'Hollywood', 'gambling', 'world', 'appearances', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'recognizable', 'real-life', 'poker', 'stars', 'Daniel', 'Negreanu', 'Phil', 'Hellmuth', 'Jr.', 'Doyle', 'Brunson', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'number', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Grand', 'humorous', 'not', 'always', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'comedy', 'characters', 'actions', 'Penn', 'something', 'else', 'as', 'well', 'allowing', 'actors', 'create', 'personas', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'attached', 'then', 'bringing', 'together', 'film', 'truly', 'authentic', 'wall', 'sort', 'way', 'Aside', 'poker', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'game', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'can', 'follow', 'poker', 'game', 'entertainment', 'might', 'come', 'out', 'winning', 'hand']",The Grand

Hearing the back and forth between the players actually made me understand what the movie was attempting to say and how it was attempting to say it.  Also, a man was hit by lightning the day following watching the movie and had a burn mark in his baseball cap to prove it.Ray Ramano's character was apparently hit by lightning a few years back so he is a little off and he shows his baseball cap to prove where he was hit.  So, did the person above just follow the movie as a hoax or what?Well, the subtitle ""A Comedy About the Fine Art of Losing,"" really is where the movie is headed from the beginning.  Here we have six losers, two from the same family, who are destined to be on the last table at ""The Grand.""  Basically, the world series of poker.  We go through the lives of each of the characters, so the film is very slow in developing as we see the lives of each.  Once we get to the big poker game, things pick up a bit and the back and forth between the characters is a bit funny.  Some of the humor is a bit gross, so there are scenes definately not for kids.  The back and forth of the announcers of the event is really one of the best parts of the film.There are definately some great talent too.  Ramano does a good job.  Jason Alexander is a bit funny, but a little off and well too short of a time in the film.  He is facing off with Woody Harrelson, so you have two big players with a ton of potential.  Gabe Kaplan is superb.  It was great to see him again and his playing the dad of a set of twins, identical (really, a boy and a girl being identical????), where they keep fighting all the time.The movie is billed as one of the greatest collection of comedians in decades, I think Rat Race could be billed as that actually.What could have been done for improving it is starting off with the final table and where they are when they are there, then flashing back to the beginning of the tourny with each of the focused characters including the finalists, being focused on.  Maybe a split screen with them betting and playing while there is discussion of their life history, or whatever as they approach the tournament.  The movie is slow enough in places where you could have had moved to split and four way shots (ala Time Code). which would have made the movie more appealing and upbeat.In the end though, listening to and seeing the conversation and conduct of some at the Poker championship, really, they nailed the characters, people who have rough edges, competing for money in a poker game that is nationally recognized.  Fun for some, and a little rough on the edges.  For those who like poker, it should be a fun romp.

It's a lampoon of an easy target: poker and the selling of it and the WSOP on tv. The subject needs little tinkering to be funny/ stupid: the real shows are such hymns to greed and selfishness that one need add little.The highlights here are a few of the actors, specifically Chris Parnell as the internet poker geek, Herzog as The German (playing into type, perhaps), McKean as Steve Lavisch (clearly based on Steve Wynn), and a few of the others at moments. Woody is good enough as a Ted Binion-type, and David Cross is a humorous cross between Howard Lederer and Phil Hellmuth (now there's an unholy union), with Cheryl Hines as his Annie Duke-ish sister. Any poker fan will recognize the references, but will probably also wonder why this isn't quite as funny as it should have been.Director Penn has his concept right but never delivers in full; there are laughs but many are forced. My favorite line is Cross' ""Is that Rush?"", and one guesses it was an improv, like much of this. But where Guest has an ensemble that can ad lib with genius, only Cross and McKean can do it at that level here. And seeing as McKean is in all of Guest's movies, I'd recommend all of those before this.Nonetheless, if you've played cards much or watched the WSOP on the tube, you're bound to enjoy some of The Grand.

One wonders what the attraction is with her husband played by Ray Romano.  David Cross plays Lainie's gambling brother.  He's obnoxious, a loser, and completely self-centered.  Dennis Farina as L.B.J. Deuce Fairbanks plays a gambler who treats everybody badly.  Richard Kind plays Andy Andrews, a bumbling amateur who by sheer luck makes it to the finals.  Chris Parnell from ""Saturday Night Live"" plays the stone-faced Harold Melvin whose lack of emotion is something we're supposed to find funny.  Director Werner Herzog who won a Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1982 for ""Fitzcaraldo"" plays the German who likes to kill animals.  Michael McKean who was Lenny on ""Laverne & Shirley"" plays the ruthless rich guy trying to foreclose on The Rabbit's Foot.  The scenes are improvised and mostly don't work.  The climax comes more as relief that the film will finally be over than as an exciting conclusion.  This film didn't work on so many levels for me.  It wasn't funny.  While the actors did what they were supposed to do, none of the characters were interesting or someone for whom you could cheer.  Director Zak Penn has done a lot of work in the industry such as writing ""The Incredible Hulk,"" but this was not the project for which he'll be remembered.

And now, with talents likeChristopher GuestandLarry Davidmilking the style for all its worth, more people than ever before are taking their stab at it.  With less than predictable results.THE GRAND doesn't work because of its story, which is hardly worth mentioning.  I'll mention it anyway, since the rest of the review would make less sense if I didn't.  A collection of poker players with different motives and styles come together to compete for $10 million dollars.  (The ""grand"" of the title comes from the name of the tournament.)  There you go.  Now you're all caught up.Much like Guest's films, plot takes a backseat to the characters who populate it.  These kinds of ensemble comedies are more about giving the actors/actresses a chance to have fun.  The actual script for this film was only about twenty-nine page long; the real treat to the flick is watching a dozen or more comedians at the top of their game bantering the way you'd expect them to if they were, say, playing poker together.Of course, they stick to personas.  Ray Romano is the lightning-addled Fred Marsh, husband of Cheryl Hines' no-nonsense Lainie Schwartzman, sister to David Cross' overly competitive Larry.  Michael McKean, Woody Harrelson, Dennis Farina, Gabe Kaplan, Chris Parnell.  I could list all of the talent, but then I wouldn't have time to tell you how much I loved this film.Okay, so I didn't love it.  It runs a little long, and some of the cameos are bewildering (Hank Azaria) and just plain bad (Jason Alexander).  Being a film buff, there were a few that I enjoyed on a rather obscure level (Are you ready for this one?  German director Werner Herzog plays a cut-throat character called The German; four years ago, Herzog stared in a film calledIncident at Loch Ness, which was a mockumentary of a documentary, directed and co-written by Zak Penn, director of THE GRAND).Yeah, so that's not what most are likely to get from the movie.  I'll just say that there are things that don't work (try as you might, watching poker is hardly ever what anyone would call funny), but many more things that do.  If you like even half of the names I've already mentioned, you can place odds you'll enjoy, on some level, this little film, even if it doesn't bother hiding any aces up its sleeves.",4,"Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner!...Oh Wait, That's Blackjack",1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,2416,"['were', 'mockumentaries', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'think', 'wasSpinal', 'Tapthat', 'made', 'people', 'realize', 'just', 'what', 'genre', 'was', 'capable', 'now', 'talents', 'GuestandLarry', 'Davidmilking', 'style', 'worth', 'more', 'people', 'ever', 'are', 'taking', 'stab', 'less', 'predictable', 'results.THE', 'GRAND', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'story', 'hardly', 'worth', 'mentioning', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'anyway', 'rest', 'review', 'would', 'make', 'less', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'collection', 'poker', 'players', 'different', 'motives', 'styles', 'come', 'together', 'compete', '10', 'million', 'dollars', 'grand', 'title', 'name', 'tournament', 'go', 'Now', ""'re"", 'caught', 'up.Much', 'Guest', 'films', 'plot', 'backseat', 'characters', 'who', 'populate', 'kinds', 'ensemble', 'comedies', 'are', 'more', 'giving', 'actors/actresses', 'chance', 'have', 'fun', 'actual', 'script', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'twenty-nine', 'page', 'long', 'real', 'treat', 'flick', 'watching', 'dozen', 'more', 'comedians', 'top', 'game', 'bantering', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'were', 'say', 'playing', 'poker', 'together.Of', 'course', 'stick', 'personas', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'lightning-addled', 'Fred', 'Marsh', 'husband', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'no-nonsense', 'Lainie', 'Schwartzman', 'sister', 'David', 'Cross', 'overly', 'competitive', 'Larry', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'Gabe', 'Kaplan', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'could', 'list', 'talent', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'film.Okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'little', 'long', 'cameos', 'are', 'bewildering', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Being', 'film', 'buff', 'were', 'few', 'enjoyed', 'rather', 'obscure', 'level', 'Are', 'ready', 'one', 'German', 'director', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'cut-throat', 'character', 'called', 'German', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'Herzog', 'stared', 'film', 'calledIncident', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'was', 'mockumentary', 'documentary', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'director', 'THE', 'GRAND', '.Yeah', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'are', 'likely', 'get', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'are', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'try', 'might', 'watching', 'poker', 'hardly', 'ever', 'what', 'anyone', 'would', 'call', 'funny', 'many', 'more', 'things', 'do', 'like', 'even', 'half', 'names', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'can', 'place', 'odds', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'level', 'little', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'bother', 'hiding', 'aces', 'up', 'sleeves']",The Grand

Zak Penn's ""The Grand"" is a Christopher Guest-style improvisational mockumentary that sometimes slips outside of that style into regular movie mode and is not quite as marvelously entertaining as Guest's own work. Perhaps it can be blamed on the subject matter, but the humor here feels a bit darker, and not always in a good way, than the popular Guest mockumentaries, yet it's still got enough funny moments from a fantastic cast to make it worth watching. Probably even more enjoyable for the fan of real TV poker tournaments, this one is worth checking out if anything about it strikes your curiosity. It's nothing too outstanding, but it's worth at least one try. David Cross is hilarious as always, Ray Romano is classic Ray Romano, and Richard Kind is charming as ever. Chris Parnell's character also brings on some of the best moments. There are a ton of other stars in big and small roles, and a nice pile of DVD extras.

While Bruce Willis could make it as a big movie star, Tom Selleck could never really make the transition.  What happens when you take a whole bunch of small screen stars - almost none of whom have any major movie presence - into the same movie?  If it's The Grand, it winds up being pretty good.The Grand is one of those mockumentaries a la This is Spinal Tap or Best in Show (and in fact, Michael McKean from those movies does appear in this one as well).  The backdrop in this case is the world of Championship Poker, where six will meet at the final table for a winner-take-all prize of $10,000,000.  These six are: (1) Woody Harrelson, the more-or-less central character, who is a fast-living partier who needs the money to save the casino he inherited; (2) Cheryl Hines as a mother of five married to Ray Romano and is the brother of (3) David Cross, whose style of play is to be as obnoxious as possible; (4) Richard Kind as the amateur who somehow has made it further than he ever should have; (5) Dennis Farina as the old-school player who bemoans the old days in Vegas; and (6) Chris Parnell as the weird mathematical genius.  A number of other TV stars also appear, including Hank Azaria, Jason Alexander and Gabe Kaplan, as well as some real poker players.I went into this movie not expecting much and pleasantly surprised at how good it was.

1141587,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B0013ERFFU,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[4, 7]","I really looked forward to watching this movie.  It seemed an interesting premise: a man, (""Jack Faro"", played by WOODY HARRELSON),wants to save the large, Las Vegas Casio-Hotel which he inherited from his grandfather, (the casino's builder), from a greedy developer.  To do so, he must enter a Poker Tournament, and win the winner-take-all ten million dollar prize.  He must play against an assortment of other players -- a housewife, an old-time gambler, a computer genuis, an amateur who has practiced online, and other assorted gamblers.If this movie were written well, it would be an insight into human beings and human nature.  As a comedy, (which this movie purports to be), it would also be funny and enjoyable to watch.  But this movie is not funny, and tells little of real human nature.  It is not a comedy -- at least, I found nothing funny in it, except for two small jokes, at the beginning of the movie, when Jack Faro has a conversation with a barmaid.....What this movie is, is a film full of is a story that drags on and on, and on and on, and on, and.....on....and...on.... with bad writing -- and even worse language.  I'm not a fan of four-letter words, but havestill liked some movies, (""Love Story"", and ""The Blair Witch Project""), which included them.  These two movies had GOOD WRITING, and AN EXCITING STORY, which, sadly, ""THE GRAND"" does not.  Four-letter and slang words, in these two movies, were used at appropriate times.  In ""The Grand"", they are, most of the time, just put in for shock value.The writers of this movie MUST have written better movies. (No-one could continually write movies of this calibre and have them released, could they?)  This movie, unfortunately, belongs to a type of movie which I once saw categorized as: ""It wasn't released. It escaped!)  One thing I will say: they are equal-opportunity stereotypers!Germans, Jews, (of both the secular and religious variety), Arabs, cross-dressers, adult children who live with their parents, (and those parents),old-time gamblers, handicapped people....all are stereotyped here, presumably for a ""laugh"" value....but I found myself groaning instead.The acting isn't half-bad, the directing is quite good, and the music is tuneful and appropriate.  The costuming, lighting, and camera-work are OK as well.  It's also nice to see real-life Las Vegas locations, (the movie was filmed at the Golden Nugget Casino-Hotel in Las Vegas)  -- but NOTHING, nothing at all, can ever save any movie with as terrible a script and story as this one has ):  it's really too bad -- because handled differently, this could have made an interesting, involving, and funny movie.....The poker scenes are exciting.  I wish there were more of them!  Seeing GABE KAPLAN -- who once starred in ""Welcome Back, Kotter"", and is now a real-life professional poker player -- was a treat! It would have been nice, as well, amidst the poker tournament, to have these poker players interact with players of other table games -- roulette, blackjack, dice -- and one could have seen the different types of personalities which are drawn to each these different games....  But only poker players -- and more accurately, stereotypes, (and unfunny stereotypes, at that), of poker players, are seen here.The packaging for this DVD is far better than the movie itself!  On the cover are 8 poker chips, two of them enticingly and realisticly embossed. Portraits of 6 of the leading players, (all in very character-revealing poses), are pictured.  The one in the top left -- of Woody Harrolson -- is, really, pricelessly funny -- funnier than most of the entire movie, in fact!  Jack Faro's devil-may-care attitude towards life -- shown by his semi-cowboy shaped straw hat, his long hair, and his face which seems not to have been shaved that day -- is in stark contrast with his attitude: he is obviously concentrating on his cards with all the seriousness of a diplomat, scrutinzing a peace treaty to see that his side is fairly treated!  Mr. Harrolson is also pictured on the back of the packaging, in the middle of a poker-chip, as are other characters of the story.  Looking at them all, one wishes again and again that these good actors had had more of a story to display their talents!This DVD also includes extras: deleted scenes, alternate endings, profiles of the actors, audio commentary with the writers and directors, and selected scene commentaries.  If you want to see these extras, I suggest you watch them BEFORE you attempt to view the main movie.

Zak Penn has taken breaks from superhero movies twice now to enter the field.  His last effort, INCIDENT AT LOCH NESS, is an impossible act to follow, but he tries.  The cast, alone, is worth the price of the DVD, with the funniest moments coming from unlikely sources such as Dennis Farina and the fabulous Werner Herzog, who should star in at least one comedy every year.  His deadpan sincerity once again serves as Penn's secret weapon of comedy.  As for the rest of the film...?  It does not pack all of the ""Best in Show"" laughs in that I would hope (but what does?), yet seeing David Cross, Cheryl Hines, Hank Azaria, Richard Kind, Jason Alexander, Chris Parnell, and a de-sitcomized (and thus, funnier) Ray Romano, Judy Greer, and Michael McKean sharing the screen WITH GABE KAPLAN was worth it.  In a way, the film felt like a private, Friar's Club improv done during a round of drinks.  The one-two-three punchline structure became less important than the pleasure of seeing everyone ""in one room.""  Worth appreciating, too, is the father-son arc of David Cross and Gabe Kaplan, played with a subtle quality that never strays into the maudlin.  If you enjoyed THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, this will be especially appealing.  Zak Penn needs to keep at it.

If Woody's character isn't making you laugh, then you can wait for Chris Parnell's Harold Melvin to swim through, or Ray Romano and family to tickle your funny bone.  For me the moments that worked best came from Gabe Kaplan's character and his interactions with his family (David Cross, Ray Romano).  There are cameos galore from the poker universe (Phil Laak), and beyond (Jason Alexander, Hank Azaria etc..) It all plays out through the quasi documentary talking to the camera style of comedy, but overall really feels much more like a feature film that should have been a one season cable show perhaps.  Werner Herzog and Chris Parnell are the only characters who feel like ""real"" people, but the rest of the cast have some pretty funny moments.  Not quite what I was hoping for with this cast, but still pretty darn good, even Brett Ratner has a decent scene.The poker jokes work, (especially David Cross's hat and techniques) and by the end the story might actually have you caring a bit for these characters.  The alternate endings in the extras disappoint as do the deleted scenes, but the players profile section is worth checking out as it contains some entertaining deleted scenes for each character.

Heath ""Gadgets, Music, & Books""","[4, 6]","While I had not previously heard of The Grand, I was impressed by the cast - Jason Alexander, Ray Romano, Dennis Farina and, Woody Harrelson to name a few.  After watching the preview on the product page, I thought this was a shoe in for an evening of laughs.  Well, they say that the distance between theory and practice is shorter in theory than it is in practice...The problem with The Grand is not the cast.  Believe me they put in a truly valiant effort to save poorly conceived and written script.  Part of the problem is the format of the movie, or should I say formats?  The film is centered on the $10 million poker tournament known as The Grand.  The movie starts with the backstory for the six contestants that wind up at the final table for the tournament.  The transitions between character stories are abrupt and keep the movie from establishing a natural flow early on.  The remainder of the film splits between the tournament action and ""announcer commentary"" along with additional backstory and outside events.  Just when you get into the flow of the poker action the viewer is smacked upside the head with a hard left into backstory.  It creates a very choppy experience.  One would hope that the flow of the movie would be offset by some great one liners and laugh out loud moments.  Sadly the rare moments I would myself laughing were out of disbelief at how utterly stupid something was.  At these moments I would look over at my wife and see that she was merely shaking her head.  Finally, this is all packaged with a fairly low production quality.

The six featured  players include : Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson), a  drug addict who has been married as many times as he has failed rehab. His uncle left him his casino before he died but Jack lost it to a greedy developer (Guest regular Michael McKean) who plans on tearing it down and building a giant hotel with one room. Jack hopes to win enough money to save his uncle's legacy. Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina) is old school Vegas who fondly remembers the kneecapping days as he zips around the casino on his scooter complete with a bottle of scotch and vanity license plate.  Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell) is a nutcase who lives with his mom. An Internet player he's  constantly chugging a dark concoction  dubbed ""brain juice"" that his mother prepares for him daily.  Andy Andrews (Richard Kind) is a lovable doofus who  stumbled on a pro poker site while looking for antique fireplace pokers. Before he knew it he'd  won the qualifying round and landed himself a seat at the Grand. The German (Werner Herzog) is a scary dude who arrives at the hotel with a luggage cart full of live rabbits. In the next scene he's shown gently petting one of the rabbits before admitting that he calms his nerves by killing something every day. Rounding out the field of players are brother and sister team Larry and Lanie Schwartzman (David Cross and Cheryl Hines). Raised by a competitive father (Gabe Kaplan), Larry has had to watch as Lanie has had more success than him and he burns silently each time his father shows up to their matches holding a sign for her. She is married to a lightning survivor (Ray Romano) whom she doesn't take seriously. There are too many characters and while the film has some funny moments many of them could have been eliminated. This would have freed up more screen time for people like Kind and Herzog. Both Parnell and Hines were hilarious on  T.V.  but it doesn't translate as well on  the big screen. The Parnell character stops the movie dead in it's tracks and should have been cut entirely. Harrelson is decent in the lead but he has a few too many slurred speeches at the main table. The poker action isn't too exciting and not enough real life pros figure into the movie. With that being said there is a priceless scene between Kind and poker legends Doyle Brunson and Phil Hellmuth. David Cross is his usual crazy/brilliant self and him and Gabe Kaplan have some funny and touching scenes together. Herzog is a blast as a man reduced to wandering the halls searching for his rabbit that ran away.

1141595,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0013ERFFU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","The Grand (Zak Penn, 2007)It is damned tough to make a good movie about poker. Many have tried since the poker boom hit. None have succeeded; the only truly great poker movie, Rounders, was made five years before that. But that doesn't stop folks from trying, and let's be honest--while a poker player is going to be able to comment on the ridiculousness of the final hands in movies like The Cincinnati Kid, Maverick, or (the worst case of poker egregiousness in history, to date) Casino Royale, maybe the general public won't notice. Or, at least, that's what I'm figuring the writers of these movies say to themselves when trying to pitch themselves on writing scenes that require one's suspension of disbelief to stretch farther than the Overseas Highway. The Grand's isn't quite that bad, but the errors that plague the movie's poker are of the even-more-egregious variety, and Penn and co-writer Matt Bierman decided to try to pair the poker movie (already an ill-fated venture) with the improv comedy movie. That as much of it succeeds as it does is a minor miracle.Plot: One Eyed Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson) is the wastrel son of a casino owner who finds himself in desperate need of cash to save the family legacy, which a robber baron (Michael McKean) wants to buy and turn into a million-dollar-per-night hotel/entertainment extravaganza. Thus, he does what any enterprising young man in need of cash would do--enter a major poker tournament that will win him enough money to pay off the casino's debts, as long as he can outlast such poker-playing lights as Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina), Lainie Schwartzman (The Ugly Truth's Cheryl Hines), Fred Marsh (Ray Romano), Yakov Achmed (Jason Alexander), Reggie Marshall (Mike Epps), and the mysterious player known only as The German (Werner Herzog in a rare trip in front of the camera), along with a few other guys you may have heard of like Doyle Brunson, Daniel Negreanu, Phil Laak, Phil Hellmuth...When the movie stays on point, it's quick, it's funny, and as long as the writers aren't attempting poker analysis, it's reasonably intelligent. The poker profiles, a la the WSOP filler material on ESPN, range from the amusing (Ray Romano's skit) to the downright hilarious (every time the Schwartzmans are onscreen). Michael McKean, as usual, is gold every time he gets in front of a camera.And then there are the downsides, which start with every time the movie attempts to show poker being played. I'm amazed Phil Gordon, who plays the poker commentator announcing the tournament for TV, didn't smack people upside the head with the script for all the stupidity they send spewing out of his mouth. The improv comedy bits... well, some of them work (see previous bit about the Schwartzmans), but most fall flat; the only other character who really works 100% of the time is The German, and that's because Herzog plays him straight, with an air of menace that does not fit at all with this movie, and yet it works. Which should be an indicator right there that something is failing, but somehow it didn't raise any alarm bells.Short answer: if you're in the mood for a poker movie and you've watched everything else on the subject you own, give this a go. The parts that work make it worth your time, and hey, it's a helluva lot better than Lucky You. ** ",3,"Mildly amusing, though not all the improv works.",1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3317,"['Grand', 'Zak', 'Penn', '2007', 'damned', 'tough', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'poker', 'Many', 'have', 'tried', 'poker', 'boom', 'hit', 'None', 'have', 'succeeded', 'only', 'truly', 'great', 'poker', 'movie', 'Rounders', 'was', 'made', 'five', 'years', ""n't"", 'stop', 'folks', 'trying', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'poker', 'player', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'comment', 'ridiculousness', 'final', 'hands', 'movies', 'Cincinnati', 'Kid', 'Maverick', 'worst', 'case', 'poker', 'egregiousness', 'history', 'date', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'maybe', 'general', 'public', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'least', 'what', ""'m"", 'figuring', 'writers', 'movies', 'say', 'when', 'trying', 'pitch', 'writing', 'scenes', 'require', 'one', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'stretch', 'farther', 'Overseas', 'Highway', 'Grand', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bad', 'errors', 'plague', 'movie', 'poker', 'are', 'even-more-egregious', 'variety', 'Penn', 'co-writer', 'Matt', 'Bierman', 'decided', 'try', 'pair', 'poker', 'movie', 'already', 'ill-fated', 'venture', 'improv', 'comedy', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'minor', 'miracle.Plot', 'One', 'Eyed', 'Jack', 'Faro', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'wastrel', 'son', 'casino', 'owner', 'who', 'desperate', 'need', 'cash', 'save', 'family', 'legacy', 'robber', 'baron', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'buy', 'turn', 'million-dollar-per-night', 'hotel/entertainment', 'extravaganza', 'Thus', 'what', 'enterprising', 'young', 'man', 'need', 'cash', 'would', 'do', 'enter', 'major', 'poker', 'tournament', 'will', 'win', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'casino', 'debts', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'outlast', 'such', 'poker-playing', 'lights', 'Deuce', 'Fairbanks', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'Lainie', 'Schwartzman', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Fred', 'Marsh', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Yakov', 'Achmed', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Reggie', 'Marshall', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'mysterious', 'player', 'known', 'only', 'German', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'rare', 'trip', 'front', 'camera', 'few', 'other', 'guys', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'like', 'Doyle', 'Brunson', 'Daniel', 'Negreanu', 'Phil', 'Laak', 'Phil', 'Hellmuth', 'When', 'movie', 'point', 'quick', 'funny', 'as', 'long', 'writers', 'are', ""n't"", 'attempting', 'poker', 'analysis', 'reasonably', 'intelligent', 'poker', 'profiles', 'la', 'WSOP', 'filler', 'material', 'ESPN', 'range', 'amusing', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'skit', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'time', 'Schwartzmans', 'are', 'onscreen', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'usual', 'gold', 'time', 'front', 'camera.And', 'then', 'are', 'downsides', 'start', 'time', 'movie', 'show', 'poker', 'being', 'played', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'Phil', 'Gordon', 'who', 'poker', 'commentator', 'announcing', 'tournament', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'smack', 'people', 'head', 'script', 'stupidity', 'send', 'spewing', 'mouth', 'improv', 'comedy', 'bits', 'well', 'work', 'see', 'previous', 'bit', 'Schwartzmans', 'most', 'fall', 'flat', 'only', 'other', 'character', 'who', 'really', '100', '%', 'time', 'German', 'Herzog', 'straight', 'air', 'menace', 'not', 'fit', 'movie', 'yet', 'Which', 'should', 'be', 'indicator', 'right', 'there', 'something', 'failing', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'raise', 'alarm', 'bells.Short', 'answer', ""'re"", 'mood', 'poker', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'everything', 'else', 'subject', 'own', 'give', 'go', 'parts', 'work', 'make', 'time', 'hey', 'helluva', 'lot', 'better', 'Lucky', '**']",The Grand

1141598,A1JEFESGLIS076,B0013ERFFU,rsoonsa,"[3, 4]","""The Grand Championship of Poker"", held at the Golden Nugget Hotel in Las Vegas, furnishes the backdrop for this cleverly constructed mockumentary that will please aficionados of the card game, although viewers not conversant with the rules of poker will understandably be more interested in the personalities involved, thanks to the able leadership of director Zak Penn, who provides his cast with only a briefly outlined scenario from which to work.  This, then, is primarily an improvisational work, with the actors representing actual well-known poker tournament contestants, all the while not themselves knowing the film's outcome, since they are engaged in ongoing competition with highly proficient professionals, contending for a winner-take-all prize of $10 million.  Resourceful editing is the determinant to success for an episodic affair of this sort, and that duty is capably handled by Abby Schwarzwalder, being of particular value during the production's earlier segments, when a wide range of defined character types is created by director Penn.  The film loses much of its impact during its lattermost sequences as a result of poker jargon being extensively utilized, and probably not comprehensible to a good many viewers. The Anchor Bay DVD release enjoys outstanding audio and visual quality and offers a liberal number of interesting extra features.  These include: a brace of alternate endings; some truly comedic deleted scenes that have optional commentary by Penn, writer/executive producer Matt Bierman, and actor Michael Karnow; ""Wild Cards"" - a goodly amount of footage that profiles major players along with some cameo roles; a full-length audio commentary with Penn, Bierman and Karnow, marked by the director's efforts to keep the other two focussed upon the film; and a substantial group of selected scene commentaries with Penn and Woody Harrelson, in addition to one with the director and players Cheryl Hines and Ray Romano.  From among a large collection of talented performers we may enjoy some excellent turns, acting honours going to Chris Parnell as a social misfit who is also a genius at poker.  These extras, taken together, will comprise the principal reason for a majority of those who are not fans of poker playing to acquire this work, their entertainment value offsetting any constraints caused by a self-destructing effect fashioned from the game's usage of poker nomenclature, a failing that will leave many viewers adrift.",4,"Although Likely Of Only Modest Interest To Many Viewers, Versatile Skills Of Many Contribute To Its Development.",1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,2473,"['Grand', 'Championship', 'Poker', 'held', 'Golden', 'Nugget', 'Hotel', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'backdrop', 'cleverly', 'constructed', 'mockumentary', 'will', 'please', 'aficionados', 'card', 'game', 'viewers', 'not', 'conversant', 'rules', 'poker', 'will', 'understandably', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'personalities', 'involved', 'thanks', 'able', 'leadership', 'director', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'who', 'cast', 'only', 'briefly', 'outlined', 'scenario', 'work', 'then', 'primarily', 'improvisational', 'work', 'actors', 'representing', 'actual', 'well-known', 'poker', 'tournament', 'contestants', 'not', 'knowing', 'film', 'outcome', 'are', 'engaged', 'ongoing', 'competition', 'highly', 'proficient', 'professionals', 'contending', 'winner-take-all', 'prize', '10', 'million', 'Resourceful', 'editing', 'determinant', 'success', 'episodic', 'affair', 'sort', 'duty', 'capably', 'handled', 'Abby', 'Schwarzwalder', 'being', 'particular', 'value', 'production', 'earlier', 'segments', 'when', 'wide', 'range', 'defined', 'character', 'types', 'created', 'director', 'Penn', 'film', 'much', 'impact', 'lattermost', 'sequences', 'result', 'poker', 'jargon', 'being', 'extensively', 'utilized', 'probably', 'not', 'comprehensible', 'good', 'many', 'viewers', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'release', 'outstanding', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'liberal', 'number', 'interesting', 'extra', 'features', 'include', 'brace', 'alternate', 'endings', 'truly', 'comedic', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Penn', 'writer/executive', 'producer', 'Matt', 'Bierman', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Karnow', 'Wild', 'Cards', 'goodly', 'amount', 'footage', 'major', 'players', 'cameo', 'roles', 'full-length', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Penn', 'Bierman', 'Karnow', 'marked', 'director', 'efforts', 'keep', 'other', 'two', 'focussed', 'film', 'substantial', 'group', 'selected', 'scene', 'commentaries', 'Penn', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'addition', 'one', 'director', 'players', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'From', 'large', 'collection', 'talented', 'performers', 'may', 'enjoy', 'excellent', 'turns', 'acting', 'honours', 'going', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'social', 'misfit', 'who', 'also', 'genius', 'poker', 'extras', 'taken', 'together', 'will', 'comprise', 'principal', 'reason', 'majority', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fans', 'poker', 'playing', 'acquire', 'work', 'entertainment', 'value', 'offsetting', 'constraints', 'caused', 'self-destructing', 'effect', 'fashioned', 'game', 'usage', 'poker', 'nomenclature', 'failing', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'viewers', 'adrift']",The Grand

Moreover, many, if not all of them, are very well-known, and highly competitive,  poker players, which should be a plus in a comedy about a poker tournament.

Unfortunately, The Grand, while occasionally quite funny, is kind of a mess.In The Grand, a movie about a high-stakes poker tournament, it seems like the director just gave the actors bare outlines of their characters and said ""do something funny."" The whole thing is a pretty clear attempt to make a movie likeBest in Show(Penn goes so far as to use Michael McKean in a small role), but the results just aren't as good.The problem I often have with ensemble casts is that usually some of the performers are much better than others, but they all get about the same amount of screen time. In The Grand, Richard Kind, Chris Parnell, and Ray Romano seem to base their entire performances on one or two quirks, and really, they aren't very interesting. Werner Herzog, who I would probably watch reading the phone book, is criminally underutilized, and is essentially one joke that keeps repeating itself.  Woody Harrelson, David Cross, and Denis Farina all have some hilarious scenes, but they're few and far between.The movie also features Celebrity Poker Tournament commentator Phil Gordon as...the tournament's commentator. Gordon's color commentator, played by Michael Karnow, is a combination of Fred Willard's character in Best in Show and Jason Bateman's character inDodgeball - A True Underdog Story (Unrated Edition), except that he isn't funny.The biggest problem is that the movie is terribly lopsided.  The first half or so is pretty good, giving background on the players and showing them working their way toward the final, big-money game.  Unfortunately, once they get there, the movie slows to a crawl and the comedy mostly disappears.Overall, The Grand is a really problematic movie with a few hilarious lines.

It starts off very slow and the drags a lot by showing and introduction of these 6 main players. These 6 people are for the final poker table for The Grand. They all have their own story to tell and they take awhile telling it. Also, they follow each character around after their poker matches, and this slows down the movie even more. In fact, it's take up more 80% to 90% of the movie. Everything else after that is just them at the final table and finishing up the movie. BTW, this is the only real poker scene in the whole movie. Everything is just a back story of more back stories.So, what we got here is one back story after another and it's so boring. This really slow down the peace of the movie and bores the audience to death. If they wanted to do characters development, they needed to do that some other way, where the movie itself isn't killing itself slowly by not just going to the next back story.People say this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but it's just below average slap-stick film. The jokes involve the ""Real"" Poker Players' stories and they take that and then mix it with the main characters' stories. All of them main characters represent real life poker players' and so of the stories can be funny and some are not funny.An example of what I'm talking about is the Unabomber Phil Laak. He is known for taking his hood and wrapping it around his head with his sun-glasses on. This makes him look like the Unabomber. Well, in this movie, you see that, and then you see another main cast member. He'll take a knight's helmet and puts that on, then, he'll shuts the lid looking at Phil Laak. If you think that's funny, that's about the funniest thing in the movie and you don't need to watch it now. All the jokes after that is sup-par and won't make you laugh after that. I can't even remember the rest of the jokes because they just didn't make me laugh or were memorable.If you do manage to get the DVD, you might be interested in the movie because it does have two more alternative endings. They do not make the movie any better, but it does let people know what the writers thought what else could work as the ending. In the end, yes, the movie chose the correct ending for the movie because the others would open up more questions and they would need to do more stuff to finish the movie.The DVD also has extra scenes to the movie, but they do not make the movie any better. In fact, they should be extra scenes because if they actually left those scenes in their, it will even make a worse movie, even more boring.The DVD also has one more section for extra scenes for each main character. They are not worth the time to even watching. They add nothing!!!I only recommend this movie if you want to see a lot of famous poker faces in the movie. They don't do much in the movie as they are just making cameos. You won't even see them play poker, they just are there and you see them. Also, don't watch this if you want to see good poker plays, moves, or strategy.

1141602,A34AB6PSS7QMHR,B0013ERFFU,S. D. Johnson,"[6, 8]","This film had its moments of humor, but they were few and far between, and likely as not to be found in one of the deleted scenes or character profiles. In fact, some of the funniest bits are with the real-world poker stars who make cameo appearances in the film.The story centers on a $10 million poker tournament called The Grand (hence the name of the movie). The film was made on location in the old section of Las Vegas, in and around the Golden Nugget. Woody Harrelson is the main character in the movie and the only one in the tournament who is trying to win for semi-altruistic reasons. A heavy drug and alcohol abuser, who has lived in a rehab center for several years, he wants to buy back the casino he inherited from his dead uncle and then lost through various combinations of substance abuse and stupid decisions.Of all the main characters, Woody Harrelson is perhaps the most likable, with Dennis Farina taking a close second place. Richard Kind's character is funny at first, but he quickly gets annoying and you find yourself glad when he makes his exit. The rest of the crew is a combination of mean and/or pathetic in different amounts.The film is somewhat educational in that, if you know nothing about poker, you'll learn a few terms and some of the techniques employed by professional players. It is also good in that it doesn't really glamorize gambling, as the players are generally pathetic losers, each with their own crippling idiosyncrasies and lack of social skills. Harrelson's substance abuse is likewise portrayed in a pathetic light - he only manages to pass out in his hotel room after his ""bender"".There are some small attempts at promoting familial reconciliation, but the people involved are so pathetic and mean spirited that it is more of a disappointment than heartwarming.If someone is really into poker and/or thinks that cut-downs and insults are the height of humor, they would probably really enjoy this movie. If someone is a huge Woody Harrelson fan, or a fan of one of the other stars in the movie, they would likewise probably enjoy this movie. At Amazon's current price of $10, you can probably take a chance and see if it is for you, but you're likely to find this one for $5 or less in a bargain bin somewhere within a couple of months.",2,"Occasionally funny, mostly pathetic",1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,2288,"['film', 'had', 'moments', 'humor', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'character', 'profiles', 'fact', 'funniest', 'bits', 'are', 'real-world', 'poker', 'stars', 'who', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'film.The', 'story', 'centers', '10', 'million', 'poker', 'tournament', 'called', 'Grand', 'hence', 'name', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'location', 'old', 'section', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Golden', 'Nugget', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'tournament', 'who', 'trying', 'win', 'semi-altruistic', 'reasons', 'heavy', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuser', 'who', 'lived', 'rehab', 'center', 'several', 'years', 'buy', 'back', 'casino', 'inherited', 'dead', 'uncle', 'then', 'lost', 'various', 'combinations', 'substance', 'abuse', 'stupid', 'decisions.Of', 'main', 'characters', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'perhaps', 'most', 'likable', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'taking', 'close', 'second', 'place', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'character', 'funny', 'first', 'quickly', 'annoying', 'find', 'glad', 'when', 'exit', 'rest', 'crew', 'combination', 'mean', 'and/or', 'pathetic', 'different', 'amounts.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'educational', 'know', 'nothing', 'poker', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'few', 'terms', 'techniques', 'employed', 'professional', 'players', 'also', 'good', ""n't"", 'really', 'glamorize', 'gambling', 'players', 'are', 'generally', 'pathetic', 'losers', 'own', 'crippling', 'idiosyncrasies', 'lack', 'social', 'skills', 'Harrelson', 'substance', 'abuse', 'likewise', 'portrayed', 'pathetic', 'light', 'only', 'pass', 'out', 'hotel', 'room', 'bender', 'are', 'small', 'attempts', 'promoting', 'familial', 'reconciliation', 'people', 'involved', 'are', 'so', 'pathetic', 'mean', 'spirited', 'more', 'disappointment', 'heartwarming.If', 'someone', 'really', 'poker', 'and/or', 'cut-downs', 'insults', 'are', 'height', 'humor', 'would', 'probably', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'someone', 'huge', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'fan', 'fan', 'one', 'other', 'stars', 'movie', 'would', 'likewise', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'current', 'price', '10', 'can', 'probably', 'take', 'chance', 'see', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'one', '5', 'less', 'bargain', 'bin', 'somewhere', 'couple', 'months']",The Grand
1141603,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B0013ERFFU,Servo,"[2, 5]","In this hilarious ensemble comedy from writer/director Zak Penn, actors Woody Harrelson, David Cross, Dennis Farina, Cheryl Hines, Richard Kind and Chris Parnell are an eclectic group of poker players, each hoping to win $10 million cash at The Grand Championship Of Poker. Through humorous backstories, viewers not only get to know the players but also what is at stake for each of them. This, I feel, vests the viewer more in the characters' poker playing scenes during The Grand Championship, as opposed to 104 minutes of non-stop poker playing from characters the viewer knows hardly anything about. Rated R for language and some drug content, the humor and style of The Grand, for me, is more in the vein ofElection(1999) and NBC'sThe Office. The Grand, at a running time of 104 min. features a fine score by Stephen Endleman, excellent cinematography, Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) video, Dolby Surround 5.1 & 2.0 audio, plus the following Special Features: Alternate Ending, Deleted Scenes, Wild Cards: Player Profiles, Audio Commentary with Zak Penn (Writer/Producer/Director), Matt Bierman (Writer/Executive Producer) and Michael Karnow (Actor).

1141604,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B0013ERFFU,TheBandit,"[1, 1]","There are times when everyone takes a gamble on a straight-to-DVD movie that they've never heard of. Usually that stab in the dark doesn't pay off, for any number of reasons (i.e. bad acting, weak writing, etc). ""The Grand"" is a rare - and welcome - opposite of that scenario.  Though the movie goes on a little too long and has several rather dry spells, I was laughing throughout most of the movie.There really isn't much plot to speak of. A bunch of eccentric people travel to the Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas to compete in a poker tournament - with a grand prize of ten million dollars. The large ensemble cast was allowed to improvise most of their dialogue. As is the case with most improvisation-based movies, the results are decidedly hit-or-miss. The strength of the cast - most of whom you will either know or at least recognize - makes it all work. Woody Harrelson is the main character, and as such also carries the movie's main narrative thread.  He plays Jack Faro who, after getting out of drug rehab, finds he can't keep the casino he inherited in business. The casino is so far in debt, Faro has no choice other than watch it get torn down - unless he wins the big jackpot at the poker tournament.The real fun in the movie isn't in plot development, it is the inventiveness of it's varied cast.  Former SNL cast member Chris Parnell is spectacularly funny as an emotionally stunted savant-like poker genious. He lives with his mom (Seinfeld's Estelle Harris), who mixes absurd quantities of ""brain juice"" - vitamin supplement shakes - for her son.  Parnell - often very effective during his SNL years, but still not well known outside of that - is hilarious while being very subtle. Subtlety isn't always frequently displayed in anything-goes improv-based movies, but Parnell manages to steal the entire movie by underplaying.Speaking of Seinfeld's Estelle Harris, another alum of that show turns up - Jason Alexander.  He is probably the least successful in this movie, precisely because he takes the opposite route from Chris Parnell.  Alexander chews the scenery as a foreigner who's homeland is never quite established.  Luckily the former George Costanza isn't in the movie much, in what amounts to little more than a glorified cameo.Other highlights in the cast are Curb Your Enthusiasm's Cheryl Hines, who has some funny scenes with Ray Romano (who plays her husband). David Cross in on board, playing the sibling of Hines' character.  Gabe Kaplan is outstanding as their father, who perpetually favored his daughter or his son.  They all have a dinner scene together that is squirm-inducing in it's awkward hilarity.I could go on about the cast, which also includes fine appearances by Michael McKean, Dennis Farina, Werner Herzog, Judy Greer, and others - including real-life poker champs and commentators.  But suffice it to say, this is a comedy that delivers laughs.  The movie is kinda-sorta done in the style of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries.  The characters do plenty of talking to the camera, but that probably only amounts to about half the movie.  The rest is staged as a normal narrative movie.Lots of bells and whistles appear on the DVD, including commentaries from the filmmakers and various cast members.  There are a couple alternate endings that are interesting.  A number of deleted scenes are on hand, as well as character profiles that flesh out each of the main characters with extra footage.",4,Very funny ensemble comedy - Chris Parnell steals the show,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3448,"['are', 'times', 'when', 'everyone', 'gamble', 'straight-to-DVD', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Usually', 'stab', 'dark', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'number', 'reasons', 'i.e', 'bad', 'acting', 'weak', 'writing', 'etc', 'Grand', 'rare', 'welcome', 'opposite', 'scenario', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'several', 'rather', 'dry', 'spells', 'was', 'laughing', 'most', 'movie.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'speak', 'bunch', 'eccentric', 'people', 'travel', 'Golden', 'Nugget', 'casino', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'compete', 'poker', 'tournament', 'grand', 'prize', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'large', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'allowed', 'improvise', 'most', 'dialogue', 'case', 'most', 'improvisation-based', 'movies', 'results', 'are', 'decidedly', 'hit-or-miss', 'strength', 'cast', 'most', 'whom', 'will', 'either', 'know', 'least', 'recognize', 'work', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'main', 'character', 'such', 'also', 'movie', 'main', 'narrative', 'thread', 'Jack', 'Faro', 'who', 'getting', 'drug', 'rehab', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'casino', 'inherited', 'business', 'casino', 'so', 'far', 'debt', 'Faro', 'choice', 'other', 'watch', 'get', 'torn', 'down', 'big', 'jackpot', 'poker', 'tournament.The', 'real', 'fun', 'movie', ""n't"", 'plot', 'development', 'inventiveness', 'varied', 'cast', 'Former', 'SNL', 'cast', 'member', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'spectacularly', 'funny', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'savant-like', 'poker', 'genious', 'mom', 'Seinfeld', 'Estelle', 'Harris', 'who', 'mixes', 'absurd', 'quantities', 'brain', 'juice', 'vitamin', 'supplement', 'son', 'Parnell', 'often', 'very', 'effective', 'SNL', 'years', 'still', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'outside', 'hilarious', 'being', 'very', 'subtle', 'Subtlety', ""n't"", 'always', 'frequently', 'displayed', 'anything-goes', 'improv-based', 'movies', 'Parnell', 'steal', 'entire', 'movie', 'underplaying.Speaking', 'Seinfeld', 'Estelle', 'Harris', 'alum', 'show', 'up', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'probably', 'least', 'successful', 'movie', 'precisely', 'opposite', 'route', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'Alexander', 'scenery', 'foreigner', 'who', 'homeland', 'never', 'quite', 'established', 'Luckily', 'former', 'George', 'Costanza', ""n't"", 'movie', 'much', 'what', 'amounts', 'little', 'more', 'glorified', 'cameo.Other', 'highlights', 'cast', 'are', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'who', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'who', 'husband', 'David', 'Cross', 'board', 'playing', 'sibling', 'Hines', 'character', 'Gabe', 'Kaplan', 'outstanding', 'father', 'who', 'perpetually', 'favored', 'daughter', 'son', 'have', 'dinner', 'scene', 'together', 'squirm-inducing', 'awkward', 'hilarity.I', 'could', 'go', 'cast', 'also', 'fine', 'appearances', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'others', 'including', 'real-life', 'poker', 'champs', 'commentators', 'say', 'comedy', 'delivers', 'laughs', 'movie', 'kinda-sorta', 'done', 'style', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', 'characters', 'do', 'plenty', 'talking', 'camera', 'probably', 'only', 'movie', 'rest', 'staged', 'normal', 'narrative', 'movie.Lots', 'bells', 'whistles', 'appear', 'DVD', 'including', 'commentaries', 'filmmakers', 'various', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'couple', 'alternate', 'endings', 'are', 'interesting', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'hand', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'profiles', 'flesh', 'out', 'main', 'characters', 'extra', 'footage']",The Grand

He has the part down as a discombobulated stoner whose multiple ex-wives keep dropping in. He's about the funniest thing here.

Real life Poker-Pros Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, and Phil Laak also make appearances, as well as filmmakers Brett Ratner and Werner Herzog (who puts in a goofy performance as a bunny loving ""The German"").

I always assume that Keanu Reeves must be the nicest guy in Hollywood because he's not getting all those roles from his innate talent (although sometimes the wooden works, especially when you're second banana after a speeding bus) and Zak Penn seems to have the same friendliness going for him. There are a LOT of actors in this thing who must have taken a pay cut because they are innately good. Gabe Kaplan shows up as a soccer dad (except instead of soccer he forces his kids to play poker) with David Cross and Cheryl Hines as his slightly wounded but really good poker playing progeny. I've seen Richard Kind stealing two shows this year, this being one of them (although he played Voltaire/Pangloss in the opera Candide so can you really say that he stole it?) making me wish that someone would finally get around to putting out complete seasons of Spin City.This isn't a great awe inspiring movie, but it's a pleasant couple of hours and sometimes that's really all you want to see (considering that I'm now trying to get throughFlags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition)I may very well just have to watch it again afterwards.",4,A Likeable Little Comedy,1214784000,"06 30, 2008",2008,1930,"['very', 'much', 'wanted', 'hate', 'movie', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'director', 'was', 'pulling', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'routine', 'introducing', 'bunch', 'weird', 'characters', 'most', 'whom', 'seemed', 'weird', 'sake', 'being', 'weird', ""'m"", 'sick', 'poker', 'most', 'ESPN', 'viewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'offer.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'was', 'well', 'movie', 'stopped', 'criticizing', 'just', 'let', 'work', 'Ok', 'also', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'German', 'psychotic', 'poker', 'player', 'who', 'must', 'kill', 'animal', 'day', 'bunny', 'was', 'also', 'showing', 'up', 'movie', 'very', 'likeable', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'funny', 'own', 'ways', 'yes', 'everything', 'improv', 'formula', 'fail', 'more', 'often', 'real', 'heart', 'movie.And', 'lot', 'talent', 'too', 'always', 'assume', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'must', 'be', 'nicest', 'guy', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'getting', 'roles', 'innate', 'talent', 'sometimes', 'wooden', 'works', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'second', 'banana', 'speeding', 'bus', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'have', 'same', 'friendliness', 'going', 'are', 'LOT', 'actors', 'thing', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'pay', 'cut', 'are', 'innately', 'good', 'Gabe', 'Kaplan', 'up', 'soccer', 'dad', 'instead', 'soccer', 'kids', 'play', 'poker', 'David', 'Cross', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'slightly', 'wounded', 'really', 'good', 'poker', 'playing', 'progeny', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'stealing', 'two', 'shows', 'year', 'being', 'one', 'played', 'Voltaire/Pangloss', 'opera', 'Candide', 'so', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'stole', 'making', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'finally', 'get', 'putting', 'out', 'complete', 'seasons', 'Spin', 'City.This', ""n't"", 'great', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'couple', 'hours', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'considering', ""'m"", 'now', 'trying', 'get', 'throughFlags', 'Fathers', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'afterwards']",The Grand
1141608,ANOBZWKE25SBY,B0013ERFFU,Tracy Vest,"[1, 2]","In the vein of ""It's a Mad, Mad World,"" Zak Penn's ""The Grand"" is an all-star, cameo-riddled mockumentary about the world of high stakes poker. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, quirky characters, and on-going sight gags. The cast is rich with plenty of familiar TV characters (my fave is George Costanza's mom as the coddling mother of a poker savant). Woody Harrelson gets top billing as a drug addled gambler who never met a woman he didn't marry, trying to retain his grandfather's legacy casino by winning the poker $10 million jackpot. The other stand out for me was the brilliant David Cross, who was so fantastic in the underrated ""Arrested Development.""I laughed a lot, but as others have said - it's not really one of those repeat viewing films like say ""Airplane"" or the original ""Vacation"" and it does run a bit long - could have been trimmed to make it tighter and funnier.
