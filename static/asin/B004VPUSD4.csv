DruryC: Ashley C. Williams, Jon CarloP: A couple struggles to survive when the United States is thrown in turmoil when the gasoline supply runs out.The idea of centering the demise of US around the notion that things would fall apart if their was no more gas is an intriguing concept. The thing with Empty though is that they take that concept and make it a sub-plot instead.Empty puts its main focus on a couple caught in the middle of it all and their romantic troubles during this event. In the process, Empty shifts the focus away from what makes it unique and distinctive in favor of something more conventional and expected.The romantic relationship at the center of Empty isn't all that interesting while the sub-plot certainly is. That is what is so frustrating about Empty. When it is focusing on what would happen during this event, the momentum increases and there is a genuine suspense as to how the story will unfold. However, viewers are stuck watching this couple bicker back & forth for most of the film's running time, something that has been done a million times. There's this compelling sub-plot that is barely explored. Empty is guilty of taking what makes it special, the film's sub-plot, and squandering that opportunity in order to tell a formulaic story.

She wants what he can't give, and she is so attached to Daddy, that he could never hope to forge a marriage in her company.  The ending is incomplete and leaves one without a solution except the one the viewer receives during a semi-climax flashback.

1430096,A3QEDCYNR6H11M,B004VPUSD4,Gary,"[0, 2]","50 minutes into the movie, and so far I'm good with it. Could be that's because I  too have run low on gas WAY back in the hills. It's surprising how a nice day and pristine setting can suddenly turn ominous.As for this film, the premise of a world-wide gas shortage leading to economic and social crises is certainly not farfetched, considering what's happening in the Middle East.I think the two lead actors, Jon Carlo and Ashley C Williams, are portraying their characters very well, as did Barry McBrien as the motel manager. McBrien added tension to two scenes that could easily have been nothing but colorless conversations.As a script writer (hey, just because nobody's bought my script doesn't mean I'm not a writer), overall I think Empty's screenplay is above average for films generally, and especially those made with a small budget. Tension is building, characters are  three dimensional, and there's even subtle irony at work (i.e,, be careful what you wish for). Several early scenes were disjointed or too long, but editing could have smoothed that out. A couple lapses of logic, nothing major. The foul language is getting irritating, like Carlo's character (not the actor himself). 'Hansard' reminds me of that whiny Marine in Aliens 2 - the one who eventually made me start rooting for the aliens.Back to the movie...At 68 minutes: I like the way this story is portraying 2 people dealing with an out of the blue crisis in believable ways, as opposed to somehow becoming superheroes to extricate themselves. My opinion of Hansard is improving too, but I have a feeling that won't last much longer.Back to the movie...The ending was a big surprise. I'll give it that.",4,On the fly review of 'Empty',1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,1685,"['50', 'minutes', 'movie', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'good', 'Could', 'be', 'too', 'have', 'run', 'low', 'gas', 'WAY', 'back', 'hills', 'surprising', 'how', 'nice', 'day', 'pristine', 'setting', 'can', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'ominous.As', 'film', 'premise', 'world-wide', 'gas', 'shortage', 'leading', 'economic', 'social', 'crises', 'certainly', 'not', 'farfetched', 'considering', 'what', 'happening', 'Middle', 'East.I', 'think', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Jon', 'Carlo', 'Ashley', 'C', 'Williams', 'are', 'portraying', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'Barry', 'McBrien', 'motel', 'manager', 'McBrien', 'added', 'tension', 'two', 'scenes', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'colorless', 'conversations.As', 'script', 'writer', 'hey', 'just', 'nobody', 'bought', 'script', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'m"", 'not', 'writer', 'overall', 'think', 'Empty', 'screenplay', 'above', 'average', 'films', 'generally', 'especially', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'Tension', 'building', 'characters', 'are', 'three', 'dimensional', 'even', 'subtle', 'irony', 'work', 'i.e', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'Several', 'early', 'scenes', 'were', 'disjointed', 'too', 'long', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'smoothed', 'out', 'couple', 'lapses', 'logic', 'nothing', 'major', 'foul', 'language', 'getting', 'irritating', 'Carlo', 'character', 'not', 'actor', 'reminds', 'whiny', 'Marine', 'Aliens', '2', 'one', 'who', 'eventually', 'made', 'start', 'rooting', 'aliens.Back', 'movie', '68', 'minutes', 'way', 'story', 'portraying', '2', 'people', 'dealing', 'out', 'blue', 'crisis', 'believable', 'ways', 'opposed', 'somehow', 'becoming', 'superheroes', 'extricate', 'opinion', 'Hansard', 'improving', 'too', 'have', 'feeling', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'much', 'longer.Back', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'big', 'surprise', ""'ll"", 'give']",Empty

1430099,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004VPUSD4,MadMacs,"[2, 2]","I tried to like this - I really did. But the overdrawn and plodding script, shallow acting and moronic characterization marks this as a student film.It has an interesting premise and I'd love for this filmmaker to come back to this project in 10 years with more experience under his belt - really think it would be fascinating. That, or a better production company reboots the entire project with better actors, a tighter script and logic-based storytelling. There's a nugget of a coal that I believe can be turned into a fire, eventually leading to a really good movie.But this schoolhouse clunker with its incomprehensible pathetic ending ain't it.You can always spot a very young filmmaker: Somehow incorporating death brings ""maturity"" to their efforts. I've read many first-time storytellers/creators and invariably they use death as a flourish to their efforts; a stretch for cleverness with no real sense of what they're attempting. After a while it's actually quite amusing. As you read their very predictable fare - you just know they're trying desperately to do a M. Night Shyamalan: To get a 'gasp', an 'oh', or 'I didn't see that coming' out of you.Personal Note: Could they find a more skeezy weirdo in Barry McBrien's portrayal of the hotel manager?
