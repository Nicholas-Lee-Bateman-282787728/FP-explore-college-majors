703409,A3W4GJR5CCADBX,B000067J3S,"""50cent-haircut""","[4, 5]","In my opinion, this film should have taken home the Best Picture Oscar instead of the syrupy and falsified biopic, ""The Beautiful Mind"". As other reviewers noted, the pacing might seem slow, but it's thoroughly involving. The family dynamics and psychological drama amongst the family members are real and harrowing. ... The film revolves around this death, and the resolution to this conflict is satisfactory, yet haunting and realistic. This is a film in the vein of ""Sweet Hereafter"", the excellent Egoyan film of a few years back. Very well crafted in a spare, minimalistic way. The Dubus short story the film is based on is expanded and improved upon. Acting is subtle and great all around. Sissy Spacek got the Oscar nomination, and deservedly so, but Tom Wilkinson's empathetic performance carries the film. Great filmmaking all around.The disc itself, not the film, is a big disappointment. No commentaries, special features.

Then, in the last fifteen minutes,the dad goes out and gets revenge.THATS IT. Not only is the premise not too original, the film never grabs you. It never makes you stop and feel all that much, it never becomes the intense and emotional film it was deemed to be.The whole thing just feels sort of half-baked.You want to feel right there in the moment, in the pain, in those charcters' hearts and minds. But you just can't because the film never lets loose and allows any intensity, or emotion through.Sissy Spacek is average.Her acting is good, but its nowhere near the line of &quot;best actress of the year stuff&quot;.uh uh. No way. I could never really reach out to her character. Throughout the whole film,there was really no presence felt from her, she was just there. Tom Wilkinson did give a great, honest performance, and was perhaps the one thing that made me feel any sort of grief for the family's loss. Marisa Tomei never gets developed.We see her fondling with the son, then we see her scream after he gets murdered, and then she just vanishes.The supporting actors were good, but not spectacular.This film tries way too hard to be low key and &quot;realistic&quot;.I just found it boring, and hard to sit through.Despite a strong performance from Tom Wilkinson, I cant really think of a single reason that would make me recommend this film.",2,Lackluster,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,2071,"['Sure', 'film', 'nice', 'performances', 'elegantly', 'filmed', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'shower', 'praises', 'just', 'that.Now', 'warn', 'film', 'extremely', 'boring.No', 'not', 'slow', 'paced.Do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'slow', 'paced', 'saying', 'slow', 'song', 'boring.No', 'not', 'true.One', 'can', 'be', 'fast', 'paced', 'boring.This', 'film', 'pace', 'just', 'BORING.Do', 'really', 'need', 'countless', 'shots', 'last', 'minutes', 'time', 'characters', 'sitting', 'alone', 'rooms', 'staring', 'walls', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'fishing', 'scenes', 'Maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'problem', 'was', 'gripping', 'story', 'back', 'up.But', 'there', 'just', ""isn't.The"", 'son', 'killed', 'parents', 'grieve', 'next', 'three', 'fourths', 'film', 'Then', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'dad', 'out', 'revenge.THATS', 'IT', 'Not', 'only', 'premise', 'not', 'too', 'original', 'film', 'never', 'grabs', 'never', 'stop', 'feel', 'much', 'never', 'intense', 'emotional', 'film', 'was', 'deemed', 'be.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'feels', 'sort', 'half-baked.You', 'want', 'feel', 'right', 'there', 'moment', 'pain', 'charcters', 'hearts', 'minds', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'film', 'never', 'loose', 'intensity', 'emotion', 'through.Sissy', 'Spacek', 'average.Her', 'acting', 'good', 'nowhere', 'line', 'quot', 'best', 'actress', 'year', 'stuff', 'quot', 'uh', 'way', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'reach', 'out', 'character', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'presence', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'did', 'give', 'great', 'honest', 'performance', 'was', 'perhaps', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'feel', 'sort', 'grief', 'family', 'loss', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'never', 'developed.We', 'see', 'fondling', 'son', 'then', 'see', 'scream', 'murdered', 'then', 'just', 'vanishes.The', 'supporting', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'spectacular.This', 'film', 'tries', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'low', 'key', 'quot', 'realistic', 'quot', 'just', 'found', 'boring', 'hard', 'sit', 'through.Despite', 'strong', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'cant', 'really', 'think', 'single', 'reason', 'would', 'make', 'recommend', 'film']",In the Bedroom

703413,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000067J3S,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","`In the Bedroom' is one of those films that is so tragic, so devastating, so emotionally crippling that one is forced to tear themselves down and examine all that they are witnessing.  There are few films that can make the act of buying chocolate tear-inducing, but Todd Field's brilliantly crafted `In the Bedroom' does that very thing.  I have yet to see a film that has touched me the way that this film has, nor have I seen a film that I am this violently passionate about, but `In the Bedroom' is just that rare cinematic accomplishment that gets everything right.  It is not the most devastating story to ever be told, but the way the story is told, the way the events and their effect are delivered to the viewer is so magnificent, so raw and real that the audience quickly becomes so absorbed and invested that they feel the pain as if it were there own.The film is adapted from Andre Dubus' short story entitled `Killings' (which if you ever have the chance to read please do for it is extremely well written) which follows the aftereffects of a young mans murder on his parents.  While the short story comes in at the funeral and moves forward from there Todd Field masterfully adapted his script to include events taking place before the killing that connect the audience with not only the suffering parents but the victim as well.Todd Field made Frank Fowler real.Frank Fowler is a young college student home for the summer.  His summer activities mostly include the older Natalie Strout, a mother who is separated from her violent and jealous husband.  Frank's parents do not necessarily approve of his decision (especially not his mother) but he is a grown man and they really can't prevent him from seeing who he pleases.  The only person that can stop Frank is Frank; that is until Natalie's estranged husband Richard gets wind of the affair and decides to end it himself, with a gun.  This powerful moment (which occurs off-screen) carries the weight of the balance of the film.  Part of what makes Todd Fields direction so dynamic is decisions like the one mentioned above, to have the murder take place out of the line of sight.  In this Field is able to focus, not on the tragedy that befell Frank, but on the hole that it left in those he loved.  The killing is felt throughout the entire film yet it is never seen.Frank's parents Matt and Ruth deal with the loss of their son in different yet equally emotional ways.  They become distant from one another.  They begin to blame one another, to accuse and turn on one another.  This is expected and has been seen in films of this nature before but Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek are so brilliant here the whole situation takes on new light.  When they verbally assault one another in the living room it's shocking to the viewer and thus it has so much more weight tagged onto its back.  Their eventual struggle to reconnect is even more shocking and that final scene is a disturbing yet settling and warranted conclusion.The film is shot beautifully, in small vignettes that help the audience connect to the characters and fall into the mood that Todd Field and Andre Dubus before him set before us.  The film, playing more like a collection of scenes, gives the audience a sense of reality.  This is just life depicted in art.  The lives these two live is just like yours and mine except they've lost something very dear to them.The acting here is some of the finest in recent years.  Each and every performance comes together to establish real and raw emotions that the audience can relate to and sympathize with.  Watching Wilkinson and Spacek interact with one another in mere silence is so emotionally reaching and powerful.  Marisa Tomei is also effortlessly endearing as Natalie.  As the viewer watches her struggle for words, her uncontrollable shakes and shivers as she attempts to give her statement to the court you can't help but become invested in her character, in her pain.  Nick Stahl is effective as the doomed Frank, and he needs to be for this movie hinges on his performance.  William Mapother brings a sense of understanding to his portrayal of Richard, especially as the film spirals to its closing.No performance though is as essential to the impact of this film as Wilkinson's portrayal of Matt Fowler.  There is one scene in particular that to me is the scene this whole movie can base itself on.  It's a shot of Matt in his son's room rummaging through his things and there are tears falling from his face.  This scene chocked me up so much because his pain was so real, so realistic.  It was not dramatized.  There was no sudden outburst, no screams, nothing but real emotion.And that to me sums up `In the Bedroom', one of the finest films ever to be filmed.  This is real emotion at play here, a film that elicits in the viewer a deep-seated pain that is so real, so genuine that we can't help but feel a part of it.  This is one of the most effective character studies in recent years and will remain in your mind and in your heart forever.",5,Pain and loss at its most realistic...,1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,5040,"['Bedroom', 'one', 'films', 'so', 'tragic', 'so', 'devastating', 'so', 'emotionally', 'crippling', 'one', 'forced', 'tear', 'down', 'examine', 'are', 'witnessing', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'make', 'act', 'buying', 'chocolate', 'tear-inducing', 'Todd', 'Field', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'Bedroom', 'very', 'thing', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'touched', 'way', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'am', 'violently', 'passionate', 'Bedroom', 'just', 'rare', 'cinematic', 'accomplishment', 'everything', 'right', 'not', 'most', 'devastating', 'story', 'ever', 'be', 'told', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'way', 'events', 'effect', 'are', 'delivered', 'viewer', 'so', 'magnificent', 'raw', 'real', 'audience', 'quickly', 'so', 'absorbed', 'invested', 'feel', 'pain', 'were', 'there', 'own.The', 'film', 'adapted', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'short', 'story', 'entitled', 'Killings', 'ever', 'have', 'chance', 'read', 'please', 'do', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'aftereffects', 'young', 'mans', 'murder', 'parents', 'short', 'story', 'funeral', 'moves', 'forward', 'Todd', 'Field', 'masterfully', 'adapted', 'script', 'include', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'killing', 'connect', 'audience', 'not', 'only', 'suffering', 'parents', 'victim', 'well.Todd', 'Field', 'made', 'Frank', 'Fowler', 'real.Frank', 'Fowler', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'home', 'summer', 'summer', 'activities', 'mostly', 'include', 'older', 'Natalie', 'Strout', 'mother', 'who', 'separated', 'violent', 'jealous', 'husband', 'Frank', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'approve', 'decision', 'especially', 'not', 'mother', 'grown', 'man', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'seeing', 'who', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'stop', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'Natalie', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Richard', 'wind', 'affair', 'end', 'gun', 'powerful', 'moment', 'off-screen', 'weight', 'balance', 'film', 'Part', 'what', 'Todd', 'Fields', 'direction', 'so', 'dynamic', 'decisions', 'one', 'mentioned', 'above', 'have', 'murder', 'take', 'place', 'line', 'sight', 'Field', 'able', 'focus', 'not', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'Frank', 'hole', 'left', 'loved', 'killing', 'felt', 'entire', 'film', 'yet', 'never', 'seen.Frank', 'parents', 'Matt', 'Ruth', 'deal', 'loss', 'son', 'different', 'yet', 'equally', 'emotional', 'ways', 'become', 'distant', 'one', 'begin', 'blame', 'one', 'accuse', 'turn', 'one', 'expected', 'been', 'seen', 'films', 'nature', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'are', 'so', 'brilliant', 'here', 'whole', 'situation', 'new', 'light', 'When', 'verbally', 'assault', 'one', 'living', 'room', 'shocking', 'viewer', 'thus', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'weight', 'tagged', 'back', 'eventual', 'struggle', 'reconnect', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'final', 'scene', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'settling', 'warranted', 'conclusion.The', 'film', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'small', 'vignettes', 'help', 'audience', 'connect', 'characters', 'fall', 'mood', 'Todd', 'Field', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'set', 'film', 'playing', 'more', 'collection', 'scenes', 'audience', 'sense', 'reality', 'just', 'life', 'depicted', 'art', 'lives', 'two', 'live', 'just', 'like', 'yours', 'mine', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'something', 'very', 'dear', 'them.The', 'acting', 'here', 'finest', 'recent', 'years', 'performance', 'together', 'establish', 'real', 'raw', 'emotions', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'sympathize', 'Watching', 'Wilkinson', 'Spacek', 'interact', 'one', 'mere', 'silence', 'so', 'emotionally', 'reaching', 'powerful', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'also', 'effortlessly', 'endearing', 'Natalie', 'viewer', 'struggle', 'words', 'uncontrollable', 'shakes', 'shivers', 'give', 'statement', 'court', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'become', 'invested', 'character', 'pain', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'effective', 'doomed', 'Frank', 'be', 'movie', 'performance', 'William', 'Mapother', 'sense', 'understanding', 'portrayal', 'Richard', 'especially', 'film', 'spirals', 'closing.No', 'performance', 'though', 'as', 'essential', 'impact', 'film', 'Wilkinson', 'portrayal', 'Matt', 'Fowler', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'can', 'base', 'shot', 'Matt', 'son', 'room', 'rummaging', 'things', 'are', 'tears', 'falling', 'face', 'scene', 'chocked', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'realistic', 'was', 'not', 'dramatized', 'was', 'sudden', 'outburst', 'screams', 'nothing', 'real', 'emotion.And', 'sums', 'up', 'Bedroom', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'be', 'filmed', 'real', 'emotion', 'play', 'here', 'film', 'viewer', 'deep-seated', 'pain', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'genuine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'part', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'character', 'studies', 'recent', 'years', 'will', 'remain', 'mind', 'heart', 'forever']",In the Bedroom

Spacek is magnificent and should have won the Academy Award for her performance.  Tom Wilkinson is equally fine and should have won also.

703415,ALR35EFI69S5R,B000067J3S,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[52, 56]","It is hard to have enough good words to say regarding the level of excellence obvious in every frame of this painstakingly beautifully made drama. As is often the case these days, this work is the result of the efforts of an independent agent, showing how difficult it is to anything worthwhile done from within the confines of the Hollywood success-oriented movie-making monster. With a small budget and world-class actors, this economy-class effort shows that going in under budget doesn't necessarily lead one into mediocrity. Quite the contrary is true here. This movie shines through its poignant portrayal of a family reeling into existential crisis based on the savage murder of a family member, and deals superbly with the incredible range of emotions such an extraordinary event wreaks in its aftermath.The terrific cast includes Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson, and Marisa Tomei, each of whom was deservedly nominated for an Oscar for the performances rendered here. This is a starkly realistic depiction of life in the raw, and doesn't soft-pedal any aspect of the wrenching personal experience such monumental loss tows in its wake.  All the second-guessing, recriminations and pent-up regrets of a lifetime come pouring out as the characters try to piece together some workable way to go on in the face of the simultaneous feelings of heartache and anger they feel about what has happened, about what they let happen by acts of both commission and omission, about not stepping up to the meaning of events that led up to the tragedy.Anyone who has dealt with serious loss in life will relate to the film. In fact, the chief criticism I have of the film is that it is entirely too real, too angst-provoking, too intense, so that it is difficult to sit to watch in its entirety for that very fact. One finds oneself squirming in recognition of just how well-etched and carefully characterized each of the principal figures in the drama seems to be, and how the events that transpire all seem to build inescapably toward this most horrible of conclusions. We watch as the events reel into overdrive, the initial spate of shock and denial buckling inexorably under the need to find some fault, to lay some blame, to put some tangible thread of purpose, reason, or rationality underneath what at base seems to be such a totally illogical and absolutely insane act; the passionate murder of one man by another over love gone wrong.Briefly summarized, this is easily one of the most powerfully realistic and emotionally explosive movies of the last decade. It twists and plucks at your heart strings and then suddenly cuts them out with a blunt instrument, all without the benefit of anesthesia.  It pulls no punches in presenting an unforgettable portrait of a family flailing desperately about in an effort to come to terms with the violent death of one of its members. It is not an easy movie to watch, but is an uncommon movie experience as it deals so honestly with the extremes of emotion associated with the anger, anguish, and loss so common to the human condition. I highly recommend it.",5,"A Superb, Emotionally Shattering Drama!",1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,3097,"['hard', 'have', 'enough', 'good', 'words', 'say', 'regarding', 'level', 'excellence', 'obvious', 'frame', 'painstakingly', 'beautifully', 'made', 'drama', 'often', 'case', 'days', 'work', 'result', 'efforts', 'independent', 'agent', 'showing', 'how', 'difficult', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'done', 'confines', 'Hollywood', 'success-oriented', 'movie-making', 'monster', 'small', 'budget', 'world-class', 'actors', 'economy-class', 'effort', 'going', 'budget', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'lead', 'one', 'mediocrity', 'contrary', 'true', 'here', 'movie', 'poignant', 'portrayal', 'family', 'reeling', 'existential', 'crisis', 'based', 'savage', 'murder', 'family', 'member', 'deals', 'superbly', 'incredible', 'range', 'emotions', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'event', 'wreaks', 'aftermath.The', 'terrific', 'cast', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'whom', 'was', 'deservedly', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performances', 'rendered', 'here', 'starkly', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'life', 'raw', ""n't"", 'soft-pedal', 'aspect', 'wrenching', 'personal', 'experience', 'such', 'monumental', 'loss', 'tows', 'wake', 'second-guessing', 'recriminations', 'pent-up', 'regrets', 'lifetime', 'come', 'pouring', 'out', 'characters', 'try', 'piece', 'together', 'workable', 'way', 'go', 'face', 'simultaneous', 'feelings', 'heartache', 'anger', 'feel', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'let', 'happen', 'acts', 'commission', 'omission', 'not', 'stepping', 'up', 'meaning', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'tragedy.Anyone', 'who', 'dealt', 'serious', 'loss', 'life', 'will', 'relate', 'film', 'fact', 'chief', 'criticism', 'have', 'film', 'entirely', 'too', 'real', 'too', 'angst-provoking', 'too', 'intense', 'difficult', 'sit', 'watch', 'entirety', 'very', 'fact', 'One', 'squirming', 'recognition', 'just', 'how', 'well-etched', 'carefully', 'characterized', 'principal', 'figures', 'drama', 'be', 'how', 'events', 'transpire', 'seem', 'build', 'inescapably', 'most', 'horrible', 'conclusions', 'watch', 'events', 'reel', 'overdrive', 'initial', 'spate', 'shock', 'denial', 'buckling', 'inexorably', 'need', 'find', 'fault', 'lay', 'blame', 'put', 'tangible', 'thread', 'purpose', 'reason', 'rationality', 'what', 'base', 'be', 'such', 'totally', 'illogical', 'absolutely', 'insane', 'act', 'passionate', 'murder', 'one', 'man', 'love', 'gone', 'wrong.Briefly', 'summarized', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'powerfully', 'realistic', 'emotionally', 'explosive', 'movies', 'last', 'decade', 'plucks', 'heart', 'strings', 'then', 'suddenly', 'out', 'blunt', 'instrument', 'benefit', 'anesthesia', 'punches', 'presenting', 'unforgettable', 'portrait', 'family', 'flailing', 'desperately', 'effort', 'come', 'terms', 'violent', 'death', 'one', 'members', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'uncommon', 'movie', 'experience', 'so', 'honestly', 'extremes', 'emotion', 'associated', 'anger', 'anguish', 'loss', 'so', 'common', 'human', 'condition', 'highly', 'recommend']",In the Bedroom
703416,A1RKD1I8MW1LG6,B000067J3S,BeachReader,"[2, 8]","This movie shows the effect of tragedy on a family and the viewer reels with the pain of the parents of this murdered young man. Their future is gone when their only child dies, and then they must face the fact that his murderer's punishment might be less than they feel he deserves. The raw agony of the parents was perfectly depicted as they tried to just make it through one day at a time.That part of the movie resonated for me, but then it descended into the pathos of two people in a flawed relationship who could not communicate about their pain and decided to take the law into their own hands. Before they reached this point, they never sought any help. No counseling to try to enunciate their feelings and their fears. Nothing. Nor was the justice system given a chance. I have known parents whose children or loved ones have been tragically taken away, but none have resorted to this kind of action. Come on, folks, this is not the wild wild west, this is present-day civilized Maine. This movie asks us to believe that one murder is more morally ""correct"" than another....that if one murder is committed by a good man for a reasonable reason, it is okay.Matt, the father of the murdered Frank, wants justice and is egged on, in a sly and subconscious way, by his wife. Now Matt will not only have to live with the pain of his son's death, but with the guilt of his own actions.This turned into a movie not of redemption or resolution, but pure revenge. It could have been so much more. If the scriptwriter and director wanted the audience to sympathize with these parents and what they did, they lost this viewer. I think that Matt taking justice into his own hands was a despicable act. I also thought that the entire plot/story was pretty bad. There were so many other directions it could have taken, so much ground it could have covered. The script did not convey how the parents really felt nor the depth of their anguish and despair.I did not dislike this film because it was, as other reviewers have said, dark, slow, lifeless, too long, or predictable. My opinion is based on the message it  conveyed and the lack of any attempt to show that the actions of the parents were flawed.Marisa Tomei's wonderful performance was the one shining light in this movie.",2,"Is one murder more ""right"" than another?",1031270400,"09 6, 2002",2002,2277,"['movie', 'effect', 'tragedy', 'family', 'viewer', 'reels', 'pain', 'parents', 'murdered', 'young', 'man', 'future', 'gone', 'when', 'only', 'child', 'dies', 'then', 'must', 'face', 'fact', 'murderer', 'punishment', 'might', 'be', 'less', 'feel', 'raw', 'agony', 'parents', 'was', 'perfectly', 'depicted', 'tried', 'just', 'make', 'one', 'day', 'time.That', 'part', 'movie', 'resonated', 'then', 'descended', 'pathos', 'two', 'people', 'flawed', 'relationship', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'communicate', 'pain', 'decided', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'reached', 'point', 'never', 'sought', 'help', 'No', 'counseling', 'try', 'enunciate', 'feelings', 'fears', 'Nothing', 'was', 'justice', 'system', 'given', 'chance', 'have', 'known', 'parents', 'children', 'loved', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'tragically', 'taken', 'away', 'none', 'have', 'resorted', 'kind', 'action', 'Come', 'folks', 'not', 'wild', 'wild', 'west', 'present-day', 'civilized', 'Maine', 'movie', 'believe', 'one', 'murder', 'more', 'morally', 'correct', '.that', 'one', 'murder', 'committed', 'good', 'man', 'reasonable', 'reason', 'okay.Matt', 'father', 'murdered', 'Frank', 'justice', 'egged', 'sly', 'subconscious', 'way', 'wife', 'Now', 'Matt', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'live', 'pain', 'son', 'death', 'guilt', 'own', 'actions.This', 'turned', 'movie', 'not', 'redemption', 'resolution', 'pure', 'revenge', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'scriptwriter', 'director', 'wanted', 'audience', 'sympathize', 'parents', 'what', 'did', 'lost', 'viewer', 'think', 'Matt', 'taking', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'was', 'despicable', 'act', 'also', 'thought', 'entire', 'plot/story', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'directions', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'could', 'have', 'covered', 'script', 'did', 'not', 'convey', 'how', 'parents', 'really', 'felt', 'depth', 'anguish', 'despair.I', 'did', 'not', 'dislike', 'film', 'was', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'dark', 'slow', 'lifeless', 'too', 'long', 'predictable', 'opinion', 'based', 'message', 'conveyed', 'lack', 'attempt', 'show', 'actions', 'parents', 'were', 'flawed.Marisa', 'Tomei', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'was', 'one', 'shining', 'light', 'movie']",In the Bedroom

I rented the movie because it was supposed to be suspenseful.  Well, that it definitely wasn't.  I mean, you knew what was going to happen as soon as you see the bad, bad ex-husband.  There was at least one scene that was shocking even though you knew it was going to happen just the way it was shown on film.

Often their lives do unravel and this is all the more true if the death was a violent one like the murder in this film.  Catching every nuance perfectly, ""In The Bedroom"" portrays the anguish of one middle aged couple.  That they are mostly quiet about it is all the more telling and accurate.  We also see the events leading up to the murder.  The couple's son has been having a short term affair with an older woman who is going through a divorce.  Her soon-to-be ex-husband, played ably by Tom Cruise's real life cousin, William Mapother, can't handle their affair and explodes into violence.  This is also completely believable and Mapother doesn't make him a complete monster but, instead, someone we all know who spirals out of control while going through a divorce.  Wilkinson and Spacek both shine throughout as the middle-aged couple.  Watch especially Wilkinson's scenes as the film roars to a close.  They are very quiet and low-key yet the effect is electric.

The tragedy forces the parents to confront their own faults, fears and ill feelings concerning their son and each other. The silence is finally broken, and the lack of communication in their marriage as a whole is finally addressed.

And that is obvious by reading many of the reviews here (some reviews, by the way, are rather disturbing--suggesting that the &quot;violent scenes&quot; weren't enough to keep it going, making me wonder if they think there needs to be violence in movies to add excitement).Anyway, no need to rehash the details of the story (you're best off knowing little to nothing about the story before you see it).  Also no need to say that the actors are quite excellent (Tom Wilkinson a particular standout; he's really the star of the show).  What I do want to note is the direction, editing, and lighting in the film.  I haven't seen a movie with this kind of directorial flair in a long time that didn't come across as too forced or pretentious.

Made me wish I had seen it in the theater instead of waiting for the video.Some people didn't enjoy this movie because they were too busy taking sides with the characters, the issues, etc.  That's not important here.  Does every character in every movie either need to be all good or all bad to be understood by your average moviegoer?  Does everyone in the movie need to behave the way you would?  Isn't part of the reason we watch movies to witness other people's experiences and imagine what it must be like to experience them yourselves?  Call me dumb (which I'm not), but I thought that was the point to this film.If you are one of those seemingly few people that do watch movies to witness and imagine other people's experiences, then you're in for a rough yet very rewarding ride.

Written and directed by first-timer, Todd Field, it's certainly bound to be a classic. &quot;In The Bedroom&quot; takes place in the quiet, small town of Camden, Maine. There, we meet a pretty normal family: the husband, Matt Fowler (Tom Wilkinson), his wife, Ruth Fowler (Sissy Spacek), and their college-aged son, Frank Fowler (Nick Stahl). Frank is the son anybody could ever hope for: he's young, talented, good-looking, kind, and intelligent. But when he comes home for the summer from college, he gets into a relationship with an older woman, Natalie Strout (Marisa Tomei) who has two young children and is not yet divorced from her troubled husband, Richard Strout (William Mapother). Ruth and Matt have different opinions on Frank's romancing Natalie. Matt thinks Frank &quot;scored big-time&quot;, while Ruth doesn't like the relationship at all and wants him to concentrate harder with his studies and to see someone closer to his own age. When Richard finds out about the affair, he is outraged and murders Frank one day while Frank is at Natalie's house with her. Now Matt and Ruth are in total grief over there loss, and the court won't put Richard in jail because they don't have complete proof that he had actually murdered Frank because there were no real witnesses. Matt and Ruth's relationship with each other is going down the drain because Frank was the only one who kept their relationship going. Now, Matt and Ruth must try to make the best of their lives and not give up on all hope.The acting for &quot;In The Bedroom&quot; is what really made this film work, since there is no real action and at times it is pretty slow and can be depressing to watch. The script is definitely one of the best. Sissy Spacek has to be one of my all-time favorite actresses--she is just simply superb in any role she is given. Tom Wilkinson is wonderful and so are Nick Stahl, Marisa Tomei, and William Mapother. I've heard many mixed reviews about this particular film, but when I saw it in theaters I left at the end in total awe.

It's equally easy to see why the film recieved such widespread kudos, thanks in large part to the actors involved.  The crux of the plot is the involvement of Frank Fowler with a local mother of two, who also happens to have a slightly off-kilter spouse hanging around.  You know  from the get-go that violence is going to ensue, though none  of it transpires on screen.  The eventual murder of Fowler drives the remainder of the movie, as his parents examine  their life without their son, as well as co-existing in a  town where his murderer is roaming free.  To say that Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are first-rate would be doing both  of them an unjustice--this film is a master class in  beautifully understated, unaffected acting(no offense to Halle Berry or Denzel Washington, but these two were equally Oscar-worthy). The supporting cast is seamless, with Marisa Tomei turning in possibly her best work to date and Nick Stahl  equally effective as young Frank Fowler.  Granted, the movie does meander some here and there, drawing it out beyond an unnecessary two hours, and the movie-of-the-week ending,though understandable, is a little too derivative for a movie that  for the most part is anything but.

703426,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B000067J3S,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[0, 2]","This low-budget independent film did little until it nailed five Oscar nominations, including 2001's Best Picture, and its accolades are warranted. As a high school choir director living with her doctor husband in a lobster town in Maine, the incomparable Sissy Spacek unleashes yet another in a long line of riveting performances, this one as the mother of a 21-year-old son (Nick Stahl) who is murdered by his new girlfriend's (Marisa Tomei) jealous estranged husband. From there, Spacek's character of Ruth Fowler races for an absolution that doesn't come, and it's that second loss of redemption that brings her in conflict with husband Matt (British actor Tom Wilkinson in an equally raw performance). Both he and Spacek were justly Oscar-nominated, as was Tomei in a powerful turn that far supercedes her earlier Oscar win in &quot;My Cousin Vinny.&quot; &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; works for essentially two reasons: a strong and realistic plot acted by strong performers acting like real people grappling with real feelings, and its visual simplicity. Freshman director Todd Field is masterful in focusing his film family's devastation on anger (at the judicial system, their son's killer and, to an extent, the woman whose husband did the crime) rather than grief, and it is that anger which leads to a finalty that, although reluctantly expected, is nonetheless shattering. But if the drama and helpless witnessing of a family jetting toward disintegration is not something a viewer wants to see, Spacek's numbing performance alone makes a watch worthy. She and her two fellow Oscar nominees are nothing less that raw on a very emotional level.",4,An Everyman's tale of loss and implosion,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,1653,"['low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'did', 'little', 'nailed', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', '2001', 'Best', 'Picture', 'accolades', 'are', 'warranted', 'high', 'school', 'choir', 'director', 'living', 'doctor', 'husband', 'lobster', 'town', 'Maine', 'incomparable', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'riveting', 'performances', 'one', 'mother', '21-year-old', 'son', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'who', 'murdered', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'jealous', 'estranged', 'husband', 'there', 'Spacek', 'character', 'Ruth', 'Fowler', 'races', 'absolution', ""n't"", 'come', 'second', 'loss', 'redemption', 'conflict', 'husband', 'Matt', 'British', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'equally', 'raw', 'performance', 'Spacek', 'were', 'justly', 'Oscar-nominated', 'was', 'Tomei', 'powerful', 'turn', 'far', 'earlier', 'Oscar', 'win', 'quot', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinny.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bedroom', 'quot', 'essentially', 'two', 'reasons', 'strong', 'realistic', 'plot', 'acted', 'strong', 'performers', 'acting', 'real', 'people', 'grappling', 'real', 'feelings', 'visual', 'simplicity', 'Freshman', 'director', 'Todd', 'Field', 'masterful', 'focusing', 'film', 'family', 'devastation', 'anger', 'judicial', 'system', 'son', 'killer', 'extent', 'woman', 'husband', 'did', 'crime', 'rather', 'grief', 'anger', 'finalty', 'reluctantly', 'expected', 'nonetheless', 'shattering', 'drama', 'helpless', 'witnessing', 'family', 'jetting', 'disintegration', 'not', 'something', 'viewer', 'see', 'Spacek', 'numbing', 'performance', 'alone', 'watch', 'worthy', 'two', 'fellow', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'are', 'nothing', 'raw', 'very', 'emotional', 'level']",In the Bedroom
703427,A13EIM593I23PR,B000067J3S,Clay Bacon,"[2, 3]","IN THE BEDROOM absolutely knocked me off balance.  I sat on the couch, watching this film, with my hand over my mouth half the time, a subconscious response to the tragedy unfolding before me.  This film contains the same powerful force and resonance as did REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and EYE OF GOD, which coincidentally starred Nick Stahl in another tragic role.  It is very depressing to watch though; I ask myself sometimes if I am a masochist, subjecting myself to these difficult films.The performances are &quot;pitch perfect,&quot; a compliment which has been bestowed on Sissy Spacek numerous times.  Spacek is one of the most consistent actresses present who never lets us down with a less-than-perfect performance.  Here, her rage and sense for vengeance could match even that of Carrie's.  At the end, when her character, Ruth, asks her husband, &quot;Did you do it?&quot; the chills you get are indescribable, like a modern-day, small-town Lady MacBeth and her own &quot;Out, damned spot!&quot;  Tom Wilkinson, trying on a New England accent, which you'd never know isn't first-nature to him, plays Matt Fowler, the husband.  His steely stare, his pallor, indeed, his voice all make me think that no one else could've played his role.  The casting was inspired.  Marisa Tomei, greatly undervalued due to cheesy roles in movies like WHAT WOMEN WANT, strikes many chords.  The scene where she visits Ruth to express condolences is devastating.  William Mapother, as Richard Strout, is terrifying.This movie is more about things unsaid, things kept to oneself, which is more apparent in Andre Dubus's short story upon which the movie is based.  The restraint shown in the performances and in the directing style of Todd Field makes the scenes all the more tragic.  How can a parent ever be happy again?  In the end, the feeling that Matt's actions are justified even if they are not merciful strikes the biggest chord.  When he says, &quot;I couldn't wait any more,&quot; we all sympathize; we would've even done it for him if it hadn't meant so much for him to do it himself.When REQUIEM FOR A DREAM used nightmarish striking imagery to enhance its message, IN THE BEDROOM uses images of the everyday and mundane, images far more affecting because we see them everyday ourselves, a fishing lure, an envelope in the mail, a trip to the market, a photo on the wall.  I hope this movie brings a special significance to these mundane artifacts, to elucidate their precious nature.

703428,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000067J3S,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[6, 7]","I finally saw this film the other night and I have to say that I was utterly floored.  This has to be one of the most moving films I've ever seen.  Adapted from Andre Dubus' novel entitled `Killings', `In the Bedroom' delivers a sharp script and excellent acting to give the viewer a complete movie experience.  In the small lobster town of Camden Maine the Fowler family is about to get hit with a brick, a very large painstaking brick.  Matt (Wilkinson) and Ruth (Spacek) are about to lose their only son Frank (Stahl).  When Frank returns from college for the summer he takes up with Natalie (Tomei), a slightly older women with two small boys and a violent estranged husband.  When her husband finds out she's sleeping with Frank he reacts...violently and kills him.The remainder of the film delves into the feelings each party is left with, most notably the parents, and how this tragedy has ripped them apart and causes them to doubt each other and themselves.  As the trial against Natalie's husband Richard (Mapother) continues to get stretched out, and after he's released on bail, the stress of the whole situation starts to weaken the Fowlers day by day, especially Ruth as she has to contend with seeing her son's killer walking the streets.This film is really substantiated by the performances by the entire cast, Tom Wilkinson in particular.  His subtlety in delivery is so brilliantly poised that we are given a devastating glimpse into this mans soul without over dramatics.  He elegantly paints a picture of pain and despair without shoving it in our face.  You just want to hold him and tell him it'll be alright...There's one scene in particular that really got to me...that grabbed me by the heartstrings if you will.  After the funeral Matt makes his way up to his son's bedroom and as he's looking through his things you get a glimpse of these tears rolling off his face and its there in that moment, in the bedroom, that this movie reached out to me.I don't know what more I can say other than the fact that this movie is so much more than entertainment.  It delves into the raw emotions of the people involved and delivers a tragic look at loss and grief and the horrible things we may do in seeking out justice (or merely seeking peace of mind).  While it does move slowly, that's a big part of the power it holds for it's in the slow moving sequences of events where we get to see the effect the murder has had on this family.  I agree with one reviewer who said you'll either love it or hate it.  I loved it and like his girlfriend, my wife fell asleep (to her credit it was really late) but if your not a fan of slow moving melodramas then you may want to skip this one.  If you are though a fan of touching, dramatic, emotionally driven character studies then this is just the movie you've been waiting for.

One thing leads to another with disastrous results for Wilkinson's son. The lead up to the tragedy is well done, if a bit drawn out.

Nonetheless, this movie digs deep into the heart for both love and loss, a difficult task in modern cinema.

If I could point one reason as to why this movie was so well received by the Academy, I would say it was the courage and abandon with which it went against the grain of New England (American?) conservatism (it's another conversation as to how such a simple concept of art should seem to innovative to Hollywood).The symbolism of a house, and the bedroom that separate the people living in it is strong -- they are physically together, but mentally stored away in different compartments... perhaps for good reason. Son Frank (Nick Stahl) is studying to be an architect, and drafts elaborate structures of dream houses in his room. Dad Matt (Tom Wilkinson, who is really the star of the film, despite what everybody says about co-star Sissy Spacek's performance) is a doctor who can't fix what's going wrong with his family this summer.

Sissy Spacek's character plays a middle-aged high school choir director who is married to an ivy-league educated doctor, played by Tom Wilkinson. Their son Frank, played by Nick Stahl, is an ivy-league educated architect working as a fisherman. His girlfriend Natalie, played by Marrisa Tomei, has kids from her marriage with her ex-husband, played by William Mapother. Mapother's character is jealous over the situation arising between Natalie and Frank and how that might encroach on his inappropriate and abusive relationship with his ex-wife and kids.The conflict is resolved through a series of realistically portrayed small-town events and accurate emotional portrayals of the actors in telling this story. This is a film about right and wrong. It is a film about society's weaknesses and about the unfortunate unfolding of events. A powerful but somewhat subdued and slow-moving drama, 'In the Bedroom' is not for the appetitive movie-goer who demands constant edge-of-your-seat action. It is for the patient, sentimental, and philosophical people among us who feed on this kind of realistic and dramatic portrayal of everyday real-life tragedy.What makes this story particularly special is its unique structure: it has two conflicts. One conflict that gets resolved in the first part of the movie, and a second conflict that gets involved in the second part of the movie. The two conflicts are directly related to each other and the climaxes are in direct relation to one another. It is a story reminiscent of any Shakespearian tragedy and the natural impulses among humans in one's striving for happiness, control, and justice. This low-key setting for what turns out to be a mysterious and dramatic chain of events is part of what keeps this movie within the realm of dramatic and realistic limits.

While Matt Fowler pretends that nothing has happened, his wife is grieving hard. Matt goes through a lot of inner struggles unknown to his wife. It was through their violent confrontation that wife played by the wonderful Sissy Spacek realized what really drove her son to his eventual and untimely death.

While most people are familiar with past winners, few remember those that were nominated but did not win. Therefore, I started with In the Bedroom which was released in 2001 and was nominated for five academy awards including best picture, best actor, best actress, and best supporting actress. The plot of the movie centers around the Fowler family which is comprised of Frank Fowler, his mother and his father. Frank is a 20 something year old who is spending his last summer at home before going to graduate school. His plans are complicated when he falls in love with an older woman who has two children and an extremely abusive husband from whom she is separated. For the first half of the movie, Frank struggles with his decision to go to college and believes that he may defer his enrollment for another year in order to spend more time with his new love. Frank's parents disagree with his choice and fear that his relationship with his older girlfriend will jeopardize his entire future. When tragedy strikes, the once ""perfect"" family is severed and they must try to find their way back to each other.The acting in this film is superb and is clearly worthy of its various nominations. The first half of the film was extremely close to perfection. The rising action created such tension between the characters that it spilled out of the TV and made a large pit in my stomach. However, once the film reaches its climax it appears that it has few places to go. Being that it reached its peak early in the film, there is almost an hour in which the two main characters looked at each other with knowing glances and did little else. Yet, the last ten minutes move so quickly that it leaves the viewer wondering why such action was delayed for so long!

Many people have remarked that the charachters are boring. THe charachters aren't boring their regular, everyday people. You can relate this couple to your neighbors, or even to your own family. That, is where the sheer power of this film comes from. The realization that such a tragedy can happen to anybody.

703450,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000067J3S,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 5]","Once again an independent film shows that a good story, insightful directing and inspired acting can outperform the Hollywood giants with their $50 Million budgets.  This film was produced for a scant $1.7 million and garnered five Oscar nominations including best picture.  Writer/Director/Producer Todd Field, who has spent most of his career almost invisibly as an actor, explodes onto the scene on the other side of the camera and serves notice that he is a force to be reckoned with.The story is powerful and poignant.  It is the story of a family that is shattered by a horrible tragedy and it examines their ordeal as they come to terms with it.  Field's workup is wonderfully done, giving care to assure that we understand and involve ourselves with these characters.  It is a very likeable family, with down to earth people that come across like our closest friends.  This makes their tragedy into our tragedy, so we easily identify with the shearing forces that shred their lives.Field shows an extreme talent for bringing a stark realism to the screen.  The characters are consistent with their development and exceedingly believable.  The way he frames the shots and his choice of close-ups of inanimate objects is superb, heightening the feeling of being there.  Having spent a good bit of time in New England myself, I noticed that the locations capture much of the feeling of the place.  Even the sounds are more realistic than most films.After the tragedy occurs, Field casts a suffocating pall over the film as he allows the humanness of his characters to dominate.  Shock and denial are followed by seething resentment and blame.  The characters are seen going robotically through the motions of their daily lives as they attempt to cope with the reality of the heartbreak that has befallen them.  If there is one area where Field errs slightly, it may be here.  He purposely dwells on these scenes to bring the audience to the same level of frustration and anguish as the characters, in an attempt to make us see that the final resolution is inevitable.  However, his pace is overly torturous.  The film bogs down and becomes repetitive during the second act, making the entire film seem much too long.  However, this is more than compensated by the tense and evocative final act.The acting is riveting.  Tom Wilkinson, Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei were all nominated for Oscars.  December seems to be a lucky month for birthdays in this film, since all four of the leads were born in that month (Wilkinson, 12/12, Spacek, 12/25, Tomei, 12/4 and Stahl, 12/5).Wilkinson (""The Full Monty"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Patriot"") emerges from the shadow of supporting roles with a compelling performance in the lead.  His sincerity and believability endow his character with an amiable nature.  His anger and grief is contained, yet while he appears impassive, it is clear that the emotional vortex runs deep.  This is a breakout performance for Wilkinson and hopefully will portend larger roles in the future.For Sissy Spacek, this is her sixth Oscar nomination.  Throughout her career, Spacek has dependably belted out one commanding dramatic performance after another and this is no exception.  This is a somewhat more emotionally repressed character than she usually plays, but she does it beautifully.  When the dam finally breaks and she goes to pieces, it is one of the most intense scenes in the film.Marisa Tomei may be one of the most underappreciated actors in film today.  After her best supporting Oscar for ""My Cousin Vinny"", one would have expected more leading roles.  They never came and she continued to deliver a parade of terrific supporting roles.  Tomei is a very visceral actor, with great emotional range and the ability to make any character seem lovable.  Here, as Natalie, she pours herself into a confused and broken girl trying desperately to put her life together after her breakup with an abusive husband.  Her romantic scenes are touching and she has numerous heartrending scenes that punctuate the feelings that the other characters are suppressing.  This is a richly textured performance that helps give the film its soul.  Perhaps now, after 20 years in the business Tomei will finally be discovered.Nick Stahl rounds out the main cast as son Frank Fowler.  Stahl effectively captures the struggle of young adulthood, trying to manage complex adult situations with the inexperience and naivet&eacute; of youth.  William Mapother does a fine job as Natalie's abusive husband.  Mapother's resume is mostly comprised of bit parts in the films of his famous cousin Thomas Mapother (aka Tom Cruise) having appeared in five of them.  However Mapother shows talent of his own in some intense scenes with Tomei and Stahl.  I was impressed how he was able to switch from arrogant intimidation to meek pusillanimity in the final scene with Wilkinson.  It is the perfect portrayal of the bully who is only strong in the face of those weaker than he.This is a disturbing and powerful film that cuts your heart out and serves it up cold.  There is a thunderhead of new and unheralded talent that converges to create an extraordinary independent film.  Though Field is a bit heavy handed in the second act, everything else is near perfect.  I rated it a 9/10.  For lovers of drama and great acting this film is a must see.",5,Human drama par excellence,1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,5359,"['Once', 'again', 'independent', 'film', 'shows', 'good', 'story',

The action, when it comes, takes the viewer by surprize because the film so lanquidly tells the story of these people.  I found the juxtaposition of the men and women in the film with the lobsters, so important to the small Maine coastal town, brilliant.  You realize quite quickly that the scene on the lobster boat, where the Dr. says that two male lobsters can't be in a trap, in the bedroom, at the same time and that the older female lobster can kill the males, too, is important because of the link with the title.  Immediately, the volatile relationships of lobsters are juxtaposed with that of the triangle of Natalie, Matt, and Natalie's ex.  Later, and more subtly, the metaphor is further drawn out to include the Dr., his wife, and Natalie's ex.  Both women, in their own way, become the older female lobster that kills the males.  I never thought lobsters could be so profound!  This movie was slow, but beautifully so.  I highly recommend.  Sissy Spacek gets better with age; Tom Wilkinson is great.

703452,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000067J3S,Get What We Give,"[3, 4]","In The Bedroom is a film that may not be for everyone.  It is a drama that hinges on real emotions of real people.  Today, it seems people want explosions, films written with foul language as a basis of the text, and CGI effects.  This film is smarter than any of that.Nick Stahl (who is amazingly refreshing and believable), a young college student home for the summer, is dating Marisa Tomei, a ""divored"" older woman with two young sons.  Nick claims the relationhsip isn't serious, but both his parents (Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek) know otherwise.  The girlfriend's ex-husband doesn't want to let her go and he does what he can to push she and the student apart.  I will not tell more of the plot as it could ruin the film for you.  However, I will say that the title refers not to a sexual relationship, as such, but rather an expression that... two males ""in the bedroom"" with one female leads to competition.  What that competition is and does is the subject of this film.Tom Wilkinson so easily slips into the skin of his character that you will believe that he is playing himself.  This is a real man and you know it.  Spacek goes beyond anything she's done since ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and delivers a triumphant performance.In the Bedroom does have its faults though.  It's slow.  It's often quite slow.  I really felt like it could have used some more heavy handed editing.  And the editing itself is often disconcerting.  It seems to jump and to be choppy as if the editor were experimenting with a new tool while he did his job.On the whole the film is really amazing and well written.  As somone who is sick to death of the free flowing cursing and sex in the majority of Hollywood's films, this was refreshing.  It wasn't immune to cursing, but it was certainly not obtrusive.  Also, there was absolutley no nudity and yet the same ""feeling"" was delivered.

The &quot;bad guys&quot; - a mother who is a music teacher, a father who is a doctor - have one son, talented, extremely handsome, who is likely to be an architect (what else?) but indulged by the couple to the extent that his &quot;summer fling&quot; of sleeping with a single mother of two (who happens to be the estranged partner of the son of the richest man in town) is accepted with equanimity (at least without complaint) by them.  The mother allows a worrying frown to cross her brow, the father is just VERY understanding and non-judgemental.  The &quot;good guy&quot;, who is (perhaps understandably) left by the single mother (Marissa Tomei), is thought by all to be a thoroughly unpleasant, spoilt, roue who has been known to resort to domestic violence to get his way with Ms Tomei.  I say &quot;bad guys&quot; because the couple want and exact revenge for the loss of their son (accidentally? shot by the &quot;good guy&quot;.)  I say &quot;good guy&quot; because he is the one abandoned, who sees his ex-partner and their children openly enjoying the hospitality and friendship of  the parents of his younger rival, and is murdered by the doctor - and it's a murder conducted in a pre-meditated, calculating, planned and carefully executed way.  So that's the &quot;set up&quot;. One of course is meant to sympathise with the middle class couple and despise the rich guy's son and cuckold and cheer when he &quot;gets it&quot;.  When we do, if we do, then we are complicit in seeking to act outside the justice system, and by extension, support those who do.

In the small town of Camden the father, Matt Fowler (Tom Wilkinson), is a medical doctor, the mother, Ruth (Sissy Spacek) is a chorus teacher in the local high school.Apparently the paternal grandfather had been a lobsterman. Matt and Ruth's son, Frank, has taken up lobstering to make extra money, and because it's in the family blood. He's bought a boat and goes out each day to pull in the traps. Lobstering has skipped a generation, but the father still yearns to go out to sea and be part of the family tradition. The son has a promising future in college, and has architectural talents.Frank has fallen in love with an older woman, Natalie (Marisa Tomei) separated from her abusive husband, not yet divorced, with two young children. Her husband, Richard Strout, is the scion of the Strout Canning Company, apparently the town's main employer. In the small town it's difficult to get away from the past, and the canning company is a constant presence.In a fateful scene Frank gets killed. Think of it as a classical tragedy: the prince has been killed. The king and queen are grieving, distraught. The death is driving them further and further apart. They grieve deeply over their dead son, but they grieve separately. They cannot join each other in their sorrow because each blames the other for what has happened.What they say to each other in their big blow-up has truth on both sides. Has the mother been too strict, too much of a controller? At times is she like Lady Macbeth? Has the father been too indulgent? Has he had a tendency to look the other way when it came to the son? Has he been envious of his son? Has he been weak and capable of being manipulated?The movie carefully reveals the fault lines in the lives of the Fowlers. Viewers will have a difficult time anticipating where the movie is heading, but the director wants viewers to focus on the characters of the father and mother as determinants of the plot's direction. There are no easy answers, only moral dilemmas.This film has great cinematography and editing. The acting is superb. It's full of a lot of prosaic details that make it very real and believable.

Exquisitely drawn characters are wonderfully portrayed by Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson, as two parents of a much-loved only son.  When tragedy strikes, the couple withdraw from one another and from the world, an all-too-real reaction to such a situation.  Scene after wordless scene, we see these two parents go through the grieving process in two different and unhealthy ways.  Less is definitely more here, as the tensions build between the two.

703471,A6Y58HAXDXVDV,B000067J3S,Karl,"[6, 8]","At its core, In the Bedroom is about the price men are willing to pay to please and be with the women they love. Directed by Todd Field and based on a short story by the late Andre Dubus, the film doesn't address this theme overtly, but rather through the actions and (more importantly) reactions of the characters involved, which bind it to a logical structure that otherwise might have fallen apart given the events that take place during the movie's alarming climax.Set during summertime in the picturesque fishing town of Camden, Maine, In the Bedroom examines the lives of Matt Fowler (brilliantly handled by veteran actor Tom Wilkinson) and his choral director wife, Ruth (a great Sissy Spacek). Both are concerned about the increasingly serious relationship between their college-aged son Frank (Nick Stahl) and Natalie (beautifully handled by Marisa Tomei), a woman ten years his senior. Compounding matters are Natalie's two young boys and the unwanted presence of her estranged husband, Richard (an appropriately menacing William Mapother).When Frank informs his father that, rather than head off to graduate school to become an architect, he might simply take up lobster trawling for a living in order to remain close to Natalie and her boys, the expected family crisis ensues. Ruth can't abide the thought of her only child throwing away his future on a woman who isn't even divorced from her first husband, while Matt remains stubbornly convinced that Frank will eventually do the right thing and head off to school.Sadly, tragedy intervenes in the form of the bitterly jealous Richard, whose fateful confrontation with Frank triggers a devastating string of events that forever changes the lives of all involved. The cracks in Matt and Ruth's marriage takes center stage as the seemingly well-adjusted couple is forced to deal with the grief over what's happened and the lack of communication that has steadily eroded the bedrock of their marriage over the years.The ultimate action the couple takes to, literally, save their marriage, if not their very sanity, proves the film's riskiest move. But it works simply because of the deeper issue of a husband's loyalty to his wife and the strength the two draw from one another to live through a terrible situation.In the Bedroom bravely addresses the impossibility of finding true justice when the hurt is so deep, and the loss so great, that no amount of judicial punishment can fill the void.Antonio Calvache's photography compares to painter Andrew Wyeth's haunting canvas &quot;Christina's World,&quot; and the film pays its debt to Wyeth and the idyllic yet strangely tragic images he produced throughout the film. The score is appropriately understated, never getting in the way of the dramatic interplay between the characters. The acting is simply peerless.On the downside, Field allows the film to drag a bit during the middle third, and poker playing scenes that have one of Matt's friends reciting poems by Blake and Frost come across as a little too obviously connected to the plot at hand.In the Bedroom is a tough, honest movie, one that might have shined even brighter had it not relied on shocking surprises, instead simply laying its cards on the table from the outset and working backwards to show how its characters reached their current situation. As it is, the film is still head and shoulders above the average fare, revealing an undeniably potent intensity that lingers long after the lights have gone up in the theater.",4,Tough Love,1044144000,"02 2, 2003",2003,3505,"['core', 'Bedroom', 'price', 'men', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'please', 'be', 'women', 'love', 'Directed', 'Todd', 'Field', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'late', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'film', ""n't"", 'address', 'theme', 'overtly', 'rather', 'actions', 'more', 'importantly', 'reactions', 'characters', 'involved', 'bind', 'logical', 'structure', 'otherwise', 'might', 'have', 'fallen', 'apart', 'given', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'movie', 'alarming', 'climax.Set', 'summertime', 'picturesque', 'fishing', 'town', 'Camden', 'Maine', 'Bedroom', 'lives', 'Matt', 'Fowler', 'brilliantly', 'handled', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'choral', 'director', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'great', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'are', 'concerned', 'increasingly', 'serious', 'relationship', 'college-aged', 'son', 'Frank', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'Natalie', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'woman', 'ten', 'years', 'senior', 'Compounding', 'matters', 'are', 'Natalie', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'unwanted', 'presence', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Richard', 'appropriately', 'menacing', 'William', 'Mapother', '.When', 'Frank', 'father', 'rather', 'head', 'graduate', 'school', 'become', 'architect', 'might', 'simply', 'take', 'up', 'lobster', 'trawling', 'living', 'order', 'remain', 'close', 'Natalie', 'boys', 'expected', 'family', 'crisis', 'ensues', 'Ruth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'abide', 'thought', 'only', 'child', 'throwing', 'away', 'future', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'divorced', 'first', 'husband', 'Matt', 'stubbornly', 'convinced', 'Frank', 'will', 'eventually', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'head', 'school.Sadly', 'tragedy', 'intervenes', 'form', 'bitterly', 'jealous', 'Richard', 'fateful', 'confrontation', 'Frank', 'triggers', 'devastating', 'string', 'events', 'forever', 'lives', 'involved', 'cracks', 'Matt', 'Ruth', 'marriage', 'center', 'stage', 'seemingly', 'well-adjusted', 'couple', 'forced', 'deal', 'grief', 'what', 'happened', 'lack', 'communication', 'steadily', 'eroded', 'bedrock', 'marriage', 'years.The', 'ultimate', 'action', 'couple', 'literally', 'save', 'marriage', 'not', 'very', 'sanity', 'film', 'riskiest', 'move', 'simply', 'deeper', 'issue', 'husband', 'loyalty', 'wife', 'strength', 'two', 'draw', 'one', 'live', 'terrible', 'situation.In', 'Bedroom', 'bravely', 'impossibility', 'finding', 'true', 'justice', 'when', 'hurt', 'so', 'deep', 'loss', 'so', 'great', 'amount', 'judicial', 'punishment', 'can', 'fill', 'void.Antonio', 'Calvache', 'photography', 'painter', 'Andrew', 'Wyeth', 'haunting', 'canvas', 'quot', 'Christina', 'World', 'quot', 'film', 'debt', 'Wyeth', 'idyllic', 'yet', 'strangely', 'tragic', 'images', 'produced', 'film', 'score', 'appropriately', 'understated', 'never', 'getting', 'way', 'dramatic', 'interplay', 'characters', 'acting', 'simply', 'peerless.On', 'downside', 'Field', 'film', 'drag', 'bit', 'middle', 'third', 'poker', 'playing', 'scenes', 'have', 'one', 'Matt', 'friends', 'reciting', 'poems', 'Blake', 'Frost', 'come', 'little', 'too', 'obviously', 'connected', 'plot', 'Bedroom', 'tough', 'honest', 'movie', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'shined', 'even', 'brighter', 'had', 'not', 'relied', 'shocking', 'surprises', 'instead', 'simply', 'laying', 'cards', 'table', 'outset', 'working', 'backwards', 'show', 'how', 'characters', 'reached', 'current', 'situation', 'film', 'still', 'head', 'shoulders', 'average', 'fare', 'revealing', 'undeniably', 'potent', 'intensity', 'lingers', 'long', 'lights', 'have', 'gone', 'up', 'theater']",In the Bedroom

In this movie, she has the role of a lifetime as a wife and mother who is uncomfortable with her son's latest choice of lovers (a married woman with two young children). I hesitate to say too much about what happens in this film but will note that a murder sets off a chain of events and rocks a marriage to the core.Throughout this film, I kept thinking how much the events reflected real life and didn't seem at all artificial or unbelievable, let alone staged. I got the impression that director Todd Field didn't feel compelled to ""explain"" his characters or their motivations.If you like films which end in nice, neat conclusions, be forewarned that this movie isn't one of those. Instead, Field throws viewers into the middle of a family which is struggling to stay afloat.

Zero bonus materials.  The good news is that this is an extremely interesting film to watch, very theatrical in its use of blackouts which gives the film the slow deliberate pacing and a sense of life-like gravity to the unfolding events.  I particularly was impressed with the visuals such as focusing on the curtains blowing in the hallway as you hear sounds of conversation happening off frame.  In another shot, you see Matt sitting down on the bed while the camera focuses on the mirror on the wall, almost like you are seeing the reflection of a couple in tragedy.  The visual power of the film repeatedly is emphasized over the dialogue.  In one scene, after the tragedy, Matt (the father) is working on the boat and the boy of the girlfriend comes to the top of the pier and looks down.  Both stare at each other, neither makes a motion of greeting, then the boy bicycles off.  It's a powerful scene, showing how the link between them has dissolved.  In another scene, Ruth (the mother) gets a posthumous letter from a sweepstakes touting that the Frank (the dead son) could be a winner.  We fully understood, in the absence of words.  The climax of the film is similarly understated and undercut, making it seem all the more realistic and lifelike.  The father tells Richard, ""Don't talk.""  As the film ends and the camera pulls back on the early morning scene of the little Maine town, we know that life will go on; and yet for some it will always be different than before.

First time director Todd Field uses the fine touch of a stage director to use the ordinary American Home as a backdrop with incredible symbolism.  One of the truly symbolic gestures of the film is Spacek's chain smoking -- it says more about her anxiety and anguish than words could ever tell.  In the final scene, a lazy spiral of smoke from the cigarette she leaves on the nightstand tells us exactly who is at peace, at last.Not so Tom Wilkinson, as the father, in an amazing performance.  Wilkinson's ease at demonstrating, rather than talking of his feelings and pride for his son and his wife is remarkable.  At the close of the film, it is he you worry about -- someone whose soul will continue to be ravaged by violence, even by his own hand.  The killing in the films takes place largely offscreen, but the violence is jarring and raw.Marisa Tomei picks up the vibration from him, and much of her character's feeling is reflected in the way she looks, and not what she says.  There are other fine performances in the film, including Spacek, who drives everyone to distraction.  The Eastern European dirges she has her choir perform on the anniversary of her son's death are as mournful as anything I've ever heard.In the Bedroom is not for everyone.

The story (and especially the superb acting) give us a mature, complex and subtle look at two relationships.  In one we have a love triangle that turns dangerous, and in the other we have what seems to be on the surface, an average, middle age loving couple.  But later you discover there's a lot of pain and frustration that has been bubbling deep beneath the surface for years -- very true to life.The plot takes you in an unusual direction for a Hollywood movie, and the two big scenes (especially the climactic scene), are surprising for such a soberly-paced and subtle story.The pacing is slow, and the ending is full of potential interpretations.  When I watched it late one night, I thought the ending was simply unresolved, almost as if the author and director weren't sure where they had taken us, but by morning, I had a completely different interpretation, with a very definite opinion about the surviving relationship.The way this was originally marketed, I expected a different movie than the one I watched.  I was expecting something far more suspenseful, but what I watched was slower and more true to life.  Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised.

703481,AEADTCS53O06B,B000067J3S,Lynn,"[2, 2]","I don't understand all the negative reviews of this movie.  It's one of my favorites, because of its understated power, the haunting music and story, and how it stays with you.  Those who say it's ""boring"" or had trouble sitting through it obviously are not mature enough to watch something like that, who expect constant ""action"" and who have short attention spans.  The story, about a couple whose only son is killed, follows them as they grieve (albeit differently), maneuver through the criminal justice system, and ultimately make a decision which will further impact them the rest of their lives.It's done sensitively and in an emotionally wrenching way, with supurb performances from all cast.  Key to the story, and the reason for the title, is the symbolism of the lobster industry, as the story takes place in Maine.  The phrase ""in the bedroom"" refers to the part of a lobster trap in which, if there are more than two lobsters in there, can cause the others to be injured or killed.  The symbolism continues in the beginning of the movie, in which the dad describes an older, female lobster (carrying ""berries"" or young) as aggressive and, in his words, ""can take out two males easy.""  This becomes important, as you see in the story, in that the mother harbors tremendous bitterness, wanting to avenge her son's death, and is instrumental in convincing her husband, ultimately, to make a decision that may prove to be the couple's undoing.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 2]","Director Todd Field helped adapt Andre Dubus' story for the screenplay of ""In the Bedroom"" and by the end of the film I knew I had been in the company of master film craftsmen.Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek play Matt and Ruth Fowler.  Matt is the community physician in the small Maine lobstering community of Camden.  Nick Stahl plays their only son, Frank, who is preparing for graduate school and would still look at place in high school.  Frank is having a running-through-flowered-meadows romance with Marisa Tomei as Natalie Strout.Natalie is noticeably older than Frank and comes not only with two young boys, but also the baggage of Richard, a belligerent ex-husband played with seething menace by William Mapother, whose work I knew best from television in shows from Lost to CSI.Ruth wants Frank to concentrate on his education and can hardly restrain her disapproval at his relationship with Natalie.  Her up and coming son doesn't need an attachment to an older divorcee with two children, and the perceptive Ruth understands that her husband likes having juicy Natalie around better than he understands it himself.  Matt knows Ruth is correct - Frank should be concentrating on more permanent things than what appears a summer fling - but he doesn't want to interfere in his grown son's fun, and he thinks Ruth has too often interfered with their son's fun in the past.A different movie may have focused on the ex-husband and his threats to Natalie and her new young lover.  By instead focusing on the pillar-of-the-community Fowler family it is more jarring when tragedy strikes, and it leaves us more emotionally raw and primed for what happens in the closing act.In tone I found the first half of the movie similar to Moonlight Mile, with Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and Jake Gyllenhaal, but the final sequence of this film enters territory I didn't expect for these characters.

703485,A152C8GYY25HAH,B000067J3S,Matthew Horner,"[4, 4]","""In the Bedroom"" is certainly one of 2001's best movies. It has five great performances, three of which were nominated for Oscars. The script is one of those fine ones in which interesting events are happening on the surface, while even more intriguing ones are going on underneath. Like many movies with great meaning, though, it is not what most people consider entertainment. And I have to admit that this opinion has merit. After all, the terms `meaningful' and `entertaining' are, in many ways, polar opposites. ""In the Bedroom"" is for viewers who, on occasion at least, enjoy a movie that provokes them and causes them to think.Ruth and Matt Fowler [Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson] live in a small town on the coast of Maine. He's the town doctor, and she's the music teacher at the local high school. In such a place, they are at the top of the social ladder. Their son, Frank [Nick Stahl], is spending the summer at home before going off to graduate school in the fall. He is having an affair with an older woman, Natalie [Marisa Tomei], who has a couple of kids and is in the process of divorcing her rich-kid husband, Richard [William Mapother]. It's anything but an amicable divorce. This fact gives the seeming idyllic love affair an ominous undercurrent, to which Frank seems oblivious.Ruth objects to the affair for her own reasons. Though Frank insists it's just a summer affair, she senses that her son is in love. She feels that the relationship will jeopardize his future. Matt is supportive of his son for several reasons. He is living vicariously through Frank. More importantly, his relationship with Ruth exists as a shell of what it once was. They don't really like each other anymore and have taken to disagreeing just to disagree. Matt may support his son just because Ruth doesn't. It's a stance he will live to regret.It's hard to believe that this is director Todd Field's first movie. Prior to this, he was just a relatively successful character actor.The cast is much better known. Nick Stahl has been acting since he was a small child, although this is easily his most important role. Tom Wilkinson is a very famous character actor in his native England. Sissy Spacek was once a major star. Her Best Actress Oscar was for ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" twenty years ago, and she was nominated four other times between 1977 and 1987. As roles in movies dwindled, she went off and raised a family. She also did a few small movie roles and several TV movies, but I think it's still fair to call ""In the Bedroom"" her comeback. It's her best performance in a long and distinguished career. I hope she's back to stay.Though some of us like to believe that `it can't happen here', we all know that bad things can and do happen everywhere. This fact is part of what makes ""In the Bedroom"" so disturbing. The Fowlers are such decent, ordinary people living in such a beautiful and peaceful New England town. The horrible event that wrecks their lives is particularly overwhelming to them because nothing in their lives could prepare them for it. The movie reminds us that good and bad are relative terms. It's easy to be a `good' person as long as nothing happens to compel us to become `bad'.",5,"Intelligent, emotionally-charged drama",1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,3208,"['Bedroom', 'certainly', 'one', '2001', 'best', 'movies', 'five', 'great', 'performances', 'three', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'script', 'one', 'fine', 'ones', 'interesting', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'surface', 'even', 'more', 'intriguing', 'ones', 'are', 'going', 'underneath', 'many', 'movies', 'great', 'meaning', 'though', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'consider', 'entertainment', 'have', 'admit', 'opinion', 'merit', 'terms', 'meaningful', 'entertaining', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'polar', 'opposites', 'Bedroom', 'viewers', 'who', 'occasion', 'least', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'think.Ruth', 'Matt', 'Fowler', '[', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', ']', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'coast', 'Maine', 'town', 'doctor', 'music', 'teacher', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'such', 'place', 'are', 'top', 'social', 'ladder', 'son', 'Frank', '[', 'Nick', 'Stahl', ']', 'spending', 'summer', 'home', 'going', 'off', 'graduate', 'school', 'fall', 'having', 'affair', 'older', 'woman', 'Natalie', '[', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', ']', 'who', 'couple', 'kids', 'process', 'divorcing', 'rich-kid', 'husband', 'Richard', '[', 'William', 'Mapother', ']', 'anything', 'amicable', 'divorce', 'fact', 'seeming', 'idyllic', 'love', 'affair', 'ominous', 'undercurrent', 'Frank', 'oblivious.Ruth', 'objects', 'affair', 'own', 'reasons', 'Frank', 'just', 'summer', 'affair', 'son', 'love', 'relationship', 'will', 'jeopardize', 'future', 'Matt', 'supportive', 'son', 'several', 'reasons', 'living', 'vicariously', 'Frank', 'More', 'importantly', 'relationship', 'Ruth', 'shell', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'other', 'anymore', 'have', 'taken', 'disagreeing', 'just', 'disagree', 'Matt', 'may', 'support', 'son', 'just', 'Ruth', ""n't"", 'stance', 'will', 'live', 'regret.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'director', 'Todd', 'Field', 'first', 'movie', 'Prior', 'was', 'just', 'relatively', 'successful', 'character', 'actor.The', 'cast', 'much', 'better', 'known', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'been', 'acting', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'easily', 'most', 'important', 'role', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'very', 'famous', 'character', 'actor', 'native', 'England', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'was', 'once', 'major', 'star', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'was', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'nominated', 'four', 'other', 'times', '1977', '1987', 'roles', 'movies', 'dwindled', 'went', 'off', 'raised', 'family', 'also', 'did', 'few', 'small', 'movie', 'roles', 'several', 'TV', 'movies', 'think', 'still', 'fair', 'call', 'Bedroom', 'comeback', 'best', 'performance', 'long', 'distinguished', 'career', 'hope', 'back', 'stay.Though', 'believe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'know', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'happen', 'everywhere', 'fact', 'part', 'what', 'Bedroom', 'so', 'disturbing', 'Fowlers', 'are', 'such', 'decent', 'ordinary', 'people', 'living', 'such', 'beautiful', 'peaceful', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'horrible', 'event', 'lives', 'particularly', 'overwhelming', 'nothing', 'lives', 'could', 'prepare', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'are', 'relative', 'terms', 'easy', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'as', 'long', 'nothing', 'compel', 'become', 'bad']",In the Bedroom

703488,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000067J3S,Michael Butts,"[3, 3]","You don't get much better acting than what you get from Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson in this powerful, tragic, yet flawed movie. Director Todd Field uses silences brilliantly; common scenes of normal activities shading the shadow of guilt and agony.Tom Wilkinson plays Dr. Matt Fowler, a likeable, down to earth physician who takes his lunch every day just to visit his son at his job catching lobsters. Sissy Spacek plays Ruth, his wife, a seemingly judgmental and even bitter woman, who doesn't approve of her son's relationship with an older, estranged woman and her two sons. Nick Stahl is Frank, the son, whose blooming maturity inhibits him from following his heart and telling the truth. He can't seem to admit that his relationship with Natalie is anything more than a summer fling.The movie takes a violent and tragic turn, and the results are devastating for the three remaining characters. Marisa Tomei is Natalie, afraid to face her husband's wrath or do anything about it.The movie has many, many powerful and gut-wrenching moments. The acting is superb. Wilkinson who really has the most screen time plays the father with such restraint, warmth and compassion that you feel like he IS Matt Walker. He is matched by Sissy Spacek's most powerful performance. Spacek uses her body, her eyes, her speeches to convey the anger and guilt she feels and refusing to get on with her life. Tomei gives her best performance as Natalie, a &quot;good&quot; woman, caught in the trap of loving someone so much younger, and wanting to be forgiven in her role in Frank's death. This performance validates the surprise Oscar she won for My Cousin Vinny. William Mapother as Natalie's estranged husband oozes deception, self-serving and empty individual, feeling no remorse for his deed. Celia Weston who plays Katie, the wife of one of the Fowler's friends, is memorable in a scene in which she and Ruth are going through Katie's family album, and she slips with an unintentionally hurtful remark. Lots of power between these two men.So where does this movie go wrong? It's MACBETH like ending seems so unreal compared to the rest of the movie.

All the better to lull the audience until the time when he starts detonating bombs under their seats. Unlike the two aforementioned films, which depict tasteful, Waspy types dealing with the aftermath of tragedy, ""In the Bedroom"" exposes the raw nerve endings that are revealed, in all their bloody glory, during and just after an unspeakable and unexpected tragedy. Furthermore, its ending--though shot in the same low-key way as the rest of the film-- is anything but quiet and tasteful, leaving audiences with a Pandora's box full of disturbing questions. Adding immeasurably to the film's impact are the performances, so honest and forthright that they break our hearts. As the parents of the victim, Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are mesmerizing in their raw, desolate grief. The scene in which they start blaming each other for the tragedy is a high-water mark for acting in an American movie. Nick Stahl, naive and innocent as a golden retriever puppy, is almost unbearably poignant as their son, and Marisa Tomei is superb as the vulnerable, confused young mother with whom Stahl has a romantic fling. Capping the ensemble is William Mapother, unforgettable as the ultimate conscienceless creep, all the more frightening for being--at least outwardly--a normal, everyday kind of guy.

If I could give half stars here I would it give 3 and a bit. It is better than most 3 star movies for it type but not really a four and certainly not a 5 if you know your movies and have seen these actors elsewhere or films with the exact same theme.The film has a lot of plus points. It has some really good moments in the story and some interesting character direction but ultimately does not really justify itself by the time the credits roll and in terms of atonement and resolve (the two central themes in this film) then that is not good because there is a lot of loose ends here. Also the actual forensic work (or lack of it) behind the murder that takes place in this film is a little lacking. Basically it sort of says that if you shoot someone and no one sees you do it, but you get caught anyway, then you will likely only be done for manslaughter which does stretch things a bit for a film that tries its hardest to be a realistic drama.The acting is on top form though and that is really why you should watch this film. There are many flashes or anger, repression and pain throughout the story that are sometimes subtle and sometimes very strong. It is all good there and it has lots going for it in that department.

Unfortunately, the movie goes into a weird direction.  Instead of being a movie about two very loving parents struggling to accept their son's choice, it becomes a movie about two parents struggling after their son's bizarre death.Not only is the plot farfetched and at times embarrassingly cheesy but the acting gets worse and worse as the movie progresses.Marisa Tomei is great as a single mom but Sissy Spasek is horrible as a cold and unforgiving mother and wife. The movie is also extremely misogynistic - it seems that all the negative action is driven by women.  The morale of the story seems that mothers especially single mothers are dangerous. There is even a metaphor comparing single mothers to female lobsters.""In the Bedroom"" is clearly intended to be as realistic as possible.

703499,A5KA6OYVIZFJL,B000067J3S,Philippe Ranger,"[5, 15]","Minority opinion. Why is this a TV viewers' movie? Because every shot says one thing, says it clearly, and says nothing else if it can avoid it. It's as if each scene were drawn in crayon. A TV image has less detail than a 3-cent stamp, so its only duty is to get the message out. The sound matches, so its duty is to be good and clear, and forget realism. Audience attention is shared with the Twinkies, the dog and Debbie Sue who's always on the phone. So, let's not try to walk and chew gum at the same time.By contrast, a film is meant for an audience of people who give it their full attention, who can scan the whole screen while each scene runs and generate their own feelings according to their own experience, who can react to minor elements in the sound as they would in real life, and who can likewise take in characters onscreen the way they take in living people.In The Bedroom is built from shots where you can't feel where you are, how old things are, how's the light, what's the time of day, how warm it is - unless that's the purpose of the shot. The acting is delivered with accents that are pure North Hollywood, not northern Maine, and the diction is always good and clear. There is no sound except what you're meant to notice, no atmosphere. Instead, there is double-underline music where ""appropriate"".Worst of all is the acting and direction. Almost everything is played walk-on style, as in As The World Turns. You mostly don't feel that the characters were doing something before the shot, that they will go on doing it after the shot or that they do what they do during the shot from their own inclination, not because they're paid to keep to the script. Of all the cast, Sissy Spacek gets my nomination for Best Leading Dead Fish, providing a perfect illustration of ""going through the motions"".By contrast, the Bad Guy, William Mapother, manages to transcend both the direction and the script. You *feel* that, yes, his character is acting from his own inclination, has been doing it for years and will go on the same way once the shot is over. Playing his ex-wife, Marisa Tomei puts in a valiant effort too. Playing her lover, Nick Stahl perhaps tries hard too, but he's swamped by the Dick-and-Jane script and framing he's handed.As for the story - pure tribalism. Establish Fifth Commandment Transgression scene by stagy scene in first part. Reach First Second Amendment Rite (Bad Guy shoots Young Good Guy dead). Muddle through second part (Bad Guy goes out on bail and moves to another town). Reach Second Second Amendment Rite (Old Good Guy Stand-in for Average Joe shoots Bad Guy very dead). (Less than one ten-thousandth of the US gun deaths that year, in case you wonder.) Real men, almost up to NYPD Blue standards.What about a counter-example?

703500,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B000067J3S,Ping Lim,"[2, 5]","This movie is two hours in length and feels it.  It's very slow moving depicting the lives of ordinary folks in Maine.  Perhaps the Director deliberately makes the pace slower to depict the nature of Maine.  Wilkinson (a doctor) and Spacek (music director) are one of those good doers family with a son (studying to be an architect) heading back for summer.  Stahl (the son) is involved with a single mother of two in the form of Tomei.  Her previous marriage with the ex-husband (separated but not divorced) is estranged and that causes tension between the three parties that are involved.  Then, everything comes to a blow and tragedy strikes.  Akin to Mystic River, whilst everybody is adjusting to the tragedy and yearn to move on with their lives, underneath the tranquility, there's a boiling rage to avenge, an eye for an eye.  In one of the scenes, whilst playing poker with friends, one of them commented that it's the quiet one that's lethal.  That statement resonates through the rest of the movie.  Whilst some are pointing fingers and this person and that, whilst some are at loss for words and wondered why something like this would have happened, some are plotting to do what they deem is necessary to square off things.  Once again, we are led to yet another unexpected and tragic ending.  I have to say that I'm emotionally drained after the movie.  If you are looking for a deep and thought provoking movie, this is the one for you.  It doesn't get five Oscar nominations for no reasons.

He did an EXCELLENT job as the father fully convincing for me, Sissy's performance was good too, but I have to say I think Halle did deserve the Oscar between the 2, Marisa Tomei didn't have that big of a role after a point in the movie but what scenes she was in was pretty, but nothing PROFOUND.This movie had the writing on the wall from the very beginning you knew it was not going to be some uplifting tale. The atmosphere and setting was PERFECT.. Maine was beautiful, calm and peaceful to set the tone of a lifestyle that this young man had grown up in. A Father (who is the town Doctor)that loved him and a Mother (who was the local high school music teacher) both seeming to be understanding that there son was involved with a Older woman with 2 children, although it is evident that Sissy Spacek does not approve of this relationship.I never really did understand if Marisa was divorced already or in the process of one with her (ex?)husband. I don't want to go into to much detail on the plot because I sometimes think you enjoy a movie more when you don't know WHAT to expect. The grieving in this movie is intense and very real, the frustrations are tangible. The Director did a INCREDIBLE job with letting you feel the emotions to EVERYONE in this movie not just the principal people I mean I KNEW how the friends felt, the nurse at the Doctors office I think that everyone did such a great job in this movie that it rates right up there with some of the best I've ever seen.Beware it does get to a point where it slows down but don't give up on it, you never really know just how much time passes between the death and the end of the movie, but by the time the credits roll it all fits in very well.Respectfully Reviewed",5,WOW!

Some are because they are touching, beautiful films done with a stroke from a true artist. And some are great just because they seem so real. The latter is what makes In the Bedroom so great.In this film dealing with young love, jealous husbands, and parents love for their child, it's the little moments that define it. In a scene where the parents are listening to bad news from their lawyer, the dad isn't looking at him. Instead he's focused on nick-nacks and pictures of the lawyer's family. This is what real people do! A middle-aged woman, a friend of the family, speaks with ""ums"" and doesn't always use words perfectly, just like a lot of real people do! The story is nothing new, the situation told countless times in other films. But here, there is a new spark of life, a spark of reality, which makes this film so enjoyable.All the actors fit into their roles perfectly. Marissa Tormei in another Oscar-nominated performance is great along with the family portrayal of Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson and Nick Stahl.A warning for those needing a fast paced film. This isn't for you. It takes its time, like things do in the real world. We need more films like this that are not afraid to take it's time in telling the story.

703504,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000067J3S,Reviewer,"[2, 3]","An emotionally devastating film that points up just how fragile life really is, and the facility with which one's universe can be turned upside down veritably in the blink of an eye, ""In the Bedroom,"" directed by Todd Field, is an incisive examination of the irreparable psychological damage left in the wake of a tragic event which, in a perfect world, never would have happened.  And it drives home the fact that this is not a perfect world, but a very flawed world in which crime-- especially a crime of passion-- is more than just an existential concept to be pondered, but a very real part of a very real and imperfect world.  It's a discourse on the unthinkable; a meditation on that single moment you so desperately want back in order to change what otherwise will be forevermore irreversible, and finally on the acceptance of a reality that in the end, is unacceptable.  It's a film that explores the parameters of endurance, and seeks an answer to a question for which there is none; in it's place we find a paradox of the human condition, wherein lies a tenet irrefutably conducive to matters of the heart, and beyond any resolution of the intellect.For Ruth and Matt Fowler (Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson) life is good; they have a comfortable home in a small town in Maine, where she teaches and he has a successful medical practice.  Frank (Nick Stahl), their only child, is working part time as a lobster fisherman, while preparing for college in the fall.  But first, there's a long, hot summer to embrace, and Frank has become involved with an ""older"" woman, Natalie (Marisa Tomei), the mother of two young boys.  And though they are separated, Natalie is not yet divorced from her estranged husband, Richard (William Mapother), which makes for a rather tentative state of affairs-- especially in light of the fact that Richard wants Natalie and his boys back.For Ruth, her son's involvement with a married woman has become something of a bone of contention, and rightly so; there's a reason that Natalie is no longer with her husband.  Add to that the fact that Ruth is afraid that Frank's infatuation with Natalie may derail his plans for college, and her concerns seem entirely valid.  Matt, however, though concerned about the situation as well, feels Ruth is being overly cautious on Frank's behalf.  His attitude quickly changes, though, when subsequent events transpire that not only vindicate Ruth's worst fears, but take them all past a point of no return.  And for the Fowlers, life will never again be the same.Todd Field co-wrote this Oscar nominated screenplay with Robert Festinger (adapted from the story by Andre Dubus), and he goes on to deliver a pensive film that is visually poetic and altogether involving.  In the opening frames, Field establishes an idyllic setting against which he proceeds to unleash a story through which, emotionally, he achieves Everest.  Setting a deliberate pace, he subtly explores each phase through which all of those involved must pass following the tragedy, with special focus on Ruth and Matt  And it's a study that goes well beyond the typical rendering of a ""seeking justice in an unjust world"" drama.  In this one, nothing is in black and white; instead, it is gray areas that prevail.  Field sifts through the emotional wreckage of the those involved, contemplating the effects of the event and the psychological implications manifested in each individual's response to it.  He demonstrates a keen insight into human nature, acutely capturing the confusion and that sense of disorientation, that feeling of ""What do I do next?"" desperation suffered by Ruth and Matt, and how it affects their relationship with one another.  Again, Field finds pronounced shades of gray in the very different ways in which the couple copes with and attempts to resolve their own inner conflict and rage, and the lack of communion it engenders between the them.  From the very beginning, he taps into and then maintains that kind of disconcerting tension one feels in the face of uncertainty; that fury born of the inability to resolve that which absolutely must be resolved before one can move on.  It's a matter of attaining closure, and Field clearly indicates how elusive that can be, and the depths to which one must descend in order to find it.As Ruth, Sissy Spacek gives a memorable performance for which she was deservedly nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  As embodied by Spacek, Ruth is a quietly confident and obviously domineering presence; a mother who, without question, wants only the best for her son.  As the drama unfolds, Spacek delivers a portrayal steeped in ever-deepening introspection, wherein the anger for which she so desperately needs an outlet is contained and controlled.  And you can feel that inner turmoil coming off of her in waves, even as she attempts to mask it by affecting an aloof manner.  It's a convincing performance, extremely honest and real; one to which many in the audience are going to be able to connect and identify.Tom Wilkinson was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor-- and deservedly so, as this is arguably the best performance of his career-- for his portrayal of Matt.  There is such a ring of truth in the way he conveys a ""non-acceptant"" acceptance as he seeks the resolution he so desperately needs, for himself as well as Ruth.  It's a moving performance, and like Spacek's, one to which many are going to be able to relate.Also turning in an exceptional performance (also nominated for an Oscar) is Marisa Tomei.  Even with less screen time, she effectively holds her own with Spacek and Wilkinson.  Personal experience and frame of reference are going to have a lot to do with how ""In the Bedroom"" is received; but on one level or another, it is going to provide a riveting emotional experience for anyone who sees it.",5,Rings With Honesty and Emotion,1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,5847,"['emotionally', 'devastating', 'film', 'up', 'just', 'how', 'fragile', 'life', 'really', 'facility',

Todd Field directs his first film outstandingly and gets amazing Oscar nominated performances from Spacek, Wilkinson, and Tomei.Nick Stahl plays 21 year old Frank involved with Natalie (Tomei), a soon-to-be divorced mother of 2 boys, with a quick tempered husband.  The summer is going by with barbecues and children playing and seagulls calling.  Then tragedy strikes and everyone's world is turned upside down.  As mother (Spacek) and father (Wilkinson) are left wondering what happened and what to do next, you see them turn away from each other and the lives they knew.  But just as things are beginning to come together for them, Field shifts the picture and you find yourself watching as the mood changes and things change pace until the final climax ending.Field's cinematograpy was excellent, bringing music and image together perfectly.  Some scenes were shot in such unusual ways--reflections, odd angles, time lapse.  Also his choice of additional actors was superb as they brought the genuine feel of Camden, Maine to the screen.I would highly recommend this Oscar nominated picture for it's intense drama and incredible acting.",5,Oscar nominated.....now I know why!,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1201,"['Well', 'deserved', 'nominated', 'film', 'Bedroom', 'blew', 'away', 'Todd', 'Field', 'first', 'film', 'outstandingly', 'amazing', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performances', 'Spacek', 'Wilkinson', 'Tomei.Nick', 'Stahl', '21', 'year', 'old', 'Frank', 'involved', 'Natalie', 'Tomei', 'soon-to-be', 'divorced', 'mother', '2', 'boys', 'quick', 'tempered', 'husband', 'summer', 'going', 'barbecues', 'children', 'playing', 'seagulls', 'calling', 'Then', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'everyone', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'mother', 'Spacek', 'father', 'Wilkinson', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'see', 'turn', 'away', 'other', 'lives', 'knew', 'just', 'things', 'are', 'beginning', 'come', 'together', 'Field', 'shifts', 'picture', 'find', 'watching', 'mood', 'changes', 'things', 'change', 'pace', 'final', 'climax', 'ending.Field', 'cinematograpy', 'was', 'excellent', 'bringing', 'music', 'image', 'together', 'perfectly', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'such', 'unusual', 'ways', 'reflections', 'odd', 'angles', 'time', 'lapse', 'Also', 'choice', 'additional', 'actors', 'was', 'superb', 'brought', 'genuine', 'feel', 'Camden', 'Maine', 'screen.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'picture', 'intense', 'drama', 'incredible', 'acting']",In the Bedroom
703506,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000067J3S,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","A difficult movie, but WELL worth the effort.  I'm surprised at some of the less than rave reviews here.This is a movie that is unflinchingly unpredictable.  Everyone is totally believable, but you never have any idea what a character is going to do next.  It's richly written, with beautiful texture and pacing (the pacing is slow, but it's like slow boil...stuff IS happening).  And the plot is familiar at one moment and totally unique the next.The first ""act"" deals with introducing us to loving couple Sissy Spacke and Tom Wilkerson (although we can tell that many years together has led to a small dose of ""familiarity breeds contempt""...this couple is believably ""non-intimate"" like many long-termed married couples are...they fight, they give each other looks and yet we know they are committed to each other).  Their son, Nich Stahl, a young man barely out of high school, is engaged in an affair with an ""older"" woman (Marisa Tomei). When her estranged husband finds out, tragedy ensues.The second ""act"" shows how the loss of their son, particularly to  violence, leads to feelings of helplessness, remorse, hatred, desire for revenge, and most of all, a near total emtional estrangement between the couple.  We aren't just dealing with a generic ""grief"" as we have seen in countless TV-movies.  This movie dares to show how these two likeable people are ravaged by their loss.  RAVAGED.  Whew, it's some tough, emotional stuff, but so believably presented as to be thrilling at the same time.  Near the end of this act, there is a scene where the couple nearly come to blows and start spewing out their accusations with the kinds of words and insults that you can't take back...you know the kind.  How this spell is broken is an absolutely amazing, surprising and REAL scene.  Not with theatrical gestures and grandoise speeches, but with the arrival of a little girl selling candy for a fundraiser.  Don't ask...just watch and be totally moved.Act Three is vengeance.  Many have argued that this act pulls the movie out of reality and into ""Hollywood"" or at least into another genre of film.  Yet is it really such a stretch that the couple would find new unity through their desire for revenge.  And how much, really, if YOU were the parent of a murdered child, would it take to send you in thirst for revenge.  And again, the movie doesn't take an easy, predictable road down this act either.The acting is uniformly OUTSTANDING.  Sissy Spacek, a much admired actress who has always frankly left me just a little cold, is GREAT.  She allows herself to sink into her despair, yet remain cold and tightly wound.  She has a scene with Tomei that is startlingly in its actions and emotional rawness.  She is vulnerable, in all senses of that word for an actress.  Speaking of vulnerable, the much-maligned Marisa Tomei is riveting.  I've always hated that she caught so much grief after winning her Oscar for MY COUSIN VINNY.  You know what...she's a pretty darn good actress.  She has a vulnerable quality that just shines from her.  She's BELIEVABLY sweet and sexy, and in IN THE BEDROOM, she is stripped raw too, with guilt and sadness.But the truly revelatory performance comes from Tom Wilkerson, most famous before this for THE FULL MONTY.  He is at once stubborn, tender, funny, loving, tough, whimpy, sad, determined, intelligent, emotional.  He juggles all his emotions and all his character's transitions with TOTAL control and believability. Denzel Washington won the Oscar for TRAINING DAY...Russell Crowe was heavily favored by some for A BEAUTIFUL MIND, but it was Wilkerson who really gave the most astonishing performance of the year.All the characters were presented as people we might know...really know.  Thus, their draining emotional journeys can be empathized with.  It's a bleak and beautiful movie and one I can't recommend highly enough for an adult audience.",5,"BEAUTIFUL, EMOTIONAL, RAW and GRIPPING!!!",1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,3893,"['difficult', 'movie', 'WELL', 'effort', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'less', 'rave', 'reviews', 'movie', 'unflinchingly', 'unpredictable', 'Everyone', 'totally', 'believable', 'never', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'character', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'richly', 'written', 'beautiful', 'texture', 'pacing', 'pacing', 'slow', 'slow', 'boil', 'stuff', 'IS', 'happening', 'plot', 'familiar', 'one', 'moment', 'totally', 'unique', 'next.The', 'first', 'act', 'deals', 'introducing', 'loving', 'couple', 'Sissy', 'Spacke', 'Tom', 'Wilkerson', 'can', 'tell', 'many', 'years', 'together', 'led', 'small', 'dose', 'familiarity', 'breeds', 'contempt', 'couple', 'believably', 'non-intimate', 'many', 'long-termed', 'married', 'couples', 'are', 'fight', 'give', 'other', 'looks', 'yet', 'know', 'are', 'committed', 'other', 'son', 'Nich', 'Stahl', 'young', 'man', 'barely', 'high', 'school', 'engaged', 'affair', 'older', 'woman', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'When', 'estranged', 'husband', 'out', 'ensues.The', 'second', 'act', 'how', 'loss', 'son', 'particularly', 'violence', 'feelings', 'helplessness', 'remorse', 'hatred', 'desire', 'revenge', 'most', 'near', 'total', 'emtional', 'estrangement', 'couple', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'dealing', 'generic', 'grief', 'have', 'seen', 'countless', 'TV-movies', 'movie', 'show', 'how', 'two', 'likeable', 'people', 'are', 'ravaged', 'loss', 'RAVAGED', 'Whew', 'tough', 'emotional', 'stuff', 'so', 'believably', 'presented', 'be', 'thrilling', 'same', 'time', 'end', 'act', 'scene', 'where', 'couple', 'nearly', 'come', 'blows', 'start', 'spewing', 'out', 'accusations', 'kinds', 'words', 'insults', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', 'know', 'kind', 'How', 'spell', 'broken', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'surprising', 'REAL', 'scene', 'Not', 'theatrical', 'gestures', 'grandoise', 'speeches', 'arrival', 'little', 'girl', 'selling', 'candy', 'fundraiser', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'just', 'watch', 'be', 'totally', 'moved.Act', 'Three', 'vengeance', 'Many', 'have', 'argued', 'act', 'movie', 'reality', 'Hollywood', 'least', 'genre', 'film', 'really', 'such', 'stretch', 'couple', 'would', 'find', 'new', 'unity', 'desire', 'revenge', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'YOU', 'were', 'parent', 'murdered', 'child', 'would', 'take', 'send', 'thirst', 'revenge', 'again', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'predictable', 'road', 'down', 'act', 'either.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'OUTSTANDING', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'much', 'admired', 'actress', 'who', 'always', 'frankly', 'left', 'just', 'little', 'cold', 'GREAT', 'sink', 'despair', 'yet', 'remain', 'cold', 'tightly', 'wound', 'scene', 'Tomei', 'startlingly', 'actions', 'emotional', 'rawness', 'vulnerable', 'senses', 'word', 'actress', 'Speaking', 'vulnerable', 'much-maligned', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'riveting', ""'ve"", 'always', 'hated', 'caught', 'so', 'much', 'grief', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'MY', 'COUSIN', 'VINNY', 'know', 'what', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'actress', 'vulnerable', 'quality', 'just', 'shines', 'BELIEVABLY', 'sweet', 'sexy', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', 'stripped', 'raw', 'too', 'guilt', 'sadness.But', 'truly', 'revelatory', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Wilkerson', 'most', 'famous', 'THE', 'FULL', 'MONTY', 'once', 'stubborn', 'tender', 'funny', 'loving', 'tough', 'whimpy', 'sad', 'determined', 'intelligent', 'emotional', 'emotions', 'character', 'transitions', 'TOTAL', 'control', 'believability', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'won', 'Oscar', 'TRAINING', 'DAY', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'heavily', 'favored', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MIND', 'was', 'Wilkerson', 'who', 'really', 'gave', 'most', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'year.All', 'characters', 'were', 'presented', 'people', 'might', 'know', 'really', 'know', 'Thus', 'draining', 'emotional', 'journeys', 'can', 'be', 'empathized', 'bleak', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'adult', 'audience']",In the Bedroom

There are many levels at which this can be viewed:  as a comment on our criminal justice system and vengance, the evolution of long-term and durable marriages, or the upheavals of unwilling divorce.  For me, it was the older marriage that was the emotional center of this movie, the anchor of all the themes.Watching this is difficult as it addresses many of our ultimate fears as parents.

703509,AGSWTH7SP2256,B000067J3S,R. W. Rasband,"[1, 1]","2001 was a banner year for film noir, with ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", ""Mulholland Dr."", ""Memento"", and Richard Dutcher's ""Brigham City."" Add to these Todd Field's ""In The Bedroom"" which I finally saw this week. It's a meticulously constructed, suspenseful film where every line of dialog and shot has significance. It concerns Sissy Spacek (who pulls off a tricky performance that may get her another Oscar), an upper-middle-class woman whose promising college age son becomes involved with a working-class older woman (Marisa Tomei) with a couple of young kids and a glowering soon-to-be ex-husband. There are some surprises to be had, including a screeching big one right in the middle of the movie which I shall not reveal (although many critics ignorantly have.) Suffice it to say that the moral fault (or responsibility) is not where you initially think it is. The film is based on a short story by Andre Dubus, an explicitly Catholic writer. At one point in the film a priest offers a vision of faith as as healing and redemptive force (which is sadly not accepted). The movie is ultimately about the absolute necessity of faith and forgiveness for spiritual survival in the face of the most extreme, murderous human situations. Think of it as a Catholic companion to Dutcher's ""Brigham City.""",5,In The Trap,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1300,"['2001', 'was', 'banner', 'year', 'film', 'noir', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'Memento', 'Richard', 'Dutcher', 'Brigham', 'City', 'Add', 'Todd', 'Field', 'Bedroom', 'finally', 'saw', 'week', 'meticulously', 'constructed', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'where', 'line', 'dialog', 'shot', 'significance', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'who', 'off', 'tricky', 'performance', 'may', 'get', 'Oscar', 'upper-middle-class', 'woman', 'promising', 'college', 'age', 'son', 'involved', 'working-class', 'older', 'woman', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'couple', 'young', 'kids', 'glowering', 'soon-to-be', 'ex-husband', 'are', 'surprises', 'be', 'had', 'including', 'screeching', 'big', 'one', 'right', 'middle', 'movie', 'shall', 'not', 'reveal', 'many', 'critics', 'ignorantly', 'have', 'Suffice', 'say', 'moral', 'fault', 'responsibility', 'not', 'where', 'initially', 'think', 'film', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'explicitly', 'Catholic', 'writer', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'priest', 'vision', 'faith', 'healing', 'redemptive', 'force', 'sadly', 'not', 'accepted', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'absolute', 'necessity', 'faith', 'forgiveness', 'spiritual', 'survival', 'face', 'most', 'extreme', 'murderous', 'human', 'situations', 'Think', 'Catholic', 'companion', 'Dutcher', 'Brigham', 'City']",In the Bedroom

Todd Fields next move has to be as anticipated as Sam Mendes and even more so to those who lean more to the film as art theory. The story follows a middle class Noreastern family through the tragic murder of their only son and the onslaught of overwhelming emotions.The Wilkinsons are a very real family who are just out to live their lives which dosn't seem much to ask but then that's why the story is a tragedy.  The young son, Frank falls for a divorcee whos violent husband belongs to a prominent family in town and dosn't want to give her up.  Nobody in film here is trying to be a hero in any way and at best Frank is only trying to be noble but the situation does not end well and Fanks parents Ruth and Matt are thrust into what many consider the greatest tragedy of all, burying a child.  Matt (Tom Wilkinson) and Ruth (Sissy Spacek) deal with the situation as best they can which is awkwardly and in near violent spurts.

The attractions here are as un-Hollywood as one can get. It uses ,instead, the power of silent suggestion to evoke a response from the viewer. Each gesture, each look, each gaze displayed by the pricipal actors, is pregnant with meaning. I disagree with those who say that the film challenges your intellect. The performances, the cinamatography, the script, they are all geared towards eliciting an intuitive, not an intellectual response. The photography in this film is not often remarked upon, but I think each frame of the house interior is a perfectly composed picture of American domesticity. The visuals do not exist for their own sake; often they suggest emotional desolation and solitude. One particular technique simply blew me away: sometimes the screen fades into utter blackness, lasting just a little too long than is common in movies, which is a simple but effective way making us feel the emptiness the characters feel. The movie, then, is very much like a painting; it leaves a lot for your imagination, it suggests rather than shows, it demands complete attention.

The story begins with the love affair between a college student home for the summer, Frank, and his older, not-yet-divorced, mother of two girlfriend, Natalie.  Overshadowing their affair is the disapproval of Frank's parents and the violent jealousy of Natalie's husband.The affair comes to a tragic end when Natalie's husband shoot's Frank dead in a fit of jealous rage.  The film then switches to Frank's parents.  We witness how the loss of their child, especially in such a sudden, violent way, threatens to tear their marriage apart.  We see them struggling to come to terms, to blame each other, to not blame each other, to get justice for their son, and to try appearing normal the whole time.This movie is not a thriller or a romance.  In the Bedroom is pure, psychological drama.  The story progresses very slowly, but remains fully compelling.  The director's use of long pauses, silences, and hollow sound bring the characters and their emotion right to the viewers' face.  There is little background music.  Instead, the movie is filled with those loud, pregnant silences that seem to mark tragedy in all our lives.If you like old movies, you may enjoy this film.  If you enjoy superb acting and a total lack of gimmicky plot twists, you will love this film.  I certainly did.The only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars was that there was a total lack of extras on the DVD.

The film deals with how the parents of the young man disagree with this relationship, not because they are prejudiced with their son's dating an older woman, but because they worry about their child's safety with a mentally unbalanced ex husband lurking around. The plot goes into overdrive when something unfortunate happens as the characters become immersed with each other leaving the viewer speechless. The script and performances are flawless, especially by Spacek who plays the mother, and ""In The Bedroom"" is one of those films that makes the viewer question their own value system and prejudices when it comes to love that may be questionable at times.

The rest of the movie finds both parents struggling to move on, but the memories of their dead son haunt them at every turn.  Saying more will reveal spoilers which I won't mention. Spacek, Wilkinson, and Tomei give intense, career-best performances that richly deserved their Oscar nominations.  I was most impressed by Wilkinson, a British actor who reaches deeply into his New England role.  But the spotlight ultimately belongs to director Todd Field, who sucessfully directed the film which could have easily been a generic made-for-Lifetime TV movie.

I agree with another reviewer who said this course of action is not believable given what we know about that character.  What was an intense portrait of grief turns into a fairly rudimentary revenge drama.  The film didn't leave me with any burning questions regarding the morality of that act; it just kind of left me with a blank look on my face.I think the film is a promising debut for Todd Field, but not nearly worthy of the breathless hype and praise surrounding it.

More than a few people I told about this film said that they were not interested because it appears to be a revenge sort of film. The guy kills the son who is dating his ex-wife and then goes on a vendetta against the rest of the family. If this is also your opinion, after watching the ads, let me just say that the ads are a little misleading. Although there are elements of revenge within the film, ""In The Bedroom"" is one of the best films released in 2001.Matt and Ruth Fowler (Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek) are a middle-aged couple living in a small town in Massachusetts (I think). Their son, Frank, is back from college for the summer and working on his lobster boat. He also falls in love with Natalie Strout (Marisa Tomei), a divorced mom with two kids. Matt and Ruth are shaken a bit by their son's new lover, but they accept her, to a degree, when they see how much her son loves her. Richard Strout (William Mapother), the ex-husband, isn't taking too well to the break-up or the new lover and his violent tendencies increase.""In The Bedroom"", the first film directed by Todd Field (an actor who has appeared in various films, including ""Eyes Wide Shut""), is a quiet, accomplished, powerful film exploring the fabric of a family's life. Field thrusts us into the story very quickly. The first scene depicts Frank and Natalie running through a field. Then we watch them at a family picnic. My point is that the relationship has already begun and they have already developed a certain amount of history. Both of her kids are already attached to Frank. This is a highly effective way of quickly and abruptly thrusting us into the story, ramping up our involvement in their lives. As we realize that these characters are already ""together"" that forces us to have an investment in their relationship. Field also depicts certain things in a tableau form. Brief shots of various characters sitting quietly contemplating or moving woodenly through their day, communicate far more than a highly theatrical scene of someone yelling or screaming. This method of depicting certain things, and leaving other things to our imaginations, also helps to ground the film in realism. ""In The Bedroom"" is a remarkably accomplished first film and makes me anticipate his next film even more.Field's accomplished direction is further enhanced by the fine performances by his cast. Sissy Spacek creates one of the most memorable characters I have ever seen in a film. Her portrayal of Ruth, the mother, is mesmerizing. Throughout the first half of the film you get a sense of her deepening disquiet and wonder what, besides her disapproval of her son's relationship, might be lurking underneath. In the second half of the film, her anger makes itself known, but without the showy theatrics associated with many similar types of performances. For a leading role, Spacek remains quiet through many scenes, yet effectively communicates her feelings through her face and body language. I really believed she was in this marriage and Frank's mother and had a history with this family.Tom Wilkinson, probably best remembered for his role as General Cornwallis in ""The Patriot"", is equally remarkable as Matt Fowler. For the first half of the film, he quietly gives in to his son at every turn, and in fact, Frank turns to him when his mother disapproves. He has a medical practice, but leaves most days at lunch, to either fish with his son, or spend some time with him. He also brings a note of jealousy to the character, indicating that perhaps Matt is jealous of his son. In the second half of the film, his character makes many changes as well, but they are also believable and compelling.The supporting cast is equally memorable. Nick Stahl brings a refreshing sense of enthusiasm and bravery to the role of Frank. You really get a sense that Frank is in love with Natalie, cares for her kids and loves his life. As he made various decisions throughout the film, I found myself compelled to shout to him to do something different. Of course, I didn't, but the fact that I considered this proves the power of his performance. I have never really been a fan of Marisa Tomei, but her performance as Natalie is very strong and believable. Natalie is a woman that is trying to have a happy life, a strong life and an independent life. In the film, we get a sense that she has finally reached that point, except for the influence of her ex-husband. There is a scene between Natalie and Ruth that is fairly brief, but very memorable.""In The Bedroom"" is a great, memorable film containing some of the best performances of 2001.",4,One of 2001's Best Films,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4744,"['fairly', 'unusual', 'independent', 'film', 'be', 'victim', 'misleading', 'ad', 'campaign', 'Bedroom', 'may', 'be', 'such', 'rarity', 'More', 'few', 'people', 'told', 'film', 'said', 'were', 'not', 'interested', 'be', 'revenge', 'sort', 'film', 'guy', 'son', 'who', 'dating', 'ex-wife', 'then', 'vendetta', 'rest', 'family', 'also', 'opinion', 'watching', 'ads', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'ads', 'are', 'little', 'misleading', 'are', 'elements', 'revenge', 'film', 'Bedroom', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'released', '2001.Matt', 'Ruth', 'Fowler', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'are', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'Massachusetts', 'think', 'son', 'Frank', 'back', 'college', 'summer', 'working', 'lobster', 'boat', 'also', 'love', 'Natalie', 'Strout', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'divorced', 'mom', 'two', 'kids', 'Matt', 'Ruth', 'are', 'shaken', 'bit', 'son', 'new', 'lover', 'accept', 'degree', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'son', 'Richard', 'Strout', 'William', 'Mapother', 'ex-husband', ""n't"", 'taking', 'too', 'well', 'break-up', 'new', 'lover', 'violent', 'tendencies', 'increase', 'Bedroom', 'first', 'film', 'directed', 'Todd', 'Field', 'actor', 'who', 'appeared', 'various', 'films', 'including', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quiet', 'accomplished', 'powerful', 'film', 'exploring', 'fabric', 'family', 'life', 'Field', 'story', 'very', 'quickly', 'first', 'scene', 'depicts', 'Frank', 'Natalie', 'running', 'field', 'Then', 'watch', 'family', 'picnic', 'point', 'relationship', 'already', 'begun', 'have', 'already', 'developed', 'certain', 'amount', 'history', 'kids', 'are', 'already', 'attached', 'Frank', 'highly', 'effective', 'way', 'quickly', 'abruptly', 'thrusting', 'story', 'ramping', 'up', 'involvement', 'lives', 'realize', 'characters', 'are', 'already', 'together', 'have', 'investment', 'relationship', 'Field', 'also', 'certain', 'things', 'tableau', 'form', 'Brief', 'shots', 'various', 'characters', 'sitting', 'quietly', 'contemplating', 'moving', 'woodenly', 'day', 'communicate', 'far', 'more', 'highly', 'theatrical', 'scene', 'someone', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'method', 'depicting', 'certain', 'things', 'leaving', 'other', 'things', 'imaginations', 'also', 'ground', 'film', 'realism', 'Bedroom', 'remarkably', 'accomplished', 'first', 'film', 'anticipate', 'next', 'film', 'even', 'more.Field', 'accomplished', 'direction', 'further', 'enhanced', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Ruth', 'mother', 'mesmerizing', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'get', 'sense', 'deepening', 'disquiet', 'wonder', 'what', 'disapproval', 'son', 'relationship', 'might', 'be', 'lurking', 'underneath', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'anger', 'known', 'showy', 'theatrics', 'associated', 'many', 'similar', 'types', 'performances', 'leading', 'role', 'Spacek', 'quiet', 'many', 'scenes', 'yet', 'effectively', 'feelings', 'face', 'body', 'language', 'really', 'believed', 'was', 'marriage', 'Frank', 'mother', 'had', 'history', 'family.Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'General', 'Cornwallis', 'Patriot', 'equally', 'remarkable', 'Matt', 'Fowler', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'quietly', 'son', 'turn', 'fact', 'Frank', 'when', 'mother', 'disapproves', 'medical', 'practice', 'most', 'days', 'lunch', 'fish', 'son', 'spend', 'time', 'also', 'note', 'jealousy', 'character', 'indicating', 'perhaps', 'Matt', 'jealous', 'son', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'character', 'many', 'changes', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'also', 'believable', 'compelling.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'memorable', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'refreshing', 'sense', 'enthusiasm', 'bravery', 'role', 'Frank', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'Frank', 'love', 'Natalie', 'kids', 'life', 'made', 'various', 'decisions', 'film', 'found', 'compelled', 'shout', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'fact', 'considered', 'power', 'performance', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'fan', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'performance', 'Natalie', 'very', 'strong', 'believable', 'Natalie', 'woman', 'trying', 'have', 'happy', 'life', 'strong', 'life', 'independent', 'life', 'film', 'get', 'sense', 'finally', 'reached', 'point', 'influence', 'ex-husband', 'scene', 'Natalie', 'Ruth', 'fairly', 'brief', 'very', 'memorable', 'Bedroom', 'great', 'memorable', 'film', 'containing', 'best', 'performances', '2001']",In the Bedroom

703529,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000067J3S,Timothy Kearney,"[1, 1]","IN THE BEDROOM is a film about the parents of a college age son who have to cope with his death and the ways in which the death of their only child changes their lives completely. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are Ruth and Matt Fowler, a teacher and doctor respectively. The two reside in mid-coast Maine and have comfortable lives centered on their son and careers. Frank, their son, played by Nick Stahl, has what he calls a summer fling with Natalie Strout, a divorced mother of two sons played by Marisa Tomei.  Natalie loves Frank's innocence and the role he plays in her son's lives and we do get the sense that something serious may occur. Life changes when Richard Strout, played by William Mapother, returns to town. He claims to want to reunite with Natalie, but the motive stems more from jealousy than anything else. Frank is killed by Richard. The bulk of the film is the aftermath of the death as experienced by Ruth and Matt.When the film was released, critics applauded the performances of Spacek and Wilkinson, and viewers will see that the accolades are well earned. We do get a sense of the pain the two face, and we feel for them. The on location filming gives the film an authentic feel. Viewers who know Maine's mid-coast will see many familiar attractions in Rockport and Camden where the film takes place. Even the route numbers for the hidden Maine highways are also accurate. The only fault I found was with Marisa Tomei's ""Maine accent."" To me it sounded like a Brooklyn accent with dropped ""R"" sounds, but this is nitpicking and it by no means was a distraction. As a matter of fact I'm sure only a Boston born and Massachusetts raised would have noticed the accent.As some reviewers have noted, the film is not fast paced, which after reading the summary on the cover, may catch people by surprise. For me, this is not a drawback. The film is based on a story by writer Andre Dubus, a writer whose words should be savored and appreciated and the pace and length of this film allows viewers to savor and appreciate the moods and feelings of the characters.",4,A Troubling But Moving Film,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,2085,"['IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', 'film', 'parents', 'college', 'age', 'son', 'who', 'have', 'cope', 'death', 'ways', 'death', 'only', 'child', 'changes', 'lives', 'completely', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'are', 'Ruth', 'Matt', 'Fowler', 'teacher', 'doctor', 'respectively', 'two', 'reside', 'mid-coast', 'Maine', 'have', 'comfortable', 'lives', 'centered', 'son', 'careers', 'Frank', 'son', 'played', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'what', 'summer', 'fling', 'Natalie', 'Strout', 'divorced', 'mother', 'two', 'sons', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Natalie', 'Frank', 'innocence', 'role', 'son', 'lives', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'something', 'serious', 'may', 'occur', 'Life', 'changes', 'when', 'Richard', 'Strout', 'played', 'William', 'Mapother', 'town', 'want', 'reunite', 'Natalie', 'motive', 'more', 'jealousy', 'anything', 'else', 'Frank', 'killed', 'Richard', 'bulk', 'film', 'aftermath', 'death', 'experienced', 'Ruth', 'Matt.When', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'critics', 'applauded', 'performances', 'Spacek', 'Wilkinson', 'viewers', 'will', 'see', 'accolades', 'are', 'well', 'earned', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'pain', 'two', 'face', 'feel', 'location', 'filming', 'film', 'authentic', 'feel', 'Viewers', 'who', 'know', 'Maine', 'mid-coast', 'will', 'see', 'many', 'familiar', 'attractions', 'Rockport', 'Camden', 'where', 'film', 'place', 'Even', 'route', 'numbers', 'hidden', 'Maine', 'highways', 'are', 'also', 'accurate', 'only', 'fault', 'found', 'was', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Maine', 'accent', 'sounded', 'Brooklyn', 'accent', 'dropped', 'R', 'nitpicking', 'means', 'was', 'distraction', 'matter', 'fact', ""'m"", 'sure', 'only', 'Boston', 'born', 'Massachusetts', 'raised', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'accent.As', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'not', 'fast', 'paced', 'reading', 'summary', 'cover', 'may', 'catch', 'people', 'surprise', 'not', 'drawback', 'film', 'based', 'story', 'writer', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'writer', 'words', 'should', 'be', 'savored', 'appreciated', 'pace', 'length', 'film', 'viewers', 'savor', 'appreciate', 'moods', 'feelings', 'characters']",In the Bedroom

The movie takes place in three parts like a great Russian novel.  The first shows the everyday life of the family, how they interact with each other, and the growing love between Nick Stahl and a much older women, Marisa Tomei.  The second part deals with the family's loss and shows how one painful thing can lead to endless fights, arguments, and showdowns, specificly between Nick Stahl's parents (Brilliantlly played by Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek).  And the Third deals with revenge and many attempts to fill the void of loss.  First time Director Todd Fields has brought us a truly haunting story that shows how grief can turn into anger, anger can turn into hate, and hate can turn into revenge.  Besides being the best film of the year, it is also a showcase for great performances by Tom Wilkinson, Marisa Tomei, and especially Sissy Spacek who left me speechless and inspired for days after I saw this film.  As I brought up in my review of A Beautiful Mind, I felt Russel Crowe was the true Best Actor of the year and was very upset to see him not recieve the Academy Award.  The Same goes for Sissy Spacek in this film.  Her depiction of Ruth Fowler is nothing short of genuis.  She was by far the Best Actress of the year.

703531,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000067J3S,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","I hear some (but very few) complaint about this film, which made me write this one.  If you have a keen eye in picking up a good stuff, you will anyway see this masterpiece, but just in case I urge you very strongly to see ""In the Bedroom"" which deserves your money and time.The film is about ... what?  This is exactly the point the film challenges us.  It starts with a romance in one idyllic summer in Maine, full of bright sunshine and beautiful ocean.  Matt Fawler, a local doctor, and Ruth Fawler, a school teacher, are spending happy time with their son Frank, who is having a love affair with a beautiful wife Natalie (who lives with her son, practically separated with her husband).  It is just a summer thing, nothing serious, Frank thinks.  Though his father Matt shares the view with his son, his mother sees things differently, worrying about her son's behaviors.Then, a tragedy happens.  Richard, Natalie's abusing husband shows up, and during the fight between him and Frank, the latter is shot by Richard's handgun.  Frank's parents, living in deep grief, know that they are no longer able to live as the way they did, but cannot speak of the fact to each other.  Their wound eventually leads Matt to one decision that should rectify the past.  But will it?All about the film, the title says prominently: ""Bedroom"" means double ways, as ""trap"" (as in the beginning of the film, Matt explains to his son) and of course, literarily, a bedroom where the film ends.  It is the place no one can get out, nor make noise.  The Fowlers, trapped in this silent room, have to lacerate each other's hearts even before the tragic event happens, and the film, instead of telling their conditions loudly, quietly shows us their loneliness.  You hear often this expression, like, to ""read between the lines,"" but this film is just the instance that requires you to do that.And to make it possible, two leading actors Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek, true revelation of the film, practically become the tormented characters, displaying what these first-rate players can do at their best.  Also of note is Marissa Tomei, whose career is suffering from decline since her Oscar 10 years ago, as is shown in that terrible ""The Watcher.""  Todd Field may feel proud of extracting the best performance from those players, and he should be.The film has many virtues, but I only point out one of them, and finish my review.  The film intentionally skips some crucial parts -- the gunshot in case, for example -- and allows us to take multiple views on the events it describes.  The Fawlers are quite unsatisfied with the ""manslaughter"" verdict, which would be possibly given, and we are quite naturally take their view.  But the film cleverly refuses to show the crime scene itself, making the whole situation more unstable and uncomfortable.  After watching the film you might think, ""Are the Fawlers really right?""  Another instance is found in Ruth's claim, who says she sees Richard (who killed her son) hanging around her, torturing her, always and all over the small town.  But the film shows such scenes only once.  How should we take her words?  Or, how should we take the last words she says to her husband in the end of the film?  (This is a key place so I cannot disclose.  Just watch for yourself, and think.)""In the Bedroom"" is great because it succeeds in making us feel that there are a lot of things going on outside the film.  Without revealing too much, the film shows how an ""ordinary"" people commit something they should not do.  We read many reports on newspaper everyday, telling crimes that we think not so special.  But most probably, those crimes happen as the film depicts, involving many people's lives.  And this subtle touch is the greatest merit of ""In the Bedroom.""The film goes like ""Sling Blade,"" which has some common territory with ""In the Bedroom.""  They both move slowly, but with reality only the deft hands can make.  If you like this Billy Bob's masterpiece, you will also be fascinated with this one, a rewarding experience for fans of any truthful drama.",5,"Masterpiece: Like Still Water, This Realistic Film Runs Deep",1030406400,"08 27, 2002",2002,4086,"['hear', 'very', 'few', 'complaint', 'film', 'made', 'write', 'one', 'have', 'keen', 'eye', 'picking', 'up', 'good', 'stuff', 'will', 'anyway', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'case', 'urge', 'very', 'strongly', 'see', 'Bedroom', 'money', 'time.The', 'film', 'what', 'exactly', 'point', 'film', 'romance', 'one', 'idyllic', 'summer', 'Maine', 'full', 'bright', 'sunshine', 'beautiful', 'ocean', 'Matt', 'Fawler', 'local', 'doctor', 'Ruth', 'Fawler', 'school', 'teacher', 'are', 'spending', 'happy', 'time', 'son', 'Frank', 'who', 'having', 'love', 'affair', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'who', 'son', 'practically', 'separated', 'husband', 'just', 'summer', 'thing', 'nothing', 'serious', 'Frank', 'father', 'Matt', 'shares', 'view', 'son', 'mother', 'sees', 'things', 'differently', 'worrying', 'son', 'behaviors.Then', 'tragedy', 'Richard', 'Natalie', 'abusing', 'husband', 'up', 'fight', 'Frank', 'latter', 'shot', 'Richard', 'handgun', 'Frank', 'parents', 'living', 'deep', 'grief', 'know', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'live', 'way', 'did', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'fact', 'other', 'wound', 'eventually', 'Matt', 'one', 'decision', 'should', 'rectify', 'past', 'will', 'film', 'title', 'prominently', 'Bedroom', 'double', 'ways', 'trap', 'beginning', 'film', 'Matt', 'son', 'course', 'literarily', 'bedroom', 'where', 'film', 'place', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'make', 'noise', 'Fowlers', 'trapped', 'silent', 'room', 'have', 'lacerate', 'other', 'hearts', 'even', 'tragic', 'event', 'happens', 'film', 'instead', 'telling', 'conditions', 'loudly', 'quietly', 'loneliness', 'hear', 'often', 'expression', 'read', 'lines', 'film', 'just', 'instance', 'do', 'that.And', 'make', 'possible', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'true', 'revelation', 'film', 'practically', 'become', 'tormented', 'characters', 'displaying', 'what', 'first-rate', 'players', 'can', 'do', 'best', 'Also', 'note', 'Marissa', 'Tomei', 'career', 'suffering', 'decline', 'Oscar', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'shown', 'terrible', 'Watcher', 'Todd', 'Field', 'may', 'feel', 'proud', 'extracting', 'best', 'performance', 'players', 'should', 'be.The', 'film', 'many', 'virtues', 'only', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'finish', 'review', 'film', 'intentionally', 'crucial', 'parts', 'gunshot', 'case', 'example', 'take', 'multiple', 'views', 'events', 'Fawlers', 'are', 'quite', 'unsatisfied', 'manslaughter', 'verdict', 'would', 'be', 'possibly', 'given', 'are', 'quite', 'naturally', 'take', 'view', 'film', 'cleverly', 'show', 'crime', 'scene', 'making', 'whole', 'situation', 'more', 'unstable', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'film', 'might', 'think', 'Are', 'Fawlers', 'really', 'right', 'instance', 'found', 'Ruth', 'claim', 'who', 'Richard', 'who', 'killed', 'son', 'hanging', 'torturing', 'always', 'small', 'town', 'film', 'shows', 'such', 'scenes', 'only', 'once', 'How', 'should', 'take', 'words', 'how', 'should', 'take', 'last', 'words', 'husband', 'end', 'film', 'key', 'place', 'can', 'not', 'disclose', 'Just', 'watch', 'think', 'Bedroom', 'great', 'making', 'feel', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'going', 'film', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'how', 'ordinary', 'people', 'commit', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'do', 'read', 'many', 'reports', 'newspaper', 'everyday', 'telling', 'crimes', 'think', 'not', 'so', 'special', 'most', 'probably', 'crimes', 'happen', 'film', 'depicts', 'involving', 'many', 'people', 'lives', 'subtle', 'touch', 'greatest', 'merit', 'Bedroom', 'film', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'common', 'territory', 'Bedroom', 'move', 'slowly', 'reality', 'only', 'deft', 'can', 'make', 'like', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'fascinated', 'one', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'fans', 'truthful', 'drama']",In the Bedroom

People do such awful things and alot of times the system really can't/don't do anything for the victims.  Well, in this film, this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son's killer would be dealt with.Story takes place in a small town where the Strout family is a big deal.  You know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers.  There is also the Fowler family which also make their way in the town.  She is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son, Frank, that is dating an older woman (Marisa Tomei) and she has 2 sons.  Well, the Strout family's son is married to Marisa Tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they aren't even divorced yet.  Can't say that I blame him there, but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly.Moving along, the Strout's son kills Frank and because of the Strout's clout and the fact that the ex wife didn't actually see him fire the shot, he is going to get off with manslaughter.  This does not sit well with the Fowler's.  The Fowler's have a friend that has over 300 acres of land, so you can only imagine what happens.  I certainly don't condone vigilantism, however, I just loved the ending.  The Strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail, so since it appeared that he jumped bail, they will lose all of that.  Beautiful!  Then, they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets.  I couldn't help but get some satisfaction out of that myself.

Like i said under the circumstances i suppose it would be like that but i can't understand why anyone would praise such morbidness.

If you like slow but very deep story ; if you ever lost a loved one ; if you understand the harsh reality of a little detail , painfully striking you deep into your hart ; if you prefer exellent cinematography insted of digital graphics - this is your film .Small East coast town , usual people , usual little problems ... and tragedy strikes . The only son is killed by the ex of his girlfriend . But legal sistem works at it best , and killer still on the street . Parenths of the dead boy se him everywhere in this little town . What would you do ?The moments of this movie , which shocked me the most :First - when father walked in the son's room ... camera slowly shows the close on the floor , short on the chear ...the pillow with a headprint still on it ... he touches it ... and I swear , I felt the pain .Second - when father faced the killer on the street. He looks at him ... slowly lookes down... and lookes back at him with the same speed as he rises hand with a gun .And last one - when father quietly walks back to the bedroom... we shocked by surprise - his wife is awake and waiting in the bad ... few quiet seconds ... Did you do it ? - we shocked by her question as much as he was .PS: For some reason , this film reminded me &quot; Ice Storm &quot;.

703536,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B000067J3S,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[1, 2]","What an incredible accomplishment.  And what I found out after watching this amazing movie was the director is new to directing and that this was his first film.  I was shocked, utterly and completely shocked.  You know why?  Because this film knocked the socks off of me and proved itself to be one of those movies that stays with you for years after seeing it!  It was so unbelievably good.  Don't listen to people who say that the script lacks and that the acting lacks because that is all a lie.First of all, this is the *best picture of 2001*, and it should have won Best Picture.  This movie is exciting, well-acted, well-written, well everything!  It is a flawless indie in all respects.And the acting alone was the best in 2001.  Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson performed a tango of fights, glances and dark conversations that molded the movie into perfect form.  And Marisa Tomei (who proved herself to me here) leaves you with that feeling of ""when is she going to come back?"" and ""I want her to feel better!""  She creates a character that is so lovable and dark and torn that you find yourself caring for her all the time, despite anything that she's done.  If it were just another actress playing this role, then the film wouldn't have been the same.  Tomei was definately the greatest part.Just a quick review of the synopsis: Tomei starts dating the eight-years-younger son (a powerful-with-subtlety Nick Stahl) of Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson.  But Tomei's ex-husband can't accept that they aren't married any longer.  So jealousy takes hold, and so does revenge, and so does anger.  And the consequences of these emotions start to overload and develop into a tragedy about a family gone wrong.  But who's to blame?Okay, I do have one or two disclaimers.  First of all, the name ""In the Bedroom"" (for all of you concerned parents out there) has absolutely nothing to do with sex!  This movie is rated R for violence and a scene of bad language, NOT SEX!  In the bedroom is a saying equivelent to ""three's a crowd,"" which is the theme of the film.  And yes, this movie, I admit, may be boring to some.  But remember, the excitement is mostly projected from the pace of the film, the well-portrayed emotions of the actors and the one or two events that get this movie going (which can be another disclaimer to some).  And I know those three reasons sound subtle and superfluous.  But trust me, it will take your breath away.  This film was amazing!Bottom Line: The best film of 2001 with the best acting, writing and overall...best-ness (?).

This film is as good as Ordinary People(Mary Tyler Moore), Imaginery Heros(Sigourney Weaver), and The Door In the Floor(Kim Basinger). It's done in a more aggressive manner that the characters go through some verbal and physical confrontations with each when it comes to blaming the cause of the death of the son in the family. How can I not give full credit to the mesmerizing performances from Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson whose ""from-the-kitchen-to-the-bedroom-fight-scene"" was so captivating. This film clearly brought Marisa Tomei's career back from the dead, and her striking performance also got her second Oscar nomination in the supporting actress category. It was truly unforgetable when she gets one big slap from Spacek.
