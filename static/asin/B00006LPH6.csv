I admit I only made it to the part where he signs with the women's team, but I am not a glutton for punishment so I had to stop there. First off, the plot is stupid enough, but I let that go. Then the acting starts to undo the movie. The dude is so over the top it just makes me cringe. Not even Kobe Bryant is that arrogant and not even Ron Artest is that stupid. So the whole set up to him getting kicked out/suspended from the league is just ridiculous. Then you have to watch the overactor with the bad script in drag.

I could see why Nunez Jr. ran for this role seeing how he hasn't had many starring roles but Vivica Fox, Kevin Pollack and Jenifer Lewis shocked ...me.  I kept wondering why in the world they were so desperate they took part in this.  The film isn't that bad, actually it's very funny but that fun can't help borderline on the verge of being pathetic.  Proving a cheap film can still get laughs unless you take it too seriously. If you take this film seriously you're in trouble.  The film has potential with the plot about a male NBA star getting kicked out of the NBA.  He cooks up a master plot of going drag and playing women's pro ball in hopes the NBA will see what they are missing. From there we have the typical "" Tootsie "". Juwanna falls for Vivica A. Fox, a teammate.  Kevin Pollack plays the slimy agent who will do anything to make a buck. Singer Ginuwine has a small role as Romeo, Vivica's cheating boyfriend and Tommy Davidson plays Puff Smokey Smoke, the man whose heart is stolen by Juwanna who he nicknames ( one tall glass of water ). Surprisingly Tommy was the funniest character in the film.  You never knew what he would do next and I hoped there would be more scenes with him and Juwanna. The basketball scenes ran too long and could have included more comedy.  The film was very short but that was probably a blessing in this case.  All in all the actors are talented and pull off this bad script well.  But it's nothing that they should include on any resume list. In fact they should all forget they made this film and move on.One last thing, Lil' Kim was in it.

life altering experience/lesson.It also stars Vivica Fox,Kevin Pollack,Kim Wayans and Tommy Davidson;the latter two from the highly successful show In Living Colour.The plot involves Nunez who is a star basketball player by the name of Jamal Jeffries,whose ego is only surpassed by the huge meltdown he has during a game in which,among other things,he moons the crowd.He is immediately suspended from the league and without a paycheck his extravagant social life comes crashing down around him.Broke and living with his Aunt,he comes up with a scheme to play in the major womens basketball league.He dresses up(much too convincingly I must say!),cons his former manager into signing him to a contract and ends up playing in the major womens league as he wanted,as Juwanna Mann.He is as successful there as he was with his former male teammates but again his ego starts to get in the way as he becomes a one man/woman team.He eventually falls in love with one of the teammates but learns some much needed life lessons to boot.His cover finally is blown when he does what his manager warned him not to,as he slam dunks a ball and in the process smashes the back glass.At the same time he loses his wig and the con is revealed for all to see.Sitting before a tribunal to gain access back into the men's major league,his former lady team mates all come to rally around and support him.The film ends as his girlfriend gives him the team winners ring and a kiss.Well acted all around,the entire cast is a boost to Nunez Jr.,who plays a strikingly beautiful girl player in the film in order to keep playing the game he loves.There are alot of nice comedy moments and Tommy Davidson plays an over the top suitor to Nunez's' Juwanna Mann.The main message of course is the human element of being a good person and overcoming ego to pursue that road.But it is all wrapped up in good fun and that's what counts.Technically the film is in its a/r of 1:85:1 and the picture is clear and crisp.Extras include a music vid by Fat Joe,the trailer,commentaries,and a behind the scenes featurette.All in all an above average comedy with a wonderful life lesson lesson in the mix and Miguel

This player's got game, girls and attitude to spare.

He'll need brains, creative ball-handling and the right shade of lipstick. Jamal's only chance to get his game back is to join up with the other league--the women's basketball league.
