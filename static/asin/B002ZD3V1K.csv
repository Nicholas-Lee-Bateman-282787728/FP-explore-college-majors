1300090,A4U27URFECK1U,B002ZD3V1K,"Chris Damon ""Classic TV & Tech Guy""","[8, 9]","The third season of Route 66 saw the replacement of ""Buz"" with ""Linc"" as Todd's travel companion on the road. Although I liked George Maharis better than Glen Corbett, he still does a great job with his character. There are some really great episodes in this season if you able to watch them. My set came with 3 defective discs, and I returned it to Amazon. Getting a good set is kind of like playing Russian Roulette from the manufacturer Infinity / Roxbury Entertainment. When you are able to play the discs, the quality of the picture and sound are quite good, it's a shame that the problem is with the production of the physical discs. I just got a new Panasonic Blu-Ray player and I kept getting ""Unsupported Disc"" but the thing was making so much noise in the player you could tell it was not a disc formatting issue. I put it in 2 other players with the same results - the discs were not readable. You would think that they would just re-manufacture this product with GOOD discs instead of having to play the return game. Anyway I hope Season 4 is being released soon, on better quality discs that is!",5,Five Stars for the material on the DVD's only,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,1108,"['third', 'season', 'Route', '66', 'saw', 'replacement', 'Buz', 'Linc', 'Todd', 'travel', 'companion', 'road', 'liked', 'George', 'Maharis', 'better', 'Glen', 'Corbett', 'still', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'able', 'watch', 'set', 'came', '3', 'defective', 'discs', 'returned', 'Amazon', 'Getting', 'good', 'set', 'kind', 'playing', 'Russian', 'Roulette', 'manufacturer', 'Infinity', '/', 'Roxbury', 'Entertainment', 'When', 'are', 'able', 'play', 'discs', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'shame', 'problem', 'production', 'physical', 'discs', 'just', 'got', 'new', 'Panasonic', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'kept', 'getting', 'Unsupported', 'Disc', 'thing', 'was', 'making', 'so', 'much', 'noise', 'player', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'not', 'disc', 'formatting', 'issue', 'put', '2', 'other', 'players', 'same', 'results', 'discs', 'were', 'not', 'readable', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'just', 're-manufacture', 'product', 'GOOD', 'discs', 'instead', 'having', 'play', 'return', 'game', 'Anyway', 'hope', 'Season', '4', 'being', 'released', 'soon', 'better', 'quality', 'discs']",Route 66: Season 3
1300091,A17PJY5YTUU799,B002ZD3V1K,Eclectic Reader,"[0, 0]","What can you say about Route 66 except that it's one of the greatest TV series ever made.  The episodes with George Maharis are stellar.  The ones with Martin Milner alone are very good.  I do have trouble enjoying the episodes with Lincoln Case (Glenn Corbett).  Case/Corbett is such a brooding, depressed character who doesn't seem to get along with Todd Styles/Martin Milner very well.  I find that I just don't have the patience for these episodes and I'll likely skip season 4 for this reason.  Maharis was truly the star of this series, although without Milner, it wouldn't have worked  at all.Picture quality is great on some episodes, and only OK on others.  All are watchable.  Sound is good on every episode.  Some of the disks vibrate in my player (and they vibrate in every player I tried them in).  Still, they play without error.  If you love Route 66 don't skip this set.",4,"5 stars for the series, 3 stars for the package, transfer quality, and DVD quality",1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,886,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'Route', '66', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'episodes', 'George', 'Maharis', 'are', 'stellar', 'ones', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'alone', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'have', 'trouble', 'enjoying', 'episodes', 'Lincoln', 'Case', 'Glenn', 'Corbett', 'Case/Corbett', 'such', 'brooding', 'depressed', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'Todd', 'Styles/Martin', 'Milner', 'very', 'well', 'find', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'skip', 'season', '4', 'reason', 'Maharis', 'was', 'truly', 'star', 'series', 'Milner', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'all.Picture', 'quality', 'great', 'episodes', 'only', 'OK', 'others', 'are', 'watchable', 'Sound', 'good', 'episode', 'disks', 'vibrate', 'player', 'vibrate', 'player', 'tried', 'Still', 'play', 'error', 'love', 'Route', '66', 'do', ""n't"", 'skip', 'set']",Route 66: Season 3

1300093,AK1HP4U0ECM22,B002ZD3V1K,TR,"[31, 36]","Roxbury/Infinty have had a rocky time releasing Route 66 on DVD. The first half of season one used poor quality prints, including one edited episode. The second half of season one was originally released with the aspect ratio altered. The aspect ratio was corrected with the complete first season release, but the poor quality prints remained. Season two came off without a hitch, but the ""Best Buy exclusive"" release of season three was marred by disc authorship problems. I am happy to report that the corrected release (packaged in a yellow-hued plastic as another commenter has noted) has played well, though with the disc rattle that has plagued several Infinty releases. The A/V quality on this release is good, if not up to Image Entertainment standards. Solid blacks and little debris present. Also, there is no episode list contained in this set. The show itself is, of course, one of the best in US TV history, so it's worth overlooking the minor quibbles (disc rattle and no booklet).",5,"Infinty could use a QC manager, but...",1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,995,"['Roxbury/Infinty', 'have', 'had', 'rocky', 'time', 'releasing', 'Route', '66', 'DVD', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'one', 'used', 'poor', 'quality', 'prints', 'including', 'one', 'edited', 'episode', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'altered', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', 'corrected', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'release', 'poor', 'quality', 'prints', 'remained', 'Season', 'two', 'came', 'off', 'hitch', 'Best', 'Buy', 'exclusive', 'release', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'marred', 'disc', 'authorship', 'problems', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'corrected', 'release', 'packaged', 'yellow-hued', 'plastic', 'commenter', 'noted', 'played', 'well', 'disc', 'rattle', 'plagued', 'several', 'Infinty', 'releases', 'A/V', 'quality', 'release', 'good', 'not', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'standards', 'Solid', 'blacks', 'little', 'debris', 'present', 'Also', 'episode', 'list', 'contained', 'set', 'show', 'course', 'one', 'best', 'US', 'TV', 'history', 'worth', 'overlooking', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'disc', 'rattle', 'booklet']",Route 66: Season 3
1300094,A1C80B497LCYKA,B002ZD3V1K,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[0, 0]","Season Three starts becoming predictable - especially with its psycho women - except for the fact that Buz is missing in a lot of the episodes. George Maharis, who plays Buz, was having health problems, and he is replaced a little more than half-way in the season by Glenn Corbett. Glenn is a nice-looking, likable actor, but he just doesn't have the fire of Maharis. Martin Milner continues to be the glue that holds the show together, and always delivers a great performance.One interesting aspect is how the Corvette changes. In the episodes where Buz is missing, they use a Stingray. In the rest, it's the pre-Stingray style. They mix the episodes up somewhat, so that, one episode, Tod (Milner) is driving the Stingray, the next episode Buz will be back and he's driving the previous model. Then the Stingray will come back the next time Buz has to go into the hospital, which is exactly what was happening with Maharis in real life.As in the previous seasons, there are plenty of stars, and that is one of the interesting aspects of Route 66: you get to see some big-name stars getting their start, as well as some famous old-timers. You also get to see a lot of different locations around the country and how they looked back in the early 60s. Things have really changed. But what hasn't changed is human nature, and Route 66 is known for its cutting-edge drama that brings out the best and worst in human nature, and always has a great Christ-based message to deliver at the end.",4,Season Three Lags Behind First Two,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,1487,"['Season', 'Three', 'becoming', 'predictable', 'especially', 'psycho', 'women', 'fact', 'Buz', 'missing', 'lot', 'episodes', 'George', 'Maharis', 'who', 'Buz', 'was', 'having', 'health', 'problems', 'replaced', 'little', 'more', 'half-way', 'season', 'Glenn', 'Corbett', 'Glenn', 'nice-looking', 'likable', 'actor', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'fire', 'Maharis', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'be', 'glue', 'show', 'together', 'always', 'great', 'performance.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'how', 'Corvette', 'changes', 'episodes', 'where', 'Buz', 'missing', 'use', 'Stingray', 'rest', 'pre-Stingray', 'style', 'mix', 'episodes', 'somewhat', 'one', 'episode', 'Tod', 'Milner', 'driving', 'Stingray', 'next', 'episode', 'Buz', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'driving', 'previous', 'model', 'Then', 'Stingray', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'next', 'time', 'Buz', 'go', 'hospital', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Maharis', 'real', 'life.As', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'plenty', 'stars', 'one', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'Route', '66', 'get', 'see', 'big-name', 'stars', 'getting', 'start', 'as', 'well', 'famous', 'old-timers', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'different', 'locations', 'country', 'how', 'looked', 'back', 'early', '60s', 'Things', 'have', 'really', 'changed', 'what', ""n't"", 'changed', 'human', 'nature', 'Route', '66', 'known', 'cutting-edge', 'drama', 'out', 'best', 'worst', 'human', 'nature', 'always', 'great', 'Christ-based', 'message', 'deliver', 'end']",Route 66: Season 3
