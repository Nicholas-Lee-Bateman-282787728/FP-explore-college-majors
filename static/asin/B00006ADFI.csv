708805,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00006ADFI,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[9, 11]","Essentially a ""buddy movie"" about two blue collar guys, one of whom happens to be gay, this 2000 film's low budget atmosphere somehow fits the setting and the characters.  We meet David, a husky womanizer who works as manager of a tiny comedy club, and Jack, a quiet guy who is a carpenter by trade.  Both are in their mid-late 20's.When Jack's longtime girlfriend moves out, David helps Jack adjust to her absence, and the two friends find a larger apartment to share in the ""low rent"" district of Chicago.  Shortly thereafter, Jack confides in David that, since his girlfriend left, he has been exploring his attractions for men, and has decided he is probably gay.  David is openly supportive, though he has some ""issues"" that get resolved when the two have a talk.  David is also faulted for occasionally being insensitive toward Jack's feelings (like when Jack falls in love with Carlos, a fellow tradesman, and David can't see that is more than ""just sex"" to him).  David grows as a person as well, deciding that he too wants some stability in a relationship, unlike the overlapping affairs with women he has maintained in the past.  One scene - with David drunk and being helped to bed by Jack - made me cringe that the screenwriter was going to go with the stereotypical ""gay roomie seduces straight roomie"" cliche' that one sees too often, but, thankfully, he refrained from that. In the end, both men realize what the other's support and companionship has meant to him, with both good and bad results.The male leads are played by the two guys who wrote the film (perhaps autobiographical?  Might be revealed on the commentary track, which I didn't listen to.)  The low budget doesn't detract overall, though there are problems with the sound (dialogue lost to background noise in a couple of scenes), and the direction (by one of the writers/actors) tends to spend too much time on ""atmosphere"" shots that do nothing to add to the film.  Of course, there is not much of a plot, but that isn't a problem in a film that is more of a character study of two likeable guys.I actually give this film extra points for portraying non-stereotypical gay characters. The film may also be somewhat helpful to those dealing with their homosexuality or bisexuality, as Jack talks about his feelings at length with David and others.  The film won the Grand Jury prize at the 2000 Los Angeles ""Out Fest"" (G/L film festival).",3,"A ""buddy movie"" of two friends, one gay.",1035504000,"10 25, 2002",2002,2418,"['Essentially', 'buddy', 'movie', 'two', 'blue', 'collar', 'guys', 'one', 'whom', 'be', 'gay', '2000', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'atmosphere', 'somehow', 'setting', 'characters', 'meet', 'David', 'husky', 'womanizer', 'who', 'manager', 'tiny', 'comedy', 'club', 'Jack', 'quiet', 'guy', 'who', 'carpenter', 'trade', 'are', 'mid-late', ""20's.When"", 'Jack', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'out', 'David', 'Jack', 'adjust', 'absence', 'two', 'friends', 'find', 'larger', 'apartment', 'share', 'low', 'rent', 'district', 'Chicago', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'Jack', 'David', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'been', 'exploring', 'attractions', 'men', 'decided', 'probably', 'gay', 'David', 'openly', 'supportive', 'issues', 'get', 'resolved', 'when', 'two', 'have', 'talk', 'David', 'also', 'faulted', 'occasionally', 'being', 'insensitive', 'Jack', 'feelings', 'when', 'Jack', 'love', 'Carlos', 'fellow', 'tradesman', 'David', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'just', 'sex', 'David', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'deciding', 'too', 'stability', 'relationship', 'overlapping', 'affairs', 'women', 'maintained', 'past', 'One', 'scene', 'David', 'drunk', 'being', 'helped', 'bed', 'Jack', 'made', 'cringe', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'stereotypical', 'gay', 'roomie', 'seduces', 'straight', 'roomie', 'cliche', 'one', 'too', 'often', 'thankfully', 'refrained', 'end', 'men', 'realize', 'what', 'other', 'support', 'companionship', 'meant', 'good', 'bad', 'results.The', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'played', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'perhaps', 'autobiographical', 'Might', 'be', 'revealed', 'commentary', 'track', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'low', 'budget', ""n't"", 'detract', 'overall', 'are', 'problems', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'lost', 'background', 'noise', 'couple', 'scenes', 'direction', 'one', 'writers/actors', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'atmosphere', 'shots', 'do', 'nothing', 'add', 'film', 'course', 'not', 'much', 'plot', ""n't"", 'problem', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'likeable', 'guys.I', 'actually', 'give', 'film', 'extra', 'points', 'portraying', 'non-stereotypical', 'gay', 'characters', 'film', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'somewhat', 'helpful', 'dealing', 'homosexuality', 'bisexuality', 'Jack', 'talks', 'feelings', 'length', 'David', 'others', 'film', 'won', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'prize', '2000', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Out', 'Fest', 'G/L', 'film', 'festival']",Straightman

While the film was done for very little money and it does show the movie works incredibly well on an emotional level. It also breaks new ground in the world of gay cinema in that it is one of the few films that deals with older men who are very blue collar. (why do 99% of gay films deal with impossibly beautiful young men?)The story traces the friendship of two friends after their breakups with their girlfriends. After moving into together one begins to explore his gayness. This takes the friendship on some interesting turns especially when dealing with the first romance and heartbreak. While the plot is thin at times the film really is more of a character study between to friends as they come to terms with growing and changing.
