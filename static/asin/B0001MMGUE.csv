This movie did TERRIBLE in the box office compared to the other three.Ice Cube is no Vin Diesel (not even Tyrese for that matter), and Martin Henderson is a much older and more average version of Paul Walker. The only near-leading lady (if you don't count the 5 minute cameo of the pretty Christina Milian) is easily upstaged by all the extras. So obviously this copy-cat movie isn't even saved by a good looking cast.The acting was very average, but that's to be expected since not many members of the cast have a long movie credit list. The one-liners were downright silly at times, not that there were many to being with.The basic plot was a biker guy (after coming back from 6 months in Thailand running from the police) gets framed for a murder by another group of bikers because ""Ford"" (Martin, our main character) won't return the other-bikers' bikes that have drugs in them. Did I mention the man they killed is the brother of the leader in ANOTHER biker gang (this gang happens to be a -ridiculously- urban group for a gang who's in the middle of nowhere) and he goes after Ford too? The gallant Ford, his two friends and his girlfriend have to clear his name. Of course, cars are blown up, people die, car/bike chases ensue and all that jazz.It sounds complicated because the movie (obviously) tries to hard but the movie is surprisingly (err...well not THAT surprisingly) forgettable.I generously gave it 2 Stars because it reminded me to give even more credit to xXx and the t.F.a.t.F. and it's sequel. The blatant (and repeated) stealing of the great ending computer generated scene in xXx and it's -desperate- attempt to have more dazzling action scenes than The Fast and the Furious made three years prior to Torque.This movie doesn't succeed, in any way.

811106,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,B0001MMGUE,Daniel K.,"[23, 24]","Torque, the new action flick from producer Neal H. Moritz, who produced other smash hits including The Fast and the Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, S.W.A.T. and XXX is actually good.  Don't get me wrong the plot is disposable, infact there barely is a serviceable plot but somehow this movie entertains especially when the action gets going.Martin Henderson plays Ford, a biker who gets in some trouble with rival bike gang.  Ice Cube plays a leader of a gang called the Reapers who are after Ford since Cube's character thinks he killed his brother.  The Hellions are another group who are manipulating the Reapers into think that he killed his brother when it was indeed them, (the leader of the Hellions gang, played by surprisingly Matt Schluze).  Director Joseph Kahn makes his directorial debut and makes a fine one.  Though his film makes little sense with an ill-conceived and nonsensical plot it still is worthy just for its groundbreaking and spectacular bike stunts.  Some might see them as fake, especially in the finale which is CGI.  But overall it's mainly good fun.  Surprisingly this movie felt a little long for being an astoundingly short 81 minutes.  But you'll like it trust me, at least for the action.Torque is rated PG-13 for Violence, Sexuality, Language and Some Drug References.  The violence includes gunplay, head-banging fights and explosions.  The sexuality isn't explicit mainly innuendo along with suggestive dancing.  Language is moderate while not being overly strong.  All in all, it's a fine ride, especially if you enjoyed The Fast and the Furious movies, XXX and S.W.A.T.

I had no way of knowing legendary producer Neal Moritz could dip so low when I persuaded you to tag along with me for a 9:55 p.m. showing of ""Torque"" last Friday evening.Truth be told, Moritz's previous attempts at the cinematic aesthetic had yielded nothing but luscious fruit. For example, consider the tour de force ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" perhaps the creepiest film ever made, period. Throw in the most ingenious script I've come across in many a moon, dating all the way back to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation,"" and you've got yourself a surefire spine twitch.OK, OK, the preceding paragraphs were about as realistic as the campaign poster, ""Vote Kucinich Because He Hates Spinach.""In all honesty, Rick, the mistake we made with ""Torque"" was that contemporary biker movies simply are not one-fifth of what they were yesteryear. Oh, lord have mercy, where have the glorious days of ""Chrome and Hot Leather,"" ""Cycle Savages"" and ""Angel Unchained"" vanished to? It is no wonder the Hell's Angels numbers have been steadily shrinking with such cheese ball rubbish as ""Biker Babes from Beyond the Grave"" making it into theaters.It seems obvious ""Torque"" is nothing more than a suped-up commercial with a running time of 81 minutes. Hell, Rick, all throughout I saw the actors munching on Doritos, sipping Mountain Dew and even fighting to the backdrop of a Pepsi banner. The sequence at the biker-fest was virtually identical to Kid Rock's music video ""Bawitdaba,"" with flaunty babes of all sorts, hard-boiled bikers slurping gasoline, and midgets to boot.With hackneyed phrases stolen from previous Moritz productions such as ""The Fast and the Furious,"" a film of such degradable value as ""Torque"" must rely on its special effects. It fails miserably. Half of the time, I didn't have the faintest idea as to what was unfolding before me. I must have erupted into frenzied laughter a hundred times due to the piteousness of it all.What's even more humorous about ""Torque"" is its inadvertent homage to the cybernetic organism T-1000 found in James Cameron's blockbuster ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" The not-so-corrupt FBI agent is shot repeatedly in every quadrant of the upper torso. Then she blows herself and her shady partner sky-high by detonating a warehouse full of crystal meth. Only strange thing about it all is that while her partner has been blown to bits, she escapes with hardly a scratch, henceforth she is constitued of a futuristic liquid alloy.All in all, ""Torque"" is so rank and the acting so horrendous it makes a Brooklyn-accented alley cat with the last name ""Gigli"" and his Selena-turned-lesbian love interest look Oscar-worthy.",1,Not much drive to `Torque',1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2758,"['one', 'Richard', 'Daniel', 'Raney', 'Old', 'friend', 'forgive', 'shortcomings', 'had', 'way', 'knowing', 'legendary', 'producer', 'Neal', 'Moritz', 'could', 'dip', 'so', 'low', 'when', 'persuaded', 'tag', '9:55', 'p.m.', 'showing', 'Torque', 'last', 'Friday', 'evening.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Moritz', 'previous', 'attempts', 'cinematic', 'aesthetic', 'had', 'yielded', 'nothing', 'luscious', 'fruit', 'example', 'consider', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Still', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'perhaps', 'creepiest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'period', 'Throw', 'most', 'ingenious', 'script', ""'ve"", 'come', 'many', 'moon', 'dating', 'way', 'back', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Next', 'Generation', ""'ve"", 'got', 'surefire', 'spine', 'twitch.OK', 'OK', 'preceding', 'paragraphs', 'were', 'about', 'as', 'realistic', 'campaign', 'poster', 'Vote', 'Kucinich', 'Spinach', 'honesty', 'Rick', 'mistake', 'made', 'Torque', 'was', 'contemporary', 'biker', 'movies', 'simply', 'are', 'not', 'one-fifth', 'what', 'were', 'yesteryear', 'Oh', 'lord', 'have', 'mercy', 'where', 'have', 'glorious', 'days', 'Chrome', 'Hot', 'Leather', 'Cycle', 'Savages', 'Angel', 'Unchained', 'vanished', 'wonder', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'numbers', 'have', 'been', 'steadily', 'shrinking', 'such', 'cheese', 'ball', 'rubbish', 'Biker', 'Babes', 'Beyond', 'Grave', 'making', 'theaters.It', 'obvious', 'Torque', 'nothing', 'more', 'suped-up', 'commercial', 'running', 'time', '81', 'minutes', 'Hell', 'Rick', 'saw', 'actors', 'munching', 'Doritos', 'sipping', 'Mountain', 'Dew', 'even', 'fighting', 'backdrop', 'Pepsi', 'banner', 'sequence', 'biker-fest', 'was', 'virtually', 'identical', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'music', 'video', 'Bawitdaba', 'flaunty', 'babes', 'sorts', 'hard-boiled', 'bikers', 'slurping', 'gasoline', 'midgets', 'boot.With', 'hackneyed', 'phrases', 'stolen', 'previous', 'Moritz', 'productions', 'such', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'film', 'such', 'degradable', 'value', 'Torque', 'must', 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'miserably', 'Half', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'faintest', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'unfolding', 'must', 'have', 'erupted', 'frenzied', 'laughter', 'hundred', 'times', 'due', 'piteousness', 'even', 'more', 'humorous', 'Torque', 'inadvertent', 'homage', 'cybernetic', 'organism', 'T-1000', 'found', 'James', 'Cameron', 'blockbuster', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'not-so-corrupt', 'FBI', 'agent', 'shot', 'repeatedly', 'quadrant', 'upper', 'torso', 'Then', 'shady', 'partner', 'sky-high', 'detonating', 'warehouse', 'full', 'crystal', 'meth', 'Only', 'strange', 'thing', 'partner', 'been', 'blown', 'bits', 'hardly', 'scratch', 'henceforth', 'constitued', 'futuristic', 'liquid', 'alloy.All', 'Torque', 'so', 'rank', 'acting', 'so', 'horrendous', 'Brooklyn-accented', 'alley', 'cat', 'last', 'name', 'Gigli', 'Selena-turned-lesbian', 'love', 'interest', 'look', 'Oscar-worthy']",N/A

Noticing how the story went, I began to realize how cliched it was in different ways: genre fictional, gang warfare-oriented, bikes, even skimpy parties. A touch of intelligence here and there, along with a major dose of camera stylizing, and some cliches are actually made fun of (some central to the story's core), while others are twisted about for entertainment.Dialogue-wise, it did get tiresome with all the people sounding like nothing more than immature high school kids trying too hard to impress each other. Not only with insults, but trying (at times, a bit too hard) to cuss each other out. Trying to show off what they have. It gets pretty annoying almost for the whole thing.There's also all the cliches that go with an action movie these days; gunplay, gunplay reversals, CGI-centered streets (and one certain scene seems to be the inspiration for the burning streets scene in Ghost Rider), and more.Aside from all that, there was some good- a man that, in spite of all the chances he had to off his pursuer, never does.

The dialogue is uniformly ridiculous, and one can almost hear director Joseph Kahn giving his actors last minute instructions before setting his cameras a-rolling:  ""OK, everybody, now strut around, look tough and scowl a lot.""

The people who wan't it are going far as to frame him for murder; the others belive he WAS the one that murdered, the one another gang framed him for(The man killed was part of the rival gang, one by blood), and the cops who get a sketch of him, and decide to go after him.It seems too much to handle for one guy, but it's pretty good.  The chase sceenes are pretty nice, and intense, especially the end(Hyperspeed in the streets).  And it has few plot twists, but there pretty nice.The things wrong with this movie, is I don't usally expect bigtime drug pushers to be masters of bikeriding,  the DEA officers look like collage potheads, and some of the sceenes are too expected(On the train tracks), too teen style(Chick fight on bikes), and too hollywood(As usual)The reason I think many people didn't give this movie a chance, was because there have been a lot of speed movies since the Fast and the Furious, and they sucked(Even it's sequal.)  If this movie would-have beefed it up with the R rating, it probably would have gotten more attention(Because seeing people getting blasted by shotguns, but no blood isn't cool, cuz it's fake)Anyhow, according to reviews a lot of people hate this movie, but I found it ok.  And it's a pretty decent movie for those who love racing/speed style movies.  It had great concept, but could have been much more.Peace",3,It was better than I thought it was going to be,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,1793,"['herd', 'friend', 'friend', 'movie', 'sucked', 'got', 'lot', 'people', 'thinking', 'negative', 'movie', 'was', 'reluctant', 'check', 'out.Then', 'looked', 'around', 'channels', 'found', 'decided', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'opening', '20', 'minutes', 'was', 'pretty', 'dull', 'then', 'movie', 'kicks', 'slowly', 'surley', 'biker', 'Henderson', 'who', 'million', 'crystal', 'meth', 'upsetting', 'few', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'wa', ""n't"", 'are', 'going', 'far', 'frame', 'murder', 'others', 'belive', 'WAS', 'one', 'murdered', 'one', 'gang', 'framed', 'man', 'killed', 'was', 'part', 'rival', 'gang', 'one', 'blood', 'cops', 'who', 'get', 'sketch', 'decide', 'go', 'him.It', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'one', 'guy', 'pretty', 'good', 'chase', 'sceenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'intense', 'especially', 'end', 'Hyperspeed', 'streets', 'few', 'plot', 'twists', 'there', 'pretty', 'nice.The', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'usally', 'expect', 'bigtime', 'drug', 'pushers', 'be', 'masters', 'bikeriding', 'DEA', 'officers', 'look', 'collage', 'potheads', 'sceenes', 'are', 'too', 'expected', 'train', 'tracks', 'too', 'teen', 'style', 'Chick', 'fight', 'bikes', 'too', 'hollywood', 'usual', 'reason', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'speed', 'movies', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'sucked', 'Even', 'sequal', 'movie', 'would-have', 'beefed', 'up', 'R', 'rating', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'attention', 'seeing', 'people', 'getting', 'blasted', 'shotguns', 'blood', ""n't"", 'cool', 'cuz', 'fake', 'Anyhow', 'according', 'reviews', 'lot', 'people', 'hate', 'movie', 'found', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie', 'who', 'love', 'racing/speed', 'style', 'movies', 'had', 'great', 'concept', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more.Peace']",N/A

In 'Torque,' you only get the silliest actions you ever seen.Martin Henderson ('The Ring') is a biker Cary Ford, who suddenly disappeared from the girlfriend six months ago, and he comes back to the town again, showing up before her.  The ex-love Shane (Monet Mazur) is not happy about it, and the local bikers, especially Trey (Ice Cube) is not happy about it, and most of all, another biker (and gangstar) Henry (Matt Schulze) is not happy about it, for the boy did take away something expensive from him.  And a suit from FBI is watching them....To be honest, the story is no problem (with me).  The problem is the bike actions that should be more exciting.  The director Joseph Kahn, obviously having accomplished his skills with the MTV video clips, does great disservice to the stunt scenes, with badly edited sequences and misguided use of special effects.  If you think a biker riding a huge bike on the roof of a moving train is cool, then this is your film.No, actually, I like the idea itself; what is absolutely wrong is, it's too obvious that they are using CGIs to create the scenes.  The same can be said about the climax 'Y2K' bike chase scenes, which are too fast, too ineptly edited, to be really exciting.  This scene, and many of others would make you wonder what is really going on?Plus, you get bland acting from the lead.  Ice Cube tries to be as cool as possible, trying to maintain his image, but deep down in his heart he must have known that he was in the wrong place, and should have been in 'Barbershop 2.'  And when you see Jamie Pressly (with pierces and Goth make-up) as 'China' who rides her biker like a wild animal, you get the idea of the movie itself.Again I say it's not the story or characters I dislike; it's MTV-styled actions that are most annoying.DON'T USE CGIs, please, Mr. Kahn, when the stunts are doing their jobs.",2,"Bikes, Bikes, Chicks, and Bikes: Silly Story, Silly Actions",1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,1955,"['fact', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'silly', 'story', ""'d"", 'rather', 'like', 'when', 'give', 'good', 'actions', ""'Torque"", 'only', 'get', 'silliest', 'actions', 'ever', 'seen.Martin', 'Henderson', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'biker', 'Cary', 'Ford', 'who', 'suddenly', 'disappeared', 'girlfriend', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'back', 'town', 'again', 'showing', 'up', 'ex-love', 'Shane', 'Monet', 'Mazur', 'not', 'happy', 'local', 'bikers', 'especially', 'Trey', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'not', 'happy', 'most', 'biker', 'gangstar', 'Henry', 'Matt', 'Schulze', 'not', 'happy', 'boy', 'did', 'take', 'away', 'something', 'expensive', 'suit', 'FBI', 'watching', '.To', 'be', 'honest', 'story', 'problem', 'problem', 'bike', 'actions', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'exciting', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Kahn', 'obviously', 'having', 'accomplished', 'skills', 'MTV', 'video', 'clips', 'great', 'disservice', 'stunt', 'scenes', 'badly', 'edited', 'sequences', 'misguided', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'think', 'biker', 'riding', 'huge', 'bike', 'roof', 'moving', 'train', 'cool', 'then', 'film.No', 'actually', 'like', 'idea', 'what', 'absolutely', 'wrong', 'too', 'obvious', 'are', 'using', 'CGIs', 'create', 'scenes', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'climax', 'bike', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'ineptly', 'edited', 'be', 'really', 'exciting', 'scene', 'many', 'others', 'would', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'get', 'bland', 'acting', 'lead', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'be', 'as', 'cool', 'possible', 'trying', 'maintain', 'image', 'deep', 'down', 'heart', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'should', 'have', 'been', ""'Barbershop"", '2', 'when', 'see', 'Jamie', 'Pressly', 'pierces', 'Goth', 'make-up', ""'China"", 'who', 'biker', 'wild', 'animal', 'get', 'idea', 'movie', 'itself.Again', 'say', 'not', 'story', 'characters', 'dislike', 'MTV-styled', 'actions', 'are', 'most', 'annoying.DO', ""N'T"", 'USE', 'CGIs', 'please', 'Mr.', 'Kahn', 'when', 'stunts', 'are', 'doing', 'jobs']",N/A

Part of it is lame, completely unrealistic story. While I like cool stunts and bikes, this was just too unbelivable. And let's not forget the ""FBI agent"" and his sidekick. Is that a joke or what? What really ruined it for me was Ice cube(where did he come up with that nickname-he likes ice cubes?). I don't understand why would anyone put him a movie since he can't act if his life depended on it. He scowls a lot and that's about it.

811142,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0001MMGUE,Wuchak,"[2, 3]","Released in 2004, ""Torque"" cost $40 million and only made a little over half back at the USA box office. It's therefore not a very well-known film, but its gained a hardcore cult following in the years since. After viewing it I can see why.I thought it was going to be terrible, but it was actually great! The action goods are all there, but five minutes into it I got the joke and was laughing with it and not at it. I don't think ""Torque"" will appeal to everyone, but it will get two types for sure: action gearheads who just want a solid uncomplicated action picture, and smart viewers who can appreciate clever filmmaking and the in-jokes threaded throughout.I fall under the second bracket since I generally loathe mindless action flicks. What takes ""Torque"" beyond mindless physics-defying action is pointed out above: the film is cleverly made and filled with hilarious in-jokes. Director Joseph Kahn has a history in flashy music videos and this comes across on the screen. It's pure eye-candy from beginning to end with all manner of entertaining tidbits, like the brief close-up of the turtle between the racing cars at the very beginning.The look & vibe is pure comic book come to life. Every shot, facial expression, action scene, confrontation, word, set, pose, etc. reflects this. The bikes are mostly crotch rockets but there are all kinds. The guys are coolness personified and the girls are hotness incarnated. The cast is highlighted by Martin Henderson as the worthy protagonist and Monet Mazur as his babe. Ice Cube is great as the leader of a black gang, while Matt Schulze and Jaime Pressly play the villains. There are also a couple of FBI agents in the mix.The cinematography is gorgeous, shot in the desolate regions of S. California.The film takes no prisoners at a brief 84 minutes. This is good since films of this ilk shouldn't overstay their welcome.Believe it or not, there's actually some depth to the characters and storyline; we see glimpses of courage, love, friendship, repentance, respect, sacrifice and loyalty. If they would have upped the depth and offered some moving epic parts I would have easily given the film a top rating of 5/5 Stars.But it works fine as is. It is what it is -- perhaps the ultimate cult action film ever made, pulsating with energy, creativity and excitement.GRADE: B+ or A-",4,Cult action flick with motorcycle gangs,1315440000,"09 8, 2011",2011,2339,"['Released', '2004', 'Torque', 'cost', '40', 'million', 'only', 'made', 'little', 'back', 'USA', 'box', 'office', 'therefore', 'not', 'very', 'well-known', 'film', 'gained', 'hardcore', 'cult', 'following', 'years', 'viewing', 'can', 'see', 'why.I', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'terrible', 'was', 'actually', 'great', 'action', 'goods', 'are', 'there', 'five', 'minutes', 'got', 'joke', 'was', 'laughing', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Torque', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'will', 'get', 'two', 'types', 'sure', 'action', 'gearheads', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'solid', 'uncomplicated', 'action', 'picture', 'smart', 'viewers', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'clever', 'filmmaking', 'in-jokes', 'threaded', 'throughout.I', 'fall', 'second', 'bracket', 'generally', 'loathe', 'mindless', 'action', 'flicks', 'What', 'Torque', 'mindless', 'physics-defying', 'action', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'cleverly', 'made', 'filled', 'hilarious', 'in-jokes', 'Director', 'Joseph', 'Kahn', 'history', 'flashy', 'music', 'videos', 'screen', 'pure', 'eye-candy', 'beginning', 'end', 'manner', 'entertaining', 'tidbits', 'brief', 'close-up', 'turtle', 'racing', 'cars', 'very', 'beginning.The', 'look', 'vibe', 'pure', 'comic', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'Every', 'shot', 'facial', 'expression', 'action', 'scene', 'confrontation', 'word', 'set', 'pose', 'etc', 'bikes', 'are', 'mostly', 'crotch', 'rockets', 'are', 'kinds', 'guys', 'are', 'coolness', 'personified', 'girls', 'are', 'hotness', 'incarnated', 'cast', 'highlighted', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'worthy', 'protagonist', 'Monet', 'Mazur', 'babe', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'great', 'leader', 'black', 'gang', 'Matt', 'Schulze', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'play', 'villains', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'FBI', 'agents', 'mix.The', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'shot', 'desolate', 'regions', 'S.', 'California.The', 'film', 'prisoners', 'brief', '84', 'minutes', 'good', 'films', 'ilk', 'should', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcome.Believe', 'not', 'actually', 'depth', 'characters', 'storyline', 'see', 'glimpses', 'courage', 'love', 'friendship', 'repentance', 'respect', 'sacrifice', 'loyalty', 'would', 'have', 'upped', 'depth', 'offered', 'moving', 'epic', 'parts', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'given', 'film', 'top', 'rating', '5/5', 'Stars.But', 'fine', 'what', 'perhaps', 'ultimate', 'cult', 'action', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'pulsating', 'energy', 'creativity', 'excitement.GRADE', 'B+', 'A-']",N/A
