1552940,AZV5NGPANACNI,B008GOAF4S,Mickey,"[0, 0]","Even though  some of these songs are on DVDs that I already own, I could not be more blessed. Michael Booth's singing of Look for Me at Jesus' Feet amazed me on the South Africa video, and had the same affect all over again. Ronnie Booth's personal testimony moved me to tears, -not because I was saddened by it, but because I shared his discovery. This God believing man has a beautiful, never tiring to me, voice. Michael sings beautifully as well, is funny and lively, but when he sang Look for Me at Jesus' Feet, mouths hush, and audience movement was minimal. One could readily tell that this young man meant every word of it. He shared his faith and love for his Savior in that song, leaving me contemplating my final destination, for sure, and listening intently to every word, much like I did when Ronnie gave his spoken testimony.All three of the guys gave great testimonies, almost casually their gripping words came in-between the song presentations that make up the musical part of this album. They each shared thoughts that I pondered days afterward. I live in Arizona, and this album was sent to me by a dear friend in Oregon, because she knew how much I wanted it, but I had no idea what a joy it would be!Another was LOVE WAS IN THE ROOM, -what a song!  WHEN I MET THE MASTER had me on the edge of my seat. ALL OVER THE WORLD, was fun as well as inspiring. THANK HIM FOR THE MIRACLE, another song that makes one want to stop and thank our Lord for His great gift to us. LIVIN' FOR THE MOMENT, (written by Jim Brady), a really good song, -cheery and thoughtful..The songs they sang tell their stories. Jim Brady told Bill Gaither, (and us that listen), he meant what he sang, and he wants folks to know this, H's serious. THEN I MET THE MASTER is a classic, and the Booth Bros. were the first ones I remember hearing sing it. An amazing song, and oh my, wait 'til you hear them sing it!  I loved SAIL ON. It was a fun song, with Jim Murray and Michael Booth hogging the scene, so to speak. I loved it.I had heard a lot about the song CHRIST ALONE. I was curious, but the title seemed similar too many titles for songs or sermons, and there are a whole bunch of great songs out there, and great singers as well.. Well, what do I know anyway? That song, Christ Alone is another classic, and the Booth Brothers put their hearts into it, -and Larry Gatlin could scarcely keep his seat.  If I had been there, I think I would have joined Larry in his expressions of appreciation. As it was, I simply sat on the edge of my chair, as I tend to do when I hear something so moving.One of almost everyone's favorites, THROUGH IT ALL,  is also on this DVD, interrupted by Michael's words entering into -and pulling us away- from this Canadian performance to bear witness of the message and meaning it brought to him. Then Ronnie added his most moving testimony. The guys do a wonderful job of blending, in conversation as well as musically. It rather reminds me of Ernie Haas' harmony rock. We all need such harmony, and it is great to see it in action. I can tell you: The testimonies of those three dear children of God were not intrusive to the music, but pleasantly given, and I valued each statement, and I do thank God that we have folks like those and the Gaither people to &#34;help us on our journey home.&#34;",5,And their best is what we get!,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,3322,"['Even', 'songs', 'are', 'DVDs', 'already', 'own', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'blessed', 'Michael', 'Booth', 'singing', 'Look', 'Me', 'Jesus', 'Feet', 'amazed', 'South', 'Africa', 'video', 'had', 'same', 'affect', 'over', 'again', 'Ronnie', 'Booth', 'personal', 'testimony', 'moved', 'tears', '-not', 'was', 'saddened', 'shared', 'discovery', 'God', 'believing', 'man', 'beautiful', 'never', 'tiring', 'voice', 'Michael', 'beautifully', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'lively', 'when', 'sang', 'Look', 'Me', 'Jesus', 'Feet', 'mouths', 'hush', 'audience', 'movement', 'was', 'minimal', 'One', 'could', 'readily', 'tell', 'young', 'man', 'meant', 'word', 'shared', 'faith', 'love', 'Savior', 'song', 'leaving', 'contemplating', 'final', 'destination', 'sure', 'listening', 'intently', 'word', 'much', 'did', 'when', 'Ronnie', 'gave', 'spoken', 'testimony.All', 'three', 'guys', 'gave', 'great', 'testimonies', 'almost', 'casually', 'gripping', 'words', 'came', 'in-between', 'song', 'presentations', 'make', 'up', 'musical', 'part', 'album', 'shared', 'thoughts', 'pondered', 'days', 'afterward', 'live', 'Arizona', 'album', 'was', 'sent', 'dear', 'friend', 'Oregon', 'knew', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'joy', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'LOVE', 'WAS', 'IN', 'THE', 'ROOM', '-what', 'song', 'WHEN', 'MET', 'THE', 'MASTER', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'was', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'inspiring', 'THANK', 'HIM', 'THE', 'MIRACLE', 'song', 'one', 'want', 'stop', 'thank', 'Lord', 'great', 'gift', 'LIVIN', 'THE', 'MOMENT', 'written', 'Jim', 'Brady', 'really', 'good', 'song', '-cheery', 'thoughtful..The', 'songs', 'sang', 'tell', 'stories', 'Jim', 'Brady', 'told', 'Bill', 'Gaither', 'meant', 'what', 'sang', 'folks', 'know', 'H', 'serious', 'THEN', 'MET', 'THE', 'MASTER', 'classic', 'Booth', 'Bros.', 'were', 'first', 'ones', 'remember', 'hearing', 'sing', 'amazing', 'song', 'oh', 'wait', 'hear', 'sing', 'loved', 'SAIL', 'ON', 'was', 'fun', 'song', 'Jim', 'Murray', 'Michael', 'Booth', 'hogging', 'scene', 'so', 'speak', 'loved', 'it.I', 'had', 'heard', 'lot', 'song', 'CHRIST', 'ALONE', 'was', 'curious', 'title', 'seemed', 'similar', 'too', 'many', 'titles', 'songs', 'sermons', 'are', 'whole', 'bunch', 'great', 'songs', 'there', 'great', 'singers', 'well..', 'Well', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'anyway', 'song', 'Christ', 'Alone', 'classic', 'Booth', 'Brothers', 'put', 'hearts', '-and', 'Larry', 'Gatlin', 'could', 'scarcely', 'keep', 'seat', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'joined', 'Larry', 'expressions', 'appreciation', 'was', 'simply', 'sat', 'edge', 'chair', 'tend', 'do', 'when', 'hear', 'something', 'so', 'moving.One', 'almost', 'everyone', 'favorites', 'IT', 'ALL', 'also', 'DVD', 'interrupted', 'Michael', 'words', 'entering', '-and', 'pulling', 'away-', 'Canadian', 'performance', 'bear', 'witness', 'message', 'meaning', 'brought', 'Then', 'Ronnie', 'added', 'most', 'moving', 'testimony', 'guys', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'blending', 'conversation', 'as', 'well', 'musically', 'rather', 'Ernie', 'Haas', 'harmony', 'rock', 'need', 'such', 'harmony', 'great', 'see', 'action', 'can', 'tell', 'testimonies', 'three', 'dear', 'children', 'God', 'were', 'not', 'intrusive', 'music', 'pleasantly', 'given', 'valued', 'statement', 'do', 'thank', 'God', 'have', 'folks', 'Gaither', 'people', '34', 'help', 'journey', 'home.', '34']",The Best of the Booth Brothers
