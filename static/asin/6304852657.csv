God of gamblers return (which I haven't seen), and treasure hunt(critically hated, i personally enjoyed). Apparently, Yun-fat was so eager to have  another hit, he wrote the story himself, and a great one it is. A sweeping  Hong Kong &quot;Eastern Western&quot;, I found the cinematography  breathtaking, and the montage where chow yun fat and cecelia yip fall in  love particularly touching. My only problem in the film was that it tried  to be too much of an epic in an hour and a half, it was probaby rushed. The  finale stands up there with A Better tomorrow 1,2, and the killer as one of  chow's final moments of blazing glory.",5,Chow yun Fat's best film since &quot;Full Contact&quot;,932688000,"07 23, 1999",1999,704,"['Full', 'contact', 'chow', 'yun', 'fat', 'made', 'few', 'mistakes', 'so', 'i', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'God', 'gamblers', 'return', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'critically', 'hated', 'i', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'Apparently', 'Yun-fat', 'was', 'so', 'eager', 'have', 'hit', 'wrote', 'story', 'great', 'one', 'sweeping', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'quot', 'Eastern', 'Western', 'quot', 'found', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'montage', 'where', 'chow', 'fat', 'cecelia', 'yip', 'fall', 'love', 'particularly', 'touching', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'tried', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'epic', 'hour', 'half', 'was', 'probaby', 'rushed', 'finale', 'up', 'there', 'A', 'Better', 'tomorrow', '1,2', 'killer', 'one', 'chow', 'final', 'moments', 'blazing', 'glory']",Peace Hotel

Chow Yun Fat, as always, shines.  My only criticism is that the ending falters a bit.  I do not want to spoil it for everyone, but it almost seemed anti-climatic, and not in the best direction.  But regardless I thought it was great and enjoyed it.",5,Suprisingly good,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,362,"['thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'only', 'matched', 'great', 'supporting', 'case', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'always', 'shines', 'only', 'criticism', 'ending', 'falters', 'bit', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'everyone', 'almost', 'seemed', 'anti-climatic', 'not', 'best', 'direction', 'regardless', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'enjoyed']",Peace Hotel

The story starts out unclear but it all comes together by the end of the movie.  Chow runs the Peace Hotel and has so ever since he had a very bad day which they will show shots of at the start.  Cecilia Yip shows up saying she is Chow's mistress but she is really on the run from some bad men.  There has always been an agreement that when someone flees to the Peace Hotel, the pursuers must give up their chase and turn back until that person leaves.  When this woman shows up it looks like the bad guys with their fierce leader are going to storm into the hotel and take the girl regardless of the agreement that has been made.  The movie is funny at times, has a couple of good action sequences, but ultimately falls short of being a good movie.  Chow steals the show from everyone and I was expecting a much bigger impact from the end which fell way short of my expectations.  Great music also and some AMAZING cinematography but an average movie needed at least a decent ending.The version from Mei Eh has ok picture quality and pretty good subtitles.  This movie won a Hong Kong film award for the best original film song.  Personally I didn't think it was that great but it has subtitles which you may know is a rare thing for songs in Chinese movies.",3,Chow Yun-Fat's last starring role in Hong Kong before coming to do movies in America,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,1368,"['would', 'only', 'consider', 'average', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'area', 'actually', 'below', 'average', 'story', 'out', 'unclear', 'together', 'end', 'movie', 'Chow', 'Peace', 'Hotel', 'so', 'ever', 'had', 'very', 'bad', 'day', 'will', 'show', 'shots', 'start', 'Cecilia', 'Yip', 'up', 'saying', 'Chow', 'mistress', 'really', 'run', 'bad', 'men', 'always', 'been', 'agreement', 'when', 'someone', 'Peace', 'Hotel', 'pursuers', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'chase', 'turn', 'back', 'person', 'When', 'woman', 'bad', 'guys', 'fierce', 'leader', 'are', 'going', 'storm', 'hotel', 'take', 'girl', 'regardless', 'agreement', 'been', 'made', 'movie', 'funny', 'times', 'couple', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'ultimately', 'short', 'being', 'good', 'movie', 'Chow', 'show', 'everyone', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'bigger', 'impact', 'end', 'fell', 'way', 'short', 'expectations', 'Great', 'music', 'also', 'AMAZING', 'cinematography', 'average', 'movie', 'needed', 'least', 'decent', 'ending.The', 'version', 'Mei', 'Eh', 'ok', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'won', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'award', 'best', 'original', 'film', 'song', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'great', 'subtitles', 'may', 'know', 'rare', 'thing', 'songs', 'Chinese', 'movies']",Peace Hotel
