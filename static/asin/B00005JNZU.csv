Keener always finds in her acting the deep emotional truths of her characters, and plays them with honesty and hilarity.  Here she is in fact the anchor of the movie: she puts in proper perspective the wildness and goofiness of Steve Carell and friends.  You should buy all her DVD's immediately.

Maybe it's even a contrived mess, but the results are gratifying--no pun intended!Andy (Carell) is an isolated employee at ""Smart Tech,"" a generic version of something like Best Buy.  There's he's an invisible nerd who has little connection with his fellow employees as he does to significant others at home.  (At least there, he has apartment neighbors, an elderly African-American couple who invite him to participate in fun activities from time to time.) He spends his off time with his valuable, untouched action figure collection and painting figurine models he makes.  Yes, he's a man of hobbies, but he has little to share with a significant other.  Finally, the boys at work invite him for a contraband game of poker after hours at the store.  They share conquistador stories in graphic splendour, but Andy has little to share, so as he loses his breathing, he shares graphic fiction about his imaginary conquests.  Needless to say, once he puts his foot in his mouth, he is caught.  The others make him feel awkward, but then they come to his side with all kinds of advice and invitations to get him into dating situations.  The fun comes with all the disaster!As one might expect, 'The 40 Year-old Virgin' has all the anatomical and other sleazy jokes, but what you might not expect is that the resolution of his dilemma--to get laid--is brought about in a satisfying way--for the audience as well as Andy.

The characters were hilarious. The writers made it so you could love all of them. The main character Andy was played perfect by Steve Carell, who is this generations greatest comedic actor. He was a huge loser who collected action figures (who he talked to by the way) and had never had sex with a woman...but you couldn't help but love him. I'm the kinda guy who quotes my favorite lines from movies, with this movie i can quote almost every line. Almost every scene has some hilarious dialogue in it. As the story progresses, Andy finally meets the woman of his dreams and as the relationship progresses he starts to get nervous that the big day is coming and he will be a flop in bed. The audience can sympathize with the situation because everyone can remember that feeling.

It was funny in the way it shoved real experience right up there in the screen and still managed to be a little detached and funny about it.  The writers of this have said in a magazine interview that it's ""embarrassing"" how easy the script was to write after just sharing with each other some painful sexual stories.  What the film does is present us with a character who, instead of only experiencing some of these stories, experiences them all within a feature length film and comes out alive. What the film depicts around him around are a number of popular mainstream notions on what romance means in the modern world (booze, parties, and sex are just too much fun to spoil on love), or at least what passes for romance.  You get the men who are only interested in sex, the liars, the sensitive guys that got a little taste, but had their hearts broken, the older women who are just in it for a little fun, the younger girls who are having too much fun etc.  The main character flies through all of this information and advice and manages to come out unscathed and with a woman he actually likes (and might love). Whether they get together, or not I'll leave up to your to discover.  I went to see this with my Grandmother and this might not be the best movie to see with your Grandmother to say the least, but despite the risque and crude behavior at times, she really enjoyed it and nearly died laughing.

He's got a cushy job stamping invoices at an electronics superstore, a nice apartment with a proud collection of action figures and comic books, good friends, a nice attitude.When I went to see The 40 Year Old Virgin, I was looking forward to watching a funny movie. Take a look at my list of favourite comedies: Anchorman, Something About Mary, Spaceballs and others. I thought I would be adding this movie to my list. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed.Steve Carell was funny in Anchorman in a sweet dumb way. But in this movie, he comes across as being so angry and resentful that the humour gets lost. The appeal of his sweet virginal character gets lost when his character spends most of his time screaming, yelling and having a hissy fit. There were so many scenes where he could have worked it so that it would have been funny if Steve Carell played it the way Will Farrell did in Anchorman. Will Farrel was lovable even when he was a chauvinistic boor. This is something Steve Carell couldn't pull off. Even when Steve Carell's character was having his chest hair ripped out of his chest during a waxing session, the anger and profanity coming out of his mouth just didn't make the scene funny at all. There were some funny moments in this movie but not enough to make the movie work.I also didn't like the Catherine Keener character very much. I am not sure what exactly it was but I didn't find her appealing nor did I care if she got it on with the Virgin or not. This factor ultimately ruined the movie completely for me. I could care less about this whiny middle aged woman with two kids (who seemed more mature than their flaky mother could ever be). As a side note, I did like the performance of the daughter.I would have rated this movie a 3 but the fact that the movie lasted way too long (2 hours is not fun when it ain't funny).So my final rating for this movie is 2/5.",2,40 minutes too long,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,1983,"['SYNOPSIS40-year-old', 'Andy', 'Stitzer', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'done', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'life', 'got', 'cushy', 'job', 'stamping', 'invoices', 'electronics', 'superstore', 'nice', 'apartment', 'proud', 'collection', 'action', 'figures', 'comic', 'books', 'good', 'friends', 'nice', 'attitude.When', 'went', 'see', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'funny', 'movie', 'Take', 'look', 'list', 'favourite', 'comedies', 'Anchorman', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Spaceballs', 'others', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'adding', 'movie', 'list', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed.Steve', 'Carell', 'was', 'funny', 'Anchorman', 'sweet', 'dumb', 'way', 'movie', 'across', 'being', 'so', 'angry', 'resentful', 'humour', 'lost', 'appeal', 'sweet', 'virginal', 'character', 'lost', 'when', 'character', 'most', 'time', 'screaming', 'yelling', 'having', 'hissy', 'fit', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'played', 'way', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'did', 'Anchorman', 'Will', 'Farrel', 'was', 'lovable', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'chauvinistic', 'boor', 'something', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'Even', 'when', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'character', 'was', 'having', 'chest', 'hair', 'ripped', 'chest', 'waxing', 'session', 'anger', 'profanity', 'coming', 'mouth', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'scene', 'funny', 'were', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'work.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'appealing', 'did', 'care', 'got', 'Virgin', 'not', 'factor', 'ultimately', 'ruined', 'movie', 'completely', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'whiny', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'seemed', 'more', 'mature', 'flaky', 'mother', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'side', 'note', 'did', 'performance', 'daughter.I', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'movie', '3', 'fact', 'movie', 'lasted', 'way', 'too', 'long', '2', 'hours', 'not', 'fun', 'when', 'ai', ""n't"", 'funny', '.So', 'final', 'rating', 'movie', '2/5']",N/A

636672,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JNZU,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Okay, not quite 40 years, but really, I should have seen this a long time ago.I agree with those who say that this film works, but it misses the mark in the end.  I like it, in fact I really like it, but the film works better in certain areas and fails miserably in others.The story is simple.  Andy is forty and he has yet to ever be embraced by a woman.  He is regarded as a nerd and a loser by his fellow employees at an electronics type store until they decide to help pop his cherry.  Giving him advise and pushing him on women gives Andy the confidence needed to fall for a single mother named Trish (hot grandma) and pursue a meaningful relationship with her that transcends the physicality of it all.  But, as should be expected, when the physical stuff does come up, disaster strikes.For me, at times, the film can be too crude for its own good.  Judd Apatow is known for his colorful use of comedy, but for me this film loses some of its heart along the way because of the crudeness.  The scenes that focus on Andy and Trish have such beautiful and sincere chemistry to them that they are offset so drastically by some of the conversations between the other `guys' in the film; so much so that they tarnish the believability (and likeability) of the Andy/Trish relationship.  That is really my largest complaint here, for it is the one that really does the most damage.  I think that one already knows walking in that this is going to be crude (I mean, look at the title) but I was shocked by the heart, and so the two don't seem to mesh well together here.I look at what was done with `Knocked Up' (a better film all around) and even `I Love You, Man' (a MUCH better film all around) and see how they offset the crudeness of the film with the tenderness of the message beautifully, to create a synergy that just wasn't here.The acting is all decent, especially from Keener, who just shines (she should have been Oscar nominated for this over her mediocre work in `Capote').  Seth Rogan and Paul Rudd are hilarious in there supporting roles, and the brilliant Jane Lynch is unforgettable, even if she is just using a regurgitated role from a previous film.  Leslie Mann has a nice cameo (I almost peed) and Elizabeth Banks is brave (VERY MUCH SO).  Steve Carell carries this film nicely and paved the way for him to expound on his talent (he is so mature in `Dan in Real Life').  He is believably awkward (not as much as Rudd in `I Love You, Man', but enough) and that makes him very likable.At times the script suffers from lack off imagination (some of the conversations and `revelations' come off stilted by a lack of grip on the subject) but all in all this is a fun and entertaining ride that offers more than you may bargain for.",4,"Took me 40 years to watch it, but I'm glad I did...",1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,2745,"['Okay', 'not', 'quite', '40', 'years', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'ago.I', 'agree', 'who', 'say', 'film', 'mark', 'end', 'fact', 'really', 'film', 'better', 'certain', 'areas', 'miserably', 'others.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Andy', 'forty', 'yet', 'ever', 'be', 'embraced', 'woman', 'regarded', 'nerd', 'loser', 'fellow', 'employees', 'electronics', 'type', 'store', 'decide', 'help', 'pop', 'cherry', 'Giving', 'advise', 'pushing', 'women', 'Andy', 'confidence', 'needed', 'fall', 'single', 'mother', 'named', 'Trish', 'hot', 'grandma', 'pursue', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'physicality', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'when', 'physical', 'stuff', 'come', 'up', 'disaster', 'strikes.For', 'times', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'crude', 'own', 'good', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'known', 'colorful', 'use', 'comedy', 'film', 'heart', 'way', 'crudeness', 'scenes', 'focus', 'Andy', 'Trish', 'have', 'such', 'beautiful', 'sincere', 'chemistry', 'are', 'offset', 'so', 'drastically', 'conversations', 'other', 'guys', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'tarnish', 'believability', 'likeability', 'Andy/Trish', 'relationship', 'really', 'largest', 'complaint', 'here', 'one', 'really', 'most', 'damage', 'think', 'one', 'already', 'walking', 'going', 'be', 'crude', 'mean', 'look', 'title', 'was', 'shocked', 'heart', 'so', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mesh', 'well', 'together', 'here.I', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'better', 'film', 'even', 'Love', 'Man', 'MUCH', 'better', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'offset', 'crudeness', 'film', 'tenderness', 'message', 'beautifully', 'create', 'synergy', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'here.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'especially', 'Keener', 'who', 'just', 'shines', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'mediocre', 'work', 'Capote', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'are', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'roles', 'brilliant', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'unforgettable', 'even', 'just', 'using', 'regurgitated', 'role', 'previous', 'film', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'nice', 'cameo', 'almost', 'peed', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'brave', 'VERY', 'MUCH', 'SO', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'film', 'nicely', 'paved', 'way', 'expound', 'talent', 'so', 'mature', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'believably', 'awkward', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Rudd', 'Love', 'Man', 'enough', 'very', 'likable.At', 'script', 'suffers', 'lack', 'imagination', 'conversations', 'revelations', 'come', 'stilted', 'lack', 'grip', 'subject', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'more', 'may', 'bargain']",N/A

636674,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JNZU,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 5]","The title pretty much says it all.  This is a movie about a man who at 40 years of age, has never had sex.  Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) had a lot of bad experiences in the past with women (such as kicking a girl in the head when she was licking his toes), and he finally decided to give up on women.  While he does have some behaviors and hobbies that are known to repel women, such as a huge action figure collection and the lack of a car, there isn't anything ""wrong"" or offputting about him.  He's a nice guy who tries to avoid women.Andy works at an electronics store along with Cal (Seth Rogen), Dave (Paul Rudd), and Jay (Romany Malco).  The trio have all had their share of unhealthy relationships, which lead to each of them having different attitudes toward women.  But when they find out Andy has never been with a woman, they make it their collective mission to get him a girl, through any means possible.  From speed-dating (which leads to an encounter with Dave's ex) to advice like ""only ask questions"", Andy is placed in a number of uncomfortable situations.  But he soon meets Trish (Catherine Keener), an attractive woman who works at a ""store"" across the street.  Against the advice of his friends, Andy pursues her, which of course leads to some funny consequences.This movie is incredibly funny, and Carell proves that he can carry a movie.  He may appear to be fit for the goofy side man role, he is hilarious, has great comedic timing, and is very likeable.  The supporting cast is great as well.  Rogen is great as Cal (he played the character Ron on Undeclared, a show by Judd Apatow, the writer/director of the film, and was one of my favorite characters).I knew that this movie was going to have a lot of sexual innuendo in it (after all, it's called The 40 Year-Old Virgin), but I wasn't expecting all the nudity, cursing, and references in it.  I wasn't offended or put off by it, I just didn't realize how heavy it would be.  There were scenes were they were watching pornography, they were at a sex club and were playing with sex toys, and at the speed dating place, there was this one woman... well, I won't ruin it for you.However, even though this movie is really dirty, Apatow and Carell find a way to not only make it smart, but to give it heart.  We find ourselves caring about Andy, and we can actually understand why he is the way he is.  There's nothing wrong with him, he just chose to live his life differently than most people.Normally at this point in the review for such a movie, I would say that the film isn't for everyone, seeing as to the levels of sexual humor.  However, there were a bunch of people in the theater where I saw this who I would presume would hate such a movie.  But many of those very people loved it!  So, go see this movie.

But what a funny stretch it is(just be thankful the deleted scenes were not left in as some of those scenes you begin to say, ""what's the point!"").One eye-popping deleted scene with adult star Stormy Daniels (Andy's fantasy woman) would have definitely raised eyebrows and pulses as well as the movie rating. Rent the unrated dvd and you'll know what I'm talking about. Wow !... Most comedies of this nature are known to be anywhere from 88 minutes to 94 minutes tops...I actually and thoroughly enjoyed The 40 Year Old Virgin.Plot or simple storyline may be predictable as well as the outcome, but so what. This movie is not rocket science. You can't scrutinize it that way either. Is it the funniest film ever? Hardly. The performance by Steve Carell is simply hilarious and outrageous! The guy is one of those comedic actors that just, simply put, has a funny mug. It may be expressionless or dead pan serious looking most of the time, but I cannot recall an actor or comedian in so long that can deliver such sharp and humorous dialogue and wit with such straight faced conviction! You just have to see the funny scene of words exchanged between one of his friend's girlfriends in the electronics store who thinks that Andy is a real sleaze with women instead of the naive virgin he really is (she has no clue that Andy, under the pleading insistance of his friend, is covering up for her boyfriend who is the real sleaze)!...It is a typical premise where these so-called friends, after discovering Andy's secret of being a virgin, are on a crusade and mission to get him ""experienced"".They offer Andy some of the worst advice and are no better experienced themselves when it comes to matters of the heart and the subject of understanding women.The advice and tips they offer are so out of left field, that Andy even questions their true intentions in helping him. One friend(Paul Rudd) is in  stalker territory when it comes to his ex-girlfriend.Another friend, Cal, played by Seth Rogen (whose a bit of a ""novelist"" or philosopher) goes to sex shows in Tijuana. Cal is probably the only one that provides some semblance of sound advice about listening to women and asking them questions. The third friend is all about scoring with other women despite the fact he has a girlfriend already---he constantly tells Andy to chill out and ""stop putting the p____ on a pedestal"". These guys are so flawed which plays into the comical energy of the film.Soon, Andy Stitzer becomes frustrated with the dating advice as his head is about to explode with so many wrong ideas that the trio of buddies have given him.It is in the scenes with his dates and experiences that start to almost have a Deuce Bigelow feel as he encounters each adventure in the meat market realm. Catherine Keener does an admirable acting job as the ""sexy granny"" that finally pulls on Andy's heartstrings and interest in finding that special someone! I first saw Keener a few years ago in the dark comedy Death to Smoochy with Robin Williams and Edward Norton. She portrayed a frigid and cutthroat t.v. exec or writer for a children's show a la Barney.Great performance and another comedy I would also recommend. I will say that one obvious let down is comedic actress Jane Lynch's role as Paula, the dry and sarcastic electronic's store floor manager. Turns out Paula wouldn't mind breaking Andy in. The let down is that you expect her to have more comical interaction  with Carell's character, but the occasion never materializes...You will feel that her character or screen time is subdued or held back from unleashing into great comedic heights---what a waste.Don't look for deep and intrinsic material here. This is a comedy and nothing more. Take it at face value and you will thoroughly enjoy it and have many a good laugh. Analyze it too hard and it's like watching a sci-fi movie and saying,""That is so not real!""

Upon going to the theater to see 40 Year Old Virgin I thought I was going to be disappointed and figured the movie would contain a lot of stupid sexual jokes. Man was I wrong, well for the most part anyway.First off I should note that this film is in fact jam packed with sexual references, jokes, and downright dirty humor, in most cases it is borderline intelligent which will leave the adult audience quite pleased. But this comment isn't to be taken lightly, if you are one to get offended by modern slang as it pertains to sexual related material than this movie is most certainly not for you, but if you can overlook such material (or find it all the more amusing), than give 40 Year Old Virgin a try.Interestingly this film doesn't seem to follow other comedies as of late. This story isn't about a bunch of teens looking to get laid; instead this is a movie about a 40 year old virgin male and the interaction between him and his adult friends. His friends have had sex in the past and try to get him to get romantically involved with a woman. Unconventional? Slightly, and it makes for a pretty good movie! While it isn't terribly original, it sure as heck is something worth noting considering the amount of crappy comedy movies released as of late.The film turns out to be a real gem since the main character is both loveable as well as pitiable. One can easily understand why he's a virgin (for good or ill), or at least how he's stayed a virgin for so long: into things only children would be into (collecting dolls for instance), the main characters adorable personality shines through with the actor's bright smiles and blissful way of acting the part of the dorky virgin.Of course this by no means is the recipe for a hands-down blockbuster, far from it, in good faith I can't possibly give 40 Year Old Virgin 5 stars, but 4 stars it more than adequately deserves seeing as how it is highly entertaining. Again the problem with the movie seems to be what kind of people go and see it - older audiences might be attracted by the name in hopes of seeing more intelligent humor and a lot less intense sexual language, whereas young adults-to-mid adults might be more forgiving, able take the movie for what it is, and find it a lot more appealing.If you're willing to overlook the flaws, I'd give 40 Year Old Virgin a rent - it's certainly worth that, and if for some reason you become hooked on it than by all means buy it.

What I like most about this character is that even though he is in fact a 40 year old virgin, he doesn't spend his time watching porn on TV or staring at graphic photos on the web-- he's a total innocent... says Andy, ""I respect women so much that I stay away from them.""Andy spent his high school and college years attempting to get laid, but it never worked out. He would always screw it up in some way; he once gave a girl a bloody nose after kicking her in the face because she was licking his ticklish feet. So eventually he just gave up and put his focus on his hobbies (videogaming and collecting toys like G.I. Joes). He rides his bike to work everyday (he doesn't own a car, nor does he know how to drive one) and hangs out in the back by himself. One day a few guys at Andy's workplace invite him to play poker, and it's this fateful game that Andy's ""secret"" comes out. His new found friends devote themselves to finally getting Andy some action. These guys act like Andy has some kind of problem, when he really doesn't, and we discover along with Andy that it's not him with the problem, but the people around him.I definitely reccomend seeing this movie. It's a well-written, well played out comedy that deserves everyone's attention. It's great to finally see Steve Carrell front and center (have you seen the movie poster, by the way?

The last decade or so, most comedies seem to go for the raunch and for the gross out, juvenile humor. Thank god!. I love it. I enjoy it, even if it's against my better judgement. There will always be a part of me that loves and devours that type of humor, and I hope it never goes away. This latest film in such a genre is not as outrageous or extreme as people make it out to be. It's no Hallmark movie, but it isn't what I hear a lot of people saying it is. It does seem to be quite fond of the F word, since it appears that every word is that particular one. First off, the plot. Andy(Steve Carrell), is a 40 year old man living in a toy collectible crammed apartment and who works at an electronics store. But during a game of poker with his co-workers, it comes out that Andy is a virgin. Now, his co-workers are determined to get poor Andy into bed with someone. He meets a girl(Catherine Keener), begins a relationship, and she says that they should not have sex. What is Andy to do?. The premise is right there, and you couldn't of asked for anyone better than Carrell. He is fantastic. However, I felt that the movie was not as tender or heartwarming as it is trying to be. Or as I heard others say. Most of it never rang true to me at all. It goes from one joke to another and then drops something that is supposed to be genuine and heartfelt, and I just wasn't feeling it. Andy is a good character and Carrell really develops him and brings him to life, but it's the situations around him that don't live quite up to the character himself. The supporting cast is great. Paul Rudd is funny, and he seems to be the go too guy for a funny buddy or whatnot. Seth Rogen, who is also co-producer, may be the best. Keener is good in her role. I've never been a fan, but she holds her own with the material and against the guys. Jane Lynch is hysterical. I have always been a fan from her work with Christopher Guest, and she is funny here. The deleted scene with her and Rogen is hilarious and seems improvised. I've laughed a lot harder watching other movies, and I've been touched more by other movies(some that were raunchier than this!), but that isn't saying this movie is without merit. The film is well done for it's kind, and it has one great comedic cast. There are some good hearty laughs here too. Some laugh out loud. But most importantly, it has Carrell. The man is a genius. From ""The Daily Show"" to ""The Office"", he is a comedy find. I hope to see bigger things for him in the future. I never saw the theatrical version, so I don't know if there is something new in here or not. This version does run on a bit too long for this kind of movie, and this longer cut does make it feel somewhat bloated and weakens the movie overall. The 40 Year Old Virgin is not the best, but there are some definite laughs involved.",3,"""I'm Pretty Sure He's A Serial Murderer...""",1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,2955,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'raunchy', 'comedies', 'make', 'laugh', 'was', 'time', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'most', 'comedies', 'seem', 'go', 'raunch', 'gross', 'out', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'Thank', 'god', 'love', 'enjoy', 'even', 'better', 'judgement', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'part', 'type', 'humor', 'hope', 'never', 'away', 'latest', 'film', 'genre', 'not', 'as', 'outrageous', 'extreme', 'people', 'make', 'be', 'Hallmark', 'movie', ""n't"", 'what', 'hear', 'lot', 'people', 'saying', 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'fond', 'F', 'word', 'word', 'particular', 'one', 'First', 'plot', 'Andy', 'Steve', 'Carrell', '40', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'living', 'toy', 'collectible', 'crammed', 'apartment', 'who', 'electronics', 'store', 'game', 'poker', 'co-workers', 'out', 'Andy', 'virgin', 'Now', 'co-workers', 'are', 'determined', 'get', 'poor', 'Andy', 'bed', 'someone', 'girl', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'relationship', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'What', 'Andy', 'do', 'premise', 'right', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'asked', 'anyone', 'better', 'Carrell', 'fantastic', 'However', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'tender', 'heartwarming', 'trying', 'be', 'heard', 'others', 'say', 'Most', 'never', 'rang', 'true', 'one', 'joke', 'then', 'drops', 'something', 'supposed', 'be', 'genuine', 'heartfelt', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'Andy', 'good', 'character', 'Carrell', 'really', 'life', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'quite', 'up', 'character', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'funny', 'be', 'go', 'too', 'guy', 'funny', 'buddy', 'whatnot', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'who', 'also', 'co-producer', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Keener', 'good', 'role', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'own', 'material', 'guys', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'hysterical', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'work', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'funny', 'here', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Rogen', 'hilarious', 'improvised', ""'ve"", 'laughed', 'lot', 'harder', 'watching', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'been', 'touched', 'more', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'raunchier', ""n't"", 'saying', 'movie', 'merit', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'kind', 'one', 'great', 'comedic', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'hearty', 'laughs', 'here', 'too', 'out', 'loud', 'most', 'importantly', 'Carrell', 'man', 'genius', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Office', 'comedy', 'find', 'hope', 'see', 'bigger', 'things', 'future', 'never', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'something', 'new', 'here', 'not', 'version', 'run', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'kind', 'movie', 'longer', 'cut', 'make', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'bloated', 'movie', 'overall', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'not', 'best', 'are', 'definite', 'laughs', 'involved']",N/A

This movie is full of swearing and sexual innuendo, so be careful who you watch it around.  I waited until the wife and kids were out of town before I watched the R-rated version.  I've heard from various sources the unrated version is not nearly as good a movie.Steve Carrell, whose career is booming because of The Office and the upcoming Evan Almighty, plays Andy.  Andy is forty and works at a Best Buy type store as a stock clerk.  Three guys, Cal, David and Jay need a partner for their poker game and invite the nerdy Andy.  Andy comes and during the course of the evening reveals he is a virgin.  Of course, the next day everyone at the store knows about it.  Cal, David and Jay take it upon themselves to end Andy's celibacy.  These three guys are great in the movie as well.  They are given moments to shine in areas unrelated to the plot.  Rudd is really funny, a great sidekick.  Andy goes through various misadventures as the guys try to hook him up and impart their own views of sexuality on Andy.Steve Carrell, as Andy, is the hit of the movie.  He plays Andy with incredible innocence who is content on being a virgin the rest of his life.  Spurred on by these new friends, he embarks on drinking and cussing and hitting on girls; behaviours he is not used to.  Slowly, Andy develops courage, courage he will need when he meets Trish, played by Catherine Keener.  Trish is about his age and has three kids and even an grandbaby.One reviewer stated it was a fault that the movie that it didn't exploit Andy's virginity enough for laughs.  I thought that was a plus, as it allowed the characters to shine.  If this had been a one joke movie, it would have gotten old really fast.  Looking back, I don't really know if the movie had a message.  But as a person who believes you should actually wait until marriage to have sex, I certainly wasn't offended.  Cal, David and Jay all lead promiscious lives and in the end don't really want Andy to be like them.  They want him to be with Trish.If you liked the Wedding Crashers, you'll probably like this too.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 10]","The 40 Year Old Virgin is an adult comedy that tries too hard to be funny by infusing vulgarity and crude anti-social male behavior at nearly every turn (ala THE ARISTOCRATS).It doesn't miss the mark completely, but the attempts at portraying a message of some significance get consistently marred by foul jokes that pull the viewer away from any true meaning. I realize this is a ""comedy"", but the message of what it's truly like to be a 40 year old virgin is never fully realized. All we know is that Andy (Steve Carell, The Daily Show) is a pretty boring virginal guy who collects action figures, works at an electronics store, and has never had sex with a woman in all his 40 years. This seems like a pretty shallow character representation ...and it is.Where the comedy comes in is when Andy's fellow male coworkers discover his lifelong secret. They try to help him out by giving advice, introducing him to loose women, and trying to change his body image (the chest waxing was painful to watch, funny, and gross).Andy finally meets Trish (Catherine Keener, CAPOTE) and falls head over heels in love. But his attempts to get close to her are stifled by his coworkers' advice and his lack of understanding of sexual behavior. This is where the comedy really could've gotten a leg-up on other shallow comedies (ex. DATE MOVIE) but doesn't take advantage of the opportunity. Instead we're given continual bathroom humor obviously directed at the teen movie-going crowd.After finishing the film I had to ask myself if I really cared whether or not Andy got laid.

636695,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B00005JNZU,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[1, 1]","Right up front I'll admit that Steve Carell freaks me out.  And I was a little worried about the objectification of women throughout this film. There is more cursing in ""Virgin"" than any other movie I've ever seen.  Despite all the weird behavior, demeaning sexual situations, and the cursing, I enjoyed the movie because the characters in this movie basically care for one another, and the improvisation methods the director used to produce the film led to some fantasic humor.  The DVD had some great bonus material.  Be sure to check out the ""one liners,"" and the ""date-a-palooza"" sections.The interactions between the guys at the store were fairly realistic, which is to say, that's how I behaved with the guys I used to work with at the shoe store (although I'll admit I was in my teens back then).  We took breaks out back where we would talk about girls and cars, and break flourescent lamps against the dumpsters and each other.Catherine Keener, in the Directors words, ""...unlike the rest of us, was actually an accomplished actor.  She brought a level of professionalism that would otherwise have been missing from the set...""  She brought alot more than that.  She brought believability to the Carell love interest, and ""deobjectification"" (I made that word up just now.  Don't play scrabble with me) to the female lead.  Basically, she was perfect for the role.The Director would bring minimal scripts to the scenes, asking the actors to improvise most of the dialoge. He'd ask for multiple takes, and the great results reflected the quality of the supporting cast, and the individual contributions they all made to the humor.I think the movie worked for me because the Director was consistent with the fundamental character development.  Particularly important, he kept the vigin a naive, likeable innocent.  This was one DVD where my review of the deleted scenes left me in agreement with the deletions - usually I think some of the better material is left out - not the case here.A large part of the laughs come at the expense of the men themselves, and I think this was an important part of why ""Virgin"" has some endearing quality, and maybe the only way in which you could consider the characters mature - they are very good at laughing at themselves, which makes it so much easier for us to laugh at them too.",4,Improvisational Comedy,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,2327,"['Right', 'up', 'front', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'freaks', 'out', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'objectification', 'women', 'film', 'more', 'cursing', 'Virgin', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'weird', 'behavior', 'demeaning', 'sexual', 'situations', 'cursing', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'characters', 'movie', 'basically', 'care', 'one', 'improvisation', 'director', 'used', 'produce', 'film', 'led', 'fantasic', 'humor', 'DVD', 'had', 'great', 'bonus', 'material', 'Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'one', 'liners', 'date-a-palooza', 'sections.The', 'interactions', 'guys', 'store', 'were', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'say', 'how', 'behaved', 'guys', 'used', 'work', 'shoe', 'store', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'teens', 'back', 'then', 'took', 'breaks', 'out', 'back', 'where', 'would', 'talk', 'girls', 'cars', 'break', 'flourescent', 'lamps', 'dumpsters', 'other.Catherine', 'Keener', 'Directors', 'words', 'rest', 'was', 'actually', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'brought', 'level', 'professionalism', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'set', 'brought', 'alot', 'more', 'brought', 'believability', 'Carell', 'love', 'interest', 'deobjectification', 'made', 'word', 'up', 'just', 'now', 'Do', ""n't"", 'play', 'scrabble', 'female', 'lead', 'Basically', 'was', 'perfect', 'role.The', 'Director', 'would', 'bring', 'minimal', 'scripts', 'scenes', 'asking', 'actors', 'improvise', 'most', 'dialoge', ""'d"", 'ask', 'multiple', 'great', 'results', 'reflected', 'quality', 'supporting', 'cast', 'individual', 'contributions', 'made', 'humor.I', 'think', 'movie', 'worked', 'Director', 'was', 'consistent', 'fundamental', 'character', 'development', 'Particularly', 'important', 'kept', 'vigin', 'naive', 'likeable', 'innocent', 'was', 'one', 'DVD', 'where', 'review', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'left', 'agreement', 'deletions', 'usually', 'think', 'better', 'material', 'left', 'out', 'not', 'case', 'here.A', 'large', 'part', 'laughs', 'come', 'expense', 'men', 'think', 'was', 'important', 'part', 'why', 'Virgin', 'endearing', 'quality', 'maybe', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'consider', 'characters', 'mature', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'laughing', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'laugh', 'too']",N/A

636697,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B00005JNZU,Boggman!,"[2, 4]","""The 40yr Old Virgin"" emerges not only as 2005's best summer comedy, but probably the best comedy of the year!This is one crowd pleasing, feel good movie that starts off with a laugh, and ends with one too. Steve Carell does a magnificient job of bringing Andy Stitzer to life. Whether YOUR a virgin or not, there is a little bit of Andy in all of us. Andy is a great comedic triumph for Carrell, considering it's such a departure from his shovanistic ego-centric Michael on the NBS hit comedy ""The Office"".The plot is simple: 3 of Andy's coworkers find out over a game of poker and some sex swapping stories that Andy is a virgin and set out to make a man out of him once and for all! Nuff said.What ensues is Andy learning the masterful art of picking up woman, making friends (which he doesn't seem to have to many of), dealing with the fact that everyone at work knows about his non existant sex life, and learning to fall in love.This movie has so many laughs it would be a shame to list them here. The chest/waxing scene emerges as pretty darn funny- and there is a lot more to it than what you get on the commercial previews. This is also a great buddy movie that paints an honest/relatable portrait of friends, new romances, and workplace relationships. It's just a funny frieken movie all the way around!!This film is a masterpiece. It really is. You definitely will laugh your A*S off!! Worth the price of admission and more!

In fact, it rejoins a couple of the supporting cast of that film, starring the guy who played ""Brick"" who, in my opinion, stole that show with his clueless stares and inane ramblings. Andy, the 40-year-old virgin, is being ""helped"" with his ""problem"" by his male coworkers, who are all so completely dysfunctional that they really don't have any business trying to repair anyone else's private life. The fact that Andy also still rides a bicycle and is chided by his coworkers for that, too, just seems to emphasize that modern society has turned virginity into a stigma similar to not being able to pass a driving test. Along the way, in his awkward quest to meet women, Andy encounters a parade of human oddities that are the source of some great low-brow humor. This includes a habitual drunk driving offender who literally has trouble ""holding"" her liquor, a very masculine call girl, and a young woman who has very interesting uses for bathroom fixtures. Instead of wanting to lose his virginity, though, what Andy really wants is a relationship with the nice woman running a store across the street from where he works. The resulting story is actually a rather sweet romance buried underneath all of the Man Show style humor.I wondered if Steve Carell could actually carry a movie by himself, but he pulls it off very well. The one bad thing I will say about this movie is that it seemed about 20-25 minutes longer than it should have been.

636708,AOXC7HI3O8JWI,B00005JNZU,"Carlo San Juan ""Caz MD""","[0, 0]","It is rare for a comedy to have a protagonist whose dilemma is so basic, so inherently primal in every human being yet whose solution is so understandably elusive that everyone who watches the film would really scream from within, ""YOU CAN DO IT!""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin goes way beyond the humor of crude sex comedies like Porky's and even American Pie.  Here you have a character you care about and really wish could succeed in his challenge.  And as a movie this is the most creative, innovative, and by far best comedy of the year.The movie centers on Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) who is, as the title describes, a 40 year-old virgin.  He lives in a very self-sustaining ecosystem, which doesn't mean he's enjoying his life.  He wakes up, goes through a morning routine of bathing and working out using those ""home gyms"" you always see on infomercials, goes to work in the stock room of a home entertainment store, and then goes home to his apartment to read comics, play video games, or watch TV with his neighbors.  But yes, he pretty much keeps to himself.He then gets reluctantly invited to a poker night where it is suddenly revealed to his co-workers that he is a virgin.  His co-workers, who feel that his ""condition"" is a plight that must be surmounted become personal missions to each of them.This is where the film reaches a rare level of color.  As Roger Ebert describes in his review, ""The buddies are wonderfully cast. David (Paul Rudd) is still hopelessly in love with a woman who has long since outgrown any possible interest in him; Jay (Romany Malco) is a ladies' man who considers himself an irresistible seducer, and Cal (Seth Rogen) is the guy with practical guidance, such as `date drunks' and `never actually say anything to a woman; just ask questions.' All these guys have problems of their own, and seem prepared to pass them on to Andy as advice; listen with particular care to the definition of `aftercourse.' (sic) Also at work is Paula (Jane Lynch), Andy's boss, a tall, striking woman who is definitely not a 40-year-old virgin; after asking him if he's ever heard of just being sex buddies, she promises him, `I'm discreet, and I'll haunt your dreams.'""  I couldn't have put it better myself.The main love interest of the film is Trish (Catherine Keener), who runs a store across from Andy's, and sells stuff for you on Ebay (while I haven't heard of a store like this before, I wouldn't be surprised if there was such a thing).  When things get going between her and Andy, the virginity becomes secondary and we actually begin to care about their relationship.While all these characters are people who in other films would be dealt with a degree of offensiveness, The 40 Year-Old-Virgin succeeds in having sincere fun and understanding with them.  The movie has an undercurrent of humanity that we all can connect with.  You may somehow suddenly feel that you're laughing at yourselves in the theater and any movie who can poke us in that way is definitely worth seeing.I'd like to point out that I saw this film with a fellow geek who, like I, could understand Andy's passion for collecting.

636724,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00005JNZU,Clare Quilty,"[3, 3]","I have to take issue with a reviewer who said ""Virgin"" is ""extremely demeaning to women"" and just left it at that, offering nothing to back up such an unfair, reactionary claim.This is a comedy that's really about how single people over 30 meet, date and form a bond -- sure, twentysomethings get all the attention because they're hotter, but not everybody is married by their 30s and they face far more treacherous terrain out there.Yes, ""Virgin"" has some female characters who are broadly flawed comic figures but then again the majority of male characters are also pretty messed up too (I mean, c'mon, the title character is a man who has made it to 40 without ever managing to consumate a relationship).What that reviewer seems oblivious to was that this is a high-profile studio vehicle that has a heroine, played by Catherine Keener, who is in her early 40s, is a single parent and a single *grandmother* for God sake. That's rare enough for a mainstream movie, but even more importantly, she's one of the nicest, coolest, sweetest, sexiest characters I've seen in a movie in a long time.  I'm really glad ""Virgin"" is doing well critically and commercially because we need more movies that present characters with that kind of diversity, even if it's just in a farce.I also liked Steve Carrell, who actually convinced me that a character in his circumstances might not be *that* screwed up (whether it's true or not), but be just a sensitive, thoughtful introvert who let time get away from him.And even though I found their characters ""extremely demeaning"" to men (in an honest way, of course) Seth Rogan and Paul Rudd were both very, very funny -- I have no way to properly explain it but Rudd's ""Employee of the Month: Jan. 1999"" T-shirt alone sent me into mild seizures of hysterics.And to address another complaint by the same previous reviewer, the manner in which the characters all became friends wasn't unrealistic but was, in fact, a lot like the way people become friends in real life, at real jobs.  Not everybody hits it off right away, but you probably don't need to me to tell you that.",4,"R-rated for raunchiness, but still a smart, funny, surprisingly sweet comedy",1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,2107,"['have', 'take', 'issue', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'Virgin', 'extremely', 'demeaning', 'women', 'just', 'left', 'offering', 'nothing', 'back', 'up', 'such', 'unfair', 'reactionary', 'claim.This', 'comedy', 'really', 'how', 'single', 'people', '30', 'meet', 'date', 'form', 'bond', 'sure', 'twentysomethings', 'get', 'attention', ""'re"", 'hotter', 'not', 'everybody', 'married', '30s', 'face', 'far', 'more', 'treacherous', 'terrain', 'there.Yes', 'Virgin', 'female', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'broadly', 'flawed', 'comic', 'figures', 'then', 'again', 'majority', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'messed', 'up', 'too', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'title', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'made', '40', 'ever', 'managing', 'consumate', 'relationship', '.What', 'reviewer', 'oblivious', 'was', 'high-profile', 'studio', 'vehicle', 'heroine', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'who', 'early', '40s', 'single', 'parent', 'single', '*grandmother*', 'God', 'sake', 'rare', 'enough', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'one', 'nicest', 'coolest', 'sweetest', 'sexiest', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'Virgin', 'doing', 'well', 'critically', 'commercially', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'present', 'characters', 'kind', 'diversity', 'even', 'just', 'farce.I', 'also', 'liked', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'who', 'actually', 'convinced', 'character', 'circumstances', 'might', 'not', 'be', '*that*', 'screwed', 'up', 'true', 'not', 'be', 'just', 'sensitive', 'thoughtful', 'introvert', 'who', 'let', 'time', 'get', 'away', 'him.And', 'even', 'found', 'characters', 'extremely', 'demeaning', 'men', 'honest', 'way', 'course', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'have', 'way', 'properly', 'explain', 'Rudd', 'Employee', 'Month', 'Jan.', '1999', 'T-shirt', 'alone', 'sent', 'mild', 'seizures', 'hysterics.And', 'address', 'complaint', 'same', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'manner', 'characters', 'became', 'friends', 'was', ""n't"", 'unrealistic', 'was', 'fact', 'lot', 'way', 'people', 'become', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'jobs', 'Not', 'everybody', 'off', 'right', 'away', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell']",N/A
636725,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JNZU,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 4]","Well, maybe it was funny. But it wasn't hysterically funny I should say. The idea of a virgin being 40 years old should've proved a lot more comedy and slapstick gags but instead we have scenes that just go on but they weren't funny in the first place(like a scene where 2 black people argue, not being racist, just that scene went nowhere).Andy is a happy guy: he watches Survivor with his building buddies, works at an electronics store and collects action figures. Only, and where the title comes in handy, he's never even had sex. His friends find out and decide to help the guy out only he doesn't need help and his idea of losing it isn't what they're thinking of.While he has some mishaps with some women, he meets Trish, a woman who sells things on Ebay at her own store(which quite frankly is just stupid). Only unlike some guys, he wants to lose it to someone he loves despite the fact an older woman who really wants him and a sex freak he met a bar is after him too.I can kind of identify with the Andy character. A guy who has a comfortable little niche that unfortunately has a couple problems. Andy's a very socially awkward guy that isn't very good at talking to regular people most of the time, so picking up a girl isn't very successful.If there's one problem with the film is that there's certain missed opportunities. One character named Mooj is quite funny being incredibly profane yet they don't give him enough screen time.  Then there's the previous scene where the 2 black people argue and it felt out of place like you felt like ""who cares?"". A ""you know how I know you're gay?"" scene never made me laugh once. Plus the one subplot with Andy's horny boss literally went nowhere and there was no resolution. Like I said, there were certain parts where I laughed but then I quieted down a bit.What does make the film work is the casting. Steve Carrell is great as the awkward Andy and underrated Catherine Keener is perfect as Trish(not to mention very hot). Andy's buddies too are also great and Elizabeth Banks as the sex freak was also good even if it was obvious Andy wasn't going to do anything with her.It's a funny film that dropped the ball on certain scenes or missed jokes but if you wanna laugh with your friends, give it a watch.",4,In the words of Ralph Wiggum: it was funny but wasn't ha-ha funny,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2265,"['Well', 'maybe', 'was', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'hysterically', 'funny', 'should', 'say', 'idea', 'virgin', 'being', '40', 'years', 'old', 'should', ""'ve"", 'proved', 'lot', 'more', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'gags', 'instead', 'have', 'scenes', 'just', 'go', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'first', 'place', 'scene', 'where', '2', 'black', 'people', 'argue', 'not', 'being', 'racist', 'just', 'scene', 'went', 'nowhere', '.Andy', 'happy', 'guy', 'Survivor', 'building', 'buddies', 'works', 'electronics', 'store', 'collects', 'action', 'figures', 'Only', 'where', 'title', 'handy', 'never', 'even', 'had', 'sex', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'decide', 'help', 'guy', 'only', ""n't"", 'need', 'help', 'idea', 'losing', ""n't"", 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'of.While', 'mishaps', 'women', 'Trish', 'woman', 'who', 'things', 'Ebay', 'own', 'store', 'quite', 'just', 'stupid', 'Only', 'guys', 'lose', 'someone', 'fact', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'really', 'sex', 'freak', 'met', 'bar', 'too.I', 'can', 'kind', 'identify', 'Andy', 'character', 'guy', 'who', 'comfortable', 'little', 'niche', 'unfortunately', 'couple', 'problems', 'Andy', 'very', 'socially', 'awkward', 'guy', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'talking', 'regular', 'people', 'most', 'time', 'so', 'picking', 'up', 'girl', ""n't"", 'very', 'successful.If', 'one', 'problem', 'film', 'certain', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'One', 'character', 'named', 'Mooj', 'quite', 'funny', 'being', 'incredibly', 'profane', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'Then', 'previous', 'scene', 'where', '2', 'black', 'people', 'argue', 'felt', 'place', 'felt', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'know', ""'re"", 'gay', 'scene', 'never', 'made', 'laugh', 'once', 'one', 'subplot', 'Andy', 'horny', 'boss', 'literally', 'went', 'nowhere', 'was', 'resolution', 'said', 'were', 'certain', 'parts', 'where', 'laughed', 'then', 'quieted', 'down', 'bit.What', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'casting', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'great', 'awkward', 'Andy', 'underrated', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'perfect', 'Trish', 'not', 'mention', 'very', 'hot', 'Andy', 'buddies', 'too', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'sex', 'freak', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'even', 'was', 'obvious', 'Andy', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'do', 'anything', 'her.It', 'funny', 'film', 'dropped', 'ball', 'certain', 'scenes', 'missed', 'jokes', 'wan', 'friends', 'give', 'watch']",N/A

A few years ago it was My Big Fat Greek Wedding that was a surprise hit, and a few years before that it was The Blair Witch Project. This film is superior to both of those earlier films, and has more in common with another sleeper film that predated both of those films, 1998's Office Space, which was one of the first films to flop theatrically, yet become a big hit on the then-new DVD format. The 40-Year-Old Virgin shares a similar sensibility toward the dullness of the work environment (this time a Circuit City/Best Buy like electronics store vs. a computer programming company, but its satire of the workplace is dead on.The difference between The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Office Space, however, is that the bulk of the newer film focuses on the personal lives of its lead character and his co-workers David (Paul Rudd)- who's stalking his ex-girlfriend, Jay (Romany Malco)- a black, bald Lothario, and Cal (Seth Rogen)- an ugly, bearded wannabe novelist, who make it their mission to get him laid at any cost. Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell, of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and the NBC tv show The Office) is a collector of `action figures' from the 1970s and 1980s (such as The Six Million Dollar Man's boss, Oscar Goldman), avid Survivor watcher, along with an old black neighbor, has a framed Asia rock poster, a ton of video games, and has somehow never managed to get laid in his four decades, although he's come close. Any male who has pined for females that he never got to be with will be able to relate to Andy's dilemma- if not to the extent of Andy's angst, certainly the gist of it. His co-worker's advice ranges from the bad to the ridiculous, as each of them could easily be termed loser, as well. He agrees to go out with his pals, and ends up being puked on by a gorgeous, but drunken blond named Nicky (Leslie Mann), who nearly gets them both killed with her driving. He then hits on Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a sexpot at the local bookstore, and succeeds in getting her interested. That's when he meets a sexy and kind divorced grandmother named Trish (Catherine Keener), who runs an EBay store at the same mall where Andy's store is....

The aid comes in the forms of speed dating, roaming the singles bars, hitting on book store clerks, and propositioning the showroom's customers where Andy meets an attractive woman, Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who has a small business.  The two instantly hit it off, but when it comes time to consummate the relationship, things go awry and Andy becomes more despondent when he cannot bear to reveal his deep secret to the woman he loves.  It's time for a momentous decision in Andy's life.Carell co produced and stars in what is his pet project.  Judd Apatow (The Larry Sanders Show) directs the script he cowrote with Carell.  True, some of the jokes crash and burn badly or misfire and fizzle, but enough keeps coming to raise some good roaring fun. As Andy, Carell plays an everyman kind of role, and his friends who on surface seem like chauvinistic frat boys, do care and come to his aid in an endearing spirit.  He is so adept at the nuances and exaggerated movements of physical comedy that he needs to exploit them further (as he will in the big screen remake of the TV spy show, Get Smart).  Among the numerous scenes, the standout and most talked about one is the infamous hair removal at a waxing clinic where Andy attempts to make himself more physically appealing.  The results are disastrous, and it is well known that Carell performed the scene for real and suffered for his `art'.  Catherine Keener is a breath of fresh air and quite appealing in her realistic role of a single mother looking for love in the most unlikely of places.  The relationship between Trish and Andy develops earnestly and serves to anchor the sillier aspects of the storyline.  And there is silly aplenty with some outrageous lines of dialogue and vulgar asides.  In some ways, this is about a man who finds his own sense of manhood and maturity after being a boy for a long time. There are subplots involving each of the guys that are amusing but don't really add anything to the story.  Also good is the developing relationship Andy has with Trish's daughter.  The final scene is pretty nutty and clever as the credits roll.On the surface, this film would appear to have all the ingredients for an over-the-top comedy like Animal House or American Pie.  Indeed, there are a couple of scenes that are quite sexually explicit.  It takes its R rating seriously.  Don't be misled. This is not a one note comedy but rather a romantic tale.  At its heart, it has a well intentioned theme of longing and frustration with some genuine compassion.  If you go in knowing you may be grossed out at times but still induced to laughter, then that pretty much sums up the appeal of this energetic film.  In a star making turn, Carell is one to watch for quite some time.",4,THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN is Naughty Fun,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,3692,"['Steve', 'Carell', 'been', 'fixture', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'years', 'had', 'scene', 'stealing', 'minor', 'roles', 'feature', 'films', 'Anchorman', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'first', 'starring', 'role', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'struck', 'pay', 'dirt', 'crude', 'humor', 'times', 'graphic', 'display', 'sexual', 'conduct', 'film', 'core', 'story', 'most', 'gross', 'comedies', 'keep', 'funny', 'lines', 'coming', 'fast', 'enough', 'amuse', 'most.Andy', 'Stitzer', 'painfully', 'shy', '40', 'year', 'old', 'service', 'tech', 'electronic', 'entertainment', 'showroom', 'friends', 'three', 'salesmen', 'who', 'soon', 'find', 'poker', 'game', 'Andy', 'virgin', 'never', 'having', 'had', 'sex', 'woman', 'Andy', 'never', 'got', 'around', 'experience', 'attempts', 'are', 'hilariously', 'recalled', 'Andy', 'humiliated', 'embarrassed', 'barbs', 'jokes', 'expense', 'buddies', 'band', 'together', 'help', 'fledgling', 'aid', 'forms', 'speed', 'dating', 'roaming', 'singles', 'bars', 'hitting', 'book', 'store', 'clerks', 'propositioning', 'showroom', 'customers', 'where', 'Andy', 'attractive', 'woman', 'Trish', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'small', 'business', 'two', 'instantly', 'hit', 'off', 'when', 'time', 'consummate', 'relationship', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'Andy', 'more', 'despondent', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'reveal', 'deep', 'secret', 'woman', 'time', 'momentous', 'decision', 'Andy', 'life.Carell', 'co', 'produced', 'stars', 'what', 'pet', 'project', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', 'script', 'Carell', 'True', 'jokes', 'crash', 'burn', 'badly', 'misfire', 'fizzle', 'enough', 'keeps', 'coming', 'raise', 'good', 'roaring', 'fun', 'Andy', 'Carell', 'everyman', 'kind', 'role', 'friends', 'who', 'surface', 'seem', 'chauvinistic', 'frat', 'boys', 'do', 'care', 'come', 'aid', 'endearing', 'spirit', 'so', 'adept', 'nuances', 'exaggerated', 'movements', 'physical', 'comedy', 'exploit', 'further', 'will', 'big', 'screen', 'remake', 'TV', 'spy', 'show', 'Get', 'Smart', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'standout', 'most', 'talked', 'one', 'infamous', 'hair', 'removal', 'waxing', 'clinic', 'where', 'Andy', 'make', 'more', 'physically', 'appealing', 'results', 'are', 'disastrous', 'well', 'known', 'Carell', 'performed', 'scene', 'real', 'suffered', 'art', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'quite', 'appealing', 'realistic', 'role', 'single', 'mother', 'looking', 'love', 'most', 'unlikely', 'places', 'relationship', 'Trish', 'Andy', 'earnestly', 'anchor', 'sillier', 'aspects', 'storyline', 'silly', 'aplenty', 'outrageous', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'vulgar', 'asides', 'ways', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'sense', 'manhood', 'maturity', 'being', 'boy', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'subplots', 'involving', 'guys', 'are', 'amusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'Also', 'good', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Andy', 'Trish', 'daughter', 'final', 'scene', 'pretty', 'nutty', 'clever', 'credits', 'roll.On', 'surface', 'film', 'would', 'appear', 'have', 'ingredients', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'Animal', 'House', 'American', 'Pie', 'Indeed', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'R', 'rating', 'seriously', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'not', 'one', 'note', 'comedy', 'rather', 'romantic', 'tale', 'heart', 'well', 'intentioned', 'theme', 'longing', 'frustration', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'go', 'knowing', 'may', 'be', 'grossed', 'out', 'times', 'still', 'induced', 'laughter', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'appeal', 'energetic', 'film', 'star', 'making', 'turn', 'Carell', 'one', 'watch', 'quite', 'time']",N/A

The chemistry between Carell and Catherine Keener (Trish) is genuine; Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen (as Andy's sexually-motivated co-workers) also stand out.

636742,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JNZU,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[6, 7]","Based on a skit he wrote years ago at Second City, Carell plays Andy Stitzer who lives a serene existence amongst his collection of unopened toys (an obvious metaphor which takes on greater significance as the story progresses) and working in the repair department of an electronics store. Since he keeps to himself, his co-workers assume he may be keeping heads in the fridge, but David (Paul Rudd) invites him to a late night poker game with Cal (Seth Rogen) and Jay (Romany Malco) and when it comes time to share sex stories, Andy gives his inexperience away.Shocked by how a grown man could go forty years without even doing it by accident, his fellow workers are amused but probably deep down grateful that they now have a project to distract them from their own problem-plagued existence. All the advice in the world can't ease a man who has already found his comfort zone and isn't even sure anymore if sex is such a big deal. That is until Trish (Catherine Keener) walks into the store, a mother-of-three who went through her wild phase years ago and isn't exactly looking for a man, but senses a kindness about Andy that immediately gets him digits.To describe a film like this solely on a plot structure is to suck the deafening laughs right out of it. But to go further into depth would be to ruin one gut-busting dialogue sequence or set piece after another. As quotable films go, The 40-Year Old Virgin boasts four characters who behave and talk like the atypical male. Not exemplified like the teet-lovin' pigs women talk about nor the pussified versions that romantic comedies use to suck women into the theater. These are men. Real men. Funny, flawed, horny and lovingly identifiable to both sexes.It was nearly ten years ago since we had characters as perfectly realized as Andy, David, Cal and Jay when 1996 brought us both Beautiful Girls and Swingers. Beyond their reaction to and faux knowledge of the opposite sex, you could watch the video game scene in Swingers and know this was happening somewhere in town, maybe with even guys we know. That small moment of brilliance is eclipsed in 2005 when David & Cal engage in a discussion over how each knows the other is gay which Cal puts the capper on by using his game warrior to provide the exclamation point. It is asides like this in The 40-Year Old Virgin which catapult it past posers like Wedding Crashers and will endure it as a comedy classic.If Apatow continues to churn out brilliance like this, his repertoire will soon be inheriting the accolades that Christopher Guest's receive on their feature-length improvs. (Jane Lynch has been borrowed from Guest and her unforced oddness gets us anticipating laughs which she pays off beautifully.) Apatow has brought with him folks from two of the most unjustly cancelled creations in TV history (Freaks and Geeks & Undeclared), most notably Rogen who, in my eye, is one of the funniest talents on the planet who should be finding steady work along the lines of Vince Vaughn and Jeremy Piven. Carell's Anchorman partner-in-crime, Paul Rudd, also continues to come into his own as one of the great untapped comic talents. His steady decline from stable nice guy to the wounded forsaken who has finally given up produces laughs even while we're concentrating on other laughs. And I had never seen Romany Malco before, but to come out of the blue and hold his own with the likes of this cast is a praise beyond measure. Special props is also due to the Elizabeth Banks who enhances her scenes with Carell by playing the good sport and trying to match his unbeknownst come-ons with a extra dose of sexiness.Carell for the past five years has been stealing major laughs away from Jon Stewart, Jim Carrey and Will Ferrell and recently took on the uneviable task of updating one of the best television series I have ever seen (Ricky Gervais' The Office) and turning it into a worthy successor. The brash, occasionally screaming Carell could wear thin over the years, but in Andy he finds not the naivety of a child that would be the easy way out for an actor to approach this role, but a sweetness bridging innocence and pestered solitude. Never do we doubt his plight or how he fell into it and we completely accept Keener's interest in him and the approach she takes to their relationship transforming him slowly from a boy in flux into a man with a different kind of happy ending. It's so great to see Keener not forced into her typical bitch role and allowed the chance to play a mature, sexy woman.Maturity comes with the playing field as Apatow and players have crafted an adult comedy worthy of the definition beyond MPAA age limits. It's not above the occasional cheap joke but counters it with some of the smartest and most off-the-wall pop cultural riffs in its dialogue that even those of us who identify them immediately still must blink twice that we actually heard someone in a mainstream comedy speak them. Comedies of this caliber don't come along too often. We're so desperate for them that we'll support wannabes like Wedding Crashers simply because they seem close enough to the real thing. In a world where films like The 40-Year Old Virgin is the great bizarro world version of garbage like Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, Wedding Crashers isn't much more than the cinematic equivalent of the Chicago Cubs. On paper it looks good and a lot of people dish out big money day-in and day-out when at the end of the day, it's just not very good. Wedding Crashers is going to gross close to $200 million by the end of its run and if that's the playing field comedy fans want to set, then The 40-Year Old Virgin deserves to outgross Titanic. Let's make it happen.",5,If you dont like this...

636744,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B00005JNZU,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[1, 3]","If you want to know a typical scene from ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"", read the text below.ANDY SITS AMONG OTHERS AT A BIRTH CONTROL CLINICANDY: Is it true that if you don't use it you lose it?TEACHER: Was that a serious question.ANDY: No, no it wasn't.SETH: You mean you're a virgin! Even I've tapped that.SETH'S DAD: Oh, you've hit it? Look at you, Seth, thinking you're all cool with your Jew 'fro.We don's say tap that..SETH: Do you have an extra-large [...]?SETH'S DAD: Oh Jesus Seth! You gotta [...]!Typically, though, the scene lasts longer and is a bit funnier. What was fit to print on a family site, and what was funny, I just did. That may say alot about ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"". But it really doesn't. Following ""Wedding Crashers"" as the summers next sex comedy, ""Virgin"" accomplishes what I would have thought to be impossible: It is funnier than ""Wedding Crashers"". To some who thought ""Wedding Crashers"" was hilarious may reconsider. This movie makes ""Wedding Crashers"" look like a kids movie. Fiercly funny and shamelessly profane, ""Virgin"" makes good of an improbable premise and actually overcomes many romantic comedy cliches and actually pulls of a sweet movie that is also very funny in a raunchy way. When the movie is not funny it is when it goes for to many sexually profane visual jokes. Flashbacks of Andy's teen years are so short and have so many sexual undertones that they are not that funny. But that is such a small part of the movie it hardly matters. The movies hilarity never ceces, and a scene where Andy goes to a Date-A-Palooza is a great sequence. He meets several seemingly nice women, all of which have flaws. One's [...] falls out of her shirt while she is talking and bouncing around. Another has a name that rhymes with a female body part (Mulva?, Jerry?). More somber moments involve the girlfriend of an unfaithful co-worker finding a Date-A-Palooza rating card and bringing it to Andy after the friend said it was Andy's, not his. The card, which is laden with urban slang, turns out to be the basis for one of the funniest scenes in the movie (""You wrote: 'That [...] needs to keeps her hands you know, fa sho'?"" ""Yeah. I remember her. She was a biatch, fa sho""). The scne goes on, and when Andy and the woman get into a verbal confrontation, Andy hesitantly says: ""You need to keep your---[...]---on a---leash. Yeah. A leash."" Some would say the exchange is too profane, and during the movie three groups of people left the theater. But, despite its incredible sense of himor, ""Virgin"" is definetely aquired taste. There are some scenes, like ones where characters play a videogame and play the ""Know How I Know You're [...]"" game (which I've never even heard of before, but I guess it is quite popular in area's of the U.K.), that go too far into the realm of overboard gross out humor. Then there are scenes like the one where Andy gets his chest hair waxed and screams things like ""Ahhh! You piece of [...]!"" and ""Ahhhhh! [...]! I'm sorry I don't usually swear this much. Ahhh! [...]! I'm sorry I don't usually swear this much"" that are so unbelievably funny that you wish that every scene was that funny. Actually, every scene is that funny, and thankfully so. The previews do not do the movie justice to how funny it really is. The previews make the movie out to be more of a [...] sex comedy and not the genuinely sweet one that it in fact is. Yes there are scenes of sexual raunchiness, but it is for the sake of the plot and not just there to be there.",5,"The Second, And Funniest, Raunchy Sex Comedy Of the Summer",1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,3506,"['want', 'know', 'typical', 'scene', '40', 'Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'read', 'text', 'below.ANDY', 'SITS', 'AMONG', 'OTHERS', 'AT', 'A', 'BIRTH', 'CONTROL', 'CLINICANDY', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'lose', 'TEACHER', 'Was', 'serious', 'question.ANDY', 'No', 'mean', ""'re"", 'virgin', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'tapped', 'that.SETH', 'DAD', 'Oh', ""'ve"", 'hit', 'Look', 'Seth', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'cool', 'Jew', ""'fro.We"", 'don', 'say', 'tap', 'that..SETH', 'Do', 'have', 'extra-large', '[', ']', 'SETH', 'DAD', 'Oh', 'Jesus', 'Seth', 'got', 'ta', '[', ']', 'Typically', 'though', 'scene', 'longer', 'bit', 'funnier', 'What', 'was', 'fit', 'print', 'family', 'site', 'what', 'was', 'funny', 'just', 'did', 'may', 'say', 'alot', '40', 'Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'really', ""n't"", 'Following', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'summers', 'sex', 'comedy', 'Virgin', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'be', 'impossible', 'funnier', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'who', 'thought', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'was', 'hilarious', 'may', 'reconsider', 'movie', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'look', 'kids', 'movie', 'Fiercly', 'funny', 'shamelessly', 'profane', 'Virgin', 'good', 'improbable', 'premise', 'actually', 'overcomes', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'cliches', 'actually', 'pulls', 'sweet', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'raunchy', 'way', 'When', 'movie', 'not', 'funny', 'when', 'many', 'sexually', 'profane', 'visual', 'jokes', 'Flashbacks', 'Andy', 'teen', 'years', 'are', 'so', 'short', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'sexual', 'undertones', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'such', 'small', 'part', 'movie', 'hardly', 'matters', 'movies', 'hilarity', 'never', 'ceces', 'scene', 'where', 'Andy', 'Date-A-Palooza', 'great', 'sequence', 'several', 'seemingly', 'nice', 'women', 'have', 'flaws', 'One', '[', ']', 'shirt', 'talking', 'bouncing', 'around', 'name', 'female', 'body', 'part', 'Mulva', 'Jerry', 'More', 'somber', 'moments', 'involve', 'girlfriend', 'unfaithful', 'co-worker', 'finding', 'Date-A-Palooza', 'rating', 'card', 'bringing', 'Andy', 'friend', 'said', 'was', 'Andy', 'not', 'card', 'laden', 'urban', 'slang', 'out', 'be', 'basis', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'wrote', ""'That"", '[', ']', 'keeps', 'hands', 'know', 'fa', 'sho', 'Yeah', 'remember', 'was', 'biatch', 'fa', 'sho', 'scne', 'when', 'Andy', 'woman', 'get', 'verbal', 'confrontation', 'Andy', 'hesitantly', 'need', 'keep', '[', ']', '-leash', 'Yeah', 'leash', 'would', 'say', 'exchange', 'too', 'profane', 'movie', 'three', 'groups', 'people', 'left', 'theater', 'incredible', 'sense', 'himor', 'Virgin', 'definetely', 'aquired', 'taste', 'are', 'scenes', 'ones', 'where', 'characters', 'play', 'videogame', 'play', 'Know', 'How', 'Know', ""'re"", '[', ']', 'game', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'before', 'guess', 'quite', 'popular', 'area', 'U.K.', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'realm', 'overboard', 'gross', 'humor', 'Then', 'are', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'Andy', 'chest', 'hair', 'waxed', 'screams', 'things', 'Ahhh', 'piece', '[', ']', 'Ahhhhh', '[', ']', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'swear', 'much', 'Ahhh', '[', ']', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'swear', 'much', 'are', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'funny', 'wish', 'scene', 'was', 'funny', 'Actually', 'scene', 'funny', 'thankfully', 'so', 'previews', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'how', 'funny', 'really', 'previews', 'make', 'movie', 'be', 'more', '[', ']', 'sex', 'comedy', 'not', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'one', 'fact', 'Yes', 'are', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'raunchiness', 'sake', 'plot', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'there']",N/A

636747,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005JNZU,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[4, 4]","- DVD REVIEWBy the time I left the theater after watching ""The 40-year-old Virgin"", I was still laughing.  I've seen plenty of comedies this year, but this movie is the funniest.  It's probably the best sex comedy I've seen since ""American Pie.""  Some people are not gonna like it for its over-the-top shenanigans and its ridiculous sexual content, and I'm glad I'm not one of those people.""Virgin"" needs no deep explanations to the story: Andy (Steve Carell) is a 40-year-old virgin, who works at a electronics store, and a invitation to a poker game led his worker buddies (Paul Rudd/Seth Cohen/Romany Malco) to realize that he's a virgin.  So for the next 2 hours and 13 minutes, his buds are gonna try to make him put the ****y in the pedistral and make him blossom, and ultimately, he did when he meets an attractive older woman in the store, while trying to get his freak on.  Not only does this film have some hilarious moments, like the waxing scene and the multiple-dates scene, but it's also heartwearing.  Not surprising coming from the director who did ""Freaks & Geeks"", this movie is as sensitive as Chris Klein.  The guys may be perverted, but they are likable, distinctive, and surprisingly, they develop; the workers try to change the virgin, but it's the virgin that changes them the most.  One character I admire is the Andy's love interest, Trish, a hot granny.  She's not one of those bubbly love interest like I've seen in most comedy-romances, she's like an older Allison Hannigan, just as crazy as the rest, and that's why I like her.  The story is simple, but big characters and wacky situation, plus a touch of morality, kept this film together.I was pretty polarized on the 17-minutes-longer unrated version.  I've only seen the film once in theaters, so my memory isn't too good, though I can recognize three scenes that were not in the theatrical cut.  There was Andy's dream sequence with the porn star, which was pretty funny; there was the one where he was on a phone talking to a Specialist about controling his erection, that I didn't care about; along with some extended scenes, the most noticeable one is the musical ending, which was too long-winded to hold the humor at pace compare to the theatrical.  Did it have to be 17 minutes longer than the original version?  No, it doesn't, but I'm not regretting it, which is fortunate, since this is the only version to get it widescreen.Unrated issues aside, ""The 40-year-old Virgin"" is full of laughs and full of heart, so the movie alone gets five stars out of me, so why four stars?  As funny as it is, it looks distracting.  The DVD consists of the 2-1/4 hour movie, deleted scenes, audio commentary, and other goodies.  The result of having all that extras is a very-compressed transfer.  It's nice that the movie is in real 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with the thin black bars on the top & bottom as it should, but I couldn't appreciate it because of the vast amounts of grain, slight dimness in the contrast, and noticeable halos on the characters.  It doesn't make sense when I compare the DVD on ""The Devil's Rejects"", which has more extras with both Dolby Digital and DTS surround, two commentaries, deleted scenes, and spoofed commericals, while retaining the goodness of the video quality (all on one dvd), so what seems to be the problem here?Speaking of extras, while the dvd is packed with bonus features as mentioned on the package, most of them are really alternate scenes, especially the easter egg found beside the ""Deleted Scenes"" section.  In fact, the only things that aren't alternate scenes, besides the mild gag-reel, is ""Waxing Doc"", ""My Dinner With Stormy"", and the dialogue altering ""Line-O-Rama.""  ""Waxing Doc"" is probably the only extra that resembles as a making-of feature, which shows how that waxing scene came to be, and I'm surprised that it was actually real.  ""My Dinner with Stormy"" is a conversation between Seth Rogan and porn-star Stormy Daniels...let's just leave it at that without going into the raunchy details.The alternate scenes are alright: ""Andy's Fantasies"" is both erotic and hilarious...somehow, I wanted that in my smut.  ""You Know...Gay"", ""Date-o-Rama"", and the easter egg ""Whack It"" are longer versions of the scenes they originated, and they do go on for too long.  The rest of the alternates are just bleh.  The six delete scenes range between unorthodoxed, cruel, and overconfident for Steve Carell's role in the film, which I'm glad they were on the cutting room floor.  I was intriguted by Carell's singing on the ""Karaoke"" scene, but that's as good as I can say.  It's nice that Universal included subtitles for the scenes, and the first page of the bonus features has a ""play all"" feature, with or without the Apatow/Rogen commentary.Other than the commentary by the cast and crew, the extras are a little disappointing, in which it could've benifited a making-of documentary or something behind-the-scenes.  Let's not forget the poor video transfer of the DVD.  But then again, all that good stuff could've make this into a double-sided dvd, as a standard to Universal DVDs, and I rather have a one-sided DVD with poor video quality, than having a quality double-sided disc and risk getting it scratched on either side.This DVD has problems, but for the most hilarious movie I've seen in a long time, I've come (*snicker*) to tolerate them.  Everyone with a sense of humor must watch this movie, unless you're a kid, so you watch it and blame your parents.  It's a touching story of a man never been touched, and his goal will touch the people who will care for him...non-sexually speaking, of course.This is Del Keyes, saying ""NO, KELLY CLARKSON!!""",4,The

In our culture, it somehow takes on negative connotations--especially as the person in question accumulates considerable years.  Alas, poor Andy Stitzer (Stever Carrell, who also co-wrote the screenplay) has been unlucky at love, even to the point of avoiding it, for his solitary 40 years.  He doesn't know how to drive a car, he rides a bike, he paints toy soldiers, and he collects plastic action figures. . .all while working inventory sheets for a most dysfunctional electronics store.  By sheer chance, he's talked into attending a late-night poker game with some of his zany coworkers; as his companions wax nostalgic over previous conquests, it becomes apparent lonely Andy can contribute nothing to the discussion.  Once the 40-year-old bachelor's sexual inexperience is confessed, THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN embarks on a hilarious romp of spine-tingling, raunchy comedy, as Andy's so-called ""friends"" bend over backwards to help him ""score.""This is a movie with no message or motive, other than for the viewer to sit back, relax, and have a good time.  And a good time is guaranteed, as Andy is dragged, often kicking and screaming, to singles bars, dating festivals, raunchy parties. . .even an encounter with a most curious prostitute.  All of these encounters backfire--horrendously--while Andy continues to lose his confidence, even though, across the street from his electronics store, a divorced mother of three named Trish (Catherine Keener) has set up an online business, and has also expressed interest in the longtime bachelor.  Will true love, well, will true lust, touch Andy's celibate life?  The journey of discovery is absolutely hilarious!This movie is carried ably, not only by Carell's wacky performance, but by his three coworkers, David, Jay, and Cal (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogan).  These three guys, particularly as they quarrel amongst themselves regarding the various stages of ""gayness,"" bring a dimension of jocularity to this film that is priceless.  Other noteworthy roles include Jane Lynch as Andy's on-the-prowl boss, and Elizabeth Banks as a predatory nympho.  This whole film just meshes--even the over-the-top Sixties flashback closing overture; the chest hair waxing scene had me wiping tears of exuberant joy from my eyes.  THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN is light fanfare, an adult comedy that feels good, from start to finish.  Feels good.  Hmmm.  Sounds like the inherent predicament of virginity has been solved.--D.

He accepts and through various conversations his co-workers discover that he is a virgin. They then set out to help him get laid.Andy clearly suffers from arrested development. He rides a bicycle to and from work and seems to be most impressed by his collectibles--which include various action figures still in the box and never opened. The friends are determined to get Andy laid and various antics ensue. Andy isn't just going to get down with a cheap slut. He meets a woman named Trish who is played by Catherine Keener, who is really the unsung hero of this film. She really does a wonderful job portraying a mother of three trying to pursue a serious relationship. They begin their relationship with a ""no sex"" policy. Trish and Steve really start to get serious and she even attempts to convince him to sell his collectibles to open his own store. When she is finally ready to consumate the relationship he pulls away. How do you tell the woman that you love that you are a 40 year old virgin?The 40 Year Old Virgin is a really funny film.

The result is a series of funny-misadventures in which the main persona, Andy, looks like a 40 year old 6th grader.One of the things that I liked about the film, and one thing that was quite unexpected, was that it did not delve into religious issues.

636758,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JNZU,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","The very concept of this movie sent a chill up my spine, as I was preparing myself for the return of Pee Wee Herman and the inevitable man-child clich&eacute;s that would come with a character bearing the movie's title. Contrary to my expectations, this film is a frequently hilarious, surprisingly humane comedy that goes well beyond the inevitable deflowering process. First-time director Judd Apatow smartly averts the movie from being a one-joke premise and provides instead a perceptive overview of the romantic anxieties and social pressures faced by those looking unsuccessfully for intimacy. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of crude humor and graphic sex jokes, but more importantly, it has a heart thanks primarily to a thoughtful script by Apatow and Steve Carell.In a sharply comic performance, Carell plays the title character, Andy Stitzer, as a socially clueless, emotionally inert loner in a paralyzing state of arrested development. Surrounded by his exhaustive action figure collection and working in a Circuit City-type electronics store, he rides a bike, doesn't know how to drive and doesn't seem to want to despite living in LA (the one plot contrivance) and can talk endlessly about making egg salad as the highlight of his weekend. Andy works with a trio of co-workers who all think of themselves erroneously as wise in the ways of love, and upon discovering Andy's virginity, they are determined to help him get a woman.But the film doesn't focus so much on the pursuit as it does in peeling off the layers of Andy's personality - the fundamental terror that has kept him from women, a constant need for order and logic to fill the void, and finally an eagerness for life to stay simple and uncomplicated so that he can live without confronting his fear. In short, he has rationalized sex and intimacy out of his life, that is, until he meets Trish, a nice, eccentric single mom running an eBay transaction store. Their burgeoning relationship is the heart of the story, and it certainly helps to have the always wonderful Catherine Keener play Trish in such a warm, loopy fashion that it's easy to believe the mutual attraction.The supporting performances are terrific - Paul Rudd portrays Andy's closest colleague David, who cannot get over his failed relationship which he faces again in a chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend at a speed dating event; Romany Malco plays Jay, a married philanderer who eventually gets caught; Seth Rogen as Cal, who thinks he's a ladies' man despite all the evidence to the contrary; and Jane Lynch from ""Best in Show"" as their manager, a power-driven woman who in a very funny scene, discreetly offers herself to Andy and serenades him with a Guatemalan folk song.There are several great scenes, including the poker scene where Andy awkwardly talks about women knowingly, the already famous chest hair-waxing where Andy yells out a series of Tourette-like epithets, and the surreal musical production number at the end, which will get any baby boomer giggling with abandon.

I further groaned when one of the trailers was for the ""American Pie"" spinoff ""Band Camp"", and another called ""Undeclared"", which looked like it was in the same vein.  Here we go, another American sex comedy that treats sex like something to snigger over.I just also saw a very good French film called ""Fresh Bait"".  It had nothing to do with ""40"", and in fact the lead characters turned out to be murderers.  But what stood out in the French film was the much more mature attitude the characters in general had about sex.  The French movie has a lot of nudity and some sex, but it's just part of the plot, and handled like the perfectly natural function it's supposed to be.  The actors in the French film were in their 20's, the ones in the American film were in their 40's, yet the maturity level of the characters in the French film (at least when it came to sex) was much higher than that of the Americans.We have a messed-up outlook towards sex in this country.  At one end, we have forces trying to stifle any type of sexualty in all forms of media, usually as a ploy to gain political or religious power.  At the other end, we have a huge industry that tries to get away with everything they can, usually in ways that really denigrate the subject matter.What we get are almost weekly releases of movies that treat sex in the ""American Pie"" vein.  Several guys in the movie will be hard up for sex, while making no effort to build a relationship first.  Women are mostly bimbos, and have their obligatory nude scenes that are done in a titillating, voyeristic manner.  Serious looks at the subject, or even plots where sex is treated as more of a positive, natural thing are few and far between.""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is different in that it shows what the ""American Pie"" crowd would grow into.  The men ARE more mature, but women are still objects.  Even though they are trying to de-virginize our hero, none seems to have a healthy sex life of their own.  Trying not to give too much away, the young blonde that our hero gets involved with early in the movie gets cast aside like trash when it befits the ending of the movie that we knew was coming from the first ten minutes of viewing the film.So why not one star instead of two?  There is talent in the movie.  Practically every role is well-acted.  Some of the stuff is funny.  As is a lot of ""American Pie"".  I guess this was a very popular movie.  But for that part of the crowd that went to see this movie to see the ""good parts"", go find yourself a copy of ""Fresh Bait"".

By then it had been banished to the smallest theater in the multiplex, so me and (I assume) the only other middle-aged virgin in town were its sole audience.  I wish I'd seen it sooner, because it's now one of my all-time favorite comedies.Forty-year-old Andy Stitzer lives a comfortably regimented singleton life - similar to the main character from ""About a Boy,"" except chaste, uncool, and with no internal monologue.  He works in the service department of Smart Tech, a Circuit City-like electronics store.  One day, a couple of coworkers ask him to be the fifth man at a poker party.  He accepts, but during the game is outed as a virgin.  The rest of the movie revolves around his friends' outrageous attempts to get him hooked up, along with Andy's determined efforts to overcome his fear of women and woo Trish, an attractive customer who owns an online auction store across the street.This could easily have been another lowbrow copulation comedy.  However, it's much better than that.  Steve Carell (also a co-writer) does a fine job of making Andy into a sympathetic character.  Indeed, I easily identified with his motivations and actions: the bad experiences that led him to forsake dating, his escape into fantasy, and even the mundane activities he uses to fill his solitary life.  Andy's friends are also intriguing because they represent flawed approaches to women.  David (Paul Rudd) is obsessed with a gal who dumped him years ago, Cal (Seth Rogan) objectifies females, and the serial cheater Jay (Romany Malco) can't commit to his longsuffering girlfriend.The movie has been lengthened in this DVD edition by 17 minutes with additional and extended scenes.  As for DVD extras, this edition is packed with a decent assortment.  Deleted scenes like Andy's public karaoke debut added depth to the characters.  A series of outtakes include the usual blown lines, gaffes, and laughing fits.  The lively commentary contains interesting bits of trivia on the filmmaking process.  However, it was a bit too crowded for my taste (just about everybody shows up), and Seth Rogan has a tendency to dominate the proceedings.  Unfortunately, Catherine Keener is a glaring absence.  Her portrayal of Trish is excellent, and I really wanted to hear her perspective.  Finally, the other featurettes, such as the waxing scene ""making-of"" bit, are stock, but passable.Although it's somewhat raunchy, as a Christian I have to commend ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" for a single crucial thing: it's the only mainstream movie I know of that makes chastity until marriage look like a grand idea.  That alone is enough to recommend it (even if my pastor disagrees).

636769,AS62A5MC52IEH,B00005JNZU,Floyd the Barber,"[2, 2]","There are three reasons to rent this movie:  Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, and the way an old formula was handled by the writers.Andy (Steve Carell) is a loveable loser.  He's an innocent who still collects ""Steve Austin"" action figures, rides his bike to work (because he doesn't own a car), and in general shies away from everybody.  He is the ""forty year old virgin,"" but really, in essence, an arrested adolescent.  Carell brings to this character innocence, vulnerability, but also a sense that, just beneath this exterior, is a whole person - a likeable person - ready to break out.  The movie is about Andy ostensibly trying to ""get laid,"" but in reality trying to find himself.  (Carell is very good at verbal and physical humor.  The chest-waxing scene, a combination of verbal timing and physical response, is hilarious.)Trish (Catherine Keener), not the best looking or youngest woman on the radar, is nevertheless mature, self-aware, yet still innocent and unbowed by things that have happened to her.  She is in fact more beautiful than any of the young, empty things that flit through Andy's life as the potential objects of his pent-up lust.  (Keener is absolutely wonderful at playing this character in such a way that that mature beauty comes through.  Hey, twenty-something women, there's a reason why younger guys want MILFS.)Although the entire movie seems to be about Andy ""getting laid"" and he is egged on to do that by his work-buddies, the movie is really about the growth in emotional maturity of a person, realizing that it's not sex that counts as much as emotional connection.  Indeed, by the end of the movie, all of the males, who've projected a sense of seeing women only as sex-objects, have grown (with one exceptional neandethal).The writers have taken an old story about ""coming of age"" and reversed the time-scale.  Usually, as in ""American Pie,"" it's about a young guy trying to ""score.""  He does and that's the movie.  (That's what makes ""AP"" so vapid.)  In ""FYOV,"" Andy ""gets laid,"" but that's not the pay-off at all.  Andy's learned that Trish completes him sexually, but also emotionally.Good show.(Points off for 1) unremittingly overlong scenes (the ""I know you're gay because..."" scence goes on and on);  and 2) there are some glimpses of formula, especially, for example, at the end, which scene is so old that it is beyond trite.

It's the first of all the Judd Apatow-style R-rated comedies.This is a believable story about those guys, like me, who are very shy towards women and always seems to act foolish around them. Steve Carell stars as Andy, a regular guy who keeps to himself, but enjoys his loneliness. It is when his coworkers out of the blue invites him to a poker game that his life begins to change. The guys, everyone has friends like these, find out about his lack of sexual encounters and feels they have to help Andy. Each guy has their own advice about approaching women and we see the hilarious results of their advice. Andy does finally meet someone who he truly cares about played by Catherine Kenner and the fun really begins.This is truly a very funny film. The laughs keep coming and never let up.  40 Year Old Virgin is in the vein of ""There's Something About Mary."" I was also surprised how touching the movie turned out to be.

636774,AITKXU3ZGAA0I,B00005JNZU,Georgios A. Katsaros,"[22, 40]","This one of the funniest films of the year that made me really have a good time.Its not often do you see a film that has cruel jokes and gags that do make you laugh but my point is that in end it has purpose and good meaning.Sex is not everything in life.Maybe sometimes.But not all the time.Andy's life to him has been good except he still haven't had sex yet and he's 40.He works in electronics store.Once the guys in the store find out.David,Jay and Cal vow to help him have sex.Andy has had quite a life.No pressure no fuss.Now that's over.Hes being sent out into the wild to pop his cherry.Threw out the film we see Andy on his journey.Were he meets beautiful women,weird women,a nice women and receives pain in some instances but in the end as they say better late than never.This the first film were Steve Carrel has staring role.After supporting roles in films like Anchorman:The Legend Of Ron Burgundy,Bruce Almighty and now the star of the TV Show The Office it about time to get his big chance of a starring role.Also Paul Rudd reunites with Carrel from former work on Anchorman while being directed by the producer of Anchorman Judd Apatow in first feature film production in directing and co-writning with Carrel.Apatow does a great job controlling the comedy.He knows when to gives right at best moment.And the emotional scenes he also handles it very well.But he had nothing really to worry about with very cool cast.They say if you cast right that's half the film.Like if in Carrel's place was Ben Stiller.In my belief it wouldn't work.This film also has some great jokes and gags that made me really laugh.Especially when Andy goes to get his chest waxed.That actually real too.Steve Carrel said they do it real or it wouldn't be as good.Of course all the sex jokes are really funny.But what really attracted me to this film after I watched it.Is that this film has a heart.Its not trying to make fun of Andy.That he hasn't had sex yet or that he has the same job for how long and has no friends.Once the guys in the store realize that he is a virgin yeah they tease him.But in the end they try to help.And make him grow as a man.This film could have been only about making fun of some people that are unlucky.Instead it shows how they are unique in there own way.Thats how Andy is.I mean hes not perfect.Neither the guys at the store that he works with.Each one has their own set of weird problems.This unrated DVD edition will have a additional 17 minutes footage.So expect some funny things.Also this edition will carry an anamorphic widescreen transfer.The disc will carry English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track.Extras will include a gag reel, a You Know How I Know You're Gay featurette,a 1970's sex education video,a Waxing Doc feature,a Line-O-Rama feature and much more.Also the unrated edition will include additional deleted footage and a My Date With Stormy feature in which actor/co-producer Seth Rogen has dinner with Stormy Daniels.This film is one of the nice surprises of the year.A film that not only makes us laugh but that also has a point to show.Hope we can expect more comedies like this in the future.From great new comic minds like Steve Carell.",5,Better Late Than Never,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,3188,"['one', 'funniest', 'films', 'year', 'made', 'really', 'have', 'good', 'time.Its', 'not',

It has great and memorable scenes, excellent chemistry between the performers and it is consistently funny throughout the 137 minutes. There are 17 minutes extra on this dvd and it was worth putting them in.The story concerns Andy a electronics store worker who is forced to admit to his friends that at 40 years old he's still a virgin. What follows is a superbly funny quest in exploring dating and sex. The relationships/chemistry between the stars is excellent and never feels forced and alot of the laughter is real, with a great deal of improvisation. If you listen to the commentary with cast and crew you feel how well they all got on with each other as there is never a dull moment when they are talking about the film.Many of the scenes are funny and some are superbly well written and performed. Such as the chest waxing scene, the ""You know how I know your gay"" scenes, the condom scene, the speed dating and the constant insult scenes with the indian worker. This is like Anchorman except that it's more consistently funny and never goes on too long. It also manages to make you care about the characters, which says alot for the acting.The extras on the dvd are very decent. There are deleted scenes, outakes, a number of funny segments and the great commentary that you can listen to.Overall you don't want to miss buying this dvd as it's well worth it for the very funny scenes and great extras.",5,Best Comedy of the year!,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,1455,"['easily', 'best', 'comedy', 'year', 'great', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'performers', 'consistently', 'funny', '137', 'minutes', 'are', '17', 'minutes', 'extra', 'dvd', 'was', 'worth', 'putting', 'in.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Andy', 'electronics', 'store', 'worker', 'who', 'forced', 'admit', 'friends', '40', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'virgin', 'What', 'superbly', 'funny', 'quest', 'exploring', 'dating', 'sex', 'relationships/chemistry', 'stars', 'excellent', 'never', 'feels', 'forced', 'alot', 'laughter', 'real', 'great', 'deal', 'improvisation', 'listen', 'commentary', 'cast', 'crew', 'feel', 'how', 'well', 'got', 'other', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'when', 'are', 'talking', 'film.Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'superbly', 'well', 'written', 'performed', 'Such', 'chest', 'waxing', 'scene', 'know', 'how', 'know', 'gay', 'scenes', 'condom', 'scene', 'speed', 'dating', 'constant', 'insult', 'scenes', 'indian', 'worker', 'Anchorman', 'more', 'consistently', 'funny', 'never', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'alot', 'acting.The', 'extras', 'dvd', 'are', 'very', 'decent', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outakes', 'number', 'funny', 'segments', 'great', 'commentary', 'can', 'listen', 'to.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'buying', 'dvd', 'well', 'worth', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'great', 'extras']",N/A

The personal verisimilitude made the movie all the more fun to watch, but also at times made me extremely uncomfortable.  Certain scenes reminded me so much of my personal experiences that I had difficulty even watching them alone, and was unable to bear watching them with my wife.  I commiserate with Andy's attempt in the restaurant to tell Trish he's a ""v.""  I have a not-hazy-enough recollection of a similar conversation with a beautiful brown-haired Elizabeth I- in Oslo of all places, and a scene in her hotel room that bore striking similarities to Andy's first encounter with Trish.  It's one of those things you don't want to remember but can't forget no matter how hard you try.But enough of true confessions.  Thank God I'm writing under a pseudonym.  Anyhow, the movie has much to commend it in general.  One thing I really, really liked about it, which Joe Morgenstern also picked out in his WSJ review, is the fact that Andy's friends really do care about him, and each other, and want what's best for him.  I haven't seen so much male bonding since the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies.  Another thing I liked about the movie was the frequent, but judicious, use of profanity, as well as the constant bantering of Andy's co-workers about each others', uh, ""orientation.""  That's some more verisimilitude for `ya there.  Combined with the inherent humor of Steve Carell engaged in street talk, you've got lots of great dialogue and many humorous scenes.I do have some objections to the movie, however.  I found some of the humor to be over the top, and raunchy instead of funny.  Vomit in the face just doesn't tickle me like it used to I guess.

I mean, Wedding Crashers (same type of comedy that came out around the same time) was also full of low class humor, but Wilson and Vaughn pulled it together.  40 year old virgin didn't have that star power to back it up, so ultimately it failed.The movie does have its funny moments, most of which was included in the preview, and I really wish it had been like the previews.  The movie's humor was basically an torturously long extension of the preview.  Take the hair waxing scene for example - 10 minutes of screaming obscenity, and most of them either aren't funny or don't really make sense.  The movie also tried to develop some sub-plots around the main character's 3 buddies, which never fully realized.  I guess the director also realized the boredom of focusing on the main story, but why develop crappy sub-plots if you never do anything with them?Also, for a movie like this, you know the ending before you even watch it, and that didn't help either.  I must have fast forwarded through at least a dozen scenes, most of them were either too dragging or just simply uninteresting.  I'm very glad I didn't get tricked by the previews and go see it in the theaters when it was out, but now that I've seen it, I wish I hadn't rented it either.

At a poker game, Andy is challenged to tell a story of his own.  Awkwardly he reveals that he has no sex stories, because he is a virgin-- at 40.  Shocked and yet empathetic, his buddies all try to get him to get friendlier with women with the intent of becoming physically intimate-- his buddies are all horndogs (including recent comic star Seth Rogen), and a series of comic misadventures takes place, involving everything from drunken clubgoers to a speed-dating service to transvestites to... well, it may not be polite to print.Along the way, Andy meets a friendly single mother, and after much self-protest, Andy brings himself to talk to her and go on a series of dates-- she really likes Andy-- but his own fear of sex leads him to arbitrarily induce a 20-date minimum before they go any further than kissing-- which leads to some unforeseen complications.Despite the casual profanity and the juvenilia that permeates the entire film, there is an endearing message about ""waiting"" and the myriad frustrations of 'nice guys' that manages to come across.

While the film does contain a little of this it is way more character based and the humor comes from more absurd situations than disgusting. Never judge book by its cover huh?Andy Stitzer (Steve Carrell) is a 40-year-old virgin. His life is made up of working in the returns department of an electronics store, collecting toys of movie characters and watching reality TV with his OAP neighbors. The touch of a woman is foreign to him and he is yet to be educated in their mysterious ways. Though he does have the bonus of not having to put up with their moaning, tantrums and bitching 'because they can'! When his secret is wrenched out of him his work buddies make it their mission to help him pop his cherry and think of a zillion, wacky, hair-brained schemes.But Andy is interested in Trish (Catherine Keener) the woman from the store across the road. Only he's really intimidated and arranges a weird no-sex policy with her that originally makes her relax at not having to live up to expectations but eventually makes her want to explode. Can he keep his secret from her too and perform the dirty deed with apparent expertise of your average porn stud? I'm just not a fan of all these ""Apatow Comedies"". Most of them long outstay their welcome and go on for well over two hours. The 40 Year Old Virgin is no exception.Despite some crude humor here and there this is more of a light-hearted 'drama-com' than a romantic comedy. Carrell also proves he a far more talented actor and comedian than Will Ferrel or Adam Sandler.Three stars are for the movie but it gets an extra bonus half-star for including a wonderfully, wonderfully top-heavy actress as Trish's daughter.

""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" makes a star out of Steve Carrell who plays the hero with just enough dim-wittedness and lonliness for us to appreciate even as we laugh at him. It's a great role from an insightful and thoughtful script. However, the translation on-screen is less than remarkable. Taking any 5-10 minute stretch of the film and looking at it, you discover how confusing the subject matter gets. The story is not given room enough to breathe. There's funny stuff, sure, but somehow director Judd Apatow lost touch with the scenes he filmed. It just doesn't flow right.Not the Performance___ Jameson ThottamAnd it has nothing to do with Steve Carrell's performance as Andy, the lonely Smart Tech employee who still collects comic book figures and rides a bicycle to work at age 40. He's out of touch with reality and seemingly lacks any social skills to be involved in a mutual relationship that would lead to sex. What's so great about Carell's performance is the way he respects the character and doesn't play him as a idiot or sociopath. Carell has made a name for himself playing morons in movies like ""Anchorman"". But here, his character is off but sincere. He winds up being very likeable toward the end.The Issue___ Jameson L ThottamBut it's the middle ""stuff"" I have a problem with. This stuff includes Andy's fellow co-workers (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen) trying to get their new friend to lose his virginity. The efforts range from lame to hilarious. There's a very funny scene when Andy is forced to get his hairy chest waxed. I believe the reason this scene worked so well is that it was improvised. Carrell was given room to respond to the conflict. Oftentimes, the scenes were rushed through barely giving the actors time to actually act and respond to the situations they faced.It's basically snippets of mildly amusing scenes up until Andy meets Trish (Catherine Keener), a woman about his age that works across the street from where he works. The movie homes in on them and the actors' performances. It's a relationship that works from the get-go, though the way the story is told doesn't support it.The plot___ Jameson ThottamThe plot is about a man trying to have sex. So, you know what you're getting when you walk in the theater. However, the story is about a lonely man who wants to love and be loved while experiencing the joys of manhood. It's a movie that had the potential to be the most touching and/or funny movie of the year. But somewhere along the way, the filmmakers grew tired of shooting one scene and moved on to another one. It's like they wanted to see how many potentially funny scenes they could cram into one movie.Parting Muses___ Jameson ThottamWhat's so amazing is how the actors like Carrell and Catherine Keener shine in their roles, even if they landed in the wrong movie.Jameson Thottam",3,Jameson Thottam passing on the 40 year old,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,2985,"['Jameson', 'Thottam', 'passing', '40', 'year', 'example', 'how', 'movie', 'several', 'great', 'performances', 'stars', '40', 'Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'star', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'who', 'hero', 'just', 'enough', 'dim-wittedness', 'lonliness', 'appreciate', 'even', 'laugh', 'great', 'role', 'insightful', 'thoughtful', 'script', 'However', 'translation', 'on-screen', 'less', 'remarkable', 'Taking', '5-10', 'minute', 'stretch', 'film', 'looking', 'discover', 'how', 'confusing', 'subject', 'matter', 'story', 'not', 'given', 'room', 'enough', 'breathe', 'funny', 'stuff', 'sure', 'somehow', 'director', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'lost', 'touch', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'just', ""n't"", 'flow', 'right.Not', 'Performance___', 'Jameson', 'ThottamAnd', 'nothing', 'do', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'performance', 'Andy', 'lonely', 'Smart', 'Tech', 'employee', 'who', 'still', 'comic', 'book', 'figures', 'bicycle', 'work', 'age', '40', 'touch', 'reality', 'seemingly', 'social', 'skills', 'be', 'involved', 'mutual', 'relationship', 'would', 'lead', 'sex', 'What', 'so', 'great', 'Carell', 'performance', 'way', 'character', ""n't"", 'play', 'idiot', 'sociopath', 'Carell', 'made', 'name', 'playing', 'morons', 'movies', 'Anchorman', 'here', 'character', 'sincere', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'likeable', 'end.The', 'Issue___', 'Jameson', 'L', 'ThottamBut', 'middle', 'stuff', 'have', 'problem', 'stuff', 'Andy', 'fellow', 'co-workers', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'trying', 'get', 'new', 'friend', 'lose', 'virginity', 'efforts', 'range', 'lame', 'hilarious', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'when', 'Andy', 'forced', 'get', 'hairy', 'chest', 'waxed', 'believe', 'reason', 'scene', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'improvised', 'Carrell', 'was', 'given', 'room', 'respond', 'conflict', 'scenes', 'were', 'rushed', 'barely', 'giving', 'actors', 'time', 'actually', 'act', 'respond', 'situations', 'faced.It', 'basically', 'snippets', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'up', 'Andy', 'meets', 'Trish', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'woman', 'age', 'street', 'where', 'movie', 'homes', 'actors', 'performances', 'relationship', 'get-go', 'way', 'story', 'told', ""n't"", 'support', 'it.The', 'plot___', 'Jameson', 'ThottamThe', 'plot', 'man', 'trying', 'have', 'sex', 'So', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'when', 'walk', 'theater', 'However', 'story', 'lonely', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'experiencing', 'joys', 'manhood', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'most', 'touching', 'and/or', 'funny', 'movie', 'year', 'somewhere', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'grew', 'tired', 'shooting', 'one', 'scene', 'moved', 'one', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'potentially', 'funny', 'scenes', 'could', 'cram', 'one', 'movie.Parting', 'Muses___', 'Jameson', 'ThottamWhat', 'so', 'amazing', 'how', 'actors', 'Carrell', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'shine', 'roles', 'even', 'landed', 'wrong', 'movie.Jameson', 'Thottam']",N/A

Steve Carell does a fantastic job in surely what will live on as one of funnier comedies out there. In this day and age where the so-called ""moral majority"" and conservative Christian groups are riff with removing adult content from all forms of media it's refreshing to be able to see a great vulgar and profane movie that provides some adult entertainment that isn't centered around a Mel Gibson movie-because apparently ultra-violence is acceptable as long as it meets the Christian right-wing's ideals.

Davis ""Jeffrey Matthew Davis""","[6, 8]","Whether you are male or female, democrat or republican, black or white, gay or straight, bi or thai, there is one thing I'm sure we can all agree on: THIS YEAR'S SUMMER MOVIES HAVE TOTALLY BLOWN!!!Enter The 40 Year Old Virgin, which may rob the title I bestowed upon There's Something About Mary as the smartest, funniest, and sweetest summer gross-out comedy ever.Granted the plot of Virgin is etirely predictable.  By watching the trailer or merely hearing the title of the film, it's easy to figure out that Steve Carrell's charater has gone without carnal knowledge for 40 years and his buddies will try to get him laid.  In the process, Carrell will find true love...and eventually be deflowered.What makes this movie so enjoyable then?  I'd say it's the following three things...1) The comedic timing of the entire cast.  Everyone is dead on in their delivery of one-liners.  And, like my beloved Something About Mary, the best lines come out so effortlessly and spontaniously it seems like half the movie was improvised.  Actually, I wouldn't be suprised if much of the movie was imporvised.  The producers said that they really waxed Carrell's chest in the scene that's in all the comercials and trailiers (which is by the way one of the funniest film moments I've ever seen...if you can call squinting through tears of laughter seeing).2) The men.  Hearing four guys talk about sex for an hour and a half is great, especially when it's discussed in such a gross, vulgar, disgusting, and sadly real way as in this film.  In short, Carrell and his friends are a male version of the ""Sex and the City"" ladies where the three friends are all Samanthas with the rauchiness taken to an extremen and Carrell's the only Charlotte.3) Carrell.  His innoccence and charm makes you want to root for him and laugh at him all at the same time.  A scene in which Carrell tries to put on a condom, somehow gets his testicles in it, and snaps it is a prime example.  You laugh at him, but you feel sorry for him at the same time.  Very few actors can pull off a character like this as well as he does.So if you're sick of crap like The Island or Madagascar, go see this film.  I swear it'll be considered one of the best comedies of the past 10 years.

636799,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JNZU,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[0, 4]","You got to give a hand to Steve Carnell and Paul Rudd for trying. Unlike other movies, comedies are usually hard to rate or sum up when there really good (like Wedding Crashers) but easy to criticize if there bad (like this movie).The movie started out with a good concept, and progressed pretty nicely, but by the middle of the movie, I felt like the comedy just ran too dry. Lets face it, Steve Carnell doesn't have the star power or comedy laughter of a will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn. He did have his moments, but after a while he seemed whiny and irritating. Paul Rudd tried to help his buddy out and did a pretty good job when it counted but that's only because he acted like he did in anchorman. Other than that he didn't have much comedy elements to work with (the whole breaking up thing got old kind of quick).Another problem of the movie is the progression, just too slow to get to the end, lets face it, comedies like this should only go about an hour and half or and hour and 45 minutes at best. The movie went way to long, and you knew that when he met ""the one"" that they'd have a big fight. Unfortunately it took to long to get to that fight, which made you think ""why is this movie still going?"" The ending was strange, really really strange. You knew by that point that Steve needed some help, but he didn't get it (whether by the actors themselves, or by him being to independent, i don't know).Probably the biggest shocker and disappointment is the fact that they had no other comedians in the movie. Usually in movies like ""Wedding Crashers,"" when you think the comedy is about to get old, they throw in Will Ferrell or some comedian to get you rolling again. This movie desperately needed a Will Ferrell, or Vince Vaughn to make a cameo appearance to spice up the movie.Viewer's don't get me wrong, this type of comedy has really taken off since ""Zoolander,"" ""Dodge Ball"" etc...........

Yes.  Can men, in groups, have a lot of trouble communicating with each other?  Yes.  Can men, in groups, take sadistic pleasure in downing one another's sexuality, in bashing, and in chasing women as objects?  Yes.So, what's the movie all about?

The unrated version, especially, brings them on by the truckload.However, it is that same unrated version that provides the Garrison Keillor parody you've been waiting for.  Look for the ""Date-A-Palloza"" sequence where a woman from Minnesota is interviewed by the main character.

I have to give him a lot of credit, his acting was amazing and on more than one occasion I rolled around on the floor laughing myself to death.The movie is pretty much what you'd think. Steve Carell plays a 40 year old virgin who works at an electronics store with a bunch of cool guys who think he's a serial killer because of the way he acts. When they find out he'd a virgin they make it their goal to make sure he gets some. What ensues is one of the funniest movies ever as each one of them gives him their own perspective on how to get a girl, one says its all about looking good and tells him to get his chest waxed, the other tells him the only thing you have to do is ask question and not say anything, yet another tells him to go for the drunks and work his way up, all end up in disaster.The plot is pretty simple, the script average, but the acting this movie gets is amazing. As I've said, Steve Carell is amazing, but he is backed up by some great secondary characters. The insecure black guy, the doped up fat dude and the Romeo want to be are all very good characters who make sure Carell isn't doing all the comedic work himself. Even the very minor character, like the old guy and the Indian at work, are great. I didn't even see a moralistic kid in this movie. THANK THE LORD!Its not the extremely stupid funny that anchorman is, and its not the really smart pointed comedy that you'll see inSouth Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut, it has more in common withLiar Liar (Collector's Edition)than anything else, so if that kind of thing floats your boat then hey, go for it, knock yourself out.warning though, if you don't like crude humor and sexual situations and some nudity, then I think it goes without saying avoid this movie like the plague (but then again why would you even want to see this movie in the first place?).

Predictably, when Carrell's friends find out that he's a virgin, they all try to get him laid by giving him bad advice about how to approach women.Also, with other recent sex comedies like ""American Pie,"" the subject of virginity has already been tapped.  The difference here is that the main character is older.

636815,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JNZU,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" was a movie that I was on the fence about seeing for a long time. When I saw the trailer for it on TV and in theaters I thought it looked like it had possibilities of being funny, but then I wondered if all the good stuff had already been shown like so many other comedies do in their previews anymore. With that thought I managed to talk myself out of seeing the movie in theaters, opting to wait for DVD instead. The time came for the DVD release and I found myself with little interest in watching the movie, since it had been a while since I had seen the previews, and the desire to see it had waned. However, a co-worker was talking about seeing it again recently, and how funny it still was even after multiple viewings. When I mentioned that I had seen the movie, and what my concerns were regarding how funny it would still be beyond seeing the previews, to which the response was that the previews didn't even show the half of it. So, needless to say that was enough to get my interest back, and I decided to rent ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" for the wife and I to hopefully enjoy thoroughly once the kids were asleep.""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is the story of a man named Andy (Steve Carell), a stock room manager at a tech store who is content with living the life of a single man who loves to collect toys (never opening them from their box to ensure their value), play video games, and just have some good wholesome fun. During a poker night with some friends, the conversation is steered towards their individual sex lives, all of which seem to have some rather exaggerated details included, and when it comes to Andy's turn to share he flubs his way through a story that is so paper thin that it becomes very apparent that he is indeed still a virgin. With this discovery his friends take it upon themselves to solve, what they deem to be a problem, for Andy by trying to hook him up with a woman. However, their methods are not necessarily what's best for Andy, and their tips seem to range from bad to worse. With all this going on in his life, insanity seems like a sure bet, but then a woman named Trish (Catherine Keener) comes along who just might be the perfect woman to bring some stability to Andy's life, so long as his friends don't mess it up too much first.This is a movie that I must say truly surprised me. Sure it contained the raunchy comedy that I expected from a movie with a title such as this, of course there is plenty of awkward situations (that are hilarious mind you) as his friends attempt to fix him up with a girl, and yes, the moral compass for the film is greatly skewed (for most of the characters anyway), but what I didn't expect was the endearing goodness and sincerity of Andy that serves as an anchor for all of the outlandish hilarity that ensues throughout the movie. Steve Carell's character, though he struggles with the temptations that his friends thrust upon him, he manages to hold on to his virtue of being a virgin (though this wasn't purposely done on his part, just a victim of circumstance), and in the end chooses to wait for the love of his life rather than have a meaningless fling. Having the main character be someone like this, who ends up having a strong moral compass, in this type of movie was a very welcome change of pace, and one that probably made this movie be better than it would have been allowing it to stand out from the rest of the crop.The cast comprised of very talented comedic actors, such as; Seth Rogen (""Knocked Up""), Paul Rudd (""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"") and of course, the star of the show Steve Carell (""Evan Almighty""), each of whom brought their characters to such hilarious and memorable life. The talented cast would have been nothing if not for the direction of experienced writer/producer, but relative newcomer to directing, Judd Apatow. Apatow, who also helped co-write the movie with Steve Carell, brought a freshness to the adult comedy genre opting to have more hilarious scenes, jokes, and even some drama, rather than relying on gratuitous nudity to carry the movie.""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is very much an adult oriented comedy that is not at all safe for children, but it is without a doubt a hilarious movie filled with innuendo, sometimes raunchy comedy, and even some sweetness that is definitely worth watching, and is even one of the few of its kind that is even remotely original.""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is

636820,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JNZU,Kaya Savas,"[1, 1]","MOVIE: Steve Carell is one hilarious guy.  He was the funniest part of Bruce Almighty, the funniest part of Anchorman, and his show The Office is just plain funny.  This late summer comedy should have been released earlier in the summer, maybe it would have made more money.  Hopefully word of mouth will carry it, because audiences are loving it and critics are too.  The movie is absolutely hilarious.  Carell plays this quiet guy who works at an electronics shop and he gives this guy lots of charm.  This movie actually has character because we get some flashbacks of his past experiences with women and how they fail miserably.  So in a basic sense we do have depth in the character and that allows the audience to connect more.  There are ""scenes"" in this movie like in most comedies because the movie flows very nicely.  For instance in Wedding Crashers there was the ""dinner scene"" or the ""bedroom scene"".  In Anchorman there was the ""news team fight scene"".  This movie really has only one ""scene"" and that would be ""the waxing scene"".  Overall the movie flows and the comedy is layed out within it.  There are some hilarious moments in this one and the ending is probably one of the funniest things I have seen in quite some time.  It's also a nice addition to the ""R"" rated comedy genre.  Previously, only the Farrelly Brothers were able to give us laugh out loud ""R"" rated comedy.  This summer we had the very funny Wedding Crashers and now the even funnier 40-Year Old Virgin.  The character that Carell plays is so simple-minded that it makes it very easy for the audience to connect with.  This movie has enough charm and heart to make it a sappy romance movie, but it also has enough crude sex humor to make it just plain hilarious.ACTING: Steve Carell is a very funny man and he proves that he is more than a supporting actor with this role.  He carries the role with ease and he does not steal the show from the other actors and actresses in the film.  The entire cast in this movie is hilarious and Carell does not have all the funny scenes in the movie, and I'm glad it's like that.BOTTOM LINE: It has character and it has some crude sex humour, it is hilarious.  The end will have you laughing into the credits, and you will be glad you took the time to see it.  I found this to be funnier than Wedding Crashers and an overall better comedy.

It's a raunchy, laugh-out-loud adult comedy that's worthy of multiple viewings.  Unlike most adult comedies that rely strictly on gross-out and sexual humor, there's actually a message behind all of the silliness in this flick.The story is simple, Carell is forty, a virgin, and has a few buds who are determined to get him a little nookie.  They're initial attempts are hilarious.  As the story goes on, however, they begin to realize that Carell is just fine being himself.  He sets off after the girl of his dreams and eventually delivers a wonderful message of standing for your own beliefs.Catherine Keener plays Carell's love interest and is simply stunning in the role of the sexy grandma.  Carell is a typical action-figure collecting boy trapped in an adult's body.  The rest of the cast is over the top fun.  From the crushed ex-boyfriend to the wild nymphmaniac to the drunk girl at the bar, we've all seen characters like this in real life on some sort of level.If you're longing for hilarious adult comedy in the same vein as ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Sweetest Thing,"" ""Virgin"" is a definite winner.",4,Top Notch Adult Comedy,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1185,"['Steve', 'Carell', 'winner', 'hands', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'raunchy', 'laugh-out-loud', 'adult', 'comedy', 'worthy', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'most', 'adult', 'comedies', 'rely', 'strictly', 'gross-out', 'sexual', 'humor', 'actually', 'message', 'silliness', 'flick.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Carell', 'forty', 'virgin', 'few', 'buds', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'get', 'little', 'nookie', ""'re"", 'initial', 'attempts', 'are', 'hilarious', 'story', 'however', 'begin', 'realize', 'Carell', 'just', 'fine', 'being', 'off', 'girl', 'dreams', 'eventually', 'wonderful', 'message', 'standing', 'own', 'beliefs.Catherine', 'Keener', 'Carell', 'love', 'interest', 'simply', 'stunning', 'role', 'sexy', 'grandma', 'Carell', 'typical', 'action-figure', 'collecting', 'boy', 'trapped', 'adult', 'body', 'rest', 'cast', 'top', 'fun', 'crushed', 'ex-boyfriend', 'wild', 'nymphmaniac', 'drunk', 'girl', 'bar', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'sort', 'level.If', ""'re"", 'longing', 'hilarious', 'adult', 'comedy', 'same', 'vein', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', 'Virgin', 'definite', 'winner']",N/A

Next time I'll know to stick the the theatrical releases unless fans swear by the extended version (such as with Lord of the Rings that benefited from more minutes).Anyway, if I ignore the bits I was to later find out were stuck back in, this movie was so funny, yet true to life.

It's too bad, because the humor inherent in all of Andy's variegations would be more than to make this film a truly memorable comedy. Instead, we are subjected to the tortures that Andy suffers at the hands of his gang of single friends (all of whom have their own sloppy relationship issues). Andy is set up on a blind date with a transvestite, his inexperience becomes the talk of the workplace, they buy him a library of porn tapes and magazines (though how this would address his partnering problem is an open question), and he is dragged pillar to post by his silly friends through an assortment of dance clubs, bars, strip joints, and cocktail parties, all in hope of meeting a girl who will help him fulfill the Prime Directive.When he finally meets her (Elizabeth Banks), she of course scares the hell out of him, and he dashes back to his plain-jane more-or-less platonic girlfriend.

My friends forced me to go see it despite my objections and I laughed my rear off the whole time.First off, this movie does not make fun of virgins per say.  It actually reinforces the moral values of sexual responsibility in a twisted sort of way.  Enter Andy, a well-manored employee at the local electronic store working with a crew of sexual deviants and severe personality querps (in the very beginning, Andy's co-worker Cal begins talking about his disgusting trip to Mexico over the weekend) that try to get Andy laid when they discover his deep, dark secret; he's 40 and still a virgin.The methods Andy's friends try and advice they give him to help him hook up with a women backfire each time and prove to actually make things worse.  For instance, Andy falls in love with the business woman across the street, however, his co-workers urge him not to have sex with her because he needs to experience bad women first in order to appreciate a good woman.Slowly as the movie progresses, Andy's co-workers realize that maybe Andy's respect for women and calmness towards the situation may be the solution to their problems as we learn their problems early on (one is going through a 2-year withdraw from breaking up with a woman he dated for four months).  I won't spoil the ending, but the producers took some form of high road to help solve Andy's problem, which surprised me emensely.Each actor was perfect for each role, not just Steve Carell.  It's somewhat rare to see a well-casted movie with mostly unfamiliar actors and actresses although there are some returning faces from Anchorman besides Stevel Carell.The jokes and gags proved to be hilarious, my personal favorite was the 10-minute-long ""wanna know how I know you're gay"" routine between two co-workers while playing Nintendo 64 at Andy's apartment (the extended version in the special features made me laugh HARD).  The wax scene (which actually happened... sort of) just made me cringe yet I couldn't stop watching.The only beefs I had was for a movie that made the moral statement that it did, it is certainly NOT for kids as it has several wacky scenes involving nudity and suggestive humor.  NOT a family film but excellent for college students and mature adults.

His friends may make fun of him but he's the one they turn to when things go south in their lives and I think it's because he's the one who's stayed true to who he is and this gives him strength.  Even though all the world is telling him that he is an oddball, and he himself wonders if he is missing out, when it comes down to it Andy is not sure if sex before marriage is something he really wants.  Opportunities for sex come his way but he always ends up walking away until his marriage day.I think this is what surprised me about the movie: it could easily have been a movie about a frustrated guy's search for sex and instead turned about to be a (very crude) meditation about a guy who decides to experience sex for the first time on his own terms and not in the way society is telling him he should experience it.  That approach is a ""wait until marriage"" approach.  And you know what?

It's gross and distasteful, but it really has a heart.  There are quite a few great scenes in which it shows the private relationships of men.  Many people might think that this is the stereotype of male relationships (drinking, gambling, being disgusting, etc.), but for the most part, the movie hits the mark perfectly.  The jokes don't get tireless throughout the entire movie.  No matter how many gross jokes there are about sex, they don't lose their humor because of the great acting.

After having seen Anchorman, also directed by Judd Apatow, I was expecting great things when I heard that Carell was reuniting with Apatow and Paul Rudd for this movie.  I thought their work on Anchorman was memorable and hilarious, although I realize it was one of those movies that you either ""got"" or you didn't. I loved it and have been quoting it ever since.In Anchorman, Steve Carell was very limited in his role as mentally handicapped weatherman Brick Tamland.  This was also the case with his minor supporting role in Bruce Almighty.  It was great to see him step out into leading man status with this movie.  I feel he did a tremendous job with this performance - one that will ensure him other big roles in the near future.  Carell is a fearless performer which, I believe, is an essential component for successful comedy.  He lets it all hang out in this, his first leading role - and he scores big...This movie supplies plenty of quotable lines and memorable characters.

Andy's weekend of fun is buying the ingredients for an egg salad sandwich...and making it. Andy is 40 years old. Andy is also a virgin.Within the store that Andy works at are a bunch of guys who do what most guys do. Talk crap to one another (in a `friend' way), play poker, go clubbing, lookin for the chickys, and even going to see donkey shows. Well, Andy doesn't really fit in with the rest of the group, but one day the rest of the guys ask Andy to fill in at the poker game because one of the regulars won't be there. During the game the guys start talking about sex and women, and Andy makes the mistake of saying boobs feel like a bag of sand. Thanks to this mistake the guys figure out he's still a virgin. And instead of making his life a living hell, they decide to help him out in the ways they know how.This movie has made me laugh so many times and in so many spots. Judd Apatow (writer, director, and producer) has the exact same kind of comedy as me. And to me that comedy is just straight stupid and non-caring and perverse and quick witted and spontaneous...and ... and... well... there is just so much more. Thankfully Apatow has made it in the movie business because the networks sure didn't let him succeed on T.V. (Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared). Also I'm happy that Apatow has kept a lot of his actors from his T.V. shows and starred or co-starred them in his movies, Like Seth Rogen for instance. To me, Seth was just not that funny at all in Freaks and Geeks, but now he's one of my favorite actors for a comedy.  I've seen The 40-Year Old Virgin around 20 times since it came out in theaters and I still laugh at it in many spots.The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that it just isn't for everyone. Some people's humor is just so far gone or to snobbish that they'll never like a movie like this. There is a lot of cussing, perverse jokes, and even nudity. And that's ok that it's not for everyone, but for the people that cant stand movies like this... how do you not know what you are getting into before you watch something like this?In the end, I would say BUY this movie if you love to laugh at some crude humor.

I simply could not allow myself to waste another hour of my life by watching the rest of it. This movie could have been funny because the plot (which is summarized very well in the film's title) has the potential for a lot of laughs. Basically, there's a guy Andy (Steve Carell) who works in an electronics store, and one night he reveals to his coworkers that he's never had sex before. Andy's friends get over their initial shock and make it their personal mission to coach Andy on how to be a hit with the ladies and succeed in helping him get laid.Unfortunately, the movie relies on a lot of tasteless humor, and while I realize that kind of thing appeals to a lot of people, it doesn't appeal to ME at all. The first five minutes of the film revolve around Andy's erection, and the rest of the time is spent trying to cram as many dirty and vulgar words into each scene as possible. The jokes aren't funny, there's a lot of unnecessary lewdness, and it's just...NOT GOOD!I am not a prudish moviegoer by any means. I wish that Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler had taken this concept and run with it, because they probably would have produced a much better film.

How many times can we watch as our hero Steve, whom we grow to like during the course of the film, humiliate himself?That being said, director Judd Apatow is to be congratulated for shooting for an ""R"" rating rather than the requisite ""PG"" in order to attract the lucrative under 17 crowd.

Most comedy movies, compared to drama movies and some action movies, have a very hard time having developed storylines and truly inspired acting and such.  The 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, however, is able to escape the traps that many comedies fall into.  It is both funny and credible enough to actually not just be a good comedy movie, but also be a strong movie period.Again, maybe the concept of the storyline is a bit absurd, the fact that the man is a ""40"" year old virgin, but it is definitely not unheard of or as nearly absurd as the concept of THE WEDDING CRASHERS.  The Basic storyline is that this 40 year old works at a store called Smart Tech and his colleagues who've previously disassociated with him, decide to invite him to play a game of cards with them.  At their game, they all discuss there relationship and sexual experiences.  Steve Careel (who plays the 40 year old virgin), fall short in this area and makes obvious the fact that he is a virgin at the age of 40. His colleagues at work then decide to teach and aid Carell in losing his virginity.  The advice often lands Carell in a number of uncomfortable bad situations.  However, not to give away the rest of the story, Carell ultimately loses his virginity at the end of the movie (big surprise right?).I highly recommend this movie.  This is moreso a movie for twentysomethings or young adults, especially toward a male audience.  That isn't to say others wouldn't enjoy it, but it is aimed more that spectrum than any other.

636859,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JNZU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[5, 6]","There are very few subjects I get defensive about.  I'm secure enough in my own beliefs that I don't fuss over any one stereotype in the media. Except when it comes to geeks.I really, really dislike the ""jock"" mentality that so often permeates popular culture, casting geeks as introverted serial killers in the making.  Thus, I gave The 40-Year-Old Virgin a wide berth. Eventually, a friend lent us the DVD.  Secure in the knowledge that the studio wasn't making any money from my viewing, I sat down and watched the film. I'm glad I did.Virgin is pretty much exactly what the title says it is: 40-year-old Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) accidentally reveals that he's actually a virgin during a poker game with his coworkers.  The cast of characters includes the lovelorn David (Paul Rudd, former beaux of Phoebe Buffay), the urban skirt-chaser Jay (Romany Malco), and pot-smoking author Cal (Seth Rogen).  Each of these guys brings their own philosophy to the film as they hatch plots to get Andy laid.Andy is a sweet guy.  He doesn't curse, doesn't do drugs, and doesn't drink.  He rides his bike to work everyday.  A huge multimedia system, complete with game chair and large-screen TV, dominates his living room.  He keeps a massive collection of toys and posters, harkening back to the 60s.  In essence, you would expect Andy to be running a company like Apple.Unfortunately, nobody else sees it that way.  His coworkers are chiefly concerned with his sexual prowess.  The females in his life--and there's really only Trish, played by Catherine Keener--want him to ""grow up.""  More about that later.David, the most well rounded of Andy's work friends, is obsessed with his ex-girlfriend Amy (Mindy Kaling, still working at The Office).  He tries to gently ease Andy into the dating life and appears to be the ringleader of the group; but in reality he's not much better off. David can barely contain his rage about being dumped, especially after he bumps into his ex at a speed-dating contest.Jay, on the other hand, rams poor Andy into the most awkward and terrifying social situations.  He's a dawg himself, cheating on his long time girlfriend Jill (Erica Vittina Phillips).  In reality, Jay's pathetically insecure, getting into fights with customers and hilarious confrontations with coworkers (especially Mooj, played by Gerry Bednob).Cal is at the opposite end of the spectrum. He smokes pot, he writes books, and he's apparently not very successful at either.  Cal encourages Andy just to ask questions, parroting back whatever women say to him.  Sadly, that tactic works...although Andy discovers the woman he manages to snare (the naughty Elizabeth Banks as Beth) is not someone he wants to be with.In fact, the only person who has anything in common with Andy is Trish, the entrepreneur across the street who sells stuff on Ebay.  Without much effort, Andy ends up getting her number.  And then spends the rest of the film wondering what to do about it.At first blush, this film seems to be a blistering attack on the geek way of life.  After all, Andy's encouraged to grow up by selling all his toys and buying a car.  But a closer look reveals that Judd Apatow, executive producer of Freaks and Geeks, directed Virgin. This man is a friend of the geek if not a geek himself.Sure enough, each of Andy's macho friends goes through some growth on his own.  It's not Andy who has to grow up, but the obsessive Davids, the girl-crazy Jays, and the pot-sniffing Cal's.  And they do.  Well, everyone except Cal. In the process, Andy comes out of his shell and into his own, progressing from backroom tech guy to front room floor manager and mustering up the courage to pursue the one woman he really wants to be with.Through it all, we learn a lot from Andy.  His childish sense of wonder makes him a great playmate for Trish's youngest daughter. Trish, incidentally, has three children and one of them has a child, making her a grandmother.  Andy's abstinence from sex makes him a great role model for Trish's middle daughter. His gentle nature makes him an excellent salesperson.  And of course he's tech savvy, making him a great techie.By the end of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, we discover the joke's on us. Apatow is laughing at us laughing at Andy. Perhaps being a geek isn't such a bad thing after all.",4,Perhaps being a geek isn't such a bad thing after all,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,4315,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'subjects', 'get', 'defensive', ""'m"", 'secure', 'enough', 'own', 'beliefs', 'do', ""n't"", 'fuss', 'one', 'stereotype', 'media', 'when', 'geeks.I', 'really', 'really', 'dislike', 'jock', 'mentality', 'so', 'often', 'popular', 'culture', 'casting', 'geeks', 'introverted', 'serial', 'killers', 'making', 'Thus', 'gave', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'wide', 'berth', 'Eventually', 'friend', 'lent', 'DVD', 'Secure', 'knowledge', 'studio', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'money', 'viewing', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.Virgin', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', '40-year-old', 'Andy', 'Stitzer', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'accidentally', 'actually', 'virgin', 'poker', 'game', 'coworkers', 'cast', 'characters', 'lovelorn', 'David', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'former', 'beaux', 'Phoebe', 'Buffay', 'urban', 'skirt-chaser', 'Jay', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'pot-smoking', 'author', 'Cal', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'guys', 'brings', 'own', 'philosophy', 'film', 'hatch', 'plots', 'get', 'Andy', 'laid.Andy', 'sweet', 'guy', ""n't"", 'curse', ""n't"", 'do', 'drugs', ""n't"", 'drink', 'bike', 'work', 'everyday', 'huge', 'multimedia', 'system', 'complete', 'game', 'chair', 'large-screen', 'TV', 'living', 'room', 'massive', 'collection', 'toys', 'posters', 'harkening', 'back', '60s', 'essence', 'would', 'expect', 'Andy', 'be', 'running', 'company', 'Apple.Unfortunately', 'nobody', 'else', 'way', 'coworkers', 'are', 'chiefly', 'concerned', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'females', 'life', 'really', 'only', 'Trish', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'want', 'grow', 'up', 'More', 'later.David', 'most', 'well', 'rounded', 'Andy', 'work', 'friends', 'obsessed', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Mindy', 'Kaling', 'still', 'working', 'Office', 'gently', 'ease', 'Andy', 'dating', 'life', 'be', 'ringleader', 'group', 'reality', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'David', 'can', 'barely', 'contain', 'rage', 'being', 'dumped', 'especially', 'ex', 'speed-dating', 'contest.Jay', 'other', 'hand', 'rams', 'poor', 'Andy', 'most', 'awkward', 'terrifying', 'social', 'situations', 'dawg', 'cheating', 'long', 'time', 'girlfriend', 'Jill', 'Erica', 'Vittina', 'Phillips', 'reality', 'Jay', 'pathetically', 'insecure', 'getting', 'fights', 'customers', 'hilarious', 'confrontations', 'coworkers', 'especially', 'Mooj', 'played', 'Gerry', 'Bednob', '.Cal', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'pot', 'books', 'apparently', 'not', 'very', 'successful', 'Cal', 'Andy', 'just', 'ask', 'questions', 'parroting', 'back', 'women', 'say', 'Sadly', 'tactic', 'works', 'Andy', 'woman', 'snare', 'naughty', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Beth', 'not', 'someone', 'be', 'with.In', 'fact', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'anything', 'common', 'Andy', 'Trish', 'entrepreneur', 'street', 'who', 'stuff', 'Ebay', 'much', 'effort', 'Andy', 'up', 'getting', 'number', 'then', 'rest', 'film', 'wondering', 'what', 'do', 'it.At', 'first', 'blush', 'film', 'be', 'blistering', 'attack', 'geek', 'way', 'life', 'Andy', 'encouraged', 'grow', 'up', 'selling', 'toys', 'buying', 'car', 'closer', 'look', 'reveals', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'executive', 'producer', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'directed', 'Virgin', 'man', 'friend', 'geek', 'not', 'geek', 'himself.Sure', 'enough', 'Andy', 'macho', 'friends', 'growth', 'own', 'not', 'Andy', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'obsessive', 'Davids', 'girl-crazy', 'Jays', 'pot-sniffing', 'Cal', 'do', 'Well', 'everyone', 'Cal', 'process', 'Andy', 'shell', 'own', 'progressing', 'backroom', 'tech', 'guy', 'front', 'room', 'floor', 'manager', 'mustering', 'up', 'courage', 'pursue', 'one', 'woman', 'really', 'be', 'learn', 'lot', 'Andy', 'childish', 'sense', 'wonder', 'great', 'playmate', 'Trish', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Trish', 'incidentally', 'three', 'children', 'one', 'child', 'making', 'grandmother', 'Andy', 'abstinence', 'sex', 'great', 'role', 'model', 'Trish', 'middle', 'daughter', 'gentle', 'nature', 'excellent', 'salesperson', 'course', 'tech', 'savvy', 'making', 'great', 'techie.By', 'end', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'discover', 'joke', 'Apatow', 'laughing', 'laughing', 'Andy', 'Perhaps', 'being', 'geek', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'thing']",N/A

If the jokes go over the top, they risk losing a big chunk of the audience. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is sometimes funny, sometimes insightful, sometimes just crass, but it succeeds by virtue of its sincerity and supporting characters. Andy (Steve Carrell) is a nice guy with a nice apartment, a nice job, and barely a social life, which he seems to be happy with. His fellow employees at the electronics store like to get together, play some poker, and talk about their sexual experiences. So it doesn't take long for them to discover that Andy has no sexual experience. Andy's a virgin at age 40. The guys set out to help Andy fix his deficiency. Playboy Jay (Romany Malco), aspiring novelist Cal (Seth Rogen) and sentimental Dave (Paul Rudd) shower Andy with well-intentioned advice and put him on the prowl to find a willing woman.Steve Carrell makes Andy sincere in his embarrassment, his timidity, and his frustration at being sexually clueless. He gets credit for placing Andy within the bounds of believability, even though, when I think about it, he probably isn't. Sure, a middle-aged man without much social prowess could have missed the sexual boat entirely. But Andy doesn't seem to have been very interested in sex, and now suddenly he is...sort of. Jay, Cal, and Dave are interesting enough that I never got tired of watching them. And I'd like to have seen more of their boss Paula, played to domineering, libertine perfection by Jane Lynch. Catherine Keener is Trish, the forthright, down-to-earth woman of Andy's dreams. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" has a 2 hour 13 minute run time on DVD, whereas it ran 1 hour 55 minutes in theaters. I think most of the additional material involves the supporting cast, and a lot of it is quite funny. This isn't a film for everyone's taste, and it's too long for a comedy, but it has something for nearly everyone: sweetness and vulgarity all in one.The DVD (MCA 2005): Bonus features include: 3 deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Judd Apatow and actor Seth Rogen, extended versions of the ""Advice from Mooj"" (1 min)  and ""Date-a-Palooza"" (9 min) scenes, 3 short featurettes, a ""Gag Reel"" (4  min), and an audio commentary. About the 3 short features: ""My Dinner with Stormy"" (2 min) is a brief conversation between Seth Rogen and porn star Stormy, who makes a brief appearance in the film. ""Waxing Doc""(3  min) is a behind-the-scenes look at the waxing scene. ""Line-O-Rama"" (6 min) is a bunch of brief alternate takes from a variety of scenes, including some scenes that did not make the final cut. Of all these features, I recommend the ""Date-a-Palooza"" extended scene, which includes some funny stuff. The audio commentary is by director/co-writer Judd Apatow, actor/co-writer Steve Carrell, and 7 members of the cast.

While I admired Steve Carell's performance in BRUCE ALMIGHTY, he never really got the chance to branch out and this movie gave him the chance to flex his acting chops. While the ending of this movie was off the mark and truly strange, the majority of this movie is a lot of fun with laughs and moments galore.We follow the story of Andy, a 40 year old man who, to the surprise of his co-workers and especially his later love interest, is a virgin. He works at a Shop Tec store, and his boss, Paula, eventually seems to take an interest in just having some fun with Andy. But Andy doesn't get out much, and he has a huge collection of action figures that are worth a fortune (lol, if you sold them on Ebay). When his friends try every avenue to set him up with a willing and able girl, the results are hysterical. First off, Andy gets set up with a drunk girl who drives like a maniac and ends up puking on poor Andy. Much to his dismay, his friends think this is funny...but Andy isn't laughing. His friends just seem to try too hard, but when Andy runs into a beautiful single grandmother, a glimmer of hope rises within him. The rest of the movie is a barrel of laughs, with Andy trying to hide his ""virgin"" status from his new love, and trying to shake off his friends and his horny boss. The ending of the movie was very strange, and it actually took away from the power of the movie a bit. Why the director chose to end the movie this way makes no sense, but 90% of the movie is splendid. You'll have a lot of fun with this one.The acting in the movie is mostly what you'd expect from a comedy of this caliber, but Steve Carell gets a chance to shine and he really does more than that. His character is such a likable guy it's hard not to feel bad for him...except the moment when he gets drunk and will pretty much sleep with any girl. But his performance more than carries the film, and the rest of the cast is very likable, and Paul Rudd has a flat-out funny moment involving a videocam and his rear end. The movie has very strong elements of humanity and emotion, while at the same time entertaining us with top-notch comedy.So if you're looking for a really good laugh, you can't pass up this gem. While the ending leaves much to be desired, the rest of the film is a treat. And with a very genuine performance from Carell, 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN manages to shine through and entertain despite it's confusing and strange conclusion.",4,A Terrific Comedy...Carell Shines On His Own...,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,2540,"['just', 'recently', 'bought', 'THE', '40', 'YEAR', 'OLD', 'VIRGIN', 'high', 'hopes', 'having', 'heard', 'good', 'buzz', 'film', 'admired', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'performance', 'BRUCE', 'ALMIGHTY', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'chance', 'branch', 'out', 'movie', 'gave', 'chance', 'flex', 'acting', 'chops', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'mark', 'truly', 'strange', 'majority', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'laughs', 'moments', 'galore.We', 'follow', 'story', 'Andy', '40', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'surprise', 'co-workers', 'especially', 'later', 'love', 'interest', 'virgin', 'Shop', 'Tec', 'store', 'boss', 'Paula', 'eventually', 'take', 'interest', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'Andy', 'Andy', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'much', 'huge', 'collection', 'action', 'figures', 'are', 'fortune', 'lol', 'sold', 'Ebay', 'When', 'friends', 'try', 'avenue', 'set', 'up', 'willing', 'able', 'girl', 'results', 'are', 'hysterical', 'First', 'Andy', 'set', 'up', 'drunk', 'girl', 'who', 'maniac', 'up', 'puking', 'poor', 'Andy', 'Much', 'dismay', 'friends', 'think', 'funny', 'Andy', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'friends', 'just', 'seem', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'when', 'Andy', 'beautiful', 'single', 'grandmother', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'rises', 'rest', 'movie', 'barrel', 'laughs', 'Andy', 'trying', 'hide', 'virgin', 'status', 'new', 'love', 'trying', 'shake', 'off', 'friends', 'horny', 'boss', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'actually', 'took', 'away', 'power', 'movie', 'bit', 'Why', 'director', 'chose', 'end', 'movie', 'way', 'sense', '90', '%', 'movie', 'splendid', ""'ll"", 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'one.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'mostly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'comedy', 'caliber', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'chance', 'shine', 'really', 'more', 'character', 'such', 'likable', 'guy', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'bad', 'moment', 'when', 'drunk', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'sleep', 'girl', 'performance', 'more', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'very', 'likable', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'flat-out', 'funny', 'moment', 'involving', 'videocam', 'rear', 'end', 'movie', 'very', 'strong', 'elements', 'humanity', 'emotion', 'same', 'time', 'entertaining', 'top-notch', 'comedy.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'really', 'good', 'laugh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'gem', 'ending', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'rest', 'film', 'treat', 'very', 'genuine', 'performance', 'Carell', '40', 'YEAR', 'OLD', 'VIRGIN', 'shine', 'entertain', 'confusing', 'strange', 'conclusion']",N/A

That being said, I found this movie to be very 'offensive'.  The entire purpose of this film  seems to be getting a nice, shy guy and converting him into a womanizing scumbag like his coworkers.  They are 'teaching' him how.  Ok, I can deal with this.However, after the first 45 minutes of the movie being little more than repeated conversations degrading women, implying that women are only for sleeping with and using quite a bit of colorful language in which it attempts to ""more creatively"" degrade women, I was pretty much at the point where any humor that this movie is supposed to have was completely forgettable compared to the constant anti-women attitudes displayed here.  I don't consider myself a feminist or a prude, I've watched far more 'profane' films, but the thing is, if the script is written in such a way that something 'crude' makes you laugh?  Then its ok.  It works.  This doesn't.I didn't laugh a single time during this movie.  It just ...wasn't funny.  The sexual innuendo has all been seen before, it doesn't do anything new or innovative.

In attempt to spruce him up, they try to improve his appearance (the waxing scene) and trying to instruct him how to act with women.

When he meets a woman who works across the street at her EBay store, they tell him not to pursue her until he had had a few ""throw away women"".While this was full of hilarious awkward moments and mishaps, this does make some interesting points about our culture and sexuality.  Andy is an otherwise ok guy, if not a little nerdy, who has a full life without women and/or sex in it, and once it comes to light that he has never had sex people tell him what he should be wanting.  His friends are just as awkward as he is even though they think he is lacking.  One friend simply cannot get over his ex girlfriend who doesn't want anything to do with him anymore, and he goes so far as to say that he will declare a life of celebacy if he can't have her.  The big lumox friend seems the most genuine, but he's no more successful than Andy.  And last but not least, the black guy, seems to be the most crude of them all but when he is faced with the concrete responsibility of fatherhood he's not laughing anymore about his sexual conquests.  It was also funny to see the typical man's double standards: fear of commitment, wanting a woman lesser than they are so they won't feel inferior, and just wanting to be liked.But it had a good ending, that Andy gets the girl but grows up (selling his action figure collection) to win her over.  And when he official does IT, we all live happily ever after.  But that hoaky musical song and dance scene?  That was too silly.",4,"Who could it be?

If you like raunchy humor, you'll die from laughing so hard during this movie.Steve Carell is a comedic gem in this. He has the right look and acting chops to pull of how you'd think a 40 year old virgin would live is life. For example, his character Andy as an endless number of classic action figures that he collects in their ""orginal packages"" and has a custom made video game chair for playing his countless number of video games. Seeing that he co-wrote this film, proves that he is a comedic genius.The humor in this film does a great job of not being too over the top or have the jokes run too long. But this movie isn't just for those that like raunchy, sex humor. Soon after Andy (Steve Carell's character) meets a nice girl named Trish, the story kind of takes a turn and it becomes a very sweet love story between the two.I must say that just about every single character in this movie is funny. From Andy to all of his wild, hilarious friends that say priceless one liners and gags, you won't be able to stop laughing at these characters.Overall, this is definitely a great movie to see for some dirty jokes and a whole lot of laughs.

At a deeper level, however, it's an uplifting tale about a man discovering that life really can begin at 40, as his social, career and romantic prospects improve considerably. At a deeper level still, it's an educated and subtle exploration of the ways in which long-term relationships, and long-term friendships, are formed.The multiple layers of this film provide a wealth of comedy to suit a variety of tastes. Fortunately for me, I have a wide sense of humour and therefore enjoyed the film immensely. Others may find the cruder jokes, which in the unrated version of the DVD are extraordinary, a little off-putting. But, for most viewers, these jokes won't detract from the film's many charms.Steve Carrell, who plays the title character, puts in a thoughtful and amusing performance (as usual), and so do supporting players Catherine Keener, Romany Malco and Seth Rogan. But it's Paul Rudd who steals the show as an outwardly confident but inwardly obsessive, neurotic and perverted individual who is yet to come to terms with the fact his ""soulmate"" left him years ago.This is a unique and especially entertaining comedy.

636891,A1129LM24YWSZV,B00005JNZU,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[1, 1]","In The 40 Year-Old Virgin, Andy Stitzer (played by Steve Carell) leads a dull life. He works behind a desk at a chain electronics store. He lives alone. He plays the tuba, reads comic books, collects action figures, and rides his bike to work. Andy has few friends, and he spends most of his time at home, alone.One night, some of the guys Andy works with invite him to their poker group. (They are short one person, so they need someone to fill in.) During the evening of card playing, Andy's new friends find out that he is a virgin. Of course, everyone at the store immediately knows, and everyone wants to try and hook Andy up with someone to help him to lose his virginity.But here's the thing that makes the story interesting. Andy doesn't want to have sex with just ANYONE. He turns down the store manager and a tipsy bimbo he picks up at a bar. Andy has his sights set on Trish (played by Catherine Keener), a pretty single mom who sells trinkets on ebay. The story of their romance makes for a funny, warm, and ultimately satisfying ending to Andy's adventure.First of all, let me say that I am not usually a fan of bawdy comedies. Scatalogical humor usually does nothing for me. However, I thought this was a pretty good movie, largely due to the performance of Steve Carell. (There were a few bathroom scenes that made me cringe, but I can get over that because the rest of the content is good.) First of all, Carell's character is actually somewhat believable (exaggerated, perhaps, but believable), and Carell can actually ACT. I thought he did a good job creating Andy's persona, someone who has resigned himself to the fact that he may never have sex, and who tries to live his life without the kind of intimacy that most of us take for granted. Secondly, Andy's cadre of friends from work all turn in strong performances, and they all have subplots of their own. (David, played by Paul Rudd, is getting over a brief relationship. Jay, played by Romany Malco, cheats on his girlfriend but cowers before her.) What results is an engaging ensemble comedy. Language, nudity, and adult situations are found throughout the film, so it is only recommended for adult audiences.",3,Carell shines in bawdy adult comedy,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2185,"['40', 'Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Andy', 'Stitzer', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'dull', 'life', 'desk', 'chain', 'electronics', 'store', 'alone', 'tuba', 'comic', 'books', 'action', 'figures', 'bike', 'work', 'Andy', 'few', 'friends', 'most', 'time', 'home', 'alone.One', 'night', 'guys', 'Andy', 'invite', 'poker', 'group', 'are', 'short', 'one', 'person', 'need', 'someone', 'fill', 'evening', 'card', 'playing', 'Andy', 'new', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'virgin', 'course', 'everyone', 'store', 'immediately', 'everyone', 'try', 'hook', 'Andy', 'up', 'someone', 'help', 'lose', 'virginity.But', 'here', 'thing', 'story', 'interesting', 'Andy', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'sex', 'just', 'ANYONE', 'down', 'store', 'manager', 'tipsy', 'bimbo', 'up', 'bar', 'Andy', 'sights', 'set', 'Trish', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'pretty', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'trinkets', 'ebay', 'story', 'romance', 'funny', 'warm', 'ultimately', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Andy', 'adventure.First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'bawdy', 'comedies', 'Scatalogical', 'humor', 'usually', 'nothing', 'However', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'largely', 'due', 'performance', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'were', 'few', 'bathroom', 'scenes', 'made', 'cringe', 'can', 'get', 'rest', 'content', 'good', 'First', 'Carell', 'character', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'exaggerated', 'perhaps', 'believable', 'Carell', 'can', 'actually', 'ACT', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'Andy', 'persona', 'someone', 'who', 'resigned', 'fact', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'sex', 'who', 'live', 'life', 'kind', 'intimacy', 'most', 'take', 'granted', 'Secondly', 'Andy', 'cadre', 'friends', 'work', 'turn', 'strong', 'performances', 'have', 'subplots', 'own', 'David', 'played', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'getting', 'brief', 'relationship', 'Jay', 'played', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'cheats', 'girlfriend', 'cowers', 'What', 'results', 'engaging', 'ensemble', 'comedy', 'Language', 'nudity', 'adult', 'situations', 'are', 'found', 'film', 'only', 'recommended', 'adult', 'audiences']",N/A

And I was disappointed that it moved so quickly to the ""let's get Andy laid"" theme.  A more interesting film, I think, would have committed a little more firmly to the idea it flirted with -- a more realistic view of the social pressures that this guy would actually be feeling.  Instead, we spent a lot of time watching dysfunctional guys without a clue giving him bad advice.  I like Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen (pretty good performance by him, by the way...good to see him moving a little away from his usual one-note performance) but the interaction between their characters and our hero weren't designed to provide a memorable movie experience.  Strictly by the numbers, pretty erratic, mildly amusing.  In a week I won't remember much about it.****************Hey, I found myself in my Amazon profile, and checked out a few of my old reviews.  And found myself wanting to rework just one of them...this one.  In hindsight I would give this movie at least three stars.  I think much of my comments were overreactions to what I found to be excessive praise.  This is a solid comedy, with some fine comic actors doing good work.  And it deserves a little extra credit for paving the way for the terrific run of Apatow films we find ourselves in.  Apatow makes the rare comedy that I'm actually willing to spend money on, and that includes this one.  No classic, but a good way to spend some time.",2,"Not funny -- well yeah, it's got its moments",1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,1741,"['Pretty', 'overrated', 'movie', 'recurring', 'theme', 'reviews', 'saw', 'sweet', 'fairly', 'enlightened', 'better', ""'d"", 'think', 'Not', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'Worse', 'never', 'found', 'particularly', 'funny', 'guess', 'was', 'moderately', 'humorous', 'never', 'had', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'others', 'mention', 'was', 'disappointed', 'moved', 'so', 'quickly', 'let', 'get', 'Andy', 'laid', 'theme', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'committed', 'little', 'more', 'firmly', 'idea', 'flirted', 'more', 'realistic', 'view', 'social', 'pressures', 'guy', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'feeling', 'Instead', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'watching', 'dysfunctional', 'guys', 'clue', 'giving', 'bad', 'advice', 'like', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'pretty', 'good', 'performance', 'way', 'good', 'see', 'moving', 'little', 'away', 'usual', 'one-note', 'performance', 'interaction', 'characters', 'hero', 'were', ""n't"", 'designed', 'provide', 'memorable', 'movie', 'experience', 'Strictly', 'numbers', 'pretty', 'erratic', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'week', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'found', 'Amazon', 'profile', 'checked', 'out', 'few', 'old', 'reviews', 'found', 'wanting', 'rework', 'just', 'one', 'one', 'hindsight', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'least', 'three', 'stars', 'think', 'much', 'comments', 'were', 'overreactions', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'excessive', 'praise', 'solid', 'comedy', 'fine', 'comic', 'actors', 'doing', 'good', 'work', 'little', 'extra', 'credit', 'paving', 'way', 'terrific', 'run', 'Apatow', 'films', 'find', 'Apatow', 'rare', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'actually', 'willing', 'spend', 'money', 'one', 'classic', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'time']",N/A

He's believable as the Virgin, and in the more serious scenes, his talent as an actor is proven in his believability. His comic timing is wonderful, and in the scenes with his various conquests, his physical slapstick is top-notch.It's not all good news, though. There are scenes throughout this movie where you just know that ad-libbing was the order of the day, and unfortunately, in places this stands out a mile as simply amateurish. Some of the exchanges between Paul Rudd & Seth Rogan smack of childishness, and Romany Malco as Jay gives a cliched and one-dimensional performance as the token black friend - situations and characters that, quite simply, should have been funnier.The direction by Judd Apatow is pretty solid, if uninspired, comedy fare, and while the script is a lot more intelligent than you'd expect for a movie of this nature, it's also got a big dose of pedestrianism to keep this sometimes-excellent effort just on the wrong side of Average. Also, the movie is too long - at just over two hours, what essentially could have been a tight, polished eighty or ninety minute script begins to drag towards the end.Decent enough, ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" certainly isn't the best comedy of recent times, but neither is it the worst - far from it - and, if you're prepared to put up with a lack of pace towards the film's end, as well as a few script issues, then you'll enjoy it for what it is: a likeable, average comedy with more than enough laughs to keep you occupied for the duration.",3,"Entertaining, if a little lightweight...",1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,2213,"['What', 'do', 'do', 'when', ""'re"", 'forty', 'years', 'old', 'colleagues', 'take', 'sudden', 'interest', 'total', 'lack', 'sex', 'life', 'incorrect', 'answer', 'question', 'subject', 'hilarious', 'oftentimes', 'boring', 'movie', 'starring', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'titular', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin.Buffered', 'bouyed', 'along', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'very', 'hilarious', 'double', 'acts', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Gerry', 'Bednob', 'Shelley', 'Malil', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Paula', 'most', 'sexually', 'inappropriate', 'boss', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'big-screen', 'outing', 'date', 'almost-bravuro', 'performance', 'Andy', 'Stitzer', 'believable', 'Virgin', 'more', 'serious', 'scenes', 'talent', 'actor', 'proven', 'believability', 'comic', 'timing', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'various', 'conquests', 'physical', 'slapstick', 'top-notch.It', 'not', 'good', 'news', 'though', 'are', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'just', 'know', 'ad-libbing', 'was', 'order', 'day', 'unfortunately', 'places', 'out', 'mile', 'simply', 'amateurish', 'exchanges', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'smack', 'childishness', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'Jay', 'cliched', 'one-dimensional', 'performance', 'token', 'black', 'friend', 'situations', 'characters', 'quite', 'simply', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'funnier.The', 'direction', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'pretty', 'solid', 'uninspired', 'comedy', 'fare', 'script', 'lot', 'more', 'intelligent', ""'d"", 'expect', 'movie', 'nature', 'also', 'got', 'big', 'dose', 'pedestrianism', 'keep', 'sometimes-excellent', 'effort', 'just', 'wrong', 'side', 'Average', 'Also', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'what', 'essentially', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tight', 'polished', 'eighty', 'ninety', 'minute', 'script', 'drag', 'end.Decent', 'enough', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'best', 'comedy', 'recent', 'times', 'worst', 'far', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'put', 'up', 'lack', 'pace', 'film', 'end', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'script', 'issues', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'what', 'likeable', 'average', 'comedy', 'more', 'enough', 'keep', 'occupied', 'duration']",N/A

Well, we have a relatively harmless guy whose advice from friends gets blown out of proportion because they're trying to ""help"". It ends up happy & sweet, but not before all kinds of crazy stuff happens. The film is hysterical, and quite original in its delivery. I won't say anything else about the film that isn't assumed from it's title, but the DVD has extras that will keep any staid person in hysterics, especially the ""How do I know you're gay"" segment. How Seth Rogan & Paul Rudd kept a straight face during that is amazing. It's such a parody on macho-male one-upmanship, and totally silly.  Excellent direction from Judd Apatow keeps everything in order, as the improvisational skills of Steve Carrell & cronies create a most pleasant and entertaining film.

If you are a Steve Carrell fan you can probably avert your gaze or push the ""mute"" button on the remote for some of these gratuituous sexual references, but they come at you too fast to avoid.The makers of this movie had an easy choice to make.  They could make a funny movie with a decent cast around Steve Carrell, or they could make the same movie except make it 20 minutes longer with as many tired and overdone sex jokes as they could possibly load into it.  They went the latter route.Be careful who you watch this DVD with.  It's not just a funny ha-ha date movie, or even a movie to watch with your wife.  In fact, I can't quite imagine how any female could possibly be stoic enough to put up with all the degrading humor which is basically bachelor party gone wild.  Yes, definitely a bachelor party movie.  Don't bring the kids or females.But that's too bad because Carrell is a good enough actor to explore ""virgin"" territory and make a character who is not a cliche' but who is a believable product of our culture, even working in the ebay culture (""Don't you know they are worth more when they are not unwrapped?"") that says life is about collecting valuable things and not enjoying them.  This morphs into life is about feeling safe and not getting out of your shell.  Carrell does this part very well, very believably.The sheer lack of couth of the movie can put off even the coarsest of bar-buddies.  It's a struggle to keep watching.Too bad.

636921,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNZU,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 6]","**1/2""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" wins the award for being the dirtiest, most foulmouthed version of ""Pygmalion"" this side of ""My Bare Lady.""As the title explicitly states, this is the story of a man who has somehow managed to avoid having sex for the first four decades of his life, and the attempts on the part of his co-workers to see that he doesn't make it five. Thus, once they get over the shock of Andy Stitzer`s little secret, these helpful buddies spend the remainder of the movie coaching and grooming him in the fine art of sexual conquest and romantic seduction.The problem with ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" is that it can't decide whether it wants to be a crude, gross-out raunch-fest or a sweet, warmhearted romantic comedy.  By trying to succeed at both, it manages to succeed at neither.  For all the filmmakers' attempts to meld them, the two very different halves just keep canceling one another out.Yet, as with any film that aspires to make us laugh, ""Virgin"" must finally be adjudged a success or failure based not on how wild or tame it is, but on how funny.  And, unfortunately, there just isn't very much humor to be found in this film, with the setups and jokes feeling mighty thin and painfully obvious for the most part, and the movie never seeming to know when to leave well enough alone. The ""well enough"" are the two lead performers - Steve Carell and Katherine Keener - who are both tremendously natural and likable performers and who could really make us care about their characters if the film weren`t so cluttered with extraneous elements and subsidiary characters, and so tedious and drawn out in its execution.  For, indeed, ""Virgin"" flies right in the face of that unwritten law of moviemaking that decrees that no comedy should ever even approach a two-hour running time, let alone exceed it.  Yet, clocking in at a whopping 128 minutes, the film begins to feel aimless and endless, with long stretches of time between all-too-infrequent laughs.",2,could have been a whole lot funnier,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,1976,"['**1/2', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'award', 'being', 'dirtiest', 'most', 'foulmouthed', 'version', 'Pygmalion', 'side', 'Bare', 'Lady', 'title', 'explicitly', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'somehow', 'managed', 'avoid', 'having', 'sex', 'first', 'four', 'decades', 'life', 'attempts', 'part', 'co-workers', 'see', ""n't"", 'make', 'five', 'Thus', 'once', 'get', 'shock', 'Andy', 'Stitzer', 's', 'little', 'secret', 'helpful', 'buddies', 'spend', 'remainder', 'movie', 'coaching', 'grooming', 'fine', 'art', 'sexual', 'conquest', 'romantic', 'seduction.The', 'problem', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'crude', 'gross-out', 'raunch-fest', 'sweet', 'warmhearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'trying', 'succeed', 'succeed', 'filmmakers', 'attempts', 'meld', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'halves', 'just', 'keep', 'canceling', 'one', 'out.Yet', 'film', 'make', 'laugh', 'Virgin', 'must', 'finally', 'be', 'adjudged', 'success', 'failure', 'based', 'not', 'how', 'wild', 'tame', 'how', 'funny', 'unfortunately', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'setups', 'jokes', 'feeling', 'mighty', 'thin', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'never', 'seeming', 'know', 'when', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'well', 'enough', 'are', 'two', 'lead', 'performers', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Katherine', 'Keener', 'who', 'are', 'tremendously', 'natural', 'likable', 'performers', 'who', 'could', 'really', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'film', 'weren', 't', 'so', 'cluttered', 'extraneous', 'elements', 'subsidiary', 'characters', 'so', 'tedious', 'drawn', 'out', 'execution', 'indeed', 'Virgin', 'flies', 'right', 'face', 'unwritten', 'law', 'moviemaking', 'comedy', 'should', 'ever', 'even', 'approach', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'let', 'alone', 'exceed', 'clocking', 'whopping', '128', 'minutes', 'film', 'feel', 'aimless', 'endless', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'all-too-infrequent', 'laughs']",N/A

It has its moments, but for the most part I find it crude, unfunny and even boring. Carell's character is likeable enough, but it does not allow for his comedic talents, which are considerable, to be fleshed out. Andy (Carell) is suitably loser-like: he has comic book paraphernalia in every room and he rides a bicycle as his sole mode of transportation. Catherine Keener does a good job, as always, as Andy's quirky love interest. His co-workers, on the other hand, are very vulgar and not likeable at all. Who really swears that much? The love story is sweet enough, though nothing much of interest happens over the course of the film and even the much heralded hair waxing scene doesn't live up to its reputation.

636928,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JNZU,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 5]","Judd Apatow's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" could have been just another crude sex-comedy, focusing on the guy's perspective, dropping in some funny jokes along with some T&A;, and with a bevy of cardboard cut-out roles for the female actors to fill.  Sure, the movie focuses on ""the guys,"" and there are many funny jokes and some T&A;, but the movie breaks from the genre with its female lead, Catherine Keener, who plays Trish, the ""hot grandma.""As everyone knows, ""Virgin"" tells the story of Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell's breakout performance) whose plight is given away by the title.  Andy, scarred by some hilarious missteps in his early romantic life, has retreated into a bizarre cocoon more suited to a prepubescent 12-year old.  His apartment is crammed with toys (""collectibles,"" he defensively dubs them).  He has a framed poster from the 80's ""supergroup"" Asia on his wall.  He rides a bike to work -- and it ain't a motorbike.  Andy is one of those guys who is so nice and polite that people start wondering if he's actually a serial killer.That all changes when ""the guys"" from Andy's workplace at the home electronics store (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogan) invite Andy to poker night.  Trying pathetically to spin a guy-yarn about sex, Andy gives up his secret.  Andy's deflowering becomes the ""cause"" of this merry band.In the hands of a lesser team, this could have been another pathetic retread of ""Van Wilder""-style humor.  And sure, there are some crude jokes, as when Andy learns the hard way that a ""drunk chick"" he's been advised to hit on had shellfish earlier that day.  And when a buxom brunette cheerily prattles on during a speed-date with Andy even though her blouse has flopped open.  These are funny, but we've seen these jokes before.What we haven't seen before is the personal arc for a comic lead like Andy.  Sure, we expect Kevin Kline to undergo some personal growth in ""Dave,"" or for Billy Crystal to finally grow up in ""When Harry Met Sally.""  But for Andy, a lead in what would otherwise be a sex farce, to grow and mature the way he does in ""Virgin"" is just plain unexpected.  And it also works.Andy's storyline largely works because of his romantic interest, Trish.  Catherine Keener runs the ""We Sell Your Stuff on EBay"" store across the parking lot from Andy, and these two are instantly attracted to each other but are barred from acting on it.  Andy, because he can't act on any romantic impulse, and Trish, because she's had bad luck with men and has three kids already -- one with her own kid.  This makes Trish the ""world's hottest grandma"" -- sort of a G-MILF.Keener usually plays uber-confident, sarcastic characters -- see her work in ""Being John Malkovic.""  Here, she plays Trish as loving, smart, but very vulnerable.  I didn't think Keener had a vulnerable bone in her body, but her work here is impressive.  Trish and Andy would be dubbed ""soulmates"" in a lesser script.But don't misunderstand me - ""Virgin"" is not ""When Harry Met Sally.""  This is a laugh-out-loud comedy, with its fair share of slapstick.  But this is high-minded, original stuff, and you're never going to see some of these jokes coming.  I don't want to give anything away, but I was as surprised and laughing as hard at this flick's use of ""Age of Aquarius"" as I was at the ""battle of the anchormen"" from ""Anchorman.""  And that's saying something.The only criticism I have of the movie is that it's a mite long -- almost 2 hours.

It is an important aspect of the 21 century that we are now learning from film and television about the different ways that men and women actually are as opposed to the stereotypical gender roles portrayed in the past.  This acts as a way of freeing us from rigid behavior--enlarging the range of behavior and choices for all.  At the same time we have to remember that this increases anxiety due to having to make choices as opposed to having standards that one either lives up to or fails.2.  Fun male repartee.  Some of the best aspects of the film was the conversation between the men in the film.  In particular I enjoyed that there was a Pakistani and other middle eastern male who related with the other men--some of my favorite scenes included these talented comics and acted to portray an endearing yet funny portrait of American Arabs without stereotyping.I was disappointed that while the film created more opportunity for heterosexual males, the extensive ""Do you know how I know you are gay"" repartee was not balanced in some way to destigmatize being gay--it would have been in keeping with the anti-macho male message of the film if one of the characters were in fact gay and able to answer this question in a way that included gay males instead of making it that no matter how weird these guys were--at least they weren't gay.Overall a promising and interesting film, with a few major flaws making it score a little under par.",4,Challenging the male archetype!,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,1558,"['was', 'really', '3.5', 'five', 'stars', 'rating', 'things', 'liked', 'geniuinely', 'different', 'protagonist', 'important', 'aspect', '21', 'century', 'are', 'now', 'learning', 'film', 'television', 'different', 'ways', 'men', 'women', 'actually', 'are', 'opposed', 'stereotypical', 'gender', 'roles', 'portrayed', 'past', 'way', 'freeing', 'rigid', 'behavior', 'enlarging', 'range', 'behavior', 'choices', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'remember', 'anxiety', 'due', 'having', 'make', 'choices', 'opposed', 'having', 'standards', 'one', 'up', 'fails.2', 'Fun', 'male', 'repartee', 'best', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'conversation', 'men', 'film', 'particular', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'Pakistani', 'other', 'middle', 'eastern', 'male', 'who', 'related', 'other', 'men', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'included', 'talented', 'comics', 'acted', 'portray', 'endearing', 'yet', 'funny', 'portrait', 'American', 'Arabs', 'stereotyping.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'created', 'more', 'opportunity', 'heterosexual', 'males', 'extensive', 'Do', 'know', 'how', 'know', 'are', 'gay', 'repartee', 'was', 'not', 'balanced', 'way', 'destigmatize', 'being', 'gay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'keeping', 'anti-macho', 'male', 'message', 'film', 'one', 'characters', 'were', 'fact', 'gay', 'able', 'answer', 'question', 'way', 'included', 'gay', 'males', 'instead', 'making', 'matter', 'how', 'weird', 'guys', 'were', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'gay.Overall', 'promising', 'interesting', 'film', 'few', 'major', 'flaws', 'making', 'score', 'little', 'par']",N/A

I had heard so many good things about this movie that my expectations were very high. And I have to say that initially I felt disappointed.The plot can be summed up simply by the title of the movie and is driven by the hero's search for not so much sexual fulfillment as release.  The movie did not start well.  The hero's friends were a group of unlikeable, crude misogynists.  The humour was obvious and bordering on offensive.  The vision of modern dating was, well, depressing.  However, things began to improve hugely with the entrance of Catherine Keener's character.  Here at last was a real person who had real relationships.

Each character has his or her own personality and funny take on Andy's dilemma and the scenes where they try to ""help"" relieve him of his condition work very well.  (The drunk driver scene was great).The second half developed the relationship between Andy and Catherine Keener's character.  (Is this the first film where Catherine Keener plays such a lovable, less-severe character?  She does it extremely well).  Although I thought the final musical number was silly, I liked the overall feel of this movie.In today's mocking and very crude comedies, I expected the filmmakers to heap massive amounts of shame and humiliation on the character of a 40 year old virgin, but I liked the way they handled everything.  I also thought it was well written: just about everything in it connects to something sooner or later, so some thought went into the screenplay--and how many comedies can you say that about these days?(I also liked the Michael McDonald DVD that's constantly played in the electronics store too...which I have...but I'm not a virgin....)",4,Better Than Most Modern Comedies,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,1371,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'Unrated', 'Version', 'THE', '40', 'YEAR', 'OLD', 'VIRGIN', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release.The', 'film', 'actually', 'felt', 'two', 'stories.The', 'first', 'half', 'focused', 'relationship', 'Andy', 'Virgin', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'hilarious', 'co-workers', 'electronics', 'store', 'character', 'own', 'personality', 'funny', 'take', 'Andy', 'dilemma', 'scenes', 'where', 'try', 'help', 'relieve', 'condition', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'drunk', 'driver', 'scene', 'was', 'great', '.The', 'second', 'half', 'developed', 'relationship', 'Andy', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'character', 'first', 'film', 'where', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'plays', 'such', 'lovable', 'less-severe', 'character', 'extremely', 'well', 'thought', 'final', 'musical', 'number', 'was', 'silly', 'liked', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie.In', 'today', 'mocking', 'very', 'crude', 'comedies', 'expected', 'filmmakers', 'heap', 'massive', 'amounts', 'shame', 'humiliation', 'character', '40', 'year', 'old', 'virgin', 'liked', 'way', 'handled', 'everything', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'just', 'everything', 'something', 'sooner', 'later', 'thought', 'went', 'screenplay', 'how', 'many', 'comedies', 'can', 'say', 'days', 'also', 'liked', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'DVD', 'constantly', 'played', 'electronics', 'store', 'too', 'have', ""'m"", 'not', 'virgin']",N/A
636954,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JNZU,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 2]","Director:  Judd ApatowCast:  Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob.Running Time:  116 minutesRated R for pervasive sexual content, language and some drug use.The key to ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is not merely that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but rather the manner in which Steve Carell presents him as one. In a genre of crass ""comedy"" that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters, ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" offers a colorful cast and an intelligent, heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes. That Andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke, in fact, as it is a curiosity.  Carell, a veteran of Team Ferrell in ""Anchorman"" and an ex-""Daily Show"" castmember, uses the concept of the film to expand his character - we get to understand why Andy is the way he is. It's the little things that make this film work. When Andy's co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend, Andy describes his failed efforts at cooking. When Andy rides his bike to work, he signals his turns. He doesn't just adorn his home with action figures:  he paints them, and talks to them, and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood. A lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things.The plot is fairly simplistic:  Andy's co-worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman. It's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility.  Andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a womanizing ladies' man and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. Their attempts at getting Andy in the sack backfire numerous times, and each time leaves Andy feeling less and less optimistic.  Finally Andy meets single mom Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and, much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it, he falls in love with her. They begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days, yet Trish being unaware that Andy is still a virgin.""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" was directed by Judd Apatow, the man who produced ""Anchorman"" and ""The Cable Guy"", and began the short-lived cult TV show ""Freaks and Geeks"".  Apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor, and the script, co-written by Carell, offers plenty; however, in the end the most interesting and (indeed surprising) aspect of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is its maturity.  We like Andy. We care about him. He's not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy clich&eacute;; he's a real, living, breathing person. His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety. His friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet. It strikes a chord with the audience.  Although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor, it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen. The best sex comedies work this way, from ""Risky Business"" to ""American Pie"", and that is the major difference between something like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""40 Days and 40 Nights"".

636955,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JNZU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 4]","Have I entered the Twilight Zone? Two weekends in August and four above average films released by major film studios. What's happening? Usually the first weekend of August is the last hope for any film resembling entertainment. Any Friday beyond that is traditionally reserved for the dregs lining the studio vault. You know, films like ""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo."" But in the last two weeks, the studios seem to be trying to buck the trend by releasing four films that are above average. Last weekend, I was surprised at how well-written ""The Skeleton Key"" was and also with the quality of Mark Wahlberg's performance and the uncompromising action in ""Four Brothers"".Buoyed by good reviews, I attended a sold out Friday night performance of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", Steve Carrell's (perhaps the best thing about ""Bruce Almighty"", NBC's Americanized ""The Office"") first starring role. It was, simply put, extremely funny.Andy (Carrell), the receiving manager at an electronics chain store (think ""The Good Guys"") in the Valley, lives a happy life. He wakes up every morning, makes a nice breakfast, rides his bike to work, returns home to watch ""Survivor"" with the elderly neighbors upstairs, plays some video games and then goes to bed. Andy is the type guy who lines his walls with action figures still sealed in their original boxes. He accepts an invitation to play poker with some of his co-workers and the conversation turns to women; David (Paul Rudd) is still trying to get over his breakup two years ago, Jay (Romany Malco) is in a relationship but also likes to play around and insists that this makes his relationship stronger and Cal (Seth Rogen), Andy's co-worker in receiving, is a tall guy who is into some kinky stuff. After the guys relate outlandish stories about sex, its Andy's turn and he gamely tries to convince them that he has had sex. They quickly pick up on the fact that he is a 40 year old virgin and insist on helping him overcome this obstacle, making it a quest. Each provides him with their own ideas on how to have sex and/ or find a girl to date. Then Andy meets Trish (Catherine Keener) the owner of an ""I Will Sell It On EBay For You"" store across the street.""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", written by Carrell and Apatow, who also directed, is a very funny, refreshingly sweet and vulgar comedy about a man trying to navigate the murky waters of dating and relationships for the first time in his life. Notice how I said the film was sweet and vulgar? Those aren't words you would often use together to describe a comedy, but they are perfectly fitting here. The film blends a lot of references to sex, sexual acts and lewd behavior with a story that is surprisingly sweet and refreshing.The key to the success of ""Virgin"" lies in Steve Carrell. His performance is similar to Will Ferrell's in ""Elf"". These performances made the films. If a more famous, perhaps better known comedian had taken on this project, I don't think Andy would have been portrayed with a sweet innocence underlined with a mild desperation, as Carrell. Carrell manages to portray his desperation while maintaining his desire to be a decent person. Throughout the film, he gets into a series of situations, most with hugely funny payoffs which rob the character of his dignity. But because Carrell plays the character so earnestly, this only serves to make the situations that much more funny. This is a star making turn; much like ""Elf"" was for Ferrell. Hopefully, Carrell will be able to avoid the tiresome projects Ferrell has been participating in lately. Films like ""Bewitched"" and ""Kicking and Screaming"". What is he thinking? Actually, Ferrell must be letting the $20 million paychecks he gets for each of the films cloud his judgement.If ""Virgin"" only had the one character, it would probably be a pretty good film, but the film is filled with interesting, funny performances complimenting Andy beautifully. Catherine Keener's Trish is a refreshing addition to the film. From her first appearance, she manages to convey so much about her life. She is unsure of what kind of a VCR to buy when she comes into the shop. Andy ends up helping her and Trish is a little unsure of what to say, not very knowledgeable about electronics, and maybe a little embarrassed about her store, where she sells things for other people on eBay. As we get to know Trish, she seems to be the perfect fit for Andy. The performance is really amazingly multifaceted and has many different little quirks and levels which I can't reveal here.Each of Andy's co-workers is also interesting and fresh, representing a different heightened aspect of the male personality. They urge him to do different things, like look for the most drunk woman in a group, participate in a speed dating hour, hit on a woman who works in a local bookstore by only asking her questions and acting like a bit of a jerk, and more. David is perhaps the most centered, but even he has been pining two years for an ended relationship that lasted four months. Rudd is very funny as he tries to maintain a balance of acting normal while surrounded by his loony friends. Jay is perhaps the most vulgar of the group, a real horn dog; he doesn't seem to have an ounce of respect in his body for his girlfriend. Romany Malco does a great job with this performance, embracing it fully, not worrying whether people are offended by what he is saying. Cal, played by Seth Rogen, is perhaps the most interesting, simply because he seems to be the most normal, until he starts speaking. He is clearly a little bit of a deviant, especially after he relates the story of a recent trip. These characters help to make the film funny and human, because each of them has a moment when their belief systems are shot down.The minor characters are also very funny. Paula, the store manager, played by Jane Lynch, has a memorable scene with Andy. Two employees, Mooj and Haziz, are also very funny and memorable. And Andy goes out with some truly strange women; perhaps the most memorable is Nicky, played by Leslie Mann, a raging alcoholic who decides to give Andy a try, with very humorous and gross results.My only complaint, and in the case of ""Virgin"", its a small one, is the film is too long. At almost 2 hours, the film would have been a lot stronger if say 10 or 15 minutes had been shaved from some of the `wacky' dates Andy goes on. But that is a small complaint.As the film progresses, you realize that the R rating is well-earned. Much like the recent ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Four Brothers', it is refreshing to watch R-rated films. The subject matter is not altered or destroyed by a studio's lame attempts to earn a PG or PG-13 and more widespread acceptance. Because these filmmakers are able to tell the story in an appropriate tone, I have no doubt that ""Virgin"" will join ""Wedding Crashers"" as two of the most successful films of the year.",4,"Extremely Funny, Sweet and Vulgur.

636956,A233QN6P2EEKPS,B00005JNZU,Tom Collier,"[4, 4]","They say that a tragedy is when something bad happens to you. On the other hand, a comedy is when something bad happens to someone else. Thus would seem to be the premise for The 40-Year Old Virgin, a film with a surprisingly efficient yet slightly misleading title.Virgin's topic is Andy, a 40 year old electronics store clerk who has never done the deed. Shy and sweet, he sits alone in an apartment filled with an action figure collection so geeky it includes the Six-Million Dollar Man's boss. When trading sex stories with his buddies one night, everyone is shocked to learn they have a virgin in their midst. Andy matter-of-factly explains that he came close in his youth, but simply stopped trying; having sex wasn't his Holy Grail of existence. Nonetheless, Andy's friends make it their pet project to get him laid.Much of the film's strength lies in that it is not a mean-spirited tirade against people like Andy, but a sometimes too sweet comedy about sex and virginity. Unlike the dreadful Wedding Crashers, the writers of The 40 Year-Old Virgin actually bothered to write a script, creating unique and often hilarious characters. Steve Carell avoids playing Andy as a horrifically crippled nerd, instead making him a nice guy who's nice nature has automatically cut him off from most women. The three friends initially seem like stereotypical jerks, but their roles are well written enough that they all function well within the plot. Paul Rudd plays David, the guy we have all seen before, obsessed with a relationship that ended a long time ago. Seth Rogen's  Cal swaggers about as if he has been laid a billion times and suggests dating drunks, while Romany Malco `s Jay has been laid a billion times, much to the chagrin of his wife. In short, Andy is by far the most stable and happy of his friends, blasting away the notion that sex is key to a fulfilling existence.Unfortunately, the film throws away this effective message when Andy meets Trish(Catherine Keener), a single-mom who runs an Ebay store. Andy and her magically get along wonderfully, and even though he has another botched attempt at sex, the two agree to wait through 20 dates before sealing the deal. At the film's end, the two are married, and have sex that is accompanied by a disastrously unfunny musical number.Was it really necessary for the two of them to have sex? Certainly sex is one of those life experiences we all want, but the first half of the film was really on to something; sex does not make anyone happy, and you can live a fine life without it. By letting Andy score in the end, that message is replaced with one of the American Pie mentality, in which sex is the ultimate goal, without which you are not complete as a person. The characters benefit from the film's overly saccharine nature; all of their flaws are pointed out but none of them are really taken to task for their mistakes. The 40 Year-Old Virgin is a nice film, but wouldn't a nicer film have stuck to the message that sex isn't everything? Wouldn't a smarter film have shown that real life sexual obstacles are not so easily overcome? Yes, on both accounts.",3,Funny Virgin Disappoints Upon Reflection,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,3128,"['say', 'tragedy', 'when', 'something', 'bad', 'other', 'hand', 'comedy', 'when', 'something', 'bad', 'someone', 'else', 'Thus', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'premise', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'efficient', 'yet', 'slightly', 'misleading', 'title.Virgin', 'topic', 'Andy', '40', 'year', 'old', 'electronics', 'store', 'clerk', 'who', 'never', 'done', 'deed', 'Shy', 'sweet', 'alone', 'apartment', 'filled', 'action', 'figure', 'collection', 'so', 'geeky', 'Six-Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'boss', 'When', 'trading', 'sex', 'stories', 'buddies', 'one', 'night', 'everyone', 'shocked', 'learn', 'have', 'virgin', 'midst', 'Andy', 'matter-of-factly', 'came', 'close', 'youth', 'simply', 'stopped', 'trying', 'having', 'sex', 'was', ""n't"", 'Holy', 'Grail', 'existence', 'Nonetheless', 'Andy', 'friends', 'make', 'pet', 'project', 'get', 'laid.Much', 'film', 'strength', 'not', 'mean-spirited', 'tirade', 'people', 'Andy', 'sometimes', 'too', 'sweet', 'comedy', 'sex', 'virginity', 'dreadful', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'writers', '40', 'Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'actually', 'bothered', 'write', 'script', 'creating', 'unique', 'often', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'avoids', 'playing', 'Andy', 'horrifically', 'crippled', 'nerd', 'instead', 'making', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'nice', 'nature', 'automatically', 'cut', 'off', 'most', 'women', 'three', 'friends', 'initially', 'seem', 'stereotypical', 'jerks', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'enough', 'function', 'well', 'plot', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'David', 'guy', 'have', 'seen', 'obsessed', 'relationship', 'ended', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Cal', 'swaggers', 'been', 'laid', 'billion', 'times', 'dating', 'drunks', 'Romany', 'Malco', 's', 'Jay', 'been', 'laid', 'billion', 'times', 'much', 'chagrin', 'wife', 'short', 'Andy', 'far', 'most', 'stable', 'happy', 'friends', 'blasting', 'away', 'notion', 'sex', 'key', 'fulfilling', 'existence.Unfortunately', 'film', 'away', 'effective', 'message', 'when', 'Andy', 'Trish', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'single-mom', 'who', 'Ebay', 'store', 'Andy', 'magically', 'get', 'along', 'wonderfully', 'even', 'botched', 'attempt', 'sex', 'two', 'agree', 'wait', '20', 'dates', 'sealing', 'deal', 'film', 'end', 'two', 'are', 'married', 'have', 'sex', 'accompanied', 'disastrously', 'unfunny', 'musical', 'number.Was', 'really', 'necessary', 'two', 'have', 'sex', 'Certainly', 'sex', 'one', 'life', 'want', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'sex', 'not', 'make', 'anyone', 'happy', 'can', 'live', 'fine', 'life', 'letting', 'Andy', 'score', 'end', 'message', 'replaced', 'one', 'American', 'Pie', 'mentality', 'sex', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'are', 'not', 'complete', 'person', 'characters', 'benefit', 'film', 'overly', 'saccharine', 'nature', 'flaws', 'are', 'pointed', 'out', 'none', 'are', 'really', 'taken', 'task', 'mistakes', '40', 'Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'nice', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'nicer', 'film', 'have', 'stuck', 'message', 'sex', ""n't"", 'everything', 'Would', ""n't"", 'smarter', 'film', 'have', 'shown', 'real', 'life', 'sexual', 'obstacles', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'overcome', 'Yes', 'accounts']",N/A

There are too many extraneous characters, and too many moments where the script and direction try to squeeze out as much humor as possible, but fails.  What should have been a tight, breezy comedy is stretched into two hours of mugging and ""ha ha aren't we funny?"" type of film.  The lead actor and Catherine Keener are charming but too much time is given to the supporting characters, some who are funny, some not.

Also, i've never hung out with straight girls or guys so when i'm around them i can say i do act weird. So to conclude, the theme of this movie really does happen in real life with the people u work with. People are complaining that this movie is too sexual and too of an adult language. Hello! This is a rated R movie. And people are complaining that the script and how it was written is too far fetched and over the top. Hello? Men who work in non professional jobs do talk like that, even close male buddies talk like this when females aren't around.

I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ('The 40 Year Old Virgin') are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas.Of course, they're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for, and laugh at, anything.This film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'The Office', and people just love those mannerisms (Ricky Gervals is better in the same role, by the way...but that's neither here nor there).  It certainly couldn't be because it's funny.The general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise.  That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not.That concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive, yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not.That concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up's of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not.That concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not.You get the drift.  Maybe the boat left and I wasn't on the boat.  Maybe I'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles.If you like juvenile humor, watch something like 'Better Off Dead' or 'Caddyshack'.

Unfortunately it doesn't know how or when to end and, in the overstretched 134-minute unrated version at least, takes far too long to do so before throwing in a completely out of character plot contrivance.

I found it to be the funniest film that I have seen in a while, and funnier than Wedding Crashers.Steve Carrell (42) is Andy, a 40 year-old guy who works in an electronics store, who lives alone and who is very much like the nerd Comic Book guy. He has a huge collection of action figures that are still in their original packaging, paints minature action figures, and plays gladiator-type video games. He sort of gave up on women after a few failed relationships.Steve's co-workers figure out that he is a virgin and set out to help me get over it. Meanwhile, he meets up with Trish (45 year-old Catherine Keener, playing a 40 year-old), a businesswoman from across the street, who he really, really likes. At the same time, other ladies come into his life, in ways that are not too terribly convincing, but with hilarious consequences. During one lunch hour, they convince him to join them for turns out to be a speed dating club. Of course, he meets nothing but misfits while one of his co-workers meets an ex who he is still hung up on.In one scene, he goes for a hot waxing to remove his chest hair. There's no special effects here, they really do rip out his hair and it's both painfull and very funny at the same time.He relationship with Trish is not totally honest, however, as she doesn't know that he is a virgin!  Of course, along the way, she thinks he's some kind of deviant.When you scrape away all the crudeness, this film does have enough of a heart to make you not feel like you've watched something totally juvenille.The acting was solid all aroud.  Some of the scenes were a little unconvincing, like the woman who drives home from the bar (Leslie Mann), and the woman who works in the book store (Elizabeth Banks, Spider-Man 2's Miss Brant), and, not the least unconvincing, the boss at the electronics store (Jane Lynch, The Fugitive, The Aviator.)

Tis' the dawn of improvisational film comedy, and America is embracing it in a big way.  One can say that the funniest movies coming out today derive from the cast of this film or are connected to Judd Apatow in some way.  When we thought comedy was nearly dead in the film business, Apatow stepped in with a new method of obtaining hilarious memorable stories.  40 year old virgin is his first and best film that displays the enormous talent it takes to be stellar at improv.  My favorite comedies became his movies and other related ones as soon as this film came out.  40 Year Old Virgin is the dawn of a new age, and it's still arguably the best of its time.What we all need to recognize is that this film was incredibly lucky to have its cast.  Every single person in this film is really funny.  The movie is so enduring because it is perfectly casted and brilliantly created.  Although there is a lack of script, the improvisation created lines that we all still use to this day.  Critics may have bashed this film for targeting younger audiences with a fearless sex comedy, but its really more than that.  40 Year Old Virgin gave everybody a run for their money.  I could go on and say all the great things about it, but in all reality I can't find a bad thing about it, so I'll just call it a classic.On Blu-ray we get a sweet load of special features.  I'm still protesting the boring Universal menu system and their intolerable U-Control feature, but other than that the segments satisfy me.  I was happy to see a lot of outtakes and extended improv scenes.  As far as a blu-ray release goes, it was satisfactory, but you may not see much of an amazing transfer.  The picture is still a little uncrisped but as a comedy it doesn't have too many standards.If anyone hopes to brandish a collection of the best comedy films, they need this in their collection.  Steve Carell is an amazing actor and this is where his career really took off.  Not only did he get noticed, but actors like Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jane Lynch, Jonah Hill, Gerry Bednob, and Elizabeth Banks all took off in a big way after this film.  Not only did 40 Year Old Virgin last in the funny part of our brain, but it made history on several fronts.",5,"Best of Apatow, and a Classic Comedy",1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,2288,"['Boy', 'was', 'movie', 'slap', 'cheeck', 'nowhere', 'Tis', 'dawn', 'improvisational', 'film', 'comedy', 'America', 'embracing', 'big', 'way', 'One', 'can', 'say', 'funniest', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'today', 'derive', 'cast', 'film', 'are', 'connected', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'way', 'When', 'thought', 'comedy', 'was', 'nearly', 'dead', 'film', 'business', 'Apatow', 'stepped', 'new', 'method', 'obtaining', 'hilarious', 'memorable', 'stories', '40', 'year', 'old', 'virgin', 'first', 'best', 'film', 'enormous', 'talent', 'be', 'stellar', 'improv', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'became', 'movies', 'other', 'related', 'ones', 'as', 'soon', 'film', 'came', 'out', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'dawn', 'new', 'age', 'still', 'arguably', 'best', 'need', 'recognize', 'film', 'was', 'incredibly', 'lucky', 'have', 'cast', 'single', 'person', 'film', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'so', 'enduring', 'perfectly', 'casted', 'brilliantly', 'created', 'lack', 'script', 'improvisation', 'created', 'lines', 'still', 'use', 'day', 'Critics', 'may', 'have', 'bashed', 'film', 'targeting', 'younger', 'audiences', 'fearless', 'sex', 'comedy', 'really', 'more', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'gave', 'everybody', 'run', 'money', 'could', 'go', 'say', 'great', 'things', 'reality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'bad', 'thing', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'call', 'classic.On', 'Blu-ray', 'get', 'sweet', 'load', 'special', 'features', ""'m"", 'still', 'protesting', 'boring', 'Universal', 'menu', 'system', 'intolerable', 'U-Control', 'feature', 'other', 'segments', 'satisfy', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'lot', 'outtakes', 'extended', 'improv', 'scenes', 'As', 'far', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'was', 'satisfactory', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'amazing', 'transfer', 'picture', 'still', 'little', 'uncrisped', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'many', 'standards.If', 'anyone', 'brandish', 'collection', 'best', 'comedy', 'films', 'need', 'collection', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'amazing', 'actor', 'where', 'career', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'get', 'noticed', 'actors', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Gerry', 'Bednob', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'took', 'off', 'big', 'way', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'did', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'last', 'funny', 'part', 'brain', 'made', 'history', 'several', 'fronts']",N/A

As are a fool and his virginity, those responsible for this wretched offering entitled *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* would have us believe.Do not, however, simply take me on my word that this film is wretched.  Rather, examine, as I have, the film's leitmotif: a modern version of the ""problem play"" so very popular in Elizabethan/Jacobean England (The Bard even wrote one and called it *Measure for Measure*), *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* invites us to consider Andy Stitzer's--the titular virgin's--condition as aberrant, strange. Having sex early in life, and having it often, then, is apparently as normative an experience for the typical American as his first NASCAR race or clean twelve-point-buck kill.Andy Stitzer, on the other hand, has somehow managed to skip this quintessentially American initiatory rite--a rite that inevitably brings one to the inestimable and inexhaustible pleasures of highly mediated consumerist hedonism--opting instead for the hyperfetishism typical of those in a state of arrested development peculiar to pimply pre-adolescence and involving TV-show action figures left in their packaging.  One, in other words, that centers on junk-culture collectibles, those relics of a more idyllic age when one's existence remained unimpinged upon by biological imperatives.Andy Stitzer, with the aid of several friends and co-workers, nevertheless lifts from the sociological bywater he has found himself in and brought to the golden shores of coitus.As you can see, the above synopsis fairly captures the dramatic arc of *The 40-Year-Old Virgin.*  Thus, seemingly aware of this paucity (I couldn't help but think while watching the film that it could have been dispensed with much more deftly in a five-minute *Saturday Night Live* skit) the filmmakers liberally lard their product with gratuitous vulgarity.If you want to see palpable evidence of The Culture Industry's creative bankruptcy, then by all means watch this film.  If, however, you realize that you will die one day, and that the two-plus hours which *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* will claim from you are too precious, too irreplaceable to be wasted, then find some other way to beguile your Friday or Saturday evening.

636971,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00005JNZU,Wheelchair Assassin,"[4, 7]","Hmmm, what to say about The 40-Year-Old Virgin?  Well, how about this: it's certainly not in the Pantheon of great comedies that includes such names as Dr. Strangelove, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and Rushmore, but it's significantly better than such recent efforts as, say, Wedding Crashers or any American Pie movie.  If anything, it's sort of in the silly, aimless mold of Anchorman--there isn't much of a plot per se, as the movie is basically a bunch of comedic set pieces held together by the thread of a mild-mannered guy named Andy trying to score for the first time at age 40.  It's sort of a pastiche of styles, as there are elements of slapstick physical comedy, sex comedy, and the coming-of-age story, but Judd Apatow (who wrote and directed the movie) makes it work with the same wit and depth that characterized his outrageously underappreciated TV show Undeclared.The unrated version is way too long for this type of movie (although you're rewarded for sitting through it with some gratuitous nudity), and there are a few dead spots, especially in the later going, but when this movie gets moving it is pretty hilarious.  Anyone who's seen Anchorman should know Steve Carell is a skilled comedian, and in the title role of Andy he makes for the quintessential awkward guy who's so innocently clueless that he's actually a bit creepy (to the point that one of his co-workers thinks he might be a serial killer).  Andy really is the sort of guy you would look at and think he is a virgin-he rides a bike to work, has an apartment full of vintage action figures, and can barely talk to women-which is crucial to the film's appeal, as it wouldn't work if you couldn't buy into the idea that its main character really is such a misfit he could reach age 40 without getting any.  His friends, who make it their mission to find Andy a woman, are actually well-developed characters who bring something to the table as well, especially Paul Rudd as Dave, the stereotypical pathetic guy who can't get over the woman who dumped him years ago.  Romany Malco and Seth Rogen as the womanizing black guy Jay and the goofy, pot-smoking slacker Cal, respectively, are sort of stock characters, but they work well and deliver more than their share of memorable lines (the scene where Dave and Cal exchange reasons why they know the other's gay is practically worth the rental price alone).Anyway, the movie just largely follows Andy around as he tries to navigate the contemporary singles scene and find true love while making up for his four decades of awkwardness and ineptitude.  Much of the movie's humor comes from the fact that it is pretty difficult for a nice, sincere guy like Andy to find love (and sex) in such an oversexed and cynical dating environment.  Some of the set pieces here are brutally funny--we get to see Andy's level of discomfort in his attempts to pick up drunk women at a sketchy club and a trip to a speed-dating session, and Carell's knack for physical comedy is demonstrated in some bumbling attempts at sex and the legitimately painful chest-waxing scene.  About halfway through, the 40-year-old Virgin actually diverges into two movies, as the comedy is interspersed with some dramatic scenes involving Andy's growing relationship with a woman who works across the street from him.  The dramatic stuff isn't all that great, but hey, the movie needs some sort of resolution, and it never sells out all the way into painful rom-com territory like Wedding Crashers does.Alright, enough rambling.  If you like comedies, especially of the adult variety, you can do a lot worse than this one.  With Hollywood's product becoming increasingly watered-down, pretty much any halfway funny comedy can be anointed a classic, which the 40-year-old Virgin certainly isn't.  But if you make it through the excessively long running time, you'll be rewarded with some laugh-out-loud moments and a decent story.  3.5 stars overall.",3,"Well, this will be a short one...",1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,3950,"['Hmmm', 'what', 'say', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Well', 'how', 'certainly', 'not', 'Pantheon', 'great', 'comedies', 'such', 'names', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Rushmore', 'significantly', 'better', 'such', 'recent', 'efforts', 'say', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'American', 'Pie', 'movie', 'anything', 'sort', 'silly', 'aimless', 'mold', 'Anchorman', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'se', 'movie', 'basically', 'bunch', 'comedic', 'set', 'pieces', 'held', 'together', 'thread', 'mild-mannered', 'guy', 'named', 'Andy', 'trying', 'score', 'first', 'time', 'age', '40', 'sort', 'pastiche', 'styles', 'are', 'elements', 'slapstick', 'physical', 'comedy', 'sex', 'comedy', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'movie', 'work', 'same', 'wit', 'depth', 'characterized', 'outrageously', 'underappreciated', 'TV', 'show', 'Undeclared.The', 'unrated', 'version', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'type', 'movie', ""'re"", 'rewarded', 'sitting', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'are', 'few', 'dead', 'spots', 'especially', 'later', 'going', 'when', 'movie', 'moving', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Anchorman', 'should', 'know', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'skilled', 'comedian', 'title', 'role', 'Andy', 'quintessential', 'awkward', 'guy', 'who', 'so', 'innocently', 'clueless', 'actually', 'bit', 'creepy', 'point', 'one', 'co-workers', 'thinks', 'might', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'Andy', 'really', 'sort', 'guy', 'would', 'look', 'think', 'virgin-he', 'bike', 'work', 'apartment', 'full', 'vintage', 'action', 'figures', 'can', 'barely', 'talk', 'women-which', 'crucial', 'film', 'appeal', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'idea', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'such', 'misfit', 'could', 'reach', 'age', '40', 'getting', 'friends', 'who', 'make', 'mission', 'find', 'Andy', 'woman', 'are', 'actually', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'who', 'bring', 'something', 'table', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Dave', 'stereotypical', 'pathetic', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'woman', 'who', 'dumped', 'years', 'ago', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'womanizing', 'black', 'guy', 'Jay', 'goofy', 'pot-smoking', 'slacker', 'Cal', 'respectively', 'are', 'sort', 'stock', 'characters', 'work', 'well', 'deliver', 'more', 'share', 'memorable', 'lines', 'scene', 'where', 'Dave', 'Cal', 'exchange', 'reasons', 'why', 'know', 'other', 'gay', 'practically', 'worth', 'rental', 'price', 'alone', '.Anyway', 'movie', 'just', 'largely', 'Andy', 'navigate', 'contemporary', 'singles', 'scene', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'making', 'up', 'four', 'decades', 'awkwardness', 'ineptitude', 'Much', 'movie', 'humor', 'fact', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'nice', 'sincere', 'guy', 'Andy', 'find', 'love', 'sex', 'such', 'oversexed', 'cynical', 'dating', 'environment', 'set', 'pieces', 'here', 'are', 'brutally', 'funny', 'get', 'see', 'Andy', 'level', 'discomfort', 'attempts', 'pick', 'up', 'drunk', 'women', 'sketchy', 'club', 'trip', 'speed-dating', 'session', 'Carell', 'knack', 'physical', 'comedy', 'demonstrated', 'bumbling', 'attempts', 'sex', 'legitimately', 'painful', 'chest-waxing', 'scene', 'halfway', '40-year-old', 'Virgin', 'actually', 'two', 'movies', 'comedy', 'interspersed', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Andy', 'growing', 'relationship', 'woman', 'who', 'street', 'dramatic', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'great', 'hey', 'movie', 'sort', 'resolution', 'never', 'out', 'way', 'painful', 'rom-com', 'territory', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'does.Alright', 'enough', 'rambling', 'like', 'comedies', 'especially', 'adult', 'variety', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'watered-down', 'pretty', 'much', 'halfway', 'funny', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'anointed', 'classic', '40-year-old', 'Virgin', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'make', 'excessively', 'long', 'running', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'decent', 'story', '3.5', 'stars', 'overall']",N/A
636972,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B00005JNZU,William,"[0, 1]","I was initially very sceptical about seeing this film, but so glad I did.  It made me laugh so much during a number of scenes, which is always a good thing!  It was an engaging storyline about a 40 year old man who gets found out at work for being a big V.  His work buddies help to end all that, and along the way you get treated to some brilliant scenes.  The best one being the waxing scene, it will make you laugh so loud!  For anyone who has had a wax before, you will understand the humour in it.  I also loved the scene when his female boss tries to come onto him in the workplace - extremely funny.Only complaint is the film is perhaps 15 minutes too long, but this is only minor.  Overall, a must see!  It is truly funny.",4,Many wonderful moments,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,730,"['was', 'initially', 'very', 'sceptical', 'seeing', 'film', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'number', 'scenes', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'engaging', 'storyline', '40', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'out', 'work', 'being', 'big', 'V.', 'work', 'buddies', 'help', 'end', 'way', 'get', 'treated', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'best', 'one', 'being', 'waxing', 'scene', 'will', 'make', 'so', 'loud', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'wax', 'will', 'understand', 'humour', 'also', 'loved', 'scene', 'when', 'female', 'boss', 'tries', 'come', 'workplace', 'extremely', 'funny.Only', 'complaint', 'film', 'perhaps', '15', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'only', 'minor', 'Overall', 'must', 'see', 'truly', 'funny']",N/A

I saw it shortly after the superior ""Wedding Crashers,"" however, and so I was a bit disappointed.As the film's title strongly implies, the film is about a 40 year old sales clerk who is still a virgin.  When his co-workers find out, they try to get him laid.  He finally meets the woman of his dreams but they decide to wait until twenty dates before they have sex.  The movie kind of drags on, however, and most viewers will wish that they had decided to do it after only ten dates.The film is still an above average comedy that is worth watching.",3,Not as Good as Wedding Crashers,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,610,"['film', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'out', 'loud', 'saw', 'shortly', 'superior', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'however', 'so', 'was', 'bit', 'film', 'title', 'strongly', 'film', '40', 'year', 'old', 'sales', 'clerk', 'who', 'still', 'virgin', 'When', 'co-workers', 'find', 'out', 'try', 'get', 'laid', 'finally', 'woman', 'dreams', 'decide', 'wait', 'twenty', 'dates', 'have', 'sex', 'movie', 'kind', 'drags', 'however', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'wish', 'had', 'decided', 'do', 'only', 'dates.The', 'film', 'still', 'above', 'average', 'comedy', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
