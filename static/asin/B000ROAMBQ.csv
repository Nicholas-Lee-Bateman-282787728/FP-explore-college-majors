E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I found myself really getting into this movie as it went along.I haven't seen the first Animal, but the movie was about a father who goes to jail, and fights people (fights for his LIFE, in fact) because a dishonest ""religious"" man forces him to.  I never could tell if the guy was seriously religious or just pretending to be.  This guys performance, while exaggerated a bit, was pretty entertaining.The movie centers around the fathers kids, and well, I won't spoil anything, but the storyline progresses into some pretty interesting directions that I honestly didn't see coming until about halfway through.  His kids play a big part that involves a pretty crazy story.I can honestly say this is a pretty good movie that starts out a little slow and predictable, but develops into a more interesting storyline slowly and carefully.",5,quality storytelling,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,833,"['found', 'really', 'getting', 'movie', 'went', 'along.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'Animal', 'movie', 'was', 'father', 'who', 'jail', 'fights', 'people', 'fights', 'LIFE', 'fact', 'dishonest', 'religious', 'man', 'never', 'could', 'tell', 'guy', 'was', 'seriously', 'religious', 'just', 'pretending', 'be', 'guys', 'performance', 'exaggerated', 'bit', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'fathers', 'kids', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'directions', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'halfway', 'kids', 'play', 'big', 'part', 'pretty', 'crazy', 'story.I', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'out', 'little', 'slow', 'predictable', 'more', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'slowly', 'carefully']",Animal 2

1083508,A17HQQGIT3PDWJ,B000ROAMBQ,G.M. Vans,"[0, 0]","In my opinion this film was hard core.  Ving Rhames portrayed his usual tough ghetto guy character.  Personally,I stay away from his kind.  And, the film clearly displays why you should stay away from him and his ideologies.  Living in the inner city most of my life, I've encountered his character many times.  So, I can relate to the issues protrayed in the film.  Additionally, since I've never been to jail, the movie , supposedly, outlines the daily nature of the prison experience, caustic adversaries, and how to deal with them and the potential outcomes from this situation.  And with a film titled ""The Animal 2"", did I get what I expected?  Yes, I got education about prison life in triplicate because the acting was so real and believable.",3,Why you shouldn't go to jail,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,750,"['opinion', 'film', 'was', 'hard', 'core', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'portrayed', 'usual', 'tough', 'ghetto', 'guy', 'character', 'Personally', 'stay', 'away', 'kind', 'film', 'clearly', 'why', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'ideologies', 'Living', 'inner', 'city', 'most', 'life', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'character', 'many', 'times', 'So', 'can', 'relate', 'issues', 'protrayed', 'film', 'Additionally', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'jail', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'daily', 'nature', 'prison', 'experience', 'caustic', 'adversaries', 'how', 'deal', 'potential', 'outcomes', 'situation', 'film', 'titled', 'Animal', '2', 'did', 'get', 'what', 'expected', 'Yes', 'got', 'education', 'prison', 'life', 'triplicate', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'believable']",Animal 2
