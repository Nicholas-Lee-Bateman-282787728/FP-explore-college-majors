1113281,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000X418UY,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 1]","This poetic movie full of unforgettable images follows an immigrant family from the harsh barren hills of Sicily to Ellis Island in the early 20th century.The movie is divided into three sections: the first in Sicily depicts the tough life of these peasants who climb mountains barefoot and rely on sorcery for their medical treatment. We meet Salvatore, a  widowed father of two sons including one who is mute, and his aged mother. They make the difficult decision to leave for a land where they imagine money literally grows on trees.The second section takes place on the ocean liner bringing them across the Atlantic. Salvatore meets a mysterious traveler, Luce, played by the enigmatic Charlotte Gainsborough. We're not sure who see is or where she comes from -- she speaks English as well as Italian -- but she needs a husband in order to enter the United States.The third section is on Ellis Island itself where prospective immigrants are subject to humiliating medical and intelligence tests to see if they are worthy to enter the New World.Each section is full of poetic cinematography. Not all the images work. One recurring image of characters swimming in a river made of milk and grabbing on to giant-sized carrots left me a bit mystified. Some plot elements also remain unexplained. We never learn who Luce is and how she reached Sicily in order to embark on the ship. But overall, this movie is a feast for the eyes and for the imagination.",4,Poetic and full of unforgettable images,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,1453,"['poetic', 'movie', 'full', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'immigrant', 'family', 'harsh', 'barren', 'hills', 'Sicily', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'early', '20th', 'century.The', 'movie', 'divided', 'three', 'sections', 'first', 'Sicily', 'tough', 'life', 'peasants', 'who', 'climb', 'mountains', 'barefoot', 'rely', 'sorcery', 'medical', 'treatment', 'meet', 'Salvatore', 'widowed', 'father', 'two', 'sons', 'including', 'one', 'who', 'mute', 'aged', 'mother', 'make', 'difficult', 'decision', 'leave', 'land', 'where', 'imagine', 'money', 'literally', 'trees.The', 'second', 'section', 'place', 'ocean', 'liner', 'bringing', 'Atlantic', 'Salvatore', 'mysterious', 'traveler', 'Luce', 'played', 'enigmatic', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsborough', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'see', 'where', 'English', 'as', 'well', 'Italian', 'husband', 'order', 'enter', 'United', 'States.The', 'third', 'section', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'where', 'prospective', 'immigrants', 'are', 'subject', 'humiliating', 'medical', 'intelligence', 'tests', 'see', 'are', 'worthy', 'enter', 'New', 'World.Each', 'section', 'full', 'poetic', 'cinematography', 'Not', 'images', 'work', 'One', 'recurring', 'image', 'characters', 'swimming', 'river', 'made', 'milk', 'grabbing', 'giant-sized', 'carrots', 'left', 'bit', 'mystified', 'plot', 'elements', 'also', 'remain', 'unexplained', 'never', 'learn', 'who', 'Luce', 'how', 'reached', 'Sicily', 'order', 'embark', 'ship', 'overall', 'movie', 'feast', 'eyes', 'imagination']",N/A

1113285,AZ5AG6TTRL6Q4,B000X418UY,Bruce Frier,"[11, 12]","Although this movie is brutally realistic on one level in describing the poverty of the Sicilian family and the travails they suffer in emigrating to America, on another it is quietly but dazzlingly surrealistic.  This is achieved by keeping the camera closely focused on the Mancusos and their immediate surroundings, and by a storytelling that is often lyrically slow in its movement.Three scenes stand out as representative of the style: First, when the Mancuso family gets into their cart and they are seen very gradually disappearing behind the stone wall of their village, as their fellow villagers look on; at the last instant a mule bucks across the screen.  Second, at the port, when the dense crowd of emigrants on the boat blend seamlessly into the crowd of those seeing them off, in a shot from above; then gradually the boat separates from the dock and a gulf opens between them.  Third, when they are in Ellis Island and three Italians climb up on the frame of a huge window in order to see, and tell everyone about, the skyscrapers of Manhattan.  In each of these scenes we do not see the wider context.  We are, instead, held within the narrow image, which is both symbolic and strange.In this type of film making, a huge amount depends on the acting, which is superb.  Particularly worthy of note is the apparently mute son Pietro  (played by Filippo Pucillo), whose face often registers the true indignation or bafflement of this family as they are subjected to the confusion of new experience.  There is no sense of final hope; the film ends with them still inside Ellis Island, after they have made a crucial decision.  But there is, particularly in the dream sequences, a wonderful sense of aspiration.  The movie is neither tragic or comic, but it is deeply and richly human.",5,Realism?,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,1797,"['movie', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'one', 'level', 'describing', 'poverty', 'Sicilian', 'family', 'travails', 'suffer', 'emigrating', 'America', 'quietly', 'dazzlingly', 'surrealistic', 'achieved', 'keeping', 'camera', 'closely', 'focused', 'Mancusos', 'immediate', 'surroundings', 'storytelling', 'often', 'lyrically', 'slow', 'movement.Three', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'representative', 'style', 'First', 'when', 'Mancuso', 'family', 'cart', 'are', 'seen', 'very', 'gradually', 'disappearing', 'stone', 'wall', 'village', 'fellow', 'villagers', 'look', 'last', 'instant', 'mule', 'screen', 'Second', 'port', 'when', 'dense', 'crowd', 'emigrants', 'boat', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'crowd', 'seeing', 'off', 'shot', 'then', 'gradually', 'boat', 'dock', 'gulf', 'Third', 'when', 'are', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'three', 'Italians', 'climb', 'up', 'frame', 'huge', 'window', 'order', 'see', 'tell', 'everyone', 'skyscrapers', 'Manhattan', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'wider', 'context', 'are', 'instead', 'held', 'narrow', 'image', 'symbolic', 'strange.In', 'type', 'film', 'making', 'huge', 'amount', 'acting', 'superb', 'Particularly', 'worthy', 'note', 'apparently', 'mute', 'son', 'Pietro', 'played', 'Filippo', 'Pucillo', 'face', 'often', 'true', 'indignation', 'bafflement', 'family', 'are', 'subjected', 'confusion', 'new', 'experience', 'sense', 'final', 'hope', 'film', 'still', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'have', 'made', 'crucial', 'decision', 'particularly', 'dream', 'sequences', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'aspiration', 'movie', 'tragic', 'comic', 'deeply', 'richly', 'human']",N/A

Nobody even speaks for the first seven or eight minutes of the film.  This movie relies heavily on its cinematography, which is breath-taking and beautifully executed.  The story telling is markedly Italian with humorous superstitions that draw the viewer in, like the coins falling from the sky like rain, and the river of milk.The acting is quite good with Vincenzo Amato as the patriarch Salvatore, his sons are played by Filippo Pucillo as Peitro and Francesco Casisa as Angelo.  Of course, I can't forget Aurora Quattrocchi as the fiesty grandmother Fortunata.  (Fun fact:  Amato, Pucillo, and Casisa all star in the earlier film Respiro in which they play the father and sons respectively)The soundtrack on this film is phenomenal and is currently in my cart.

1113288,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000X418UY,Grady Harp,"[38, 41]","THE GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is for this viewer the finest film of the year to date. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. More importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a much needed reflective mirror for us to view the history of immigration of 'foreigners' into America at a time when the very mention of the word 'borders' is a political fuse. Writer/director Emanuele Crialese has given us not only a deeply moving story, he has also provided a touchstone for viewers to re-visit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of the Native Americans, we all entered America as 'foreigners' at some point in our histories, and it is humbling to view this film with that fact in mind.The film opens in turn of the century Sicily as poverty stricken widower Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climb a rocky hill to present their tokens to the cross to ask for a sign as to whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or go to America, the land of dreams. Mancuso's deaf mute son Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with images of America (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables larger than people, rivers of milk in California, etc), and Salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to America. After convincing his reluctant mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats, and rabbits) and the man with the boat arranges their trip, giving the family shoes, appropriate clothing, and instructions to board an ocean liner as third class passengers. As the Mancuso family prepares to board they are asked for a photograph, and as they pose behind a painted set, an Englishwoman Lucy/Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) walks into the photo as though she were part of this peasant family. Lucy cannot board the boat for America without male escort.The voyage begins and Luce in her gentle way identifies with the Mancuso family, finally solidifying her safe passage by proposing to Salvatore to marry her 'for convenience, not for love' when they arrive in America. Through a violent storm and living conditions that are appallingly poor, the multitude of third class passengers survive, bond, and eventually arrive at Ellis Island, believing their dream of America has been fulfilled. But everyone must pass harsh physical tests, de-lousing, and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter America: the officials let them know that America does not want genetically inferior people entering the new world! Each woman must be selected by a man to marry on Ellis Island before she is allowed admission. The manner in which the Mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the tale.Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment immigrants face (or at least faced at the turn of the century on Ellis Island), and if we do we have elected to submerge that information. THE GOLDEN DOOR presents the case for immigrants' struggles in a manner that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. But all political issues aside, THE GOLDEN DOOR is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty, exquisite photography, deeply felt performances by a huge cast, and a very sensitively written and directed story. The use of cinematic fantasy moments (characters swimming in a river of milk, coins falling over half buried bodies, cartoon-like vegetables, etc) only enhances the message of dreams of those whose lives in other countries fell short of the miracles expected in America. Antonio Castrignano's musical score is fascinatingly creative, using folk songs, contemporary music, and old tunes from this country. This is a film that deserves wide distribution, a movie that is a must see for everyone. Highly recommended.

1113291,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000X418UY,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[2, 3]","Golden Doorprovides a glimpse into what it was like to be an immigrant to the New World.  In certain ways, this movie is not designed for casual viewing or for those looking for entertainment value alone.  Rather, this movie captures the harsh realities immigrants faced in that period and serves as an education for those who may not be aware of the great obstacles that many European immigrants had to overcome in order to come to the New World.  On the other hand, this film provides a subtle character development.  There is also tremendous expertise displayed in the amazing sets, impressive wardrobes and beautiful cinematography.  Along with an impressive score, those elements add a sense of realism and a beauty to the film that will be appreciated by those who respect the work needed to recreate such a story.  So if you don't mind a slow and nuanced period drama, this movie is well worth your time.Every aspect of the immigrant experience is portrayed: the homelands they are leaving, the trials of their long overseas journey and their experiences at Ellis Island.  There are also some dream sequences that highlight the hopes and wishes that the immigrants held for their arrival in the New World.  Each portion of the film is compelling in its own way, but the section on Ellis Island is the most poignant in my opinion.An incredible  cast provides depth and atmosphere.  There are so many characters, we really get a sense for how vast an undertaking such a journey must have been.  It truly feels like we are experiencing the journey along with thousands of other people from all walks of life.One theme of the movie that I particularly appreciated was the emphasis on relationships between men and women making their way across the Atlantic.  Women have very little rights without a male escort.  Men are placed in categories based upon their perceived worth, usually based on race and wealth.Our central characters are a Sicilian widower named Salvatore (Vincenzo Amato) travelling with his mother and two sons in tow, and a young English woman Luce, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg.  While Luce has other suitors and the prevailing prejudices of the day to justify keeping her distance from Salvatore, she still takes the time to get to know him and his family.  They are drawn to each other despite their vastly different backgrounds.  Watching their relationship unfold is touching.  It's also a good indication of just how unlikely it was for two such people to even meet during that time period.The movie displays how some immigrants were viewed as less desirable than others.  The standards and requirements that some are held to is noticeably harsher.  The board also subjects them to tests that seem to be based more on prejudice and misinformation than on fairness.  This aspect of the film, while bleak, provides a critical insight into the immigrant experience for many during that time.Perhaps unbeknownst to many on the journey, entry in the New World was often conditional upon many factors including marital status.  This led to forced marriages and marriages of convenience for many whose only other option was to be repatriated to their home countries.  For those who had already spent most or all of their wealth making the journey, that option was unacceptable.Yet the resolution of the film produces a better outcome for our main characters than for some others.  Not all were allowed to enter.  And the extended quarantine they were subjected to also had consequences that were even more dire than being denied entry.This is a wonderful film that should appeal to those who love history and period dramas.

Seeing that this was a movie about early 20th century European immigrants AND that it starred Charlotte Gainsbourg, that was plenty enough for me to pick it up. Glad I did.""Golden Door"" (2006 release from Italy; 120 min.) is ""presented by Martin Scorsese"", which you see this type of endorsement once in a while, but I was (pleasantly) surprised that before the movie starts there is a 2-3 min. clip with Scorsese telling us, the viewers, why this movie is important to him and hence his decision to ""endorse"" it. As to the movie itself, it proceeds at snail's pace (and I mean that as a compliment) and can roughly be divided into three parts: (1) the Italian family getting ready to make the move to America; (2) the boat trip across the Atlantic; and (3) their arrival and processing at Ellis Island. It's not until about 45 min. into the movie that Charlotte Gainsbourg, one of my all-time favorite actresses, appears, as an English woman looking for a husband-to-ve so that she can enter the US.I really don't want to delve into further details of the movie's plot as that would simply ruin it for you. But let me make a couple of general observations: this movie is beautifully shot, with an eye for visual details and surprises throughout. At time (during the dream sequences), the movie feels like magic realism. As a legal immigrant myself into this country, this movie spoke directly to me. The events taking place in ""Golden Door"" are only about 70 years before I entered this country, yet so much has changed in that time span. I've had the privilege of visiting Ellis Island, and that for me is truly sacred ground. Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this.

1113296,A2FV4Y4I7BBL6I,B000X418UY,R. Crane,"[0, 7]","""Golden Door"" is a movie about a Sicilian family's immigration to America, ""the land where milk flows in rivers"".  It is a look at the hardships they face in leaving their homes and traveling here, and the difficulties of actually being accepted by the authorities: illness and mental retardation, for example, could result in deportation.The movie is introduced by famed director Martin Scorsese.  Of Sicilian descent, Scorsese praises this film for being true to what he remembers of his childhood and his family.  It may have been personally moving to him, but this was a boring film.  It is so slow moving as to be almost painful to watch.  It is filmed in dark and dreary colors (probably to emphasize the hopelessness of the immigrants' lives) but it resulted in a movie that is exceedingly depressing.There are so many instances where the storyline makes no sense.  For example, one main character is an attractive English redhead who captures every man's attention aboard the ship.  All kinds of rumors circulate about her: Is she a princess? Is she a prostitute? Was she married to a nobleman?  Is there some lover waiting for her?  But her background and story are never revealed.  All we know is she needs to marry someone, anyone, to get into the country.  Even the immigration official tells her that she will be questioned why she, an Englishwoman, is traveling with Italian immigrants--highly unusual.  But no questioning ever is shown.It is not a spoiler to tell you that at the end of the movie when the main character is faced with a harsh decision the movie suddenly ends.

1113297,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000X418UY,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[4, 5]","As the granddaughter of Polish immigrants (my grandmother immigrated to the US from Zamosc, Poland in 1917 when she was four years old), I grew up hearing stories about Ellis Island from my grandmother (who had quite a large collection of books on Ellis Island), and also read a number of novels and watched documentaries (Ellis Island) on the immigrant experience.However, reading first-hand accounts of the events and seeing them brought to life on the big screen made quite a difference. Golden Door (released as New World in Italy) follows the Sicilian Mancuso family, headed by persnickety grandmother Fortunata, her son Salvatore, and his sons Angelo and Pietro. Salvatore is barely able to scratch a living from the rocky, unforgiving landscape (shown to perfection in haunting aerial shots), and after many false starts, begins to make arrangements to go to America. Fortunata has no desire to join them, and Pietro, a deaf-mute, identifies more closely with her. The first third of the film involves Salvatore's selling of his goods to finance the voyage, and the preparations that have to be made. Along the way, Salvatore meets the beautiful, mysterious Englishwoman Lucy, who is traveling in Sicily by herself and attempts to travel with the Mancusos.The middle of the film chronicles the ocean steamship crossing, with its cramped, segregated male/female quarters, and a rough storm at sea. To be honest, the scenes of the living arrangements seemed too quiet from what I've read; when Lucy gets up at night, there's nary a peep (no young children on this ship, apparently). Also slightly disappointing was the fact that when they finally arrived in New York, there was no (standard) shot of the immigrants glimpsing the Statue of Liberty for the first time.The final third deals with the Mancuso's fairly typical experience at Ellis Island, and this is where the film shines. Director Emanuele Crialese really did his homework on the battery of physical and psychological tests performed on prospective immigrants in order to determine their ""fitness"" for life in the United States, and it's slightly shocking by modern standards to see the humiliation that some were subjected to. The American Ellis Island staff in the film come off as cold and unconcerned, particularly with the heartbreaking situation of some of the ""mail-order brides"" forced into marriage after a dangerous ocean crossing. However, Crialese did include (brief) glimpses at other immigrants, including Eastern European Jewish, Middle Eastern, and other European countries. Small touches of wonder at their new situation are alternately funny and touching, such as immigrants scaling the frosted glass windows to look across the harbor, where they contemplate living in a skyscraper, or Salvatore's result of a block puzzle.Crialese chose to shoot the film in Buenos Aires and personally chose all 700 extras, most of whom are descendants of Italian immigrants to Argentina. The scenery is effective, and the film was digitally colored to leach out bright hues, resulting in an appropriately washed-out, aged look (although not as garish as Tim Burton's use of digital coloring in Sweeny Todd). TheGolden Doorsoundtrack includes folk songs, a hint of tango, and symphonic interludes, and works well with the visuals. An in-depth making-of features interviews in French and Italian (funny to hear the Italian lead Vincenzo Amato interviewing in French rather than his native Italian, but his French is quite good).My only dislike of the film was the inserted ""dream sequences"" that featured hallucinations of giant vegetables and rivers of milk (the end sequence was downright creepy in an Andy Warhol kind of way). As Salvatore didn't strike me as lighthearted, these ""hallucinations"" come across as forced rather than a natural extension of his personality and took away from some of the gravity of the immigrant experience presented here.Overall, this is a lushly realized look at the immigrant experience, including the many sacrifices and dangers along the way that are sometimes overlooked due to the romanticized view of the immigrant experience. Crialese has created a timeless tribute to the sacrifice of our grandparents who gave up everything (not just family living in the Old World, but often their language, culture, and customs) at the chance for a better life in America.",4,An eye-opening look at the Ellis Island experience,1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,4371,"['granddaughter', 'Polish', 'immigrants', 'grandmother', 'immigrated', 'US', 'Zamosc', 'Poland', '1917', 'when', 'was', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'grew', 'up', 'hearing', 'stories', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'grandmother', 'who', 'had', 'quite', 'large', 'collection', 'books', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'also', 'read', 'number', 'novels', 'watched', 'documentaries', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'immigrant', 'experience.However', 'reading', 'first-hand', 'accounts', 'events', 'seeing', 'brought', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'made', 'quite', 'difference', 'Golden', 'Door', 'released', 'New', 'World', 'Italy', 'Sicilian', 'Mancuso', 'family', 'headed', 'persnickety', 'grandmother', 'Fortunata', 'son', 'Salvatore', 'sons', 'Angelo', 'Pietro', 'Salvatore', 'barely', 'able', 'scratch', 'living', 'rocky', 'unforgiving', 'landscape', 'shown', 'perfection', 'haunting', 'aerial', 'shots', 'many', 'false', 'starts', 'make', 'arrangements', 'go', 'America', 'Fortunata', 'desire', 'join', 'Pietro', 'deaf-mute', 'identifies', 'more', 'closely', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'Salvatore', 'selling', 'goods', 'finance', 'voyage', 'preparations', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'way', 'Salvatore', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'Englishwoman', 'Lucy', 'who', 'traveling', 'Sicily', 'attempts', 'travel', 'Mancusos.The', 'middle', 'film', 'ocean', 'steamship', 'crossing', 'cramped', 'segregated', 'male/female', 'quarters', 'rough', 'storm', 'sea', 'be', 'honest', 'scenes', 'living', 'arrangements', 'seemed', 'too', 'quiet', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'when', 'Lucy', 'up', 'night', 'nary', 'peep', 'young', 'children', 'ship', 'apparently', 'Also', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'was', 'fact', 'when', 'finally', 'arrived', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'standard', 'shot', 'immigrants', 'glimpsing', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'first', 'time.The', 'final', 'third', 'deals', 'Mancuso', 'fairly', 'typical', 'experience', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'where', 'film', 'shines', 'Director', 'Emanuele', 'Crialese', 'really', 'did', 'homework', 'battery', 'physical', 'psychological', 'tests', 'performed', 'prospective', 'immigrants', 'order', 'determine', 'fitness', 'life', 'United', 'States', 'slightly', 'shocking', 'modern', 'standards', 'see', 'humiliation', 'were', 'subjected', 'American', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'staff', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'cold', 'unconcerned', 'particularly', 'heartbreaking', 'situation', 'mail-order', 'brides', 'forced', 'marriage', 'dangerous', 'ocean', 'crossing', 'However', 'Crialese', 'did', 'include', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'other', 'immigrants', 'including', 'Eastern', 'European', 'Jewish', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'other', 'European', 'countries', 'Small', 'touches', 'wonder', 'new', 'situation', 'are', 'alternately', 'funny', 'touching', 'such', 'immigrants', 'scaling', 'frosted', 'glass', 'windows', 'look', 'harbor', 'where', 'contemplate', 'living', 'skyscraper', 'Salvatore', 'result', 'block', 'puzzle.Crialese', 'chose', 'shoot', 'film', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'personally', 'chose', '700', 'extras', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'descendants', 'Italian', 'immigrants', 'Argentina', 'scenery', 'effective', 'film', 'was', 'digitally', 'colored', 'leach', 'out', 'bright', 'hues', 'resulting', 'appropriately', 'washed-out', 'aged', 'look', 'not', 'as', 'garish', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'use', 'digital', 'coloring', 'Sweeny', 'Todd', 'TheGolden', 'Doorsoundtrack', 'folk', 'songs', 'hint', 'tango', 'symphonic', 'interludes', 'well', 'visuals', 'in-depth', 'making-of', 'features', 'interviews', 'French', 'Italian', 'funny', 'hear', 'Italian', 'lead', 'Vincenzo', 'Amato', 'interviewing', 'French', 'rather', 'native', 'Italian', 'French', 'quite', 'good', 'only', 'dislike', 'film', 'was', 'inserted', 'dream', 'sequences', 'featured', 'hallucinations', 'giant', 'vegetables', 'rivers', 'milk', 'end', 'sequence', 'was', 'downright', 'creepy', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'kind', 'way', 'Salvatore', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'lighthearted', 'hallucinations', 'come', 'forced', 'rather', 'natural', 'extension', 'personality', 'took', 'away', 'gravity', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'presented', 'here.Overall', 'lushly', 'realized', 'look', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'including', 'many', 'sacrifices', 'dangers', 'way', 'are', 'sometimes', 'overlooked', 'due', 'romanticized', 'view', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'Crialese', 'created', 'timeless', 'tribute', 'sacrifice', 'grandparents', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'everything', 'not', 'just', 'family', 'living', 'Old', 'World', 'often', 'language', 'culture', 'customs', 'chance', 'better', 'life', 'America']",N/A
1113298,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B000X418UY,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","Set at the beginning of the 20th century we travel to impoverished Sicily where we meet Salvatore (Vincezo Amato - `Respiro') and his family. They are struggling to survive and like a lot of fellow Europeans he is considering going to the New World, which flows with milk and honey and money grows on trees. He has an elderly mother who doubles as some sort of healer, and two sons in the shape of Angelo and Pietro.After a sign from on high they decide to go for it and head off to the ferry to get a third class ticket to America. This is where red headed siren Lucy Reed (Charlotte Gainsbourg) comes into the picture. She needs a man to get her through the tests at Ellis Island and she decides he is the one. Along the way there is a lot of social history and some well observed attention to detail.Director Emanuele Crialese (`Respiro' and Terrafirma') also uses a lot of surrealist imagery to exemplify how the propaganda of the US was such a pull factor that really most of the &eacute;migr&eacute;s could never have made a logical decision. There are oversized vegetables, coins in trees and falling from the skies and a river of milk.This is a beautifully shot film with Sicily having an austere beauty and the filth and dirt being omnipresent until they reach New York. The immigration system is also done extremely well and the plight of these people is palpable. I really enjoyed this film but it won't be to everybody's taste as there is little action, no bedroom diversions and no overly dramatic occasions. Yet still it tells a story that thousands will have had to go through and there are no monuments to their sufferings or struggle so I think this film has a special place in the world of cinema.

Not only does he direct some of America's finest films, he ""discovers"" films like ""Golden Door"" and brings them to America.  I did not have the pleasure of watching this film in a movie theater (oh, how I wish I had: the cinematography is that stunning) but I did watch it on DVD, and its greatness still shines through.  A mere plot description does not do this film justice.  It is, at its most basic level, a story of coming to America from Italy-- certainly a worthy focus of a movie.  But it goes so much beyond this theme: love story, homage to some of the great Italian films, a film about the mystery of human connection, even an adventure film.  The cinematography, performances, the  screenplay and stunning score work hand in hand to create an unforgetable cinematic experience.  I tend to rate only books and movies that I truly love, so please forgive the superlatives -- but they are sincere.",5,Takes It Place Beside the Great Italian Films,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,941,"['Three', 'cheers', 'Martin', 'Sorcesse', 'Not', 'only', 'direct', 'America', 'finest', 'films', 'discovers', 'films', 'Golden', 'Door', 'America', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'film', 'movie', 'theater', 'oh', 'how', 'wish', 'had', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'did', 'watch', 'DVD', 'greatness', 'still', 'A', 'mere', 'plot', 'description', 'not', 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'most', 'basic', 'level', 'story', 'coming', 'America', 'Italy', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'focus', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'theme', 'love', 'story', 'homage', 'great', 'Italian', 'films', 'film', 'mystery', 'human', 'connection', 'even', 'adventure', 'film', 'cinematography', 'performances', 'screenplay', 'stunning', 'score', 'work', 'hand', 'hand', 'create', 'unforgetable', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'tend', 'rate', 'only', 'books', 'movies', 'truly', 'love', 'so', 'please', 'forgive', 'superlatives', 'are', 'sincere']",N/A

The film is especially good in the Ellis Island sequence where one witnesses the conditions that immigrants faced when arriving at the government inspection station.  Parts of this movie would be excellent to use with students but not the medical inspection portion since it depicts frontal nudity.,5,Golden Door,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,413,"['title', 'movie', 'refers', 'portion', 'Emma', 'Lazarus', 'poem', 'inscribed', 'base', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'film', 'especially', 'good', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'sequence', 'where', 'one', 'conditions', 'immigrants', 'faced', 'when', 'arriving', 'government', 'inspection', 'station', 'Parts', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'use', 'students', 'not', 'medical', 'inspection', 'portion', 'frontal', 'nudity']",N/A
