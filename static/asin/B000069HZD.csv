Johnny works as a columnist for an obscure New York daily paper, uses a typewriter, keeps a candlestick telephone on his desk, calls a cab a ""dime-box"" and is otherwise loaded with slang and newsroom patter of that bygone era.  He doesn't understand why a colleague would prefer a salad to a beefsteak at lunch, or why his friends and the women he chases seem burdened by world-weariness and cynicism, when he himself is bright as a button, and always gay...meaning ebullient.  Johnny gets involved in a kidnap caper, chasing a bad guy whose stooges can barely understand him.  MAN OF THE CENTURY is a ""cult movie"" of the best and brightest kind, a cat's meow of a fun flick that I've seen twice and look forward to again.  It's a pity new copies are getting scarce and expensive, but perhaps it can be downloaded.  Definitely worth seeking out.",5,"""Gay?!

It's a lot of fun, and in contrast to formula movies where someone stuck in the past can't make it in the present, he does just fine in our age, thank you, thanks in part to the real world picking up some of the fantasy from the early cinema.  The acting, and action, is hilarious.  Much that's in here has been done before, in the original, but it all comes together here in a very unique way.

This is the tale of an archetypal ""Roaring-Twenties"" characternamed ""Johnny Twennies,"" one of those fast-talking, go-getter newspapermen who were usually found in B-movies of the early talkieera. Only trouble is, for some bizarre reason, he's living in theNew York of the 1990s. His anachronistic style of speaking (mostof his dialogue consists of snappy '20s slang), romance, and reporting methods tend to rile everyone around him, but somehow Johnny, caught up in his world of Rudolph Friml music, battered old Underwood typewriters and jazz babies, remains blissfully  unaware of that.There's some kind of plot involving hisefforts to expose the local crime boss in his newspaper column, butthis film really isn;t too concerned with plot; it's all about style--it's an affectionate homage to the look and feel of old movies.Maybe it's a little too affectionate. At times, it goes overboardon silliness, the acting becomes almost cartoonish, and the wholeatmosphere of the film becomes a self-indulgent exercise in preciousness. If you allow yourself to accept the goofy spirit inwhich it was apparently made, you're apt to find this an enjoyableviewing experience. Maybe the point of this particular low-budgetindependent effort is to poke fun at the many indie films that tendto take themselves much too seriously.Whatever point the filmmakers were attempting to make, you won'tfind out much from the DVD. The ""extras"" include an audio commentary and an alleged featurette, but don't be fooled. Thefeaturette contains no interviews with the filmmakers, no information about the motivations for the film, etc. The commentaryturns out to be a lame joke which comes to an end a few minutes into the film and serves no purpose.

For viewers who might want to visit that decade's colloquial language, there are good introductory lists of slang expressions of the 1920s on the net.However, some short stories of the 1920s would pull you into that world better than any list of phrases.  The giant of that decade's slang was the short story writer Damon Runyon.  Ring Lardner was another writer of short stories and sports columns that were admired for their slang.

707688,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B000069HZD,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[2, 7]","This very odd film was worth the viewing-but it became tedious quickly. Director Adam Abraham, a USC grad (1995)-had a unique and creative vision that could have sustained a 20-minute one reel short. It was critically well received-but must have had a very limited theatrical release. Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars, and felt,"" it was an odd delight.""It had time-warp gentleness about it. The writing, done by Abraham and star Gibson Frazier-a pal of his-seemed to be accurate and well researched, in terms of the 20's phraseology. There definitely was a Ben Hecht-Preston Sturges 1928-1932 feel to the piece-hectic clipped dialogue and snappy patter. Ebert called it,"" THE FRONT PAGE meets modern vulgarity.""Gibson Fraser was quite good as Johnny Twenties-the newspaper reporter, who still pounded an old typewriter, wore a bowler, smoked, was nave, and cracked wise. I liked the opening credits presented like a 20's silent film-complete with scratches and poor contrast on the print. But for me the snappy 20's patter-like Johnny saying,"" Say-you keep riding me like a streetcar-you're gonna have to pay the fare.""-constantly juxtaposed to silly gangster street slang, complete with the ""F"" word-became less creative with every incidence.The whole film seemed to be just a Johnny One-Note concept that continued way beyond its expiration date. The spirited 20's dance numbers, and the consistent staying in character for Gibson as Johnny-were truly admirable achievements. But the repeated gag ad infinitum-of Johnny Twenties existing in modern times-yet never touched by reality-wore itself out quickly. The sense of ""style"" seemed to override any semblance of viable or workable plot. The ""book""-as they call the story in musicals-was feeble at best. With a little more imagination-the plot might have included some explication for the stuck in time scenario. Even Johnny's overbearing mother was stuck in time. For her it was somewhere between the Victorian era and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. She too-was oblivious to the modern world-sending a horse and carriage to pick up Johnny. Was this some attempt to explain Johnny's strange behavior?The idea that modern gangsters would pursue and try and hurt Johnny, his girlfriend and his associates, had about as much allure as the plot for several THREE STOOGES shorts. The late Frank Gorshin hammed it up as a fake Italian Count who passed himself off as an Opera teacher and producer-setting up tryouts that segued into lurid sicko black leather S&M; sexual scenario.",3,Stuck In Time--And It's Not Jake,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2519,"['very', 'odd', 'film', 'was', 'viewing-but', 'became', 'tedious', 'quickly', 'Director', 'Adam', 'Abraham', 'USC', 'grad', '1995', '-had', 'unique', 'creative', 'vision', 'could', 'have', 'sustained', '20-minute', 'one', 'reel', 'short', 'was', 'critically', 'well', 'received-but', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'felt', 'was', 'odd', 'delight', 'had', 'time-warp', 'gentleness', 'writing', 'done', 'Abraham', 'star', 'Gibson', 'Frazier-a', 'pal', 'his-seemed', 'be', 'accurate', 'well', 'researched', 'terms', '20', 'phraseology', 'definitely', 'was', 'Ben', 'Hecht-Preston', 'Sturges', '1928-1932', 'feel', 'piece-hectic', 'clipped', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'patter', 'Ebert', 'called', 'THE', 'FRONT', 'PAGE', 'modern', 'vulgarity', 'Gibson', 'Fraser', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Johnny', 'Twenties-the', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'still', 'pounded', 'old', 'typewriter', 'wore', 'bowler', 'smoked', 'was', 'nave', 'cracked', 'wise', 'liked', 'opening', 'credits', 'presented', '20', 'silent', 'film-complete', 'scratches', 'poor', 'contrast', 'print', 'snappy', '20', 'patter-like', 'Johnny', 'saying', 'Say-you', 'keep', 'riding', 'streetcar-you', ""'re"", 'gon', 'na', 'have', 'pay', 'fare', '-constantly', 'juxtaposed', 'silly', 'gangster', 'street', 'slang', 'complete', 'F', 'word-became', 'less', 'creative', 'incidence.The', 'whole', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'Johnny', 'One-Note', 'concept', 'continued', 'way', 'expiration', 'date', 'spirited', '20', 'dance', 'numbers', 'consistent', 'staying', 'character', 'Gibson', 'Johnny-were', 'truly', 'admirable', 'achievements', 'repeated', 'gag', 'ad', 'infinitum-of', 'Johnny', 'Twenties', 'existing', 'modern', 'times-yet', 'never', 'touched', 'reality-wore', 'out', 'quickly', 'sense', 'style', 'seemed', 'override', 'semblance', 'viable', 'workable', 'plot', 'book', 'call', 'story', 'musicals-was', 'feeble', 'best', 'little', 'more', 'imagination-the', 'plot', 'might', 'have', 'included', 'explication', 'stuck', 'time', 'scenario', 'Even', 'Johnny', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'was', 'stuck', 'time', 'was', 'somewhere', 'Victorian', 'era', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'AMBERSONS', 'too-was', 'oblivious', 'modern', 'world-sending', 'horse', 'carriage', 'pick', 'up', 'Johnny', 'Was', 'attempt', 'explain', 'Johnny', 'strange', 'behavior', 'idea', 'modern', 'gangsters', 'would', 'pursue', 'try', 'hurt', 'Johnny', 'girlfriend', 'associates', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'allure', 'plot', 'several', 'THREE', 'STOOGES', 'shorts', 'late', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'hammed', 'up', 'fake', 'Italian', 'Count', 'who', 'passed', 'off', 'Opera', 'teacher', 'producer-setting', 'up', 'segued', 'lurid', 'sicko', 'black', 'leather', 'S', 'M', 'sexual', 'scenario']",N/A
707689,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000069HZD,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 4]","Man of the Century is an odd little independent film revolving around Johnny Twennies (Gibson Frazier), a man existing out of his time. His mannerisms and sensibilities are that of someone living in the Roaring Twenties. His colloquial speech pattern and cocky, independent persona recall James Cagney and Cary Grant, from Hollywood's golden age. He wears old-fashioned attire (hat included), sends out telegrams, types on an old-school typewriter, dances the Charleston, and is particular to tunes by Irving Berlin and the Gershwins.Johnny Twennies resides in modern day New York yet is breezily oblivious to our contemporary times. His girlfriend Samantha (Susan Egan) is carrying a torch for him, yet finds herself constantly frustrated because Johnny insists on being a gentleman and refuses to put out. His new photographer partner seems unable to get across to Johnny that he's gay. Trouble comes calling when his newspaper editor gives Johnny one last chance to come up with a scoop before he gives him the bum's rush. Add to that the fact that two hoodlums are hassling him because of a newspaper column...well, it's all enough to give one the heebie-jeebies.This short, weird film is short on depth, but long on style. I thought it was a blast. It was really fun watching the clash between 1990s NewYork residents (and their modern sensibilities) and the determined obliviousness of the anachronistic Johnny Twennies. The glossy black and white cinematography is apropos to the storyline and looks great. Gibson Frazier, who co-wrote the story, has the 1920s personality down pat, complete with the snappy, rapid-fire patter and jaunty, can-do attitude. Susan Egan has a perfectly pitched performance as Johnny's baffled girlfriend. Sadly, Frank Gorshin (Batman's Riddler) doesn't fare as well as the elderly, decrepit, kinky Roman Navarro, who preys on musical ingenues.I do agree with several reviewers who suggested this would've improved even more with a shorter running time. It would've been absolute gold as a 20 minute short.

If you love the 20's (as I do), this will be right up your alley. See if you can catch all of the pop culture references to that period.

It's an oddity of a film, one that isn't clear about its own rules.  Some other characters also live in the 1920s, and both &quot;moderns&quot; and &quot;Twenties&quot; people easily intermingle with each other.  Yet mainly it's just Johnny who's perceived as odd by &quot;moderns,&quot; not the record store owner or &quot;speak-easy&quot; folk.The acting, dialogue, cinematography, and art direction are all sublime.It's only drawback is that it's a &quot;one-joke&quot; film (or perhaps a &quot;one-concept&quot; film).  It's short, about an hour and 15 minutes not including credits, yet I was getting bored halfway into the film.  It's a pleasure to watch, but once you &quot;get it,&quot; that's all there is.  The characters have a shallow cartoonish feel.  Interesting to watch and listen to, but there's no emotional depth to them.  None of them grow or change or learn.  But that's okay, as this is not a film with a serious intent -- the plot itself is tossed aside at the film's end, as everyone joins in a 1930s song &amp; dance number.This film is aimed at the mind, rather than the heart or the guts.
