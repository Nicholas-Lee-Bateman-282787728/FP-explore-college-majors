She makes an appointment with MD Dr. Young (Harry Reems). She discovers through the medical of nature that part of her anatomy seems to have been placed in a differing physical location.The bulk of the movie is Linda taking advantage of her new found discovery.I suppose there will always be generations of the curious. But this should be a mild film compared to just the nightly news broadcast.This film may make an interesting coffee table conversation.

926891,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000AE4QEC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[112, 134]","If we are talking about historical impact then no film comes close to ""Deep Throat"" in the history of XXX-rated movies, but do not suppose for a minute that we are talking about something that could be described as a ""good"" film, even in this particular genre.  Written and directed by Gerard Damiano, the film runs a minute or two more than an hour, and starred Linda Lovelace (aka Linda Susan Boreman).  Deep Throat also was the name given to the source in the ""Washington Post"" investigation of the Watergate scandal, who was revealed last year to be Mark Felt, a former FBI associate director.  This revelation by Bob Woodward begs the question as to which of the two Deep Throats, Linda Lovelace or Mark Felt, has had the biggest impact on American culture?In the 1970s when pornographic films made an effort to become more legitimate (the period known as ""porn chic""), there were three films that were supposed to be different from the rest: ""Behind the Green Door,"" ""The Devil in Miss Jones,"" and ""Deep Throat.""  The first, which received lots of publicity because it starred Marilyn Chambers, who had been on the cover of boxes of Ivory Snow, was basically about the three sexual fantasies that men think (or wish) that women have, while the second would actually be described as an attempt to make a traditional movie with explicit love scenes.  But ""Deep Throat"" stood out, not because of the particular ability of Linda Lovelace from which it takes its title, but because it was much more tongue in cheek, so to speak.The plot of ""Deep Throat"" is relatively simple.  Linda Lovelace, essentially playing herself, goes to Dr. Young (Harry Reems) complaining that her sex life is unsatisfying.  After a few questions and a cursory physical examination, the doctor discovers that Linda has a key anatomical difference and what should be one place is actually in her throat.  Therefore, with a logic that anyone can easily grasp, Linda has to attempt to achieve gratification in a slightly different way.  Dr. Young insists that they confirm his hypothesis, after which she becomes a ""therapist"" in his office and the rest of the film consists of standard sex scenes, except for those in which Lovelace is featured (i.e., the film is not all about her).  However, the idea of the titular technique proves to be more enticing than actually witnessing the technique, which tends to engender more feelings of disbelief than of envy.Although it was banned in 23 states, ""Deep Throat"" made a lot of money.  The film cost about $22,500 and made $20 million in rentals in the U.S. alone, most of which went to the Colombo mob that financed the production.  The two major contributions of ""Deep Throat"" to the porn industry were that it proved that such films could be enormously profitable (remember, this is $20 million in 1970s dollars), and that is established comedy as the way to go.  Of course, by ""comedy"" we are talking corny dialogue, silly songs, and fireworks going off during the key moments.  ""Deep Throat"" was only the third full-length porn film released in the U.S. (""Behind the Green Door"" was the fourth).""Deep Throat"" was the subject of obscenity trials around the country, with Reems being convicted in Memphis of violating federal obscenity charges dealing with transporting material across state lines (Reems became a cause c?l?bre and his conviction was overturned).  Boreman claimed in her first two biographies that making the film was a liberating experience, but in subsequent biographies she charged that she had not consented to the sexual acts and was coerced by her abusive husband into making the film (testifying before the Meese Commission in 1986 she declared: """"Virtually every time someone watches that movie, they're watching me being raped"").  That could be reason enough to skip this one, especially since it is possible to believe without seeing.  A sequel was made in 1974, ""Deep Throat, Part II,"" which was shot so that both hard core and R-rated versions could be released,The porn industry is a multi-billion dollar industry today and it was this film that opened the door more than any other.  Watergate brought down a president, made the Fourth Estate the de facto fourth branch of government (equally corrupt), and made cynicism for politics a cultural norm.  I want to say that the legacy of Watergate is more important, but when I see the cutting-edge television programs on HBO like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Deadwood,"" I can trace back to both ""Deep Throat"" and Watergate (naked people and absolute corruption).  I might as well flip a coin because whichever side I take the Devil's Advocate in me is going to be happy to argue the other side.  Anyway, last year, in addition to Mark Felt being revealed as ""Deep Throat, the documentary ""Inside Deep Throat"" was released as well.  All things considered, you would be better served by watching that documentary than bothering to check out the original (to be clear, you get to see what it is you need to see without having to sit through the whole thing).",4,Who will history remember more:  Linda Lovelace or Mark Felt?,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,5049,"['are', 'talking', 'historical', 'impact', 'then', 'film', 'close',
