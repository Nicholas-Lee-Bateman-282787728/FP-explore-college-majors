The woman returns to her husband, they share a drink before leaving for a party among the super-rich. She meets a man. ""What are we going to do?"" David Shaw is an art painter. Steven Taylor works on Wall Street. Emily works at the UN. Will there be a financial disaster for the firm? Emily meets David again. David gets a phone call from Steven. They talk about a mutual interest. Steven knows about David's past at Berkeley. He offers him a deal to resolve the conflict. Steven has a trick to get finger prints. Emily confides in a friend about her life. A lost item? What will David do? [Note their use of remote telephones.] ""You sound funny."" Steven explains what must be done to make it look like a surprise. Is it a perfect plan?Steven surprises Emily with an invitation to lunch. She suspects something's wrong. Wils she confess to Steven? Steven can't cancel his poker game. ""Its too late."" Steven handles a magnetic key holder. Then he walks out. Emily takes her bath. Steven plays cards, then calls home at 10PM. ""Hello."" There is an attack, but Emily defends herself. Steven trashes his surplus cell phone and returns home. ""What happened?"" The attacker is well done. Steven does what he has to do. The police arrive. ""Nothing unusual?"" The detective has questions. Steven sees the face of the dead robber. Does Emily have enemies? ""Very good, Bobby."" Emily answers questions. They leave for the country. The telephone tells who was called. There is a meeting on the Staten Island ferry. There is no ""Plan B"" now. Emily has her plan.Back in the ""real world"" Steven's long positions are being liquidated. ""Why didn't anybody tell me?"" [Is Steven getting out of touch?] Back at home Emily discovers she has the wrong key. [The simple mistake!] Emily visits her friend and tells about her marital status. Steven made illegal financial transactions but his banks are covering for him. He faces financial ruin. Emily goes to the police. Steven has an alibi. The dead man had no keys, not even to his apartment. [Is that strange?] Steven is in conference when an unknown caller reaches him. David has a pocket recorder. He meets Steven. ""Four hours."" Emily visits a strange place to find a lock for that key. Steven visits his bank to fill a shoebox. He shows the pictures to Emily. Was she in love with him? ""I'm so sorry."" ""Can you forgive me?"" Steven explains the deal.Steven goes to the loft, then to Washington Square. ""Take care!"" Next to Pennsylvania Station to catch a train. There is shocking surprise! What was sent to Emily? Steven returns home to get the envelope. He has Emily's ring. Emily still can't find her key. Steven finds it. Emily has a surprise for Steven. There is another confrontation. Emily has a final surprise for Steven. She knows ""gun control"" (use both hands). The police make another visit to the Taylor home. ""What else could she do?""This is based on the play ""Dial M for Murder"", which was adapted into a 1950s movie by Alfred Hitchcock. I think this is a better version, if only being set in modern times. Would a wealthy heiress marry without a prenuptial agreement? [What do they teach in finishing school?] The death of a spouse always makes the surviving spouse (or boyfriends) the prime suspect. They need a good alibi (like being out of town).

I would have expected him to check the key under the pipe immediately after he realised that Emily had someone else's key ?2.when Douglas returned home after killing the lover, he put the bag with the blackmail tape inside somewhere in his office.

In this film, the stars are Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen.The best part of this film may not be the story, or the acting, both of which keep you glued to the screen, but the stylish photography and sets..  They look magnificent, mainly the apartment of the the two leads. I was constantly awed by how good this film looks. The DVD transfer is beautiful.I also prefer the sequel because it has more twists and is complex enough to thoroughly enjoy every 3-4 years. Also fun are the short speeches each character gives on occasion, usually when they smugly think they have the upper hand. Each time that happens, their antagonist winds up going one up on them! There isn't much action in here but when it occurs, it's very intense.The only thing that annoys me - unfortunately it's a big one - is the ending in which I don't believe justice totally prevailed. I can't wrote much more without spoiling it for those who have not seen this. One of the parties comes out looking like a 'an innocent victim"" and that person was hardly a ""saint.""

109220,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0790741563,Dennis Littrell,"[18, 23]","This quasi-remake of Hitchcock&#8217;s Dial M for Murder (1954)--which was filmed in 3D, by the way--is a rather good thriller in its own right, intelligently done throughout except for a few scenes near the end when Director Andrew Davis and screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly lose their judgment and opt for a silly knock down, drag out fight.Michael Douglas plays a quintessential evil kind of guy, evil, ruthless, greedy, two-faced, crafted to excite our loathing (&#8220;How&#8217;s THIS for wet work?&#8221;).  He is excellent.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays his very rich wife who has incredibly poor taste in men.  Seems that Gwyneth has become attracted to roles that get her involved with the wrong kind of guys, witness The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) and Sliding Doors (1998).  But she is also very good, as is Viggo Mortensen who plays the murderous con artist.The plot is tight and filled with nice twists.  The sets are opulent and dripping with money, and neither the direction nor the camera work calls undue attention to itself.  But what really makes this fly is the material on which it is based, the devilishly clever play by Frederick Knott, who reigned on Broadway many years ago.  I&#8217;ll bet that Paltrow was persuaded in part to take the role because the same part was played in the Hitchcock movie by the legendary Grace Kelly.  Also, another Frederick Knott play made into a movie was Wait Until Dark (1967) starring the also legendary Audrey Hepburn.  I suspect Paltrow could hardly resist joining such illustrious company, especially when the plot here allows her to take matters into her own hands, as it were, and give to her two guys considerably more than she gets.Bottom line: you will be diverted.",4,Featuring a two-fisted Gwyneth Paltrow,1011830400,"01 24, 2002",2002,1725,"['quasi-remake', 'Hitchcock', '8217', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', '1954', 'was', 'filmed', '3D', 'way', 'rather', 'good', 'thriller', 'own', 'right', 'intelligently', 'done', 'few', 'scenes', 'end', 'when', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Davis', 'screenwriter', 'Patrick', 'Smith', 'Kelly', 'lose', 'judgment', 'opt', 'silly', 'knock', 'down', 'drag', 'out', 'fight.Michael', 'Douglas', 'quintessential', 'evil', 'kind', 'guy', 'evil', 'ruthless', 'greedy', 'two-faced', 'crafted', 'excite', 'loathing', '8220', 'How', '8217', 's', 'THIS', 'wet', 'work', '8221', 'excellent', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'very', 'rich', 'wife', 'who', 'incredibly', 'poor', 'taste', 'men', 'Gwyneth', 'become', 'attracted', 'roles', 'get', 'involved', 'wrong', 'kind', 'guys', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', '1999', 'Sliding', 'Doors', '1998', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'who', 'murderous', 'con', 'artist.The', 'plot', 'tight', 'filled', 'nice', 'twists', 'sets', 'are', 'opulent', 'dripping', 'money', 'direction', 'camera', 'work', 'undue', 'attention', 'what', 'really', 'fly', 'material', 'based', 'devilishly', 'clever', 'play', 'Frederick', 'Knott', 'who', 'reigned', 'Broadway', 'many', 'years', 'ago', '8217', 'bet', 'Paltrow', 'was', 'persuaded', 'part', 'take', 'role', 'same', 'part', 'was', 'played', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'legendary', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Also', 'Frederick', 'Knott', 'play', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'Wait', 'Dark', '1967', 'starring', 'also', 'legendary', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'suspect', 'Paltrow', 'could', 'hardly', 'resist', 'joining', 'such', 'illustrious', 'company', 'especially', 'when', 'plot', 'here', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'were', 'give', 'two', 'guys', 'considerably', 'more', 'gets.Bottom', 'line', 'will', 'be', 'diverted']",N/A

So he decides to hire someone to do away with her - and chooses her lover as the assassin. The screenwriter adds a few interesting twists and turns to the original story, and some fascinating psychological layers as well. But the overall tone is one of emotional distance, and lack of empathy for any of the characters may put some viewers off. Still, this is well worth checking out. Paltrow is less anemic than usual as Douglas's wife, and Viggo Mortensen is the most alluring reprobate in a film in some time.

109226,AJDWUMO2AIUB,0790741563,D. Miller,"[1, 2]","Sometimes it's really worth it to compare remakes of old movies to the originals.  Other times it's not because the two can be like night and day.  A Perfect Murder (Gwyneth Paltrow and Michael Douglas) and the original Alfred Hichcock version Dial M for Murder are a good example.To start with, A Perfect Murder has a totally different run of things in the plot twists and ways of figuring out things.  The part of the adulterous wife (played by Gwyneth Paltrow and Grace Kelly, respectively) turns tables almost completely.  Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) is no fool.  And she also plays the part of a woman who actually killed someone in the process of protecting herself masterfully.  She's very shaken after the encounter and distraught and hysterical.  Afterwards, she pretty much reaches her own conclusions...looking into things, beginning to suspect that her husband is up to something...and then she confronts him with what she's found.  Steven (Michael Douglas) pretty much has everything figured out.  He knows what to do in every case...he seems to have every base covered.  And he's much more devious and evil than the husband in Dial M.Dial M for Murder is also very Hitchcockian in its filming and format.  Anyone familiar with Hitchcock knows that he tended to like somewhat odd camera shots.  Shots from the floor or for the ceiling as if you were spying on the scene.  Also, a great many of his movies were first plays so they were written with one major scene and Hitchcock would leave it that way, filming some of the movie in other places, but the majority of it would be in that one main room or apartment or what-have-you.  Other good Hitchcock examples of this would include Rope and Lifeboat.Something that I thought made a good twist in A Perfect Murder was the role of the lover.  Instead of hiring through blackmail an old college acquaintance, Emily's killer-for-hire is driven by money and a criminal background and is, in fact, the man she's cheating on her husband with (named David).  Michael Douglas does his homework and decides that this guy is by far the best candidate for this job as he is greedy and he can blackmail him since he knows of David's criminal background and could turn him in for a variety of crimes.  David pulls a trick on him though and sends someone else to do the dirty work so that he is free to walk away when it doesn't go right and then use his knowledge to blackmail in turn and still get the money he lusted.  Another good twist.A Perfect Murder is definitely more gruesome than Dial M, but I think it's effective more than gory.  It's no battle from Braveheart so don't concern yourself too much.  There's no dismemberment or anything like that...there's a lot of blood, but not much else.Both Paltrow and Douglas give superb life to their roles and I enjoyed the film enough to see it again.Oh, and as a footnote, you might just want to consider watching Dial M for Murder (for anyone who hasn't already).  It's a wonderfully suspenseful, distinctly Hichcock film and everyone needs to get in one of those every so often.There are some clear similarities that carry over from one story to the other, but overall I would say that it's a night and day difference.  However each are well-done in their own right and both are more than worth seeing.",4,"Same, but different",1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,3305,"['Sometimes', 'really', 'worth', 'compare', 'remakes', 'old', 'movies', 'originals', 'Other', 'times', 'not', 'two', 'can', 'be', 'night', 'day', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'original', 'Alfred', 'Hichcock', 'version', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'are', 'good', 'example.To', 'start', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'totally', 'different', 'run', 'things', 'plot', 'twists', 'ways', 'figuring', 'out', 'things', 'part', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'played', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'respectively', 'tables', 'almost', 'completely', 'Emily', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'fool', 'also', 'part', 'woman', 'who', 'actually', 'killed', 'someone', 'process', 'protecting', 'masterfully', 'very', 'shaken', 'encounter', 'distraught', 'hysterical', 'Afterwards', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'conclusions', 'looking', 'things', 'beginning', 'suspect', 'husband', 'something', 'then', 'what', 'found', 'Steven', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'case', 'have', 'base', 'covered', 'much', 'more', 'devious', 'evil', 'husband', 'Dial', 'M.Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'also', 'very', 'Hitchcockian', 'filming', 'format', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'Hitchcock', 'tended', 'like', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'camera', 'shots', 'Shots', 'floor', 'ceiling', 'were', 'spying', 'scene', 'Also', 'great', 'many', 'movies', 'were', 'first', 'plays', 'so', 'were', 'written', 'one', 'major', 'scene', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'leave', 'way', 'filming', 'movie', 'other', 'places', 'majority', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'main', 'room', 'apartment', 'what-have-you', 'Other', 'good', 'Hitchcock', 'examples', 'would', 'include', 'Rope', 'Lifeboat.Something', 'thought', 'made', 'good', 'twist', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'was', 'role', 'lover', 'Instead', 'hiring', 'blackmail', 'old', 'college', 'acquaintance', 'Emily', 'killer-for-hire', 'driven', 'money', 'criminal', 'background', 'fact', 'man', 'cheating', 'husband', 'named', 'David', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'homework', 'guy', 'far', 'best', 'candidate', 'job', 'greedy', 'can', 'blackmail', 'David', 'criminal', 'background', 'could', 'turn', 'variety', 'crimes', 'David', 'trick', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'so', 'free', 'walk', 'away', 'when', ""n't"", 'go', 'right', 'then', 'use', 'knowledge', 'blackmail', 'turn', 'still', 'get', 'money', 'lusted', 'good', 'twist.A', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'definitely', 'more', 'gruesome', 'Dial', 'M', 'think', 'effective', 'more', 'gory', 'battle', 'Braveheart', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'concern', 'too', 'much', 'dismemberment', 'anything', 'lot', 'blood', 'not', 'much', 'Paltrow', 'Douglas', 'give', 'superb', 'life', 'roles', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'enough', 'see', 'again.Oh', 'footnote', 'might', 'just', 'want', 'consider', 'watching', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'already', 'wonderfully', 'suspenseful', 'distinctly', 'Hichcock', 'film', 'everyone', 'needs', 'get', 'one', 'so', 'are', 'clear', 'similarities', 'carry', 'one', 'story', 'other', 'overall', 'would', 'say', 'night', 'day', 'difference', 'However', 'are', 'well-done', 'own', 'right', 'are', 'more', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","Stephen and Emily Taylor seem to have the perfect life of wealth, elegance and privilege -- until Stephen hires his wife's lover to murder her.If that sounds slightly familiar, that's because it's similar to the plot of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M For Murder,"" which ""A Perfect Murder"" is a loose rewritten adaptation of. Andrew Davis is no Alfred Hitchcock, but he does fill the polished movie with a sense of tense, unnerving fear, and he gets some amazing performances out of a strong quartet of actors.Wealthy New York socialite Emily Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow) is having a torrid fling with a handsome young artist, David (Viggo Mortensen). At the same time, her husband Stephen (Michael Douglas) is seeing his business investments collapse. Emily and David believe their affair is a secret, until Stephen contacts David and reveals that he know all about their affair, AND about David's secret past as a thief and conman.He offers David $500,000 to murder Emily and make it look like a random robbery, and arranges an elaborate ploy involving the house-key. It seems like the perfect murder. But not only does Emily manage to stab her attacker to death, but he isn't David. It seems like a random break-in, but Detective Karaman (David Suchet) seems to be suspicious -- and Emily begins to suspect that her husband arranged the murder attempt.Most of the plot is lifted (and then rewritten) from ""Dial M For Murder,"" so sadly I cannot credit Andrew Davis with the tightly-wound mystery plot, and the subsequent tangle of suspicions, blackmail and evidence that Stephen can't explain away. The strong point of ""A Perfect Murder"" is the acting, which is pretty brilliant all across the board.The most eye-catching performance is Michael Douglas'. Stephen is a charming, seemingly genial figure... until his mask slips, and we see the flinty, icy sociopath lurking inside his eyes. He starts to fray around the edges as his ""perfect"" plan starts falling apart, and he discovers the hard way that being rich and upper-crust won't make a criminal automatically fear you.Which brings me to a pre-megafame Viggo Mortensen, who showed his quality by holding his own opposite Douglas. David is as coldly calculating as Stephen, and clever enough to throw the wealthier man's plans in total disarray -- all in a hunky, smirking shell. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the most sympathetic of the three, and this is probably the most powerful performance I've seen from her -- although her character is also pretty cruel, since she only feels bad about cheating on her husband when she's found out.However, I'm not sure why Suchet is so peripheral -- in the scenes he's in, Karaman seems like he's going to be really important, as if he's going to be spearheading an investigation. But then he just sort of drifts out of the movie until Emily needs him. It's sad, because Suchet is absolutely amazing here.While I can't credit Davis with credit for the twisty plot, I can credit him with drawing some nice suspense from the actors' performances. Despite some very 1990s cinematography, he lightly wraps the story with some tripwire tension, often by focusing on Douglas' face as he sees everything crumble around him. And while there's not much violence, what little there is is wild and frenetic.""A Perfect Murder"" is a twisting, tense little mystery that rests on a great bunch of performances, although I'm not entire sure why David Suchet was shoved off to the side.

Directed by Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"", ""Collateral Damage"", ""Holes""), based on the ""Dial M for Murder"" script by Frederick Knott,  written by Patrick Smith Kelly (""Don't Say a Word""), and starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen, one just has to wonder how such talented people could churn out such a mess of a film.I had no empathy for any of the characters in this film.  I felt very detached from all the characters in this film and thus didn't really care what happened to any of them.  This eventually leads to boredom, as it did in my case.Boredom: another thing that plagues this film.  In a desperate attempt to make things more interesting, the writer throws in a bunch of twists and turns that failed to shock or interest me in the least.  Frankly, this film got downright tedious.  During some of the more ""suspenseful"" sequences, I often found myself checking my watch.  No good.The sole redeeming factor of this film is the trio of A-list actors we get to watch.  Michael Douglas is pitch-perfect as a scheming, greedy businessman.  The eternally elegant and ethereal Gwyneth Paltrow is mesmerizing to watch and brings a little bit of light into this otherwise dark film.  And then we have VIGGO (Mortensen, that is).

It was excellent. Good acting. Good writing. Good pace. It's a more modern update from the stage play and Alfred Hitchcock movie ""Dial M For Murder."" It's an interesting story. Everyone seems to want to murder Gwynith Paltrow, her husband, her lover and a hired killer for a variety of complex reasons, but when it's all over she's the last one standing. I developed no sympathy for any of these lead characters, I might add.The story is interesting, suspenseful and very well done. I wish more movies could be this well thought out and produced.In general, my impression is that this movie is exceptionally well done, but I have one major gripe, The sound is very poorly engineered. I watch the movie on a widescreen plasma TV and my  sound is via a 100-wat per channel stere system. Because I watch these things late at night I play the sound through a set of high-quality head phones. The background sounds in this movie (noises, music, etc) are much too loud and make the conversations of the movie difficult to hear and understand. There's just no need to have the music drown out the movie. I might add that if I just use the stereo system alone or if I use the TV alone, the results are the same. Perhaps it's just made for a surround-sound system and  doesn't fit my reproduction system too well, but I can't help that. The overwhelming amount of DVDs that I watch do not have this problem. As such, my feelings  are that this movie deserves a five-star rating base on the story, filming, acting, etc. I'm downgrading it to four stars because of my  difficulties with the sound. If you have a  way of getting around this, then it may be no problem.Gary Peterson",4,"Excellent Movie.

109250,A1NNS31GRVDJNB,0790741563,"Joseph Leydon ""(a.k.a. Joe Leydon)""","[30, 32]","For the record, &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; is a remake of &quot;Dial M for Murder,&quot; Alfred Hitchcock's maliciously clever but hopelessly stagebound adaptation of the popular play by Frederick Knott. But it is great deal more fun to view the new movie as a sequel to &quot;Wall Street,&quot; with Michael Douglas once again in top form as a ruthlessly manipulative financial whiz. Imagine Gordon Gekko just a few years past his prime as a high-flying corporate raider, with a trophy wife who's just beginning to tarnish, and you'll get the idea. The big difference is, this time, instead of extolling the virtues of greed, Douglas' character is willing to consider the benefits of an even deadlier sin.In &quot;A Perfect Murder,&quot; which Andrew Davis (&quot;The Fugitive&quot;) has directed from a screenplay by Patrick Smith Kelly, Douglas is Steven Taylor, a Manhattan-based millionaire industrialist who has over-extended himself  while playing the international money markets. Worse, he knows that his most prized possession -- Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow), his radiantly beautiful and conspicuously younger wife -- is drifting out of his jealously tight grip.Right from the start, the audience knows that Emily is having an affair with David (Viggo Mortensen), a broodingly hunky artist who invites her to his fashionably seedy downtown loft for afternoon delights. Trouble is, Steven also knows about the affair. This, too, is made clear very early in the story, as Steven and Emily share a drink in their luxurious apartment before attending a gallery opening. Despite all their polite chit-chat, there is an edge of  menace in the air. When Steven abruptly suggests that she wear another dress to the occasion, his words have the unmistakable sound of a command.  Not surprisingly, Emily does as she's told.At the gallery opening, Steven is effortlessly gracious as his wife introduces him to David, whom she identifies as a casual acquaintance. Of course, he's much more than that -- much more, in fact, than even Emily realizes.After inviting himself to David's loft, Steven reverts to his natural state. He knows that David is an ex-convict who taught himself to paint in prison -- and, more important, has mastered the art of  seducing, then robbing, rich women.  Sounding very much like a hard-bargaining businessman, Steven wastes little time in making his pitch: He offers David $500,000 to kill Emily. For a few minutes, David rejects the offer. But the money -- coupled with the threat of exposure -- is too tempting to resist.It would be difficult to say more about what happens next without running the risk of spilling some beans. Even if you've already seen Hitchcock's 1954 original, or one of the many revivals of Knott's play, you are in for a few surprises. Davis and Kelly treat &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; more as a source of inspiration than a classic worthy of replication. They take the play's basic set-up -- the husband concocts a tricky murder scheme that hinges on the placement of a latchkey and the ringing of a telephone -- but go off  in a different, far more intriguing direction.Perhaps the most striking difference between Hitchcock's film and Davis' update is the casually amoral cynicism that informs &quot;A Perfect Murder.&quot; In the 1954 thriller, the wife's lover was a boyishly buoyant mystery writer, affably played by Robert Cummings, while the wife -- played by Hitchcock's favorite leading lady, Grace Kelly -- was a relatively innocent adulteress who generated sympathy while paying for her sins. Even the cuckolded husband, played by Ray Milland, came across as genial rogue who was motivated by love as much as money.Welcome to the 1990s: In &quot;A Perfect Murder,&quot; the lover is a con man with a gift for blackmail, the husband has lust in his heart for his wife's trust fund, and even the wife is a strong believer in enlightened self-interest. You won't feel excessive sympathy for any of these characters as they hatch their plots and counter-plots. In fact, you may think one of them gets off far too easily in the end.

I saw it, but don't remember a thing about it. So, this review is for this movie only and is not comparing it to anything. The movie stars Oscar winners Michael Douglas & Gwyneth Paltrow (Best Actor, Wall Street; Best Actress, Shakespeare in Love) anda Pre-Lord of the Rings Viggo Mortensen as three people caught up in a twisted love triangle. Douglas plays Steven Taylor, a powerful executive who's wife Emily (Paltrow) is having an affair with David Shaw (Mortensen),an artist who is not who he appears to be. When Steven finds out about the affair, he approaches David and offers him half a million dollars to kill Emily.David happily abliges. The plan is worked out, everything is worked out. It's a perfect murder...Sort of. But, midway through things go awry and everyone in the movie has a secret agenda planned for the other. Now, all the twists in the movie are good (although there are a few that you can clearly see coming); The performances are great, especially Douglas. The movie is very entertaining, but it loses it's stride mid-way through and picks up later which brings my grade for it down a bit. But, anyway; I do recommend it and it will keep you entertained.GRADE: B-",4,"The Film is So-So, Douglas Gives a Great Performance Though",1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,1305,"['Perfect', 'Murder', 'remake', 'play', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'called', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'saw', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'thing', 'So', 'review', 'movie', 'only', 'not', 'comparing', 'anything', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'anda', 'Pre-Lord', 'Rings', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'three', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'twisted', 'love', 'triangle', 'Douglas', 'Steven', 'Taylor', 'powerful', 'executive', 'who', 'wife', 'Emily', 'Paltrow', 'having', 'affair', 'David', 'Shaw', 'Mortensen', 'artist', 'who', 'not', 'who', 'be', 'When', 'Steven', 'out', 'affair', 'David', 'million', 'dollars', 'kill', 'Emily.David', 'happily', 'plan', 'worked', 'out', 'everything', 'worked', 'out', 'perfect', 'murder', 'Sort', 'midway', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'everyone', 'movie', 'secret', 'agenda', 'planned', 'other', 'Now', 'twists', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'coming', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Douglas', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'stride', 'mid-way', 'up', 'later', 'grade', 'down', 'bit', 'anyway', 'do', 'recommend', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A
109252,A2ENIQZX6VJYUM,0790741563,J. Robinson,"[3, 3]","This is a good movie and well worth the watch. Michael Douglas plays a familiar role similar to his early 1987 Wall Street Gordon Geiko role but now much more sinister, and Gwyneth Paltrow plays his younger and slightly gullible trophy wife who is searching for happiness.The movie tells how she is taken in by an artist, and how her husband Douglas reacts. His acting is good, but not up to the level of some of his earlier roles, which would be hard for him to match in every movie. Gwyneth is likeable and adds some zing.I watched the movie because of Douglas, but as the movie progresses the center of attention seems to shift from Michael towards Gwyneth, a more recent Oscar winner, because of her believable acting and her sympathetic role. So even with the less than a great new role for Douglas, the movie is entertaining. It is definitely worth a watch, especially for Douglas fans, which includes myself plus I am now a budding Paltrow fan.This is a minimalist movie, and although the credits (see the Amazon movie info above) lists many actors, there are really only four characters of note in the play, i.e.: the two stars both Oscar winners along with the artist and a police detective. It is the type of movie that lends itself to being just a short play since most of the action takes place in just two apartments. The movie is set in New York city, and the director manages to work in a few local attractions such as Penn Station, the Staten Island Ferry, some skyline, and some museums. But the New York scenes are just a bonus, like icing on a cake, and the movie really hangs on the stars and their interactions.

The promo also told me that it had a clever script and unexpected plot twists.  So what do I spend my time doing as I watch the movie?  Waiting to be caught off-guard by plot twists, and waiting to be impressed with a clever script.  Well, I waited in vain.  The better promo would have been; ""This is an ok movie that stands on its own as a tense thiller.""  Had they said this, it would deserve ... um ... 4 stars.This feeble remake presents nothing clever, nothing surprising and does not come close to the mastery of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.Sheesh, this movie might as well have put up a subtitle that said ""the Grace Kelly wannabe will grasp the meat-thermometer to 'unexpectedly' kill her attacker.""As for us being ""surprised"" that the attacker was not the playboy guy, I knew it wasn't the moment the almost-masked guy slipped into the parking garage and the cameraman hid his face from us.  duh!As for the clever script, Michael Douglas basically tells his wife that he's going to kill her.  Gee, is that tension?  No, it's just annoying to watch and wonder just how stupid this blond wife is supposed to be.As for the movie being clever?  Not when they claim that it's a remake of a Hitchcock masterpiece.  Also, the plotting husband gives an unconvincing reason as to why the playboy can't just go kill her in the bathroom.  The viewer feels like shouting ""it's because this is a remake of a film where the wife is on the phone when she is attacked!""  I feel like also quoting the fictional-fictional Jack Slater (in Arnold's Last Action Hero) saying his expected and corny line of ""big mistake.""A big reason why ""Dial M For Murder"" remains a masterpiece, is that Hitchcock limited himself to basically one set, with very few exceptions.  Even his cameo was masterfully slipped into that expensive ""flat"" (in the picture on the wall).  (He did the same self-challenge in Rear Window and Lifeboat.)

109261,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0790741563,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","This glossy, stylish, and elegant remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, ""Dial M for Murder"", forges its own identity, as it leaves behind the theatrical underpinnings of the original film. Screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly offers up an intelligent, well-written script with some surprising twist and turns. Beautifully directed by Andrew Davis (The Fugitive, Under Siege, The Package), the film delicately weaves its ingenious plot.Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas)  is a driven, wall street tycoon whose wife, Emily Bradford Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an heiress, fabulously wealthy in her own right. They live in a lavishly appointed apartment in Manhattan. The only fly in their ointment, or so it seems, is that Emily is having a love affair with a down and out artist, David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).It seems, however, that there is a dark side to the relationship between Steven and Emily, as Emily is decidedly unhappy with it. Moreover, unbeknownst to Emily, her artist boyfriend is not all that he appears to be nor is her husband, Steven, who is not as rich as he purports to be. Apparently,  a series of bad investments have left him with margin calls that are set to leave him on the brink of bankruptcy. What's a guy to do?Well, if you are like Steven Taylor, a ruthless, self-absorbed creep, you look to get your wife's money, at all costs. He knows about his wife's lover and will seek to use him, making David an offer he can't refuse. This decision sets in motion a cat and mouse game that leaves the viewer wondering, just who is the cat and who is the mouse? Who will live and who will die?This is a solid thriller that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. Excellent performances are given by all. Michael Douglas is excellent as  Steven Taylor, a cool and collected ruthless character who has sacrificed his very humanity to greed, power, and conspicuous consumption. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants. It is a role similar to that of Gordon Gekko, the character that Douglas played to critical acclaim in Oliver Stone's film, ""Wall Street"".It is Gwyneth Paltrow's performance, however, that is the most notable. She infuses the role of Emily with a surprising strength and vulnerability,  creating a sympathetic character.  This is no easy task, considering that her character, a gloriously wealthy, gorgeous woman who is two-timing and deceiving her husband. Considering her husband, however, it is understandable. She does, however, seem to be looking for love in all the wrong places, as her lover has his own issues.Viggo Mortensen gives an excellent performance as Emily's lover, David. It appears, however, that Emily may have picked a lover not all that different from her husband. Viggo Mortensen plays his part both hot and cold, as he is clearly conflicted by what Steven has asked him to do, despite the fact that it will give him what he originally set out to get. He manages, however, to turn the table on Steven, only to have Steven turn the table on him.Sarita Choudhury gives a warm performance as Emily's friend, Raquel Martinez. David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame effectively plays the part of the wily detective, Mohamed Karaman, who comes into the picture when Emily is almost murdered and is most sympathetic towards Emily.All in all, this is a wonderful film that those who enjoy thrillers and murder mysteries will enjoy having in their personal collection.

109263,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,0790741563,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[15, 18]","In many ways this is a remake of ""Dial M for Murder"", the classic Hitchcock thriller, but if you haven't seen Dial M yet, watch this one first. There are many differences in the storyline - enough to make each stand alone as its own separate movie.The movie really has only four characters - currency trader Stephen (Michael Douglas), his wealthy trophy-wife Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow), and the artistic lover David (Viggo Mortensen) - plus a few brief appearances by Mohamed (David Suchet). Interestingly, you would think with so few characters that each would come across as complex and well developed - but the focus here is on the intricate plot and the gorgeous sets. The actors are all of course brilliant, but they are playing characters that are very stereotypical.Douglas delights in his villain role and mentions this many times in the commentary - that it means he can go the theatrical and dramatic route. You can see in the beginning of the movie - he plays Stephen as a very cool, intelligent man who plots out everything he wants in life, and then gets it. You can understand how he seduced and wooed the naive Emily and got her to marry him without signing a prenup. Now he is going to take advantage of her affair to get rid of her, and get the money.Viggo plays the sleazy lover / artist who is actually a serial seducer, who has been in jail twice for taking advantage of rich women. He lives in a large loft cluttered with his artwork. Of interesting note is that Viggo actually painted all of his own artwork - and painted it right in that loft. He put a lot of work into becoming his character, and the Polish residents of that area of New York actually did think he was an artist. David did in fact deliberately seduce Emily for her money - but along the way he began to fall in love with her. It takes an apparent betrayal by Emily before he goes along with Stephen's scheme. It's very interesting - when you first see David, he is very well dressed, very handsome. But as the movie goes on, he degenerates more and more until by the end his hair is greasy, his look is furtive and he has gone back to being the con-man he was before he first met Emily. He becomes ""un-saved"" during the course of the movie.Gwyneth has a hard character here. If you compare this story with the original Dial M, in the original the female character was a door post. She sat there with no brain cells and no activity. We have a HUGE improvement with Emily - she works with the UN and is very savvy. But even so, it's a shame they made her such a stereotype. She is a beautiful, rich trophy wife. She was seduced and ""taken"" by Stephen who obviously cared little for what she was actually about. Stephen just wanted her cash and arm candy appeal. Being naive, she believed Stephen and didn't sign a pre-nup. Then she was seduced and ""taken"" by David, who again cared little for what she was. David just wanted the cash. I realize of course that some women are naive and that some men are out for conquest. But with the screenplay being so ""smart"" and well developed - and with the two male characters both being so intelligent and planning - it was a shame to have the girl just bumble through the situations going ""Jeez, I can't imagine he would HURT me ..."" like a 13 year old innocent. She lives in New York, she works for the UN. She shows her brilliance in her mastery of multiple languages and her understanding of complex financial situations. It would have been really nice to carry that over into an insight about relationships as well.I also feel sorry for David Suchet. He is a brilliant actor, but Mohamet gets hardly any lines or action. He only appears in a few scenes and he mostly gives Emily a prodding to move forward in her investigations.The sets are gorgeous, as are the backdrops of New York City. The locations are in fact right near where Gwyneth grew up. The cinematography has a very theatrical feeling to it. Sometimes things are just a little TOO obvious. It was perfectly clear what the murder weapon was going to be. But I suppose with the tiny details of the plot being so well done, sometimes they couldn't be sure that the entire audience ""got it"" and had to help out. There are many little things - like an open door - that you might not even catch until you watch the movie a second time. There are a number of 'background items' that are very well done - a comparison between David's raw, powerful art style and Stephen's staid, ""what is popular at the moment"" collection.SPOILER ALERT!!The movie for me was great until the ending scene. There are in fact 2 versions of the ending that you can see on the DVD - and the ending they used is at least far better than the alternative. In the alternative. Emily confronts Stephen with knowledge of the murder plot and simply shoots him in the chest. Mohamed realizes this is what happens but lets Emily get away with ""The Perfect Murder"" because he feels sorry for her. In the ending they used, it is only slightly more legal - Emily has a gun and antagonizes Stephen by telling him she is going to go tell the police and get him locked up for life. She goads him into attacking her, he does, and she then shoots him. Lawyers would tell you that as she had a gun, it was her responsibility to not provoke him - she should just have left and gone to the police without instigating his fury. Again, in the second version, Mohamed lets her get away with it.Both of the endings bothered me. Yes, Stephen was a criminal. So was David. Both were actively using Emily. She had the proof of these activities. Instead of reducing the great plot and intricacies of the entire movie into a shooting match, she should have shown her OWN brilliance and roped him into a public exposure of his failures and forced him to live with years of suffering in jail, with public humiliation. It's what his psyche would have hated the most. Instead she pushed his buttons, knowing he'd attack, knowing she'd have to shoot him. In the movie it might have been ""the perfect murder"" but in reality it reduced her to the level of those who had been using her all along. I didn't find that ending satisfying at all.",4,Well Written Screenplay - Great Actors,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,6169,"['many', 'ways', 'remake', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'classic', 'Hitchcock',

109266,A152C8GYY25HAH,0790741563,Matthew Horner,"[6, 7]","""A Perfect Murder"" opened in theaters at the start of summer 1998. It did brisk business before being mowed down by the season's high profile fare. Actually, it held its own rather well, which proves once again that the public knows more than experts think it does. This is happy paradox, because much of the public's correct choices are due to the fact that it doesn't know everything. Critics do.Many critics get religion, so to speak. Certain ""truths"" become holy to them. Since Alfred Hitchcock was 'The Master of Suspense', any movie that is a remake of one of his works is damned before the first foot of film is shot. These self-appointed guardians of cinema can become menacing in their anger and hostility. You'd think Hollywood executives were running around trying to knock off The Pope.""A Perfect Murder"" is based on the play ""Dial M for Murder"", which Hitchcock made into a film in the early 1950s, while under contract to Warner Brothers. I do not question his place in history, but not all of Hitchock's works carry equal weight. He did not like Frederick Knott's play. He reluctantly agreed to do the movie version in exchange for the studio's letting him do a pet project. As a result, they let him make the brilliant and successful ""Rear Window"", while he gave them the mediocre and successful ""Dial M for Murder"".""A Perfect Murder"" was based on a script the studio already owned. It happened to be the perfect vehicle for young Gwyneth Paltrow to play in opposite Michael Douglas. Director Andrew Davis had already proved his ability at rehashed suspense with Warner's film version of ""The Fugitive"".The movie suffers not in the least when compared to Hitch's version. If anything, it's a better picture. It obviously had a bigger budget. It's not nearly as mannered and static. The plot has been extensively updated, except for one key scene involving a telephone. Its failings are due to the same elements which bothered Hitch. The play is close to being a potboiler. Still, in the new version, the makers were smart enough to employ film techniques which tend to gloss over the script's weaknesses.As Steven and Emily Taylor, Douglas and Paltrow are perfectly matched. Both have innocent looking facades, but these barely cover personalities underneath, which seem quite capable of cleverness and deception. Mr. Douglas's character may be more transparently criminal, but it is Paltrow's cultivated multi-lingual Emily which leaves one wondering. Is this woman a true victim, or is she simply the smartest player in this game?Viggo Mortensen does well in the role of her lover, whom you decidedly would not want to bring home. Nice characters rarely last long in this type of story. The three main characters, under Billy August's direction, bring off a cat and mouse thriller, which is far more intense than the Hitchcock version.While the plot covers very familiar territory, the movie's elegant look, which is uniquely Hollywood, dominates the picture. Having little substance to work with, the director pulled out the stops on style. Perhaps he figured that, if we were going to travel a well worn path, we might as well go like we were in a Lexus, rather than a Subaru.",4,An elegant thriller,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,3196,"['Perfect', 'Murder', 'opened', 'theaters', 'start', 'summer', '1998', 'did', 'brisk', 'business', 'being', 'mowed', 'down', 'season', 'high', 'profile', 'fare', 'Actually', 'held', 'own', 'rather', 'well', 'once', 'again', 'public', 'more', 'experts', 'think', 'happy', 'paradox', 'much', 'public', 'correct', 'choices', 'are', 'due', 'fact', ""n't"", 'know', 'everything', 'Critics', 'do.Many', 'critics', 'get', 'religion', 'so', 'speak', 'Certain', 'truths', 'become', 'holy', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', ""'The"", 'Master', 'Suspense', 'movie', 'remake', 'one', 'works', 'damned', 'first', 'foot', 'film', 'shot', 'self-appointed', 'guardians', 'cinema', 'can', 'become', 'menacing', 'anger', 'hostility', ""'d"", 'think', 'Hollywood', 'executives', 'were', 'running', 'around', 'trying', 'knock', 'off', 'Pope', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'based', 'play', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'Hitchcock', 'made', 'film', 'early', '1950s', 'contract', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'do', 'not', 'question', 'place', 'history', 'not', 'Hitchock', 'works', 'carry', 'equal', 'weight', 'did', 'not', 'Frederick', 'Knott', 'play', 'reluctantly', 'agreed', 'do', 'movie', 'version', 'exchange', 'studio', 'letting', 'do', 'pet', 'project', 'result', 'let', 'make', 'brilliant', 'successful', 'Rear', 'Window', 'gave', 'mediocre', 'successful', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'was', 'based', 'script', 'studio', 'already', 'owned', 'happened', 'be', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'young', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'play', 'opposite', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Davis', 'had', 'already', 'proved', 'ability', 'rehashed', 'suspense', 'Warner', 'film', 'version', 'Fugitive', '.The', 'movie', 'suffers', 'not', 'least', 'when', 'compared', 'Hitch', 'version', 'anything', 'better', 'picture', 'obviously', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'mannered', 'static', 'plot', 'been', 'extensively', 'updated', 'one', 'key', 'scene', 'involving', 'telephone', 'failings', 'are', 'due', 'same', 'elements', 'bothered', 'Hitch', 'play', 'close', 'being', 'potboiler', 'Still', 'new', 'version', 'makers', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'employ', 'film', 'techniques', 'tend', 'gloss', 'script', 'weaknesses.As', 'Steven', 'Emily', 'Taylor', 'Douglas', 'Paltrow', 'are', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'have', 'innocent', 'looking', 'facades', 'barely', 'cover', 'personalities', 'seem', 'quite', 'capable', 'cleverness', 'deception', 'Mr.', 'Douglas', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'transparently', 'criminal', 'Paltrow', 'cultivated', 'multi-lingual', 'Emily', 'one', 'wondering', 'woman', 'true', 'victim', 'simply', 'smartest', 'player', 'game', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'well', 'role', 'lover', 'whom', 'decidedly', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'bring', 'home', 'Nice', 'characters', 'rarely', 'last', 'long', 'type', 'story', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Billy', 'August', 'direction', 'bring', 'off', 'cat', 'mouse', 'thriller', 'far', 'more', 'intense', 'Hitchcock', 'plot', 'very', 'familiar', 'territory', 'movie', 'elegant', 'look', 'uniquely', 'Hollywood', 'picture', 'Having', 'little', 'substance', 'work', 'director', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'style', 'Perhaps', 'figured', 'were', 'going', 'travel', 'well', 'worn', 'path', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'go', 'were', 'Lexus', 'rather', 'Subaru']",N/A

109269,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,0790741563,mrliteral,"[1, 5]","Among Alfred Hitchcock movies, Dial M for Murder is considered a good minor work, perhaps most notable for it being originally shot in 3-D.  A Perfect Murder, a re-make of this film, shows that even minor Hitchcock is often better than many things made today.As in the original, the premise remains the same:  a man being cheated on by his wife arranges her ""perfect murder"" only to have it go wrong.  There are elements that are definitely different, however, principally dealing with the lover being the recruited killer in this case.  This leads to some twists that are unique to this version.The fundamental flaws are in the characters.  One of the big strengths in the original was Ray Milland as the cuckolded husband.  Homicidal tendencies aside, he is a much more interesting character than his wife's lover.  Michael Douglas, on the other hand, is less compelling (and less pleasant) in his parallel role.  Viggo Mortensen is especially weak, half-mumbling through his role and with no real charms that would suggest why Gwyneth Paltrow would have an affair with him.  No character is very sympathetic and all the actors have done better elsewhere.The direction by Andrew Davis is likewise problematic, with all the subtlety of a wrecking ball.  Rather than clever foreshadowing, we are hit over the head with plot elements to make sure we understand that they will be significant.  For example, there is an unusual amount of focus on a meat thermometer that rather bluntly points out that this mundane object will have importance later.  Davis is successful at least in showing he is different than Hitchcock; by the end of this movie, I definitely knew he was no Hitchcock.

Here Andrew Davis remakes Dial M for Murder and turns it into A Perfect Murder. Even the less inspired title should give you prior warning. This is an A-to-B film which is so restrained and predictable no one really is aloud to act; All you needed here was bodies saying lines.Micheal Douglas plays Gordon Gecko, a financial tycoon who, on the precipice of financial ruin, decides to have his wife murdered so he collect her life insurance. Yes I know I just called Douglas' character Gordon Gecko but does it really matter weather I call him Gecko, Nicholas Van Orton, or in the case of this film, Steven Taylor ? This is Michael Douglas by-the-numbers, a cut throat business man with a heart of ice and a God complex. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the trophy wife scorned by the neglect of her husband and Viggo Mortensen is Paltrow's white-trash, con-man, street artist, love interest. Seriously, what is it with hollywood and always making the rich glamour girl go right after the ""hot"" trashy guy ? Dosen't he have to have some personality or something ?Now if you haven't seen Dial M for Murder chances are you'll find this film smart but really, it's not. Yes the planning for assissination is clever but making Douglas's character so obviously the protagonist is a cheat because you know Paltrow's character would deduce quickly what reallly is going on. Another thing is the atmosphere of this film, it's so dreary and cold. A character who feels trapped and un-loved should simply not just go after the hottest young person, she feel like she is cared about or belonged ? Where is that in relationship between Paltrow and Mortensen ? Is there something so bad about romance ? Is that too old-fashioned for the 90's ? Films aren't suppose to be realistic, they are an escape. This film dosen't seem like an escape, it's an unpleasant journey into nothing. However I digress, the point is you just don't see why Gwen is attracted to Viggo, surely there is more than one trashy street artist in New York ?The film ends in what else ? Instead of any mystery or intrigue like the brilliant Dial M for Murder play, it's simply a matter of Mortensen exposing Douglas to his wife.

Schneider,"[14, 15]","Having never seen the Alfred Hitchcock classic DIAL M FOR MURDER, I have absolutely nothing with which to compare this film, except the slick mystery/suspense thrillers of the 1980's and '90's.  In this category, A PERFECT MURDER (1998) ranks among the better ones.With Michael Douglas at his sordid best, Gwyneth Paltrow in the middle of her breakout year (doing films such as GREAT EXPECTATIONS--another re-make, SLIDING DOORS, HUSH and finally, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, which resulted in a well-deserved Oscar statue for her) and still-rising Viggo Mortensen, the screenplay by Patrick Smith Kelly fits each of these actors' personas so neatly that you would swear the words were written with these actors fully in mind.  Add in the lush photograghy, which successfully captures the deep, brooding tone of the film and you've got a real winner here.Indoor shots in the townhouse where Douglas and Paltrow's characters live reveal tall ceilings and lots of sharp, sinister brown and orange colors.  Shots in Mortensen's artist's loft display soft blue-gray hues and wide spaces filled with work (as opposed to the townhouse which is filled solely with material &quot;things&quot;).  The dialogue fits each character and remains true.  Even with all the twists and turns in the plot (expected in films like this, anyway), the story remains interesting and does not feel contrived.It's amazing that Warner Bros. waited a full 5 years after this film's initial release to put it out on DVD.  I think the wait was well worth it--both the sound and picture quality on this disc are excellent.If you have noticed that I have only commented on the technical merits of A PERFECT MURDER and not the story, this is intentional, as the story itself is neatly summed up in one sentence--Douglas is a rich financial wiz who's married to an unhappy Paltrow who is happily cheating on him with Mortensen, uses his street smarts to figure out what's going on and then blackmails Mortensen to off wifey for him. The point in this film is not the story itself; rather, it is about style and the way in which it is presented.  A PERFECT MURDER scores big on all counts.  Michael Douglas is the main soldifying force in this film--it is impossible to think of an actor better suited for the erotic thriller sub-genre than he is; after all, he starred in the film that defined the erotic thriller, FATAL ATTRACTION.  Add A PERFECT MURDER to the list.Andrew Davis, you directed a very competent film with this outing.

Contrary to popular belief, this is not a remake of the famous 1954 Alfred Hitchcock movie that was also based on this play.In this movie, Wall Street businessman Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) seems like a devoted and caring husband...He isn't.His beautiful, rich, sophisticated, accomplished, and much younger wife Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) seems like the perfect wife...She isn't.And when Steven hires Emily's lover (Vitto Mortensen) to kill her, it seems like a perfect murder...It isn't.In fact, nothing is what it seems to be in this sleek and stylish thriller filled with suspense and smart, sharp dialogue.At each unexpected twist and turn in his ""perfect"" murder plot, Steven manages to improvise brilliantly.  (The numerous twists in this movie are what keeps it interesting and suspenseful.)Michael Douglas gives an extraordinary performance as the Wall Street wheeler-dealer Steven Taylor.  Both Paltrow and Mortensen also give good, interesting performances.The inside photograpy of the Taylors' luxurious apartment is beautiful.  Actually, this entire movie is filmed quite well.  The background music helps add to each scene.I had problems with the movie's ending.  I felt it was not of the same high calibre as the rest of the movie.  But wait!  There is an alternative ending that I thought was much more satisfying.Finally, the DVD itself (Special Edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a few extras, the alternative ending (alluded too above), I felt, being the most interesting.In conclusion, this is a sleek, sophisticated, and stylish movie that keeps you absorbed in it due to its numerous twists and turns!!(1997;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  rated 'R')+++++",5,A perfect thriller with unexpected twists,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,1760,"['+++++This', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'Contrary', 'popular', 'belief', 'not', 'remake', 'famous', '1954', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'based', 'play.In', 'movie', 'Wall', 'Street', 'businessman', 'Steven', 'Taylor', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'devoted', 'caring', 'husband', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'sophisticated', 'accomplished', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'Emily', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'perfect', 'wife', ""isn't.And"", 'when', 'Steven', 'Emily', 'lover', 'Vitto', 'Mortensen', 'kill', 'perfect', 'murder', 'fact', 'nothing', 'what', 'be', 'sleek', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'filled', 'suspense', 'smart', 'sharp', 'dialogue.At', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'turn', 'perfect', 'murder', 'plot', 'Steven', 'improvise', 'brilliantly', 'numerous', 'twists', 'movie', 'are', 'what', 'interesting', 'suspenseful', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Wall', 'Street', 'wheeler-dealer', 'Steven', 'Taylor', 'Paltrow', 'Mortensen', 'also', 'give', 'good', 'interesting', 'performances.The', 'inside', 'photograpy', 'Taylors', 'luxurious', 'apartment', 'beautiful', 'Actually', 'entire', 'movie', 'filmed', 'quite', 'well', 'background', 'music', 'add', 'scene.I', 'had', 'problems', 'movie', 'ending', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'high', 'calibre', 'rest', 'movie', 'wait', 'alternative', 'ending', 'thought', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying.Finally', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Edition', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'few', 'extras', 'alternative', 'ending', 'alluded', 'too', 'above', 'felt', 'being', 'most', 'interesting.In', 'conclusion', 'sleek', 'sophisticated', 'stylish', 'movie', 'absorbed', 'due', 'numerous', 'twists', '1997', '1', 'hr', '50', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', 'rated', 'R', '+++++']",N/A

Such is the case with their latest release of  A Perfect Murder. The studio could've saved the money and release this  moderate hit movie on DVD without any supplement, instead the disc contains  enough extras to add another interesting dimension to the movie. For  starter, I think it is a great idea for the studio to include an  alternative ending on DVD when there is one. Many movies are screen tested  with different endings prior to the release. Usually the one that garnered  the most favorable responses from the test audiences will be chose. With  the alternative ending on DVD, we are allowed the oppurtunity to see what  the test audiences saw and perhaps we might arrive on a different  conclusion. In The Boxer, I prefer the alternative ending which feel to  have more of a closure than the original. For A Perfect Murder, I can see  the reason behind why the original ending was a better choice. It's just  another interesting aspect that I hope to see more on DVDs in the  future.The other supplements include a commentary track given by Michael  Douglas, director Andrew Davis, and screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly. That  should be enough for this movie, but another commentary track is included  with the producer, designers, cinematographer, and other crew. Having  Douglas on a commentary track is a rare oppurtunity, so it was interesting  to hear him talk about the role and career experiences. Most of the  commentary though is occupied by director Davis and screenwriter Kelly. The  movie is full of implausibilities and I was curious to see how they were  going to wriggle out some explanations. Behind much enthusiasm, each did  their part in dissecting the film and provided many interesting tidbits  about the production that somehow lent more credibility to the plot.  Unfortunately, the other commentary track is very difficult to understand  as the background soundtrack is left too loud.The pressing of this dual  side, single layer DVD is excellent as with most Warner releases. There are  some slight digital artifacts on the edges, but you have to really look  hard to notice them. The production design evolves around the posh New York  apartment where Steven and Emily live and a cluttered artist studio where  David and Emily consume their affair. The rich and warm lighting in  Steven's surrounding accentuates the luxurious lifestyle, whereas David's  studio has more of a stark atmosphere. Colors have strong characterisitc  and images are razor-sharp. Blacks are near glossy and shadow details are  distinct. The picture is perfectly framed at approximately 1.85:1 and a pan  and scan version is available on the other side.Most of the ambience of  the Dolby Digital soundtrack is provided by James Newton Howard's score  which has an expansive frontal stage, but not as prominent in the  surrounds. The richly layered score is effective, but also a very typical  thriller style with heavy brass and percussion. It doesn't make me want to  run out and buy the CD soundtrack. The city environment provides for an  occassional split surrounds and punctuates by full envelopment from traffic  and train noise. Dialogue is naturally integrated.A Perfect Murder is  watchable mainly for the three leading cast. At the same time, Paltrow and  Douglas generate zero chemistry together. There is a nagging question of  what Emily saw in Steven in the first place, especially when she is  wealthier and twice as young. The suspense never reaches a boiling point as  your mind is constantly trying to steer past the gaping holes in the plot.  Moreover, the three characters are difficult to empathize with; one wants  to kill his wife, the second is a con man, and the third is an adulterer.  My recommendation is for rental and the supplements will add extra values  if your interest is in the production.",3,The suspense never reaches a boiling point.,911260800,"11 17, 1998",1998,4011,"['Warner', ""n't"", 'produced', 'significant', 'hit', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'sure', 'know', 'how', 'produce', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'somehow', 'make', 'movies', 'bit', 'more', 'compelling', 'Such', 'case', 'latest', 'release', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'studio', 'could', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'money', 'release', 'moderate', 'hit', 'movie', 'DVD', 'supplement', 'instead', 'disc', 'enough', 'extras', 'add', 'interesting', 'dimension', 'movie', 'starter', 'think', 'great', 'idea', 'studio', 'include', 'alternative', 'ending', 'DVD', 'when', 'one', 'Many', 'movies', 'are', 'screen', 'tested', 'different', 'endings', 'prior', 'release', 'Usually', 'one', 'garnered', 'most', 'favorable', 'responses', 'test', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'chose', 'alternative', 'ending', 'DVD', 'are', 'allowed', 'oppurtunity', 'see', 'what', 'test', 'audiences', 'saw', 'perhaps', 'might', 'arrive', 'different', 'conclusion', 'Boxer', 'prefer', 'alternative', 'ending', 'feel', 'have', 'more', 'closure', 'original', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'can', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'original', 'ending', 'was', 'better', 'choice', 'just', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'DVDs', 'future.The', 'other', 'supplements', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'given', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Davis', 'screenwriter', 'Patrick', 'Smith', 'Kelly', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'movie', 'commentary', 'track', 'included', 'producer', 'designers', 'cinematographer', 'other', 'crew', 'Having', 'Douglas', 'commentary', 'track', 'rare', 'oppurtunity', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'talk', 'role', 'career', 'experiences', 'Most', 'commentary', 'though', 'occupied', 'director', 'Davis', 'screenwriter', 'Kelly', 'movie', 'full', 'implausibilities', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'were', 'going', 'wriggle', 'out', 'explanations', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'did', 'part', 'dissecting', 'film', 'provided', 'many', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'production', 'somehow', 'lent', 'more', 'credibility', 'plot', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'commentary', 'track', 'very', 'difficult', 'understand', 'background', 'soundtrack', 'left', 'too', 'loud.The', 'pressing', 'dual', 'side', 'single', 'layer', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'most', 'Warner', 'are', 'slight', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'edges', 'have', 'really', 'look', 'hard', 'notice', 'production', 'design', 'posh', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'where', 'Steven', 'Emily', 'live', 'cluttered', 'artist', 'studio', 'where', 'David', 'Emily', 'consume', 'affair', 'rich', 'warm', 'lighting', 'Steven', 'surrounding', 'luxurious', 'lifestyle', 'David', 'studio', 'more', 'stark', 'atmosphere', 'Colors', 'have', 'strong', 'characterisitc', 'images', 'are', 'razor-sharp', 'Blacks', 'are', 'near', 'glossy', 'shadow', 'details', 'are', 'distinct', 'picture', 'perfectly', 'framed', 'approximately', '1.85:1', 'pan', 'scan', 'version', 'available', 'other', 'side.Most', 'ambience', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'soundtrack', 'provided', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'score', 'expansive', 'frontal', 'stage', 'not', 'prominent', 'surrounds', 'richly', 'layered', 'score', 'effective', 'also', 'very', 'typical', 'thriller', 'style', 'heavy', 'brass', 'percussion', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'city', 'environment', 'occassional', 'split', 'surrounds', 'punctuates', 'full', 'envelopment', 'traffic', 'train', 'noise', 'Dialogue', 'naturally', 'integrated.A', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'watchable', 'mainly', 'three', 'leading', 'cast', 'same', 'time', 'Paltrow', 'Douglas', 'generate', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'together', 'nagging', 'question', 'what', 'Emily', 'saw', 'Steven', 'first', 'place', 'especially', 'when', 'wealthier', 'twice', 'young', 'suspense', 'never', 'boiling', 'point', 'mind', 'constantly', 'trying', 'steer', 'gaping', 'holes', 'plot', 'Moreover', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'difficult', 'empathize', 'one', 'kill', 'wife', 'second', 'con', 'man', 'third', 'adulterer', 'recommendation', 'rental', 'supplements', 'will', 'add', 'extra', 'values', 'interest', 'production']",N/A
109293,A35PRTXTXU9EZF,0790741563,William T. Parnell,"[0, 0]","Andrew Davis' remake of the Hitchcock classic ""Dial M for Murder"" takes the story into the nineties and adds a few twists of its own. Michael Douglas is brilliant as Steven Taylor, a Wall Street mogul whose forceful  persona extends beyond his business dealings and into his personal  relationships. Gwyneth Paltrow is less convincing as his much younger wife  who happens to be heir to a 100 million dollar estate. Completing the  triangle is Viggo Mortensen as the starving artist who is currently having  an affair with Paltrow. Of the three leads Douglas of course, gives the  best performance while I found Paltrow to be a little too stilted.  Mortensen is very good most of the time-a little flat in a few scenes but  sufficiently devious.This is a very intriguing and suspenseful film that  grabs you right from the start and never lets go. At least that is until  the latter stages when it becomes apparent what the outcome of the film  will be and I must say, I didn't like the ending. To be fair, a film  centered around three leads does limit the possible outcomes. An alternate  ending is include on the DVD but it really isn't that different from the  original. The audio commentaries included (there are two) are not really as  good as some that I have heard. We learn things such as the fact that  Mortensen really painted the pictures seen in the flat (who cares?). A  little more interesting was how they came up with the idea for the murder  weapon.The picture quality of this DVD is excellent and probably as good  as anything out there. The sound is great as well with a Dolby 5.1 track  and great score. The extras include the aforementioned alternate ending and  commentaries as well as bios and production notes. The DVD main menu is  very nice and features scenes from the movie viewed through a keyhole  matte. Strangely absent though is the films trailer.This film will  definitely hold your attention the first time you see it. The question then  becomes-is it a movie you will watch time after time and therefore one you  will want to purchase? For true fans of the genre and/or Michael Douglas  the answer will probably be yes-others would be well-advised to rent this  one.

It happened to me. I don't know if anybody have seen ""RED ROCK WEST (1993)"", but the plot was same at the beginning and I'm sure they made that movie on the plot of older movie either that I've not seen it yet. anyway that feeling will be gone after first 30 minutes and you'll encounter an intriguing and unpredictable story which maintain it's suspense till the end. the plot was not something new but the story was and even the plot was old but it's a kind of plot that they can make 100 movies on it and people may go to cinema and watch all 100 movies without any complain. scenario was very accurate and actings were brilliant. It was one of greatest Gewynth Paltrow appearances too and I'd not seen her as beautiful as she was in this movie. she was perfect and sexy.And some words about DVD. Term of ""Special Edition"" which has been printed on this DVD would not bother anyone but honestly there is nothing special. Two audio commentaries that were not really necessary. no featurette, the best part of special features was an Alternated ending. Maybe it's not a place to discuss about the tradition but I think when they put an alternate ending option in a DVD, they have to make it playable during the movie. not only an isolated feature. so that's not the problem here. 95% of DVDs are at the same way.This is a one time movie. probably two, with your wife or girlfriend for the second time. but for the third time??
