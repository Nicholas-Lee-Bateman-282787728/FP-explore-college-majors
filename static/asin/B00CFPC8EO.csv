1646843,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B00CFPC8EO,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[3, 4]","...lead to an unsatisfying conclusion.""Forgetting the Girl"" is a genre-confused, muddled mess of a movie that quickly will make you lose interest in the fate of any of its main characters as it tries to decide what it wants to be. In the end, it can't make up its own mind about whether it's a psycho-sexual thriller, a whodunit, or a piece of noir about urban alienation (and lets not even talk about the dalliances into romcom as Kevin kvetches in front of his dates about the latest stupid thing he's just said). In the end, it executes none of these in an elegant way, and led me to total indifference about what happens to any of its main characters.The movie centers on the life of Kevin Wolfe, a 30-something New York City studio photographer. He specializes in head shots for aspiring models and actresses (""$300 for the digital package; prints extra...""). His M.O. is to ask each of his subjects out sometime during their photo sessions. Then, when he is either rejected immediately --or after an awkward date or two-- he engages in some sublimating activity to help him forget about them (a trip to the MOMA; a gym membership, a shopping spree...you get the picture). Orbiting Kevin's creepy little world are his assistant Jamie, all goth and black (and in recovery, full of self-loathing and secretly crazy about Kevin...really crazy...as in stalking him on dates crazy) and his landlord, Tanner. Tanner seems to do nothing other than collect rent from Kevin and share his latest discoveries in porn. Lingering in the background are Kevin's grandmother (Ruby) and Jamie's gay 12-step sponsor, Derek.Kevin's dates are awkward because of his lingering mommy issues (she died during the birth of his sister), enduring sister issues (his younger sister drowned when he was seven or eight), and a total lack of filters when navigating the early hours and days of relationships.When Jamie confesses her long-time crush on Kevin, the plot thickens. But by this point, I had stopped caring what happens to either of them. Suffice it to say there are connections between Jamie's self-loathing, Kevin's awkwardness, and some of the reasons he works so hard to ""forget"" his girls.In the end, the movie takes mercy on us by being only 85 minutes long, although it seems like much longer as it overindulges in both Kevin's fidgetiness with his dates (think of Billy Crystal or Woody Allen) and Jamie's obsession with Kevin. It creeps (literally and figuratively) towards a most unsatisfying conclusion. So here's the takeaway: if you are an aspiring actress or model, and your head shot studio photographer hits on you: both ""yes"" and ""no"" have equal potential to be the wrong answer. Kevin had his ways for forgetting the girls. You've been warned: watch this movie at your peril, because if you do, I don't have a suggestion for how to make you forget you've made such a choice.This is a release from RAM Releasing, which provided this copy for review.",2,Awkward characters acting in improbable ways...,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,2952,"['lead', 'unsatisfying', 'conclusion', 'Forgetting', 'Girl', 'genre-confused', 'muddled', 'mess', 'movie', 'quickly', 'will', 'make', 'lose', 'interest', 'fate', 'main', 'characters', 'decide', 'what', 'be', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'psycho-sexual', 'thriller', 'whodunit', 'piece', 'noir', 'urban', 'alienation', 'not', 'even', 'talk', 'dalliances', 'romcom', 'Kevin', 'kvetches', 'front', 'dates', 'latest', 'stupid', 'thing', 'just', 'said', 'end', 'none', 'elegant', 'way', 'led', 'total', 'indifference', 'what', 'main', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'life', 'Kevin', 'Wolfe', '30-something', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'studio', 'photographer', 'head', 'shots', 'aspiring', 'models', 'actresses', '300', 'digital', 'package', 'prints', 'extra', 'M.O', 'ask', 'subjects', 'out', 'sometime', 'photo', 'sessions', 'Then', 'when', 'either', 'rejected', 'immediately', 'awkward', 'date', 'two', 'sublimating', 'activity', 'help', 'forget', 'trip', 'MOMA', 'gym', 'membership', 'shopping', 'spree', 'get', 'picture', 'Orbiting', 'Kevin', 'creepy', 'little', 'world', 'are', 'assistant', 'Jamie', 'goth', 'black', 'recovery', 'full', 'self-loathing', 'secretly', 'crazy', 'Kevin', 'really', 'crazy', 'stalking', 'dates', 'crazy', 'landlord', 'Tanner', 'Tanner', 'do', 'nothing', 'other', 'collect', 'rent', 'Kevin', 'share', 'latest', 'discoveries', 'porn', 'Lingering', 'background', 'are', 'Kevin', 'grandmother', 'Ruby', 'Jamie', 'gay', '12-step', 'sponsor', 'Derek.Kevin', 'dates', 'are', 'awkward', 'lingering', 'mommy', 'issues', 'died', 'birth', 'sister', 'enduring', 'sister', 'issues', 'younger', 'sister', 'drowned', 'when', 'was', 'seven', 'eight', 'total', 'lack', 'filters', 'when', 'navigating', 'early', 'hours', 'days', 'relationships.When', 'Jamie', 'long-time', 'crush', 'Kevin', 'plot', 'thickens', 'point', 'had', 'stopped', 'caring', 'what', 'Suffice', 'say', 'are', 'connections', 'Jamie', 'self-loathing', 'Kevin', 'awkwardness', 'reasons', 'so', 'hard', 'forget', 'girls.In', 'end', 'movie', 'mercy', 'being', 'only', '85', 'minutes', 'long', 'much', 'longer', 'Kevin', 'fidgetiness', 'dates', 'think', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Jamie', 'obsession', 'Kevin', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'most', 'unsatisfying', 'conclusion', 'here', 'takeaway', 'are', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'model', 'head', 'shot', 'studio', 'photographer', 'hits', 'yes', 'have', 'equal', 'potential', 'be', 'wrong', 'answer', 'Kevin', 'had', 'ways', 'forgetting', 'girls', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'watch', 'movie', 'peril', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'suggestion', 'how', 'make', 'forget', ""'ve"", 'made', 'choice.This', 'release', 'RAM', 'Releasing', 'provided', 'copy', 'review']",Forgetting the Girl
1646844,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00CFPC8EO,Charles Ashbacher,"[3, 4]","This video is disturbing, while there is a conclusion, it is not closure and there is one significant unanswered question regarding a missing girl and the main characters male friend. Kevin Wolfe lives in and works as a photographer in New York City. He does only tasteful head shots of aspiring actresses/models and he has a difficult time interacting on a personal level with the opposite sex.  Early in the movie we learn that there was a traumatic event in his life when he was a boy involving his younger sister.Wolfe comes across as completely normal and friendly towards women when he is behind the camera, but once that shield is lowered, he becomes flustered and uncertain. He has a female assistant in his studio that dresses rather extravagantly, but that is to cover her very low self-esteem and the loathing she has for herself.The movie moves back and forth from Kevin speaking to the camera and describing how he is trying to forget the women that modeled for him to him speaking to his grandmother about his deceased mother and sister to his interactions with the women that he has managed to get to agree to go out with him.Spooky is an understated word to describe how Kevin is when he is on a date with a woman, there is no confidence or resolve in his actions. Even though the women are beautiful and pleasant, his actions cannot help but creep them out, the only one that seems able to stand him for any length of time is his assistant.When one of the models goes missing, there are hints that Kevin and his male landlord are involved, there is a scene where they are looking at some photos on the landlord's computer but the viewer does not see them. There is a major creepy factor in this scene as the viewer will invariably assume the worst and probably for good reason.There is a violent scene near the end and then one that is even more disturbing that involves Kevin's assistant. When the movie ends, you feel sorry for the assistant, despise Kevin, yet know that his dark path may be long and reach out to touch and damage many other innocent females.",5,"Dark, meandering, no real closure at the end, yet it holds your attention during and after",1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,2079,"['video', 'disturbing', 'conclusion', 'not', 'closure', 'one', 'significant', 'unanswered', 'question', 'regarding', 'missing', 'girl', 'main', 'characters', 'male', 'friend', 'Kevin', 'Wolfe', 'photographer', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'only', 'tasteful', 'head', 'shots', 'aspiring', 'actresses/models', 'difficult', 'time', 'interacting', 'personal', 'level', 'opposite', 'sex', 'Early', 'movie', 'learn', 'was', 'traumatic', 'event', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'involving', 'younger', 'sister.Wolfe', 'completely', 'normal', 'friendly', 'towards', 'women', 'when', 'camera', 'once', 'shield', 'lowered', 'flustered', 'uncertain', 'female', 'assistant', 'studio', 'rather', 'extravagantly', 'cover', 'very', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'loathing', 'herself.The', 'movie', 'moves', 'back', 'forth', 'Kevin', 'speaking', 'camera', 'describing', 'how', 'trying', 'forget', 'women', 'modeled', 'speaking', 'grandmother', 'deceased', 'mother', 'sister', 'interactions', 'women', 'managed', 'get', 'agree', 'go', 'out', 'him.Spooky', 'understated', 'word', 'describe', 'how', 'Kevin', 'when', 'date', 'woman', 'confidence', 'resolve', 'actions', 'Even', 'women', 'are', 'beautiful', 'pleasant', 'actions', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'creep', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'able', 'stand', 'length', 'time', 'assistant.When', 'one', 'models', 'missing', 'are', 'hints', 'Kevin', 'male', 'landlord', 'are', 'involved', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'looking', 'photos', 'landlord', 'computer', 'viewer', 'not', 'see', 'major', 'creepy', 'factor', 'scene', 'viewer', 'will', 'invariably', 'assume', 'worst', 'probably', 'good', 'reason.There', 'violent', 'scene', 'end', 'then', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'Kevin', 'assistant', 'When', 'movie', 'feel', 'sorry', 'assistant', 'despise', 'Kevin', 'yet', 'know', 'dark', 'path', 'may', 'be', 'long', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'damage', 'many', 'other', 'innocent', 'females']",Forgetting the Girl
1646845,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00CFPC8EO,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","What if Sheldon Cooper of the Big Bang Theory wasn't very smart? This is what bothers me about Forgetting the Girl. The lead character, Kevin Wolfe, is a creepy misfit photographer that moves, acts, and talks just like Sheldon Cooper, except Kevin isn't exactly very smart. Forgetting the Girl takes a long time to get going, it moves slowly, and messes with the timeline; and when the mystery unfolds, it is pretty predicable. The film is badly marketed - it is not a slasher film.I love independent film, especially films that flip life upside down and take a different look at the world, things large studio productions can't afford to do because they are too risky. Forgetting the Girl seems like it should be just that, independent, odd, edgy, and maybe even a bit violent - the previews, the ad copy, the film description, the words on the DVD box - all led me to believe that. I was so disappointed that this is a completely different film; the film is a victim of poor marketing.The major problem with the film, I didn't really care about the characters. Kevin is odd, not somebody I would dislike, not somebody I would like - just somebody that was there, taking up space, fading into the background. Jamie, his make up assistant, tries to be too Goth, too made up, too crazy, too off beat. But in the end is just a mixed up depressed person that constantly calls her suicide hot line support person. The girls that Kevin meets are all just pretty faces, not terribly interesting; they become objects (Kevin says this later in the film, the models are all just objects - bones, muscles, skin). Because the film is a psychological thriller or mystery, I should care about the characters - they didn't really matter enough.There were big gaps in the dialog. After listening to the director commentary, this film was heavily scripted. Sadly, the actors sound like there was an outline and no real script, like a bad version of Dianne Keaton in a Woody Allen film. The acting wasn't awful, it wasn't great either.This is an incredibly well shot and recorded film. Every shot is perfectly lit, in perfect focus, and rock solid cameras - there is no shaky cam handheld footage. The film was shot on Red cameras, so the detail is film like. Dialog was crystal clear.The DVD includes a lot of bonus features. The film is a way too long one hour twenty-six minutes. There are six minutes of deleted scenes with or without director commentary. The director commentary is classic, I loved this footage, this was great acting, I hated to take it out, but we had to keep the story moving forward. Honestly, the deleted scenes needed to stay that way. Watching the film the first time I noticed this awful jump in continuity. Kevin leaves Beth's apartment, he exits the building and the storefront window looks like an adult store - not exactly the place where Beth would live. Turns out, in the deleted scenes we get to see a sequence where right after Kevin leaves Beth's apartment, he goes to a peep show. He leaves the adult theater on to the street - the location fits perfectly and makes sense. The director cut the peep show sequence out but left the exit scene. A horrible mistake. The DVD can be watched with director commentary. This film is a labor of love for the director Nate Taylor. If you really want to know about how long it took to make this film and how much he loves this film and the actors, it is worth listening to. Nate oddly sounds a lot like Kevin of the film. I slogged through it. They included a set of web videos - ultimately these are the teaser videos they posted on the internet trying to get buzz for the film. Actually, they are better made than the film. They also mislead about the direction this film goes - they keep making this sound like a horror film.This is one of the first films published by RAM Releasing. One of my favorite independent film publishers is Film Movement; they have an amazing long history of fantastic films. RAM Releasing is their foray into a different genre of films, where they can publish edgier films. Given Film Movement's history, I am confident that future releases from RAM will be better. In fact there is a great chance the next two films will be outstanding - the two previews included on the DVD for App and Hide and Seek look incredibly good.The film is not rated. It is meant for mature audiences. There is strong language, a lot of references to pornography, and a moment of graphic violence. Oddly, there is no nudity; honestly the film would have been much better with nudity.Forgetting the Girl is a victim of bad marketing. I was expecting something completely different, much more graphic, much edgier, and suspenseful. Instead it was a character film about people that I didn't really care much for.I was provided a copy for review.",3,Long,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,4813,"['What', 'Sheldon', 'Cooper', 'Big',

1646847,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00CFPC8EO,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 3]","We&#8217;ve been spoiled.  No, I&#8217;m not talking about plot details; rather, I&#8217;m talking about whodunits.  Those of us who truly enjoy whodunits have been inundated for decades with some quality yarns that&#8217;ve kept us guessing for years.  Granted, it&#8217;s hard to go back and watch them again as half of the fun is gone precisely because we know how it&#8217;ll end, so knowing that &#8216;the butler did it&#8217; releases us from the requirement to watch closely.  Instead, repeat viewings give us the chance to uncover something else, something that eluded us the first time, something that escaped notice or mention.  That&#8217;s the only joy in watching a great mystery again, and I suspect there might be more than a few who are willing to spend 85 minutes exploring what flew by from their first experience with FORGETTING THE GIRL.To be fair, they may not discover all that much, but what they will enjoy is a second helping to a great pairing of the film&#8217;s central players: Denham and Beamish.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Kevin Wolfe (played by Christopher Denham) is a big city photographer with no real dreams of making it big so much as he only wants to find something resembling true love.  In his quest, he&#8217;s committed himself to a single plan: he asks every single girl who sits with him for headshots if she&#8217;ll go out on a date with him.  Most decline, and few accept, but all of them end up forcing him to find some way to forget rejection, so Wolfe occupies his free time with activities requiring him to &#8216;forget the girl.&#8217;  After one of them who did accept ends up missing &#8211; Adrienne (Anna Camp, in an all-too-brief role) &#8211; Kevin suddenly finds himself questioning his past, present, and future only to realize that the danger may&#8217;ve been much closer than he ever realized.Make no bones about it: first and foremost, FORGETTING THE GIRL is a character drama.  The film is grounded in two terrific performances, those of Denham and his studio gal-pal, Jamie (Lindsay Beamish as a Gothic li&#8217;l mouse).  Tortured for years over her unspoken attraction to her boss, she&#8217;s consoled herself over her various failures with drugs and alcohol (we see in the story that she has a caring sponsor helping her through recovery), and she&#8217;s taken to berating the image of herself in the mirror&#8217;s reflection.  Still, she&#8217;s trapped in a Hell of her own making, applying make-up to generally make the women Kevin pursues more and more attractive.Whereas Jamie&#8217;s mental struggles are largely front-and-center much of the time, Kevin&#8217;s are always lurking beneath the surface.  True, he spends a good amount of time &#8216;confessing&#8217; to the audience &#8211; he narrates the film with the handy assistance of a slide projector &#8211; but, when he&#8217;s not directing or misdirecting us, Peter Moore Smith&#8217;s smart script explores Kevin&#8217;s attempts to piece together what happened with his kid sister when they were young.  Because he&#8217;s spent so much of his life forgetting girls, he can&#8217;t recall what it was that led to her drowning in the family pool, though he believes it couldn&#8217;t have been as simple as an accident.These two performances &#8211; one grounded in denial and one founded on TMI (Too Much Information) &#8211; anchor this wonderful duet.  It&#8217;s clear that circumstances will bring these two together in ways neither of them predicted, but it&#8217;s a fear of what might happen as a consequence that keeps an audience hoping and praying that it won&#8217;t happen.  It&#8217;s all cat-and-mouse, though it&#8217;s only psychological in nature.  It never steps right up and pounds a hammer over your head &#8230; but it just might somebody else in the picture.Lastly, there are a few other smaller performances in here &#8211; one by Elizabeth Rice as the fresh-faced potential suitor to Kevin&#8217;s affections, and another by BOARDWALK EMPIRE&#8217;s Paul Sparks as the sleazy neighbor/landlord who might be trafficking in evil &#8211; that spark and pop with just the right balance of emotive chemistry to this delightful concoction.  These subtle nuances add to an already great layer of work that&#8217;ll make FORGETTING hard to forget.FORGETTING THE GIRL (2012) is produced by Forgetting The Girl and Full Stealth Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by RAM Releasing.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly made independent features, and, as such, it serves up some high quality sights and sounds.  As for the special features, fans are in for a treat: the disc boasts a commentary track from director Taylor, deleted scenes, web videos that expand modestly on the story, and the theatrical trailer &#8211; a nice collection put together entirely for folks who fancies are tickled by this sort of fare.RECOMMENDED.  It&#8217;s rare for one to discover a finely-crafted character drama that flirts so successfully with serial killing, but &#8211; if that&#8217;s your yen &#8211; then you&#8217;d be well-served to discover FORGETTING THE GIRL.  No, there aren&#8217;t a lot of twists and turns, but there are just enough to keep you guessing throughout the picture&#8217;s polite hints at whodunit.  What&#8217;s more important &#8211; so far as this reviewer is concerned &#8211; is Denham&#8217;s smart turn as a lead here, so steeped in personal denial that it&#8217;s matched with equal manic intensity by Beamish&#8217;s obviously off-kilter kinda/sorta stalker.  It&#8217;s the one-two punch here that elevates GIRL to memorable cinema.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RAM Releasing provided me with an advance

It showed up as such a while back and the few reviews were all very negative (shocking, huh? trendy is more like it) so I didn't watch it till it showed up on NF recently. I am cutting and pasting my review from there:This film is not scary, but slightly suspenseful, and a little gritty. Its not horror or thriller, although it shows up in those searches. What it is is a very well done film that is really a character driven psychological drama that deals with death, trauma, loss, and connection. Or should I say dis-connection. If you enjoy films that are about off the beaten path people, people with issues, and like a puzzle (whodunnwhattowhoandhow)- there is a red herring cleverly concealed therein, that leaves you wondering till the end, literally, what's going on. The production values are strong, the acting is excellent, the story is interesting, unique, and the ending, poetic and ironically beautiful. A must see for anyone who likes artistic, indie flicks that portray a beyond the mainstream slice of life. And, as usual, ignore the haters.

1646850,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B00CFPC8EO,Joe Smart,"[2, 4]",The cover art makes this look like a thriller.  Unfortunately the filmmakers had other ideas.  Forgetting the Girl is about a studio photographer who takes head shots for wannabe actresses and his funky assistant who is not so secretly in love with him.  For the bulk of the film he narrates his general ineptitude with relationships and for more than 90% of its running time Forgetting the Girl plays like a dull indie relationship drama.  Then the movie takes a radical left turn but by that point its way too late to matter.  This doesn't succeed as a drama or as a thriller and is ultimately just a dreary downer with little to recommend it beyond Anna Camp's few scenes.

When he asks his clients for a date he is almost invariably shot down, and his rare successes are embarrassingly short lived.

Eventually his need leads to greater tragedy and a somewhat equivocal ending for Kevin himself.Forgetting the Girl is a realistic, gritty depiction of loneliness in the middle of an enormous city.  Besides the main story line, there are several secondary plots involvling Kevin's landlord and his assistant.

1646852,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00CFPC8EO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","Kevin Wolfe (Christopher Denham)  is a professional photographer, whose specialty is taking headshots, which means would be actresses and models look deeply into his lenses wearing big smiles, never thinking that the guy behind the camera taking those photos is not the one with whom they are trying to make a connection.  He thinks he makes a connection with Adrienne (Anna Camp), but she soon makes it clear to him that he was wrong.  A couple of dates with Beth (Elizabeth Rice) give Kevin reason to hope, but by that point in the film we are hardly optimistic that he can find anything remotely like a happy ending, although we could be wrong about that.Traumatized by the death of his sister as a child, Kevin has trouble remembering much about Nicole beyond the color of her eyes.  This is rather ironic, since he struggles to forget the women with who he has failed relationships.  Kevin is one of those people who berates himself out loud every time he has once again convinced himself that there is something there with a woman, even if the woman is still in the room.  Not surprisingly, Kevin is so busy being drawn to the women he sees through his camera that he is totally unaware that his assistant, Jamie (Lindsay Beamish) is totally into him.  She has her own issues, as a recovering addict, but love is a powerful thing.  Kevin's blind spot extends to Tanner (Paul Sparks), the creepy guy  who hovers around the photographer's life and the women whose pictures he takes.Director Nate Taylor's first feature film has a story and script by Peter Moore Smith, and was made for only $600K, which leads you to believe they waste a lot of money making movies at major studios.  &#34;Forgetting the Girl&#34; lives up to its self-declared &#34;gritty vision&#34; of Kevin and his world.  Denham's performance strikes the right balance between sympathy and strangeness, so that we feel for Kevin but are also uncomfortably with rooting for him to solve the problem of his love life.  This makes Denham perfect for the main role in this tale, because it is vitally important that we are drawn into the narrative but at the same time have the pesky feeling that there is something wrong that we just cannot put our finger on.I got the DVD for this movie, put it in the pile of ones I had not watched yet, and played it without knowing any other than the title of the movie, which made for a rather unique cinematic experience these days of knowing nothing about a movie.  The opening certainly establishes a sense of foreboding, but no matter how refined your skill at predicting how this one is going to play out, I think you will definitely be surprised by at least one if not more of its plot twists, making this one of the more memorable little horror flicks I have seen in sometime.  It was certainly the first one in a long time that I immediately went back and watched again.  The special features on this DVD include director's commentary, deleted scenes, and five web videos containing footage not in the film.",5,"""If you're watching this, you've discovered something you shouldn't have...""",1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,3025,"['Kevin', 'Wolfe', 'Christopher', 'Denham', 'professional', 'photographer', 'specialty', 'taking', 'headshots', 'would', 'be', 'actresses', 'models', 'look', 'deeply', 'lenses', 'wearing', 'big', 'smiles', 'never', 'thinking', 'guy', 'camera', 'taking', 'photos', 'not', 'one', 'whom', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'connection', 'connection', 'Adrienne', 'Anna', 'Camp', 'soon', 'clear', 'was', 'wrong', 'couple', 'dates', 'Beth', 'Elizabeth', 'Rice', 'give', 'Kevin', 'reason', 'hope', 'point', 'film', 'are', 'hardly', 'optimistic', 'can', 'find', 'anything', 'remotely', 'happy', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'that.Traumatized', 'death', 'sister', 'child', 'Kevin', 'trouble', 'remembering', 'much', 'Nicole', 'color', 'eyes', 'rather', 'ironic', 'forget', 'women', 'who', 'failed', 'relationships', 'Kevin', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'out', 'loud', 'time', 'once', 'again', 'convinced', 'something', 'there', 'woman', 'even', 'woman', 'still', 'room', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Kevin', 'so', 'busy', 'being', 'drawn', 'women', 'camera', 'totally', 'unaware', 'assistant', 'Jamie', 'Lindsay', 'Beamish', 'totally', 'own', 'issues', 'recovering', 'addict', 'love', 'powerful', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'blind', 'spot', 'Tanner', 'Paul', 'Sparks', 'creepy', 'guy', 'who', 'photographer', 'life', 'women', 'pictures', 'takes.Director', 'Nate', 'Taylor', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'story', 'script', 'Peter', 'Moore', 'Smith', 'was', 'made', 'only', '600K', 'believe', 'waste', 'lot', 'money', 'making', 'movies', 'major', 'studios', '34', 'Forgetting', 'Girl', '34', 'up', 'self-declared', '34', 'gritty', 'vision', '34', 'Kevin', 'world', 'Denham', 'performance', 'right', 'balance', 'sympathy', 'strangeness', 'feel', 'Kevin', 'are', 'also', 'uncomfortably', 'rooting', 'solve', 'problem', 'love', 'life', 'Denham', 'perfect', 'main', 'role', 'tale', 'vitally', 'important', 'are', 'drawn', 'narrative', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'pesky', 'feeling', 'something', 'wrong', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'finger', 'on.I', 'got', 'DVD', 'movie', 'put', 'pile', 'ones', 'had', 'not', 'watched', 'yet', 'played', 'knowing', 'other', 'title', 'movie', 'made', 'rather', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'days', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'movie', 'opening', 'certainly', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'matter', 'how', 'refined', 'skill', 'predicting', 'how', 'one', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'think', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'surprised', 'least', 'one', 'not', 'more', 'plot', 'twists', 'making', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'little', 'horror', 'flicks', 'have', 'seen', 'sometime', 'was', 'certainly', 'first', 'one', 'long', 'time', 'immediately', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'again', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'director', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'five', 'web', 'videos', 'containing', 'footage', 'not', 'film']",Forgetting the Girl
1646853,A2EMIIHBL60K7L,B00CFPC8EO,Luanne Ollivier,"[0, 0]","I'm a fan of Film Movement and their award winning films.  Film Movement has launched a new brand, Ram Releasing, that will be showcasing films of a different genre - thrillers, suspense, even horror films. And that's right up my alley - I love scary films. One of their first releases is Forgetting the Girl from director Nate Taylor.The film opens with Kevin Wolfe filming a 'if you see this...' talk. Kevin is a photographer specializing in head shots. He asks out every woman whose portrait he takes. And most say no. The few that do say yes rarely say yes a second time. And it those women that Kevin wants to forget. To forget he engages in activities such as a shopping spree or joining the gym. The one person he can't remember and doesn't want to forget is his sister, who drowned when they were both children.Spoilers below.I thought Christopher Denham did a good job in the role of Kevin. He presents as an affable young man with a ready smile for those whose attention he wants. But there's something off about him. His sense of desperation and obsessiveness isn't far beneath the surface. And something else is behind that glib exterior as well. Lindsay Beamish is Jamie, his suicidal make-up artist, who is infatuated with Kevin. She too turned in a good performance. There are a few other characters as well. Kevin's grandmother Ruby is there to act a historical record of Kevin's past. Jamie's sponsor seemed awkward and seemed to only be there to underscore Jamie's fragile state. (The camping trip was ridiculous) And the creepy, porn watching landlord? A very obvious red herring. Although I must say, his brief role was frightening - especially in the elevator with one of Kevin's clients.The exploration of Kevin's 'forgetting' would have been suitably creepy if it only applied to his adult life. And this would have sent the film in the direction that the trailer seemed to promise. I found the trailer misleading - the darkest bits of the film are showcased and seem to promise a different film than was delivered. Kevin's attempts to remember his sister just grew tiresome after a few times.But things speed up as both Kevin and Jamie start to lose control and things hurtle towards an inevitable, but sadly surprising ending. Forgetting the Girl was just okay for this viewer.

As a photographer, woman after woman, some very young, pose before his camera, while visions of his sister flash in and out of his memory. I found myself drawn into the excellent acting by all involved, especially Christopher Denham. The movie in itself is not exciting or filled with suspense, but there are some very strange characters  that kept me watching. Finally, we are given a shocking truth.

1646856,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00CFPC8EO,Tommy Dooley,"[0, 0]","Kevin is a photographer who `does women mostly', he works in his own studio with one assistant - Jamie. He seems to be unlucky in love and so has a thing whereby he asks every one of them out - normally to the movies. Most of them - understandably - say no. He is also haunted by the tragic death of his sister when he was a young boy and can not somehow reconcile that he is not somehow culpable in her death.He spends time telling us of the ways he has used to `forget' the many women he has been on dates with and at first this was sort of endearing, but as the film develops you will see the veil of innocence slowly slipping to reveal a much more questionable form of amnesia. Oh and Jamie is madly in love with him too.This has been described a `genre defying' by a few commentators, but it is probably best seen as a film of two or even three parts. The innocence , the questioning and the truth and that is where it becomes much more chilling and gets to the foundation or the whole raison d'tre of the movie. It is well acted and Christopher Denham as Kevin is particularly convincing. I think where it falls down is the slow reveal; so as that in the beginning you are not sure what is going on and aside from feeling sorry for Kevin you are left pretty much unengaged and whilst this may have been a necessary build up for the film makers it probably could have been handled better.Still I found this to be a very good watch, it did take its time though and I think I was non plussed for at least half and then hooked for the last half hour or so - so whilst some detractors may have been harsh they do still have a point - I, however remain pleased to have seen it.Please note I received a copy fro review purposes.",3,Unusual film of a photographer with development issues.,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,1727,"['Kevin', 'photographer', 'who', 'women', 'mostly', 'own', 'studio', 'one', 'assistant', 'Jamie', 'be', 'unlucky', 'love', 'so', 'thing', 'whereby', 'one', 'out', 'normally', 'movies', 'Most', 'understandably', 'say', 'also', 'haunted', 'tragic', 'death', 'sister', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'can', 'not', 'somehow', 'reconcile', 'not', 'somehow', 'culpable', 'death.He', 'time', 'telling', 'ways', 'used', 'forget', 'many', 'women', 'been', 'dates', 'first', 'was', 'sort', 'endearing', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'veil', 'innocence', 'slowly', 'slipping', 'reveal', 'much', 'more', 'questionable', 'form', 'amnesia', 'Oh', 'Jamie', 'madly', 'love', 'been', 'described', 'genre', 'defying', 'few', 'commentators', 'probably', 'best', 'seen', 'film', 'two', 'even', 'three', 'parts', 'innocence', 'questioning', 'truth', 'where', 'much', 'more', 'chilling', 'foundation', 'whole', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'Christopher', 'Denham', 'Kevin', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'think', 'where', 'down', 'slow', 'reveal', 'beginning', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'aside', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Kevin', 'are', 'left', 'pretty', 'much', 'unengaged', 'whilst', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'build', 'up', 'film', 'makers', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'better.Still', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'watch', 'did', 'take', 'time', 'think', 'was', 'non', 'plussed', 'least', 'half', 'then', 'hooked', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'whilst', 'detractors', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'harsh', 'do', 'still', 'have', 'point', 'however', 'remain', 'pleased', 'have', 'seen', 'it.Please', 'note', 'received', 'copy', 'fro', 'review', 'purposes']",Forgetting the Girl
