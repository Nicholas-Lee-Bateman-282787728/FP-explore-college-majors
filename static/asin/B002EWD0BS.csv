It also offers a postnatal workout, which I haven't yet tried.  The prenatal portion of the dvd runs @40 min.  I really, really like the instructor, Elena Brower - she knows what positions an expecting mother should enter into and has a wonderful sense of calm to her voice.I would not recommend this dvd to beginners, especially if they just ventured into yoga at the start of their pregnancy.  Instead, for beginners, I would recommend  The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 2: Yoga.In addition, if you are an advanced yogi, you will find this dvd is not the most challenging.  Instead, I would recommend something more like  Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga ~ Jennifer Wolfe for more advanced yogis.  However, this dvd is great to have for those days where you feel like your body has less energy as it does calm the body and allow for some really good flexibility poses.",5,Good dvd but not challenging for experienced yogis,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,931,"['definitely', 'great', 'dvd', 'very', 'calm', 'very', 'soothing', 'good', 'flow', 'also', 'postnatal', 'workout', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'tried', 'prenatal', 'portion', 'dvd', '40', 'min', 'really', 'really', 'instructor', 'Elena', 'Brower', 'what', 'positions', 'expecting', 'mother', 'should', 'enter', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'calm', 'voice.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'beginners', 'especially', 'just', 'ventured', 'yoga', 'start', 'pregnancy', 'Instead', 'beginners', 'would', 'recommend', 'Perfect', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'vol', '2', 'Yoga.In', 'addition', 'are', 'advanced', 'yogi', 'will', 'find', 'dvd', 'not', 'most', 'challenging', 'Instead', 'would', 'recommend', 'something', 'more', 'Prenatal', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', '~', 'Jennifer', 'Wolfe', 'more', 'advanced', 'yogis', 'However', 'dvd', 'great', 'have', 'days', 'where', 'feel', 'body', 'less', 'energy', 'calm', 'body', 'allow', 'really', 'good', 'flexibility', 'poses']",Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga

I didn't find that this yoga routine was any different from a non-pregnancy yoga routine. This yoga dvd may be ok for the first trimester and part of the second, but I strongly advise being careful when using this dvd for the latter part of pregnancy.",3,Not recommended for third trimester,1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,392,"['have', 'purchased', 'other', 'pregnancy', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'trimester', 'tried', 'dvd', '7', 'months', 'pregnant', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'yoga', 'routine', 'was', 'different', 'non-pregnancy', 'yoga', 'routine', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'may', 'be', 'ok', 'first', 'trimester', 'part', 'second', 'strongly', 'advise', 'being', 'careful', 'when', 'using', 'dvd', 'latter', 'part', 'pregnancy']",Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga
1265718,A34KY72ZH6B9VM,B002EWD0BS,CDN_SCO,"[2, 2]","I have been doing the prenatal yoga portion of this DVD through my 2nd and 3rd trimesters. I believe I'll be able to use it all the way to the end, as I find it has a good balance of relaxation and challenge and nothing inappropriate for late pregnancy. I really enjoy the standing series of poses. And I'm always happy when there's pigeon pose. The voice over doesn't bother me, as other yoga DVDs have this as well. The one thing I find backward in the DVD is the breathing for cat/cow or similar transitions (usually you'd exhale while rounding your back) - but it doesn't ruin the yoga at all.. Overall I'd recommend this DVD for the Prenatal section. I'm looking forward to doing the Postnatal section as well.Other prenatal DVD's I'd recommend: Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga - definitely more challenging and I had to give it up beyond 35 weeks due to heartburn (lots of downward dog); Desi Bartlett's Prenatal Yoga - very relaxing, but also has a good standing series of poses.",4,Prenatal Yoga Review,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,993,"['have', 'been', 'doing', 'prenatal', 'yoga', 'portion', 'DVD', '2nd', '3rd', 'trimesters', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'use', 'way', 'end', 'find', 'good', 'balance', 'relaxation', 'challenge', 'nothing', 'inappropriate', 'late', 'pregnancy', 'really', 'enjoy', 'standing', 'series', 'poses', ""'m"", 'always', 'happy', 'when', 'pigeon', 'pose', 'voice', ""n't"", 'bother', 'other', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'have', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'thing', 'find', 'backward', 'DVD', 'breathing', 'cat/cow', 'similar', 'transitions', 'usually', ""'d"", 'exhale', 'rounding', 'back', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'yoga', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Prenatal', 'section', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'doing', 'Postnatal', 'section', 'well.Other', 'prenatal', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Jennifer', 'Wolfe', 'Prenatal', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', 'definitely', 'more', 'challenging', 'had', 'give', 'up', '35', 'weeks', 'due', 'heartburn', 'lots', 'downward', 'dog', 'Desi', 'Bartlett', 'Prenatal', 'Yoga', 'very', 'relaxing', 'also', 'good', 'standing', 'series', 'poses']",Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga

She is soothing without being cheesy, and her instructions are simple and clear.  I don't think this has an outstanding fitness aspect to it, but I wasn't looking for a &#34;workout&#34; DVD.

1265721,A2CH6Q309ULPER,B002EWD0BS,Sdreprlcr,"[0, 0]","This DVD has excellent step by step instruction. I feel like I could do it with my eyes closed, just listening to the narration. I don't like this video as much as other prenatal yoga DVDs that I have been using, but I like it enough to keep it in the rotation. One thing that I find sort of distracting if you will, is that sometimes there is too much narration, and sometimes it is just a little too &#34;deep&#34; for me to fully incorporate into my mind! For example, the narrator says to isometrically do this or that to my feet, or energetically pull my feet towards each other, even though they are planted on the floor, or to breathe into my left lung, etc. I find myself wondering what exactly she means a lot of the time!
