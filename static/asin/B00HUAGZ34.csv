Script was disjointed with lots of gaping holes leaving events unexplained as we jumped from scene to scene. Even the ending felt like an incomplete mishmash. Cases in point; two important characters are murdered and we are shown nothing during or immediately after either event and only a little prior to one. To top it off two people are caught in the act of trying to kill a character and their punishment (also never shown) is to be deported. Sure! Not likely. Anyway, over acted; poorly directed; even more poorly written.In reference to Downton some may think that this film's changing the time period, locality and a few superficialities saves it from borrowing the Downton feel so I present an analogous situation of Apple's iPhone and/or iPad and Samsung's introduction of similar products a year or so later. Samsung's changing a few details does not excuse it from ripping off the Apple's novel and creative idea and design feel.

1691981,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00HUAGZ34,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[23, 29]","Author Frances Hodgson Burnett might best be known for her youth oriented tales such as ""Little Lord Fauntleroy,"" ""A Little Princess,"" and ""The Secret Garden."" I must admit, though, that I was intrigued to check out the stately period drama ""The Making of A Lady"" because it was based on one of her more adult endeavors (although I am not familiar with the source novel The Making of A Marchioness from 1911). This adaptation features gorgeous estates, show stopping costumes and an impressive cast including Lydia Wilson, Linus Roache, James D'Arcy and Joanna Lumley. And as the movie opens up, it promises to be an elegant British soap opera that will transport the viewer to another era. Before long, however, its intentions become a little less clear. Too rushed, even a bit too strange, the story gets progressively sillier as the minutes tick by and the entire production becomes a grand melodrama. With a distinct lack of humor or subtlety, though, (not to mention a distinctly racist bent--appropriate for the time perhaps, but still a bit disquieting) it's hard to take ""The Making of A Lady"" very seriously. What starts out simply enough descends into utter madness and chaos, and the abbreviated running time doesn't help the narrative develop in a natural manner.As the movie opens, we meet lovely Emily (Wilson). Emily is a slight, well mannered secretary who is coerced into marrying Lord Walderhurst (Roache). Neither is keen on the match, he even throws a hissy fit (albeit a extremely genteel one), but the arrangement will improve her social standing and give him the opportunity to produce an heir. The marriage is one of duty, of learning one's place, and is emphasized by scenes of uncomfortable disinterest. Just as you think you know where things are headed, though, we take a sudden veer into the bizarre. When Walderhurst's cousin arrives, things start to get more interesting. There are portents of evil and danger: from malaria, to an accident involving a horse, to the discovery of an abandoned cottage, to an impending storm. Every plot point is accentuated by a pounding dramatic soundtrack and overt proclamations from the players so we'll know exactly what's important down the line. And what's important? An Indian servant (cued in every scene by flute music) seems to portend the ultimate danger as the heavy handed screenplay starts to warn of the dangers posed by the exotic locals (here's where we get a bit racist).""The Making of A Lady"" is not particularly successful, but at least it's an interesting failure. Wilson really does give a fine performance, I just wish she had better material to work with. Lumley, as always, is a welcome sight but she disappears quickly enough. The production values are strong, as I mentioned, and this TV movie looks terrific. But what begins simply enough ends as a preposterous hodgepodge of random occurrences. I couldn't believe the way this concluded. Perhaps with more time, the story could have made the effort to make everything feel more organic. But the piece moves quickly, eschews all logic, and lays on the music and symbolism without mercy. Taking itself far too seriously, ""The Making of A Lady"" is not particularly fun. In itself, that's fine. Not everything has to be fun. But nor was it believable, and that combination is deadly. About 2 1/2 stars, I'll round up for Wilson and Lumley.

It starts out placidly enough. A demure and quietly pretty Emily (Lydia Wilson) hopes to secure a full-time position as secretary to a Lady Maria (Joanne Lumley). She is living in a poor rooming house, but manages to conduct herself with some class and style. Enough style and decorum to catch the eye of Lady Maria's widowed nephew, Lord James Walderhurst (Linus Roache), who needs a wife and heir. After disastrous episodes of meeting young women his aunt trots out for him, he asks Emily if she would consent to be his wife. Emily resists at first, saying she hopes to marry for love. What about security? he asks. Security is something, and the Lord promises to be easy to live with.After agreeing to a marriage of convenience which appears like it may grow into love, Lord James Walderhurst finds he must suddenly leave England to lead his regiment in India. Now the twists begin to twist. Some relatives arrive to the Lord's remote house ostensibly to look after Emily per the Lord's request. But do they have macabre motives? It's a bit Jane Eyreish and sinister Gothicness rolled into one which now flavors the story. These relatives are creepy.What keeps you watching, besides the fabulous rooms, fashions and actors, is Emily who has a quiet radiance and charm. You want to see her thrive and find happiness. All sorts of sinister events occur, and Emily appears to be in danger. If you enjoy melodramatic, Gothic little romps set in the late 1800's, this is a fun escape. It's a diverting 90 minutes of old-fashioned fun and fear.

1691984,A12DY8SIJI0WR9,B00HUAGZ34,Margery L. Goldstein,"[2, 4]","&#34;The Making if a Lady&#34; is a well-acted, visually handsome movie that manages to take a weak story and make it even weaker.I happened to read the rather obscure books this TV movie was based on, &#34;The Making of a Marchioness&#34; and &#34;The Methods of Lady Walderhurst&#34; by Frances Hodgson Burnett (best known as the author of &#34;The Secret Garden&#34;) when the Kindle edition was published.  The first was a rather touching rags-to-riches character study, something like Burnett's &#34;A Little Princess&#34; but about an adult woman instead of a child. The protagonist, Emily Fox-Seton, is well-educated and of a good family, with excellent manners and inexhaustible energy, but is kept from absolute destitution only by running errands for rich ladies. The book tracks her life up to the point when she marries her employer's wealthy but stodgy nephew, a much longer process than it seems in the TV movie (where it barely takes up the first 15 minutes). The book (only a slim novella) is actually a remarkably stark look at genteel female poverty in Victorian England.The second book, an unneeded sequel if ever there was one, takes up Emily's life after her marriage. It is a melodramatic thriller that traces how Emily's kindness to her new husband's heir and his Indian wife are repaid with deceit and attempted murder. It is  quite racist. In the end, Emily Fox-Seton manages to outwit the nefarious Asians  and produces her own son to inherit the estate.&#34;The Methods of Lady Walderhurst&#34; is a mediocre book, but the TV movie manages to be even worse by eliminating the strength of character that makes Emily Fox-Seton a heroine rather than a victim. In the book, she manages to elude her foes by outwitting them: she takes refuge with lowborn but loyal friends from her impoverished past and then relies on the 19th century stereotype of the hysterical female invalid to stay safe until her husband returns and her baby is born. It's a lot of hooey, but it is more original than the damsel-in-distress plot that the TV movie writers came up with.One final quibble: Frances Hodgson Burnett is very clear about the body type and personality of Emily Fox-Seton. She is a large-framed, shapely woman, rather cow-like actually, with a bovine air of serenity.

1691986,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00HUAGZ34,mirasreviews,"[5, 8]","""The Making of a Lady"" was made for British television in 2012, based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1901 novel ""The Making of a Marchioness."" Mrs. Burnett is more famous for her children's stories, including ""The Secret Garden"". This is a formulaic woman-in-peril plot. Emily Fox Seton (Lydia Wilson), a young woman of good birth but impoverished circumstances, works as a companion to Lady Maria Byrne (Joanna Lumley), a woman very conscious of the family's imperiled legacy if her widower nephew Lord James Walderhurst (Linus Roache) does not remarry and produce an heir. Though not the wife his aunt intended, Lord Walderhurst is taken with Jane and proposes that she marry him in a mutually beneficial arrangement. But Lord Walderhurst's cousin, the family's black sheep, Capt. Alec Osborn (James D'Arcy) is a deadly threat to everyone's plans.This is a completely typical 19th century woman-in-peril plot, involving a bright, intelligent, but poor young woman who marries well but finds evil lurking in the shadows of her dark, imposing country home. The paint-by-numbers plot is elevated by an excellent cast and deft direction, though. Lydia Wilson's Emily is lovely, practical, and sympathetic. James D'Arcy deserves the most credit for a genuinely threatening villain that makes even jaded 21st century audiences feel uneasy. The narrative revolves around these two characters, and the film's success depends upon their ability to suck the audience into their emotions in spite of the facts that Emily seems a bit slow on the uptake and we know how it will all turn out. These novels all turn out the same. Director Richard Curson Smith succeeds, with the help of a good script by Kate Brook and a perfect cast.",4,"Formulaic, but Elevated by Strong Direction and Cast.",1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,1719,"['Making', 'Lady', 'was', 'made', 'British', 'television', '2012', 'based', 'Frances', 'Hodgson', 'Burnett', '1901', 'novel', 'Making', 'Marchioness', 'Mrs.', 'Burnett', 'more', 'famous', 'children', 'stories', 'including', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'formulaic', 'woman-in-peril', 'plot', 'Emily', 'Fox', 'Seton', 'Lydia', 'Wilson', 'young', 'woman', 'good', 'birth', 'impoverished', 'circumstances', 'companion', 'Lady', 'Maria', 'Byrne', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'woman', 'very', 'conscious', 'family', 'imperiled', 'legacy', 'widower', 'nephew', 'Lord', 'James', 'Walderhurst', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'not', 'remarry', 'produce', 'heir', 'not', 'wife', 'aunt', 'intended', 'Lord', 'Walderhurst', 'taken', 'Jane', 'marry', 'mutually', 'beneficial', 'arrangement', 'Lord', 'Walderhurst', 'cousin', 'family', 'black', 'sheep', 'Capt', 'Alec', 'Osborn', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'deadly', 'threat', 'everyone', 'plans.This', 'completely', 'typical', '19th', 'century', 'woman-in-peril', 'plot', 'involving', 'bright', 'intelligent', 'poor', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'well', 'evil', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'dark', 'imposing', 'country', 'home', 'paint-by-numbers', 'plot', 'elevated', 'excellent', 'cast', 'deft', 'direction', 'though', 'Lydia', 'Wilson', 'Emily', 'lovely', 'practical', 'sympathetic', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'most', 'credit', 'genuinely', 'threatening', 'villain', 'even', 'jaded', '21st', 'century', 'audiences', 'feel', 'uneasy', 'narrative', 'revolves', 'two', 'characters', 'film', 'success', 'ability', 'suck', 'audience', 'emotions', 'spite', 'facts', 'Emily', 'bit', 'slow', 'uptake', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'all', 'turn', 'out', 'turn', 'out', 'same', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Curson', 'Smith', 'help', 'good', 'script', 'Kate', 'Brook', 'perfect', 'cast']",The Making of a Lady

Things seem headed toward a Cinderella ending when his lordship is recalled to his regiment in India, leaving his bride to the mercies of aloof servants and dastardly relatives.  As usual with British costume dramas, the production values and performances are first rate.  The problem with this show is its plot, a mash-up of elements of the modern Gothic romance and Victorian sensation novel.  The thoroughly predictable story, which flies along at a breakneck pace, is riddled with clich&eacute;s from both genres.  I saw this on PBS, so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD or Amazon's stream.

1691992,A2M936H1RSLS5Z,B00HUAGZ34,Steven Schafersman,"[6, 12]","This is an overwhelmingly Gothic tale of a British Army officer and lord who asks a young secretary to marry him the day after they first meet. She is lovely and intelligent and he is handsome, quiet, and wealthy. She agrees because she just lost her job and he promises her security and a quiet life. The officer's promises are initially true. This is all very strange but as the drama develops things become less secure and quiet.The new lady finds that she loves the officer, but does he love her? They finally consummate the marriage after some weeks, but he is called to India and suddenly leaves her. That's when his brother and his Indian wife move in. The lady asks her best friend to be her lady's maid and the brother's mother-in-law joins them. Strange and unexpected things happen. The lady finds that she is pregnant. The mother-in-law is preparing milk concoctions for the lady every night. Things happen to the house servants. The lady is obliged to enter a lake and release a horse attached to a carriage that has fallen into the lake. Her best friend begins to act strangely. The Indian mother-in-law keeps bringing the milk concoctions to the lady every night but she stops drinking them.Then events become more sinister and quickly reach their climax. The entire story seems rushed and foreshortened. Obviously 1:20 is not enough time to tell this story. That's the time of the movie as shown on PBS. Yes, the product details show a running time of 1:36 so perhaps I missed something, but that's typical of PBS, which needs the extra 10 minutes for commercials. So were 16 minutes really cut for the television broadcast? I assume they were.The acting was of course excellent and the made-for-drama music matched the scenes: happiness, uncertainty, malevolence, impending danger, etc. You didn't have to listen to the dialog or even watch the screen to know what was happening. This short Gothic melodrama was interesting but no Masterpiece Theater equal to the dramatized great classic novels we are familiar with from BBC that are given the time to tell their story. I enjoyed it but events moved too quickly. More time was needed for character development and for giving the viewer some time to reflect.

She does not marry for love, but simply because it seems like the smart thing to do, but she soon starts to have feelings for her new husband.  As soon as he leaves for India his brother and his brother's wife come to stay.  The script seems awfully chopped up as if too many scenes were removed.- Spoilers:  For example the brother in law somehow gets the new lady's maid in his clutches even though she kind of feared him.  She becomes loyal to him just as quickly and unexplainably as she decides to break that loyalty.  It's strange that her new husband would leave without really warning her about his brother since he clearly didn't trust him.  And yet when he finally returns home he doesn't seem to question the safety of Emily or the estate despite the fact that he obviously knew something about his brother's history.  Emily doesn't look more than 17 so I could believe it possible that in her lonliness she was too naive to distrust her guest. I myself grew up in a sheltered environment and I paid the price for that when I went into the real world at 18 and ended up trusting everyone...including people so obviously untrustworthy that most 9 year olds would've known better to stay away from.  But from her description of her growing up I wasn't sure her background was sheltered enough for her to be this way.  And it was hard to believe that after Alex manhandles her the way he does she still ends up allowing him to stay and trusting him.  Some of the staff members seem to be upfront with her enough to speak their mind at times, but they never tell her about Alex being a psychopath?  The feverish bouts that Alex suffers are never really explained.  Also I spent the better part of the movie believing that the guy's first wife was murdered by Alex and died under suspicious circumstances...but instead we find out that it was just a coincidence.
