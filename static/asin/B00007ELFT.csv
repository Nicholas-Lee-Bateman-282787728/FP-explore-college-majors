727721,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00007ELFT,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","According to Wikipedia, Naoma Ruth and Richard Wendorf were found by their daughter Jeni Wendorf on November 25, 1996, beaten to death in their Eustis home.While 49-year-old Richard Wendorf was asleep on his couch and Ruth was in the shower, Rod Ferrell and accomplice Scott Anderson entered the home through the unlocked garage, picking up the murder weapon. Before Richard had even awakened, Ferrell beat him multiple times with a crowbar, fracturing both his skull and ribs, almost instantly knocking him out, and killing him shortly thereafter. When Ruth had found Ferrell and Anderson in the home moments later, Ferrell bludgeoned her to death, bashing her head with the crowbar. He claimed in his confession, however, that in his original plan, he was going to allow Naoma Ruth to live, but she first attacked him by lunging at him and throwing a very hot cup of coffee on him, which angered him and made him change his mind and kill her also. Richard was found bearing burn marks in the shape of a V. It was said that the V was Rod's symbol, which he accompanied with a dot for each person he considered to be in his vampire cult.The murder's connection to White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade role-playing game was made by Calloway County prosecutor David Harrington.Harrington said the youths were involved in an ongoing role-playing game, but that Ferrell had begun to take the vampire game more seriously, scaring others into quitting. He referenced an incident in which Wendorf and his ""vampire clan"" mutilated puppies. ""The animal shelter thing was the first visible sign he had gone beyond game-playing,"" Harrington said.J. Gordon Olmstead-Dean, president of the Interactive Literature (IL) Foundation, disagreed.  The IL seeks to educate the public on the existence of Interactive Literature, including role-playing games.""Obviously, in the Wendorf case, the youths were at least familiar with the Vampire role-playing material.  The question that emerges is whether or not the material is responsible for their behavior.  Clearly, the idea is preposterous.  When five people commit a heinous criminal act and attribute it to fictional work which is read by hundreds of thousands of others, we have to decide whether it is the work or the individual that is to blame.  The youths in the Wendorf case exhibited extreme sociopathic behavior.  Vampire constitutes neither a reason or an excuse.  Whatever sad reasons may lie behind this crime, the youths identification with Vampire is incidental to the act, not contributory.  If we are to condemn every work of literature or art in Western civilization which has ever been perused by, or cited by, a criminal, we would have to condemn a great deal of our culture.""Which brings us to Vampire Clan. As a vampire movie, Vampie Clan is grainy, disjointed, and the leads occasionally flat.  But as a retelling of true events it transforms into a fascinating study of cult politics. Rod Ferrell (Drew Fuller) believes he is a 500 year-old vampire named Vesago. Raised by his mother, who espoused the same vampiric beliefs, he is alternately magnetic and tortured.  Ferrell is a believable vampire in the modern sense, embracing the extreme goth culture and drinking his clan's blood.  There's not a fang in sight.Following Ferrell's whims are his coterie of babes, glammed up in the film to make them easier on the eyes.  Charity Lynn Keesee (Alex Breckenridge) and Dana Lynn Cooper (Marina Black) are the core of the cult, with Howard Scott Anderson (Timothy Lee DePriest) the muscle. When one of the girls turns out to be pregnant, the film implies that Ferrell is looking to replace her with fresh blood (pun intended) in the form of Heather Wendorff (Kelly Kruger). Heather is an easy target -- she supposedly hates her family and is planning on running away with the clan.Unfortunately, we're not entirely sure as to why Ferrell wants to kill Heather's parents.  There's some hints that it might be as much a robbery as it is a thrill kill.  When the Clan relays the news to Heather, none of the cult seems interested in implicating her in what was supposedly a spiritual triumph.  Indeed, Heather's life before she joined the Clan is inscrutable because we learn so little.  Vampire Clan makes it clear that Heather is innocent; reality is not so clear cut.At times the film is disjointed, flashing back and forth between timelines.  Part of the reason Vampire Clan isn't always engaging is because it attempts to reconstruct true events, which are often less exciting than typical Hollywood drama.  But perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the film is there's nary a reference to role-playing games.  For a movie attempting to recreate the facts of a horrible crime, that's exactly how it should be.",3,Nary a fang or RPG in sight,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,4765,"['According', 'Wikipedia', 'Naoma', 'Ruth', 'Richard', 'Wendorf', 'were', 'found', 'daughter', 'Jeni', 'Wendorf', 'November', '25', '1996', 'beaten', 'death', 'Eustis', '49-year-old', 'Richard', 'Wendorf', 'was', 'asleep', 'couch', 'Ruth', 'was', 'shower', 'Rod', 'Ferrell', 'accomplice', 'Scott', 'Anderson', 'entered', 'home', 'unlocked', 'garage', 'picking', 'up', 'murder', 'weapon', 'Richard', 'had', 'even', 'awakened', 'Ferrell', 'beat', 'multiple', 'times', 'crowbar', 'fracturing', 'skull', 'ribs', 'almost', 'instantly', 'knocking', 'killing', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'When', 'Ruth', 'had', 'found', 'Ferrell', 'Anderson', 'home', 'moments', 'later', 'Ferrell', 'bludgeoned', 'death', 'bashing', 'head', 'crowbar', 'claimed', 'confession', 'however', 'original', 'plan', 'was', 'going', 'allow', 'Naoma', 'Ruth', 'live', 'first', 'attacked', 'lunging', 'throwing', 'very', 'hot', 'cup', 'coffee', 'angered', 'made', 'change', 'mind', 'kill', 'also', 'Richard', 'was', 'found', 'bearing', 'burn', 'marks', 'shape', 'V.', 'was', 'said', 'V', 'was', 'Rod', 'symbol', 'accompanied', 'dot', 'person', 'considered', 'be', 'vampire', 'cult.The', 'murder', 'connection', 'White', 'Wolf', 'Vampire', 'Masquerade', 'role-playing', 'game', 'was', 'made', 'Calloway', 'County', 'prosecutor', 'David', 'Harrington.Harrington', 'said', 'youths', 'were', 'involved', 'ongoing', 'role-playing', 'game', 'Ferrell', 'had', 'begun', 'take', 'vampire', 'game', 'more', 'seriously', 'scaring', 'others', 'quitting', 'referenced', 'incident', 'Wendorf', 'vampire', 'clan', 'mutilated', 'puppies', 'animal', 'shelter', 'thing', 'was', 'first', 'visible', 'sign', 'had', 'gone', 'game-playing', 'Harrington', 'said.J', 'Gordon', 'Olmstead-Dean', 'president', 'Interactive', 'Literature', 'IL', 'Foundation', 'disagreed', 'IL', 'educate', 'public', 'existence', 'Interactive', 'Literature', 'including', 'role-playing', 'games', 'Obviously', 'Wendorf', 'case', 'youths', 'were', 'least', 'familiar', 'Vampire', 'role-playing', 'material', 'question', 'not', 'material', 'responsible', 'behavior', 'Clearly', 'idea', 'preposterous', 'When', 'five', 'people', 'commit', 'heinous', 'criminal', 'act', 'attribute', 'fictional', 'work', 'read', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'others', 'have', 'decide', 'work', 'individual', 'blame', 'youths', 'Wendorf', 'case', 'exhibited', 'extreme', 'sociopathic', 'behavior', 'Vampire', 'reason', 'excuse', 'sad', 'reasons', 'may', 'lie', 'crime', 'youths', 'identification', 'Vampire', 'incidental', 'act', 'not', 'contributory', 'are', 'condemn', 'work', 'literature', 'art', 'Western', 'civilization', 'ever', 'been', 'perused', 'cited', 'criminal', 'would', 'have', 'condemn', 'great', 'deal', 'culture', 'Which', 'Vampire', 'Clan', 'vampire', 'movie', 'Vampie', 'Clan', 'grainy', 'disjointed', 'leads', 'occasionally', 'flat', 'retelling', 'true', 'events', 'fascinating', 'study', 'cult', 'politics', 'Rod', 'Ferrell', 'Drew', 'Fuller', '500', 'year-old', 'vampire', 'named', 'Vesago', 'Raised', 'mother', 'who', 'espoused', 'same', 'vampiric', 'beliefs', 'alternately', 'magnetic', 'tortured', 'Ferrell', 'believable', 'vampire', 'modern', 'sense', 'embracing', 'extreme', 'goth', 'culture', 'drinking', 'clan', 'blood', 'not', 'fang', 'sight.Following', 'Ferrell', 'whims', 'are', 'coterie', 'babes', 'glammed', 'up', 'film', 'make', 'easier', 'eyes', 'Charity', 'Lynn', 'Keesee', 'Alex', 'Breckenridge', 'Dana', 'Lynn', 'Cooper', 'Marina', 'Black', 'are', 'core', 'cult', 'Howard', 'Scott', 'Anderson', 'Timothy', 'Lee', 'DePriest', 'muscle', 'When', 'one', 'girls', 'out', 'be', 'pregnant', 'film', 'implies', 'Ferrell', 'looking', 'replace', 'fresh', 'blood', 'pun', 'intended', 'form', 'Heather', 'Wendorff', 'Kelly', 'Kruger', 'Heather', 'easy', 'target', 'supposedly', 'family', 'planning', 'running', 'away', 'clan.Unfortunately', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'Ferrell', 'kill', 'Heather', 'parents', 'hints', 'might', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'robbery', 'thrill', 'kill', 'When', 'Clan', 'news', 'Heather', 'none', 'cult', 'interested', 'implicating', 'what', 'was', 'supposedly', 'spiritual', 'triumph', 'Indeed', 'Heather', 'life', 'joined', 'Clan', 'inscrutable', 'learn', 'so', 'little', 'Vampire', 'Clan', 'clear', 'Heather', 'innocent', 'reality', 'not', 'so', 'clear', 'cut.At', 'film', 'disjointed', 'flashing', 'back', 'forth', 'timelines', 'Part', 'reason', 'Vampire', 'Clan', ""n't"", 'always', 'engaging', 'reconstruct', 'true', 'events', 'are', 'often', 'less', 'exciting', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'drama', 'perhaps', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'aspect', 'film', 'nary', 'reference', 'role-playing', 'games', 'movie', 'attempting', 'recreate', 'facts', 'horrible', 'crime', 'exactly', 'how', 'should', 'be']",Vampire Clan

I don't remember hearing about the murders especially given the nature of the murders beliefs and the brutality of the killings. The story is based on a husband and wives murder in Florida in 1996, but as we all know we don't know how many liberties were taken in telling THIS TRUE STORY??? There were two surviving daughters of the attacks with one at her night job and the other running away from home the night of the killings.The acting, direction and story are all average with the only stand out being the nature of the killers mind set. BEWARE the audio was all over the place from loud to whisper quite with an almost constant manipulation volume control so I could hear the voices. The kill scenes were mostly left up to the viewers imagination to fill in the visuals and the gore was kept to a minimum except for blood covered bodies. There was no blood cast off or splatter to be seen during the attacks or after the killings. There is a fair amout of cursing including the F-word and a shower scene that was obscured eliminating any nude scenes.If you like watching true crime movies, but have seen all the good ones then this can fill void when you're bored and run out of options and aren't in the mood to clean house or do yard work. or you can do them all at the same time. 3 average stars.",3,THE TRUE STORY OF THE AVERAGE VAMP KILLER CLAN,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,1360,"['was', 'ok', 'movie', 'noting', 'write', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'hearing', 'murders', 'especially', 'given', 'nature', 'murders', 'beliefs', 'brutality', 'killings', 'story', 'based', 'husband', 'wives', 'murder', 'Florida', '1996', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'telling', 'THIS', 'TRUE', 'STORY', 'were', 'two', 'surviving', 'daughters', 'attacks', 'one', 'night', 'job', 'other', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'night', 'killings.The', 'acting', 'direction', 'story', 'are', 'average', 'only', 'stand', 'being', 'nature', 'killers', 'mind', 'set', 'audio', 'was', 'place', 'loud', 'whisper', 'quite', 'almost', 'constant', 'manipulation', 'volume', 'control', 'could', 'hear', 'voices', 'kill', 'scenes', 'were', 'mostly', 'left', 'up', 'viewers', 'imagination', 'fill', 'visuals', 'gore', 'was', 'kept', 'minimum', 'blood', 'covered', 'bodies', 'was', 'blood', 'cast', 'off', 'splatter', 'be', 'seen', 'attacks', 'killings', 'fair', 'amout', 'cursing', 'including', 'F-word', 'shower', 'scene', 'was', 'obscured', 'eliminating', 'nude', 'scenes.If', 'watching', 'true', 'crime', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'good', 'ones', 'then', 'can', 'fill', 'void', 'when', ""'re"", 'bored', 'run', 'options', 'are', ""n't"", 'mood', 'clean', 'house', 'do', 'yard', 'work', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'time', '3', 'average', 'stars']",Vampire Clan

The best acting came from Drew Fuller, (Voodoo Academy) who played the lead role as the leader of this gang of twisted kids.  He had the look and sound of a twisted genious down and was very well cast in the role.  The remainder of the cast ranged from ok to blahhhhzay, again making Fuller's performance stand out.  The movie takes you back and forth, starting with the arrest of the gang members and working out all the details throughout the movie.

727726,A38AXXL7DMVFMQ,B00007ELFT,"Vicente Drago ""Shaun O'Donnell""","[5, 7]","A recent trend in the direct to video world seems to be the criminals of the past who hit natonal news. There was Ed Gein which was a weird film and was a little boring at times. Then came Dahmer, and lets just say that the focus was not on his criminal life, but his sex life (literally). Now we have the Vampire Clan which focus on the vampire slayings that took place in the early 90's where the Teenager Rod murdered the parents of this girl he was picking up. Now the main reason this got so much attention (besides the blatetent brutality) was that they claimed to be vampires. Now this movie which is based on the story, was only alright as the story is explained by Rod (The LEader) and Heather (the victims Daughter). The movie sufferd from lack of focus. It tries to follow the explits but with the exception of the actual murder scene (and even then) the movie is done in weird moments that focus on the group but in lack of detail. In fact they try to make it seem like Rod actually has mistical and or hypnotic powers thus he controls the group as well as sweet talk some people he bumps into. However on more technical there were moments where the dialouge went a little to soft thus making it sound like the boom was off at moments and or poor editing (that or my player is in trouble).Overall this is another example of a true tory taht was made into a so-so movie that results in a 90 minute rental.
