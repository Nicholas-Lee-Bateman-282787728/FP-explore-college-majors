656718,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JPSM,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 4]","'No Reservations' is a low-key romance with a lot of heart.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Kate, a head chef of a fancy restaurant who's a serious perfectionist to the letter.  (She even confronts customers who complain.)  When her sister and Zoe (Abigail Breslin), her neice, come to visit, a terrible car accident leaves her sister dead and Zoe an emotional wreck.  Taking time off, her quietly assertive owner/manager (Patricia Clarkson, 'Lars and the Real Girl') replaces her with a temp, a skillful and freewheelin' sous chef, Nich Palmer (Eckhart).  Holding her career dear, Kate must come to terms with her newfound responsibilities raising Zoe while keeping her job and making new discoveries as Nich helps her to lighten up and discover how the other half lives.  An exuberant lunatic, he plays the kitchen like a conductor of the arias he's so fond of.  Beautiful music and Nick's heartfelt love for Italian culture give the film the proper ambiance it needs.Taking familiar dramatic ingredients, the characters and timing are all combined to make a truly palatable viewing experience.  Engaging performances by Zeta-Jones, Eckhart, Clarkson, and Breslin give this romantic dramedy the right touches.  Catherine Zeta-Jones won my heart for her performance, and Aaron Eckhart, whose multi-faceted acting ability has been best as the villain, proves he's a worthy romantic lead.  (I was one of the few who wasn't impressed with 'Conversation(s) With Other Women' even though I liked his dour performance as ""the guy"" with Helena Bonham Carter.)  Carol Fuch's winsome screenplay (based on 'Mostly Martha' by screenwriter, Sandra Nettelbeck) sets the right mood, taking the movie through courses of comedy and seriousness with nearly flawless timing. Very light, romantic, and engaging.",4,A Revitalized Romantic Recipe,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,1789,"[""'No"", 'Reservations', 'low-key', 'romance', 'lot', 'heart', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'plays', 'Kate', 'head', 'chef', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'who', 'serious', 'perfectionist', 'letter', 'even', 'customers', 'who', 'complain', 'When', 'sister', 'Zoe', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'neice', 'come', 'visit', 'terrible', 'car', 'accident', 'sister', 'dead', 'Zoe', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'Taking', 'time', 'off', 'quietly', 'assertive', 'owner/manager', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', ""'Lars"", 'Real', 'Girl', 'temp', 'skillful', 'freewheelin', 'sous', 'chef', 'Nich', 'Palmer', 'Eckhart', 'Holding', 'career', 'dear', 'Kate', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'newfound', 'responsibilities', 'raising', 'Zoe', 'keeping', 'job', 'making', 'new', 'discoveries', 'Nich', 'lighten', 'up', 'discover', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'lives', 'exuberant', 'lunatic', 'kitchen', 'conductor', 'arias', 'so', 'fond', 'Beautiful', 'music', 'Nick', 'heartfelt', 'love', 'Italian', 'culture', 'give', 'film', 'proper', 'ambiance', 'needs.Taking', 'familiar', 'dramatic', 'ingredients', 'characters', 'timing', 'are', 'combined', 'make', 'truly', 'palatable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Engaging', 'performances', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Eckhart', 'Clarkson', 'Breslin', 'give', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'right', 'touches', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'won', 'heart', 'performance', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'multi-faceted', 'acting', 'ability', 'been', 'best', 'villain', 'worthy', 'romantic', 'lead', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', ""'Conversation"", 's', 'Other', 'Women', 'even', 'liked', 'dour', 'performance', 'guy', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Carol', 'Fuch', 'winsome', 'screenplay', 'based', ""'Mostly"", 'Martha', 'screenwriter', 'Sandra', 'Nettelbeck', 'right', 'mood', 'taking', 'movie', 'courses', 'comedy', 'seriousness', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'timing', 'Very', 'light', 'romantic', 'engaging']",N/A
656719,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JPSM,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","This space is usually reserved for reviews of serious political and historical works, various past trends in film and music or the like. Every once in a while, however, this reviewer comes across a quirky little item that requires some commentary. The film ""The Waitress"" about the follies and foibles of a pie-crazed mama -to-be was one such effort and the film under review, also centered on food, ""No Reservations"" is another. Maybe that is the key to my interest: the question of food; its necessity preparation for survival and those who are devoted to presenting it in its best light. Or maybe it is that although my members of my household, my friends and other whom I know well are aghast at the proliferation of ""reality"" television productions they are, to a person, wedded to some reality show called ""Top Chef"". Go figure.In any case that last sentence can serve as an introduction to the story line here. Of course, with any essentially light-hearted cinematic look at the follies and foibles of a top flight chef, in this case a female one played by the fetching Catherine Zeta-Jones, outside the kitchen there has to be some romantic element. Here the boy meets girl line is completed by a new sous-chef played here by Aaron Eckhart. That too figures, although not always, as here, in New York and not always in an upscale restaurant. In short order this pair prove that too many chefs can spoil the pot. Throw in a little imp of a niece who is thrown Zeta-Jones' way after the tragic and traumatic death in an automobile accident of her sister and you have a nice little stew. Working through Zeta-Jones' love life and her new responsibilities to the niece drives the film (with a little assist from an apparently necessary tool for every New York chef- a witty ""shrink"").  If food is your thing, and even if it is not, this is a nice little piece of fluff to while away a couple of hours.

656734,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPSM,Chris Pandolfi,"[35, 42]","There's a light, good-hearted nature to ""No Reservations"" that's quite pleasing, if a little predictable. This is just as much a story of life as it is a story of romance, and we all know the formulas such films follow: a person's world is rearranged when someone new enters his or her life, and the laughter, tears, and conflict will be plentiful. I expected nothing less from ""No Reservations,"" which is probably why I was able to enjoy it. This is a charming, funny, touching film that casts away any qualms about being formulaic, which is a good thing for anyone in need of romantic escapism. I don't dare question how realistic the events of the film are; this is not a film that bothers with realism, but rather with the idealism that life is supposed to work in a specific way. At times, it's a welcome diversion.The plot concerns Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the executive chef of an upscale New York restaurant. We immediately get the sense that hers is a very organized, controlled world; while not explicitly critical or demeaning, she is fiercely protective of what she's worked so hard for, namely her position at the restaurant. Here's a person that's strong on the outside but deeply insecure on the inside, exemplified by her inability to receive criticism (never complain about the food she prepares; you'll definitely regret it). For these reasons, she's ordered into therapy. She pretty much dominates her own sessions with incessant discussions on food preparation--appetizing, yes, but not exactly enlightening. Her therapist (Bob Balaban) is initially unable to ask any questions or give any advice. Clearly, she's afraid to let anyone examine her personal life.Her world is turned upside down when her sister dies in a car accident, leaving behind a daughter, Zoe (Abigail Breslin). Because there's no father in the picture, Kate is now faced with the responsibility of caring for her. But will she know what to do? A child has never been a part of her life; being a chef is the only life she's ever known. She knows virtually nothing about Zoe, not even her favorite color. Furthermore, Zoe has lost her mother, meaning she'll need the extra emotional support Kate may not be able to give. It will be an adjustment, and a tough one at that; not only is Zoe unwilling to eat, she's also unwilling to let Kate get close.In this regard, she takes right after her aunt, whose defensiveness runs on high after a new chef is hired. Nick (Aaron Eckhart) is a man with a bright, free-spirited approach to cooking: he listens to opera; he actively engages the other chefs; he's charming and witty. Kate finds him threatening, and initially treats him as such by being cold, critical, and distant. But when she decides to bring Zoe to work with her one night, she notices how well Zoe and Nick get along. He even gets her to eat. Thus begins a strained friendship that the audience knows will progress into something more. Of course, that's exactly what the audience hopes will happen. Quite simply, Nick is fun to be around and Kate is not; their coming together allows her to lighten up and let someone in emotionally.As the film progresses, the relationship between Kate, Zoe, and Nick develops, not necessarily as it would for a family, but rather as it would for a group of friends. I never once thought that Zoe would ever see Nick and Kate as parental figures, which is just as mature on Zoe's part as it is sad. Likewise, I never once thought that Kate saw herself as a mother, despite her growing love for Zoe. The dynamic between these three characters is complex, especially when a number of other conflicts are introduced. For one thing, Zoe fragile state causes problems at school. It also threatens to ruin everything Kate has tried to accomplish. Both are trying, but it's clear that a lot of emotional baggage remains.Herein lies the film's major weakness: most of Kate's emotional baggage is undefined. We do get a couple of brief mentions, such as her mother's passion for cooking and her father's absence from her life. But none of this is properly developed, and that made her controlling behavior seem less understandable and more uncalled for. Still, I was taken by the dramatic tension between her and Nick; watching an uptight person letting their guard down is both entertaining and uplifting. And I was definitely moved by her attempts with Zoe, who's just begging to be hugged and soothed and reassured that everything would be all right. There's a moment when she watches home video of her mother; Kate sneaks in, sits down, and holds Zoe tightly. You can practically see the emotion dripping off the screen, which is probably why it's effective.Equally as effective is the growing love between Kate and Nick--a love that can go in any direction but ultimately treads the expected path. I've seen enough cinematic romances to understand that this is appropriate, maybe even necessary. ""No Reservations"" is the kind of film we occasionally want to see, if not for plausibility, then for the satisfaction of temporarily disappearing into a fantasy. It plays on our personal desires, namely those of happiness and well being in the midst of a crazy world. At one point, Kate says, ""I wish there was a cookbook for life""; I found this clever, despite the overuse of the basic message. If it's possible for me to appreciate this kind of dialogue--or even a film with this kind of dialogue--then I think it's safe to assume that it's possible for you, too.",4,A Recipe for

656735,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B00005JPSM,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[21, 50]","The idea of having two characters come together despite their obvious personality conflicts is as old as the silver screen itself. However, with the help of a strong, intelligent script the familiar can be overlooked and the situation can seem fresh. ""Something New"" is a prime, recent example of this story done right. ""No Reservations"", on the other hand, misses the mark as it is familiar to a fault. The script exists sans edge or excitement, and we know exactly where it is going every step of the way. Catherine Zeta Jones plays Kate, the type of woman I work very hard to avoid in my daily life, she is driven, righteous, and anal retentive. To her, that mean, nasty disposition is just a byproduct of being one of the most respected chefs in all of Manhattan. She has no time for love or fun or life because, by golly, she needs to perfect her safran sauce and quail (gag me). But since she is stuck in a Hollywood movie her life must throw her a curveball, in this case it comes in the form of a car crash which kills her sister and saddles her with her 9 year old niece Zoe.So will Zoe soften Kate's outlook on life, showing her that there is more to it than careerism for the sake of careerism? Will Kate find some ideal studmuffin who will teach her the virtue of love? Let's just say that this film never met a risk worth taking. Said ideal studmuffin is played by Aaron Eckhart who steals the movie and provides enough charm to almost make the whole experience worthwhile. Catherine Zeta Jones, not nearly as young or pretty as her publicist has led her to believe, sleepwalks through the movie giving me further proof that ""Chicago"" will forever stand as her one good performance. I liked the scenes with Kate and Zoe because while they were lightweight they were also spiked with realism. Kate is so clueless that she serves Zoe fish for dinner, complete with eyeballs. I'm sure she saw this as perfectly acceptable because if it is good enough for her fans on Bleeker Street then it must be good enough for anybody. But for most of the film we are left to stare at dead air as pretty yet pretty uninteresting characters pat themselves on the back over what good cooks they are.After ""Waitress"" and ""Ratatouille"" earlier this summer this is the third film that caters to food snobs. Which is fine, they are trendy nowadays and all, but we can hardly call these movies realistic portraits of the restaurant business. Hairnets don't mesh well with movie stars so they just go without. I've also never worked in a restaurant where the whole staff gets together and eats a meal together before work as though they are some sort of family. Maybe it exists but it is not the norm. At least ""Waiting..."", crude as it was, kept it real. Meanwhile my hobby, film snobbery, is nothing more than a joke to film producers. In the past five years the only two movies to touch it have been ""Cinemania"" (great, great movie) and ""Film Geek"", both which showed my people in the most unflattering light imaginable. But that aside, this film is far too predictable for its own good. Providing fairy tales to the people is what movies do best, but here they couldn't even be bothered to mildly tweak an old one. **3/4",3,Another Love Letter to Food Snobs,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,3213,"['idea', 'having', 'two', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'obvious', 'personality', 'conflicts', 'as', 'old', 'silver', 'screen', 'However', 'help', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'script', 'familiar', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'situation', 'can', 'seem', 'fresh', 'Something', 'New', 'prime', 'recent', 'example', 'story', 'done', 'right', 'Reservations', 'other', 'hand', 'mark', 'familiar', 'fault', 'script', 'sans', 'edge', 'excitement', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'going', 'step', 'way', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'plays', 'Kate', 'type', 'woman', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'avoid', 'daily', 'life', 'driven', 'righteous', 'anal', 'retentive', 'mean', 'nasty', 'disposition', 'just', 'byproduct', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'respected', 'chefs', 'Manhattan', 'time', 'love', 'fun', 'life', 'golly', 'perfect', 'safran', 'sauce', 'quail', 'gag', 'stuck', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'life', 'must', 'throw', 'curveball', 'case', 'form', 'car', 'crash', 'sister', '9', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'Zoe.So', 'will', 'Zoe', 'soften', 'Kate', 'outlook', 'life', 'showing', 'more', 'careerism', 'sake', 'careerism', 'Will', 'Kate', 'find', 'ideal', 'studmuffin', 'who', 'will', 'teach', 'virtue', 'love', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'never', 'met', 'risk', 'worth', 'taking', 'Said', 'ideal', 'studmuffin', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'movie', 'enough', 'charm', 'almost', 'make', 'whole', 'experience', 'worthwhile', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'not', 'nearly', 'young', 'pretty', 'publicist', 'led', 'believe', 'sleepwalks', 'movie', 'giving', 'further', 'proof', 'Chicago', 'will', 'forever', 'stand', 'one', 'good', 'performance', 'liked', 'scenes', 'Kate', 'Zoe', 'were', 'lightweight', 'were', 'also', 'spiked', 'realism', 'Kate', 'so', 'clueless', 'Zoe', 'fish', 'dinner', 'complete', 'eyeballs', ""'m"", 'sure', 'saw', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'good', 'enough', 'fans', 'Bleeker', 'Street', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'anybody', 'most', 'film', 'are', 'left', 'stare', 'dead', 'air', 'pretty', 'yet', 'pretty', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'pat', 'back', 'what', 'good', 'cooks', 'are.After', 'Waitress', 'Ratatouille', 'earlier', 'summer', 'third', 'film', 'food', 'snobs', 'Which', 'fine', 'are', 'trendy', 'nowadays', 'can', 'hardly', 'call', 'movies', 'realistic', 'portraits', 'restaurant', 'business', 'Hairnets', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'movie', 'stars', 'just', 'go', ""'ve"", 'also', 'never', 'worked', 'restaurant', 'where', 'whole', 'staff', 'together', 'eats', 'meal', 'together', 'before', 'work', 'are', 'sort', 'family', 'Maybe', 'not', 'norm', 'least', 'Waiting', 'crude', 'was', 'kept', 'real', 'Meanwhile', 'hobby', 'film', 'snobbery', 'nothing', 'more', 'joke', 'film', 'producers', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'touch', 'have', 'been', 'Cinemania', 'great', 'great', 'movie', 'Film', 'Geek', 'showed', 'people', 'most', 'unflattering', 'light', 'imaginable', 'aside', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'own', 'good', 'Providing', 'fairy', 'tales', 'people', 'what', 'movies', 'do', 'best', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'bothered', 'mildly', 'tweak', 'old', 'one', '**3/4']",N/A

656738,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,B00005JPSM,Classic Movie watcher,"[1, 1]","One might feel a bit disppointed if food and cooking are what they primarily look for in the film. Surprisingly, the film is more about the blossoming relations between the workalcholic Kate (Catherine Zeta Jones), Zoe (Abigal Breslin) and the upcoming Italian chef Nick (Aaron Eckhart). The scene stealer is Zoe. She is beautiful, young and a natural. Her mourning over her loss of her mom, pillow fight with aunt Kate, making pizza with Nick and her being tempted by Nick's homemade spaghetti were all shot wonderfully. Her tiny and intelligent face spoke it all. Catherine Zeta Jones was gorgeous but she didn't look like a top French Head Chef at 22 Bleecker. She, however, looks perfect as a loving aunt, an overworked career woman and will make any man fall for her. Aaron Eckhart is so convincing as a popular and passionate chef. No wonder people inside and outside the kitchen love him.This film is so well-knit (perhaps because the German film Mostly Martha is such a success) that it is a delight to watch. I love the New York streets, the old apartment, staircase and natural lit corridor at Kate's apartment. The supporting cast look more French and in the restaurant business than Kate - the restaurant owner Paula (Patricia Clarkson), Kate's right hand chef Leah (Jenny Wade). Zoe's mom (Arija Bareikis, American Embassy) and Zoe actually have such similar facial features. She looks like a French Chef too. Having said that, Catherine Zeta Jones looks good in this role but this time (unlike Chicago) she cannot transform it into an exclusive Catherine Zeta Jones role only. Her therapist(Bob Balaban), with his quiet voice and rooftop clinic overlooking New York buildings, is fun to watch.A warm, beautifully shot and well cast movie.

656751,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JPSM,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Despite what I recall of the advertising campaign last year, this soft-hearted 2007 film is far less a Food Network-derived romantic comedy than a Lifetime-oriented drama about grief and work/life balance. Directed by Scott Hicks (Shine) and written by first-timer Carol Fuchs, this film offers the most insightful peek into the workings of an upscale Manhattan restaurant since 2000'sDinner Rush(i.e., if you don't count last year's CGI-generated, French food-fest,Ratatouille), but it also seems intent in splintering the story between the romantic sparks between the co-stars and the unexpected relationship that a single aunt forms with her orphaned niece. The result is heartwarming but rather diluted considering the potential inherent in the material presented. Hicks and Fuchs also seem intent on inserting predictable clich&eacute;s along the way to reinforce the formulaic approach taken with the story.Basically a remake of the 2001 German comedy,Mostly Martha, the plot centers on perfectionist chef Kate who runs a tightly efficient kitchen in a chic SoHo bistro. As a resolute overachiever, she is able to get up before dawn to get to the fish market and stay late at the restaurant making her impeccably presented dishes until closing. So tightly wound is Kate that restaurant owner Paula forces her to see a therapist to address her supposedly difficult personality. This is the first of several disconnects I had with the film as Kate strikes me as demanding but not particularly abusive to her staff. Regardless, her life is turned upside down by the sudden death of her sister and the addition of her niece Zoe to her structured life. As if that wasn't enough, Paula has hired Nick, a rowdy opera-loving sous-chef, to partner with Kate as she struggles with her personal transition at home. Taking a number from the Tracy-Hepburn manual for romantic comedy, tempers flare as do sparks. Zoe's recovery from her mother's death becomes a complicating factor, but the rest of the story plays out basically how you would presume.More interesting in edgier, less sympathetic roles, Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the icier aspects of her role well, but she is markedly less arresting when her character turns warm and gooey. The script also doesn't really respect her character much since she is made to look overly foolish and insensitive in her early scenes as a struggling mother figure. Aaron Eckhart seems to be playing more of a plot device as Nick, but he does it well, and the requisite sparks occur with Zeta-Jones. Cornering the market on playing put-upon children, Abigail Breslin is fine as Zoe, even though she has to be glumly depressed for much of the film. The usually more dimensional Patricia Clarkson plays Paula as a surprisingly brittle, opportunistic character, while Bob Balaban isn't given much to do at all as Kate's therapist but act as a bromide. Stuart Dryburgh's autumnal cinematography makes all the food look good, the stars as well, and minimalist composer Philip Glass, of all people, provided the unobtrusive soundtrack dominated by Puccini, Verdi, and Flotow arias. The most significant bonus item on the 2008 DVD is a twenty-minute episode of the Food Network'sUnwrappedwhich includes interviews with the film's stars and the real chefs who concocted the dishes in the movie.",3,Lugubrious Hybrid of the Food Network and Lifetime Makes for an Attractive But Bland Movie,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,3320,"['what', 'recall', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'last', 'year', 'soft-hearted', '2007', 'film', 'far', 'less', 'Food', 'Network-derived', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Lifetime-oriented', 'drama', 'grief', 'work/life', 'balance', 'Directed', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'Shine', 'written', 'first-timer', 'Carol', 'Fuchs', 'film', 'most', 'insightful', 'peek', 'workings', 'upscale', 'Manhattan', 'restaurant', ""2000'sDinner"", 'Rush', 'i.e.', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'last', 'year', 'CGI-generated', 'French', 'food-fest', 'Ratatouille', 'also', 'intent', 'splintering', 'story', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'co-stars', 'unexpected', 'relationship', 'single', 'aunt', 'forms', 'orphaned', 'niece', 'result', 'heartwarming', 'rather', 'diluted', 'considering', 'potential', 'inherent', 'material', 'presented', 'Hicks', 'Fuchs', 'also', 'seem', 'intent', 'inserting', 'predictable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'way', 'reinforce', 'formulaic', 'approach', 'taken', 'story.Basically', 'remake', '2001', 'German', 'comedy', 'Mostly', 'Martha', 'plot', 'centers', 'perfectionist', 'chef', 'Kate', 'who', 'tightly', 'efficient', 'kitchen', 'chic', 'SoHo', 'bistro', 'resolute', 'overachiever', 'able', 'get', 'up', 'before', 'dawn', 'get', 'fish', 'market', 'stay', 'late', 'restaurant', 'making', 'impeccably', 'presented', 'dishes', 'closing', 'So', 'tightly', 'wound', 'Kate', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Paula', 'see', 'therapist', 'address', 'supposedly', 'difficult', 'personality', 'first', 'several', 'disconnects', 'had', 'film', 'Kate', 'demanding', 'not', 'particularly', 'abusive', 'staff', 'Regardless', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'sudden', 'death', 'sister', 'addition', 'niece', 'Zoe', 'structured', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Paula', 'hired', 'Nick', 'rowdy', 'opera-loving', 'sous-chef', 'partner', 'Kate', 'personal', 'transition', 'home', 'Taking', 'number', 'Tracy-Hepburn', 'manual', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'tempers', 'flare', 'do', 'sparks', 'Zoe', 'recovery', 'mother', 'death', 'complicating', 'factor', 'rest', 'story', 'out', 'basically', 'how', 'would', 'presume.More', 'interesting', 'edgier', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'roles', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'icier', 'aspects', 'role', 'well', 'markedly', 'less', 'arresting', 'when', 'character', 'warm', 'gooey', 'script', 'also', ""n't"", 'really', 'respect', 'character', 'much', 'made', 'look', 'overly', 'foolish', 'insensitive', 'early', 'scenes', 'struggling', 'mother', 'figure', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'be', 'playing', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'Nick', 'well', 'requisite', 'sparks', 'occur', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Cornering', 'market', 'playing', 'put-upon', 'children', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'fine', 'Zoe', 'even', 'be', 'glumly', 'depressed', 'much', 'film', 'usually', 'more', 'dimensional', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Paula', 'surprisingly', 'brittle', 'opportunistic', 'character', 'Bob', 'Balaban', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'Kate', 'therapist', 'act', 'bromide', 'Stuart', 'Dryburgh', 'autumnal', 'cinematography', 'food', 'look', 'good', 'stars', 'well', 'minimalist', 'composer', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'people', 'provided', 'unobtrusive', 'soundtrack', 'dominated', 'Puccini', 'Verdi', 'Flotow', 'arias', 'most', 'significant', 'bonus', 'item', '2008', 'DVD', 'twenty-minute', 'episode', 'Food', ""Network'sUnwrappedwhich"", 'interviews', 'film', 'stars', 'real', 'chefs', 'who', 'concocted', 'dishes', 'movie']",N/A

The chemistry didn't come across as realistic between them for the most part. He seemed a bit too &#34;boyish&#34; (for lack of a better word) and lacking in sophistication, to seem like her kind of partner.

That is the basic premise of this movie where Kate (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the exective chef at a successful New York restaurant.  She has total control over what happens in her kitchen and her life revolves around acheiving perfection.  The life-style she leads doesn't leave much room for outside interests or family but when her sister dies, the only one that can raise her niece is her.  All this happens during a time period when a new sous chef has been hired and has a vastly different approach to cooking and running a kitchen.While somewhat predictable, the movie rises above the usual slap-stick humor of the other movies (which I loved.) This movie shows more of the human emotion of losing a sister and mother and the havoc it causes is portrayed with more depth and feeling.  While very humorous at times (particularly enjoyed the scene where she cooks a meal for the young niece and it ends up being a fish with its head still on - the reaction is priceless) it is more realistic than other movies along this same story line.Good acting, good story and a great way to spend an evening at home!",4,Well worth watching,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,1309,"['have', 'seen', 'movies', 'where', 'someone', 'well-ordered', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'unexpectedly', 'required', 'raise', 'child', 'think', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby', 'Baby', 'Boom', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'where', 'Kate', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'exective', 'chef', 'successful', 'New', 'York', 'restaurant', 'total', 'control', 'what', 'kitchen', 'life', 'acheiving', 'perfection', 'life-style', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'room', 'outside', 'interests', 'family', 'when', 'sister', 'dies', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'raise', 'niece', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'new', 'sous', 'chef', 'been', 'hired', 'vastly', 'different', 'approach', 'cooking', 'running', 'kitchen.While', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'movie', 'usual', 'slap-stick', 'humor', 'other', 'movies', 'loved', 'movie', 'more', 'human', 'emotion', 'losing', 'sister', 'mother', 'havoc', 'portrayed', 'more', 'depth', 'feeling', 'very', 'humorous', 'times', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'where', 'meal', 'young', 'niece', 'up', 'being', 'fish', 'head', 'still', 'reaction', 'priceless', 'more', 'realistic', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'story', 'line.Good', 'acting', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'home']",N/A

The original of this movie ""Mostly Martha"" outshines No Reservations largely due to the fact that Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn't pull off the vulnerability needed for the role.  Her sister has died and she winds up responsible for her young niece but Jones never comes near the pain the loss of a sibling would truly cause - especially given the fact that she had practically raised her sister after their own mother died.  This fact could very easily have explained the main character's often neurotic behavior, but it's never touched upon.  As a result, the growth of this character falls flat.  The actress playing the young niece did a far better job at sharing the emotion of her loss, her pain. Eckhart was really excellent as the Sioux-chef, quite possibly because he played a lot of scenes with the girl.  He comes off just as his character should - intelligent, caring and damned good at his job. I suppose if you don't see the original and aren't familiar with foreign film making, or with Hollywood's tendency to pull only what they think will sell from the story line - you might disagree with my rating.

But as is often true when someone excels in one area, that person lacks in all others. This remarkable chef (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has a lovely sister who excels in being a mom to daughter Zoe (Abigail Breslin). As is often the case these two sisters had a father unremarkable for being a nonexistent father. So these two sisters choose to live their lives without men.Then a terrible thing happens: the mother/sister dies in a car accident, leaving Zoe with the aunt who is a chef also famed for keeping her distance from people. Enter Kate and Zoe, struggling to deal with first, the loss of their beloved, then this new situation and environment. Child and woman, these two, have difficulty meeting on a common ground. There is no spark, no warmth between them. It's not that Kate resents poor Zoe--she just cannot connect with her. It's not that Zoe resents Kate--she is just too sad.Enter Nick, the slight-of-hand, the guy with the charm and wit, but good charm and sensitive wit, who can read people. He is the synapse who clicks the two--child and woman into a synergy of three people. The loveliest part of the movie is the time the three spend the day together, just doing and being.Zoe needs to be loved, Kate needs only her job, and the restaurant owner needs a sous chef until Kate adjusts to her new role as a caretaker. Nick (Aaron Eckhart), the sous-chef needs to be needed, not that he is wimpy. He is quite gregarious and fun-loving, but he likes cooperation and congenial surroundings, light-heartedness amidst an often chaotic profession. Kate is all about being serious and professional.When faced with change, people themselves must change or remain static and find themselves left behind specifically in relationships. When Nick begins to woo Kate, he is so cool. Instead of pouncing on her like a wild beast, he leaves her wanting more--just a kiss,  just a kiss. Clever man!The ending far surpasses what is expected and I will leave it at that. Aaron Eckhart brought exactly the right charisma to his role. He looks the part of a temperamental chef without being one. Catherine Zeta-Jones is finally showing just the blush of aging and it becomes her. She plays her reserve with just the right coolness, exhibiting just a trace of passion below the surface.  Any child could have played the girl. On the verge of prepubescence, Abigail Breslin simply did not display her usual cuteness, whether the director, the role, or Abigail herself.As much a part of the film as any character is the romance of food and wine and music, much of it opera arias with some Italian love songs thrown in. As a matter of fact, I have already ordered the CD. One of the female waitstaff walks through the kitchen to tell Nick that opera is great music for lovemaking just as he said. It certainly is when Kate and Nick finally do kiss. I kept wondering if Michael was watching his wife film this scene. It's a good one.Not Academy Award material, but definitely date fare. And, oh husbands and wives, it might remind you of that first fire of your love for the other.

On the other hand, it is great to see Zeta-Jones back, but with none of the ""meatiness"" of roles like CHICAGO and TRAFFIC that allow her to be the multi-facted actress that she is.Aaron Eckhart seems typecast again in roles that keep defining his career as the breezy guy who defrosts lady's cold troubled hearts!.All-in-all, NO RESERVATIONS is a pleasant enough one time view,but there is not much that is tasty and tempting enough to reserve a table a second time!Excellent companion film would be MOSTLY MARTHA which seems to be where this film drew it's inspiration.",3,"Lots of ""reservations"" about this ""light fare"" rom-com.",1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,1942,"['Have', 'ever', 'sat', 'theatre', 'found', 'saying', 'Oh', 'remember', 'seeing', 'scene', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'know', 'expect', 'everything', 'come', 'out', 'just', 'certain', 'way', 'Not', 'bad', 'se', 'certainly', 'NO', 'RESERVATIONS', 'not', 'original', 'ideas', 'brought', 'screen', 'workaholic', 'woman', 'who', 'edges', 'chipped', 'off', 'softened', 'experience', 'real', 'essence', 'life', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'charmingly', 'cute', 'together', 'man', 'enter', 'too', 'well', 'ordered', 'world', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'adorable', 'orphan', 'who', 'love', 'needs', 'give', 'receive', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', '.This', 'film', 'seemed', 'borrowed', 'characters', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'THE', 'COURTSHIP', 'OF', 'EDDIE', 'FATHER', 'most', 'particular', 'Argentinian', 'Academy', 'nominated', 'SON', 'THE', 'BRIDE', 'German', 'film', 'MOSTLY', 'MARTHA.There', 'nothing', 'new', 'NO', 'RESERVATIONS', 'so', 'have', 'NO', 'EXPECTATIONS.It', 'formulaic', 'feel-good', 'all-works-out', 'end', 'are', 'necessary', 'touching', 'moments', 'help', 'feel', 'three', 'characters', 'really', 'nothing', 'here', 'not', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'better', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'fresh', 'triumph', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'Dakota', 'Fanning-Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'moment.Scripts', 'will', 'abound', 'age', 'then', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'get', 'tired', 'mature', 'other', 'hand', 'great', 'see', 'Zeta-Jones', 'back', 'none', 'meatiness', 'roles', 'CHICAGO', 'TRAFFIC', 'allow', 'be', 'multi-facted', 'actress', 'Eckhart', 'typecast', 'again', 'roles', 'keep', 'defining', 'career', 'breezy', 'guy', 'who', 'lady', 'cold', 'troubled', 'hearts', '.All-in-all', 'NO', 'RESERVATIONS', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'one', 'time', 'view', 'not', 'much', 'tasty', 'tempting', 'enough', 'reserve', 'table', 'second', 'time', 'Excellent', 'companion', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'MOSTLY', 'MARTHA', 'be', 'where', 'film', 'drew', 'inspiration']",N/A

Quido ""quidrock""","[14, 23]","The trailer portrays a sophisticated romantic comedy and focuses on the romance and the high anxiety of chef Kate (Catherine Zeta Jones), the kitchen terror of the restaurant ""22 Bleeker St"". Moviegoers expect to see the beautiful Zeta Jones act like Gordon Ramsay of TV's ""Hell's Kitchen"", only to be tamed by fellow chef Nick Palmer (Aaron Eckhart).In reality, the film, which I screened last weekend, is more of a sad family film of loss and redemption, with some light comedic touches. And while I did enjoy it at the theater, overall, it is a forgettable movie.A remake of the German ""Mostly Martha"", the film has executive chef Kate anticipating a visit from her sister and niece, when the sister is killed in a traffic accident. Niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin, the moppet from ""Little Miss Sunshine"") survives the crash and is brought to live in Kate's somewhat ascetic existence. She is overwhelmingly sad and disconnected from her new life.While trying to juggle sudden motherhood with career, Kate is forced to put up with a newly hired sous chef, Nick. Nick brightens the kitchen with his costumes, his love of all things Italian, his opera, his willingness to put up with sulky Kate. It is Nick who bonds quickly with Zoe, and acts as a catalyst between the two ladies. What saves ""No Reservations"" is the insouciance of Eckhart's character, and his chemistry with Breslin. But for a sizeable portion of the film, the prevailing feeling is sadness, for the plight of young Zoe and the cold containment of Kate in dealing with the situation.  Zeta Jones plays her character frosty, cool, and with little ability to empathize with the plight of Zoe. Even her apologies, when she forgets to pick Zoe up at school, etc., seem forced.And it is this character vacuum that causes the movie to be something less than it might have been. With some spark and volatility, combined with the slickness of Kate's kitchen, the endearing qualities of both Zoe and Nick, the film could have been a winner. Let's say, with Kyra Sedgewick, in the Kate role, the film would have beenfar more engaging. Zeta Jones continues her reign as one of the screen's most beautiful leading ladies, and we know she has depth (proving it as Velma in ""Chicago"" and with her cameo in ""Traffic""), but this genre of films doesn't bring it out, and she is ultimately responsible for the movie being one where I would recommend:""Wait for the DVD""",3,Forgettable,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,2415,"['trailer', 'sophisticated', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'focuses', 'romance', 'high', 'anxiety', 'chef', 'Kate', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'kitchen', 'terror', 'restaurant', '22', 'Bleeker', 'St', 'Moviegoers', 'expect', 'see', 'beautiful', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'act', 'Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'TV', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'only', 'be', 'tamed', 'fellow', 'chef', 'Nick', 'Palmer', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', '.In', 'reality', 'film', 'screened', 'last', 'weekend', 'more', 'sad', 'family', 'film', 'loss', 'redemption', 'light', 'comedic', 'touches', 'did', 'enjoy', 'theater', 'overall', 'forgettable', 'movie.A', 'remake', 'German', 'Mostly', 'Martha', 'film', 'executive', 'chef', 'Kate', 'anticipating', 'visit', 'sister', 'niece', 'when', 'sister', 'killed', 'traffic', 'accident', 'Niece', 'Zoe', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'moppet', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'crash', 'brought', 'live', 'Kate', 'somewhat', 'ascetic', 'existence', 'overwhelmingly', 'sad', 'disconnected', 'new', 'life.While', 'trying', 'juggle', 'sudden', 'motherhood', 'career', 'Kate', 'forced', 'put', 'up', 'newly', 'hired', 'sous', 'chef', 'Nick', 'Nick', 'kitchen', 'costumes', 'love', 'things', 'Italian', 'opera', 'willingness', 'put', 'up', 'sulky', 'Kate', 'Nick', 'who', 'bonds', 'quickly', 'Zoe', 'catalyst', 'two', 'ladies', 'What', 'Reservations', 'insouciance', 'Eckhart', 'character', 'chemistry', 'Breslin', 'sizeable', 'portion', 'film', 'prevailing', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'plight', 'young', 'Zoe', 'cold', 'containment', 'Kate', 'dealing', 'situation', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'character', 'frosty', 'cool', 'little', 'ability', 'empathize', 'plight', 'Zoe', 'Even', 'apologies', 'when', 'pick', 'Zoe', 'up', 'school', 'etc.', 'seem', 'forced.And', 'character', 'vacuum', 'movie', 'be', 'something', 'less', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'spark', 'volatility', 'combined', 'slickness', 'Kate', 'kitchen', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'Zoe', 'Nick', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'winner', 'Let', 'say', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'Kate', 'role', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'beenfar', 'more', 'engaging', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'reign', 'one', 'screen', 'most', 'beautiful', 'leading', 'ladies', 'know', 'depth', 'proving', 'Velma', 'Chicago', 'cameo', 'Traffic', 'genre', 'films', ""n't"", 'bring', 'out', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'movie', 'being', 'one', 'where', 'would', 'recommend', 'Wait', 'DVD']",N/A
656798,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00005JPSM,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","The cover of this DVD is absolutely misguiding, in every possible aspect. More detailed description below, with some limited SPOILERS.1. Catherine Zeta-Jones character (Kate Armstrong) seems a quite cheerful and likeable person on the cover - well, in the film it is definitely NOT the case! Kate is indeed not only a bitter, depressed workoholic and a pathological loner, but she is also cold, humourless, frequently mean and agressive. And even if some improvement occurs during the film, she mostly remains like that until the end.2. Aaron Eckhart character (Nick Palmer) was supposed to be a complete opposite of Kate and, well, indeed he is more exuberant and definitely nicer - but ultimately he is rather a very average and a little bit pale guy. Nice but ultimately boring.3. Looking at the cover we naturally assume that that there will be a romance between the two main characters. Indeed, the director tried to build such a romance into his film, but he failed. The &#34;romance&#34; seems completely artificial as neither of the main characters seems really interested - they just go through the motions because it is in the scenario.4. The rivalry between two amazingly gifted and very competitif chefs, mixed with the war of sexes, offered so many possibilities to the scenarist - but he seized NONE of them. Dialogs are so lame that there is not even one smart one-liner! Humour is completely absent, as in the whole 104 minutes there is only ONE funny scene (it involves one very aggravated chef, one very obnoxious patron and one very surprised steak...)5. Most of the film is NOT about Kate and Nick but about the very difficult task Kate faces when she has to take in her orphaned niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin). During most of the film Zoe struggles to come to terms with the violent death of her mother (which she witnessed!) and it is absolutely heart-breaking. Kate tries hard to take care of her but it is a difficult path for both of them... This actually makes most of this film rather sad.Considering that the main character is unlikeable and irritating, that the leading male character is ultimately not very interesting and that this film mostly turns about a sad, suffering child (little Abigail Breslin gives quite a show in this film), this is definitely NOT a comedy and even more definitely NOT a romatic comedy. And it is also quite depressing.My wife gave up after 25 minutes and left the room to watch something else upstairs, after offering me a last really nasty, dark stare of her gorgeous eyes, because I was supposed to pick a romantic comedy for the evening - and instead I brought THIS...

She is known for her unbelievable unique dishes and for the flair in her cooking.Her sister is coming to visit with her niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin).  Then the unexpected happens and Kate gets a call at the restaurant. En route to arrive that evening, her sister and niece have been in a terrible car accident.  Kate's sister is dead and Zoe is at the hospital.Dealing with the grief of the loss of his sister, Kate throws herself more into her work.  She is now mother to Zoe.  Kate has never been good in relationships - she is not the most affable of people as all she thinks about is her kitchen and her cooking.  Both Kate and Zoe are thrown together by chance and both are dealing with their grief. Zoe needs love and understanding as she has lost her mother and Kate has no idea how to provide that, as there is little warmth between them.Meanwhile, Kate's sous chef is about to give birth, so she is replaced by Nick (Aaron Eckhart).  Kate takes a week off as her overwhelming grief has eventually caught up with her.  Upon her return to the restaurant, she finds Nick running her kitchen.  His gregarious opera-loving manner is something that Kate is unprepared for and is quite unwelcome in her precise and well-run kitchen.  He is light-hearted, witty and completely charming and Kate is certain that Nick's M.O. is to take over her kitchen.  The war starts.One night Kate brings Zoe to the restaurant as she has to work and cant leave Zoe at home alone. She is also beside herself, as Zoe will not eat any of the flamboyant dishes she has cooked for her.  Zoe forms a tenuous bond with Nick and soon Kate is also drawn to his charm and how well he deals with Zoe.Nick woos Kate and soon their relationship blossoms.NO RESERVATIONS is very well cast - each actor plays their role to perfection.  Zeta-Jones is magnificent in her role of top chef and struggling instant mother.  Young Abigail Beslin - does a remarkable job in the woebegone Zoe (she is developing into a fine young actress) and Eckhart - who is sexy a hell - is the prince charming in the story! This is a terrific and touching film for those whose attraction is food, music and love!PS!

His acting is directly on point and the character is written as a hero with a modern sensibility - not quite a metrosexual, but not the strong silent type either. He expresses his feelings openly in a wonderfully sexy way.Catherine Zeta-Jones is pleasant in her part, in that odd way she has of seeming like an every-woman character in spite of her stunning looks. You feel as if you've known this character. The story line with the sister is predictably sad and played for effect, but the little girl is a scene stealer - she's entirely believable.Some of the antics at the restaurant stretch your ability to suspend disbelief, but it's never so over the top that you can't see it happening that way in a place much better than you've ever worked in.

And it was clear that my skepticism was justified.For about two-thirds of the movie, an attempt was made to duplicate the German original -- in look, in mood, even in the casting.Catherine Zeta-Jones was okay -- not great, but okay.  But Aaron Eckhart is just not believable  in his role. He lacks the distinctive quirkiness of Sergio Castellitto in the original.  I was charmed and fascinated by Castellitto -- definitely not by Eckhart.  So I didn't believe Zeta-Jones would be either.From the point at which he is introduced, the movie -- never reaching anything you could call a particular high point -- heads quickly downhill.  Significant plot elements are simply dispensed with and, toward the end, it almost seems as if the makers of this tepid effort looked at their watches, saw that time was running out, and raced to the finished.  It's all very rushed and flat at the end.Added to that are the numerous times throughout the movie where the Hollywood filmmakers, apparently doubting the viewers' intelligence, found it necessary to add obvious and rather sappy touches to emphasize what was communicated with subtlety yet complete clarity in the original  Somehow American studios can't resist the urge to fix what isn't broken.Find another DVD to spend your money on.

If you're into food, you will probably be able to look past the film's weaknesses and enjoy it.First of all, the movie is about two chefs. Kate (Zeta-Jones) is the executive chef at a tony New York restaurant. She is something of a control freak, and her work has become her life. Her sister (a single mom - the dad is nowhere to be found) and niece are coming up to visit, and enroute, they are involved in a car accident. The sister dies as a result, and she leaves her daughter Zoe (Breslin) to Kate. In the midst of this personal crisis, Kate must deal with a new sous-chef in her kitchen at work. Nick (Eckhart), an established chef in his own right, takes the job because he wants the opportunity to work with (and learn from) the well-respected Kate.As Kate adjusts to being a mother, and as she tries to guide Zoe (and herself) through the tragedy of loss, a romantic relationship with Nick slowly develops. Kate finds herself confronting her own tendencies to sabotage love (she hasn't had a relationship in 3 years) while figuring out her new life.While this script is no Oscar-winner, I liked the performances of all three principal actors. Plus, the movie is about two people who cook for a living, and food figured heavily in the scenes (which I can certainly appreciate).This is an inoffensive dramedy, overall, but I wouldn't consider it a must-see.

The whole story of the sister dying and her little girl coming to live with Kate is really quite sad. I have to assume CZJ was drabbed down a bit for this role.  Aaron Eckhart has a great time with his part - an opera singer he is not, but a great lover of life, yes indeed.  There is not a whole lot of chemistry between the leads, but thank God Nick is there to help Kate get used to the idea of being responsible for another human life, because she really struggles.  I am somewhat ambivalent toward this movie.  I wanted more in terms of character and relationship development.  How well did Zoe know her aunt before she had to come live with her?  Really, if Nick was such a catch as a sous-chef, why didn't he have a job as head chef at another restaurant?  And without giving away the ending (except to say that it very much reminded me of the end of Waitress), the journey between the penultimate scene and the final scene would have made a pretty good movie in itself.

There's also comedy, but again, not the prime focus.Mostly there's a story of an overly stressed and tightly wound head chef for a busy restaurant in a big city environment who has inherited her sister's only child and has been somewhat forced to work with a chef she didn't get to select and approve of before his hiring.The movie is entertaining enough to rate 3 stars, but in trying not to be any one type of movie there seems not to be much of an identity here at all.People that have worked in the restaurant business, or who are interested in the restaurant business may enjoy the film a bit more than others as it offers a bit of a behind the scenes look at the restaurant business.  Then again, you could turn the TV on and watch Hell's Kitchen, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, the Food Network or similar material to gain some of the same insights.Again, as another reviewer here mentions, if you are a fan of either of the stars, you also might get more enjoyment from the movie.On Blu-ray disc the picture looks good, audio levels were consistent, background music not overly distracting.Worth the purchase?

656847,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPSM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 6]","About midway through ""No Reservations"", Zoe (Abigail Breslin) turns to her aunt, Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and says...""Aunt Kate, you don't have to do that...""""What?""""Try so hard.""It occurred to me this is an apt analogy for the film itself. Director Scott Hicks (""Shine"", ""Snow Falling on Cedars"") you don't have to try so hard to make things cute, romantic and adorable. If you have a well-written script with all of the right elements, everything will come together. Don't force it.Kate (Zeta-Jones), the exacting chef at a well-regarded small restaurant in Manhattan, is very uptight and spends all of her time thinking about food, her restaurant and her career. Her sister and her niece (Breslin, ""Little Miss Sunshine"") are on their way for a visit when they get in a car accident. Suddenly, Kate is her niece's guardian and has to deal with a new young girl in her life. Kate's boss (Patricia Clarkson) asks her to take some time off, but she stops by the restaurant to find Nick (Aaron Eckhart), her new sous chef stirring things up in the kitchen; he plays opera, he jokes with the staff, he's a good guy. But Kate suspects he is trying to steal her restaurant. When she returns to work, she begrudgingly puts up with him because he claims he wants to work with, but that doesn't mean she will like it.""No Reservations"" is based on a German film called ""Mostly Martha"". It has been sometime since I have seen the original, but I remember enjoying the film. It wasn't earth shattering, but it was an enjoyable experience. ""No Reservations"" seems to be a fairly straightforward remake. Both films tell virtually the same story, with some character names and the location changed. But ""No Reservations"" seems excessively ""Hollywood"", as though they have drained all subtlety out of the story and tried to make it more `understandable' for the broad audience it will receive in this country.""No Reservations"" is not a bad film. Zeta-Jones and Eckhart are both good, and I felt they were able to build some actual chemistry. Breslin is also good as the young lady who finds herself without a mother and has to deal with this. But it is an extremely predictable film.On ""Ebert and Roeper"", Roeper and his guest reviewer gave ""Reservations"" thumbs up, noting it was a nice film for the summer and seemed to praise the fact they could predict everything that would happen before it happened. Unfortunately, they hit the mark right on the head. This is part of the reason I feel Hicks is trying to hard to get a reaction from his actors and from us. And also why the film is simply mediocre. If you can catch it on cable, you won't turn it off. But take the time to go to a theater or rent it? No way. Not worth it.After Kate returns to the restaurant, she is reluctant to work with Nick, but her boss insists. Kate's sous chef is about to leave to give birth and she needs some help. At one point, they have a blow up and Nick won't stay unless Kate says she needs him. This scene has been done, and done, and overdone in millions of romantic comedies. Of course, the fact she says she `needs him' is a metaphor for the impending romantic complications. What do you think she does?When she becomes resigned to having Nick around, Kate tears the menu in half and gives Nick a portion of it. But he objects, ""Your portion is larger than mine"". She half-heartedly brandishes a knife and he sheepishly slinks away.Throughout the story, Kate makes periodic visits to a shrink (Bob Balaban), a practice enforced by her boss because Kate is so highly strung; she confronts customers when they make a complaint. Unfortunately, you realize really early on the shrink will start using cooking terminology to help Kate with the problems in her life. So when he started to talk about how Kate knew ""the best recipes in life are the ones she creates"" the film completely lost me. This was the last straw. For your next film, Mr. Hicks, don't try so hard.Catherine Zeta-Jones is a good actress, but she has had mixed success in her film career. In ""No Reservations"" she seems very consistent in her creation of the super controlling, but also super uptight chef. Everything in her life is about her job and her food. When a neighbor, Sean (Bryan F. O'Byrne) asks her out, she makes up a rule about not dating neighbors; she doesn't have the time or the energy to devote to a relationship. Everything is about her food and her career. Then, when Zoe enters her life, Kate realizes she has to take care of her niece and tries to make her feel comfortable, but she doesn't become June Cleaver overnight. It takes some time for her to open up to her niece and for her niece to feel comfortable around her. This is realistic and makes her performance good. After they move in together, Kate naturally tries to get Zoe to eat, but Kate's idea of food and Zoe's idea of food are two different things. The first thing she serves her niece is a whole roasted fish, complete with eyes, and some saut&eacute;ed squash.Later, after Nick (Eckhart) starts working, Kate has no choice but to bring her niece to the restaurant with her. Naturally, Zoe is drawn to Nick and he realizes she is not eating, so he fixes a big bowl of pasta and gets her to eat. When Kate realizes this, she looks at him and mouths ""Thank you"". He nods back. This is the beginning of their relationship and it is a little too precious to be realistic.Nick's purpose in the story is to charm the socks off of Kate, something that has apparently happened very rarely. Eckhart does a good job of making this character interesting. He is the complete opposite of Kate; he likes to play music in the kitchen, get the staff motivated, let them have fun. He is serious about food, but when Kate intones, ""That restaurant is all I have. It's what I am."" We know Nick doesn't feel that way. He replies, ""It's only a small part of you"".Naturally, because Nick is such a lovable guy, he is also going to charm Zoe's socks off as well. Zoe arranges for Nick to come over and cook on their day off. Zoe has a plan and has only let Nick in on the details. Whole roasted fish again? Not on your life. But Zoe has more plans than simply food. This is a cute idea, but it crosses the line and becomes saccharin sweet.Abigail Breslin does a good job of portraying Zoe's grief. As a young girl, she doesn't know how to deal with the feelings of loss she experiences after her mother dies. She is afraid, lonely and unsure about what will happen. After she moves in with her aunt, she tries to be brave (when Kate leaves her alone for a few hours to go to the restaurant) but ends up barricading herself in her room. As the story progresses, she gradually becomes more and more accepting of her aunt. As with Zeta-Jones, Breslin makes this believable because they never rush into each other's arms for a big hug. There is too much going on for them to become so close, so quickly.As I said ""No Reservations"" is not a bad film, it is just so predictable. If you have seen any romantic comedies in the past, you will probably be able to chart out the entire film about ten minutes in.",3,2 1/2 - Has Some Flavor But You Expect Some Sizzle,1186099200,"08 3,

It follows the formula or outline of most romantic comedies so closely it feels pre-packaged and almost every scene is entirely predictable.It follows as story of a famous chef Kate, played by the always-stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones, who's sister has just dies in a car accident, forcing Kate to take in her sister's only daughter, Zoe (played by Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin). While taking time off to deal with the loss and adjust to having a child at home, a new chef, Nick (Played by Aaron Ekhart) is hired by the restaurant. Once Kate returns to work she feels threatened by the new chef, thinking he is trying to take over her kitchen and career. As the two work together they find themselves falling for each other.The cast does a fine job, Catherine Zeta-Jones sensually sophisticated, Aaron Ekhart well I have to admit I felt he was sort of picked because of his perfect ""model"" features but he still does a fine job. Abigail Breslin does a wonderful job reminding us why she received that nomination at such a young age.The main problem with this film was its' script. I thought the characters weren't developed quite enough. It almost seemed as an outline example for romantic comedies. As I watched the final scene I smirked having already figured it out a long time ago.One thing that helps partially salvage this movie is the pure fascinating culinary imagery, and despite all the negativity in this review it is still a moderately entertaining film for when you want something simple, brainless, and light.
