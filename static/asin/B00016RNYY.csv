From one thing i can say that the samurai x series has better drawn characters from what i have seen in Rurouni Kenshin the Movie. This movie is about how kenshin first receives his scar. This i have got to say was one of the best anime ever owned and anyone who purchases it will not be sorry. It has a great story line to it and it is very graphic especially when he kills. Its gory so the rating on it would probably be mature, but other than that you dont have to be a Rurouni Kenshin fan to enjoy this series",5,This has everything a person would want!,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,625,"['Well', 'be', 'honest', 'i', 'havent', 'seen', 'rurouni', 'kenshin', 'series', 'television', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'samurai', 'x', 'series', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'samurai', 'x', 'series', 'better', 'drawn', 'characters', 'what', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'Movie', 'movie', 'how', 'kenshin', 'first', 'scar', 'i', 'have', 'got', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'ever', 'owned', 'anyone', 'who', 'purchases', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'sorry', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'graphic', 'especially', 'when', 'gory', 'rating', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'mature', 'other', 'dont', 'have', 'be', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'series']",N/A

I loved seeing Kenshin as a young and serious hitokiri and later, as a happily married man.One of the box collection extras are brief character analysis, including Kenshin, Tomoe, Hiko Seijuro, and Enishi.  Kenshin's superiors are also included, something I thought was extremly helpful, as I kept confusing some of the leaders of the clans.  Also, some historical background information is provided which further helped me understand what things were like during that time period.Again, I LOVE Kenshin and would highly recommend the OVA collection to anyone who doesn't already own the OVA's.",5,Simply the Best,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,704,"['love', 'anime', 'series', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'OVA', 'especially', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'are', 'simply', 'amazing', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Kenshin', 'young', 'serious', 'hitokiri', 'later', 'happily', 'married', 'man.One', 'box', 'collection', 'extras', 'are', 'brief', 'character', 'analysis', 'including', 'Kenshin', 'Tomoe', 'Hiko', 'Seijuro', 'Enishi', 'Kenshin', 'superiors', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'something', 'thought', 'was', 'extremly', 'helpful', 'kept', 'confusing', 'leaders', 'clans', 'Also', 'historical', 'background', 'information', 'provided', 'further', 'helped', 'understand', 'what', 'things', 'were', 'time', 'period.Again', 'LOVE', 'Kenshin', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'OVA', 'collection', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'OVA']",N/A
794392,A26LWI9RAR7RX7,B00016RNYY,In Search Of...,"[28, 29]","This OVA set focuses on the serious and melancholic side to the Rurouni Kenshin universe. It's a wonderful compliment to the more light-hearted TV series. After seeing the TV series, I highly recommend watching this OVA.The TV series masterfully balances humor and drama while leaving the fans with a feeling of happiness. The OVA on the other hand, focuses on the internal struggle of Kenshin Himura as he learns the way of the Hiten Mitsurugi style and becomes the feared Hitokiri Battousai. It certainly shows the viciousness of Kenshin in the graphic violence in the anime. It definitely has a mature theme. The action sequences were much more fierce and unforgiving as the acts of the manslayer were depicted. I was shocked at some of the gruesome deaths of the people.There was also a constant atmosphere of sadness throughout the anime. The music was beautiful with a very sad overtone. I was surprised at how moving the story was as the history of his distinctive cross-shaped scar was revealed. His heart could not cope with the trials and tribulations as he continually tried to attone for his past actions.This OVA is a masterpiece and I highly recommend it. However, I must admit that I was left with a very somber feeling after finishing it. I was very touched with the characters and storytelling, especially with the flashbacks. Even if you have not seen the TV series, I highly recommend this boxed set. However, I would not recommend this for younger kids as the nature of the violence and melancholic tone may not hold their attention.",5,A serious perspective  for Rurouni Kenshin fans.,1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,1553,"['OVA', 'set', 'focuses', 'serious', 'melancholic', 'side', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'universe', 'wonderful', 'compliment', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'TV', 'series', 'seeing', 'TV', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'OVA.The', 'TV', 'series', 'masterfully', 'humor', 'drama', 'leaving', 'fans', 'feeling', 'happiness', 'OVA', 'other', 'hand', 'internal', 'struggle', 'Kenshin', 'Himura', 'way', 'Hiten', 'Mitsurugi', 'style', 'feared', 'Hitokiri', 'Battousai', 'certainly', 'viciousness', 'Kenshin', 'graphic', 'violence', 'anime', 'definitely', 'mature', 'theme', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'fierce', 'unforgiving', 'acts', 'manslayer', 'were', 'depicted', 'was', 'shocked', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'people.There', 'was', 'also', 'constant', 'atmosphere', 'sadness', 'anime', 'music', 'was', 'beautiful', 'very', 'sad', 'overtone', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'moving', 'story', 'was', 'history', 'distinctive', 'cross-shaped', 'scar', 'was', 'revealed', 'heart', 'could', 'not', 'cope', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'continually', 'tried', 'attone', 'past', 'actions.This', 'OVA', 'masterpiece', 'highly', 'recommend', 'However', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'left', 'very', 'somber', 'feeling', 'finishing', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'characters', 'storytelling', 'especially', 'flashbacks', 'Even', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'boxed', 'set', 'However', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'younger', 'kids', 'nature', 'violence', 'melancholic', 'tone', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'attention']",N/A

794396,A1HP3B92A3JDQ1,B00016RNYY,"OmegaWolf747 ""Aoooooooooooo!""","[2, 2]","Well, Tsuiokuhen (the proper Japanese title for Trust and Betrayal) is simply the most gorgeous piece of anime I've ever seen. It is very elemental in the way it tells the story. I just love all the symbolism laced throughout the movie like Kenshin's little top and all the pretty nature shots.Yes, it is very grim compared to the TV series. Since it's set during a bloody war, one can understand this. You can't really expect Kenshin as an assassin to walk around saying, ""Oro"". Rather, this is the story of how he embarked on the journey to become the rurouni of the TV series.Tomoe is captured pretty well, though I do prefer her portrayal in the manga. However, as the mystery around her unfolds, we see her sadness and her humanity. We see that she is torn between her feelings for Kenshin and her feelings for her fiance.I also love how Hiko is portrayed in this OVA and think he's even better in this than in the manga and anime. He seems wiser and more humane somehow, I think because of his expanded speeches.I also really liked Kenshin's clan master, Katsura Kogoro. Even though he is ruthless enough to take advantage of a naive 14-year-old, we can see Katsura's plight and see that he really isn't an evil person. Like Kenshin, he's simply doing the best he can in an adverse situation.Seisouhen (the Japanese title for ""Reflection"") on the other hand is just pure garbage. I've read the original manga and it shares nothing with this train wreck of an OVA.Seisouhen, which is set in the relatively peaceful Meiji Era, tries too hard to recapture the dark beauty of Tsuiokuhen, which takes place during the violent Bakumatsu.The end result of this is characters who aren't themselves. The Kenshin of Seisouhen isn't the man who went through the character growth of the Kyoto and Jinchuu Arcs. Rather he is Battousai all over again; still grief-stricken and angst driven.Kaoru isn't Kaoru, but a Meiji Era version of Tomoe; quiet, submissive and self-sacrificing to a fault.In order to try and recreate the tragic beauty of the culmination of Tsuiokuhen, the makers of Seisouhen invent a disease that slowly eats away at Kenshin's mind and body and then have Kaoru deliberately take it to ""share his pain"".The only characters in this OVA who really seemed alright were Yahiko and Kenji. Kenji is understandably bitter at his parents' continued neglect of him in favor of their little angst/romance. Eventually, he splits for Kyoto and seeks out Kenshin's old master Hiko Seijuro XIII to learn Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu so he can understand his father's past strength.Enter Yahiko, armed with the Sakabatou. Yahiko fights Kenji in a duel that is unfortunately the highlight of this slow-paced and boring OVA in an attempt to get the teenager to return to Kaoru with him so she won't be alone.The end result of this OVA left a bitter taste in my mouth. I cannot recommend this OVA to any fan with a good conscience.",4,"One beauty, one bane",1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,2918,"['Well', 'Tsuiokuhen', 'proper', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'simply', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'piece', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'elemental', 'way', 'story', 'just', 'love', 'symbolism', 'laced', 'movie', 'Kenshin', 'little', 'top', 'pretty', 'nature', 'shots.Yes', 'very', 'grim', 'compared', 'TV', 'series', 'set', 'bloody', 'war', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'Kenshin', 'assassin', 'walk', 'saying', 'Oro', 'Rather', 'story', 'how', 'embarked', 'journey', 'become', 'rurouni', 'TV', 'series.Tomoe', 'captured', 'pretty', 'well', 'do', 'prefer', 'portrayal', 'manga', 'However', 'mystery', 'unfolds', 'see', 'sadness', 'humanity', 'see', 'torn', 'feelings', 'Kenshin', 'feelings', 'fiance.I', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'Hiko', 'portrayed', 'OVA', 'think', 'even', 'better', 'manga', 'anime', 'wiser', 'more', 'humane', 'somehow', 'think', 'expanded', 'speeches.I', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'Kenshin', 'clan', 'master', 'Katsura', 'Kogoro', 'Even', 'ruthless', 'enough', 'take', 'advantage', 'naive', '14-year-old', 'can', 'see', 'Katsura', 'plight', 'see', 'really', ""n't"", 'evil', 'person', 'Kenshin', 'simply', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'adverse', 'situation.Seisouhen', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Reflection', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'pure', 'garbage', ""'ve"", 'read', 'original', 'manga', 'shares', 'nothing', 'train', 'wreck', 'OVA.Seisouhen', 'set', 'relatively', 'peaceful', 'Meiji', 'Era', 'too', 'hard', 'recapture', 'dark', 'beauty', 'Tsuiokuhen', 'place', 'violent', 'Bakumatsu.The', 'end', 'result', 'characters', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'Kenshin', 'Seisouhen', ""n't"", 'man', 'who', 'went', 'character', 'growth', 'Kyoto', 'Jinchuu', 'Arcs', 'Battousai', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'still', 'grief-stricken', 'angst', 'driven.Kaoru', ""n't"", 'Kaoru', 'Meiji', 'Era', 'version', 'Tomoe', 'quiet', 'submissive', 'self-sacrificing', 'fault.In', 'order', 'try', 'recreate', 'tragic', 'beauty', 'culmination', 'Tsuiokuhen', 'makers', 'Seisouhen', 'invent', 'disease', 'slowly', 'away', 'Kenshin', 'mind', 'body', 'then', 'have', 'Kaoru', 'deliberately', 'take', 'share', 'pain', 'only', 'characters', 'OVA', 'who', 'really', 'seemed', 'alright', 'were', 'Yahiko', 'Kenji', 'Kenji', 'understandably', 'bitter', 'parents', 'continued', 'neglect', 'favor', 'little', 'angst/romance', 'Eventually', 'Kyoto', 'out', 'Kenshin', 'old', 'master', 'Hiko', 'Seijuro', 'XIII', 'learn', 'Hiten', 'Mitsurugi', 'Ryu', 'can', 'understand', 'father', 'past', 'strength.Enter', 'Yahiko', 'armed', 'Sakabatou', 'Yahiko', 'fights', 'Kenji', 'duel', 'unfortunately', 'highlight', 'slow-paced', 'boring', 'OVA', 'attempt', 'get', 'teenager', 'return', 'Kaoru', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'alone.The', 'end', 'result', 'OVA', 'left', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'OVA', 'fan', 'good', 'conscience']",N/A
