Zittel,"[1, 2]","Got this movie to watch from the library, because I've been reading a lot lately about cults and polygamy, though I haven't read this book yet.The movie is two different story lines - the past and the present - and I found the past storyline much more interesting than the current story line. The current story line revolves around a who-done-it mystery, but with very few suspects and a very slow moving plot, I didn't particularly care who did it.I was definitely hoping for ""more"" from this movie.The acting was OK, but Chyler Leigh, who I adored from Grey's, stole the show.",3,"okay, slow moving",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,578,"['Got', 'movie', 'watch', 'library', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'lot', 'lately', 'cults', 'polygamy', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'yet.The', 'movie', 'two', 'different', 'story', 'lines', 'past', 'present', 'found', 'past', 'storyline', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'current', 'story', 'line', 'current', 'story', 'line', 'who-done-it', 'mystery', 'very', 'few', 'suspects', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'who', 'did', 'it.I', 'was', 'definitely', 'hoping', 'more', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'was', 'OK', 'Chyler', 'Leigh', 'who', 'adored', 'Grey', 'stole', 'show']",N/A

1422552,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004NYYDHU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","In the world of Lifetime movies, a genre populated by ""based on real incidents"" docudramas, women in peril thrillers, and prurient ""ripped from the headline"" scandals or crime stories, they occasionally break the mold to adapt a popular fiction. In my mind, some of their more successful ventures have been these literary adaptations--""The Tenth Circle"" and ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter,"" for example, worked as stand alone movies even if fans of the books were disappointed by the oversimplification of the presentations. I think those who were intrigued by David Ebershoff's bestseller ""The 19th Wife"" will likewise be displeased by this by-the-numbers accounting--but more problematic, the film may also fail to appeal to newbies with no connection to the source material. This seemed a can't miss entertainment combining murder and polygamy, but the story is stretched too thin and the principle characters tend to be completely unbelievable.The novel's hook is that it paralleled a modern murder investigation with a historical examination of one of Brigham Young's more rebellious wives. ""The 19th Wife"" benefits tremendously with the casting of Patricia Wettig (Thirtysomething) as a compound wife charged with murdering her husband. Unfortunately the film actually centers around Chyler Leigh (Grey's Anatomy), a young progressive who sets out to prove Wettig's innocence. Enlisting her childhood friend and Wettig's son, Matt Czuchry (The Good Wife, Gilmore Girls), the two start to unravel the truths of the case and deal with unresolved feelings of betrayal and resentment. Wettig does well, as you might expect, and Czuchry is appropriately bitter having been cast out as a boy--but they are, by far, the best things about the movie. Leigh is the single most unbelievable representative of a polygamist sect ever put on film. Raised on the principle, she is so extraordinarily modern and free--at home to openly disregard any aspect of the lifestyle that inconveniences the plot. Oh, it made my head hurt!By itself, though, it's an interesting enough story even if the final revelations lack a bit of conviction. But the film also tries to incorporate the Brigham Young aspect into the plot by having Leigh read the elicit diary of a woman ahead of her time. At about 95 minutes, it is really just too little time to represent either story very effectively. This is where fans of the novel are likely to be up-in-arms, the story really becomes a skeleton of the complexities you might have admired about the book! Surprisingly, I'm still going to give this a nominal recommendation only for Wettig's fans--we don't see her often enough and she can't be held guilty for the sins of this unremarkable TV movie.

1422553,A19OQ6PYJV7LN6,B004NYYDHU,Peter J. Hewson,"[4, 6]","I read the book and thought it would be a good series but unfilmable as a movie. I was wrong. The movie concentrates essentially on the modern 19th wife and the murder of her husband. It's not necessary to have read the book to follow the story and it is a good 'who-done-it?'. The movie does refer to the history of the wives by brief scenes that take place in Salt Lake when Brigham Young was the profit. Those scene inform the viewer as to how we came to be where we are today. It's a film-making strategy that, in this case, works well. Probably because those scenes aren't flashbacks.The movie adds colour to a dour book and illustrates (peoples?) the story with the multiplicity of the wives: a house full of wives (and their children is memorable. The setting is visually very pleasing.As for the gay aspect: Jordan is played by an attractive young actor however the story is coy as to his sexuality hinting that he may not be attracted to women, or he may. It's a pity that the makers were cowerdly with this as Jordan's sexuality was a defining element to his character in the book and so the movie emasculates him.I give it 3/5: well worthwhile to see.",3,A large story told well in a movie but a cop-out too!,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,1162,"['read', 'book', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'series', 'unfilmable', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'essentially', 'modern', '19th', 'wife', 'murder', 'husband', 'not', 'necessary', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'follow', 'story', 'good', ""'who-done-it"", 'movie', 'refer', 'history', 'wives', 'brief', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'when', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'was', 'profit', 'scene', 'inform', 'viewer', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'where', 'are', 'today', 'film-making', 'strategy', 'case', 'well', 'Probably', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'flashbacks.The', 'movie', 'colour', 'dour', 'book', 'illustrates', 'peoples', 'story', 'multiplicity', 'wives', 'house', 'full', 'wives', 'children', 'memorable', 'setting', 'visually', 'very', 'pleasing.As', 'gay', 'aspect', 'Jordan', 'played', 'attractive', 'young', 'actor', 'however', 'story', 'coy', 'sexuality', 'hinting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'attracted', 'women', 'may', 'pity', 'makers', 'were', 'cowerdly', 'Jordan', 'sexuality', 'was', 'defining', 'element', 'character', 'book', 'so', 'movie', 'him.I', 'give', '3/5', 'well', 'see']",N/A
1422554,A387BD735MI50R,B004NYYDHU,R. Schultz,"[0, 2]","This movie gets its ""based on real life"" story across, but is rather amateurishly produced. The characters sometimes seem to be coming onstage from the wings to recite their lines, as if they were performing in a high school play. A lot of the story is told through successive visits that the characters make to the prison where the devout Mormon woman accused of killing her husband is being held. This device adds a further static, staged quality to the proceedings.Most of the characters are also presented as stock types, incapable of any gradation of feeling. They are either all right - or all wrong. The head of this branch sect of Mormonism is a thorough-going bad guy, virtually a comic book villain.Most of the males in this sect are represented simply as ""lecherous old men intent on accumulating as many young wives as possible."" That may in fact be what some fanatically fundamentalist religious cults come down to. But many such groups at least start out with a vision of communalism, with a sense that ""it takes a village"" to raise children and to carry on the necessary work of family life. There's no suggestion of any such positive intention here. Only the darkest abuses of the polygamous lifestyle are seen.The current action is intercut with flashbacks from the life of one of Brigham Young's wives. Just as that earlier victim of polygamy saw escape as her only option - escape seems as if it might have to be the only option for the heroine in this modern Mormon sect.The question of who committed the murder almost takes second place to this question of whether the heroine will make the break or not, and if so, whether she'll make it safely out of the clutches of the threatening sect elders.Although I was certainly rooting for the heroine, I couldn't help but feel just a mote of uncertainty about the kind of freedom that would lie ahead of her. She'd be exchanging the presumed constraints of the long, uniform pioneer-style dresses that women in the sect had to wear - for the presumed breeziness of mini-skirts and make-up. But would that actually be exchanging an obligation to exclusively please one man for the larger obligation to please all men in passing? This movie doesn't entertain any such subtleties of doubt.",3,A Bit Stilted and One-Sided,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,2252,"['movie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'rather', 'amateurishly', 'produced', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'be', 'coming', 'onstage', 'wings', 'recite', 'lines', 'were', 'performing', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'lot', 'story', 'told', 'successive', 'visits', 'characters', 'make', 'prison', 'where', 'devout', 'Mormon', 'woman', 'accused', 'killing', 'husband', 'being', 'held', 'device', 'further', 'static', 'staged', 'quality', 'proceedings.Most', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'presented', 'stock', 'types', 'incapable', 'gradation', 'feeling', 'are', 'right', 'wrong', 'head', 'branch', 'sect', 'Mormonism', 'thorough-going', 'bad', 'guy', 'virtually', 'comic', 'book', 'villain.Most', 'males', 'sect', 'are', 'represented', 'simply', 'lecherous', 'old', 'men', 'intent', 'accumulating', 'many', 'young', 'wives', 'possible', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'what', 'fanatically', 'fundamentalist', 'religious', 'cults', 'come', 'down', 'many', 'such', 'groups', 'least', 'start', 'out', 'vision', 'communalism', 'sense', 'village', 'raise', 'children', 'carry', 'necessary', 'work', 'family', 'life', 'suggestion', 'such', 'positive', 'intention', 'here', 'Only', 'darkest', 'abuses', 'polygamous', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'seen.The', 'current', 'action', 'intercut', 'flashbacks', 'life', 'one', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'wives', 'Just', 'earlier', 'victim', 'polygamy', 'saw', 'escape', 'only', 'option', 'escape', 'might', 'have', 'be', 'only', 'option', 'heroine', 'modern', 'Mormon', 'sect.The', 'question', 'who', 'committed', 'murder', 'almost', 'second', 'place', 'question', 'heroine', 'will', 'make', 'break', 'not', 'so', ""'ll"", 'make', 'safely', 'clutches', 'threatening', 'sect', 'was', 'certainly', 'rooting', 'heroine', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'just', 'mote', 'uncertainty', 'kind', 'freedom', 'would', 'lie', 'ahead', ""'d"", 'be', 'exchanging', 'presumed', 'constraints', 'long', 'uniform', 'pioneer-style', 'dresses', 'women', 'sect', 'had', 'wear', 'presumed', 'breeziness', 'mini-skirts', 'make-up', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'exchanging', 'obligation', 'exclusively', 'please', 'one', 'man', 'larger', 'obligation', 'please', 'men', 'passing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'entertain', 'such', 'subtleties', 'doubt']",N/A

1422556,A1B93TR0NVC8TP,B004NYYDHU,Truth Hurts,"[0, 1]","What's with polygamy these days. I been married once, and i tell you there will not be a second wife. I guess some people would say &#34;don't knock it till you try it.&#34;, but i say  people are not breakfast cereal. There is no variety pack when you elope. one day i feel like Lucky Charms, and yesterday i felt like oatmeal, and today i feel like product 19.Think about it how much complaining can one man take? now multiply it by 19. True you get to bed a different wife every night, but When you wake up, you got 18 jealous sets of complaints, and gripes. Now i believe in a perfect world there is no divorce, but here in the real world you got divorce, child support, and alimony. A polygamist person must be a brave soul to think he's man enough to satisfy 19 women. In this movie i notice some of these eligible bachelors  are pushing 55 years of age. some of the girls depicted in this film are under 18 years old. Nothing grosser then robbing the cradle.I hope that if there are polygamists like the ones in this movie. I hope to the highest power your young wife is repulsed by you, and she tells you she needs a younger man that can satisfy her natural appetites, and desires. No person deserves more then one spouse at one time. Polygamists are like your some fat kid that needs another piece of cake. If you eat too much cake you get diarrhea, and become an even fatter matinee.Our story takes place in the Mormon religion. There are a bunch of minor sects all answering to a prophet.The prophet gives away young ladies as brides to old, gross, disgusting men pushing for a headstone. One day a member of her flock tried to rape her daughter, and when she tried to get the gentleman in trouble they found that the Parrish did not give a rectal fart.Being a supportive husband, and proving the Parrish is more important then his daughter, he also dismisses the allegation. Our hero then slaps his 19'th wife, tells her she was his favorite, and goes upstairs to have relations with the 13'th wife.She is put in a barn with her children for punishment. Because on some planet, not ours this guy believes the attempted rape of his child was less important then social standing. The 19'th wife pushes onward, and in spite she burns down the barn, and goes on the lamb. She does the one thing that proves she is just like the rest of us. She goes straight to the welfare line for assistance.Her other daughter is in love with some Quaker, and she tells her boyfriend her location, who in turn tells her step father the 19'th wife's location.  The husband gets his step daughter and promises she can marry the Quaker. The Prophet instead has her to be wed to her own stepfather.
