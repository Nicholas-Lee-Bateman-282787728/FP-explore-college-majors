1158691,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00188KD1E,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 3]","I wasn't prepared to like HAMLET 2, but solid acting, witty lines and loopy plot turns had me enjoying the movie thoroughly.A would-be playwright actor, the unpronounceable Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan), has reached rock bottom in his attempt to turn popular movies into stage plays; his take on Eric Brockovich is so lacking he gets run out of town.  So Dana leads his ragtag rep company (wife played by Cynthia Keener, buddy by David Arquette) into uncharted territory: Tucson, Arizona.  There he stumbles upon a gig as drama teacher at ""West Mesa High School,"" a down-at-the-heels edu-barn whose programs are constantly being cut down to nothing.**SPOILERS** At first, Dana's largely minority drama students don't see much in this white interloper, but eventually he wins them over -- not by cunning or caring but because in Dana's alcoholism and failure, the students feel sorry for HIM.  (And help him, a fun inversion on the usual [and occasionally patronizing] film like STAND AND DELIVER or DEAD POET'S SOCIETY.)  Dana's neediness and overall air of incompetence may put viewers in mind of ""Corky St. Clair"" from the Christopher Guest flick, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.So Dana and Company help each other into a sequel of one of the most sequel-proof plays in Western Civilization -- Hamlet.  Actually, the resulting ""Hamlet 2"" doesn't seem to have that much to do with Shakespeare's treasure, but much of it resembles ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" (By now, you can guess who plays Jesus.)**This is a cue for some of the most knowing (i.e., most hilariously awful) parodies of modern Broadway song and dance, from early Andrew Lloyd Weber through post-millenial ""Rent,"" full scaffolding and all. Largely written by the production staff and apparently sung by a pick-up crew, these song howlers include titles like ""I Love You, Sexy Jesus,"" ""Raped in the Face,"" and ""(You're as) Gay as the Day is Long"" (""You like it all sizes, but you love it extra long"").  Thank heaven no one was allowed in or out of the auditorium once this once-in-a-lifetime experience was experienced!Delightful performances in HAMLET 2, first of all the lead, Steve Coogan as Dana Marcz.  Great support comes from a number of veterans including David Arquette, Catherine Keener and Elizabeth Shue; my personal favorite is ""Corky Feldstein"" played with liberal (in both senses of the word) delight by Amy Poehler as the ACLU lawyer who insists that the increasingly blasphemous and obscene play gets played. (No. Matter. What.)Somewhere along the line, HAMLET 2 the film develops its own kind of lopsided sweetness, which is what redeems this feature-length film as more than just a thirty-minute ""Family Guy"" parody of Tin Pan Alley.  I won't claim it is as good as WAITING FOR GUFFMAN but it has that kind of mock-the-genre touch and sympathetic (though comic) insight. Sadly, some of the language alone got this film an ""R"" rating; I for one think clued-in teens would have enjoyed this spoof when it originally played movie houses.  Bells-and-whistles are adequate but the DVD lacks a running Commentary.  Nonetheless, I recommend it.Production Note:  The film was actually shot in Albuquerque, New Mexico.",4,Well worth a try,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,3178,"['was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'like', 'HAMLET', '2', 'solid', 'acting', 'witty', 'lines', 'loopy', 'plot', 'turns', 'had', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'would-be', 'playwright', 'actor', 'unpronounceable', 'Dana', 'Marschz', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'reached', 'rock', 'bottom', 'attempt', 'turn', 'popular', 'movies', 'stage', 'plays', 'take', 'Eric', 'Brockovich', 'so', 'lacking', 'run', 'town', 'So', 'Dana', 'ragtag', 'rep', 'company', 'wife', 'played', 'Cynthia', 'Keener', 'buddy', 'David', 'Arquette', 'uncharted', 'territory', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'gig', 'drama', 'teacher', 'West', 'Mesa', 'High', 'School', 'down-at-the-heels', 'edu-barn', 'programs', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'cut', 'down', 'nothing', '**SPOILERS**', 'first', 'Dana', 'largely', 'minority', 'drama', 'students', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'white', 'interloper', 'eventually', 'over', 'not', 'cunning', 'caring', 'Dana', 'alcoholism', 'failure', 'students', 'feel', 'sorry', 'HIM', 'help', 'fun', 'inversion', 'usual', '[', 'occasionally', 'patronizing', ']', 'film', 'STAND', 'AND', 'DELIVER', 'DEAD', 'POET', 'SOCIETY', 'Dana', 'neediness', 'overall', 'air', 'incompetence', 'may', 'put', 'viewers', 'mind', 'Corky', 'St.', 'Clair', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'flick', 'WAITING', 'FOR', 'GUFFMAN.So', 'Dana', 'Company', 'help', 'other', 'sequel', 'one', 'most', 'sequel-proof', 'plays', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'Hamlet', 'Actually', 'resulting', '2', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'Shakespeare', 'treasure', 'much', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'now', 'can', 'guess', 'who', 'Jesus', '**This', 'cue', 'most', 'knowing', 'i.e.', 'most', 'hilariously', 'awful', 'parodies', 'modern', 'Broadway', 'song', 'dance', 'early', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'post-millenial', 'Rent', 'full', 'scaffolding', 'Largely', 'written', 'production', 'staff', 'apparently', 'sung', 'pick-up', 'crew', 'song', 'howlers', 'include', 'titles', 'Love', 'Sexy', 'Jesus', 'Raped', 'Face', ""'re"", 'Gay', 'Day', 'Long', 'sizes', 'love', 'extra', 'long', 'Thank', 'heaven', 'one', 'was', 'allowed', 'auditorium', 'once', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'experience', 'was', 'experienced', 'Delightful', 'performances', 'HAMLET', '2', 'first', 'lead', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Dana', 'Marcz', 'Great', 'support', 'number', 'veterans', 'including', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Corky', 'Feldstein', 'played', 'liberal', 'senses', 'word', 'delight', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'ACLU', 'lawyer', 'who', 'increasingly', 'blasphemous', 'obscene', 'play', 'played', 'No', 'Matter', 'What', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'HAMLET', '2', 'film', 'own', 'kind', 'lopsided', 'sweetness', 'what', 'feature-length', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'thirty-minute', 'Family', 'Guy', 'parody', 'Tin', 'Pan', 'Alley', 'wo', ""n't"", 'claim', 'as', 'good', 'WAITING', 'GUFFMAN', 'kind', 'mock-the-genre', 'touch', 'sympathetic', 'comic', 'insight', 'Sadly', 'language', 'alone', 'got', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'one', 'think', 'clued-in', 'teens', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'spoof', 'when', 'originally', 'played', 'movie', 'houses', 'Bells-and-whistles', 'are', 'adequate', 'DVD', 'running', 'Commentary', 'Nonetheless', 'recommend', 'it.Production', 'Note', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Albuquerque', 'New', 'Mexico']",Hamlet 2 Theatrical Release

1158693,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00188KD1E,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 5]","HAMLET 2 is corny, stupid, ridiculous and ludicrous, all at the same time ...which helps it succeed on some bizarre, comedic level.Steven Coogan (Tropic Thunder), the king of losers, stars as Dana Marschz, a failing drama teacher at a high school where only two students regularly attend his classes. His loser status is enhanced throughout the film as his job faces the school district's financial axe, his wife Brie (Catherine Keener,An American Crime) runs off with another loser, and his classroom becomes overrun by gangbanger wannabes who've been run out of their own building. But with the new infusion of students comes an opportunity for Dana. Always wanting to produce his own musical/drama stage play, he comes up with a great idea: Hamlet 2. Yes, THAT Hamlet. ""But doesn't everyone die at the end of Hamlet?"" someone asks rather perceptively.Though this be madness, yet there is method in it. I think...Hamlet 2 is just ...wrong. Wrong on every level imaginable. Religiously, philosophically, and instructionally, this is just so ...wrong! Which makes it just a tad alright. As Dana unleashes his play, great and terrible things come out, including Christian extremists and art critics. When the phenomenal stage song ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" begins playing, it proves just how off-kilter this film really is. Which, again, makes it a touch okay. ""I get it now! Jesus is sexy!""The film lacks coherency in terms of a distinct direction. It seems that the goal of the film is for Dana to hit rock bottom before succeeding with an impossibly absurd stage story sequel to one of the greatest plays of all time.The funny thing about Hamlet 2 is that the acting is really bad. And it appears that it is MEANT to be bad so that there is bad acting within a story that's about bad acting (and writing). Even so, this hints at the level of comedy that director Andrew Fleming was shooting for; a layer upon layer theme that works and doesn't work.But, if for no other reason, you need to watch the film to see the ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" number.

1158695,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00188KD1E,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 1]","I could tell what the audience was thinking during ""Hamlet 2,"" especially since it was so sparsely populated and virtually no one was laughing. They didn't think it was funny. They were most likely offended, to be perfectly honest. How fortuitous they should see a movie about a high school play so outrageous, people actively try to prevent it's opening. When a down-on-his-luck high school drama teacher faces the termination of his department, he writes a musical sequel to Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" in which the title character and Jesus Christ use a time machine to stop everyone from dying at the end. ""Hamlet 2""--the film--is at times vulgar, at times silly, and at times so desperate for a laugh that it doesn't know when to quit. But it's also refreshingly daring, and by the time we get to the first performance of the controversial play, we realize that there are moments of inspired writing. We also realize that it's funny to see Elizabeth Shue play a caricature of herself, a caricature that quit acting in favor of being a nurse in a sperm bank.""Dreams are ephemeral,"" says the narrator at the beginning of the film, ""so where do dreams die?"" We then see a shot of a sign welcoming us to Tucson, Arizona, and it's there that an irreverent story of resurrecting those dreams unfolds. Tucson is where recovering alcoholic Dana Marschz (Stephen Coogan) is now living, barely getting by as a high school drama teacher. You can't help but pity this character, a man so blindly devoted to the performing arts that he doesn't realize how embarrassing he is, to himself and to others. All of his attempts to break into acting had failed because, as he eventually admits to himself, he has absolutely no talent. His only remaining option was to teach drama in an Arizona high school, a class that two and only two students selected as their elective. The closeted Rand Posin (Skylar Astin) and the racist Epiphany Sellars (Phoebe Strole) remain in Marschz's class to this day, and they always star in his unimpressive, uninspired adaptations of recent blockbuster movies.On the first day of the new year, Marschz enters the theater and discovers it full of students, and much to Rand and Epiphany's chagrin, most of them are Hispanic. The sudden surge in attendance is easy to explain: Drama is the only extracurricular activity to survive massive budget cuts. But it doesn't stay that way; the mean-spirited Principal Rocker (Marshall Bell) tells Marschz that Drama has also been cut, meaning this is his final year as a teacher. Hoping to resurrect Drama--and maybe earn some respect along the way--Marschz begins writing an original musical play, one that he claims will metaphorically examine his relationship with his father. For whatever reason, this will include minimal nudity, some sex, and a creative reinterpretation of Jesus Christ. One of the songs will be called ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus."" The parents, as you can imagine, are offended by the idea of Jesus being portrayed as sexy. Then one of the cast members explains it: if Jesus were to be brought back today, His image would be accepted in much the same way a celebrity's could be. It's a strange idea, but it actually makes sense.So does the entire film, albeit in a very unconventional way. My personal reaction to Marschz was, for the most part, just the same as every other character: he's downright humiliating. But there's something about him that you can't ignore, something that makes you want to root for the success of his play. Despite social skills that would embarrass a five-year-old, he is a nice person, and much of his hardship is undeserved. Consider his relationship with his wife, Brie (Catherine Keener); she's fed up with everything, including her husband, especially since they've had no luck conceiving. Marschz completely fails to notice how she feels, although not because he's intentionally trying to neglect her. It's because he's alarmingly nave. He doesn't pick up on anything, not even when the truth is staring him in the face. It's quite possible he doesn't want to pick up on anything. All he wants is to exist in a purely creative world, free from vigilantes who try to run him over for producing a forbidden play. It doesn't matter that he's found a venue outside school property to stage the show; ""Hamlet 2"" will never see the light of day, not if the Tucson community has anything to say about it.Here enters Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler), an attorney for the ACLU determined to help Marschz keep his play going. She's so fiercely protective of free speech, it's almost as if she intentionally picks fights with anyone who has an opposing viewpoint. There's a moment when she actually encourages a firefighter to hit her, and you just know it's only because she wants to sue somebody. Who can say whether or not she had any affect on ""Hamlet 2,"" the play? All I know is that Marschz and his students somehow make through rehearsals to opening night. I won't say what happens or how the film resolves itself; what I will say is that ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus"" is a surprisingly infectious song. On the same token, ""Hamlet 2"" is a surprisingly infectious movie. It's a juvenile comedy on the surface only--underneath, it actually has something to say. I'm not sure everyone will get the message, considering the reaction of the audience I was in. But as one of the parents says during the opening night performance, ""I'm simultaneously disgusted and fascinated."" My feelings exactly.",4,"Hey, Let's Put On a Show!",1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,5486,"['could', 'tell', 'what', 'audience', 'was', 'thinking', 'Hamlet', '2', 'especially', 'was', 'so', 'sparsely',

Steve Coogan is hilarious, both a wonderful physical actor and a superb deliverer of very clever writing.  It is unafraid to offend--songs like ""Raped in the Face"" and ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" are going to push many people's buttons, but they are to a point, and when Jesus forgives his father at the climax of the play Hamlet 2, the film becomes more than just a comedy.Be sure to watch the extras in the DVD, too!MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,"Outrageous, Provocative, and True",1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,773,"['Hamlet', '2', 'comedy', 'best', 'sense', 'unsparing', 'truth', 'especially', 'precarious', 'position', 'arts', 'schools', 'confusion', 'talent', 'enthusiasm', 'What', 'particularly', 'wonderful', 'how', 'Hamlet', 'II', 'simultaneously', 'parody', 'inspirational', 'teacher', 'movies', 'being', 'inspirational', 'teacher', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'hilarious', 'wonderful', 'physical', 'actor', 'superb', 'deliverer', 'very', 'clever', 'writing', 'unafraid', 'offend', 'songs', 'Raped', 'Face', 'Rock', 'Me', 'Sexy', 'Jesus', 'are', 'going', 'push', 'many', 'people', 'buttons', 'are', 'point', 'when', 'Jesus', 'father', 'climax', 'play', 'Hamlet', '2', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'comedy.Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'extras', 'DVD', 'too', 'MOST', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",Hamlet 2 Theatrical Release
1158697,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00188KD1E,Ed Uyeshima,"[22, 24]","I kept flashing back to Christopher Guest's hilarious 1997 mockumentary,Waiting for Guffman, as I was watching this raucous 2008 comedy, and in this case, that turns out to be high praise. Directed and co-written in ramshackle fashion by Andrew Fleming (whose most prominent credits include the 2003 remake ofThe In-Lawsand an episode ofArrested Development), this wacky concoction mixes broad slapstick, harmless raunch, and politically incorrect humor with a heavy, tongue-in-cheek dose ofDangerous Minds(referred to in the film) and every other clich&eacute;-driven movie about a schoolteacher who serves to inspire his students. The result is something of a mess when it comes to telling a coherent story, but it's also an infectious movie that had me laughing heartily during most of its 92-minute running time. It comes as no surprise that Fleming's writing partner is Pam Brady, who is most famous for producing and writing several episodes ofSouth Park, as well as the 1999 movie version,South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut. The similarities are quite apparent.The plot is predictably absurd and rather inspired. Manitoba-born Dana Marschz is a failed TV commercial actor who has ended up teaching drama in a Tucson high school. He has just finished directing a stage production ofErin Brockovichstarring the only two students enthusiastic about his over-the-top, highly derivative approach to theater. Marschz is trying to earn the respect of the pre-adolescent critic of the school newspaper but to little effect. His wife Brie hates him and yet wants to have a child. At the same time, they are forced to take in a tight-lipped boarder named Gary to make ends meet. Things change dramatically on the first day of the new semester when Marschz inherits a classroom full of Latino students who could care less about drama. Told by the principal that drama would no longer be part of the school curriculum, Marschz decides to go out fighting and stage a long-gestating work-in-progress, a musical sequel to the Bard's most famous work entitled, of course, ""Hamlet 2"". What happens after that point is a freewheeling comedy of errors that gives Marschz's demented optimism the perfect vehicle.Looking like Eric Idle's younger brother, Steve Coogan gives an audaciously funny performance as Marschz, a pitiable character in the most obvious ways but undeniably likeable. He flails somewhat during the more vulnerable moments probably because his performance is so otherwise manic and vainglorious. By comparison, Christopher Guest's Corky St. Clair in ""Guffman"" has moments of weakness, but his character resonated more simply because the humor came from a more serious state of self-doubt. However, Coogan is a superb physical comedian, especially on his ever-present roller skates. Back in hippie-chick mode fromThe 40-Year-Old Virgin, Catherine Keener is hilariously toxic as Brie, while Amy Poehler gets the funniest lines in her smallish role as ACLU lawyer Cricket Feldstein, an overly enthusiastic activist with a bigoted streak a mile wide.Elisabeth Shue gets to play a parody of herself as washed up in Hollywood and forced into what she says is a more fulfilling career as a fertility clinic nurse. While she is charming as usual, Shue is not given nearly enough to do here. There are bright turns by Skylar Astin as the closeted Rand and Phoebe Strole as the unctuous Epiphany, both alumni of Broadway'sSpring Awakening, as well as from Joseph Julian Soria as the brooding actor-wannabe Octavia. The normally hyperactive David Arquette plays strictly against type as near-silent Gary. The much ballyhooed production that provides the film's climax is not quite as outrageous as ""Springtime for Hitler"" in the original 1968 version ofThe Producers. However, it is funny enough despite the fact that ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus"" sounds like a familiar doo-wop song with wittier lyrics. I just wish Brady and Fleming spent a bit more time on consolidating the plot structure. Some of the story meanders without reason, and then it just stops without incident.

However, most of the stuff is pretty stupid, unoriginal or unfunny. I found Coogan's character to be more idiotic than humorous, and many intentions to be funny don't hit their mark.It's too bad, because the premise of the film was actually pretty good. When one high school teacher (Steve Coogan) has his drama program pulled from him, he takes measures to make sure the show will still go on. However, he has to not only try to get approval for his show, but turn some goof offs into actors who can perform his newly formed sequel of Hamlet. The film is a parody of some of the inspirational teacher films, such as Dangerous Minds or Dead Poet's Society. However, many of the bits to try to make fun of these films fall flat, and it is not really a very good rendition of satirizing Shakespeare either. So, in the end, this is a film that fails in everything it tries to be.Another annoyance was the means by which this film tried to be funny. The film employs many politically incorrect and objectionable moments in the play's final production, and though they do this for some humor, most of falls flat or, just like a cheap production of Hamlet, is poorly delivered. The potential was there to make this a really good satire of Shakespeare's Hamlet, but the directors don't steer in that direction. Not that one expects much from a film like this, but most of the characters were also completely underdeveloped, and serve more as stage props than anything else.Brainless comedies can be a good escape; however, this one wasn't.",1,...Or Not To Be...,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,1701,"['Hamlet', '2', 'moronic', 'attempt', 'parody', 'seemingly', 'relying', 'more', 'shock-value', 'being', 'profane', 'repetitively', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'garner', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'However', 'most', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'unoriginal', 'unfunny', 'found', 'Coogan', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'idiotic', 'humorous', 'many', 'intentions', 'be', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'mark.It', 'too', 'bad', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'When', 'one', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'drama', 'program', 'pulled', 'measures', 'make', 'sure', 'show', 'will', 'still', 'go', 'However', 'not', 'only', 'try', 'get', 'approval', 'show', 'turn', 'goof', 'offs', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'perform', 'newly', 'formed', 'sequel', 'Hamlet', 'film', 'parody', 'inspirational', 'teacher', 'films', 'such', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'However', 'many', 'bits', 'try', 'make', 'fun', 'films', 'fall', 'flat', 'not', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'rendition', 'satirizing', 'Shakespeare', 'either', 'So', 'end', 'film', 'everything', 'be.Another', 'annoyance', 'was', 'means', 'film', 'tried', 'be', 'funny', 'film', 'many', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'objectionable', 'moments', 'play', 'final', 'production', 'do', 'humor', 'most', 'falls', 'flat', 'just', 'cheap', 'production', 'Hamlet', 'poorly', 'delivered', 'potential', 'was', 'there', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'satire', 'Shakespeare', 'Hamlet', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'steer', 'direction', 'Not', 'one', 'much', 'film', 'most', 'characters', 'were', 'also', 'completely', 'underdeveloped', 'serve', 'more', 'stage', 'props', 'anything', 'else.Brainless', 'comedies', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'escape', 'however', 'one', 'was', ""n't""]",Hamlet 2 Theatrical Release

1158701,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00188KD1E,James Hiller,"[0, 2]","Let me start off by saying that the entire ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" number in the film is genius, pure and simple. Harkening back to the classic ""Waiting for Guffman"", and tying in the themes of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", director Andrew Fleming has a sequence in this movie is that irreverent, hysterical, and oddly catchy (yup, the song went immediately on my iPod!). It is both sublime parody and a rocking good time. So I have to ask, what the heck happened in the rest of the movie? I have to say that Hamlet 2 is one glorious mess.Starring the brilliant British comic Steve Coogan in the role of a drama teacher fighting for his craft and department. Told by mean principal Rocker (a subtle nod to the musical?) that the funding has been cut, Steve tries to rally his drama class, filled with rejects from other closed electives, to make an outlandish muscial sequel  called Hamlet 2.Coogan misfires unfortunately, looking something like an Eric Idle/aging Beatle wannabe, in his teacher performance. Goofy and unbelievable, he steps all over the film, in sometimes embarrassing ways. Oh yes, he IS funny in many scenes, but in others, I cringed, just waiting for him to get out of the scene. Fortunately, the class of kids he teaches rebound well, and anchor many scenes with both comedy and realness that Steve lacks. In fact, it's in the kids that some of the message rings true. Ethnic stereotypes are cracked as Steve visits the home of ""Heywood"" (that, in itself, is a joke), only to find out the trouble making gang banging kid is actually an honor roll brainiac. Sweet!Or maybe it isn't Steve. Maybe it's in the editing, or a script with characters that just didn't add up to much. But there were many scenes that seemingly detracted from the main thrust of the film, and bogged down the plot too much. For example, both Catherine Keener and David Arquette have nothing much to do in this movie -- other than fill scenes with apparent goofiness. Watching this film was like watching a giant quilt, with some panels unraveling before your eyes, and some that were stunning.People have likened this movie to early John Waters movies. Perhaps. Perhaps in several years from now, people will look at Hamlet 2, and it's brilliant absurdity, and wonder how anyone could diss it.

Lots of very clever and funny bits, plenty of effective sight gags, a screamingly funny Amy Poehler, a quirky, but not too quirky, Catherine Keener, and an over-the-top Steve Coogan all do not compensate for the fact that this film tries to have it both ways. Is it the inspirational teacher movie, the ragtag group of losers who bond to become a cohesive and successful unit, or is it a satire of the inspirational teacher movie? Well, it tries to be both, and thus becomes neither.As well as indecisive, it also tackled too many themes for its own good. The drama critic bits were perfect, so funny I almost choked. (And a nice touch by someone who has no love of critics, I bet!) But the stereotype breaking moments, the anti-censorship attacks, the tormented sexuality, and the ""I was molested as a child"" stuff, were neither cleverly satirical nor effectively dramatic.

I will regret to my dying day not having seen it on the big screen in a theater full of people where I could have enjoyed the ""vitality of the shared experience"".The writers of this film..are you reading this? I LOVE YOU. I get it!!!""It doesn't how much talent you lack, as long as you have enthusiasm""Steve Coogans character is the ENDEARINGLY charismatic human representation of Rumi's classic poem""Passion makes the old medicine new: Passion lops off the bough of weariness. Passion is the elixir that renews: how can there be weariness when passion is present? Oh, don't sigh heavily from fatigue: seek passion, seek passion, seek passion!""No matter how many road blocks he hits, no matter how much abuse is heaped on him he NEVER CLOSES HIS HEART. He starts out hoping to inspire his students and when all seems lost they return the gift.Yes this film us chock full of supremely HILARIOUS unhinged performances. And they work brilliantly. But as Coogans character states emphatically""SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA GO A LITTLE CRAZY TO CREATE GREAT ART""It is not all fun and games and there are poignant moments that are so beautiful to behold...none of the reviewers so far have touched on the HUMANITY in this film and that is where it really shines.Hamlet 2 uses the art of over the top comedy to confront the scourge of alcoholism, child abuse, racial and even sexual stereotypes.  And in all of this ancillary mayhem Steve Coogans character gets around not by car or bus but on roller skates. His safety helmet captured my imagination because with the spiritual flavor of the movie and the obstacles he faces I was transfixed by the memory of a passage in Thessalonians""But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the passionate hope of salvation""Ultimately Hamlet 2 is about second chances. Whether you are hoping for one for yourself or alternately perhaps one day you will be in the exquisite position to grant one. That is the passionate idea this madcap drama teacher wants to explore for Hamlet.  He rewrites the tragedy to give Hamlet the chance to turn things around. And in giving this classic character a second chance he simultaneously creates one for himself.The ""therapy"" Hamlet ends up getting comes in the wake of his quest for Jesus...he finds Jesus LITERALLY. It is a BRILLIANT device and so empowering to the character and to this particular viewer that I openly wept at that sequence in particular. Jesus has a cellphone and Hamlet can call him whenever he needs himHamlet 2 makes PERFECT SENSE. It is a stunning and breathtaking devotional to tolerance and most importantly to the staggering redemptive power of forgiveness.....to LET GO of past or perceived slights and embrace a genuine apology when it is given and conversely to be the one to step up and offer an apology when you know you have done wrong or have hurt someone.In Hamlet 2 Steve Coogans character takes the theme of forgiveness to the highest level by actually CREATING the apology he desperately needed in order to transform his future. He knew intrinsically, that life is like monkey bars you HAVE TO LET GO in order to move forward. He created his own beautiful destiny despite the odds. His helmet of hope helped to dull the ubiquitous naysaying of the less enlightened. He was able to rise above the darkness and simultaneously bring his entire class into the light.There are hundreds of laughs to be found in this sparkling gift to cinema, you will laugh to the point of howling... but what really moved me was the sense of peace that came in the wake of all of the insanity and also a profound comfort.""The great religions are the ships, Poets the life boats.  Every sane person I know has jumped overboard""This film has a poetry all it's own. It is a catharsis in it's purest form. I watched it and was overwhelmed by the idea that it made me laugh AND then it made me think.Hamlet 2 is a spectacular theatrical tribute to Keats thoughts  of ""negative capability"". Negative capability is where instead of succumbing to sadness when horrible things happen to you, you jump up, turn them around and USE THEM for creative inspiration.If you have watched Hamlet 2 and only seen the screwball comedy, the campy acting and audacious re working of Hamlet...then you have seen the movie but you have totally missed the light.  The very fact that this movie is ""uneven"" is what makes it so extraordinary.  Life isn't even... the adventure is in the odds and and the ends.  Get a helmet and give Hamlet 2 a second chance. It is no coincidence that one of the characters is seen wearing a shirt with the name Donald Judd emblazoned on it. The Texas artist was the one who established that when it comes to the creative process ""methods should not matter as long as the results create art"". Another character goes by the name of EPIPHANY....if you watch this film with the free spirit in which it was created, I promise you WILL have one.To the entire cast and crew of Hamlet 2 THANK YOU this movie was GLORIOUS and has inpsired me to always remember PASSION!!!!",5,"""EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE""",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,5141,"['What', 'delicious', 'ride', 'Hamlet', '2',

1158719,A1D3XQC2DIT,B00188KD1E,Peter Shermeta,"[2, 4]","Steve Coogan is Dana Marschz, a former actor who freely admits that the only thing that kept him from fame and fortune was his complete lack of talent. Yet his passion for theater burns on. He attempts to share his passion by teaching drama at a high school in Tucson, Arizona. When he learns that the school is cutting the theater department, Marschz decides that his first original opus is the only way to save his job. Hamlet 2 is born from this epiphany -- a story of hope, second chances, forgiveness, a time machine and a sexy Jesus.There was a lot written about how funny this movie was when it was released. The whole movie, and Steve Coogan separately, were reportedly little-known comedic gems of the year. I thought there were some very funny moments, but the level of humor this movie is billed to contain is misleading. Marschz's life becomes a series of disappointments that lead up to a big, controversial finish. There are a few one-liners along the way that add will make you laugh, but this is not a movie that will make your sides hurt from continuous laughter.Steve Coogan has a very ""Monty Python"" demeanor; he has the slapstick, physical-comedy, tragic-hero, Eric Idle approach. If ever anyone could recreate Eric Idle's cameo in National Lampoon's European Vacation, Coogan is the guy. To conceal the true controversial nature of Hamlet 2, very few details of the musical are divulged as the movie moves along. For me, this meant that the story was a little weak, but I can see how the impact of the big finish would have been lost had more been shared over time. But with so little material, Coogan was just ok. There are more laughs from situations in which he has no pants on then from much of his dialogue. I do not know much about him, but I feel that he was wasted in most of this movie. But he truly shined in his non-speaking moments, especially during the musical at the end. But then again, maybe that is where his talent lies...Anyone remember Catherine Keener? Four years ago she was probably one of the most promising actresses (after earning an Oscar nomination for her role in Capote) and here she is as Mrs. Marschz in a bizarre comedy about a high school drama department. Now you understand my bias when I say that she was a fish out of water here.As a story about troubled high school students who become inspired by an unlikely, but passionate teacher, Hamlet 2 is clich&eacute; and falls apart. Without the actual production of the Hamlet 2 musical within the movie of the same name there is really nothing worth seeing here. But give me a spinoff movie of Amy Poehler's foul-mouthed, ACLU-attorney character and I might even see it in the theater.Save your time.

1158721,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B00188KD1E,Poor Napoleon,"[4, 5]","Hamlet 2 was either hailed as great comedy or despised by critics.  The former group could probably see that this was satarizing a genre of film in the most unlikely way, while the former though it was becoming a genre film with a slightly offbeat sense of humor.In the film, Steve Coogan plays a wannabe actor who's done infomercials, commercials, and appeared as an extra in Xena and found his way as a drama teacher who unsuccessfully adapts hollywood films into plays. He lives with his girlfriend played by Catherine Keener and a border played by David Arquette, who has a couple good bits, but really has little to do in this film.When Coogan discovers he has a large class and that his class is set to close due to funding cuts, he decides to write the outrageous Hamlet 2.  Here's where people get confused.  On one hand, it appears that this film is taking the turn of every high school film where the teacher inspires his students to do great things through his relentless pursuit of a goal.  But in reality, it's lampooning them but doing through chracterization, which is why the film's so much fun.  But if you didn't get it, wait for the DVD and watch again.And of course, while the film is funny, it's uneven until you get to the play itself.  Yes there's funny bits with Elizabeth Shue and brief interplay with Keener, Arquette, and Coogan, but as the play takes shape, we know it will inevitably take center stage.  For the finale alone, the film is worth a watch as it's some of the most hilarious things I've seen on film in years, even if is borderline offensive.  That's the point, right?  My only major gripe is why on earth did Coogan have to use an American accent.

1158722,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00188KD1E,RMurray847,"[0, 1]","HAMLET 2 is a star-making vehicle for Steve Coogan.  It's a wildly uneven but often wildly hilarious film that rests almost entirely on this terrific British comedian's shoulders.  It's the story of a superbly incompetent high school drama teacher /director, living in Tucson.  He's a failed actor (shown to us in wonderfully pitch-perfect commercials that he was once in, including for a herpes medicine).  He's got a wife that he loves (Catherine Keener) but is too clueless to see that she hates him.  And his drama department consists of one girl and one boy, for whom he writes stage adaptations of popular movies like ERIN BROKOVICH.  He's so insecure in his skills that when the ""critic"" for the school newspaper trashes his shows, he's sent into fits of inchoate rage and self-loathing.One day, his class grows in size because all the shop-class students are displaced by a renovation and sent to take drama.  He's now got a couple dozen Hispanic students who know nothing about theatre and he clearly fears them because he assumes they are all gang-bangers.  But Coogan, to his credit, reigns in his terror and is determined to teach these kids something about theatre.It's his great chance, and naturally, he seizes up creatively...unable to decide what to write.  Eventually, he turns to HAMLET for inspiration, and wonders to himself, ""What if Hamlet DIDN'T die, but was able to use a time machine to go back and stop the tragic events that unfold in Shakespeare's classic play?""Believe it or not, this is the most rational part of the musical extravaganza Coogan cooks up.  He finds himself freer and freer to express his personal frustrations (particularly at a long absent father) through his work...and his creation of HAMLET 2 begins to incorporate religion (most notably in the hilarious show-stopper ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus"") and psychology into this twisted, increasingly experimental piece.  The school board gets word and shuts down production.I think I'll stop there with the plot.  While plenty of things HAPPEN in the movie, it's the tone and spirit with which they occur that makes the movie successful.  It's a sloppy piece in many ways...shifting madly between silly slapstick (the student who keeps getting smacked in the head by objects Coogan carelessly tosses around) and family tragicomedy (Coogan's struggling relationship with Keener...who is, as always, tart and intelligent, but this time with a sheen of cruelty...it may be her least sympathetic performance ever.  Still good...she's just SO unlikeable!).  There are moments of sublime randomness (such as the moment Coogan meets actress Elizabeth Shue...played by Elizabeth Shue.  Again, I won't say more...but it's fun!).  There are moments of clich&eacute; (many of the jabs at theatre are straight out of WAITING FOR GUFFMAN)...but there are just as many moments when the clich&eacute; is broken.My favorite example is when Coogan's new ""favorite"" student announces he can no longer appear in HAMLET 2.  He assumes this is because this young T-shirt wearing kid is being bullied by an ignorant, education-hating father.  Turns out, dad is a brilliant scholar, lives in a huge home and objects to HAMLET 2 not because of its take on religion and sex...but because it is so badly written.When the show is finally staged, it is typically over-the-top.  I've never seen a high school with the wherewithal to stage a Broadway scale production...but somehow, HAMLET 2 makes it mostly work.  The show is so gloriously inventive that the audience can't help but marvel.  The movie does a great job of showing that theatre can have the power to stop you in your tracks and make you go ""whoa...that's cool.""  It also shows that people sometimes assume that a show will take one approach to religion when it really is something else.  (The reaction to the aforementioned ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" is the perfect example.)But really, the film works because Coogan is so maniacally over the top.  He reminds me of a strange combination of Gene Wilder and Jim Carrey...but unique as well.  He brings a sweet desperation to his portrayal.  This is a man who has done nothing of note, and doesn't expect to...but for one VERY brief moment, he might make a difference to the lives of others.  One COULD say he steals the show...but he IS the show.  Keener is good, Shue is funny, David Arquette is not annoying and Amy Poehler's brief role is terribly written...but none of it really matters because of Coogan's honest portrayal of a lost, loony drama teacher.The movie is rated R due to some pretty strong language...but beyond that, I think most of the best jokes will only be really appreciated by an adult crowd.  Kids will laugh at the broader stuff...but it's the subtle revelations that make the film special.(On a personal note:  the movie is set in Tucson, but was filmed entirely in my town of Albuquerque, NM.  I'm glad they placed it in Tucson though, because they take a lot of nasty digs at that town!  While Albuquerque was spared the attack...it's a shame that Hollywood insists on mocking mid-sized cities as ""Hicksville."")",4,Wildly uneven and wildly funny...with a great performance from Steve

I must confess that I fear for their neighbors, because this pair views the world from a completely different point of view than the rest of us.  While that's a boon to the movie-going public, I'm not sure I would want to borrow a cup of sugar from - Lord knows what they'd ask for in return.If ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a spoof of all teenager coming-of-age comedies, then ""Hamlet 2"" is a spoof of the ""Let's put on a show"" genre.  Set in the completely mediocre town of Tuscon, the movie revolves around one Dana Marschz, a drama teacher who seemingly would have to aspire to great heights to achieve mediocre.  Played by Steve Coogan with a zany pell-mell brio that brings to mind a young Eric Idle, Mr. Marschz is a semi-successful actor who has fallen on hard times.  Now he teaches drama to mainly disinterested high school students and puts on derivative plays based on successful Hollywood movies.  His marriage to Brie (Catherine Keener) is falling apart before his ignorant eyes and he can only roller-blade to work.  Where, I should add, he is being fired due to budget cuts.His career trajectory, one might say, has flatlined.But then he decides to stage his magnum opus, a sequel to Hamlet.  How, you ask, if everyone dies in the first one?  Simple - a time machine!  Not content to insult the legacy of Shakespeare's most famous play, Dana manages to offend virtually every sensibility in town.But from Dana's madness comes greatness.  Perhaps only through his unwavering faith in Art and the fact that he lives in a parallel universe where Elizabeth Shue plays herself as a local nurse (Shue having grown tired of the phoniness of Hollywood), but Dana believes he has created an artistic masterpiece.The cool thing is, he may be right.  Or he may be spectacularly wrong.If possible, try to avoid any spoilers - this completely original movie must be experienced without any warning as to what is to come.  Several gut-busting comic gems await if you do.A must see for anyone who has ever struggled with art, had frustrated dreams, or attended high school.

Tee Hee.To cartoonish characters - an ACLU lawyer whose egotism and anti-Semitism is only matched by her puerile speech, apparently having learned English in a locker room.  One of her last lines, which (like many things in this movie) was supposed to be funny and wasn't - was ""You know, and those Bible-humping protesters can suck a bag of XXXXs.""  As reviewer Lisa Kennedy put it, ""Amy Poehler's turn as an ACLU lawyer is all very First Amendment.  It is also tiresomely crude.""From Wikipedia:  The NYT states that the film ""made sure to take shots at Christians, gays, Latinos, Jews, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Elisabeth Shue, one of its lead actresses.""  Well, we really can't expect accuracy from either of those sources.  As for taking shots at gays, was that supposed to be including a talented gay chorus in the play to sing songs like Flashdance, without any logical reason for needing the chorus to be gay?  Seems more like promotion than mocking.  Would a shot be ""playwright"" Dana making Hamlet's Leartes gay because Dana decided that his student Rand, who would play the part, was gay?  Or perhaps at the end, Rand deciding after therapy that he was gay (Hollywood 2008 - No other result would be possible) and was at peace and on opening night, after attending no rehearsals, wanting to be back in the play, and his request being met with a resounding ""Of course!""  Or maybe the shot was supposed to be hidden in the song played during the credits, with its chorus of ""Hey, hey, hey - Go gay!  Hey, hey, hey - it's OK!""  The shots at Christians are not so thoroughly disguised.  Take just the title of the song ""Rock Me, Sexy Jesus.""  Naturally, the characters in the movie objecting to the play's blasphemous moments are mocked, and made to look ridiculous.The basic premise of the so-called play is Dana exorcising his ego, wanting to make peace with his father.  This is wrapped up in lame trappings of using a time machine to save the fictional characters of ""Hamlet"", which all die in the original play by Shakespeare.  For no other apparent reason than lack of creativity, Dana throws Jesus into the cast of characters.  But this is the Jesus of Hollywood, so expect stupidity like him moonwalking on an imitation of water, and physically kicking a character dressed up as Satan, while the chorus sings about ""Kicking Satan's butt,"" with a very bright character in the audience shouting out, ""Wait, I totally get it.  Jesus kicks the devil's ass!""  Once again, there's supposed to be humor in this somewhere(?) Totally.The excuse for a ""play within a play"" is disjointed, illogical, and dysfunctional.  So is the set-up.  Suddenly, the drama department is flooded with uninterested students because of more practical classes being cancelled.  In spite of having the biggest enrollment ever in Drama Class as a result of other class closings, the word is that if the next play is not successful (as reviewed by the school's 8th grade drama critic) that class will close, too.  Not dramatic enough?  OK, more pressure to supposedly make us sympathetic to the group in that they are now denied use of the cafeteria for rehearsals, and must share the gym with practicing sport teams.Within the context of the movie, the lame nature of the play apparently is totally irrelevant compared with the offensive things in it.  Thus, suddenly the ACLU appears, the students in the play are totally hyped, and (from all the other students of the school who previously couldn't care less about drama) - we have the football and wrestling teams volunteering to act as security, to ensure the play goes on.  We're also to believe that those who objected to the play still had no problem with buying tickets, and attending.  The idea of a play with no dramatic or moralistic grounding being presented by a drama group with a complete history of failure even has them getting opening night TV news coverage, and the NYT (if it's bad, count on their support) has even flown someone in to cover it.  Finally, at the end of the play, Principal Rocker, reveals that his wanting to stop it wasn't because the ""play"" was objectionable or implausible or just plain stinky, but rather, he was fighting it because he was molested as a child, and concludes ""Maybe that's why I'm so angry.""  What PC puke!The Monty Python group wrote ""The Meaning Of Life"" with the intention of having something to offend everyone.  They also did religious satire well with ""The Life Of Brian.""  The major difference is that the Monty Python group know what humor is, and are masters of it.  The gang behind ""Hamlet 2"" do not, are not.Judeo-Christian - Expect offense.

1158728,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B00188KD1E,Steve,"[3, 4]","Hamlet 2 is a very inconsistent movie. It is simultaneously laugh-out loud funny as well as maddening in the dozens of dead ends and wasted characters that are introduced. It is either a case of bad editing or poor writing, but this movie could have eliminated at least two characters completely without affecting the plot and could have eliminated a hand full of scenes for similar reasons as well. Steve Coogan is a funny enough actor but he can not carry this movie on his own. There are times when he tries too hard and has your finger itching for the remote and, yet, there are other times when he does a nice take on the lines he is given. I am curious as to why he had to lose the accent because I think it would've made his role a bit more convincing and comical - the failed English actor in Tucson - but the writer/director had other ideas. The whole Elisabeth Shue part is genius and the actors and writing for the high school students is believable and well-done. On the other hand, Arquette and Kenner are unnecessary and the small amount of influence their characters bring to the plot might've just as easily been inferred or done off-screen and we would've then been spared Kenner's painfully contrived role and Arquette's largely mute inclusion. Additionally, there are many issues that are touched upon but in such an ephemeral manner that it is little more than a squandered opportunity; e.g. child abuse, coming to grips with one's sexuality, psychological counseling, alcoholism, cultural stereotyping, pointless relationships, and dreams crushed in the face of harsh realities.It is not until the performance of the production at the center of the movie that this uneven offering hits its stride. The musical numbers are hilarious and the reactions of the angry mob and the thug enforcers are priceless. Also, the short-lived but utterly brilliant work of Amy Poehler as the ACLU lawyer further helps to salvage this movie and make me put it on my shelf rather than take it back to the video store for a trade-in.I was interested in the movie because it eschews political correctness and skewers close-minded religious types. It further hits home for me because it is set in Arizona in a public school and the crack of Tucson being the place where dreams go to die is a funny albeit harsh jab at the southwestern world where I have spent much of my teaching career. Those reasons brought the movie into my home and the exquisite satire of the play within the movie is what will keep it here.",3,Uneven but ultimately worth it,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,2513,"['Hamlet', '2', 'very', 'inconsistent', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'laugh-out', 'loud', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'maddening', 'dozens', 'dead', 'ends', 'wasted', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'case', 'bad', 'editing', 'poor', 'writing', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'eliminated', 'least', 'two', 'characters', 'completely', 'affecting', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'eliminated', 'hand', 'full', 'scenes', 'similar', 'reasons', 'well', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'funny', 'enough', 'actor', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'movie', 'own', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'too', 'hard', 'finger', 'itching', 'remote', 'yet', 'are', 'other', 'times', 'when', 'nice', 'take', 'lines', 'given', 'am', 'curious', 'why', 'had', 'lose', 'accent', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'role', 'bit', 'more', 'convincing', 'comical', 'failed', 'English', 'actor', 'Tucson', 'writer/director', 'had', 'other', 'ideas', 'whole', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'part', 'genius', 'actors', 'writing', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'believable', 'well-done', 'other', 'hand', 'Arquette', 'Kenner', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'small', 'amount', 'influence', 'characters', 'bring', 'plot', 'might', ""'ve"", 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'inferred', 'done', 'off-screen', 'would', ""'ve"", 'then', 'been', 'spared', 'Kenner', 'painfully', 'contrived', 'role', 'Arquette', 'largely', 'mute', 'inclusion', 'Additionally', 'are', 'many', 'issues', 'are', 'touched', 'such', 'ephemeral', 'manner', 'little', 'more', 'squandered', 'opportunity', 'child', 'abuse', 'coming', 'grips', 'one', 'sexuality', 'psychological', 'counseling', 'alcoholism', 'cultural', 'stereotyping', 'pointless', 'relationships', 'dreams', 'crushed', 'face', 'harsh', 'realities.It', 'not', 'performance', 'production', 'center', 'movie', 'uneven', 'offering', 'stride', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'hilarious', 'reactions', 'angry', 'mob', 'thug', 'enforcers', 'are', 'priceless', 'Also', 'short-lived', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'work', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'ACLU', 'lawyer', 'further', 'salvage', 'movie', 'make', 'put', 'shelf', 'rather', 'take', 'back', 'video', 'store', 'trade-in.I', 'was', 'interested', 'movie', 'political', 'correctness', 'skewers', 'close-minded', 'religious', 'types', 'further', 'home', 'set', 'Arizona', 'public', 'school', 'crack', 'Tucson', 'being', 'place', 'where', 'dreams', 'go', 'die', 'funny', 'albeit', 'harsh', 'jab', 'southwestern', 'world', 'where', 'have', 'spent', 'much', 'teaching', 'career', 'reasons', 'brought', 'movie', 'home', 'exquisite', 'satire', 'play', 'movie', 'what', 'will', 'keep', 'here']",Hamlet 2 Theatrical Release

Such is the question posed in Hamlet 2, to which the answer must invariably be...by crafting a time machine, picking up Jesus and traveling to various times in history.  Obviously, there's no other conceivable answer.Hamlet 2 is about a high school drama teacher, trying to save his department from going the way of art programs when budget cuts rise.  Or, is Hamlet 2 a parody of the Mr. Holland's Opus/Dead Poets Society/Dangerous Minds-type of movie in which a professor takes a ragtag group and presses on them a love of whatever he/she is teaching?  Or, is Hamlet 2 a deconstruction of a tragedy, begging the question that if the heroes don't die at the end, what's the point, as one person asks in the movie?Or, is it a satire on the way irreverent material is taken in our society, by presenting the two opposite extremes embodied by the principal who threatens bodily harm against the drama instructor and the ACLU lawyer who doesn't care what the merit of the production is?And that's the rub of this movie.  There's a lot of ideas floating around in Hamlet 2, but it often feels as if screenwriter Pam Brady (who shares writing credit on the South Park movie) continued to throw ideas on the wall, watching to see which of them stuck.  It's uneven in both the humor quotient and in the meaning quotient.  It poses too many questions to be just slapstick/no-brainer comedy, but it doesn't accurately dig into the questions to really merit it as satire (South Park, this ain't).In the end, it's a silly movie with sometimes hilarious moments, but more often than not, it fails to elicit much reaction.

1158732,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00188KD1E,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 1]","Hamlet 2 is bound to field comparisons to Napoleon Dynamite or the plenty of other films that have been made due to Napoleon's surprising success. It is comprised of similarly chaotic characters in unusual situations brought to a comedic extreme. Dysfunction and eccentricity are the fuel for Hamlet 2, but it takes the extra step other comparable comedies have reeled back from - the R-rating. Vulgar at times and offensive at others, it keeps up a steady flow of laughs with easy exploitations such as race and religion. And it is indeed funny.Hamlet 2 is set in the place where dreams go to die: Tucson, Arizona. Failed actor Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) has turned to teaching drama class as a means of survival, and must contend with being an utter failure at that as well. His former-drug-dealer wife (Catherine Keener) offers little stability to his turbulent life, in which Dana must deal with the possibility of being infertile, a harsh theater critic, overenthusiastic students, and a Principal who doesn't appreciate the fine arts.When the school electives are cut down, drama suddenly becomes the only choice, filling Dana's classroom with unruly and indocile students. As he somehow manages to draw talent out of the more irreverent students, a fiscal crisis hurls the arts programs onto the chopping block, and Drama class is shut down. But in a last attempt to nurture his own artistic struggles and the hidden talents of his ramshackle acting troupe, Dana writes and choreographs a highly controversial play. The sequel to Hamlet, Hamlet 2 focuses on undoing the tragedies that led to the principle players' deaths - with the help of a time machine, Jesus, and impulsive song and dance.Biting sarcasm and comical vulgarities hide the fact that few of the jokes are intelligent. Blatant racism and religious spoofs are easy methods of hilarity, and they ceaselessly level the audience with laughter and unease. There are serious bits of drama occasionally mixed in, but the characters are so unordinary that normal reactions can't possibly be anticipated. The power of booze, foul language, clich&eacute; media extravaganzas, bold offenses and oodles of enthusiasm make up for any lack of talent and the questionable editing of the film. Praise must be given to Steve Coogan who magnificently supports the entire film and keeps up viewer interest almost single-handedly.Narration and title cards are used (Act 4: Hope is a Demon Bitch), Elisabeth Shue shows up to play herself, and Amy Poehler unleashes the most cynical lines as her typical character (""I'm married to a Jew - I've got nothing to lose""). Some of the most rewarding moments are the unbelievably well-lighted and choreographed song and dance sequences during the play itself, and the many ramifications of desperately straying from the beaten path of decency. Aside from the extra special meaning to Arizona residents (Tucson is the butt of many a joke), Hamlet 2 is highly entertaining nonsense - perhaps as amusing as it is repellent to the easily offended.- Mike Massie",3,Hamlet 2 Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,3051,"['Hamlet', '2', 'bound', 'field', 'comparisons', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'plenty', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'due', 'Napoleon', 'surprising', 'success', 'comprised', 'similarly', 'chaotic', 'characters', 'unusual', 'situations', 'brought', 'comedic', 'extreme', 'Dysfunction', 'eccentricity', 'are', 'fuel', 'Hamlet', '2', 'extra', 'step', 'other', 'comparable', 'comedies', 'have', 'reeled', 'back', 'R-rating', 'Vulgar', 'times', 'offensive', 'others', 'up', 'steady', 'flow', 'laughs', 'easy', 'exploitations', 'such', 'race', 'religion', 'indeed', 'funny.Hamlet', '2', 'set', 'place', 'where', 'dreams', 'go', 'die', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'Failed', 'actor', 'Dana', 'Marschz', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'turned', 'teaching', 'drama', 'class', 'means', 'survival', 'must', 'contend', 'being', 'utter', 'failure', 'as', 'well', 'former-drug-dealer', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'little', 'stability', 'turbulent', 'life', 'Dana', 'must', 'deal', 'possibility', 'being', 'infertile', 'harsh', 'theater', 'critic', 'overenthusiastic', 'students', 'Principal', 'who', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'fine', 'arts.When', 'school', 'electives', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'drama', 'suddenly', 'only', 'choice', 'filling', 'Dana', 'classroom', 'unruly', 'indocile', 'students', 'draw', 'talent', 'more', 'irreverent', 'students', 'fiscal', 'crisis', 'hurls', 'arts', 'programs', 'chopping', 'block', 'Drama', 'class', 'shut', 'down', 'last', 'attempt', 'nurture', 'own', 'artistic', 'struggles', 'hidden', 'talents', 'ramshackle', 'acting', 'troupe', 'Dana', 'choreographs', 'highly', 'controversial', 'play', 'sequel', 'Hamlet', 'Hamlet', '2', 'focuses', 'undoing', 'tragedies', 'led', 'principle', 'players', 'deaths', 'help', 'time', 'machine', 'Jesus', 'impulsive', 'song', 'dance.Biting', 'sarcasm', 'comical', 'vulgarities', 'hide', 'fact', 'few', 'jokes', 'are', 'intelligent', 'Blatant', 'racism', 'religious', 'spoofs', 'are', 'easy', 'methods', 'hilarity', 'ceaselessly', 'level', 'audience', 'laughter', 'unease', 'are', 'serious', 'bits', 'drama', 'occasionally', 'mixed', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'unordinary', 'normal', 'reactions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'anticipated', 'power', 'booze', 'foul', 'language', 'clich', 'eacute', 'media', 'extravaganzas', 'bold', 'offenses', 'oodles', 'enthusiasm', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'talent', 'questionable', 'editing', 'film', 'Praise', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'who', 'magnificently', 'entire', 'film', 'up', 'viewer', 'interest', 'almost', 'single-handedly.Narration', 'title', 'cards', 'are', 'used', 'Act', '4', 'Hope', 'Demon', 'Bitch', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'up', 'play', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'most', 'cynical', 'lines', 'typical', 'character', ""'m"", 'married', 'Jew', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'lose', 'most', 'rewarding', 'moments', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'well-lighted', 'choreographed', 'song', 'dance', 'sequences', 'play', 'many', 'ramifications', 'desperately', 'straying', 'beaten', 'path', 'decency', 'Aside', 'extra', 'special', 'meaning', 'Arizona', 'residents', 'Tucson', 'butt', 'many', 'joke', 'Hamlet', '2', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'nonsense', 'perhaps', 'as', 'amusing', 'repellent', 'easily', 'offended.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",Hamlet 2 Theatrical Release
1158733,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00188KD1E,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 10]","""Hamlet 2"" stars Steve Coogan as Dana Marschz, a failed actor-turned-high-school drama teacher.  Low on the talent scale, Dana still has ambitions and harbors passions, but only at work.  At Tucson's West Mesa High School, Dana regards himself as an inspirational teacher, but his adaptations of popular films performed by his top students, Rand and Epiphany (Skylar Astin, Phoebe Strole), are not clicking.  When his latest effort, re-creating ""Erin Brockovich,"" is panned by the ninth grade drama critic and his department is targeted for elimination, Dana conceives a sequel to Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" a Busby Berkeley-style musical theatre extravaganza that will embrace neither political correctness nor dramatic credibility.""Hamlet 2"" is an amusing movie, but it's not easy to warm up to Coogan, who plays Dana as a loser deluding himself that he can spark students with lame notions of innovation.  As the film progresses, however, the viewer becomes involved in the outrageousness of plot turns and Dana's dedication to his art, however strange it may be.  Best thing in the film:  Amy Poehler as ACLU attorney Cricket Feldstein.
