1503106,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B005T5OCLY,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 9]","This 90-minute DVD from PBS is somewhat misnamed, but still a fine, entertaining performance.PBS station WCTE in Cookeville, TN recorded a series of concerts in the ""Volcano Room"" at Cumberland Caverns, 333 feet below ground level. The DVD collects excerpts from performances by 10 musicians or bands that best fall under the title ""Americana"". A few are what can best be described as ""bluegrass"", including the well-known Ricky Skaggs and the family group Cherryholmes. Singer/songwriter Darrell Scott and Steve Earle's son Justin Townes Earle (both of who I love) are better classed as ""Americana"". The young band 18 South mixes country and bluegrass, while Will Hoge is closer to rock than anything.Based on the age of both his appearance and the song her performs, I'm guessing that - even though this DVD is dated 2011, the JT Earle clip was recorded about four years ago. I couldn't identify the others.The performances were recorded with a live audience and it's sort of neat to see the rocks of the Caverns in the background, but because the musicians are so well miked, I'm not sure it makes the sound any better, or different. There are no real introductions; the performer is identified by a title on the screen. So there's no filler here.I enjoyed seeing artists I know and love (If you haven't seen the whitest Black Gospel singer ever - Mike Farris - this is your chance!) But I also discovered some new ones.I - for one - would love to see a follow up to this DVD.I hope you found this review informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"More ""Americana"" than Bluegrass but 90-minutes with no filler played (really) down-under",1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,1565,"['90-minute', 'DVD', 'PBS', 'somewhat', 'misnamed', 'still', 'fine', 'entertaining', 'performance.PBS', 'station', 'WCTE', 'Cookeville', 'TN', 'recorded', 'series', 'concerts', 'Volcano', 'Room', 'Cumberland', 'Caverns', '333', 'feet', 'ground', 'level', 'DVD', 'collects', 'excerpts', 'performances', '10', 'musicians', 'bands', 'best', 'fall', 'title', 'Americana', 'few', 'are', 'what', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'bluegrass', 'including', 'well-known', 'Ricky', 'Skaggs', 'family', 'group', 'Cherryholmes', 'Singer/songwriter', 'Darrell', 'Scott', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'son', 'Justin', 'Townes', 'Earle', 'who', 'love', 'are', 'better', 'classed', 'Americana', 'young', 'band', '18', 'South', 'mixes', 'country', 'bluegrass', 'Will', 'Hoge', 'closer', 'rock', 'anything.Based', 'age', 'appearance', 'song', 'performs', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'even', 'DVD', 'dated', '2011', 'JT', 'Earle', 'clip', 'was', 'recorded', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'identify', 'others.The', 'performances', 'were', 'recorded', 'live', 'audience', 'sort', 'neat', 'see', 'rocks', 'Caverns', 'background', 'musicians', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'miked', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'sound', 'better', 'different', 'are', 'real', 'introductions', 'performer', 'identified', 'title', 'screen', 'filler', 'here.I', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'artists', 'know', 'love', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'whitest', 'Black', 'Gospel', 'singer', 'ever', 'Mike', 'Farris', 'chance', 'also', 'discovered', 'new', 'ones.I', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'follow', 'up', 'DVD.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Best of Bluegrass Underground
