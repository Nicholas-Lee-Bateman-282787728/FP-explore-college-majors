Second of all, why bother?At worst, this is a lame fantasy complete with magic and lessons to be learned (not the least of which is why you don't put lighted candles on a Christmas tree!).  It's earnest but a tad too simplistic.  Life just doesn't work like this and why should it?  You want a new mom, get your dad to start dating, don't go wishing on a dummy in a store.

1206579,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B001JOXWD8,J. Olsen,"[2, 4]","The story follows a young girl, Jessica, whose mother died years ago. She envies the others girls who have moms to take them shopping and talk about girl things. At a department store wishing well she encounters an ""employee"" (played by Doris Roberts) who is more likely an angel of some sort. She helps Jessica get her wish to have a Mom for Christmas. She sends mannequin-turned-human Amy (Olivia Newton-John) to Jessica's home, where she poses as the housekeeper Jessica's father was intending to hire. There is some humor as you see Amy adjust to being human. Of course, Jessica's father begins to fall for the beautiful stranger, but she causes some major chaos in their lives. She is only supposed to be there for the holiday, and when she has complicated things by causing a fire, being picked up for suspected shoplifting and embarrassing Jessica in front of friends, she decides they would be better off without her and returns to the department store. When it is discovered that she has left them they set off to try and get her back, but can they overcome the magic that was only to work for Christmas?When my children were young we had taped this from the TV and frequently enjoyed it over the holidays. As they got older it was a little too corny for them. But if your kids are young it is a good family Christmas fantasy, with a little romance thrown in. I think Doris Roberts turns in the strongest performance, but my favorite scene is in the department store after hours when Amy is trying to get her mannequin friend to drive a car that is on display so that they can go get a Christmas tree.
