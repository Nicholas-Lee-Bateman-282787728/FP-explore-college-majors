By this measure, ""Live at Blenheim"" is a smash success.  I was most impressed by the energy, enthusiasm, and obvious passion Jamie Cullum displays throughout the show.  Though he's dressed more like a roadie than a performer, he charms the audience with his unbridled love of music of all types.Right from the start, on ""I Get a Kick Out of You"", he shows himself as both a hyperactive, brash youth, as well as a deft jazz pianist who certainly ""has got chops"".  At one moment he's jumping off the grand piano, and a bit later he running to the piano to crank out an incredible solo.  This sort of bipolar persona reminds me of (forgive me for the odd example!) how the mood of an old Marx Brothers movie suddenly changes when Harpo sat down at his harp.  I suppose that is why I am more impressed by his performance on the quieter, more heartfelt tunes like ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" and especially the final song ""But For Now"".Jamie Cullum admits that he never felt fully comfortable as a grunge rocker like Kurt Cobain or playing straight ahead jazz while dressed in a suit and tie.  And so he forges ahead, carving out a unique identity that respects jazz tradition, yet is infused with the spirit of rock and roll.  The youthfulness he conveys, in my mind, is not distracting.  Instead, I see this as a starting point, and I look forward to watching how his music evolves over the years ahead.",5,"If you like Twentysomething, you'll love this DVD",1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1506,"['mark', 'good', 'music', 'DVD', 'when', 'viewer', 'better', 'understanding', 'artist', 'measure', 'Live', 'Blenheim', 'smash', 'success', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'obvious', 'passion', 'Jamie', 'Cullum', 'displays', 'show', 'dressed', 'more', 'roadie', 'performer', 'audience', 'unbridled', 'love', 'music', 'types.Right', 'start', 'Get', 'Kick', 'Out', 'hyperactive', 'brash', 'youth', 'as', 'well', 'deft', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'who', 'certainly', 'got', 'chops', 'one', 'moment', 'jumping', 'off', 'grand', 'piano', 'bit', 'later', 'running', 'piano', 'crank', 'out', 'incredible', 'solo', 'sort', 'bipolar', 'persona', 'forgive', 'odd', 'example', 'how', 'mood', 'old', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'when', 'Harpo', 'sat', 'down', 'harp', 'suppose', 'why', 'am', 'more', 'impressed', 'performance', 'quieter', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'tunes', 'What', 'Difference', 'Day', 'Makes', 'especially', 'final', 'song', 'Now', '.Jamie', 'Cullum', 'never', 'felt', 'fully', 'comfortable', 'grunge', 'rocker', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'playing', 'straight', 'ahead', 'jazz', 'dressed', 'suit', 'tie', 'so', 'ahead', 'carving', 'out', 'unique', 'identity', 'jazz', 'tradition', 'infused', 'spirit', 'rock', 'roll', 'youthfulness', 'mind', 'not', 'distracting', 'Instead', 'see', 'starting', 'point', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'how', 'music', 'years', 'ahead']",N/A

860946,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B000654YWE,Brittany Rose,"[10, 11]","If you are a fan of Jamie Cullum's modern-jazzish-cover style then you must pick up this dvd.  I first found out about it on Jamie's website a few months ago and recently spotted it here in Canada, so I immediately picked up a copy.The main feature of this dvd is a quite long concert, between 90 to 120 minutes I believe, taking you through a long list of Jamie's repertoire from twighlight at Blenheim Palace (a picturesque castle with rolling greens and elegant architecture) to midnight.The concert is simply amazing though - covering virtually all of the tracks on Jamie's ""Twentysomething"" album with a few extras thrown in, including a Beach Boys cover, ""Old Devil Moon"", and ""Why Do Today What You Can Do Tomorrow"".  I think the exceptional thing about the show is Jamie's style of performance - he swaps instruments throughout the night, as does his exceptional band, and he is probably one of the most energetic performers I've ever seen.  He not only plays the piano, he uses it as a stage, a dance floor, a prop, and a percussion instrument on several occasions.Interspursed throughout the show is a number of mini-featurettes which have interviews and clips of performances of Jamie as he tours around the world (mostly through America).Basically if you think you won't have a chance to see Jamie (as I fear I might not) live, then pick thsi up.  If you liked his album, pick this up.  His vocals are just as strong on the dvd as on his album (which isn't surprising given the album is recorded in analog format).  The nice thing is he adds fun spins to the songs and you get to see what parts he sings and how he does them live.Let's not forget the special features - check out a few more mini-featurettes including Jamie and his bass player and drummer from the show busking in San Francisco (nobody stops by unfortunately).  Also there are 3 music videos of Jamie and a featurette on the making of ""Wind Cries Mary"".  I only wish he'd released ""High and Dry"" as a single.Highlights of the concert?  The first three songs blew me away, plus ""High and Dry"" because I love it, and ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" is just as romantic sung in person - if not more so - then on Jamie's cd.All in all - a great dvd - a bargain price for what you're getting - pick it up today!",5,Must-Have For Jamie Fans!,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,2285,"['are', 'fan', 'Jamie', 'Cullum', 'modern-jazzish-cover', 'style', 'then', 'must', 'pick', 'up', 'dvd', 'first', 'found', 'out', 'Jamie', 'website', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'recently', 'spotted', 'here', 'Canada', 'immediately', 'picked', 'up', 'copy.The', 'main', 'feature', 'dvd', 'quite', 'long', 'concert', '90', '120', 'minutes', 'believe', 'taking', 'long', 'list', 'Jamie', 'repertoire', 'twighlight', 'Blenheim', 'Palace', 'picturesque', 'castle', 'rolling', 'greens', 'elegant', 'architecture', 'midnight.The', 'concert', 'simply', 'amazing', 'covering', 'virtually', 'tracks', 'Jamie', 'Twentysomething', 'album', 'few', 'extras', 'thrown', 'including', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'cover', 'Old', 'Devil', 'Moon', 'Why', 'Do', 'Today', 'What', 'Can', 'Do', 'Tomorrow', 'think', 'exceptional', 'thing', 'show', 'Jamie', 'style', 'performance', 'instruments', 'night', 'exceptional', 'band', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'energetic', 'performers', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'only', 'piano', 'stage', 'dance', 'floor', 'prop', 'percussion', 'instrument', 'several', 'occasions.Interspursed', 'show', 'number', 'mini-featurettes', 'have', 'interviews', 'clips', 'performances', 'Jamie', 'world', 'mostly', 'America', '.Basically', 'think', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'Jamie', 'fear', 'might', 'not', 'live', 'then', 'pick', 'thsi', 'up', 'liked', 'album', 'pick', 'up', 'vocals', 'are', 'just', 'strong', 'dvd', 'album', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'given', 'album', 'recorded', 'analog', 'format', 'nice', 'thing', 'fun', 'spins', 'songs', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'parts', 'how', 'live.Let', 'not', 'forget', 'special', 'features', 'check', 'out', 'few', 'more', 'mini-featurettes', 'including', 'Jamie', 'bass', 'player', 'drummer', 'show', 'busking', 'San', 'Francisco', 'nobody', 'stops', 'unfortunately', 'Also', 'are', '3', 'music', 'videos', 'Jamie', 'featurette', 'making', 'Wind', 'Cries', 'Mary', 'only', 'wish', ""'d"", 'released', 'High', 'Dry', 'single.Highlights', 'concert', 'first', 'three', 'songs', 'blew', 'away', 'High', 'Dry', 'love', 'What', 'Difference', 'Day', 'Makes', 'just', 'romantic', 'sung', 'person', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'then', 'Jamie', 'cd.All', 'great', 'dvd', 'bargain', 'price', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'pick', 'up', 'today']",N/A
860947,AMPW2XLJQISVZ,B000654YWE,"Cory B. ""Ronnie Milsap""","[4, 4]","I am 64 year old woman who saw Jamie Cullum in Phoenix Arizona in May 2006. It was a small venue that was more up close and personal than a large venue would have been. I would probably have never heard of him if not for a local jazz radio station here in Phoenix that has since gone off the air. I liked him right away and thought he was different from the rest of the artists being played.After seeing him in person I became an even bigger fan than before. It was the best concert I have ever seen and he gave 100% during the show. Jamie was in total command of the stage and the audience the whole night. He has so much energy and can go on for three hours without stopping! He takes jazz music and performs it with the excitement and energy of a rock concert which is why he appeals to fans of all ages. The show I attended had a mixture of younger and older people in the crowd and he captivated them all. Micheal Buble has a better singing voice and seems to be better known in America, but Jamie's songwriting, piano playing, arranging skills, and great showmanship make him the greater talent by far. He is the most talented and charismatic musician out there today and deserves the same superstar status here in America that he has in the UK.I bought this DVD before seeing him in concert and liked it very much. The best part of the video for me are the moments where he involves the audience in the show, encouraging everyone to sing along. I'm also impressed by the fact that Jamie doesn't have to rely on being vulgar to entertain his audience like so many rock stars his age do. Jamie proves in this DVD that when you have this much talent you don't need anything else to please an audience. This is a concert video that the whole family can enjoy.Everyone I've talked to about Jamie has never heard of him. You never hear him played on the radio and rarely see him on television here in the states, but all his shows are sold out everywhere he plays in America. How is this possible? I think it is a shame that Jamie doesn't get played on the radio when people with only half his talent get played everyday. Oh well, I guess talent has gone out of style here in the 21st century. If you are not lucky enough to have seen him in person, ""Live at Blenheim Palace"" is a must-have to get the full effect of Jaime Cullum in concert!Glenda Ellis",5,A great DVD from the greatest young talent in music today,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,2354,"['am', '64', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'saw', 'Jamie', 'Cullum', 'Phoenix', 'Arizona', 'May', '2006', 'was', 'small', 'venue', 'was', 'more', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'large', 'venue', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'not', 'local', 'jazz', 'radio', 'station', 'here', 'Phoenix', 'gone', 'air', 'liked', 'right', 'away', 'thought', 'was', 'different', 'rest', 'artists', 'being', 'played.After', 'seeing', 'person', 'became', 'even', 'bigger', 'fan', 'before', 'was', 'best', 'concert', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'gave', '100', '%', 'show', 'Jamie', 'was', 'total', 'command', 'stage', 'audience', 'whole', 'night', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'can', 'go', 'three', 'hours', 'stopping', 'jazz', 'music', 'performs', 'excitement', 'energy', 'rock', 'concert', 'why', 'appeals', 'fans', 'ages', 'show', 'attended', 'had', 'mixture', 'younger', 'older', 'people', 'crowd', 'captivated', 'Micheal', 'Buble', 'better', 'singing', 'voice', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'America', 'Jamie', 'songwriting', 'piano', 'playing', 'arranging', 'skills', 'great', 'showmanship', 'make', 'greater', 'talent', 'far', 'most', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'musician', 'there', 'today', 'same', 'superstar', 'status', 'here', 'America', 'UK.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'concert', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'best', 'part', 'video', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'audience', 'show', 'encouraging', 'everyone', 'sing', 'along', ""'m"", 'also', 'impressed', 'fact', 'Jamie', ""n't"", 'have', 'rely', 'being', 'vulgar', 'entertain', 'audience', 'so', 'many', 'rock', 'stars', 'age', 'do', 'Jamie', 'DVD', 'when', 'have', 'much', 'talent', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'anything', 'else', 'please', 'audience', 'concert', 'video', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy.Everyone', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'Jamie', 'never', 'heard', 'never', 'hear', 'played', 'radio', 'rarely', 'see', 'television', 'here', 'states', 'shows', 'are', 'sold', 'out', 'everywhere', 'America', 'How', 'possible', 'think', 'shame', 'Jamie', ""n't"", 'get', 'played', 'radio', 'when', 'people', 'only', 'talent', 'get', 'played', 'everyday', 'Oh', 'well', 'guess', 'talent', 'gone', 'style', 'here', '21st', 'century', 'are', 'not', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'person', 'Live', 'Blenheim', 'Palace', 'must-have', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'Jaime', 'Cullum', 'concert', 'Glenda', 'Ellis']",N/A

MESSINA,"[15, 15]","A jaw-droppingly wonderful, absolutely breathtaking performance by Jamie, his excellent fellow trio members Geoff Gascoyne and Sebastiaan deKromm, and a complement of talented side musicians.Although I've owned this DVD for a couple of months now (and have watched at least parts of it close to every day, on some days more than once), I wanted to wait until after I'd had the chance to see Jamie perform live before commenting on the recording.  Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to attend one of two sold-out U.S. concerts scheduled around the launch date of Jamie's new CD, ""Catching Tales"" (also simply wonderful).  That show was spectacular, and although the small, standing-room-only club, holding a few hundred people at most, was a venue very different from that on the DVD, the Blenheim concert recording does a terrific job of capturing the spirit, energy, and sheer enjoyment to be found watching Jamie and company perform.The show is about to begin; Jamie saunters onstage, salutes the audience, starts to sing the first number, ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" - and that's it, you're hooked for two hours, no possibility of escape, not that you'd want to.  I've never seen a performer grab one's attention as thoroughly as does Jamie: you simply can't take your eyes - much less ears - off him.The music is sublime, the photography is superb, and the sound is of CD quality; the DVD extras are pretty neat, too, including a fascinating glimpse of an early version of an apparently then-unfinished song - performed on a San Francisco street, no less, using a guitar case for percussion and a discarded sofa as a prop - that turns up in the concert filmed a month or so later in its final, hauntingly beautiful form.Just a fabulous DVD from a magnificent musician and performer - get it, turn it on, and enjoy.  (And by the way, if you want more - and I'm pretty sure you will - Jamie & co. are planning a U.S. tour for early in 2006; check his web site periodically for updates.)EDIT, 8/15/07:  Thirteen live Jamie gigs later, I have to say that as wonderful as this DVD is - still DEFINITELY worth owning and watching - Jamie has come SO far musically in the three years since it was recorded, that a new DVD is LONG overdue.
