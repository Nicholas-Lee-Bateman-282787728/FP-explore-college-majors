The first part of the movie is about the men getting to know eachother then having sex.  The other half is about the one man trying to eat the other.  I am not offended by the gore or nature of the film....the reason for the sad review is that this film is BORING!!

Hell, it's probably (I can't tell for sure because I was really tired when I watched it) the most disturbing movie I have ever seen and I've seen all of the movies that people consider disturbing! The fact that someone was crazy enough to want to eat someone alive and that someone was crazy enough to want to be eaten alive is *beep* scary! What makes someone THAT crazy? I'd really like to know. I know that most of the times it's something that happened when they were young, but what could make someone feel like eating his own dick and sharing it with someone? Those events just prove that (some) humans are way worse than any animal... Anyway, this movie shows EVERYTHING! It's very graphic, realistic and disgusting! There's almost no dialogue (a good thing because the dubbing is so bad that it's funny), the soundtrack is really weird and it just makes everything even more disturbing! I felt sick even when there was nothing sick to see! It feels a bit like Schramm, but it's way more disturbing! You want to be entertained? DON'T watch this movie! You want to feel sick?

Watching Cannibal reminded me how real violence can be, but at the same time it showed me that in certain circumstances violence is merely part of a bigger picture. This film does indeed play out like a love story of sorts. The two men frolic together for a couple days, drinking wine, playing outdoors, sex etc. They are not monsters, just two people with deeply morbid desires. While there is no question that what the two men wanted was morally corrupt to the modern world, to them it was passionate. Sometimes love can be grotesque, and Cannibal confirms this I think. Yes, I was grossed out, but when the film ended I sympathized with both men. Do I agree with their urges? No way. But I'm human and can recognize that we are all flawed creatures regardless of blaming nature OR nurture. Normally I have a ball watching a bloody horror film, but I watched Cannibal with a very open mind, and delt with the uncomfortable scenes to get the bigger picture. I watched this movie as if I was trying to learn something from it, instead of just taking it for what it is and reveling in the gore/violence like I usually do. So yeah, I guess I'm saying all this b/c I wonder if anyone else saw where I was coming from. Regardless, this case study on Armin Meiwes is very graphic, heavy on homosexual content, but is a very riveting film. I recommend it to someone with an open mind AND a strong stomache.

1026973,A3V99DW4SXDDH2,B000JJSJ82,Horror Freek,"[3, 3]","Cannibal- A film by Marian Dora, starring Carsten Frank, Tobias Sickert and Victor Brandl. Run time: 89 min. Language: English. This film documents the events that took place in 2003 when an ad was placed via the internet for a subject willing to be voluntarily consumed. The ad received a response and all the shocking events were captured on video tape, which were actually used for evidence at the trial. There are warnings on the front and the reverse of this DVD case cautioning viewers of it's extreme content and graphic violence and now, believe me I know, a lot of films have done the same thing, but let me assure you that this one delivers.This film allows the viewers to emotionally connect with the demented storyline, the mentally unstable actors and then absolutely disgusts them at the same time (Very well done!). The GRAPHIC imagery is unforgettable, brutal and absolutely mesmerizing. This film is NOT easy to watch and will certainly have the viewers very, very uneasy, repulsed, sickened and even possibly wishing that they had not sat through the entirety of this picture. There are far few too many films that leave and aftershock like this one does and the thing that will really haunt you is that this was based on actual events, not a group of writers trying to create the next gross-out flick of the year.This film documents the lives and deaths of two of the most depraved individuals to ever walk the face of the earth and like my title says, if you think you can handle it you are in for a real treat. Just be very aware that the images set forth in this film will linger inside you for a long time to come and to the fragile few who might attempt to view this out of pure curiosity, you will surely regret it!5 stars for turning acts so utterly vile into something almost beautiful and I must say that I was extremely impressed, shocked and quiet caught off guard with this film and still find myself thinking about it from time to time (aftershocks!). Definitely view this film with caution (graphic scenes of cannibalism, violence, gore, male intercourse and brutality) and yes, the sour feeling in your stomach and in between your legs will eventually fade away!",5,CAN YOU HANDLE IT?,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,2196,"['Cannibal-', 'A', 'film', 'Marian', 'Dora', 'starring', 'Carsten', 'Frank', 'Tobias', 'Sickert', 'Victor', 'Brandl', 'Run', 'time', '89', 'min', 'Language', 'English', 'film', 'documents', 'events', 'took', 'place', '2003', 'when', 'ad', 'was', 'placed', 'internet', 'subject', 'willing', 'be', 'voluntarily', 'consumed', 'ad', 'received', 'response', 'shocking', 'events', 'were', 'captured', 'video', 'tape', 'were', 'actually', 'used', 'evidence', 'trial', 'are', 'warnings', 'front', 'reverse', 'DVD', 'case', 'cautioning', 'viewers', 'extreme', 'content', 'graphic', 'violence', 'now', 'believe', 'know', 'lot', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'thing', 'let', 'assure', 'one', 'delivers.This', 'film', 'viewers', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'demented', 'storyline', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'actors', 'then', 'absolutely', 'same', 'time', 'Very', 'well', 'done', 'GRAPHIC', 'imagery', 'unforgettable', 'brutal', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'NOT', 'easy', 'watch', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'viewers', 'very', 'very', 'uneasy', 'repulsed', 'sickened', 'even', 'possibly', 'wishing', 'had', 'not', 'sat', 'entirety', 'picture', 'are', 'far', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'leave', 'aftershock', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'really', 'haunt', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'not', 'group', 'writers', 'trying', 'create', 'next', 'gross-out', 'flick', 'year.This', 'film', 'documents', 'lives', 'deaths', 'two', 'most', 'depraved', 'individuals', 'ever', 'walk', 'face', 'earth', 'title', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'Just', 'be', 'very', 'aware', 'images', 'set', 'forth', 'film', 'will', 'linger', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'fragile', 'few', 'who', 'might', 'attempt', 'view', 'out', 'pure', 'curiosity', 'will', 'surely', 'regret', '5', 'stars', 'turning', 'acts', 'so', 'utterly', 'vile', 'something', 'almost', 'beautiful', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'shocked', 'quiet', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'film', 'still', 'find', 'thinking', 'time', 'time', 'aftershocks', 'Definitely', 'view', 'film', 'caution', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'cannibalism', 'violence', 'gore', 'male', 'intercourse', 'brutality', 'yes', 'sour', 'feeling', 'stomach', 'legs', 'will', 'eventually', 'fade', 'away']",Cannibal

Bad enough.  And then they released a video of the procedure.

I felt guilty as hell for watching this, like I should have been trying to help, though in reality, he was dead before I ever watched the video.

But Cannibal made me feel that same kind of guilt I'd felt watching the beheading.

1026976,A9LYWWG985U62,B000JJSJ82,maciora,"[3, 5]","Watching this film is quite an odd experience. On the one hand, ""Cannibal"" is a very amateur affair.From a technical point of view, it appears to be shot on DV and transferred to 24fps.The storytelling at the beginning is frustrating. Blandly sophomoric with overly long takes, overuse of close ups, forcefully lingering on irrelevant details - the cumulative effect of which points to poor writing. The play of events is a by-the-numbers copy of the reported facts, verbatim. In fact, reading Lois Jones' ""Cannibal,"" seems to bear this out since it mirrors the movie very accurately. The movie places moody bridges between the reported moments where we see the protagonist struggling or reveling with feelings or wandering around town, looking for love. All of this is shown with no sense of filmic structure and almost entirely without dialogue. All of this sounds terrible and, to be blunt, the beginning of the film, while accurate, is not worth mentioning.But what the film lacks in storytelling flair, it more than makes up for in its depiction of the key events, which are ghastly in the extreme and quite explicit. The attention to gore and detail is stomach-turningly impressive. It should be added that the performance of how these two men actually went about killing and being killed has the desperate, awkward stamp of authenticity to it; the actors achieve a haunting, passionate fervor. Also, the sexual nature of their relationship is captured in a way that the news reports could not approach. A good deal of screen time in the second half of the film is given to the complex texture of their very physical relationship, sexual and otherwise. It seems perverse and insane, yet resonates as true somehow. While there is no exploration as to the nature of either men's internal cues, the film displays the horrifying aftermath in detail. There is real curiosity given to the ambivalence that the protagonist has about flesh, organs and blood.What I found most impressive about ""Cannibal"" was perhaps unintended - it looked simply awful, in every way.Had a more accomplished crew made this film, it may have achieved glossy or professional sheen (like Hostel, for example) and reduced Messrs Miewes and Brandes' appalling ordeal into commercial horror. As it is, the aesthetic result translates into art quite well. i.e., It is difficult/contradictory/message-less - easier than a commercial film to read as metaphor, as well as its effective display of pathological attachment/need since there is no ""character-arc"" grafted on to it.  It also shuns overt commercial appeal while remaining compelling.Thankfully, it also seems impossible to imagine a sequel.",4,A weirdly effective achievement,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,2671,"['Watching', 'film', 'quite', 'odd', 'experience', 'one', 'hand', 'Cannibal', 'very', 'amateur', 'technical', 'point', 'view', 'be', 'shot', 'DV', 'transferred', '24fps.The', 'storytelling', 'beginning', 'frustrating', 'Blandly', 'sophomoric', 'overly', 'long', 'overuse', 'close', 'ups', 'forcefully', 'lingering', 'irrelevant', 'details', 'cumulative', 'effect', 'points', 'poor', 'writing', 'play', 'events', 'by-the-numbers', 'copy', 'reported', 'facts', 'verbatim', 'fact', 'reading', 'Lois', 'Jones', 'Cannibal', 'bear', 'out', 'movie', 'very', 'accurately', 'movie', 'places', 'moody', 'reported', 'moments', 'where', 'see', 'protagonist', 'struggling', 'reveling', 'feelings', 'wandering', 'around', 'town', 'looking', 'love', 'shown', 'sense', 'filmic', 'structure', 'almost', 'entirely', 'dialogue', 'terrible', 'be', 'blunt', 'beginning', 'film', 'accurate', 'not', 'worth', 'mentioning.But', 'what', 'film', 'storytelling', 'flair', 'more', 'up', 'depiction', 'key', 'events', 'are', 'ghastly', 'extreme', 'quite', 'explicit', 'attention', 'gore', 'detail', 'stomach-turningly', 'impressive', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'performance', 'how', 'two', 'men', 'actually', 'went', 'killing', 'being', 'killed', 'desperate', 'awkward', 'stamp', 'authenticity', 'actors', 'achieve', 'haunting', 'passionate', 'fervor', 'Also', 'sexual', 'nature', 'relationship', 'captured', 'way', 'news', 'reports', 'could', 'not', 'approach', 'good', 'deal', 'screen', 'time', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'given', 'complex', 'texture', 'very', 'physical', 'relationship', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'perverse', 'insane', 'yet', 'true', 'somehow', 'exploration', 'nature', 'men', 'internal', 'cues', 'film', 'horrifying', 'aftermath', 'detail', 'real', 'curiosity', 'given', 'ambivalence', 'protagonist', 'flesh', 'organs', 'blood.What', 'found', 'most', 'impressive', 'Cannibal', 'was', 'perhaps', 'unintended', 'looked', 'simply', 'awful', 'way.Had', 'more', 'accomplished', 'crew', 'made', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'achieved', 'glossy', 'professional', 'sheen', 'Hostel', 'example', 'reduced', 'Messrs', 'Miewes', 'Brandes', 'appalling', 'ordeal', 'commercial', 'horror', 'aesthetic', 'result', 'translates', 'art', 'quite', 'well', 'i.e.', 'difficult/contradictory/message-less', 'easier', 'commercial', 'film', 'read', 'metaphor', 'as', 'well', 'effective', 'display', 'pathological', 'attachment/need', 'character-arc', 'grafted', 'also', 'overt', 'commercial', 'appeal', 'remaining', 'compelling.Thankfully', 'also', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'sequel']",Cannibal

But here I go, because this one just BEGS to be reviewed.This film basically tells the story of two men, one a cannibal, one his willing meal(s).  It's a character study, not a suspense or thriller film, so don't expect a lot of action or edge-of-your-seat excitement.  Don't expect much dialogue, either, as almost nothing is spoken through the entire film.Maybe more should have been said, because despite the subject matter, the generous frontal nudity, the horrifying 3rd act, and a minimalist overall approach that can work wonders in better hands, Cannibal is ultimately just a bore.  Rarely do I look at the clock during a movie, but at the 30 minute mark I was talking to the screen (""Will someone please DO something!"") and checking the time (""Man, another 50 minutes left?"").The actual cannibalism is disgusting, especially the entire sequence from where the cannibal begins sawing off a part of the ""meat's"" anatomy to when they both eat it.Yet when the cannibalism does finally kick in, it's completely inconsistent with dialogue earlier in the film.  The ""meat"" says early on that ""I don't want to suffer"", yet he's clearly in agony during and after that first bit of him is cut off and consumed.  With barely a dozen lines of dialogue, you'd expect one of the film's most important lines to carry some weight.  And when they eat, the cannibal guy can't do it.  What gives?  He ends up looking like a cannibal wannabe.The camera work is annoying, unless you're a fan of painful closeups where the camera is so close to the actor's face that you can see to the bottom of his pores.  And these closeups are sprinkled throughout, not just gross-out closeups of chewing.  It's done for art's sake, and fails.  This trick almost never works, and I don't want to see an unattractive man's cheeks from one inch away.To try to sum this up, I'd have to say this:  Cannibal is an atmospheric, unsettling, and brave film.  It's also dull as dishwater and inconsistent.  Maybe that's how it really happened, but this isn't a documentary, it's a film and therefore needs to be internally consistent.  If you're in it just for the gross-out last 1/2 hour, then by all means buy it and fast forward through the first 50 minutes.

1026984,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,B000JJSJ82,Tristan,"[6, 6]","Cannibal is a cinematic interpretation of the true story of two insane German men who met on the internet and then allowed one to cannibalize the other on film. The film depicts these two men as very lonely and mysterious men who act generally very normal in public. When they are alone together, they are like mad dogs who are obsessed with each other. They are constantly having sex and they grope each other almost nonstop. The entire first hour of the film consists of these two men meeting each other, having sex, and doing weird stuff. The last part of the film shows the long and drawn out process of one cannibalizing the other. As you can probably tell by my description, this film may or may not be your cup of tea. I personally found it to be a very effectively done piece with some really good ideas and some truly unique visuals. However, the film is not without it's flaws. The problems I have with this film mostly have to do with the technical quality of the film. I liked the way that this was shot. Much of the film is dimly lit, and I liked this approach to the violent scenes in particular. However, I despised the way it was edited. The constant fade-outs and the weird zooms made it feel too much like a Nine Inch Nails music video. It gave the film an unneeded sense of style that I felt took away from the dark mood of the picture. In addition to that, the film is really really badly dubbed into English and it comes off incredibly distracting during some of the more dramatic scenes. One of the character's voices sounds way too high pitched and it's unintentionally funny and weird. I also wasn't a big fan of the mid-section of the film where the characters were just frolicking around. After a while it feels somewhat trite and redundant. Approximately 85% of the shots in this film show either penises or asscheeks, so if you're uncomfortable with watching male nudity, do not watch this film. The one major problem I have with the film is the way it opens. I liked it, but it goes on far too long. Basically the opening depicts the childhood of the main character who cannibalizes the other man. It shows him having a story read to him by his mom, but it's so slow and it just hammers it's implied symbolism too hard. I think that Marian Dora, if he is going to make another film, needs to try and be more subtle with his symbolism. Cannibal is still an effective film, however, and it has a lot to do with the way the story is presented. The man who ends up being digested is depicted as being rather sinister and sneering. At times, he comes off incredibly vampiric. This helps the audience grow more accustomed to the situation and allows us to identify more with the man who cannibalizes him, which was an interesting direction for the film to go in. I especially liked the scenes where they are driving on the road, which allows the exposition to not get in the way of the situation that these two men put themselves in. They are normal looking people, which I also appreciated being emphasized. It made the film a lot more scary to show more of the normal behavior of the characters. They look like two random men you would see out on the street in everyday life. I can understand how this would make viewers uncomfortable, but I found it an admirable path for the film to take. When the cannibalism does happen, it's some of the goriest violence you will ever see. To call this film gory as hell wouldn't nearly be doing it justice. This is, no doubt, one of the goriest films ever made. This not only contains the blood and the gore and the guts and the bones, but also all the other bodily fluids that nobody would ever take into account. The urine, the cum, the feces, the vomit, and the pus are all put on display and shoved into the faces of the audience. This is a disgusting, rotten, horrible film, but it is also one of the more fearless true crime exploration films I've seen and I admire it for that alone.",3,"Brutal and artistic, but not without it's flaws",1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,3954,"['Cannibal', 'cinematic', 'interpretation', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'insane', 'German', 'men', 'who', 'met', 'internet', 'then', 'allowed', 'one', 'cannibalize', 'other', 'film', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'very', 'lonely', 'mysterious', 'men', 'who', 'act', 'generally', 'very', 'normal', 'public', 'When', 'are', 'alone', 'together', 'are', 'mad', 'dogs', 'who', 'are', 'obsessed', 'other', 'are', 'constantly', 'having', 'sex', 'grope', 'other', 'almost', 'nonstop', 'entire', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'meeting', 'other', 'having', 'sex', 'doing', 'weird', 'stuff', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'process', 'one', 'cannibalizing', 'other', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'description', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'personally', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'effectively', 'done', 'piece', 'really', 'good', 'ideas', 'truly', 'unique', 'visuals', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'problems', 'have', 'film', 'mostly', 'have', 'do', 'technical', 'quality', 'film', 'liked', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'Much', 'film', 'dimly', 'lit', 'liked', 'approach', 'violent', 'scenes', 'particular', 'However', 'despised', 'way', 'was', 'edited', 'constant', 'fade-outs', 'weird', 'zooms', 'made', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'music', 'video', 'gave', 'film', 'unneeded', 'sense', 'style', 'felt', 'took', 'away', 'dark', 'mood', 'picture', 'addition', 'film', 'really', 'really', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'English', 'off', 'incredibly', 'distracting', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'One', 'character', 'voices', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'pitched', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'weird', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'mid-section', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'frolicking', 'around', 'while', 'somewhat', 'trite', 'redundant', 'Approximately', '85', '%', 'shots', 'film', 'show', 'penises', 'asscheeks', 'so', ""'re"", 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'male', 'nudity', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'film', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'way', 'liked', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Basically', 'opening', 'childhood', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'other', 'man', 'having', 'story', 'read', 'mom', 'so', 'slow', 'just', 'implied', 'symbolism', 'too', 'hard', 'think', 'Marian', 'Dora', 'going', 'make', 'film', 'try', 'be', 'more', 'subtle', 'symbolism', 'Cannibal', 'still', 'effective', 'film', 'however', 'lot', 'do', 'way', 'story', 'presented', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'digested', 'depicted', 'being', 'rather', 'sinister', 'sneering', 'times', 'off', 'incredibly', 'vampiric', 'audience', 'grow', 'more', 'accustomed', 'situation', 'identify', 'more', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'interesting', 'direction', 'film', 'go', 'especially', 'liked', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'driving', 'road', 'exposition', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'situation', 'two', 'men', 'put', 'are', 'normal', 'looking', 'people', 'also', 'appreciated', 'being', 'emphasized', 'made', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'scary', 'show', 'more', 'normal', 'behavior', 'characters', 'look', 'two', 'random', 'men', 'would', 'see', 'out', 'street', 'everyday', 'life', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'would', 'make', 'viewers', 'uncomfortable', 'found', 'admirable', 'path', 'film', 'take', 'When', 'cannibalism', 'happen', 'goriest', 'violence', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'call', 'film', 'gory', 'hell', 'would', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'be', 'doing', 'justice', 'doubt', 'one', 'goriest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'only', 'blood', 'gore', 'guts', 'bones', 'also', 'other', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'nobody', 'would', 'ever', 'take', 'account', 'urine', 'cum', 'feces', 'vomit', 'pus', 'are', 'put', 'display', 'shoved', 'audience', 'disgusting', 'rotten', 'horrible', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'fearless', 'true', 'crime', 'exploration', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'admire', 'alone']",Cannibal
