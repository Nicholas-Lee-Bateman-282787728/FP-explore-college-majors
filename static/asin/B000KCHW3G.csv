1033069,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B000KCHW3G,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[29, 30]","First of all, ""Don"" is an important film for Indians because it is a modern remake of a 1978 cult classic starring Bollywood legend, Amitabh Bachchan, but I'm confident that this up-to-date Don will also appeal to an English/American audience which is tiring of the usual loud, hard-core Hollywood action-suspense blockbusters.  Take a bit of 007 James Bond, Tom Cruise and Mission Impossible, mix with sophisticated Indian song and dance routines and some essential Bollywood-style sentimentality, and you've got ""Don"":  a slick, suave and smooth crime-action-suspense drama, Indian-style.  Filmed mainly in Malaysia, ""Don"" has a splash of all the Western-style trappings such as exotic locations, high-tech gadgets, stunning city skyscrapers, dare-devil stunts, unbelievable action and beautiful girls, yet the overall style and impression of the film is still pleasantly subdued and refreshingly sophisticated, especially when compared to its American counterparts.  This might be partly due to the very clever script with several unexpected twists and turns, as well as attention to the personal emotions of some of the characters, but let's face it:  how can you take an indestructible drug-trafficking bad guy like Don seriously when he breaks into a song and dance routine every 20 minutes?Keeping faithful to the original famous Seventies ""Don"", it is most appropriate that the new Don is played by Mr Bachchan's successor to the Bollywood throne: Shahrukh Khan, who manages to make bad look cool with the ease of a sneer and the flick of a cigarette.  Move over, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis and `Big Arnie' - Shahrukh Khan is all of these, and far more.  A mega superstar in India for over a decade, Khan has played an impressively vast range of diverse characters with his trademark dynamic, expressive and emotive manner which has made him incredibly popular with men, women and children viewers alike.  Although some of his best-known films are glossy feel-good romance musicals in which he is the nice-guy hero (such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mohabbatein, Veer-Zaara and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham), I personally find his bad guy and psycho roles far more fascinating and entertaining.  In fact, he began his successful career with such challenging psycho/bad guy roles, (Darr, Baazigar, Ram Jaane, Anjaam) and in ""Don"" he is able to combine both good and bad characters as he plays a dual role:  the bad-as-bad-can-be Don, and his exact look-alike, harmless and innocent Vijay, who is recruited to help the police bring down Don's crime gang.  It sounds simple enough at first, but the plot gets more involved and intriguing, until the final climactic twist takes your breath away.  While in my personal opinion Khan's best dual performance is in ""Duplicate"", a surprisingly good action-comedy from several years ago, his performance in ""Don"" is no less entertaining and exciting than his other successful roles.  Some expertly-crafted music and choreography, as well as attention to photography and overall colour/lighting of the film are other highlights which enhance the story and Shahrukh Khan's character.  Needless to say, ""Don"" is an essential addition to any Bollywood collection, and also a nice change for anyone with a taste for foreign films which have something new and different to offer.  The packaging of this DVD is just as slick and sophisticated as the movie, with good photos and comments by cast and crew, a bonus disc of special features (although the 1-hour ""Making of..."" is without subtitles and a bit hard to follow) and for a special treat, try to get the DVD (released in the UK) which has a thick comic book with pictures straight from the movie.",5,The indestructible Don is back!,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,3692,"['First', 'all', 'Don', 'important', 'film', 'Indians', 'modern', 'remake', '1978', 'cult', 'classic', 'starring', 'Bollywood', 'legend', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', ""'m"", 'confident', 'up-to-date', 'Don', 'will', 'also', 'appeal', 'English/American', 'audience', 'tiring', 'usual', 'loud', 'hard-core', 'Hollywood', 'action-suspense', 'blockbusters', 'Take', 'bit', '007', 'James', 'Bond', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'mix', 'sophisticated', 'Indian', 'song', 'dance', 'routines', 'essential', 'Bollywood-style', 'sentimentality', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Don', 'slick', 'suave', 'smooth', 'crime-action-suspense', 'drama', 'Indian-style', 'Filmed', 'mainly', 'Malaysia', 'Don', 'splash', 'Western-style', 'trappings', 'such', 'exotic', 'locations', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'stunning', 'city', 'skyscrapers', 'dare-devil', 'stunts', 'unbelievable', 'action', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'yet', 'overall', 'style', 'impression', 'film', 'still', 'pleasantly', 'subdued', 'refreshingly', 'sophisticated', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'American', 'counterparts', 'might', 'be', 'partly', 'due', 'very', 'clever', 'script', 'several', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'as', 'well', 'attention', 'personal', 'emotions', 'characters', 'let', 'face', 'how', 'can', 'take', 'indestructible', 'drug-trafficking', 'bad', 'guy', 'Don', 'seriously', 'when', 'song', 'dance', 'routine', '20', 'minutes', 'Keeping', 'faithful', 'original', 'famous', 'Seventies', 'Don', 'most', 'appropriate', 'new', 'Don', 'played', 'Mr', 'Bachchan', 'successor', 'Bollywood', 'throne', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'who', 'make', 'bad', 'look', 'cool', 'ease', 'sneer', 'flick', 'cigarette', 'Move', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Big', 'Arnie', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'far', 'more', 'mega', 'superstar', 'India', 'decade', 'Khan', 'played', 'impressively', 'vast', 'range', 'diverse', 'characters', 'trademark', 'dynamic', 'expressive', 'emotive', 'manner', 'made', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'viewers', 'alike', 'best-known', 'films', 'are', 'glossy', 'feel-good', 'romance', 'musicals', 'nice-guy', 'hero', 'such', 'Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'Mohabbatein', 'Veer-Zaara', 'Kabhi', 'Khushi', 'Kabhi', 'Gham', 'personally', 'find', 'bad', 'guy', 'psycho', 'roles', 'far', 'more', 'fascinating', 'entertaining', 'fact', 'began', 'successful', 'career', 'such', 'challenging', 'psycho/bad', 'guy', 'roles', 'Darr', 'Baazigar', 'Ram', 'Jaane', 'Anjaam', 'Don', 'able', 'combine', 'good', 'bad', 'characters', 'dual', 'role', 'bad-as-bad-can-be', 'Don', 'exact', 'look-alike', 'harmless', 'innocent', 'Vijay', 'who', 'recruited', 'help', 'police', 'bring', 'down', 'Don', 'crime', 'gang', 'simple', 'enough', 'first', 'plot', 'more', 'involved', 'intriguing', 'final', 'climactic', 'twist', 'breath', 'away', 'personal', 'opinion', 'Khan', 'best', 'dual', 'performance', 'Duplicate', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'action-comedy', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'performance', 'Don', 'less', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'other', 'successful', 'roles', 'expertly-crafted', 'music', 'choreography', 'as', 'well', 'attention', 'photography', 'overall', 'colour/lighting', 'film', 'are', 'other', 'highlights', 'enhance', 'story', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'character', 'Needless', 'say', 'Don', 'essential', 'addition', 'Bollywood', 'collection', 'also', 'nice', 'change', 'anyone', 'taste', 'foreign', 'films', 'have', 'something', 'new', 'different', 'offer', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'just', 'slick', 'sophisticated', 'movie', 'good', 'photos', 'comments', 'cast', 'crew', 'bonus', 'disc', 'special', 'features', '1-hour', 'Making', 'subtitles', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'special', 'treat', 'try', 'get', 'DVD', 'released', 'UK', 'thick', 'comic', 'book', 'pictures', 'straight', 'movie']",N/A

1033073,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000KCHW3G,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","So, this one's the latest in several remakes of the original film DON, which came out in 1978 and starred Amitabh Bachchan as the titular character. With this film's charismatic yet totally irredeemable lead role, it's certainly yet another argument made for villains holding a deeper fascination for the average person than the more boring heroes. Being bad is good, and Don intrigues us because not only is he ""cool,"" but also able to do and say things that most of us hesitate to do. This 2006 version did very well in the various box offices, and, having finally watched it on DVD, I can see why. It's actually closer to Hollywood than Bollywood in its sensibilites. Bollywood motion pictures certainly have their own merits, but they normally just aren't as glitzy and smooth as Hollywood flicks. There's also a pervasive John Woo element present which lends oomph and style points to the stunt and action sequences. And the story itself?In Europe and Asia, drug trafficking is thriving. To put a halt to crime boss Singhania's international drug empire, law enforcers from Malaysia and India have teamed up. The resulting plan of attack hinges on taking down Singhania's canny and ruthless lieutenant Don (Shahrukh Khan), who handles Singhania's business affairs with bloody efficiency. After several fruitless attempts, Don is finally captured but then dies. Chief Investigating Officer DeSilva comes up with an alternate plan. He unearths Vijay (also Shahrukh Khan), a simpleton who is Don's lookalike, and convinces him to pose as Don and infiltrate Singhania's gang. And that's the basic plot.The labyrinthine story, of course, teases the audience's ability to keep up with what's going on. Do we accept things at face value? Or is there some sort of shell game going on? There are twists and turns in abundance, and betrayals. To look away from the screen is to risk missing a vital hint or a key revelation. DON is a slick production, shot mostly in gorgeous Malaysia. The sleek cinematography and dynamic action sets lend DON a modern, big budget gloss. The professionalism that went into the film certainly made me take it more seriously, since the filmmakers were. There are several noteworthy acting turns here. Not having seen the original DON, I can't compare Shahrukh Khan's performance with Amitabh Bachchan's. But I know what I like, and I thought Khan's rendition of the flashy, clever, and evasive Don to be quality stuff. I do admit to not caring for his version of Vijay as Vijay. But his portrayal of Vijay posing as Don is engrossing. It was fun to witness Vijay growing in confidence and ability the deeper he delved into his impersonation. It's evident that Khan relishes getting a chance to deliver several classic lines from the original flick: ""People don't leave Don, they leave the world"" and, of course, the unforgettable ""Not only is it difficult to catch Don - it's impossible!""It's a fine supporting cast. Boman Irani is intense as DCP DeSilva. He brings a surprising physical presence to his role. Kareena Kapoor manages to be memorable in her virtually cameo-like appearance as Kamini (and ""Wow!"" to her musical number). Priyanka Chopra is not the best actress out there, but, in her admittedly not too challenging part of Roma, she is an asset to the film. And, even if her martial arts fails to look convincing, the concerted effort she puts in warms me to her. And, c'mon, from a cheesecake angle, she's very hot. Meanwhile, Arjun Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar are solid and will make their gender opposites drool a bit.DON is a Bollywood feature, so there are musical numbers. Three songs stand out for me. ""Main Hoon Don,"" of which catchy strains echo thoughout the film, and the smooth disco banger, ""Aaj Ki Raat,"" which showcases Priyanka and Ishaa Koppikar in tasty dance mode even as an assassination simultaneously takes place. Kareena Kapoor, by the way, does justice to ""Yeh Mera Dil"" with her racy rendition.I'm not normally into gangster flicks, but I was drawn into this one by the story's timeless doppelganger hook. This movie is absolutely dominated by Shahrukh Khan's presence. As Don, he exudes cool, with just the proper amount of over-the-top showmanship. DON is three hours of convoluted, audacious, action-packed fun. As such, it gets four stars from me. But what exactly is a ""paan""?",4,Not only is it difficult to catch Don - it's impossible!,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,4344,"['So', 'one', 'latest', 'several', 'remakes', 'original', 'film', 'DON', 'came', 'out', '1978', 'starred', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'titular', 'character', 'film', 'charismatic', 'yet', 'totally', 'irredeemable', 'lead', 'role', 'certainly', 'yet', 'argument', 'made', 'villains', 'holding', 'deeper', 'fascination', 'average', 'person', 'more', 'boring', 'heroes', 'Being', 'bad', 'good', 'Don', 'intrigues', 'not', 'only', 'cool', 'also', 'able', 'do', 'say', 'things', 'most', 'hesitate', 'do', '2006', 'version', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'various', 'box', 'offices', 'having', 'finally', 'watched', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'actually', 'closer', 'Hollywood', 'Bollywood', 'sensibilites', 'Bollywood', 'motion', 'certainly', 'have', 'own', 'merits', 'normally', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'glitzy', 'smooth', 'Hollywood', 'flicks', 'also', 'pervasive', 'John', 'Woo', 'element', 'present', 'oomph', 'style', 'points', 'stunt', 'action', 'sequences', 'story', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'thriving', 'put', 'halt', 'crime', 'boss', 'Singhania', 'international', 'drug', 'empire', 'law', 'enforcers', 'Malaysia', 'India', 'have', 'teamed', 'up', 'resulting', 'plan', 'attack', 'hinges', 'taking', 'down', 'Singhania', 'canny', 'ruthless', 'lieutenant', 'Don', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'who', 'Singhania', 'business', 'affairs', 'bloody', 'efficiency', 'several', 'fruitless', 'attempts', 'Don', 'finally', 'captured', 'then', 'Chief', 'Investigating', 'Officer', 'DeSilva', 'up', 'alternate', 'plan', 'unearths', 'Vijay', 'also', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'simpleton', 'who', 'Don', 'lookalike', 'pose', 'Don', 'infiltrate', 'Singhania', 'gang', 'basic', 'plot.The', 'labyrinthine', 'story', 'course', 'audience', 'ability', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'Do', 'accept', 'things', 'face', 'value', 'there', 'sort', 'shell', 'game', 'going', 'are', 'twists', 'turns', 'abundance', 'betrayals', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'risk', 'missing', 'vital', 'hint', 'key', 'revelation', 'DON', 'slick', 'production', 'shot', 'mostly', 'gorgeous', 'Malaysia', 'sleek', 'cinematography', 'dynamic', 'action', 'sets', 'lend', 'DON', 'modern', 'big', 'budget', 'gloss', 'professionalism', 'went', 'film', 'certainly', 'made', 'take', 'more', 'seriously', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'are', 'several', 'noteworthy', 'acting', 'turns', 'here', 'Not', 'having', 'seen', 'original', 'DON', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'performance', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'thought', 'Khan', 'rendition', 'flashy', 'clever', 'evasive', 'Don', 'be', 'quality', 'stuff', 'do', 'admit', 'not', 'caring', 'version', 'Vijay', 'Vijay', 'portrayal', 'Vijay', 'posing', 'Don', 'engrossing', 'was', 'fun', 'witness', 'Vijay', 'growing', 'confidence', 'ability', 'deeper', 'delved', 'impersonation', 'evident', 'Khan', 'getting', 'chance', 'deliver', 'several', 'classic', 'lines', 'original', 'flick', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Don', 'leave', 'world', 'course', 'unforgettable', 'Not', 'only', 'difficult', 'catch', 'Don', 'impossible', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Boman', 'Irani', 'intense', 'DCP', 'DeSilva', 'surprising', 'physical', 'presence', 'role', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'be', 'memorable', 'virtually', 'cameo-like', 'appearance', 'Kamini', 'Wow', 'musical', 'number', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'not', 'best', 'actress', 'there', 'admittedly', 'not', 'too', 'challenging', 'part', 'Roma', 'asset', 'film', 'even', 'martial', 'arts', 'look', 'convincing', 'concerted', 'effort', 'warms', ""c'mon"", 'cheesecake', 'angle', 'very', 'hot', 'Meanwhile', 'Arjun', 'Rampal', 'Ishaa', 'Koppikar', 'are', 'solid', 'will', 'make', 'gender', 'drool', 'bit.DON', 'Bollywood', 'feature', 'are', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Three', 'songs', 'stand', 'out', 'Main', 'Hoon', 'Don', 'catchy', 'strains', 'echo', 'film', 'smooth', 'disco', 'banger', 'Aaj', 'Ki', 'Raat', 'Priyanka', 'Ishaa', 'Koppikar', 'tasty', 'dance', 'mode', 'even', 'assassination', 'simultaneously', 'place', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'way', 'justice', 'Yeh', 'Mera', 'Dil', 'racy', 'rendition.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'gangster', 'flicks', 'was', 'drawn', 'one', 'story', 'timeless', 'doppelganger', 'hook', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'dominated', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'presence', 'Don', 'cool', 'just', 'proper', 'amount', 'over-the-top', 'showmanship', 'DON', 'three', 'hours', 'convoluted', 'audacious', 'action-packed', 'fun', 'such', 'four', 'stars', 'what', 'exactly', 'paan']",N/A

The film has all the fun hallmarks of a Bond flick--exotic locations (Paris and Kuala Lumpur), beautiful women, criminal masterminds, high-tech gadgets, fantastic fight scenes, and glamorous parties--but it is not a take-off of the 007 franchise. Rather, it's a remake of the 1978 Bollywood cult classic Don, which starred Amitabh Bachchan in the title role. The character is not ambiguous like Bond, but a bad, bad man--and Khan makes him his own.Don is in charge of the Malaysian operations of a global crime syndicate run by Singhania (Rajesh Khattar), and Don has designs on ousting his boss and taking over the whole organization. Police inspector D'Silva (Boman Irani) is trying to catch Don, Singhania, and another mysterious mobster, Vardhaan. When Don kills Ramesh (Diwakar Pundir), an underling who tries to go straight, Ramesh's fiance Kamini (Kareena Kapoor) goes undercover and tries to seduce Don. But he dispatches Kamini as well. So Ramesh's sister Roma (Priyanka Chopra) worms her way into Don's gang--with much more success. D'Silva has his own mole--Vijay, a Don look-alike (also played by Khan). D'Silva secretly captures Don and puts Vijay in his place, and the good-hearted goof feigns temporary amnesia until he learns to play the part of the utterly smooth, outrageously arrogant sociopath. Roma and Vijay don't know they're on the same side, and Don's girlfriend Anita (Isha Koppikar) is jealous of the sparks between them. There's a suspenseful, complicating subplot involving the lost boy Vijay cares for, Deepu (played by Tanay Chheda, one of the child actors in the 2008 Slumdog Millionaire) and Deepu's estranged father Jasjit (Arjun Rampal), which ramps up the emotional stakes.Don marks a career turning point for actor Arjun Rampal. The former model went from so-so to solid as Deepu's desperate dad (and his trajectory continued with a memorable role in the 2007 Om Shanti Om, a National Film Award for his performance in the 2008 Rock On!!, and critical acclaim for his turn in the 2010 Raajneeti).Farhan Akhtar, the talented director of the coming-of-age film Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and the military drama Lakshya (2004), shows off his versatility with this stylish action thriller that's full of surprises. (The original Don was co-written by his father, Javed Akhtar.) He's also directing the sequel, Don 2: The Chase Continues, which is expected to release at the end of 2011. Khan, Chopra, Irani, Koppikar, Rampal, and Chheda will be reprising their roles.

For those not in that category be aware that the surprise ending actually left me and my adult daughter feeling quite uncomfortable and gave us a restless nights sleep after. Those we had identitified with dont triumph (sorry about the spoiler but you may need to know that if you want to assess whether this is for you).I have given it a 5 because of its quality but a different ending would have made me more excited about this movie.Given the amoral ending its fascinating that Indians wanted to do this movie twice (it is a remake of an earlier celebrated one) and seem to love the character of Don.The music was fine but none of it stayed with me or stood out. A few of the dance sequences were good so there was song and dance amongst the plot (something I also wasnt sure of when reading prior reviews).",5,Well conceived plot but not the usual happy ending,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,1357,"['Don', 'slick', 'well', 'conceived', 'plot', 'lots', 'surprises', 'way', 'When', 'was', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'originally', 'one', 'was', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'how', 'serious', 'was', 'was', 'light', 'Bollywood', 'who', 'have', 'same', 'question', 'mind', 'really', 'light', 'overall.Don', 'arrogant', 'psychopath', 'drug', 'trafficker', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'other', 'Bollywoods', 'good', 'doesnt', 'win', 'end', 'nasties', 'dont', 'meet', 'consequences', 'may', 'not', 'particularly', 'bother', 'may', 'like', 'endings', 'arent', 'politically', 'correct', 'not', 'category', 'be', 'aware', 'surprise', 'ending', 'actually', 'left', 'adult', 'daughter', 'feeling', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'gave', 'restless', 'nights', 'sleep', 'had', 'identitified', 'dont', 'triumph', 'sorry', 'spoiler', 'may', 'need', 'know', 'want', 'assess', '.I', 'have', 'given', '5', 'quality', 'different', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'excited', 'amoral', 'ending', 'fascinating', 'Indians', 'wanted', 'do', 'movie', 'twice', 'remake', 'earlier', 'celebrated', 'one', 'seem', 'love', 'character', 'Don.The', 'music', 'was', 'fine', 'none', 'stayed', 'stood', 'out', 'few', 'dance', 'sequences', 'were', 'good', 'so', 'was', 'song', 'dance', 'amongst', 'plot', 'something', 'also', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'when', 'reading', 'prior', 'reviews']",N/A
