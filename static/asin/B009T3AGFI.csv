I am so tired of silly plots and endless insults within the script amongst our culture.  The underlying Christian message was a stretch.The other thing that bothers me is that I am so tired of the portrayal of the infidelities that exist.  Can you actually have a play with legitimate issues that don't involve cheating.  It makes me sick to my stomach but funny how once caught everyone is sorry.Don't waste your time on this.,1,One of the worst I have seen.....don't waste your money or time,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,485,"['far', 'one', 'worst', 'play', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'am', 'so', 'tired', 'silly', 'plots', 'endless', 'insults', 'script', 'culture', 'underlying', 'Christian', 'message', 'was', 'stretch.The', 'other', 'thing', 'bothers', 'am', 'so', 'tired', 'portrayal', 'infidelities', 'exist', 'Can', 'actually', 'have', 'play', 'legitimate', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'involve', 'cheating', 'sick', 'stomach', 'funny', 'how', 'once', 'caught', 'everyone', 'sorry.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",N/A
