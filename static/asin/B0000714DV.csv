A teenage boy becomes extremely abusive to his devorced mother. This is a reality movie. And what I mean is this is some thing that happens all of the time actually more and more but it really goes unseen. How often do you hear about a child abusing their parents? Thats what I thought. But in the movie, you will see how a mother struggles to overcome this ordeal. And you will see how anger really affects some and how others around them learn to lie about the bruises, loud crashing of things and the truth. Every parent who has ever had an abusive child could see them selves in this movie.

I may not be a psychologist, but I feel as if you can appreciate this film on a psychological level. It just goes to show you how manipulative and angry some children can be.
