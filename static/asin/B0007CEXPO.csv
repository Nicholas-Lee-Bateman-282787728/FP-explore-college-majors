879581,A1LBIZLET9CW1I,B0007CEXPO,A fellow with a keyboard,"[6, 6]","You should watch this program. Why? As Jewel would say in the L'Oreal commercial, ""Because you're worth it.""Here was the synopsis that convinced me to watch it: ""Each year, legions of ad people, copywriters, market researchers, pollsters, consultants, and even linguists--most of whom work for one of six giant companies--spend billions of dollars and millions of man-hours trying to determine how to persuade consumers what to buy, whom to trust, and what to think. ... This 90-minute documentary explores how the cultures of marketing and advertising have come to influence not only what Americans buy, but also how they view themselves and the world around them.""Although I generally liked it, I was disappointed that very little attention was paid to the last part about how ""persuaders"" influence how we see ourselves. Most attention was paid to the behind-the-scenes stuff of how marketing works and some of the science/philosophy of it.I think to summarize it in one sentence, it would be exactly what the guy said at the very end of the program: ""The secret of all persuasion is to induce the person to persuade himself."" It's all about appealing to the unconscious/emotion/reptilian brain--making you feel (rather than think) that the product/idea/politician/whatever serves your own selfish primal desires.One marketing guru formed his marketing philosophy by studying why people join cults. The conclusion? People join both cults and brands for two reasons: (1) to belong, (2) to make meaning. ""We need to figure out what the world is all about, and we need the company of others. It's as simple as that.""My favorite moment, by far, is at the beginning of Chapter 4 ""Science of Selling"" when a market researcher probes a poor guy with a very awkward question: ""I've got a whole list of emotions here. I just want you to tell me yes or no as to whether you feel that emotion when you're eating white bread.""...Accepting?""The guy's eyebrows furl. He pauses. Looks to the side.""Do you feel accepting when you're eating white bread?,"" the market researcher asks again, as if the guy didn't understand the question.Another 2-second delay and then the guy finally answers, ""Yeah. I would say yes,"" in the least convincing possible way.----P.S. - All Frontline programs are available for free online.

In between, you see how corporations and institutions 'persuade' you to buy a product, adopt a lifestyle or vote for a government. The last segment on 'narrowcasting' is extremely disturbing. What do you do when a politician says one thing to you and something else to someone else - behind your back? What do you do when data mining companies have your every last habit, bias and weakness at hand, and sell this information to those who want to influence and sway you? Are they merely giving you what you want, or is it the final invasion of your privacy?

Enright,"[5, 6]","While PBS is often establishment-friendlyAir Wars: The Fight to Reclaim Public Broadcasting, sometimes they take a radical look at the water we fish are swimming in.  ""The Persuaders"" is a revealing look at marketing, and how often our emotions (often subconsciously) play a role in our product purchases.  The first part of ""The Persuaders"" analyzes how we seek things like community and transcendence in our products.  Critics like Naomi Klein No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies are interviewed, as well as figures in marketing agencies and a marketing ""guru"" who seeks to understand the ""reptilian"" part of our brains.  The last part of ""The Persuaders"" looks into how these marketing techniques have been employed by politicians.  Republican public opinion researcher Frank Luntz is interviewed.  He has had much success by reframing issues, such as changing the name of the Estate tax to the ""Death"" tax.  Another successful rebranding campaign was to label the war on Iraq the War on TerrorWar Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death.Slowly but surely, people do develop an ""immunity"" to some of these emtionally manipulative psychological operations, especially when consciousness is raised about them.Here are a couple other related resources to enable our intellectual self-defense from the ""persuaders"":The CorporationPropaganda and the Public MindPR! - A Social History of SpinAdbusters, January/February 2009 IssueManufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the MediaThe Political Mind: Why You Can't Understand 21st-Century American Politics with an 18th-Century BrainConsuming Kids: Protecting Our Children from the Onslaught of Marketing & Advertising",5,"The selling of products, brands and politicians.",1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,1693,"['PBS', 'often', 'establishment-friendlyAir', 'Wars', 'Fight', 'Reclaim', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'sometimes', 'take', 'radical', 'look', 'water', 'fish', 'are', 'swimming', 'Persuaders', 'revealing', 'look', 'marketing', 'how', 'often', 'emotions', 'often', 'subconsciously', 'play', 'role', 'product', 'purchases', 'first', 'part', 'Persuaders', 'how', 'seek', 'things', 'community', 'transcendence', 'products', 'Critics', 'Naomi', 'Klein', 'No', 'Logo', 'Taking', 'Aim', 'Brand', 'Bullies', 'are', 'interviewed', 'as', 'well', 'figures', 'marketing', 'agencies', 'marketing', 'guru', 'who', 'understand', 'reptilian', 'part', 'brains', 'last', 'part', 'Persuaders', 'how', 'marketing', 'techniques', 'have', 'been', 'employed', 'politicians', 'Republican', 'public', 'opinion', 'researcher', 'Frank', 'Luntz', 'interviewed', 'had', 'much', 'success', 'reframing', 'issues', 'such', 'changing', 'name', 'Estate', 'tax', 'Death', 'tax', 'successful', 'rebranding', 'campaign', 'was', 'label', 'war', 'Iraq', 'War', 'TerrorWar', 'Made', 'Easy', 'How', 'Presidents', 'Pundits', 'Keep', 'Spinning', 'Us', 'Death.Slowly', 'surely', 'people', 'do', 'develop', 'immunity', 'emtionally', 'manipulative', 'psychological', 'operations', 'especially', 'when', 'consciousness', 'raised', 'are', 'couple', 'other', 'related', 'resources', 'enable', 'intellectual', 'self-defense', 'persuaders', 'CorporationPropaganda', 'Public', 'MindPR', 'Social', 'History', 'SpinAdbusters', 'January/February', '2009', 'IssueManufacturing', 'Consent', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'MediaThe', 'Political', 'Mind', 'Why', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Understand', '21st-Century', 'American', 'Politics', '18th-Century', 'BrainConsuming', 'Kids', 'Protecting', 'Children', 'Onslaught', 'Marketing', 'Advertising']",Frontline: The Persuaders
