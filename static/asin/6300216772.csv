Add to that a sparkling presence, and a raw instinct for the characters she portrays, and you have all the hallmarks of classic Hollywood actress.After a stunning, Academy Award nominated and Golden Globe winning debut performance in ""Lady Sings the Blues"", Diana should have gone on to star in a dozen blockbusters.  However, we live in a real world, and the reality of life in Hollywood at the time was far different.  All the major actresses of colour during the 70s - Diahann Carroll, Cicely Tyson, Rosalind Cash and Pam Grier struggled to find substantial parts to portray, the ""glass ceiling"" hindering their progress.  We need to bear this in mind when we look at films like ""Mahogany"".""Mahogany"" is a simple story of Tracy Chambers, an ambitions secretary and part-time fashion design student, who dreams of making it big but is faced with obstacles wherever she turns.  Billy Dee Williams is back, this time playing an equally ambitious politician, who wants to transform the local Chicago ghetto.  The two meet and fall in love, but clearly want different things.Along comes an eccentric (if not deranged!), sought-after fashion photographer (played adeptly by Anthony Perkins), who spots Tracy's potential as a fashion model.  The rest is history - Tracy jets off to Rome for a photo shoot, and becomes an international symbol of fashion and beauty.  Sean builds up but then tries to sabotage Tracy's career, but she's rescued by a wealthy European socialite who helps her to become a world famous fashion designer. Diana plays the DIVA with wicked precision!Some critics ripped ""Mahogany"" to shreds when it was released.  After all, this was the 70s, and African American actors were busy portraying their Blaxploitaion roles - in other words, they were playing pimps, hookers and drug dealers.  A love story between two attractive African Americans didn't quite fit the stereotype.  I watched the movie around 3 years ago, with friends who aren't fans of Diana Ross.  At they end of it, they thought it was quite good and that Diana's performance was commendable.So, even to this day, the jury's out over the quality of the film.  I would say that Diana Ross provided the right dreams at the right time.  While Mahogany isn't her most polished performance (you need to look at OUT OF DARKNESS for that), it's a watchable movie nonetheless. Diana picked up a Best Actress French Oscar, the Cesar, for her performance, and it was rightly deserved.If you're undecided as to whether to shell out on this film, I would say ""get it"" and make up your own mind.  Grab a bowl of popcorn, get the flares out and take a trip down memory lane!",3,Diana Ross in a 70s Fantasy Classic,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,2744,"['DIANA', 'ROSS', 'face', 'svelte', 'figure', 'elegance', 'transcended', 'perfectly', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'Add', 'sparkling', 'presence', 'raw', 'instinct', 'characters', 'have', 'hallmarks', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'actress.After', 'stunning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'winning', 'debut', 'performance', 'Lady', 'Blues', 'Diana', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'star', 'dozen', 'blockbusters', 'However', 'live', 'real', 'world', 'reality', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'was', 'far', 'different', 'major', 'actresses', 'colour', '70s', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'Rosalind', 'Cash', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'struggled', 'find', 'substantial', 'parts', 'portray', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'hindering', 'progress', 'need', 'bear', 'mind', 'when', 'look', 'films', 'Mahogany', 'Mahogany', 'simple', 'story', 'Tracy', 'Chambers', 'ambitions', 'secretary', 'part-time', 'fashion', 'design', 'student', 'who', 'making', 'big', 'faced', 'obstacles', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'back', 'time', 'playing', 'equally', 'ambitious', 'politician', 'who', 'transform', 'local', 'Chicago', 'ghetto', 'two', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'clearly', 'want', 'different', 'things.Along', 'eccentric', 'not', 'deranged', 'sought-after', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'played', 'adeptly', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'who', 'spots', 'Tracy', 'potential', 'fashion', 'model', 'rest', 'history', 'Tracy', 'jets', 'Rome', 'photo', 'shoot', 'international', 'symbol', 'fashion', 'beauty', 'Sean', 'up', 'then', 'sabotage', 'Tracy', 'career', 'rescued', 'wealthy', 'European', 'socialite', 'who', 'become', 'world', 'famous', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Diana', 'DIVA', 'wicked', 'precision', 'critics', 'ripped', 'Mahogany', 'shreds', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'was', '70s', 'African', 'American', 'actors', 'were', 'busy', 'portraying', 'Blaxploitaion', 'other', 'words', 'were', 'playing', 'pimps', 'hookers', 'drug', 'dealers', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'attractive', 'African', 'Americans', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'stereotype', 'watched', 'movie', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'friends', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'end', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Diana', 'performance', 'was', 'commendable.So', 'even', 'day', 'jury', 'out', 'quality', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'provided', 'right', 'dreams', 'right', 'time', 'Mahogany', ""n't"", 'most', 'polished', 'performance', 'need', 'look', 'OUT', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'watchable', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'Diana', 'picked', 'up', 'Best', 'Actress', 'French', 'Oscar', 'Cesar', 'performance', 'was', 'rightly', 'deserved.If', ""'re"", 'undecided', 'shell', 'out', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'get', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'Grab', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'get', 'flares', 'out', 'take', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane']",N/A

This movie is a complete waste of time with a storyline that was frustrating to follow.  The only thing I got from this movie is that once you rise from poverty into riches and fame, you become shallow.  Oh and Billy Dee William's character was an insecure loser of a man who was also a wannabe alderman.  Far as I gathered, Billy Dee Williams was a slacker who wasn't seen as such because he was always running for office -and losing.  Of course Diana Ross's character made Billy Dee William's character feel insecure about her success because he was insecure.  Somehow, she was to blame for his own insecurities and the only viable solution this film offered was for Diana Ross to get off her high horse and worship this loser as if he were the King of Zamunda for no other reason than --love.

222773,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,6300216772,Best Of All,"[7, 9]","After the fabulous Lady Sings the Blues, the next lead role for Diana Ross would prove to be quite difficult, if not impossible. And then add the drama surrounding Berry Gordy and the directing of Mahogany, it is ultimately the professionalism of the cast that kept the project from completely falling apart.The movie was produced by Motown Records and released in 1975 by Paramount Pictures to mostly very critical reviews in the media. One joke back in the day was the highlight of the film was the song, Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To), which actually claimed the number one slot on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1976. The movie received one 1976 Academy Award nomination, for Best Music, Original Score.Perhaps the person who was cast incorrectly for a role was Gordy as director, who replaced Tony Richardson, after reports of the timeless cinema tug-of-war, creative differences. Gordy also reportedly had spats with Ross, which may have been as much personal as professional. Ross ultimately left the production before filming was completed.Through all the turmoil, Ross turns in an admirable performance as Tracy/Mahogany, who puts herself through fashion school with the goal of being one of the world's top designers. But Tracy's beauty and ambition carries its own series of heavy burdens. As the line on the original movie poster reads, ""Mahogany: the woman every woman wants to be - and every man wants to have.""Ross proved to be a talent for design, as she created some of the costumes for the fashion show sequence. Billy Dee Williams (Brian) and Anthony Perkins (Sean McAvoy) are great in their roles.But the film did not have the typical creative energy from the director to the cast. Gordy was cutting the check - and Motown Records had a lot riding on Ross as a recording/movie superstar - but his ego-infused meddling ultimately destroyed what could have been a classic film with a variation of the timeless theme concerning a person reaching for the stars and achieving success against incredible odds.",4,As Much Drama Behind The Scenes As In The Script,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,2048,"['fabulous', 'Lady', 'Sings', 'Blues', 'next', 'lead', 'role', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'quite', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'then', 'add', 'drama', 'surrounding', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'directing', 'Mahogany', 'ultimately', 'professionalism', 'cast', 'kept', 'project', 'completely', 'falling', 'apart.The', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'Motown', 'Records', 'released', '1975', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'mostly', 'very', 'critical', 'reviews', 'media', 'One', 'joke', 'back', 'day', 'was', 'highlight', 'film', 'was', 'song', 'Theme', 'Mahogany', 'Do', 'Know', 'Where', ""'re"", 'Going', 'actually', 'claimed', 'number', 'one', 'slot', 'Billboard', 'Hot', '100', 'early', '1976', 'movie', 'received', 'one', '1976', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Music', 'Original', 'Score.Perhaps', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'incorrectly', 'role', 'was', 'Gordy', 'director', 'who', 'replaced', 'Tony', 'Richardson', 'reports', 'timeless', 'cinema', 'tug-of-war', 'creative', 'differences', 'Gordy', 'also', 'reportedly', 'had', 'spats', 'Ross', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'much', 'personal', 'professional', 'Ross', 'ultimately', 'left', 'production', 'filming', 'was', 'turmoil', 'Ross', 'admirable', 'performance', 'Tracy/Mahogany', 'who', 'fashion', 'school', 'goal', 'being', 'one', 'world', 'top', 'designers', 'Tracy', 'beauty', 'ambition', 'own', 'series', 'heavy', 'burdens', 'line', 'original', 'movie', 'poster', 'Mahogany', 'woman', 'woman', 'be', 'man', 'have', 'Ross', 'proved', 'be', 'talent', 'design', 'created', 'costumes', 'fashion', 'show', 'sequence', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'Brian', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Sean', 'McAvoy', 'are', 'great', 'roles.But', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'typical', 'creative', 'energy', 'director', 'cast', 'Gordy', 'was', 'cutting', 'check', 'Motown', 'Records', 'had', 'lot', 'riding', 'Ross', 'recording/movie', 'superstar', 'ego-infused', 'meddling', 'ultimately', 'destroyed', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'film', 'variation', 'timeless', 'theme', 'concerning', 'person', 'reaching', 'stars', 'achieving', 'success', 'incredible', 'odds']",N/A

Her eye for style has always been much more successful in her real life on stage and off. Mohagany is about an ambitious fashion design student (Tracy chambers) coaxed into modeling( while toiling under the most uptight boss at a dept. store) and ending up the toast of (mid-seventies fashion hot spot)Rome.The re-named Mahogany is played with relish by Miss Ross at her physical peak with all the elements in place: the high-fashion skeletal frame, the elegantly graceful body language,the voluptuous lips, enormous eyes, perfectly chiseled button nose and sculpted cheekbones. All shown to stunning effect with her natural hair pulled tightly back. Miss Ross performs the mega-hit theme song in that instantly recognizable voice which could be described as velvet wrapped longing teetering on the brink of heartbreak. And simmering just beneath that delicate voice is the  sass, the singleminded ambition, the will of steel, the ferocious drive,the anger-management issues, the diva-tantrums and of course, the man-troubles. Does she find love in the arms of the earnest ,underdog local politician played by Billy Dee Williams whose life is the flip side of the decadent-glitzy fashion world or does she let a rich Italian sugar daddy provide her with her dream fashion empire.The scene that really sums up that legendary Ross spirit is when she goes on her first casting(go-see) as a model. She faces a panel of jaded Italian advertising slime-balls who ridicule her on her lack of sex appeal (no T ,no A...or even legs!)...well, she fires back at them like a verbal machine gun, mowing 'em down while asserting her-self, physical and otherwise.  They are left totally dumbfounded and to top it off, much to Ross' amazement, there happens to be one lone female (the owner of the agency no less)seated ,very quietly and indifferently -never looking up once- among the men. Well, she  is totally blown away by the ROSS SPIRIT....and offers her the gig (a perfume ad) without any hesitation. It's no wonder, this happens to be the precise moment when la Ross is looking her chic-est and  most  uncharacteristically restrained in head to toe ivory (very 1930's vogue sketch). This great sweet, unexpected revenge scene dissolves right  into one of the most mesmerizing cinematic montages of la Ross being photographed in a zillion different  moods (innocent, artsy, vampy, sexy, coy, seductive, playful, fun, wild, strange, dramatic, glamorous, chic...)by the always peculiarly entertaining  Anthony Perkins(perfectly cast, once again, as Mr. Oddball with multiple issue disorder). This sequence could quite possibly be the first cinematic moment extensively devoted to celebrating Black-Breathtaking-Gorgeousness....or ""anything TWIGGY or LAUREN  HUTTON can do"", ROSS will try her best to OUT-DO! Not the least bit surprising for a woman who many believe would compete with her own shadow...and WIN!!It's quite a mesmerizing montage and created over 30 years before the music video phenomenon that heavily stroked a music artist's vanity while their latest recording played in the background. Major props to Mr. Gordy on pulling this gritty classic 70's film together....and for succeeding in getting his ultimate creation's face out there decades before Youtube took over the planet...and where her many images and performances happily lives on forever.",5,Documenting Diana,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,3731,"['need', 'film', 'bio', 'Miss', 'Ross', 'anyone', 'who', 'curious', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'persona', 'obsession', 're-packaging', 'image', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'energy', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'feast', 'above', 'very', 'simple', 'light', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'fluff', 'period', 'perfect', 'complete', 'campy', 'runway', 'show', 'displaying', 'Miss', 'Ross', 'very', 'amateur', 'fashion', 'designs', 'eye', 'style', 'always', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'real', 'life', 'stage', 'Mohagany', 'ambitious', 'fashion', 'design', 'student', 'Tracy', 'chambers', 'coaxed', 'modeling', 'toiling', 'most', 'uptight', 'boss', 'dept', 'store', 'ending', 'up', 'toast', 'mid-seventies', 'fashion', 'hot', 'spot', 'Rome.The', 're-named', 'Mahogany', 'played', 'relish', 'Miss', 'Ross', 'physical', 'peak', 'elements', 'place', 'high-fashion', 'skeletal', 'frame', 'elegantly', 'graceful', 'body', 'language', 'voluptuous', 'lips', 'enormous', 'eyes', 'perfectly', 'chiseled', 'button', 'nose', 'sculpted', 'cheekbones', 'shown', 'stunning', 'effect', 'natural', 'hair', 'pulled', 'tightly', 'back', 'Miss', 'Ross', 'mega-hit', 'theme', 'song', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'voice', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'velvet', 'wrapped', 'longing', 'teetering', 'brink', 'heartbreak', 'simmering', 'just', 'beneath', 'delicate', 'voice', 'sass', 'singleminded', 'ambition', 'will', 'steel', 'ferocious', 'drive', 'anger-management', 'issues', 'diva-tantrums', 'course', 'man-troubles', 'find', 'love', 'arms', 'earnest', 'underdog', 'local', 'politician', 'played', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'life', 'flip', 'side', 'decadent-glitzy', 'fashion', 'world', 'let', 'rich', 'Italian', 'sugar', 'daddy', 'dream', 'fashion', 'empire.The', 'scene', 'really', 'up', 'legendary', 'Ross', 'spirit', 'when', 'first', 'casting', 'go-see', 'model', 'panel', 'jaded', 'Italian', 'advertising', 'slime-balls', 'who', 'ridicule', 'lack', 'sex', 'appeal', 'T', 'A', 'even', 'legs', 'well', 'back', 'verbal', 'machine', 'gun', 'mowing', 'down', 'asserting', 'her-self', 'physical', 'otherwise', 'are', 'left', 'totally', 'dumbfounded', 'top', 'off', 'much', 'Ross', 'amazement', 'be', 'one', 'lone', 'female', 'owner', 'agency', 'no', 'less', 'seated', 'very', 'quietly', 'indifferently', '-never', 'looking', 'up', 'once-', 'men', 'Well', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'ROSS', 'SPIRIT', '.and', 'gig', 'perfume', 'ad', 'hesitation', 'wonder', 'be', 'precise', 'moment', 'when', 'la', 'Ross', 'looking', 'chic-est', 'most', 'uncharacteristically', 'restrained', 'head', 'toe', 'ivory', 'very', '1930', 'vogue', 'sketch', 'great', 'sweet', 'unexpected', 'revenge', 'scene', 'dissolves', 'right', 'one', 'most', 'mesmerizing', 'cinematic', 'montages', 'la', 'Ross', 'being', 'photographed', 'zillion', 'different', 'moods', 'innocent', 'artsy', 'vampy', 'sexy', 'coy', 'seductive', 'playful', 'fun', 'wild', 'strange', 'dramatic', 'glamorous', 'chic', 'always', 'peculiarly', 'entertaining', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'once', 'again', 'Mr.', 'Oddball', 'multiple', 'issue', 'disorder', 'sequence', 'could', 'quite', 'possibly', 'be', 'first', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'extensively', 'devoted', 'celebrating', 'Black-Breathtaking-Gorgeousness', 'anything', 'TWIGGY', 'LAUREN', 'HUTTON', 'can', 'do', 'ROSS', 'will', 'try', 'best', 'OUT-DO', 'Not', 'least', 'bit', 'surprising', 'woman', 'who', 'many', 'believe', 'would', 'compete', 'own', 'shadow', 'WIN', 'quite', 'mesmerizing', 'montage', 'created', '30', 'years', 'music', 'video', 'phenomenon', 'heavily', 'stroked', 'music', 'artist', 'vanity', 'latest', 'recording', 'played', 'background', 'Major', 'props', 'Mr.', 'Gordy', 'pulling', 'gritty', 'classic', '70', 'film', 'together', '.and', 'succeeding', 'getting', 'ultimate', 'creation', 'face', 'there', 'decades', 'Youtube', 'took', 'over', 'planet', 'where', 'many', 'images', 'performances', 'happily', 'forever']",N/A

I'd only seen it one other time previously, which isn't odd considering that it was released in 1975--one year before I was born--although I fell in love with it during that one viewing and have been anxiously awaiting it to come out on DVD--commercials every six or seven minutes can ruin any movie.I loved Ms. Ross in ""The Wiz,"" and although ""Lady Sings the Blues"" was a great movie, neither has ANYTHING on ""Mahogany.""  I'm a big fan of seventies movies...for some reason, they remind me of each other.  From ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" to ""A Star is Born"" (Streisand) to ""Claudine"" to ""Mahogany"" I adore stories set in the seventies (my favorite decade) that depicts love against the odds.  However, of all the great seventies films--and possibly black movies, period--""Mahogany"" remains my favorite.Thin, glamorourous, BEAUTIFUL, sassy, brass, and bold, Diana Ross stole it with her performance of working-class-girl turned supermodel diva Tracy.  Diana Ross was excellent, as she developed and then severed a relationship with silver screen god Billy Dee Williams (her on-screen boyfriend, politician Brian), and as she gravitated towards and later dodged Anthony Perkins.  And she looks so much like her own daughter, Tracee of ""Girlfriends"" (TV Show) fame that it's uncanny--and makes me wish that her daughter would star in a remade, modernized version.  Oh, but this version is excellent in its own right, of course.  The costumes are FIERCE.  This movie is a wonderful period piece, and although it seems dated when viewed today, it commands universality.Although the behaviors of the main men that Tracy dealt with in this movie were questionable, it must be something to have men lusting after you the way they did her.  Frustrated, perhaps, at being only a sex object, by the end of the movie Tracy returns to the one man she knew before she made it big--Brian--the one who wanted her for more than her looks or glamour.  She compromises, of course, but she was in love.And the world needs way more of that.",5,Fantastic Fantasy Film!,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,2078,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', ""'d"", 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'other', 'time', 'previously', ""n't"", 'odd', 'considering', 'was', 'released', '1975', 'one', 'year', 'was', 'born', 'fell', 'love', 'one', 'viewing', 'have', 'been', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'commercials', 'six', 'seven', 'minutes', 'can', 'ruin', 'movie.I', 'loved', 'Ms.', 'Ross', 'Wiz', 'Lady', 'Blues', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'ANYTHING', 'Mahogany', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'seventies', 'movies', 'reason', 'remind', 'other', 'Alice', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'A', 'Star', 'Born', 'Streisand', 'Claudine', 'Mahogany', 'adore', 'stories', 'set', 'seventies', 'favorite', 'decade', 'love', 'odds', 'However', 'great', 'seventies', 'films', 'possibly', 'black', 'movies', 'period', 'Mahogany', 'favorite.Thin', 'glamorourous', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'sassy', 'brass', 'bold', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'stole', 'performance', 'working-class-girl', 'turned', 'supermodel', 'diva', 'Tracy', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'was', 'excellent', 'developed', 'then', 'severed', 'relationship', 'silver', 'screen', 'god', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'on-screen', 'boyfriend', 'politician', 'Brian', 'gravitated', 'towards', 'later', 'dodged', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'daughter', 'Tracee', 'Girlfriends', 'TV', 'Show', 'fame', 'uncanny', 'wish', 'daughter', 'would', 'star', 'remade', 'modernized', 'version', 'Oh', 'version', 'excellent', 'own', 'right', 'course', 'costumes', 'are', 'FIERCE', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'period', 'piece', 'dated', 'when', 'viewed', 'today', 'behaviors', 'main', 'men', 'Tracy', 'movie', 'were', 'questionable', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'have', 'men', 'lusting', 'way', 'did', 'Frustrated', 'perhaps', 'being', 'only', 'sex', 'object', 'end', 'movie', 'Tracy', 'one', 'man', 'knew', 'made', 'big', 'Brian', 'one', 'who', 'wanted', 'more', 'looks', 'glamour', 'course', 'was', 'world', 'way', 'more']",N/A

I enjoyed the scenes of her when she wasn't with her goofy politician boyfriend (aka 'Lando Calrissian).

As Tracy (Diana Ross) does begin to 'make it' she suddenly finds herself ""empty"" - an interesting theme - problem is I didn't really buy it.  I didn't beleive Lando's words and personage could have such effect on her, as in reality she seemed too wrapped up in herself - her world, her fashion designs, her fame - for me to beleive she cared about him.

It was wisely showcased with &#34;Jaws&#34; that summer's blockbuster.After the Academy Award winning (it deserved it so there) performance in &#34;Lady Sings the Blues&#34;, audiences wondered what was next for this instant box office draw known as Diana Ross. At first, you might have thought another serious drama was in demand. But Diana and Berry Gordy understood how to reach the masses. Though &#34;Lady Sings the Blues&#34; was a massive global success earning Diana Best Actress nods in the British Film Institute and the French Cesar for instance, its &#34;R&#34; rating, kept a cross section of the youth market. That market, Motown understood also well in the marketing of Diana Ross & The Supremes as the still top female group a half century later. So it was time to lighten the mood. The theme song, &#34;Do You Know Where You Are Going To?&#34; had already been a global #1 hit for Diana and Motown that spring. It drove the &#34;Mahogany&#34; soundtrack to the Top 20 before the movie even opened. And her self-titled &#34;Black Album&#34; was a Top 5 smash. By the time &#34;Mahogany&#34; opened, Diana was enjoying tremendous success with &#34;Love Hangover&#34; rewriting the blueprint of a disco pop smash!Motown distributed &#34;Mahogany&#34; tee shirts in major cities and it instantly became a sought after piece of pop memorabilia. Motown were masters of marketing.Gordy fretted opening day in New York when there were few people at the theaters, but, by the 8:00 p.m. Showing, it was soldout and caused an unheard of around the clock showing in Times Square grossing a neat $1 million in New York alone, that first week.The movie was nothing short of an homage to Diana. Critics may have been a little mixed about the movie. Audiences were not. Pauline Kael said that Diana was like a tornado blowing through this movie. The reunion of Billy Dee Williams and Diana was the perfect date romance that further enhanced its popcorn appeal.Berry and Motown was looking for and got that massive pop hit. Its $7 million dollar take in its second week spreading to more theaters than New York would be $30 million today! That is basically what a respectable urban movie makes today in its entire run. &#34;Mahogany&#34; was a hit!Anthony Perkins plays a metrosexual photographer that would seem appropriate for Bravo's &#34;Queer Eye&#34;! Diana's fun fashion show would be today's RuPaul Drag Race runway contest!

I must admit I enjoyed it this original story of a young ghetto lass with aspirations of designing haute couture for the rich &amp;  famous. Diana Ross was then at the zenith of her career no doubt wanting to  extend her craft and try out new avenues in her profession. To some extent  she succeeded especially with Lady sings the blues. No doubt Halle Berry  will come out with her version in the future. Mahogany I am glad to say has  dated well. Produced at a time when black american awareness was only just  starting it offers us an unstereotypical view of life then. Diana Ross does  a good portrayal as Tracey, the aspiring talented designer looking for an  opportunity to break out of the class prejudice life had thrust upon her.  In a way black women had it even harder back then, wanting equality not  only for their race but for their gender as well. Black men are notoriously  sexist in that respect. But I digress. Ross does her best work during  scenes with Billy Dee Williams character Brian. The idealistic young  politician who wants her to give everything up for him. Sound familiar. The  chemistry on screen was quite believable that one would wonder what was  really going on behind the scenes. Oh well. The costumes and dresses were  stunningly gorgeous and designed by miss Ross herself. Hows that for multi  talented. The romantic ending following the rally at the end was  predictable but touching all the same. Shame the Lady hasnt made any films  for a while.

222801,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6300216772,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Mahogany tells the story of Tracy Chambers (Diana Ross), a young woman from the Chicago ghetto who dreams endlessly of being a world-renowned fashion designer. The men in Tracy's life bolster Diana Ross as the film's leading actress. Far from being the perfect Ross vehicle I remembered it to be, when I watched this film this afternoon once again after many years, I found it somewhat superficial--even when showing Tracy's on-again off-again romance with political activist Brian Walker (Billy Dee Williams).The action starts when Tracy is working in a department store--going nowhere fast. By luck she is noticed by famous and influential fashion photographer Sean McAvoy (Anthony Perkins). After some twists and turns in the plot, most of which serve only to extend the movie's running length, Tracy is fired from the store and she decides to join Sean McAvoy in Rome to be a designer instead of staying with the man who really loves her, Brian Walker.Unfortunately for Tracy, the minute she arrives in Rome trouble slowly but surely creeps into her life. McAvoy is a callous brute who names his models after inanimate objects to depersonalize his relationship with them. Sean's insecurity and insanity also slowly begins to show: Sean slashes pictures of his last greatest fashion model and he becomes desperate to prove his manhood to Tracy. When Brian loses the election for Alderman back in Chicago, he tries to join Tracy in Rome and live her lifestyle without much success.Of course, there is much more to the plot. Tracy (Mahogany) takes a big chance and wears her own fashion creation instead of the dress she was to wear at a major fashion show. What happens next provides some meat to the skimpy plot. The wealthy fashion--and women--loving Christian Rosetti (Jean-Pierre Aumont) enters Mahogany's life.How will this change Sean's relationship with Tracy? Will Sean and Brian get along when Brian arrives in Rome to try to share life with Tracy on her terms? How far with Christian go to help Mahogany? What does Christian want from Mahogany? Why is he so interested in her? No spoilers here, folks--you'll have to watch the movie to find out the answers to these questions including the big question as to how the story finally ends.The choreography works wonders for the fashion show scenes and the scenes in the department store early on in the film are thoughtfully presented. The excellent cinematography really shows in the car racing scene and the scenes in which Sean McAvoy takes seemingly endless photos of Mahogany.Overall, this film is just about as pure 1970s ""lite fare"" love story as you're ever going to get. I agree with some reviewers who write that the film could have been shortened a few minutes here and there to make it tighter and better. I highly recommend this film for fans of Diana Ross; and people who like fairy tale type love stories in a modern day setting will enjoy this film, too. It may not be the best flick I've ever seen; but Mahogany pulls its weight without creaking--at least not too loudly.Three and one half stars.",4,enjoy it for what it's worth,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,3072,"['Mahogany', 'story', 'Tracy', 'Chambers', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'young', 'woman', 'Chicago', 'ghetto', 'who', 'endlessly', 'being', 'world-renowned', 'fashion', 'designer', 'men', 'Tracy', 'life', 'bolster', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'film', 'leading', 'actress', 'Far', 'being', 'perfect', 'Ross', 'vehicle', 'remembered', 'be', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'afternoon', 'once', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'found', 'somewhat', 'superficial', 'even', 'when', 'showing', 'Tracy', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'romance', 'political', 'activist', 'Brian', 'Walker', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'action', 'when', 'Tracy', 'working', 'department', 'store', 'going', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'luck', 'noticed', 'famous', 'influential', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'Sean', 'McAvoy', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'most', 'serve', 'only', 'extend', 'movie', 'running', 'length', 'Tracy', 'fired', 'store', 'join', 'Sean', 'McAvoy', 'Rome', 'be', 'designer', 'instead', 'staying', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'Brian', 'Walker.Unfortunately', 'Tracy', 'minute', 'Rome', 'trouble', 'slowly', 'surely', 'life', 'McAvoy', 'callous', 'brute', 'who', 'models', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'depersonalize', 'relationship', 'Sean', 'insecurity', 'insanity', 'also', 'slowly', 'show', 'Sean', 'slashes', 'pictures', 'last', 'greatest', 'fashion', 'model', 'desperate', 'prove', 'manhood', 'Tracy', 'When', 'Brian', 'election', 'Alderman', 'back', 'Chicago', 'join', 'Tracy', 'Rome', 'live', 'lifestyle', 'much', 'success.Of', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'Tracy', 'Mahogany', 'big', 'chance', 'own', 'fashion', 'creation', 'instead', 'dress', 'was', 'wear', 'major', 'fashion', 'show', 'What', 'next', 'meat', 'skimpy', 'plot', 'wealthy', 'fashion', 'women', 'loving', 'Christian', 'Rosetti', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Aumont', 'Mahogany', 'life.How', 'will', 'change', 'Sean', 'relationship', 'Tracy', 'Will', 'Sean', 'Brian', 'get', 'along', 'when', 'Brian', 'Rome', 'try', 'share', 'life', 'Tracy', 'terms', 'How', 'far', 'Christian', 'go', 'help', 'Mahogany', 'What', 'Christian', 'want', 'Mahogany', 'Why', 'so', 'interested', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'questions', 'including', 'big', 'question', 'how', 'story', 'finally', 'ends.The', 'choreography', 'wonders', 'fashion', 'show', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'department', 'store', 'early', 'film', 'are', 'thoughtfully', 'presented', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'really', 'car', 'racing', 'scene', 'scenes', 'Sean', 'McAvoy', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'photos', 'Mahogany.Overall', 'film', 'just', 'about', 'pure', '1970s', 'lite', 'fare', 'love', 'story', ""'re"", 'ever', 'going', 'get', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'write', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', 'few', 'minutes', 'here', 'there', 'make', 'tighter', 'better', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'people', 'who', 'fairy', 'tale', 'type', 'love', 'stories', 'modern', 'day', 'setting', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'too', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Mahogany', 'weight', 'creaking', 'least', 'not', 'too', 'loudly.Three', 'one', 'half', 'stars']",N/A

222804,A2DT16LCU7OEBU,6300216772,Michael Puckett,"[11, 14]","When I first saw this movie I made myself like it. I was very young at the time and a die-hard Ross fan, so I had to like everything she did. As time has passed I've grown more honest with myself, and a lot more realistic  about Diana Ross and the sad fact that she has a propensity to pick and  perform mediocre material.Mahogany is a perfect example of one of those  projects that on it's face had potential but was ruined by the hacks who  were hired to bring it to the screen. First, Berry Gordy fired Tony  Richardson the original director because he didn't know how to achieve  ""Blackness"" in his direction. Then, he (Gordy) takes over the direction and  goes for every Hollywood cliche he can pack into one film.The plot is  the tired story of a poor working class girl who makes good in the fashion  world and then throws it all away to go back to a life of failure just to  be with the man she loves. Let's face it, this story has been told so many  times before, it has become it's own genre.Ross plays Tracy Chambers,  the heroine in our story, with style and intensity, and she even manages to  win you over in a few scenes but just when you think things are getting  better, something really dumb happens.Billy Dee Williams plays a loser  politician who spouts out more BS in his speeches than any real politician  ever has in real life. If you had the chance you would definitely vote for  the other guy.  Tracy had it right when she left this jerk.Tony Perkins  plays a crazed homosexual trying to prove to himself he's not really gay by  making love to Tracy, in a scene that feels so sleezy that you'll want to  shower after viewing it.To be fair there are a few moments in this  melodrama that give you a look at the immense talent that was wasted here,  like where Brian and Tracy have a huge fight and she tells him she dosn't  need him, (Very good acting on Ross' part) and where Tracy helps Brian in  his campaign and tells him it's all just show biz. But the real high point  of this film is the beautifully filmed and edited fashion montage with  Diana being transformed into the glamorous Mahogany set to the instrumental  version of ""Do You Know Where You're Going To?""

I didn't really believe that the two of them were really in love. It just seemed like Williams yelled at Ross for her beliefs (mainly because he was a political figure in the film) and told her what to do all the time.

The other Amazon reviews clearly show the excitment this film generates among Diana Ross fans.It's the  story of a young woman who wants to break out of a Chicago ghetto by becoming a successful fashion designer.  Diana actually designed the clothes...(let's just call them ""high fashion"").  The character quickly breaks out of the ghetto by becoming a highly successful fashion model, via some pretty freak breaks.But she still wants to be a designer.  And what about the man she left behind?  Does she turn her back on him, and try to live out her dream of designing, accompanied by several men that adore her in the fashion world? Well, you just have to watch the movie to find out.Sounds hokey?  You got it.  Along the way there are extended montages of Diana. Left with a hokey script that takes itself very seriously and shots of Diana, Diana, Diana...it sometimes becomes camp and has become a successful entry in that genre.The movie would have worked better with a soundtrack that had more vocals by Diana Ross, and been an extended music video movie, simliar to ""FlashDance"".  But the powers that be wanted Diana to rely on acting only, with no singing. . After this, Diana played ""Dorothy"", in ""The Wiz"".  Great talent, poor choices.Update:  Maybe Diana's fashions were just ahead of her time.  A review from a recent fashion show in LA, said, ""The day's other big show was from Kevan Hall, who took inspiration from ""Mahogany,"" Berry Gordy's deliciously cheesy 1975 film.  , Hall captured the 1970s look that's all over the streets now..""Harumph..who knew?",4,A Must for Ross Fans...Others Approach With Caution,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,1672,"['Mahogany', 'must', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'fans', 'great', 'well', 'even', 'diva', 'fit', 'other', 'Amazon', 'clearly', 'show', 'excitment', 'film', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'fans.It', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'break', 'Chicago', 'ghetto', 'becoming', 'successful', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Diana', 'actually', 'designed', 'clothes', 'let', 'just', 'call', 'high', 'fashion', 'character', 'quickly', 'ghetto', 'becoming', 'highly', 'successful', 'fashion', 'model', 'pretty', 'freak', 'breaks.But', 'still', 'be', 'designer', 'what', 'man', 'left', 'behind', 'turn', 'back', 'try', 'live', 'out', 'dream', 'designing', 'accompanied', 'several', 'men', 'adore', 'fashion', 'world', 'Well', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out.Sounds', 'hokey', 'got', 'way', 'are', 'extended', 'montages', 'Diana', 'Left', 'hokey', 'script', 'very', 'seriously', 'shots', 'Diana', 'Diana', 'Diana', 'sometimes', 'camp', 'become', 'successful', 'entry', 'genre.The', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'more', 'vocals', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'been', 'extended', 'music', 'video', 'movie', 'simliar', 'FlashDance', 'powers', 'be', 'wanted', 'Diana', 'rely', 'acting', 'only', 'singing', 'Diana', 'played', 'Dorothy', 'Wiz', 'Great', 'talent', 'poor', 'choices.Update', 'Maybe', 'Diana', 'fashions', 'were', 'just', 'ahead', 'time', 'review', 'recent', 'fashion', 'show', 'LA', 'said', 'day', 'other', 'big', 'show', 'was', 'Kevan', 'Hall', 'who', 'took', 'inspiration', 'Mahogany', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'deliciously', 'cheesy', '1975', 'film', 'Hall', 'captured', '1970s', 'look', 'streets', 'Harumph..who', 'knew']",N/A

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[4, 9]","Somewhere between the adulations of Ross fans, and the glum remarks of *Mahogany* detractors, lies the truth about *Mahogany*. It is indeed ALL the things it has been called -- from wretched to glorious. But, then again, don't ALL Kweenie Klassix have elements of trash and treasure?""And now, Mahogany presents...the Kabuki Finale!"" This is the movie that made me want to be a fashion designer *and* a drag queen. Who else would be able to sit through this tripe? But if you're a designer *or* a drag queen, or at least play one on TV, this is *delectable* tripe. Just like in *Mommie Dearest* when you *know* you're looking into the heart of Joan Crawford, *Mahogany* makes you feel as if you're looking into the heart of Diana Ross. A vanity production to beat *all* vanity productions, Mr. Gordy showcases his star (who was also his lover, *and*, we now know, mother of his child) in her first non-singing film -- her only other previous film being *Lady Sings The Blues*. In this self-serving tale of the perils of stardom, Diana, as Tracy Chambers, scales the heights of the glamour and glitter of international high fashion and plummets directly into Bad-Movie-Hall-Of-Fame. Tracy is in school to be a fashion designer, and we know this because we see her riding the bus around town sketching big drag queen-y outfits. But one humiliating interview follows another (Diana *excels* in demonstrating humiliation - lots of teeth-gnashing and tossing her head), and life looks grim. She becomes involved with the local neighborhood activist (this *is* the Seventies), played by the devastatingly handsome, but not deeply talented Billy Dee Williams. He wants to make the world a *better* place, and *she* just wants to make it a *prettier* place. She goes off on her own but life has its campy highs and lows for Diana/Tracy - along the way she loses Tracy and becomes Mahogany and reaches the pinnacle of the fashion world, but it's not without its trade-offs. I have a particularly favorite scene where Ross is in her element - as the prima donna couturierre, she parades through her workroom, issuing demands and dictums, and eventually becomes entirely unglued, shrieking and cursing at her workers, who, not speaking English, have no idea what she's carrying on about. This scene seems to sum up Ross herself, as so many in this movie do, and she is utterly delightful - but *not* in a pleasant way. Of course, it's inevitable that Mahogany will chuck her entire career in the trash and go home to Mr. Right, having learned her lesson about the ugly business of beautiful clothes, and the viewer sighs a sigh of palpable relief that this movie, this monument to egotism, has finally come to an end.

222822,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6300216772,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","After ""Lady Sings The Blues"" became not only a boxoffice hit but a critical smash, Paramount wanted to capitilize on the allure of Diana Ross at the movies. Fresh from winning an Oscar nomination as Best Actress for ""Lady"", Diana stars in this small film about a woman who grew up poor in the projects to being one of the most famous fashion designers in the world. The movie is definitely a Diana Ross film in more ways than one; the script was tailored for her and there is a lot of Diana in the lines of the film. It was actually Diana's first choice in her younger days to be a fashion designer, but ultimately her powerful voice gave way to her becoming one of the greatest singers of all-time. Most of the fashions used in ""Mahogany"" are Diana Ross originals. Diana also demanded, and got, her ""Lady"" co-star Billy Dee Williams for this film, and their chemistry is impeccable. The theme from ""Mahogany"" titled ""Do You Know Where Your going To?"" is one of the most beautiful and haunting movie songs ever. The DVD is pretty much a barebones edition but it comes in widescreen and is enhanced for 16.9 TVs, a photo gallery is included, and english subtitles are a part of the package.",5,""" My Diva Diana!""",1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,1189,"['Lady', 'Blues', 'became', 'not', 'only', 'boxoffice', 'hit', 'critical', 'smash', 'Paramount', 'wanted', 'capitilize', 'allure', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'movies', 'Fresh', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Lady', 'Diana', 'small', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'poor', 'projects', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'fashion', 'designers', 'world', 'movie', 'definitely', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'film', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'script', 'was', 'tailored', 'lot', 'Diana', 'lines', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'Diana', 'first', 'choice', 'younger', 'days', 'be', 'fashion', 'designer', 'ultimately', 'powerful', 'voice', 'gave', 'way', 'becoming', 'one', 'greatest', 'singers', 'all-time', 'Most', 'fashions', 'used', 'Mahogany', 'are', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'originals', 'Diana', 'also', 'demanded', 'got', 'Lady', 'co-star', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'film', 'chemistry', 'impeccable', 'theme', 'Mahogany', 'titled', 'Do', 'Know', 'Where', 'going', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'movie', 'songs', 'ever', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'barebones', 'edition', 'widescreen', 'enhanced', '16.9', 'TVs', 'photo', 'gallery', 'included', 'english', 'subtitles', 'are', 'part', 'package']",N/A

Because no one in their right mind is going to turn their back on a glamorous career that is earning them millions of dollars just because they think they can't live without the person they love. This is the stuff that fairy tales are made of, and ""Mahogany"" is sort of a modern day urban fairy tale, one that we can't really believe would happen if this was a true story. The old Hollywood formulas and cliches for love stories are in full effect here. For all that money, you could find PLENTY of people to love you...LOL. But I do admit, I enjoyed this film. It's one of my guilty pleasures.The idea of this film was to create a project for Diana Ross where she would not have to sing a single note in it like she did in ""Lady Sings The Blues"", and the focus would be on her acting skills. Diana did, however, sing the theme song (""Do You Know Where You're Going To"") for the movie. With Motown CEO Berry Gordy, Jr. in the director's chair (the original director, Tony Richardson, quit after Gordy's constant meddling), Ross portrays Tracy, a secretary/aspiring fashion student who has dreams of making it big and getting out of the Chicago ghetto where she lives. She is very convincing as well...very diva-ish and overdramatic. Anthony Perkins' role as the deranged Sean (aka Norman Bates turned a jealous and possessive high-fashion photographer) is clearly the best role in the entire film. Although ""One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest"" star Jack Nicholson was originally the first choice for this role, Perkins plays his part to the hilt and really looks like he is enjoying himself. He helps Tracy get in the business as a model, but only sees her as a product and doesn't want to nurture her need to be independent or her true desire to be a designer. This is where these two constantly bump heads throughout the film. Perkins steals this film and was predictably humorous but also very creepy, especially when he has a confrontation with Billy Dee Williams at a party and reveals himself to be totally psychotic.Based on the excellent chemistry he and Ross displayed in ""Lady Sings The Blues"", Billy Dee Williams was again paired with Ross in this movie as Brian, Tracy's love interest. He is the one who spouts that famous line from this movie, but yet when Tracy attempts to share her success with him, he doesn't want it. But this movie is great to watch...a little campy, but yet very entertaining. Get it and grab the popcorn.
