671194,A1WXCMB52BON8N,B00005O0SO,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Loosely based on the real life story of Olive Campbell, 'Songcatcher' is the story of Lily Panleric, a priggish but well-meaning American academic who adores the folk music of the British Isles, training her students to appreciate the emotional purity that folk music possesses. When she is denied a coveted music professorship, she packs it in and decides to visit her sister who runs a ragged school in the Appalachian mountains. She then discovers the locals know a huge store of English folk ballads like 'Barbry Allen', and in versions even purer than survive in England. This leads to some interesting debate with the locals on whether the music should be shared with outsiders, or whether that would compromise its purity. Eventually she convinces them, and sets out to capture the music on wax phonograph cylinders (this being pre-vinyl 1907).From an artistic perspective 'Songcatcher' isn't a very good film (mediocre acting and Hollywood-style melodrama) but that isn't the reason you should watch it. The reason to watch it is the subject matter, the beauty of the songs, and the store of ancestral memories they contain.",4,A few things you should know about 'Songcatcher',1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,1132,"['Loosely', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'Olive', 'Campbell', ""'Songcatcher"", 'story', 'Lily', 'Panleric', 'priggish', 'well-meaning', 'American', 'academic', 'who', 'folk', 'music', 'British', 'Isles', 'training', 'students', 'appreciate', 'emotional', 'purity', 'folk', 'music', 'possesses', 'When', 'denied', 'coveted', 'music', 'professorship', 'decides', 'visit', 'sister', 'who', 'ragged', 'school', 'Appalachian', 'mountains', 'then', 'locals', 'know', 'huge', 'store', 'English', 'folk', 'ballads', ""'Barbry"", 'Allen', 'versions', 'even', 'purer', 'survive', 'England', 'interesting', 'debate', 'locals', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'shared', 'outsiders', 'would', 'compromise', 'purity', 'Eventually', 'out', 'capture', 'music', 'wax', 'phonograph', 'cylinders', 'being', 'pre-vinyl', '1907', 'artistic', 'perspective', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'film', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'Hollywood-style', 'melodrama', ""n't"", 'reason', 'should', 'watch', 'reason', 'watch', 'subject', 'matter', 'beauty', 'songs', 'store', 'ancestral', 'memories', 'contain']",Songcatcher

It is a recital strung together with the flimsiest of narratives.  Naturally, this will please people who want a recital of this particular music.Second, the narrative material is almost solely concerned with feminism: lesbianism, the single independent woman, childbirth, mistreated wives, drunken husbands, too many children, etc.The view of the mountain people is totally from the POV of an outsider, not merely the main character (who IS an outsider) but the filmmaker.  It's not that the view of mountain people is wholly negative.  It isn't.  But there is no understanding of these people.  The main character does not come to an understanding of them, nor do we, the audience.That she would give up her work and her career at the end strains credibility, especially when an eminent scholar comes to assist her and she is thus guaranteed success as well as advancement in her career.Finally, what has she got at the end?  What and who is the Aidan Quinn character?  And what does she see in him?  We haven't a clue (except that he IS Aidan Quinn and is cute).But then, we should have guessed that this would be a dud from the fact that it won a prize at the Sundance Film Festival.

Still, I was so disappointed by the second half of this film that I can't find a four-star rating in me.It's a gorgeous film set in the Appalachian Mountains, an early 20th century story of a highly intelligent lady musicologist who is obsessed with capturing the history of the folk music of the British Isles.  When she hits the glass ceiling of her day, her college passing her over yet again for a man in spite of her extreme qualification, she heads for the hills.  Literally.Her younger sister runs a school in the mountains among that most derided minority, the hillbillies (or, more properly, &quot;mountain folk&quot;).  Big kudos to this film for playing more or less fair with the poor people of the mountains, with few caricatures and mostly just good-hearted people who distrust &quot;the world beyond.&quot;  Here the good doctor finds a wealth of old British folk music that has been handed down from generation to generation, as the ancestors of these folk came from the islands themselves.&quot;Songcatcher&quot; is well worth seeing, due to its brilliant handling of its unique subject matter.  It is also a cautionary tale for filmmakers who think they have to throw too much into their story.  It could be said that the multiple tragedies in this film are a way of thematically representing the repetitive theme of tragedies in the old folk music the doctor is collecting, but it's overkill, pure and simple, and further ruins such effect with a silly ending.  I'm glad I saw it, but would prefer to have an edited version featuring only the musical performances, which are stunning.There is a lot to love about &quot;Songcatcher.&quot;  It's a treasure trove for an education in how music was developed in those pre-commercial days, and the lengths to which its devotees had to go for its preservation.  If you love any kind of music, you owe a big debt of gratitude to people like this.  It is mesmerizing to see the mountain people performing the music of their heritage in its natural setting.Beyond that, it's a typical formula story, and that's what leaves me cold about this confused film.  Formula element 1:  The Outsider who learns to communicate with and appreciate a society in which she is initially very uncomfortable, while said society learns to deal with her as well.  Some will not accept her, but she wins most of them over.  Formula element 2:  A forbidden romance causes serious unrest and, ultimately, tragedy.  There are actually two such story lines in this film.  Formula element 3:  An ambitious woman, living in less rational times, deals with the frustration of being thwarted in her dreams.  Formula element 4:  The happy ending you could see coming a mile off.I really hate that the filmmakers felt they had to throw so many elements into what could have been an excellent little film.  Most unsettling is that they set up several confrontations that all reach a climax within a minute or two of each other, completely fouling up the otherwise nice pace they had set to that point in the film's final half-hour.",3,"Dr. Quinn, Music Woman",1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,3094,"['OK', 'maybe', 'not', 'THAT', 'bad', 'Still', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'four-star', 'rating', 'me.It', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'set', 'Appalachian', 'Mountains', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'story', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'lady', 'musicologist', 'who', 'obsessed', 'capturing', 'history', 'folk', 'music', 'British', 'Isles', 'When', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'day', 'college', 'passing', 'over', 'yet', 'again', 'man', 'spite', 'extreme', 'qualification', 'hills', 'Literally.Her', 'younger', 'sister', 'school', 'mountains', 'most', 'derided', 'minority', 'hillbillies', 'more', 'properly', 'quot', 'folk', 'quot', 'Big', 'kudos', 'film', 'playing', 'more', 'less', 'fair', 'poor', 'people', 'mountains', 'few', 'caricatures', 'mostly', 'just', 'good-hearted', 'people', 'who', 'distrust', 'quot', 'world', 'beyond.', 'quot', 'Here', 'good', 'doctor', 'wealth', 'old', 'British', 'folk', 'music', 'been', 'handed', 'down', 'generation', 'generation', 'ancestors', 'folk', 'came', 'islands', 'themselves.', 'quot', 'Songcatcher', 'quot', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'due', 'brilliant', 'handling', 'unique', 'subject', 'matter', 'also', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'throw', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'multiple', 'tragedies', 'film', 'are', 'way', 'thematically', 'representing', 'repetitive', 'theme', 'tragedies', 'old', 'folk', 'music', 'doctor', 'collecting', 'overkill', 'pure', 'simple', 'further', 'ruins', 'such', 'effect', 'silly', 'ending', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'would', 'prefer', 'have', 'edited', 'version', 'featuring', 'only', 'musical', 'performances', 'are', 'lot', 'love', 'quot', 'Songcatcher.', 'quot', 'treasure', 'trove', 'education', 'how', 'music', 'was', 'developed', 'pre-commercial', 'days', 'lengths', 'devotees', 'had', 'go', 'preservation', 'love', 'kind', 'music', 'owe', 'big', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'people', 'mesmerizing', 'see', 'mountain', 'people', 'performing', 'music', 'heritage', 'natural', 'setting.Beyond', 'typical', 'formula', 'story', 'what', 'cold', 'confused', 'film', 'Formula', 'element', '1', 'Outsider', 'who', 'communicate', 'appreciate', 'society', 'initially', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'said', 'society', 'learns', 'deal', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'most', 'over', 'Formula', 'element', '2', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'serious', 'unrest', 'ultimately', 'tragedy', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'such', 'story', 'lines', 'film', 'Formula', 'element', '3', 'ambitious', 'woman', 'living', 'less', 'rational', 'times', 'deals', 'frustration', 'being', 'thwarted', 'dreams', 'Formula', 'element', '4', 'happy', 'ending', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'off.I', 'really', 'hate', 'filmmakers', 'felt', 'had', 'throw', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'little', 'film', 'Most', 'unsettling', 'set', 'up', 'several', 'confrontations', 'reach', 'climax', 'minute', 'two', 'other', 'completely', 'fouling', 'up', 'otherwise', 'nice', 'pace', 'had', 'set', 'point', 'film', 'final', 'half-hour']",Songcatcher

671208,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00005O0SO,Chris Luallen,"[3, 3]","Dr. Lily Penleric is a professor of music who, while visiting her sister Elna's settlement school in the North Carolina mountains, finds she has uncovered a treasure trove of lost English and Scotish folk ballads among the rural residents.Lily proceeds to record these songs on phonograph cylinders as she comes into contact with local singers and musicians, such as a young girl named Deladis, wise, old Viney Butler and a talented banjo and guitar player, Tom Bledsoe, who becomes her love interest in the film.What works about this movie is the outstanding cinematography that successfully captures the green, rugged beauty of the Southern mountains. Also the incredible music, which features classic folk songs such as ""Barbara Allen"" and cameo performances by Taj Mahal and Iris Dement. But the film's subplots, particularly the lesbian relationship between Elna and an older woman named Harriet as well as the unlikely romance between the intellectual, artistocratic Lily and the hard drinking, hillbilly Tom, seem extremely forced and unrealistic considering the historical and regional context of the film. Also the secondary characters lack nuance and complexity, typically shown as either having hearts of gold, like sweet, innocent Deladis, or as violent, intolerant brutes, such as Deladis' boyfriend Fate.I have family roots going back to the early 1800's in the mountains of North Carolina and can promise you that this is definitely a simplified Hollywood version of Southern mountain life rather than a realistic portrayal of this region and it's people in the early 1900's.

In other words, it's an intelligent story about a woman overcoming many obstacles as an outsider.In this film, a historian comes to rural America to record the local folk music, which she believes comes from Europe. At first the woman is viewed with suspicion by the locals, until she earns their respect. It's a familiar tale, but well done here.Besides the great folk tunes, one also appreciates the film's respect for the local people. Too often in Hollywood, poor people (especially poor southerners) are portrayed stereotypically. Not in this film.More and more this type of film premieres on cable, because it is seen as &quot;too small&quot; for a theatrical release. This is really a shame, because to fully appreciate this film's wonderful cinematography and art direction, you need to see it on the big screen. For those that can't, the small screen is perhaps the only alternative.If you love folk music or any of its musical cousins like the blues and country, you'll want to experience this charming film. For those who only listen to contemporary music, it might not be your cup of tea. If you're not sure, give it a spin in your VCR or DVD player, you just might like it. The dramatic performances are also very good.

Songcatcher is an intriguing story of musicologist Professor Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer) and her determination to record traditional English ballads which had been preserved by the secluded Appalachian mountain people, whose ancestors brought the songs to America during the Colonial period of the 18th century. There's a romantic interest of course, when Lily meets Tom Bledsoe, played by Aiden Quinn. But the film isn't dominated by the two stars - there's some fine acting by a splendid ensemble cast. The real star of the film, however, is the music - almost everyone sings the old ballads, and Lily has a field day recording the songs with the primitive recording equipment of the early 20th century. There are more than a dozen of the old ballads, performed very capably by singers like Iris DeMent, Emmylou Harris, Emmy Rossum, Maria McKee, and others. Even veteran actress Pat Carroll has a go at singing.I was a little disappointed by the ending. It's done very well, and has the film ending on an upbeat note, but I couldn't help wishing that Lily had made a different choice about the direction her life would go.

671230,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005O0SO,Lawyeraau,"[162, 166]","This is a beautiful and unusual film, made even more so by its joyous celebration of folk music. Beautifully nuanced, well paced, and highly absorbing, this haunting film is an absolute gem. It is no wonder that it won the 2000 Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance. The performances in this film are simply stellar and worthy of recognition.The year is 1907, and the highly independent and intelligent Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer), a noted musicologist, has once again been passed over for promotion by the college at which she teaches. Angry, she decides to pull up stakes and go to visit her sister, Elna (Jane Adams), who is one of two women teaching at a settlement school in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina.When Janet arrives, she hears one of her sister's helpers, Deladis (Emma Rossum), singing an old folk song that she recognizes. It is being sung in a way that she has never before heard it sung. Upon discovering that the song was handed down generationally in this insular community, she realizes that she may actually be hearing the song as it may originally have been intended to be sung. Excited by her discovery, she sets about capturing as many songs as she can from these fiercely proud, mountain people. In effect, she is memorializing a rich, oral, musical history.Her project takes Janet on a voyage of self-discovery, both personal and professional. Along the way, she becomes immersed in the the lives and traditions of these mountain people, realizing what an integral part music plays in their lives. While poor in terms of creature comforts and leading a harsh, hardscrabble sort of life, these mountain folks have a culturally rich, oral tradition and are a  veritable treasure trove of old songs.While catching the music and lyrics of these old songs for posterity and wider appreciation, notating her discovery of these songs for a book that she hopes to write, Dr. Penleric makes the acquaintance of a number of mountain men and women, including a tough old bird, Viney Butler (Pat Carroll). This leads to meeting with Viney's suspicious but intelligent, talented, and good looking grandson, Tom Bledsoe (Aidan Quinn), with whom she ultimately developes a passionate relationship that correlates nicely to her passion for music.A number of other subplots are woven throughout this film. One involves her sister, Elna, who becomes involved with a love that dare not speak its name. There is also a love triangle between two of the mountain woman and the husband of one of them. Young love and coming of age are also themes that are touched upon. Meanwhile, a mining company seeks to buy out the land from under these people for a mere pittance. All of these subplots serve to illustrate the often harsh reality of life in the mountains. The only problem that I found was with the subplot involving Elna and her lover, Harriet, in terms of the complacency that surrounds what ultimately happens to Harriet. It was a most disturbing resolution that did not ring altogether true. Still, the overall strength of the film is such that it overcomes this incongruity.Janet McTeer gives a no nonsense performance, and the way that the music seems to transfix and transform her is a joy to behold. Jane Adams, as Elna, gives an exquisitely beautiful and sensitive performance, as does E. Katherine Kerr in the role of Harriet, the settlement school teacher with whom Elna is involved. Aidan Quinn gives an intelligent and thoughtful performance as a mountain man who has been to the outside world and found it wanting. Pat Carroll is sensational as Viney Butler, the mountain woman who takes the vicissitudes of life in stride and wears many hats: mother, grandmother, midwife, musician, singer, and oral historian. Emma Rossum, however, is positively radiant as the young, fresh faced, mountain lass with a smile and voice that will tear your heart apart. She is a wonderful, young performer with operatic training and the ability to sing like Dolly Parton. What a find!Cameo appearances by Taj Mahal, Iris Dement, and others serve to further enrich this film. The music and songs are played and sung live, which makes them resonate with authenticity and adds a vibrancy that might otherwise be lost. The folk dancing is a joy to watch, as the mountain people gather around for a jamboree. The film, shot on location, captures all the physical beauty of the terrain, as well as the rusticity and harshness of life in the mountains. This is simply a great film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.The DVD is first rate, providing a clear, quality picture and great sound. It offers a wonderful commentary with the director, Maggie Greenwald, that explains the underpinnings of the film. There is also an interesting feature on the making of the film. All in all, it is a must have DVD for music lovers, as well as for those who simply enjoy a well made and beautifully acted film.

671231,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005O0SO,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","Maggie Greenwald who directed ""Get a Clue"" with Lindsey Lohan for Disney cable directed this picture.  Made in 2000, it did not result in a huge break for her into larger features.  Janet McTeer was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for ""Tumbleweeds"" in 1999, and then took this role as Dr. Lily Penleric.  In 1910, Penleric was an anomaly, an independent educated woman.  In her era, the glass ceiling was made of opaque colored glass; and she could not get a promotion at her university into tenured faculty.  They would bring a man from outside the college so they did not have to promote her.  In what was a less than progressive note, the only vote she could get was by having an extra-marital affair with dumpy professor.  As a doctor of music who is fascinated with folk songs, her name ""Penleric"" sounds appropriate like ""pen lyric"" or someone who writes down songs.  She heads to the mountains to stay with her sister, Elna Penleric.  Elna is teaching school with another teacher.  I'd have to watch the film again to be 100% sure, but I think the character is Harriet Tolliver played by E. Katharine Kerr.  While the senior teacher is older than Elna, she apparently has charms that lead Elna played by Jane Adams into a secretive lesbian relationship.  Ironically, McTeer's Lily Penleric seems more masculine than her sister.  However, Lily falls for mountain man Tom Bledsoe played by Aiden Quinn.  Bledsoe has outlived two wives and becomes intrigued by Penleric after initially disliking her. Veteran actress Pat Carroll plays Viney Butler who knows a lot of folk songs that have been passed down from previous generations.  Carroll received a Best Supporting Actress nomination from the Independent Spirit Awards for her role.  Deladis Slocumb is played by the tuneful newcomer Emmy Rossum who sings sweetly and knows many songs she learned from her family.  The evil coal man Earl Giddens who tries to scoop up the mountain farms for coal mining is played by David Patrick Kelly with a sniveling arrogance that makes him fun to dislike.  Michael Harding plays Reese Kincaid who two-times his pregnant wife with the wrong mountain mistress and winds up the film with a big bang.  Small cameo roles are played by musicians Taj Mahal and Iris DeMent who play and sing with gusto.  This film won the Jury Prize from Sundance Film Festival for Best Ensemble Performance.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the film reflects values of love, loyalty, respect and abiding friendship that make it overall a heartwarming experience.

671232,A3J9V8R4PYA9GW,B00005O0SO,"lisebouvier ""lisebouvier""","[20, 31]","And unless you are a true fan of mountain music, rent before buying. Though I'm not an expert or particular fan, even I could tell that it is rich and unique music, and deserves a better setting than this cliched and sometimes anachronistic movie, which often felt like a product of Screenwriting 101.There are so many problems with the story I hardly know where to start. Perhaps the romance between Mcteer's flatland academic, and Quinn's mountain man. This has been done so many times...some of their exchanges were so stereotyped they made me groan. For example, city woman Lily (McTeer) attends her first bloody, violent childbirth. Predictably, she flings at Quinn's character: &quot;You have no idea what that woman has just been through.&quot; Just as predictably, he responds with a story that shows, yes, he does know; and which makes her, of course, sound unbearably self-righteous.Also predictably, they go in an instant from sparring to kissing. Admittedly, the transition was not handled the way I expected. Though who didn't know, the instant Tom's Granny tells Lily (McTeer) how to escape a panther, and she laughs at the idea, that she is inevitably going to end up in a scene doing just exactly what she did?The one cliche avoided was that this was not used to humiliate her by, for example, having her emerge from the woods in front of a crowd of people. Probably this is the advantage of a woman director.Aidan Quinn's performance kept me awake, however, even when he was confined by stereotype. I found it more difficult to warm to McTeer. I know she was meant to be stiff to show contrast with the mountain people, and I know a certain amount of stiffness is true to the early 20th century period. However, it was a bit too much for my taste, though that may be the director's fault, not hers.I also enjoyed Jane Adam's performance. I wasn't put off by the lesbian storyline as some viewers were. It was at least an interesting twist to the &quot;prim schoolmarm&quot; character.However, the confrontation between Lily and her sister is keyed more for modern ears, and is shallowly characterized. Schoolteachers of that era were held to such high moral standards that Lily's shock and anger wouldn't make her a bigot. It would have been shocking if she'd found her unmarried sister in bed with a man. I also felt Elna (Adams) would have shown more confusion and surprise at what she had discovered about herself. Her acceptance is very modern.The mistake with this storyline, however, was carrying it too far. It took over the story, and the final (tolerant) outcome wasn't believable. Again, keyed a little too much toward modern sensibilities.The biggest mistake, however, was in failing to address the real issue: How is Lily going to repay these people for the incredible gift she is getting from them? How to record their music without (as Tom puts it) exploiting them? The people are so poor they are selling their land for a fraction of its value. The real story, then, should have been about Lily finding a way to resolve this dilemma, to pay them for their music, so they can keep their land and live in their old ways.Instead she virtually abandons her work, at the very moment she can count on unlimited funding, recognition, and an eager assistant. She goes to the city to record mountain music (which doesn't quite make sense), because she thinks there will be a market for it. But wouldn't there be a better market if she continued her work and published her book, making the mountain people famous?

The great Taj Mahal has a chance to show his stuff, especially on the DVD extras.The wonderful Iris de Ment also has a chance to shine.

671256,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005O0SO,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[8, 12]","Songcatcher (Maggie Greewnwald, 2000)I am usually a big fan of just about anything IFC Films releases, but for some reason I could never put my finger on, I always shied away from Songcatcher, despite being a fan (and, casually, a student) of Mr. Child and his wonderful work collecting hundreds of ballads and their almost endless variations. Turns out I actually didn't have all that much to regret.Songcatcher will likely be best remembered for being the movie that introduced rising star Emmy Rossum to the big screen. Rossum plays Deladis Slocumb, an Appalachian schoolgirl who knows how to sing. But I get ahead of myself. The story centers around Lily Penleric (Waking the Dead's Janet McTeer), a musicologist from the east coast who, disillusioned with her suffocating relationship with a married man, goes to visit her sister Elena (Wonder Boys' Jane Adams), a schoolteacher in the wilds of Appalachia. She lives at the town's school with Harriet (Next Stop Wonderland's Kaetherine Kerr), the other schoolteacher, and Deladis. One evening, Deladis absentmindedly begins singing a tune that Lily recognizes as a variation on a Scots ballad, and she quickly comes to realize that the Appalachians have a tradition of ballad variants as yet uncharted. A fine summer project for a young academic who keeps getting passed over for promotion, eh?And if the film had stayed this simple, it would have been a fine one. But, of course, it doesn't; the movie was marketed as a love story, and a love story it is, however shoehorned-in that love story seems. And it's a tried old thing, it is, with a plot so fresh it's only be used in a select few dozen thousand Harlequin romances. Lily meets up with Tom (Aidan Quinn), a local guitarist who thinks her work is going to demean the music, and the people, of the mountains. But, needless to say, he's a man, and she's a woman, and therefore there must be a romance. It's extraneous, and rather silly, and gets in the way of the ballads. Still, if you're a fan of Child and his good work, you'll get at least something out of this. ** ",3,Extraneous subplots get in the way of the ballads.,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2082,"['Songcatcher', 'Maggie', 'Greewnwald', '2000', 'am', 'usually', 'big', 'fan', 'just', 'anything', 'IFC', 'Films', 'reason', 'could', 'never', 'put', 'finger', 'always', 'shied', 'away', 'Songcatcher', 'being', 'fan', 'casually', 'student', 'Mr.', 'Child', 'wonderful', 'work', 'collecting', 'hundreds', 'ballads', 'almost', 'endless', 'variations', 'out', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'regret.Songcatcher', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'best', 'remembered', 'being', 'movie', 'introduced', 'rising', 'star', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'big', 'screen', 'Rossum', 'Deladis', 'Slocumb', 'Appalachian', 'schoolgirl', 'who', 'how', 'sing', 'get', 'ahead', 'story', 'centers', 'Lily', 'Penleric', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'musicologist', 'east', 'coast', 'who', 'disillusioned', 'suffocating', 'relationship', 'married', 'man', 'visit', 'sister', 'Elena', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'schoolteacher', 'wilds', 'Appalachia', 'town', 'school', 'Harriet', 'Next', 'Stop', 'Wonderland', 'Kaetherine', 'Kerr', 'other', 'schoolteacher', 'Deladis', 'One', 'evening', 'Deladis', 'absentmindedly', 'singing', 'tune', 'Lily', 'variation', 'Scots', 'ballad', 'quickly', 'realize', 'Appalachians', 'have', 'tradition', 'ballad', 'variants', 'yet', 'uncharted', 'fine', 'summer', 'project', 'young', 'academic', 'who', 'getting', 'passed', 'promotion', 'eh', 'film', 'had', 'stayed', 'simple', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'one', 'course', ""n't"", 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'story', 'however', 'shoehorned-in', 'love', 'story', 'tried', 'old', 'thing', 'plot', 'so', 'fresh', 'only', 'be', 'used', 'select', 'few', 'dozen', 'thousand', 'Harlequin', 'romances', 'Lily', 'up', 'Tom', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'local', 'guitarist', 'who', 'work', 'going', 'demean', 'music', 'people', 'mountains', 'needless', 'say', 'man', 'woman', 'therefore', 'must', 'be', 'romance', 'extraneous', 'rather', 'silly', 'way', 'ballads', 'Still', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Child', 'good', 'work', ""'ll"", 'get', 'least', 'something', '**']",Songcatcher

671265,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,B00005O0SO,Theo Logos,"[4, 5]","Songcatcher is an enchanting film of incredible sights and sounds. Filmed on location in Appalachia, it captures the stunning, harsh beauty of the mountain landscape, while serenading us with the raw, powerful, amazing music that was preserved for generations in those mountains. It is the cinematography and soundtrack that are the true stars of this film, making the story and actors almost superfluous.That's not to say that there aren't some fine performances in Songcatcher. Janet McTeer convincingly plays ethnomusicologist Dr. Lily Penleric as the uptight outlander who is captured by the purity of the mountain songs. Pat Carroll delivers the films stand-out performance with her brilliant portrayal of Viney Butler, the tough, wise, resourceful mountain grandma who befriends Dr. Penleric, and who represents the heart of the mountain culture.Unfortunately, Songcatcher's story contains some glaring anachronisms which played havoc with my suspension of disbelief, and served as pesky distractions from this otherwise superb film. Dr. Penleric is launched into her mountain journey when she is unfairly denied a promotion to full professor, but in the world of 1907, as a woman, she would not have been any kind of professor at a prestigious university. (This anachronism is even acknowledge in the commentary track on the DVD,) The second anachronism involves the secret lesbian affair of Lily's sister, Eleanor (Jane Adams). While I have no doubt that such relationships happened in 1907,  Eleanor's easy and guilt free attitude about it has more in common with our contemporary culture, and rings false for the moralizing Edwardian age of the first decade of the 20th century. In both cases, these anachronisms are crucial to moving the story, and are not easily ignored.Despite the problems of the story, this is still an excellent film. It expertly captures the unique mountain culture, as well as offering a visual and auditory feast for the senses. Fans of old time Appalachian music should consider Songcatcher mandatory viewing, and even those without a particular interest in the subject may find themselves swept up by the magic of these songs.Theo Logos",4,Music & Landscape are the Stars of Songcatcher,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2174,"['Songcatcher', 'enchanting', 'film', 'incredible', 'sights', 'sounds', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Appalachia', 'stunning', 'harsh', 'beauty', 'mountain', 'landscape', 'serenading', 'raw', 'powerful', 'amazing', 'music', 'was', 'preserved', 'generations', 'mountains', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'true', 'stars', 'film', 'making', 'story', 'actors', 'almost', 'superfluous.That', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'fine', 'performances', 'Songcatcher', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'convincingly', 'ethnomusicologist', 'Dr.', 'Lily', 'Penleric', 'uptight', 'outlander', 'who', 'captured', 'purity', 'mountain', 'songs', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'films', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Viney', 'Butler', 'tough', 'wise', 'resourceful', 'mountain', 'grandma', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Penleric', 'who', 'heart', 'mountain', 'culture.Unfortunately', 'Songcatcher', 'story', 'glaring', 'anachronisms', 'played', 'havoc', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'served', 'pesky', 'distractions', 'otherwise', 'superb', 'film', 'Dr.', 'Penleric', 'launched', 'mountain', 'journey', 'when', 'unfairly', 'denied', 'promotion', 'full', 'professor', 'world', '1907', 'woman', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'kind', 'professor', 'prestigious', 'university', 'anachronism', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'second', 'anachronism', 'secret', 'lesbian', 'affair', 'Lily', 'sister', 'Eleanor', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'have', 'doubt', 'such', 'relationships', 'happened', '1907', 'Eleanor', 'easy', 'guilt', 'free', 'attitude', 'more', 'common', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'rings', 'false', 'moralizing', 'Edwardian', 'age', 'first', 'decade', '20th', 'century', 'cases', 'anachronisms', 'are', 'crucial', 'moving', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'ignored.Despite', 'problems', 'story', 'still', 'excellent', 'film', 'expertly', 'unique', 'mountain', 'culture', 'as', 'well', 'offering', 'visual', 'auditory', 'feast', 'senses', 'Fans', 'old', 'time', 'Appalachian', 'music', 'should', 'consider', 'Songcatcher', 'mandatory', 'viewing', 'even', 'particular', 'interest', 'subject', 'may', 'find', 'swept', 'up', 'magic', 'songs.Theo', 'Logos']",Songcatcher

I love the characters and the music, which is the real star of this movie.  The story is very basic. There are oddities, such as the main woman character who is a PhD in music and teaches at a college in the early 1900s and then all of the &#34;mountain people&#34;.  Because I have always lived in Missouri with the Ozark Mountains and the stories in literature about these people, I am also fascinated with stories about the Appalachian Mountains and people. If for no other reason, you should see this movie for Pat Carroll's character. If you don't remember her, she was in many TV shows back in the 60s and 70s, including the movie &#34;Cinderella&#34; with Leslie Ann Warren as the title character. Pat was one of the stepsisters. She sings a really funny song called &#34;Single Girl&#34; to a woman who just had a baby and had a wandering husband. Great characters, beautiful setting, and wonderful music.

671269,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005O0SO,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 7]","&quot;Songcatcher&quot; is a good example of watching a talented newcomer showing her promising career before her.  I meam Emmy Rossum, whose angelic voice would captivate your heart.  And just like her voice, the film's greatest virtue lies in its music, around which the story revolves.It's in 1907, America.  Lily Penleric, an associate-professor of music, decides to leave the academic institute, whose donnish scholars deny her any chance of due recognition.  Now she is with her sisiter, deep in the Appalachian mountains, where she accidentally finds that old ballads are miraculously preserved among the people living there.  Lily starts to collect the songs on the wax cylinders, but as you see, as Lily herself soon does, that she might be exploiting the unsuspecting people under the name of academic research.The writer/director Maggie Greenwald shows tendency towards feminism message, which thankfully does not play the main role in most of the part.  In fact, the characters including Aidan Quinn or veteran Pat Carroll (known for the voice of Ursula in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;) lack the steady and credible development, and the love themes of the film fail to interest us.  The story which involves even lesbianism is often too meldramatic to take seriously, with such familiar elements as arson and sudden gunshot.But the film's music will compensate all.  The ballads, or type of folk songs, are irresistible, moving our heart with its simple lyrics and enthralling melody.  When the music starts, the film also starts to soar, and the film has been given many occasions for these songs to be played by real talents, which include, beside Emmy Rossum. Iris Dument or Hazel Dickens.  Plus you see a brief cameo of Taj Mahal.Watch, or listen to this film for its music.
