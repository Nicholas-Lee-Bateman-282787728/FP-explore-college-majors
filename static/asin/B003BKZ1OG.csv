Yes the film has female nudity (not to mention feminist ideology) as well as political explicitness, but Neshat never exploits her liberties. The film is powerful without being strident and often of very striking visual beauty. At a very few moments the beauty is perhaps a little  too self-conscious and the symbolism a little too--well, symbolic.

Whether as first request of female pilgrim to no-mans-land sanctuary (a drink of water) or sacred and isolated grotto, this pristine fluid proffered solace for healing the feminine from male abuse.Slaking thirst, purifying, submerging, containing, nurturing, perhaps water's role since the beginning of time -- even in the cultural stories we tell ourselves. (For example, remembering Mary Magdalene's washing the feet of Jesus)And may explain why women almost universally will chose a bathtub over a shower - when given the option.The images and cinematography within ""Woman without Men"" -- by two talented and courageous Iranian women -- spring from and speak to (my) intuition, so ineffable. Best let them talk to yours -- rather than attempt to pin down the numinous with words.I highly recommend this topical film for both men and women, as we currently ratchet up our demonizing of Iran -- and justifications for disasterous sanctions (and perhaps war) -- against this hoary, precious poetic culture~",5,Women with water~,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,1133,"['remarkable', 'film', 'exquisite', 'natural', 'dioramas', 'subliminally', 'focused', 'star', 'turn', 'Water', 'Whether', 'first', 'request', 'female', 'pilgrim', 'no-mans-land', 'sanctuary', 'drink', 'water', 'sacred', 'isolated', 'grotto', 'pristine', 'fluid', 'proffered', 'solace', 'healing', 'feminine', 'male', 'abuse.Slaking', 'thirst', 'purifying', 'submerging', 'containing', 'nurturing', 'perhaps', 'water', 'role', 'beginning', 'time', 'even', 'cultural', 'stories', 'tell', 'example', 'remembering', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'washing', 'feet', 'Jesus', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'women', 'almost', 'universally', 'will', 'chose', 'bathtub', 'shower', 'when', 'given', 'option.The', 'images', 'cinematography', 'Woman', 'Men', 'two', 'talented', 'courageous', 'Iranian', 'women', 'spring', 'speak', 'intuition', 'so', 'ineffable', 'Best', 'let', 'talk', 'yours', 'rather', 'attempt', 'pin', 'down', 'numinous', 'words.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'topical', 'film', 'men', 'women', 'currently', 'ratchet', 'up', 'demonizing', 'Iran', 'justifications', 'disasterous', 'sanctions', 'perhaps', 'war', 'hoary', 'precious', 'poetic', 'culture~']",N/A

1335840,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B003BKZ1OG,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[10, 10]","Exiled Iranian visual artist and now filmmaker, Shirin Neshat interprets the 1989 novella ""Women Without Men"" by Shahrnush Parsipur, also an Iranian exile. Both women have attempted movingly to portray the oppression of women in Iran. Set in 1953 during the CIA-backed overthrow of the democratically elected government, led by Mohammed Mossadegh, the film also has a political message. It is dedicated to Iranians whose lives have been lost in struggles for independence there since the turn of the last century.The women of the title are all abused and betrayed in some way by men. Middle-class and middle-aged Zinat is trapped in a stultifying marriage to an Army officer, who berates her for her creative talents (she is a poet and singer) and threatens to take a second, younger wife. Thirty-year-old Munis is absorbed by current political events but is brow-beaten by a brother who wants her married off as soon as possible. Meanwhile, her friend Faezeh has the misfortune of being found alone in the streets by two men who rape her. Zarin, a shudderingly anorexic young prostitute, barely tolerates her male customers, who treat her brutally, but recoils in horror when she discovers that one of them lacks a face. Zinat leaves her husband and acquires a rural property - a huge old house with extensive gardens where two of the other women join her in retreat from the rest of the world. A kindly gardener attends to them, but otherwise it is their world without men.The tone of Parsipur's novella is darkly humorous and finally hopeful, but the film is more elegiac. It parts company with the novel as public protests in the streets mount, calling to mind demonstrations we have seen in 1979 and again in 2009. Munis, escaping from her home, by means of an episode of magical realism (also a recurring device in the novella), joins a cell of young leftists. But the triumph of the military and the collapse of the government as invited guests gather for an evening at the house, dictate the narrative outcomes for the characters. The resolution of the film reflects the erosion of hope for Iranian women in the 20 years since the book was written. This is a gracefully told and beautifully photographed film. Location footage, the use of muted colors, and the haunting music track make it a richly moving experience.",5,What if . . .,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,2325,"['Exiled', 'Iranian', 'visual', 'artist', 'now', 'filmmaker', 'Shirin', 'Neshat', '1989', 'novella', 'Women', 'Men', 'Shahrnush', 'Parsipur', 'also', 'Iranian', 'exile', 'women', 'have', 'attempted', 'movingly', 'portray', 'oppression', 'women', 'Iran', 'Set', '1953', 'CIA-backed', 'overthrow', 'democratically', 'elected', 'government', 'led', 'Mohammed', 'Mossadegh', 'film', 'also', 'political', 'message', 'dedicated', 'Iranians', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'struggles', 'independence', 'turn', 'last', 'century.The', 'women', 'title', 'are', 'abused', 'betrayed', 'way', 'men', 'Middle-class', 'middle-aged', 'Zinat', 'trapped', 'stultifying', 'marriage', 'Army', 'officer', 'who', 'creative', 'talents', 'poet', 'singer', 'take', 'second', 'younger', 'wife', 'Thirty-year-old', 'Munis', 'absorbed', 'current', 'political', 'events', 'brow-beaten', 'brother', 'who', 'married', 'off', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Meanwhile', 'friend', 'Faezeh', 'misfortune', 'being', 'found', 'alone', 'streets', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'rape', 'Zarin', 'shudderingly', 'anorexic', 'young', 'prostitute', 'barely', 'male', 'customers', 'who', 'treat', 'brutally', 'recoils', 'horror', 'when', 'one', 'face', 'Zinat', 'husband', 'rural', 'property', 'huge', 'old', 'house', 'extensive', 'gardens', 'where', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'join', 'retreat', 'rest', 'world', 'kindly', 'gardener', 'attends', 'world', 'men.The', 'tone', 'Parsipur', 'novella', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'finally', 'hopeful', 'film', 'more', 'elegiac', 'parts', 'company', 'novel', 'public', 'protests', 'streets', 'mount', 'calling', 'mind', 'demonstrations', 'have', 'seen', '1979', 'again', '2009', 'Munis', 'escaping', 'home', 'means', 'episode', 'magical', 'realism', 'also', 'recurring', 'device', 'novella', 'cell', 'young', 'leftists', 'triumph', 'military', 'collapse', 'government', 'invited', 'guests', 'gather', 'evening', 'house', 'dictate', 'narrative', 'outcomes', 'characters', 'resolution', 'film', 'erosion', 'hope', 'Iranian', 'women', '20', 'years', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'gracefully', 'told', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'film', 'Location', 'footage', 'use', 'muted', 'colors', 'haunting', 'music', 'track', 'make', 'richly', 'moving', 'experience']",N/A
