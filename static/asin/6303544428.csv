It's past my bedtime so I will keep this as short as I know how.I cried through parts as it was so unfair for such a cultured girl to be caught in the web of an old liar, who was no hero in the war but a young thirteen-year-old who survived his best friend and felt guilty for the boy's death.  He lured the heart-broken teenager into his web of deceit when she was most vulnerable.  Like me, she wanted out before it began but, unlike me, she endured and suffered more as a consequence.We make some bad choices in our lives and must sleep in the bed which we made.  It is never easy to declare defeat but, in her day, it was an impossibility.  It was a miracle she survived so much and lived all those years with her guilt.  Something similar happened in my family, but he lasted only a couple of years because of cancer.  It was kept from me, like most of the things we really need to know.  I have been to very few funerals, because someone else makes the decision not to let me know.This lady survived all of her children, and when the celebration for her honor approaches, almost the same as her husband was given, she relives his war terror and hardships and their combative, but loving family life through flashbacks.  This is where I cried, and I guess my eyes will still be red tomorrow.Diane Lane was marvelous as the young wife and Anne Bancroft spectacular as the celebrant who was confined to a wheel chair and living in a nursing home.  It's tragic what age does to us, even when we are still the young person inside.  She was intelligent enough to make friends with a pessimistic physics professor and they learned a thing or two from each other.It was fantastic to watch Cicely Tyson age as the family servant no one could live without, and the acting ability it took to change so much.  Her character was one of the best, even though it is hard to understand.I loved the war scenes with the Confederate flag. A few months ago, I was invited to join the Daughters of the Confederacy but declined as I figured I was the only rebel in my family.  Actually, I was not ready to look too closely into my father's side of the family.  Living in Sevier County during that time, I doubt that they were on the side I favor, and it might hurt more to know that than to pay so much to be an associate member.  To me, at this time, I have better things to do with my money and time.  Maybe I'll go on a cruise.",4,A Dynamic Duo In Love & War.,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,2586,"['When', 'decided', 'watch', 'long', 'movie', 'attention', 'was', 'caught', 'right', 'away', 'Civil', 'War', 'part', 'yet', 'what', 'kept', 'awake', 'was', 'domestic', 'war', 'victor', 'past', 'bedtime', 'will', 'keep', 'as', 'short', 'know', 'how.I', 'cried', 'parts', 'was', 'so', 'unfair', 'such', 'cultured', 'girl', 'be', 'caught', 'web', 'old', 'liar', 'who', 'was', 'hero', 'war', 'young', 'thirteen-year-old', 'who', 'survived', 'best', 'friend', 'felt', 'guilty', 'boy', 'death', 'lured', 'heart-broken', 'teenager', 'web', 'deceit', 'when', 'was', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'wanted', 'out', 'began', 'endured', 'suffered', 'more', 'consequence.We', 'make', 'bad', 'choices', 'lives', 'must', 'sleep', 'bed', 'made', 'never', 'easy', 'declare', 'defeat', 'day', 'was', 'impossibility', 'was', 'miracle', 'survived', 'so', 'much', 'lived', 'years', 'guilt', 'Something', 'similar', 'happened', 'family', 'lasted', 'only', 'couple', 'years', 'cancer', 'was', 'kept', 'most', 'things', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'few', 'funerals', 'someone', 'else', 'decision', 'not', 'let', 'know.This', 'lady', 'survived', 'children', 'when', 'celebration', 'honor', 'approaches', 'almost', 'same', 'husband', 'was', 'given', 'war', 'terror', 'hardships', 'combative', 'loving', 'family', 'life', 'flashbacks', 'where', 'cried', 'guess', 'eyes', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'red', 'tomorrow.Diane', 'Lane', 'was', 'marvelous', 'young', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'spectacular', 'celebrant', 'who', 'was', 'confined', 'wheel', 'chair', 'living', 'nursing', 'home', 'tragic', 'what', 'age', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'still', 'young', 'person', 'was', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'make', 'friends', 'pessimistic', 'physics', 'professor', 'learned', 'thing', 'two', 'other.It', 'was', 'fantastic', 'watch', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'age', 'family', 'servant', 'one', 'could', 'live', 'acting', 'ability', 'took', 'change', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'even', 'hard', 'understand.I', 'loved', 'war', 'scenes', 'Confederate', 'flag', 'few', 'months', 'was', 'invited', 'join', 'Daughters', 'Confederacy', 'declined', 'figured', 'was', 'only', 'rebel', 'family', 'Actually', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'look', 'too', 'closely', 'father', 'side', 'family', 'Living', 'Sevier', 'County', 'time', 'doubt', 'were', 'side', 'favor', 'might', 'hurt', 'more', 'know', 'pay', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'associate', 'member', 'time', 'have', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'money', 'time', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'go', 'cruise']",Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All VHS

379448,A26D5IRV2OLU4B,6303544428,D. Munro,"[9, 9]","I saw this movie years ago, when it first appeared as a TV movie.  It amazed me then, and it amazes me now.  There are so many great parts in this movie, so many poignant moments.  And what a cast -- Diane Lane as Lucy Marsden and Donald Sutherland as ""Captain"" Willie Marsden, who she calls only ""Cap'n.""The story is told through flashbacks as an elderly Lucy reflects upon  her life as she now lives at a retirement facility.  She remembers back to her childhood, starting with the year 1899 when she was 15 years old.  A school assignment takes her to the Marsden home, where she is to interview Mrs. Marsden (Willie's mother) about Civil War life.  During this visit, she runs into the family's maid, Castalia (Cicely Tyson) a freed slave who chose to remain with the family as a servant, and a 50-year-old Captain Marsden, who's been a good friend to Lucy's family.  Captain Marsden courts Lucy (who's always been more of a tomboy than a young Southern lady, to her mother's constant frustration) and proposes to her.  As is the way during that time, age isn't a factor and her parents approve the match.Sutherland does an excellent job as William Marsden, a man who has never forgotten just what the Civil War has cost him ... and how it's changed him.  He was a young soldier at 13, given a uniform in the South's desperation to get as many men onto the field as possible.  At 13, he watched men die around him, endured terror in a field hospital, and lost his best friend,Ned, another young boy, in battle.  He carries the Civil War with him daily.One thing I like about this movie is the chemistry between Lane and Sutherland.  It is easy to see that Lucy and Captain Marsden DO love each other and have a mostly happy marriage, with a house full of children ... the boys named by Cap'n Marsden after comrades he'd known and lost during various battles.  Both are stubborn people, and they have many battles of will ... but they do love each other.  The Captain relies upon his wife to help him forget the war, and Lucy tries ... but as PTSD wasn't diagnosed back then, she is powerless.  After a hunting accident injurs her oldest child and yellow fever claims her youngest, Lucy struggles to maintain her own equilibrium.  At one point, she leaves her home but encounters a childhood friend (who actually betrayed her back then) who lost her family by running away ... and finally returns home with a new sense of where she belongs.This is a great drama with fascinating insight about just what those boys who returned home from the nation's most bloody war may have felt ... the demons that chased them into their adult lives, and how those demons affected their own families.  It also shows how strong Lucy was for putting up with those demons he brought in, and enduring her own.",5,"An Amazing Movie, With Talented Actors!",1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,2793,"['saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'TV', 'movie', 'amazed', 'then', 'now', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'parts', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'poignant', 'moments', 'what', 'cast', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Lucy', 'Marsden', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Captain', 'Willie', 'Marsden', 'who', 'only', 'Cap', 'n', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'elderly', 'Lucy', 'life', 'now', 'retirement', 'facility', 'back', 'childhood', 'starting', 'year', '1899', 'when', 'was', '15', 'years', 'old', 'school', 'assignment', 'Marsden', 'home', 'where', 'interview', 'Mrs.', 'Marsden', 'Willie', 'mother', 'Civil', 'War', 'life', 'visit', 'family', 'maid', 'Castalia', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'freed', 'slave', 'who', 'chose', 'remain', 'family', 'servant', '50-year-old', 'Captain', 'Marsden', 'who', 'been', 'good', 'friend', 'Lucy', 'family', 'Captain', 'Marsden', 'courts', 'Lucy', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'more', 'tomboy', 'young', 'Southern', 'lady', 'mother', 'constant', 'frustration', 'way', 'time', 'age', ""n't"", 'factor', 'parents', 'approve', 'match.Sutherland', 'excellent', 'job', 'William', 'Marsden', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'forgotten', 'just', 'what', 'Civil', 'War', 'cost', 'how', 'changed', 'was', 'young', 'soldier', '13', 'given', 'uniform', 'South', 'desperation', 'get', 'many', 'men', 'field', 'possible', '13', 'watched', 'men', 'die', 'endured', 'terror', 'field', 'hospital', 'lost', 'best', 'friend', 'Ned', 'young', 'boy', 'battle', 'Civil', 'War', 'daily.One', 'thing', 'like', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'Lane', 'Sutherland', 'easy', 'see', 'Lucy', 'Captain', 'Marsden', 'DO', 'love', 'other', 'have', 'mostly', 'happy', 'marriage', 'house', 'full', 'children', 'boys', 'named', 'Cap', 'n', 'Marsden', 'comrades', ""'d"", 'known', 'lost', 'various', 'battles', 'are', 'stubborn', 'people', 'have', 'many', 'battles', 'will', 'do', 'love', 'other', 'Captain', 'relies', 'wife', 'help', 'forget', 'war', 'Lucy', 'tries', 'PTSD', 'was', ""n't"", 'diagnosed', 'back', 'then', 'powerless', 'hunting', 'accident', 'oldest', 'child', 'yellow', 'fever', 'youngest', 'Lucy', 'maintain', 'own', 'equilibrium', 'one', 'point', 'home', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'actually', 'betrayed', 'back', 'then', 'who', 'lost', 'family', 'running', 'away', 'finally', 'home', 'new', 'sense', 'where', 'great', 'drama', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'about', 'just', 'what', 'boys', 'who', 'returned', 'home', 'nation', 'most', 'bloody', 'war', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'demons', 'chased', 'adult', 'lives', 'how', 'demons', 'affected', 'own', 'families', 'also', 'how', 'strong', 'Lucy', 'was', 'putting', 'up', 'demons', 'brought', 'enduring', 'own']",Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All VHS

And perhaps that's why I love this movie so much. It opens at the beginning of the 20th Century, the early 1900s. As someone who's written a couple architecture books about this period of time, I'm happy to say that the historical aspects of the movie all looked good, so I was able to just relax and enjoy the flick.We all think that the early 1900s were a simpler time and place but this movie presents a more honest view of history, particularly as it relates to women's issues. One of the minor plot lines presents the story of a woman who has lost her children forever because she sought a divorce. Another poignant scene is where Lucy (lead character) gives up on life after a tragedy in the family.Laying in bed, she chews on crayons and tells her husband (Donald Southerland) that she's only ""fuzz on a pillow."" (BTW, crayons in those days contained lead, giving them a taste not unlike sweet tarts and said to be highly addictive. That's what I loved about this movie; it got the details right.)I've watched this movie about 20 times and even though I've memorized many of the lines, I still cry and laugh and feel touched, stirred and inspired. I love the acting, the setting, the story, the beauty, the love affair between the old ""Cap'n"" and his beautiful young wife.
