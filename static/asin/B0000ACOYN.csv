762339,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B0000ACOYN,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[2, 2]","I had mixed feelings about this mid-seventies offering from the BBC. Indeed, several times during viewing I promised myself that I would stop watching the series, but there is something sneakily compelling about this adaptation based on the novel by Bates that kept me ordering discs and watching episodes.Lydia is an aristocratic orphan born of a fling between her wealthy father and a woman no better than she should be in the parlance of the times. Once her father dies, Lydia comes to live at the hall with her maiden aunts and bachelor uncle. She is beautiful and mercurial and lonely and the aunts arrange for Richardson, a respectable middle-class newspaper reporter to take her skating to introduce her to the community. Richardson falls hard for the lovely, seemingly heartless Lydia who returns his love for a time. Lydia is folded into Richardson's social circle consisting of the madcap Alex, earnest Tom and Nancy, farming siblings and Blackie, the working class driver who takes them around the social whirl. All of the men are drawn to Lydia and she alternately returns their attention and plays them off one another.Several tragedies come to pass because of the shifting love and alliances between Lydia and this group of people, including poverty, illness and death. Other reviewers have complained that the series moves sloowly and they aren't wrong, especially when compared to the jump cuts of modern cinematography and this was one of the reasons I considered ditching the series. The strength of the series is in the character studies. These are real people, you have met them and their flaws and virtues and the actions they take because of them are capable of being viewed from many perspectives. Lydia can be viewed as a heartless seductress and flirt whose manipulations lead to death, or she can be viewed as the lonely orphan born on the wrong side of the sheets who is devastatingly lonely and uses the power of her beauty to get the love and attention she so desperately craves without realizing the consequences. Richardson is the upright, hapless lover who loves Lydia with the purity of first love or he is a selfish, priggish, jealous man who sulks whenever things don't go his way. In both cases, both interpretations are true. These are real people and the viewer dislikes them in much the same way that he or she dislikes real people.Some of the plot points, when they come seem a bit overblown, but add to the character study and the sense of tragedy, though Bates stops short of giving the full tragedy, or perhaps he doesn't, that too is left to the interpretation of the viewer. A solid, interesting series from Masterpiece recommended for diehard anglophiles and fans of British period drama. 3.5 stars.",4,Realism Grows to Stunning Character Study,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,2745,"['had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'mid-seventies', 'offering', 'BBC', 'Indeed', 'several', 'times', 'viewing', 'promised', 'would', 'stop', 'watching', 'series', 'something', 'sneakily', 'compelling', 'adaptation', 'based', 'novel', 'Bates', 'kept', 'ordering', 'discs', 'watching', 'episodes.Lydia', 'aristocratic', 'orphan', 'born', 'fling', 'wealthy', 'father', 'woman', 'no', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'parlance', 'times', 'father', 'dies', 'Lydia', 'live', 'hall', 'maiden', 'aunts', 'bachelor', 'uncle', 'beautiful', 'mercurial', 'lonely', 'aunts', 'arrange', 'Richardson', 'respectable', 'middle-class', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'take', 'skating', 'introduce', 'community', 'Richardson', 'hard', 'lovely', 'seemingly', 'heartless', 'Lydia', 'who', 'love', 'time', 'Lydia', 'folded', 'Richardson', 'social', 'circle', 'consisting', 'madcap', 'Alex', 'earnest', 'Tom', 'Nancy', 'farming', 'siblings', 'Blackie', 'working', 'class', 'driver', 'who', 'social', 'whirl', 'men', 'are', 'drawn', 'Lydia', 'alternately', 'returns', 'attention', 'off', 'one', 'another.Several', 'tragedies', 'come', 'pass', 'shifting', 'love', 'alliances', 'Lydia', 'group', 'people', 'including', 'poverty', 'illness', 'death', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'series', 'sloowly', 'are', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'jump', 'cuts', 'modern', 'cinematography', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'considered', 'ditching', 'series', 'strength', 'series', 'character', 'studies', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'met', 'flaws', 'virtues', 'actions', 'take', 'are', 'capable', 'being', 'viewed', 'many', 'perspectives', 'Lydia', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'heartless', 'seductress', 'flirt', 'manipulations', 'lead', 'death', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'lonely', 'orphan', 'born', 'wrong', 'side', 'sheets', 'who', 'devastatingly', 'lonely', 'power', 'beauty', 'get', 'love', 'attention', 'so', 'desperately', 'realizing', 'consequences', 'Richardson', 'upright', 'hapless', 'lover', 'who', 'Lydia', 'purity', 'first', 'love', 'selfish', 'priggish', 'jealous', 'man', 'who', 'whenever', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'cases', 'interpretations', 'are', 'true', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'viewer', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'real', 'people.Some', 'plot', 'points', 'when', 'come', 'seem', 'bit', 'overblown', 'add', 'character', 'study', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'Bates', 'stops', 'short', 'giving', 'full', 'tragedy', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'too', 'left', 'interpretation', 'viewer', 'solid', 'interesting', 'series', 'Masterpiece', 'recommended', 'diehard', 'anglophiles', 'fans', 'British', 'period', 'drama', '3.5', 'stars']",Love for Lydia

762341,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0000ACOYN,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","One of the great miniseries from the golden years of London Weekend Television, LOVE FOR LYDIA is based on the bittersweet, autobiographical novel by H.E. Bates (""The Darling Buds of May"") and follows the lives of several young adults during the 1920's, a period of great social flux.In the small village of Evensford, Edward Richardson (Christopher Blake) works as a cadet reporter for the local newspaper.  When Richardson is asked to cover a story about the recent arrival of heiress Lydia Aspen (Mel Martin), he finds himself captivated by the young girl, who seems as shy and insecure as he is.  Invited by Lydia's relations to act as her guide into local society, Richardson is in for a rude shock.  Looks are deceiving - Lydia is far from a wallflower and enjoys toying with an ever-growing collection of male admirers.Scripted by Julian Bond (with great fidelity to the book) and running for thirteen 50-minute episodes, LOVE FOR LYDIA was perhaps LWT's most ambitious undertaking and shows a surprising depth of maturity which wasn't otherwise possible for most miniseries of the era (including a rather intimate love scene).  It's actually more of a ""mood"" piece if anything and moves at a relaxed pace, allowing viewers to fully envelope themselves into the world of Lydia, Richardson and the rest of the characters.The miniseries provided an effective showcase for many of it's young stars, most notably Jeremy Irons (four years before his breakout success withBrideshead Revisited) and Peter Davison (a futureDoctor Who) playing two of Lydia's would-be suitors.  Christopher Blake was a period drama favourite, having already played Gilbert Blythe in the BBC's set of ""Anne of Green Gables"" andAnne of Avonleaminiseries in 1973 and 1975 respectively.  Dazzling Mel Martin had earlier appeared inThe Pallisersalong with Irons.  LOVE FOR LYDIA also provided some delightful autumnal turns for esteemed actresses Beatrix Lehmann (The Portrait of a Lady) and Rachel Kempson as Lydia's ill-equipped but essentially well-meaning aunts Bertie and Juliana, and Michael Aldridge as wastrel Uncle Rollo.",4,"plenty of love for this ""Lydia""",1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,2106,"['One', 'great', 'miniseries', 'golden', 'years', 'London', 'Weekend', 'Television', 'LOVE', 'FOR', 'LYDIA', 'based', 'bittersweet', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'H.E', 'Bates', 'Darling', 'Buds', 'May', 'lives', 'several', 'young', 'adults', '1920', 'period', 'great', 'social', 'flux.In', 'small', 'village', 'Evensford', 'Edward', 'Richardson', 'Christopher', 'Blake', 'cadet', 'reporter', 'local', 'newspaper', 'When', 'Richardson', 'asked', 'cover', 'story', 'recent', 'arrival', 'heiress', 'Lydia', 'Aspen', 'Mel', 'Martin', 'captivated', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'shy', 'insecure', 'Invited', 'Lydia', 'relations', 'act', 'guide', 'local', 'society', 'Richardson', 'rude', 'shock', 'Looks', 'are', 'deceiving', 'Lydia', 'far', 'wallflower', 'toying', 'ever-growing', 'collection', 'male', 'admirers.Scripted', 'Julian', 'Bond', 'great', 'fidelity', 'book', 'running', 'thirteen', '50-minute', 'episodes', 'LOVE', 'FOR', 'LYDIA', 'was', 'perhaps', 'LWT', 'most', 'ambitious', 'undertaking', 'surprising', 'depth', 'maturity', 'was', ""n't"", 'otherwise', 'possible', 'most', 'miniseries', 'era', 'including', 'rather', 'intimate', 'love', 'scene', 'actually', 'more', 'mood', 'piece', 'anything', 'moves', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'allowing', 'viewers', 'fully', 'envelope', 'world', 'Lydia', 'Richardson', 'rest', 'characters.The', 'miniseries', 'provided', 'effective', 'showcase', 'many', 'young', 'stars', 'most', 'notably', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'four', 'years', 'breakout', 'success', 'withBrideshead', 'Revisited', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'futureDoctor', 'Who', 'playing', 'two', 'Lydia', 'would-be', 'suitors', 'Christopher', 'Blake', 'was', 'period', 'drama', 'favourite', 'having', 'already', 'played', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'BBC', 'set', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'andAnne', 'Avonleaminiseries', '1973', '1975', 'respectively', 'Dazzling', 'Mel', 'Martin', 'had', 'earlier', 'appeared', 'inThe', 'Pallisersalong', 'Irons', 'LOVE', 'FOR', 'LYDIA', 'also', 'provided', 'delightful', 'autumnal', 'turns', 'esteemed', 'actresses', 'Beatrix', 'Lehmann', 'Portrait', 'Lady', 'Rachel', 'Kempson', 'Lydia', 'ill-equipped', 'essentially', 'well-meaning', 'aunts', 'Bertie', 'Juliana', 'Michael', 'Aldridge', 'wastrel', 'Uncle', 'Rollo']",Love for Lydia

Bates (Darling Buds of May, My Uncle Silas) is 650 minutes of one of the best BBC/Masterpiece Theater presentations I've seen. The quality of the DVD transfer is B- but the story is so compelling, the photography so beautiful,  and life in rural England in the late 1920's and early 1930's is so lovingly depicted that you will probably not care.LYDIA is a love story, but it is also a complex psychological drama with fabulous character development. The six main characters and several secondary characters (played by stellar actors) exhibit all the strengths and weaknesses known to humans-especially envy and jealousy and undying friendship. The plot is deceptively simple - boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl. However, you won't know the outcome until the last five minutes of the DVD as several boys meet several girls and everything is in a muddle most of the time. ""You will be difficult"" Lydia says to Richardson on more than one occasion-an understatement of the facts.The protagonist Edward Richardson (Christopher Blake), called Richardson by his friend Tom (Peter Davidson) and best pal Alex Sanderson (Jeremy Irons)  becomes a mature man and a published writer by the end of the tale. Lydia Aspen (Mel Martin)-the object of Richardson's affection-has been characterized as a ""charming young girl"" and a ""self-centered flapper"" in some of the `blurbs' advertising the DVD, but Lydia is far more complex than either of these labels indicates. Lydia is a privileged young woman to be sure (heiress to the manor born) but she exhibits concern and caring for others on many occasions.  During the course of the tale she changes from a shy teenager into a mature young woman. At one point following a devastating death she ""parties"" far too much for her own good, but this period receives very little screen time (the repercussions of her drinking receive more time).Let me put it this way, if you are a Jane Austin fan and love all the twists and turns and near misses of Austin's lovers and think premarital sex is okay (tastefully done by the BBC of course) you will probably be a fan of LYDIA.",5,True love....,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,2148,"['LOVE', 'FOR', 'LYDIA', 'written', 'H.E', 'Bates', 'Darling', 'Buds', 'May', 'My', 'Uncle', 'Silas', '650', 'minutes', 'one', 'best', 'BBC/Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'presentations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'B-', 'story', 'so', 'compelling', 'photography', 'so', 'beautiful', 'life', 'rural', 'England', 'late', '1920', 'early', '1930', 'so', 'lovingly', 'depicted', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'care.LYDIA', 'love', 'story', 'also', 'complex', 'psychological', 'drama', 'fabulous', 'character', 'development', 'six', 'main', 'characters', 'several', 'secondary', 'characters', 'played', 'stellar', 'actors', 'exhibit', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'known', 'humans-especially', 'envy', 'jealousy', 'undying', 'friendship', 'plot', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'finds', 'girl', 'However', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'outcome', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'several', 'boys', 'meet', 'several', 'girls', 'everything', 'muddle', 'most', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'Lydia', 'Richardson', 'more', 'one', 'occasion-an', 'understatement', 'facts.The', 'protagonist', 'Edward', 'Richardson', 'Christopher', 'Blake', 'called', 'Richardson', 'friend', 'Tom', 'Peter', 'Davidson', 'best', 'pal', 'Alex', 'Sanderson', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'mature', 'man', 'published', 'writer', 'end', 'tale', 'Lydia', 'Aspen', 'Mel', 'Martin', '-the', 'object', 'Richardson', 'affection-has', 'been', 'characterized', 'charming', 'young', 'girl', 'self-centered', 'flapper', 'blurbs', 'advertising', 'DVD', 'Lydia', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'labels', 'Lydia', 'privileged', 'young', 'woman', 'be', 'sure', 'heiress', 'manor', 'born', 'concern', 'caring', 'others', 'many', 'occasions', 'course', 'tale', 'shy', 'teenager', 'mature', 'young', 'woman', 'one', 'point', 'following', 'devastating', 'death', 'parties', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'own', 'good', 'period', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'repercussions', 'drinking', 'receive', 'more', 'time', '.Let', 'put', 'way', 'are', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'fan', 'love', 'twists', 'turns', 'near', 'misses', 'Austin', 'lovers', 'think', 'premarital', 'sex', 'okay', 'tastefully', 'done', 'BBC', 'course', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'fan', 'LYDIA']",Love for Lydia

The development of the characters is so magnificent that we found ourselves discussing the exchanges that take place as Lydia demands that all men she meets cater to her wishes.

Her ways bring up consequences that put an end to the life of one of her suitors and put her own health in jeopardy.If you have teenagers around, this is a great series of episodes to watch and discuss to ensure personal growth and understanding of human nature, choice and the consequences of living life without a care for others.We highly recommend purchasing the set and watching these episodes with your friends if you want the lively discussions that will make this a memorable experience.",5,PBS Masterpiece Theatre Classic,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1178,"['love', 'Lydia', 'story', 'heiress', 'who', 'up', 'aristocratic', 'society', '1920s', '1930s', 'England', 'Lydia', 'beautiful', 'life', 'self-centered', 'personality', 'men', 'fall', 'passionately', 'love', 'simply', 'emotions', 'not', 'caring', 'bit', 'pain', 'suffering', 'others', 'goes.The', 'story', 'filmed', 'exquisite', 'care', 'detail', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'development', 'characters', 'so', 'magnificent', 'found', 'discussing', 'exchanges', 'take', 'place', 'Lydia', 'men', 'cater', 'wishes', 'Lydia', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'egotistical', 'ways', 'bring', 'up', 'consequences', 'put', 'end', 'life', 'one', 'suitors', 'put', 'own', 'health', 'jeopardy.If', 'have', 'teenagers', 'around', 'great', 'series', 'episodes', 'watch', 'discuss', 'ensure', 'personal', 'growth', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'choice', 'consequences', 'living', 'life', 'care', 'others.We', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'set', 'watching', 'episodes', 'friends', 'want', 'lively', 'discussions', 'will', 'make', 'memorable', 'experience']",Love for Lydia

Bates' jazz-age novel, &quot;Love for Lydia.&quot; The title character, played flawlessly by Mel Martin, was an utterly self-centered young girl, who was brought  to live with two aged aunts (Rachel Kempson and Beatrix Lehmann) and their parasitic brother (a great characterization by Michael Aldridge). She wanted only to have men cater to her every whim (&quot;I will hate you if you don't&quot;) and enjoy herself to the fullest.For several evenings, I have been watching the DVD release of this 13-part series, now available from Acorn Media in a boxed set of 4 discs (AMP-8648) with a running time of 650 minutes. So vivid were the characters that my wife and I fell into a disagreement as to how likable several of them were. (I voted that some man would have done her a favor by telling her to get stuffed--as one of them finally does but too politely; my spouse thought she was a very sad character who deserved pity.) Such was the quality of the acting.There is little plot but a good deal of character interaction. A would-be writer Edward Richardson (played by Christopher Blake) is a sullen creature, always misunderstanding motives, is jealously in love with Lydia and cannot see how much he is loved by the farm girl Nancy (Sherrie Hewson, looking very much like Shelley Winters in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;). Her brother Tom (Peter Davison) and Richardson's best friend Alex (Jeremy Irons) are drawn to Lydia, as is the seemingly anti-social but actually terribly shy taxi-driver Blackie (Ralph Arliss). Her enjoyment of being vied for leads to the death of one of them, possibly another by indirection, and her own bout with near death towards the end.Mel Martin was quoted as saying, &quot;She was an innocent, untutored in the ways of the world [and] behaved instinctively.&quot; I have yet to read the book to see how closely it follows the novel, but the scriptwriter, Julian Bond, pointed out that given 13 episodes, he had 50 minutes to devote to every 17 pages of the original. (In the Penguin paperback, the novel runs 301 pages, making that 23 pages per episode.) So there is lots of time for lingering on the English countryside, the 1920s dresses, the dances and music, and most of all the complex characters.Grab this one as soon as you can and hold &quot;Lydia&quot; parties to see and discuss it all with your friends.",5,Slowly developing but worth the watching,1062374400,"09 1, 2003",2003,2472,"['September', '23', 'December', '9', '1979', 'watchers', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'were', 'excited', 'dramatization', 'H.E', 'Bates', 'jazz-age', 'novel', 'quot', 'Love', 'Lydia.', 'quot', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'Mel', 'Martin', 'was', 'utterly', 'self-centered', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'live', 'two', 'aged', 'aunts', 'Rachel', 'Kempson', 'Beatrix', 'Lehmann', 'parasitic', 'brother', 'great', 'characterization', 'Michael', 'Aldridge', 'wanted', 'only', 'have', 'men', 'cater', 'whim', 'quot', 'will', 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'quot', 'enjoy', 'fullest.For', 'several', 'evenings', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'DVD', 'release', '13-part', 'series', 'now', 'available', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'boxed', 'set', '4', 'discs', 'AMP-8648', 'running', 'time', '650', 'minutes', 'So', 'vivid', 'were', 'characters', 'wife', 'fell', 'disagreement', 'how', 'likable', 'several', 'were', 'voted', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'favor', 'telling', 'get', 'stuffed', 'one', 'finally', 'too', 'politely', 'spouse', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'character', 'who', 'deserved', 'pity', 'Such', 'was', 'quality', 'little', 'plot', 'good', 'deal', 'character', 'interaction', 'would-be', 'writer', 'Edward', 'Richardson', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Blake', 'sullen', 'creature', 'always', 'misunderstanding', 'motives', 'jealously', 'love', 'Lydia', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'farm', 'girl', 'Nancy', 'Sherrie', 'Hewson', 'looking', 'very', 'much', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'quot', 'Place', 'Sun', 'quot', 'brother', 'Tom', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'Richardson', 'best', 'friend', 'Alex', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'are', 'drawn', 'Lydia', 'seemingly', 'anti-social', 'actually', 'terribly', 'shy', 'taxi-driver', 'Blackie', 'Ralph', 'Arliss', 'enjoyment', 'being', 'vied', 'leads', 'death', 'one', 'possibly', 'indirection', 'own', 'bout', 'near', 'death', 'end.Mel', 'Martin', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'quot', 'was', 'innocent', 'untutored', 'ways', 'world', '[', ']', 'behaved', 'instinctively.', 'quot', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'how', 'closely', 'novel', 'scriptwriter', 'Julian', 'Bond', 'pointed', 'out', 'given', '13', 'episodes', 'had', '50', 'minutes', 'devote', '17', 'pages', 'original', 'Penguin', 'paperback', 'novel', '301', 'pages', 'making', '23', 'pages', 'episode', 'lots', 'time', 'lingering', 'English', 'countryside', '1920s', 'dresses', 'dances', 'music', 'most', 'complex', 'characters.Grab', 'one', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'hold', 'quot', 'Lydia', 'quot', 'parties', 'see', 'discuss', 'friends']",Love for Lydia
762346,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0000ACOYN,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[2, 2]","This ""Love for Lydia"", book turned film, is done as masterfully as H. E. Bates wrote the novel. Bates was a master at depicting life in the country and this film, all 13 episodes takes one on a pleasant trip through the countryside of England, with occasional jaunts into London.  The scenery is beautiful.H.E. Bates is also well known for ""My Uncle Silas"" and ""The Darling Buds of May"" which also have been converted to video versions. This indeed has become a Masterpiece Theatre classic.Lydia is masterfully played by Mel Martin (""The Pallisers"" & ""Persuasion"") giving such a performance that you can't quite decide if you love her or hate her. She seeks love, not found in her youth, after 2 decades. In the late 1920s, near her 21st birthday, she begins to become interested in men and love.  She struggles with what it is to be and how it is to be shown.  Her wealth seems of little consequence.Young newspaperman, Edward Richardson (Christopher Blake)also a want-to-be writer, helps bashful Lydia, through the insistence of her aunts, get her skates wet and enter society of other young adults. He falls in love with Lydia, but will Lydia respond fully? Must it be unrequited love?  Richardson's friend, Alex (Jeremy Irons also of ""Brideshead Revisited""), rich and always drinking, encourages Edward.  To a point!Other friends join the trio and create a flapper-era dance group racing from one party to the next enjoyable outing. Till their worlds begin to crash, one at a time. In the end, who can survive the life-style and who will find love?  There seems to be a lot of love and lovers to pass around.Is it drama or romance? Is it historical or period?  Perhaps all of the above.  It is an enjoyable 650 minutes done in 13 episodes that will delight any British literature fan as well as those who have come to expect excellence from Masterpiece Theatre.Captioning would have been nice, but is not completely necessary.

762347,A6Z969DHDXPCR,B0000ACOYN,Medusa,"[6, 9]","Be prepared to hate yourself for two reasons:  if you watched all 13 episodes to their completion, there's the first reason.  If you found yourself wishing ill on nearly every character, there's the second.The first disc, 4 entire episodes, moved so sloooowly that it was painful.  It's rare, however, that I give up on a series; I'll watch it to the bitter end and bitter it was indeed.  The excruciatingly long closeups were maddening; I timed one at 15 seconds and counting.  Paired w/the long silences it was just too much.  No, not every second needs to be filled w/dialogue; there are times when silence speaks much more loudly but it felt as though none of the actors could remember their lines so the camera just panned from one to the other in hopes that someone would speak up.The story itself was good although there wasn't a likable character in the bunch, most especially Lydia and Richardson.  She was referred to several times in the series as the one who ""made"" the players turn against each other but, obviously, each already had that in them.  Richardson was just as selfish as Lydia but in a different way; he whined and if that didn't work, he stalked off.  Lydia would say ""I shall hate you if you don't"" do whatever she wanted you to do.  Richardson's best friends, rich playboy Alex and clumsy farmer Tom shamelessly flirted with and later pursued Lydia in full view of Richardson, resulting in the deaths of both.  I couldn't have cared less and found myself wishing that the same eventuality would come to Lydia and Richardson.  So you can imagine the truly unlikability of the characters.Lydia's uncle Rollo, an alcoholic parasite on the family's riches, was the insightful one in spite of it all.  During Lydia's 21st birthday party, a fire broke out in the garage of the local mechanic, Blackie, who later became devoted to Lydia.  When Lydia actually became annoyed about the fire, Rollo commented that it was because all the attention was taken away from her, that people stopped looking at her.  One of the aunts even said something to the effect that the fire was damned inconsiderate of somebody.  This should give you some idea of the self absorbed and narcissistic character of Lydia.  She was disappointed and bored w/life and she was determined to squeeze every last drop of attention from everyone around her, a vampire at its worst.  No one was spared.Obviously, the acting was good enough to evoke such emotion in me and had they picked up the pace and not wasted so much time on closeups and dead silence, I might have rated this series w/more stars even though the ending made me want to tear my hair out. As it is, though, the series was painful to watch and it isn't one that I'll revisit.  Ever.",2,Be prepared to hate yourself,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,2740,"['Be', 'prepared', 'hate', 'two', 'reasons', 'watched', '13', 'episodes', 'completion', 'first', 'reason', 'found', 'wishing', 'ill', 'nearly', 'character', 'second.The', 'first', '4', 'entire', 'episodes', 'moved', 'so', 'sloooowly', 'was', 'painful', 'rare', 'however', 'give', 'up', 'series', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'bitter', 'end', 'bitter', 'was', 'indeed', 'excruciatingly', 'long', 'closeups', 'were', 'maddening', 'timed', 'one', '15', 'seconds', 'counting', 'Paired', 'w/the', 'long', 'silences', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'No', 'not', 'second', 'needs', 'be', 'filled', 'w/dialogue', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'silence', 'speaks', 'much', 'more', 'loudly', 'felt', 'none', 'actors', 'could', 'remember', 'lines', 'camera', 'just', 'panned', 'one', 'other', 'hopes', 'someone', 'would', 'speak', 'up.The', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'likable', 'character', 'bunch', 'most', 'especially', 'Lydia', 'Richardson', 'was', 'referred', 'several', 'times', 'series', 'one', 'who', 'made', 'players', 'turn', 'other', 'obviously', 'already', 'had', 'Richardson', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'selfish', 'Lydia', 'different', 'way', 'whined', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'stalked', 'off', 'Lydia', 'would', 'say', 'shall', 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'wanted', 'do', 'Richardson', 'best', 'friends', 'rich', 'playboy', 'Alex', 'clumsy', 'farmer', 'Tom', 'shamelessly', 'flirted', 'later', 'pursued', 'Lydia', 'full', 'view', 'Richardson', 'resulting', 'deaths', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'found', 'wishing', 'same', 'eventuality', 'would', 'come', 'Lydia', 'Richardson', 'can', 'imagine', 'truly', 'unlikability', 'characters.Lydia', 'uncle', 'Rollo', 'alcoholic', 'parasite', 'family', 'riches', 'was', 'insightful', 'one', 'spite', 'Lydia', '21st', 'birthday', 'party', 'fire', 'broke', 'out', 'garage', 'local', 'mechanic', 'Blackie', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'devoted', 'Lydia', 'When', 'Lydia', 'actually', 'became', 'annoyed', 'fire', 'Rollo', 'commented', 'was', 'attention', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'people', 'stopped', 'looking', 'One', 'aunts', 'even', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'fire', 'was', 'damned', 'inconsiderate', 'somebody', 'should', 'give', 'idea', 'self', 'absorbed', 'narcissistic', 'character', 'Lydia', 'was', 'disappointed', 'bored', 'w/life', 'was', 'determined', 'squeeze', 'last', 'drop', 'attention', 'everyone', 'vampire', 'worst', 'one', 'was', 'spared.Obviously', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'evoke', 'such', 'emotion', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 'pace', 'not', 'wasted', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'closeups', 'dead', 'silence', 'might', 'have', 'rated', 'series', 'w/more', 'stars', 'even', 'ending', 'made', 'want', 'tear', 'hair', 'out', 'though', 'series', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', ""n't"", 'one', ""'ll"", 'revisit', 'Ever']",Love for Lydia

Great acting, story, and scenery will linger in one's mind long after view. The story reminds one a bit of F.Scott Fitzgerald and wife but set in  England.  It must be very common for writers to be attracted to damaged but beautiful young ladies....and early if not the first film for Jeremy Irons who steals every scene he's in. Not a film for those who like it to 'move fast'. It is for one whom enjoys every little morsel, and wants it never to end. Later...... I purchased a used set of this via Amazon. It's in great shape. I was careful to buy the one that plays on a USA DVD player. Watch for correct zone.
