745987,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B00008O38D,Brittany Rose,"[10, 15]","I really, really, really love this show.  IT is so smart and funny, poignantly realistic, yet altogether a fairytale drama that manages to actually make me laugh, a rare feat for TV these days with out resorting to low-brow humor.  I HIGHLY reccommend these dvds to anyone, guy or girl, interested in any sort of genre.  Everyone that I've gotten to watch an episode of has fallen in love with the show, and genuinely laughs or thinks about what each episode has to offer.Quicky recap of the characters and plot: 4 30-something friends deal with being singles in New York.  Carrie Bradshaw is the principle character, who writes a high profile Sex Column in the New York Star.  Known for her love of shoes and questioning of what makes a relationship work or fail.  Miranda Hobbes is the slightly bitter, pessimistic, sarcastic, yet clever and sharp-witted lawyer of the bunch, who often ends up with men that have too-weird quirks for her clean-cut life.  Charlotte York is the innocent dreamer who has grown up with a cookie cutter dream of marriage and kids.  An art gallery owner, she usually ends up getting hurt looking for that perfect man.  Samantha Jones is the sassy, slightly older Public Relations sex goddess, who loves to use men and has done just about everything to do with sex, ""I'm try-sexual, as in, I'll try anything once.""The first season is the shortest of these 4 (although the 5th season was only 8 episodes), and basically introduces you to the four women and their lives.  The storylines aren't quite as interconnected as in later seasons, but you get your first glimpse of the ever-complicated love story between Carrie and Mr.Big, a suave big business man that has a stronghold on Carrie for the rest of the show.The second season starts to experiment with really developing the characters and shaping their lives to mold and rub up against each other.  More hilarious storylines are thought up, but defining moments just start to peek through.  Miranda's great love of the show, Steve, is introduced as the adorable bartender this season.  Carrie stangles herself with Big some more, until he finally (or so you'd think) ends it by moving away, and then getting engaged.  Charlotte and Samantha still are used as characters to prove points.The third seasons is probably my favorite, as its so changeable and breaks one of the big sins of Television: It gets you to hate the hero, Carrie.  Charlotte's quest for a husband leads her to Trey, which is her defining relationship for the show.  Hints that Samantha might be willing to give up her super-single life also appear here and there.  Miranda re-visits things with Steve, and Carrie meets Aidan.  The best thing that could happen to Carrie post-Big, they have a lovely relationship until, well, Big comes back to haunt her, leading to a beautiful 6 episode story arc that really really shows the talent of the producers of the show.Season four is about re-inventing things.  The humor is still there in many ways, but the characters are much more real and understandable.  Carrie and Aidan are back in the spotlight, and she even manages to arrange Platonic happenings with her and Big.  Charlotte gives her marriage a second try with a variety of outcomes throughout the season.  Miranda re-invents her realtionship with Steve, and is forced to change it yet again as the season draws to a close.  Samantha is finally given a ""love"" with Richard Wright, hotel Magnate and Male Equivalent to Samantha.Altogether, this show is amazingly put together and incredibly smart.  You can relate to many of their situations, and the ones yo ucan't, you are able to enjoy and laugh at.  Get these DVD's! (They have some cool special features as well, like seeing the previews for each episode, cast and crew bios, awards, and commentary).",5,The best show of our time...,1056585600,"06 26, 2003",2003,3811,"['really', 'really', 'really', 'love', 'show', 'IT', 'so', 'smart', 'funny', 'poignantly', 'realistic', 'yet', 'altogether', 'fairytale', 'drama', 'actually', 'make', 'rare', 'feat', 'TV', 'days', 'out', 'resorting', 'low-brow', 'humor', 'HIGHLY', 'reccommend', 'dvds', 'anyone', 'guy', 'girl', 'interested', 'sort', 'genre', 'Everyone', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'watch', 'episode', 'fallen', 'love', 'show', 'genuinely', 'what', 'episode', 'offer.Quicky', 'recap', 'characters', 'plot', '4', '30-something', 'friends', 'deal', 'being', 'singles', 'New', 'York', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'principle', 'character', 'who', 'high', 'profile', 'Sex', 'Column', 'New', 'York', 'Star', 'Known', 'love', 'shoes', 'questioning', 'what', 'relationship', 'work', 'fail', 'Miranda', 'Hobbes', 'slightly', 'bitter', 'pessimistic', 'sarcastic', 'yet', 'clever', 'sharp-witted', 'lawyer', 'bunch', 'who', 'often', 'up', 'men', 'have', 'too-weird', 'quirks', 'clean-cut', 'life', 'Charlotte', 'York', 'innocent', 'dreamer', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'dream', 'marriage', 'kids', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'usually', 'up', 'getting', 'hurt', 'looking', 'perfect', 'man', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'sassy', 'slightly', 'older', 'Public', 'Relations', 'sex', 'goddess', 'who', 'use', 'men', 'done', 'just', 'everything', 'do', 'sex', ""'m"", 'try-sexual', ""'ll"", 'try', 'anything', 'once', 'first', 'season', 'shortest', '4', '5th', 'season', 'was', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'basically', 'introduces', 'four', 'women', 'lives', 'storylines', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'interconnected', 'later', 'seasons', 'get', 'first', 'glimpse', 'ever-complicated', 'love', 'story', 'Carrie', 'Mr.Big', 'suave', 'big', 'business', 'man', 'stronghold', 'Carrie', 'rest', 'show.The', 'second', 'season', 'experiment', 'really', 'developing', 'characters', 'shaping', 'lives', 'mold', 'rub', 'up', 'other', 'More', 'hilarious', 'storylines', 'are', 'thought', 'up', 'defining', 'moments', 'just', 'start', 'peek', 'Miranda', 'great', 'love', 'show', 'Steve', 'introduced', 'adorable', 'bartender', 'season', 'Carrie', 'Big', 'more', 'finally', 'so', ""'d"", 'think', 'moving', 'away', 'then', 'getting', 'engaged', 'Charlotte', 'Samantha', 'still', 'are', 'used', 'characters', 'prove', 'points.The', 'third', 'seasons', 'probably', 'favorite', 'changeable', 'one', 'big', 'sins', 'Television', 'hate', 'hero', 'Carrie', 'Charlotte', 'quest', 'husband', 'Trey', 'defining', 'relationship', 'show', 'Hints', 'Samantha', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'super-single', 'life', 'also', 'appear', 'here', 'there', 'Miranda', 're-visits', 'things', 'Steve', 'Carrie', 'meets', 'Aidan', 'best', 'thing', 'could', 'happen', 'Carrie', 'post-Big', 'have', 'lovely', 'relationship', 'well', 'Big', 'back', 'haunt', 'leading', 'beautiful', '6', 'episode', 'story', 'arc', 'really', 'really', 'talent', 'producers', 'show.Season', 'four', 're-inventing', 'things', 'humor', 'still', 'many', 'ways', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'understandable', 'Carrie', 'Aidan', 'are', 'back', 'spotlight', 'even', 'arrange', 'Platonic', 'happenings', 'Big', 'Charlotte', 'marriage', 'second', 'try', 'variety', 'outcomes', 'season', 'Miranda', 'realtionship', 'Steve', 'forced', 'change', 'yet', 'again', 'season', 'close', 'Samantha', 'finally', 'given', 'love', 'Richard', 'Wright', 'hotel', 'Magnate', 'Male', 'Equivalent', 'Samantha.Altogether', 'show', 'amazingly', 'put', 'together', 'incredibly', 'smart', 'can', 'relate', 'many', 'situations', 'ones', 'yo', 'uca', ""n't"", 'are', 'able', 'enjoy', 'laugh', 'Get', 'DVD', 'have', 'cool', 'special', 'features', 'well', 'seeing', 'previews', 'episode', 'cast', 'crew', 'bios', 'awards', 'commentary']",N/A
745988,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00008O38D,"Maine Writer ""David""","[16, 98]","...P>These are women who can think of nothing more important than what they wear, who they screw, and who everyone else happens to be screwing.  And what they buy.  And how much they earn.  These are archetypal shallow men, only transported into the bodies of four worn-around-the-edges bags who are like the women that you might find in bed with you after having pounded too many beers--the ones that you trying slip away from without having them wake up.  Season 4 shows them in a rather advanced state of decay, as well.  There's something circus-like, almost shameful, about the attempt to make these women behave like sexy, attractive people.  They're not.  And since they have already been empty inside, having the outside turn to muck makes them completely irredeemable.While sexual obsession is one thing, you need to have a something more substantial to balance it. These women have nothing. They care about clothes, money, men's body parts, and, yes, orgasm. That's about it. They engage in no meaningful conversations, have no substantial ideas to speak of, and the humor is essentially stereotypical, empty-headed womanizer's view of the world transplanted into female bodies. Now, if this show was a parody of these women's meaningless lives, it would be one thing. That could be very, very funny. Instead, it almost glorifies their empty heads and empty lives...",2,BadTV.,1056153600,"06 21, 2003",2003,1376,"['P', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'more', 'important', 'what', 'wear', 'who', 'screw', 'who', 'everyone', 'else', 'be', 'screwing', 'what', 'buy', 'how', 'much', 'earn', 'are', 'archetypal', 'shallow', 'men', 'only', 'transported', 'bodies', 'four', 'worn-around-the-edges', 'bags', 'who', 'are', 'women', 'might', 'find', 'bed', 'having', 'pounded', 'too', 'many', 'beers', 'ones', 'trying', 'slip', 'away', 'having', 'wake', 'up', 'Season', '4', 'rather', 'advanced', 'state', 'decay', 'as', 'well', 'something', 'circus-like', 'almost', 'shameful', 'attempt', 'make', 'women', 'behave', 'sexy', 'attractive', 'people', ""'re"", 'not', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'empty', 'inside', 'having', 'outside', 'turn', 'muck', 'completely', 'irredeemable.While', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'one', 'thing', 'need', 'have', 'something', 'more', 'substantial', 'balance', 'women', 'have', 'nothing', 'care', 'clothes', 'money', 'men', 'body', 'parts', 'yes', 'orgasm', 'engage', 'meaningful', 'conversations', 'have', 'substantial', 'ideas', 'speak', 'humor', 'essentially', 'stereotypical', 'empty-headed', 'womanizer', 'view', 'world', 'transplanted', 'female', 'bodies', 'Now', 'show', 'was', 'parody', 'women', 'meaningless', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'Instead', 'almost', 'empty', 'heads', 'empty', 'lives']",N/A
