Luke's life started off wrong when He was a little Boy .It wasn't His fault !  He was so lost! He realized He could make It on His Own(do it His way"")  He was haunted for Years.He resented His Dad so Much He wouldn't take His calls!  I loved this movies because it Shows how Much Courage it takes to do the right thing! ! He was so bitter He wouldn't talk to His Dad on the phone when He called!John Schneider played  His Dad & He as always did a Great acting Job! Luke learned about ""Truth & Consequences BEFORE He ruined His Life! It was a story that made Me laugh & than CRY! It was wonderfully written showing living takes a ""Lot of Courage ""There are some very SAD Scenes in the story showing You have the Choice of standing FIRM in what You  believe or suffering down the road because You took the easy way out for You at the time.  It is very true to life""Problems happen to Everyone! ! it is the WAY We chose to handle Them that counts! Jeremy Jones Played Luke & He did a FINE JOB playing His Role!

Most are operating on a LOW Budjet & Need a BIG name to attract the  Audience ..He is a great actor,Well known & People will watch this movie just because His Name is with this Movie!However,the other Actors did a great jpb!
