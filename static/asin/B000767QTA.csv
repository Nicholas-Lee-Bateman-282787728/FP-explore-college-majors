It had good characters with a range of emotions and depth that could help you feel for the characters. But as the show went on, it became convoluted and pretentious. Now I don't mind shows that make you think, in fact, I'm all for cerebral entertainment. The show took depth to far and made a black hole. Depth is good, black holes anywhere near me,bad. The use of evangelical symbols and names was a genius move(or rediculous move in this case) on the part of the creator. The relationship between characters and symbolic meanings makes for a more interesting show. Unfortunately, there was barely any relationships to be had. I have read that during an interview, the creator was asked about all the religious symbols, in which he answered that he threw them in because it was ""cool""(if you need clarification, search the hundreds of anime and NGE forums).I have read countless threads on countless Anime forums where people try to decipher and make sense of NGE. Most of the time, these individuals go so far over the edge to convince others(and themselves) that so and so meant this or that.As far as characters go, Shinji was the most annoying. I went from feeling sorry for him to hoping he would sustain a fatal wound. How much whining and crying do I have to listen to before he commits to any action.The ""lets all watch what we've seen already"" episodes dulled the series down even more for me. It is the one thing I dislike the most about many a anime.Lets not leave out the last episodes. I'm sorry, were the artists and writer on some sort of hallucinogen. Episode 25 and 26 certainly provided closure for me in the sense that I ended up not caring about what happened to the characters. Now I know why the movies were made(which I have not and will not see).This anime is over-analyzed and overhyped. For me, reading all the hype and interpretations before hand made the viewing all the more difficult.So why give this two stars after my tirade above. Unlike many animes I have viewed, NGE did a great job at hooking me at the beginning(not much could be said as the series went on). Secondly, I have seen anime much worse(although not as hyped).And finally, I gear a lot of my ""anger"" towards the people who made NGE what it is today. If it wasn't for all the hype surrounding NGE, it might have made for a semi-decent anime.As for what you get for the price, It's about right on par. Not much in the way of extras. The animation is very crisp and the packaging is to my liking. I have never been a stickler for packaging or extras unless the price of the DVD(s) should reflect it. Considering what it cost a couple of years ago, this is a great deal.",2,A negative review for an overhyped anime,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,2887,"['Now', 'go', 'directly', 'Was', 'review', 'helpful', 'section', 'click', 'solely', 'based', 'title', 'review', 'hope', 'read', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'was', 'intrigued', 'had', 'good', 'characters', 'range', 'emotions', 'depth', 'could', 'help', 'feel', 'characters', 'show', 'went', 'became', 'convoluted', 'pretentious', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'shows', 'make', 'think', 'fact', ""'m"", 'cerebral', 'entertainment', 'show', 'took', 'depth', 'far', 'made', 'black', 'hole', 'Depth', 'good', 'black', 'holes', 'anywhere', 'bad', 'use', 'evangelical', 'symbols', 'names', 'was', 'genius', 'move', 'rediculous', 'move', 'case', 'part', 'creator', 'relationship', 'characters', 'symbolic', 'meanings', 'more', 'interesting', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'barely', 'relationships', 'be', 'had', 'have', 'read', 'interview', 'creator', 'was', 'asked', 'religious', 'symbols', 'answered', 'threw', 'was', 'cool', 'need', 'clarification', 'search', 'hundreds', 'anime', 'NGE', 'forums', '.I', 'have', 'read', 'countless', 'threads', 'countless', 'Anime', 'forums', 'where', 'people', 'try', 'decipher', 'make', 'sense', 'NGE', 'Most', 'time', 'individuals', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'edge', 'convince', 'others', 'so', 'so', 'meant', 'that.As', 'far', 'characters', 'go', 'Shinji', 'was', 'most', 'annoying', 'went', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'hoping', 'would', 'sustain', 'fatal', 'wound', 'How', 'much', 'whining', 'crying', 'do', 'have', 'listen', 'action.The', 'watch', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'episodes', 'dulled', 'series', 'down', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'thing', 'dislike', 'most', 'about', 'many', 'anime.Lets', 'not', 'leave', 'out', 'last', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'were', 'artists', 'writer', 'sort', 'hallucinogen', '25', '26', 'certainly', 'provided', 'closure', 'sense', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'have', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'see', '.This', 'anime', 'over-analyzed', 'overhyped', 'reading', 'hype', 'interpretations', 'hand', 'made', 'viewing', 'more', 'difficult.So', 'why', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'tirade', 'many', 'animes', 'have', 'viewed', 'NGE', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'hooking', 'beginning', 'not', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'series', 'went', 'Secondly', 'have', 'seen', 'anime', 'much', 'worse', 'not', 'hyped', '.And', 'finally', 'gear', 'lot', 'anger', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'NGE', 'what', 'today', 'was', ""n't"", 'hype', 'surrounding', 'NGE', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'semi-decent', 'anime.As', 'what', 'get', 'price', 'about', 'right', 'par', 'Not', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'animation', 'very', 'crisp', 'packaging', 'liking', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'stickler', 'packaging', 'extras', 'price', 'DVD', 'should', 'reflect', 'Considering', 'what', 'cost', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'great', 'deal']",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection

This is not season 2 of Evangelion!I was ready to rate this review with one star. But i decided to rate it based on its overall content. ADV for the most part has released decent and consistent anime. Their original dubbing during the VHS tape era was poor, but i think they have improved drastically over the years. Their box sets can be a bit pricey and i only purchase them when a huge sale is going on, because i refuse to pay full retail price. But when they have a HOT title they know typically SELLS, they will have no problem JACKING up the RETAIL price for no reason at all. Same thing does for DN Angel and NOIR.I know there was so much hype around this series. I actually don't see what the big deal was? We had Dual Parallel and Rahxephon which were all similar to this series about a boy being able to control a robot. This one i guess was the most popular of the three and i am sure countless others.But overall this is a good series and has a lot to offer anime fans and new anime fans alike. The only difference with this box set is that you get the Evangelion movie. Which is a great idea! But they've released so many Evangelion box sets that the movie should have been included with prior releases. But ADV has a huge habit of double dipping as do other companies. Definitely pick this title up.

877032,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000767QTA,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[12, 39]","This series began with a simple, almost stupid concept involving giant mecha-Angels attacking New Japan and little kids who can sync up with Evas to fight them.The mere logic and mechanics behind these battles is infuriating in how ridiculously off-the-wall bat**** insane they are.  It seems like in every single battle with every single angel, without fail, one or all of the Evas is brutally and gruesomely damaged almost beyond repair, and every little scheme or superweapon developed by NERV has a chance of success dangling near the 1% mark.  It started to become a running joke for me to laugh when a gigantic super-laser that would suck up half the country's power supply to fire one shot had something like a ""0.00000018167%"" chance of success, and they just go ""fire it anyway"", and it somehow works on the second shot.But the real shining star of the series was the character interaction, particularly between Shinji, Asuka, and Rei.  They had adorable moments together, and lots of school-aged sexual tension that never got raunchy or disgustingly over the top.Then around the early-middle of the series, this sort of interaction started to lessen, as the characters became less well-rounded, and more stereotypical caricatures of their sex, and then later of mental illnesses.Shinji went from a shy, sweet young boy desperate for his father's attention, to something resembling a schizophrenic who lives only for praise, and then when he receives said praise, he accuses the praisers of lying to him just to make him go and fight in the Eva.Asuka was my favorite character, and she was most like me with her sassy attitude and hitting people-ness.  Then they start digging up this backstory of her mother going insane, and beginning to think a doll is her actual daughter Asuka, and ignoring the real Asuka as ""that other girl"", culminating in Asuka coming home from school to find her mother has hanged herself and the doll.It would have been interesting to explore this effect on Asuka IF and ONLY IF it had been properly researched and gone into minor psychology from which Asuka could overcome this problem or fall to despair from it.Instead, she just goes crazy, moping around like Shinji, and generally acting ""decidedly"" unpredictable, in that her actions seem to be only motivated by plot convenience.Rei Ayanami had a chance to be someone who would stand out, who would somehow, despite not being an individual (spoiler alert) would somehow break out of that shell with Shinji's help and establish herself as her own person.  This entire subplot was being established every time Shinji tried to emotionally connect with her.Misato Katsuragi was humorous and interesting enough on her own, but then they give her an unresolved-relationship-end thing dealy with that other guy.  This had the makings of a typical romantic comedy-drama, but since the whole series devolved into a series of caricatures of mental illnesses, she becomes insane and obsessive and a cliche' stereotype of a ""hysterical woman"".The Blonde woman (whose name I forgot) simply goes insane, and thinks her mother's spirit lives on in the Three Magi machines, and starts to talk to them like they're her mother.  Also, she was apparently raised with ""traditional japanese values"", which means she believes women are a completely different species from men, and thus somehow it is impossible for them to relate.Everyone else who was formerly a real character simply becomes a canvas upon which a depressed artist paints what he believes to be real and relevant portraits of the worst of humanity, but only show that this artist has not done his research, and has no experience with the human condition to understand how a person falls to their bad experiences, and what they do to overcome or get run down by them.  Everyone in this series is simply a convenient prop piece for the artist's bitter message on how humanity is trash.But that is including the ""End of Evangelion"" ending.The original show earns one star from me for its ending, one which should have been kept.  In it, Shinji, in a surrealist sort of place, struggles with his internal demons, and eventually overcomes, realizing that he has control over his life, and he is suddenly surrounded by all the characters of the series, applauding him overcoming his whiny man-child emo shell and becoming a real, well-rounded person once more.The messages in this series had great potential, but were poorly executed by a storyline which seemed to have been either written by entirely different people mid-way through, or was being steadily transformed by a depressed director who was probably not involved in the final episode, judging by how he went and changed it in ""End of Evangelion"".Either way, despite the good character design, initially great character chemistry and development, and initially interesting concepts and philosophy, it completely fell apart from its message, and became gratuitously overbearing and pretentious, with a severely narrow-ranging view of the sexes, and rather childish sexism you expect in disillusioned pubescent adolescents without a proper guiding hand in their development.",1,An initially good series that suffered severe entropy,1233878400,"02 6,

877035,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000767QTA,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[235, 255]","The changes in the Platinum version of Evangelion from the Perfect Collection are small, with four director's cut episodes and commentary. (I received an e-mail recently, which noted I left out 5.1 sound and better picture quality, though than anime still looks washed and the sound is only clear in surround sound). But, they are changes in what is perhaps one of the best animes ever created, and to fans, that is more than enough to spend their money.If that wasn't enough for you then, then here is your opportunity. Take it from someone who thrives off of these thin-pack box sets. The value of them is beyond compare. All of them have sturdy boxes with artwork on them. You get entire series for what is usually half the price you would spend buying the entire series, and you save on shelf-space. In this case, where there were seven DVDs in the entire series that go for $27 a pop (7 x 27 = 189 plus tax and possibly shipping), you'll end up saving big. How can you beat that?I recommend this for anyone who doesn't have the original box set and for fans of anime of the highest quality. This is the best giant-robot anime, one of the top ten ever, and will go down as something magical and important in anime in the same way that Akira did. Plus, I recommend this for the value itself (7 x 27 = 189 - 48 = 141 = How can you beat that?).(ADDED LATER) I've received a lot of e-mail regarding the extra features, inserts, and DVD count, so I'm going to address these issues now. Firstly, there is only six DVDs, but the episodes are condensed into the six so there is no need to worry about that. The final disc contains the director's cut episodes. Also, there are few extras on the disc, and in case you enjoy the inserts that tend to come with DVDs, the DVDs in the box set won't have them.",5,Evangelion Perfection,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,1799,"['changes', 'Platinum', 'version', 'Evangelion', 'Perfect', 'Collection', 'are', 'small', 'four', 'director', 'cut', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'received', 'e-mail', 'recently', 'noted', 'left', 'out', '5.1', 'sound', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'anime', 'still', 'washed', 'sound', 'only', 'clear', 'surround', 'sound', 'are', 'changes', 'what', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'animes', 'ever', 'created', 'fans', 'more', 'enough', 'spend', 'money.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'then', 'then', 'here', 'opportunity', 'Take', 'someone', 'who', 'thin-pack', 'box', 'sets', 'value', 'compare', 'have', 'sturdy', 'boxes', 'artwork', 'get', 'entire', 'series', 'what', 'usually', 'price', 'would', 'spend', 'buying', 'entire', 'series', 'save', 'shelf-space', 'case', 'where', 'were', 'seven', 'DVDs', 'entire', 'series', 'go', '27', 'pop', '7', 'x', '27', '=', '189', 'tax', 'possibly', 'shipping', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'saving', 'big', 'How', 'can', 'beat', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'original', 'box', 'set', 'fans', 'anime', 'highest', 'quality', 'best', 'giant-robot', 'anime', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'ever', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'something', 'magical', 'important', 'anime', 'same', 'way', 'Akira', 'did', 'recommend', 'value', '7', 'x', '27', '=', '189', '48', '141', '=', 'How', 'can', 'beat', 'ADDED', 'LATER', ""'ve"", 'received', 'lot', 'e-mail', 'regarding', 'extra', 'features', 'inserts', 'DVD', 'count', ""'m"", 'going', 'address', 'issues', 'now', 'Firstly', 'only', 'six', 'DVDs', 'episodes', 'are', 'condensed', 'six', 'so', 'need', 'worry', 'final', 'disc', 'director', 'cut', 'episodes', 'Also', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'disc', 'case', 'enjoy', 'inserts', 'tend', 'come', 'DVDs', 'DVDs', 'box', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have']",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection

In the early and late episodes, the drama almost seems like Evangelion's main focus.Surprisingly, the middle episodes are somewhat light hearted which actually was an excellent decision.

At first glance merely a ""Giant Fighting Robots"" anime, it evolves quickly into something much more. What that is depends on personal interpretations, but that is irrevevant. It is, simply, unbelievable.The entire series has previously been released in various forms. The original 8 DVDs were compiled into the ""Perfect Collection"" a few years ago, priced at about $150. The set is gorgeous, but shortly after its release ""Director's Cut"" editions of several episodes were released. Shortly after those releases, ""Platinum Editions"" were released, with remastered sound and enhanced audio.This new ""Platinum Collection"" contains those most recent, Platinum versions of the series. The set is comprised of 6 ""Thinpack"" DVDs - which are held in a very sturdy, high-quality cardboard case - taking up roughly the space of three normal-sized DVDs. The first five discs contain all 26 original episodes of the series on very attractive, simple silver discs. The 6th disc contains the Director's Cut versions of episodes 21-24. There are no special features on this set.Yes, this is a seemingly shameful double-dip of the series, but it is, like the series itself, simply the best there is to offer as far as Anime box sets go. It is simple, attractively designed, and most importantly inexpensive. It is certainly not recommendable to buy this if you already own the Perfect Collection, but otherwise this is the set to buy. The only flaw is the absence of the two films - ""The End of Evangelion,"" an alternative to the disappointing final two episodes of the series, and the vastly inferior ""Death & Rebirth."" While hard-core fans will be disappointed by the lack of special features, which were undeniably sub-par in the Perfect Collection anyway, most will likely prefer this set, both for its atractive packaging and incredbily reasonable pricetag.",5,Simply The Best,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,1963,"['arguably', 'best', 'anime', 'series', 'ever', 'created', 'themes', 'have', 'resonated', 'fans', 'genre', 'decade', 'first', 'glance', 'merely', 'Giant', 'Fighting', 'Robots', 'anime', 'quickly', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'What', 'personal', 'interpretations', 'irrevevant', 'simply', 'unbelievable.The', 'entire', 'series', 'previously', 'been', 'released', 'various', 'forms', 'original', '8', 'DVDs', 'were', 'compiled', 'Perfect', 'Collection', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'priced', 'about', '150', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'shortly', 'release', 'Director', 'Cut', 'editions', 'several', 'episodes', 'were', 'released', 'Shortly', 'releases', 'Platinum', 'Editions', 'were', 'released', 'remastered', 'sound', 'enhanced', 'audio.This', 'new', 'Platinum', 'Collection', 'most', 'recent', 'Platinum', 'versions', 'series', 'set', 'comprised', '6', 'Thinpack', 'DVDs', 'are', 'held', 'very', 'sturdy', 'high-quality', 'cardboard', 'case', 'taking', 'up', 'roughly', 'space', 'three', 'normal-sized', 'DVDs', 'first', 'five', 'discs', 'contain', '26', 'original', 'episodes', 'series', 'very', 'attractive', 'simple', 'silver', 'discs', '6th', 'disc', 'Director', 'Cut', 'versions', 'episodes', '21-24', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'set.Yes', 'seemingly', 'shameful', 'double-dip', 'series', 'series', 'simply', 'best', 'offer', 'as', 'far', 'Anime', 'box', 'sets', 'go', 'simple', 'attractively', 'designed', 'most', 'importantly', 'inexpensive', 'certainly', 'not', 'recommendable', 'buy', 'already', 'own', 'Perfect', 'Collection', 'otherwise', 'set', 'buy', 'only', 'flaw', 'absence', 'two', 'films', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'alternative', 'disappointing', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'series', 'vastly', 'inferior', 'Death', 'Rebirth', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'undeniably', 'sub-par', 'Perfect', 'Collection', 'anyway', 'most', 'will', 'likely', 'prefer', 'set', 'atractive', 'packaging', 'incredbily', 'reasonable', 'pricetag']",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection
877040,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000767QTA,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 4]","Despite haters of the show, you can't really escape the influence and impact Neon Genesis Evangelion had on the anime world. Hotly debated yet receives just as much love as it does renouncing, if people are first entering the anime field, this is usually picked as a ""starter series"". While plot is sometimes confusing and characters speak in philosophy speeches at times, it's still a great although slightly overrated show but it's filled with enough memorable aspects that it at least deserves a viewing.The year is 2015 and humanity's population has been cut in half. Thanks to an event known as ""Second Impact"", the climate has changed and people in New Tokyo-3 are living in a city built higher than the water levels. Appearing now and then are weird and massive creatures known as ""Angels"" where conventional weaponry is useless. However organization NERV has created the Evangelions, giant mech robots designed to fight them back. But things aren't as simple as the designated pilots; Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langley Soryru and Rei Ayanami, have to contend with their own personal issues as well as the real reason Second Impact happened and the potential for a Third.Evangelion is one of those kind of shows where it does tend to stay with you, whether you liked the show or not. There's enough iconic imagery or scenes as well as characters that even 9 years after watching the initial run, I'm amazed at how much of it I remember. In fact, I even understand the show more having seen it a second time. Of course some things are fuzzy and the more philosophical dialogue characters go on sometimes goes over my head but not once do I feel like I'm being intentionally led around because people think confusion equals depth. At least here it's better written and more existential than the animated online comic ""Broken Saints"". Talk about pretentious.Is there some issues with the show? Of course. There's a noticeable pattern in some episodes. Angel shows up when characters whine about whatever, angel does something completely surprising and characters do something completely out of left field to save the day. Having characters repeatedly say something is having no effect or no response over and over can get pretty old. Not to mention some characters don't really grow. Asuka is a controlling, egotistical ***** when she starts and she's pretty much the same when she ends as well as Shinji who is basically doing things because others tell him to but would rather just do nothing yet feel praise for doing something. As for episodes 25 and 26, there's been so much hatred for them that while I don't dismiss them since they're actually well-done, I can understand at how some might not like how the series decided to end.My one gripe with this package is what's not included. The individual sets came with special features such as commentaries. While some might not completely mourn the loss of these, some might feel cheapened that you're not experiencing the completeness of the set, missing out on what others who buy the single editions get. So it all depends on economy and the amount of bonus features you want: lots of stuff included with the episodes or a relatively inexpensive box set compared to buying them separately.While many other series might be more advanced animation-wise and had longer seasons, not many have had the impact Evangelion has and it's a series that at least everyone interested in anime should watch at least once.",5,4.5; a mind bender of a series,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,3461,"['haters', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'escape', 'influence', 'impact', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'had', 'anime', 'world', 'Hotly', 'debated', 'yet', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'renouncing', 'people', 'are', 'first', 'entering', 'anime', 'field', 'usually', 'picked', 'starter', 'series', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'characters', 'speak', 'philosophy', 'speeches', 'times', 'still', 'great', 'slightly', 'overrated', 'show', 'filled', 'enough', 'memorable', 'aspects', 'least', 'deserves', 'viewing.The', 'year', '2015', 'humanity', 'population', 'been', 'cut', 'half', 'Thanks', 'event', 'known', 'Second', 'Impact', 'climate', 'changed', 'people', 'New', 'Tokyo-3', 'are', 'living', 'city', 'built', 'higher', 'water', 'levels', 'Appearing', 'now', 'then', 'are', 'weird', 'massive', 'creatures', 'known', 'Angels', 'where', 'conventional', 'weaponry', 'useless', 'However', 'organization', 'NERV', 'created', 'Evangelions', 'giant', 'mech', 'robots', 'designed', 'fight', 'back', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'simple', 'designated', 'pilots', 'Shinji', 'Ikari', 'Asuka', 'Langley', 'Soryru', 'Rei', 'Ayanami', 'have', 'contend', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'reason', 'Second', 'Impact', 'happened', 'potential', 'Third.Evangelion', 'one', 'kind', 'shows', 'where', 'tend', 'stay', 'liked', 'show', 'not', 'enough', 'iconic', 'imagery', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'even', '9', 'years', 'watching', 'initial', 'run', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'remember', 'fact', 'even', 'understand', 'show', 'more', 'having', 'seen', 'second', 'time', 'course', 'things', 'are', 'fuzzy', 'more', 'philosophical', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'go', 'sometimes', 'head', 'not', 'once', 'do', 'feel', ""'m"", 'being', 'intentionally', 'led', 'around', 'people', 'think', 'confusion', 'equals', 'depth', 'least', 'here', 'better', 'written', 'more', 'existential', 'animated', 'online', 'comic', 'Broken', 'Saints', 'Talk', 'pretentious.Is', 'issues', 'show', 'course', 'noticeable', 'pattern', 'episodes', 'Angel', 'up', 'when', 'characters', 'whine', 'whatever', 'angel', 'something', 'completely', 'surprising', 'characters', 'do', 'something', 'completely', 'left', 'field', 'save', 'day', 'Having', 'characters', 'repeatedly', 'say', 'something', 'having', 'effect', 'response', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'old', 'Not', 'mention', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'grow', 'Asuka', 'controlling', 'egotistical', '*****', 'when', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'when', 'as', 'well', 'Shinji', 'who', 'basically', 'doing', 'things', 'others', 'tell', 'would', 'rather', 'just', 'do', 'nothing', 'yet', 'feel', 'praise', 'doing', 'something', 'episodes', '25', '26', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'hatred', 'do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', ""'re"", 'actually', 'well-done', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'how', 'series', 'decided', 'end.My', 'one', 'gripe', 'package', 'what', 'not', 'included', 'individual', 'sets', 'came', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'commentaries', 'might', 'not', 'completely', 'mourn', 'loss', 'might', 'feel', 'cheapened', ""'re"", 'not', 'experiencing', 'completeness', 'set', 'missing', 'out', 'what', 'others', 'who', 'buy', 'single', 'editions', 'get', 'economy', 'amount', 'bonus', 'features', 'want', 'lots', 'stuff', 'included', 'episodes', 'relatively', 'inexpensive', 'box', 'set', 'compared', 'buying', 'separately.While', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'advanced', 'animation-wise', 'had', 'longer', 'seasons', 'not', 'many', 'have', 'had', 'impact', 'Evangelion', 'series', 'least', 'everyone', 'interested', 'anime', 'should', 'watch', 'least', 'once']",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection

I own this, the Movie, Rebuild of Evangelion, and the ""Angelic Days"" manga. But I am not here sell you on my fandom, I'm here to review this product free from bias. If you've managed to go this entire time avoiding spoilers for the series, then I'll do you a favor and write this review spoiler free.Neon Genesis Evangelion centers on Shinji Ikari, a 14-year old boy who has been drafted into piloting a giant robot called ""Evangelion Unit 01,"" and protecting his new home, Tokyo-3, from mysterious beings known as ""Angels.""Eva feels very blue-collar at the start. NERV, the government agency that created the Evangelions, is very bureaucratic. Unlike a Gundam pilot that does whatever he wants, Shinji has a boss, Misato, who has a boss herself, who has bosses ordering him around. The Evangelion is battery powered and has a regular riffle with bullets that doesn't run on sunshine and magic. Whenever something goes wrong, there's a stack of papers on Misato's desk. You might scoff and say, ""That's stupid,"" but it gives Eva a different ""flavor"" that makes it unique.The second half of the series is infamous around the anime world, as we see the characters steadily lose control over their own lives. Asuka, the second Eva pilot, starts off as a jerk that thinks she should be in charge, heads into bitchy territory before trauma ruins her career. The rest of the cast spirals into similar dark territory.So, if I like it so much, why did I give it Four Stars? Because the ending sucks. The ending is even more infamous around the world. Fact is that the animation studio ran out of money and had put together the last two episodes out of clips and still shots. What we get is the cast sitting in a chair discussing their psychological problems. It's cleaver insight into the characters, but it's presented in such a boring way that it drags down the rest of the series.The real ending is the appropriately titledNeon Genesis Evangelion - The End Of Evangelion. You're supposed to discount the two offending episodes (25 and 26), and watch the movie instead. But, you got to buy it separately,  and it's as much a head-scratcher as the rest of Evangelion.""What about the Rebuild of Evangelion series?"" You might be asking, ""Should I get this or that?"" Rebuild is a complete reboot/remake of the series. It's not an HD clean-up /recut like Dragonball Z Kai. It's completely redone animation. Even though it starts the same as regular Eva, it's going to go in a different direction with new characters added. And, because it's a movie, the pacing is different.Lastly, let me give you a hints to help you enjoy this series more: there is no ""Deep Mysteries of Eva."" You're going to hear some religious terms thrown around throughout the series ""Angels."" ""Deadsea Scrolls,"" ""Adam,"" and more. These don't mean anything. It's not a religious allegory. It's not a metaphor. Eva was made entirely for a Japanese audience, without any idea that it would ever be seen outside Japan. Those were just fancy foreign words thrown into the scripts to make it more mysterious to the audience.

877043,A2HM796P90DP8U,B000767QTA,Eddie,"[0, 1]","I had heard bits and pieces about this anime since I started collecting cels. I always recognized them because they are probably some of the most expensive anime cels out there. Even so I had never seen the anime, but I heard from many others that it was a great timeless anime. Now I don't have a specific genre of anime I like, just whatever happens to come my way, which seems to be giant robot ones and sci fi ness. So I took a chance when Best Buy put the series set on sale and bought it. It actually sat on my shelf for several months until recently.Spoilers may be below.The anime is about a boy named Shinji who is selected as the third child to pilot the Evangelion(robot) 001. He is pretty depressed about it but pilots it anyway. He and 2 other pilots Rei and Asuka all fight these monsters called Angels. During the anime Shinji goes through a great deal of stress and emotion wondering why he is here and what his lifes meaning is. Despite being an action packed series it is very psycological. The series ends abruptly with Shinji's mind wandering in itself.I have to say I was never expecting to enjoy this anime as much as I did. It really was brilliantly done in almost all aspects of it. The music was enjoyable and the characters were very human. Shinji the main character is very depressing, but in that aspect of him it seems how a real person would be acting. Even though the robots or Eva's as they're referred to are a big part of the story they don't overshadow the human characters. The only thing I really had a problem with was the ending of the anime. The last 2 episodes got really confusing to the point where I had no idea what was going on. Lots of still images and flashing. I was really happy to see the ending much better explained in the Evangelion movie End of Evangelion.The dvds in this set are in slim cases which I am not a fan of. But the dvds themselves seem to be of good quality. I'm happy with the purchase. Overall I really enjoyed the anime and am happy that I did.

877044,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000767QTA,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[1, 3]","Based on the reviews I've read so far it would seem that when one decides to delve into the world of anime they will eventually come upon this series.  While I did not give this a full five stars, I can definitely see why it is praised highly.  On the flip side I can also see why a few people disliked it, thanks to the way the series ended.  Regardless, I personally found it a very enjoyable series, but I don't think it's the greatest thing ever made.  Not to me at least.  I'll admit that at first I had a little trouble getting into the characters, but once I did I was definitely into the whole series.  Shinji is just such a hard guy to like watching sometimes.Anyway, Neon Genesis Evangelion puts us in a world that is nearly destroyed.  The reason this happened is because of these strange beings called ""angels"".  The show takes us on quite an adventure centered on a boy named Shinji who has a destiny to fulfill.  The series opens with an attack by one of these angels and Shinji is caught in the midst of it, but is due to be picked up by someone.  She is charged to bring him back to the secret government base his father works at called Nerv.  Needless to say she succeeds, since its episode one and we wouldn't have much of a series if the main character died there.  Anyway, Shinji will prove to be instrumental in the defeat of these angels thanks to a machine his father built called the Eva.  They are sort of like giant robots, which is why I would class this as a Mecha, but the Evas have an organic/genetic component in their designing (you find out more about this towards the end of the series and I won't ruin the full breadth of the revelation for you).  Anyway, Shinji, never having piloted one of these machines before, refuses, but is sort of forced into it and thus his career as an Eva pilot started in the very first episode.  Sounds like most everything is explained huh?  Not in the least, there is SO much more to this series and that's one of the reasons it's so great.  You see there's more than just one Eva in the world and thus more than one pilot because the Eva has to genetically mesh with its pilot so it's a lot more than driving the machines we see in other Mecha or what we find in things like Battletech.  The other requirement is the pilot has to be fourteen.  The other pilot already with us is Rei, but she really was too injured in a prior accident to pilot on that fateful day while seeing her so injured and his fathers immovable lack of compassion, Shinji felt the weight of the battle was on him.As you can see Shinji's father is not a likeable person and we are shown this in the first episode as well.  From there we are introduced to an array of varying characters, especially when Shinji gets entered into the school at Nerv headquarters.  Shinji is sort of out of touch with reality, but still wants something out of it, so he's kind of in between.  Rei on the other hand is completely removed and she's more like a robotic human just going through the motions.  We see a couple hints of her humanity show up every now and again, but she does come across as incredibly bright and observant.  Later we become introduced to the third pilot from Germany, Ayako.  She was one of my favorites next to Rei and she's very in touch with the world.  She's very engaged with the world around her and she's very motivated to be an Eva pilot, unlike Shinji who doesn't want to be and Rei who just does as she's told.  Despite the action sequences where the Evas have to face the Angel enemies there is a major dramatic component to this series that focuses on how these children have to deal with their very intense responsibility.  One wonders how the mind of someone so young can truly cope with what they're doing.If you're really just in it for the action you might not get as into this because the dramatic sequences are just as necessary and on screen just as much.  In fact, on some levels, I felt like there was sometimes too much action.  From the way they present the story it seems like an Angel attack is a rare occurrence, but in almost every episode there's an attack.  Our characters don't even get a rest to deal with their social problems or the problems they have to deal with in their job.  Shinji clearly has the most mental stress because he's now under the command of a father who doesn't even seem to like him and favors Rei over his own son!  Rei... who isn't even his daughter!  As you can see there's a lot of strife and struggle for this, but Shinji's father has a lot to deal with as well, especially when it comes to those who control Nerv called Seele.  This doesn't change the fact that he seems to be a very immoral person, especially when we see the background episodes.That pretty much covers the premise for episodes one through twenty-four and if you like a dramatic based Mecha with some decent action sequences you'll love this.  However, when we get to the last two episodes things make almost no sense... to the point where the creators have actually already tried to rewrite this ending twice!  I will admit that the last two episodes are awesome, especially on a philosophical/psychological level.  They are absolutely profound and they really moved me to think about things in a very strange and new light.  You can get a lot out of those two episodes if you view them in their own right, however, if you try to put them in conjunction with the rest of the series it makes almost no sense.  On the ""Platinum"" edition of the box set there are director's cut episodes and upon re-watching those I see hints of the ""Human Instrumentality Project"", which is where I think the last two episodes seem to culminate, but again, it really doesn't mesh with the rest at all.  It just leaves us with no sensible conclusion to what was going on with the angels and Nerv in general.  The built up such a mysterious world in the first twenty-four episodes that to have such an off key conclusion... we're just left feeling unsatisfied.  Apparently I'm not the only one who thought these things made no sense, because I've talked to a few other people and they definitely agree.  In the end, after watching these two, I'll call them ""wtf episodes"", I'm left wondering if Shinji just made up this whole thing in his head and it never really happened.  Apparently that's a very real possibility.The art and premise of the show is very well done.  It just begins to fall apart towards the end and there's no major ending that really turns the light on in our heads to make us understand.  I'm not looking for a blatant hand out, but at least a somewhat logical progression would be nice and this show never really ends that way.  I think it's good for what it is, but I think it had so much potential that never got truly fulfilled.  I realize everything has meaning, I mean they went to the lengths to name the angels and give them REAL angelic names so there must be some relational concept between apocalypse and angels.  After the last two episodes I'm less sure of what that concept is, even though I felt like I was on to something to figuring it out at first.  In the end if you enjoy Mecha's with very deep concepts and drama then you'll love this.  If you like the philosophical aspects found in Anime you'll love the last episodes too, but treating them as separate works seems to make more sense.  Both things are great in their own right, but together it just doesn't flow, if you know what I mean.  It really is difficult to convey in words, especially if you've never seen it before.  I still recommend watching it at least once.",4,Very good watch overall,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,7619,"['Based', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'so', 'far', 'would', 'seem', 'when', 'one', 'delve',

877046,A1KALWSKK12C18,B000767QTA,"Iron Giant ""Iron Giant""","[30, 84]","This is not the worst anime, but it is BY FAR the most over hyped and over rated pile of crap ever conceived and put in a nice box.This series is directed like a lightning bolt straight at the heart of its primary target: 14 year old boys.Right from the opening sequence the song sings to the boy: 'young boy, so innocent, become the Legend you were meant to be!', while pictures of nude teen girls roll by in sexual poses, giving promise of a sexual encounter to come.Each episode follows the same tired old plot sequence we've seen in Anime for the last 30 years: Teenagers called upon to save the world from monsters.  Yawn.  And each episode ends with a Boss encounter, just like the 14 year old boys favorite PS2 side scroller, level up video game.To further titillate the 14 year old teen boy, his 2 superior officers are 20 something women who like to party and sleep around.  His 2 fellow  ""pilots"" are teen girls, one a brooder the other a flirt.  Each episode sets up at least one, and sometimes multiple sexual fantasys.  One time they have to pilot their robots naked, you know for, um testing purposes.  One time a superior officer is interviewed nude, for no apparent reason.  One time he wrestles with his fellow pilot wearing only a towel so he can fall on her prone and naked with his hand on her breast.  One time the flirty red head pilot explains heat expansion this way: 'If I rub my breasts and make them hot, will they expand or contract?' *insert flirty laugh, tee hee hee*.  Finally his superior officer has an out and out sex scene ""don't insert that in THERE.... moan, moan* but they avoid an adult rating by not showing the action, you just hear it while looking at the coffee cup next to the bed.Evangelion tries hard to take itself seriously, pretending there is some big plot going on.  But unanswered questions are not a mystery.  Mysteries have clues, shadowy figures and a feeling that you might be able to figure it out if you get one more clue.  Evangelion has no mystery, just unanswered questions.  Take the big mystery of the Monsters attacking Earth.  No clues are given as to why or where they come from.  Lots of characters ask, but no clues are given.  In fact, most of the large so called ""mystery's"" are not resolved by the end of the story.The graphics are dated and very few fight scenes are memorable.  Many, many times they save money on graphics by having long drawn out dialog while focusing on a static shot of people walking, or a cup, or a long elevator ride from behind.  The mechs are poorly designed and all look the same.  I've been a huge mecha fan for 20+ years and these are nothing more than a humanoid figure with some armor slapped on.  To make it worse, the boss monsters (called ""Angels"" for no apparent reason) are mostly just geometric shapes so its a big guy fighting a cube, or a ball, or a long tube.  Oh noes!  Attack of the cube!  Run away!The characters are not likable on almost any level and they are all revealed to be psychotic in some way by the end of the story.  The last few episodes strip off all pretense and go straight for the nude scenes and long drawn out explanations of why people do stuff.  Its esoteric and mildly interesting and it would be great to have the characters be more interesting and contemplative in the context of an interesting story, but they finally drop the boring story with no real explanation then spend a couple episodes just recapping Freudian theories about each character.This is some of the worst crap I've seen in a long, long time and the ratings its gotten make me afraid for SciFi in general and Anime SciFi in particular.  It will be a cold day in hell before I rely on Amazon ratings again.EDIT: It has been said that this series is just too ""deep"" for some to understand.  They attempt to explain it, using information they've gleaned from Wikipedia and online fan websites.  If the show needs detailed explaining, the writers lost their way, not me.  Long and pointless discussions online try to explain who the Angels are, where the EVA's came from, etc.  Some fans even believe the whole story takes place in one kids head and none of it really happens.  They can't even agree on whats going on...  And if the show really needs a second viewing to understand its greatness, well they better have made it more interesting than this convoluted and boring plot line to justify a second viewing.Its also been said that the Movie ""End of Evangelion"" ties everything together.. mostly.  The movie also includes a scene of a teen boy masturbating over the corpse of a teen girl.I rest my case.",1,Mental pornography for 14 year old boys,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,4613,"['not',

877050,A3335LTANZCX78,B000767QTA,John Cunningham,"[2, 6]","Out of all the Anime I've watched, none have stuck with me in the same way as Neon Genesis Evangelion. With a directing style and plot line that resembles something from a Stanley Kubrick film, this show felt more real and dramatic to me than most other shows I've seen, both in animation and live action.The plot takes place in the year 2015, after a global-altering event called the Second Impact took place in the year 2000. In this post-Apocalyptic future, 14 year old Shinji Ikari is summoned to Neo Tokyo-3 by his estranged father, the leader of an organization called NERV. He soon learns that humanity is under attack from a strange breed of ""aliens"" codenamed Angels. Mankind's only hope for surivial is for Shinji and a group of other teenagers to pilot his father's creations, gaint human shaped cyborgs called Evangelions.Although the plot sounds pretty straightfoward, it is anything but. Around episode 14, things start to get weird as NERV and the organization funding it, SEELE, are revealed to be involved in a much deeper conspiracy. Meanwhile, the conflict with the Angels starts to take it's toll on the main characters, who begin to crack under the pressure. By the end of the series, most of the characters have a complete breakdown while the Apocalypse rains down around them.This set includes remastered versions of the original 26 episodes, and the 4 New Production cut episodes. Unfortunately, the real conclusion, ""the End of Evangelion"", is not included here, but it is available from Manga Entertainment. It is vital that you get that DVD as well for the full experience.If your interested in watching something light hearted and straightfoward, than this is not the show for you. The plot is complicated, and things get increasingly disturbing as the series continues, and it doesn't always answer some of the mysteries of the plot, giving the viewer enough clues to come to their own conclusions. However, if you're a fan of films such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", than is right up your alley.",5,My personal favorite,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2023,"['Anime', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'none', 'have', 'stuck', 'same', 'way', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'directing', 'style', 'plot', 'line', 'something', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'show', 'felt', 'more', 'real', 'dramatic', 'most', 'other', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'animation', 'live', 'action.The', 'plot', 'place', 'year', '2015', 'global-altering', 'event', 'called', 'Second', 'Impact', 'took', 'place', 'year', '2000', 'post-Apocalyptic', 'future', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Shinji', 'Ikari', 'summoned', 'Neo', 'Tokyo-3', 'estranged', 'father', 'leader', 'organization', 'called', 'NERV', 'soon', 'humanity', 'attack', 'strange', 'breed', 'aliens', 'codenamed', 'Angels', 'Mankind', 'only', 'hope', 'surivial', 'Shinji', 'group', 'other', 'teenagers', 'pilot', 'father', 'creations', 'gaint', 'human', 'shaped', 'cyborgs', 'called', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straightfoward', 'anything', 'episode', '14', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'weird', 'NERV', 'organization', 'funding', 'SEELE', 'are', 'revealed', 'be', 'involved', 'much', 'deeper', 'conspiracy', 'Meanwhile', 'conflict', 'Angels', 'take', 'toll', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'begin', 'crack', 'pressure', 'end', 'series', 'most', 'characters', 'have', 'complete', 'breakdown', 'Apocalypse', 'down', 'around', 'them.This', 'set', 'remastered', 'versions', 'original', '26', 'episodes', '4', 'New', 'Production', 'cut', 'episodes', 'Unfortunately', 'real', 'conclusion', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'not', 'included', 'here', 'available', 'Manga', 'Entertainment', 'vital', 'get', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'full', 'experience.If', 'interested', 'watching', 'something', 'light', 'hearted', 'straightfoward', 'not', 'show', 'plot', 'complicated', 'things', 'get', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'series', ""n't"", 'always', 'answer', 'mysteries', 'plot', 'giving', 'viewer', 'enough', 'clues', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'However', ""'re"", 'fan', 'films', 'such', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'right', 'alley']",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection
877051,A3F9VH8916IA40,B000767QTA,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[1, 2]","(This review refers to the sub version, for my dub review look at theNeon Genesis Evangelion - Perfect Collection).After seeing Eva for the first time about four months ago, I wrote a review and gave the series three stars, stating many reasons why it was and wasn't good (you can still read that review for the Perfect Collection). The review for the most part was quite neutral, but I received many comments asking me to give it another chance and watch in Japanese instead of in English. Eventually I caved, and now I'm glad I did. Although the series still suffers from some glaring flaws IMO, it is a whole lot better and easier watching it with the subtitles on than with the dubbing. The characters are presented much better and the acting is spot on. I didn't feel like strangling the main character every five seconds like I did with the dub and that in itself made the series better.---THE GOOD---The Characters in the sub are WAY better than their dub counterparts. In the dub I wanted to strangle the characters, or throw them off the cliff in annoyance and disdain. Shinji was just such a wimp I felt absolutely no sympathy for him and actually rooted on his demise (which never came). Misato was nothing but a slut, Auska a loud mouth brat, and Rei a pent up introvert.Although the characters in the sub are, on the surface, more or less the same, the way they are presented is completely different. Shinji, although still a cowardly weakling, take a dramatic change after the first volume and starts to open up to the people around him for the majority of the show. from volume 2 on to volume 6, his character is somewhat likable in the way that he starts competing with the others and relates to them as a normal human being would. In volume one, he's completely unlikable, and then slowly changes into someone who the viewer can have an easier time relating to.Rei is just the same in the dub and the sub alike. Her character is still a pent up introvert who refuses to open up. Really, she is one of the glaring flaws in this anime series. Her character never gets much attention at all, which is a shame because she could have been a very interesting character. She shows some signs of opening up in volume two, but after that all attempts at establishing her character are dropped. She exists in the background for the rest of the show, never doing or saying much of anything.At the same time, upon second viewing, the mech battles aren't nearly as bad as I remember them being. Although there is still a problem with repetition, the problem isn't as annoying as it was when I first saw it. There was considerably less yelling in the sub version which made the otherwise cheesy battles quite tense. In the dub, everything seemed centered on the angel battles, but in the sub version, the angels are more of a back-story, a side show to the characters story.Overall, almost nothing in the sub was quite as bad as it was in the dub version. The battles were better, the characters were better, and the overall mood of the series was better.---The Bad---At the same time, parts I remember as amazing were quite as good in the sub as they were in the dub. While watching the English version I remember volumes 6 and 7 being among the best episodes I've ever seen in anime, but when I watched them again, they didn't hold the same power they did when I first watched them. Auska's, Misato's, and Shinji's decent into depression all seemed to happen all at once. One episode everything's pretty much okay, the next everyone's thinking about suicide. I understand why everyone gets depressed, they all have their reasons and they are all understandable, but it didn't quite have the same power as it did in the dub. for other shows, likeNow and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set), the drama was always better in Japanese, but here it seems that just for certain parts, the dub version holds more power.Also, the ending, although a little better the second time around, is still a piece of garbage that should never have aired on TV. It seems the creator of this show though we couldn't figure out why the characters were depressed by ourselves so he created episode 25 to spell it out in minute detail and cover every single little thought they had. Was this really necessary? I already know why they all hate themselves; episode 25 is just throwing every ounce of subtlety away and spelling everything out for us in a really long and boring way. the music doesn't help out any, driving the viewer more towards sleep than interest, and the animation is, for the most part, just some character sitting in a dark room while his/her younger self talks to them in a monotone voice.Episode 26 is a little better, but not by much. If you like hearing people talk to themselves, than maybe you'll like this, but otherwise this episode will have you falling asleep. The whole episode is just psycho babble, Shinji telling us (again) that he hates himself and everyone asking him why. At the very end we get a glimpse of an alternate world where the angels never showed up, and all the characters have very different personalities. This is near the end, and from that part up until the closing shot it's pretty decent. Overall, the ending is just too needlessly boring. its the kind of ""artistic"" ending that a college film student will make and his teacher will praise, but everyone else in the class will fall asleep while watching. it may be ""artsy"" but its boring and peointlesly complicated and doesn't finish the stoy in any way.Other complaints and positives I had from my first review still stand, I just don't want to repeat myself again.If you are thinking about watching this series, please for the love of god, watch it in Japanese. Do not ever bother with the English version, it sucks.

877052,A90T3KYEGBZGL,B000767QTA,"Joseph A. Mitjavila ""Zeph""","[0, 3]","I figured I'd write up a quick summary of what the differences are amoung the FOUR platinum sets that are available to purchase. It took lots of research and surfing reviews and evangelion forums to distinguish the small differences. ALL these sets come with the directors cut, have been remastered and have 5.1 surround sound.I'll begin with the platinum collection slim pack. Its a great buy for someone that has not seen the series or is begininng to start a collection and whats to save money/shelf space. But, you will get what you pay for. There are NO extra features i.e commentaries, background info etc. yes, the director cuts are included.The second one is the evangelion: complete platinum collection. It's the same as the slim pack, only it does NOT contain individual slim cases. Instead its the bulky case that has all the dvd's inside one case. Honestly, you are better off with the slim pack. Atleast it has cool art design per case and the pricing is better.The next two are arguable as to which is considered the top tier collector item. The argument stems from what I've read in forums, but up to the buyer to decide. In myopinion it's the individually built platinum collection set which i will describe below. I own it aswell, cost a pretty penny but worth it.The third set is actually self built. Meaning you have to buy the the dvds individually. eva: platinum collection 1 comes with a collector art box which you can insert the rest of the dvds in. It comes packed with extra features, commentaries and the last dvd #7 contains a special feature entitled, ""mythology of evangelion"" couple guys give their take on what the eva story is about. just food for thought and interesting to think about. what makes this set unique are the silver slim cases that comes with each dvd and the 12 page booklets in each case that contains back stories on all the eva's/angels/characters/significant events and some cool still pictures.the fourth set is the Evangelion Platinum: Perfect Collection which comes in a large tin/metal colletor case housing all the original individual platinum dvds i described up top. this set contains all the features but does not come with the informative booklet OR the slim silver box per dvd. since the case is large your dvds will slide around.hope this helps you narrow down your choice on which set to purchase and i hope you really enjoy the series as much as i have.",5,collectors quick reference guide,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,2418,"['figured', ""'d"", 'write', 'up', 'quick', 'summary', 'what', 'differences', 'are', 'FOUR', 'platinum', 'sets', 'are', 'available', 'purchase', 'took', 'lots', 'research', 'surfing', 'reviews', 'evangelion', 'forums', 'distinguish', 'small', 'differences', 'sets', 'come', 'directors', 'cut', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'have', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound.I', ""'ll"", 'begin', 'platinum', 'collection', 'slim', 'pack', 'great', 'buy', 'someone', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'begininng', 'start', 'collection', 'whats', 'save', 'space', 'will', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'are', 'NO', 'extra', 'features', 'i.e', 'commentaries', 'background', 'info', 'etc', 'yes', 'director', 'cuts', 'are', 'included.The', 'second', 'one', 'evangelion', 'complete', 'platinum', 'collection', 'same', 'slim', 'pack', 'only', 'NOT', 'contain', 'individual', 'slim', 'cases', 'Instead', 'bulky', 'case', 'dvd', 'one', 'case', 'Honestly', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'slim', 'pack', 'cool', 'art', 'design', 'case', 'pricing', 'better.The', 'next', 'two', 'are', 'arguable', 'considered', 'top', 'tier', 'collector', 'item', 'argument', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'forums', 'up', 'buyer', 'decide', 'myopinion', 'individually', 'built', 'platinum', 'collection', 'set', 'i', 'will', 'describe', 'own', 'aswell', 'cost', 'pretty', 'penny', 'worth', 'it.The', 'third', 'set', 'actually', 'self', 'built', 'Meaning', 'have', 'buy', 'dvds', 'individually', 'eva', 'platinum', 'collection', '1', 'collector', 'art', 'box', 'can', 'insert', 'rest', 'dvds', 'packed', 'extra', 'features', 'commentaries', 'last', 'dvd', '7', 'special', 'feature', 'entitled', 'mythology', 'evangelion', 'couple', 'guys', 'give', 'take', 'what', 'eva', 'story', 'about', 'just', 'food', 'thought', 'interesting', 'think', 'what', 'set', 'unique', 'are', 'silver', 'slim', 'cases', 'dvd', '12', 'page', 'booklets', 'case', 'back', 'stories', ""eva's/angels/characters/significant"", 'events', 'cool', 'still', 'pictures.the', 'fourth', 'set', 'Evangelion', 'Platinum', 'Perfect', 'Collection', 'large', 'tin/metal', 'colletor', 'case', 'housing', 'original', 'individual', 'platinum', 'dvds', 'i', 'described', 'up', 'top', 'set', 'features', 'not', 'come', 'informative', 'booklet', 'OR', 'slim', 'silver', 'box', 'dvd', 'case', 'large', 'dvds', 'will', 'slide', 'around.hope', 'narrow', 'down', 'choice', 'set', 'purchase', 'i', 'hope', 'really', 'enjoy', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'i', 'have']",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection

His father tells him he must pilot a giant humanoid robot to protect the world from the invading angels. The angels and the Evangelion that Shinji pilots both have a secret. They were both alternate possibilities of humanity in the when the world began. There are many dark secrets and conspiracies afoot behind the scenes. Shinji has some major psychological issues and they are compounded when he meets his fellow pilots Rei and Asuka. Evangelion is the story of Shinji, and his fight to save the world and find happiness.This is a very deep anime. You could watch it over and over, but still find a different meaning every time. The story is very heavy. The emotions of each characters are explored in depth. It's an older series, but the animation, voice acting, and music are all top notch. It is a near perfect series. My only beef with it is the final episode. The final episode is pretty much a psych evaluation of the main characters. When I first saw this series, I hated it b/c of the ending. Since then they have released ""Death and Rebirth"", and ""The End of Evangelion"". They wrap everything up very nicely. Evangelion is incredible and this is a great box set. You should check it out.

This new Platinum Collection of Neon Genesis Evangelion is a far more pratical solution to both buying the original box set, or buying each DVD separately. It's perfect for long-time fans of the show, or newbies who are worried about putting a lot of money down. (You're already saving well over $100 with this set.) And as someone who has limited shelf space, this thinpack takes up much less room.While a little short on some of the special features you'd expect from such a big name title, you're still getting your money's worth. Besides the series in full, there is also an extra disc with director's cut episodes. While Death and Rebirth and The End  of Evangelion are not included, this isn't much of a problem.The only warnings I would give would be to those who are new to the series. It's a popular anime, but there's a lot of violence, blood, religious themes, angst, dark themes; definately not for the faint of heart. However, there are also a lot of deep themes that the show touches on.

However, the quality of these episodes is very different from the episodes that ADV originally released, and not for the better. Pay no more attention to the advertising gimmick of the remastered video and jaw dropping 5.1 surround sound, because this is the first way that the series has been ruined in this format. All that has been changed is the sound effects are louder and at times the voices echo. On top of that, the 4 director's cut episodes have been redubbed, with a few characters voiced by completely different actors.The other problem with this item is that the pacing of nearly every episode has been changed. Where there were pauses in the older versions between dialogue, now there are none. The characters sound like they have been drinking too much coffee. Even though Ritsuko is bummed out in Episode 24, she is babbling like a baboon.  I suppose in order to fit 6 episodes on one disk, this must be done.Finally, there are no extras, none. The perfect collection which runs at about $130 contains character descriptions, Spanish and French language tracks, plenty more artwork on the covers and protect the discs much better than the flimsy, thin covers on these DVD's.

877061,A2TBWLOHTZNK54,B000767QTA,Reviewer,"[0, 3]","This is a review of the series and not any particular DVD release.I would say Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the best anime series of all time, with an admirable attention to the human character's emotions, in a surreal plot that will keep you gripped all the way through.The striking plot setup is that children have to be used to pilot war machines, and we see how these kid's lives are self destructing while they are surrounded by adults that are using them as tools of war. Everything is presented in a very ""real"" way, you feel the soundscapes and cultures of what's happening in any scene... you accept from the beginning that if it doesn't end in tragedy, there's much tragedy all along either way.The are only two things that bothered me about this series. One, is what the Japanese call fan service. It basically means characters are caught naked in front of other characters and get embarrassed. It's hard to say if this is suppose to be titillating, a gag, or both, but it's something that happens in some anime, and this one it happens a LOT, like once or multiple times per episode. It almosts always detracts when it does, since the story is realistic and it's hard to buy people ending up in these situations. However, these sequences are always brief so you'll get over it and learn to ignore it if it bothers you.The other thing is something that has been a lightning rod of fan criticism of the series, the ""ending"" of it as far as the episode run is concerned is a 100% cop out. It turns into basically an informal philosophy lecture, using the character's voices and mostly still shots. There's almost NOTHING related to the extremely detailed and realistic plots tied up here, other then a few vague references to what's happening that you have no reason to trust. It's basically an ending that takes place in the twilight zone, and you will be very agitated to experience such a rich story to end with all the richness ignored, and no resolutions. You have to watch a separate movie to see what you would expect of the series conclusion.That said this is one the altogether warmest, darkest, most interesting and most human animes ever.

The theme here is what if humanity doesn't WANT to reassimilate?  What if we strive to maintain our independent self?  Now, I knew this from university Philosophy classes, but NOWHERE was it explained in Evangelion.  This's an early Christian viewpoint actually, but it fails to provide a method of renewal of souls.  If all paths lead to the perfect whole, where do new humans and thus souls come from?  This's a flaw in the philosophy, it's not Evangelion's fault.Actually, there was a lot of stuff like this, such as subjective reality.  The old Greek cave is a good analogy.  If you are born in a cave facing the back wall and never turn around, soon the shadows on the back wall become your reality.  You're oblivious to the world in the other direction.  What they got TOTALLY WRONG here was the fact that just because your reality differs, the physical surroundings do NOT.  The universe will not cease to exist because you choose not to believe in it.  They make this false assumption in the last half of the series, and it's all downhill from there.  Again, hardcore philosophy that was NOT explained well in the series.Or even gotten right, for that matter.  Go right ahead.  Truly believe that the door isn't there in your new reality, then punch right where it was as hard as you can.  You will break your hand.  This is what philosophers call Truth.  We feel the door, we see the door, we can't unwill the concept of ""door"" from being.  So the door IS.  We can affect it in the framework of our reality (moving it, opening it, breaking it, etc.), but we cannot unmake it through will alone.*Spoiler*Further thing that irked me was all the thrown away characters.  Asuka's a perfect example.  A likable troubled cutie, she provides the needed counterpart and love interest for Shinji.  Yet in the end all past history goes out the window and she's relegated to lying alone in a hospital bed.  What the hell?!  Real people don't act like this!  While Shinji's busy professing his love for some alien GUY he just met, Asuka (who he spent WEEKS getting attached to and actually kissed) is lying alone in bed desperately needing someone to prove to her she's NOT unwanted and alone.  That's all!Was I the only one who saw the resolution of the series as totally unnecessary?  Over half the characters are constantly whining about how alone they are.  Yet when Asuka NEEDS them, they basically drug her up, strap her down, and tell her to take off.  Shinji does the same dang thing to Misato, though she deals with it better.  Lame to the max.  Totally unrealistic of what longterm human relationships are like.  I don't care how cold and removed you are.  Robots have more compassion and rational thought.News flash here, if someone you care about's lonely and YOU are lonely, all you have to do is go and be there for em.  Then, amazingly enough, you both aren't so alone anymore!  It's that classic ""free your mind, your a**'ll follow"" thing.  Evangelion totally skirts this simple solution, and in doing so it leaves a gaping hole that makes the end plot totally unlikely to EVER happen as we're supposed to believe it does.Series finale was executed weakly at best.  None of the aforementioned underpinning philosophies were adequately described.  What you're left with is a confusing, ridiculous montage that culminates in a lackluster conclusion to an otherwise great series.It almost seems to me that midseason they switched writers and hired a terminally depressed guy to write the script.  Better bust out your psychedelic drugs at the end, cuz that's about the only way the conclusion will be satisfying.  Heck, it may even make some remote semblance of sense, then.  ""By repeating what people have been saying to me over and over again, I suddenly come to grips with myself and make the whole universe bend to my whims!  No matter that I deserted my loved ones when they needed me most!""Yeah.  Right.  Pull the other one.  You'll notice the Greeks with their cave never said that the individual could alter the cave or the outside world in any way, merely the individual's PERCEPTION of that reality.  They at least understood that.Evangelion left me feeling confused and unsatisfied at its conclusion, which is sad because I LOVED the first and middle sections of the series.  The last half the characters become inhuman and unrational to extremes, and that killed it for me.  Classic case of ""the message"" ruining a perfectly good story.My fix for this?  Admit that the Truth of the universe is concrete.  Admit it can't be manipulated beyond the limits of our biology and the Truth of a human existence.  Have Kaji die WITH Misato rather than stupidly avoiding her.  Have Ritsuko date the good looking guitar playin' tech, the fact she's sleeping with someone her hated mother did is beyond the realm of belief.  Have Shinji actually GROW as a character.And for god's sake, have him walk in after defeating the 13th Angel and plant a scorcher on Asuka for some REAL dang resolution.To quote Myth Busters, ""I reject your reality, and substitute my own!""  Sorry, but as those guys prove time and again, we humans cannot do that.3/2/06Have recently watched all of RahXephon.  From my personal opinion, just skip Eva altogether and get that.  You'll end up depressed as hell after Eva, so unless you REALLY like mecha it's like punching yourself in the head.  You might as well just stop and feel better. RahXephon explained their underpinnings MUCH better, it looked better (the Mu are frickin awesome), had more likable characters, and the ending was pretty good resolution.  Let's face it, after 26 episodes you actually will want to see a closer that shows how it all winds up.  From a user friendly standpoint I feel Rah's got Eva beat in all aspects.  Eva may've done it first, but RahXephon did it right.",3,"Close, but no cigar.",1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,6086,"['was', 'interesting', 'concept', 'basically', 'playing', 'lot', 'obscure',

877070,A10U58PHFDK81C,B000767QTA,The Anime  Adict,"[2, 6]","Neon Genesis Evangelion or EVA is a series about three teenaged pilots working for the classified military agency with the duty of protecting humanity from destruction by a mysterious and powerful enemy. Now where I have heard this before oh yes in the two thousand other series with them same plot line, trust me this plot outside of the rough draft is anything but common.  What makes EVA different from the rest, it's actually good and different. Though with a somewhat save humanity from extinction at the hand of supposed aliens EVA uses Christian mythology to weave an actually interesting and fascinating plot out of something quiet mundane. Know you wondering why I'm going on and on about the plot, well EVA more then any thing is a plot driven series, a plot that will keep you guessing.Now then I've only seen the platinum edition which has been full remastered making the entire thing look and feel almost completely new. The art work after the remaster looks like it just got rolled off the press and looks really good. The voice acting is excellently done, some of the best I've heard. The music is first rate and as expected some of the best out there. The plot is interesting and twisting leaving wondering what is going to happen next.Now then for the flaws, yes I'm going to point out all of the flaws of one of the most beloved series of all time, that most people consider to be flawless. No I do not expect to live long.The biggest problem EVA suffers from is the near complete lack of character development. Aside from learning each character's past they never really change. This is especially irritating with Shinji, the main character. He's the same winy brat at the end of the series he was at the begining. If you're looking for character relationships, development and growth and the like EVA WILL let you down. The Series is about plot not characters. The second biggest problem is that everything and I mean everything has a double meaning for the plot and also a philosophical meaning. Which you most likely won't realize until the second to last episode. Third is that it almost requires you to have at least a passing knowledge of Christian and Hindu mythology and symbolism or you'll just find yourself lost and hating the series `cause you don't get it. This is not a series for the timid, the easily offended or the immature. There is gore, the most grotesque gore I have ever seen, some scenes to the point it will make you feel sick. There is plenty of fan fair and naughty jokes and nudity. Pretty much everything that would make a catholic priest condemn you for watching. What else is wrong with the series. The fact that until you have watched the entire series and the two movies twice you won't really know what the hell is going on. But most defiantly is the ending it leave you hanging in the air. The last two episodes is nothing more then the director ranting about philosophy and has little if anything to do with the series's story line. You can skip them or if you're like me who loves philosophy will watch them over and over again. Even with all these flaws the series is still perfect mix just not when you break it down into bits.Let's review the review, plot is above average, characters are above average, character development is nil, mech fights are interesting if some times boring, art work is dated, music is excellent, is one of the darkest and complex series out there, will give granny a heart attack and last the philosophy is the best you will ever find anywhere. In short if you are not easily offended, have an open mind, like series that require your absolute attention every second and like an interesting thought provoking stuff dark story. Then this is right up your alley. All this aside it is nearly impossible for me to too highly recommend buying this series especially this edition.",5,A Perfect Series Final with Perfect Edition,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,3860,"['Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'EVA', 'series', 'three', 'teenaged', 'pilots', 'working', 'classified', 'military', 'agency', 'duty', 'protecting', 'humanity', 'destruction', 'mysterious', 'powerful', 'enemy', 'Now', 'where', 'have', 'heard', 'oh', 'yes', 'two', 'thousand', 'other', 'series', 'same', 'plot', 'line', 'trust', 'plot', 'rough', 'draft', 'anything', 'common', 'What', 'EVA', 'different', 'rest', 'actually', 'good', 'different', 'somewhat', 'save', 'humanity', 'extinction', 'hand', 'supposed', 'aliens', 'EVA', 'Christian', 'mythology', 'weave', 'actually', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'plot', 'something', 'quiet', 'mundane', 'Know', 'wondering', 'why', ""'m"", 'going', 'plot', 'well', 'EVA', 'more', 'then', 'thing', 'plot', 'driven', 'series', 'plot', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing.Now', 'then', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'platinum', 'edition', 'been', 'full', 'remastered', 'making', 'entire', 'thing', 'look', 'feel', 'almost', 'completely', 'new', 'art', 'work', 'remaster', 'just', 'got', 'rolled', 'off', 'press', 'really', 'good', 'voice', 'acting', 'excellently', 'done', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'music', 'first', 'rate', 'expected', 'best', 'there', 'plot', 'interesting', 'twisting', 'leaving', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next.Now', 'then', 'flaws', 'yes', ""'m"", 'going', 'point', 'out', 'flaws', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'series', 'time', 'most', 'people', 'consider', 'be', 'flawless', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'live', 'long.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'EVA', 'suffers', 'near', 'complete', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'Aside', 'learning', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'change', 'especially', 'irritating', 'Shinji', 'main', 'character', 'same', 'winy', 'brat', 'end', 'series', 'was', 'begining', ""'re"", 'looking', 'character', 'relationships', 'development', 'growth', 'like', 'EVA', 'WILL', 'let', 'down', 'Series', 'plot', 'not', 'characters', 'second', 'biggest', 'problem', 'everything', 'mean', 'everything', 'double', 'meaning', 'plot', 'also', 'philosophical', 'meaning', 'Which', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'realize', 'second', 'last', 'episode', 'Third', 'almost', 'have', 'least', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'Christian', 'Hindu', 'mythology', 'symbolism', ""'ll"", 'just', 'find', 'lost', 'hating', 'series', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'not', 'series', 'timid', 'easily', 'offended', 'immature', 'gore', 'most', 'grotesque', 'gore', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'scenes', 'point', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'sick', 'plenty', 'fan', 'fair', 'naughty', 'jokes', 'nudity', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'would', 'make', 'catholic', 'priest', 'condemn', 'watching', 'What', 'else', 'wrong', 'series', 'fact', 'have', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'two', 'movies', 'twice', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'most', 'defiantly', 'ending', 'leave', 'hanging', 'air', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'director', 'ranting', 'philosophy', 'little', 'anything', 'do', 'series', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'skip', ""'re"", 'who', 'philosophy', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'Even', 'flaws', 'series', 'still', 'perfect', 'mix', 'just', 'not', 'when', 'break', 'down', 'bits.Let', 'review', 'review', 'plot', 'above', 'average', 'characters', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'character', 'development', 'nil', 'mech', 'fights', 'are', 'interesting', 'times', 'boring', 'art', 'work', 'dated', 'music', 'excellent', 'one', 'darkest', 'complex', 'series', 'there', 'will', 'give', 'granny', 'heart', 'attack', 'last', 'philosophy', 'best', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'anywhere', 'short', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'series', 'absolute', 'attention', 'second', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'stuff', 'dark', 'story', 'Then', 'right', 'alley', 'aside', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'too', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'series', 'especially', 'edition']",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection
877071,A2O0LFHVG8D4Z7,B000767QTA,Thomas,"[1, 7]","**WARNING! Spoilers are ahead! I recommend you skip this review until you've seen the series. Don't say I didn't warn you!**First off, I have to give this anime credit, as it was able to suck me in and make me interested during the beginning; something animes sometimes have trouble doing. I continued to be intrigued up through the first half. The characters were quirky and interesting, and the fights with the angels were fun (including one battle where Shinji and Asuka danced one to death), though most of the angels seemed lazy and uninspired (one of them is literally a floating sphere. Real intimidating...). After the first half is where things started to crumble. Characters changed dramatically, stripping them of everything that made them likeable. Shinji turned into a praise-hungry brat, Asuka into a scared little child, Misato into a whiny crybaby. They even tack on an overly dramatic back story for Asuka that honestly isn't necessary.For those of you who don't know (although you probably do), Evangelion is heralded as one of the all-time greatest classics of anime history. The hype is the reason I watched it in the first place. And honestly, I'm extremely disappointed. What I found here wasn't bad by any means, but I don't think it's deserving of all the hype it got. The setup is good, the characters are good (in the beginning), and it's even got a great theme song (although it's no ""You Get to Burning""), but the good things fall apart near the end. You have all these loose ends that you expect to be tied up in the last two episodes, and they waste the time by putting the characters in a fantasy setting where they attend school together, among other things, not to mention that the final ending is like the director flipping you the bird. Nothing is resolved. Also, I swear this anime was written for immature preteens. The opening contains nude silhouettes of the female characters in provocative poses (although I know it can be common-place in anime), and some of the dialogue is just silly. There's an awkward scene where Misato and her boyfriend are making love and she says (actual quote): ""No, don't put strange objects in THAT!"". The show also tackles yaoi themes. I have no problem with this, but Shinji and the love interest share only about three scenes together, and Shinji admits to loving him. This is more like a Disney Princess love than anything else (think like in Enchanted, when not three minutes after the prince meets Giselle, he announces that he is going to marry her). This anime isn't bad, but I wouldn't call it great, and I don't think it warrants a second viewing from me. Now, for a REAL anime masterpiece (in my opinion), I suggest checking out Metropolis, anything Studio Ghibli, Bubblegum Crisis, Akira, Read or Die (the OVA and TV series), etc.Now, about some other things.

Despite the few light-hearted moments, the overall story is very dense, very emotional, and sometimes, very disturbing and requires a lot of mental processing.  The occasional multiple-stream subtitles makes it even harder to understand.  But at least you can understand the first 24 episodes. If not, try to watch the director's cut in the last disc - they make more sense than the standard episodes.  But WTFs with episodes 25 and 26?

877073,A2V54GHPYD3VI2,B000767QTA,"T. Marcroft ""tmar""","[2, 4]","The main critiques I seem to notice are ""Shinji is whiny,"" ""same message,"" and ""wth happened at the end of the series."" I think I agree with the director in saying if you've never experienced desperation, detachedness, other feelings associated with existentialism, and basically all those growing up, you probably won't find anything at all in it, or anything useful. I watched some of this a REALLY long time ago (middle school)... for the most part completely went over my head. I only got the giant robots bit which is the first ""layer"" of understanding. Watched again second year of college, but while doing homework so I didn't catch many of the nuances of the plot. I would read later on a site some plot points which I did not even pick up on... I watched it again recently and got SO much more this time around.The whole focus of Evangelion, I would think (this is my interpretation of it, don't bash me if it's different than yours >&lt;), is on the varying degrees of connectedness between the characters and the quality/number of those connections... more so than ""robots"" (YES I know they're not), religion, and monsters. It's sort of ironic how all these dysfunctional characters are supposed to be the representatives and saviors of humanity. I think this fits in nicely with the synchro rate, because as I see it, the synchro rate is a measure of the connectedness of the soul in the Eva with the pilot... it would explain Shinji's high synchro and Asuka's falling synchro. This strong connection Shinji has with the soul in EVA 01 was the reason why, I think, 01 was so important (versus 00 or 02)... it was a good representation of the connectedness/relationships between people that could be used to save humanity. It's supposed to be ""our"" unique thing that can help us survive (in the sense that it makes humans worth keeping alive) unlike the singular angels/Adam. This is supposed to be ironic because Shinji is terrible at connecting with everyone else.I also think the characters are grappling with identity, as shown by the identification of who they are ""in relation"" to everyone else (in the series I think that was exemplified by the adding ""rules/restrictions"" like gravity and ground to define who you are...).So, before I go on some weird tangent with my analysis, a short review. See it for the relationships. Has cool action sequences as well but that's an aside. Great characters, somewhat confusing but engrossing plot (I am not sure if he meant to give so few hints as to what happening or not), very existential, if you like that sort of thing. It's somewhat along the lines of The Stranger (L'etranger), if you've read that. I think some of the fan service is actually a part of the story as the main character IS a preteen and preteens DO go through puberty. It's a part of life. While it seems like it may be for teens (I think the director geared it that way, what with the few silly situations) I don't think you can have a good appreciation of it, and a good handle of the philosophy and story until you're older. I think this was a mistake of the director as children (yes... I think as preteen I should have been called a child) wouldn't possibly be able to understand some of the other things going on besides battles.(By the way, Shinji cries because he IS a weak character. But I also think it shows a certain weakness to deride others because they are weak. While I know this is just a character it's very disrespectful. I'm a girl and I love strong characters too as I'm fiercely independent, but saying someone is a ""wuss"" when they have emotional problems is a low blow.)",5,Great Series!,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,3624,"['main', 'critiques', 'seem', 'notice', 'are', 'Shinji', 'whiny', 'same', 'message', 'wth', 'happened', 'end', 'series', 'think', 'agree', 'director', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'desperation', 'detachedness', 'other', 'feelings', 'associated', 'existentialism', 'basically', 'growing', 'up', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'anything', 'useful', 'watched', 'REALLY', 'long', 'time', 'middle', 'school', 'most', 'part', 'completely', 'went', 'head', 'only', 'got', 'giant', 'robots', 'bit', 'first', 'layer', 'understanding', 'Watched', 'again', 'second', 'year', 'college', 'doing', 'homework', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'many', 'nuances', 'plot', 'would', 'read', 'later', 'site', 'plot', 'points', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'pick', 'up', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'got', 'SO', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'around.The', 'whole', 'focus', 'Evangelion', 'would', 'think', 'interpretation', 'do', ""n't"", 'bash', 'different', 'yours', '>', 'lt', 'varying', 'degrees', 'connectedness', 'characters', 'quality/number', 'connections', 'more', 'so', 'robots', 'YES', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'religion', 'monsters', 'sort', 'ironic', 'how', 'dysfunctional', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'representatives', 'saviors', 'humanity', 'think', 'nicely', 'synchro', 'rate', 'see', 'synchro', 'rate', 'measure', 'connectedness', 'soul', 'Eva', 'pilot', 'would', 'explain', 'Shinji', 'high', 'synchro', 'Asuka', 'falling', 'synchro', 'strong', 'connection', 'Shinji', 'soul', 'EVA', '01', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'think', '01', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'versus', '00', '02', 'was', 'good', 'representation', 'connectedness/relationships', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'save', 'humanity', 'supposed', 'be', 'unique', 'thing', 'can', 'help', 'survive', 'sense', 'humans', 'worth', 'keeping', 'alive', 'singular', 'angels/Adam', 'supposed', 'be', 'ironic', 'Shinji', 'terrible', 'connecting', 'everyone', 'else.I', 'also', 'think', 'characters', 'are', 'grappling', 'identity', 'shown', 'identification', 'who', 'are', 'relation', 'everyone', 'else', 'series', 'think', 'was', 'exemplified', 'adding', 'rules/restrictions', 'gravity', 'ground', 'define', 'who', 'are', '.So', 'go', 'weird', 'tangent', 'analysis', 'short', 'review', 'See', 'relationships', 'Has', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'as', 'well', 'aside', 'Great', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'engrossing', 'plot', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'meant', 'give', 'so', 'few', 'hints', 'what', 'happening', 'not', 'very', 'existential', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'somewhat', 'lines', 'Stranger', ""L'etranger"", ""'ve"", 'read', 'think', 'fan', 'service', 'actually', 'part', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'preteen', 'preteens', 'DO', 'go', 'puberty', 'part', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'teens', 'think', 'director', 'geared', 'way', 'what', 'few', 'silly', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'appreciation', 'good', 'handle', 'philosophy', 'story', ""'re"", 'older', 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'director', 'children', 'yes', 'think', 'preteen', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'child', 'would', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'other', 'things', 'going', 'battles', 'way', 'Shinji', 'cries', 'weak', 'character', 'also', 'think', 'certain', 'weakness', 'deride', 'others', 'are', 'weak', 'know', 'just', 'character', 'very', 'disrespectful', ""'m"", 'girl', 'love', 'strong', 'characters', 'too', ""'m"", 'fiercely', 'independent', 'saying', 'someone', 'wuss', 'when', 'have', 'emotional', 'problems', 'low', 'blow']",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection

Nerv's mission is to destroy all the Angels to prevent a Third Impact. On the darker side of the plot, Shinji has his own personal conflicts in life. He is unloved by his father, who appears to be using him only as a tool for his own purposes. All the characters in this story have deep and dark pasts of their own - and at the end they seem to be intertwined with each other's psychological tragedies.I'm usually the type to go for dark stories, but NGE is just too dull. The first half of the anime is angel attack after angel attack...is that all this is going to be about? Each episode acts like ""we are all going to die"" and of course, through some miracle, they are always saved. After awhile, it just makes the story drag on. It didn't start getting good until Episode 18 when it started to really delve into the psychologies and pasts of the main characters. I was let down again in the last two episodes when everyone's inner-selves were put to the test - it just kept going on and on. In the last ten minutes of it, I didn't even understand what was going on, it was so mixed up.Overall, I think this anime is definitely worth a try since I know the majority of people like it. Unfortunately, I was part of the minority. I had to admit though, the graphics were impressive and I did like the characters, just not so much the plot. The music really irritated me but I really enjoyed the Japanese voice cast.
