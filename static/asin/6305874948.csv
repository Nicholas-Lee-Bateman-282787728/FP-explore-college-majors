481828,A1AHFIGBYPZTXC,6305874948,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","I don't like sports movies. I rarely see them and even more rarely enjoy them. I liken them to those insipid films like Backdraft or Days of Thunder - &quot;revealing the gritty reality of ____ (fill in your favorite hazardous career).&quot; Of the few sports films I did enjoy, Ron Shelton made Bull Durham and White Men Can't Jump. Luckily though, this is not a sports film at all. It's really about a road trip. Maybe that's where he went wrong this time.Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas) and Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson) are washed up boxers given the opportunity to open for a Mike Tyson fight in Vegas. They have 6 hours or so to get there from LA and the winner gets a shot at the middle weight title. They snatch up Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich) and head off across the desert mountains to beat each other senseless. This is the entirety of the plot.Even given this paltry reason for existence, Banderas and Harrelson are almost able to make something interesting out of this film. Banderas especially does an excellent job with what he's given, considering that his only task is to argue with Harrelson. And Shelton's confusion over where this film should be driving tends to leave the audience hemmed in along with the actors. Add to this the fact that both men are in love with Davidovich's noncommital Grace and that she may or may not be in love with one or more of them and it's no wonder the audience may feel more than a little confused as well.Even the climactic fight scene, however well choreagraphed, doesn't have the cahones required to make this story into the film that you can sense is lying in wait just behind this one - a film in which the disregard for political correctness does more than make low-blow jokes.What Play it to the Bone needs is someone like the Coen brothers who can see it for what it is and take advantage of it's strengths (namely the cast) and wouldn't hinder it with feel good sapiness. Shelton's made a good pitch for the film that he should have made.

The premise seemed like fun, Woody and Antonio were interesting. But then, the movie falls flat on its face.

Vince and  Cesar are friends that are going to fight each other publically for the  first time.The premise was workable and the actors were talented enough  to pull it off. Lolita Davidovich and Lucy Liu, are also solid - you just  wonder why they would take roles so beneath them.The plot and the  directing needed a lot of work.

No resolution, no lesson's learned, nothing.  The  movie chooses to not take risks, not make any decisions. To polish it off,  the DVD is bereft of any special features worth noting.

481836,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305874948,"""flickjunkie""","[8, 9]","`Play It To The Bone' is really two movies.  One is a movie about boxing and the other is a comedic character study of the boxers.  As a boxing film, it succeeds nicely.  As a comedy it has its moments.  As a character  study, it hits the canvas hard.The storyline was sort of `Rocky' times  two.  Two washed up middleweight boxers Vince and Cesar (Woody Harrelson  and Antonio Banderas), who are also best friends, get a last minute chance  to fight in Las Vegas on the undercard of a Mike Tyson heavyweight bout  when the two scheduled fighters are unable to fight.  They are promised  that the winner will get a chance to fight for the championship, but they  have to be in Las Vegas tonight.  The trouble is, they have to fight each  other.So they climb into a car with Cesar's girlfriend (and Vince's  ex-girlfriend) Grace (Lolita Davidovich) and drive from L.A. to Las Vegas.  Most of the rest of the movie is about the drive followed by the  fight.Director Ron Shelton has had quite a few sports oriented success  stories to his credit (Bull Durham, White Men Can't Jump and Tin Cup).  The  best part of the film was the boxing.  The boxing was well choreographed  and both actors were athletic and fought like real boxers.  Shelton was  also excellent at creating the feel of a boxing match.  Anyone who has ever  watched an HBO bout will recognize ring announcers Jim Lampley, Larry  Merchant and George Foreman.  Mike Tyson made a cameo as well as numerous  celebrity boxing fans (Kevin Costner, Rod Stewart, Wesley Snipes and a host  of others).  The makeup for the cuts and puffiness was also very  realistic.Unfortunately, the rest of the film was not as good as the  fight.  Shelton spends a good deal of time developing the characters, but  it is all for naught because they have no substance.  They are two hapless  jocks, obvious mental lightweights, who spend most of the trip to Las Vegas  fighting over Grace, cutting up and strutting around like peacocks.  Shelton takes great pains to try to make us love these characters equally  by making them equally pathetic.  But that doesn't work because it leaves  the audience without anyone to pull for in the fight.  The ending is  utterly predictable and the film whimpers off into the sunset with no more  than a stagger.Banderas and Harrelson both gave journeyman performances.  They had good chemistry and some decent comedy between them, but there was  nothing special here.  The best performance by far was by Davidovich who  transcended her normal sex kitten role and took command of the entire film  with a character that was a manipulative vixen.  She was smart, tough and  sexy, and dominated every scene.  Once again, she shows that she is  talented as well as attractive, which makes me wonder why she has never  gotten roles that are more substantial.This is a tough one to rate  because it does some things very well and other things poorly.  I gave it a  6/10.  It had some good comedic moments, but not enough of them.  It had  some excellent boxing scenes, but a disappointing outcome.  In addition,  the character study simply failed due to vacant characters.  If you like  boxing, Harrelson, Banderas or especially Davidovich, you will enjoy this  film.  Otherwise, enter at your own risk.",3,"Good boxing, weak characters",963187200,"07 10, 2000",2000,3274,"['Play', 'Bone', 'really', 'two', 'movies', 'One', 'movie', 'boxing', 'other', 'comedic', 'character', 'study', 'boxers', 'boxing', 'film', 'nicely', 'comedy', 'moments', 'character', 'study', 'canvas', 'hard.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'sort', 'Rocky', 'times', 'two', 'Two', 'washed', 'up', 'middleweight', 'boxers', 'Vince', 'Cesar', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'best', 'friends', 'get', 'last', 'minute', 'chance', 'fight', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'undercard', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'heavyweight', 'bout', 'when', 'two', 'scheduled', 'fighters', 'are', 'unable', 'fight', 'are', 'promised', 'winner', 'will', 'get', 'chance', 'fight', 'championship', 'have', 'be', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'tonight', 'trouble', 'have', 'fight', 'other.So', 'climb', 'car', 'Cesar', 'girlfriend', 'Vince', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'drive', 'L.A.', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Most', 'rest', 'movie', 'drive', 'followed', 'fight.Director', 'Ron', 'Shelton', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'sports', 'oriented', 'success', 'stories', 'credit', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'White', 'Men', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Jump', 'Tin', 'Cup', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'boxing', 'boxing', 'was', 'well', 'choreographed', 'actors', 'were', 'athletic', 'fought', 'like', 'real', 'boxers', 'Shelton', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'creating', 'feel', 'boxing', 'match', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'watched', 'HBO', 'bout', 'will', 'recognize', 'ring', 'announcers', 'Jim', 'Lampley', 'Larry', 'Merchant', 'George', 'Foreman', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'made', 'cameo', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'celebrity', 'boxing', 'fans', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'host', 'others', 'makeup', 'cuts', 'puffiness', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'realistic.Unfortunately', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'fight', 'Shelton', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'naught', 'have', 'substance', 'are', 'two', 'hapless', 'jocks', 'obvious', 'mental', 'lightweights', 'who', 'spend', 'most', 'trip', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'fighting', 'Grace', 'cutting', 'up', 'strutting', 'peacocks', 'Shelton', 'great', 'pains', 'try', 'make', 'love', 'characters', 'equally', 'making', 'equally', 'pathetic', ""n't"", 'work', 'audience', 'anyone', 'pull', 'fight', 'ending', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'film', 'whimpers', 'off', 'sunset', 'more', 'stagger.Banderas', 'Harrelson', 'gave', 'journeyman', 'performances', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'decent', 'comedy', 'was', 'nothing', 'special', 'here', 'best', 'performance', 'far', 'was', 'Davidovich', 'who', 'transcended', 'normal', 'sex', 'kitten', 'role', 'took', 'command', 'entire', 'film', 'character', 'was', 'manipulative', 'vixen', 'was', 'smart', 'tough', 'sexy', 'dominated', 'scene', 'Once', 'again', 'talented', 'as', 'well', 'attractive', 'wonder', 'why', 'never', 'gotten', 'roles', 'are', 'more', 'substantial.This', 'tough', 'one', 'rate', 'things', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'things', 'poorly', 'gave', '6/10', 'had', 'good', 'comedic', 'moments', 'not', 'enough', 'had', 'excellent', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'disappointing', 'outcome', 'addition', 'character', 'study', 'simply', 'failed', 'due', 'vacant', 'characters', 'like', 'boxing', 'Harrelson', 'Banderas', 'especially', 'Davidovich', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'enter', 'own', 'risk']",Play it to the Bone

Much of this &quot;complexity&quot; comes from the  characters they rub elbows with, and the situations they find themselves  in.Play it to the Bone has similar losers--a couple of boxers who had  shots at a title, and blew it, and are given a second chance.Unbelievably, two fighters who were to open for a Tyson bout in Vegas  are disabled, one killed in a car wreck, and one OD'd, hours before the  fight.Tom Sizemore's character, a fat, sleazy promoter, enlists our  heroes, played by Harrelson and Banderas, to fight one another.  Together,  with Lolita Davidovich, they drive to Vegas.  Hi jinx ensue.Harrelson's  character sees Jesus.  Jesus appears to him behind a cheap restaurant,  during fights...it could be funny, but it isn't.  They pick up a  hitchhiker, ultra-yummy Lucy Liu, just long enough to kill some movie time  that apparently they couldn't think of another, clever way to fill--time  passed by Woody having sex with her behind a gas station. It's a little  funny, but not much.I guess what dissatisfies me about this movie is  that the sum isn't greater than its parts.  One thing happens after  another, without adding up to anything in particular.  There is not even a  sense of denouement at the end, because we know with a fair certainty how  the Big Fight will end.

The cinematography is alright. It features name actors and what appears to be a budget. Compared to some of the dreck I've waddled through over the years, ""Play it to the Bone"" at least meets some bare minimum threshold to qualify as a movie, and that's more than I can say for, say, ""Burial Ground"" or ""Challenge of the Lady Ninja.""On the other hand, I can't think of any other movie that actually aspires to be good and fails so completely as this one. If a b-movie aspires to be an hour and a half of trashy entertainment, provided it doesn't bore me I'm more than willing to sit through plot gaps, eye-rolling dialogue, technical incompetence, etc. When a movie features Woody Harrelson and Antonio Bandares - not to mention a budget - I expect ... I don't know - a plot? Characters I care about? A laugh or two? Something?I'm not going to bother to rehash what little plot you'll find in ""Play it to the Bone."" Just trust me on this on: About a half hour in, the movie turns into the most anoying and uneventful buddy flick you've ever seen. Neither of the main characters ever springs to life, which is even more incredible when you consider that Harrelson and Bandares seem to have some charisma. Absolutely nothing at all happens except for some ""wacky hijinks"" along the way that won't even make you smile.
