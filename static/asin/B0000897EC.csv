The dual story of Daniel Deronda searching for his identity and the spoiled Lady Gwendolyn who enters a loveless marriage with a wealthy brute to avoid being a governess is riveting. The acting is excellent, the costumes and scenery likewise and the story has a very unusual twist for a Victorian novel.Eliot was far ahead of her time in depicting Jewish characters, not only without a trace of anti-Semitism or condescension but with deep understanding of their national aspirations just beginning to be born.We are a million miles from Jane Austen-land in the author's understanding of the political currents roiling Britain and the world -- and in her sympathetic depiction of outsiders trying to find a place in Victorian society. She is highly aware of the closeted and closed world of women compared to men. She paints a picture of a miserable wife, physically and mentally abused, who is no more than her husband's chattel. The parallel plights of women and the plight of Jews as outsiders can only be overcome by mutual self-liberation.This is a very interesting drama which can be enjoyed on many levels.",5,Splendid costume drama,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,1213,"['veteran', 'viewer', 'countless', 'costume', 'dramas', 'BBC', 'can', 'attest', 'one', 'best', 'dual', 'story', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'searching', 'identity', 'spoiled', 'Lady', 'Gwendolyn', 'who', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'wealthy', 'brute', 'avoid', 'being', 'governess', 'riveting', 'acting', 'excellent', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'likewise', 'story', 'very', 'unusual', 'twist', 'Victorian', 'novel.Eliot', 'was', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'depicting', 'Jewish', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'trace', 'anti-Semitism', 'condescension', 'deep', 'understanding', 'national', 'aspirations', 'just', 'beginning', 'be', 'born.We', 'are', 'million', 'miles', 'Jane', 'Austen-land', 'author', 'understanding', 'political', 'currents', 'roiling', 'Britain', 'world', 'sympathetic', 'depiction', 'outsiders', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'Victorian', 'society', 'highly', 'aware', 'closeted', 'closed', 'world', 'women', 'compared', 'men', 'picture', 'miserable', 'wife', 'physically', 'mentally', 'abused', 'who', 'more', 'husband', 'chattel', 'parallel', 'plights', 'women', 'plight', 'Jews', 'outsiders', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'overcome', 'mutual', 'self-liberation.This', 'very', 'interesting', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'levels']",N/A

736441,AB34G6VKP28L,B0000897EC,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[193, 199]","Having a familiarity with the field of psychology, I have always found morality plays fascinating. If you delight in thought-provoking films with careful layers of morality and virtue, Daniel Deronda will be just your cup of tea. In addition to being a magnificent piece from a purely artistic perspective (the gowns, horse-drawn carriages, and exquisite English countryside will stir the hearts of even the most ardent modernist), it also offers a magnitude of ideal conversation starters.The miniseries is based on the classic novel by George Eliot, and is essentially two plots woven into one. The first is an utterly heartless and wretched marriage for a spoiled young Gwendolyn in the form of the evil Grandcourt, a landowner whose sole pleasure lies in torment. Be it his wife or dogs, our heartless villain never takes greater pleasure than in dangling something before them and tearing it away again, only to feed it to someone else. We see a kind of barbarism in this act, be it with the family spaniel or his impoverished, abandoned mistress.The second plot line is about the film's lead, Daniel Deronda, a presumed illigitimate boy who has been raised a country gentleman. One day while out boating he saves a Jewish singer from drowning herself, and sets out to discover his own true identity through finding her family.The acting is very stellar. There's not a weak link in the cast, although I have to say seeing Barbara Hershey seemed a little out of place in this Victorian paradox. The film makes numerous contrasts between good and evil, selfishness and humility, lies and deception. It's actually quite an achievement, and I was pleased at the amount of restraint showed by the filmmakers. The sexual tension between man and wife will go over most younger viewer's heads. From rationalizing and defending one's wrong choices to showing the difference between attraction and subtle, strong love, Daniel Deronda is a gem not merely for its beauty but also its hideousness.Filmmakers have done a tasteful film which deals with many heavy subjects without becoming vulgar or crass. The costuming is absolutely gorgeous, and there's not a weak link in the cast, which includes screen knowns such as Barbara Hershey and Gretta Sacci, as well as the exceptionally talented Hugh Dancy, Romola Garai, Hugh Bonneville and Jodhi May. Fans of other period films will recognize actors from Pride & Prejudice, Persuasion, and Emma.It's rare to find a wonderful Victorian bodice ripper where the bodice actually stays on.",4,"""That's not what this is about, Lush.""",1050710400,"04 19, 2003",2003,2525,"['Having', 'familiarity', 'field', 'psychology', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'morality', 'fascinating', 'delight', 'thought-provoking', 'films', 'careful', 'layers', 'morality', 'virtue', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'cup', 'tea', 'addition', 'being', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'purely', 'artistic', 'perspective', 'gowns', 'horse-drawn', 'carriages', 'exquisite', 'English', 'countryside', 'will', 'stir', 'hearts', 'even', 'most', 'ardent', 'modernist', 'also', 'magnitude', 'ideal', 'conversation', 'starters.The', 'miniseries', 'based', 'classic', 'novel', 'George', 'Eliot', 'essentially', 'two', 'plots', 'woven', 'one', 'first', 'utterly', 'heartless', 'wretched', 'marriage', 'spoiled', 'young', 'Gwendolyn', 'form', 'evil', 'Grandcourt', 'landowner', 'sole', 'pleasure', 'torment', 'Be', 'wife', 'dogs', 'heartless', 'villain', 'never', 'greater', 'pleasure', 'dangling', 'something', 'tearing', 'away', 'again', 'only', 'feed', 'someone', 'else', 'see', 'kind', 'barbarism', 'act', 'be', 'family', 'spaniel', 'impoverished', 'abandoned', 'mistress.The', 'second', 'plot', 'line', 'film', 'lead', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'presumed', 'illigitimate', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'country', 'gentleman', 'One', 'day', 'out', 'boating', 'Jewish', 'singer', 'drowning', 'out', 'discover', 'own', 'true', 'identity', 'finding', 'family.The', 'acting', 'very', 'stellar', 'not', 'weak', 'link', 'cast', 'have', 'say', 'seeing', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'seemed', 'little', 'place', 'Victorian', 'paradox', 'film', 'numerous', 'contrasts', 'good', 'evil', 'selfishness', 'humility', 'deception', 'actually', 'quite', 'achievement', 'was', 'pleased', 'amount', 'restraint', 'showed', 'filmmakers', 'sexual', 'tension', 'man', 'wife', 'will', 'go', 'most', 'younger', 'viewer', 'heads', 'rationalizing', 'defending', 'one', 'wrong', 'choices', 'showing', 'difference', 'attraction', 'subtle', 'strong', 'love', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'gem', 'not', 'merely', 'beauty', 'also', 'hideousness.Filmmakers', 'have', 'done', 'tasteful', 'film', 'many', 'heavy', 'subjects', 'becoming', 'vulgar', 'crass', 'costuming', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'not', 'weak', 'link', 'cast', 'screen', 'knowns', 'such', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Gretta', 'Sacci', 'as', 'well', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'Fans', 'other', 'period', 'films', 'will', 'recognize', 'actors', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Persuasion', 'Emma.It', 'rare', 'find', 'wonderful', 'Victorian', 'bodice', 'ripper', 'where', 'bodice', 'actually']",N/A

736446,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B0000897EC,CoffeeGurl,"[10, 10]","Once again, I have enjoyed a beautiful BBC period drama based on a classic novel.  George Eliot's Daniel Deronda tells the story of Daniel (Hugh Dancy), an honorable young man who believes himself to be the illegitimate son of an aristocrat.  Sparks fly between him and the beautiful, adventurous and spirited gambler Gwendolen Harleth (Ramola Garai) when he gives her back the turquoise jewelry she forced herself to sell in order to cover her gambling expenses.  Attraction ensues between them, but things get in the way.  In an effort to save her family from poverty and keep herself from turning into a governess, Gwen marries the controlling, cold-hearted Henleigh Grandcourt (Hugh Bonneville)  in spite of knowing about his horrid treatment of his mistress and illegitimate children.  Her marriage is a horrible one, for Grandcourt is determined to break her spirit. And Daniel Deronda's life isn't the same when he rescues a young Jewess (Jodhi May) from a suicide attempt.  As he searches for the girl's family, he is forced to learn things about his own parentage and experiences self-discovery.This production, like all BBC productions I've seen, is gorgeous in every possible way.  The costumes, the setting, scenery and acting are top notch.  The backdrop of London society and the Jewish community in England during the mid 1870s are quite insightful.  This miniseries centers more on the characters and their route to discover themselves more than anything else, which is quite refreshing. I knew I was into something wonderful when I noticed that Andrew Davies (Pride and Prejudice '95, Wives and Daughters, Bridget Jones's Diary) had adapted this story.  The acting is also great.  Hugh Bonneville stands out the most as the villain.  There were times that he didn't have to say a word to convey his hateful presence.  I am impressed with this actor.  He had a small role in the movie Notting Hill and I had no idea how talented he was until now.  The dark and handsome Hugh Dancy is also great as Daniel Deronda and Ramola Garai brought Gwendolen to life in more ways than one.  She gave the bratty, selfish heroine much depth and complexity.  She is also quite a beautiful actress who kind of reminded me of Cameron Diaz.  As for the story, I enjoyed it very much, but I don't like the ending.  I began to read the novel years ago but never finished it, so I have no idea how the novel ends, but the series ending left a lot to be desired simply because I felt there was more chemistry between Daniel and the third part of the love triangle than with the one he supposedly loved.  I felt no spark between them and they seemed more like friends than anything else. So their ending up together caught me by surprise.  Alas, I nevertheless enjoyed this wonderful period piece.

736447,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,B0000897EC,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[2, 4]","""Daniel Deronda"" (1996)is based, course, on the novel be George Eliot (who, one might argue, looks better on the screen than on the page), and the inimitable Andrew Davies--known for his adaptations of Jane Austen and other classic English novels--did it again with a compelling narrative script. Tom Hooper directed, and fresh faces were in the 2007 DVD edition of a BBC 1996 production.  Time flies, for I could remember the face of Romola Garai from her more recent appearance in ""Vanity Fair,"" where Reese Witherspoon took the honors.  Garai also appeared in a latter-day version of ""Dirty Dancing,"" but, overall, she seemed an ignored actress in the big screen despite her enchanting--and a bit exotic--looks and her air of an innocent sensuality.Here, of course, she plays Gwendolen Harleth, daughter of an impoverished family, who marries the tyrannical aristocrat Henleigh Grandcourt, played by Hugh Boneville, whom you might remember from his role as Rushworth, the idiotic rich man who marries the disloyal Maria Bertram in ""Mansfield Park"" (1998). Bonneville is brilliant as the monstrous villain whose aristocratic manners and sneering sangfroid are a mask which hides a vicious psychopath whose insane jealousy prompts him to marry a beautiful, impoverished woman, out of vengeance and hostility to the fair sex, a cad who needs to assure himself that he can ""master"" a beautiful wife, or anyone else who stands on his path. Bonneville is an electrifying presence of the screen, evil incarnate, wearing the mask of nobility without being noble, elegant and vicious, caressing his wife's cheek with calculated menace of gesture, assured of victory and inglorious in defeat.But the lengthy movie (a TV mini-series of three and a half hours) is supposed to be about Daniel Deronda himself, a troubled character in search of identity and commendable wish to explore life before he settles into marriage or a profession, as his aristocratic father desires. Deronda is given sensitively and with quiet intensity by Hugh Dancy, an actor who is at home with both costume dramas and action movies (""Black Hawk Down""). The plot follows the fortunes of these two major characters--Gwendolen and Deronda--who are evidently attracted to each but who fall in love but head in different directions and cannot unite. Deronda is an ambiguous character, worthy of being in a Henry James novel, or even in a late twentieth century one: he is is the illegitimate son of an aristocrat (played by Edward Fox), who had an affair with a  Jewish singer many years before, and thence, as Deronda becomes conscious of his past, he decides to track his mother down.  In the mean time he has saved the life of a young Jewish woman when she attempts to drown, and gradually falls in love with her.  He ends up discovering his origins, and, eventually leaving Gwendolyn, who, in a boating accident stops short of helping her hated husband from drowning.George Eliot is known for her tragic endings and complex characterizations. This splendidly made movie is worthy of any made today, in Hollywood or out. And BBC knows much about literary adaptations--but most if its early productions lacked production values or superior acting (in most cases), mostly due to budgetary limitations, one would imagine. This is an exceptional movie, and one can see in one sitting, because it is so compelling one would not want to leave off watching.

736450,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0000897EC,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[19, 21]","One of George Eliot's most brilliant novels was ""Daniel Deronda,"" a heartfelt story about a young man searching for his past, and in it, his future. The BBC did a brilliant job dramatising this, with an excellent cast and an exquisitely beautiful backdrop -- and all the feeling, message and passion of the original book.Daniel Deronda (Hugh Dancy) is the ward (and rumored illegitimate son) of a nobleman, but he feels somehow aimless and unfulfilled -- he wants to devote himself to something, but doesn't know what. During a tour of Germany, he encounters pretty, reckless, arrogant Gwendolyn (Romola Garai) at a casino.Gwendolyn (who boasts that she gets everything she wants) is interested in Daniel, but when her family loses all their money, she marries a rich suitor, a relative of Daniel's -- knowing that his mistress and illegitimate children will be disinherited. But she soon finds that her new husband is a sadistic brute, and sees Daniel as her only help.Meanwhile, Daniel rescues the despairing Mirah Lapidoth (Jodhi May) from a suicide attempt, and he helps the young Jewish singer find a home and friends. As he helps her find her family, he becomes passionately attached to the Jewish population and their plight. Then he receives an important message -- one that will illuminate his roots, and give him a course of the future.When Eliot published her final novel, it caused a massive stir -- not many novelists tackled the plight of the Jewish population, or how it compared to the gilded upper classes. In a way, ""Daniel Deronda"" is both a love triangle and an allegory -- Daniel must choose between the pretty, shallow English life (Gwendolyn) or a rich Jewish heritage (Mirah) with a background of tragedy.The movie itself overflows with beauty -- sumptuous rooms, colourful ball gowns, rambling mansions, even the brilliant Mediterranean. But it has substance as well, with excellent direction in moments both beatiful and hideous (the wedding night scene).In fact, the direction gets stronger as the movie progresses, such as Daniel's tightly-wound conversations with his mother, and the last few conversations with Gwendolyn. And the cinematography is excellent -- the shot of Mirah slowly descending into the dark river is exquisite and chilling, like something from a beautiful horror movie.Handsome Dancy is one of the reasons this movie works so well -- Daniel is a kind, almost saintly person, but Dancy manages to imbue him with the restless, yearning quality that the character needed. Garai is excellent with the immature, selfish girl who desperately wants to be better. And while May is not as conventionally pretty as Garai, her performance is much more striking, such as when Mirah tells Daniel about her father trying to sell her.""Daniel Deronda"" could have been a pompous mess with an annoying lead, but instead it's a magnificently nuanced, beautifully filmed story about finding out who you are -- and who you're destined for.

On the ImdB, however, there are some opinions, mostly about the ultimate developments of the story, which I find disturbing.

Its opening scene takes place at a gambling casino, and that is the perfect symbol for the remainder of the plot.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[44, 47]","Masterpiece Theater's brilliant production of George Eliot's ""Daniel Deronda,"" was adapted by Andrew Davies from George Eliot's last and, perhaps, most ambitious novel. (although certainly not her best). Essentially, both the novel and the film are composed of two separate stories, linked by protagonist, Daniel Deronda, (Hugh Dancy).Set in England in the 1870's, the viewer is given a glimpse into the lives of British Jews, a society-within-a-society, though Daniel Deronda. Interestingly enough, most of Miss Eliot's contemporaries were oblivious to the Jews, who lived totally outside their frame of reference. Through her heroine, Gwendolyn Harleth, (Romola Garai), who marries for money and power rather than love, Eliot and the film explore a side of human relations that leads only to despair.Daniel sees Gwendolyn, for the first time, at a roulette table. He is fascinated by her classical, blonde English beauty, and vivacious, self-assured manner. When Miss Harleth is forced to sell her necklace to pay gambling debts, Deronda, a disapproving observer, buys back the jewelry, anonymously, and returns it to her. This is not the last time the deeply spiritual and altruistic Deronda will feel a need to rescue Gwendolyn.Daniel was adopted as a young boy by Sir Hugo, (Edward Fox), an English gentleman. He has received affection, a good education, and to some extent, position, from his guardian. However, Deronda has never been told the story of his true parentage, and sorely feels this lack of roots and his own identity. Not content to play the gentleman, he always appears to be searching for a purpose in life, and a spiritual center.Daniel's and Gwendolyn's lives intersect throughout the novel. They feel a strong mutual attraction initially, but Gwendolyn, with incredible passivity, decides to marry someone she knows is a scoundrel, for his wealth. The decision will haunt her as her life becomes a nightmare with the sadistic Henleigh Grandcourt, (Hugh Bonneville), her husband.At about the same time, Daniel inadvertently saves a young woman from suicide. He finds young Mirah Lapidoth, (Johdi May), near drowning, by the river and takes her to a friend's home to recover. There she is made welcome and asked to stay. She is a Jewess, abducted from her mother years before, by her father, who wanted to use the child's talent as a singer to earn money. When young Mirah forced her voice beyond its limits, and lost her ability to sing, her father abandoned her. She has never been able to reunite with her mother and brother, and was alone and destitute, until Daniel found her. Daniel, in his search for Mirah's family, meets the Cohens, a Jewish shop owner and his kin. Deronda feels an immediate affinity with them and visits often. He also comes to know a Jewish philosopher and Zionist, Mordecai, (Daniel Evans), and they forge a strong bond of friendship.Daniel finally does discover his identity, and has a very poignant and strange meeting with his mother. He had been earnestly taking steps to make a meaningful existence for himself, and with the new information about his parents and heritage, he is able to act on his dreams.One of the novel's most moving scenes is when Daniel and Gwendolyn meet for the last time. Gwendolyn has grown from a self-centered young woman to a mature, thoughtful adult, who has suffered and grown strong.This is an extraordinary period piece, directed with wit and subtlety by Tom Hooper. The cast is outstanding as are their performances. Lush costumes and beautiful scenery add richness to the film. However, like the novel, the movie is lacking. It is too metaphysical, too metaphorical, too much a morality play. There's not enough verve and vigor!! Although Hugh Bonneville's Grandcourt, does make a fabulous scoundrel.I did thoroughly enjoy this BBC production, flaws and all.

Well casted and beautifully filmed this is a lush story of Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen Harleth, and all of the other players in George Eliot's novel of subtle prejudice and self discovery.I found that the film did in fact crystalize all of the details from the book that I had somehow missed, and for me this was one of those rare cases where I found myself enjoying the film much greater than I had the book. The pacing is different and one or two events are rearranged to heighten the story telling, but I do not believe this hinders the original story. I found myself completely taken in by this superb adaptation and I believe that any of Eliot's admirers, or any period movie fan for that matter, would revel in this wonderful retelling of a classic.",5,Fans of the book rejoice,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,943,"['read', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'recently', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', 'acquaint', 'fuzzier', 'details', 'was', 'impressed', 'BBC', 'version', 'George', 'Eliot', 'book', 'word', 'go', 'Well', 'casted', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'lush', 'story', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'Gwendolen', 'Harleth', 'other', 'players', 'George', 'Eliot', 'novel', 'subtle', 'prejudice', 'self', 'discovery.I', 'found', 'film', 'did', 'fact', 'crystalize', 'details', 'book', 'had', 'somehow', 'missed', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'cases', 'where', 'found', 'enjoying', 'film', 'much', 'greater', 'had', 'book', 'pacing', 'different', 'one', 'two', 'events', 'are', 'rearranged', 'heighten', 'story', 'telling', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'original', 'story', 'found', 'completely', 'taken', 'superb', 'adaptation', 'believe', 'Eliot', 'admirers', 'period', 'movie', 'fan', 'matter', 'would', 'revel', 'wonderful', 'retelling', 'classic']",N/A

The sections of the novel which seem long-winded are presented fluently and gracefully, and the iterations which are wonderful to read are an even bigger joy to watch. Hugh Dancy as the title character does not overplay Deronda's inward contemplation nor does he downplay the spurts of emotion.

This is one of the few George Eliot books I haven't read, so the DVD was my first time for the story.All I can say is that Romola Garai, who plays the aforementioned wonder, Gwendolyn, is an absolute revelation! What a gorgeous woman! I can't recall any actress who has the regal bearing and exquisite form to wear period costumes so well.She's not just a clotheshorse, though. Her character is self-centered and selfish, and the first two episodes are full of Gwendolyn and her antics, including her creepy husband. It is THE best part of the entire miniseries, bar none!Garai just blows every other actor out of the water, including Hugh Dancy, who plays Deronda (his main acting technique seems to be lip quivering.)The Gwendolyn story is what's interesting about this; the Jewish plotline is, well, utterly stupid. Deronda is supposed to be some kind of 19th century Jewish messiah? And Mordecai, the weird TB patient, knows it? Oh puhleeze.Jodhi May who plays Mordecai's long long sister, Mirah, is another excellent actress. Considering how annoying the whole Jewish subplot was, she handled the part much, much better than anyone had a right to expect. SHE was THE only interesting character in the Jewish angle of the story.What a shame Eliot didn't just blow the whole Jewish messiah thing and stick with Gwendolyn! I could even have tolerated Mr. Quivering Lips if it was a means to discuss or even better, SHOW more Gwendolyn and her life and times!I highly recommend Episodes One and Two.

You might want to read this review after you watch the DVD.I enjoyed this production of the George Eliot novel.  The scriptwriter did a very good job of distilling an 800 page novel into a several hour movie.  I especially liked the use of music in the production. It helped to capture the spirit of the book.I do have a few small quibbles, however, in the departures from the book.  While the character of Daniel Deronda was very well done, the movie did not do a good job of portraying the depth of Gwendolyn's character.  In the book, the changes that happen to Gwendolyn are heartbreaking.  She comes close to killing herself.  She becomes to despise herself deeply, and needs Deronda to give her the strength to keep living through his faith in her. The script is partially at fault for this weakness, but it may have been a decision that had to be made due to time limits. But the actress, who did an excellent job as the shallow but lovable Emma in the BBC production of the Jane Austen novel, could have done a better job showing her pain and despair.  You probably won't see this as a weakness in the movie if you haven't read the book.  Also, in the book I wasn't convinced that Daniel and Gwendolyn were in love.  They had a strong connection, but it was mostly on Gwendolyn's side.  She admired his virtue and needed his approval to feel all right about herself. They certainly never came close to kissing, as they did in this movie.  And in the book Grandcourt is repugnant, even evil, and far more despicable than he is portrayed here. It's possible that portraying Grandcourt this way might have made the movie seem too melodramatic.  My last quibble involves the ending. The book ends on a very sad note for Gwendolyn who has lost all joy in life, but who has grown, at great cost to herself, into a woman who no longer thinks only of herself.  The movie ends on a much more hopeful note.That said, in spite of all these departures from the book, I still enjoyed the movie.  There were many things the script did right.

He actually notices someone that is in need and affectively helps those needy individuals because he believes that people are inherently good. He does this without agenda or discrimination. He is no respector of persons, but he knows a foul character when he sees one.He has a terrific scene with his guardian who reveals to him the truth about his mother and the fact that he (his guardian) is not his father. Daniel Deronda's (Hugh Dancy) reaction to this news is priceless. You see his hurt merely through facial expressions and body language. Likewise when his mother reveals to him about her past and her heritage he reacts with such maturity and sensibiity.The actress that plays Gwendolyn does a great job as well especially for her age. You genuinely feel sorry for her despite her previous selfishness.The music in this film is something else, that being a good thing. I think that the music really helps you feel the mood of specific scenes. The music will stick with you.Though I love this movie, I know that there are many people including myself that are disconcerted about how things end up between Gwendolyn and Daniel.

Bernabo,"[10, 11]","If you take the elements of a Greek tragedy, turn them into a the standard elements of modern soap opera, and set your story among the privileged class of 19th century England, then you have a pretty good approximately of this BBC adaptation of George Eliot's ""Daniel Deronda.""  Deronda (Hugh Dancy) has been adopted by Sir Hugo Mallinger (Edward Fox), and the question of his parentage is a shoe we keep waiting to drop for most of the three-part story, which is long enough for us to figure out at least one key element of the secret.  By that time the question is whether our young hero will end up with Gwendolen Harleth (Romola Garai), or Mirah Lapidoth (Jodhi May), who are as different as day and night.  Gwendolen is a spoiled member of the upper class who lords it over the rest of humanity until there is a radical change in her family fortune.  Mirah is Jewish and a singer, at a time when both were enough to cast serious aspiration's on a young woman's character, and has lost her family.Deronda helps out both women in turn, Gwendolen after a rash bet at a gaming table and Mirah when she falls into a river.  But there is a fourth member of this particular love triangle in Henleigh Grandcourt (Hugh Bonneville), who has decided that Gwendolen should be his wife.  She has affection for Deronda, but Grandcourt has money.  However, Grandcourt also has a mistress (Greta Scacchi) who has borne him three children and who extracts a promise from Gwendolen not to marry Grandcourt.  Circumstances dictate that Gwendolen has to renege on her promise, otherwise she could marry Daniel and the story would be over.  Instead, Gwendolen ends up in a loveless marriage with a predatory husband and begins the first in a series of hard lessons that will force her to repent of the sins of her earlier cavalier life.Daniel is a compassionate young man, and it is that nature along with a desire to do some greater good with his life's work that propels his actions.  In the effort to help Mirah find her lost family, Daniel encounters a young man named Mordecai (Daniel Evans), who insists that he not only knows something about Deronda's past but that he has been chosen to be a leader of his people.  At that point you can see the major resolutions of this drama laid out before you and it is simply a question of who will provide the answer to the riddle of Daniel Deronda's life.  When you see Barbara Hershey's name in the credits at the start of part three you know she will play that character and have a good guess as to whom that character will be.As a soap opera goes this is an extreme prim, proper and polite one.  Voices are rarely raised, and when they are there is usually an admonishment not to do so.  The set design and costumes are meticulously correct, as we expect everything that the BBC send across the pond for ""Masterpiece Theater.""  What we might find unbelievable is that Eliot was making the Zionist dream of a Jewish homeland a major part of a novel that would be published in 1876, but in terms of this production what is lacking is the sense that the hearts of these characters are truly involved.  There is no reason to ever think that Gwendolen has any concept of truly loving someone besides herself, Grandcourt is incapable of any passion other than anger, Mirah repeatedly denies what we would think would be an obvious affection for Daniel, and he exhibits no real spark of anything more than friendship for either Gwendolen or Mirah until he finally proposes marriage and if it were the most obvious conclusion to the story's sundry plots.The performances are as pretty as the sets and the costumes, butneither the story nor the script illict any truly memorable moments.  The most touching is between Daniel and Sir Hugo, which is not where the emotional high point should come.

Our hero is Daniel Deronda (Hugh Dancy): a handsome, generous, idealistic young man and son of Sir Hugo Mallinger (Edward Fox).  Our heroine is Gwendolen Harleth (Romola Garai): beautiful, spirited, selfish and spoiled.  When the two meet at a German casino, sparks fly.  Daniel is enchanted by the beautiful Gwendolen and she is likewise intrigued by the handsome, mysterious young man.The story unfolds as Daniel meets a young Jewish woman, Mirah Lapidoth (Jodhi May), whom he saves  from drowning. As he learns more about Mirah and her past, secrets unfold from his own past which lead to a search for his long lost mother.Meanwhile, Gwendolen is courted by a bevy of admirers and is pursued by the rich, haughty and cruel Henleigh Grandcourt (Hugh Bonneville), the nephew of Sir Hugo.  When her family's business fails and she is faced with the possibility of becoming a governess, Gwendolen makes a desperate choice and realizes that wealth and status do not always result in happiness.  Daniel and Gwendolen's lives are weaved together as each one embarks on a journey of self-discovery.DANIEL DERONDA has all the high production values that one would expect from the BBC and acclaimed British screenwriter Andrew Davies (both of whom gave us MIDDLEMARCH, WIVES AND DAUGHTERS and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  Up-and-coming young stars Hugh Dancy (Black Hawk Down, Ella Enchanted and David Copperfield) and Romola Garai (Nicholas Nickleby) are supported by drama favorites Edward Fox, Hugh Bonneville, Greta Scacchi, Amanda Root, Barbara Hershey and Jodhi May.  The locales take place in the splendid country houses of England, gritty London and romantic Genoa, Italy.  And the compelling story, of course, is based on the Victorian novel by George Eliot (her last novel), who also gave us Middlemarch (also an excellent BBC adaptation), Silas Marner and The Mill On The Floss.I highly recommend this DVD to everyone who enjoys British drama, period films or are fans of Ms. Eliot's great work.

Miniseries have the luxury of getting to tell the story in any longwinded way they like, letting you get attached to the characters, and Daniel Deronda and his co-characters are certainly an endearing bunch (with the exception of a few quite wicked or shady people) and the story definitely very well told.""Deronda"" takes it's time telling the story, and good for us. The story is enveloped in mystery, heartbreak, treacherous perverse characters, the trials and tribulations of the upper class, but most interestingly and captivatingly, the plight of the 19th century European Jew and Daniel's search for his ancestry, family, his heritage, and ultimately, his destiny. It's a beautiful and powerful message. The acting is top notch, with Hugh Dancy in an Emmy worthy understated performance. Daniel is a good fellow, but he's not ""too good to be true"", he's diginified and is a genuinely kind human being, but is at the same time sad and discontented with his life, and yet a warmth comes through the screen, making Dancy's Deronda one of the better characters ever portrayed on Masterpiece Theatre.Another great quality of this series is how interesting, in a historical sense, it is. Many series and films try to stuff themselves with melodrama and action, etc, to seem interesting. ""Deronda"" contents itself with the characters and their relation to the setting of 1870s England and Europe. Culture, prejudice, art, history, customs, all come through and are a very central character to what occurs to the various characters.Kudos go to the incredible acting from a passel of  well known British character and stage actors, cinematography, costumes, and the haunting score.

The family went off to bed at the usual time and I was glued to the couch. While the movie/book's name is nothing that would grab your attention, everything else about this should!First of all, the storyline is wonderful. Good man, bad man, good woman, bad woman, but it's not really a love triangle or even a square. I thought this might be a typical love story, which for me would have been fine, but it's a lot more. It starts off quickly and just goes from there. There are some really great twists and turns, nice surprises you may not see coming.Next, woah!! The actors! I can't help but start off with Hugh Dancy. Hummina Hummina. While I'm watching Middlemarch now (and will review it later) it's full of the most shockingly unattractive cast I've ever seen. I suppose that sounds silly and shallow, but you see, I'm on a BBC/Miniseries/Victorian Era kick right now. I've watched a lot of movies like Daniel Deronda and Pride And Prejudice and so forth. They all have at least one or two main characters that are stunning to look at, while MM doesn't. :)  On to Hugh Dancy (Daniel). His acting is wonderful, he has a lot of range as his character is all over the place. I think if you are not in love with him after you see the scene of him rowing and singing in Italian, you'll never be in love with him.  As for Roma Garai who plays Gwendolyn, she could almost carry this movie alone. You go from really hating her, she's so spoiled and rude, to rooting for her. She's also able to pull the audience in any way she wants to, and you feel it all. Just lovely. And I was very surprised to see Hugh Bonneville as Grandcourt. I've always seen him as the doofy guy in Notting Hill. WOW, my eyes are open now! Once I settled in to his character and gave him a chance to convert me into thinking of him (his character) as a very tough, uncompromising, secretive, bully of a man, I was more than impressed. If you happen to be a Bonneville fan, you absolutely must see him in Daniel Deronda!The music was perfectly chosen. The accents, of course, perfect. The scenery made me want to move to England immediately. The costumes, right down to the smallest detail, were lovely and quite interesting. The length of the movie was just right. It never felt rushed or dragged out.I hope you enjoy it. I know, with a name like Daniel Deronda...it has to be good!!",5,What a wonderful surprise!

There really is no need to buy movies anymore, is there, when one can so easily get them from any number of rental outlets?That said, we greatly enjoyed this richly-detailed story from George Eliot. The film is a very good length--210 minutes, in three parts--for a novel of this type. As in most of the Austen/Trollope/Eliot period pieces, the typical feature length of 90 to 120 minutes is not enough time to adequately develop the characters and story. I have not read the novel, though I fully intend to after seeing this production; to me, that is a good test of whether or not a film is worthwhile.It's a morality tale with a cast of wonderfully interesting and three dimensional characters. Daniel's quest to find his familial roots--and his true love--is deeply compelling. The production values and locations are magnificent throughout, the performances by the leads are all fabulous, the attention to detail, the beautiful music, the interiors and exteriors of all those incredible English mansions, are truly glorious. I found the Jewish flavor of the story to be endlessly fascinating; we are privileged travellers on a journey into an intimate world of Jewish faith and family.Jodhi May plays the haunting young girl whom Daniel rescues and restores to life. I had not seen her since her glowing performance in the masterpiece Last of the Mohicans. She is a revelation. Beautiful, full of emotion and repressed desire, very convincing in her accent and look.Luscious skinned, honey-haired, with a perfect figure, Romola Garai plays the selfish young beauty who everyone desires. With her immaturity and egocentrism, her frigidity, and her powerful beauty, she is really nothing more than an extremely attractive but empty ornament.

736497,A232HUAELH5J6V,B0000897EC,Ohioan,"[0, 0]","I found this film riveting in the first of its three episodes, but not so riveting in the second two. I think the reason for this is that Daniel Deronda is a movie (I haven't read the book) with two heroes. The first hero, Gwendolyn, wants above all else to not suffer hardship or the snobbery of middle-class families who would look down on her if she were a governess. Thus she marries a cold, heartless, but extremely wealthy man, Grandcourt. Her life is miserable and what she wants seems to change. It seems she now wants escape from the life she has chosen, but only if she can find somebody who will be her friend. Gwendolyn attaches her affections to the other hero of the story, Daniel Deronda, but it's never clear or certain that she loves him -- only that she sees him as solace or escape.Daniel, the second hero, is a young man who doesn't know his parentage. He has been brought up in the life of an English gentleman by Sir Hugo, whom he suspects may be his father. What Daniel wants is, at least in the movie, not entirely convincing. By the end of the film what he says he wants is cultural identity. In the beginning of the film we see that he's a young man trying to find himself. But it's just not clear that he wants to find cultural identity. He does, after all, have a culture. Thus Daniel's declaration at the end that he wants cultural identity strikes the viewer as something tagged on, not something that Daniel has been yearning for from the beginning of the movie.In the second and third episodes, the dramatic tension dissipates instead of increasing, and the story isn't entirely satisfying. The acting, however, is excellent, as are the period costumes and setting. Plus, I'm familiar with Hugh Bonneville only in his Downton Abbey role, so it was a shock -- but a pleasant one -- seeing him play such a detestable character as Grandcourt.

He must realize his true calling and conquer his superficial desires to embrace a much more complex love.The story unfolds in over three hours of lush settings, gorgeous period costumes and romantic vistas. Yet all the while the story is being told, you can feel the deeper connections between the characters. As you come to terms with their individual destinies, the beauty of this Masterpiece Theatre series reveals itself with startling honesty in a drama where emotions are mostly simmering beneath the surface.Love as a commitment and love as a game reveals two contrasting worlds. This dance in a world of decadence turns into a game of survival, where the choices of the two main characters hold lives in the balance. One wrong decision and the fate of everyone around them is changed forever.Daniel Deronda and Gwendolyn meet and mingle in a world of wealth, but in their hearts they long for a more challenging life fraught with conflicts only the soul can fight. Gwendolyn is in a controlling marriage, while Daniel is still finding his way in the world of love. Like a knight he seems to prefer courtly love to a long-term commitment, but this starts to change when he meets a beautiful Jewish singer who he rescues from drowning.Gwendolyn's wild exuberance while horse riding seems to represent her inner tenacity and as it is only when she has been broken herself and then healed that she too finds her true heart.

The actor who plays Daniel Deronda couldn't have been chosen any better and the selection of Romola Garai to portray the beautiful but selfish Mrs. Grandcourt was equally rich. What makes this movie so memorable and endearing is the theme. You have two beautiful, very beautiful and talented girls vying for the heart of one man (of course, this is every man's dream). But where it gets really good, is the humbling process that Mrs Grandcourt must go through, in order to see what kind of woman she was. At the end, through great pain and self discovery of her inner selfishness, she is finally fit to become someone's excellent wife. She pines away the hours and for days on end for the chance to become Daniel's wife, but during this humbing and transformation of the most beautiful Romola Garai, Daniel is falling in love with another girl, whom he rescued from a watery grave. Daniel was an English Gentleman, with manners, courtesy, love and caring for those he knew. As Daniel was slowly discovering his Jewish roots through the girl whose life he saved, he began to fall in love with her, not only for her beauty, but her commitment to God through Judaism and her angelic voice. She was very talented and nice to look at, but it was her singing voice and dedication to God is what attracted Daniel to her. Towards the end, Daniel became more involved is his new found Jewish family and began identifing with them. The scenery of the film switched back and forth from England to Italy, and the twist at the end with Daniel's mother emerging from a life long silence added to the excitment and plot. As Daniel finally proposed to this beautiful Jewess, it was followed by a Jewish wedding ceremony with Jewish wedding music. It was so good to see a film that included the richness of the Jewish traditions and religion without apology. And now, at the end of the story, where both beauties wanted Daniel Deronda, only one of them won the prize. On the one hand, this story is every guys dream; a well mannered rich guy, who is handsome and desired by all the ladies, and on the other hand, they both can't have him, and it leaves your heart broken for the beautiful Mrs Grandcourt.

Henry James, in an interesting piece called Conversations about Daniel Deronda, effectively examined the high and low points of the novel: the compelling story of self-centered Gwendolyn and the emotionally brutal and controlling Grandcourt, the thoughtful examination of money and prestige vs. conscience and moral responsibility, the issue of the position of Jews in Victorian England (see for sake of comparison Trollope's ""The Way We Live Now,""), the somewhat implausible Zionist subplot, the almost too good to be true and bloodless Daniel, the absense of likeability in most of the characters, the thin and slow paced story, etc.  This production manages to retain most of the strengths of the novel, eliminate some of its weaknesses, and turns out to be quite an enjoyable endeavor, and far quicker than reading the book.  The details of the story are well enough described by other viewers.  However, I thought the two female leads were both wonderful.  No, we don't especially like the self-centered and whining Gwendolyn and do tire of her proclaiming ""Oh, how you would hate me if you only knew what I have done!""  In a cruel way, it is hard not to feel that she gets what she deserves, having married an obvously cold and calculating man for money and position when another woman, his former mistress, and their children have a far better claim on him. His reprehensible behavior should have been a warning, and her motivation--that she couldn't bear to become a governess--evokes little sympathy.  And no, I don't believe a jot that she has been thoroughly redeemed by the end of the novel.  That being said, although it is perhaps a drawback that we don't much like Gwendolyn, Romola Garai does a fine job with her and is lovely to look at. And of course no one, however shallow and self centered, deserves Grandcourt. He is protrayed superbly with that kind of heavy, cruel quiet by Hugh Bonneville, whose caresses of Gwendolyn seem worse than blows.  On the other hand, I thought Mirah was wonderful and the actress who portrayed her created a real emotional connection. Of course, the details of her rescue, the discovery of and reunion with her brother, and Deronda's discovery of his own heritage are so far fetched that they test the most generous credulity and threaten to ruin the story. Likewise, Barbara Hershey was the one glaring casting mistake as Daniel's mother. Nevertheless, if you can suspend disbelief, Daniel's and Mirah's journey is entertaining.  Finally, kudos to Edward Fox as Daniel's guardian, who shares with Daniel perhaps the most moving scene in the series.  This is also a beautiful production.  Overall, the series is well worth the time and trouble, but don't expect it to deliver Eliot's insight, and come to the series with your credulity in tact.",3,"Fine adaptation, not Eliot's best",1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,2897,"['know', 'are', 'fans', 'George', 'Eliot', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'hard', 'argue', 'best', 'work', 'Henry', 'James', 'interesting', 'piece', 'called', 'Conversations', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'effectively', 'examined', 'high', 'low', 'points', 'novel', 'compelling', 'story', 'self-centered', 'Gwendolyn', 'emotionally', 'brutal', 'controlling', 'Grandcourt', 'thoughtful', 'examination', 'money', 'prestige', 'vs.', 'conscience', 'moral', 'responsibility', 'issue', 'position', 'Jews', 'Victorian', 'England', 'see', 'sake', 'comparison', 'Trollope', 'Way', 'Live', 'Now', 'somewhat', 'implausible', 'Zionist', 'subplot', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'bloodless', 'Daniel', 'absense', 'likeability', 'most', 'characters', 'thin', 'slow', 'paced', 'story', 'etc', 'production', 'retain', 'most', 'strengths', 'novel', 'eliminate', 'weaknesses', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'endeavor', 'far', 'quicker', 'reading', 'book', 'details', 'story', 'are', 'well', 'enough', 'described', 'other', 'viewers', 'However', 'thought', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'were', 'wonderful', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'especially', 'self-centered', 'whining', 'Gwendolyn', 'do', 'tire', 'proclaiming', 'Oh', 'how', 'would', 'hate', 'only', 'knew', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'cruel', 'way', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'what', 'having', 'married', 'obvously', 'cold', 'calculating', 'man', 'money', 'position', 'when', 'woman', 'former', 'mistress', 'children', 'have', 'far', 'better', 'claim', 'reprehensible', 'behavior', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'warning', 'motivation', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'become', 'governess', 'little', 'sympathy', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'jot', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'redeemed', 'end', 'novel', 'being', 'said', 'perhaps', 'drawback', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'Gwendolyn', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'fine', 'job', 'lovely', 'look', 'course', 'one', 'however', 'shallow', 'self', 'centered', 'Grandcourt', 'protrayed', 'superbly', 'kind', 'heavy', 'cruel', 'quiet', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'caresses', 'Gwendolyn', 'seem', 'worse', 'blows', 'other', 'hand', 'thought', 'Mirah', 'was', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'who', 'portrayed', 'created', 'real', 'emotional', 'connection', 'course', 'details', 'rescue', 'discovery', 'reunion', 'brother', 'Deronda', 'discovery', 'own', 'heritage', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'fetched', 'test', 'most', 'generous', 'credulity', 'threaten', 'ruin', 'story', 'Likewise', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'was', 'one', 'glaring', 'casting', 'mistake', 'Daniel', 'mother', 'Nevertheless', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'Daniel', 'Mirah', 'journey', 'entertaining', 'Finally', 'kudos', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Daniel', 'guardian', 'who', 'shares', 'Daniel', 'perhaps', 'most', 'moving', 'scene', 'series', 'also', 'beautiful', 'production', 'Overall', 'series', 'well', 'time', 'trouble', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'deliver', 'Eliot', 'insight', 'come', 'series', 'credulity', 'tact']",N/A

736512,A2KUMYWXAQNARZ,B0000897EC,toronto,"[1, 1]","SPOILERSThis is a very beautifully done version of a problematic book.  The series has the unfortunate characteristic --  like all TV series of this type -- of having to stress the plot, which is the least of the book's virtues.  Deronda (the book) is an attempt to turn the standard romance novel into something else:  a search for the organic self, either individually or in society.  It should probably have been two separate novels: the one that we have is very lumpy and endless (Mark Twain said that he slogged through Daniel Deronda ""losing flesh the whole time"", and I felt the same way) , with some really bad structural problems (e.g.  Genoa!) (Countess Carisi!).  The romance impulse in the book naturally drives the two main characters together: the reader feels that they should have ended the novel together, but the period and the author stood in their way; and we are left with the two of them as better people for having met each other.  True to life, perhaps, but totally lousy for a romance.  And really bad for TV. (The most absurd moment in the whole film is the final scene of a ""better Gwendolyn"" looking like Maria from The Sound of Music exultant on a sunny hillside).What makes the second of the ""two novels in one"" work is, of course, Eliot's amazing psychological insights and social thinking -- but the film can't really do anything much with those.  It was also easier in the 19th century to take the Zionist project as an unalloyed good, looking for a British Moses with a draft of the Balfour Declaration prophetically jammed into his jacket pocket.But it is all very beautiful and watchable.  (Romance requires the two most beautiful people to get together, and Hugh Dancy and Romola Garai are certainly beautiful.  He is slightly more beautiful than she is.)Battlestar Galactica fans will relish Jamie Bamber in a blonde wig and beard.I also liked Hugh Bonneville -- he proves the adage that comedians make the best dastardly villains.",4,Eliotic,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1969,"['SPOILERSThis', 'very', 'beautifully', 'done', 'version', 'problematic', 'book', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'characteristic', 'TV', 'series', 'type', 'having', 'stress', 'plot', 'least', 'book', 'virtues', 'Deronda', 'book', 'attempt', 'turn', 'standard', 'romance', 'novel', 'something', 'else', 'search', 'organic', 'self', 'individually', 'society', 'should', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'separate', 'novels', 'one', 'have', 'very', 'lumpy', 'endless', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'said', 'slogged', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'losing', 'flesh', 'whole', 'time', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'really', 'bad', 'structural', 'problems', 'e.g', 'Genoa', 'Countess', 'Carisi', 'romance', 'impulse', 'book', 'naturally', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'together', 'reader', 'feels', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'novel', 'together', 'period', 'author', 'stood', 'way', 'are', 'left', 'two', 'better', 'people', 'having', 'met', 'other', 'True', 'life', 'perhaps', 'totally', 'lousy', 'romance', 'really', 'bad', 'TV', 'most', 'absurd', 'moment', 'whole', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'better', 'Gwendolyn', 'looking', 'Maria', 'Sound', 'Music', 'exultant', 'sunny', 'hillside', 'second', 'two', 'novels', 'one', 'work', 'course', 'Eliot', 'amazing', 'psychological', 'insights', 'social', 'thinking', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'much', 'was', 'also', 'easier', '19th', 'century', 'take', 'Zionist', 'project', 'unalloyed', 'good', 'looking', 'British', 'Moses', 'draft', 'Balfour', 'Declaration', 'prophetically', 'jammed', 'jacket', 'pocket.But', 'very', 'beautiful', 'watchable', 'Romance', 'two', 'most', 'beautiful', 'people', 'get', 'together', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'are', 'certainly', 'beautiful', 'slightly', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'fans', 'will', 'relish', 'Jamie', 'Bamber', 'blonde', 'wig', 'beard.I', 'also', 'liked', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'adage', 'comedians', 'make', 'best', 'dastardly', 'villains']",N/A

""Daniel Deronda"" leads you to believe that this was a movie about romance among the British aristocracy and all of the delectable accoutrements surrounding the genre.  However, it fell dreadfully short of demonstrating the integrity of its description.  Was this a story about the English aristocracy or was it a story about Jews creating a homeland? These two themes are too broad and rich for either to be a believable sub-plot. Therefore, it should have been decided which theme would prevail rather than awkwardly cramming both into one story line.  Nevertheless, Hugh Bonneville's portrayal of Henley Grandcourt was stellar. He was deliciously sinister, and so much more could have been drawn out of the story between him and his wife, Gwendolyn, and their tumultuous marriage. Captalizing on the dynamics between these two characters would have made it a much more engaging film. The title character's (Daniel Deronda)quest for meaning in his life was extremely disjointed; it didn't fit well with the rest of the movie on any level. It was, as it were, a story all its own--a story so contrived that it frustrated the rest of the movie.  Hence, it ended up being a period film minus the intrigue, mystery, and passion one expects from this genre.",2,Thank you Hugh Bonneville,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,1376,"['Were', 'not', 'fine', 'performance', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'painful', 'viewer', 'watch', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'believe', 'was', 'movie', 'romance', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'delectable', 'accoutrements', 'surrounding', 'genre', 'However', 'fell', 'dreadfully', 'short', 'demonstrating', 'integrity', 'description', 'Was', 'story', 'English', 'aristocracy', 'was', 'story', 'Jews', 'creating', 'homeland', 'two', 'themes', 'are', 'too', 'broad', 'rich', 'be', 'believable', 'sub-plot', 'Therefore', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'decided', 'theme', 'would', 'prevail', 'rather', 'awkwardly', 'cramming', 'one', 'story', 'line', 'Nevertheless', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'portrayal', 'Henley', 'Grandcourt', 'was', 'stellar', 'was', 'deliciously', 'sinister', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'story', 'wife', 'Gwendolyn', 'tumultuous', 'marriage', 'Captalizing', 'dynamics', 'two', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'film', 'title', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'quest', 'meaning', 'life', 'was', 'extremely', 'disjointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'rest', 'movie', 'level', 'was', 'were', 'story', 'own', 'story', 'so', 'contrived', 'frustrated', 'rest', 'movie', 'Hence', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'period', 'film', 'intrigue', 'mystery', 'passion', 'one', 'genre']",N/A

The main character Daniel Deronda[Hugh Dancy], is a young man of unknown parentage who is the adopted son of a wealthy man, Sir Hugo, and has all the trappings of wealth, yet yearns for a 'real' purpose and searches for his identity. When the story begins, we are shown a scene where a beautiful woman [Romola Garai] is gambling at the roulette table and when Daniel [Hugh Dancy] stares at her, her winning streak comes to an abrupt end. She is intrigued by him, yet refuses to be introduced to him.We are then shown a flashback to months earlier when the beauty, a Ms Gwendolyn is shown to be the toast of society, and is desired by the men of her society, both young and old, rich and not so rich. Gwendolyn typifies the spoilt young rich woman who tells her mother 'I hate everyone!' and possesses a fiery temperament. She attracts the particular attentions of Mr Grandcourt [Hugh Bonneville] who hides a malevolent and cruel streak beneath his sophisticated and attentive exterior. When she finds out a scandalous truth about him, Gwen flees to Europe before news that her family fortunes have been lost brings her back into Grandcourt's circle again.Daniel's story is also no less compelling - he goes boating one day and saves a young woman who has attempted suicide. The young lady turns out to be a gifted singer and Jewess, Mirah Lapidoth [Jodhi May] who is in despair for her attempts to find her long lost mother and brother have been in vain. Daniel sends her to a friend's home to be nursed and taken care of, and pays all her expenses whilst trying to help her find her family. In the process, he inadvertently comes into contact with people whom he feels a strange affinity for and this leads him to uncover the truth of his own origins.The action in this drama is non-stop - but I am not referring to the swashbuckling sort of action, rather the intensity of emotions and unfolding of the story of the two main characters - Daniel and Gwendolyn. Their stories though different, are also parallel for fate brings them together again. What happens to these two characters forms the backbone of the story and makes for compelling viewing.Hugh Dancy and Romola Garai do an excellent job as the leads, and the other characters are also equally credible in their roles. Hugh Bonneville makes an appropriately revolting villain, and Jodhi May plays the role of the impoverished yet gifted singer ably.The sets and score are simply beautiful as are the scenes of the English countryside and also other exotic locations. All in all, I would highly recommend this series to those who are avid period drama fans.",5,Beautiful period drama that weaves romance with a man's search for purpose and identity,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,2695,"['Daniel', 'Deronda', 'series', 'based', 'George', 'Eliot', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'main', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', '[', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', ']', 'young', 'man', 'unknown', 'parentage', 'who', 'adopted', 'son', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Sir', 'Hugo', 'trappings', 'wealth', 'yet', ""'real"", 'purpose', 'searches', 'identity', 'When', 'story', 'are', 'shown', 'scene', 'where', 'beautiful', 'woman', '[', 'Romola', 'Garai', ']', 'gambling', 'roulette', 'table', 'when', 'Daniel', '[', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', ']', 'winning', 'streak', 'abrupt', 'end', 'intrigued', 'yet', 'be', 'introduced', 'him.We', 'are', 'then', 'shown', 'flashback', 'months', 'earlier', 'when', 'beauty', 'Ms', 'Gwendolyn', 'shown', 'be', 'toast', 'society', 'desired', 'men', 'society', 'young', 'old', 'rich', 'not', 'so', 'rich', 'Gwendolyn', 'spoilt', 'young', 'rich', 'woman', 'who', 'mother', 'hate', 'everyone', 'fiery', 'temperament', 'particular', 'attentions', 'Mr', 'Grandcourt', '[', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', ']', 'who', 'malevolent', 'cruel', 'streak', 'sophisticated', 'attentive', 'exterior', 'When', 'out', 'scandalous', 'truth', 'Gwen', 'Europe', 'news', 'family', 'fortunes', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'back', 'Grandcourt', 'circle', 'again.Daniel', 'story', 'also', 'less', 'compelling', 'boating', 'one', 'day', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'young', 'lady', 'out', 'be', 'gifted', 'singer', 'Jewess', 'Mirah', 'Lapidoth', '[', 'Jodhi', 'May', ']', 'who', 'despair', 'attempts', 'find', 'long', 'lost', 'mother', 'brother', 'have', 'been', 'vain', 'Daniel', 'friend', 'home', 'be', 'nursed', 'taken', 'care', 'expenses', 'whilst', 'trying', 'help', 'find', 'family', 'process', 'inadvertently', 'contact', 'people', 'whom', 'strange', 'affinity', 'uncover', 'truth', 'own', 'origins.The', 'action', 'drama', 'non-stop', 'am', 'not', 'referring', 'swashbuckling', 'sort', 'action', 'rather', 'intensity', 'emotions', 'unfolding', 'story', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Daniel', 'Gwendolyn', 'stories', 'different', 'are', 'also', 'parallel', 'fate', 'brings', 'together', 'again', 'What', 'two', 'characters', 'forms', 'backbone', 'story', 'compelling', 'viewing.Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'leads', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'equally', 'credible', 'roles', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'appropriately', 'revolting', 'villain', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'role', 'impoverished', 'yet', 'gifted', 'singer', 'ably.The', 'sets', 'score', 'are', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'are', 'scenes', 'English', 'countryside', 'also', 'other', 'exotic', 'locations', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'avid', 'period', 'drama', 'fans']",N/A
736522,A3N882HVOOPA2I,B0000897EC,Z. Yang,"[7, 8]","The story is about searching, searching for true identity, searching for love, and searching for destiny.Charming and sensitive young man Daniel Deronda, who was the adopted son of an aristocratic Englishman, was at the threshold of a new life period when he met the beautiful but self-centered Gwendolen Harleth, and saved the life of a tender and angel-voiced Jewish girl, Mirah. In helping Mirah to find her families, Daniel walked into the Jewish society, astounded and, almost immediately, attached. The story moves in and out of the drama around young beauty Gwendolen gambling her life and Daniel searching for his true life. When the conventional Victorian life and the Jewish living at the margins of the society are combined and contrasted, with exquisite craft, it adds great intensity and range to the drama. The great camera work has captured the grandeurs and subtleties with equal sensitivity. The music, in which the gloriousness of the opera singing echoes the sereneness of the Jewish chanting, is enchantingly beautiful.Hugh Dancy has lived, rather than just acted, Daniel Deronda. He is a fine actor with a deep understanding of the character. He has such vivid expressions in his eyes that you can see Daniel's complexity and perplexity simply through his eyes. Gwendolen would be less truthful if not for the certain level of vulnerability and sincerity in Romala Garai's portrayal, which also has somewhat smoothes out character's vulgarity. Mirah, although not a very big role, has an essential importance to the entire story. Jodhi May's heartfelt and natural acting is exactly what we would expect from this loving character.This BBC miniseries is brilliant in every aspect. It's an exceptional work with a finely balanced artifice and raw drama.",5,"Extraordinary Story, Rich Drama, Great Acting!",1058486400,"07 18, 2003",2003,1772,"['story', 'searching', 'searching', 'true', 'identity', 'searching', 'love', 'searching', 'destiny.Charming', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'son', 'aristocratic', 'Englishman', 'was', 'threshold', 'new', 'life', 'period', 'when', 'met', 'beautiful', 'self-centered', 'Gwendolen', 'Harleth', 'saved', 'life', 'tender', 'angel-voiced', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'Mirah', 'helping', 'Mirah', 'find', 'families', 'Daniel', 'walked', 'Jewish', 'society', 'astounded', 'almost', 'immediately', 'attached', 'story', 'moves', 'drama', 'young', 'beauty', 'Gwendolen', 'gambling', 'life', 'Daniel', 'searching', 'true', 'life', 'When', 'conventional', 'Victorian', 'life', 'Jewish', 'living', 'margins', 'society', 'are', 'combined', 'contrasted', 'exquisite', 'craft', 'great', 'intensity', 'range', 'drama', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'captured', 'grandeurs', 'subtleties', 'equal', 'sensitivity', 'music', 'gloriousness', 'opera', 'singing', 'sereneness', 'Jewish', 'chanting', 'enchantingly', 'beautiful.Hugh', 'Dancy', 'lived', 'rather', 'just', 'acted', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'fine', 'actor', 'deep', 'understanding', 'character', 'such', 'vivid', 'expressions', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'Daniel', 'complexity', 'perplexity', 'simply', 'eyes', 'Gwendolen', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'truthful', 'not', 'certain', 'level', 'vulnerability', 'sincerity', 'Romala', 'Garai', 'portrayal', 'also', 'somewhat', 'out', 'character', 'vulgarity', 'Mirah', 'not', 'very', 'big', 'role', 'essential', 'importance', 'entire', 'story', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'heartfelt', 'natural', 'acting', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'loving', 'character.This', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'brilliant', 'aspect', 'exceptional', 'work', 'finely', 'balanced', 'artifice', 'raw', 'drama']",N/A
