The backdrop of this movie is the American Civil War's Battle of the Wilderness.  Written, directed, and produced by Kevin Hershberger the film unfolds like a canvas before your eyes.  Shot on location throughout Virginia it gives the viewer a perfect feel for the times in which the story takes place.  Six soldiers, a terrible battle, friends, enemies, and waiting love are all in this story.  The acting is great too.  Brian Merrick as Confederate Harrison Bolding and DJ Perry as Yank John Sunderlin really play well off of one and other.  A good part of the story takes place at night when color and affinities are blurred.  There is a good lesson here about war and humanity.

We are supposed to believe that there were no literate soldiers in the Southern army! C'mon, the poor guy had to carry those letters around for three years waiting for someone to read them because no one in the Confederate army could read? This is just silly, and the idea that these men couldn't tell they were with soldiers from the other side? I really wish I could give this film a good review, as there  few and far between movies made on the war between the states, and good ones are really rare.

There isn't any glamour and the men are just presented as plain men.  The beginning was actually well done, and while there wasn't any talking at the very beginning; it was so well done that we didn't notice it.  The  music was pleasant all throughout.  I thought the exchange between the yankee soldier and the Confederate soldier with the letters was especially touching.  The ending is not the typical happy ending or romanticized ending that movies usually have, but rather it has a tragic and probably more realistic ending than most war movies.  There is some swearing, but mostly the milder swear words and for the most part it is a pretty clean movie.  I was pleasantly surprised as all the acting was well done.

781474,A1W7JW829H45AE,B0000E6FNK,"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[2, 4]","I recently bought a DVD copy of ""Wicked Spring"", mainly based on the many favorable reviews I read on this site. Began looking after thoroughly loving another little-known Indie Civil War film, ""Pharaoh's Army"" (1995, starring Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson in the lead roles). The reviews on this site for ""Wicked Spring"" sounded similar, so I bought a copy and watched it for the first time the other night.Quick take: in no way as good a movie as ""Pharaoh's Army""(in every respect- acting, plot, cinematography, pacing, etc), but still an above-average Civil War movie, so long as you understand that, like ""Pharaoh's Army"", it is not meant to be a grand epic filled with big battle scenes, but a small slice of the Civil War, from the personal level of a few grunt soldiers struggling through a few days of that massive conflict.The story in ""Wicked Spring"" is simple enough: during the horrible 1864 battle of The Wilderness (around Chancellorsville, Virginia), 6 soldiers (3 from each side) wind up being thrown together in the darkness of one night, following a confused day of fighting and running around lost in the dense woods and general chaos that was the battle of The Wilderness. The initial scenes of the fighting are done well enough, though without a whole lot of sheer-terror or graphic violence (read any historical accounts of the real battle and you'll realize how toned-down the movie depiction is). The 6 men spend the night together, largely lost and afraid, and clearly (with the exception of one Confederate soldier) not anxious to hurt anyone anytime soon. The bulk of the movie revolves around conversation between the two lead actors during that night ( Yankee D.J. Perry and Reb Brian Merrick), with the most revealing part of that being a series of letters from Merrick's sweetheart back home, which are caringly read to him by Perry, as the Reb is illiterate, and has held the letters for 3 years without being able to read their content. The two leads actors do a passing job of acting, though this is very subdued material, and not a whole lot of content about the Civil War or it's tensions, but just generic wishing-for-home material that is common to all soldiers, during all wars. The supporting cast, however, is simply awful: particulalrly the angry Reb (Terry Jernigan) whose over-the-top routine gets old pretty fast. In all fairness, the supporting actors really aren't given anything too interesting to say, but even so, their acting is pretty bad, even for an Indie film. Not fair to compare this aspect to ""Pharaoh""s Army"" , with two major motion picture stars taking the leads in that one (as well as an excellent supporting cast of lesser-known actors), but just be prepared to wince and even yawn a little off and on during ""Wicked Spring"". The issue about whether the soldiers recognize early on that they are on different sides or not seemed fairly obvious to me: I understood their words and actions to mean they knew, but just didn't want to deal with it for that particualr night. That is, until the Jernigan character acts like it was a revelation the next morning that he has spent the night with 3 Yankees- this part just didn't make sense to me.The eventual climax the next morning seemed all too predictable to me, and for that reason it lost a lot of the intended dramatic impact. When the movie ended, I wasn't blown away or left with any lasting impressions, as I certainly was with ""Pharaoh's Army"". My usual way to critically assess any movie is whether or not I will watch it several times after the first viewing: I might watch ""Wicked Spring"" again, but I have watched ""Pharaoh's Army"" many times over the last couple of years. Enough said.The cinematography in this flick is pretty good, and the attention to detail in the soldiers uniforms and gear is first-rate: Civil War buffs will notice this aspect, but I doubt it will mean much to the average viewer. The musical score is at times quite moving and beautiful, and never detracts from any scene.Overall I give it 3 stars, mainly for the attention to Civil War details and the two lead actors work. I suspect it will appeal to Civil War buffs primarily, though, and for most others, probably a once-viewed flick without much lasting impact. But no way is it either just one star or 5 stars: folks who rate it that way are way too biased, one way or the other.Needless to say, I'm a Civil War buff. But if you haven't done so already, check out ""Pharaoh's Army""- a real gem, in every way.",3,For Civil War buffs only,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,4514,"['recently', 'bought', 'DVD', 'copy', 'Wicked', 'Spring', 'mainly', 'based', 'many', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'read', 'site', 'Began', 'looking', 'thoroughly', 'loving', 'little-known', 'Indie', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', '1995', 'starring', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'lead', 'roles', 'reviews', 'site', 'Wicked', 'Spring', 'sounded', 'similar', 'bought', 'copy', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'other', 'night.Quick', 'take', 'way', 'good', 'movie', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'respect-', 'acting', 'plot', 'cinematography', 'pacing', 'etc', 'still', 'above-average', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'so', 'long', 'understand', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'grand', 'epic', 'filled', 'big', 'battle', 'scenes', 'small', 'slice', 'Civil', 'War', 'personal', 'level', 'few', 'grunt', 'soldiers', 'struggling', 'few', 'days', 'massive', 'conflict.The', 'story', 'Wicked', 'Spring', 'simple', 'enough', 'horrible', '1864', 'battle', 'Wilderness', 'Chancellorsville', 'Virginia', '6', 'soldiers', '3', 'side', 'up', 'being', 'thrown', 'together', 'darkness', 'one', 'night', 'following', 'confused', 'day', 'fighting', 'running', 'around', 'lost', 'dense', 'woods', 'general', 'chaos', 'was', 'battle', 'Wilderness', 'initial', 'scenes', 'fighting', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'whole', 'lot', 'sheer-terror', 'graphic', 'violence', 'read', 'historical', 'accounts', 'real', 'battle', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'how', 'toned-down', 'movie', 'depiction', '6', 'men', 'spend', 'night', 'together', 'largely', 'lost', 'afraid', 'clearly', 'exception', 'one', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'not', 'anxious', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'anytime', 'soon', 'bulk', 'movie', 'around', 'conversation', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'night', 'Yankee', 'D.J', 'Perry', 'Reb', 'Brian', 'Merrick', 'most', 'revealing', 'part', 'being', 'series', 'letters', 'Merrick', 'sweetheart', 'back', 'home', 'are', 'caringly', 'read', 'Perry', 'Reb', 'illiterate', 'held', 'letters', '3', 'years', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'content', 'two', 'leads', 'actors', 'do', 'passing', 'job', 'acting', 'very', 'subdued', 'material', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'content', 'Civil', 'War', 'tensions', 'just', 'generic', 'wishing-for-home', 'material', 'common', 'soldiers', 'wars', 'supporting', 'cast', 'however', 'simply', 'awful', 'particulalrly', 'angry', 'Reb', 'Terry', 'Jernigan', 'over-the-top', 'routine', 'old', 'pretty', 'fast', 'fairness', 'supporting', 'actors', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'anything', 'too', 'interesting', 'say', 'even', 'so', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'even', 'Indie', 'film', 'Not', 'fair', 'compare', 'aspect', 'Pharaoh', 's', 'Army', 'two', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'taking', 'leads', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'lesser-known', 'actors', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'wince', 'even', 'yawn', 'little', 'off', 'Wicked', 'Spring', 'issue', 'soldiers', 'recognize', 'early', 'are', 'different', 'sides', 'not', 'seemed', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'understood', 'words', 'actions', 'mean', 'knew', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', 'particualr', 'night', 'Jernigan', 'character', 'acts', 'was', 'revelation', 'next', 'morning', 'spent', 'night', '3', 'Yankees-', 'part', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'me.The', 'eventual', 'climax', 'next', 'morning', 'seemed', 'too', 'predictable', 'reason', 'lost', 'lot', 'intended', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'When', 'movie', 'ended', 'was', ""n't"", 'blown', 'away', 'left', 'lasting', 'impressions', 'certainly', 'was', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'usual', 'way', 'critically', 'assess', 'movie', 'not', 'will', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'first', 'viewing', 'might', 'watch', 'Wicked', 'Spring', 'again', 'have', 'watched', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'many', 'times', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'Enough', 'said.The', 'cinematography', 'flick', 'pretty', 'good', 'attention', 'detail', 'soldiers', 'uniforms', 'gear', 'first-rate', 'Civil', 'War', 'buffs', 'will', 'notice', 'aspect', 'doubt', 'will', 'mean', 'much', 'average', 'viewer', 'musical', 'score', 'times', 'quite', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'never', 'detracts', 'scene.Overall', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'mainly', 'attention', 'Civil', 'War', 'details', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'work', 'suspect', 'will', 'appeal', 'Civil', 'War', 'buffs', 'primarily', 'most', 'others', 'probably', 'once-viewed', 'flick', 'much', 'lasting', 'impact', 'way', 'either', 'just', 'one', 'star', '5', 'stars', 'folks', 'who', 'rate', 'way', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'biased', 'one', 'way', 'other.Needless', 'say', ""'m"", 'Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'so', 'already', 'check', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'real', 'gem', 'way']",Wicked Spring

Three thought it was the worst movie ever made, and one thought is was pretty good. The one who liked it offered to bring it over - which he did - and we watched it together.The first fifteen minutes or so shows mainly the two main characters - one from the north, and one from the south - with their sweetheart and wife. Life before the war.The second part shows them three years down the road, the war in full force, and our characters are fighting in the Battle of the Wilderness. This depiction of the battle was excellent. I would put it against any major motion picture Civil War battle for authenticity, it's that good. Very realistic in the sounds department - lots of screaming wounded and yelling about. Truly authentic.The third part of the movie shows our two heroes, as well as a couple of their comrades, lost and, through a series of circumstances, enjoying each other's company under the darkness of night, neither side fully realizing they are in the company of the enemy.Is this story line far-fetched? Probably, but not impossible. If you pay attention to the dialogue (especially as the letters are read), you will figure out that the Yank puts two and two together and knows who his new friends are.Not a bad concept, more like a what if? rather than historically accurate.Speaking of accuracy, the clothing - military and civilian - are as perfect as I have seen on film. Kudos is deserved for that alone!As for the acting, well, it's OK for the most part, but there are a couple of scenes where the acting is abysmal at best, especially in a particular scene during the battle where the messenger is speaking to the general. Simply awful. Thank God there are only a couple lines.The rest of the cast does a fairly decent job.So, to sum it up: 5 stars for accuracy and authenticity, 5 stars for the battle, 3 stars for the majority of the actor's quality, 1 star for the messenger and general's acting ability (or lack thereof), 3 stars for the story, and 3 stars for the script. I figure my total to be a 3 or maybe a 3.5 score - not too bad when you think about it. Let's put it this way - after watching it, I ordered myself a copy.

But rather, a thoughtful, small-scale film, focusing on a small group of men from both sides of the Civil War.  I've seen a number of reviews saying how far-fetched the plot was - nonsense!  It's a known fact that Union & Confederate soldiers often met during lulls in the fighting to exchange supplies and swap stories. Who's to say that something along the lines of this movie didn't happen!  At any rate, rather than focusing on battle scenes, instead it focuses on individual soldiers and what was going on in their own lives.  The opening 10 minutes of the movie says so much with no dialogue, sets up the story, and is quite moving.

781485,A3373I4II32NA1,B0000E6FNK,Tyler,"[0, 0]","What would've been REALLY good with this movie is some English captioning. I mean, really, you're going to offer SPANISH subtitles to a movie where Americans were involved fighting other Americans?I've always been fascinated by the Wilderness campaign that was fought in Virginia in 2 days of May, 1864, fought in 70 square miles of shrubs and trees and brush that had previously shed the blood of 13,000 Confederates and 16,000 Yankees in the Chancellorsville fighting exactly one year earlier, and then causing another 11,000 Confederates and 17,600 Yankees to be killed or wounded in this same area. But I've barely been able to put a description to the fighting until this movie came out, and I had to wait a hell of a long time to order it because the price was too high. 80 BUCKS for a single DVD? So I waited until it was below $5 before ordering.The story centers around 6 different men, Yankees and Confederates, who have somehow survived 3 years of bloody fighting, so while their regiments tear each other to pieces in the close-hand fighting, these men wander through the woods at night and come across each other, finally deciding after some hesitation to sit down, have a meal, and talk to each other about their lives, never seeming to know that each group of 3 men is actually from the opposing side. I mean, REALLY? You can't detect their uniform color around the campfire or their different accents? I would've taken a star down for that, but as the movie continued, I realized that the men didn't really seem to care how the other looked or sounded, because they all had the same kinds of hopes and dreams that they shared with each other.Then BAM...the daylight comes and the men wake up to realize who the others really are. It looks like quite a standoff for a while, the other side threatening to take the others captive, but then the fighting breaks out among the six men and who will survive? None of them apparently, as they find out that the Yankee and Confederate troops are fighting each other again on the second day of battle, and since they're caught BETWEEN the opposing lines, all six men eventually end up being killed, mostly from the volleys of gunfire being exchanged from both armies.Kind of a sad ending, but brilliant descriptions of the battle were put into this movie! So in the end, it deserved 5 stars for the creativity that was put into the scenes.
