The fragility of life exposed in ""St. Elsewhere"" took a gigantic leap forward in ""ER"", producing perhaps THE best television medical drama of our time.  Now comes ""HawthoRNe"", a new story told from the perspective of a Chief Nursing Officer.  I have followed this show from concept write-ups to TNT cable promotion, and I believe ""HawthoRNe"" to be the next BIG hit for the medical drama genre.
