1112104,A2YNCP8VCVREDF,B000WTVZG2,"G. Canna ""Broadway is Life""","[1, 1]","""Saving Sarah Cain"" has an arresting premise -- what if a worldly, self-absorbed New Yorker  (I'm assuming that's what the city is) was forced to become legal guardian to her five nieces and nephews -- who happened to be Amish? The contrasting values and lifestyles between her and her wards would conceivably make a first-rate comedy-drama. Unfortunately, this film takes that potential and throws it away, saddling it with forced, stilted dialogue, a director who casts a gloom over the whole project, and hiring mediocre actors and actresses. The only exceptions are Abigail Mason as Lyddie, the oldest child who takes the position that if it isn't Amish, the siblings will have  nothing whatever to do with it, and Danielle Chuchran Anna Mae, the middle girl who finds herself torn between the way she was raised and her attraction to a secular lifestyle. Elliot Gould also turned in a first-rate performance, but that goes without saying.Unfortunately, the rest of the cast gives performances that are either at or below average. True, this is mostly through no fault of their own -- despite the screenwriters' attempts, the supporting characters never veer beyond stereotypes. The children are admirably fleshed out, often at the expense of Sarah Cain (a pity, because she's the film's eponymous heroine) -- although whether that's the fault of the writers, director, or actress is difficult to determine.Basically, ""Saving Sarah Cain"" is not completely without merit, but it's still hard for me to recommend that someone spend two hours watching it when they could be watching a much better movie.If it's a decent Christian film you're after, you're much better off ""Saving Sarah Cain"" for later, and putting on ""Facing the Giants"" instead, a film so well-crafted one may well think it's an award-winning, studio-produced indie drama instead of a ridiculously low-budget church project.",2,Great premise ruined,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,1893,"['Saving', 'Sarah', 'Cain', 'arresting', 'premise', 'what', 'worldly', 'self-absorbed', 'New', 'Yorker', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'what', 'city', 'was', 'forced', 'become', 'legal', 'guardian', 'five', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'Amish', 'contrasting', 'values', 'lifestyles', 'wards', 'would', 'conceivably', 'make', 'first-rate', 'comedy-drama', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'potential', 'away', 'saddling', 'forced', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'director', 'who', 'gloom', 'whole', 'project', 'hiring', 'mediocre', 'actors', 'actresses', 'only', 'exceptions', 'are', 'Abigail', 'Mason', 'Lyddie', 'oldest', 'child', 'who', 'position', ""n't"", 'Amish', 'siblings', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Danielle', 'Chuchran', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'middle', 'girl', 'who', 'torn', 'way', 'was', 'raised', 'attraction', 'secular', 'lifestyle', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'also', 'turned', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'saying.Unfortunately', 'rest', 'cast', 'performances', 'are', 'average', 'True', 'mostly', 'fault', 'own', 'screenwriters', 'attempts', 'supporting', 'characters', 'never', 'veer', 'stereotypes', 'children', 'are', 'admirably', 'fleshed', 'out', 'often', 'expense', 'Sarah', 'Cain', 'pity', 'film', 'eponymous', 'heroine', 'fault', 'writers', 'director', 'actress', 'difficult', 'determine.Basically', 'Saving', 'Sarah', 'Cain', 'not', 'completely', 'merit', 'still', 'hard', 'recommend', 'someone', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'watching', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'much', 'better', 'movie.If', 'decent', 'Christian', 'film', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'much', 'better', 'Saving', 'Sarah', 'Cain', 'later', 'putting', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'instead', 'film', 'so', 'well-crafted', 'one', 'may', 'well', 'think', 'award-winning', 'studio-produced', 'indie', 'drama', 'instead', 'ridiculously', 'low-budget', 'church', 'project']",Saving Sarah Cain

To my pleasant surprise, it was a real good visual filter along with a nice storyline.Yes, its Christian (don't let the 1-star reviewers who hate the momentary cleavage drive you away, they can't see a good movie for a single moment), but it's nt like it's preaching to the choir stupid. In fact, thouh my great-grandmother was Amish (so my mom has more experience around her than I did), my mom never complained about a single moment wih the Amish family (actually, we all laughed at the Amish twist of the Wizard of Oz one-liner). And, though my family is devoutly Christian, we had nothing bad to say about the forementioned cleavage. For one, there's not enough to incite lust (at least, not for me and my brother), for another, even if it were, it's not there long enough (nor being camera-ogled) for me to consider fantasizing.

Instead of an outsider visiting an isolated religious community, members of that community visit the outside.I have long admired the Amish for their steadfast keeping of their faith in the midst of an alien world. And for their colorful traditions. In this movie we show the clash between the two worlds.The plot is somewhat predictable. A jaded columnist by a curious chain of circumstances, ends up as the guardian of an Amish family. The Amish learn to live among ""English"" and endure tests to their integrity with varying success. In the process, the collumnists, Sarah Cain, becomes a better and less cynical person. This plot has been seen a thousand times; that isn't really the point. It works because it is good when well done and it was well done here. It was a great movie.My favorite character was Lyddie the big sister.

1112115,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B000WTVZG2,J. SHARP,"[15, 15]","This adaptation of Beverly Lewis' novelThe Redemption of Sarah Cainis another commendable addition to the oeuvre of telefilm producer/director Michael Landon, Jr. Taking great liberties with the plot of the novel, the picture turns the usualWitness-esque story of the 'English' trying to adapt to the life of the Amish on its head. It places the devout orphans of the protagonist's recently departed sister in the heart of a major city and explores the effect it has on their hearts and their family dynamic.The beginning of the film is worrisome due to extremely clunky dialogue that sounds like it was cobbled from a book of movie journalism cliches. All the editor (played with sorely-needed light humor by Elliott Gould ofM*A*S*HandOcean's 11fame) needed was a cigar to chomp on and he'd be straight out of a comic strip.Fortunately, things improve dramatically once Sarah Cain starts interacting earnestly with her sister's children. Landon's skill at drawing convincing performances from kids is highlighted throughout the rest of the film and, by the end, YOU may want to adopt some of them! And leading lady Lisa Pepper (of Anthony Hopkins' indie filmSlipstream) is frequently good and shows great potential for success. She's very easy on the eyes (it's part of the Hollywood equation, folks) and definitely plays well opposite children.My favorite part may be the flashback sequence at the end.

As another reviewer commented, that scene was ""beautiful, ethereal, evocative, and expertly photographed and edited"", and if not the rest of the film, this sequence is worth watching again and again.  It is too bad the rest of the movie wasn't more subtle in its emotion (as in the case when Sarah, along with boyfriend, Bryan, and the children have returned to Sarah's stark and modern condominium in Portland, Oregon, after the children find out Sarah has been publishing stories about them in her column (it's too bad we didn't get to read any of them).  It's not that the kids cry (I mean, they just lost their mother, and before they had time to fully absorb that, they were whisked away to the West Coast--the loony left--and forward about a hundred and fifty years), it's that they overdid it.  That scene was not effective because I didn't cry (and I usually bawl my eyes out), but this had little effect on me.The script could have been punched up a little bit (more interesting, like including some of Sarah's columns and more of the Amish beliefs and way of life, and a lot more humor instead of just lightheartedness).My heart sank into my stomach when I saw that man at the bus station approach little Josiah who had run away.  Sadly, because of the bleeding heart liberal society we live in, I automatically think pedophile, but, I think it turned out he was just a crazy man (because of the nonsense the man was spouting, I would guess a Vietnam War veteran).  Thank God!I think all the children did a wonderful job, stealing the candlelight from Lisa Pepper, though she was by far the best-looking.  Tom Tate, the guy who played Bryan, was excellent.The only really cheesy line was when Caleb, upon first entering Sarah's upscale condo, utters, ""We're not in Pennsylvania anymore.""This film could have definitely benefited from laughs (instead of just smiles) and from a better soundtrack and score--both of which are very forgettable.The major plus of this mildly touching film was that it followed the great rule of writing:  show, don't tell.  Most Christian films lack subtlety in their proselytizing, thus alienating some viewers and diminishing its entertainment value.  ""Saving"" did not.  That automatically makes it much better than the asinine ""Left Behind"" features, not to mention the annoying Kirk Cameron.Another good recommendation is ""Joshua"", even though it's not really Biblical (Joshua is Jesus who comes to this small town like an angel to help build a church, when it says in the Bible that when He comes back, it will be with loud acclaim, or something along those verses, and He tells the Pope to keep up with the good work, which many Protestants would raise Cain, or hellfire, over).",3,Sarah Cain's Redemption,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,2902,"['Two', 'stars', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'extra', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'flashback', 'scene', 'Sarah', 'older', 'sister', 'Ivy', 'children', 'frolicking', 'seashore', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'scene', 'was', 'beautiful', 'ethereal', 'evocative', 'expertly', 'photographed', 'edited', 'not', 'rest', 'film', 'sequence', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'too', 'bad', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'subtle', 'emotion', 'case', 'when', 'Sarah', 'boyfriend', 'Bryan', 'children', 'have', 'returned', 'Sarah', 'stark', 'modern', 'condominium', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'children', 'find', 'out', 'Sarah', 'been', 'publishing', 'stories', 'column', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'read', 'not', 'kids', 'cry', 'mean', 'just', 'lost', 'mother', 'had', 'time', 'fully', 'absorb', 'were', 'whisked', 'away', 'West', 'Coast', 'loony', 'left', 'forward', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'years', 'overdid', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'effective', 'did', ""n't"", 'cry', 'usually', 'bawl', 'eyes', 'out', 'had', 'little', 'effect', 'me.The', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'punched', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'including', 'Sarah', 'columns', 'more', 'Amish', 'beliefs', 'way', 'life', 'lot', 'more', 'humor', 'instead', 'just', 'lightheartedness', 'heart', 'sank', 'stomach', 'when', 'saw', 'man', 'bus', 'station', 'approach', 'little', 'Josiah', 'who', 'had', 'run', 'away', 'Sadly', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'liberal', 'society', 'live', 'automatically', 'think', 'pedophile', 'think', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'crazy', 'man', 'nonsense', 'man', 'was', 'spouting', 'would', 'guess', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'veteran', 'Thank', 'God', 'think', 'children', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'stealing', 'candlelight', 'Lisa', 'Pepper', 'was', 'far', 'best-looking', 'Tom', 'Tate', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Bryan', 'was', 'excellent.The', 'only', 'really', 'cheesy', 'line', 'was', 'when', 'Caleb', 'first', 'entering', 'Sarah', 'upscale', 'condo', 'utters', ""'re"", 'not', 'Pennsylvania', 'anymore', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'definitely', 'benefited', 'laughs', 'instead', 'just', 'smiles', 'better', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'are', 'very', 'forgettable.The', 'major', 'plus', 'mildly', 'touching', 'film', 'was', 'followed', 'great', 'rule', 'writing', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Most', 'Christian', 'films', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'proselytizing', 'thus', 'alienating', 'viewers', 'diminishing', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Saving', 'did', 'not', 'automatically', 'much', 'better', 'asinine', 'Left', 'Behind', 'features', 'not', 'mention', 'annoying', 'Kirk', 'Cameron.Another', 'good', 'recommendation', 'Joshua', 'even', 'not', 'really', 'Biblical', 'Joshua', 'Jesus', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'angel', 'help', 'build', 'church', 'when', 'Bible', 'when', 'back', 'will', 'be', 'loud', 'acclaim', 'something', 'verses', 'Pope', 'keep', 'up', 'good', 'work', 'many', 'Protestants', 'would', 'raise', 'Cain', 'hellfire']",Saving Sarah Cain

It is a well-made movie with strong redemption themes. Sarah Cain is given custody of her nieces and nephews when her sister dies. However, there is a huge difference between Sarah's life and the life her sister led. Sarah is on the fast track as a journalist in Portland, Oregon. She has only herself to worry about and is set on being a well-known syndicated columnist. Her sister, Ivy, on the other hand, had joined the Amish and her main focus was her family.When Sarah receives the news, she has no idea how her five Amish nieces and nephews are going to fit into her neat and tidy self-absorbed life. Add into the mix Sarah's dysfunctional upbringing and her dedicated fiance, who wants nothing more than to marry Sarah and spend his life with her.  So Sarah decides to bring her nieces and nephews to Portland - away from the life they've known. How will this affect them?This movie has many great discussion opportunities. Among them are greed, selfishness, temptation, following the crowd, death, and what's really important in life. Is it money and a career? Or is the little lives an adult can shape and mold for God's glory?Younger children will not understand the plot and will likely be frightened by the death of the mom (although how she died is not shown). Therefore, I would highly recommend it for those ages tween to adult. This is a movie that will stick with you long after you've watched it.

Considering the unlikely premise, this had all the makings of just another manipulative barf bag of Hollywood drivel. But in the sensitive hands of Michael Landon, Jr., it speaks to the audience with the voice of truth. Can I single out one performance above all the others? No way. The kids are wonderful, Elliott Gould hits a home run, Tom Tate is convincing and likable in a thankless supporting role, and Lisa Pepper is absolutely &#34;real,&#34; causing us to see her character as an actual human being instead of a screen persona. Resembling a young Jennifer Aniston, she knows just how far to take her character before crossing the line into screen histrionics. Terrific! Mark McKenzie's music, while not quite reaching the sublime heights of &#34;The Last Sin Eater&#34; (2007) is lovely and unobtrusive, at times punctuating the dramatic moments with a light and never maudlin touch. Even the high school students are not the expected stereotypes. It is clear that Landon set out to craft a special film of honesty, solid values, and cinematic integrity, and he succeeded brilliantly on all counts. I recommend &#34;Saving Sarah Cain&#34; without reservation.",5,Hits All the Right Buttons,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,1379,"['one', 'powerful', 'movie', 'somehow', 'transcend', 'wide', 'chasm', 'mainstream', 'message', 'acting', 'superb', 'writing', 'fresh', 'believable', 'production', 'qualities', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Considering', 'unlikely', 'premise', 'had', 'makings', 'just', 'manipulative', 'barf', 'bag', 'Hollywood', 'drivel', 'sensitive', 'hands', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'audience', 'voice', 'truth', 'Can', 'single', 'out', 'one', 'performance', 'others', 'way', 'kids', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'home', 'run', 'Tom', 'Tate', 'convincing', 'likable', 'thankless', 'supporting', 'role', 'Lisa', 'Pepper', 'absolutely', '34', 'real', '34', 'causing', 'see', 'character', 'actual', 'human', 'being', 'instead', 'screen', 'persona', 'Resembling', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'take', 'character', 'crossing', 'line', 'screen', 'histrionics', 'Terrific', 'Mark', 'McKenzie', 'music', 'not', 'quite', 'reaching', 'sublime', 'heights', '34', 'Last', 'Sin', 'Eater', '34', '2007', 'lovely', 'unobtrusive', 'times', 'punctuating', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'light', 'never', 'maudlin', 'touch', 'Even', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'are', 'not', 'expected', 'stereotypes', 'clear', 'Landon', 'set', 'out', 'craft', 'special', 'film', 'honesty', 'solid', 'values', 'cinematic', 'integrity', 'succeeded', 'brilliantly', 'counts', 'recommend', '34', 'Saving', 'Sarah', 'Cain', '34', 'reservation']",Saving Sarah Cain

Her sister and children were Amish, so on top of everything, there are strong cultural differences.This is a powerful story about selfless love, a higher call than simply what we personally want.  I found it very touching emotionally and inspiring to live for other's sake.  We desperately need these reminders in today's culture.I was surprised in this movie however, that it appeared that the Amish culture portrayed here was touched with more modern influences, than I had expected.I highly recommend this movie, it was powerful and thought provoking.",5,Saving Sarah Cain review DVD,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,798,"['story', 'how', 'modern', 'day', 'single', 'journalist', 'who', 'only', 'ambition', 'was', 'career', 'own', 'selfish', 'desires', 'life', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'legal', 'guardian', '5', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'sister', 'died', 'sister', 'children', 'were', 'Amish', 'so', 'top', 'everything', 'are', 'strong', 'cultural', 'differences.This', 'powerful', 'story', 'selfless', 'love', 'higher', 'call', 'simply', 'what', 'personally', 'want', 'found', 'very', 'touching', 'emotionally', 'inspiring', 'live', 'other', 'sake', 'desperately', 'need', 'reminders', 'today', 'culture.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'movie', 'however', 'appeared', 'Amish', 'culture', 'portrayed', 'here', 'was', 'touched', 'more', 'modern', 'influences', 'had', 'expected.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'was', 'powerful', 'thought', 'provoking']",Saving Sarah Cain
