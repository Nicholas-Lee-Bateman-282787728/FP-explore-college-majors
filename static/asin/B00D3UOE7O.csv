1653506,A2S8DZ2ZEPQ3L6,B00D3UOE7O,Aria Araya,"[0, 0]","A long overdue wait for a concert DVD of Miss Uniderwood! I never followed Carrie's career as I only own her first album ""Some Hearts"". I'm not much into todays country, as I was more into the 90's country, like Leann Rimes, Martina McBride, Lila McCann, etc. So I only knew 2 tracks on this concert DVD when purchasing it. Being from Oklahoma also and following her on the ""Idol"" show is why I got Carrie's first album. When playing this DVD, I loved every track of it. Surprisingly, my favorites were from Carrie's ""Blown Away"" album. The whole concert on this DVD is excellent in picture quality, being in widescreen, and 5.1 surround. I love all 4 videos included from Carrie's ""Blown Away"" album, and comes with behind-the scenes and interviews which I have not viewed yet. This is a great DVD that will BLOW you AWAY!",5,"Finally...A DVD Of Carrie, And I Was BLOWN AWAY ! ! !",1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,823,"['long', 'overdue', 'wait', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Miss', 'Uniderwood', 'never', 'followed', 'Carrie', 'career', 'only', 'own', 'first', 'album', 'Hearts', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'todays', 'country', 'was', 'more', '90', 'country', 'Leann', 'Rimes', 'Martina', 'McBride', 'Lila', 'McCann', 'etc', 'only', 'knew', '2', 'tracks', 'concert', 'DVD', 'when', 'purchasing', 'Being', 'Oklahoma', 'also', 'following', 'Idol', 'show', 'why', 'got', 'Carrie', 'first', 'album', 'When', 'playing', 'DVD', 'loved', 'track', 'Surprisingly', 'favorites', 'were', 'Carrie', 'Blown', 'Away', 'album', 'whole', 'concert', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'being', 'widescreen', '5.1', 'surround', 'love', '4', 'videos', 'included', 'Carrie', 'Blown', 'Away', 'album', 'behind-the', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'have', 'not', 'viewed', 'yet', 'great', 'DVD', 'will', 'BLOW', 'AWAY']",The Blown Away Tour: LIVE

Pfleeger,"[0, 0]",I would not normally have purchaseda DVD by an American Idol winner but Carrie Underwood was chosen to be the musical entertainment for an organization I belong to so I thought that I would check this out to get familiar with her music. After watching I have to admit that I was impressed.The concert filmed in Souther Caliornia features twnty of Carrie's hits performed in front of a packed house. The vocals are strong thoughout and I found myself gaining more and more respect for the young singer. In a world of throw away pop starsCarrie stands out as the real deal.The standard definition disc features the concer and several bonus features relating to the concert. Also included are four music videos from the tour. The only smallquibble with this release is that it does not seem to be available on Blu ray which is a shame because this is a really interesting show which would really shine in high definition.Well recommended.,4,This Was A Great Show,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,935,"['would', 'not', 'normally', 'have', 'purchaseda', 'DVD', 'American', 'Idol', 'winner', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'was', 'chosen', 'be', 'musical', 'entertainment', 'organization', 'belong', 'so', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'get', 'familiar', 'music', 'watching', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'impressed.The', 'concert', 'filmed', 'Souther', 'Caliornia', 'twnty', 'Carrie', 'hits', 'performed', 'front', 'packed', 'house', 'vocals', 'are', 'strong', 'found', 'gaining', 'more', 'more', 'respect', 'young', 'singer', 'world', 'throw', 'away', 'pop', 'starsCarrie', 'out', 'real', 'deal.The', 'standard', 'definition', 'disc', 'concer', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'relating', 'concert', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'four', 'music', 'videos', 'tour', 'only', 'smallquibble', 'release', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'available', 'Blu', 'ray', 'shame', 'really', 'interesting', 'show', 'would', 'really', 'shine', 'high', 'definition.Well', 'recommended']",The Blown Away Tour: LIVE

Was hoping they filmed  the Play On Tour and release that, but I gave up waiting. That was a much better stage production than the Blown Away tour. This video concert of the Blown Away tour is really amazing looking on DVD (where is the blu ray?) but the sound is lacking. It sounds tiny with no bass what so ever. I cranked up both my subwoofers and manipulated the surround sound to get it to sound decent. It should come off the disc with plenty of oomph for such a dynamic show. Interesting special features (behind the scenes and conceptual videos from Blown Away) and image gallery. The concert is 100 minutes and is packed with Carrie's great singing. I would prefer a more of variety, but it is to promote Blown Away album. The disc is split into four acts (wardrobe changes) plus encores. The video is 16:9 with only Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Too bad there is no DTS track to make it sound better. The disc is dual layered DVD-9,  region free, NTSC, made in Europe (wonder why it wasn't made in the states?). Just glad to get this magnificent performer on a concert DVD after all this time. Just wished the sound was better for today's sound systems. For ten bucks, who's complaining?",5,FINALLY!!

Also, until I saw her in the movie, &#34;Soul Surfer&#34;, I had never even heard of Carrie Underwood.  I love this concert DVD for many reasons.  The set-list, which is broken up into 4 different acts, as well as the fact that, when Carrie disappears below the stage after each act for one of her many costume changes, the band members, who play awesomely well, never stop playing.  Plus, I love the backdrops for each song, some of which are animated.  Also, during the 3rd act, I love how Carrie & her guitar players are on this platform that rises above the audience!  I also love the fact that, with the exception of &#34;Jesus, Take The Wheel&#34; in the 2nd act and &#34;See You Again&#34; in the 4th act, which get me very emotional, all of her songs that she performs puts me in a good mood.

She's a diva, but a classy one, and the this is the only live concert I have on DVD where the lead singer's voice doesn't get lost in the noise. You could debate that all the other singers fell victims of bad acoustics or bad mixing, but I think Carrie Underwood just has a better voice than most. She also is one of the few singers that sound the same wether they're singing live or in the studio. How many times have you heard a singer live and left disappointed because their amazing sounding performance from the studio is only mediocre live? This is not the case with Carrie, what you see is what you get, and it's a breath of fresh hair.

But the sound system on which this concert was recorded is terrible. There is constant echo and reverberation, for whatever reason. And beyond that, Carrie's microphone seemed to be on too low a volume to overcome the band behind her, so that, though many of Carrie's songs, you cannot really hear Carrie's singing, as well as you would like. Admittedly, this may be pretty accurate to how the concert sounded to the audience in attendance. But that audience had the live experience to compensate for whatever sound deficiencies there might have been.Those of us who are buying a concert DVD deserve to have something a little more professionally recorded than this DVD was. I don't know the ""ins and outs"" of recording live CDs and DVDs from concert venues. But I suspect that there must be some sort of direct feed into the recording equipment, order to avoid this very problem.I have seen a lot of live concerts--rock, folk, jazz, country. And I have bought even more concert DVDs and CDs. I would regrettably have to say that this was one of the worst sound produced concert DVDs that I have ever heard.",2,Dissapointing Sound System,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1225,"['could', 'not', 'good', 'conscience', 'recommend', 'concert', 'DVD', 'anyone.Carrie', 'Underwood', 'excellent', 'great', 'sound', 'system', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'terrible', 'constant', 'echo', 'reverberation', 'reason', 'Carrie', 'microphone', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'low', 'volume', 'overcome', 'band', 'though', 'many', 'Carrie', 'songs', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'hear', 'Carrie', 'singing', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'like', 'Admittedly', 'may', 'be', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'how', 'concert', 'sounded', 'audience', 'attendance', 'audience', 'had', 'live', 'experience', 'compensate', 'sound', 'deficiencies', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'been.Those', 'who', 'are', 'buying', 'concert', 'DVD', 'deserve', 'have', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'professionally', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ins', 'outs', 'recording', 'live', 'CDs', 'DVDs', 'concert', 'venues', 'suspect', 'must', 'be', 'sort', 'direct', 'feed', 'recording', 'equipment', 'order', 'avoid', 'very', 'problem.I', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'live', 'concerts', 'rock', 'folk', 'jazz', 'country', 'have', 'bought', 'even', 'more', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'CDs', 'would', 'regrettably', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'sound', 'produced', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'have', 'ever', 'heard']",The Blown Away Tour: LIVE
