The fact that they use toys I grew up with to do the animation is awesome.

There are some sketches wich I find brilliant but overall that is not the case, It's still robot chicken and I have to say that the production has improved greatly.

Well, on ""Robot Chicken"" you'll see all of them again and also much more. Is it still fun after five seasons ? You bet it still is!Congrats to Seth Green and the R.C. crew for lasting so long while still remaining funny & wacky as hell.

1454007,AA78TCLHXPJOK,B005CHTXWC,Timothy G. Berntsen,"[17, 20]","I am a huge fan of Robot Chicken, and I still love the show. Season 5 is stil the Robot Chicken we know and love, although as far as this show goes I'd say this season is weaker than past seasons. The humor in this season is WAY more morbid than in past seasons, an not really as clever as the show has been in years past. Ether sketch this season seems to end with the characters being viscerally disemboweled, and even by this show's standards the humor in these episodes is a lot more vulgar. For some fans this is going to be hilarious, but for my personal tastes I thought Robot Chicken was at it best when it wasn't relying as heavily on base humor for laughs. In some ways, I almost miss the censor bleeps and pixelated nudity from older episodes, because frankly there's so much swearing and nudity in season 5 that it becomes distracting (which might be in the show's favor, since the actual writing in Season 5 isn't as good as earlier seasons).Don't get me wrong-- season 5 is still a lot of laughs and makes some great pop culture jokes, and if you are a fan of the show it's still a must buy. However, I hope that going forward Robot Chicken doesn't continue in this direction, because eventually it can only end up with the show relying solely on obscenity to be funny, and that is not what made this show great. I guess every show that lasts this long is going to have growing pains, but I really hope that for Robot Chicken we're still a few years away from a true ""jump the shark"" moment (as if anything with this show would be absurd enough to make me tune out).",4,"It's still Robot Chicken, but it's having a bit of a mean streak",1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,1580,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'still', 'love', 'show', 'Season', '5', 'stil', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'know', 'love', 'as', 'far', 'show', ""'d"", 'say', 'season', 'weaker', 'past', 'seasons', 'humor', 'season', 'WAY', 'more', 'morbid', 'past', 'seasons', 'not', 'really', 'as', 'clever', 'show', 'been', 'years', 'past', 'Ether', 'sketch', 'season', 'end', 'characters', 'being', 'viscerally', 'disemboweled', 'even', 'show', 'standards', 'humor', 'episodes', 'lot', 'more', 'vulgar', 'fans', 'going', 'be', 'hilarious', 'personal', 'tastes', 'thought', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'was', 'best', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'relying', 'heavily', 'base', 'humor', 'laughs', 'ways', 'almost', 'miss', 'censor', 'bleeps', 'pixelated', 'nudity', 'older', 'episodes', 'frankly', 'so', 'much', 'swearing', 'nudity', 'season', '5', 'distracting', 'might', 'be', 'show', 'favor', 'actual', 'writing', 'Season', '5', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'earlier', 'seasons', '.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'season', '5', 'still', 'lot', 'laughs', 'great', 'pop', 'culture', 'jokes', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'still', 'must', 'buy', 'However', 'hope', 'going', 'forward', 'Robot', 'Chicken', ""n't"", 'continue', 'direction', 'eventually', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'show', 'relying', 'solely', 'obscenity', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'guess', 'show', 'long', 'going', 'have', 'growing', 'pains', 'really', 'hope', 'Robot', 'Chicken', ""'re"", 'still', 'few', 'years', 'away', 'true', 'jump', 'shark', 'moment', 'anything', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'absurd', 'enough', 'make', 'tune', 'out']",N/A
