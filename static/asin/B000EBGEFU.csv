Like when the girls escape e see everything through the eyes of the drugged girl, the cameras moving side by side, everything is blurry, gave me a headache, then the burning of the dolls while flashing back and forth to the girl washing the blood off...more headache. The dolls well the whole story is explained through the dolls, if Im not mistaken I believe she kidnapped the two girls because she was neglected by females due to her sexuality (?) eventhough she was used by a male. May not make sense but had she kidnapped two men, I doubt anyone would have watched it. Also when the girls escape a full day goes by and we dont even see the kidnappers reaction to the missing girl (maybe it was unintentional, they probably didnt have anymore days left to shoot)The girls are somewhat attractive, the story has potential some improvements could have ben made, but Id rate it a C. Its worth a watch...I watched it online so its easier to enjoy films when their free ha.",4,not actually that bad,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,1106,"['Natalie', 'Laspina', 'better', 'brunette..just', 'thought', 'id', 'throw', 'there', 'film', 'have', 'boring', 'annoying', 'moments', 'when', 'girls', 'escape', 'e', 'see', 'everything', 'eyes', 'drugged', 'girl', 'cameras', 'moving', 'side', 'side', 'everything', 'blurry', 'gave', 'headache', 'then', 'burning', 'dolls', 'flashing', 'back', 'forth', 'girl', 'washing', 'blood', 'more', 'headache', 'dolls', 'well', 'whole', 'story', 'explained', 'dolls', 'Im', 'not', 'mistaken', 'believe', 'kidnapped', 'two', 'girls', 'was', 'neglected', 'females', 'due', 'sexuality', 'was', 'used', 'male', 'May', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'had', 'kidnapped', 'two', 'men', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'Also', 'when', 'girls', 'escape', 'full', 'day', 'dont', 'even', 'see', 'kidnappers', 'reaction', 'missing', 'girl', 'maybe', 'was', 'unintentional', 'probably', 'didnt', 'have', 'anymore', 'days', 'left', 'shoot', 'girls', 'are', 'somewhat', 'attractive', 'story', 'potential', 'improvements', 'could', 'have', 'ben', 'made', 'Id', 'rate', 'C.', 'worth', 'watch', 'watched', 'so', 'easier', 'enjoy', 'films', 'when', 'free', 'ha']",N/A

The plot can be believable, look at Jeffrey Dahmer, he would pick up male prostitutes, drug them, and cut them up. The girls are pretty,but kind of fall flat acting wise. The main character the ""Dominatrex"" was more or less playing on the psychological aspect of manipulation by fear and control. This movie was o.k. but I personally think men would like this a lot more than women. I would have given 2 and a half stars but I did not see that as an option.",3,I know a few guys who would like to see this.,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,684,"['read', 'summary', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'consider', 'good', 'movie', 'judge', 'case', 'curiosity', 'title', 'won', 'out..the', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'believable', 'look', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'male', 'prostitutes', 'drug', 'cut', 'up', 'girls', 'are', 'pretty', 'kind', 'fall', 'flat', 'acting', 'wise', 'main', 'character', 'Dominatrex', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'playing', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'manipulation', 'fear', 'control', 'movie', 'was', 'o.k', 'personally', 'think', 'men', 'would', 'like', 'lot', 'more', 'women', 'would', 'have', 'given', '2', 'half', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'option']",N/A

A woman draws to other women to her house, then tortures them and uses them as her sex slavesThe 'torture' is under-played.

971375,ALRNOZUVL3AOT,B000EBGEFU,Pen Name,"[22, 27]","OK, there's something kinky about a psychotic young women kidnapping two other girls to rape them.  I didn't expect any kind of a serious story, so at least in that I wasn't disappointed.  But the potential eroticism was ruined by the lame attempt to PRETEND this was a serious look at rape.  They should have made it campy.  Then maybe at least it would have been fun to watch.The crazy rapist girl makes a fairly good effort at acting demented, but her physical attraction to the lovely bodies of her kidnap victims was unconvincing and forced.  She'd kind of hesitantly touch them, but you could tell she was just following the poorly-written script.  One of her victims was a pretty American girl; the other was a foreign-accented girl whose very inclusion in this video was a mystery to me.  This film should have been a one-on-one encounter.Again, I wouldn't have even rented this one had it been about a male rapist, but the girl-on-girl element was mostly wasted due to a lame script and weak direction.  But I hope they try again as the very idea of a girl kidnapping another girl for her pleasure is a good one!",2,"Disappointing - not particularly interesting and not erotic, either",1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,1121,"['OK', 'something', 'kinky', 'psychotic', 'young', 'women', 'kidnapping', 'two', 'other', 'girls', 'rape', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'kind', 'serious', 'story', 'so', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'potential', 'eroticism', 'was', 'ruined', 'lame', 'attempt', 'PRETEND', 'was', 'serious', 'look', 'rape', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'campy', 'Then', 'maybe', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'crazy', 'rapist', 'girl', 'fairly', 'good', 'effort', 'acting', 'demented', 'physical', 'attraction', 'lovely', 'bodies', 'kidnap', 'victims', 'was', 'unconvincing', 'forced', ""'d"", 'kind', 'hesitantly', 'touch', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'just', 'following', 'poorly-written', 'script', 'One', 'victims', 'was', 'pretty', 'American', 'girl', 'other', 'was', 'foreign-accented', 'girl', 'very', 'inclusion', 'video', 'was', 'mystery', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one-on-one', 'encounter.Again', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'rented', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'male', 'rapist', 'girl-on-girl', 'element', 'was', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'due', 'lame', 'script', 'weak', 'direction', 'hope', 'try', 'again', 'very', 'idea', 'girl', 'kidnapping', 'girl', 'pleasure', 'good', 'one']",N/A
971376,A2CO0TBEGUZCZP,B000EBGEFU,"Tom Goryssimo ""xploitation poet""","[19, 23]","Even though BILL ZEBUB's RAPE IS A CIRCLE has been made and released quite recently,it must be looked at like a soft, modern cross between a 70's JESS FRANCO's deviant sex romp and a ROUGHIE or a KINKY flick from the 60's. Don't expect some sort of great RAPE  REVENGE classic or you'll be pissed, believe me.What you got here is an arty/exploitation movie with a sexy psycho chick abducting two poor girls to rape and torture them. It sounds great but ask me : Is there any blood flowing ? not quite, the torture is mostly talked about and/or off screen. Are there plenty of dirty sex scenes ? only a few very tame ones but there is some nudity though.So why in hell do I give that flick 3 stars ?! Well... First of all, the dialogues are twisted and touching. For instance, the part where the psycho talks about her being rejected all of her life is heart breaking and the same goes with the scene in wich the two abducted friends realize their friendship is dead because of what they've been trough. Then, the actors are pretty good (especially NATALIE LASPINA who portrays the psycho) at giving depth to their characters even though the plot is basic to say the least (it's all about being raped and revenged for ever, you know... THE CIRCLE OF RAPE). But most of all, I love that flik for its weird twisted atmosphere, its crazy ideas (all the scenes involving the Barbies are strangely effective), its great hypnotising overused music and,last but not least, something that no reviewers talked about, its MEANING. Rape really is a circle, a never ending circle of pain that started way back where we were still monkeys and goes on as I'm writting that damn review. Killing someone is taking his life, raping someone is taking his soul.So I don't care if it's exploitation, if to some people it's a cheaply made video shot piece of trash, to me it's art just like DORIS WISHMAN's BAD GIRLS GO TO HELL or BARRY MAHON's SEX KILLER are. By the way, I'm sure that it's flicks like RAPE IS A CIRCLE that will be re-released by the SOMETHING WEIRD VIDEO of the future. It's not vintage exploitation now but wait until it is and you'll see that some people will start looking at gems like this differently, finally getting over the fact that CULT MOVIES can be shot on a cheap video camera.",3,CIRCLE OF FIRE,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,2288,"['Even', 'BILL', 'ZEBUB', 'RAPE', 'A', 'CIRCLE', 'been', 'made', 'released', 'quite', 'recently', 'must', 'be', 'looked', 'soft', 'modern', 'cross', '70', 'JESS', 'FRANCO', 'deviant', 'sex', 'romp', 'ROUGHIE', 'KINKY', 'flick', '60', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sort', 'great', 'RAPE', 'REVENGE', 'classic', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pissed', 'believe', 'got', 'here', 'arty/exploitation', 'movie', 'sexy', 'psycho', 'chick', 'abducting', 'two', 'poor', 'girls', 'rape', 'torture', 'great', 'ask', 'blood', 'flowing', 'not', 'quite', 'torture', 'mostly', 'talked', 'and/or', 'screen', 'Are', 'there', 'plenty', 'dirty', 'sex', 'scenes', 'only', 'few', 'very', 'tame', 'ones', 'nudity', 'though.So', 'why', 'hell', 'do', 'give', 'flick', '3', 'stars', 'Well', 'First', 'all', 'dialogues', 'are', 'twisted', 'touching', 'instance', 'part', 'where', 'psycho', 'talks', 'being', 'rejected', 'life', 'heart', 'breaking', 'same', 'scene', 'wich', 'two', 'abducted', 'friends', 'realize', 'friendship', 'dead', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trough', 'Then', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'NATALIE', 'LASPINA', 'who', 'psycho', 'giving', 'depth', 'characters', 'even', 'plot', 'basic', 'say', 'least', 'being', 'raped', 'revenged', 'ever', 'know', 'THE', 'CIRCLE', 'OF', 'RAPE', 'most', 'love', 'flik', 'weird', 'twisted', 'atmosphere', 'crazy', 'ideas', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Barbies', 'are', 'strangely', 'effective', 'great', 'hypnotising', 'overused', 'music', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'something', 'reviewers', 'talked', 'about', 'MEANING', 'Rape', 'really', 'circle', 'never', 'ending', 'circle', 'pain', 'started', 'way', 'back', 'where', 'were', 'still', 'monkeys', ""'m"", 'writting', 'damn', 'review', 'Killing', 'someone', 'taking', 'life', 'raping', 'someone', 'taking', 'soul.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'exploitation', 'people', 'cheaply', 'made', 'video', 'shot', 'piece', 'trash', 'art', 'just', 'DORIS', 'WISHMAN', 'BAD', 'GIRLS', 'GO', 'TO', 'HELL', 'BARRY', 'MAHON', 'SEX', 'KILLER', 'are', 'way', ""'m"", 'sure', 'flicks', 'RAPE', 'A', 'CIRCLE', 'will', 'be', 're-released', 'SOMETHING', 'WEIRD', 'VIDEO', 'future', 'not', 'vintage', 'exploitation', 'now', 'wait', ""'ll"", 'see', 'people', 'will', 'start', 'looking', 'gems', 'differently', 'finally', 'getting', 'fact', 'CULT', 'MOVIES', 'can', 'be', 'shot', 'cheap', 'video', 'camera']",N/A
