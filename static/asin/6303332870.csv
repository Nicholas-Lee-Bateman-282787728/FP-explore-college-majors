369715,A1IQVBGOYVEFBI,6303332870,Allan Brain,"[17, 21]","1969 is very special to me.  I graduated from high school, went to Woodstock,  and attended every anti-war event I could find. I would be inclined to watch any movie about this period, but when this one came on ""Tivo"" as a suggestion, I was skeptical. The Tivo guide gave it two stars and suggested that it was about nothing but a couple of guys doing dope on the road.It is actually a pretty powerful anti-war movie, with fine acting from Winona Ryder, Keifer Sutherland, and Robert Downey, Jr., who were big stars in the '80s and I am surprised this was not more of a box office hit for their presence in the cast.The scenes are realistic, portraying the happy-go-lucky yearsof hitchiking, campus protests, ""sensitivity"" and all that, andthe music is well-chosen for the most part.  I thought that there was a gratuitous homophobic scene early on, when the boys are picked up by a not-so-creepy slightly older hippie type and go ballistic, but even that scene is saved by the gay guy yelling out to them as they run away, ""I didn't know you were married!""Scott (Sutherland) is a thoughtful individualistic boy, very typical for the time, and you get the sense that his older brother, headed for Vietnam as a Marine, is not that different, but timing is everything.  Bruce Dern as the WWII veteran father is surprisingly convincing (I thought he could only play creepy types)  The story is fairly predictable but well done.Ryder is great playing ""Beth"" younger sister of the Downey character.  And what is it with these early Downey roles?  Art imitates life or is it vice-versa?  We see him here flipping out on LSD, running around almost naked, etc., same thing we see later in his performance as ""Julian"" in ""Less than Zero"".He's probably the finest of the actors in this film, but this is not his best role.  I thought Sutherland did better and, what's more, looked better.  He is the star of this movie.Too bad he is wasting his talent these days on Fox's tacky ""24"".Anyway, in any period piece, I am always on the lookout for realism in scenes, props, characters, hairstyles, clothes, you name it.  On first viewing, I thought this film did very well on most of those counts.Only the final scene is unrealistic.  This is supposedly set inMaryland in the early and late summer of 1969.  That is too early for the kind of consensus to develop about the war that is depicted, especially in a small town where only one kid has died in Vietnam.  (As I write this, the same kind of feeling about the Iraq war is only apparently developing in Vermont)I would have liked to see these characters attending Woodstock,as that would have fit into the story well. Also, as in the NBC television series ""American Dreams"", some depiction of what the older brother was seeing going on in Vietnam would have helped immensely.  So this is not quite up there with such brilliant and moving Vietnam films as ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" or ""Forrest Gump"", but it's a fine movie and if you are anti-war and a child of the '60s, you will love it.",4,"Surprisingly good and timely anti-war ""period piece""",1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,3045,"['1969', 'very', 'special', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'went', 'Woodstock', 'attended', 'anti-war', 'event', 'could', 'find', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'watch', 'movie', 'period', 'when', 'one', 'came', 'Tivo', 'suggestion', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Tivo', 'guide', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'suggested', 'was', 'nothing', 'couple', 'guys', 'doing', 'dope', 'road.It', 'actually', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'anti-war', 'movie', 'fine', 'acting', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'were', 'big', 'stars', ""'80s"", 'am', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'more', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'presence', 'cast.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'realistic', 'portraying', 'happy-go-lucky', 'yearsof', 'hitchiking', 'campus', 'protests', 'sensitivity', 'andthe', 'music', 'well-chosen', 'most', 'part', 'thought', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'homophobic', 'scene', 'early', 'when', 'boys', 'are', 'picked', 'up', 'not-so-creepy', 'slightly', 'older', 'hippie', 'type', 'go', 'ballistic', 'even', 'scene', 'saved', 'gay', 'guy', 'yelling', 'out', 'run', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'married', 'Scott', 'Sutherland', 'thoughtful', 'individualistic', 'boy', 'very', 'typical', 'time', 'get', 'sense', 'older', 'brother', 'headed', 'Vietnam', 'Marine', 'not', 'different', 'timing', 'everything', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'WWII', 'veteran', 'father', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'thought', 'could', 'only', 'play', 'creepy', 'types', 'story', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'well', 'done.Ryder', 'great', 'playing', 'Beth', 'younger', 'sister', 'Downey', 'character', 'what', 'early', 'Downey', 'roles', 'Art', 'life', 'vice-versa', 'see', 'here', 'flipping', 'out', 'LSD', 'running', 'around', 'almost', 'naked', 'etc.', 'same', 'thing', 'see', 'later', 'performance', 'Julian', 'Less', 'Zero', '.He', 'probably', 'finest', 'actors', 'film', 'not', 'best', 'role', 'thought', 'Sutherland', 'did', 'better', 'what', 'more', 'looked', 'better', 'star', 'movie.Too', 'bad', 'wasting', 'talent', 'days', 'Fox', 'tacky', '24', '.Anyway', 'period', 'piece', 'am', 'always', 'lookout', 'realism', 'scenes', 'props', 'characters', 'hairstyles', 'clothes', 'name', 'first', 'viewing', 'thought', 'film', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'most', 'counts.Only', 'final', 'scene', 'unrealistic', 'supposedly', 'set', 'inMaryland', 'early', 'late', 'summer', '1969', 'too', 'early', 'kind', 'consensus', 'develop', 'war', 'depicted', 'especially', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'only', 'one', 'kid', 'died', 'Vietnam', 'write', 'same', 'kind', 'feeling', 'Iraq', 'war', 'only', 'apparently', 'developing', 'Vermont', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'characters', 'attending', 'Woodstock', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'story', 'well', 'Also', 'NBC', 'television', 'series', 'American', 'Dreams', 'depiction', 'what', 'older', 'brother', 'was', 'seeing', 'going', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'immensely', 'not', 'quite', 'there', 'such', 'brilliant', 'moving', 'Vietnam', 'films', 'Platoon', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'fine', 'movie', 'are', 'anti-war', 'child', ""'60s"", 'will', 'love']",1969
369716,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6303332870,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[4, 6]","The Dawning of the Age of Aquarius? More like the yawning of the Age of Aquarius. Writer/Director Ernest Thompson has managed to make a very boring film about a year when EVERYTHING changed. There was Woodstock, but also Altamont. The My Lai massacre, and the Charles Manson Family murders. Nixon was inaugurated, and promptly began Operation Breakfast, the secret bombing of Cambodia. In court, Sirhan Sirhan admitted that he had killed presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. James Earl Ray confessed to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge on his way home from a party on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts. Mary Jo Kopechne died in the incident.The Brady Bunch premiered on ABC. In Berkeley an empty lot owned by the University was seized to form People's Park. The Stonewall Riot in New York marked the start of the gay rights movement. Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 were launched, dry run and dress rehearsal for the planned manned moon landing. The Apollo 11 landed on the moon, soon followed by the second moon landing by Apollo 12 that same year.David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" was a hit, even being used by the BBC for their broadcast of the moon walk. The Stooges released their eponymously titled first album, which featured a song entitled ""1969."" Led Zeppelin released their first and second albums that year. Creedence Clearwater Revival released their second, third, and fourth albums in 1969. Jim Morrison of the Doors was arrested for allegedly exposing himself during a show in Miami. Judy Garland died of an overdose of barbiturates. Brian Jones was found dead in his swimming pool a month after leaving The Rolling Stones. Dmitri Shostakovich composed Symphony No. 14, Op. 135, for soprano, bass, string orchestra and percussion.The Beatles gave their last public performance, on the roof of Apple Records. This impromptu concert was broken up by the police, as neighbors had complained of the noise. A film of the concert would be released entitled ""Let It Be."" The Beatles released Abby Road in 1969. In 1969 Paul married Linda and John married Yoko Ono.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the top grossing film of 1969, followed by The Love Bug. The third and fourth highest grossing films were Midnight Cowboy, which also won the Academy Award for best picture and best director, and Easy Rider. Gig Young won the Academy Award for best supporting actor in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? Bruce Dern, who plays Cliff, Scott's father in ""1969""  was also in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? as well as playing Keeg in The Cycle Savages that same year.The film, ""1969"" is more of a personal memoir than an historical chronicle. It takes place mostly in Maryland, in a small town that hadn't caught up with the changes of the 60's, even though the decade was almost over. It does manage to capture a bit of the flavor and events of 1969, but the story doesn't really go anywhere. Focusing on two friends, Scott (Kiefer Sutherland) and Ralph (Robert Downey Jr.) they enter college, mostly to escape being drafted and sent to Viet Nam. Scott's brother does go to Nam, and leaves Scott his car, which they sell to buy a van that they paint with psychedelic designs. At Ralph's sister Beth's High School graduation Beth (Winona Ryder), the valedictorian, gives a speech opposing the war in Viet Nam. Her speech gets mixed reviews, but the reaction is more positive than the one for Ralph's impromptu performance. Overdosed on LSD he strips and announces that he has flunked out of college.Bruce Dern plays Scott's father, Cliff. As a conservative veteran of World War II he is made to look more and more like a clown. There is a scene where they are at a school fair selling tickets to throw cream pies in Cliff's face. Scott's mother even says ""cream your father"" or did I imagine that? This is right where they learn that Scott's brother is missing in action. Does Dern ever look foolish. Foolish and sad.I suppose the point of ""1969"" was to show how the country gradually came to believe that the war was a mistake, but it didn't work so well. A romance between Scott and Beth has zero chemistry. They flee to Canada only to turn back, but why? Instead of giving us a compelling reason to care about the characters we are given sentimental speeches that go over about as well as Beth's valedictorian speech -- or Ralph's.Oh, well, in a film about 1969, there is plenty of good music to choose from. Though they are mentioned in the opening voice over narration, we never get to hear any Beatles. I guess Michael Jackson, who bought up their catalogue, wanted too much. There was still plenty of music from 1969 left over, and the following songs were on the soundtrack:""Wooden Ships"" performed by Crosby Stills & Nash, written by Crosby, Stills and Paul Kantner; ""Aquarius / Let The Sun Shine In"" performed by The Fifth Dimension; ""Goin' up the Country"" performed by Canned Heat; ""Time of the Season"" performed by The Zombies, written by Rod Argent; ""Green River"" performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival, written by John C.

Robert Downey Jr is fascinating to watch.  His character just seems like him.  Because he always plays drugged-out losers whose worlds are about to collapse, his movies always seem to be his autogiography, just like the old time-stars like Lana Turner or John Wayne.  Yet in this film Kiefer's the real star, and he isn't bad.  With his blond, blond hair he looks very much as though he might actually have been the son of Mariette Hartley.The anti war stuff was a little cimplified but good.  Winona makes a startling speech at her high school graduation, asking the crowd why we have to go fight a war that no one in the US actually understands.  Watching it today, we realize we should be asking ourselves these questions all over again.  I wonder if the movie might have been more of a success today than in 1988.  Ryder made this film right between BEETLEJUICE and HEATHERS, when she was still a giant star, and yet it barely saw release.Among the elders, Bruce Dern, Mariette Hartley and Joanna Cassidy are all excellent.  Joanna Cassidy isn't as lean and mean as she is on SIX FEET UNDER, she has more flesh on her, but she looks marvelous, like Claudia Cardinale playing a hippie.There's a scene where Sutherland's VW van, decked up in hippie colors, passes a convoy of soldier boys on a lonely highway, and Ryder leans out the window and makes the peace sign at them with a beatific smile.  At first the soldiers respond violently and obscenely and then, as more and more trucks are passed, the mood of the soldiers seems to shift and a few give the peace sign back.  Then more and more of them.  All the while on the soundtrack ""Wooden Ships"" is playing (the Jefferson Airplane version).

369722,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6303332870,William Timothy Lukeman,"[1, 1]","Here's a coming-of-age film from the 1980s that attempts to look back at the year 1969 via the clearly autobiographical reflections of writer/director Ernest Thompson. While it doesn't always succeed in truly capturing the zeitgeist of that time, occasionally lapsing into easy cliches instead, at its best it does convey much of the idealistic hope & heartbreaking fears of that pivotal year.Keifer Sutherland is the writer's surrogate, and he does a fine job of embodying the sensitivity & bewildering of a young man embracing the best of the counterculture. There's a sincerity here that really shines, made all the more poignant because we know how harshly time will deal with it. Robert Downey, Jr., as his best friend, is a bit more problematic -- always a charismatic presence, he still seems more 1980s than 1960s & never quite seems to inhabit his role. Winona Ryder as Downey's sister & Sutherland's eventual love is sweet, innocent, impassioned -- very much a girl of that time.The actors playing the parents are impressive: Bruce Dern & Mariette Hartley as Sutherland's conflicted family, and Joanna Cassidy as Downey's & Ryder's emotionally fraying mother, given to too-loud laughing in an effort to stave off fear & emptiness. Hartley is especially good, underplaying her role to perfection, her own fears bottled up tightly but still seeping out through the cracks in her facade.The story itself meanders, but that's part of the film's authentic charm. I was a teenager then myself, dreading the draft just as the film's protagonists did, and that sense of foreboding feels very real & true to me. The required countercultural scenes are wisely low-keyed, rather than over-the-top; genuine hippies were much more than the one-dimensional caricatures you see in contemporary presentations.Does it really deserve 4 out of 5 stars? That's a toss-up, to be honest. But I'm going with four stars because what it does get right is achingly honest. Besides, many of the questions it asks about war & peace, obedience to authority, and pursuing wholeness as an individual human being remain pertinent today. And as far too many want to flush that time down the memory hole, this modest film is all the more recommended!",4,Uneven but heartfelt film about an unjustly maligned era,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,2226,"['Here', 'coming-of-age', 'film', '1980s', 'attempts', 'look', 'back', 'year', '1969', 'clearly', 'autobiographical', 'reflections', 'writer/director', 'Ernest', 'Thompson', ""n't"", 'always', 'succeed', 'truly', 'capturing', 'zeitgeist', 'time', 'occasionally', 'lapsing', 'easy', 'cliches', 'instead', 'best', 'convey', 'much', 'idealistic', 'hope', 'heartbreaking', 'fears', 'pivotal', 'year.Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'writer', 'surrogate', 'fine', 'job', 'embodying', 'sensitivity', 'bewildering', 'young', 'man', 'embracing', 'best', 'counterculture', 'sincerity', 'here', 'really', 'shines', 'made', 'more', 'poignant', 'know', 'how', 'harshly', 'time', 'will', 'deal', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'best', 'friend', 'bit', 'more', 'problematic', 'always', 'charismatic', 'presence', 'still', 'more', '1980s', '1960s', 'never', 'quite', 'inhabit', 'role', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Downey', 'sister', 'Sutherland', 'eventual', 'love', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'impassioned', 'very', 'much', 'girl', 'time.The', 'actors', 'playing', 'parents', 'are', 'impressive', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Mariette', 'Hartley', 'Sutherland', 'conflicted', 'family', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'Downey', 'Ryder', 'emotionally', 'fraying', 'mother', 'given', 'too-loud', 'laughing', 'effort', 'stave', 'off', 'fear', 'emptiness', 'Hartley', 'especially', 'good', 'underplaying', 'role', 'perfection', 'own', 'fears', 'bottled', 'up', 'tightly', 'still', 'seeping', 'out', 'cracks', 'facade.The', 'story', 'meanders', 'part', 'film', 'authentic', 'charm', 'was', 'teenager', 'then', 'dreading', 'draft', 'just', 'film', 'protagonists', 'did', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'feels', 'very', 'real', 'true', 'required', 'countercultural', 'scenes', 'are', 'wisely', 'low-keyed', 'rather', 'over-the-top', 'genuine', 'hippies', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'caricatures', 'see', 'contemporary', 'presentations.Does', 'really', 'deserve', '4', '5', 'stars', 'toss-up', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'going', 'four', 'stars', 'what', 'get', 'right', 'achingly', 'honest', 'Besides', 'many', 'questions', 'war', 'peace', 'obedience', 'authority', 'pursuing', 'wholeness', 'individual', 'human', 'being', 'remain', 'pertinent', 'today', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'want', 'flush', 'time', 'down', 'memory', 'hole', 'modest', 'film', 'more', 'recommended']",1969
