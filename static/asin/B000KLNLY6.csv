It even has a Captain Kirk character who ends up lobotomized!!This movie is comedy at the lowest common denominator and that is just where I like it. The crude clay animation just adds to the charm.

1034912,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000KLNLY6,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 0]","Don't mistake this movie for the movie titled ""Disaster Movie (2008)"", another one of those so-called parody movies that manages to make a 120 minute long movie without a laugh. This one is titled ""Disaster: The Movie (2006)"", and is a parody of the Bruce Willis film Armageddon. However, when the writers proposed this script to Hollyweed producers, they where told the budget would probably be around 80 million, and no one was going to invest that kind of money into a parody film. So the idea to make it a low budget animation flick was given the thumbs up to create.The animation is dolls, clay models, toys in a stop-motion environment. Basically, it's the same thing Robot Chicken does. However, I have seen up and down reviews from Robot Chicken fans, and some say it's good, some didn't think it was any good, but to me, I thought it was a decent parody and the makers of the film did not waste their time or potential in creating this. I think some Robot Chicken fans are being a bit too bias on their opinions and didn't enjoy not hearing Seth Green and the other guy do any voices in this movie, otherwise it probably would be a movie they praised the chicken clucker out of. Others also compare it to Team America, but of coarse, do not expect the budget of Team America to show through in this movie, this is a small low budget film, but it still deserved to be watched without people expecting it to be Robot Chicken or Team America, it is something else on it's own.The plot of the film is much like Armageddon. A huge asteroid is heading to the earth, and a team of drillers are sent to the planetoid to blow it up, moments after they find their inner strengths and blah blah blah.You have the group of main characters which consist of Harry Bottoms, who is the Bruce Willis character pretty much. A stupid blonde who masters in neurophysiology (rocket science), the blonde cowboy named V.D Johnson who can't keep his hands off Harry's daughter (Major Melons), and also has a fear of Golf Carts... a gay robot, a black guy named Donkey Dixon who can drill anything because he is such a great porno-star, a stereo-type French guy who needs to learn how to control his flatulence, a captain who is pretty much Captain James T Kirk (I can't beleive I even know that full name). Along with other side characters such as Dr Steven Mocking, and some pretty useless cameo's by Motley Crue who I guess must have invested money in the movie or something, as there is no way I would leave their useless scenes in the movie for the final cut. Maybe it was because they used a few of their songs, that they got to do some voice acting and participate in the movies ""The World is F'd 1 day tour""... I don't mind Motley Crue, but the scenes they are in, needed not be there at all.So the film is pretty much what you expect, a bunch a low budget animations, which are not so bad at all for a low budget film, it certainly came across as being more expensive then it was. And of coarse, a bunch of sex, drugs, rock n roll, potty mouths, immature toilet humor and dolls flashing their private parts around for no reason at all... and that's how I think most movies should be made.It's going to be up and down reviews, parody movies always are. Some don't like the humor, some don't. Personally, I enjoyed it for the most part. Sure, you could always say it could have been better, and this and that should have, could have and would have, blah blah blah, but the movie is done now, so it is what it is, and no one is going to change that. If you enjoy parody films, even if you are like me and hated the last 10 that have come out and say ""Parody films have been murdered"" then check this one out, it is better then a lot of recent ones, but no, don't expect a discovered gem, it won't hold a candle to Team America, Airplane, Hot Shots or anything by Mel Brooks, but it does have it's moments, unlike the 2008 movie Disaster Movie, and all the other ones they produced that had a word before the next word ""Movie"".Bonus Features: Don't bother. A couple of trailers, which should never be listed as any kind of bonus feature, and a behind the scenes featurette, which is the same old boring, ""We loved working together"", ""this is us showing you we had a ball making the film"", here is someone you dont know or care about telling you what they did on the movie and a bunch of ""I turn this knob and that door opens"" kind of dribble that is on every other damn featurette that someone needs to prohibit by law to be shown on DVD's as only 3 or 4 people, like the Farrelly Brothers would give a rats rectum to watch without being bored to
