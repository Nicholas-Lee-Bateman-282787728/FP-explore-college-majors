773313,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B0000C2IXN,Bookphile,"[5, 5]","The first four seasons of Friends are, without a doubt, very funny but this one takes the cake.  There are so many moments of general hilarity, so many episodes in which I found myself saying, ""Oh, this is the one where..."" and then laughing hysterically, I can scarcely mention them all.The relationship between Monica and Chandler continues--though no one knows about it.  The lengths to which they go to conceal it contribute much to the hilarity but the best moment comes when Ross witnesses an encounter between the two and subsequently goes ballistic.  It's pure genius how he turns the line, ""My sister and my best friend!"" from one spoken in utter, blinding fury to one spoken in an awww, how sweet sort of way.  Poor Joey is perhaps the most put upon by their concealment, though, as he not only has to live with a secret he's bursting to tell, he also ends up looking like a disgusting pig when a series of near misses results in Monica and Chandler pointing the finger at him to divert suspicion from themselves.Joey's woes aren't merely confined to keeping Monica and Chandler's secret, though.  He also has to make the ultimate sacrifice and give up a beloved bag when its presence costs him an acting job and he has to suffer the humiliation of admitting that it hurts when his cute-as-a-button girlfriend (Punky Brewster, all grown up) playfully hits him.  The season then ends with the ultimate humiliation when Joey is forced to take a job as a gladiator in Caesar's Palace when his big break doesn't come to fruition.Phoebe reaches a defining moment in her life when she gives birth to the triplets and then is forced to deal with the sadness of having to give them away.  The scene in which she talks to the three newborns is one of the most touching for her character and it's difficult not to feel for her, for having gone through the ordeal of pregnancy only to have to give the babies up.  She also meets a seemingly great guy and is ready to move in with him until he exhibits a fatal character flaw that leaves Phoebe single once again.Rachel faces some difficult choices of her own when she finds out that Emily is demanding Ross not be around her if he wants to preserve their marriage.  She also has to learn to put aside her own feelings so that she can do right by her friend.  She does get a chance at romance but it ends in a hilariously icky way when she finds that her would-be boyfriend is rather too close to his sister for comfort.  On the plus side, though, Rachel gets her dream job as Ralph Lauren despite the fact that she inappropriately kisses the man who interviews her.The character who grows the most in this season and who has the best comedic opportunities, though, has to be Ross.  He tries his best to reconcile with Emily and then must extricate himself from a bad situation only to find that he's already on divorce number two.  He then has to deal with the bouts of rage that begin when his boss dares to eat his sandwich, complete with ""moist maker"".  Homeless and desperate, Ross has to move in with Joey and Chandler and proceeds to drive them both nuts, to the point that they almost force him into renting a tiny studio just to get rid of him.  When he finally does find a nice new apartment, he had a great time trying to amuse Rachel and Monica with his window-front antics.",5,The best of the series thus far,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,3334,"['first', 'four', 'seasons', 'Friends', 'are', 'doubt', 'very', 'funny', 'one', 'cake', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'general', 'hilarity', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'found', 'saying', 'Oh', 'one', 'where', 'then', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'can', 'scarcely', 'mention', 'all.The', 'relationship', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'one', 'lengths', 'go', 'conceal', 'contribute', 'much', 'hilarity', 'best', 'moment', 'when', 'Ross', 'encounter', 'two', 'subsequently', 'ballistic', 'pure', 'genius', 'how', 'line', 'sister', 'best', 'friend', 'one', 'spoken', 'utter', 'blinding', 'fury', 'one', 'spoken', 'awww', 'how', 'sweet', 'sort', 'way', 'Poor', 'Joey', 'perhaps', 'most', 'put', 'concealment', 'though', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'secret', 'bursting', 'tell', 'also', 'up', 'looking', 'disgusting', 'pig', 'when', 'series', 'near', 'misses', 'results', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'pointing', 'finger', 'divert', 'suspicion', 'themselves.Joey', 'woes', 'are', ""n't"", 'merely', 'confined', 'keeping', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'secret', 'though', 'also', 'make', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'give', 'up', 'beloved', 'bag', 'when', 'presence', 'costs', 'acting', 'job', 'suffer', 'humiliation', 'admitting', 'when', 'cute-as-a-button', 'girlfriend', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'grown', 'up', 'playfully', 'season', 'then', 'ultimate', 'humiliation', 'when', 'Joey', 'forced', 'take', 'job', 'gladiator', 'Caesar', 'Palace', 'when', 'big', 'break', ""n't"", 'come', 'fruition.Phoebe', 'reaches', 'defining', 'moment', 'life', 'when', 'birth', 'triplets', 'then', 'forced', 'deal', 'sadness', 'having', 'give', 'away', 'scene', 'three', 'newborns', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'character', 'difficult', 'not', 'feel', 'having', 'gone', 'ordeal', 'pregnancy', 'only', 'have', 'give', 'babies', 'up', 'also', 'seemingly', 'great', 'guy', 'ready', 'move', 'fatal', 'character', 'flaw', 'Phoebe', 'single', 'once', 'again.Rachel', 'difficult', 'choices', 'own', 'when', 'out', 'Emily', 'demanding', 'Ross', 'not', 'be', 'preserve', 'marriage', 'also', 'learn', 'put', 'aside', 'own', 'feelings', 'can', 'do', 'right', 'friend', 'get', 'chance', 'romance', 'hilariously', 'icky', 'way', 'when', 'would-be', 'boyfriend', 'rather', 'too', 'close', 'sister', 'comfort', 'plus', 'side', 'though', 'Rachel', 'dream', 'job', 'Ralph', 'Lauren', 'fact', 'inappropriately', 'man', 'who', 'her.The', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'season', 'who', 'best', 'comedic', 'opportunities', 'though', 'be', 'Ross', 'best', 'reconcile', 'Emily', 'then', 'must', 'extricate', 'bad', 'situation', 'only', 'find', 'already', 'divorce', 'number', 'two', 'then', 'deal', 'bouts', 'rage', 'begin', 'when', 'boss', 'eat', 'sandwich', 'complete', 'moist', 'maker', 'Homeless', 'desperate', 'Ross', 'move', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'proceeds', 'drive', 'nuts', 'point', 'almost', 'force', 'renting', 'tiny', 'studio', 'just', 'get', 'rid', 'When', 'finally', 'find', 'nice', 'new', 'apartment', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'trying', 'amuse', 'Rachel', 'Monica', 'window-front', 'antics']",N/A

Winner of innumerable television awards, the show features the lives of six friends in their late-twenties/early-thirties living in New York City - Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). The six friends spend the majority of their time in a coffee house named ""Central Perk"" or in either Monica's apartment or Joey and Chandler's apartment.The Friends (Season 5) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which we learn that Ross and Emily's wedding continued despite Ross's accidentally saying Rachel's name instead of Emily's. However, Emily is not happy, and Ross cannot seem to make it up to her. Meanwhile, Monica and Chandler go to great lengths to conceal their newly blossoming romance from the rest of the friends. As the season progresses, the various friends learn one-by-one that Monica and Chandler are an item. The season finale follows the entire cast through Las Vegas (where they followed Joey who went there to shoot a movie).

It looks like Ross might be seeing Divorce #2. But there's more laughs for you as the actors head into their fifth season.Picking up precisely where the fourth season left off, Emily and Ross tie the knot anyway, in spite of Ross saying the wrong name. At the reception, Emily hides in the bathroom and refuses to come out. Ross tries desperately to get Emily out, but she continues to tell him that she refuses to even look at him, where she then leaves the reception. Monica and Chandler try to hook up again, but they can't find a place to be alone.Phoebe is still at Monica's waiting for Monica, Chandler, and Joey to return. They come in and greet Phoebe. Joey goes across the hall to unpack as Phoebe goes home. Chandler and Monica then decide that they should become a couple, but vow to keep it as a secret from the others. Ross sits in the airport, hoping for Emily's arrival. He sees Rachel as she tries to get a ticket back home. But Ross is convinced that Emily won't show, so he invites Rachel to go with him to Athens. As Rachel boards the plane to Athens, Ross goes to get his jacket, but winds up chasing Emily, who bailed after seeing him with Rachel.Phoebe then goes into labor and gives birth to the triplets. When Phoebe was pregnant, she was told that the triplets were two boys and a girl. Frank had named one of the boys, Frank Jr. Jr., in other words, Frank III. Alice had named the girl baby, Leslie. Being that Phoebe was doing them the favor of carrying the babies, they allowed Phoebe to name the second boy baby. She named the second boy after Chandler. Frank Jr. Jr. was born first, followed by Leslie. Chandler was born third, but Frank and Phoebe were shocked to find that little Chandler was a girl. Frank and Alice decided to let the name stand, despite the fact that the third baby is a girl.Monica and Chandler continue their relationship. They plan to go away to Atlantic City for a weekend together. Being that it'll sound suspicious to the others, Chandler tells them that he's got a business meeting there, while Monica tells them that she has a cooking convention there. They go out to AC, but they come back early after a little argument. The next day, Joey gives Chandler a message from the hotel in AC, saying that there was an eyelash curler in his hotel room. Chandler lies and says he knows nothing about it and says that he saw Donald Trump getting on the elevator. Everyone then gathers at Monica's apartment. Monica reveals that she too saw Donald Trump. Joey begins looking suspicious. Monica then asks Rachel if she could borrow her eyelash curler, since Monica lost hers. After hearing that, Joey finally realizes that Chandler and Monica had lied about their business stories and went to AC together and realizes that they are dating. Chandler and Monica swear Joey to secrecy. Joey agrees.Ross continues to call Emily, but cannot find her anywhere. Emily finally calls him. She promises to move to the states with Ross as long as he promises to never see Rachel again. Hurt by the decision he has to make, Ross is desperate to make this marriage work. He agrees to do what Emily wants, as well as moving out of his apartment and getting rid of all his furniture and buying new furniture and a new place with Emily. While having dinner with Monica and the gang, Emily calls. Everyone covers for Ross by saying that Rachel is not there, even though she is, but Ross knows better and says that Rachel is there, which leads into his second divorce.Rachel, later on, finds out about Monica and Chandler, but they have no idea that Rachel knows, but she agrees to help Joey keep it a secret from the others, but she cannot tell Monica and Chandler that she knows. But soon, everyone finds out, except for Ross, who is busy trying to get Ugly Naked Guys apartment. Ross finds out, but winds up being happy, for Monica and Chandler feel love for each other.The season ends with the gang going to Vegas for the weekend. Monica and Chandler are so in love that they decide to elope. But they are in utter shock when they find Ross and Rachel, who are more drunk than they could imagine, come out of the chapel a married couple.Shocking, isn't it? But you'll laugh and laugh and laugh until your heart stops as this season unfolds. All the laughs are worth the money when you buy the complete fifth season.

For some reason I notice the episodes are kind of all over the place and its not like it used to be. Dont get me wrong I still  love the show and this Season is good, but this one isn't vital. I personally only bought this season for that episode where Monica has a turkey on her head with the big glasses and hat and then dances! I know! Stupid! Lol but its classic!This season Box set isnt desperately needed in your collection, unless you want to see Monica and Chandler start their relationship and hide it with Joey covering for them constantly (The One With Ross's Sandwich is great when Joey covers for Monica and Chandler!)The top 5 Episodes are very easy to pick for this particular season.My Personal Top 5 Episodes Are:The One With All The KissingThe One Hundredth (Has to be here! The 100th!)The One with the Thanksgiving FlashbacksThe One Where Everybody Finds Out (BEST HERE!!!!)The One Where Rachel SmokesI didnt care much for the Season Finale, I mean, identical hand twin?? Not very funny. Very time wasting!. The only really good thing in the final is The Very Last Scene!!!Overall, not a stellar season, Not as good as Season 3 or 4 but definitley up there somewhere.

773320,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0000C2IXN,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","We are into the heart of the Friends 9-season series, and it shows: the writing is as crisp as it gets, and the characters are still new enough that we don't get the repeating storylines that crop up unfortunately in later seasons.  Even Phoebe's stories are interesting and semi-normal, in a Friends kind of way (i.e. a seemingly normal relationship with a cop gives rise to a number of nifty subplots such as the boys being scared in a ride-along).  It's certainly a welcome relief from her demented Season 4 thread of giving birth to her brother's triplets.However, the meat of the season is the development of the Chandler-Monica relationship.  Much of the humour is driven by Monica's competitiveness and the universal thought that although Chandler is seen as making a great catch, Monica could ""do better"".  For example, when Monica discovers Phoebe and her new beau have had a ""rendezvous"" in Central Park, Monica tries to talk Chandler into an even riskier adventure in a public restroom.Finally, with the departure of Ugly Naked Guy, the show has finally lost all the silly go-to, cheap-laugh gimmicks that detracted from the re-watchability of the earliest seasons.  It also leads to the funniest moment of the season: Ross and Ugly Naked Guy having tea together .... naked, of course!  In fact, nudity abounds in this season, with Ross mistakingly getting a show from a naked Rachel dancing alone in her apartment, among others.There is one interesting extra - an extended (~1 hour) look at filming the show including looks into the writer's room and tape of fans in the studio audience laughing it up with the warm-up comic.  There is very little in addition to this one extra, though - a few Entertainment Tonight-like clips of the cast and crew in London, a couple commentaries (with almost no new information we don't already know from previous commentaries), etc.  However, it is a pleasure to see the cast and the writers at their peaks, and the re-watchablility of this season is one of the highest of the series.",4,Another enjoyable season,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,2032,"['are', 'heart', 'Friends', '9-season', 'series', 'writing', 'as', 'crisp', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'new', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'repeating', 'storylines', 'crop', 'up', 'unfortunately', 'later', 'seasons', 'Even', 'Phoebe', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'semi-normal', 'Friends', 'kind', 'way', 'i.e', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'relationship', 'cop', 'rise', 'number', 'nifty', 'subplots', 'such', 'boys', 'being', 'scared', 'ride-along', 'certainly', 'welcome', 'relief', 'demented', 'Season', '4', 'thread', 'giving', 'birth', 'brother', 'triplets.However', 'meat', 'season', 'development', 'Chandler-Monica', 'relationship', 'Much', 'humour', 'driven', 'Monica', 'competitiveness', 'universal', 'thought', 'Chandler', 'seen', 'making', 'great', 'catch', 'Monica', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'example', 'when', 'Monica', 'Phoebe', 'new', 'beau', 'have', 'had', 'rendezvous', 'Central', 'Park', 'Monica', 'talk', 'Chandler', 'even', 'riskier', 'adventure', 'public', 'restroom.Finally', 'departure', 'Ugly', 'Naked', 'Guy', 'show', 'finally', 'lost', 'silly', 'go-to', 'cheap-laugh', 'gimmicks', 'detracted', 're-watchability', 'earliest', 'seasons', 'also', 'funniest', 'moment', 'season', 'Ross', 'Ugly', 'Naked', 'Guy', 'having', 'tea', 'together', 'naked', 'course', 'fact', 'nudity', 'abounds', 'season', 'Ross', 'mistakingly', 'getting', 'show', 'naked', 'Rachel', 'dancing', 'alone', 'apartment', 'one', 'interesting', 'extra', 'extended', '~1', 'hour', 'look', 'filming', 'show', 'including', 'writer', 'room', 'tape', 'fans', 'studio', 'audience', 'laughing', 'up', 'warm-up', 'comic', 'very', 'little', 'addition', 'one', 'extra', 'few', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight-like', 'clips', 'cast', 'crew', 'London', 'couple', 'commentaries', 'almost', 'new', 'information', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'previous', 'commentaries', 'etc', 'However', 'pleasure', 'see', 'cast', 'writers', 'peaks', 're-watchablility', 'season', 'one', 'highest', 'series']",N/A

773328,ARX984I8G47K5,B0000C2IXN,friendsfan,"[4, 4]","Season 5 is another strong season overall for Friends and represents the show while it was on a high. This season saw Monica and Chandler trying to hide their new found relationship from the rest of the friends, Phoebe giving birth early in the season, Ross trying to regain Emily's love, Rachel struggling with her feelings for Ross and trying to climb up the corporate ladder, and Joey being, well, Joey. Monica and Chandler's relationship was risky on the writer's part, but something about it clicked and felt natural. Courteney and Matthew are actually quite funny together, especially in the beginning of their relationship when the characters were oversexed. Monica and Chandler were a very different couple from Ross and Rachel. They aren't dramatic and many of their fights are funny and normally arise from the character's neuroses. Kudrow probably gives on the single best performances on the show when Phoebe gives birth and then has to give the triplets up. Ross settles into the whiny, neurotic character that finishes out the series, but Schwimmer still gives him an earnest, loveable quality and finds a really funny voice for him. Aniston isn't given much to do this season, but she does make what little she has memorable. She is hysterical in ""TOW Rachel's Inadvertant Kiss"" and ""TOW Rachel Smokes,"" and continues to make Rachel a wounded character whose plans never quite work out the way she intends. LeBlanc continues to be a funny, go-to-the-joke type character. LeBlanc is reliable and he will always produce a laugh.

A week ago I finally decided to buy season 5 and I'm now I'm wishing I got it sooner.  I LOVE this season of Friends!  I feel that this season has some of the funniest episodes because of Chandler and Monica's secret relationship.  My favorite is &#34;The One Where Everybody Finds Out&#34;.However, a few &#34;maybe not completely great&#34; but still good things to note before you purchase are:1.  The commentary isn't that great.  Though I haven't watched ALL of the bonus features yet (I'm on disc 3/4), I do feel that the commentary isn't as up to par as they were in the past seasons.  The producers explained things well in their commentary for &#34;The One Where Everybody Finds Out&#34; but for the &#34;The One Hundredth&#34; and &#34;The One With All The Thanksgivings&#34; I felt like they just ran out of things to talk about.  There was so much dead air time.  I got the impression that they were told they &#34;HAD&#34; to do commentary for special features on the package for a certain amount of episodes.  It's a good idea, but it's kind of pointless if there isn't much to talk about.  So if you're looking to buy this version of the DVDs for the special features (like me) rather than buy the versions that are only the episodes themselves, then you may want to consider that before you purchase and maybe you can save a bit of money.2.  I feel like the writers really changed Ross's character in this season.  He gets all melodramatic because of his divorce, has anger issues so he gets laid-off, and is kind of manic depressive or something.  They also seem to make him dorkier (if that's at all possible... or at least that how I've felt when watching).  There are definitely funny moments by making that shift with the character, but I can see where people could start to get annoyed with him or just see him as becoming a bit more separate from the other 5.Overall though, I really enjoy watching this season.  I feel like the episodes don't get old. I'm laughing every time I watch whether it's the first time I've seen it or the 6th.",5,Love this season,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2124,"['longest', 'time', 'only', 'had', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'purchased', 'week', 'ago', 'finally', 'decided', 'buy', 'season', '5', ""'m"", 'now', ""'m"", 'wishing', 'got', 'sooner', 'LOVE', 'season', 'Friends', 'feel', 'season', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'secret', 'relationship', 'favorite', '34', 'One', 'Where', 'Everybody', 'Out', '34', '.However', 'few', '34', 'maybe', 'not', 'completely', 'great', '34', 'still', 'good', 'things', 'note', 'purchase', 'are:1', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'ALL', 'bonus', 'yet', ""'m"", 'disc', '3/4', 'do', 'feel', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'as', 'up', 'par', 'were', 'past', 'seasons', 'producers', 'explained', 'things', 'well', 'commentary', '34', 'One', 'Where', 'Everybody', 'Out', '34', '34', 'One', 'Hundredth', '34', '34', 'One', 'Thanksgivings', '34', 'felt', 'just', 'ran', 'things', 'talk', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'dead', 'air', 'time', 'got', 'impression', 'were', 'told', '34', 'HAD', '34', 'do', 'commentary', 'special', 'features', 'package', 'certain', 'amount', 'episodes', 'good', 'idea', 'kind', 'pointless', ""n't"", 'much', 'talk', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'buy', 'version', 'DVDs', 'special', 'features', 'rather', 'buy', 'versions', 'are', 'only', 'episodes', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'purchase', 'maybe', 'can', 'save', 'bit', 'money.2', 'feel', 'writers', 'really', 'changed', 'Ross', 'character', 'season', 'all', 'melodramatic', 'divorce', 'anger', 'issues', 'laid-off', 'kind', 'manic', 'depressive', 'something', 'also', 'seem', 'make', 'dorkier', 'possible', 'least', 'how', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'when', 'watching', 'are', 'definitely', 'funny', 'moments', 'making', 'shift', 'character', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'people', 'could', 'start', 'get', 'annoyed', 'just', 'see', 'becoming', 'bit', 'more', 'separate', 'other', '5.Overall', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'season', 'feel', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'old', ""'m"", 'laughing', 'time', 'watch', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', '6th']",N/A

Bernabo,"[15, 16]","You have to admire the symmetry of ""Friends: The Complete Fifth Season,"" which opens with Ross getting married and ends with Ross getting married.  It reminds me of ""Gone With the Wind,"" which begins with Scarlet pining for a man she cannot have and ends the same way.  However, the key difference is that Monica and Chandler are a lot more fun than Ashley and Miss Melly ever were, that is for sure.  For that reason Season Five is important in the ""Friends"" chronology, because it begins the second half of the series, which is operationally defined by the fact that as this point the Monica-Chandler relationship is suddenly transformed from a joke in the finale from the previous season into a driving force for both the season and the series.  Even though we are now starting the final half of the final season, I think a lot of ""Friends"" fans are rooting more for Monica to adopt a baby (if not for Monica to actually be pregnant), then they are at this point for Ross and Rachel to finally end up together for the final time.  While not as good as the fourth season, this one once again shows that having multiple story arcs for most of the characters is what works best for the series.Best Shows of the Fifth Season: ""The One After Ross Says Rachel,"" not just because Ross is trying to salvage his new marriage before it is even official, but because Monica and Chandler cannot keep their hands or their thoughts off of one another; ""The One with All the Kissing,"" because of the stupid Not-in-New York rule, Rachel's heartfelt admission to Ross, and Phoebe's water breaking; ""The One with All the Resolutions,"" because Chandler is not allowed to make fun of Ross's new leather pants; ""The One Where Everybody Finds Out,"" because they don't know that we know they know we know and because Chandler knows something none of those that think they know happen to know;  and ""The One in Vegas Part 2,"" because of the power of a hard eight.This season has one of my favorite story arcs, as Monica and Chandler try to keep their romance secret from as many Friends for as long as possible, but there are also a lot of episodes that are average at best (e.g., ""The One with the Yeti,"" ""The One Where Ross Moves In,"" ""The One Where Rachel Smokes"") to drag it down a bit.  I was thinking that this season was going to grade out at a 4.5 that would get rounded up just for the surprise ending that no one every saw come (which, strangely enough, would explain why it was a surprise), but there are just too many average episodes (""The One with the Inappropriate Sister,"" ""The One With Joey's Bag,"" ""The One Where Ross Can't Flirt,"" etc.).  When I realized that there were more episodes on my average list than on my best list, I had to revise my rating appropriately.

While it was definitely great, it wasn't my favorite thus far (that crown belongs to Season 4).  I thought the beginning of the season was hilarious, but toward the end it fizzled a little bit.This season introduced the Monica/Chandler romance.  I'll be honest with you, I wasn't really rooting for them at first.  Their chemistry wasn't as good as Ross and Rachel's, and I just wasn't feeling it.  However, as the season went on, I thought they were great together.While everyone in the cast gave stellar performances, this season definitely belonged to Lisa Kudrow.  The One Hundredth showcased her ability to both make you laugh and sad when she had to give up the triplets.

I can't condense this into less than 1000 words but watching the plot arc unfold as the Friends find out about Chandler and Monica's burdening relationship after the disastrous and dramatic wedding between Ross and Emily, the series had plenty of fodder for some laffs....from Chandler's fake work laugh to Rachel tormenting herself over her love for Ross as he despairs over a 2nd failed marriage, the Friends give plenty of laughs as well as tears.  By now they have become our Friends...we know and love them.  Some tremendous classic scenes though....the One Where Everyone Finds Out is still to date my favourite Friends episode with loads of physical comedy as Phoebe tries to outflirt Chandler while Ross talks-up Ugly Naked Guy to get his apartment, it makes this series worthwhile.  The 80s flashback is also a hoot for its sheer visual comedy of Rachel's nose, Monica as obese and Ross and Chandler in their Miami Vice outfits.  Kudos also to the ball-throwing episode and the inside-out cat....Jennifer Aniston proves her acting prowess beyond a shadow of a doubt....fantastik comic range.  Wonderful series.  While Sex and the City, Will and Grace for example may now have outshadowed Friends in many ways, this series testfies the wondrousness of Friends and its place int he cult comedies of our era.

THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON OF FRIENDS is great - the fifth season was one of the best seasons of the series, what with Chandler and Monica finally getting together, Phoebe meeting her dad, and Joey finally gets his ""big break!""Highlights of the set are:*The One With All the Thanksgivings - This is my absolute favorite episode of Friends. Each ""Friend"" talks about their worst Thanksgiving ever, which provide plenty of laughs now - even though they didn't when they happened.*The One Where Everyone Finds Out - Everyone finds out about Chandler and Monica's ""secret"" relationship. This episode definately has some of the best quotes, my favorite one being ""But they don't know that we know that they know that we know!""*The One With Joey's Bag - When he goes on an audition, Joey takes a man's bag with him to help get into character. He becomes attached to the bag and starts taking it everywhere he goes.*The One Hundredth - Phoebe finally has her brother's triplets!THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON OF FRIENDS is recommended to fans of the show, as are the rest of the DVDs.Overall grade - A+",5,Yet another great DVD collection,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,1219,"['TV', 'been', 'out', 'well', 'not', 'TV', 'cable', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Friends', 'DVD', 'keep', 'entertained', 'COMPLETE', 'FIFTH', 'SEASON', 'OF', 'FRIENDS', 'great', 'fifth', 'season', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'series', 'what', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'finally', 'getting', 'together', 'Phoebe', 'meeting', 'dad', 'Joey', 'finally', 'big', 'break', 'Highlights', 'set', 'are', '*The', 'One', 'Thanksgivings', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Friends', 'Friend', 'talks', 'worst', 'Thanksgiving', 'ever', 'provide', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'now', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'when', 'happened', '*The', 'One', 'Where', 'Everyone', 'Out', 'Everyone', 'out', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'secret', 'relationship', 'episode', 'definately', 'best', 'quotes', 'favorite', 'one', 'being', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'know', 'know', 'know', '*The', 'One', 'Joey', 'Bag', 'When', 'audition', 'Joey', 'man', 'bag', 'help', 'get', 'character', 'attached', 'bag', 'taking', 'everywhere', '*The', 'One', 'Hundredth', 'Phoebe', 'finally', 'brother', 'triplets', 'THE', 'COMPLETE', 'FIFTH', 'SEASON', 'OF', 'FRIENDS', 'recommended', 'fans', 'show', 'are', 'rest', 'DVDs.Overall', 'grade', 'A+']",N/A
