187914,A63U10XVV66X8,1572526920,Arthur Tirrell,"[0, 0]","For Just Write, it's easy to see why. What could be more far-fetched than a plot where an underachiever who got ""D's"" in English and who's a terrible speller - now has to produce a top-notch screenplay if he hopes to hold onto the girl of his dreams?Not much, you'd think, but Director Andrew Gallerani hits the high points so skillfully it just doesn't matter. The setup might be goofy, and sure, we've seen the plot turns before, but somehow this one makes them seem fresh again. It all clicks, and to our surprise and pleasure the sum becomes much greater than the total of the pieces. Simply put, this one is a delight from start to finish.Six stars for casting. The principles, up-and-coming actress Amanda Clark (Sherilyn Fenn), and tour bus driver Harold McMurphy (Jeremy Piven), have great chemistry in their scenes. JoBeth Williams was made for her role as agent Sidney Stone. Diminutive Wallace Shawn is great as crusty, high-powered agent Arthur Blake, and so is Stephanie Miller as his caustic Personal Assistant. Yeardley Smith plays Lulu and her scene with Harold's dad (Alex Rocco) works to perfection. Kudos to the production staff.

Most people consider clean moves as too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;. This movie, Just Write, doesn't fall into the clean category.  I bought this movie a while ago and watched it once, then returned it to Amazon.  I don't remember much about it (which shows that it wasn't good enough to leave a good impression) except that every time Harold's father was on the screen it made me very uncomfortable.

It was fun for me to see all the scenes shot on Hollywood Blvd where I lived back in the 1980's. When I couldn't sleep I used to walk to Grauman's Chinese Theater at one or two in the morning and look at the footprints, cool because no one else was there! Anyway back to the movie, Sherilyn Fenn his just perfect for the role of a movie star who seeks help on a script she is not sure about. She is a VERY beautiful woman who I would watch in anything just to see her lovely face. Jeremy Piven and JoBeth Williams get kudos for playing their roles with the ""right touch of spice"".
