This movie tells the tale of a small town crook who tries to impart his ways on a few friends, hypeing himself up to be a bigtime criminal, when he actually is still the geeky little high school kid at the clam shack.  This movie has great characters of a sterotyped nature that most people can relate a real life person to, and the roles are played well.

1062593,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000O76TUY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 6]","One bad thing happens after another in ""Live Free or Die,"" a small-budget comedy with echoes of films like ""Palookaville"" and ""Dumb & Dumber."" The protagonist of the film is Rugged (Aaron Stanford), a self-proclaimed Billy the Kid-type guy who runs around his small-town taking the blame for the murder of a man and selling stolen speakers; Truth is, Rugged is a pretty-criminal that is quite obviously not all he makes himself out to be. When Rugged runs into Lagrand (Paul Schneider), a tall and semi-retarted man who co-owns the U-Lock storage center; Rugged tries to get a job as security man. Everything changes when a man messes with Rugged in a bar and Rugged retalliates by poisioning the man's water. After the man dies, Rugged panics and (with Lagrand's help) attempts to dispose of all the evidence linking him to the murder. Meanwhile, a cop (Michael Rappaport) who suspects that his wife is cheating on him looks for Rugged to investigate his role in the sales of stolen speakers around town. Zooey Deschanel (a very talented and underrated young actress) co-stars as Lagrand's sister Cheryl. The only reason I even heard of this film was because of Zooey Deschanel and the only reason I wanted to see it was because she was in it. Even though she's had few lead roles, she's built up an impressive body of work with films like All the Real Girls (this film reunites her with co-star Schneider), Manic, Elf, Mumford, and Winter Passing. Sadly, Deschanel is probably in the film for 10 minutes over the course of the 89-minute film. Schneider, as the clueless Lagrand is a riot. How he did not bust up laughing while reciting his dialogue the way he does is beyond me. He plays the character in a dead-pan, droning way that is hilariously funny. Stanford as Rugged is a decent actor and believable as the character, but he seems like an actor that will be stuck in small-budget roles for a good long portion of his career. ""Live Free or Die"" is not a perfect film and it does have some un-even tone changes throughout, but there are a few solid comic moments and Schneider is a riot. It's worth seeing, but rent before you buy.GRADE: B-",4,"Not Perfect, But Really Good.",1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,2148,"['One', 'bad', 'thing', 'happens', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'small-budget', 'comedy', 'echoes', 'films', 'Palookaville', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'protagonist', 'film', 'Rugged', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'self-proclaimed', 'Billy', 'Kid-type', 'guy', 'who', 'small-town', 'taking', 'blame', 'murder', 'man', 'selling', 'stolen', 'speakers', 'Truth', 'Rugged', 'pretty-criminal', 'quite', 'obviously', 'not', 'be', 'When', 'Rugged', 'Lagrand', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'tall', 'semi-retarted', 'man', 'who', 'U-Lock', 'storage', 'center', 'Rugged', 'get', 'job', 'security', 'man', 'Everything', 'changes', 'when', 'man', 'Rugged', 'bar', 'Rugged', 'retalliates', 'poisioning', 'man', 'water', 'man', 'Rugged', 'panics', 'Lagrand', 'help', 'dispose', 'evidence', 'linking', 'murder', 'Meanwhile', 'cop', 'Michael', 'Rappaport', 'who', 'wife', 'cheating', 'Rugged', 'investigate', 'role', 'sales', 'stolen', 'speakers', 'town', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'very', 'talented', 'underrated', 'young', 'actress', 'co-stars', 'Lagrand', 'sister', 'Cheryl', 'only', 'reason', 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'only', 'reason', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'was', 'Even', 'had', 'few', 'lead', 'roles', 'built', 'up', 'impressive', 'body', 'work', 'films', 'Real', 'Girls', 'film', 'co-star', 'Schneider', 'Manic', 'Elf', 'Mumford', 'Winter', 'Passing', 'Sadly', 'Deschanel', 'probably', 'film', '10', 'minutes', 'course', '89-minute', 'film', 'Schneider', 'clueless', 'Lagrand', 'riot', 'How', 'did', 'not', 'bust', 'up', 'laughing', 'reciting', 'dialogue', 'way', 'character', 'dead-pan', 'droning', 'way', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'Stanford', 'Rugged', 'decent', 'actor', 'believable', 'character', 'actor', 'will', 'be', 'stuck', 'small-budget', 'roles', 'good', 'long', 'portion', 'career', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'have', 'un-even', 'tone', 'changes', 'are', 'few', 'solid', 'comic', 'moments', 'Schneider', 'riot', 'worth', 'seeing', 'rent', 'buy.GRADE', 'B-']",Live Free or Die

1062595,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000O76TUY,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","***1/2Scenic New Hampshire serves as the novel setting for ""Live Free or Die"" (not to be confused with the later Bruce Willis film, ""Live Free or Die HARD""), an entertaining indie comedy that takes its title from the state's time-honored motto of in-your-face defiance.John Rudgate - who goes by the nickname ""Rugged"" - is an inept wannabe tough guy who fancies himself a notorious outlaw.  He spends most of his days riding around in a dilapidated van trying to convince others - as well as himself - that he is, indeed, the most feared lawbreaker in the county.  In reality, the ""stolen"" merchandise he is moving is actually his own stuff, and the gun he keeps in a drawer in the kitchen is nothing more than a water pistol.  The folks in town shrug him off as little more than an irritating pest with delusions of criminal grandeur.  Like any villain worth his salt, Rudgate needs to find himself a sycophantic henchman who will do a substantial amount of his dirty work for him.  He alights on Lagrand, a simpleminded, but sweet-natured acquaintance who co-owns a storage facility with his sister, a clear-eyed pragmatist who, unlike her brother, knows a BS-ing con artist when she sees one.Although the movie can't entirely shake free of the ""oddball quirkiness"" factor that seems to afflict so much of regional filmmaking these days, moviemakers Gregg Kavet and Andy Robin evince a genuine affection for their characters and a sly way with storytelling that go a long way towards mitigating that weakness.  They are aided immeasurably by wonderfully self-effacing performances by Paul Schneider, Michael Rapaport, Zooey Deschanel, and, above all, Aaron Stanford, who, as Rudgate, turns a potentially one-note caricature into an endearingly original and surprisingly memorable comic figure.  And, besides, the colorful New England setting is alone worth the price of a rental.",3,novel setting and sweet tone make for enjoyable comedy,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,1881,"['***1/2Scenic', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'novel', 'setting', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'later', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'film', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'HARD', 'entertaining', 'indie', 'comedy', 'title', 'state', 'time-honored', 'motto', 'in-your-face', 'defiance.John', 'Rudgate', 'who', 'nickname', 'Rugged', 'inept', 'wannabe', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'notorious', 'outlaw', 'most', 'days', 'riding', 'around', 'dilapidated', 'van', 'trying', 'convince', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'indeed', 'most', 'feared', 'lawbreaker', 'county', 'reality', 'stolen', 'merchandise', 'moving', 'actually', 'own', 'stuff', 'gun', 'drawer', 'kitchen', 'nothing', 'more', 'water', 'pistol', 'folks', 'town', 'shrug', 'off', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'irritating', 'pest', 'delusions', 'criminal', 'grandeur', 'villain', 'salt', 'Rudgate', 'find', 'sycophantic', 'henchman', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'substantial', 'amount', 'dirty', 'work', 'Lagrand', 'simpleminded', 'sweet-natured', 'acquaintance', 'who', 'co-owns', 'storage', 'facility', 'sister', 'clear-eyed', 'pragmatist', 'who', 'brother', 'BS-ing', 'con', 'artist', 'when', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'shake', 'free', 'oddball', 'quirkiness', 'factor', 'afflict', 'so', 'much', 'regional', 'filmmaking', 'days', 'moviemakers', 'Gregg', 'Kavet', 'Andy', 'Robin', 'evince', 'genuine', 'affection', 'characters', 'sly', 'way', 'storytelling', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'towards', 'mitigating', 'weakness', 'are', 'aided', 'immeasurably', 'wonderfully', 'self-effacing', 'performances', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'who', 'Rudgate', 'potentially', 'one-note', 'caricature', 'endearingly', 'original', 'surprisingly', 'memorable', 'comic', 'figure', 'besides', 'colorful', 'New', 'England', 'setting', 'alone', 'worth', 'price', 'rental']",Live Free or Die
