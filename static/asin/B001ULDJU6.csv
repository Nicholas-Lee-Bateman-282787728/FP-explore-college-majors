1239143,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001ULDJU6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","A-ha! I knew PaleyFest was good for something. It's cool that those still suffering from Buffy withdrawal can get a 74-minute respite. On March 20, 2008 the Paley Center featured a reunion of the BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER cast (excepting David Boreanaz,.Alyson Hannigan, Eliza Dushku, and Anthony Stewart Head). For those who are all Adrian Monk-y about this stuff, this event takes place on the 6th evening of the 2008 25th annual Paley Festival. This DVD kicks off with the near nine-minutes-long ""Intro"" segment which has Paley Center director Barbara Dixon and host/moderator Matt Roush (the TV Guide guy) saying some blah blah and BUFFY writer/producer Marti Noxon then presenting the musical episode ""Once More, With Feeling"" (which the DVD then skips). The DVD next cuts away to the main feature as, one by one, the cast is introduced for the onstage panel discussion and then it's on to Matt Roush and his list of fan-friendly queries. And, thankfully, the ensuing jibber-jabber right away grabs you. This program really is as terrific and as funny as Buffy fans could have hoped for. Practically giddy, I was.Matt Roush awesomely introduces Sarah Michelle Gellar as ""the only one here who has been in two Scooby gangs."" I'm so glad that Sarah Michelle - lookin' mighty fine - is so engaged in the discussion, and she offers wonderful, well-thought-out insights. She really contributes to the conversation. I get the sense that Joss Whedon took a step back so as to give his actors more of the spotlight. Seth Green ad-libs some hilarious lines, as does Nicholas Brendon to lesser effect. It's freaky how Brendon and his character Xander seem to inhabit the same personality. Charisma Carpenter and Amber Benson come off as sweet and shy. I love that Emma Caulfield and James Marsters attended, as Anya and Spike are two of my most favorite characters in BUFFY. Marsters even basks in a ""Take that, Angel!"" moment when Sarah Michelle informs him that Buffy and Spike's tear-the-roof-off sex scene was ranked by TV GUIDE as the steamiest ever on television. Michelle Trachtenberg has grown up, by the way. And executive producers Marti Noxon and David Greenwalt round out the panel.Plenty of back-and-forth banter, some of it disarming, some of it juuuust a bit racy. We're in for some revealing anecdotes and reflections and deconstructing of the show. Just a whole lot of feel-good nostalgia. A huge chunk of the program features the cast expressing their thoughts on the show's best episodes (""Once More, With Feeling,"" ""Hush,"" and ""The Body""). It's particularly interesting to listen to Sarah Michelle as she talks about the very dark Season 6 and how that season's bleak tone impacted her. There are some cool reveals, such as that Sarah Michelle hadn't been keeping up with Joss's BUFFY Season 8 comic book series and so had no clue that Buffy had macked with a fellow Slayer. We even find out why Whedon and Greenwalt referred to Sarah as ""Jimmy Stewart."" I loved Sarah Michelle's heartfelt explanation of why she prefers fan awards over the more prestigious accolades. It all ends with an audience-participatory Q & A session. Probably the evening's most awkward moment concerns an audience member asking Amber to elaborate on some past comment she made about not wanting to come back to BUFFY. Amber seems a bit flustered in her response, although I liked her Marlon Brando excuse. By the way, I'm sort of discounting those awkward moments in which Nicholas Brendon's jokes fell flat.So this is the critique paragraph, and I do have some nitpicks. I would've loved to have heard more from Emma Caulfield and Charisma Carpenter - as I didn't feel that Matt Roush involved them enough. And I love Xander but I wish there were less of Nicholas Brendon whom I felt imposed himself on several occasions. It quickly got old for me. Brendon was trying too hard, and he offered hardly any insight. It's frustrating that, at times, Brendon and Green's periodical jokey interruptions ended up cutting into what probably would have been more in-depth (and relevant) responses from the other panelists, because there were some pretty intriguing questions being lobbed by Roush. 74 minutes isn't that long a window, and the conversational segues - which I would've appreciated more if the panel had been on longer - resulted in precious time being wasted. And I wish someone had socked that first audience member who asked the panelists to share their favorite film and what songs are on their iPods. This sequence sucked the energy out of the room and it dragged for almost ten minutes (but I did enjoy Sarah Michelle Gellar's answer for favorite film). With all those nitpicks aside, this DVD is a must-have for fans of BUFFY, surely one of the most trend-setting, game-changing, and best shows ever. Just seeing the cast together one more time, it made my day.The DVD has pretty shabby bonus stuff: the afore-mentioned ""Intro"" segment; A photo gallery; the ""Backstage Video"" - essentially, a photo op for the Paley Center and the BUFFY cast with the (off-screen) press photogs directing the actors to pose and turn willy-nilly (00:03:52 minutes); and the ""About Paley Center"" segment which is pretty self-explanatory (00:01:56 minutes).",5,"fantastic panel discussion, hamstrung a bit by lame ""Q & A"" fan questions",1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,5241,"['A-ha', 'knew', 'PaleyFest', 'was',

1239144,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B001ULDJU6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","What you have here is what happened on March 20, 2008 when eleven members of the cast and creative team of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" attended Paleyfest, which is a yearly eventat  the Paley Center for Media that connects fans with the casts and creators of their favorite series.  The moderator for the proceedings is Matt Roush of ""TV Guide,"" who is pretty much an idea choice, having been a big fan of the show from Day 1 and an equally big advocate for the series as well.  On the one hand you getJoss Whedontalking about his show and alsoSarah Michelle Gellarsaying more about the character than you have actually heard coming from her lips, so that alone is worth the price of admission.  I particularly like hearing what Marti Noxon has to say and Michelle Trachtenberg had some interesting things to say as somebody who was a fan of the show before she spent her formative teen years on it as a character.  There is an introduction section separate from the actual panel discussion, because in between those two parts there was a screening of the Buffy music, ""Once More, with Feeling.""  That episode is not included on the DVD, but I have to believe anybody who picks up this up is already in possession of the complete ""BtVS"" on DVD and therefore can certainly switch discs, screen the episode (presumably singing along), and then get back to the proceedings.On the one hand anything with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" in it pretty much qualifies as ""must have"" for fans of the show, but I have to admit I put this on my Amazon wish list in the weeks before my birthday because I was not sure I wanted to pay this much for what is, all things considered, this little.  One of the problems is that there are too many people on stage so Emma Caulfield and Charisma Carpenter, for example, get asked one question each by Roush.  Their answers are revealing and memorable, but who wants to stop at just one?  So on the one hand you lament the gaps in the reunion, with Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and David Boreanez not in attendance, but then that would have meant even small slices of pie for everybody.  Then you have the competition for comic relief between Nicholas Brendon (who throws a wicked Susan Lucci comment Gellar's way) and Seth Green, who get plenty of laughs but scarcely have a serious word to say during the session.  James Marsters is also willing to go for the joke, but also speaks to several of the topics as one of the few panelists who would add to the discussion.Then there are the questions from the audience, which suffer from a general desire to praise the cast rather than question them, and from the grave misfortune of a first question that requires everyone to answer without having to reference ""BtVS.""  There are several minutes of this panel that you would want everybody to get back.  Of course, there is no way anything on this DVD is going to be enough to satisfy any ""BtVS"" fan, but still, you have to want a little less fat and a lot more meat.  The only real DVD extras are some photos from the day and film of almost everybody being shot backstage by the paparazzi, which is interesting if you like watching dozens of cameras flashing repeatedly at high speed (it is amazing any of the photos end up with decent lighting).  Final note: there is something of a ""spoiler"" here if you have not been reading the ""Season 8"" Whedon is overseeing with the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" comic book.  My daughters are woefully behind in reading the issues I have been purchasing for them and were stunned to hear what Buffy has been up to.  Of course, this should be an incentive for them to get up to speed.",4,Great idea but certainly not everything you hoped an event like this could be,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,3652,"['What', 'have', 'here', 'what', 'happened', 'March', '20', '2008', 'when', 'eleven', 'members', 'cast', 'creative', 'team', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'attended', 'Paleyfest', 'yearly', 'Paley', 'Center', 'Media', 'fans', 'casts', 'creators', 'favorite', 'series', 'moderator', 'proceedings', 'Matt', 'Roush', 'TV', 'Guide', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'idea', 'choice', 'having', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'Day', '1', 'equally', 'big', 'advocate', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'hand', 'getJoss', 'Whedontalking', 'show', 'alsoSarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellarsaying', 'more', 'character', 'have', 'actually', 'heard', 'coming', 'lips', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'particularly', 'hearing', 'what', 'Marti', 'Noxon', 'say', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'had', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'somebody', 'who', 'was', 'fan', 'show', 'spent', 'formative', 'teen', 'years', 'character', 'introduction', 'section', 'separate', 'actual', 'panel', 'discussion', 'two', 'parts', 'there', 'was', 'screening', 'Buffy', 'music', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'episode', 'not', 'included', 'DVD', 'have', 'believe', 'anybody', 'who', 'up', 'up', 'already', 'possession', 'complete', 'BtVS', 'DVD', 'therefore', 'can', 'certainly', 'switch', 'discs', 'screen', 'episode', 'presumably', 'singing', 'along', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'proceedings.On', 'one', 'hand', 'anything', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'pretty', 'much', 'qualifies', 'must', 'have', 'fans', 'show', 'have', 'admit', 'put', 'Amazon', 'wish', 'list', 'weeks', 'birthday', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'wanted', 'pay', 'much', 'what', 'things', 'considered', 'little', 'One', 'problems', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'stage', 'so', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'example', 'get', 'asked', 'one', 'question', 'Roush', 'answers', 'are', 'revealing', 'memorable', 'who', 'stop', 'just', 'one', 'So', 'one', 'hand', 'lament', 'gaps', 'reunion', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'David', 'Boreanez', 'not', 'attendance', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'meant', 'even', 'small', 'slices', 'pie', 'everybody', 'Then', 'have', 'competition', 'comic', 'relief', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'who', 'wicked', 'Susan', 'Lucci', 'comment', 'Gellar', 'way', 'Seth', 'Green', 'who', 'get', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'scarcely', 'have', 'serious', 'word', 'say', 'session', 'James', 'Marsters', 'also', 'willing', 'go', 'joke', 'also', 'several', 'topics', 'one', 'few', 'panelists', 'who', 'would', 'add', 'discussion.Then', 'are', 'questions', 'audience', 'suffer', 'general', 'desire', 'praise', 'cast', 'rather', 'question', 'grave', 'misfortune', 'first', 'question', 'everyone', 'answer', 'having', 'reference', 'BtVS', 'are', 'several', 'minutes', 'panel', 'would', 'want', 'everybody', 'get', 'back', 'course', 'way', 'anything', 'DVD', 'going', 'be', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'BtVS', 'fan', 'still', 'have', 'want', 'little', 'less', 'fat', 'lot', 'more', 'meat', 'only', 'real', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'photos', 'day', 'film', 'almost', 'everybody', 'being', 'shot', 'backstage', 'paparazzi', 'interesting', 'like', 'watching', 'dozens', 'cameras', 'flashing', 'repeatedly', 'high', 'speed', 'amazing', 'photos', 'end', 'up', 'decent', 'lighting', 'Final', 'note', 'something', 'spoiler', 'here', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'reading', 'Season', '8', 'Whedon', 'overseeing', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'comic', 'book', 'daughters', 'are', 'woefully', 'reading', 'issues', 'have', 'been', 'purchasing', 'were', 'stunned', 'hear', 'what', 'Buffy', 'been', 'up', 'course', 'should', 'be', 'incentive', 'get', 'up', 'speed']",2008 PaleyFest: Buffy the Vampire Slayer Reunion
1239145,A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2,B001ULDJU6,Lovblad,"[2, 7]","OK if you are a complete Buffy nut this is a great and funny thing.You see most of the cast (except for D Boreanaz and A Hannigan) reconvene together with the creator J Whedon for a panel discussion following a projection of one episode. the episode apparently was the oen called ""with feeling"" or something like that which was the musical episode, that I did not find that great but anyway the whole cast seemed to get a blast from being allowed to sing, so who am I to complain. Anyway it is interesting to see such a fantastic cast reconvene now 7? or so years after going off the air. I rememeber when Entertainment Weekly announced Buffy Quits or something like that. This show as they say many times did change the way television shows were done and even if during some seaons it went over the board and became a typical newd attraction (there were vampires and pretty girls after all) the show had its moments of greatness and you see why here. While Joss Whedon seems extremely tired, which is surprising, the rest of the cast is in great form and provides lots of interesting information during the panel discussion. you really sense thgis was a family reunion they all wellcomed adn you sense that more could be possible in the future. On the other hand if you are not aBuffy nut, this is to be avoided because it is a panel discussion by the cast about how great the series was and is.

It was really interesting to hear the cast answer questions about different episodes and listening to the humorous exchanges between themselves and the moderator was very enjoyable.

1239148,A2L4XGVPR42KHL,B001ULDJU6,"Therabbitssing ""on the rock that spews lava..""","[3, 3]","I was ecstatic when I saw this. A cast reunion that actually featured Sarah Michelle Gellar who almost never appeared in panels about the show, plus a large majority of the cast.  While we get much of the cast, including Joss and Marti, the large ensemble actually works against itself since one of the questions presented to them was a long ""What is on your ipod and what's your fave movie?"" That's not a fault of the panel, but c'mon.  That question took forever.  Yes, I'm nitpicking but this was actually ind of boring.  Perhaps the chemistry of the audience and the panel was bad, since it really seemed to ""drag"".I know this wasn't a convention audience but, without Seth Green making jokes this would have been quite a boring disc which is surprising because I've seen these people in ""fun"" panels. Heck, the special DVD that was included with the Buffy complete boxset with Joss and a few of them was entertaining.  I'm a collector and got it for completist sake but, it really is a weak session.  I love Buffy, so this was a disappointing pick for me.",3,Seems a little blah...least Seth steps it up a bit,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,1060,"['was', 'ecstatic', 'when', 'saw', 'cast', 'reunion', 'actually', 'featured', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'almost', 'never', 'appeared', 'panels', 'show', 'large', 'majority', 'cast', 'get', 'much', 'cast', 'including', 'Joss', 'Marti', 'large', 'ensemble', 'actually', 'one', 'questions', 'presented', 'was', 'long', 'What', 'ipod', 'what', 'fave', 'movie', 'not', 'fault', 'panel', ""c'mon"", 'question', 'took', 'forever', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'nitpicking', 'was', 'actually', 'ind', 'boring', 'Perhaps', 'chemistry', 'audience', 'panel', 'was', 'bad', 'really', 'seemed', 'drag', '.I', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'convention', 'audience', 'Seth', 'Green', 'making', 'jokes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'boring', 'disc', 'surprising', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'fun', 'panels', 'Heck', 'special', 'DVD', 'was', 'included', 'Buffy', 'complete', 'boxset', 'Joss', 'few', 'was', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'collector', 'got', 'completist', 'sake', 'really', 'weak', 'session', 'love', 'Buffy', 'was', 'disappointing', 'pick']",2008 PaleyFest: Buffy the Vampire Slayer Reunion

It's great to see everyone together again including Sarah Michelle Gellar who is missing for most of the dvd seasons extras. I only gave 4 stars since it would have been nice to see Anthony Head, Alyson Hanigan and maybe David Boreanaz as well. I imagine they are all busy after all Anthony lives in England and Alyson and David both have thriving series of their own now. It was great to see everyone else back together again and there were some very interesting conversations. Some of the fan questions were a little out there but for the most part I thought they were interesting. One of my favorite parts was the interaction between Amber Benson (Tara) and Seth Green (Oz) who were only on the show together for one episode but had both been significant others to Alyson Hangigan's character Willow. Made for some very witty moments. Great stuff.Hope this helps.",4,Great for fans!,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,930,"['die', 'hard', 'fan', 'series', 'need', 'pick', 'up', 'great', 'see', 'everyone', 'together', 'again', 'including', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'missing', 'most', 'dvd', 'seasons', 'extras', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Alyson', 'Hanigan', 'maybe', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'as', 'well', 'imagine', 'are', 'busy', 'Anthony', 'lives', 'England', 'Alyson', 'David', 'have', 'thriving', 'series', 'own', 'now', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'everyone', 'else', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'fan', 'questions', 'were', 'little', 'out', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'thought', 'were', 'interesting', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'was', 'interaction', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'Tara', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Oz', 'who', 'were', 'only', 'show', 'together', 'one', 'episode', 'had', 'been', 'significant', 'others', 'Alyson', 'Hangigan', 'character', 'Willow', 'Made', 'very', 'witty', 'moments', 'Great', 'stuff.Hope']",2008 PaleyFest: Buffy the Vampire Slayer Reunion
