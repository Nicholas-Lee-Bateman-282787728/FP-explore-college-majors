1530565,A5UQAS0EYI85G,B007G4X7VC,cheesefilms,"[3, 5]","This could have been a great series if the storyline and characters were solid and stuck with their original plan, however, along the way an adulterous wife Tess (Leslie Hope) and indifferent son Lincoln (Joe Anderson) become driven to find a man (TV celebrity Dr. Emmit Cole) whom does not wish to be found, nor evidently, understood. In the first sight of tragedy or death, most normal people would flee back to civilization and open a route to and fro, or at least bring back more strength in guns, or personnel, to find the missing man. Instead, we get flighty characters that stay in an indigenous place ABC obviously depicts as a boogiemans paradise, and natives which appear more African than South American, that when given the opportunity, do not serve up the lost Americans, and others, with beans and jungle pork. At least in ""Welcome To The Jungle"" (2007), the jumping camera manages to show body parts and human sacrifices of the sexually charged and stupid young.Note the Blair Witch method of the face on the tent on disc 2. I did like the stories of the dolls, the ghostly kidnappers and the evil spirit, whom seemed to be only a ""jeanie in a bottle"" and tossed overboard, there are some notable horrors here, but as Bruce Greenwood gets more maniacal and his ever searching wife wants her mentally deranged family glued back together, I began to not care for these people anymore. Blinded by some reaction to a jungle chemical, its incredible how these people are convinced to linger on in a place where they are completely clueless where it ends and the pretty lone blonde daughter, Lena (Eloise Mumford) forfeits her opportunity to leave and remain with this insane venture. There is enough cameras and equipment on one ship to retreat with a few seasons of successful horror, but until the camera is dropped and blood filters the camera lenses with screams of an unfinished story, you really don't care what happens anymore. Films today seem to think that an unfinished painting is more successful and appealing than a finished one. The missing Dr. at one point contradicts himself by scolding his camerman in filming a ceremony, yet why he cannot see that his very presence as a scientist and observer might somehow rile the natives to suspicion and even anger, makes no sense at all. This is what tells us that writers ran out of ideas and this is why I lost interest in ""LOST"" when it aired and stopped watching it.

1530566,A3OYLMW1KPOW38,B007G4X7VC,"Desmond M Hassing ""Des""","[3, 6]","It's not uncommon that shows like The River get canceled; TV networks always say they want Sci Fi/horror TV shows, but they always seem to lose faith in them between paying for them and airing them. This unfortunately leads to a great many cult shows all of which are highly involved, require you to watch from episode one in order to keep up and usually they end with an unfulfilled cliffhanger ending. This has resulted in many people avoiding them because they know that if they like the show they will most likely never see a resolution to the storyline.I am writing this review in order to let you know that you won't be unsatisfied with The River. While the story is formatted in such a way that it obviously still has unresolved plot points and does have a storyline they were intending to continue, the producers of the show seemed to approach it like an author does a book in a series so this 8 episode season has a begin, middle and end, it just happens that it is part of a larger story.

1530567,A1AZ2GJ6S8SUCE,B007G4X7VC,Elizabeth Kuntz,"[3, 4]","The River, which premiered in 2012, centers on a search-and-rescue operation for Dr. Emmett Cole, a TV show host known world-wide that went missing somewhere in the Amazon. With his son and wife leading the search party, they make it to the Amazon, only to encounter something beyond explanation. Like Dr. Emmett Cole says at the end of every episode on his show The Undiscovered Country, ""There's magic out there.""Produced by Orin Peli and Steven Spielberg, The River is a terrifying and imaginative drama that goes outside the box. With the recent hits of the ""found-footage"" sub-genre in horror, ABC brought in a TV show with the same formula of filming, but with a cast, plot and visuals that are delivered spectacularly. Joe Anderson was great as Lincoln Cole, the son of Emmett, but it was Thomas Kretschmann who stole the show as Kurt, the mysterious bodyguard who protects the crew as they traverse the Boiuna. Sadly, for some stupidly annoying reason, the network decided to can the series (like a lot of phenomenal shows including Firefly, Daybreak, and Invasion). With a season of only 8 episodes, the writers were able to create something extraordinary, but leave a great many questions unanswered as the show was canceled. Like Lost, The River takes us to a place we know nothing about, and the rules of reality are broken. This show isn't for everyone, but anyone who appreciates thrillers, mystery, sci-fi/fantasy and supernatural dramas, this show is perfect. Hopefully, someone gets a campaign started to bring the show back for one more season because there is still plenty of room to answer and bring to light questions and answers. Kickstarter right now is doing well with bringing back TV shows, so let's get The River back for at least one more season of 13-14 episodes.",5,A Thrilling Drama Unlike Any Other,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,1792,"['River', 'premiered', '2012', 'centers', 'search-and-rescue', 'operation', 'Dr.', 'Emmett', 'Cole', 'TV', 'show', 'host', 'known', 'world-wide', 'went', 'missing', 'somewhere', 'Amazon', 'son', 'wife', 'leading', 'search', 'party', 'make', 'Amazon', 'only', 'encounter', 'something', 'explanation', 'Dr.', 'Emmett', 'Cole', 'end', 'episode', 'show', 'Undiscovered', 'Country', 'magic', 'there', 'Produced', 'Orin', 'Peli', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'River', 'terrifying', 'imaginative', 'drama', 'box', 'recent', 'hits', 'found-footage', 'sub-genre', 'horror', 'ABC', 'brought', 'TV', 'show', 'same', 'formula', 'filming', 'cast', 'plot', 'visuals', 'are', 'delivered', 'spectacularly', 'Joe', 'Anderson', 'was', 'great', 'Lincoln', 'Cole', 'son', 'Emmett', 'was', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'Kurt', 'mysterious', 'bodyguard', 'who', 'crew', 'traverse', 'Boiuna', 'Sadly', 'stupidly', 'annoying', 'reason', 'network', 'decided', 'can', 'series', 'lot', 'phenomenal', 'shows', 'including', 'Firefly', 'Daybreak', 'Invasion', 'season', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'writers', 'were', 'able', 'create', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'leave', 'great', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'Lost', 'River', 'place', 'know', 'nothing', 'rules', 'reality', 'are', 'broken', 'show', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'anyone', 'who', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'supernatural', 'dramas', 'show', 'perfect', 'Hopefully', 'someone', 'campaign', 'started', 'bring', 'show', 'back', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'still', 'plenty', 'room', 'answer', 'bring', 'light', 'questions', 'answers', 'Kickstarter', 'right', 'now', 'doing', 'well', 'bringing', 'back', 'TV', 'shows', 'let', 'get', 'River', 'back', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'season', '13-14', 'episodes']",The River: Season 1

1530569,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B007G4X7VC,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[6, 12]","I entered into THE RIVER as a program mostly due to the idea that good suspense-horror television is very rare, and from casting actors like Bruce Greenwood and Leslie Hope, it seemed like it would be a good pick. To be totally fair, the pilot episode is very strong. While light on things like creating interesting characters (Greenwood only appears in TV footage and he has a more fleshed-out character in his few minutes on screen than any of the other characters combined), it was heavy on creating atmosphere and terror and mystery. The conceit of the show really being two things:1. It's another ""found-footage"" experiment from Oren Peli, the mastermind (if such a word can be used) of the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise.2. There is actual magic out there, and it's not just a tagline, and that's what Emmet Cole was searching for.Again, in the interest of fairness, I don't mind the ""found footage"" idea. It's propelled some very solid filmmaking likeThe Blair Witch Project [Blu-ray] andCloverfield [Blu-ray] andThe Last Exorcism [Blu-ray]. Of course, once something has been a proven success, the gimmick becomes over-exploited. There's going to be a third PARANORMAL ACTIVITY film, and there was the recent attempt of making a ""found footage"" comedy with the flop PROJECT X. With THE RIVER, the conceit can only last so long before it's obvious that there are moments on-screen that simply cannot be captured with multiple angles as they show. It also confines us to learning about the characters via more ""found footage"" or through on-camera interviews. I realize that the whole object of the show, despite the travel being done on the world's longest river, it's extremely claustrophobic since most of the show is set on-board The Magus. While that might work well for the terror and suspense, it's lousy for character development. Without good characters and good character work, it's very hard for an audience to maintain interest over several hours.Then there are the characters themselves: They're so stock that it's almost embarrassing. You have the wounded yet devoted wife; the handsome, belligerent, resentful son; the son's pretty first love; the slimy and cuckolded euro-trash producer; the cocky and skillful cameraman; the silent and mysterious mercenary; the working-class grease-encrusted loyal mechanic; the spiritually-connected child who is the only one who sees the bad things to come and everyone ignores her.The biggest problem that the program has isn't the lack of character development or the stock dialogue or the telegraphed shock moments. The biggest problem the show has is that not just the network, but the creators REALLY want this show to be the next LOST. It's been a while since ABC has had a phenomenon like LOST they can call their own, and they thought they found it in THE RIVER. The show also wants to create an all-too-similar atmosphere: secrets of the past, isolation, desperation, foreign territory, fear, and a series of weird ""WTF?!?!"" moments. Sadly, they've hamstrung themselves from allowing natural character growth to happen by confining the series to the ""found footage"" genre and while some people loved LOST because of those same kinds of story moments, most viewers loved LOST because of the characters. THE RIVER can't reach those heights.My intent here is not to get on a soapbox and tell you how much I miss LOST and how I wish this show was more like it. My intent is to demonstrate how, in many ways, this show wants to be LOST and falls short in every way. I watched the first four episodes and had the remaining four on my DVR for far too long. I just couldn't find the interest in me to continue watching. I didn't care about any of the characters, other than Greenwood, and frankly, the whole show fails primarily because it's shackled itself to only one format of storytelling. That's fine for a film, but it's death for a serialized television program.",2,"Up The Creek, and This Show Has NO Paddles.",1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,3927,"['entered', 'THE', 'RIVER', 'program', 'mostly', 'due', 'idea', 'good', 'suspense-horror', 'television', 'very', 'rare', 'casting', 'actors', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'pick', 'be', 'totally', 'fair', 'pilot', 'episode', 'very', 'strong', 'light', 'things', 'creating', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Greenwood', 'only', 'TV', 'footage', 'more', 'fleshed-out', 'character', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'other', 'characters', 'combined', 'was', 'heavy', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'terror', 'mystery', 'conceit', 'show', 'really', 'being', 'two', 'things:1', 'found-footage', 'experiment', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'mastermind', 'word', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'franchise.2', 'actual', 'magic', 'there', 'not', 'just', 'tagline', 'what', 'Emmet', 'Cole', 'was', 'searching', 'for.Again', 'interest', 'fairness', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'found', 'footage', 'idea', 'propelled', 'very', 'solid', 'filmmaking', 'likeThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'andCloverfield', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Last', 'Exorcism', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'course', 'once', 'something', 'been', 'proven', 'success', 'gimmick', 'over-exploited', 'going', 'be', 'third', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'film', 'was', 'recent', 'attempt', 'making', 'found', 'footage', 'comedy', 'flop', 'PROJECT', 'X', 'THE', 'RIVER', 'conceit', 'can', 'only', 'last', 'so', 'long', 'obvious', 'are', 'moments', 'on-screen', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'captured', 'multiple', 'angles', 'show', 'also', 'learning', 'characters', 'more', 'found', 'footage', 'on-camera', 'interviews', 'realize', 'whole', 'object', 'show', 'travel', 'being', 'done', 'world', 'longest', 'river', 'extremely', 'claustrophobic', 'most', 'show', 'set', 'on-board', 'Magus', 'might', 'work', 'well', 'terror', 'suspense', 'lousy', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'characters', 'good', 'character', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'audience', 'maintain', 'interest', 'several', 'hours.Then', 'are', 'characters', ""'re"", 'so', 'stock', 'almost', 'embarrassing', 'have', 'wounded', 'yet', 'devoted', 'wife', 'handsome', 'belligerent', 'resentful', 'son', 'son', 'pretty', 'first', 'slimy', 'cuckolded', 'euro-trash', 'producer', 'cocky', 'skillful', 'cameraman', 'silent', 'mysterious', 'mercenary', 'working-class', 'grease-encrusted', 'loyal', 'mechanic', 'spiritually-connected', 'child', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'bad', 'things', 'come', 'everyone', 'her.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'program', ""n't"", 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'stock', 'dialogue', 'telegraphed', 'shock', 'moments', 'biggest', 'problem', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'network', 'creators', 'REALLY', 'want', 'show', 'be', 'next', 'LOST', 'been', 'while', 'ABC', 'had', 'phenomenon', 'LOST', 'can', 'call', 'own', 'thought', 'found', 'THE', 'RIVER', 'show', 'also', 'create', 'all-too-similar', 'atmosphere', 'secrets', 'past', 'isolation', 'desperation', 'foreign', 'territory', 'fear', 'series', 'weird', 'WTF', 'moments', 'Sadly', ""'ve"", 'hamstrung', 'allowing', 'natural', 'character', 'growth', 'happen', 'confining', 'series', 'found', 'footage', 'genre', 'people', 'loved', 'LOST', 'same', 'kinds', 'story', 'moments', 'most', 'viewers', 'loved', 'LOST', 'characters', 'RIVER', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reach', 'heights.My', 'intent', 'here', 'not', 'get', 'soapbox', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'miss', 'LOST', 'how', 'wish', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'intent', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'be', 'LOST', 'short', 'way', 'watched', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'had', 'remaining', 'four', 'DVR', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'interest', 'continue', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'other', 'Greenwood', 'frankly', 'whole', 'show', 'primarily', 'shackled', 'only', 'one', 'format', 'storytelling', 'fine', 'film', 'death', 'serialized', 'television', 'program']",The River: Season 1

1530573,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007G4X7VC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[63, 69]","In the primetime TV landscape, the usual program options have become increasingly formulaic, predictable and safe.  With more than half of all network dramas being variations on the crime procedural, something that bucks the trend really has the potential to stand out.  Even riskier is trying to adapt a horror offering within the strictures of regular TV in an era when audiences seem to clamor for more explicit and graphic thrills (see FX's delightfully loopy and crazed American Horror Story for something that really pushes the boundaries of conventional fare as it has much more freedom on cable).  So I commend ABC executives for greenlighting the interesting  eight-part experiment by filmmaker Oren Peli (who made a name for himself with Paranormal Activity).  He shares the creator credit for this show with Michael R. Perry (he was also a writer on Paranormal Activity 2), a TV veteran who has dabbled in the horror genre before penning episodes of the underrated and short-lived ""American Gothic"" and Chris Carter's ""X Files"" follow-up ""Millennium.""  While not always perfect, therefore, ""The River"" certainly has the distinction of feeling different and that's undeniably a good thing.The idea behind ""The River"" is a good one.  Bruce Greenwood plays a popular TV naturist who disappears while on an expedition in the Brazilian wilds.  He and his crew are presumed dead.  His wife (Leslie Hope) and estranged son (Joe Anderson) put together another documentary crew in an effort to find, and hopefully rescue, the missing men.  Trying to piece together what happened through found footage, this new team faces increasingly strange and deadly obstacles the deeper they go.  And it becomes abundantly clear that this voyage will have a body count as they seem to be pursuing a location known ominously as the Source.  Will it hold the answers they desire?  Is Greenwood alive?  And will all the random horror elements be pulled together to make sense within a greater plot overview?The Good:Setting:  For me, the best thing about ""The River"" is its unusual premise. ABC was so quick to try to brand this the next ""Lost"" that it overlooked that the two shows have very little common ground.  The unexplored jungles and the claustrophobic confines of the river boat lend an unusual backdrop to the unfolding drama.  Also, it just looks great.Style:  While the found footage genre has been a bit overworked since the ""Blair Witch Project"" confirmed its commercial viability, it is effective and different to see it employed in series television.  As the horrors are unraveled through quick and random camera shots (either through the crew cameramen or through stationary cameras on the ship), the quick glimpses of danger can make things quite unsettling.The Bad:Poor Research:  For a show that takes place in Brazil, someone might have noted that they speak Portuguese there as opposed to Spanish.  Conveniently, everyone they meet on this jungle excursion into Brazil speaks English or Spanish so don't worry about language barriers!Ambient Sound:  When strange things are happening, the program ramps up the sound effects and music to overwhelming proportions.  Call me crazy, but I'd rather the dialogue was louder than the lapping of waves while characters in the river are conversing.The Indifferent:Rushed Beginning:  The show takes but a few minutes to establish the characters before setting them adrift.  It takes a while before we know anyone, much less care about them, and this lessens the impact of the earlier episodes.  Stick around, though, things get better.Horrors:  The show aims for creepy more than scary, and that it achieves.  Network TV is not a great place for in-your-face monstrosities, and within those limitations, the format does a good job providing some jolts.  But our crew experiences such a diverse collection of nightmares, it seems like the creators just wanted to throw everything but the kitchen sink at us and see what stuck.  Monsters, possessions, spirits, curses, natives: the mysterious and mystical horrors encompass just about everything you can think of.  It's almost too much.  And, of course, the mechanic's daughter is the requisite character that seems to know ANYTHING and EVERYTHING about these supernatural occurrences so that they can be ""logically"" explained to the TV audience.Hit or Miss Ending:  The 7th episode explains Greenwood's fate, but raises more questions than it answers.  The screenplay and the characters are content to let most things go down without much contemplation.  I did, however, like the finale's (8th episode) turn of events before the take-it-or-leave-it final scene.I know people that both love ""The River"" and hate it.  I can fully understand either position.  But taken for what it is, it provides something different on television and that is an invaluable commodity in the land of cookie-cutter TV.  At eight episodes, it isn't a huge time commitment and I was pleased enough to go along for the ride.  I don't know that ten years from now that I'll be remembering the show as a classic, but for the moment--it was something that I enjoyed and would recommend for the right audience.  About 3 1/2 stars.

I gotta say I never watch shows like this but the way it was shot and the setting made me get interested in it in the first place. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. but it was really good, I googled around to see if there was a season 2, but all I saw was about it getting canceled from the channel that originally aired it which I think was abc? not sure, but Im very disappointed that there is no follow up season, you can only conclude from the ending that they never was able to leave and all eventually died. which with the ending they left us with it coulda been so much more if they had a season 2. so yes this is a good show, but because there is no season 2 and an open ending makes me sad to have watched it, I guess thats because I cant stand movies or shows that leave you with no real ending.
