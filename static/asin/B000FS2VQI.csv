I had never heard of this show, and are always looking for something educational and fun for them to view.  My grandson liked the episodes about Lola's eating vegetables, and taking care of their dog.  The siblings are kind and happy with one another in the show.  All the other characters are kind and fun to watch as well.The video shows really well.  There are extras also included.

994330,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000FS2VQI,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[19, 20]","""Charlie and Lola"" is a delightful series based on books by Lauren Child. It is seen on Playhouse Disney in the United States and on CBeebies in Great Britain.In this series, Charlie has a little sister named Lola who is small and very funny. Charlie often helps Lola with her problems and though they have some sibling rivalry at times, they are usually pretty nice with each other. Lola often has an unusual way of seeing things, or can be a bit stubborn, but Charlie helps her to look at things in a new way or to try new things.This DVD features seven stories from the first season of the show --- ""I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato"" (based on the first C+L book), ""We Do Promise Honestly We Can Look After Your Dog,"" ""I Love Going to Granny and Grandpa's, It's Just That...,"" ""I'm Far Too Extremely Busy, ""It's a Secret,"" ""I'm Just Not Keen on Spiders"" and ""I'm Not Feeling Well.""The animation is unique and fun to look at. The main theme and background music are all very catchy. The British-accented dialogue and phrases also add a lot to the series.""Charlie and Lola"" airs full-screen on Playhouse Disney, but it is presented in widescreen on the DVD. Close-captioning is not offered --- there are subtitles instead. The DVD also includes a few bonuses / surprises --- watch for them to pop up while both on the main and episode-selection menus.",5,Charlie and Lola Comes to DVD,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,1354,"['Charlie', 'Lola', 'delightful', 'series', 'based', 'books', 'Lauren', 'Child', 'seen', 'Playhouse', 'Disney', 'United', 'States', 'CBeebies', 'Great', 'Britain.In', 'series', 'Charlie', 'little', 'sister', 'named', 'Lola', 'who', 'small', 'very', 'funny', 'Charlie', 'often', 'Lola', 'problems', 'have', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'times', 'are', 'usually', 'pretty', 'nice', 'other', 'Lola', 'often', 'unusual', 'way', 'seeing', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'stubborn', 'Charlie', 'look', 'things', 'new', 'way', 'try', 'new', 'things.This', 'DVD', 'features', 'seven', 'stories', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'Will', 'Not', 'Ever', 'Never', 'Eat', 'Tomato', 'based', 'first', 'C+L', 'book', 'Do', 'Promise', 'Honestly', 'Can', 'Look', 'Your', 'Dog', 'Love', 'Going', 'Granny', 'Grandpa', 'Just', ""'m"", 'Far', 'Too', 'Extremely', 'Busy', 'Secret', ""'m"", 'Just', 'Not', 'Keen', 'Spiders', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Feeling', 'Well', 'animation', 'unique', 'fun', 'look', 'main', 'theme', 'background', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'catchy', 'British-accented', 'dialogue', 'phrases', 'also', 'add', 'lot', 'series', 'Charlie', 'Lola', 'full-screen', 'Playhouse', 'Disney', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'Close-captioning', 'not', 'offered', 'are', 'subtitles', 'instead', 'DVD', 'also', 'few', 'bonuses', '/', 'surprises', 'watch', 'pop', 'up', 'main', 'episode-selection', 'menus']","Charlie and Lola, Vol. 1"

I really like the fact that it is voiced by actual children (rather than the usual voice-over actors), and having the British characters introduces a different culture and manner of speaking to children.I also really like the fact that it does not use snark or sarcasm to get the point across or to entertain. Don't get me wrong - I love snark and sarcasm, but I'd really like to wait to introduce that to my toddler, you know?Charlie loves his little sister Lola, and they have a healthy, loving relationship. He has no problem helping to look after her, and the fact that he will go to lengths to cheer her up and make her feel better is excellent to see.The animation is cute, too.
