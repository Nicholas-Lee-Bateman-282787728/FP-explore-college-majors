It defines the sabotage involved, and illustrates the detrimental impact on infrastructure and the fabric of American life in general.  The lives lost (and taken) in this ""informal war"" (reminds me of the Korean War) are just so unnecessary, and should never have happened!  The foment is artificial, and of a very disruptive nature (as in deliberate).  The definition of an outlaw is one who violates one law after another, with no concern for the cumulative effect.  This DVD illustrates the current,  salient, and active endorsement by some factions of pure lawlessness.  This is also part of the definition of anarchy, the complement of chaos!",5,Illegal immigration!!!,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,735,"['Outstanding', 'clarification', 'problem', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'why', 'must', 'solve', 'sabotage', 'involved', 'detrimental', 'impact', 'infrastructure', 'fabric', 'American', 'life', 'general', 'lives', 'lost', 'taken', 'informal', 'war', 'Korean', 'War', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'unnecessary', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'foment', 'artificial', 'very', 'disruptive', 'nature', 'deliberate', 'definition', 'outlaw', 'one', 'who', 'one', 'law', 'concern', 'cumulative', 'effect', 'DVD', 'current', 'salient', 'active', 'endorsement', 'factions', 'pure', 'lawlessness', 'also', 'part', 'definition', 'anarchy', 'complement', 'chaos']",Border War: The Battle over Illegal Immigration

They feel entitled to our goods and services.  We owe it to them. After all, they believe we initially ripped off these items from their own country.  This is especially true of countless Mexican illegals.  Americans are supposedly disgusting imperialists.  The makers of the Border War documentary go to great lengths to provide ample time for the participants to express their views.  And this is even true concerning one gentleman who is ardently pro-illegal alien.  He was treated quite fairly.Border War clearly shows the ecological damage caused by these illegals.  Crime has risen in the areas of Arizona most impacted by the crisis.  Sometimes police officers are murdered. Hospitals have had to close due to the nonpayment of their services.  Both Republican and Democratic politicians, however, usually could care less.  Major GOP donors see the illegals as providers of cheap labor and Democrats see them as eventual voters.  The longer term harm to the United States is ignored merely to satisfy some people's selfish short term goals.  Is the film dated?  Should the fact that it was made a few years ago deter you?  Nope, not in the least.  Border War serves as a splendid introduction.  It should significantly add to your understanding of this serious threat to our national unity and financial stability.

Sorensen ""Old Keen Eye""","[11, 24]","This DVD is terrbily narrowminded and fails to give an accurate reresentation of many of the truths behind illegal immigration. They take the popular point of view, that view being that illegals are ruining the country and they are all criminals etc. Folks, there is a lot more to it than that and there is another story that is not shown here.
