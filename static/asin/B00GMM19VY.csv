It is kind of scary...and you know what, I am most definitely sure we are still being poisoned today with some of these man-made materials and until there is some kind of pattern they won't know it until years  and too many people have died because of greed.  I very much recommend this DVD, it is just fascinating (the study of people and industry)",5,Fascinating!!!,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,405,"['Wow', 'things', 'America', 'used', 'do', 'get', 'away', 'kind', 'scary', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'most', 'definitely', 'sure', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'poisoned', 'today', 'man-made', 'materials', 'kind', 'pattern', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'years', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'died', 'greed', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'just', 'fascinating', 'study', 'people', 'industry']",American Experience: Poisoner's Handbook

He does get it wrong sometimes though and he even helps a murderess get off twice , only to his horror realize that on the third time that she was guilty all along.  There's many stories here and this would make a great movie! HE looked at over 100,000 cases in his long career which begins way back in the early 1900's.  You will learn a lot here and it's a good thing men like this existed. The show is full of recreations with a good narrator to provide information as well. So it's a entertaining watch from start to finish.",5,how forensic science came to be ...,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,697,"['incredible', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'doctors', 'story', 'create', 'forensic', 'science', 'regard', 'poisoning', 'why', 'form', 'murder', 'so', 'rare', 'now', 'get', 'wrong', 'sometimes', 'even', 'murderess', 'get', 'twice', 'only', 'horror', 'realize', 'third', 'time', 'was', 'guilty', 'along', 'many', 'stories', 'here', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'HE', 'looked', '100,000', 'cases', 'long', 'career', 'way', 'back', 'early', '1900', 'will', 'learn', 'lot', 'here', 'good', 'thing', 'men', 'existed', 'show', 'full', 'recreations', 'good', 'narrator', 'provide', 'information', 'well', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'start', 'finish']",American Experience: Poisoner's Handbook

It does illustrate however, before forensic evidence became a precise science, poisoning was the most popular and successful way to commit murder. Thanks to Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler, it eventually became one of the least successful methods to get away with.This program also shows how many incredibly toxic, deadly substances believed to be innocuous or actually beneficial, were as easy to obtain as a loaf of bread.",4,NOT WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,493,"['title', 'NOT', 'lesson', 'how', 'kill', 'people', 'illustrate', 'however', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'became', 'precise', 'science', 'poisoning', 'was', 'most', 'popular', 'successful', 'way', 'commit', 'murder', 'Thanks', 'Charles', 'Norris', 'Alexander', 'Gettler', 'eventually', 'became', 'one', 'least', 'successful', 'methods', 'get', 'away', 'with.This', 'program', 'also', 'how', 'many', 'incredibly', 'toxic', 'deadly', 'substances', 'believed', 'be', 'innocuous', 'actually', 'beneficial', 'were', 'easy', 'obtain', 'loaf', 'bread']",American Experience: Poisoner's Handbook

It is filled with old pictures and film footage of New York City in the early 1900's and was very enjoyable tying in the development of medicine, and forensic to history and society.  I also recommend the book that this video was based on title The poisoner's Handbook:  Murder and the birth of forensics in Jazz age NY.
