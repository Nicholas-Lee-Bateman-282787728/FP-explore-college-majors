Jamaican English Teacher, Hortense who felt that if she could get to the Motherland (England) all her dreams would come true so she schemes against her friend and marries her beau Gilbert but secretly holds out hope that her childhood sweetheart Michael will come to his senses and fulfills the dream they've always talked about. Then there's Queenie who married for convenience and finds her days caring for her shell-shocked father-in-law while her husband goes off to war. She then encounters a Jamaican man that leaves her more than she bargained for. Then there's Gilbert who wants nothing more than to be treated equally and to be a good husband if given half a chance. He was such a good person with a great sense of humor. He was just what Hortense needed to bring her down a peg. Any other man would've broken her spirit.The book as well as the movie is outstandingly told with so much passion about lost love, longing, acceptance and the desire for a better life.

1336697,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,B003CP1T50,Lola's Mom,"[0, 0]","I did not read the book. I am not sure why I first passed on the book when I heard of it, but when I discovered there was a movie based on it...well, to be frank, there are millions of historical fiction books I can read, but very very few period dramas I can watch, so there you go.In the three hours this movie played, I laughed (&#34;I get perish in here.&#34;), cried, nodded my head in agreement, just went through every emotion possible. On the screen we see Jamaica and England both, from the pre-WWII years to the period just after. We see men fighting for the same thing, the same damn thing--freedom from tyranny and oppression--and yet on the homefront, the West Indians, the people of color cannot get their own freedom.Hortense, Gilbert, and Michael--as Michael says--go from one small island to another, each island containing the same small minds. But they have big dreams and it's fulfilling in the end, watching these people--just when you think their lives are at rock bottom--fulfill those dreams. While left hanging about Queenie and Michael's lives, we at least know that Gilbert and Hortense find happiness.But, gosh, is a long way there. Hortense is a really hard character to like. Her upbringing, her broken heart, perhaps has made her that way and if anyone can through to her it would the charming, funny, sweet Gilbert. While all the women in the movie were drooling over Michael--a cad who preys on lonely married women--Gilbert totally stole my heart. I was ready to jump into the TV screen, murder Hortense, and take him for myself, and yes, I'd make him the best damn fish and chips if that's what it took. LOLI thought it was fascinating the way Jamaica was back then, how they were taught England was the motherland and they all thought everyone there was wealthy, with electricity in their homes, and doorbells...and it was sad to watch the people face the truth, that while they may adore the motherland, the motherland doesn't adore them. Hortense can't even teach in England. They get called names in the street. We see a lot of prejudice.The only main player NOT immigrating from Jamaica is Queenie, a white married woman who married not for love, but lack of choice. And just when she feels dead inside, something comes along to make her feel alive. She faces a world of heartbreak and at times doesn't make the best of choices.Long review short: Costumes: loved them. Issues brought up in the movie: racism, infidelity, loneliness, war, how demons are not &#34;in&#34; us, but &#34;out there&#34; (I'm not going to explain that one. It would spoil), shell shock or battle fatigue. The acting: impeccable, especially whoever it is that plays Queenie. It is a very thought-evoking movie with real issues that England faced during that time period. I felt it makes a fabulous tribute to those who immigrated from the West Indies, faced and overcame these issues, and made their dreams come true despite all the odds.Do not let the three-hour length deter you.

Ruth Wilson (who I knew from a Jane Eyre film adaptation) is sensual and stunning. Naomie Harris (from Pirates of the Caribbean) is the very definition of poise and perfection.&#34;Small Island&#34; tells the story of two women: Hortense and Queenie. Jamaican schoolteacher Hortense dreams of bigger and better things, and Yorkshire former-shopgirl Queenie has to pull herself up by her bootstraps as her RAF husband, Bernard, does not return home from the war. She does what she has to do to make a living for herself and her father-in-law ... and she finds passionate love along the way - in the arms of a Jamaican man named Michael. My heart melted for Benedict's character, Bernard, as I watched on screen the love affair mounting between Michael and Queenie. Harris' character, Hortense, had not married her husband for love, either, and I greatly admired the patience that built in Gilbert's heart for his new bride. Gilbert was a fantastic character - he had so many great lines!I liked the way this movie ended for the WWII characters before it slowly melted into present-day. I feel like the narration greatly helped &#34;Small Island,&#34; and gave me a better sense of what the characters were thinking and feeling.This was a very beautiful movie and will leave you with all sorts of cozy and sentimental feelings.",5,"Beautiful, Magical, & Moving!",1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,1435,"['loved', 'loved', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Sherlock', 'celebrity', 'crush', 'as', 'fabulous', 'ever', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'who', 'knew', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'film', 'adaptation', 'sensual', 'stunning', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'very', 'definition', 'poise', 'perfection.', '34', 'Small', 'Island', '34', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'Hortense', 'Queenie', 'Jamaican', 'schoolteacher', 'Hortense', 'dreams', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'Yorkshire', 'former-shopgirl', 'Queenie', 'pull', 'up', 'bootstraps', 'RAF', 'husband', 'Bernard', 'not', 'return', 'home', 'war', 'what', 'do', 'make', 'living', 'herself', 'father-in-law', 'passionate', 'love', 'way', 'arms', 'Jamaican', 'man', 'named', 'Michael', 'heart', 'melted', 'Benedict', 'character', 'Bernard', 'watched', 'screen', 'love', 'affair', 'mounting', 'Michael', 'Queenie', 'Harris', 'character', 'Hortense', 'had', 'not', 'married', 'husband', 'love', 'greatly', 'admired', 'patience', 'Gilbert', 'heart', 'new', 'bride', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'fantastic', 'character', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'lines', 'liked', 'way', 'movie', 'ended', 'WWII', 'characters', 'slowly', 'melted', 'present-day', 'feel', 'narration', 'greatly', 'helped', '34', 'Small', 'Island', '34', 'gave', 'better', 'sense', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'thinking', 'feeling.This', 'was', 'very', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'sorts', 'cozy', 'sentimental', 'feelings']",N/A

But the same friend asked me over, and after a day that went against what I had hoped it would turn out, this movie was the prize of an otherwise sad day.For one, Small Island is sort of my own family's story for there are those within my family that moved to England and served in the Her Majesty's service during World War 2; I know of an maternal uncle who did. I also know of people who left the islands just after the second World War for England as well as the United States. I have heard my mother speak of people she knew who served during World War 2 from her island but I found it hard to conceive that the British thought the very same of those from the Caribbean. When Gilbert went through the altercation with the men in the mailroom, I actually cried. I cried for a young man who in his own way tried to do right by his mother country, but didn't return him the same courtesy. I almost cried for Queenie(she was a lady ahead of her time here)when she gave up her precious parcel to Gilbert and Hortense, but she was trying in her own way to give that child a fighting chance, but I held it in.Though with it's brief nudity, they are quite tasteful, profanity brief, violence there, the movie is very good and I highly recommend it. You see you hear so much of America's part in the War, but rarely do you hear of those of the Caribbean who wore a uniform for Her Majesty and were not always treated fairly for it either. It's like the Jamaican friend of Gilbert said when he was going to sign up for the RAF, them British don't do nothing but LIE to you all the time, and he had a point. Check it out; a great way to check out things as they were.",4,Great Period Piece.
