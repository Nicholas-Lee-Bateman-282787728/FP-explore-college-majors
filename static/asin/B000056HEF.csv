Willie Gingrich (Matthau) his brother-in-law is a ambulance-chasing attorney who sees a chance for a major settlement.  He pleads with Harry to exaggerate the extent of his injury and then sues the football team, the network and the stadium for a vast amount of money.  Meanwhile  Boom Boom feels guilty he has injured a man so badly, and suspends his career to care for Willie.  Willie calls in Harry's ex-wife when Harry starts to waffle on carrying the scheme forward.  Harry's ex wife (Judi West) is an aspiring singer whose renewed compassion for Willie, seems to be enhanced by the thought of money.  Harry and Willie also realize they are being followed and taped by detectives hired by the insurance company.  They rent an apartment across the street to follow every move.  Soon Harry tires of the deception, he becomes guilt-ridden for exploiting the innocent football player.  He is also disgusted with the ease his ex can be bribed to get money for a vain self-centered singing career.  Willie, however, won't have this!

I was aware of the storyline and I knew that Lemmon and Matthau would make quite a team and I was right.  The ""Odd Couple"" personalities are in view and the writing is excellent with Billy Wilder replacing Neil Simon.  However, I kept getting the sense that this movie is too long.  There are some side stories that could be diminished or even eliminated.  I'm not talking about the ""Boom Boom"" Jackson character.  Rather, there seemed to be a lot of redundencies throughout the movie.  The private eye gets too much coverage as does the insurance company representatives.  The ex-wife is a nice twist to the plot but we got the idea early and didn't need such an extensive development of the renewed relationship.  There are other examples as well but I think I may be emphasizing this too much.The end was not as I had expected although not greatly off the mark.  However, the movie is not centered around the plot so much as it is around the interaction between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.  Matthau won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his preformance in what would appear to have been a leading role.
