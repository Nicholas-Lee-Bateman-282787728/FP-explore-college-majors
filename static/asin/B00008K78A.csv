From a ""war film geek"" perspective, it seemed to have the right feel for the planning, rehearsal and execution of the raid itself.  Don't expect slick/flashy like one might with American treatment of things military.The feel of the film is that of the era:  very 70's, with music verging on the feel of ""blaxspoitation"" in some parts.The film is not perfect:  at least one accidental appearance of a boom mike in the shot, and some of the long shots of the hijacked plane were of a 707 instead of an Airbus.  In spite of these niggles, it's a good watch - a welcome addition to my war flick collection.P.S. - It's a bit pricey, but having the documentary on the second disk makes it worthwhile.

743556,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00008K78A,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[12, 13]","MIVTSA YONATAN (a/k/a/ OPERATION THUNDERBOLT) from 1977 is one of my favorite albeit mostly forgotten films. It tells the story of the 27 June 1976 hijacking of an Air France flight out of Tel Aviv, putting it in the hands of the PLO by way of German and Palestinian terrorists (among them a coterie of those annoying socialist-revolutionary Germans, such as we saw in the 2008 film DAS BAADEN MEINHOF KOMPLEX, see my review if you can find it).The great Klaus Kinski as Wilfried Boese is chilling in his matter-of-fact shoving around of Israeli citizens. One of them asks him of all people (because he's German) what he means to accomplish ... wondering to Kinski aloud if the NAZI horrors hadn't been enough. Kinski's acting is sensitive enough for him to demonstrate a shocking reaction to the question.All that, and more, makes this a deeply personal film for me. I'd only seen the dreadful 1976 offering RAID ON ENTEBBE (Entebbe is the Ugandan town where the hijacked plane was hidden), and that same year we saw television's VICTORY AT ENTEBBE starring Sir Anthony Hopkins--just as dreary and unexciting.But in OPERATION THUNDERBOLT, they really moved to get this exacting version on film. That was thrilling--seeing how people waited for years to see what exactly happened in Munich (see Spielberg's MUNICH). This was one weird situation, with Israeli citizens being held captive in Uganda in exchange for the release of Israeli-held Palestinian ""prisoners"", all engineered by Col. Moammar Qadaffi and with the full cooperation of Idi Amin Dada. As they say, you couldn't write this stuff.This film sags a great deal where it shouldn't; yet it is so far ahead of its time. At certain moments it almost looks like an episode of ""COPS"", but then when there is shooting, you see the operatic victims and ketchup/blood. Oh well, it was the 70s.Yet this is a nobly great film, and I find it more compelling than the other 2 film versions I know so well. As far as I know some of it at least was shot in Israel, and the government had a hand in it. We get a few jarring you-are-there scenes that hadn't been done in film before.Yehoram Gaon gives an interesting half-amateur half-pro performance as Col. Yonatan Netanyahu, the leader of the raid itself. I won't mention the others because there is absolutely no one recognizable to American audiences, unless you watched a lot of Israeli TV in the 70s.This film has a compelling score, some awesome sound engineering and a very accurate feel for events at Entebbe. Although the Idi Amin Dada here (some scene-chewing by Mark Heath) is not as chilling as the screwy Yaphet Kotto inRaid on Entebbe, or the horrifying Forest Whitaker inThe Last King of Scotland, it still a performance that drives home what this man represented to our world. CREEPY!! Thank God the man is dead!Also rather odd, but I've often seen OPERATION THUNDERBOLT billed as the only ""authenticated"" telling of the events of the Entebbe Rescue Mission. I wonder what that's supposed to mean. All the film versions show just about the same thing.This always leads me to the fate of dear old Mrs. Dora Bloch, the lady I recall hearing about; she was taken to whatever hospital is near Entebbe and I know she was left behind when they finished the rescue. Since I originally wrote this review, I researched and found Mrs. Bloch had a bit of a heart problem but they ended up abusing/torturing her to death at that hospital. I can't recall how many months it took for anyone to learn her fate. (Thanks to my recent comment poster.)I tell you, every time I even think about her I CRY. And I keep crying until my wife helps me out of it.Do not deprive yourself and miss the chance to at least watch and study this extremely compelling work. It is must-see filmmaking at its level best, because contrary to usual film, this one is no place for showboaters, hotdogs or prima donna.",5,Entebbe Rescue Mission is told properly & accurately,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,3893,"['MIVTSA', 'YONATAN', 'a/k/a/', 'OPERATION', 'THUNDERBOLT', '1977', 'one', 'favorite', 'albeit', 'mostly', 'forgotten', 'films', 'story', '27', 'June', '1976', 'hijacking', 'Air', 'France', 'flight', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'putting', 'hands', 'PLO', 'way', 'German', 'Palestinian', 'terrorists', 'coterie', 'annoying', 'socialist-revolutionary', 'Germans', 'such', 'saw', '2008', 'film', 'DAS', 'BAADEN', 'MEINHOF', 'KOMPLEX', 'see', 'review', 'can', 'find', 'great', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'Wilfried', 'Boese', 'chilling', 'matter-of-fact', 'shoving', 'Israeli', 'citizens', 'One', 'people', 'German', 'what', 'accomplish', 'wondering', 'Kinski', 'aloud', 'NAZI', 'horrors', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'enough', 'Kinski', 'acting', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'demonstrate', 'shocking', 'reaction', 'question.All', 'more', 'deeply', 'personal', 'film', ""'d"", 'only', 'seen', 'dreadful', '1976', 'offering', 'RAID', 'ON', 'ENTEBBE', 'Entebbe', 'Ugandan', 'town', 'where', 'hijacked', 'plane', 'was', 'hidden', 'same', 'year', 'saw', 'television', 'VICTORY', 'AT', 'ENTEBBE', 'starring', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'just', 'dreary', 'unexciting.But', 'OPERATION', 'THUNDERBOLT', 'really', 'moved', 'get', 'exacting', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'thrilling', 'seeing', 'how', 'people', 'waited', 'years', 'see', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'Munich', 'see', 'Spielberg', 'MUNICH', 'was', 'one', 'weird', 'situation', 'Israeli', 'citizens', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'Uganda', 'exchange', 'release', 'Israeli-held', 'Palestinian', 'prisoners', 'engineered', 'Col.', 'Moammar', 'Qadaffi', 'full', 'cooperation', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Dada', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'write', 'stuff.This', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'where', 'should', ""n't"", 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'certain', 'moments', 'almost', 'episode', 'COPS', 'then', 'when', 'shooting', 'see', 'operatic', 'victims', 'ketchup/blood', 'Oh', 'well', 'was', '70s.Yet', 'nobly', 'great', 'film', 'find', 'more', 'compelling', 'other', '2', 'film', 'versions', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'least', 'was', 'shot', 'Israel', 'government', 'had', 'hand', 'get', 'few', 'jarring', 'you-are-there', 'scenes', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'film', 'before.Yehoram', 'Gaon', 'interesting', 'half-amateur', 'half-pro', 'performance', 'Col.', 'Yonatan', 'Netanyahu', 'leader', 'raid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'others', 'absolutely', 'one', 'recognizable', 'American', 'audiences', 'watched', 'lot', 'Israeli', 'TV', '70s.This', 'film', 'compelling', 'score', 'awesome', 'sound', 'engineering', 'very', 'accurate', 'feel', 'events', 'Entebbe', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Dada', 'here', 'scene-chewing', 'Mark', 'Heath', 'not', 'as', 'chilling', 'screwy', 'Yaphet', 'Kotto', 'inRaid', 'Entebbe', 'horrifying', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'inThe', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'still', 'performance', 'home', 'what', 'man', 'represented', 'world', 'CREEPY', 'Thank', 'God', 'man', 'dead', 'Also', 'rather', 'odd', ""'ve"", 'often', 'seen', 'OPERATION', 'THUNDERBOLT', 'billed', 'only', 'authenticated', 'telling', 'events', 'Entebbe', 'Rescue', 'Mission', 'wonder', 'what', 'supposed', 'mean', 'film', 'versions', 'show', 'just', 'same', 'thing.This', 'always', 'fate', 'dear', 'old', 'Mrs.', 'Dora', 'Bloch', 'lady', 'recall', 'hearing', 'was', 'taken', 'whatever', 'hospital', 'Entebbe', 'know', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'finished', 'rescue', 'originally', 'wrote', 'review', 'researched', 'found', 'Mrs.', 'Bloch', 'had', 'bit', 'heart', 'problem', 'ended', 'up', 'abusing/torturing', 'death', 'hospital', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'how', 'many', 'months', 'took', 'anyone', 'learn', 'fate', 'Thanks', 'recent', 'comment', 'poster', 'tell', 'time', 'even', 'think', 'CRY', 'keep', 'crying', 'wife', 'it.Do', 'not', 'deprive', 'miss', 'chance', 'least', 'watch', 'study', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'work', 'must-see', 'filmmaking', 'level', 'best', 'contrary', 'usual', 'film', 'one', 'place', 'showboaters', 'hotdogs', 'prima', 'donna']",Operation Thunderbolt

743558,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00008K78A,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 3]","OPERATION THUNDERBOLT (Hebrew: MIVTSA YONATAN) is Menachem Golan's and Yoram Globus's film recreation of the daring Israeli rescue of the hijacked passengers of Air France flight 139, bound from Jerusalem to Paris, which took place on July 4, 1976, America's Bicentennial.Hijacked by a combined force of Arab and German terrorists who claimed to be ""freedom fighters,"" the 85 Jewish passengers plus the flight crew were segregated and flown to Entebbe, Uganda's capital, where they were held under threat of death and with the smirking acquiescence of Idi Amin, the mad dictatorial President of that country.The Israelis came up with an ingenious rescue plan which involved flying an anti-terrorist team a thousand miles and more to Entebbe, raiding the terminal, and extracting the passengers. It went off about as perfectly as it could. Three passengers were killed and 5 wounded during the rescue. One, Dora Bloch, who had been separated from the others by dint of being taken to the hospital, simply disappeared, presumably murdered. All the terrorists were slain. Only one Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu, (older brother of the future Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu) was lost.This was a moment of pride for all decent and truly freedom-loving people in the world.There were several Hollywood versions of the event, but this one, made in Israel, had the backing and cooperation of the Israeli government. Yitzhak Rabin, Yigael Allon, and Shimon Peres all appear as themselves. Sybil Danning (""The Queen of The B's"") appears as ""Halima"" (in real life the terrorist Brigitte Kuhlmann. For more on Kuhlmann might I suggestCouncil of Eleven: Shall we Not Revenge?).Anyone familiar with this film will be able to recite long passages of dialogue from Chuck Norris'sThe Delta Force, another film based on a real hijacking, of TWA flight 847.

I've noticed that category was usually a good source of worthwhile fims I might otherwise miss completely.  This movie fits the bill although I'm not sure it fits the category since it's 90% in English.  It tells the compelling tale of the raid on Entebbe and is an Israeli production which has its' advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage is in knowing who the ""good guys"" are, probable access to inside information, and an enthusiasm that Hollywood would have missed.  The disadvantages are some questionable casting, a ""Made-for-TV"" soundtrack, about 15 minutes of film that should have been left on the cutting room floor.I found the quality of this used video tape to be a bit less than what I had hoped for.  I only mention that because I see so many reviews that focus almost exclusively on the quality of the media.  After the opening cast and credits, I stopped noticing the slight blurriness.  The movie spends just a slight amount of time developing the characters at the beginning.  Before we know it, the plane is in the air and the terrorists take control.  Some of the actors are good, some are very good, and some are...well, let's just say that the liner notes tell how 12 of the hostages play themselves.  I counted more than 12 that seemed to ""fit"" that category (if you know what I mean).  Along that line, we are treated to a number of disappointing actual scenes of Israeli leaders ""in action"" during the time the hostage crisis was taking place.  We see them sitting in chairs, walking down hallways and looking at phones.  (Obviously, I couldn't seem to realize anything positive about their inclusion).Technical points aside, the movie moves along at a reasonable clip (when not showing the politicians at ""work"") and the suspense is well-developed.  Those who know nothing of this historical event should enjoy just about every non-Knesset minute of the film.  Those who are aware of the event (and may have seen other movie versions of it) will still find it an engrossing film.  It is, of course, a very timely movie 30 years after it was made given the international state of affairs that we are in.  Not much has changed in that time (especially for Israel) and there is a sense that the Israeli's, out of necessity if for no other reason, are the experts on dealing with terrorism.  We Americans could learn a few things from the Israeli's and this movie (although not their rather inept response to the Hezballah in Lebanon last year) is evidence of that.I'm glad I bought this movie.

Definitely, purchase this film!",5,"Wonderful film, true to life!",1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,1108,"['wonderful', 'film', 'cover', 'entitled', 'iquest', 'iquest', 'iquest', 'iquest', 'iquest', 'iquest', 'iquest', 'iquest', 'iquest', 'Mivtsah', 'Yonathan', 'actually', 'Hebrew', 'Operation', 'Jonathan', 'affectionately', 'named', 'was', 'Operation', 'Thunderbolt', 'Yoni', 'Netanyahu', 'brother', 'later', 'prime', 'minister', 'Israel', 'Benjamin', 'Netanyahu', 'Yoni', 'was', 'only', 'soldier-fatality', 'mission', 'Even', 'pricey', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'penny', 'spent', ""'d"", 'buy', 'again', 'heartbeat', 'echo', 'other', 'comments', 'support', 'buying', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'Raid', 'Entebbe', 'American', 'version', 'same', 'events', 'all-star', 'cast', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'more', 'Very', 'exciting', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'very', 'interesting', 'remember', 'actual', 'events', 'even', 'being', 'ten', 'time', 'was', 'quite', 'aware', 'even', 'age', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'world', 'movie', 'very', 'accurate', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'film', 'mainly', 'Hebrew', 'English', 'also', 'German', 'Arabic', 'French', 'subtitles', 'are', 'supplied', 'Definitely', 'purchase', 'film']",Operation Thunderbolt

I am so glad I decided to purchase this DVD.  Don't expect the Hollywood version.  Expect to be awe struck by the planning and execution of this mission.  BB Netanyahu's brother was a great man.

This criminal action was commited by the ""Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine"" and radical-leftist/communists of ""Red Cell"" from West Germany. Their demands: to free their fellow terrorists currently incarcerated in Israel.The flight, enroute to Jerusalem, was diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, where the terrorists received aid and shelter from the murderous dictator Idi Amin. Of the 260 passengers, all the Israelis were segregated to be systematically murdered if the demands were not met. The non-Israelis were allowed early repatriation.A visually lavish portrayal of the events, Operation Thunderbolt tells the story of one of the most spectacular and ingenious rescue-operations ever attempted by an anti-terrorist unit, the Sayaret Matkal!Although 260 hostages were ultimately saved, sadly, there were casualties. Three passengers were accidentally killed by gun-fire during the raid. An elderly lady, Dora Bloch, was murdered by agents of the Ugandan government as she lay helpless in a nearby hospital. Yonatan Netanyahu, the commander of the raid, was hit by enemy fire, and died on the flight home to Israel.
