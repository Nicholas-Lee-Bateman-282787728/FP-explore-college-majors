1678643,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00GLPYVQC,DVD Verdict,"[14, 18]","A mere seventeen episodes constitutes the entirety of Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series. As slight as that sounds, I found this slim three-disc set to be an overdose of sub-Laverne and Shirley unfunniness, songs that would never threaten and hit lists during any era, supporting characters not even their own mothers could love, and storylines so bereft of originality the second to last episode actually resorted to using Happy Days flashbacks!Do I sound unnecessarily harsh? If so, it's because I'm pissed off at how little apparent interest creator Garry Marshall and company had in delivering a series worth watching. First, there's the concept: Joanie and Chachi decide to chase their dreams and sing with a band, playing nightly at Delvecchio's restaurant. Think about that for a moment&#8230;When you go out for a nice Italian dinner, do you really want a rock group thrashing away at songs you've never heard before, and being sung by a man with a tin throat? Scott Baio is many things&#8212;incredibly charming, handsome, and when given the chance, a fine actor&#8212;but musical is not one of them!And then, there's the rest of &#34;the band,&#34; who never actually rate a name. On bass guitar is Chachi's cousin Annette (Winifred Freedman); a cute, sweet and (slightly) chubby girl who gets routinely pelted with fat and ugly jokes. Nice, right? Annette's brother Mario (Derrel Maury) plays keyboards; a fairly good looking&#8212;if somewhat anonymous&#8212;kid, distinguished only by his pork pie hat. Finally, there's drummer Bingo (Robert Pierce), who wears Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts, has a bushy blond perm, and speaks entirely in non-sequiturs, sounding just like Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. That's right, he's a &#34;surfer dude&#34;&#8230;in Chicago.You want comedy? Here's a sample of what passes for witty repartee.Al: &#34;Bingo, listen, the band is late again. Now, we can't wait forever. Isn't there something you can do?&#34;Bingo: &#34;If you could get me a bowl of cereal, I can pick out the riboflavin.&#34;Here's more.(Chachi is clearing tables at the restaurant when he sees Joanie's ex-boyfriend enter, and take a seat. Hoping to avoid a confrontation, Chachi darts behind the bar, where Mario is standing, and crouches down next to him.)Mario: &#34;You know, Chachi, when you crouch down like that, you're the exact height as my grandmother.&#34;Unfortunately, Paramount's DVD presentation of Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series suits the middling-to-awful material all too well. The 1.33:1 standard def full frame image looks pretty good, but many of the episodes suffer from flicker at the top of the frame, and the pilot appears to have taken a bit of a beating (watchable, but roughed-up). The Dolby 2.0 Mono audio is more successful, clearly amplifying Mr. Baio's vocal performances, so beware. (Note: According to Mr. Todd Fuller, founder of the excellent Sitcoms Online website, several episodes have had musical numbers edited out!) Subtitles have been provided, but nothing else, which is curious, as all the major cast members, Marshall, and many of the show's runners are still among the living. Again, that seeming total lack of interest on their part.Lest I leave you with the impression that Joanie Loves Chachi was among the very worst endeavors in TV series history, I feel obligated to mention there were some obviously talented performers involved (who couldn't love Molinaro and Travolta?). But somehow their efforts were squandered or taken for granted, if not altogether ignored. I'm speaking specifically of Erin Moran. By the time this series bowed, the then twenty one year old actress was a fifteen year showbiz veteran, who'd grown from a freckled tomboy into a stunningly beautiful woman with an incredible singing voice. In this critic's humble opinion, no bigger mistake was made by the spin-off's producers than their decision to make Moran a junior partner in the musical element of the series. Check out her amazing slow-burn rendition of early '60s classic &#34;He's So Fine&#34; at the end of the episode &#34;Term Paper.&#34; It'll blow your mind.Judge P.S.

I always liked shows that had singing and comedy skits in them or in other words, variety shows such as The Carol Burnett Show.

1678646,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B00GLPYVQC,Joanna Mechlinski,"[2, 3]","No doubt trying to further the success brought on by such hit shows as Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley, the creators aimed for yet another spin-off. Unfortunately this one was a bit of a flop...largely because the show essentially lacks a true plot.In the pilot, viewers learn that Chachi Arcola (Scott Baio) has just moved to Chicago with his mother Louisa (Ellen Travolta) and her new husband Al Delvecchio (Al Molinaro) to open an Italian restaurant. The teenage Chachi is devastated, largely because his girlfriend Joanie Cunningham (Erin Moran) is still in Milwaukee.Then Chachi finds he's got the opportunity to sing in a band, under the direction of his &#34;manager&#34; (aka his Uncle Rico). Chachi is quick to recommend Joanie as the female vocal, and with his cousins Annette and Mario, and a spaced-out surfer named Bingo, a band is born.Most times, the group performs at Delvecchio's, although Chachi - whose dream is to become professional - seeks out other gigs.The main problem here is that this is essentially the entire plot of the show. The actors are good; presumably, many viewers of this show tuned in specifically for them, already being familiar with them from Happy Days. But there is little for most of them to do, save stand around supporting Chachi's musical dreams. Despite Louisa and Al just having opened a new business, we see and hear very little of it, except - of course - when it involves the band. And Chachi and Joanie themselves seem to have little personality outside the music.Oh, did anyone mention that Joanie loves Chachi? There's that, too. Viewers are treated to a small squabble between the two each episode, but it's quickly resolved and of no real consequence to the couple.It's no wonder the entire series only lasted 17 episodes.",2,"Good actors, crappy show",1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,1781,"['doubt', 'trying', 'further', 'success', 'brought', 'such', 'hit', 'shows', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'creators', 'aimed', 'yet', 'spin-off', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'was', 'bit', 'flop', 'largely', 'show', 'essentially', 'true', 'plot.In', 'pilot', 'viewers', 'learn', 'Chachi', 'Arcola', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'just', 'moved', 'Chicago', 'mother', 'Louisa', 'Ellen', 'Travolta', 'new', 'husband', 'Al', 'Delvecchio', 'Al', 'Molinaro', 'open', 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'teenage', 'Chachi', 'devastated', 'largely', 'girlfriend', 'Joanie', 'Cunningham', 'Erin', 'Moran', 'still', 'Milwaukee.Then', 'Chachi', 'got', 'opportunity', 'sing', 'band', 'direction', '34', 'manager', '34', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Chachi', 'quick', 'recommend', 'Joanie', 'female', 'vocal', 'cousins', 'Annette', 'Mario', 'spaced-out', 'surfer', 'named', 'Bingo', 'band', 'born.Most', 'times', 'group', 'Delvecchio', 'Chachi', 'dream', 'become', 'professional', 'seeks', 'other', 'gigs.The', 'main', 'problem', 'here', 'essentially', 'entire', 'plot', 'show', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'presumably', 'many', 'viewers', 'show', 'tuned', 'specifically', 'already', 'being', 'familiar', 'Happy', 'Days', 'little', 'most', 'do', 'save', 'stand', 'supporting', 'Chachi', 'musical', 'dreams', 'Louisa', 'Al', 'just', 'having', 'opened', 'new', 'business', 'see', 'hear', 'very', 'little', 'course', 'when', 'band', 'Chachi', 'Joanie', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'personality', 'music.Oh', 'did', 'anyone', 'mention', 'Joanie', 'Chachi', 'too', 'Viewers', 'are', 'treated', 'small', 'squabble', 'two', 'episode', 'quickly', 'resolved', 'real', 'consequence', 'couple.It', 'wonder', 'entire', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', '17', 'episodes']",Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series

How exciting, almost a decade after seeing excerpts, then, to finally have the chance to see the complete (but unfortunately, short) run of &#34;Joanie Loves Chachi&#34;!I was not disappointed&#8212;in fact, I was pleasantly surprised&#8212;in the quality of this series. It's lighthearted (and admittedly has some quite cheesy moments). But what really stands out to me about each episode is the natural and believable chemistry of the whole cast. It doesn't hurt that the primary setting (the family restaurant/house) also looks very real. Add to this equation the presence of at least one musical performance in almost every show, and you've got quite a fun 25 minutes of comedy each time.The romantic relationship between Joanie and Chachi (as well as their work together in a band that performs in the family restaurant) is the primary focus. Scott Baio and Erin Moran deliver their lines and actions in an authentic way which distracts from any reality gaps in the scripts. They are also capable vocalists who make the musical performances more than a mere novelty aspect of the show. Also, of note, however, are the scenes between Chachi's parents (played by Helen Travolta and Al Molinaro). Joanie and Chachi's bandmates also add to the fun.The only thing that's missing from this DVD release to make it an over-the-top success are any bonus features. Since (amazingly) all of the main cast members are still alive as of this writing, it would've been wonderful to see some new interviews with them about the show&#8212;or even hear their commentary on a few episodes. But I suppose that CBS DVD (probably accurately) assumed that the audience for this release would not be large enough to warrant the cost of including such features.Most importantly, &#34;Joanie Loves Chachi&#34; stands as a notably delightful early 1980s sitcom with both charming reminders of the era in which it was produced and timeless portrayals of a close-knit and caring family and couple. The 17 episodes of the series' run definitely left me wanting more. The cast and directors truly did a fine job of pulling this viewer in. I don't hesitate to recommend this DVD release to anyone who is fond of heartwarming, comedic shows with that dreamy touch of the early '80s.",4,Feel-good comedy&#8212;with an entertaining touch of music!,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,2556,"['first', 'learned', '1982', 'sitcom', 'VH1', '34', 'Love', ""'80s"", '34', 'program', 'aired', 'early', '2000s', 'Mind', '34', 'Happy', 'Days', '34', 'show', 'series', 'was', 'spun', 'off', 'was', 'time', 'So', 'main', 'familiarity', 'was', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'later', '34', 'Charles', 'Charge', '34', 'days', 'How', 'exciting', 'almost', 'decade', 'seeing', 'excerpts', 'then', 'finally', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'complete', 'unfortunately', 'short', 'run', '34', 'Joanie', 'Loves', 'Chachi', '34', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', '8212', 'fact', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', '8212', 'quality', 'series', 'lighthearted', 'admittedly', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'what', 'really', 'out', 'episode', 'natural', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'whole', 'cast', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'primary', 'setting', 'family', 'restaurant/house', 'also', 'very', 'real', 'Add', 'equation', 'presence', 'least', 'one', 'musical', 'performance', 'almost', 'show', ""'ve"", 'got', 'quite', 'fun', '25', 'minutes', 'comedy', 'time.The', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Joanie', 'Chachi', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'together', 'band', 'family', 'restaurant', 'primary', 'focus', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'Erin', 'Moran', 'deliver', 'lines', 'actions', 'authentic', 'way', 'reality', 'gaps', 'scripts', 'are', 'also', 'capable', 'vocalists', 'who', 'make', 'musical', 'performances', 'more', 'mere', 'novelty', 'aspect', 'show', 'Also', 'note', 'however', 'are', 'scenes', 'Chachi', 'parents', 'played', 'Helen', 'Travolta', 'Al', 'Molinaro', 'Joanie', 'Chachi', 'bandmates', 'also', 'add', 'fun.The', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'DVD', 'release', 'make', 'over-the-top', 'success', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'amazingly', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'writing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wonderful', 'see', 'new', 'interviews', 'show', '8212', 'even', 'hear', 'commentary', 'few', 'episodes', 'suppose', 'CBS', 'DVD', 'probably', 'accurately', 'assumed', 'audience', 'release', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'large', 'enough', 'warrant', 'cost', 'including', 'such', 'features.Most', 'importantly', '34', 'Joanie', 'Loves', 'Chachi', '34', 'stands', 'notably', 'delightful', 'early', '1980s', 'sitcom', 'charming', 'reminders', 'era', 'was', 'produced', 'timeless', 'portrayals', 'close-knit', 'caring', 'family', 'couple', '17', 'episodes', 'series', 'run', 'definitely', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'cast', 'directors', 'truly', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'pulling', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'release', 'anyone', 'who', 'fond', 'heartwarming', 'comedic', 'shows', 'dreamy', 'touch', 'early', ""'80s""]",Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series
1678654,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00GLPYVQC,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[1, 13]","This series has the distinction of being the Happy Days spin-off which did NOT succeed in the ratings.Since Scott Baio and Erin Moran are trying to (unfortunately) sing in the opening credits and throughout episodes themselves, I really can't tell you why this series got the complete go-ahead for release. Meanwhile we're waiting for the entire series of Happy Days to come out on DVD. Unless their ""singing"" is 'the reason' why: the studio did not have to worry about getting around licensing issues of any kind with anybody remotely important.I really did not know the word to describe it as a little kid, but now I'd say that they don't sound 'romantic' or 'endearing'. Their numbers sound suicidal. This isn't an atmosphere you'd what you want when you're trying to eat a nice plate of homemade Italian food. The whole plot of moving from Wisconsin was to sing in 'a restaurant' where they're going to and build a career in show business. .But casting/scripting apparently did not think things through (other than they were attached with Happy Days and were the 'teenagers' of the show). Like finding out if they could themselves sing in the first place.Remember, the Partridge Family had 'studio musicians' for their episodes.  And you can't sell food or music if you can't convince your customers that 'you' can successfully even sing. Yikes! So after a half season and one with less than promising ratings, they came 'home' with no further dreams of stardom.It's embarrassing that this series made it to DVD before the show whose artifacts are on permanent display in the Smithsonian!!",1,Ah Me,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,1593,"['series', 'distinction', 'being', 'Happy', 'Days', 'spin-off', 'did', 'NOT', 'succeed', 'ratings.Since', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'Erin', 'Moran', 'are', 'trying', 'unfortunately', 'sing', 'opening', 'credits', 'episodes', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'series', 'got', 'complete', 'go-ahead', 'release', 'Meanwhile', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'entire', 'series', 'Happy', 'Days', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'Unless', 'singing', ""'the"", 'reason', 'why', 'studio', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'getting', 'licensing', 'issues', 'kind', 'anybody', 'remotely', 'important.I', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'word', 'describe', 'little', 'kid', 'now', ""'d"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', ""'romantic"", ""'endearing"", 'numbers', 'sound', 'suicidal', ""n't"", 'atmosphere', ""'d"", 'what', 'want', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'eat', 'nice', 'plate', 'homemade', 'Italian', 'food', 'whole', 'plot', 'moving', 'Wisconsin', 'was', 'sing', 'restaurant', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'build', 'career', 'show', 'business', '.But', 'casting/scripting', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'things', 'other', 'were', 'attached', 'Happy', 'Days', 'were', ""'teenagers"", 'show', 'finding', 'out', 'could', 'sing', 'first', 'place.Remember', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'had', ""'studio"", 'musicians', 'episodes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sell', 'food', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'convince', 'customers', ""'you"", 'can', 'successfully', 'even', 'sing', 'Yikes', 'So', 'half', 'season', 'one', 'less', 'promising', 'ratings', 'came', ""'home"", 'further', 'dreams', 'stardom.It', 'embarrassing', 'series', 'made', 'DVD', 'show', 'artifacts', 'are', 'permanent', 'display', 'Smithsonian']",Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series

I do know that of which I write. :-)Writing this several weeks before this set is even released prevents commenting on technical aspects of the DVDs, but it can be said that the fact that the first &#34;season&#34; was only four episodes and the second one only 13 episodes speaks to both the quality and popularity of this &#34;Happy Days&#34; spinoff that followed &#34;Laverne and Shirley&#34; and &#34;Mork and Mindy.&#34;This is despite this series starring then uber-teen idol Scott Baio playing the role that granted him that status and that he later revived on &#34;Happy Days.&#34; Further, these 17 episodes should be put in the context of Baio's later horrible series &#34;Charles in Charge,&#34; which ran for a few full seasons.Additionally, stating on the cover of the DVD set that it contains all 17 episodes would be more forthcoming than stating that it includes two seasons.Even the &#34;Three's Company&#34; spinoffs &#34;The Ropers&#34; and &#34;Three's a Crowd&#34; lasted 28 and 22 episodes respectively.This set frankly is not worth the roughly $28 that it is going for considering that it is often easy to find sets of complete 22-24 episode series of sitcoms new and old between $10-15.

1678658,AWZ10PC2278KF,B00GLPYVQC,the exchanger,"[2, 2]","Reading the other reviews,  a few things stand out...1  The actors had a wonderful chemistry that made the episodes work.2  But the writing and series concept left a lot to be desired.3  Joanie can sing!  Chachi did ok in keeping up with her, but really it should have been Joanie singing and Chachi doing something else.  Maybe he could have gotten a job as an 'in charge' male nanny...  (I think he did a few years later...)The producers got stuck with the concept of them singing because the Happy Days episodes with them singing were quite well received and ABC wanted yet another hit spinoff from the series.  They forgot that those Happy days episodes usually had other things like well written scripts and the Fonz to keep things moving along nicely.The main appeal was in the two lead actors eye appeal, Joanie for the boys and Chachi for the gals.  Actual characters for band members that could stand out like the Fonz did early on in the parent series might have helped.  But the band was a waste as was Chachi's family, who were apparently only there so the series could allow underage Joanie to live in another city with her boyfriend.The first 4 episodes were a big hit in the ratings in the spring.  Following the Happy Days series on Tuesday evenings surely helped.  So a full fall season pickup seemed like a great Idea.  But then they moved the show to another day...Thursday.Magnum PI.Starring Tom Selleck, a hot red car, babes, mysteries, a British butler, and Hawaii!You may have heard of that show.  It was number one and/or in the top ten every year from a few years before J.L.C. premiered to many more years afterward.  Our two singing sweethearts never stood a chance against Magnum, and were dumped after 13 weeks in season 2..Luckily, both the 2 lead actors and their characters were still beloved enough by the fans to return to Happy Days and wrap up their storyline in the final season and finale of that series.",5,a series that sticks with you (whether or not you want it to ;),1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,1942,"['Reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'few', 'things', 'stand', 'out', '1', 'actors', 'had', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'made', 'episodes', 'work.2', 'writing', 'series', 'concept', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired.3', 'Joanie', 'can', 'sing', 'Chachi', 'did', 'ok', 'keeping', 'up', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Joanie', 'singing', 'Chachi', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'Maybe', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'job', ""'in"", 'charge', 'male', 'nanny', 'think', 'did', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'producers', 'got', 'stuck', 'concept', 'singing', 'Happy', 'Days', 'episodes', 'singing', 'were', 'quite', 'well', 'received', 'ABC', 'wanted', 'yet', 'hit', 'spinoff', 'series', 'forgot', 'Happy', 'days', 'usually', 'had', 'other', 'things', 'well', 'written', 'scripts', 'Fonz', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'along', 'nicely.The', 'main', 'appeal', 'was', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'eye', 'appeal', 'Joanie', 'boys', 'Chachi', 'gals', 'Actual', 'characters', 'band', 'members', 'could', 'stand', 'out', 'Fonz', 'did', 'early', 'parent', 'series', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'band', 'was', 'waste', 'was', 'Chachi', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'apparently', 'only', 'there', 'so', 'series', 'could', 'allow', 'underage', 'Joanie', 'live', 'city', 'boyfriend.The', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'were', 'big', 'hit', 'ratings', 'spring', 'Following', 'Happy', 'Days', 'series', 'Tuesday', 'evenings', 'surely', 'helped', 'So', 'full', 'fall', 'season', 'pickup', 'seemed', 'great', 'Idea', 'then', 'moved', 'show', 'day', 'Thursday.Magnum', 'PI.Starring', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'hot', 'red', 'car', 'babes', 'mysteries', 'British', 'butler', 'Hawaii', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'show', 'was', 'number', 'one', 'and/or', 'top', 'ten', 'year', 'few', 'years', 'J.L.C', 'premiered', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'afterward', 'two', 'singing', 'sweethearts', 'never', 'stood', 'chance', 'Magnum', 'were', 'dumped', '13', 'weeks', 'season', '2..Luckily', '2', 'lead', 'actors', 'characters', 'were', 'still', 'beloved', 'enough', 'fans', 'return', 'Happy', 'Days', 'wrap', 'up', 'storyline', 'final', 'season', 'finale', 'series']",Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series
