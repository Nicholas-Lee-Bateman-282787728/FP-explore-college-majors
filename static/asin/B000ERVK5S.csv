978353,A24PTVSZSM8968,B000ERVK5S,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I have to say that I really liked this show! I had watched all of the episodes of Friends earlier on DVD so I thought maybe I would like this show, and it turns out I did. I will say this. If you really liked Friends and expect Joey to be more of the same, you will be disappointed because it's quite different and none of the old ""friends"" are part of the show. That being said, this is a pretty funny and engaging show in its own right. The Joey character is pretty much the same one we all knew from Friends and Matt LeBlanc does a good job with it. The other characters are quite a bit different than the rest of the Friends cast but they are very good for this show. They all seem to work well together and fit the intended roles really well. It takes a few episodes for the characters to come into their own and for the plot line to settle down into something comfortable, but by the end, the show works like a well-oiled machine.I would say there are only a couple little things that bugged me a small bit. First of all, if it weren't for the opening credits, you wouldn't know the show takes place in LA. The settings are highly restricted to Joey's apartment, the set of his job and his agent's office. Second, while I love the character of Joey's nephew who is a super-smart geek, it stretches credibility to imagine he could have turned out that way given who his mom and dad were and how he grew up. Finally, some people may not like the constant references to sexual situations. Other than these minor drawbacks, this is a really funny and interesting show that's well worth the price of a set of discs.",5,Surprisingly good,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,1616,"['have', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'show', 'had', 'watched', 'episodes', 'Friends', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'thought', 'maybe', 'would', 'like', 'show', 'out', 'did', 'will', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'Friends', 'expect', 'Joey', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'quite', 'different', 'none', 'old', 'friends', 'are', 'part', 'show', 'being', 'said', 'pretty', 'funny', 'engaging', 'show', 'own', 'right', 'Joey', 'character', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'one', 'knew', 'Friends', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'good', 'job', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'rest', 'Friends', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'seem', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'fit', 'intended', 'roles', 'really', 'well', 'few', 'episodes', 'characters', 'come', 'own', 'plot', 'line', 'settle', 'down', 'something', 'comfortable', 'end', 'show', 'well-oiled', 'machine.I', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'little', 'things', 'bugged', 'small', 'bit', 'First', 'all', 'were', ""n't"", 'opening', 'credits', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'place', 'LA', 'settings', 'are', 'highly', 'restricted', 'Joey', 'apartment', 'set', 'job', 'agent', 'office', 'Second', 'love', 'character', 'Joey', 'nephew', 'who', 'super-smart', 'geek', 'credibility', 'imagine', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'given', 'who', 'mom', 'dad', 'were', 'how', 'grew', 'up', 'Finally', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'constant', 'references', 'sexual', 'situations', 'Other', 'minor', 'drawbacks', 'really', 'funny', 'interesting', 'show', 'well', 'price', 'set', 'discs']",Joey - The Complete First Season

Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[2, 10]","I couldn't wait for this show to start on TV and was ready for lightning to strike me from the very first show.  That didn't happen, but I'm loyal to this ""dreamboat"" actor who's such a lovable guy.While waiting patiently for the show to ""catch"" me, I was preparing myself to lambast anyone who dared criticize it ... but that didn't happen, so I saved myself from punching someone's lights out.  LOL.Anyway, it soon picked up and I grew to like that adorable girl next door (even if she isn't Rachel), his sister and his nephew.  His sister is a sex-bomb, very pretty in a sexy, down-to-earth way.  But for me, I think his agent is a blast.  What a character!  She's different, attractive, well-dressed, and very funny!  She helps bring the chemistry of the show all together.I couldn't wait to get this DVD so I could watch the shows in one sitting and see if it clicked into place sooner for me.  It did!At any rate, I looooooooooove this show, and I just adore Joey.  He's way beyond cool.  And, like many of the other reviewers, I'd like to see some of the FRIENDS cast make guest appearances from time to time. I'd also like to hear him chat on the phone with them occasionally.  That would make it appear more real.  As close as the cast of FRIENDS became, I'm certain the other five would be more than willing to support their beloved old friend who added so much to FRIENDS.I hope JOEY goes on forever ... until Joey's old and gray.

978357,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000ERVK5S,Caleb Williams,"[1, 1]","Joey Tribbiani has left his friends behind to move to Hollywood in pursuit of his acting career. He moves into an apartment with his nephew Michael and his sister Gina is never too far away. The series takes us through Joey trying to enhance his career, to enhance his nephews love life and to simply be able to handle his sisters sexual adventures.This being the character of Joey and introducing other members of the Tribbiani family, I have to be honest and say I knew this wouldn't fail. The script is just as quick and slapstick as the original series, and we are subject to the typical charm that we came to love Joey for in the Friends series.Drea Matteo is something special in this series and she is the general female depiction of Joey. She's slow, she's clumsy, she likes sex but she has a good heart. This is a really endearing character and is someone that I believe that if Joey was given a third or a fourth season the character of Gina would have been worthy of a spin off herself.This is something special and in some episodes I would honestly say it surpasses Friends.

978359,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B000ERVK5S,David Seaman,"[0, 0]","As a lover of the show ""Friends"" and through that always aware that of all those characters, Joey Tribianni was the one who grew the most, I bought this DVD simply because I've run out of things to watch. I was aware of ""Joey"" at the time, but my life was such that I was too busy to watch and the fact is that when one is forced to sit through the credits at the opening (awful, ugly music- far too long- and a waaste of time- the show's only flaw) and then commercials, well I doubt I'd have hung in there every week. As with all new shows, it takes them a bit to get their ""sea legs"" (remember that awful musical montage of actors looking out rainy windows in the pilot for ""Friends?"") Matt LeBlanc is just as wonderful as always- with a strong ability to do things with expression and the ability to deliver a line with clear character understanding. He's terrific. I want to see him do more and wish that more producers and casting offices agreed with me. He';d be excellent in a dramatic role as well.The supporting cast is outstanding. His sister and nephew are polarized opposites and Joey settles nicely in between them. Gina, his older sister, was pregnant with Michael at age 16 and she is a tiny bit brighter than Joey. Despite her very trashy New York broad act (and her $500 boobs) she too is someone who has been taught to care and love. Her son Michael- who is a LOT more attractive than the scripts allow) has a genuis IQ ewhich we fail to understand until we meet Jimmy in season two. Jimmy we've met before- also on ""Friends""- for the three or four episodes that CHandler needed to get a new roomate and is saddled with a raving madman who dehydrates fruit and may snap at any moment. Michael spends the first season, developing into his own person while trying to become worldly at the hand of Uncle Joey. His neighbor, Alex is a well played goody-goody who is married to a jerk and we once again see Joey's warm side as her marriage dissolves.We also see her good side when, for Christmas, she gives Joey a white christmas in one of the series most spectacular moments. Joey's agent, Bobbee did a one time appearance on ""Friends"" as the high school friend who moved to London and has come back to irritate them all. She explodes with life in this series, saying and doing things that are spectacular. Bobbee is a strong actress and I'd love to see her have her own series, but I don't often get what I like. The second season of ""Joey"" is just as funny- perhaps more so- as NBC clearly tried to do things to pull the ratings up. There is the addition of a few characters (Zach is a delight; we talked about Jimmy) and we see much more of Bobbee. They threw a lot of money in to bring is famous guest stars,(including some legeneds, Betty White dominates an entire episode) most of whom were well used, but Matt LeBlanc was still the star of the show. What the show did NOT have was David Crane and Marta Kaufman so if you are looking to add an eleventh and twelfth season to friends, that's not here and that is why I suspect that the show failed to flourish the first time out. What happened with ""Cheers"" and ""Frasier"" is a rare thing. (Remember ""Trapper John, MD?"")Ther reson is what I call the inevitable comparrison factor.Now it's here on DVD (though I had a rough time finding the second season and had to pay $70 for it-well worth it) and you can fast forward through the too long credits at the top and watch it without commercials as the editors saw it before it hit the air. ""Joey"" is as strong as some of it's contemporaries: ""Will & Grace"", ""Aressted Development"", ""News Radio"" and yes, even ""Friends"". We see Simon Hedberg here in a somewhat pre-showing of his character to be on ""Big Bang Theory"" and we also have ""Studio 60"" to show us that Simon Hedberg is sincerely a gifted actor who happens to play a genuiks-nerd better than most and most of the episodes are directed by the brilliant David Bright- one third of the genuis behind ""Friends""- the man who always directed the Thanksgiving shows.""Joey"" is well worth it, folks. So very worth it. The contracts would interest me- none of Joey's furniture was allowed to follow (that ridiculous white dog that ended up on Monica and CHandler's balcony or his matching brown recliners. WE know that the Movers & SHalkers moving company brought his stuff but the only thing I could recognize was, thankfully, Hugsie- who did not follow Emma across the street with Ross and Rachel. We do see Joey's commercial for ""Ichiban"" Lipstick for men) but the only other pre-Joey video we see of Joey is a sex tape that pops up once he is famous. Still and all, the whole thing works beautifully.

The acting was forced and seemedexxaggerated to the point of just wishing someone would shoot the characters and put them out of their misery, including JoeyTribbiani.

Joey is still Joey no matter which other roles they cast around him and no matter how they write him.  However, his sister was just not a likable character and the neighbor was a weak character.

Tell the truth, I finished the complete Friends series and when I started ""Joey"" I just thought it was ok, having watched only an episode or two.  A year or two later I started watching it again and was surprised how quickly I got into it.  Having forgotten about the rest of the friends in ""Friends"" I was able to take this show on its own and for what it was.  And was surprised how quick and laugh-fueled it is on its own.  The girl from the Soprannos the science kid, and the ""hot girl"" landlord neighbor start really becoming a part of the series and I really started having fun with this show.  It may not have the same characters of Friends, but it's got a similar energy.

978363,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000ERVK5S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[8, 10]","I'm gonna miss Joey. It was a good try, but, ultimately, it wasn't given enough time on air to come out from under the shadow of Friends and become its own entity. Shame on the NBC network. Shows like Joey need time to ferment and to grow on the viewers. I thought that by halfway thru Season One and for most of Season Two the cast and the  storylines were on point. Joey was never gonna be another phenom hit like Friends, but it was on its way to becoming a solid comedy sitcom. And the uncatchy theme song, by the way, did not help.Joey: The Complete First Season tells of Joey Tribbiani's adventures in L.A. as he tries to get serious with his acting career. As he attempts to transition from a New York lifestyle to a more laidback City of Angels existence, he meets up with his transplanted family and new support group: sister Gina, nephew Michael, and also cute neighbor/lawyer/apartment complex super Alex.You could tell the cast was new to each other, as the first episodes were unveiled; the actors weren't seemingly on the same page, the chemistry not there initially. The first episodes were awkward and stilted, with mostly LeBlanc holding down the fort. The show didn't begin to truly take on personality until the episode ""Joey and the Big Audition,"" which set the stage for Joey signing on for the nighttime TV drama Deep Powder. The show took off from there. Other neat episodes were ""Joey and the Taste Test"" (Alex and Gina in The Lasagna War! and Lauren's ""When you knock, I have to knock.""), ""Joey and the Premiere"" (where Alex is unknowingly set up with a lesbian and Michael has to choose between a girl and Star Trek's Data), ""Joey and the Assistant"" (if nothing else, for the hilarious personal assistant robot-dance-off at the end), ""Joey and the Valentine's Date"" (where the age of Joey's date steadily climbs as the episode progresses), ""Joey and the Fancy Sister"" (where Christina Ricci plays Joey's spoiled kid sister and assumes Alex is the maid), and the season finale episode ""Joey and the Moving In.""Even episodes which I didn't think were of high quality still contained little moments of Joey fun in 'em. I remember Joey tying a memory string on his wrist but still forgetting to return a rental car, from which he ultimately accrued $1200 in parking tickets; Joey finally, successfully performs a Shakespearean monologue on stage, only to discover that the play was a cowboy musical; Joey getting Christmas elves confused with gypsies...After more than a decade, Matt LeBlanc knows his character Joey (or ""J-Bird"" as he dubs himself in one episode) in and out. Joey Tribbiani comes into his own series with the same endearingly comedic qualities which made him so beloved by the fans: his dazed and befuddled double-takes, his half-wit but oh-so-hilarious exploits and comments, and his born-to-lose-as-an-actor aura. His heart, loyalty, and sense of doing the right thing are still very much present, although, as ever, there's an APB out on his brain.Paulo Costanzo, I thought, was pretty funny as the skinny, cerebral, nerdy Michael. The delivery of his one-liners was timely, while his painfully uncomfortable encounters with the opposite sex made for some good comedy. Meanwhile, Drea De Matteo is pretty hot stuff, but talk about overkilling the stereotype! Her Gina was the quintessential New York Italian girl - brash, cocky, and just a tad sleazy. Still, Gina had several moments in which she made me root for her. Andrea Anders as the pretty, ditzy, repressed, but lovable Alex was a plus, and one wonders how her relationship with Joey would have evolved. I was kinda rooting for those two as a couple. Jennifer Coolidge, who was so good in the Friends' episode ""The One with Ross's Tan,"" and who, in this series, played Joey's quirky, over-the-top agent Bobbi, was a bit too much to take in as a semi-regular cast member. But a welcome recurring character was Joey's strange, lonely, boot-licking neighbor Howard (Ben Falcone), who badly wants to be Joey's pal.Guest stars of varying effectiveness were: OCD-laden series producer Lauren Beck (nicely played by Lucy Lui), Kelly Preston, Bob Saget, Brent Spiner (as himself), Jay Leno, Christina Ricci, Madchen Amick, and Carmen Electra (as herself).What really sucks about this dvd set was that there aren't any special features. Not one. No episode commentary, no featurettes, nothing. How incredibly sad is that? Warner Brothers, what are you doing? Ironically enough, the only extra feature is on the 4th disc and is a promo for the Friends dvd collection.So, for various reasons, three and a half stars for Joey. Here's hoping the show has a long, healthy dvd life. Now, I'm waiting for some kind of Friends reunion TV special (maybe guest-starring the cast of Joey?). Couldn't hurt to dream, could it?",4,"Even though NBC gave up on Joey, he's very much worth a try",1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,4805,"[""'m"", 'gon', 'miss', 'Joey', 'was', 'good', 'try',

978365,A2ORZYOH2IRT9W,B000ERVK5S,Jason Dodge,"[4, 8]","I had a lot of negitive issues with ""Joey"" when it first premired -- the character of Joey himself wasn't rounded enough to sustain a series, actor Matt Leblanc just didn't want his fame from ""Friends"" to end, amoung some others. But as the series continued, especially after the first 5 or 6 episodes, the writting suddenly started hitting its stride and the show started to have a very similar energy that ""Friends"" once had. The jokes were becoming better, the characters started to ""gel"" together much more than before, and you really could tell the writers were finding what these new characters were going to be about.Sure, ""Joey"" has been moved from the coveted Thuersday night time-slot, but then ""Frasier"" never kept the same time slot either and ran for 10 seasons regaurdless. Obviously some fans of ""Friends"" have converted over to ""Joey"" (like me) but the show is still solid enough to have earned its own fans. Give the show a good chance, and you might just end up catching every new episode that comes out. I don't know why the creators see the need to not even mention ANY of the prevuious ""Friends"" characters by name, and don't even think about a guest appearance. This is just the first season, though, and I really think the series could easily last five  seasons if it keeps up the quality writting.

Recently they brought it back for a week for an hour. It did bad against American Idol and According to Jim so they canned it I hear. They need to be more patient than that and give the show more of a chance to find an audience, I mean it was only the second season. Plus they are so dumb that they replaced Joey with Funniest TV moments, oh yeah I'm sure that scored a big rating.Friends was huge and if they ever ever wanted an audience for Joey they obviously needed some appearences by former Friends cast members. Who wouldn't want to see Chandler and Joey together just one more time ? Don't get me wrong, Joey is great without that but it's simply obvious that it would've helped boost ratings if they did that. This show is a gem and one of the funniest new shows and it will be a shame if it's really gone for good.It's cast may not be as good as Friends but it manages and they have chemestry. Paulo Costanzo (Road Trip) is always funny as Joeys nerdy nephew who has no clue about girls. While Drea de Matteo is great as Joey's bossy sister who they're afraid to talk back to. Andrea Anders is also good as Joey's loveable and confused nextdoor neighbor Alex.

The two (his sister and nephew) are not that likable.  His neighbor and his agent seem out of place.  As for the minor roles cast, they are very weak indeed.Simply put, the show (in the beginning) is not so funny (the humor is indeed poor), and what is worse is that Joey, the character, is too weak; he is down on his luck, he is not confident, and he does not even seem to be dating (!), among other things (you get the picture...).Too make matters worse, during this time of difficulty (both for the show being new and for the character being bummed out), there is no mention of anyone from Friends!  How come he doesn't mention their names?  How come he doesn't talk on the phone with them???  (Especially with Chandler for crying out loud!)And then, around the eighth episode or so, there is the major turnaround!  AMAZING TRANSFORMATION!!!  Something kicks into gear and everything falls into place.  The humor, the dialogues, the acting, the stories, the chemistry, it's all there!  It's as if the addiction we had with Friends had never left!  You want more and more and more!There are a few guest appearances, Christina Ricci and Lucy Liu most notably, but some of the old characters should definitely make guest appearances.  It would be incomprehensibly bordering on ludicrous if they all do not eventually appear.In conclusion, Joey is ""an acquired taste"" and it needs some getting used to; the new theme song, the new setting, and the new characters.

Everyone else seemed more interested in movies or motherhood. Many people have said Joey was a huge let down - it was actually released on DVD in the UK months before it was released in the US. But after borrowing it, I found although sorely missing the other five (was I the only one who kept expecting Chandler to walk through the door?) was funny.I am disappointed in the other five though. Obviously a ruse to get the TV series Joey moving, they all said they would appear at some point. They don't. For any Friends fans expecting to see Chandler, Monica, Rachel, Ross & Phoebe again, you will barely get a mention. They're mentioned all in the first episode (but not by name), and then Rachel is mentioned in the last episode (again, not by name). The only character from Friends that regularly appears is Ross, but rather as David Schwimmer as he directed a couple of the episodes.The one thing that was disappointing about Joey is that I felt Matt LeBlanc was simply trying to hard to keep the character of Joey fresh & new. He was never the greatest character in Friends (he was the only one in the final series not to have a major storyline), and why they decided a spin-off on him was such a great idea, isn't really clear. They should have ended Friends on the final episode. And let the die hard fans just keep rewatching it. Nothing could match the success of Friends, and the actors simply can't shake off their characters. Joey barely lasted two seasons (22 episodes of the second series were filmed, but only 14 aired), and The Comeback, starring Lisa Kudrow has vanished without trace.Joey is good, but Drea de Matteo is simply the best. She steals the show out from under Matt LeBlanc's nose and totally deserves her own show. Thankfully, I'm not the only one who thinks she looks like Traci Lords (then, not now), the similarity is remarkable. The show might have been a bigger success if she'd played the main role. The character of Alex, Joey's potential love interest right from the word go, is a simpering, whiny character who needs a good shaking.I would highly recommend getting Joey if you liked the original Friends (I will have to give mine back as there's a big gap in his case!), but don't expect another Friends. Don't go into it with high expectations, and you may actually find yourself enjoying it.Whatever happened to the rest of the Friends cast anyway? Two have had failed sitcoms, one has had a very public divorce, one is enjoying motherhood, and the other two are never heard of.Why did Friends end again?!",4,"""Hey giant plate of sandwiches!""",1161216000,"10 19, 2006",2006,2716,"['was', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Joey', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'light', 'Friends', 'character', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'being', 'given', 'spin', 'off', 'show', 'great', 'series', 'ended', 'Everyone', 'else', 'seemed', 'more', 'interested', 'movies', 'motherhood', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'Joey', 'was', 'huge', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'actually', 'released', 'DVD', 'UK', 'months', 'was', 'released', 'US', 'borrowing', 'found', 'sorely', 'missing', 'other', 'five', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'kept', 'expecting', 'Chandler', 'walk', 'door', 'was', 'funny.I', 'am', 'disappointed', 'other', 'five', 'Obviously', 'ruse', 'get', 'TV', 'series', 'Joey', 'moving', 'said', 'would', 'appear', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'Friends', 'fans', 'expecting', 'see', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'Rachel', 'Ross', 'Phoebe', 'again', 'will', 'barely', 'get', 'mention', ""'re"", 'mentioned', 'first', 'episode', 'not', 'name', 'then', 'Rachel', 'mentioned', 'last', 'episode', 'again', 'not', 'name', 'only', 'character', 'Friends', 'regularly', 'Ross', 'rather', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'directed', 'couple', 'episodes.The', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Joey', 'felt', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'was', 'simply', 'trying', 'hard', 'keep', 'character', 'Joey', 'fresh', 'new', 'was', 'never', 'greatest', 'character', 'Friends', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'final', 'series', 'not', 'have', 'major', 'storyline', 'why', 'decided', 'spin-off', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'idea', ""n't"", 'really', 'clear', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Friends', 'final', 'episode', 'let', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'just', 'keep', 'rewatching', 'Nothing', 'could', 'match', 'success', 'Friends', 'actors', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'off', 'characters', 'Joey', 'barely', 'lasted', 'two', 'seasons', '22', 'episodes', 'second', 'series', 'were', 'filmed', 'only', '14', 'aired', 'Comeback', 'starring', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'vanished', 'trace.Joey', 'good', 'Drea', 'Matteo', 'simply', 'best', 'steals', 'show', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'nose', 'totally', 'own', 'show', 'Thankfully', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'then', 'not', 'now', 'similarity', 'remarkable', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bigger', 'success', ""'d"", 'played', 'main', 'role', 'character', 'Alex', 'Joey', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'right', 'word', 'go', 'simpering', 'whiny', 'character', 'who', 'good', 'shaking.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'Joey', 'liked', 'original', 'Friends', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'mine', 'back', 'big', 'gap', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Friends', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'high', 'expectations', 'may', 'actually', 'find', 'enjoying', 'it.Whatever', 'happened', 'rest', 'Friends', 'cast', 'anyway', 'Two', 'have', 'had', 'failed', 'sitcoms', 'one', 'had', 'very', 'public', 'divorce', 'one', 'enjoying', 'motherhood', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'never', 'heard', 'of.Why', 'did', 'Friends', 'end', 'again']",Joey - The Complete First Season

I never expected it to be the juggernaut ""Friends"" was & I figured it would take a little while for the writers & cast to find their voices and the tone of the show.  I think they were just hitting their stride when the network pulled the plug.  A cast w/ great comic timing, their own set of foibles and a brand new setting in which Joey could ""find"" himself.  Switching coasts would've been a comic gold mine for future episodes - Joey was always limited in NYC and this opened up a whole new world for his cluelessness.  I especially enjoyed his interactions w/ his agent & his nephew;laugh-out-loud funny stuff!  Also, Adam Goldberg's appearance as Gina's ex (and possibly Michael's dad) was hilarious!  I was really starting to enjoy the Tribiani (pre-""Friends"") history which came out since the siblings were together.  This spinoff situation worked with ""Frasier"" and I'm VERY disappointed it wasn't given more time to develop.  ""Cheers"" and ""Seinfeld"" weren't hits right out of the box either but nowadays, if the irrelevent Nielsen numbers aren't there immediately, the axe falls.

However, what ""Frasier"" had in its favor was great writing and, crucially, a well-cast and sympathetic ensemble.""Joey"" should have fared well, since the creators were all former ""Friends"" writers, but the writing just is not up to the task.  It seems they lazily thought they could just move Joey to L.A. (as Frasier moved from Boston to Seatlle), surround him with family (like Frasier) and the funny would just happen.  Well, it doesn't.Joey is still the loveable goofball, but most of the characters around him contribute nothing to the show.  The funniest situations involve Joey away from the ensemble, and on set or elsewhere in the show biz world.Rather than copying the ""Frasier"" formula, the writers should have been a bit more innovative and had Joey in a different movie or TV setting each week, ditching the whole ensemble thing altogether.

About 1 year after the British release, 'Joey - Season 1' is now also available in the United States. Some people may have thought, that WB would use this time to spruce this puppy up a little. Sadly, though, it comes in the same pitiful layout, as the British Version did. They changed from the High Quality packaging that the 'Friends' Seasons came in and just put 4 Discs in Slim Cases.

I always liked Matt Leblanc's character and to see how Joey Tribbiani would fare out in LA after the safe comfy surroundings he had in the Big Apple had me curious from the start. I didn't try to compare it to Friends and I think the way they pursued the series was a wise move. I liked the chemistry between Joey and his sister, and her son was a great compliment to Joey's character. Unfoturnately we live in an age of instant gratification, and the people who are in charge are more concerned with ratings than with letting a show find its way--ask anyone connected with ""AfterMASH"", a show I'd love to see come out on DVD. ""Friends"" was a hard act to follow, and kudos to the crew of ""Joey"" for not trying to simply follow it but make it something of its own. I'm looking forward to season two so I can see the episodes that never aired (they had at least ten that never made it onto the air and they did kind of leave us hanging, sort of like the last episode of ""Benson"" where Robert Guillaume's character ran for governor and the show was cancelled without the second half of the cliffhanger). Four stars only for the lack of extras...all in all, a good job on packaging a series that was pulled before it really found its ground.",4,Sequel series almost never get their due...,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,1298,"['was', 'more', 'impressed', 'series', 'expected', 'be', 'always', 'liked', 'Matt', 'Leblanc', 'character', 'see', 'how', 'Joey', 'Tribbiani', 'would', 'fare', 'out', 'LA', 'safe', 'comfy', 'surroundings', 'had', 'Big', 'Apple', 'had', 'curious', 'start', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'compare', 'Friends', 'think', 'way', 'pursued', 'series', 'was', 'wise', 'move', 'liked', 'chemistry', 'Joey', 'sister', 'son', 'was', 'great', 'compliment', 'Joey', 'character', 'Unfoturnately', 'live', 'age', 'instant', 'gratification', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'charge', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'ratings', 'letting', 'show', 'find', 'way', 'ask', 'anyone', 'connected', 'AfterMASH', 'show', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'Friends', 'was', 'hard', 'act', 'follow', 'kudos', 'crew', 'Joey', 'not', 'trying', 'simply', 'follow', 'make', 'something', 'own', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'season', 'two', 'can', 'see', 'episodes', 'never', 'aired', 'had', 'least', 'ten', 'never', 'made', 'air', 'did', 'kind', 'leave', 'hanging', 'sort', 'last', 'episode', 'Benson', 'where', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'character', 'ran', 'governor', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'second', 'half', 'cliffhanger', 'Four', 'stars', 'only', 'lack', 'extras', 'good', 'job', 'packaging', 'series', 'was', 'pulled', 'really', 'found', 'ground']",Joey - The Complete First Season

Joey and Co. are no natural and the laughs come so easy I'm amazed this wasn't a ratings winner. There is something about the show that is so light and breezy, it's like taking a vacation without worrying all your stuff will get stolen.Sad so many think they need to weigh in here and ""remind"" us that Friends were better, but that's just opinion... isn't it? I see Joey as Friends Lite, and I LOVE IT!! Sadly, the extras are not there which is surprising for a newer show released on dvd, but the sound and picture quality are stellar.

But... its not one of those quality products of Warner bros. Apparently they have switched to use slim cases instead of fix glass cases to reduce production cost. and one of the surprises which I saw for the first time on a Warner DVD, it has no English subtitles, only Spanish & French which make it less usable for huge amount of american people and most of international users.I Saw an import version with 3 discs. each disc in american release has average of 5 GBs of data but a dual layer DVD has a capacity of 8. so, they could produce 3 discs instead of 4 and spent the extra money to make a standard case.
