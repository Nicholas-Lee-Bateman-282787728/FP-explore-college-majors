It shows the escalator at the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Stockbrokers are cold calling people to get them to buy the stocks that are being pushed in a Bull market. The stock market matches buyers to sellers. Financier Gordon Gekko knows how to profit from bad news. Bud Fox, a seller of stock, explains himself to his father (who knows of an unannounced FAA ruling). Will Bud use this inside information to better himself? Is it legal?Bud visits Gekko in a bid to move up in the world of high finance. Stocks are traded like baseball cards. Bud gets an order to buy a stock for Gekko. There are rewards for those who can pick winners in the stock market. Information is a valuable commodity, it can win battles. Bud shadows a British financier to learn what he is doing in NYC. This news causes Gekko to start buying shares in an Ohio steel company. Others also buy this stock, doubling its price. That night Bud visits the Gekko home. Sir Larry also visits Gekko to make an tender offer for Gekko's holdings. Gekko is also a shrewd investor in commodities like works of art. But takes a job with a maintenance company to allow him to snoop at other companies. [This is what the Watergate burglars did.] Bud's new found wealth allows him to pay back his debts, and then move to a new apartment in the East Side. He is also promoted for his increased sales; another salesman is let go because his didn't meet his quota. Life is sweet. Gekko's lawyer explains how Bud is to deposit money in an offshore bank in the Cayman Islands. There will be no traceable links to Gekko.The ""Stock Watch"" group noted how Teldar was in play. Will Gekko buy it to split it up and sell off its parts? Is a company run to benefit its managers and workers or its owners? If ownership is widely distributed then management has a free hand to reward itself. What happens to an ""over-funded pension fund""? [Does this explain the loss of pensions after the 1990s?] This film explains how new owners can profit by cutting wages for its workers and using this money to buy the company! Bud has a plan to save Bluestar Airlines; can it work? There is a dramatic scene between Bud and his father. Gekko has control of the shares, he can make more money quicker by breaking up Bluestar and selling off the pieces. [This allows bigger companies to eliminate competition and then raise their prices.] Gekko will also profit from looting the pension fund. The SEC is on their trail, they bring down the curtain on these financial looters. The dramatic ending is very ironic, Bud learned how to make a deal when it counts.This story is loosely based on the ""junk bonds"" used to buy up and sell off businesses in the 1980s. Decreased Federal regulation allowed this. This film was completed before the October 1987 crash. You can learn how wealth is created when rich financiers know when to buy and sell. They buy under-valued assets and sell them at a higher price. Corporations with decadent management are their targets, like injured cattle for big cats in the wild. When 1% of the people own half the wealth in a country what is the end result? [This film shows the high-technology of the 1980s: personal computers, bulky wireless telephones, etc. Note the work place environment.] This could not have happened before the 1980s under the New Deal SEC laws.",5,How Wealth is Created on Wall Street,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,3440,"['Wall', 'Street', '1989', 'filmThe', 'film', 'begins', 'showing', 'men', 'work', 'dawn', 'other', 'people', 'going', 'work', 'escalator', 'North', 'Tower', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Stockbrokers', 'are', 'cold', 'calling', 'people', 'get', 'buy', 'stocks', 'are', 'being', 'pushed', 'Bull', 'market', 'stock', 'market', 'buyers', 'sellers', 'Financier', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'how', 'profit', 'bad', 'news', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'seller', 'stock', 'father', 'who', 'unannounced', 'FAA', 'ruling', 'Will', 'Bud', 'use', 'inside', 'information', 'better', 'legal', 'Bud', 'Gekko', 'bid', 'move', 'up', 'world', 'high', 'finance', 'Stocks', 'are', 'traded', 'baseball', 'cards', 'Bud', 'order', 'buy', 'stock', 'Gekko', 'are', 'rewards', 'who', 'can', 'pick', 'winners', 'stock', 'market', 'Information', 'valuable', 'commodity', 'can', 'win', 'battles', 'Bud', 'British', 'financier', 'learn', 'what', 'doing', 'NYC', 'news', 'Gekko', 'start', 'buying', 'shares', 'Ohio', 'steel', 'company', 'Others', 'also', 'buy', 'stock', 'doubling', 'price', 'night', 'Bud', 'Gekko', 'home', 'Sir', 'Larry', 'also', 'Gekko', 'make', 'tender', 'offer', 'Gekko', 'holdings', 'Gekko', 'also', 'shrewd', 'investor', 'commodities', 'works', 'art', 'job', 'maintenance', 'company', 'allow', 'snoop', 'other', 'companies', '[', 'what', 'Watergate', 'burglars', 'did', ']', 'Bud', 'new', 'found', 'wealth', 'pay', 'back', 'debts', 'then', 'move', 'new', 'apartment', 'East', 'Side', 'also', 'promoted', 'increased', 'sales', 'salesman', 'let', 'go', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'quota', 'Life', 'sweet', 'Gekko', 'lawyer', 'how', 'Bud', 'deposit', 'money', 'offshore', 'bank', 'Cayman', 'Islands', 'will', 'be', 'traceable', 'links', 'Gekko.The', 'Stock', 'Watch', 'group', 'noted', 'how', 'Teldar', 'was', 'play', 'Will', 'Gekko', 'buy', 'split', 'up', 'sell', 'off', 'parts', 'company', 'run', 'benefit', 'managers', 'workers', 'owners', 'ownership', 'widely', 'distributed', 'then', 'management', 'free', 'hand', 'reward', 'What', 'over-funded', 'pension', 'fund', '[', 'explain', 'loss', 'pensions', '1990s', ']', 'film', 'how', 'new', 'owners', 'can', 'profit', 'cutting', 'wages', 'workers', 'using', 'money', 'buy', 'company', 'Bud', 'plan', 'save', 'Bluestar', 'Airlines', 'can', 'work', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'Bud', 'father', 'Gekko', 'control', 'shares', 'can', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'quicker', 'breaking', 'up', 'Bluestar', 'selling', 'off', 'pieces', '[', 'bigger', 'companies', 'eliminate', 'competition', 'then', 'raise', 'prices', ']', 'Gekko', 'will', 'also', 'profit', 'looting', 'pension', 'fund', 'SEC', 'trail', 'bring', 'down', 'curtain', 'financial', 'looters', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'very', 'ironic', 'Bud', 'learned', 'how', 'make', 'deal', 'when', 'counts.This', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'junk', 'bonds', 'used', 'buy', 'up', 'sell', 'off', 'businesses', '1980s', 'Decreased', 'Federal', 'regulation', 'allowed', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'October', '1987', 'crash', 'can', 'learn', 'how', 'wealth', 'created', 'when', 'rich', 'financiers', 'know', 'when', 'buy', 'sell', 'buy', 'under-valued', 'assets', 'sell', 'higher', 'price', 'Corporations', 'decadent', 'management', 'are', 'targets', 'injured', 'cattle', 'big', 'cats', 'wild', 'When', '1', '%', 'people', 'own', 'wealth', 'country', 'end', 'result', '[', 'film', 'high-technology', '1980s', 'personal', 'computers', 'bulky', 'wireless', 'telephones', 'etc', 'Note', 'work', 'place', 'environment', ']', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'happened', '1980s', 'New', 'Deal', 'SEC', 'laws']",N/A

But Stone didn't exclude the audience because the movie presents the fascinating and complex world in Wall Street, and also the movie shows very human feelings such as the ambition, the greed, the envy, the revenge and the personal integrity.The DVD doesn't include a lot of extra material, but the features that does include are quite good: an audio commentary by Oliver Stone, very valuable, of course, theatrical trailers and a very interesting ""Making Of Wall Street"" documentary, with interviews and commentaries by the cast and the production crew of the movie.

243152,A3LXYUYLV523ZD,6301016289,Andrius Uzkalnis,"[8, 14]","What Oliver Stone attempted to make - in a naive and narrow-minded way - was a critique of capitalism. Instead, he directed a film which is watched over and over again, and admired, by Capitalist Pigs like myself. What a nasty surprise to Mr Stone.This DVD features a documentary - quite good and fully justifying the purchase of DVD even if you already have a video, if only to learn Oliver Stone's socialist views told in his own words. The man actually believes that people who don't work in companies should not be allowed to own them - and he actually says that! You don't often hear such a naive socialist rhetoric these days.And then Douglas tells us how disappointed he is every time someone approaches him and confesses that the film was an inspiration for them to get into finance, stock market and fast-track lifestyle. Oh no. Another contender for hypocrisy prize.For anyone who remembers the depiction of Blue Star airline and its oh-so-heroic, oh-so-honest trade union people as primitive, shallow and one-dimensional, it will be very interesting to see that Stone and Sheen actually put a lot of their thought and effort into it. Who knew. If they had not been trying, could this depiction have been any more lame?I am pleased, in a kind of wicked way, that an attempt to attack capitalism turned out to be a collection of the most powerful quotes (""money never sleeps"", ""lunch is for wimps"" and the ultimate ""greed is good"") and ideological Bible of the people whom Oliver Stone despises most. Similarly, all the self-righteous trade-union ""honest men"" got a nightmare of a treatment - from someone who was just trying to glorify them.

He wants viewers to know a seminal experience for him was vietnam,whatever that exactly was for him,and that's really where he learned about people...it is true that people who go to war are inextricably changed by it...and many cant cope and a reading of case studies elucidates this point of traumatized soldiers,...so to be fair that's his view at looking at modern life..of course he has the experience of new york and wall street and his view of one person and his effect and what he tries to do in this financial hub. This film i recall watching on tv when younger,and it had three of my favorite stars,which Stone surprisingly cast in this film,not really known for acting in these kinds of roles and he took a big risk in casting them...and while filming he had problems pruning their talents as they may have been going through personal issues. A business movie...not always the kind of movie people want to view...and for that reason he puts in the romance of Hannah to appeal to a larger audience...and i think its there for that reason only...and he was surprised she took the role. Since this is a serious role and since it fits in,are these characters,douglas' alter ego of gyetko well put together by him,typical of american conservatism...or are they solipist type characters?I always disliked ayn rand for propagating these kinds of characters and philosophies,and so called freedoms,and the Douglas character says you are not living really in democracy but in a cpitalist haven, for that reason i see this as an ayn rand type person,a controversial figure novelist whom even the conservative icon william f buckley was not that comfortable with and i was perusing after watching the film collected speeches by him,and the same thought crossed his mind solipsism,a business person who uses all his wiles and means,not always legally,to build up a huge fortune and at times leaving a destruction of bankrupt companies and interference in the free market system...which detrimentally effects too many lives..as the union capitalist debate in this film dovetails. The two sheen's also are involved in father -son,betrayal type relationships...which the Douglas character is also involved in. Stone does allow the Douglas character a long speech on american capitalism..in defense of it..but he like most solipsists care little about anything,family,friends...nation...but only the enlargement of their self...the 'grandiose self.'Douglas does try to groom charlie to be a 'person' like him,not just to fulfill a job,...and he at film's end feels betrayed..and who else does the director want us to feel is being betrayed. The world of union politics versus capitalism,of the workers international,belongs in 'hard times' and charles dickens,the world we inhabit today is a globalized world...promoting capitalism is not enough...the countries moving ahead now are also internally restructuring in this complex world...a la the philosophy of bill gates the education guru...every nation today is capitalist..a modern economy is really needed and all that means to be successful...but a good film viewed many years later...with three of my favorite people many years ago surprisingly in this film,in which the author uses his war experiences to develop a fable..and i long hoped for a sequel and will watch it next as should all viewers of this film",5,wall street revisited....a great movie of human nature,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,3552,"['oliver', 'stone', 'captured', 'mood', 'modern', 'times', 'expose', 'wall', 'street', 'life', 'ethos', 'modern', 'times', 'need', 'actually', 'understand', 'view', 'see', 'what', 'make', 'viewers', 'know', 'seminal', 'experience', 'was', 'vietnam', 'exactly', 'was', 'really', 'where', 'learned', 'people', 'true', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'war', 'are', 'inextricably', 'changed', 'many', 'cant', 'cope', 'reading', 'case', 'studies', 'point', 'traumatized', 'soldiers', 'so', 'be', 'fair', 'view', 'looking', 'modern', 'life..of', 'course', 'experience', 'new', 'york', 'wall', 'street', 'view', 'one', 'person', 'effect', 'what', 'do', 'financial', 'hub', 'film', 'i', 'recall', 'watching', 'tv', 'when', 'younger', 'had', 'three', 'favorite', 'stars', 'Stone', 'surprisingly', 'cast', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'known', 'acting', 'kinds', 'roles', 'took', 'big', 'risk', 'casting', 'filming', 'had', 'problems', 'pruning', 'talents', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'personal', 'issues', 'business', 'movie', 'not', 'always', 'kind', 'movie', 'people', 'want', 'view', 'reason', 'romance', 'Hannah', 'appeal', 'larger', 'audience', 'i', 'think', 'reason', 'only', 'was', 'surprised', 'took', 'role', 'serious', 'role', 'are', 'characters', 'douglas', 'alter', 'ego', 'gyetko', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'typical', 'american', 'conservatism', 'are', 'solipist', 'type', 'characters', 'always', 'disliked', 'ayn', 'rand', 'propagating', 'kinds', 'characters', 'philosophies', 'so', 'called', 'freedoms', 'Douglas', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'living', 'really', 'democracy', 'cpitalist', 'haven', 'reason', 'i', 'see', 'ayn', 'rand', 'type', 'person', 'controversial', 'figure', 'novelist', 'whom', 'even', 'conservative', 'icon', 'william', 'f', 'buckley', 'was', 'not', 'comfortable', 'i', 'was', 'perusing', 'watching', 'film', 'collected', 'speeches', 'same', 'thought', 'crossed', 'mind', 'solipsism', 'business', 'person', 'who', 'wiles', 'means', 'not', 'always', 'legally', 'build', 'up', 'huge', 'fortune', 'times', 'leaving', 'destruction', 'bankrupt', 'companies', 'interference', 'free', 'market', 'system', 'detrimentally', 'effects', 'too', 'many', 'lives..as', 'union', 'capitalist', 'debate', 'film', 'two', 'sheen', 'also', 'are', 'involved', 'father', '-son', 'betrayal', 'type', 'relationships', 'Douglas', 'character', 'also', 'involved', 'Stone', 'allow', 'Douglas', 'character', 'long', 'speech', 'american', 'capitalism..in', 'defense', 'it..but', 'most', 'solipsists', 'care', 'little', 'anything', 'family', 'friends', 'nation', 'only', 'enlargement', 'self', ""'grandiose"", 'self', ""'Douglas"", 'try', 'groom', 'charlie', 'be', ""'person"", 'not', 'just', 'fulfill', 'job', 'film', 'end', 'feels', 'betrayed..and', 'who', 'else', 'director', 'want', 'feel', 'being', 'betrayed', 'world', 'union', 'politics', 'versus', 'capitalism', 'workers', 'international', ""'hard"", 'times', 'charles', 'dickens', 'world', 'inhabit', 'today', 'globalized', 'world', 'promoting', 'capitalism', 'not', 'enough', 'countries', 'moving', 'ahead', 'now', 'are', 'also', 'internally', 'restructuring', 'complex', 'world', 'la', 'philosophy', 'bill', 'education', 'guru', 'nation', 'today', 'capitalist..a', 'modern', 'economy', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'successful', 'good', 'film', 'viewed', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'three', 'favorite', 'people', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'surprisingly', 'film', 'author', 'war', 'experiences', 'develop', 'fable..and', 'i', 'long', 'hoped', 'sequel', 'will', 'watch', 'next', 'should', 'viewers', 'film']",N/A

It stands as one of his most intellegent and accomplished films, with a smart (if overly-technical) script and superb acting.Charlie Sheen, the quintessential 80's heartthrob, takes on a new role as Bud Fox, an ambitious young stock trader. He works his days selling stocks, all the while hoping to be a player in the same league as the big guys. One such big guy is Gordon Gekko (Michaek Douglas, in a standout performance), a millionaire tycoon who makes his living buying out companies and liquidating them for profit. He takes Fox under his wing, gives him a taste of the wealth and power, and Fox becomes insatiable. So much that he makes some wrong decisions, not realizing that this new power and wealth comes at a higher cost, one that he cannot afford.The 80's was characterized by hotshot young executives looking for the quick and easy buck, and Oliver Stones portrayed that very well here. Gordon Gekko is the benchmark corporate villian, someone who one see's the world only in shades of green. The acting in this movie is first rate, especially from Michael Douglas. The long lines of dialogue, the speeches, and the emotional undertones are a challenge for any actor, and all involved here did an excellent job. I often watch ""Wall Street"" just for the acting.The DVD is not a full-blown Special Edition, but it's a quality release nonetheless. Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful and articulate, even though he rambles and speaks in an annoying deep voice. The ""Making Of"" documentary is a real treat. Simply titled ""Money Never Sleeps"", it is over 1 hour of new interviews with the cast and crew, discussing all major points of the movie and the stories behind the scenes. It is one of the better DVD-exclusive documentaries I have seen.Whether or not you find the subject interesting, ""Wall Street"" is a great movie in almost every way. While the script wanders off into technical stock jargon, it is one of the best scripts I have ever seen put to film. The acting is top notch, and Oliver Stone directs with panache and style.

243158,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6301016289,calvinnme,"[14, 16]","""Wall Street"" is a movie that seems to spark much debate. Basically, it is the working out of a moral struggle within young Wall Street trader Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) between the values with which he was raised of hard work and success through actual creation, versus those of his mentor Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) who succeeds through corporate raiding and ""creative destruction"". From Bud's viewpoint his dad's (Martin Sheen) roadmap for success and happiness seems old-fashioned to the point of being prehistoric compared to Gekko's, until Gekko sets his sights and his wrecking ball on his father's company, and Bud is forced to choose. Many people associate this with a liberal versus conservative viewpoint on business, a wild-west economy versus a planned economy and relegate this film to 1980's era nostalgia, like the now humorously giant cell phone Gekko is talking on as he walks along the beach. It is said that neither extreme works and that we've gradually settled towards something in the middle. However, the Gekkos of this world are smarter than that, and over the past 20 years have set up an economic system that serves them well. What we now have is a situation where the haves and have-mores have a planned - almost Soviet - system in which the rules stratify them at the top. I cite the changes in bankruptcy law as exhibit A. The labor force that serves them, however, are in the wild-west economy that was once advocated for everyone. Some will rise to the stratified top in this situation, but the vast majority will remain at the bottom shooting it out with each other - for scarce good jobs, good health care, education, etc. Thus, to me, Wall Street is just an opening chapter in the saga of how economic forces and attitudes toward them have changed, not the portrait of a 20 year-old fad that has come and gone.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 7]","Wall Street is interesting as an entertaining and compelling story, that made for a very enjoyable movie experience; but on a deeper level, there is a message about the dangers of unrestrained capitalism--a message that is unfortunately undercut by the dashing and charismatic character of Gordon Gekko, who delivers a speech that is the centerpiece of the film, a speech that really captured the tenor of the times, the Me Generation ethos of the late 80s, the now famous and still remembered and quoted ""Greed is Good"" speech:""The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much.""Director Oliver Stone wanted this character to be the villain, giving him the name of a lizard. He was meant to be a cold blooded reptilian character, like a dragon hoarding his treasure in a cave. Some young people take him as a role model. He was clearly not supposed to be, but look at another Oliver Stone film, Natural Born Killers, and the same thing happened there. Oliver Stone takes chances in his films, and though they don't always turn out the way he plans, you have to admire the man. This film in particular really captured an era, and he showed tremendous foresight, in fact it was released in 1987, just before one of the biggest stock market melt-downs in history that happened in October of that year. It also shows the power of information, and even though that information is used to manipulate the market and destroy companies, it truly does foreshadow The Information Age. It is quaint to see the crude graphics on the screens of the computers they used, but what insight it showed into what power would be unleashed by the information displayed there.So, this movie is enjoyable on these two levels, as entertaining drama, and as a serious message about money, capitalism, and the rampant greed of the late 80s, but it is also entertaining just for the behind the scenes drama of the people in it.First, there is a very strong father/son element to Wall Street. Oliver Stone's father, Louis Stone, was a big trader on Wall Street. The film is dedicated to him. And, Oliver Stone's own son, Sean Stone, plays one of Gordon Gekko's children. Oliver Stone was himself a Vietnam veteran, and he had cast Charlie Sheen in Platoon, a big success for them both just the year before. After Wall Street, he would make another Vietnam film, Born on the Fourth of July, but instead of casting Charlie as promised, Tom Cruise would get the role. Stone didn't even bother to tell him, which led to a falling out and they have never worked together since.Charlie Sheen's father, Martin Sheen, played Charlie's character's dad, Carl Fox. Charlie was Bud Fox. Father and son both had big success playing soldiers in Viet Nam, and both would have near-death experiences while making them. While filming Apocalypse Now the elder Sheen suffered a heart attack, and while filming Platoon, the younger Sheen almost fell out of a helicopter. I will revisit the father/son theme later when I discuss Michael Douglas, but back to the Sheen's for now. A lot of the drama of Wall Street revolves around the father/son relationship. Bud Fox's dad works for an airline, and he is hard working and honest. Bud uses inside information gleaned from his father to win favor with Gordon Gekko, who uses that information to gain control of the airline, and then try to wreck it and sell off the pieces. This betrayal is the pivotal point of the whole movie.Martin Sheen's real name is Ramon Antonio Gerard Est&eacute;vez. He is part Irish, and part Spanish, and enjoys being Spanish almost as much as he does being Irish, and he really enjoys being Irish. Though he has played President of the United States at least 4 times, perhaps most memorably as President Jed Bartlett on the long running TV series The West Wing, in real life he is a life long political activist who has been arrested at protests over 70 times. He also knows all the lyrics and can sing every song that was ever sung by Frank Sinatra. In addition to Charlie, 3 of his other children are also actors. Emilio Est&eacute;vez is Charlie's older brother, and 2 others go by the Est&eacute;vez name. But those who know him say that he is closest to his son, Charlie. ""No father could ever be prouder of his son,"" said, Sheen, the Elder.  ""I hold Charlie's accomplishments dearer than my own. He has been through so much and overcome so much more. Even if he weren't my son he'd still be my best friend.""Charlie Sheen's real name was Carlos Irwin Est&eacute;vez. He was born on September 3, 1965, in New York City. He was born a ""blue baby,"" and the doctor who saved him was named Irwin, and hence the middle name. Though he was only 2 years old when Danny O'Keefe wrote ""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues"" in 1967, it really could have been written about him. One of his nick names is Good Time Charlie, and the other is The Machine, which is partly due to his name being Sheen. At the trial of Heidi Fleiss he testified under oath that he spent over $50,000 on her high priced call girls. He is a notorious womanizer, boozer, and druggie, who has perhaps finally settled down, at least with regards to drugs and booze. At one point he almost died of a cocaine overdose, and he was in and out of rehab. Once he checked in for only a day.""One of my fondest memories is when Slash, from Guns N' Roses, sat me down at his house and said, `You've got to clean up your act.' You know you've gone too far when Slash is saying, `Look, you've got to get into rehab, you have to shut it down. You're going to die.' He's a terrific guy and I love him, he's a buddy of mine, but I had to step back from that situation and go, `Yeah, but you're Slash. Whaddya mean?' We'd been up for about four days. But I still heard him because a part of me was saying, `This isn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be. Something's missing.'""Platoon and Wall Street are so far his best film roles, but he has settled into a cozy career as a sit com actor, first on Spin City, and currently on Two and a Half Men, which is already in syndication, playing reruns twice a day Monday through Friday, while still making fresh episodes. The character is loosely based on himself, though one would think it is a very much watered down version. As with his role in Spin City, his characters always seem to be named Charlie.Continuing the father/son theme, actor Michael Douglas is the son of well-known actor Kirk Douglas. The elder Douglas is best known for his role as Spartacus.""I am Spartacus.""""I am Spartacus.""""I am Spartacus.""Michael Douglas had a breakthrough role as Inspector Steve Keller on the TV cop series The Streets of San Francisco. He played opposite veteran actor Karl Malden. He played some comedies and even played Zach in the movie version of A Chorus Line before playing in Fatal Attraction, in 1987, the same year as Wall Street, and Basic Instinct, in 1992. Recently there was a series on NPR (National Public Radio) of the most memorable characters from film and fiction, and Gordon Gekko was profiled. Premiere Magazine had a list of the 100 most memorable characters from film, and Gordon Gekko was #25. Michael Douglas won an Oscar for the role. Besides being married to the much younger (25 years) Catherine Zeta-Jones, his role as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street will no doubt be his legacy:Gordon Gekko: If you need a friend, get a dog.Gordon Gekko: The most valuable commodity I know of is information.Gordon Gekko: Greed captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.Gordon Gekko: I look at a hundred deals a day. I pick one.Gordon Gekko: Lunch is for wimps.Gordon Gekko: You're walking around blind without a cane, pal. A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place.Gordon Gekko: Ever wonder why fund managers can't beat the S&P; 500? 'Cause they're sheep, and sheep get slaughtered.Gordon Gekko: [at the Teldar Paper stockholder's meeting] Well, I appreciate the opportunity you're giving me Mr. Cromwell as the single largest shareholder in Teldar Paper, to speak. Well, ladies and gentlemen we're not here to indulge in fantasy but in political and economic reality. America, America has become a second-rate power. Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. Now, in the days of the free market when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the stockholder. The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men that built this great industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake. Today, management has no stake in the company! All together, these men sitting up here own less than three percent of the company. And where does Mr. Cromwell put his million-dollar salary? Not in Teldar stock; he owns less than one percent. You own the company. That's right, you, the stockholder. And you are all being royally screwed over by these, these bureaucrats, with their luncheons, their hunting and fishing trips, their corporate jets and golden parachutes.Cromwell: This is an outrage! You're out of line Gekko!Gordon Gekko: Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell, Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over 200 thousand dollars a year. Now, I have spent the last two months analyzing what all these guys do, and I still can't figure it out. One thing I do know is that our paper company lost 110 million dollars last year, and I'll bet that half of that was spent in all the paperwork going back and forth between all these vice presidents. The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be survival of the unfittest. Well, in my book you either do it right or you get eliminated. In the last seven deals that I've been involved with, there were 2.5 million stockholders who have made a pretax profit of 12 billion dollars. Thank you. I am not a destroyer of companies. I am a liberator of them! The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much.Gordon Gekko: Greed is good.This movie also had some other interesting characters/actors and character actors. John C. McGinley plays Marv, one of the other stock traders who works alongside Bud Fox. He is familiar as Dr. Perry Cox, the anti social doctor on TV sit com Scrubs. And Hal Holbrook is working there, too. Sylvia Miles plays a crass Real Estate Agent. She was nominated for an Oscar for Midnight Cowboy, and has been on the Hollywood/New York party scene for like ever. The best line about her was when someone name dropped that she would be at an art gallery opening, someone, can't remember who but if anyone does, please help me provide them with the proper credit, quipped: ""Sylvia Miles would go to the opening of an envelope."" James Spader (Sex, Lies & Videotape) plays a lawyer friend of Bud's. He currently plays a lawyer on Boston Legal. Daryl Hannah plays a designer who is Bud's girlfriend, once he starts making money. She is secretly in bed with Gekko, though. Her biggest tabloid moment was when she was a back-up singer and girlfriend to Jackson Browne, and he allegedly got rough with her. Then John F. Kennedy Jr. reportedly came to her rescue. Daryl's breakout role was as the acrobatic, beautiful replicant Pris in Blade Runner (1982); Pris was the vixen who wanted to live beyond her allotted years.Segue to Sean Young, who was also in Blade Runner. What a classic movie, and was she ever great in it. I have always liked her, but she seems to attract ugly rumors like a magnet. She plays Kate Gekko in Wall Street, Gordon's wife. Her role was bigger at first, but during filming she rubbed Oliver Stone the wrong way. Whether that story is true or false, she is barely on screen long enough to register.In 1988, Young appeared in The Boost with James Woods. Woods later sued her for harassing both him and his then-fianc&eacute;e, alleging that Young left a disfigured doll on his doorstep in addition to other disruptive behavior. Young denied the allegations and claimed that Woods filed the lawsuit out of spite. Young stated, ""It was a crush being turned down, that's all.... So sue me! And he [Woods] did."" The suit was settled out of court in 1989.In 1989, she was cast as Vicki Vale in Tim Burton's Batman. During rehearsals, she broke her arm after falling off a horse and was replaced by Kim Basinger. In an unsuccessful attempt to win the role as Catwoman (which ultimately went to Michelle Pfeiffer) in the sequel Batman Returns, Young constructed a homemade Catwoman costume and attempted to confront director Tim Burton and actor Michael Keaton during production.Young was fired from the 1990 movie Dick Tracy. Cast as Tess Trueheart, she was officially fired for not appearing maternal in the role. Young later claimed she was fired because she rebuffed Warren Beatty's advances (a claim Beatty denies).Sean Young appeared in Fatal Instinct, a parody of both Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction--take that, Michael Douglas.In January 2008, Young checked herself into rehab for alcohol abuse the day after an outburst at the Directors Guild of America awards in Los Angeles. Young was removed from the awards ceremony after repeatedly heckling director Julian Schnabel, who was onstage giving his remarks regarding his Best Director nomination for his work on the film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.I hope Sean Young recovers from her problems. But if Charlie Sheen could do it, so can she.Even as we speak a writer is working on a sequel to Wall Street. Oliver Stone isn't involved, but Michael Douglas has agreed to reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The title, which was used already for a documentary about the making of Wall Street, is Money Never Sleeps.Thanks to the Internet Movie Database and Wikipedia for the quotes and other biographical information.

243162,A3CTCYWH8F03XO,6301016289,Clayton John Miller,"[2, 4]","WALL STREETOliver Stone, after conquering the panic and fear of vietnam in PLATOON, followed up with a gung assault on Reagan era greed and gluttony and insider trading. WALL STREET is that film's title, and a young, wide-eyed Charlie Sheen plays the blue collar boy that grows up to be a white collar success on as a broker, all the while breaking his dad's heart. A surrogate father of sorts comes Sheen's way in the devilish shape of Michael Dougas as a huge power player that mutters the immortal tagline: &quot;Greed is good.&quot; Sheen is lead down the wrong path and ultimately has to decide between his stacks of cash or his own integrity.This great film is quite a morality play and is just one of the shiny gems adorning Stone's filmography. It is a film that has no clear cut protagonist, just a man who wants to be honest and get rich quick, but finds that one can rarely be both. This film is quickly shaping up to be one of the keenest insights into that decadent decade... a film that will more than likely stand the test of time.It is truly a contemporary classic.Another note:  The movie would be great on a double bill with the recently released BOILER ROOM. One key scene in that film has the leads gathered together at home viewing WALL STREET. These shady young brokers know each and every line by heart, showing viewers exactly what these men are and what they want to be.

243165,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,6301016289,Cubist,"[103, 105]","When Oliver Stone made Wall Street, he was riding high from the commercial and critical success ofPlatoon (Special Edition). His father, Lou Stone, had been a stockbroker on Wall Street in New York City and this film was a son's way of paying tribute to his father. Almost twenty years later, it has become one of the quintessential snapshots of the financial scene in the United States and epitomizes the essence of capitalism, greed and materialism that was so prevalent in the 1980s.Michael Douglas owns the role of Gekko and by extension dominates the movie with his larger than life character. He gets most of the film's best dialogue and delivers it with such conviction. There is a scene between Bud and Gekko in a limousine where he tells the younger man how the financial world works, how it operates and lays it all out, pushing Bud hard to go into business with him. It is one of the strongest scenes in the movie because you really believe what Gekko is saying and how Bud could be seduced by his words.The culmination of Douglas' performance is his much lauded, often quoted, ""Greed is good"" speech that his character gives to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. He concludes by saying, ""Greed is right; greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms, greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge -- has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed, you mark my words -- will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the U.S.A."" This is one of the best delivered monologues ever put to film as Douglas goes from charming to downright threatening and back again, succinctly summing up the essence of '80 capitalism and greed.The original DVD did not have many extras but the quality of what was included was excellent. They have all been carried over to this new release (minus the trailers) but do the new extras really merit a double dip?There is an audio commentary by co-writer and director Oliver Stone. Stone talks about Michael Douglas' early struggles with the huge amount of dialogue he had to deliver and how he dealt with it. The filmmaker is candid with his shortcomings and those of others (i.e. Daryl Hannah, Charlie Sheen, etc.). As always, Stone delivers the goods, offering all kinds of fascinating insights into the making of the film.The second disc features a new introduction by Oliver Stone that is brief and really should have been put on the first disc.Another new extra is ""Greed is Good,"" an hour-long retrospective documentary with Hal Hoolbrook, John C. McGinley, Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas amongst others returning to offer their impressions of the financial world depicted in the movie. This substantial doc examines the appeal of Gekko and why he inspired people in the business world.Also new to this edition is over 20 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by Stone. There is a nice little scene with Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller as one of Bud's clients.

Awful writing and acting, although to be fair to Michael Douglas, an actor can do only so much with the lines given him.

Then, bang, it turned my fantasy on its head, and showed the incredible ugliness and soullessness behind the fantasy.  (At this point I considered turning off the movie, as I started feeling physically repulsed.  Thankfully I hung in there.)  But then, shocker of shockers, the plot changed, the ugliness was exposed for what it was, and the protagonist came to his senses:  he realized the false path he was on and used the power he had gained to try to salvage himself.  He may not have salvaged himself perfectly, but he did a damn good job.The acting, overall, was excellent.  Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen were stunning, and so were most of the lesser characters.  Charlie Sheen was great overall, but had some occasionally weak moments that detracted from the film's believability.  Daryl Hannah was good overall but at some key moments came across as too sweet and gentle for the part.  Yet by no means do they kill this film; it's bigger than they are.Also:  excellent writing too.  I was impressed.There's a reason this film remains a classic after over two decades.

243172,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,6301016289,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[19, 24]","""Wall Street"" is iconic.But let's step back a second: I'll beging with a little Wall Street habit called Full Disclosure: Oliver Stone's stunning, iconic ""Wall Street"" is an amazingly hard movie for me to review, in part because it was, for me, one of those rare watershed events that shaped my futue and changed---even charted---my career.One of Oliver Stone's best movies, it was intended as a morality play in which Stone's mouthpiece, played by Martin Sheen as a stoic airline mechanic who has seen it all, condemned the helter-skelter rampant greed of the corporate raiders, Wall Street insider tycoons, and high-flying investment bankers of the 1980's, the much maligned ""Decade of Greed"".But let's stop for moment, and consider: how many of you who've seen the film wanted to *be* Gordon Gecko, ""Wall Street""'s cigar chomping, greenmailing uber-dealmaker, who ratcheted up Ivan Boesky's ""Greed is OK"" into what became the motto of deal-makers the world over: ""Greed is Good. Greed Works.""I sure did. Born during the hippy Summer of Love and a proverbial child of the eighties, I saw ""Wall Street"" and knew, immediately, what I wanted to become. I sliced off my mohawk, grew my hair, and slicked it back, and dedicated my life to mastering high finance and the art of the deal.And I wasn't the only one, to judge by fellow MBA alums and investment banking colleagues; even a sequence in ""Boiler Room"" shows a new generation of deal-seeking young Turks watching ""Wall Street"" on a plasma TV, regaling each other with their word-perfect recitation of Gecko's lines.""Wall Street"", then, should be served up piping hot to the innocent with a dollop of caution: as one reviewer noted, what Stone had intended as a bloody criticism of greed gone rampant quickly became a full-bodied recruiting video for the investment banking industry.And what a recruiting video it is: Stone perfected his quick cuts and 'wall of information' with ""Wall Street"", proving his mastery of the new MTV-era of rich, lush, rapidly moving images and an editing style that wouldn't have been out of place in a music video.Stone is like that. As a director, he has an uncanny ability to glamorize that which he most wants to criticize, just as he did with the alluringly violent Mickey and Mallory Knox in ""Natural Born Killers.""And ""Wall Street"" is one of those rare reversals where life imitates art: throughout top-tier MBA programs and modern investment banks, the image of the stalking, cigar-smoking, summer-home in the Hamptons, limo-insulated, braces-sporting deal maker has become the ideal, sometimes getting the better of real Wall Street mavericks who let romance cloud their common sense and appeared on the covers of Fortune and Forbes---only to be shot down by their envious employers.The plot is nothing new: a Horatio Alger story in which hungry young stockbroker (played perfectly by Charlie Sheen) Bud Fox tires of spending his days in a cheap Queens apartment chasing small retail investors, and sets his sights on the 'elephant': the maverick corporate raider Gordon Gecko (played by Michael Douglas in the role of his career).Fox, for once, has an opening beyond Gecko's favorite box of cigars: he knows his father's airline, Blue Star, is worth more than the market thinks it is because of impending deregulation in the airlines; Gecko takes the bait, and brings Fox, quickly, into the high-octane world of deal-making and insider information---as Gecko's spy.The acting is uniformly good: apart from Sheen and Douglas, you have the inimitable Sean Young as Gecko's social-climbing wife, Darryl Hannah puckish as fashion designer Darien, pre-""The Limey"" Terence Stamp hard as nails as a British corporate raider and Gecko's nemesis, and a troop of veteran character actors: Hal Holbrook as Fox's brokerage house mentor, James Spader as a naive M&A; attorney, and the immortal James Karen as Fox's fickle boss.From the opening riffs of Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon"" to the closing image of a trading grid imposed over the lower Manhattan skyline, Stone's editing and direction is fast-paced, frenetic, and exotic: the viewer, like Fox, is pulled into the upper reaches of a world where anything is possible and money is the common denominator.There are some subtle touches, like Gecko's beach house, festooned with atrocious artwork kept only as an investment---and as a barometer of the notoriously fickle and fast moving Market itself.And for those ""Wall Street""-heads who have seen the movie a thousand times (I must be getting close), there are some sweet glitches the editors never caught: when Gecko makes his pitch for a 'friendly' takeover of Blue Star, watch his feet carefully.Often imitated, never surpassed, ""Wall Street"" is a stylish, intoxicating, stunning embodiment of an era when anybody could carve his way to the very top of American society by ruthless ambition and sheer determination; it was true when it was made, and it is possibly even more true today.So strap on your braces, slick back your hair, light up an Esplendido and fire up the DVD player---money never sleeps, pal.JSG",5,"""Now let me show you *my* charts.""

The film was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD30K Blu-Ray player. The PQ was not excellent, especially in darker scenes-it contained significant grain and noise, but adequate to enjoy as a hi-def film-3.5/5. The AQ was not overwhelming, but sounds and music were correct for each seen, strong throughout-4/5. Overall quality of transfer for picture and sound 3.5/5.The ambitious Bud Fox rises to the top under the guidance of a ruthless business man who cuts corners and cuts throats to get ahead. The materialism often documented in the 80's appears full throttle, and all characters in the film, except the token reminder of morality-Bud's Dad, are all infected with the greed. The film is an interesting portrayal of the time period, but also how a person's character can become compromise. The average person could fall prey to glitz and glamor of this ""no limits"" life style.In Stone's typical stylistic manner, he executes the film and story arc of the rise and fall of Bud Fox in a well timed manner. In the end Gecko still prevails, despite of his tactics, but it is Bud who saves his father's company, albeit inadvertently being punished for the route the initially chose.I was in my teens in the 80's, and the decade holds a certain fascination for me. The film is one of my favorites of the era, and is definitely worth seeing. It is not crushed by the same over the top humor and kitch that is present in some of the more light-hearted 80's films, but instead is a more conscious-grabbing serious character examination of the era, and the effect on character that limitless ""aquisition"" of materialism can cause.The film is still relevant today, as it seems this greed is still present in our society, and has become an accepted norm and side effect of our capitalistic society.

Back before dot-coms and cyber trading and Google there was Poker-faced stock trading; it is the quintessential evolutionary process.  And the intoxicating allure of power and mind-boggling wealth is brought to the forte in Oliver Stone's classic WALL STREET.  It's a trip down memory lane to go back and view this film again, with its DOS computer prompts and portable phones the size of Rhode Island.  Long before wealth and success and ambition were demonized by our culture, Stone depicts a young stockbroker's foray into lugubrious corruption and power; yet once young Bud Fox gets his first taste of blood in the water, it's not long before he's in over his head, and then the price to pay becomes daunting indeed.  And it's just as much fun to watch today as it was in 1987.Charlie Sheen (long before the substance abuse took its toll on his boyish looks) is marvelous as the easily-impressed, ultimately overwhelmed Fox; Bud just wants to make his father (played by real-life papa Martin) proud of him, plus make his own way in the world.  Which makes him a prime candidate for seduction by financier extraordinaire Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas was born to play this role); once Bud gets a glimpse of Gordon's world with its fabulous riches and power, he willingly does what he knows is dead wrong (not to mention illegal):  making money via insider trading.  Naturally over the course of events Bud's life unravels, and the SEC comes calling--and even Gekko himself is no longer immune to the justice coming over the horizon.  And at the risk of being redundant, it's very fun to watch.In addition to Douglas and the two Sheens WALL STREET sports a grand cast, including John C. McGinley, Hal Holbrook, Daryl Hannah, and the wonderful Terence Stamp.  One star off due to the vapidity of the subject matter and its often simplistic manifestation, but hey, greed still takes center stage.  Nowadays we would just be concerned if Bud and Gordo would pay their fair share; after all, the corruption has now shifted to the Potomac.--D.

It very accurately portrays the wild, amoral, hedonistic capitalism of the day, which is anything but religious or prudish.  I wonder how it came to be that stockbrokers ended up in the same political bandwagon as the Bible Belters.  The movie portrays capitalism's weak spots only too realistically, the unfortunate thorn to a system which, if managed properly like it is in modern Europe, can work well to deliver widespread prosperity and social justice.  But American politicians haven't gotten the right formula yet thanks to the guys you see in this film.Michael Douglas's voice and demeanor work wonders to create the classic greed-addicted corporate raider who wreaks havoc with the markets and in the process gains control over the future of thousands of workers.  You won't find many references to Nike, Microsoft, or Starbucks here due to the time lapse since.  But many older investors will remember all the businesses named in this movie.  [name here] plays an intelligent newbie who has all the savvy moves down in no time, but maintains some sense of social justice and democratic values to the end, which are a driving force for one of his &quot;revenge&quot; moves that you'll see if you watch it.Douglas's speech in the shareholder meeting is excellent but misnamed:  it should be Ambition is Good since excessive Greed leads to a deterioration of workers' living standards and an eventual collapse of the economy, like what happened in the 1920s and what is happening today on a smaller scale.  But he points out very directly that the desire to achieve and receive a &quot;badge of honor&quot; is the driving force behind human creativity.

243192,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,6301016289,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 2]","The Big Bad Wolf, in this fictional account of ruthless  criminal insider trading on Wall Street, is Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). The Little Pig is a young financial nobody named Charlie Fox (Charlie Sheen), who uses a lot of chutzpah and an accidental tip from his father to hook up with Gekko, whom he aspires to emulate. The father (Martin Sheen) is that rarity in modern America, an honest man who would rather work productively than get rich quick. The year is 1985, Reagan is President, Greed is both patriotic and Divinely approved, and the stock market is bullish. 2% of Americans own 50% of all wealth, with two-thirds of that wealth inherited. Money, according to Gekko, is not 'made' but merely transferred to those who have the 'stuff' he has, the same 'stuff' he professes to see in young Fox. He will, of course, betray his naive protege when and if ....It's the superb acting of Douglas and Sheen, and the taut directing of Oliver Stone, that make this film hugely successful as drama. Whether it fairly represents the ethical morass of high finance in America and the deplorable failure of American ideals, or rather unfairly caricatures the wizards of Wall Street who revitalized American business, has been a point of controversy ever since the film first appeared. Critics have derided Oliver Stone as a lefty extremist pursuing an anti-capitalist agenda. There ough to be a ""viewers' discretion"" warning on this film, I think; if all you know about the stock market is what you hear on TV and radio talk shows, you really aren't qualified to judge it except as entertainment. And believe me, it is entertaining.Some of the people involved in making the film have asserted that Gekko's character was based on the real-life figure of Michael Milken, the Junk Bond KIng, who was convicted of securities fraud as a result of an investigation of insider trading in 1989. Other candidates for the prototype of Gekko include the disgraced Ivan Boesky, who delivered a famous speech extolling Greed at UC Berkeley in 1986 and who lived by that ideal to the hilt. It happens that I knew Michael Milken personally for a while; he was the close kin of an in-law of my wife. His family and my wife's family had been going to each other's Bar Mitzvahs for decades. Michael Milken was formidably quick-minded and cool-headed about greed, but he was neither as handsome nor as steely-blue menacing as Gekko. As a study of financial concupiscence, however, Gekko could well represent Milken.And now? Gordon Gekko has remained an iconic figure, such a plausible portrayal of the archetypal Wall Streeter that many people think the film was based on true-life events. But here's the irony of political polarization in the USA: the same people who rave against Wall Street, who thoroughly believe that every broker and trader is another Gordon Gekko, are also the people who denounce Barack Obama's proposed regulations of banks and stock markets! and whose 'faith' in God-given free-market capitalism blindfolds them to the odious truth of Gordon Gekko's credo of selfishness.",5,"Yes, Little Pig, the Big Bad Wolf Does Eat Pork",1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,3081,"['Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'fictional', 'account', 'ruthless', 'criminal', 'insider', 'trading', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Little', 'Pig', 'young', 'financial', 'nobody', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Fox', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'who', 'lot', 'chutzpah', 'accidental', 'tip', 'father', 'hook', 'up', 'Gekko', 'whom', 'emulate', 'father', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'rarity', 'modern', 'America', 'honest', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'work', 'productively', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'year', '1985', 'Reagan', 'President', 'Greed', 'patriotic', 'Divinely', 'approved', 'stock', 'market', 'bullish', '2', '%', 'Americans', 'own', '50', '%', 'wealth', 'two-thirds', 'wealth', 'inherited', 'Money', 'according', 'Gekko', 'not', ""'made"", 'merely', 'transferred', 'who', 'have', ""'stuff"", 'same', ""'stuff"", 'see', 'young', 'Fox', 'will', 'course', 'betray', 'naive', 'protege', 'when', '.It', 'superb', 'acting', 'Douglas', 'Sheen', 'taut', 'directing', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'make', 'film', 'hugely', 'successful', 'drama', 'fairly', 'ethical', 'morass', 'high', 'finance', 'America', 'deplorable', 'failure', 'American', 'ideals', 'rather', 'unfairly', 'wizards', 'Wall', 'Street', 'who', 'revitalized', 'American', 'business', 'been', 'point', 'controversy', 'ever', 'film', 'first', 'appeared', 'Critics', 'have', 'derided', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'lefty', 'extremist', 'pursuing', 'anti-capitalist', 'agenda', 'be', 'viewers', 'discretion', 'warning', 'film', 'think', 'know', 'stock', 'market', 'what', 'hear', 'TV', 'radio', 'talk', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'qualified', 'judge', 'entertainment', 'believe', 'entertaining.Some', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'have', 'asserted', 'Gekko', 'character', 'was', 'based', 'real-life', 'figure', 'Michael', 'Milken', 'Junk', 'Bond', 'KIng', 'who', 'was', 'convicted', 'securities', 'fraud', 'result', 'investigation', 'insider', 'trading', '1989', 'Other', 'candidates', 'prototype', 'Gekko', 'include', 'disgraced', 'Ivan', 'Boesky', 'who', 'delivered', 'famous', 'speech', 'extolling', 'Greed', 'UC', 'Berkeley', '1986', 'who', 'lived', 'ideal', 'hilt', 'knew', 'Michael', 'Milken', 'personally', 'while', 'was', 'close', 'kin', 'in-law', 'wife', 'family', 'wife', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'other', 'Bar', 'Mitzvahs', 'decades', 'Michael', 'Milken', 'was', 'formidably', 'quick-minded', 'cool-headed', 'greed', 'was', 'handsome', 'steely-blue', 'menacing', 'Gekko', 'study', 'financial', 'concupiscence', 'however', 'Gekko', 'could', 'well', 'represent', 'Milken.And', 'now', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'remained', 'iconic', 'figure', 'plausible', 'portrayal', 'archetypal', 'Wall', 'Streeter', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'true-life', 'events', 'here', 'irony', 'political', 'polarization', 'USA', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'rave', 'Wall', 'Street', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'believe', 'broker', 'trader', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'are', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'denounce', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'proposed', 'regulations', 'banks', 'stock', 'markets', ""'faith"", 'God-given', 'free-market', 'capitalism', 'odious', 'truth', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'credo', 'selfishness']",N/A

Oliver Stone's father might have been a Wall Street broker, but he didn't seem to have explained the name of the game to his son.  At the end of the movie, the plot goes totally berserk, when investment banker Gekko, the character played by Michael Douglas, is sent to jail, charged for trading with insider information by the SEC !  This is absurd.  Greed has never been illegal.  And to make my point, I will put this into a historical context, illustrated by real-life examples :* In 1907 Morgan took advantage of a ""panic"" - orchestrated by New York banks - to take control of Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, buying this firm worth $ 700 million for only $ 30 million* During the Great Depression, the personal wealth of Joseph P. Kennedy rised from $ 4 million in 1929 to $ 100 million in 1935.  He was not the only one.  John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Bernard Baruch, Henry Morganthau, all those Wall Street - by lack of a better word - ""investors"" seemed somehow to be ""wise"" enough to get out of the stock market just before the Crash...* Just after the events of 9/11, we were informed that huge volumes of American Airlines stock were traded just before the events happened.  The SEC ""investigated"", and later ""classified"" everything !  Nice work, boys !* In 2008, the criminal bankers of Wall Street, after making billions of dollars with junk bonds, all of a sudden were considered ""too big to fail"".  Instead of being sent to jail, they first got $ 700 billion ""Main Street money"" courtesy of Bush, followed by $ 787 billion by the hoax changer Obama, in 2009.  And at this very moment, dollars are being flooded into the economy by the Fed, obliging other central banks in the world to buy them in order not to revaluate their own currencies too much.Let's never forget that the Fed is a privately owned organization.  To be more precise, owned by the Rockefeller and Morgan families, following the guidelines of ""mastermind"" Meyer Amschel Rothschild, who is claimed to have said : ""Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who writes the law"".  This puts Wall Street and the Law into *real* perspective.When partying, the power elite of Wall Street likes to make fun with the ignorance of Main Street.  When in 1863 the National Bank Act was voted in the US, Rothschild's investment firm in London sent a memo to an associated banker in New York, which stated : ""The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent upon its favors that there will be no opposition from that class while, on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending... will bear its burden without complaint.""That was in 1863.

243199,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,6301016289,Haunted Flower,"[0, 0]","Wallstreet was made in 1987 by writer and director Oliver Stone and starring Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen, Darryl Hannah, and John C. McGinley. A young stockbroker after months of persistence finally bags the big fish, Gordon Gekko, a man whose presence and lifestyle he idolizes. He shuns his blue collar background in pursuit of greed and impatiently engages in illegal insider trading.I first watched this movie after a book called ""Now Showing"" claimed it to be one of the best 25 movies....ever, I guess. I must say, all in all, it was a good movie. I actually really liked Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen's work in it and I believed their relationship. The pull of an actual father and son relationship really added to the authenticity of the roles. I finally got to see Michael Douglas just the way I like him -- being a bad guy, someone getting the best of him, and not seducing women.Michael Douglas plays a big Wallstreet player who has money falling out of his eyeballs and is idolized by Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox. Fox is taught to bend and eventually break the rules to get ahead and get that cold hard cash. This movie is all about greed. Douglas' character likes to buy out the majority of shares in a company and then liquidate it getting away with a quick buck. When Douglas gets going into a lengthy monologue, he oozes confidence which is amazing considering the pressure he was under. Bud Fox grows a conscience when he sells out his father's company to this same fate and decides to fight against it ruining everything he's worked for. This was one of those roles that really made Charlie Sheen stand out and become a celebrity in his own right and brought the extra challenges of that responsibility with it. There is an appearance by Darryl Hannah as random home decorating girlfriend who is very comfortable in her way of living and leaves Fox the first time it gets tough. I thought it would be more dramatic and more of a point of her being in the movie, but there really isn't and it ended up being a waste of screen time and just one more thing for him to lose on his fall from grace. She is a symbol of the rewards that can be earned by a fast way of living stepping on others and her substance is very shallow. Again I really loved seeing someone get the best of Michael Douglas, even if they couldn't get away scot-free and had to face the music. Shows the value of time, hard work, and morals over getting rich quick with some family values thrown in too.Probably an undervalued asset to this film is one of my favorites, John C. McGinley whom you'll remember as one of the Bob's from Office Space and his role of Dr. Cox on Scrubs. Always there to heckle and mock his good friend and has some of the best one-liners in the movie. Actually three of the main five lines people quote from this movie can all be attributed to this character he developed.This is especially a great movie for men and/or people who love business and stocks. This is one of my husband's all-time favorites and many men can quote it readily.DVD Extras:The first part of this review I wrote three years ago, but now I've gotten my hands on the 20th anniversary edition with special features and I want to gush about those for you. First, there is a new commentary by director, Oliver Stone. He is a precise fellow! Stories are told of how filming is going on and he isn't even looking through the camera, he is following along word for word in the script to make sure his actors don't miss a moment of his dialogue. Before Michael Douglas, Stone considered Warren Beatty and Richard Gere for the role of Gordon Gekko which both declined when the script was in an earlier form. Apparently Gere still wonders where his career would have gone if he had gotten the script that Michael Douglas got to shoot. Douglas had a heck of a time with the lines. There was so much to his monologues and dialogue and much was shot in long takes. When he finally put in the time and memorized his part better, he was able to put in the performance that was needed. The commentary reveals more behind-the-scenes information as well as Stone's apparently neurotic tendencies. So many times after a line is said, he commented on how so-and-so of some magazine or whatever complained about THAT line but why he justified it being important to the script. If he really was that confident behind each one, he probably wouldn't need to expain, right?Also, there are two featurettes: ""Greed is Good"" and ""Money Never Sleeps: The Making of Wallstreet"". Greed is Good focuses on what this movie meant to that audience in 1987 and how real brokers took it to heart and how some began to idolize Gekko as well and even asked Charlie Sheen to open accounts for them so they'd be able to say they had an account with Bud Fox. It's pretty entertaining to see how this became a bit of a bible and how every single day, this movie is quoted on the floor of the stock market. It is also brought up how tempting it is to try and take shortcuts in the business and what their field of work really means to brokers and their families. The Making of Wallstreet is based more in the behind-the-scenes information again and what it did for the careers of individual actors and what they struggled with. Darryl Hannah had issues with the development of her character and didn't believe women could be like that but Stone assured her that there are gold-diggers like that out there.The deleted scenes are minimal and don't seem to add much to the movie. But I'd say the commentary and featurettes are great for fans of this movie. If you like this movie, you should also check out ""Boiler Room"". It has VERY similar themes, cutting corners, a father/son dynamic, and the actors even quote entire scenes from ""Wallstreet.""With the sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps coming out on April 23rd this year, I'm very excited to see what has happened with Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko and his new protege played by Shia LaBeouf. Also Casey Mulligan who starred in one of this year's Best Picture nominees ""An Education"" will be making an appearance so I am looking forward to that!",5,Money Never Sleeps,1266796800,"02 22,

It is not a bad guy, he just follows the rules, bets and wins, so what is the point with that?The newcomer, Charlie Sheen is an idealist young man and his epci consists in twist the fate of this ambitious man who thinks he can move all the chess pieces without any risk.There is just one complaint of my own. Stone seems just to wash the face to the system he attacks, and somehow this restrained gaze weakens the structure of the script. The good customes and the honesty finally win the game but how long can you smile with this bizarre triumph? and even worst are you sure you can talk about ethics in such atmosphere. Wall Street means risk and failure, competence and disloyalty, no rules just basic instinct if you want to survive.There are many common places between this film and Donnie Brasco if you think it carefully. It is the figure of the experience against the youth idealism, but remember Hobbes and forget the innocence in the world. You may become as the central figure of Candide's Voltaire if you think the world is composed bu good and bad boys: the question is survive; no matter how high is the prize you pay by that.Michael Douglas made the best achievement of his career to date.

243202,A3NH7PYU4AD5GA,6301016289,H. Schneider,"[4, 5]","Stone has made a sequel to his modern classic film. Before watching the new one, I wanted to remind myself of the old one.It is as fresh as ever. Gordon Gekko is a treasure trove of wise statements on the nature of capitalism. His speech to the shareholder assembly where he attacks the thieving management is brilliant and I never heard a better version of combining satire and serious analysis.We all know the famous quote `Greed is good', but there is much more in it. I have never heard, so far, any voice that claimed that Gekko is not speaking plain, if self-serving truth. He is the personified damnation of a whole `profession': the locust in human shape. While nobody in his right mind will deny that the financial sector as a whole has an important part to play in modern society, it is equally obvious that Gekko's special branch of the financial industry is entirely destructive. It does not contribute, it is not after `win-win' situations, and it is pure robbery and warfare. Its philosophy is solidly based on zero sums: what we gain is your loss. Be a man and live with it!The usual argument in defense of these predators is that they play a sanitary role in keeping economic evolution healthy, in the way lions keep antelope herds fit and healthy. Of course there is a grain of truth in that, one can't deny that investment bankers are able to scare the living daylight out of thieving managements. But more often than doing good, these two bunches of criminals will gang up and siphon the juice out of honest shareholders and the work force. Whatever happened to the sane if illusionary concept of stakeholder interest? At about the time of Wall Street, in the best Reagan years, it got totally bowled out of the arena by a deceptive version of shareholder interest, whereby the robber barons assume the speaker role for all shareholders, the majority of whom is not able to follow the process and gets shortchanged.Of course in comparison to their successors in the 3rd millennium, good old Gekko's world during the Reagan years was nearly idyllic.(this review refers only to the film, not to this specific DVD)",5,"If you need a friend, buy a dog!",1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,2130,"['Stone', 'made', 'sequel', 'modern', 'classic', 'film', 'watching', 'new', 'one', 'wanted', 'remind', 'old', 'one.It', 'as', 'fresh', 'ever', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'treasure', 'trove', 'wise', 'statements', 'nature', 'capitalism', 'speech', 'shareholder', 'assembly', 'where', 'thieving', 'management', 'brilliant', 'never', 'heard', 'better', 'version', 'combining', 'satire', 'serious', 'analysis.We', 'know', 'famous', 'quote', 'Greed', 'good', 'much', 'more', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'so', 'far', 'voice', 'claimed', 'Gekko', 'not', 'speaking', 'plain', 'self-serving', 'truth', 'personified', 'damnation', 'whole', 'profession', 'locust', 'human', 'shape', 'nobody', 'right', 'mind', 'will', 'deny', 'financial', 'sector', 'whole', 'important', 'part', 'play', 'modern', 'society', 'equally', 'obvious', 'Gekko', 'special', 'branch', 'financial', 'industry', 'entirely', 'destructive', 'not', 'contribute', 'not', 'win-win', 'situations', 'pure', 'robbery', 'warfare', 'philosophy', 'solidly', 'based', 'zero', 'sums', 'what', 'gain', 'loss', 'Be', 'man', 'live', 'usual', 'argument', 'defense', 'predators', 'play', 'sanitary', 'role', 'keeping', 'economic', 'evolution', 'healthy', 'way', 'lions', 'keep', 'antelope', 'herds', 'fit', 'healthy', 'course', 'grain', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'investment', 'bankers', 'are', 'able', 'scare', 'living', 'daylight', 'thieving', 'managements', 'more', 'often', 'doing', 'good', 'two', 'bunches', 'criminals', 'will', 'gang', 'up', 'siphon', 'juice', 'honest', 'shareholders', 'work', 'force', 'happened', 'sane', 'illusionary', 'concept', 'stakeholder', 'interest', 'time', 'Wall', 'Street', 'best', 'Reagan', 'years', 'got', 'totally', 'bowled', 'arena', 'deceptive', 'version', 'shareholder', 'interest', 'whereby', 'robber', 'barons', 'assume', 'speaker', 'role', 'shareholders', 'majority', 'whom', 'not', 'able', 'follow', 'process', 'shortchanged.Of', 'course', 'comparison', 'successors', '3rd', 'millennium', 'good', 'old', 'Gekko', 'world', 'Reagan', 'years', 'was', 'nearly', 'idyllic', 'review', 'only', 'film', 'not', 'specific', 'DVD']",N/A

Here is the capitalism close-up, warts and all. And we loved it. In three more years the Soviet communism will be dismantled, free market hurriedly introduced, and some of my friends and fellow students will proceed to become very rich people themselves. I did not know then, that Gordon Gekko, a villain who incidentally was much admired by me, was a thinly veiled portrait of Ivan Boesky. Boesky, who incidentally was a son of Russian immigrants, became a center of the biggest insider trading scandal and government investigation in the 1980s, which let to the collapse of junk bond powerhouse firm Drexel Burnham. However, I knew that Gekko must be much more than a villain, otherwise how this ugly character could be so attractive? Of course, a huge part of it was a superb acting by Michael Douglas. But watching this film now, 17 years later, gave me an opportunity to ponder more on the subject from a different perspective. I think now that Gekko's character is archetypal and has the same qualities as Bulgakov's Woland from `Master and Margarita'. He is the Wall Street Mephistopheles, the Grand seducer, not just some greedy upstart and `faux bonhomme'. But one of the qualities of Lucifer is that he `brings out the light', he helps to illuminate things, partly because of his own darkness. Untimely, in the movie it was his turbulent encounter with Gekko, which helped Bud Fox to find his character and, in a way, redeem himself.

There is a slight touch of romanticism with the cover-girl, sorry home decorator. There is a little bit more feeling with the father, maybe because the father is playing the father and the son is playing the son, though it remains essentially business, in this case union business. Then there is nothing but buying and selling, owning and dumping, saving and killing, and the  game is only pleasant if it is always both together. To kill one by saving another and to buy one in order to make the other sell and then buy him out. Even the police and justice are used that way. I expose you to the police to humiliate you and have you arrested, but then you trap me for the police with a tape-recorder and you will get a rap on the fingers from the judge while I will get to prison. When you know that that I was the one who wanted to kill a certain company that that you decided to save by having it bought by the sworn enemy of that I, you understand what inside business and inside dealing and inside embezzling and inside anything you want means.

This film is maybe slightly too technical, but it is the way we are totally messed up in our lives by a bunch of psychopaths who have enough money to buy the federal government out of the federal reserve at Fort Knox, or vice versa, which might even be funnier.

""Wall Street"" bashes you over the head with its message- getting to the top in society requires duplicity, dishonesty, and the willingness to destroy any obstacle.  However, unlike Ayn Rand, Stone vilifies rather than lauds this dubious morality.  Bud Fox is a fresh faced, innocent stock broker trying to get ahead through hard work and elbow grease, as he was taught by his father.  Bud soon meets powerful, charismatic corporate raider Gordon Gekko, incapable of love, remorse, or empathy.  Gekko, we are told, sold NASA short 15 minutes after the Challenger exploded (impossible since the shuttle was destroyed in 1986 and the film is set in 1985!).  Gekko predictably seduces Bud with his world of ""perks"", and Bud's star rises dramatically the farther he falls into corruption.Throughout the film, Bud serves as a sounding board for the rival values of Gekko and his father.  The speech most cited by critics and fans is the immortal ""Greed is Good"" monologue.  While this speech, standing alone, is a vigorous defense of capitalism and selfishness, it is important to note that Gekko is using it at a shareholders' meeting against a lousy, entrenched, and greedy management!Inevitably, Bud is forced to decide whether to follow his father's philosophy or Gekko's, and to pay the price for his misdeeds.  A slight complaint with the ending- the fate of Gekko is hinted at rather than displayed.  Gordon Gekko has become something of a hero for young, wanna-be big shots, who are attracted to the glamour of his lifestyle and his &quot;up your's, I got mine!&quot; attitude much as Bud was.  Perhaps seeing Gekko get his comeuppance could have made an impression.Overall, Wall Street is a tight, well done character drama populated with iconic characters delivering iconic dialogue that acts as an indictment of a decade.  The movie and its message will stay with you long after viewing it.As for the DVD, the sound, although in 5.1, is relegated almost exclusively to the center channel.  One does not hear the sounds of Manhattan from all directions as Bud navigates the concrete jungle.  The video quality appears grainy in some areas.

He's a greedy SOB, but he works like a demon and built himself up from nothing.  His worldview was perfectly encapsulated in his shareholders speech in which he gave out the famous line ""Greed is good,"" and then explained why.You'd think the movie would be a bit dated by the technology and market environment displayed in this movie, but actually the change in times is interesting to observe, and the movie never grows dated because the story is relevant for all times.Another small detail that I couldn't help but love was the gigantic ""THE END"" words displayed before the end credits.

In WALL STREET the elder Sheen is an airline mechanic and union man to the cuffs of his coveralls who tries desperately to make his bedazzled son hold fast to bedrock blue-collar values.Although the ethics lesson is heavy-handed and obvious, WALL STREET's closing moral is satisfyingly vague and open to interpretation, giving this film an unintended depth that still draws audiences two decades later.Douglas's Gekko is the avaricious embodiment of the Gimme Decade, believing that, from start to finish as the great tagline to this movie says, ""Greed is good...Greed works."" Director Oliver Stone named Gekko after the infamous ""f.u. lizard"" of Vietnam, and it's an appropriate choice. Gekko, as the embodiment of a kind of ethical darkness, has much in common with APOCALYPSE...NOW's Colonel Kurtz (another Sheen vehicle). He is eminently piratical, dismembering companies, enemies and sexual conquests (Daryl Hannah plays the girl) gloatingly.Smudging the seemingly simple lines drawn in the sand, Douglas's Oscar-winning portrayal is so overwhelmingly powerful that it effectively capsizes the movie and inverts the lesson in ethics. The mesmerizing, beautifully polished Gekko, reeking of amorality, becomes a study in the Will to Power.Gekko, quite ironically, is The Man We All Want To Be. His strength however, comes less from within himself than from his ability to tap into the egocentric desires of others around him. Never promising anything, like a magician he demonstrates everything, exuding authority and certainty in that most uncertain and least authoritative of all universes, finance. Generations of MBAs, CFPs, and hungry young men of all stripes have seen WALL STREET as a McGuffey's Reader of sorts, providing a template for the look, tone, and attitude of success. Events have not proven them wrong.Even as the sycophants around him disgustingly reduce everything to a crude dollars-and-cents cost-benefit analysis (take note of Daryl Hannah's reaction to Gekko's tacky modern art collection), Gekko seems to be above it all. True, he exhibits the predatory instincts of an alley cat throughout the picture, but he is also undeniably alluring. Whether Douglas is portraying the hero or the villain of WALL STREET depends entirely on the viewer's perspective and mood.",5,"""I gave you your manhood!""",1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,2727,"['ambience', 'Reagan-era', 'stock', 'boom', 'captured', 'perfectly', 'iconic', 'film', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Charlie', 'Sheen.The', 'younger', 'Sheen', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'young', 'up-and-coming', 'stockbroker', 'who', 'way', 'heart', 'darkness', 'Wall', 'Street', 'mogul', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'Douglas', 'who', 'younger', 'man', 'lifestyle', 'stylish', 'excess.Martin', 'Sheen', 'Charlie', 'father', 'role', 'reprised', 'real', 'life', 'WALL', 'STREET', 'elder', 'Sheen', 'airline', 'mechanic', 'union', 'man', 'cuffs', 'coveralls', 'who', 'desperately', 'make', 'bedazzled', 'son', 'hold', 'fast', 'bedrock', 'blue-collar', 'ethics', 'lesson', 'heavy-handed', 'obvious', 'WALL', 'STREET', 'closing', 'moral', 'satisfyingly', 'vague', 'open', 'interpretation', 'giving', 'film', 'unintended', 'depth', 'still', 'audiences', 'two', 'decades', 'later.Douglas', 'Gekko', 'avaricious', 'embodiment', 'Gim', 'Decade', 'believing', 'start', 'finish', 'great', 'tagline', 'movie', 'Greed', 'good', 'Greed', 'Director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'named', 'Gekko', 'infamous', 'f.u', 'lizard', 'Vietnam', 'appropriate', 'choice', 'Gekko', 'embodiment', 'kind', 'ethical', 'darkness', 'much', 'common', 'APOCALYPSE', 'NOW', 'Colonel', 'Kurtz', 'Sheen', 'vehicle', 'eminently', 'piratical', 'dismembering', 'companies', 'enemies', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'girl', 'gloatingly.Smudging', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'lines', 'drawn', 'sand', 'Douglas', 'Oscar-winning', 'portrayal', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'powerful', 'effectively', 'movie', 'lesson', 'ethics', 'mesmerizing', 'beautifully', 'polished', 'Gekko', 'reeking', 'amorality', 'study', 'Will', 'Power.Gekko', 'quite', 'ironically', 'Man', 'Want', 'Be', 'strength', 'however', 'less', 'ability', 'tap', 'egocentric', 'desires', 'others', 'Never', 'promising', 'anything', 'magician', 'everything', 'exuding', 'authority', 'certainty', 'most', 'uncertain', 'least', 'authoritative', 'universes', 'finance', 'Generations', 'MBAs', 'CFPs', 'hungry', 'young', 'men', 'stripes', 'have', 'seen', 'WALL', 'STREET', 'McGuffey', 'Reader', 'sorts', 'providing', 'template', 'look', 'tone', 'attitude', 'success', 'Events', 'have', 'not', 'proven', 'wrong.Even', 'sycophants', 'disgustingly', 'reduce', 'everything', 'crude', 'dollars-and-cents', 'cost-benefit', 'analysis', 'take', 'note', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'reaction', 'Gekko', 'tacky', 'modern', 'art', 'collection', 'Gekko', 'be', 'True', 'predatory', 'instincts', 'alley', 'cat', 'picture', 'also', 'undeniably', 'alluring', 'Whether', 'Douglas', 'portraying', 'hero', 'villain', 'WALL', 'STREET', 'entirely', 'viewer', 'perspective', 'mood']",N/A

But then, Michael Douglas goes too far when he tries to take over the airline that Charlie's father works for and Charlie has a change of heart.

It is also a deja vu moment on steroids for the beginning of the 21st Century.  Greed and avarice versus human decency and the greater good is what the movie is about.Set in New York City, Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, a striving, ambitious stockbroker, doing cold calls for his firm.  Bud is from a blue-collar background who has a hard-working union boss father.  He has a deep loving respectful relationship with him.  Martin Sheen plays Carl, Bud's father (he is also Charlie Sheen's father in real life)Bud also admires and worships the success of Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), who has much success in corporate takeovers.  He is rich and powerful beyond the normal bounds of Bud's expectations.The story evolves to Bud being torn between two father figures, Gordon the Wall Street Wizard (""Greed is Good"") and Carl, his loving, kind and working class man.As Gordon takes Bud on as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, he shows him the ""moves"" that need to be done to get to the top.  Bud slowly but surely decides that this is much more fun than doing cold calls for his firm.  Lou Mannheim (Hal Holbrook), who works for Bud's firm, counsels him that easy money is a dream.  You work hard and diligent through good and bad times and that is what works.  Bud ignores the advice and stays in the fast lane, using inside information from his father as well as getting a job in night cleaning to go through other people's files for insider information.He moves up to an expensive apartment and a beautiful ambitious girlfriend to match (Darryl Hannah).  Gekko puts more and ore pressure on Bud to keep breaking the law of insider trading - and then undermine his union leader father, which will jeopardize his friend's jobs and lives, he can't do it.  Bud realizes that sleeping at night with a clear conscience is worth more than all the glitz and power money can buy.The movie has some bumps (Darryl Hannah's acting is awful as the girlfriend), but performances by Michael Douglas, Martin and Charlie Sheen make it riveting and a compelling watch.  The bittersweet twist is that we still see greed and hubris in top Wall Street and Banking firms.

McGinley) as they try to talk anyone into buying some stock or options or any financial vehicle so they can make a commission and pay the bills. Bud's father Carl (Martin Sheen, Charlie's father in real life) is not terribly happy that his son is a stockbroker; and he encourages Bud to give up being a ""salesman."" Moreover, some of the older, more mature stockbrokers like Lou (Hal Holbrook) adhere to the value of being patient to get ahead in life. But Bud is hungry--REALLY hungry--and he calls the famously wealthy Gordon Gekko 59 days in a row in order to get Gordon's business.Finally, Bud does get at least some of Gordon's business and with it comes ""perks"" including drugs and women. Unfortunately, it also draws Bud into a world where trades are based entirely on insider information which Bud knows is illegal. Bud's greed, however, is so great that he joins forces with Gekko and sticks with him to get as much as he can for himself. Gekko even sets Bud up with a woman Bud really begins to have feelings for; Darien Taylor (Daryl Hannah) was herself made rich by Gekko and Darien begins to return Bud's affection for her.The plot can go anywhere from here. Bud's father Carl works at Blue Star Airlines, a small carrier that was built up from the ground with hard work and honest values. Gekko, however, thinks that he and Bud can do a better job of running the airline--where might this lead? How will Bud's father Carl react to this? And what about Bud's loyalty to Gekko--will it always be there or will there eventually be a conflict of interest--and how might that play out? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!The 20th Anniversary Edition includes a second DVD with impressive bonus features. We get an optional audio commentary by co-writer and director Oliver Stone; a 60 minute  documentary about the film entitled ""Greed Is Good;"" a number of deleted scenes and a making of featurette entitled """"Money Never Sleeps: The Making of Wall Street."" Excellent!Wall Street is a powerful film that explores greed and the very high price that can be paid for living a life consumed by gluttony and materialism. This sent quite a strong message during the materialistic 1980s in America. This is definitely a morality film largely crafted by Oliver Stone; and it remains memorable after you watch it. It's not quite as stunning as Stone's movie ""Platoon"" but it succeeds very well without a doubt; and I highly recommend this film.",5,money makes you do things you don't want to do...,1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,3444,"['Wall', 'Street', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Stanley', 'Weiser', 'when', 'say', 'casting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'mean', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'particular', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'villain', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'should', 'be', 'heaps', 'praise', 'very', 'day', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'overeager', 'make', 'money', 'stockbroker', 'who', 'be', 'corrupted', 'Gekko', 'sake', 'almighty', 'dollar', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'cinematography', 'was', 'excellent', 'quality', 'print', 'superlative', 'get', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'bonus', 'disc', 'plethora', 'extras', 'When', 'action', 'meet', 'people', 'stock', 'brokerage', 'film', 'younger', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'fewer', 'accounts', 'who', 'need', 'build', 'up', 'client', 'base', 'work', 'mayhem', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'pit', 'real', 'life', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'meet', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'buddy', 'Marvin', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'try', 'talk', 'anyone', 'buying', 'stock', 'options', 'financial', 'vehicle', 'can', 'make', 'commission', 'pay', 'bills', 'Bud', 'father', 'Carl', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Charlie', 'father', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'terribly', 'happy', 'son', 'stockbroker', 'Bud', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'salesman', 'Moreover', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'stockbrokers', 'Lou', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'adhere', 'value', 'being', 'patient', 'get', 'ahead', 'life', 'Bud', 'hungry', 'REALLY', 'hungry', 'famously', 'wealthy', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', '59', 'days', 'row', 'order', 'get', 'Gordon', 'business.Finally', 'Bud', 'get', 'least', 'Gordon', 'business', 'perks', 'including', 'drugs', 'women', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'Bud', 'world', 'where', 'trades', 'are', 'based', 'entirely', 'insider', 'information', 'Bud', 'illegal', 'Bud', 'greed', 'however', 'so', 'great', 'forces', 'Gekko', 'sticks', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'Gekko', 'even', 'Bud', 'up', 'woman', 'Bud', 'really', 'have', 'feelings', 'Darien', 'Taylor', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'was', 'made', 'rich', 'Gekko', 'Darien', 'return', 'Bud', 'affection', 'her.The', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'Bud', 'father', 'Carl', 'Blue', 'Star', 'Airlines', 'small', 'carrier', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'ground', 'hard', 'work', 'honest', 'values', 'Gekko', 'however', 'Bud', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'running', 'airline', 'where', 'might', 'lead', 'How', 'will', 'Bud', 'father', 'Carl', 'react', 'what', 'Bud', 'loyalty', 'Gekko', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'conflict', 'interest', 'how', 'might', 'play', 'out', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'watch', 'find', 'out', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'second', 'DVD', 'impressive', 'bonus', 'features', 'get', 'optional', 'audio', 'commentary', 'co-writer', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', '60', 'minute', 'documentary', 'film', 'entitled', 'Greed', 'Good', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'Making', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Excellent', 'Wall', 'Street', 'powerful', 'film', 'greed', 'very', 'high', 'price', 'can', 'be', 'paid', 'living', 'life', 'consumed', 'gluttony', 'materialism', 'sent', 'quite', 'strong', 'message', 'materialistic', '1980s', 'America', 'definitely', 'morality', 'film', 'largely', 'crafted', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'memorable', 'watch', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'stunning', 'Stone', 'movie', 'Platoon', 'very', 'well', 'doubt', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

Though I have been a fan of Michael Douglas for some time, it seems strange that he won an Oscar for a film in which he has little real screen time.  Most of the movie focuses on Charlie Sheen's character, and even though Douglas is perfect in the role of Gordon Gekko, I wasn't overwhelmed by his performance.  He won that year over William Hurt (Broadcast News); Marcello Mastroianni (Dark Eyes), Jack Nicholson (Ironweed) and Robin Williams (Good Morning Vietnam).  Assuredly, Douglas embodied the corporate greed of Gekko, but it is ultimately a one note performance, without any shadings of real personality.  Charlie, meanwhile, in one of his first major roles, is only about 50% effective, and his power comes in the scenes he shares with his father, Martin, who played his father in the film.  There are nice supporting turns from James Karen as the duplicitous sales manager; John C. McGinley as Charlie's sometime buddy broker; Terence Stamp as Gekko's British rival; James Spader as a yuppie lawyer; and of course Martin as Charlie's father whom he betrays.  Daryl Hannah is awful in a one-note role as Douglas' ex-mistress and Sheen's current honey.  Sixties ingenue Millie Perkins has an all too brief cameo as Charlie's mother in the final ten minutes of the movie.Oliver Stone's movies have always been provocative and WALL STREET is no different.  But I have always found myself disturbed by his movies in that they are not the most ""entertaining"" of films; there's always a message, and this time, the one that ""greed is good"" just doesn't fill the bill for me.

The only problem is that he is stuck in a job that consists of cold calling investors over the phone. Wanting something more, he seeks out the highly successful financial wiz Gordon Gecko ( Michael Douglas). Gecko sees a younger version of himself with Bud, and takes him under his wing. However, the road to success, is not always paved with honesty. Bud is immediately lured by Gordon, into the world of corporate epsionage and insider trading. Bud starts to make more money than he ever dreamed was possible. But he soon learns that the pursuit of overnight riches comes at a price that is too high to pay.Wall Street takes us into the world of the stock market and insider trading. It is definately Oliver Stone's best film, and one of the best that I have ever seen overall. No matter how many times you see this movie, it never gets boring, or seems any less amazing. Michael Douglas offers one of the most memorable lines of all time with &quot;Greed is good&quot;. This is the driving force for the film. This perhaps, is the film's best feature because the story is so authentic. Stone manages to fully capture all of the glory that Wall Street can bring, and the misery that it can cause.Of course, you need talented actors to make it convincing. Michael Douglas gives the best role of his career as Gordon Gecko. In fact, he won an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. It is that good. Gordon is a man that is ruled by greed, and is completely ruthless. That is why Charlie Sheen's portrayal of Bud Fox plays so well off of Douglas. Sheen is young, ambitious, and also extremely naive. He is the puppet, and Gecko is the puppeteer. Martin Sheen delivers an extremely solid role as Bud's father Carl. I loved the fact that Martin Sheen got the role, because only a real father could bring such a realistic portrayal of love. There are other great actors as well in this film, and they include Hal Halbrook, John C McGinley, Daryl Hannah, and Terrance Stamp.Wall Street is a classic story dealing with ambition, greed, and betrayal. The story is extremely authentic, all of the acting is superb, and the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat. The DVD extras are nice too.

It was just as enjoyable as it was the first time around.In this movie, ambitious stock broker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) finally hooks up with Wall Street shark Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) to make easy money, and lots of it quickly.  Gekko accomplishes his goals by buying companies and splitting them up, and by collecting insider information from people around him.  At some point Bud Fox finds himself at odds with his father who believes in making a living the good old-fashioned way, by working hard and becoming useful.The premise of this movie is that the greed is good in all its shapes and forms as disclosed in a speech by Gekko at the height of the story.  Well, I don't know about you, but I disagree with that proposition.  Greed is like anything else: a good motivator in moderation, but very destructive in excess.

If you think the trader talk will be over your head it won't, Stone makes it pretty understandable and puts much leverage on the characters decisions to keep it juicy. Win or go home. Another brilliant thing Oliver Stone did was putting the father and son at odds with their career choices, this keeps the film relatable.

243251,A3TBM91S4SP0MS,6301016289,Paulo Andre,"[4, 5]","It seems to me there's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era. I'm not arguing it's either better or worse than others, it just feels different and very distinctive. In this light, ""Wall Street"" reminded me vividly of ""No Way Out"" for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several De Palma films. Don't ask me why. It just does.Useless considerations apart, ""Wall Street"", directed by always controversial Oliver Stone, pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away. They always burn out, in a snap of fingers. And bigger they are, harder they fall, right?The story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen, featuring a bright young ""sport"", Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life. He wants more, and hotshot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful, vicious, influential and a sure winner. By sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence, Bud sneaks into Gekko's office and tries to prove his value to him. From here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young proteg&eacute; who rises to the top at breakneck speed until, unexpectedly, something shatters his bond to the master. Something that hits home and makes Bud question his beliefs. What this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie, so I'll let that for you to find out if you didn't see it yet.All the acting is quite superb, especially the relationship between Gekko and Fox. Martin Sheen - who is Charlie Sheen's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work, not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down. He reminds me of Donald Sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he's on screen a couple of minutes at a time.If you like high finance intrigue, big guys pulling the strings on each other, twists and turns, then ""Wall Street"" is probably essential.

243252,ADE852UR9121C,6301016289,perfecto,"[6, 6]","Few movies capture the mind and heart as this movie. It is basically about Bud Fox, a sales manager in Wall Street. He deals mostly low-key shares and he is aiming for the big time. He seeks the opportunity to work with Gordon Gecko, a multi-billionaire investor who is smart as he is ruthless. Meanwhile, Bud Fox is also facing his father's criticism about what he does for a living...""Create, instead of living off the buying and selling of other people's money"", his father says. I admit, I am addicted to this movie. Every few months, I have to slot in the DVD and watch it. It is a delight to watch every single time. This movie deals with many important and all too real issues. Everybody wants to be rich, but how far would you go to achieve that goal? Is it worth betraying the people you love? Changing your morals and values in life? And when you do make it big, who can you trust? How sure are you? These are just some of the elements Oliver Stone delved into in this movie. Using Wall Street and the share market as his backdrop, he has created a masterpiece.The first thing that immediately grabs you is the acting. Superb performances from some of the most talented but often misused actors in Hollywood. Michael Douglas has always been one of my favourite actors and in this movie, he IS Gordon Gecko. He is the epitome of corporate power. The way he speaks, and acts....classic stuff. One of my favourite scenes, is when he gives the speech during the shareholder meeting of Teldar Paper. Unbelievably good! He won a truly deserving Oscar for his portrayal of Gecko. Because of Douglas' fantastic acting, it tends to overshadow another actor who is as deserving of praise, Charlie Sheen. To be honest, I am not a fan of Charlie Sheen and found his acting mediocre in many movies, which was why I was pleasantly surprised with his acting here. He was really very good as Bud Fox, looking up to Gecko as his mentor, never overacting and having the coolness to pull off lines like ""You get out that door, I'm changing the locks"". He plays the part of a young man not knowing exactly what he wants in life once he achieved his idea of success perfectly. And the supporting cast, Martin Sheen (playing Bud Fox's dad with pure emotion, it seems like he's saying what he really means to his son) and Darryl Hannah (as Bud Fox's love interest) does not disappoint.Kudos to Oliver Stone for writing such a powerful script. This is not the usual garbage Hollywood likes to dump us with...this is a brilliant screenplay with great dialogue. ""Greed will not only save Teldar Papers, but that other malfunctioning corporation known as the United States"", Gecko says. Heck, even at home, I felt like giving a standing ovation to that. And the camera angles were also something I found fascinating in this movie. For example, when we're first shown Gecko, we don't get to see him immediately. Oliver Stone teases us with a Fortune magazine cover, and then by a shot of his office, when someone enters his office, the door opens and closes just enough time so that we get a glimpse of Gecko and hear his voice but never really getting a good look of him, right until Bud Fox meets with him. And towards the end, when things go wrong, a dark shadow falls upon the office. Beautiful!Honestly, everything about this movie seems to work perfectly, which is why the 5-star rating. This is one of my all-time favourites and I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you're involved in the share market or not, because the scope of this movie extends to so much more than that, that I'm sure different people would appreciate it on different levels.

Although it is marred by the inclusion of too much gratuitous profanity, the film is noteworthy for several fine acting performances. Michael Douglas is superb as the greedy and ruthless Gordon Gekko. Charlie and Martin Sheen are both convincing as the neophyte stockbroker and the principled union boss respectively. As usual Hal Holbrook rises above the crowd with his sympathetic portrayal of the dissillusioned older broker.

Martin Sheen was good as the quintessential good guy.  Charlie Sheen is the son, vacillating between the two, like Faust, wondering if he should sell his soul to the Devil or not.  Well, he does and, if he had been played by a better actor, we might care.  Perhaps Charlie has matured as an actor since this debut performance; I don't know because I've never seen him in anything since.  However here he is terrible.  I suspect that if he had not been his father's son, he never would have made it in the business.  I only wonder how such a good actor as Martin could have spawned such a bad actor as Charlie.

Prior to the early 1980s the Dow Jones Industrial Average had been rangebound between about 600 and 1000.  Suddenly it took off towards 2000 and never stopped.  Fortunes were made and lost. Corporations rose and fell.  Capitalism's ""creative destruction"" was in full swing.  When it was over, we had created the world we live in today.  In this film Michael Douglas plays corporate raider and greenmailer Gordon Gekko.  Budd Fox (Charlie Sheen) is a motivated young stockbroker who falls into Gekko's orbit with its promise of big money, beautiful women, and all the power that big money brings.  The only catch is, for Budd Fox this required him to engage in insider trading and selling out the company that his father works for.This film includes numerous memorable scenes that have passed into folklore.  Gordon Gekko's ""Greed is Good!"" speech at a stockholder's meeting is a classic--brutal -- but it is also true, and more or less explains the competitive nature of capitalism.  Michael Douglas won a well-deserved Academy Award for his portrayal of the amoral and immoral Gordon Gekko.  Gekko has not only lost all sense of morality, but he has crossed the line and in the film he is systematically violating the law for stock market gains.""Wall Street"" is a cautionary tale about losing sight of morality for money.  As such, it succeeds in conveying its message while at the same time being hugely entertaining.  Michael Douglas turns in a fantastic performance as Gordon Gekko, and Charlie Sheen is superb as Budd Fox.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent.

243269,AOFC8T8U7WUGV,6301016289,Roland,"[1, 1]","Yet another movie that I would watch bits and pieces of on cable--before finally getting around to viewing in its entirety--Oliver Stone's Wall Street is one of the finest movies, arguably the finest, that I have ever seen.--Spoilers Ahead--Wall Street opens beautifully with montages of Manhattan ""waking up"" to a golden, sunny morning--Frank Sinatra singing in the back ground. How can you beat that? It stars Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox (youthful; growing/sly as a), a young twenty-something who has chosen to by-pass law school in the hopes of making it big on Wall Street.Working at Jackson Steinham & Co., Fox spends his workdays cold-calling potential clients (Fox has a list of wealthy doctors, lawyers, etc--and ""cold-calls"" them, out of the blue, hoping to sell them huge blocks of stock which he believes will be the ""next big thing"").Oh yeah, there is another thing Bud does every workday: he calls up the already legendary Wall Street ""player,"" Gordon Gekko (lizard), portrayed by one of my favorite actors: Michael Douglas.Bud is hoping to get ""just ten minutes of"" Gekko's time. After yet another turn-down, he laments to his co-worker pal Marv (John C. McGinley), that one day he wants to be the guy on the other end of that phone. ""Don't we all,"" Marv replies, adding that ""the Gekkos don't talk to the nobodies such as us.""Fortunately (or unfortunately) Bud isn't one to easily be dissuaded.On Gordon Gekko's birthday, Bud, handsome young man that he is, charms his way through Gekko's office--and personal secretary--and manages to get himself a meeting with Gekko. It doesn't hurt that he has brought along a birthday present: some Havana cigars (Gordon's favorites).Before entering Gordon's immense, intimidating inner sanctum, Fox adjusts his tie, takes a very deep breath, and says: ""Life comes down to a few moments--this is one of them.""He then proceeds to totally mess up. Having initially impressed Gekko with his persistence, he stammers on about being ""a fan"" and tries to sell him on some boring, going absolutely nowhere, stocks. Sensing that he is about to blow the whole deal, Bud lets slip some insider information: Bluestar Airlines is about to win a lawsuit and is in the process of setting itself up to become a major player in the airline industry. His father, Carl, played by real-life father, Martin Sheen, has given him this information innocently--Carl Fox is the chief mechanic, and union rep, at Bluestar.Gekko pounces on this information and uses it to his HUGE advantage. He also decides to use Bud for his own personal advantage, too. Seducing him with dreams of wealth, power, drugs and beautiful women--one in particular, interior designer Darien Taylor (Daryl Hannah)--whom Bud falls head-over-heels for--Gekko gets Bud to secure insider information for him...particularly inside information concerning one Sir Lawrence Wildman (Terence Stamp)--a corporate raider with a lot more wealth and power than Gekko, himself.It seems Sir Larry stole a pharmaceutical company out from GG's nose a (not too long) while back. Gordon loathes him.Bud is quite successful in his role. He does gain some insider info that Gekko is able to use to ""hurt"" Wildman (more embarrass than hurt, actually, but I digress...). Bud also gets a promotion at work--including his own office; a new, luxurious apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side; and fantastic sex every night with his new, gorgeous ""girlfriend"" (actually, Darien Taylor is yet just another one of Gordon Gekko's pawns).Bud even decides to help make his old law school friend, Roger Barnes (James Spader) rich with his newfound knowledge--all the while trying to gain inside information from him, too!Yeah, Bud has completely gone off of the deep end....and it all starts to crash down around him.Bud wants Gordon to gain control of Bluestar Airlines and let him (Bud) run it. Gordon, however, wants to trash the airline and soak all the remaining stock money out of it that he can.  To Bud's face, he goes along with his plan (while all the time twisting the knife).Even worse, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is starting to get wise to Bud's schemes. They start ""sniffing around"" Bud so much that Roger Barnes tells him to stay away.The worst, however, hits when Carl (at a Bluestar/Gekko/Bud meeting) tells Bud (in front of Gekko, no less) that the whole ""benevolent takeover"" is a fraud--and even if it isn't, how does ""working summers in baggage"" qualify Bud to be Bluestar's president? This leads to a father/son blow-up, and shortly afterwards Carl suffers a (non-fatal) heart attack.In addition to his father's heart attack, Bud has also (now) found out about Gordon's betrayal; his relationship with Darien ends when she refuses to stand with him against Gekko; (and) he is forced to sell his apartment.In a great scene, a world-weary Bud Fox, realizing what he has (or almost has) become, leans against a tree in downtown New York. A tree that is the only ""real"" thing, amid a fantasy world of kitsch and glamor, that has supported him in the past few fantastic, wonderful, and ultimately horrible, months. Great job of symbolism here by director Oliver Stone.Bud hatches a scheme to save Bluestar. Turning to Larry Wildman of all people, he gets him to agree to save Bluestar in exchange for an iron-clad contactual promise he won't destroy it. Wildman buys up all of Bluestar's stock, right from under Gekko's nose, and gains a (quite) financially viable airline, while at the same time making Gordon Gekko look like a fool.Yes, (Sir) Larry Wildman wins.Bud does not.Gekko sells out Bud Fox to the SEC, and he gets arrested--at work, of all places, and is humiliated in front of everyone. However, Bud then proceeds to ""sell out"" (if you can call it that) Gordon Gekko, wearing a wire and getting GG to admit to his illegal ways of doing business. Gekko will have to ultimately settle for a couple of (well-placed) punches to Bud Fox's face as the only ""victory"" he is going to claim in this movie. He is about to go to jail. For a very long time.Bud is, too, but at least it won't be for long--most likely, less than a year. Driven to the courthouse by his parents, Carl tells Bud that ""maybe this is for the best."" That now Bud can get the foolishness out of his life and go on from here to make something of himself. The real--not the fantasy--way.The movie ends with Bud Fox walking up the courthouse on a gray, dreary, winterish day. Great shot; even greater symbolism.My thoughts on this fantastic movie in a moment, but let me first go over the dvd'sSpecial FeaturesDisc One--The dvd contains an excellent commentary track by director Oliver Stone. It is literally Film-making 101 for any aspiring, would-be, directors out there. And, it is highly entertaining in its own right. If you like this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch it at least once with the commentary own. Stone gives away a wealth of added information to go along with your (regular movie) viewing experience.Disc Two--There are two excellent documentaries found here. One is entitled Money Never Sleeps-The Making of Wall Street. The other  is Greed is Good. Both documentaries add even more to your viewing experience. Money goes into great detail about WS's casting: Michael Douglas was not the first choice for the role of Gordon Gekko--Warren Beatty and Richard Gere were the actors first considered for the part. The fact that Wall Street was released shortly after the Stock Market Crash of 1987, was in no way an attempt to capitalize on tragedy. Stone discusses that the movie had already been show and had its release date set well before Black Monday occurred.Greed is Good talks about the movie's themes and touches on the fact that Gordon Gekko is actually considered a role model for many aspiring Wall Street players. The documentary contains interviews with several real-life Wall Street players, and they discuss why and how the fictional character of Gordon Gekko inspired them to do what they are doing (or hope to be doing). Is Gordon Gekko really an evil person? This is discussed in lengthy detail.There are also deleted scenes and a nice movie introduction by Oliver Stone, himself.My Thoughts*To begin, the movie is excellent. As I already have said, it is arguably the best movie I have ever seen--it is definitely on the short list. I should add that I have never had any interest in the stock market, MBAs, or business, itself...at least, no interest in pursuing any kind of career at all in this field. Yet, this is one of my favorite movies--so that in itself speaks volumes of what an excellent, entertaining movie this is.*Please allow me to also add that the first time I showed this movie to my fiancee--an artist, with no interest in business, either--as soon as the film was over, she pulled Disc Two out and watched both of its documentaries. She liked this movie that much!*I love the ""feel"" of this movie. It screams New York, Manhattan and the 1980s all over. I love this. While this movie should not be defined as a ""1980s movie"" it does excellently capture...from the hair, to the fashions...to the everything...just the entire essence of the 1980s in the City. Again, I love this!*Gordon Gekko has some great quotes:(Speaking about a rival) ""The guy is such a loser, if he owned funeral parlors, nobody would die!""""Greed is good.""  The film's iconic line. This line is delivered at a stockholder's meeting that Gordon Gekko, along with Bud and Darien, attends. Gekko is in the process of taking this company over, and in front of the large assembly, he totally humiliates the company's president (Richard Dysart-the ""funeral parlor guy""), whose only response is to call Gekko ""greedy"" and ""out of line.""  Gekko responds with a discourse on how we live by our own greed for things in life: love (which is ironic, considering just a few scenes earlier he told Darien that he and she were too smart to believe in ""anything such as love""), wealth, happiness...and concludes with, ""Greed, for lack of a better term, is good.""""If you want a friend, get a dog.""(Hysterically angry after learning he has been ""betrayed""--he does not yet know it is Bud who betrayed him) ""I will tear his eyeballs out. I will suck his f***ing skull!""Wow.And, not so much a quote, but early on in the film GG gives Bud an ultimatum: you are either with me (as a industrial spy) or not. Fox bites, and Gordon Gekko, peering out through the open window of his limousine, gives the most wickedly evil and charming smile you could ever hope to see.*You do know, don't you, that Michael Douglas won the 1987 Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Gordon Gekko? I thought so.*Not so much a ""thought"" but I want to mention that this movie's excellent cast also includes: Sean Young, Franklin Cover, Saul Rubinek, Tamara Tunie and Hal Holbrook as Lou Mannheim.Mannheim, based on Oliver Stone's father, works with Bud Fox at Jackson Steinham & Co. and provides reason and conscience (along with Carl Fox) to Bud throughout the movie. In particular, right before Bud is arrested by the SEC, he pulls Bud aside and tells him (putting his arm around him) that he ""likes him."" And that: ""Man looks in the abyss. There's nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character, and that is what keeps him out of the abyss.""*It is nice to see this movie's ""wisdom"" come from Bud's father and Mr. Mannheim. Two ""Everyman"" type characters--and not the characters with all of the wealth and power.FinallyAn irony of this movie is that, while Gekko is the ""villain"" and Wildman is the ""hero"" who helps save the day...their roles could easily be reversed. Gekko has, no doubt, bought businesses in the past--to rebuild--and will no doubt (once he gets out of jail) do so again in the future.  Wildman, has bought (and--I'm certain--will continue to do so) businesses simply to shut them down.  He's also played fast and loose with the rules--he stole the aforementioned pharmaceutical company from Gekko by bribing one of GG's secretaries for inside info.  The difference between these two men is: Gekko, in this movie, does not have any qualms in using/seducing Bud Fox to do his bidding.  Whether Wildman would do the same...well, we aren't told.Furthermore, I do believe that Gordon Gekko's character does like Bud Fox. I believe GG sees a younger version of himself. Perhaps he sees his own youthful self--before he became corrupt--and deep-down likes that...who knows?Finally, I do not, as some apparently do, see Wall Street as anti-American, or even anti-capitalism. It does rail against capitalism out-of-control: ""Greed is good,"" etc, etc. And, I do agree with this particular sentiment, which reminds me of Theodore Dreiser's short story, A Deal in Wheat. However, anything taken to the extreme level is certainly never, ever good...and, considering capitalism is our system--I am glad we have warnings such as this out there, firmly in place. It is not right to profit off of the misfortunes of others. That is, in my estimation, what this movie is about: a condemnation of a particular form of capitalism, but certainly not anti-American propaganda.If only this film was required viewing for all of our elected officials.Thank you for reading.Wall StreetReleased in 1987 by 20th Century Fox; Directed by Oliver Stone126 minutes; Rated R for strong language, drug usage, sexual situations and

He also learns there are some rather unscrupulous and unethical ways to get ahead as well and his inner conflict is what brings this film to a head. This has a good cast of established actors (which includes Charlie Sheens real life father, Martin Sheen, whom plays his dad), as well as many future up an coming stars and you even get a brief cameo from Oliver Stone, who is the director, as another stock broker.

243279,A1PPD5TOR6VVYV,6301016289,S Smyth,"[0, 0]","Wall Street is a remarkably good looking movie. The mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and mise-en-shot are irrefutably of a calibre that is well beyond that of the metteur-en-sc&egrave;ne and puts Olive Stone firmly in the category of a movie auteur who provides the ""rising tide that lifts all boats"" (director's commentary).  The acting by Michael Douglas , Charlie Sheen, Terence Stamp, Daryl Hannah,  Sean Young  and James Spader is consistently excellent. The good guys win.  Bud Fox experiences redemption via which, and jail time,  he avoids the moral abyss. Gordon Gecko (bad-guy-in-chief) goes to jail.  And thus, on these levels, Wall Street is a winner on all counts.  However, upon reflection, this movie is the moral abyss.The only winner in this drama, is the government. Which makes Oliver Stone, a more skilful minister of propaganda, than Joseph Goebels or Vyacheslav Molotov. A master eiron, given Oliver Stone's  (self-propagated, for the most part)  popular image as a warrior against big and interventionist government.  So, where did it all go wrong? Well . . . It all went wrong at the time when Bud Fox chose to back the losing side. Instead of negotiating a better cut of the action with Gordon Gecko, over his change of mind about Blue Star Airlines, Bud Fox chose to double-cross Gordon Gecko. If Bud Fox had chosen more wisely, he could have walked away with millions, given his father a million or two, which his father, directly or indirectly, could have used to help out his buddies while they looked for other work.  But by not doing this, the Blue Star Airline workers were still out of job; Gordon Gecko and Bud Fox went to jail; the inherited wealth had fewer alternatives to make money, by doing nothing;  and the government won.To be fair, though, and as an irony in itself:  If Oliver Stone had wanted to make Wall Street as this kind of a more rational movie, it would probably have net with a very cool reception, at the US box office.

Whenever we see stockbrokers depicted on the screen, it appears to be utter chaos. Screens show numbers, people shout and make frantic phone calls, and we discern from their reactions whether they made money or not.Wall Street overcomes some of the limitations of the subject matter by giving us well-acted characters that we care about. Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) begins the story as a struggling broker who hopes to one day make a phone call that will change his life. Most of his potential clients aren't in a position to do that, but one is.Gordon Gekko (Douglas) doesn't waste a second of his time when he's working, and he's usually working. After calling for 59 days straight, Bud delivers a box of Cuban cigars on Gekko's birthday and is given five minutes to convince him that he can help the man make money. He doesn't really hold Gekko's attention, but uses a desperate ploy before he is thrown out. Bud's father, Carl (Martin Sheen), works for Bluestar Airlines and has given Bud information about the company which will result in the price of the stock rising. Gekko decides to take a chance and Bud is hired.It soon becomes clear to Gekko that Bud had inside information. He tells him that he doesn't like to lose and he'll need similar information in the future if he's to keep him around. Bud has a decision to make. Does he try to work ethically and within the law, or take a chance and do what Gekko asks? This is a story of greed and corruption and we see Bud take the latter option. He follows around another investor in an attempt to find out what company the man might be trying to buy. The information is useful to Gekko and he makes a fortune.Bud's life will never be the same. He's finally on a path that will result in him becoming a major player. He begins spending money on a new apartment and artwork which reflects his success. He also starts a relationship with a woman who would normally have been beyond his reach. We see what money and success can do to a person. Previous relationships are harmed or completely abandoned. His father is an ethical man and is particularly hurt by Bud's actions. Despite warnings from some of his colleagues, Bud ruthlessly pursues success.Will Bud achieve his dream and stay one step ahead of the law? Can he continue to provide Gekko with enough relevant information? Will he prove his father and work colleagues wrong?Charlie Sheen is convincing as Bud, but the real highlight of the film is the Oscar-winning performance from Michael Douglas. He exudes power and gives the impression that he doesn't tolerate failure in any form. He's a brilliant public speaker and easily wins the support of companies he's taking over, even if he means to destroy them.It's very strange seeing images of the twin towers in older films and it's a little sobering to see them here. There are a few other things which date the film and the funniest change has to be the differences in technology. Take a look at the computer screens without laughing or at cell phones the size of a brick.I always take note when a film holds my interest with subject matter that I usually find boring.

243286,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,6301016289,Thomas Glebe,"[4, 5]","Oliver Stone is one of my favorite ""Hollywood"" filmmakers, and I have enjoyed many of his movies over time.  While I haven't seen a few of his works, he has given more than his share of fine cinema from his beginnings, and I count ""Platoon,"" ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" ""JFK,"" and ""Nixon"" as among his better efforts, and I applaud and repeatedly watch parts of all of these.  However, to me, Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" is, overall, his best.For one thing, it avoids a lot of the overlength and filler in many of his other films, as well as his sometimes uncomfortable mixture of fact and fiction/speculation.  ""Wall Street"" is pretty much a standard length and mainstream studio production, and while, as in almost all Stone films, it has a message to preach, in this one, he goes for a much lighter, more obscure, and subtle but just as powerful approach.  And while this is fiction, and does not really deal with actual known historical or present-day people, the message here, both moral and profound, seems as timely these days as when the movie was first released in the 80's.  That ""morality"" message posits that pursuit of profits and materialistic riches above any/most other considerations, especially above individual human integrity and decency, is an eventually losing proposition for any truly decent, thinking person, with true integrity.Being a more ""conventional"" film, the ""morality message"" here may pass way over a lot of people's heads, especially those Oliver Stone haters who've never seen this and/or who are automatically turned off to any Oliver Stone effort, but the message remains Stone's most powerful, if obscure.  And this is a must see, and Stone's overall best movie.Charlie Sheen, (and to a lesser extent, his real life father and cinematic icon Martin Sheen, who amazingly enough plays the main character's real life father), as well as an outstanding performance by oscar-winning Michael Douglas, and other acting gems, as well as a fast-pace, little filler, linear plot and execution, add up to something really special.The junior Sheen plays an up and coming and hoping, Wall Street, poor, ""player"" wannabe, who works as a going nowhere fast financial investments seller within the legal stock market system, whose main goal is to get close to one of the real players in the American financial market.  After much effort, he finally and with dogged persistence, gets a short ""meeting"" with an all powerful, super-rich, almost legendary established player in the form of Michael Douglas.Selling his soul early on, ""Bud"" (Charlie Sheen) soon begins to throw aside all of his roots and basic decent, moral upbringings, as well as the fate of his father and many decent working folks, in order to happily fall under the spell of his sociopathic leader/teacher (Gordon Gekko - Douglas), and enjoys enormous financial ""success"" within the philosophy of his indecent mentor.  For awhile, the almost religious mantra of Gekko's ""greed is good"" more than succeeds, but for a short time only.Before long, Sheen finds himself in a swank upper-east side Manhattan apartment, with money and the company of a beautiful, intelligent, but shallow girl (the best that can be bought), and sees a promising future as a true Wall Street player and wealthy corporate parasite. Trouble is, he loses his soul and moral fiber somewhere along the way, and realizes that for all his material gains, he has hurt the real people closest to him, and has betrayed them and his own self as well.While Oliver Stone could've resolved and ended the film in a way he might've these days (strangely and sadly and even more so the same as it ever was concerning rich versus poor, haves versus have-nots, etc.), when corporate interests and money hunger rules over substance, he gives us instead a character who finally and deeply realizes the evil he has helped create, and does something about it.If only the true humanitarian message and morals of this film could be realized and understood by our present day corporations, CEO's, power brokers, and by our indecent PTB and politician/law-makers (and the superficial and sensationalist-driven mainstream media and Hollywood elite), this world would be, I believe, a lot better one in which to live.This is a film as topical as anything since, unfortunately, but the lessons have yet to be learned, and if anything, the PTB (powers that be) have only since gained more and more, at the expense of others less fortunate.  For those viewing this as simply a pretty decent flick, without any heavy moral undertones, it is still Stone's most satisfying and easily understood filmic experience.  In addition however, for those who read between the lines, and truly get the under-the-surface morality message here, it simply but powerfully renders upon the viewer a deep questioning of what ""success"" really is, and at what acceptable cost.""Wall Street"" was produced in the 80's, but its message and power, seem as true today as ever.  Unlike so many other murky or over the top Oliver Stone films though, it remains, and probably will for some time, the definitive cinematic morality play from one of America's greatest filmmakers.  Its message is clear, upon repeated viewings, and that is that reality is, we are all in this together, we sink and/or swim together, and harming others in the pursuit of selfish gain, is a moral philosophy doomed to spiritual and individual failure, in the end.  No matter how great the temporary materialistic gains.If you only see one Oliver Stone film in your life, let it be his best, in my view, this one.  If its subtle but sublime morality message does not grab you at first, it probably will eventually, as you think about it more and more later on.",5,Oliver Stone's Best FIlm...,1172534400,"02 27,

Brilliant performances by Michael Douglas, Martin Sheen, Terrance Stamp, Darryl Hannah and by far Charlie Sheen's crowl jewel to date. Sorry, I don't count Hot Shots or Hot Shots Part Deux...please. Michael Douglas's character, Gordon Geckko, is a composite of the inside trader scoundrels that plagued Wall Street in the late eighties. Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, an aspiring young  stock trader on Wall Street trying to hit the big leagues during the yuppie craze of the eighties. Charlie's real-life father, Martin Sheen plays his dad in the film, and it adds an important sense of realism to the film. Terrance Stamp, a British actor, whose best known for being General Zod in Superman 2 with Christopher Reeve, sad since he's such a brilliant actor. In this film, he plays a rival British trader, who has an extreme dislike for Gordon. Darryl Hannah gives her best performance other than Splash, as Charlie's interior decorator girlfriend, whose lust for fame and money rivals his own. A great supporting cast surround the strongest of lead character's, though, Michael Douglas, who won an academy award for his portrayal, and rightfully so. Of all his film's,  this one truly exemplifies his brilliance as an actor.

Dig it. I mean, he  doesn't play the victim of some femme fetale like in at least three of his  films done in this era. (Can you imagine someone getting into that fix like  he did in 'Disclosure'? Definitely one for the liberal audiences.) Here, he  is a slimy, cutthroat dude who really cannot be trusted. His job is in,  like the late, great Walter Matthau said in one of his last comedies,  'moih-gerhs and ack-wa-sishuns'.Gekko tries to stab his young broker's  back by buying the majority shares of a small airlines company and selling  out at a tidy profit before he dismantles it into oblivion...the heck with  who being hurt by all this, maybe he'll get a measly 4 million out of these  goings on. Bud Fox, the young broker who idolised the great Gekko, has a  stroke of ethics and moves to save the company--it is the same company in  which his Dad has put long hours at and from which Dad was able to put his  'hotshot broker son' thru college. Plus, doggone it, Gekko's life just  don't look as glamorous as it used to....to save the company, Bud has to  take down Gekko, and hence himself, by getting Gekko to admit on tape that  insider information he's received was gained illegally. Like most of it  is.The dialog, the acting, the topic--money, making money and money  men--are grrreat. A very good movie to waste a Saturday afternoon on.
