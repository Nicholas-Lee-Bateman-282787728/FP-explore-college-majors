The special is a 3 part 2 DVD set of the Impressionts era during set date of the late 1870's' to as early 1900's. This video special to me as a drama, and biography, and documentary all roll into one special, I very much recommend to Art students, if your a art history buff, get this special, and especially to photographers that do alot of landscape, and still life photography at either Film, and Digital GET IT. You can do alot of both study the lighting, and color, and design, and also previsualize your scenery. I first seen this special  on our PBS Channel in San Francisco, all 3 parts in one night, and I can say that this was the most very good special than watching Sue Orman (Yech). The actors that protrayed the Impressionists artist really played their parts to the bone. And the actor Julian Glover playing older Monet, Please someone give him a Emmy he deserved it. The whole cast, and production deserved an award for the best movie bio of the year.

1020668,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000IHYXK8,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Every now and then -- in every medium -- a new artistic movement rises up to challenge the old ways. One such was the Impressionists.And the miniseries simply titled ""The Impressionists"" gives a pretty good overview of the formation of this movement, specifically the struggles they went through to become respected artists. While sometimes it whitewashes Claude Monet's life, the emphasis is mostly on their travails as artists, the source of their groundbreaking art and their relationships to each other.The framing device is that a young reporter is coming to interview the aged Claude Monet (Julian Glover) in his garden. So Monet waxes nostalgic about his career and friends in the Impressionist movement, who have all passed away by now.He recounts how, as a young man (and played by Richard Armitage), he came to an elite art school in Paris... but is quickly disillusioned when they refuse to let him paint and/or sketch anything but classically-influenced ""style."" So he joined up with a group of like-minded artists, who sought to show the beauty of light and water, to capture nature, to capture the reality of the world in a single moment from a single perspective. The Salon rejected them, so they chose to exhibit their own works.These men included Monet's inspiration, the almost homophonically-named Manet (Andrew Havill), who raged against an art community that ignored him; Bazille (James Lance), who was tragically killed in battle before his genius was acknowledged; the troublesome Edgar Degas (Aden Gillett), who specialized in the backstage world of ballet; the playful femmephile Renoir (Charlie Condou); and eventually the erratic and eccentric Cezanne (Will Keen), a brilliant artist with a troubled personal life.Their work is derided as ugly, sloppy, unfinished and common. But artistic criticism wasn't the only problem they had -- most of them struggled with poverty, especially Monet since he had a family. Manet suffered a painful, gangrenous disease (presumably syphilis) that eventually killed him. A war brought on a more rigid, nationalistic approach to art. Degas' financial woes and failing eyesight added to his cold bitterness, which threatened to fracture the little group.Unlike many miniseries, ""The Impressionists"" chooses to focus more on the group's art and less on their personal lives. Oh, we hear what happened to them outside their work -- particularly the death of Monet's first wife, and his much-rumored relationship with a married woman who looked after his children. But the first and most important aspect of the narrative is art, art, art.And so the three episodes wind through the lives of all these men. At times their struggles are like watching someone try to beat down a door with their skull, but there's a feeling of wild, free passion in the first episode, despite the crippling poverty they all face. Things become more serious in the second, where they become burdened by responsibility or personal problems. And in the third, the older Impressionists have settled into more respectable, successful lives, and must make a place for the younger generation.However, it does have some flaws. The miniseries goes a little too far out of its way to assure us that NO WAY NO HOW was Alice Monet's mistress, and it cuts out some of the less pleasant aspects of her character. And (presumably because of the limited time) it has to ignore some other Impressionists like Mary Cassatt, Armand Guillaumin, et cetera.Richard Armitage gives a show-stopping performance as Monet. His greatest strength is showing intensity and passion, and he depicts Monet's approach to his controversial art with the same fiery richness of a man seeking an elusive lover. Glover does a solid job with the older Monet, a man whose once-boundless energy has burnt low, and who has seen all his friends slip away over the years.Amanda Root has excellent chemistry with Armitage as his second wife, a woman who was (ironically) married to one of Monet's buyers. As for Havill, Gillett, Condou and Keen, all the bushy artistic beards can make them all look a bit samey. It's their performances that set them apart from each other -- Degas' brittle, overcontrolling nature, Manet's fiery avant-garde passion, Renoir's playfulness.""The Impressionists"" has a few spots that could have used a bit more paint, but it captures the light and shadow of a vital artistic movement, without ever becoming too soap-operaish.",4,"""We can never go back from this moment""",1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,4446,"['now', 'then', 'medium', 'new', 'artistic', 'movement', 'up', 'challenge', 'old', 'ways', 'One', 'such', 'was', 'Impressionists.And', 'miniseries', 'simply', 'titled', 'Impressionists', 'pretty', 'good', 'overview', 'formation', 'movement', 'specifically', 'struggles', 'went', 'become', 'respected', 'artists', 'sometimes', 'Claude', 'Monet', 'life', 'emphasis', 'mostly', 'travails', 'artists', 'source', 'groundbreaking', 'art', 'relationships', 'other.The', 'framing', 'device', 'young', 'reporter', 'coming', 'interview', 'aged', 'Claude', 'Monet', 'Julian', 'Glover', 'garden', 'Monet', 'waxes', 'nostalgic', 'career', 'friends', 'Impressionist', 'movement', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'now.He', 'recounts', 'how', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'came', 'elite', 'art', 'school', 'Paris', 'quickly', 'disillusioned', 'when', 'refuse', 'let', 'paint', 'and/or', 'sketch', 'anything', 'classically-influenced', 'style', 'joined', 'up', 'group', 'like-minded', 'artists', 'who', 'sought', 'show', 'beauty', 'light', 'water', 'capture', 'nature', 'capture', 'reality', 'world', 'single', 'moment', 'single', 'perspective', 'Salon', 'rejected', 'chose', 'exhibit', 'own', 'works.These', 'men', 'included', 'Monet', 'inspiration', 'almost', 'homophonically-named', 'Manet', 'Andrew', 'Havill', 'who', 'raged', 'art', 'community', 'ignored', 'Bazille', 'James', 'Lance', 'who', 'was', 'tragically', 'killed', 'battle', 'genius', 'was', 'acknowledged', 'troublesome', 'Edgar', 'Degas', 'Aden', 'Gillett', 'who', 'specialized', 'backstage', 'world', 'ballet', 'playful', 'femmephile', 'Renoir', 'Charlie', 'Condou', 'eventually', 'erratic', 'eccentric', 'Cezanne', 'Will', 'Keen', 'brilliant', 'artist', 'troubled', 'personal', 'life.Their', 'work', 'derided', 'ugly', 'sloppy', 'unfinished', 'common', 'artistic', 'criticism', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'most', 'struggled', 'poverty', 'especially', 'Monet', 'had', 'family', 'Manet', 'suffered', 'painful', 'gangrenous', 'disease', 'presumably', 'syphilis', 'eventually', 'killed', 'A', 'war', 'brought', 'more', 'rigid', 'nationalistic', 'approach', 'art', 'Degas', 'financial', 'woes', 'failing', 'eyesight', 'added', 'cold', 'bitterness', 'threatened', 'fracture', 'little', 'group.Unlike', 'many', 'miniseries', 'Impressionists', 'focus', 'more', 'group', 'art', 'less', 'personal', 'lives', 'Oh', 'hear', 'what', 'happened', 'outside', 'work', 'particularly', 'death', 'Monet', 'first', 'wife', 'much-rumored', 'relationship', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'looked', 'children', 'first', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'narrative', 'art', 'art', 'art.And', 'three', 'episodes', 'wind', 'lives', 'men', 'times', 'struggles', 'are', 'watching', 'someone', 'try', 'beat', 'down', 'door', 'skull', 'feeling', 'wild', 'free', 'passion', 'first', 'episode', 'crippling', 'poverty', 'face', 'become', 'more', 'serious', 'second', 'where', 'become', 'burdened', 'responsibility', 'personal', 'problems', 'third', 'older', 'Impressionists', 'have', 'settled', 'more', 'respectable', 'successful', 'lives', 'must', 'make', 'place', 'younger', 'generation.However', 'have', 'flaws', 'miniseries', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'way', 'assure', 'WAY', 'NO', 'HOW', 'was', 'Alice', 'Monet', 'mistress', 'out', 'less', 'pleasant', 'aspects', 'character', 'presumably', 'limited', 'time', 'ignore', 'other', 'Impressionists', 'Mary', 'Cassatt', 'Armand', 'Guillaumin', 'et', 'cetera.Richard', 'Armitage', 'show-stopping', 'performance', 'Monet', 'greatest', 'strength', 'showing', 'intensity', 'passion', 'Monet', 'approach', 'controversial', 'art', 'same', 'fiery', 'richness', 'man', 'seeking', 'elusive', 'lover', 'Glover', 'solid', 'job', 'older', 'Monet', 'man', 'once-boundless', 'energy', 'burnt', 'low', 'who', 'seen', 'friends', 'slip', 'away', 'years.Amanda', 'Root', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'Armitage', 'second', 'wife', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'ironically', 'married', 'one', 'Monet', 'buyers', 'Havill', 'Gillett', 'Condou', 'Keen', 'bushy', 'artistic', 'beards', 'can', 'make', 'look', 'bit', 'samey', 'performances', 'set', 'apart', 'other', 'Degas', 'brittle', 'overcontrolling', 'nature', 'Manet', 'fiery', 'avant-garde', 'passion', 'Renoir', 'playfulness', 'Impressionists', 'few', 'spots', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'paint', 'light', 'shadow', 'vital', 'artistic', 'movement', 'ever', 'becoming', 'too', 'soap-operaish']",N/A

Entirely based on documentary evidence, special effects transport the viewer inside some of the world's best-loved paintings, The Impressionists will recreate the illuminated landscapes, and haunting portraits of late 19th-century France.""The name of the movement is derived from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satiric review published in Le Charivari ... Impressionism was a 19th century art movement that began as a loose association of Paris-based artists, who began exhibiting their art publicly in the 1860s ... Characteristics of Impressionist painting include visible brushstrokes, light colors, open composition, emphasis on light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, and unusual visual angles ... Impressionism also describes art created in this style, but outside of the late 19th century time period ... the influence of the Impressionists is thought to have spread beyond the art world, leading to Impressionist music and Impressionist literature ... Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the ""purest"" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and color. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over color and belittled the practice of painting outdoors ... The term ""Impressionists"" quickly gained favor with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion.SPECIAL FEATURES:BIOS:1.

Since RA looked really hot and as I have an Art History degree it seemed like a natural. It was an entrancing three hours!It is a quasi-documentary centered around several of the founders of the Impressionist movement-Manet, Renoir, Degas, Bazille, Cezanne, etc. It is told from the perspective of an aged Monet who is portrayed in flashback by Armitage.  Beginning in 1866 when several of them are in art school together, it follows the remainder of their lives.  Some viewers may have quibbles with omissions, artistic license, etc., however, I found it fascinating, informative and visually stunning.  It is an interesting perspective to realize there was a time when Impressionism was seen as avant garde and even ugly.The excellent cinematography allows a visual experience of the qualities the Impressionists were trying to convey and there are wonderful dissolves from the scenes into the actual paintings.  The costumes are impeccable as most of them were taken from the clothing in the paintings.  Monet's charming family life and Giverny are beautifully portrayed.The actors are all excellent but Armitage shines in his role as Claude Monet *the blue of his painting smock matches his eyes*.  The scenes of him conveying his joy in the qualities of smoke, fog and dappled sunshine really should open the viewers eyes to the simple beauty in our world.  I found his compulsive desire to convey the wonders of color, even while sketching the face of his dying wife, to be very moving.  It is a bit macabre but I know that Diego Riviera sketched the bone structure of the newly cremated body of Frieda Kahlo before she slowly dissolved into ash.

The combination of brilliant photography of the actual sites and the paintings made of them was wonderful to see.  I thought I was familiar with the works of the Impressionists but there were many paintings shown that were new to me.The story built around the paintings is almost secondary to the paintings.  The writers did a good job of putting together a script, apparently based on diaries and documents of the artists.  It centers on the life of Monet, and if I have any criticism, it's that I would have liked to see more of the lives of the others, and less of Monet's. The DVD also has a substantial extra feature on the life and painting of Monet, which repeats a lot of the information in the series.As another reviewer remarked, the omission of Berthe Morissot and Mary Cassat, two wonderful Impressionist painters, was a glaring error.  The women in the film are all models or mistresses, or mothers of the artists' children.The portrayal of Cezanne was disturbing, too, making him seem almost pathological.

1020678,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000IHYXK8,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[9, 10]","As BBC historical dramas go, this one is informative, well performed and beautifully photographed. Art historians, however, may question how well it represents the artists, their work, and their relationships. It falls rather neatly into the shape of a miniseries, and one is left to wonder what's been left out and what's been enhanced to conform to the requirements of the genre. For me, the absence of Pissarro was unexpected, and I would like to have learned more about Renoir, who seemed more of a playful side-kick to the rest of the group of painters who challenged the officially approved style of art that ruled the salons of Paris in the 1880s.Shaping this material (we are told it is a ""true story"" based on interviews and documents) must have been a particular challenge for the writers Colin Swash and Sarah Woods. And it's finally hard to say what the central thread of the story is meant to be. Much is made of how vicious was the early objection to their work - and how dire their poverty - yet as the painters become accepted, we don't learn how the shift happened or what was the tipping point. By this time in the story, there's more emphasis on Monet's domestic affairs, and Cezanne assumes the role of the artist whose work is reviled as ""ugly.""The frame around the narrative (Monet being interviewed in 1920) seems a cumbersome device; the scenes between himself and the journalist lack dramatic interest. It remains difficult to the end to see the continuity between the underfed and sparsely bearded younger man and the portly older artist obsessed with his water lilies and sporting a beard the size of a shovel. Though many years pass, the characters seem not to age or to be much affected by the remarkable developments in their lives, rising from obscurity and poverty to fame and fortune. Maybe all that is too much to ask from a miniseries, but its absence leaves it all very pretty to look at, as it should be, yet seeming a little contrived.",4,Last living Impressionist tells all . . .,1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,1973,"['BBC', 'historical', 'dramas', 'go', 'one', 'informative', 'well', 'performed', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Art', 'historians', 'however', 'may', 'question', 'how', 'well', 'artists', 'work', 'relationships', 'rather', 'neatly', 'shape', 'miniseries', 'one', 'left', 'wonder', 'what', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'what', 'been', 'enhanced', 'conform', 'requirements', 'genre', 'absence', 'Pissarro', 'was', 'unexpected', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'learned', 'more', 'Renoir', 'who', 'seemed', 'more', 'playful', 'side-kick', 'rest', 'group', 'painters', 'who', 'challenged', 'officially', 'approved', 'style', 'art', 'ruled', 'salons', 'Paris', '1880s.Shaping', 'material', 'are', 'told', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'interviews', 'documents', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'particular', 'challenge', 'writers', 'Colin', 'Swash', 'Sarah', 'Woods', 'finally', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'central', 'thread', 'story', 'meant', 'be', 'Much', 'made', 'how', 'vicious', 'was', 'early', 'objection', 'work', 'how', 'dire', 'poverty', 'yet', 'painters', 'become', 'accepted', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'how', 'shift', 'happened', 'what', 'was', 'tipping', 'point', 'time', 'story', 'more', 'emphasis', 'Monet', 'domestic', 'affairs', 'Cezanne', 'role', 'artist', 'work', 'reviled', 'ugly', 'frame', 'narrative', 'Monet', 'being', 'interviewed', '1920', 'cumbersome', 'device', 'scenes', 'journalist', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'interest', 'difficult', 'end', 'see', 'continuity', 'underfed', 'sparsely', 'bearded', 'younger', 'man', 'portly', 'older', 'artist', 'obsessed', 'water', 'lilies', 'sporting', 'beard', 'size', 'shovel', 'many', 'years', 'pass', 'characters', 'seem', 'not', 'age', 'be', 'much', 'affected', 'remarkable', 'developments', 'lives', 'rising', 'obscurity', 'poverty', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Maybe', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'miniseries', 'absence', 'very', 'pretty', 'look', 'should', 'be', 'yet', 'seeming', 'little', 'contrived']",N/A
