1344723,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B003FSTN84,Amanda,"[29, 30]","I started watching Numb3rs a couple of seasons ago after my mom convinced me to give it a shot. Since then I've gotten hooked, keeping up with each new episode. I was concerned when the show was moved to a late-evening Friday slot, which I was afraid would be the end of it. I'm not sure if it was the time that directly led to Numb3rs cancellation, but either way, season six ended up being the end of the road for the show.It seems like the writers knew the show was out of steam near the beginning of the season when they are started to wrap up different character's stories, and started neglecting the mathematics. I know the math angle has pretty much just a gimmick from the beginning to distinguish Numb3rs from the mass of police procedurals on television, but in the last season the writers seemed to get a little lazy with the math, and took it into places that didn't make much sense and making it even harder to believe. But hey, taken purely as part of the show, it worked fine.The season opens with the engagement of Charlie (David Krumholtz) and Amita (Navi Rawat). Soon after, Larry (Peter MacNicol) turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at CERN in Geneva and drops his course load for the following semester. Don (Rob Morrow) learns that his former mentor is crooked, forcing him to question himself and the meaning of his job. The show finally ends with Charlie and Amita's wedding and Don deciding to take a new direction in life away from the FBI.The characters of Numb3rs are fairly well drawn and feel complex and real and, honestly, they kept me watching more than the story lines. It was interesting to see the characters grow and change over the course of the series, and for the most part, it felt natural (even though the ending for Charlie especially seemed a little abrupt).Numb3rs: The Final Season on DVD includes all 16 episodes in a four-disc set. The audio is available in English in 5.1 or stereo with the option for English subtitles only. The aspect ratio is 16:9. The video and audio quality are both on par with previous seasons released on DVD, including a bombastic audio during the opening and transition scenes.The special features include: ""Coming Full Circle: Numb3rs The Final Season"" an overview of the series as a whole, ""The Women of Numb3rs"" which explores the lovely, intelligent and quirky ladies of the show, ""Pixel Perfect: The Digital Cinematography of Numb3rs"" for the more technically orianted viewers, a production photo gallery of the cast and crew over the years, and insightful cast and crew commentary on three episodes (sadly, down from the amount given in previous DVD sets).Thought I'm sad to see it end, Numb3rs had a great run. They probably could have squeezed a few more seasons out of it, but it may not have kept the same intensity, enjoyment or originality. I'd rather the show end on a high note, rather than fading away into something boring and horrible. The final season, thankfully, delivered a satisfying conclusion to a fun series.",4,Satisfying ending to a great series,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,3026,"['started', 'watching', 'Numb3rs', 'couple', 'seasons', 'ago', 'mom', 'convinced', 'give', 'shot', 'then', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'hooked', 'keeping', 'up', 'new', 'episode', 'was', 'concerned', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'moved', 'late-evening', 'Friday', 'slot', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'be', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'time', 'directly', 'led', 'Numb3rs', 'cancellation', 'way', 'season', 'six', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'end', 'road', 'show.It', 'writers', 'knew', 'show', 'was', 'steam', 'beginning', 'season', 'when', 'are', 'started', 'wrap', 'up', 'different', 'character', 'stories', 'started', 'neglecting', 'mathematics', 'know', 'math', 'angle', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'gimmick', 'beginning', 'distinguish', 'Numb3rs', 'mass', 'police', 'procedurals', 'television', 'last', 'season', 'writers', 'seemed', 'get', 'little', 'lazy', 'math', 'took', 'places', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'making', 'even', 'harder', 'believe', 'hey', 'taken', 'purely', 'part', 'show', 'worked', 'fine.The', 'season', 'engagement', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'Amita', 'Navi', 'Rawat', 'Soon', 'Larry', 'Peter', 'MacNicol', 'down', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'mathematicians', 'CERN', 'Geneva', 'course', 'load', 'following', 'semester', 'Don', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'former', 'mentor', 'crooked', 'forcing', 'question', 'meaning', 'job', 'show', 'finally', 'Charlie', 'Amita', 'wedding', 'Don', 'deciding', 'take', 'new', 'direction', 'life', 'away', 'FBI.The', 'characters', 'Numb3rs', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'drawn', 'feel', 'complex', 'real', 'honestly', 'kept', 'watching', 'more', 'story', 'lines', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'characters', 'grow', 'change', 'course', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'felt', 'natural', 'even', 'ending', 'Charlie', 'especially', 'seemed', 'little', 'abrupt', '.Numb3rs', 'Final', 'Season', 'DVD', '16', 'episodes', 'four-disc', 'set', 'audio', 'available', 'English', '5.1', 'stereo', 'option', 'English', 'only', 'aspect', 'ratio', '16:9', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'par', 'previous', 'seasons', 'released', 'DVD', 'including', 'bombastic', 'audio', 'opening', 'transition', 'scenes.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'Coming', 'Full', 'Circle', 'Numb3rs', 'Final', 'Season', 'overview', 'series', 'whole', 'Women', 'Numb3rs', 'lovely', 'intelligent', 'quirky', 'ladies', 'show', 'Pixel', 'Perfect', 'Digital', 'Cinematography', 'Numb3rs', 'more', 'technically', 'orianted', 'viewers', 'production', 'photo', 'gallery', 'cast', 'crew', 'years', 'insightful', 'cast', 'crew', 'commentary', 'three', 'episodes', 'sadly', 'down', 'amount', 'given', 'previous', 'DVD', 'sets', '.Thought', ""'m"", 'sad', 'see', 'end', 'Numb3rs', 'had', 'great', 'run', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'squeezed', 'few', 'more', 'seasons', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'kept', 'same', 'intensity', 'enjoyment', 'originality', ""'d"", 'rather', 'show', 'end', 'high', 'note', 'rather', 'fading', 'away', 'something', 'boring', 'horrible', 'final', 'season', 'thankfully', 'delivered', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'fun', 'series']",Numb3rs: The Final Season

1344751,A1RQYTVCKYU76I,B003FSTN84,R.C.,"[70, 71]","I haven't kept a close eye on ""Numb3rs"" thanks to its dead end 10 pm Friday night airing, but when I had tuned in (primarily via On Demand), I rarely was ever disappointed. I will submit that the mathematics used in this sixth season wasn't the greatest and in fact during one episode, 'And the Winner Is', didn't make a whole lot of sense in that the theory was sound but how they came about it and in turn found the culprits was on the iffy side. But, I've always felt that while indeed the show's gimmick was using mathematics to solve crimes it is the characters and their arcs that make it worthwhile viewing. In the sixth season I could immediately tell that even the writers had an inkling this would be the final season as they began tying up the characters' stories and by the series finale, as a casual fan, I was mostly satisfied. Yes, it is a very low key ending to the show as even the plot was in line with most of the stories that have come before but I wouldn't want it any other way. They could have had some big shootout or major explosion that would've altered or even killed a main character but far too many shows (see: ""CSI: Miami"") do that and it just comes off as melodramatic and rarely works. Plus, with only a few exceptions, isn't really ""Numb3rs"" style.As for this DVD, I can see how the features have devolved from the first couple of seasons (5-6 episode commentaries, a few featurettes) to the latter releases where, in the case of The Fifth Season, having only a featurette and no commentaries at all. In this one, we do get commentaries on 3 episodes ('Con Job' - actor Rob Morrow, director Ralph Hemecker and executive Don McGill; `Old Soldiers' with director Ken Sanzel, actor Alimi Ballard and guest star Henry Winkler; and `Cause and Effect' with creators/writers Cheryl Heuton, Nicolas Falacci (who also directed) and actor David Krumholtz) but unfortunately they couldn't get the entire cast together for the finale, though I am glad it did get one (unlike ""Scrubs"").The set also has a decent featurette entitled ""Coming Full Circle: Numb3rs The Final Season"" (25:42) in which the first half chronicles Falacci's directorial debut on the series finale before going into the cast and crew talking about this being the end of the road (it also includes emotional on-set final statements by the cast). There are also two more featurettes (""The Women of Numb3rs"" (11:04) and Pixel Perfect: The Digital Cinematography of Numb3rs (15:10)) and each are pretty good, though ""Coming Full Circle"" is the one to see. There is also a photo gallery with pics taken of the cast and crew taken over the years.The video and audio quality are both on par with previous seasons including a bombastic audio during the opening and transition scenes.Anyway, fans of the show should of course pick this up and I think for casual fans like myself, it's still worth it as I feel this is one of the better shows that was on TV and it's nice to have it sitting on your shelf, plus it helps the show has plenty of repeat value.",4,Fitting End for an Underrated Series,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,3040,"['have', ""n't"", 'kept', 'close', 'eye', 'Numb3rs', 'thanks', 'dead', 'end', '10', 'pm', 'Friday', 'night', 'airing', 'when', 'had', 'tuned', 'primarily', 'Demand', 'rarely', 'was', 'ever', 'disappointed', 'will', 'submit', 'mathematics', 'used', 'sixth', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'fact', 'one', 'episode', 'Winner', 'Is', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense', 'theory', 'was', 'sound', 'how', 'came', 'turn', 'found', 'culprits', 'was', 'iffy', 'side', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'indeed', 'show', 'gimmick', 'was', 'using', 'mathematics', 'solve', 'crimes', 'characters', 'arcs', 'make', 'viewing', 'sixth', 'season', 'could', 'immediately', 'tell', 'even', 'writers', 'had', 'inkling', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'began', 'tying', 'up', 'characters', 'stories', 'series', 'finale', 'casual', 'fan', 'was', 'mostly', 'satisfied', 'Yes', 'very', 'low', 'key', 'ending', 'show', 'even', 'plot', 'was', 'line', 'most', 'stories', 'have', 'come', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'other', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'shootout', 'major', 'explosion', 'would', ""'ve"", 'altered', 'even', 'killed', 'main', 'character', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'shows', 'see', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'do', 'just', 'off', 'melodramatic', 'rarely', 'only', 'few', 'exceptions', ""n't"", 'really', 'Numb3rs', 'style.As', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'features', 'have', 'devolved', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', '5-6', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'few', 'featurettes', 'latter', 'where', 'case', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'having', 'only', 'featurette', 'commentaries', 'one', 'do', 'get', 'commentaries', '3', 'episodes', ""'Con"", 'Job', 'actor', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'director', 'Ralph', 'Hemecker', 'executive', 'Don', 'McGill', 'Old', 'Soldiers', 'director', 'Ken', 'Sanzel', 'actor', 'Alimi', 'Ballard', 'guest', 'star', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Cause', 'Effect', 'creators/writers', 'Cheryl', 'Heuton', 'Nicolas', 'Falacci', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'actor', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'unfortunately', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'entire', 'cast', 'together', 'finale', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'get', 'one', 'Scrubs', '.The', 'set', 'also', 'decent', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Coming', 'Full', 'Circle', 'Numb3rs', 'Final', 'Season', '25:42', 'first', 'half', 'chronicles', 'Falacci', 'directorial', 'debut', 'series', 'finale', 'going', 'cast', 'crew', 'talking', 'being', 'end', 'road', 'also', 'emotional', 'on-set', 'final', 'statements', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'more', 'featurettes', 'Women', 'Numb3rs', '11:04', 'Pixel', 'Perfect', 'Digital', 'Cinematography', 'Numb3rs', '15:10', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Coming', 'Full', 'Circle', 'one', 'see', 'also', 'photo', 'gallery', 'pics', 'taken', 'cast', 'crew', 'taken', 'years.The', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'par', 'previous', 'seasons', 'including', 'bombastic', 'audio', 'opening', 'transition', 'scenes.Anyway', 'fans', 'show', 'should', 'course', 'pick', 'think', 'casual', 'fans', 'still', 'worth', 'feel', 'one', 'better', 'shows', 'was', 'TV', 'nice', 'have', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'show', 'plenty', 'repeat', 'value']",Numb3rs: The Final Season
