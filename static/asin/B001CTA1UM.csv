This is not an Oscar caliber movie at all but was an entertaining holiday family reunion comedy. Reese & Vaughn's chemistry was funny but seemed to be weak in the romance area. Only a mild spark came through the screen. They didn't seem to fit romantically real well but was not a serious flaw. Fit as good as some real life couples I know so not unrealistic.Vince and the vomit scenes are just too funny. He does the manic goofball well here. Good cast executing a silly comedy in a respectable way. I like most all of Vaughn and Reese's work to date. There is more to these two than a lot of other Hollywood types.This not a classic but still a cut above some of the junk coming out lately. Some story plots telegraphed but this is seems to be the norm too often, including big budget and acclaimed movies too. Hey movie makers we're not stupid and can handle a surprise! (Even been known to be able to follow a book) Light fun with good supporting cast.Give it a look and you will be surprised. Solid 4 stars.

1177628,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001CTA1UM,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, John Voight and Mary Steenburgen join forces with Emmy winner Kristen Chenoweth, Grammy winner Tim McGraw, that guy who directed `Iron Man' and Vince Vaughn to create a cluttered holiday comedy that is awkward, silly, uneven and (thankfully), really funny.It works.The film is kind of like a hodgepodge of other (better) comedies, but within all the madness is a film that is enjoyable to say the least.  My wife commented on how stupid the movie really was, but in the end both of us said it was `stupid funny' and not stupid enough to make us turn the movie off.Brad and Kate are dating with no prospects for marriage or children.  They like being crazy, spontaneous and free.  Throw any form of commitment or responsibility their way and they run screaming in the other direction.  Every Christmas they avoid family like the plague (they both come from broken homes) but when their trip to Fiji is cancelled due to weather problems they find themselves squeezing in four Christmases with a random group of ridiculous family members.Really, it's not like any of this seems remotely natural or believable, but I don't think that was the point.Some have mentioned that Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon have no chemistry with one another (although they do have some), but they have a lot of chemistry with everyone else (especially Vaughn), which more than makes up for it.  I am a huge fan of comedian Vaughn (seriously, why didn't he begin his career like this?) and so I was really excited to see him carry this film, and he did (rather well).  The whos-who of supporting players are really overshadowed by a few small names.  In fact, Katy Mixon is utterly hilarious and steels every scene she is in (the `Taboo' scene is the best in the film) and I had no idea WHO she was (although I know I've seen her before).It's clich&eacute;d and poorly constructed and generic to tell you the truth, but it's funny, and sometimes that is all that matters.",3,"It's not really that good, but it's laugh-out-loud funny, and that makes up for a lot...",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2013,"['Oscar', 'winners', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'John', 'Voight', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'join', 'forces', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'Kristen', 'Chenoweth', 'Grammy', 'winner', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'create', 'cluttered', 'holiday', 'comedy', 'awkward', 'silly', 'uneven', 'thankfully', 'really', 'funny.It', 'works.The', 'film', 'kind', 'hodgepodge', 'other', 'better', 'comedies', 'madness', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'say', 'least', 'wife', 'commented', 'how', 'stupid', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'end', 'said', 'was', 'stupid', 'funny', 'not', 'stupid', 'enough', 'make', 'turn', 'movie', 'off.Brad', 'Kate', 'are', 'dating', 'prospects', 'marriage', 'children', 'being', 'crazy', 'spontaneous', 'free', 'Throw', 'form', 'commitment', 'responsibility', 'way', 'run', 'screaming', 'other', 'direction', 'Every', 'Christmas', 'avoid', 'family', 'plague', 'come', 'broken', 'homes', 'when', 'trip', 'Fiji', 'cancelled', 'due', 'weather', 'problems', 'find', 'squeezing', 'four', 'Christmases', 'random', 'group', 'ridiculous', 'family', 'members.Really', 'not', 'remotely', 'natural', 'believable', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'point.Some', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'have', 'chemistry', 'one', 'do', 'have', 'have', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'everyone', 'else', 'especially', 'Vaughn', 'more', 'up', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'comedian', 'Vaughn', 'seriously', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'begin', 'career', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'carry', 'film', 'did', 'rather', 'well', 'whos-who', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'really', 'overshadowed', 'few', 'small', 'names', 'fact', 'Katy', 'Mixon', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'steels', 'scene', 'Taboo', 'scene', 'best', 'film', 'had', 'idea', 'WHO', 'was', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', '.It', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'generic', 'tell', 'truth', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'matters']",Four Christmases (DVD)

It has a poor story with characters that you are supposed to like but only end up hating. Unlike, say, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, where the family was crazy but we ended up loving them anyway, the four families in Four Christmases are all without any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Whereas Christmas Vacation showed how important family was even when everything around them went wrong, Four Christmases basically supports the notion of the two main characters that they're better off avoiding them.Basically, all their parents (except maybe her dad) have no parental qualities at all. There is no reconciliation between anybody. What exactly was supposed to be so funny about all the over-the-top things that happen, if there is nobody to like? There are no family qualities to any of them, to the point when it was just downright offensive. I didn't feel the least bit like laughing. I just hated their families - and eventually Brad, too, a loudmouthed and ultimately selfish man. Reese Witherspoon's character was the only character I felt for, but eventually I lost my respect for her too for choosing to be with that man.The message is extremely heavyhanded and clumsy. How are families as awful as theirs important when they don't care for them in return? In NP's Christmas Vacation, you came to care for the family. Not so much here, I just hated the lot of them.

1177643,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001CTA1UM,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 7]","It can't possibly be a good sign that A-list actors like Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughn, Sissy Spacek, Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, and Jon Voight agreed to star in ""Four Christmases."" Given their reputations--and for many, this includes Academy Award nominations--you'd think someone would have noticed that the story was both unoriginal and unfunny. There are only two possibilities I can consider, and neither one paints a very flattering picture: Either the cast was motivated by a paycheck, or they all suffered from a serious lack of judgment, believing that audiences would actually be entertained by it. Maybe it's a little bit of both. Whatever the case, they're stuck in film that tries so hard to be both funny and touching that it fails both ways. It starts as a comedy that only goes for the cheap laughs, only to become a bland sentimental commentary on the importance of family. I don't need to spend $8.75 to be told that we should spend time with our loved ones, even if they're completely insane. By now, I think we all know.The setup: Vaughn and Witherspoon play Brad and Kate, a happily unmarried couple living in San Francisco. I have no idea what they do for a living, but given the fact that they can afford an apartment in one of the country's most expensive real estate markets, they're clearly paid well. Anyway, at Christmastime, they have a tradition of avoiding their families by vacationing in exotic locations; so as not to upset anyone, they claim that they're involved in humanitarian efforts, such as immunizing disadvantaged children in Asia. This year, they planned on going to Fiji. Unfortunately, heavy fog forces every outgoing flight from San Francisco International to be cancelled. What's worse is that a news reporter is there to cover the story, and lo and behold, Brad and Kate are interviewed on camera. Naturally, their parents, who are all divorced and living in separate homes, see them exposed on television. Now Brad and Kate have no choice but to visit their families on Christmas Day.Christmas No. 1: Brad's father, Howard (Duvall). Duvall plays Howard like a parody of his role in ""The Great Santini""; he's a tough-talking man who belittles his son for being the more sensitive, more educated type. This is in direct contrast to brothers Dallas (Tim McGraw) and Denver (Jon Favreau), trained cage fighters who are also spending Christmas at home. Aggressive, rude, and always with a murderous glint in their eyes, they take great pleasure in beating Brad senseless, maybe because he no longer goes by his given name, Orlando (all of Howard's kids are named after the cities they were conceived in). Denver is visiting with his wife, Susan (Katy Mixon), who under less politically correct circumstances would be considered white trash--Southern, pregnant even though she already has a nine-month-old, thinking a Christmas feast is a casserole made from Spam and Doritos.Christmas No. 2: Kate's mother, Marilyn (Steenburgen). Marilyn is apparently starved for some male attention, seeing as she fawns over Brad the instant he arrives. You'd think she'd be getting enough attention from her current husband, a pastor named Phil (Dwight Yoakam), but I guess she isn't. Already there is Kate's sister, Courtney (Kristin Chenoweth), who brought along her bratty daughter and newborn son, the latter of which projectile vomits on Kate. Both Kate and Brad have been telling people that they don't want children, and after Kate has a terrible experience in a bouncy castle--which involves a group of out-of-control kids and a pregnancy test--you'd think her mind would remain unchanged. But for some strange reason, she begins to think that settling down wouldn't be such a bad thing, that marrying and having kids might actually be worthwhile. But before she can even suggest this to Brad, she has to cope with her mother, who takes the liberty of casting her and Brad in Pastor Phil's nativity play.Christmas No. 3: Brad's mother, Paula (Spacek). For the life of me, I can't understand why she and Brad's father got married in the first place. They couldn't be anything less alike. Howard is callous macho man while Susan is a sensitive pseudo-hippie. Be that as it may, Susan is now married to Brad's former childhood friend, who tries to reassure Brad by saying that he's not trying to be a father.Christmas No. 4: Kate's father, Creighton (Voight). Creighton, a sincere, sympathetic man, may be the only decent character in the entire film. Given the amount of time spent on less pleasant characters, this is problematic. If he's so loving and understanding, why has Kate been avoiding him all these years? Why not spend the holidays with him? This is when the film shifts from humor to drama, with Brad and Kate coming to terms with the fact that, for all the happiness they've shared, they don't know each other as well as they thought they did. It just goes to show you that even predictable films can have trouble with consistency. At that crucial point in the story, Voight introduces patience, serenity, and charm, essentially going against everything the film established. Did he not realize that the film was intended to be a goofy comedy? I guess it doesn't matter one way or the other. ""Four Christmases"" is a ridiculous, clunky holiday movie, simultaneously desperate for laughter and tears, performed by actors capable of so much more. Here's one Christmas gift that needs to be returned.",2,Spreading Holiday Jeer,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,5455,"['ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'good', 'sign', 'A-list', 'actors', 'Reese',

The guy is a power-house of talent and very few actors can carry scenes with him, let alone entire movies. Jennifer Aniston, Owen Wilson and John Favreau have been the most successful at this.While I absolutely adore her, Reese Witherspoon falls short comically in this film. It isn't her fault as her character clearly was not given as much attention as Vaughn's in the script; but the film suffers from it nonetheless. Other than this and a few over the top slap-stick elements that could have been shaved down, the film is a blast to watch.The opening scene was classic and couldn't have been better. It's laugh out-loud funny and gets the movie going quick and in a hurry.Vaughn plays Brad and Witherspoon is his girlfriend Kate. They agree to ditch-out on their families and head to somewhere tropical for Christmas. Their plan seemed flawless until they are interviewed at the airport, on live television and their families see the broadcast. They told their loved ones they had other plans as to why they wouldn't be able to make it for Christmas, and now the cat is out of the bag.As all four of their parents are no longer married, they must drive to four different houses in order to please everyone.Everything goes horribly wrong from one house to the next and we learn more about Brad and Kate through their families. It seems the two have had some non-transparent issues lurking in their relationship, and the comedy feeds on them.Their families are terrifically cast with a huge A-list range of names all the way from Robert Duvall to Jon Voight. When you take into consideration how little screen time there is for each side character, you really appreciate the chemistry everyone had in the film.My favorite scene was meeting Brad's mother (Sissy Spacek) and her new boyfriend who used to be Brad's best friend. This guy was such a creep and you felt Brad's pain as he tried to hold back from strangling this guy, as he made inappropriate comments and gestures. Jon Favreau joins the scene as one of Brad's crazy brothers Denver. He has a ridiculous haircut and the personality of a 10-year-old problem child.

1177652,A2VKJOBZEZJ2A0,B001CTA1UM,David A. Bede,"[6, 11]","This is a classic example of a romantic comedy trying too hard to be heartwarming. As a result, it comes across as something like a Very Special Episode of an eighties sitcom: occasionally very funny, but excruciating when it tries to be serious. The trope being beaten to death this time around is that of a perfectly well-adjusted individual - or couple in this case -  being compelled to change because of some harmless but unorthodox characteristic. The audience can see that they had no real problem to be resolved in the first place, but somehow nobody in the story can.The ""problem,"" in this case, is that Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn both come from highly dysfunctional families and prefer - with good reason - not to spend Christmas with them. They also have a policy of lying to their relatives about their absence from the holiday get togethers because...well, because it's necessary to advance the plot. When a series of only-in-Hollywood mishaps leads to their cover being blown, great hilarity ensues as they reluctantly visit relatives who range from mildly annoying to outright abusive.Some of what follows is really very funny, and of course it's only a movie and not really meant to be taken too seriously. The problem is that the movie seems to want to be taken seriously at times. That makes it only fair to ask why we're supposed to think Witherspoon and Vaughn's characters are flawed in the first place. While they're a bit immature and eccentric, they are also perfectly matched for each other and apparently very happy together. They enjoy each other's company and have no grand schemes for the future beyond continuing with what works, and they prefer to avoid spending time with relatives who are no fun at all to be around.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 2]","Tell me you want a predictable, formulaic comedy and I will promptly suggest you should watch FOUR CHRISTMASES.  A self-absorbed, yuppie couple (Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon) that historically avoids their extended families over the Yuletide (using outrageous philanthropic lies to explain why they're not available) suddenly finds itself outed via San Fran TV when their flight to Fiji gets cancelled (they are interviewed on camera after telling their families they were en route to Burma to help orphans).  Thus they must spend the Holidays with their families; and because both sets of parents are divorced, they have four houses to visit.Over the course of these visits the viewer knows darn well there is going to be awkwardness, hostility, anger, confusion, denial, guilt--heck, name the emotion; plus over the course of the story the viewer also knows the couple's relationship is going to be stressed, tested, questioned, ended, then reconciled.  So with such a formulaic set of circumstances, how does the viewer complete this journey?Through some fine moments of sheer comedic bliss.  Vaughn can still do physical comedy, and his brothers (Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw) and father (Robert Duvall) by far offer the most hysterical scenes of this film.  Mary Steenburgen (playing Witherspoon's mother) is remarkably well-preserved (roar, cougar, roar), and Sissy Spacek anchors another funny scene as part of the family plays a silly board game.  There are also lame parts (the church Christmas play was a stinker) definitely moronic, and the ending is weak, but FOUR CHRISTMASES does offer more chuckles than yawns.--D.

Running a scant 89 minutes, it stars no less than five Oscar-winning actors in the standard cookie-cutter story of a commitment-phobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Co-written by first-timers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson, along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who co-wroteThe Hangover), the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad, a pair of self-satisfied, upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharp-tongued banter turns out to be a role-playing fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket over the city ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving third-world children, they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses, all conveniently located in the Bay Area.However, the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father, where his other sons, cage-fighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his blue-collar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars, an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary, but he's still angry that she married his best friend, who is half her age, and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father, and this is where the tone gets serious-minded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon - he with his semi-improvised riffing, she with her exacting intelligence - would seem to be absurdly mismatched, but they spar convincingly, even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his ham-fisted stage debut. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time, and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Carol Kane, and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon, whose only previous feature-length credit is the critically praised video-game documentary,The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADD-level pacing of the story. The 2009 DVD, being released for the holidays, doesn't offer much in terms of extras other two different screen formats.",3,Snappy Comedy Touches Smothered by Hollywood Overkill in Standard Holiday Fare,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,3194,"['rudely', 'rambunctious', 'intermittently', 'funny', '2008', 'holiday', 'comedy', 'supreme', 'case', 'Hollywood', 'overkill', 'lines', 'Jay', ""Roach'sMeet"", 'Fockers', 'Running', 'scant', '89', 'minutes', 'less', 'five', 'Oscar-winning', 'actors', 'standard', 'cookie-cutter', 'story', 'commitment-phobic', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'visit', 'four', 'divorced', 'parents', 'Christmas', 'day', 'Co-written', 'first-timers', 'Matt', 'Allen', 'Caleb', 'Wilson', 'Jon', 'Lucas', 'Scott', 'Moore', 'who', 'co-wroteThe', 'Hangover', 'premise', 'promise', 'Kate', 'Brad', 'pair', 'self-satisfied', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'San', 'Franciscans', 'meeting', 'what', 'first', 'time', 'bar', 'sharp-tongued', 'banter', 'out', 'be', 'role-playing', 'fantasy', 'are', 'three', 'years', 'comfortable', 'relationship', 'major', 'fog', 'blanket', 'city', 'plans', 'holiday', 'vacation', 'Fiji', 'What', 'worse', 'are', 'caught', 'local', 'news', 'camera', 'airport', 'deceived', 'families', 'thinking', 'were', 'traveling', 'overseas', 'help', 'starving', 'third-world', 'children', 'embark', 'daylong', 'journey', 'parent', 'houses', 'conveniently', 'located', 'Bay', 'Area.However', 'movie', 'decline', 'precipitously', 'visit', 'first', 'home', 'couple', 'drops', 'belongs', 'Brad', 'redneck', 'father', 'where', 'other', 'sons', 'cage-fighting', 'brothers', 'Denver', 'Dallas', 'tackle', 'Brad', 'painful', 'wrestling', 'moves', 'uncomfortable', 'gift', 'exchange', 'where', 'Brad', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'humiliate', 'blue-collar', 'family', 'couple', 'then', 'Kate', 'overly', 'affectionate', 'mother', 'den', 'cougars', 'episode', 'revealed', 'Kate', 'had', 'childhood', 'weight', 'problem', 'possible', 'lesbian', 'past', 'Brad', 'therapist', 'mother', 'next', 'itinerary', 'still', 'angry', 'married', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'age', 'game', 'Taboo', 'communication', 'gulf', 'really', 'Kate', 'Brad', 'last', 'stop', 'home', 'Kate', 'father', 'where', 'tone', 'serious-minded', 'couple', 'lesson', 'value', 'being', 'family', 'spite', 'personal', 'differences', 'may', 'exist', 'divide', 'rest', 'year.Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'semi-improvised', 'riffing', 'exacting', 'intelligence', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'absurdly', 'mismatched', 'spar', 'convincingly', 'even', 'do', 'look', 'more', 'best', 'friends', 'lovers', 'Vaughn', 'shine', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'scene', 'where', 'limelight', 'ham-fisted', 'stage', 'debut', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'play', 'parents', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'only', 'Duvall', 'much', 'impression', 'embittered', 'shell', 'man', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'gamely', 'play', 'various', 'relatives', 'equally', 'smallish', 'roles', 'whole', 'venture', 'directed', 'Seth', 'Gordon', 'only', 'previous', 'feature-length', 'credit', 'critically', 'praised', 'video-game', 'documentary', 'King', 'Kong', 'Fistful', 'Quarters', 'storytelling', 'inexperience', 'shows', 'sometimes', 'ADD-level', 'pacing', 'story', '2009', 'DVD', 'being', 'released', 'holidays', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'terms', 'extras', 'other', 'two', 'different', 'screen', 'formats']",Four Christmases (DVD)

1177668,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B001CTA1UM,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","I thoughtFour Christmaseswas pretty funny. Stupid humor to be sure, but entertaining. The plot revolves around a dating couple who has to visit the households of their divorced parents - four houses in all. Each family unit has its own idiosyncrasies and grief. One of the things I liked about the film was that, in using four families, it seemed to capture so many of the awkward situations that make Christmas so uncomfortable for people - from showing old photo albums to introducing new boyfriends. The situations were pretty extreme to be sure, but also captured something of the truth of families. The best line was Robert Duvall's: ""You can't spell families without LIES."" That sums it up.Reese Witherspoon gives a terrific performance, as always. However, I was pleasantly surprised that, with some exceptions, the rest of the cast was equally strong, including Robert Duvall and Jon Voight. I thought Vince Vaughn was a disappointment, as he usually is. He fits some comedic roles, but his range isn't wide enough. I just had trouble seeing him as the yuppie lawyer he was supposed to be in the film. He had some funny roles, but also seemed to be trying too hard.Vaughn's casting for the co-lead role, plus the film's denouement, forced me to give the film 4 rather than 5 stars. I felt like the movie died down near the end. It became predictable and boring, with the inevitable fight and reconciliation. Worst of all, it lost its comedic nature.

Of course like I do when actually at the movies I completely enjoyed it and found it hilarious. So time went by and I waited for the DVD release that seemed to never come. Finally it arrived and of course I bought it and went on to watch it with every one again, this time instead of my mom coming down to Texas to visit us we were [are as of now] in Maryland to visit her. So this time joining all of us was my step dad, sister, and the grandparents. And like the first time I found it very funny as did the rest in the room.Brad and Kate spend every holiday away from their families and go on vacations, giving the families ridiculous reasons why they are not there. That is until one year on Christmas the flights are all cancelled, two sets of parents each, Christmas here we come. From understanding parent to violent siblings that seem to want their downfall. Ex friends with parents and others who are very active in very weird ways [you'll see]. Brad and Kate have to battle the families and try to stay sane, and stay together, ""mistletoe"".Watching it now I can see were some flaws are but over all this is a very enjoyable film that is really funny. Although as it goes along it becomes less funny and more serious with each family visited but it is still very good. Vince Vaughn is perfect for this film as his charisma and style really adds to the over flow of the film. Also his interaction with his family is hilarious, more so than Witherspoon's. Don't get me wrong because Reese does an excellent job on this film but her side of the story is the more dramatic side. Robert Duvall is great as Brad's hard feeling father and Sissy Spacek is great as the good natured mother. Brad's brothers played marvelously by Jon Favreau and country singer Tim McGraw are absolutely brilliant as MMA fighters.Speaking of country singers Dwight Yoakam is excellent as well as the preacher who is wife Kate's mother played wonderfully by Mary Steenburgen. Jon Voight plays her father and is the sanest parent of the group. As matter of fact all of the family members in this film are brilliant, the whole cast is great to be honest. Director Seth Gordon did a good job with the film although it starts to lack as it goes along. That could of course been a script problem as far as story with the many writers on this.Still I found this film to be very funny and very well acted so I really can't complain since most Christmas movies lately have not been up to par with past classics. Would I say this is a holiday classic, no, but it is still worth owning in my opinion. The film starts very funny and remains funny throughout but it does get dramatic half way through and towards the end.

The great advantage of Blu-ray shown in 1080p is that one feels like an observer to an event in real lie or real time. City hotels ought to insert brochures in the Blu-ray edition of this Seth Gordon comedy because it was every thing I could do to resist booking a trip to the city by the bay throughout the film.Four Christmases is a silly romantic comedy with first rate actors and a third rate script. How many films can get  Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughan, Mary Steenburgen Sissy Spacek,  Robert Duval, and Jon Voight in one cast? Added to those stars are folks like Tim McGraw, whose hilarious portrayal of brother Dallas suggests we will see as well as hear him in the future, and Dwight Yoakum, as Pastor Phil, a dead on New Age evangelist.The problem is that while the situation has great potential-unmarried hedonists caught forced by circumstance to spend Christmas Day with four sets of parents-the writers or director Gordon resorted to slapstick rather thanlet the emotional conflict of such circumstances carry the film. Do we need five minutes of brothers Dallas and Denver wrestling with Vaughan, whose real name turns out to be Orlando, not Bradley? Why does an An Academy Award winning actress like Reese Witherspoon need to conquer her fear of a ""jump jump"" to find out if she is pregnant?

1177694,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001CTA1UM,Jason,"[2, 6]","To the amazement of all their friends, two shallow, unencumbered lovers (Vaughn and Witherspoon), plan vacations every year instead of the agonizing experience of visiting their families.  They're opposed to the visits because each of their parents are divorced, and their families dysfunctional.  Appeasing their relatives through a barrage of excuses, they happily globetrot across the holidays away.  When at the airport for their trip to Fiji weather causes cancellation of their flight (ironic that their excuses ultimately get derailed by an industry known also for making excuses), the couple ends up on the evening news, and the web of deceit unravels.  Next up: four Christmas celebrations with four stereotypical families.Family #1: Poorly trained, pot-bellied, hillbillies who practice mixed martial artsFamily #2: Religious fanatics who all but swing around live snakesFamily #3: Borderline incestuous hippiesFamily #4: Repentant father and his unsubtle life lessons amidst a Norman Rockwell painting of life (queue the deep thoughts and life altering moments)Vince Vaughn typically witty, delivering one-liners, quips, and soon-to-be additions to urbandictionary (i.e. pulling the goalie).  His performance at a religious revival with Family #2 was as funny as it was brave; challenging the church in any capacity is questionable at best.  Reese Witherspoon rehashes her role from Sweet Home Alabama, only this time she does it without the Alabama.Ultimately, the hilarious in this movie is inversely relational to the sappy.  The light of humor dwindles amidst the sweeping night of Vaughn and Witherspoon realizing they are ""missing out"" by not having a family, and eventually decays into a feeble attempt at being touching.  The problem is that neither the comedy nor the drama takes hold, and this movie gets stuck in the purgatory that sometimes occurs in the rom-com world.  The various supporting roles are superb, with Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voigt to name a few.Watch it on Christmas if you have already seenA Christmas Storya handful of times, and you can't stop saying, ""You'll shoot your eye out.""",3,"Bah, Humbug.",1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,2135,"['amazement', 'friends', 'two', 'shallow', 'unencumbered', 'lovers', 'Vaughn', 'Witherspoon', 'plan', 'vacations', 'year', 'instead', 'agonizing', 'experience', 'visiting', 'families', ""'re"", 'opposed', 'visits', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'families', 'dysfunctional', 'Appeasing', 'relatives', 'barrage', 'excuses', 'happily', 'globetrot', 'holidays', 'away', 'When', 'airport', 'trip', 'Fiji', 'weather', 'cancellation', 'flight', 'ironic', 'excuses', 'ultimately', 'get', 'derailed', 'industry', 'known', 'also', 'making', 'excuses', 'couple', 'up', 'evening', 'news', 'web', 'deceit', 'unravels', 'Next', 'four', 'Christmas', 'celebrations', 'four', 'stereotypical', 'families.Family', '1', 'Poorly', 'trained', 'pot-bellied', 'hillbillies', 'who', 'practice', 'mixed', 'martial', 'artsFamily', '2', 'Religious', 'fanatics', 'who', 'swing', 'around', 'live', 'snakesFamily', '3', 'Borderline', 'incestuous', 'hippiesFamily', '4', 'Repentant', 'father', 'unsubtle', 'life', 'lessons', 'amidst', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'painting', 'life', 'queue', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'life', 'altering', 'moments', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'typically', 'witty', 'delivering', 'one-liners', 'quips', 'soon-to-be', 'additions', 'urbandictionary', 'i.e', 'pulling', 'goalie', 'performance', 'religious', 'revival', 'Family', '2', 'was', 'as', 'funny', 'was', 'brave', 'challenging', 'church', 'capacity', 'questionable', 'best', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'role', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'only', 'time', 'Alabama.Ultimately', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'inversely', 'relational', 'sappy', 'light', 'humor', 'dwindles', 'amidst', 'sweeping', 'night', 'Vaughn', 'Witherspoon', 'realizing', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'not', 'having', 'family', 'eventually', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'being', 'touching', 'problem', 'comedy', 'drama', 'hold', 'movie', 'stuck', 'purgatory', 'rom-com', 'world', 'various', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'superb', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Jon', 'Voigt', 'name', 'few.Watch', 'Christmas', 'have', 'already', 'seenA', 'Christmas', 'Storya', 'handful', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'saying', ""'ll"", 'shoot', 'eye', 'out']",Four Christmases (DVD)

This is merely a funny and silly movie, with no malice toward Christianity or anyone else. I was not insulted or offended, and trust me, I know when they are out to insult me. Which is often! For 90 minutes I was amused, entertained, surprised, and tickled. The Nativity and Christ are not what is being made fun of here folks, and if you cannot tell the difference, you are in trouble. What is being satirized is the gooey cultish worship service that venerates the charismatic pastor, thrives on emotion, and celebrates glitz rather than Christ. And to put a couple of self-absorbed jerks into this stage play makes perfect sense in the context of this tale. A Christian should be offended by the pastor's behavior, not that of the yuppies. He should know better; they don't.The supporting cast was glorious, with nearly everyone working their weirdo mojo perfectly. Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek ARE their characters, filling every nook and cranny of personhood with a believable and real behavior. Kristin Chenoweth, so wonderful in Pushing Daisies, is again sufficiently bubbly to be engaging and sufficiently odd to be quite offputting. She is a hoot! Where Four Christmases failed with me was in the stars themselves. Both Vince and Reese didn't really inhabit these roles. Any comparable actor/actress could have played these parts with the same oomph.But this is minor. With lots of belly laughs, lots of fiendishly clever throw-away lines, (my favorite, ""And how are you, little lady?"") and enough sight gags to populate a Laurel and Hardy festival, this film offered a quality evening's entertainment.

1177704,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B001CTA1UM,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[2, 4]","Vince Vaughn seems to be going down the same path of Will Ferrell.  Two funny guys who apparently have a one dimensional ability to keep you laughing only within the spectrum of specific circumstances.  Four Christmases was not that venue.  While I admittedly did let a burst of chuckling escape now and again it was more of the slapstick comedy than anything the actor might have done.  I am a little surprised that Reese Witherspoon participated in a movie of this nature.  She always seemed more seasoned and above a swing and a complete miss such as this.Damn, now that sounds harsh doesn't it?  Let me back up a little.  It was a Sunday evening, my fantasy football team had lost, knocking out any glimmer that I had of the playoffs and I was tired from drinking a little too much the night before.  It is surprising how a little wine can knock you for a loop when you don't drink that much.  You get dinged for drinking in excess and you get dinged when you don't drink enough.  You just can't win anymore can you?So we rented a movie to go with the theme of Thanksgiving since I had watched a total of four in the span of four days.  I seem to go in spurts of movie watching and I am smack in the middle of an episode.  My girlfriend and I don't always agree with our first choices so we settled on Four Christmases as a compromise.  It seemed light hearted and we always like a good laugh.  My first choice was the GI Joe movie but she vetoed that immediately.  I guess I will have to watch that one today while she is out and enjoy it in the quite solitude as I crank the volume on high.Four Christmases is about a man a woman who are living together and are so removed from family feelings they don't even have the desire to get married.  They spend their holidays on various beaches lying to their families so they don't have to venture back home.  Both sets of both parents are divorced so they have in total four houses for Christmas.  As luck would have it their flight gets canceled and they are they get interviewed on TV at the airport.  Their families' view the nightly news and they find themselves stuck seeing all four parents for one Christmas holiday.  Are you stressed yet?  It is difficult seeing one set of parents, it might kill you to see that much family all in one day.As you might expect everyone is the most dysfunctional insane people you might find anywhere on the planet.  I wonder how these two turned out normal at all.  The couple goes through the typical road bump that faces all couples in romantic comedies and they then figure out how to proceed in life.  Ah, isn't it good that everything always works out in the end.It was a little short on common sense and the believability of almost anyone was stretched.  Nobody has that many messed up people in one family.  Somebody needs to be normal to keep the peace.  Laughs were physical acts of babies puking and falling off of roofs.  It just didn't have any depth at all.

And I said, ""But look who is in it! It has five -- FIVE -- Oscar-winning actors. The ending song is by Tom Petty. I love Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn. It has to be better than this trailer. I hate trailers."" So then we launch into why they are called trailers, when what the studios do is play them BEFORE you see the movie. Talk about putting the cart before the horse.But I digress.This time the trailer had it right. I was sure there had to be more. I was wrong.It starts kind of promising, with a fake meet cute between the two leads. They seem extremely shallow and self-centered, but that could be funny. It never got funny. On my notepad I kept writing down ""I hate these people.""The story revolves around a day in which the leads have to travel to each of their four parent's houses to celebrate Christmas. At the beginning, they come up with an escape word, so if things get too unbearable they just say the word and know it's time to leave. That word is ""mistletoe."" Inexplicably, they only say the word a couple of times.One thing that surprised me was that the movie sort of hated women. I lost count of the number of times and ways women were put down. With the likes of Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen and Reese Witherspoon in on this, I'm just sitting there, in wonderment.The last straw? In the closing credits I noticed one of the executive producers is Peter Billingsley, and that he plays a small part in the movie. Do you know who that is? The blond kid with glasses fromA Christmas Storythat really really wanted a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. None other than Ralphie himself.Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

From the randy grandma character (""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Wedding Singer"" . . . seriously, why do writers NEVER get sick of this character?  It's not remotely funny anymore.) to the bonehead brothers to the father who resents his son's success, the gang is all here.  Vince Vaughn does his usual oblivious insensitive boyfriend thing and the script these cardboard cut-out characters are given to work with hits you over the head with its obvious themes of family, bonding and babies.  After the ""perfect"" couple show off their vibrant sex life (pretending to meet at a bar as strangers and getting it on in a bathroom) and give a giant anti-kids and marriage speech, you already know that this entire movie will be devoted to quickly changing at least one of their minds about all their ideas of what happiness is supposed to be.  And so Reese Witherspoon is handed a baby at practically every house, so she can suddenly start thinking ""Gee, I guess I'm missing out on something with my successful relationship and career.  I'd better get knocked up or I'll never feel fulfilled as a woman!""  And at every house, they get to see a couple that ""really know each other,"" no matter how poor or uneducated they may be, to drive home the point that the two leads don't really know each other at all, despite being together for three years.  Their favorite thing to do when they're together is pretend to be other people, get it?  They were never really themselves, and therefore their relationship is flawed.  You can figure out for yourself how the rest this sap-fest movie ends.You know what I'd love to see?  Just once, a movie where a woman realizes that it's okay to live a life without children to ""fulfill"" her and to start realizing instead that kids are expensive, smelly, whiny, fatigue-inducing ungrateful little germ-infested noisemakers who drain both your sanity and your wallet that you're stuck with for the rest of your life, and then waltz off into the sunset living happily ever after while her friends sacrifice their vacations and dreams so they can sock money away into a college fund that their kid will decide not to use when they drop out after one semester to join a rock band.But hey, that's just me and I have weird tastes.  I like movies where I can't see every twist coming and don't leave it feeling as if someone's force-fed me enough sugar to put me into a diabetic coma.

It was definitely a comedy, but it wasn't terribly romantic.  For me that was no major deal because most romances can almost be too formulaic in a holiday movie anyway.As the movie begins, Kate and Brad seem like a married couple who like to explore all kinds of activities together.  They look like an absolute fun couple who are trying to take the biggest bite of life that they can.  At first this seems refreshing but as they share about their feelings against marriage with others, they start to get more and more unlikeable.  It was actually kind of weird.When the weather causes their annual Christmas getaway to be put on the back burner, Kate and Brad instead visit their family who they have actively avoided spending the holidays with.  Each visit gives us a little glimpse into who Brad and Kate are as well as their families.  As both have divorced parents and are fairly dysfunctional, you can kind of see why they are not married themselves.Overall, considering the actors in the film, I really expected more.  Obviously they didn't write the dialogue nor direct it, but still there just was too much missing.  It was funny in parts but not that funny and it completely lacked warmth which is something I would expect in a holiday film.  Even when redeemed, these characters were not terribly likeable.Because of the actors and title, I would have thought this would be a family friendly film.  I am not a prude when it comes to movies, but I would say that this is not one I would share with my son.  It isn't over the top in sexual nature, but there are moments that would require conversations that I don't think any of the kids in my family would be interested in having.

For some, how true that is, for what can be funnier than a dysfunctional family during the holidays?  The answer is - two dysfunctional families during the holidays.  And what's funnier yet is being obligated to visit both families twice - hence four Christmases.Well what else can you do if your parents are divorced and your partner's parents are also divorced?  You have to visit both Mom and Dad, with common family members gathering at each parent's home, and you have to do the same for your partner.  This is especially true when you get caught on national television trying to escape the country for a Christmas vacation rather than commit yourself to family bonding.  And after a glimpse of their happy families, we can hardly blame them.A situation like this is bound to be funny, yet it fell short from the classic Christmas comedies like Christmas Vacation and Home Alone.  While there was one attempt by the girl's father, played by Jon Voigt, to restore warmth to the holiday and meaning to family, the sentiment was not great enough to cement the gaps between madness and emotion.  This was made clear in the last scene when the couple gets caught again on camera while trying to hide a secret from their families.Still, this light-hearted comedy is worth a few laughs.

The couple has to go each of their parents' respective homes (both sets of parents divorced) and watches their bond get tested by Brad's overly-aggressive dad Howard (Robert Duvall), Kate's born-again (and perhaps too-informative) mom Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen) and her pastor husband Phil (Dwight Yoakam), amd Brad's cradle-robbing mom Paula (Sissy Spacek).  During this time, it becomes exposed with how little they know about each other and their own thoughts and fears.  Can they escape the holidays unscathed or are they going to be forced to either change their relationship or breakup?

I recall seeing this film on its premiere night way back when and thought it was not too bad a flick.I was expecting,as most so called 'comedies' are these days,something smarmy,and putting out with the quick witticisms and all,but it was just a little different enough to be able to enjoy it.The story introduces us to an unmarried ""modern"" couple,Brad and Kate.Christmas is almost here and neither have spent a Christmas at any of their parents(all divorced)for at least three years now.They are a totally self indulgent couple,who love each other and tend to constantly analyze every minutiae of their relationship,in the most clinical and politically correct of terminology.They are certainly imaginative,because as the film opens the two are role playing in a bar(we don't know that until the scenario plays itself out).Brad comes up to Kate posing as a geeky mid westerner,totally unsure of himself.Kate listens then proceeds to blow his lame lines and him right out of the water.As she walks away he starts coming on like macho gangbusters and before you know it the two are making out in a washroom.The next day the two are packing for and going to the airport,to catch a flight to Fiji.They each take turns phoning their relatives with another lame excuse about going to help out the indigenous population on a charitable flight.However this is San Francisco and the weather conspires to fog them in and get their flight cancelled for a day.And to boot they are interviewed on television,which each and every relative sees.Now they are obliged to go Christmas visiting to their relatives whether they like it or not.The first stop is Brad's father's home(Duvall),where he lives with Brad's two brothers and one of their pregnant wives.Both brothers act like fugitives from the WWE,with Brad as the brunt of their antics.The next one they see is Kate's mother(Steenburgen)who is there with HER mother and Kate's sister.Brad gets along alright but Kate,not so well.The next parent on the list is Brad's mother(Spacek),ho is shacked up with Brad's old boyhood best friend,so things don't go so well there.With each parent's visit,the two come to learn some awkward things about the other and themselves,which slowly raises tensions between the two.By the time they reach the final parent,Kate's father(Voight),the two are not speaking and Brad doesn't want to even come in,so leaves to go to his father's house.When Brad hears his father say that he is actually just like him,that is the straw which breaks the camels back and he returns to Kate to apologize and make up.And of course with making up comes the gentle toned,couple-self-analysis both are so good at doing.A year passes and the two have a new baby,on New Years day at that.A nurse asks about their families reaction and they say they haven't told them yet.The film ends as a TV camera crew comes in wanting to talk to the parents of the first new born of the year.I found the humour to be well maintained throughout the picture.Their self analytical and politically correct approach and calm demeanours,when discussing anything related to their relationship,never fails to tickle the funny bone.Their families are a totally dysfunctional lot,which makes the two's mature personalities even more stark in contrast.The film is edited well and all actors involved do a a good job in their roles.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.All in all a surprisingly good Christmas film.This is NOT a film for the kiddies,but geared towards a more mature audience of say 17-18 years and up,due to the content.It does stay smart and punchy throughout and the acting is solid.Recommended.3 1/2- 4 stars.",4,A surprisingly good Xmas

1177766,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B001CTA1UM,Spider Monkey,"[1, 1]","`Four Christmases' is a pretty funny comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon and is about a couple who decide to go holiday each year rather than spend time with their four divorced parents. Unfortunately this year their flight gets grounded and their usually calm and placid relationship is turned upside down by visiting the various families and the revelations that are uncovered. There are a few laughs throughout but nothing that will have you holding your sides or panting for breath and although this is marketed as a Christmas movie, it is merely the backdrop to the events that unfold. It could be any major family event or national holiday to be honest. The performances are all pretty good and the cast is impressive as well, with Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voight and Sissy Spacek as supporting cast. At just over 85 minutes this is short enough to be funny without being wearing and you don't have enough time to get bored. The direction is simple and not that noteworthy, just run of the mill comedy fare the whole way through. If you want a light hearted comedy, with the odd toilet or sex joke and nothing you have to think too hard about then this is the place to go.

As we follow them on their unplanned journey the laughs start right out but it tempers off into a spattering of schmaltz, sap and an overwhelming need to make it a baby story (although the alternate ending was better in staying away from this).The Blu clarity shows some beautiful Bay Area skylines, but the CGI falters with all of the car driving interiors and fake fog at SFO. The sound was uneventful, but was clear enough to hear the edits and bad voice-overs in certain scenes. The supplements are what gives this 3.5-star film a little bump.* 10:30 minute making of. Clip heavy and reliant on some fluffy interviews from most of the cast. The prevalent theme is everyone had ""fun"" making this.* 13:00 minute HBO First Look. Very clip heavy and the few remaining bits are average.* 9:00 minutes of deleted scenes. Forgettable except for the alternate ending where they focus on the adults (in the future) instead of being about having a kid.* 10:00 minute 7 Layers of Holiday Meals. A cooking channelish clip with Katy Mixon (much funnier inEastbound & Down: The Complete First Season) and a host making their dip - tried to enjoy it but was just painfully awkward.* 2:30 minute gag reel. Now this was how the film should have been - this relaxed and genuinely funny. Reese Witherspoon has a beautiful smile and we never see it once in this film, but she lit up the gag reel here. It was nice to see Favreau and Vaughn have those funny moments on screen together even though it was not in the film. Skip all of the other supplements and just watch this one.The second disc is the Digital Copy and the code gets you another hit at their site towards getting that free BD from Warner.

1177786,AP3B615GM191G,B001CTA1UM,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","This film has the perfect setup to be a big hit...it comes out on DVD over the holidays when (many) people are, after a day or two, trying to get away from the relatives for awhile, and the plot even centers on that same subject matter!  Yet, through a multitude of problems, first and foremost being the continued dumbing down of what people must think is funny, it fails to resonate on any level.Basically, the story sees a couple (played by Reece Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn) trying to escape their holiday family get-togethers due to tension from both sets of parents.  However, when their flight to Fiji is cancelled due to fog, they are forced to spend the day at four different homes (both sets of their parents are divorced) celebrating Christmas.  They meet a wide variety of odd characters and even begin to drift away from each other once past secrets begin to be revealed.While that may sound like an interesting concept, it just doesn't get off the group.  First, the lead couple, though played by the very competent Witherspoon and Vaughn, are so unlikable that you really can't get drawn into their relationship.  In fact, you may actually root AGAINST them as they are so annoying.  Secondly, the auxiliary family members that should bring the comedy to the film are, in actually, quite annoying themselves also.  Not until the last home do you get a touch of interesting character development, but by then you really don't care anymore.However, the biggest problem with the entire film is that it relies on far too many sight gags and an over abundance of crude humor.  The scenes in the film that should get the biggest laughs involve ""Vaughn"" falling off a roof, a breast pump, and a baby vomiting.  Now I suppose that when it comes to humor it's sort of ""to each his own"", but personally I feel that resorting to that type of humor is a cheap way to get a chuckle (if that) and doesn't really endear itself to viewers.Thus, here is the real test of whether or not I found this to be enjoyable whatsoever: After finishing it, I flipped around my cable TV and found two great films on...Father of the Bride and When Harry Met Sally.  After just 15 minutes of flipping back and forth between those two, I had more laughs than during the entire 88 minutes of Four Christmases.",2,The Continued Dumbing Down Of Comedy,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,2293,"['film', 'perfect', 'setup', 'be', 'big', 'hit', 'out', 'DVD', 'holidays', 'when', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'day', 'two', 'trying', 'get', 'away', 'relatives', 'awhile', 'plot', 'even', 'centers', 'same', 'subject', 'matter', 'multitude', 'problems', 'first', 'foremost', 'being', 'continued', 'dumbing', 'down', 'what', 'people', 'must', 'think', 'funny', 'resonate', 'level.Basically', 'story', 'couple', 'played', 'Reece', 'Witherspoon', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'trying', 'escape', 'holiday', 'family', 'get-togethers', 'due', 'tension', 'sets', 'parents', 'However', 'when', 'flight', 'Fiji', 'cancelled', 'due', 'fog', 'are', 'forced', 'spend', 'day', 'four', 'different', 'homes', 'sets', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'celebrating', 'Christmas', 'meet', 'wide', 'variety', 'odd', 'characters', 'even', 'begin', 'drift', 'away', 'other', 'once', 'past', 'secrets', 'begin', 'be', 'revealed.While', 'may', 'sound', 'interesting', 'concept', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'group', 'First', 'lead', 'couple', 'played', 'very', 'competent', 'Witherspoon', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'so', 'unlikable', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'drawn', 'relationship', 'fact', 'may', 'actually', 'root', 'AGAINST', 'are', 'so', 'annoying', 'Secondly', 'auxiliary', 'family', 'members', 'should', 'bring', 'comedy', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'annoying', 'also', 'Not', 'last', 'home', 'do', 'get', 'touch', 'interesting', 'character', 'development', 'then', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore.However', 'biggest', 'problem', 'entire', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'sight', 'gags', 'over', 'abundance', 'crude', 'humor', 'scenes', 'film', 'should', 'get', 'biggest', 'involve', 'Vaughn', 'falling', 'off', 'roof', 'breast', 'pump', 'baby', 'vomiting', 'Now', 'suppose', 'when', 'humor', 'sort', 'own', 'personally', 'feel', 'resorting', 'type', 'humor', 'cheap', 'way', 'get', 'chuckle', ""n't"", 'really', 'endear', 'viewers.Thus', 'here', 'real', 'test', 'not', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'whatsoever', 'finishing', 'flipped', 'cable', 'TV', 'found', 'two', 'great', 'films', 'Father', 'Bride', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'just', '15', 'minutes', 'flipping', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'had', 'more', 'laughs', 'entire', '88', 'minutes', 'Four', 'Christmases']",Four Christmases (DVD)
