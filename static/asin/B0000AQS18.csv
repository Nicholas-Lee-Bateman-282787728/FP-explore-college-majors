767026,A374OO1EAUZASC,B0000AQS18,2201,"[2, 2]","Definately the best season of Buffy.  Season 3 is a close runner up, but Season 5 takes the gold.Plot/Spoilers: The season starts out on the high note left over from Season 4.  The gang are all friends, Buffy has a wonderful mother and obscenely perfect boyfriend in Riley (Marc Blucas.)  The first episode is pure gold, where Buffy finally gets to battle Dracula himself.  Of course, hilarity ensues and she wins.  Enter the complication: Dracula seemed to know more about being a Slayer than she did.  At the end of the episode, two important things happen: Buffy makes a reprochement with Giles and asks him to once again be her Watcher.  Then...when she gets home...she has a sister!  The sister, Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) is the first of many complications in the season.  As the season goes on, Buffy's life gets more and more complicated.  Turns out Dawn is actually mystical in origin, and this season's ""Big Bad,"" Glory is out for her blood--literally.  Buffy later loses Riley through her own pig-headedness and right when she's getting over that--her mother dies.  As Buffy's life crashes around her, Glory and her minions inch closer to taking Dawn away too.  Buffy has to face what she is--the Slayer--and make a decision that ultimately leads to her death.Character development is the #1 reason I call this the best season of Buffy.  The non-Slayer part of Buffy essentially grows up way too fast in this season, going from care-free college student to a numb, depressed single guardian of her little sister.  Xander matures greatly, from bumbling side-kick and butt of jokes (""the funny syphillis"") into a respectable man with a good job and talent.  Willow goes from the meek and mousey girl we knew in seasons 1-4 to a confident, strong woman.  Riley went from all-American good boy to taking a walk on the wildside and then going away...Giles changes from blundering mid-life-crisis-man into a darker patriarchical figure, and Spike goes from the whacky neighbor to the most tragic character of the piece.  Not to mention that Dawn's character was very rapidly developed from whiney brat to extremely disturbed adolescent in just a few episodes.It wasn't all darkness & responsiblity though.  Lots of comedy rounded out the near-perfection of season 5.  Particularly, the BuffyBot showcased both the humor of the writers and the talent of the actors.  Harmony also made some quite hilarious guest appearances and the Willow/Anya rivalry was portrayed in way that you could laugh at their immaturity.Best Episode: The BodyMost Emotional: The Body, The Gift, Into the Woods, Forever.Funniest episodes: Buffy -vs- Dracula, I Was Made to Love You, Crush, Intervention, TriangleMost Enduring: The Body, The Gift, The Replacement, Fool for Love",5,Top of the arc,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,2759,"['Definately', 'best', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Season', '3', 'close', 'runner', 'up', 'Season', '5', 'gold.Plot/Spoilers', 'season', 'out', 'high', 'note', 'left', 'over', 'Season', '4', 'gang', 'are', 'friends', 'Buffy', 'wonderful', 'mother', 'obscenely', 'perfect', 'boyfriend', 'Riley', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'first', 'episode', 'pure', 'gold', 'where', 'Buffy', 'finally', 'battle', 'Dracula', 'course', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'Enter', 'complication', 'Dracula', 'seemed', 'know', 'more', 'being', 'Slayer', 'did', 'end', 'episode', 'two', 'important', 'things', 'happen', 'Buffy', 'reprochement', 'Giles', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'Watcher', 'Then', 'when', 'home', 'sister', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'first', 'many', 'complications', 'season', 'season', 'Buffy', 'life', 'more', 'more', 'complicated', 'out', 'Dawn', 'actually', 'mystical', 'origin', 'season', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Glory', 'out', 'blood', 'literally', 'Buffy', 'later', 'Riley', 'own', 'pig-headedness', 'right', 'when', 'getting', 'over', 'mother', 'Buffy', 'life', 'crashes', 'Glory', 'minions', 'inch', 'closer', 'taking', 'Dawn', 'away', 'too', 'Buffy', 'face', 'what', 'Slayer', 'make', 'decision', 'ultimately', 'death.Character', 'development', '1', 'reason', 'call', 'best', 'season', 'Buffy', 'non-Slayer', 'part', 'Buffy', 'essentially', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'season', 'going', 'care-free', 'college', 'student', 'numb', 'depressed', 'single', 'guardian', 'little', 'sister', 'Xander', 'greatly', 'bumbling', 'side-kick', 'butt', 'jokes', 'funny', 'syphillis', 'respectable', 'man', 'good', 'job', 'talent', 'Willow', 'meek', 'mousey', 'girl', 'knew', 'seasons', '1-4', 'confident', 'strong', 'woman', 'Riley', 'went', 'all-American', 'good', 'boy', 'taking', 'walk', 'wildside', 'then', 'going', 'away', 'Giles', 'changes', 'blundering', 'mid-life-crisis-man', 'darker', 'patriarchical', 'figure', 'Spike', 'whacky', 'neighbor', 'most', 'tragic', 'character', 'piece', 'Not', 'mention', 'Dawn', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'rapidly', 'developed', 'whiney', 'brat', 'extremely', 'disturbed', 'adolescent', 'just', 'few', 'episodes.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'darkness', 'responsiblity', 'Lots', 'comedy', 'rounded', 'out', 'near-perfection', 'season', '5', 'Particularly', 'BuffyBot', 'showcased', 'humor', 'writers', 'talent', 'actors', 'Harmony', 'also', 'made', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Willow/Anya', 'rivalry', 'was', 'portrayed', 'way', 'could', 'laugh', 'immaturity.Best', 'Episode', 'BodyMost', 'Emotional', 'Body', 'Gift', 'Into', 'Woods', 'Forever.Funniest', 'Buffy', '-vs-', 'Dracula', 'Was', 'Made', 'Love', 'Crush', 'Intervention', 'TriangleMost', 'Enduring', 'Body', 'Gift', 'Replacement', 'Fool', 'Love']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

767028,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0000AQS18,A. Burchfield,"[1, 7]","In the 7 years that it was on television Buffy the Vampire Slayer did manage to be all over the place in writing quality and plots but 5th season is one of the best of the 7.I thought Buffy vs. Dracula was pretty stupid, but did like the way Dawn was sprung on us. Glory was prehaps the best villain of the entire series, managing to be evil, tough and serious with several comical bits thrown in. Examples of this would be when Willow and Tara transported her miles away and to high altitude (Glory goes ""Oh Shi-!,as she falls to Earth) and the truck encounter with Buffy. In this one after she's caught up with Dawn and Buffy she's told by Buffy ""I've got just one word to say to you Glory- Truck""as Glory is knocked down the street by a passing 18 wheeler.Some of the battles are also very good if a bit inconsistent. Over the years Buffy has taken several beatings being injured to various degrees and sometimes had an awful time just beating a single Vampire. During 5th season Buffy really gets knocked around by Glory, takes some amazing falls and blows, but doesn't seem to suffer like she had in the past. I especially liked two of the battles, in the 1st Buffy has just split up with Riley and runs into the pack of Vampires whose home she'd torched, for a girl whose been known to have difficulty with 1 Vampire she takes out I think 8 of them. The other battle is the climactic season ender in which Buffy beats Glory to a pulp and shows mercy to her (in her brother Ben human form)before going off to rescue Dawn. It was a nice touch when Giles, the nice calm good guy finishes him off becuase as he tells Ben Glory will resurface and be a danger, buffy spared her anyway because she's a hero.The list of extras that come with this set sure sound like they'll be really good.",5,"One of the best of the seasons, can't wait for it.",1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,1788,"['7', 'years', 'was', 'television', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'did', 'manage', 'be', 'place', 'writing', 'quality', 'plots', '5th', 'season', 'one', 'best', '7.I', 'thought', 'Buffy', 'Dracula', 'was', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'did', 'way', 'Dawn', 'was', 'sprung', 'Glory', 'was', 'prehaps', 'best', 'villain', 'entire', 'series', 'managing', 'be', 'evil', 'tough', 'serious', 'several', 'comical', 'bits', 'thrown', 'Examples', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'Willow', 'Tara', 'transported', 'miles', 'away', 'high', 'altitude', 'Glory', 'Oh', 'Shi-', 'Earth', 'truck', 'encounter', 'Buffy', 'one', 'caught', 'up', 'Dawn', 'Buffy', 'told', 'Buffy', ""'ve"", 'got', 'just', 'one', 'word', 'say', 'Glory-', 'Truck', 'Glory', 'knocked', 'street', 'passing', '18', 'wheeler.Some', 'battles', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'bit', 'inconsistent', 'years', 'Buffy', 'taken', 'several', 'beatings', 'being', 'injured', 'various', 'degrees', 'sometimes', 'had', 'awful', 'time', 'just', 'beating', 'single', 'Vampire', '5th', 'season', 'Buffy', 'really', 'knocked', 'Glory', 'amazing', 'falls', 'blows', ""n't"", 'seem', 'suffer', 'had', 'past', 'especially', 'liked', 'two', 'battles', '1st', 'Buffy', 'just', 'split', 'up', 'Riley', 'pack', 'Vampires', 'home', ""'d"", 'torched', 'girl', 'been', 'known', 'have', 'difficulty', '1', 'Vampire', 'out', 'think', '8', 'other', 'battle', 'climactic', 'season', 'ender', 'Buffy', 'Glory', 'pulp', 'mercy', 'brother', 'Ben', 'human', 'form', 'going', 'off', 'rescue', 'Dawn', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'when', 'Giles', 'nice', 'calm', 'good', 'guy', 'finishes', 'off', 'becuase', 'Ben', 'Glory', 'will', 'resurface', 'be', 'danger', 'buffy', 'spared', 'anyway', 'hero.The', 'list', 'extras', 'come', 'set', 'sure', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'be', 'really', 'good']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

Though this season is very uneven, there is still much enjoyment to be had.  Removing the college setting that was so prominent in Season 4 seems to have been a mistake.With fewer external conflicts to explore, the plotlines focus on inner conflicts of the Scoobies, and we see the introduction of some standard soap opera devices: the long lost sister, the evil twin, and several episodes based around a character's illness.The overall story arc also feels a bit drawn out, and doesn't feature as many twists and turns as previous seasons did.

767030,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,B0000AQS18,Adi Adler,"[2, 3]","Season 5 had a lot of potential. The series received a fresh start of a sort in season 4 with the move to college. The potential issues raised in the season would've made an interesting season.But somehow, the potential wasn't fulfilled. Don't get me wrong - a not that great Buffy is a lot greater than most of the other stuff out there. But the production team's heart didn't seem to be in the show any longer.Take the source of the Slayers' powers for instance. We got some very nice teasers for it in Season 4's 'Restless'. The thing is that I felt that teasers were the only thing I got throughout the season - and no solid buildup to the conclusion of it (which was that Buffy's powers come from her love & loyalty to her friends and family).The same goes to the Riley / Buffy relationship. We get of a few rounds of ""Riley feeling bad about his role is Buffy's life / Buffy comforts Riley / Riley isn't comforted for long and is willingly bitten by vampires), and then Boom! Riley throws an ultimatum and about 30 minutes later - he's gone.As for character development - it was patchy. Buffy had a lot of room for development with Dawn's arrival and Joyce's death, and Sarah Michelle Gellar has used that space well. Dawn's part seems to be a little too childish, but considering the fact that the part was originally meant to be a 12 years old (not 14), Michele Trachtenberg did a great job. We got to know Tara a little better, too. On the other hand, Xander, Willow and Anya didn't seem to grow much during the season. Xander finaly found a steady job & a new apartment at the beginning of the season, and there he stopped developing. We got a few hints that Willow is better & more involved in magic (a clue to future theme), and that's it. Anya seemed to be a combination punch bag for Willow and season 4's joke with a few added sensitivities.And an important note to Joss Whedon & the other writers: if Buffy keeps dying then brought back to life to often, 'death' ceases to be such a major, all important thing.I think part of the problem is that even though 'Buffy' and 'Angel' are 2 seperate shows, they share a lot of myth & characters. While rumor says that the frequent visits of 'Buffy' characters to 'Angel' helped the latter (esp. in its first season), the shared characters and expositions are certainly hurting Buffy. As someone who hasn't watched 'Angel', I certainly found large gaps in Buffy seasons 4 & 5 (things are so bad that it was extremely obvious that it's impossible to fully understand 'Buffy' without watching 'Angel').Besides this small touch of what seems like vanity on the production teams' side, the extra features were w-a-y below the standards of previous seasons. I think that this is the first time there is no commentary on the season finale. And even if we consider the fact that it's hard to find something original to do in the fifth DVD set.On the other hand, there is also a lot of good in this seasons. Joyce's ilness & death were very well executed, and well as Dawn's addition to the show.",4,A new sort of Buffy,1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,3046,"['Season', '5', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'series', 'received', 'fresh', 'start', 'sort', 'season', '4', 'move', 'college', 'potential', 'issues', 'raised', 'season', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'interesting', 'season.But', 'somehow', 'potential', 'was', ""n't"", 'fulfilled', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'great', 'Buffy', 'lot', 'greater', 'most', 'other', 'stuff', 'there', 'production', 'team', 'heart', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'show', 'longer.Take', 'source', 'Slayers', 'powers', 'instance', 'got', 'very', 'nice', 'teasers', 'Season', '4', ""'Restless"", 'thing', 'felt', 'teasers', 'were', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'season', 'solid', 'buildup', 'conclusion', 'was', 'Buffy', 'powers', 'come', 'love', 'loyalty', 'friends', 'family', '.The', 'same', 'Riley', '/', 'Buffy', 'relationship', 'get', 'few', 'rounds', 'Riley', 'feeling', 'bad', 'role', 'Buffy', 'life', '/', 'Buffy', 'Riley', '/', 'Riley', ""n't"", 'comforted', 'long', 'willingly', 'bitten', 'vampires', 'then', 'Boom', 'Riley', 'ultimatum', '30', 'minutes', 'later', 'gone.As', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'patchy', 'Buffy', 'had', 'lot', 'room', 'development', 'Dawn', 'arrival', 'Joyce', 'death', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'used', 'space', 'well', 'Dawn', 'part', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'childish', 'considering', 'fact', 'part', 'was', 'originally', 'meant', 'be', '12', 'years', 'old', 'not', '14', 'Michele', 'Trachtenberg', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'got', 'know', 'Tara', 'little', 'better', 'too', 'other', 'hand', 'Xander', 'Willow', 'Anya', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'grow', 'much', 'season', 'Xander', 'finaly', 'found', 'steady', 'job', 'new', 'apartment', 'beginning', 'season', 'there', 'stopped', 'developing', 'got', 'few', 'hints', 'Willow', 'better', 'more', 'involved', 'magic', 'clue', 'future', 'theme', 'Anya', 'seemed', 'be', 'combination', 'punch', 'bag', 'Willow', 'season', '4', 'joke', 'few', 'added', 'sensitivities.And', 'important', 'note', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'other', 'writers', 'Buffy', 'dying', 'then', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'often', 'ceases', 'be', 'major', 'important', 'thing.I', 'think', 'part', 'problem', 'even', ""'Buffy"", ""'Angel"", 'are', '2', 'seperate', 'shows', 'share', 'lot', 'myth', 'characters', 'rumor', 'frequent', 'visits', ""'Buffy"", 'characters', ""'Angel"", 'helped', 'latter', 'esp', 'first', 'season', 'shared', 'characters', 'expositions', 'are', 'certainly', 'hurting', 'Buffy', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'watched', ""'Angel"", 'certainly', 'found', 'large', 'gaps', 'Buffy', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'extremely', 'obvious', 'impossible', 'fully', 'understand', ""'Buffy"", 'watching', ""'Angel"", 'small', 'touch', 'what', 'like', 'vanity', 'production', 'teams', 'side', 'extra', 'features', 'were', 'w-a-y', 'standards', 'previous', 'seasons', 'think', 'first', 'time', 'commentary', 'season', 'finale', 'even', 'consider', 'fact', 'hard', 'find', 'something', 'original', 'do', 'fifth', 'DVD', 'set.On', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'lot', 'good', 'seasons', 'Joyce', 'ilness', 'death', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'well', 'Dawn', 'addition', 'show']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

She's very personable and seems into her character. I enjoyed her and James Marsters in the extras. The bloopers are really short. Is this because the cast is mostly on target?

767035,A5YJR3G7XMLLV,B0000AQS18,"Amazon Customer ""Reaper""","[6, 8]","Season Five is often in competition with the third season for the title of the best season of the show. The choice is a hard one to make. Buffy's third season exploited the emotional turmoil of the second season so well that people are often left in awe. In fact I often use season two's finale, and season three together to introduce new people to the show. Yet as much as that emotion grabs us and takes for a ride never to be forgotten season five edges out. Season five hits you with one twist, and then another in a beautifully constructed season story that was impossible to live up to. Season Five begins with the oldest cliche in the history of horror, Dracula. The episode is funny, and filled with laughs. A typical stand alone Buffy episode, but its ending throws us a curve we didn't expect. The arrival of Dawn. Dawn is not explained. The scoobies believe she has been there the entire time, and like season two when we learn Angel has returned to being Angelsus we can watch the scoobies unknowingly walk into harms way. The suspense and twists of the discoverying of Dawn's origin, Glory, and the meaning of family build as the scoobies become caught in the middle of war. At the same time we get to see Spike addmitt he loves Buffy, and Tara and Willow continue to grow. This season offers us the first answers about the meaning of being a slayer, and a hero. The end of season five is the only other season ending ever to catch the emotion of Becoming part two. Buffy fights against the odds till she is strained, and about to break but refuses to give up. When D.C. comics killed Superman they had a line that said how the people watching Superman's final fight would remember it to the day they died.

767037,A928WN8NV03WZ,B0000AQS18,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[2, 2]","The cast continues to grow in this season.  They introduced some interesting ideas as well as a strange new character Dawn.  Suddenly Buffy has a younger sister, but no one seems to know why.  Tragedy is also brought into the series with the illness of Buffy's mother, Joyce Summers. We also explore a lot of the characters more than in previous seasons.  We finally get to see reasons why Tara is so shy and introverted, we get more respect for xander, and we get to see Joyce turn into a more three dimensional character, rather than the slightly cliche caring mother of the past few seasons.  As well as staying with Buffy tradition of having an interesting villian, this time the vain and mysterious Glory.The only problem with this season was the opener, Buffy vs Dracula.  Season openers were always a hit or miss, but this one is a bit corny and ends too quickly.  It would have been interesting to pursue the character dracula further, perhaps making him a a big bad.I really liked this season.  The standout episodes weren't typical for Buffy.  The Body is one of the seasons highlights, which is rare for a sci fi show to be able to successfully pull off such an emotionally charged episode.  The big bad was more menacing despite her petty attitude and vanity.  She was seemingly invulnerable and had a group of demon worshippers and crazy slaves.  This season has more of a desperate feel to it.  The gang is outclassed for most of the season and they feel it, if not outright say it. They intended this originally to be the final season, and it shows.  The final is one of the best in the series.Season Highlights:Replacement:  Xander is hit with a deomons weapon and returns to find that someone who looks like him is already living his life.  It becomes stranger when he finds out that it is the real him, the weapon split him into a higher and a lower self.  This gives you insight into xanders potential and improved my respect for him.No Place Like Home:  Joyce is getting ill and Buffy believes the cause to be a supernatural attack against her family.  She goes into a trance and finds something distubing, Joyce isn't being affected by anything magic, and Dawn isn't really her sister.  You also get to see the superpowered Glory, who sucks the sanity out of individuals and seems invulnerable.  She is looking for a key, and seems to be closing in on it.Family:  We find out why Tara is so shy and withdrawn.  Her domineering family comes over and wants her to return.  They talk about a secret and Tara's time coming up.  She casts a spell that goes awry and the scoobies wonder what she is trying to hide.Fool For Love:  We learn a lot more about Spike, he isn't just the rebellious British Vampire, he is a person.  We understand why even without a soul he fell in love with both Drusilla and Buffy.  It also has a very touching end, where it shows how strong he really feels.Listening to Fear:  Buffy and Dawn are nervous about the brain surgery that their mother is about to go through.  Meanwhile some strange extra-terrestrial creature that kills the mentally ills becomes fixated on their mother who has started to act strangely due to her tumor.Into the Woods:  Buffy and Riley's relationship is put into shambles when Spike shows Buffy something disturbing.  Riley has been going to vampires to let them drink a little of his blood each time he visits.Triangle:  Willow and Anya accidently release a troll that has previous history with Anya when she was a vengence demon.  He isn't happy about what has been done to him and wants revenge.Checkpoint:  The gang goes to the Watcher Council for information about Glory.  They are put through a battery of tests to determine if she is worthy of their help.Blood Ties:  They find out that Dawn is the key.  This of course isn't good news to Dawn who finds out she isn't a real person.Crush:  Buffy is shocked to find out that Spike has a crush on her. This is compounded with Drusilla's return and the effect it has on Spike.The Body:  The gang is faced with real tragedy when one of their fold dies from natural causes.  A very emotionally charged and sad episode.Forever:  The gang is dealing with the death of their friend, Angel returns to help comfort Buffy.Intervention:  Spike had Warren, introduced earlier this season, to make him a Buffy bot designed for him to be a full functional love bot.  Many of the Scoobies think it is the real thing. Spike is captured by Glories minions thinking he either is the key or knows about it.Spiral:  Glory discovers that Dawn is the Key and pursues her relentlessly.  Meanwhile an order of Byzantium Knights who are opposed to Glory believe the only way to stop her plans is to kill the key to foil her plans.Weight of the World:  Dawn has been kidnapped by Glory and Buffy is in a catotonic dream state where she sees many images and possible futures.The Gift:  They have their 100th episode with a bang.  Glory has the key and plans on opening a gate for a return to her hell dimension.  But there is a problem, the opening of the gate will cause untold damage to this world until the key is killed.  They scoobies also don't know how to face Glory who seems invulnerable.

The introduction of Dawn was a brilliant move by Joss.  It created season five of Buffy.  Dawn=The Key.  The Key is saught by Glory (A hell god none the less).  Glory was probably the best villian in the history of the show/any TV show.  She was crazy, she was creepy, she was unstoppable.  The makings of a fantastic season.All 22 episodes of season five are amazing in their own right.  They all deal with furthering the arc of the season and the arc of the series.  The love that Spike had for Buffy, Buffy's love interest being her sister, Xander and Anya falling deeper in love, Tara and Willow having a great relationship.  All of that would come into play in the sixth season.  But the major plot development happened in &quot;The Gift&quot; at the very end.Buffy's death was forseeable but still unforseeable as well.  All indications would be that Dawn would have to die and Buffy would quit being a vampire slayer, which would have been interesting too.  But killing off the main and title character was unbelievable.This season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not to be missed.

767039,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0000AQS18,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[0, 2]","Many fans of the show believe that the two best seasons were the third and fifth, and I definitely see where they are coming from.  While I believe that the third was a little better than this one, I must say that this one was a close second.  This season starts off with an amusing confrontation between Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Count Dracula (Rudolph Martin).  At the end of the season premiere, we are thrown a real curveball; a new character named Dawn (Michelle Tractenberg), who it seems is Buffy's sister.  For those of you who have just started watching Buffy, and have not yet seen or know anything about this season, you may be a little confused.  Afterall, in the four previous seasons, there has never been any mention of Buffy's sister, although there have been hints.  Anyway, we are soon introduced to Ben (Charlie Weber), an intern at the hospital who develops a crush on Buffy.  At first, Buffy has eyes only for Riley (Marc Blucas), until he leaves to go fight in Belize, and then Buffy develops feelings for Ben.  But Ben has a dark secret; he is somehow connected to a creature named Glory (Clare Kramer), a creature who turns out to be a God from a Hell Demension.  Glory is like no one Buffy has ever met; stronger, faster, and has more stamina than any villain Buffy has ever met.  Fortunately, she isn't the smartest one.  Anyway, Glory needs something called ""The Key"" in order to fulfill her master plan, and Buffy will do anything to protect it.In this season, the gang is put the toughest trials that they have ever been through, especially near the end of the season when Willow's (Alyson Hannigan) lover loses her mind, Spike (James Marsters) begins falling in love with Buffy, and Buffy learns Dawn's true nature.As great as this season was, there were naturally some flaws, problems, and gray areas.  Beware, this paragraph contains spoilers.  Okay, I always thought that the Slayer had about the same strength as vampires did, but when Spike tried to pick up Olaf the Troll's hammer, he couldn't even lift it an inch off the ground.  However, Buffy could wield it better than Olaf himself.  Second, I don't understand why Ben never killed himself.  I know that he didn't want to die, but he had to have realized that it would have been for the good of the cause.  On that same note, why was Dawn so angry at him; I know that she didn't want to die either, but her death would have saved millions.  Finally, the way Ben/Glory died was a little anti-climactic.  Here is this God, who twice before had beaten Buffy's butt, but at the end, Buffy wailed on her.  The fight they had was great, but then, when she turned back into Ben, Buffy left him to live.  She knew that the only way to kill Glory was to kill Ben.  Then Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) came and strangled him.  I just never pictured Giles as a killer.The end of this season is very powerful and sad; it could have made a good series finale, but I'm glad that Joss Whedon decided to keep the show going.  All of the actors did incredible jobs, the stories were amazing this season, and the emotions were better than ever.  Some episodes to check out are Buffy vs. Dracula, The Replacement, No Place Like Home, Checkpoint, Blood Ties, Intervention, Spiral, Weight of the World, and The Gift.",5,Clash of the Titans,1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,3292,"['Many', 'fans', 'show', 'believe', 'two', 'best', 'seasons', 'were', 'third', 'fifth', 'definitely', 'see', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'believe', 'third', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'one', 'must', 'say', 'one', 'was', 'close', 'second', 'season', 'off', 'amusing', 'confrontation', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'Rudolph', 'Martin', 'end', 'season', 'premiere', 'are', 'thrown', 'real', 'curveball', 'new', 'character', 'named', 'Dawn', 'Michelle', 'Tractenberg', 'who', 'Buffy', 'sister', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'started', 'watching', 'Buffy', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'know', 'anything', 'season', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'confused', 'Afterall', 'four', 'previous', 'seasons', 'never', 'been', 'mention', 'Buffy', 'sister', 'have', 'been', 'hints', 'Anyway', 'are', 'soon', 'introduced', 'Ben', 'Charlie', 'Weber', 'intern', 'hospital', 'who', 'crush', 'Buffy', 'first', 'Buffy', 'eyes', 'only', 'Riley', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'go', 'fight', 'Belize', 'then', 'Buffy', 'feelings', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'dark', 'secret', 'somehow', 'connected', 'creature', 'named', 'Glory', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'creature', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'God', 'Hell', 'Demension', 'Glory', 'one', 'Buffy', 'ever', 'met', 'stronger', 'faster', 'more', 'stamina', 'villain', 'Buffy', 'ever', 'met', 'Fortunately', ""n't"", 'smartest', 'one', 'Anyway', 'Glory', 'something', 'called', 'Key', 'order', 'fulfill', 'master', 'plan', 'Buffy', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'it.In', 'season', 'gang', 'put', 'toughest', 'trials', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'especially', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'Willow', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'lover', 'mind', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'falling', 'love', 'Buffy', 'Buffy', 'Dawn', 'true', 'nature.As', 'great', 'season', 'was', 'were', 'naturally', 'flaws', 'problems', 'gray', 'areas', 'Beware', 'paragraph', 'spoilers', 'Okay', 'always', 'thought', 'Slayer', 'had', 'same', 'strength', 'vampires', 'did', 'when', 'Spike', 'tried', 'pick', 'up', 'Olaf', 'Troll', 'hammer', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'lift', 'inch', 'ground', 'However', 'Buffy', 'could', 'wield', 'better', 'Olaf', 'Second', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Ben', 'never', 'killed', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'had', 'have', 'realized', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'cause', 'same', 'note', 'why', 'was', 'Dawn', 'so', 'angry', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'either', 'death', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'millions', 'Finally', 'way', 'Ben/Glory', 'died', 'was', 'little', 'anti-climactic', 'Here', 'God', 'who', 'twice', 'before', 'had', 'beaten', 'Buffy', 'butt', 'end', 'Buffy', 'wailed', 'fight', 'had', 'was', 'great', 'then', 'when', 'turned', 'back', 'Ben', 'Buffy', 'left', 'live', 'knew', 'only', 'way', 'kill', 'Glory', 'was', 'kill', 'Ben', 'Then', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'came', 'strangled', 'just', 'never', 'pictured', 'Giles', 'killer.The', 'end', 'season', 'very', 'powerful', 'sad', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'series', 'finale', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'decided', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'actors', 'did', 'incredible', 'jobs', 'stories', 'were', 'amazing', 'season', 'emotions', 'were', 'better', 'ever', 'episodes', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'Buffy', 'Dracula', 'Replacement', 'No', 'Place', 'Home', 'Checkpoint', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Intervention', 'Spiral', 'Weight', 'World', 'Gift']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

767044,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0000AQS18,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 8]","Some have said that the series dropped the ball after the less than stellar fourth season. Me included. Although, to be fair, I have come to think of it as being better than it was at first viewing a few years ago. Season five returns the show to glory in a truly brilliant, and glorious way. If anyone had doubts over season four, this season put them completely back into place. As season 4 pushed Buffy and our other young heroes into a new world when they entered college life, this season makes them grow up even more. As every season has been a natural progression in the lives of these people, this one continues the tradition. The season opens up with a lightweight, though amusing episode, ""Buffy Vs. Dracula"". It isn't until the final scene that the season kicks off the twists and turns and sets things into motion. We learn that Buffy has a little sister named Dawn(Michelle Trachtenberg). How could this be?. We don't get an answer the fifth episode, ""No Place Like Home"", where we learn exactly how Dawn came to be. I won't ruin it for you if you haven't already seen it yet. Dawn and her appearance is pretty much the main story for the season, and she is the main goal for this years's big bad, Glory(Clare Kramer). Glory is a God, who needs the key(Dawn), in order to reenter her hell dimension. And in doing so, will open other portals and cause severe destruction to earth. Glory is an interesting villain, but she is hard to take seriously when she looks like a cheerleader and talks like a valley girl. Relationships abound once again in this season. Most importantly, Buffy and Riley. The relationship comes to a head in ""Into The Woods"", when Buffy, thanks to Spike, finds out a dark secret Riley has been hiding. Riley leaves and Buffy is again handed more loss. But it doesn't compare to the loss of her mother, Joyce, in ""The Body"". This was the most devastating episode of any show, genre or not, that I have ever seen. Joss Whedon proved once again why he is a genius. This episode was real. It didn't push the envelope to make you cry. It just happens naturally. There is no music at all in the episode, and the story playing out on screen is so vivid and real, that you feel you stomach in knots as you watch it. Never has an episode effected me. Just brilliant. Again, the Emmy's just didn't get it. We learned that Joyce had a brain tumor, and this was taken further in ""Shadow"", and ""Listening To Fear"". These were sub-par episodes, but the Joyce angle was heartbreaking. Angel makes a visit in ""Forever"", where Buffy tries to handle Joyce's funeral, and Dawn tries a spell to bring her mom back from the grave. The final scene is another powerhouse scene. Because of this loss, Buffy is faced with another mission other than being the slayer. Being there for Dawn. Buffy has been wise beyond her years already, but now she has no parent, and she has a little kid sister. It forces Buffy to grow up in new ways. That's the story here. Growing up. Xander and Anya get more serious and stable in their relationship, as does Willow and Tara. Giles gets back on his feet again and opens up his own place, The Magic Box. The most startling revelation in this season was Spike's love for Buffy. It all comes out in ""Crush"", when Drusilla, Spike's ex, comes back to town. It was a brilliant move and it played off well. Other episodes here include ""Checkpoint"", a wonderful episode that deals with the return of the Watcher's Council, who want to test Buffy some more. ""Blood Ties"" deals with Dawn finding out who, or what, she reall is. Dawn might of been annoying, but she was a real 14 year old. Trachtenberg did a wonderful job in doing this. Anya got her moment to shine in ""Triangle"", when a troll is summoned to town over her and Willow's bickering. The final three episodes are some of the strongest of the season. ""Spiral"" deals with Buffy coming to realize that Glory is far too powerful. In a very un-Buffy fashion, she decides to run, instead of staying and standing up to the evil. The episode includes a teriffic chase scene between a winnebago and knights on horses that also included a fantastic fight with Buffy on top of the winnebago. ""The Weight Of The World"", the first part of the finale, isn't nearly as strong as the conclusion, but it holds it's own. Buffy is in a catatonic state over Dawn, and Willow tries to get into her mind to get her back out. ""The Gift"", along with ""The Body"", is also one of the top episodes. It is also one of Buffy's finest hours in all of it's run. It is the season finale, and also the show's 100th episode, and it is a beaut. Everything is perfect. The final fight with Glory is a blast, and the end minute is one of the most emotional scenes in the series. Teriffic. ""Fool For Love"", the seventh episode, is a Buffy gem. One of the best Buffy episodes ever. Buffy is injured while on patrol, and she goes to the only person she knows who has killed slayers. Spike. Spike tells her, via flashbacks that includes the return of Angelus, Darla, and Drusilla, how the deaths occurred. Every frame is perfection. ""Family"", gives Tara her moment in the sun. We learn more about her and her family life when her relatives come to town harboring a secret about Tara and the women in their family. A solid episode with great work from Amber Benson. Season five of Buffy is a glorious return to form. It makes up for the lulls and lags of season 4 in a big way, and then some. The writting is as sharp and witty as ever. The arcs and mythology are the best that has been on television. This is one of the most emotional seasons of the series, and it is marvelous because of the work of the brilliant cast. Year after year, season after season, they show what a unbelievable cast they are. They deserve so much credit, but they never seem to get it. Get season five. It is Buffy getting back to form, and it is as good as it gets.",5,Buffy : The Adult Years,1062720000,"09 5, 2003",2003,5901,"['have', 'said', 'series', 'dropped', 'ball', 'less', 'stellar', 'fourth',

767045,AWQDIP5LPT8KT,B0000AQS18,Bat185,"[2, 7]","On first glance Season 5 seems like an awesome season, and while it IS good, there are some problems.  Buffy The Vampire Slayer has always tried to maintain a good continuity but that falls apart here.In the season premiere we are introduced to Dawn Summers, the newly-arrived younger sister of Buffy, the show's heroine.  The fact is, however, that Dawn is not real.  Dawn, we learn, is actually ""The Key"".....a mystical ball of green glowing energy that will open the doorway between dimensions and ultimately bring Hell on Earth.  While that sounds like a great plotpoint that could make for an impressive story arc, it falls apart when we learn that this ""energy"" was made into human form from Buffy's blood so she will be given a viable reason to protect it from this season's ""big bad"" Glory (or Glorificus, as her minions refer to her).  The problem with that is, where did the monks who made Dawn acquire Buffy's blood?  This is not explained.Another problem with Season 5 is the amount of ""goofiness"".  The third episode ""The Replacement"" was just plain dumb.  It didn't leave me on the edge of my seat as previous episodes have.  What was with the episode where Willow and Anya accidentally create Olaf the Troll God and the film strip-like flashbacks?  Were they really running out of money and had to use that cheap film tactic to do a flashback scene?  While Sarah Michelle Gellar is a wonderful actress who can range from drama to comedy in the blink of an eye, I also didn't like her portrayal of the Buffybot.  While having Warren come in with his Aprilbot made for a good episode, and showed how a person can be hurt and their reaction when they realize that someone they love doesn't love them back, extending that storyline with Warren creating the Buffybot for Spike was pathetic.While not the worst season of Buffy, Season 5 was certainly not one of the best.

Agnew ""rothwyn""","[0, 2]","&quot;The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.&quot;- Buffy to Dawn, &quot;The Gift&quot;This season had a lot to live up to. Riding the wave of a good first season, a great second season, and two spectacular following seasons, the fifth chapter in the tale of Buffy the Vampire Slayer had a lot of people watching and holding their breath. But once &quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&quot; appeared on TV screens, we breathed a sigh of relief. The good things never change.The fifth (and final on the WB) season of BtVS showcased the full range of the talent that had worked on the show for four years, from cast to crew to the writers and directors. Beginning with what some labeled as a shark jump as Buffy's heretofore unknown little sister Dawn was introduced, the fifth outing proved all TV show cliches wrong when this seemingly desperate plot device was turned into one of the most compelling aspects of the show's entire run.Who is Dawn? Where has she been these last four years? And why does everyone know who she is? Well, it turns out that she is The Key, a way of opening the portals between all dimensions, and she's in very real danger. A certain nasty hell god named Glory wants her, and she's prepared to do anything to get her. Glory doesn't try to replace any of the show's previous big bad's, as they all have specific feels to them that are tailor-made for the season. With Glory, it's evil, pure and simple. She's mean, she's nuts, and she can knock down a building with a fingernail.The cast really takes it up a notch on this season, which, considering their past performances, is really something. Giles is torn between his desire to protect the world as a whole, and the pain that losing Dawn would cause to Buffy. Willow watches as Glory drains Terra of her sanity, and then nurses her lover with a touching tenderness that really pulls on the heart strings. Spike realizes that he is in love with Buffy (what? without a soul? HOW?), but still manages to be the same Spike that we all know and love. Xander and Anya play the happy couple, though Anya's specific mannerisms are both cause for laugh and thought, as she really mirror's the ridiculousness of the world that we take for granted. And Buffy. . . she saves the world. A lot.Sarah Michelle-Gellar really came into her own more than anyone on the show. The role of both a slayer and a protective big sister, recently dealing with the loss of her mother, would have been an incredible strain on any actress, but Gellar pulls it off with flair, heart, and believability. From her fight with Dracula to her heart-wrenching sacrifice, she is every bit the slayer who can. Her performance as Buffy as well as the superb writing and directing throughout the season put Buffy on the map, and assured its place among the greats of television icons.The extras: they're all that and a bag of chips. Lots of galleries, features, commentaries, and much more make this set a loaded bonus collection as well as one of the best seasons in television history. Those who love Buffy want it, and those who don't love Buffy need it, if nothing else than to change their minds. After all, everyone should love Buffy.

Cullum,"[1, 3]","After an uncertain 4th season about the uncertainty of freshmen year in college, Buffy returned to form with a story arc rooted in what makes and breaks a &quot;family&quot;.  The battle against Glory was spectacular and well done, but it's the issues Buffy has to face that makes the season so poignant -- a new sister, the passing of a close family member, and how the entire gang relates good and bad with her.  And underneath it all the final struggle Buffy has to face to MEAN what it is to be THE SLAYER.  It is as powerful as any of the 7 seasons could be! And all of this delivered at a fast and dizzying pace trademark to the show!  Season 5 feels like the climax to the entire show, and you could almost stop here and feel completely satisfied with the way they tied the entire series up.The DVDs are fullscreen format and chock full of extras.  Featurettes include a season overview with the creators talking about their vision of season 5, a look at stunts, an in-depth look at Dawn including an interview with Michelle, and an assortment of outtakes/bloopers (which are from all 5 seasons!).  The commentaries are about 1 per disc on various episodes with the most striking being Joss's take on THE BODY.  The only truly important omission would be the &quot;previously on ...&quot; segment from the season finale which is also the 100th episode titled THE GIFT.Highlights are many this year including one of the best villans in the series - the banished god Glory!  She has almost a Cordelia vibe to her, but rarely has there been a more beautiful and wicked villan on BUFFY.  She's vain, glorious, and utterly mad!

767055,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B0000AQS18,Brittany Rose,"[3, 4]","This is probably one of my favorite Buffy seasons, if not the best one out there.  As the final season on the WB the finale is probably the most emotionally charged as a special goodbye courtesy of creator Joss Whedon.  New characters and relationships are introduced and solidified in many cases.  Buffy gains a family member yet loses another one, ends a relationship and plays with starting a new confusing one.  Xander and Anya, and Tara and Willow grow much closer this season, as does the viewers attraction to the relationships formed on the show.  The supervillan this season is none other then a slightly insane fallen God by the name of Glory who is looking for a magical 'key' that will let her return home - at the expense of the Earth.The big theme of this season is acceptance - of what the characters can't control, of new people in their lives, and of what they must do to benefit others, particularly shown in the 100th episode, &quot;The Gift&quot;.The thing aobut Season 5 is that there isn't as many singular episodes that stand-out but an amazing rippling effect that makes you appreciate all the details of the finale that much more.  However some particularly well-done episodes include &quot;The Body&quot; which features no score whatsoever, a rare case for most dramatic tv series, particularly for this episode.  &quot;Blood Ties&quot; Is a great metaphorical episode for youths watching and a powerful 'key' to the season.  &quot;I Was Made To Love You&quot; The first episode featuring one of the famed robot girls (like the Buffybot) is interesting only as precursor to the impact of the Buffy-bot created by Spike.  Finally &quot;The Weight of the World&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot; are both incredibly well done and lead to a powerful ending and goodbye as Buffy leaves the WB and heads to UPN for the final two seasons.

But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the ""chosen one"" able to ""stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..."" But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 5) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" in which Giles decides to leave Sunnydale believing that Buffy no longer needs him. But when Buffy runs into a vampire who claims to be Dracula (and he exhibits powers far beyond the scope of most vampires), she and Xander are forced to work together to slay him. In so doing, Dracula reveals that Buffy's powers derive from a source of evil, thus stoking the curiosity of Buffy who enlists Giles' help in studying the nature of the Slayer (as a result, he stays in Sunnydale)... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""The Replacement"" in which a demon's spell splits Xander into two versions of himself (one with all his positive attributes, one with all of his negative), and ""Triangle"" in which Willow and Anya accidentally conjure a troll which runs around Sunnydale leaving a path of destruction in its wake...Below is a list of episodes included on the Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 5) DVD:Episode 79 (Buffy vs. Dracula)Episode 80 (Real Me)Episode 81 (The Replacement)Episode 82 (Out of My Mind)Episode 83 (No Place Like Home)Episode 84 (Family)Episode 85 (Fool for Love)Episode 86 (Shadow)Episode 87 (Listening to Fear)Episode 88 (Into the Woods)Episode 89 (Triangle)Episode 90 (Checkpoint)Episode 91 (Blood Ties)Episode 92 (Crush)Episode 93 (I Was Made to Love You)Episode 94 (The Body)Episode 95 (Forever)Episode 96 (Intervention)Episode 97 (Tough Love)Episode 98 (Spiral)Episode 99 (The Weight of the World)Episode 100 (The Gift)The DVD Report",5,An original and uniquely entertaining TV series...,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,3136,"['brainchild', 'writer', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'originally', 'entered', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', 'starring', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', '1992', 'creator', 'Whedon', 'felt', 'project', 'never', 'quite', 'did', 'justice', 'full', 'scope', 'vision', 'managed', 'turn', 'film', 'television', 'series', '1997', 'result', 'Whedon', 'increased', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'audience', 'notoriety', 'Nominated', '14', 'Emmy', 'seven', 'year', 'run', 'show', 'managed', 'win', 'only', 'two', '1998', 'Outstanding', 'Makeup', 'Outstanding', 'Music', 'Composition', 'television', 'series', 'true', 'success', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'indicated', 'massive', 'success', 'show', 'long', 'run', 'strong', 'DVD', 'sales', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'series', 'spin-off', 'Angel', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'title', 'role', 'Buffy', 'Anne', 'Summers', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'alone', 'generation', 'chosen', 'one', 'able', 'stand', 'vampires', 'demons', 'forces', 'darkness', 'Slayer', 'Buffy', 'not', 'alone', 'fulfilling', 'destiny', 'slayer', 'vampires', 'also', 'help', 'high', 'school', 'librarian', 'Rupert', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'who', 'Watcher', 'one', 'chosen', 'train', 'guide', 'slayers', 'developmental', 'path', 'addition', 'new', 'friends', 'Willow', 'Rosenberg', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'American', 'Pie', 'fame', 'Harris', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'quickly', 'truth', 'Buffy', 'destiny', 'often', 'aid', 'defending', 'world', 'evil', 'forces', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Buffy', 'vs.', 'Dracula', 'Giles', 'leave', 'Sunnydale', 'believing', 'Buffy', 'no', 'longer', 'when', 'Buffy', 'vampire', 'who', 'be', 'Dracula', 'powers', 'far', 'scope', 'most', 'vampires', 'Xander', 'are', 'forced', 'work', 'together', 'slay', 'so', 'doing', 'Dracula', 'Buffy', 'powers', 'derive', 'source', 'evil', 'thus', 'stoking', 'curiosity', 'Buffy', 'who', 'Giles', 'help', 'studying', 'nature', 'Slayer', 'result', 'Sunnydale', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '5', 'include', 'Replacement', 'demon', 'spell', 'Xander', 'two', 'versions', 'one', 'positive', 'attributes', 'one', 'negative', 'Triangle', 'Willow', 'Anya', 'accidentally', 'conjure', 'troll', 'Sunnydale', 'leaving', 'path', 'destruction', 'wake', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'Episode', '79', 'Buffy', 'Dracula', 'Episode', '80', 'Real', 'Me', 'Episode', '81', 'Replacement', 'Episode', '82', 'My', 'Mind', 'Episode', '83', 'Place', 'Home', 'Episode', '84', 'Family', 'Episode', '85', 'Fool', 'Love', 'Episode', '86', 'Shadow', 'Episode', '87', 'Listening', 'Fear', 'Episode', '88', 'Woods', 'Episode', '89', 'Triangle', 'Episode', '90', 'Checkpoint', 'Episode', '91', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Episode', '92', 'Crush', 'Episode', '93', 'Was', 'Made', 'Love', '94', 'Body', 'Episode', '95', 'Forever', 'Episode', '96', 'Intervention', 'Episode', '97', 'Tough', 'Love', 'Episode', '98', 'Spiral', 'Episode', '99', 'Weight', 'World', 'Episode', '100', 'Gift', 'DVD', 'Report']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

In fact, the series in general would have been better off if it had ended with Season Five.Buffy finds herself with an all but indestructible nemesis  -  a literal goddess from another dimension, referred to as ""Glory"" (Clare Kramer)  -  and with a kid sister named Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg).  The link connecting the two newcomers is quite clever, and provides for twenty-two episodes' worth of intense melodrama.  Glory is the most cheerfully psychopathic foe Buffy ever faced, supremely confident (she is a goddess, after all), vain in the extreme, and blithely unconcerned that her quest to open a dimensional gateway back to her original home will utterly destroy the planet Earth.  What's one more dead planet, when she has annihilated so many?In order to prevent this unparalleled carnage, a mystic society of monks have concealed the energy key Glory requires to re-enter her own realm, and entrusted it to the care of the Slayer  -  Sunnydale's own Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar).  Once entrusted with her most important mission, Buffy is caught in the worst bind she has ever faced  -  she cannot tell any of her friends the secret truth, without severely endangering their very minds, not to mention their lives.  Glory will stop at nothing to achieve her ends, and is capable of absorbing the minds of selected prey and leaving them functional vegetables.  Buffy's attempt to save the world will even find her trying the one strategy she has never had to employ before:  running like crazy.Season Five is not without flaws, though they are fairly negligible.  Its biggest problem is simply the number of growing character contradictions catching up to it from previous seasons, but these are quickly forgotten or easily glanced-over for the sake of the drama at hand.  Spike (James Marsters) begins his mad descent into obsessive lust over Buffy, and Buffy and her Iowa corn-fed hunky boyfriend, Riley (Marc Blucas), reach a permanent romantic impasse; Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab), Spike's ill-begotten vampire stepchild/lover, attempts to become an arch-nemesis of Buffy, who is all the more comical in contrast with the very real terror of Glory.Two of the most dramatic episodes of the entire series are present in this season, ""The Body,"" in which Buffy loses her mother (Kristine Sutherland)  -  not to any monsters or vampires but simply to illness  -  and the finale in which Buffy literally lays down her life for her loved ones and the world.Buffy has been better than in this action-packed and emotionally wrenching season, but not by much.  And you really can't beat that incredible finale.",4,Gloria In Excelsis Buffy,1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,2972,"['Season', 'Five', 'was', 'last', 'strong', 'one', 'Buffy', 'well', 'thought-out', 'story', 'arc', 'Aside', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'throwaway', 'comic-relief', 'season', 'opener', 'Buffy', 'Vs.', 'Dracula', 'entertaining', 'enough', ""'re"", 'mood', 'couple', 'other', 'less', 'satisfying', 'humorous', 'hors', ""d'ouevres"", 'season', 'overall', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'powerful', 'fact', 'series', 'general', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'ended', 'Season', 'Five.Buffy', 'indestructible', 'nemesis', 'literal', 'goddess', 'dimension', 'referred', 'Glory', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'kid', 'sister', 'named', 'Dawn', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'link', 'connecting', 'two', 'newcomers', 'quite', 'clever', 'twenty-two', 'episodes', 'worth', 'intense', 'melodrama', 'Glory', 'most', 'cheerfully', 'psychopathic', 'foe', 'Buffy', 'ever', 'faced', 'supremely', 'confident', 'goddess', 'vain', 'extreme', 'blithely', 'unconcerned', 'quest', 'open', 'dimensional', 'gateway', 'back', 'original', 'home', 'will', 'utterly', 'destroy', 'planet', 'Earth', 'What', 'one', 'more', 'dead', 'planet', 'when', 'annihilated', 'so', 'many', 'order', 'prevent', 'unparalleled', 'carnage', 'mystic', 'society', 'monks', 'have', 'concealed', 'energy', 'key', 'Glory', 're-enter', 'own', 'realm', 'entrusted', 'care', 'Slayer', 'Sunnydale', 'own', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Once', 'entrusted', 'most', 'important', 'mission', 'Buffy', 'caught', 'worst', 'bind', 'ever', 'faced', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'friends', 'secret', 'truth', 'severely', 'endangering', 'very', 'minds', 'not', 'mention', 'lives', 'Glory', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'achieve', 'ends', 'capable', 'absorbing', 'minds', 'selected', 'prey', 'leaving', 'functional', 'vegetables', 'Buffy', 'attempt', 'save', 'world', 'will', 'even', 'find', 'trying', 'one', 'strategy', 'never', 'had', 'employ', 'running', 'crazy.Season', 'Five', 'not', 'flaws', 'are', 'fairly', 'negligible', 'biggest', 'problem', 'simply', 'number', 'growing', 'character', 'contradictions', 'catching', 'up', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'easily', 'glanced-over', 'sake', 'drama', 'hand', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'mad', 'descent', 'obsessive', 'lust', 'Buffy', 'Buffy', 'Iowa', 'corn-fed', 'hunky', 'boyfriend', 'Riley', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'reach', 'permanent', 'romantic', 'impasse', 'Harmony', 'Kendall', 'Mercedes', 'McNab', 'Spike', 'ill-begotten', 'vampire', 'stepchild/lover', 'become', 'arch-nemesis', 'Buffy', 'who', 'more', 'comical', 'contrast', 'very', 'real', 'terror', 'Glory.Two', 'most', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'present', 'season', 'Body', 'Buffy', 'mother', 'Kristine', 'Sutherland', 'not', 'monsters', 'vampires', 'simply', 'illness', 'finale', 'Buffy', 'literally', 'down', 'life', 'loved', 'ones', 'world.Buffy', 'been', 'better', 'action-packed', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'season', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'incredible', 'finale']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

Some top notch episodes, well directed and one episode everyone seems to love except me. I just thought it as ordinary, not quite Buffy but it was alright. Here's a little breakdown:Buffy vs. Dracula: 10/10 Funny as hell.The Real Me: 9/10 Harmony comes back with minions, that's hilarious. With Tom Lenk(Andrew) as one of the minions.The Replacement: 9.5/10 Xander has 2 qualities, dumb and smart(believe it or not).Out of My Mind: 10/10 Spike tries to get his chip removed, again.No Place like Home: 9.5/10 Glory gets introduced, beats up Buffy.Family: 10/10 Tara is half demon, well that's what her family says anyway.Fool for Love: 10/10 Spike goes back to his I killed the slayers days.Shadow: 9.5/10 Glory gets a snake to seek out the slayer.Listening to Fear: 7.5/10 Worst episode in the season, extra-terrestrial demon comes and kills mental patients(re Joyce)Into the Woods: 10/10 Bye by Riley, Spike shows Buffy that Riley is getting bitten by vampires.Triangle: 10/10 Olaf the troll is in this dimension, and Anya is in horror. While Willow and Anya bicker, and Willow makes a bunch of sarcastic remarks, I never seen her funnier then in this one.Checkpoint: 9.5/10 Watcher's council is back! Which means another stupid test for Buffy.Blood Ties: 9/10 Dawn finds out Joyce doesn't want her, and heads out with the help of Spike, finds out she's just a key.Crush: 10/10 Drusila's back, with promises. Spike kills again.I was made To Love You: 9.5/10 Warren is introduced, he made a robot to love him.The Body: 8/10 This is the one I was talking about, it's too slow for me. And no music, which doesn't help. But it's well done and well directed so it still gets a good mark. And I'm not a big Joyce fan, she got irritating after a while. Mostly in seasons 1 & 2.Forever: 9/10 Angel takes a small visit, Dawn tries to bring back Joyce, with some help from Spike and the Doc(like really he's gonna help her?)Intervention: 9.5/10 Spike gets Warren to make a Buffybot for him. It gets really funny!Tough Love: 12/10 Glory uses her trick to suck the brain and make Tara go all crazy. Willow is mad, and gets to the dark magics.Spiral: 10/10 They flee from Glory and the soldiers who both want Dawn dead, well Glory wants to wait a while, soldiers want her dead now so Glory can't perform the ritual. Glory escapes with Dawn and kills the soldiers during the process.The Weight of the World: 9/10 Buffy is in shock that she let Dawn go and her mother's dead. Willow is forced to get her out of it.The Gift: 20/10 2nd best season finale of Buffy, Grave is number 1. Glory will open the portal using Dawn's blood, the only way to stop it, is to kill Dawn.It's a great season, definitely worth buying when it comes out, American/Canadian release will be December 9th.",5,Buffy reaches its peak,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,2848,"['season', 'top', 'notch', 'one', 'more', 'dark', 'seasons', 'season', '7', 'top', 'notch', 'episodes', 'well', 'directed', 'one', 'episode', 'everyone', 'love', 'just', 'thought', 'ordinary', 'not', 'quite', 'Buffy', 'was', 'alright', 'Here', 'little', 'breakdown', 'Buffy', 'vs.', 'Dracula', '10/10', 'Funny', 'hell.The', 'Real', 'Me', '9/10', 'Harmony', 'back', 'minions', 'hilarious', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'Andrew', 'one', 'minions.The', 'Replacement', '9.5/10', 'Xander', '2', 'qualities', 'dumb', 'smart', 'believe', 'not', '.Out', 'My', 'Mind', '10/10', 'Spike', 'tries', 'get', 'chip', 'removed', 'again.No', 'Place', 'Home', '9.5/10', 'Glory', 'introduced', 'up', 'Buffy.Family', '10/10', 'Tara', 'half', 'demon', 'well', 'what', 'family', 'anyway.Fool', 'Love', '10/10', 'Spike', 'back', 'killed', 'slayers', 'days.Shadow', '9.5/10', 'Glory', 'snake', 'seek', 'out', 'slayer.Listening', 'Fear', '7.5/10', 'Worst', 'episode', 'season', 'extra-terrestrial', 'demon', 'kills', 'mental', 'patients', 're', 'Joyce', 'Woods', '10/10', 'Bye', 'Riley', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'Riley', 'getting', 'bitten', 'vampires.Triangle', '10/10', 'troll', 'dimension', 'Anya', 'horror', 'Willow', 'Anya', 'bicker', 'Willow', 'bunch', 'sarcastic', 'remarks', 'never', 'seen', 'funnier', 'then', 'one.Checkpoint', '9.5/10', 'Watcher', 'council', 'back', 'Which', 'stupid', 'test', 'Buffy.Blood', 'Ties', '9/10', 'Dawn', 'out', 'Joyce', ""n't"", 'want', 'out', 'help', 'Spike', 'out', 'just', 'key.Crush', '10/10', 'Drusila', 'back', 'promises', 'Spike', 'again.I', 'was', 'made', 'Love', '9.5/10', 'Warren', 'introduced', 'made', 'robot', 'love', 'him.The', 'Body', '8/10', 'one', 'was', 'talking', 'too', 'slow', 'music', ""n't"", 'help', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'directed', 'still', 'good', 'mark', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Joyce', 'fan', 'got', 'irritating', 'while', 'Mostly', 'seasons', '1', '2.Forever', '9/10', 'Angel', 'small', 'visit', 'Dawn', 'bring', 'back', 'Joyce', 'help', 'Spike', 'Doc', 'really', 'gon', 'help', 'Intervention', '9.5/10', 'Spike', 'Warren', 'make', 'Buffybot', 'really', 'funny', 'Tough', 'Love', '12/10', 'Glory', 'trick', 'suck', 'brain', 'make', 'Tara', 'go', 'crazy', 'Willow', 'mad', 'dark', 'magics.Spiral', '10/10', 'flee', 'Glory', 'soldiers', 'who', 'want', 'Dawn', 'dead', 'well', 'Glory', 'wait', 'while', 'soldiers', 'want', 'dead', 'now', 'so', 'Glory', 'ca', ""n't"", 'perform', 'ritual', 'Glory', 'Dawn', 'soldiers', 'process.The', 'Weight', 'World', '9/10', 'Buffy', 'shock', 'let', 'Dawn', 'go', 'mother', 'dead', 'Willow', 'forced', 'get', 'it.The', 'Gift', '20/10', '2nd', 'best', 'season', 'finale', 'Buffy', 'Grave', 'number', '1', 'Glory', 'will', 'open', 'portal', 'using', 'Dawn', 'blood', 'only', 'way', 'stop', 'kill', 'Dawn.It', 'great', 'season', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'when', 'out', 'American/Canadian', 'release', 'will', 'be', 'December', '9th']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

767060,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B0000AQS18,Busy Body,"[6, 8]","With Season Four of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Joss Whedon and his team of writers proved that the show could survive after graduating high school and moving into the big scary world of university. So with Season Five, the task was more to prove character development and ensure that all the cast members grew up and began living their lives like true adults. The effort and dedication is shown throughout ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Fifth Season,"" which just gets better with each viewing.Season Four's superb finale ""Restless"" left a lot of confusion about the show's future. Our heroes dreams had opened up many doors to future events, just when it seemed that everything that could be covered had been. In Season Five, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) are still at UC Sunnydale, while Xander (Nicholas Brendon) still lives in his parent's basement, but soon gets his own pad. Giles (Anthony Stewart-Head) still lives in his apartment, while the addition of Tara (Amber Benson) and Riley (Marc Blucas) who first made their presence in Season Four are still present in Willow and Buffy's lives respectively. Spike (James Marsters) is still hanging around, lurking in the shadows, whilst Anya (Emma Caulfield) is still - rather surprisingly - the girlfriend of Xander. Everything seems normal and content - yet the addition of Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) turns the lives of everyone on its head.First appearing at the end of the episode ""Buffy Vs. Dracula"" and explored deeper in ""Real Me,"" Dawn is Buffy sister. Die-hard fans are left scratching their heads in confusion, but all is revealed three episodes later in ""No Place Like Home."" A group of monks in Sunnydale posess the power of transform living energy into any shape or form they see fit. They want to hide this magical energy (known only as ""The Key"") from a Hell beast known as Glory (Clare Kramer). They realise the Slayer will protect The Key, so they press it into the form of Dawn, and manipulate the Scooby Gang's minds into thinking that Dawn has always been Buffy's little sister. The first half of the season revolves around Buffy knowing the true nature of Dawn/The Key, and trying to keep it secret from everyone. As time goes on the Scoobies discover its nature and, finally, in ""Blood Ties,"" so does Dawn herself.The remainder of the season shows Glory desperate to find The Key, with the clock ticking away. She finds what she's been looking for at the end of the episode ""Tough Love,"" when one of the Scoobies accidentally reveals the true nature of The Key. From there on, with three episodes of the season remaining, the Scoobies go on the run from Glory. ""Spiral"" sees Buffy and her friends trying to escape Glory's evil clutches. In ""The Weight Of The World,"" Dawn is taken by Glory and Buffy slips into a kind of coma, but she's back in the epic season finale, ""The Gift,"" in which the slayer confronts Glory and sacrifices Dawn's life and the world for her own. The ultimate cliff-hanger for the show's future.Season Five is very much about family issues and emotional ties. Episodes such as ""Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight"" and ""Crush"" deal with Spike's new-found love of the slayer. He's obsessed with her, and she is repulsed - little does she know of how things will change in Season Six. The seemingly eternal love of Willow and Tara takes drastic turns in episodes such as ""Family"" and ""Tough Love."" Buffy also has to deal with her own troubles. Looking after her sick mother forces Riley away in ""Into The Woods."" They split, and he leaves Sunnydale for good - or so it seems. Buffy sick mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) has to deal with her brain tumour in episodes such as ""Shadow"" and ""Listening To Fear,"" before she finally - and suddenly - dies in the masterpiece episode ""The Body."" How this episode did not win a truckload of awards is beyond me. Truly emotional stuff, and the best look at a grieving family in television history. This is superbly followed up with the episode ""Forever,"" in which Buffy has to cope with Dawn's feelings of neglect when she tries to bring her dead mother back to life.All this depression and heartache may make some believe that Season Five is a dark and serious season - it's not. For that you have to look at Season Six. Season Five does indeed have some wonderful and humorous episodes, such as ""The Replacement,"" ""Triangle,"" ""I Was Made To Love You"" and ""Intervention."" All wonderful episodes, superbly crafted by the common use of other-worldy beings as metaphors for human emotions.Seasons Two, Three and Four all ended with marvellous and highly-praised classic finales in the form of ""Becoming - Part 2,"" ""Graduation Day - Part 2,"" and ""Restless."" The bar is set even higher for a better Season Five finale, and the expectations are easily met with ""The Gift."" The episode not only makes it special because it is the 100th episode, but because it deals with the biggest shock of the entire series - the death of the slayer.With Season Five, the show has proved yet again that it is not just about vampire slaying, but people's emotions and attitudes towards growing up and living their lives.",5,Buffy Grows Up In Season Five Of The Best TV Show In

767062,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0000AQS18,calvinnme,"[5, 6]","I found this season perfect, from beginning to end, with a fine and subtle use of imagery, a fascinating and clever story arc, with even the so-called ""filler"" episodes being of outstanding quality. It was even on par with the excellent season two, which is quite an accomplishment.The beginning of the season finds the cast in a good place emotionally- Xander & Anya are together, as are Tara & Willow. Also, it seems that Buffy has finally found a loving ""normal"" relationship with Riley. Thus the first three episodes are somewhat light-hearted romps reminiscent of the lighter side of season four, in spite of the fact that Buffy has a new little sister, and nobody but the audience seems to notice the fact that she did not exist until this season.Episode four is where the season begins to make a turn- Riley risks death rather than revert to a man of normal strength, Buffy's mother turns mysteriously ill, and Spike has a revelation about his feelings for Buffy that horrify him during a dream sequence that is one of the highlights of the series. From this point on, life becomes darker for the slayer. She discovers the truth about her new sister and realizes that she must protect her from an unknown evil source that turns out to be a god from another dimension - the vain and evil Glory. Also, Buffy's mother is diagnosed with a brain tumor, and Riley leaves Buffy for a government assignment in Central America when he believes she no longer cares for him. In ""Into the Woods"", Xander makes Buffy realize what she is about to lose by letting Riley go, and she races to stop him from leaving, but is too late. In spite of the negative feelings many fans had for Riley's character, the last few scenes of this episode were particularly moving.Buffy's mother, seemingly cured by surgery, dies suddenly in one of the series best episodes ""The Body"". In it, the scoobies first confront death that is caused by invisible disease, rather than some supernatural power that they have always been able to outsmart or overpower. This leaves Buffy the guardian of her little sister, whose emotional state has become complicated by the fact that she now knows she is not just an ordinary teenage girl, and that all memories of her, including her own, have been planted. Buffy's new duties as head of the house force her to drop out of college, ripping yet another earthly possession from Buffy. In the final episode, with Glory having ripped the fabric that holds alternate realities apart so she can return to her own, the slayer decides to take her sister's place and jump into the breach to stop the destruction of the world.

767065,AYXZU81PMZBKC,B0000AQS18,"Christopher Wood ""anima300""","[2, 2]","I had been told by so many people that this series goes downhill after Season 3, and I believe them somewhat after Season 4.  I thought the introduction of The Initiative was stretching it a little, and I wasn't a huge fan of its choppiness.  But it had to go through that phase to get to this incredible season, and by far the best of the show...Let's start with the best episodes:Buffs Vs. Dracula, The Replacement (super funny), No Place Like Home, Into the Woods (thank god), Checkpoint, Blood Ties, The Body, Forever, Tough Love, Spiral, Weight of the World, THE GIFT (the best Buffy episode ever).Cast of Characters:Buffy Summers:  Sarah Michelle GellarXander Harris:  Nicholas BrendanWillow Rosenberg:  Alyson HanniganTara:  Amber BensonSpike:  James MarstersRiley:  Marc BlucasDawn Summers:  Michelle TrachtenbergAnya:  Emma CaulfieldGlory:  Clare KramerJoyce:  Kristine SutherlandMr. Giles:  Anthony Stewart Head.Here's the basics.  After a tiring battle with Adam, and weird dreams about the First Slayer, Buffy begins to truly understand her role, and asks Giles to be her watcher again.  No sooner does this happen that a new big bad is in town and she means business.  Her name is Glory, or Glorificus, depending on who's calling her.  She's is seemingly indestructable, and is looking for a key to open up her home hell dimension.  That key is new sister, Dawn, who for some reason everyone thinks has been around since the beginning.  With Joyce falling ill, and more pressure falling on Buffy, things get interesting with:  Tara's family, Spike's love, Riley's fix with vampires, Joyce's death, Drusilla's return, Buffybot, Tara's mindwarp, Dawn's kidnapping, and Buffy's catatonia.  And the end shows exactly what teamwork and sacrifice is all about, and how strong the scoobies are in friendship and strength when they are all together, all leading into the most impressive, exciting, and tear-jerking season finale yet.Now why is this superior?  The scoobies are truly tested at an emotional level, and start to show some growth, and an increasing amount of loyalty to each other, even Spike.  Honestly, the episodes starting with Checkpoint til the end of the season are honestly the pinnacle of the series.  There are so many twists and turns, cruelty, love, redemption, sadness, and loss.  Buffy further learns the true meaning of her gift, and her heart, and the immense love she has for her friends and family.This show isn't just about monsters and defeating the big bad.  It's about growing up, friendship, love, loyalty and change.  It's about strength in numbers, and strength of soul.  Everyone's desires to help out, and how now everybody has become an integral part of the team.  This season was truly and honor to watch, and worth every penny.  I wholeheartedly suggest that you ignore the critics who say that Buffy went downhill after season 3, because it most certainly did not.",5,Absolutely riveting...,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,2913,"['had', 'been', 'told', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'series', 'downhill', 'Season', '3', 'believe', 'somewhat', 'Season', '4', 'thought', 'introduction', 'Initiative', 'was', 'stretching', 'little', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'choppiness', 'had', 'go', 'phase', 'get', 'incredible', 'season', 'far', 'best', 'show', 'Let', 'start', 'best', 'episodes', 'Buffs', 'Vs.', 'Dracula', 'Replacement', 'super', 'funny', 'Place', 'Home', 'Into', 'Woods', 'thank', 'god', 'Checkpoint', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Body', 'Forever', 'Tough', 'Love', 'Spiral', 'Weight', 'World', 'THE', 'GIFT', 'best', 'Buffy', 'episode', 'ever', '.Cast', 'Characters', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'GellarXander', 'Harris', 'Nicholas', 'BrendanWillow', 'Rosenberg', 'Alyson', 'HanniganTara', 'Amber', 'James', 'MarstersRiley', 'Marc', 'BlucasDawn', 'Summers', 'Michelle', 'TrachtenbergAnya', 'Emma', 'CaulfieldGlory', 'Clare', 'KramerJoyce', 'Kristine', 'SutherlandMr', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head.Here', 'basics', 'tiring', 'battle', 'Adam', 'weird', 'dreams', 'First', 'Slayer', 'Buffy', 'truly', 'understand', 'role', 'Giles', 'be', 'watcher', 'again', 'No', 'sooner', 'happen', 'new', 'big', 'bad', 'town', 'business', 'name', 'Glory', 'Glorificus', 'depending', 'who', 'calling', 'seemingly', 'indestructable', 'looking', 'key', 'open', 'up', 'home', 'hell', 'dimension', 'key', 'new', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'who', 'reason', 'everyone', 'been', 'beginning', 'Joyce', 'falling', 'ill', 'more', 'pressure', 'falling', 'Buffy', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'Tara', 'family', 'Spike', 'love', 'Riley', 'fix', 'vampires', 'Joyce', 'death', 'Drusilla', 'return', 'Buffybot', 'Tara', 'mindwarp', 'Dawn', 'kidnapping', 'Buffy', 'catatonia', 'end', 'exactly', 'what', 'teamwork', 'sacrifice', 'how', 'strong', 'scoobies', 'are', 'friendship', 'strength', 'when', 'are', 'together', 'leading', 'most', 'impressive', 'exciting', 'tear-jerking', 'season', 'finale', 'yet.Now', 'why', 'superior', 'scoobies', 'are', 'truly', 'tested', 'emotional', 'level', 'start', 'show', 'growth', 'increasing', 'amount', 'loyalty', 'other', 'even', 'Spike', 'Honestly', 'episodes', 'starting', 'Checkpoint', 'til', 'end', 'season', 'are', 'honestly', 'pinnacle', 'series', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'cruelty', 'love', 'redemption', 'sadness', 'loss', 'Buffy', 'further', 'true', 'meaning', 'gift', 'heart', 'immense', 'love', 'friends', 'family.This', 'show', ""n't"", 'just', 'monsters', 'defeating', 'big', 'bad', 'growing', 'up', 'friendship', 'love', 'loyalty', 'change', 'strength', 'numbers', 'strength', 'soul', 'Everyone', 'desires', 'help', 'out', 'how', 'now', 'everybody', 'become', 'integral', 'part', 'team', 'season', 'was', 'truly', 'honor', 'watch', 'worth', 'penny', 'wholeheartedly', 'suggest', 'ignore', 'critics', 'who', 'say', 'Buffy', 'went', 'downhill', 'season', '3', 'most', 'certainly', 'did', 'not']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

767067,AUPYKCIQEITAS,B0000AQS18,Cinephile,"[7, 11]","The fifth season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER feels casual, exuding, particularly in its first few episodes, an almost thrown-together quality.  Coming off of season four, which contains some of the show's best episodes but probably has its weakest &quot;arc&quot; up to that point, Season Five seems to be following a similar line.  It is funny, well-staged, and full of fascinating new characters and developments, but it is difficult, at first, to get a bead on where the season is going.A friend of mine says most dramatic shows have five or six good years in them, before decline sets in or they are cancelled, and I think she's right. NYPD BLUE worked for six years before it collapsed under the weight of too many teen-idol replacements for Smits and Caruso; THE WEST WING's fifth season was a travesty without Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme around to guide things; and even a sitcom like FRIENDS, whose character arcs resemble those of dramatic programs, had a hard time keeping things interesting after year five. There's no set formula, of course, but it's fair to say that a program's cast and crew might get a little bored after awhile, might have trouble finding new shadings for their characters or new spins on their environments, and might begin to take it easy and coast.  Seen in this light, the initial slacker quality of BUFFY year five becomes both more comprehensible and also a little ominous-- when a program's first episode is given the distinctly Marvel Comics-esque title &quot;Buffy v. Dracula,&quot; its not hard to imagine the blood in the water and the sharks circling.Such fears were, for many fans, confirmed by the appearance of Dawn, Buffy's heretofore unseen, uncommented-upon little sister.  Some fans and critics immediately dubbed her &quot;Oliver,&quot; a reference to the mysterious &quot;cousin&quot; that appeared in later seasons of THE BRADY BUNCH, and whose name has become shorthand for a show's desperate attempts to add characters and keep things alive near the end.  Who was this strange, annoying little girl?  Why had we never seen her?  And why was every character on the show already acting as if we had?As if the &quot;new relative&quot; gambit wasn't enough, BUFFY' s writers also tossed in the Mysterious Illness ploy for Buffy's mom, and the Hot New Relationship plot for Buffy and Spike, in what initially seems like a wan attempt to recreate the old magic of Buffy and Angel.  By the time, in episode six, Tara's family arrives to inform the Scooby Gang (and viewers) that this quiet girl has a Dark Secret, fans can be forgiven for thinking that the WB had secretly switched our usual BUFFY blend with episodes of GUIDING LIGHT.Silly us-- with ep seven, &quot;Fool For Love,&quot; everything clicks into place, plot points are clarified, and suddenly it all begins to make sense, and to take on a tremendous emotional power.  The remaining fifteen episodes are some of the show's best, and looking at the season as a whole four years after its initial airing, it's remarkable how cohesive it really is.  One of the major themes of the year is deception, and by offering their audience a seemingly loose and occasionally incomprehensible start to the year, creator/auteur Joss Whedon and his staff were able to place viewers in roughly the same emotional position as their characters.By the time Season Five rolled around, Mutant Enemy knew it had a hit on its hands, and an intensely loyal fan base.  They could now take their show (and its viewers) to different places, and really get under the skins of their characters.  They had been doing this all along, of course, but Seasons Five and Six of BUFFY are full of a desire and yearning that is dark, fascinating, and sometimes unsettling.  Far from coasting to syndication, the show would take more chances than ever.It's notable that both Seasons Two and Five come, on DVD, in red/reddish boxes-- a color of passion, heartache, blood, and love.  Season Five finds the show's characters undergoing a level of trauma not seen since the second half of Season Two, and the final resolution of that trauma is, like the end of season two, both gut-wrenching and utterly logical.  I won't give more detail than that, except to note, again, how well-paced this year is, interspersing more dramatic eps with funny ones, allowing moments for the whole ensemble to shine, and keeping the flow so loose and unpredictable that, when twists and suprises come, they really are twists and surprises.This was also a year of behind-the-scenes goodbyes:  it was the last season shot by Buffy's great secret weapon, cinematographer Michael Gershman, whose beautiful balance of dark and light (in all senses) had held the show together since its first episode; it was the last year to prominently feature the lush scores of composer Christophe Beck, whose strings had always sonically captured the beautiful adolescent passions of the characters; it was the last full season for Anthony Stewart Head (Giles), whose character would continue to appear, but only in recurring &quot;guest star&quot; status; and it was the last year the show would appear on the WB, since contract negotiatons and public spatting led to the show's vamoosing to the UPN network the following year (this also meant it was the last time-- for awhile-- that there would be character crossovers between BUFFY and ANGEL, since the latter continued to air on the WB, which imposed a &quot;ban&quot; on such occurences after BUFFY left home).In so many ways, then, Season Five marks a turning point for BUFFY, a year in which, even for a show which had always taken chances, questions of change and growth seemed central, both within the narrative and on a stylistic level.  I wouldn't start watching BUFFY with Season Five, but it's a crucial year for a crucial show, and well worth one's time.",5,deceptions,1089849600,"07 15, 2004",2004,5861,"['fifth', 'season', 'BUFFY',

767069,AE2KCASMQPMO,B0000AQS18,"C. Meja ""CMM""","[10, 12]","Buffy's fifth season has been called one of the best seasons of the show: it includes one of those rare and almost hypnotic episodes I love so much in TV (like in The X-Files episodes Milagro and all things, and in Buffy's fourth season: Restless), it is The Body. It also introduces Buffy's sister, Dawn, who appears in the end of the first episode of the season. I couldn't help but to feel stranged with her: &iquest;Buffy has a sister? And this is the feeling the season moves around. How everything changes once Buffy discovers that Dawn is not really her sister, but an ancient ball of energy which is searched by a powerfull being called Glory: she needs this ball of energy called The Key to unlock the limits between dimensions, which will allow her to return to her dimension. During the season, everything moves around the realization of what wants Dawn, what does it want it for, and how can they stop that without killing Dawn.The season begins with a somewhat regular episode... it is a shame because it was written by Marti Noxon. Buffy vs. Dracula says everything in its title, and the only really good thing about this one is that it has Buffy begining to wonder about her powers. It really came from the closure of season four, Restless. Where does the power of the slayer come from? The subsequent episodes elaborate around the other characters (in Real me, we get to know Dawn and we meet Harmony once again; in The Replacement the shows achieves to show Xander's growth without really destroying the character we've seen for four years; in Out of my mind Riley experiences the consequences of what the Initiative and Maggie Walsh did with his body). In episode 5: No place like home, takes place Buffy's discovery. She also faces Glory for the first time and learns that this villain is much more than a simple demon.The following episodes keep taking the supporting characters further: in Family we get to see how much Tara has become a member of the scooby gang; in Fool for love (one of the best if not the best episode of the season) Spike's background is shown (and, very important, by the end of it Spike's careness for Buffy is beautifully achieved in a very moving scene where he is not able to kill Buffy when he has his chance, instead he comforts her).Shadow and Listening to fear deal with Glory again, and with Joyce's illness. Into the woods turns the focus onto Riley once again, but in order to say goodbye to him. Triangle deals with the relationship Xander-Anya-Willow. How he is torn between the two of them.Ckeckpoint and Bloodties return to the arc of the key. The council reappears to show to Buffy why is it that Glory is so powerfull, and then comes Dawn's discovery that she is the key.Then comes Crush, another really great episode, where Spike's love for Buffy comes out. Also, one of the best characters of the series returns: Drusila. Harmony reappears as well, so Spike's three women are together for him to choose between, but in the end he realizes he only wants Buffy.In I was made to love you the series introduces Warren (very important character in the sixth season), a nerd who makes a robot to please him. The best thing of this episode is the schocking closing scene. Then comes The Body: Joyce is dead... and the whole episode is that fact in the mind of the characters. Intervention is another great episode: Spike forces Warren to make him a Buffy robot that can please him.As the end approaches Glory and the cruzades surround Buffy. Finally Glory gets Dawn and has a bunch mad men making a tower, where the final battle in The Gift takes place.Here is my top 10 for Buffy's fifth season:10. Tough love (Buffy learns that Dawn can be taken away from her... and Tara is taken away from Willow).9. Real Me8. The replacement (Xander is hit by a demon's ray and suddenly, there are two Xanders: is the one around his friends a demon?)7. Checkpoint (the council informs Buffy about the key and Glory).6. The Gift (it is the final battle and Buffy has to sacrifice something to save the world. will it be her sister?5. Intervention (While Buffy learns in the desert that death is her gift, Spike entertains himself with the Buffy-bot... but they are seen by Xander and Anya).4. Into the woods (Buffy's discovers Riley's darkest secret: he likes to get bitten by female vampires).3. Crush2. Fool for love (we get to see how Spike killed two slayers!)1.

767070,A2OSERGXBYMPJ0,B0000AQS18,C. T. Mikesell,"[3, 3]","I wasn't all that thrilled with the initial broadcast of Season Five. After the program left the WB, I was left out in the cold without UPN in my cable lineup; I wound up watching it in 6-hour marathons after my sister sent me a tape (coincidentally, six weeks or so apart). That's no way to enjoy the show; I realize after watching this DVD set it should be 4-hour marathons, every day for a week (six days for the episodes, one for the bonus materials).There are some very nice touches in Season Five. Certainly, ""The Body"" was dramatic and the entire ""Decline of Ms. Joyce Summers"" was well handled, but there were smaller things that I think make the season successful. First of all, there's the ""Maturation of Xander Harris"" arc. From the ""nobody's butt-monkey"" line in the season opener, clear through to his proposal in the season finale, Xander did a lot of growing up in Season Five. Likewise, Anya came to terms with not only her mortality, but also her humanity: her speech in ""The Body,"" not only recognizing that people die, but that there are expectations as to how the survivors behave, was one of the more poignant moments in the episode. Spike also became more human in this season - okay, not literally, but he established an emotional link with Buffy that begins his redemption arc that stretches to the series finale. I'm pretty much Dawn-neutral (it wasn't until Season Six where the same ""shelter Dawn"" note is played over and over and over again that I became annoyed with her character, and maybe that'll change after I get the next DVD set); her character had to go through the same growing pains that the rest of the cast did four seasons earlier so I wasn't in a hurry to judge her this time around.The DVD has some good extras. If you normally watch the show dubbed in a foreign language, then the ""Buffy Abroad"" featurette will be less interesting to you than might otherwise have been the case. The featurettes on Dawn and ""The Body"" are informative looks at what the producers and writers were shooting for. The keyhole animation that transitions you from the menu into the episode gets old fast. ""Previously"" and ""Next Week"" synopses would have been nice additions, but weren't included. The DVD-ROM demon guide is well-constructed if not overly deep; Danny Strong's demon featurette is poor in comparison.If you're a Buffy fan you'll be buying this set regardless of the reviews ... fortunately you'll likely be pleased with your purchase. If you're not yet a Buffy fan, start with Season One, watch four episodes a day and you'll be here by the end of the month.

767074,A3R8DRD4NU7UFN,B0000AQS18,"""dawnpatrolrockermark""","[0, 1]","Season 5 BuFFy is once again a fantastic addition to this fun series..A few more set changes are involved like in season 4..For one Giles buys the Magick Shop..And now that is the ""Scoobies"" headquarters..I never watched this show on tv coz i must admit i was then sceptical coz of the 1992 film..I just started to watch the dvd sets in Oct 2003..The more i get & watch these dvd sets the more i fall in love with this show..It is one of the best shows of all time..The only show (and Angel) that can stand side by side with the classic shows that we grew up with..And this season is proof that every season just keeps on getting better with every passing season..Highlights of this always great series in its 4th season is ""BuFFy VS. Dracula"" the name exsplains it all a showdown that Buffy had to face at some point during the show..The actor who played Dracula also played Dracula in a movie ""Dracula : Dark Prince"" from the same year 2000..Xander in this episode lampoons the ""Renfield"" character from the classic immortal vampire story..""Real Me"" Introduces the character of ""Dawn"" Buffy's suddon apperance teenage sister..""The Replacement"" is a HILARIOUS Double Xander episode (remember the double WiLLow episodes from season 4)..Watch for Xander's ""Snoopy Dance"" is plain silly but will make you laugh so hard..In ""No place like home"" reveals the secret behind who Dawn really is and where she came from..""Family"" is about Tara's Family featuring Amy Adams & what Tara may or may not be..""Fool For Love"" is a long overdue episode about the past centuries of Spike..Even how he became a vampire..Watch for on the Subway is Spike's full out Billy Idol immitation..""Listening to Fear"" the booklet says its a spider like monster..It is actully more of a slug caterpiller like Monster..Words of Giles & Xander can say it best ""A Killer Snot Monster From Outer Space"" how bout that for a B Movie sci fi title of the 50s..LoL..""Triangle"" is a battle with a Troll who used to date Anya in her demon days..He bares a remarkable resemblance to Jessie Ventura..""Blood Ties"" Dawn finds out the truth of who she really is..Links up with Spike..The result is Michelle ""Dawn"" powerful performance..""Crush"" is a fun love triangle BuFFy Harmony And the return of Druscilla all with the fun as alwayS Spike..""I was made to love you"" a HOT robot girl comes to Sunnydale looking for the guy who created her to love him..""The Body"" never has an episode ever hit me as this one did..So much so i have no idea if i can take it again..Emotional..I don't want to ruin it but when Dawn gets the bad news the way they filmed it with barely audible silence is very original and very effective..They use silence a few times here and it really hits the viewer..Very little but some comedy relief..I challage you to take it without ripping your heart out..""Forever"" another team up of Dawn and Spike to bring the person that dies in ""The Body"" back from the dead..""Intervention"" A BuFFy robot a Buffybot to love and please Spike..And all of last disc is more then remarkable as the story of Dawn's destiny as the key comes to a head in true BuFFy climax fashion..Needless to say as always hard to choose highlights from ANY BuFFy Seasons..This season is the debut of BuFFy's Teen Sister ""Dawn""..She is remarkably played by Michelle Trachtenburg..Picture a bratty version of Willow..She even looks lot like Willow from the first few seasons..Should've been Willow's sister they look so much alike..Only difference Dawn has dark hair..She is so cute beautiful girl in the tradition of this show having the sexiest girls..I am told she is older then she plays..She is a wonderful addition to the club..In Xander's words he calls Dawn ""DAWNPATROL""..This set again has great insightful & fun extras..Featurettes a plenty..This set has something that was more then a pleasant suprise that sadly the other sets didn't have..Outakes/Bloopers..I was excited when i saw that..A show that is this much fun you can tell the cast is having fun..Its a wonder never shared the Outakes Bloopers til now..Thanks for sharing them with us finally..And a fantastic featurette all about Dawn..Among other treats from BuFFyLand..Some on disc 3 some on disc 4..Enjoy..I end this review by saying collect all the Buffy seasons on dvd..They keep getting better with every season..And this season # 5 is proof of that fact..This tv series never lets you down but always delivers better then any modern day series can..Truly one of a kind series..Now we await anxiously Season 6 in May..*does Xander's Snoopy dance and signs off til May* ScOOby SnackS For ALL :)LOL:)",5,"Take A Ride With

767077,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B0000AQS18,D. Mok,"[1, 3]","After the mixed results of Season 4 on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I held off for a long time on seeing Season 5.  But when I finally did, my faith in the series was neatly restored.The producers kept the strange narrative experiments to a manageable level in this season and went for muscular plot and character developments instead, and they reapt the handsome rewards.  Whedon and his writers talk in the featurettes about ""bringing the show back to family"", and we see that this well is never dry.  I'm not a big fan of ""The Body"", an expressionistic meditation on grief that's bold in execution, but also unengaging in its distantness.  It's as close to Brechtian Verfremdung (""alienation"") as I've seen in a TV show.  Daring, but also unmoving -- it took ensuing episode ""Forever"" to get back to the heart of the matter.  The beginning of the season also lags, with the season premier introducing uber-vampire Dracula, who proceeds to yak about evil and darkness and psychosexual melodrama for 40 minutes.Other than these two duds, though, the show rips into some harrowing emotional territory -- and some of the sharpest comedic writing since Season 2.  By now we expect no less than magic from Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon, and they never disappoint.  Newcomer Michelle Trachtenberg is radiant as Dawn, equal parts bratty adolescent, volcanic emotional wreck, and smart-aleck pottymouth.  Emma Caulfield and James Marsters, as ex-demon Anya and perennial vampire favourite Spike, finally get the character layers they've always deserved, and Caulfield's straight-faced weirdness provides the season with some of its best jokes.  Clare Kramer is also great as Glory, a hellfire entity with the strength of mountains and a mess of loose screws in her head.  I was shocked to see how different she is in interviews.  The one character who doesn't work is Riley -- his chemistry with Buffy has never been strong, but in this season, without a grounding central plot that's integral to him, he simply carries no emotional weight, and actor Marc Blucas' comic timing just pales alongside the unpredictable energy of Trachtenberg and old pros like Hannigan and Marsters.  No Eliza Dushku guest appearance either, sadly (you have to go to the Angel show for that).The storylines are engaging, with the Dawn story being the deserved centerpiece, culminating in a slamming finale that's the best Buffy finale I've ever seen, and possibly the best directing work I've seen from creator Joss Whedon.  Spike's warped attraction to Buffy is a stretch, but resolves beautifully near the end; Willow and Tara (the lovable Amber Benson)'s relationship nearly brought me to tears; and Xander's growing relationship to Anya is hugely satisfying, especially to old fans of the show who have known Xander from the beginning.This season is like a shot of adrenalin to the series, rejuvenating a series that was getting a bit long in the tooth.

Even though the following two seasons were bad at times I was still thankful to have two more seasons afterward.  I hated the character Adam from the prior season and was so happy to get a strong villain in Glory, wrapped up in a mythological tale this season.  People can go on and on complaining about Dawn but I'm sure they are just seeing the annoying things within themselves that they certainly experienced during their early teen years.  I was fascinated when they introduced her to the show and I liked her character this season ( Unfortunately they didn't strengthen her much the following seasons ).  She became an integral part of the mythology this season and definetly wrapped a great deal of emotion in the season ender ""The Gift"", one of the most heartfelt moments in television history.  This episode was pure emotion in which our hero selflessly gives her life to save mankind.

767079,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B0000AQS18,DonAthos,"[6, 7]","Buffy's Fifth Season is narrowly clipped by the Second Season as the best of the series. But only narrowly.The Fifth Season is tremendous. There is not one bad episode in it, and several stand-outs (Buffy vs. Dracula, Into the Woods, Fool For Love, The Gift) and one that deserves mention as being a work of art that television almost doesn't deserve, The Body.I do not wish to give too much away, but allow me to say that The Body concerns a character's death. You would think, given that Buffy revolves around Vampires (and other undead/demon nasties), given that there are deaths in every episode, that it would be difficult to create an episode that, all of a sudden, treats death as a mature, deep and profound topic. You would think that it would be hard for the show to make a death compelling, even difficult to watch. You would think that right until you actually saw the episode in question, after which you would be writing a review next to mind to convince other people to take a chance on this series. I have heard people describe The Body as the most realistic portrayal of death they'd ever seen. I have heard people say it is the best episode of television, ever. I can only say that it is one of the pinnacles of a show that is, itself, a pinnacle of its chosen medium.The fifth season also contains the best work from beloved regular Xander, a fun and daunting villainess and the wonderful addition of Michelle Trachtenberg. You will be tempted, when her character is introduced, to be angry at the show. Don't. Have some faith in the show (its earned it by now) and it will make itself good, I promise. The fifth season also has one of the greatest climaxes of all time (only upped by Becoming and possibly The Return of the King) in The Gift. The Gift, itself, is a rollercoaster ride of an episode which amazingly makes conscious use of something from almost every episode preceding it in the season. Buffy is a testament to consistency, continuity and fan-appreciation.The Fifth Season is either the best or the second-best season in a show that does not have equal.",5,"The Greatest Show of All Time, pt. 5",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2088,"['Buffy', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'narrowly', 'clipped', 'Second', 'Season', 'best', 'series', 'only', 'narrowly.The', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'tremendous', 'not', 'one', 'bad', 'episode', 'several', 'stand-outs', 'Buffy', 'vs.', 'Dracula', 'Into', 'Woods', 'Fool', 'Love', 'Gift', 'one', 'mention', 'being', 'work', 'art', 'television', 'almost', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Body.I', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'allow', 'say', 'Body', 'character', 'death', 'would', 'think', 'given', 'Buffy', 'Vampires', 'other', 'undead/demon', 'nasties', 'given', 'are', 'deaths', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'create', 'episode', 'sudden', 'treats', 'death', 'mature', 'deep', 'profound', 'topic', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'show', 'make', 'death', 'compelling', 'even', 'difficult', 'watch', 'would', 'think', 'right', 'actually', 'saw', 'episode', 'question', 'would', 'be', 'writing', 'review', 'mind', 'convince', 'other', 'people', 'take', 'chance', 'series', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'describe', 'Body', 'most', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'death', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'best', 'episode', 'television', 'ever', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'one', 'pinnacles', 'show', 'pinnacle', 'chosen', 'medium.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'also', 'best', 'work', 'beloved', 'regular', 'Xander', 'fun', 'daunting', 'villainess', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'will', 'be', 'tempted', 'when', 'character', 'introduced', 'be', 'angry', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Have', 'faith', 'show', 'earned', 'now', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'promise', 'fifth', 'season', 'also', 'one', 'greatest', 'climaxes', 'time', 'only', 'upped', 'Becoming', 'possibly', 'Return', 'King', 'Gift', 'Gift', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'episode', 'amazingly', 'conscious', 'use', 'something', 'almost', 'episode', 'preceding', 'season', 'Buffy', 'testament', 'consistency', 'continuity', 'fan-appreciation.The', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'best', 'second-best', 'season', 'show', 'not', 'have', 'equal']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season
767080,A2QOQKEG2VTX48,B0000AQS18,DONNA J. MILLER,"[1, 2]","Within every great television series, the characters have had to mature and deal with adult situations as they grew up. &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer- Season Five&quot; is a great example of how the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; series started out as a show about a group of friends in High School and College, and by the end of the fifth season they were now grown into their own people. This is a great season in the show due to its great assembly of characters, real life problems, and awesome story. For sure, the fifth season of &quot;Buffy&quot; will be one you will love if you are a true Buffy fan.To start, I have never really seen a show with a better assembled cast of characters. Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is still dealing with the problem of being a vampire slayer and also trying to fit into the world. Her friends are all finding places in their lives during this season, and for once growing up and supporting themselves. Xander (Nicholas Brendan) continues his construction job and even begins to get promoted and starts thinking about marriage to his ex-vengeance demon girlfriend Anya (Emma Caufield). Willow (Alyson Hannigan) is still in a growing relationship with Tara (Amber Benson), going to UC Sunnydale, and becoming a very gifted wicca. Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) has found a job as the owner of a store called 'The Majic Box' which Anya also works at. Riley (Mark Blucas) is still Buffy's boyfriend but their dieing relationship ends up causing more problems for both of them than expected. The only people not completely satisfied with life are Buffy and the vampire punk Spike (James Marsters) who is realizing that he has feelings for the slayer, his once great enemy. Besides Spike's obsession with her, Buffy must deal with two other problems- her mother's (Kristine Sutherland) growing illness and her sister Dawn (Michelle Tratchenberg), whom she soon discovers is not her real sister but a ball of energy called The Key sent to the slayer by Monks to protect it from a hell goddess known as Glory (Claire Kramer) who is not only evil but also hilarious and ditzy at the same time.Next, although Buffy is a show that is not real, and really never could be, Joss Wheadon and his crew do a great job placing real life problems and situations into the story- such as Buffy's mom's tumor, an annoying little sister who is more than she appears, Willow and Tara's unusual relationship, Xander's debating about marriage, and even Buffy having to drop out of college to take care of her family. Yes, it is true that even though Buffy is make believe, you can still connect with it just as well as any other show.Finally, the all out season was just great. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendan, and Anthony Stewart Head do usual spectacualr jobs playing characters that go through all the normal emotions, such as loss, joy, confusion- and even the end of the world. Emma Caufield and Claire Kramer make their characters come to life with some funny moments and having their characters, who are from other dimensions, have to deal and adjust to the human world. Kristine Sutherland and Amber Benson are great for their overlooked roles, and Michelle Tratchenberg joins the cast with a bang as an annoying and mysterious teenage girl who we all know is more than she seems. James Marsters nearly steals many episodes again with his classic character Spike, who now becomes a great and exciting character in the show that you love and hate at the same time. The only character I have a problem with is Riley, played by Mark Blucas, who seems rather unfit to be in Buffy's world. His character is too 'nice' and just has no chemistry with Buffy. But that problem is not large at all considering the amount of greatness put into the show. Mercedes McNabb, Juliet Landau, Charlie Webber, and others guest star and are all just simply awesome.To conclude, this is a great season to a great show. It's a step up from the somewhat dull fourth season, and can hold its own. It has several stand out episodes, and just has an amazing four part ending, and many other episodes in it that are all around good. The villain, Glory, is both threatening and has a connection to Buffy, not to mention her family, and a good villain creates a fun season. The relationships once again are all tested, and Joss Wheadon has proven that even after five years, he's not done with this classic show. For any Buffy fan.",5,The Slayer. The Goddess.

767082,A3W0S9MR4A959D,B0000AQS18,dramadude 186,"[10, 11]","Having seen every season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; in its entirety, I can say without a doubt Season Five is my absolute favorite.  It doesn't have the series' best episode (Season Six's &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot;) or the show's best villain (the unholy Angelis/Spike/Drusilla alliance in Season Two), but as a whole nothing can top the plot and pathos of Season Five.This is the season that introduced us to Buffy's younger sister Dawn, and while in later seasons she had a tendancy to come off as whiny, here she provides the basis for one of the most beautiful relationships ever portrayed on the show.  The dynamic between Buffy and Dawn runs the gamut from loathing to love and everything in between, but above all it is about the utter love and devotion these sisters have for one another.  In one of the special features, Joss Whedon is quoted as saying &quot;Buffy's love interest for Season Five is her sister,&quot; and this couldn't be more true.  Their sisterly bond is deeply touching and totally convincing.But the Buffy-Dawn relationship is only the tip of the emotional iceberg in a tightly plotted season that also sees the death of a major figure in Buffy's life.  &quot;The Body&quot; is one of the series' strongest episodes, and its frank look at the consequences of a person's death will surely strike a chord with viewers.  Grounding this episode (and indeed, the entire series) is Sarah Michelle Gellar's consistantly strong performance as Buffy Summers.  She is at once empowered, humorous, charming, and yet still a vulnerable girl struggling with the relaties of life.And of course, there's the season finale, the heart-breaking &quot;The Gift.&quot;  One of the most emotionally powerful episodes of the series, it brings all the narrative threads of the season together in a way words can't begin to describe.  I won't spoil the ending, but anyone who saw the episode when it aired can tell you it's some powerful stuff.  If your prone to crying during movies, you better have a box of Kleenex handy.Season Five of &quot;Buffy&quot; works so well as a whole it's hard to believe the writers hadn't carefully plotted every little twist before penning the first script.  The tight narrative consistantly builds on itself in ways that surprise and yet make perfect sense.

The addition of Dawn was a bit surprising since you don't know where she came from until a few episodes into it.  Glory and the whole Key plotline was incredible.  That's probably the best villain on the entire show.  Then it gets even better when you learn the connection between Glory and Ben!

767089,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B0000AQS18,Garrett Aja,"[5, 7]","After the Scooby Gang nearly imploded in Season 4, a concerted effort to focus on family in Season 5. To that end, there's a major emphasis on Buffy's Mom and Dawn, Buffy's sister (who is in fact The Key, a mystical ball of energy, in human form). However, even with this emphasis on the cast, character development would suffer in places. In particular is Tara, who despite Amber Benson's excellent performances, isn't given much to do except be Willow's girlfriend (a matter specifically broached in &quot;Family&quot;, and then left largely ignored until &quot;Tough Love&quot;, an episode that results in Tara being rendered insane until the last episode of the season). As such, the people who were unhappy with the Willow/Tara relationship (and even a few, like myself, who fully accepted the pairing) were presented with a 'ship that at times seemed to be there to cash in on the underlying social implications of two women together on television.Also annoying to some were Spike (who quickly began to take over the show in the eyes of some as soon as his Buffy obsession became known) and Dawn (who's a spazzy 14 year old, so no surprise there). However, the biggest problem seems to lie with Glory. While certainly a formidable villain, Glory is simply not as compelling as some of the previous Big Bads (but a definite step up from ADAM and the Initiative).Despite these qualms, Season 5 was blessed with some truly excellent episodes and moments. Besides &quot;The Body&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot; (both major triumphs for the cast and Joss Whedon) are &quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Replacement&quot;, &quot;Fool For Love&quot;, &quot;Triangle&quot;, and &quot;I Was Made to Love You&quot;. Unfortunately present is &quot;Listening to Fear&quot;, which easily the worst Buffy episode since Season 2's &quot;Go Fish&quot; (an episode that was blessed with some classic moments, unlike the latter episode).The DVD set is very similar to previous sets, with a smattering of commentaries (although one is sorely missing for &quot;The Gift&quot;) and scripts. The documentaries are also standard here, except for &quot;Demonology: A Slayer's Guide&quot;, which is hosted by Danny Strong and is definitely tongue-in-cheek. There are, however, two things sorely missing in the set. First is a featurette on the brewing issues between Mutant Enemy and The WB which would lead to the network switch (and was a major driving factor in how Season 5 ended). Second is the &quot;Previously on...&quot; segement for &quot;The Gift&quot;, which set up that episode perfectly, and featured images from each of the preceding 99 episodes of the series. Given that TV shows ranging from Dawson's Creek to The Transformers have been released on DVD with recaps and even syndicated commercial bumpers intact, this extremely important omission is quite disturbing.

Complicating matters are the serious illness of Buffy's mother, the sudden appearance of a previously unknown little sister, and the unwanted affections of former foe Spike.

This last one, ""The Body,"" has been touted not only as one of this series' absolutely best episodes but one of the best episodes of any show ever broadcast on television, period. ""The Body"" starkly deals with the death of a loved one in a way that is heart-wrenching and pulls no punches. I'd be lying if I said that watching it didn't affect me. The cast's acting, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar's, is phenomenal.BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, with its deep digging into themes of angst and alienation and dark impulses, just may have been the best teen drama of its era. In Season Five Joss Whedon continues the down spiraling to ever-darkening territory. But first, we're greeted with the sudden arrival of Dawn, the 14-year-old sister Buffy (and everyone else) never knew she had, and this W.T.F? moment won't be explained until several episodes into the thing. This season is when Spike officially became my favorite vampire, when his admittedly twisted but ultimately sincere pining for Buffy gave formal license for viewers to really pull for him. But, of course, that no-harm-to-human chip was still implanted in his brain. The featured Big Bad is inspired, I thought. Glorificus first comes in, and what we see is this pretty blonde girl who, physically, looks like someone Buffy would just roll over in a skirmish. Except that Glory proceeds to wipe the floor with the Slayer. At this stage of the series, Glory - who we eventually learn is a psychotic banished god - would be the most formidable Big Bad that Buffy had so far faced.Off the top of my head, my favorite bits: Giles taking over the Magic Box store and hiring Anya, and how this brings out Anya's capitalistic side; Spike's obsession with the daytime soap Passions; April the girlfriendbot and, later, the Buffybot and how the Buffybot plays a crucial part in Buffy and Spike's relationship; Willow's leveling up in power, and this would set up her magic addiction arc in Season Six; Buffy's verbal smackdown of the Watchers Council; and my two favorite lines in the season: ""Did anybody order an Apocalypse?"" and ""We band of buggered...""My least favorite bits: Buffy's vision quest, the Byzantium Knights, the mind-numbing Riley Finn. Joss Whedon, in one of the special features, stated that this season's central love story would be about Buffy and her sister. Looking back, the super-soldier and his feelings of inadequacy never really stood a chance.Can I just interject here how awesome Emma Caulfield is? As Anya, she's right up there with Spike as my favorite character, with her candor and her pretty and her howlingly funny inappropriateness.Layered storytelling, incredible cast chemistry, a mythology that only becomes richer. Each episode builds on the overarching storyline; and there isn't one dodgy episode. But three unmissable shows are ""Fool for Love"" (recounting Spike's origin), the remarkable ""The Body,"" and the season finale ""The Gift."" I also really like ""Triangle,"" the humorous troll episode.BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON comes in six DVDs and with oodles of bonus material: Audio Commentary on ""Real Me,"" ""Fool for Love,"" ""I Was Made to Love You,"" and ""The Body"" (this last one by Joss Whedon); Original Scripts for ""The Replacement"", ""Fool for Love"", ""Into the Woods,"" and ""Checkpoint""; ""Buffy Abroad"" explores the popularity of the show internationally (00:04:14 minutes long); ""Casting BUFFY"" - casting the actors, including the tidbit that Sarah Michelle Gellar was originally brought in to play ""Cordelia"" (00:06:51); ""Demonology: A Slayer's Guide"" - Danny Strong talks us thru the many demons and other supernatural beasties inhabiting Buffy's world (00:11:26); ""Action Heroes: The Stunts of BUFFY"" (00:11:28); Outtakes (from previous seasons, 00:02:12); ""The Story of Season 5"" is an overview of this season (00:27:49); ""Natural Causes"" is an in-depth breakdown of the episode ""The Body"" (00:09:19); ""Spotlight on Dawn"" (00:07:25); the trailer for the BUFFY video game ""Chaos Bleeds""; a DVD-ROM Buffy demon guide; and a Photo stills gallery.",4,"""We will bring you Bob Barker.

767095,ARI1LNCQQUM74,B0000AQS18,Heather M. Dumdei,"[5, 8]","My television passion used to be the X-Files. I watched BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER regularly but never made a huge fuss if I missed an episode or two. Season 5 of BUFFY changed all that.I hate to say it, but the unforgivable television ploy of introducing a younger character to keep a show fresh actually works for BUFFY. At least, it works in Season 5. Season 6 is a different story. Anyway, in Season 5, we meet Dawn, Buffy's new younger sister (don't worry - they will explain how Buffy suddenly has a young teenage sister in due time). A crazy fashion victim with wicked &uuml;ber-strength named Glory shows up in town searching for a key she claims was stolen from her. Riley and Buffy's relationship starts to go downhill. Buffy's mom, Joyce, gets sick, and suddenly Buffy finds herself in the role of caretaker. In one of my favorite developments on the show, Spike has a few revelations about himself and gets some intense character development as a result (""Fool for Love"", the episode where we learn the history of Spike, is one of the season's gems).Season 5 is a little slow at first, but once Joss&Co.; get the steam roller that is the season's over-arching plot going, it's arguably the best season of Buffy ever. As Buffy villains go, Glory is one of the more amusing. (I favor her second only to the Mayor from Season 3.) Dawn is annoying in that little sister way, but by the end of Season 5, I accepted her. (Of course, she starts to lose that acceptance with her behaviour in Season 6, but I digress.) Buffy and the Scoobies all take one more giant step away from childhood, and you can really begin to understand how this rather motley group has managed to save the world as many times as they have.And of course, there's ""The Body"". It is one of the most amazing hours of television ever to air. Joss Whedon trades the musical score for a haunting soundtrack of ambient noise and follows our gang around as they react to the news that one of their loved ones has died a natural death. It only covers a few hours of time in the Buffyverse, and there is no huge evil to overcome (well, one vampire, but hey, it's Sunnydale - that's just a normal day's work). The melodrama takes the week off,  and yet, if you have a sympathetic bone anywhere in your body, you won't be able to help crying at least once while watching it. (I always break during Anya's speech in Willow's room.)Other than a few key episodes, this is unlikely to be one of those seasons from which you get all your favorites, but at the end, the sum total will leave you feeling satisfied and glad you  hung in there for the long haul.",5,One of the Slayer's most solid seasons,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,2619,"['television', 'passion', 'used', 'be', 'X-Files', 'watched', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'regularly', 'never', 'made', 'huge', 'fuss', 'missed', 'episode', 'two', 'Season', '5', 'BUFFY', 'changed', 'that.I', 'hate', 'say', 'unforgivable', 'television', 'ploy', 'introducing', 'younger', 'character', 'keep', 'show', 'fresh', 'actually', 'BUFFY', 'least', 'Season', '5', 'Season', '6', 'different', 'story', 'Anyway', 'Season', '5', 'meet', 'Dawn', 'Buffy', 'new', 'younger', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'will', 'explain', 'how', 'Buffy', 'suddenly', 'young', 'teenage', 'sister', 'due', 'time', 'crazy', 'fashion', 'victim', 'wicked', 'uuml', 'ber-strength', 'named', 'Glory', 'up', 'town', 'searching', 'key', 'was', 'stolen', 'Riley', 'Buffy', 'relationship', 'go', 'downhill', 'Buffy', 'mom', 'Joyce', 'sick', 'suddenly', 'Buffy', 'role', 'caretaker', 'one', 'favorite', 'developments', 'show', 'Spike', 'few', 'revelations', 'intense', 'character', 'development', 'result', 'Fool', 'Love', 'episode', 'where', 'learn', 'history', 'Spike', 'one', 'season', 'gems', '.Season', '5', 'little', 'slow', 'first', 'once', 'Joss', 'Co', 'get', 'steam', 'roller', 'season', 'over-arching', 'plot', 'going', 'arguably', 'best', 'season', 'Buffy', 'ever', 'Buffy', 'villains', 'go', 'Glory', 'one', 'more', 'amusing', 'favor', 'second', 'only', 'Mayor', 'Season', '3', 'Dawn', 'annoying', 'little', 'sister', 'way', 'end', 'Season', '5', 'accepted', 'course', 'lose', 'acceptance', 'behaviour', 'Season', '6', 'digress', 'Buffy', 'Scoobies', 'take', 'one', 'more', 'giant', 'step', 'away', 'childhood', 'can', 'really', 'begin', 'understand', 'how', 'rather', 'motley', 'group', 'managed', 'save', 'world', 'many', 'times', 'have.And', 'course', 'Body', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'hours', 'television', 'ever', 'air', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'musical', 'score', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'ambient', 'noise', 'gang', 'around', 'react', 'news', 'one', 'loved', 'ones', 'died', 'natural', 'death', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'time', 'Buffyverse', 'huge', 'evil', 'overcome', 'well', 'one', 'vampire', 'hey', 'Sunnydale', 'just', 'normal', 'day', 'work', 'melodrama', 'week', 'yet', 'have', 'sympathetic', 'bone', 'anywhere', 'body', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'help', 'crying', 'least', 'once', 'watching', 'always', 'break', 'Anya', 'speech', 'Willow', 'room', 'Other', 'few', 'key', 'episodes', 'unlikely', 'be', 'one', 'seasons', 'get', 'favorites', 'end', 'sum', 'total', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'glad', 'hung', 'long', 'haul']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

767100,A1AIRJRJQCNU5L,B0000AQS18,"jackbauerfan ""jack""","[6, 12]","Season 5 of Buffy.  The first truly awful season.  And I mean awful.  After I watch season 4, I asked a friend of mine, who had already seen the whole series, if I should even bother watching the last three seasons.  She assured me that season 4 was just a small misstep, and that they pull it back together in this season.  So I rented season 5 and started watching it with a renewed sense of optimism.  When I finished the season, I had one thing to say. I'm surprised they were able to make two more seasons after this one.  The plot, the characters, the villians, Dawn, everything in this season was just awful.Okay, let me start at the beginning.  The first episode, ""Buffy vs Dracula, was not horrible.  Dracula seemed sort of stupid when I first saw the episode.  But once I realized who the main villian of this season was, I was begging for her to be removed, and for Dracula to come back.  Compared to the rest of the season, this episode was okay.  But at the end of this episode, we get introduced to Dawn.  Uuugggghhhhhh.  I could not stand her.  At first, I actually thought they were just going to pretend she had been there the whole time.  I'm serious.  I thought they were were overwriting the previous seasons and saying that Buffy had always had a younger sister.  But when they explained how Dawn had gotten there, I was overjoyed.  I thought she would be gone sometime soon, since her character was so annoying.  Instead, they decided to keep her on for the rest of the series.  Despite the fans abject hatred towards this character, the writers kept her on for the last three seasons of the show.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS??????  Dawn has got to be one of the most pointless, brattiest, annoying characters in fiction.  Now I know Dawn is sort of supposed to be annoying.  But they didn't do it right.  She should have been annoying to the rest of the characters, but not to the audience.  Look at Spike in season 4, when he first got the chip put in his head.  The rest of the cast couldn't stand him.  But we loved him.  We loved every moment of screen time he had.  Neither the audience, nor the rest of the characters could stand her.  She served no purpose other than to make our lives miserable.I didn't care for most of the other characters in this season.  Now I don't know about you guys but, as far as I'm concerned, the characters get less and less likeable after season 3.  I mean it.  Willow turning gay, Xander basically becoming a deadbeat, Buffy turning 20 and still acting like she's 16, they all went downhill.  The only exception was Giles.  I actually started to like him more in the later seasons.  It's too bad he stopped being a regular character after this season.  The rest of the characters are also pretty bad in this season.  Anya is annoying as always, Tara is as bland as always (although we do get a little background on what kind of family she came from), and Riley is even kind of whiney in this season.  He did a few things in this season that didn't really make sense.  I still don't hate him as much as most fans, though.  I was a little sad to see him go.  (They remove him when fans hated him, why didn't they do the same to Dawn?)The plot of this seas was terrible.  Basically, this Goddess named Glory, also called the Beast, wants to get out of our dimension and back into her heaven dimension.  She needs ""the key"" to open the doorway to her dimension.  But as she opens the door, more doors to other dimensions will be opened.  All kinds of creatures from all kinds of dimensions will be let into our dimension.  The world as we know it will be destroyed.  This is a decent conflict, but there's just one problem.  It's not enough to take up a whole season.  It would have been a good plot for an episode, or maybe even a two-part episode.  They milked a whole season out of this plot.  And they did the same with Glory.  She has got to be one of the worst villians ever.  She comes in on the season's fifth episode, ""No Place Like Home,"" and she's there for therest of the season.  Again, she is not an interesting enough villian to carry a season.  I mean, imagine if Drusilla had been the main villian of season 2, and the whole season had consisted of her trying to open Acathla.  That would have gotten real old real fast.  Which is exactly what happened here.  This is the first season of Buffy that didn't really have an episodic feel to it.  As we got further into the season, the episodes kept ending on cliffhangers.  It was like watching a season of ""24"".  Now don't get me wrong, 24 is a great show, in fact it's my favorite show.  But that kind of thing just didn't feel right for this series.  I can't really explain it.  In the earlier seasons of Buffy, they were able to, every once in a while, break off from the over-arching plot and put in an episode that dealt with something else.  And that was nice.  I really missed that about these later seasons of Buffy.  Especially when the plot was as lame as this.Now I loved the final episode.  It was amazing.  It was my second-favorite season finale in this series.  For a while, Joss Whedon was considering ending the series right here.  If he had, it would have been one of the best series finales of all time.  Because the actual series finale was a pile of crap.  Buffy and her friends prepare for the apocalypse which seems to come about every May.  I love how they joke about that.  Anyway, a huge battle ensues.  Buffy finally defeats Glory, and then runs off to save Dawn.  Giles then kills Glory by smothering Ben.  Oh yeah, Glory has a brothernamed Ben, who his sometimes him and sometimes her.  For some reason.  Despite this retarded plot device, it was cool to see another glimpse of Giles' dark side.  Unfortunately, this is the last time we ever see it.  Buffy realizes that ""death is her gift"", and she sacrifices herself to save Dawn and the rest of the world.  The season ends with a shot of a gravestone which reads: Buffy Summers.  Beloved Sister.  Devoted Friend.  She Saved the World.  A Lot.To recap, this was the worst episode of Buffy so far.  The plot, the characters, and just about everything else was terrible.  But this is actually not my least favorite season of Buffy.  The saving grace is the season finale, one of the best episodes of television, in my opinion.

767102,A13DZQ0NPX855S,B0000AQS18,jancola,"[5, 7]","After watching the whole series again on FX, I have decided that season five is far and away my favorite season of television, of any show, ever.  It contains some of the show's best episodes (Fool For Love, The Body, The Gift) and it also pulls together as a thematic whole, in ways only cult TV can, further exploring the moral ambiguities that made Buffy so innovative.The disks are also great.  Unlike the Angel disks, they actually put some thought into who should be on the cover, and Joss' commentary on the Body is worth a listen.There is a major mistake in this release, though.  One of the most poignant moments of this season on TV was the beginning of The Gift.  Giles' voice says, ""Previously, on Buffy the Vampire Slayer..."" as usual, and then the viewer is treated to a splashy montage of the main plot points of entire series.  It was a beautiful way of telling the viewer, This Episode Changes Everything, and the choice of shots summarized so well the feel of the entire show.Now that I've made you want to see this montage ... too bad, you can't!  Its not at the beginning of the episode.  Fox cut the previews from all the episodes, which is usually fine, but for this one, they really should have made an exception.

What came before was largely 'Buffy gets out of high school, into college, and more-or-less over Angel'.  Now she's all grown up, with a 'normal' boyfriend, and her friends are getting lives and dimensions  of their own instead of being mere hangers-on.  This season also introduces by far the scariest and most powerful of her adversaries, plus a pesky little sister conjured literally out of thin air, and her greatest emotional challenge in the form of her mother's illness and sudden death.  It's really a pity that the series didn't end with its shattering seasonal finale, as it would have made an appropriate sign-off to the character, instead of dragging her into an execrable sixth season (made intolerable by a trio of villain wanna-be's, more than anyone needed to know about Buffy's increasing obsession with her libido and herself, and virtual shelving of my two favorite characters, Tara and Giles).

767105,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B0000AQS18,Jason A. Miller,"[9, 10]","I think that Season Five of ""Buffy"" betrayed the first signs that the series was getting old.  Not in a bad way -- there was never a bona fide jump the shark moment -- but the sum of its parts was slightly less than the whole.  Many great episodes, both comic and tragic, but the glue holding it all together was a little weak.The early changes in ""Buffy""'s format were terrific.  The young Michelle Trachtenberg, Buffy's sister Dawn, did a great job creating the kind of character that's usually the bane of an aging show: the newly-introduced family member.  At age 15, Trachtenberg introduced a very natural acting style far more palatable than even Sarah Michelle Gellar's work at a similar age.  The explanation behind Dawn's sudden appearance -- that reality was molded around Buffy's life to account for the insert of a teenage sister -- is carried off with great humor.  ""Real Me"", an episode that could have alienated the entire audience, turned out to be one of the show's enduring classics, and did a great job of reinventing the show yet again.Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) departed the series late in the season, after surviving a battle with brain cancer.  Not much more can be said about how superb ""The Body"" is.  One of Joss Whedon's finest scripts (and directing jobs) handled the sudden death of a major character with a combination of grace and raw shock.  Not only was there no incidental music, but the camera was off-centered and Buffy's POV shots were kept out of focus.  The episode ended with a morgue fight sequence, as Buffy battled the ugliest vampire we've seen yet: a scarred, bruised, pale creature, not wearing any clothes.Spike's first full season as a regular established him as the dark comic/light tragic sidekick that buoyed him right on over to ""Angel"" once ""Buffy"" finally went off the air.  ""Fool For Love"" took us from a surprise twist on the origin of the name ""William the Bloody""), through Spike's elationship with Drusilla, and his killing of two slayers (the latter death would become even more significant in Season 7).  Around this time we learned that Spike developed a crush on Buffy, a scenario played at first for laughs, until it reached a climax in the dark, dark Valentine's Day comedy (""Crush"").The weak spot of the season, if there was one, came from the year's Big Bad, Glory (Clare Kramer), an evil god from another dimension, locked into our own world.  Glory engaged in season-length pursuit of ""The Key"", a mystical force bound into human form and hidden in this dimension by Eastern European monks.  Clare Kramer's acting style is energetic, manic and gleeful, but Glory failed to ever have a meaningful connection with Buffy, unlike previous season villains (Spike, Angel, Faith, the Mayor, the Initiative).  Glory and Buffy just fight several times, until Buffy bonks Glory over the head with a troll hammer.Joel Gray was introduced as a recurring character late in the season -- in the midst of a string of chase/capture/pursuit episodes that lacked much individual flavor or movement -- but was never really given much to do.  He left the show just in time to miss Season 6's musical episode.  There's also no real ""twist"" in the season, no betrayal by Angel or Faith, no sudden revelation of a new, more dangerous villain than we'd previously suspected.""The Gift"" remains one of ""Buffy""'s better season finales.  When Glory is finally dispatched, the deed is done using elements from several previous episodes (including the hilarious ""Triangle"", an episode featuring the return of Anya's ex-husband, an ale-guzzling troll), and the mystical connection between Dawn and Buffy is finally exploited.And then it all ended in a slow-motion dive from the top of the tower, and the season's final shot, a tombstone, informed us that ""She saved the world.  A lot."", and, for the second time, a ""Buffy"" season ended with Buffy's life in total disarray, but this time, we'd have to wait through four months -- and a change in networks -- to find out if we were ever getting her back.",4,Jump the Guppy,1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,4049,"['think', 'Season', 'Five', 'Buffy', 'betrayed', 'first', 'signs', 'series', 'was', 'getting', 'old', 'Not', 'bad', 'way', 'was', 'never', 'bona', 'fide', 'jump', 'shark', 'moment', 'sum', 'parts', 'was', 'slightly', 'less', 'whole', 'Many', 'great', 'episodes', 'comic', 'tragic', 'glue', 'holding', 'together', 'was', 'little', 'weak.The', 'early', 'changes', 'Buffy', 'format', 'were', 'terrific', 'young', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Buffy', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'kind', 'character', 'usually', 'bane', 'aging', 'show', 'newly-introduced', 'family', 'member', 'age', '15', 'Trachtenberg', 'introduced', 'very', 'natural', 'acting', 'style', 'far', 'more', 'palatable', 'even', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'work', 'similar', 'age', 'explanation', 'Dawn', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'reality', 'was', 'molded', 'Buffy', 'life', 'account', 'insert', 'teenage', 'sister', 'carried', 'great', 'humor', 'Real', 'Me', 'episode', 'could', 'have', 'alienated', 'entire', 'audience', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'show', 'enduring', 'classics', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'reinventing', 'show', 'yet', 'again.Joyce', 'Summers', 'Kristine', 'Sutherland', 'departed', 'series', 'late', 'season', 'surviving', 'battle', 'brain', 'cancer', 'Not', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'how', 'superb', 'Body', 'One', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'finest', 'scripts', 'directing', 'jobs', 'handled', 'sudden', 'death', 'major', 'character', 'combination', 'grace', 'raw', 'shock', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'incidental', 'music', 'camera', 'was', 'off-centered', 'Buffy', 'POV', 'shots', 'were', 'kept', 'focus', 'episode', 'ended', 'morgue', 'fight', 'sequence', 'Buffy', 'battled', 'ugliest', 'vampire', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'scarred', 'bruised', 'pale', 'creature', 'not', 'wearing', 'clothes.Spike', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'regular', 'established', 'dark', 'comic/light', 'tragic', 'sidekick', 'buoyed', 'right', 'Angel', 'once', 'Buffy', 'finally', 'went', 'air', 'Fool', 'Love', 'took', 'surprise', 'twist', 'origin', 'name', 'William', 'Bloody', 'Spike', 'elationship', 'Drusilla', 'killing', 'two', 'slayers', 'latter', 'death', 'would', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'significant', 'Season', '7', 'time', 'learned', 'Spike', 'developed', 'crush', 'Buffy', 'scenario', 'played', 'first', 'laughs', 'reached', 'climax', 'dark', 'dark', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'comedy', 'Crush', '.The', 'weak', 'spot', 'season', 'was', 'one', 'came', 'year', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Glory', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'evil', 'god', 'dimension', 'locked', 'own', 'world', 'Glory', 'engaged', 'season-length', 'pursuit', 'Key', 'mystical', 'force', 'bound', 'human', 'form', 'hidden', 'dimension', 'Eastern', 'European', 'monks', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'acting', 'style', 'energetic', 'manic', 'gleeful', 'Glory', 'failed', 'ever', 'have', 'meaningful', 'connection', 'Buffy', 'previous', 'season', 'villains', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'Faith', 'Mayor', 'Initiative', 'Glory', 'Buffy', 'just', 'fight', 'several', 'times', 'Buffy', 'bonks', 'Glory', 'head', 'troll', 'hammer.Joel', 'Gray', 'was', 'introduced', 'recurring', 'character', 'late', 'season', 'midst', 'string', 'chase/capture/pursuit', 'episodes', 'lacked', 'much', 'individual', 'flavor', 'movement', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'left', 'show', 'just', 'time', 'miss', 'Season', '6', 'musical', 'episode', 'also', 'real', 'twist', 'season', 'betrayal', 'Angel', 'Faith', 'sudden', 'revelation', 'new', 'more', 'dangerous', 'villain', ""'d"", 'previously', 'suspected', 'Gift', 'one', 'Buffy', 'better', 'season', 'finales', 'When', 'Glory', 'finally', 'dispatched', 'deed', 'done', 'using', 'elements', 'several', 'previous', 'episodes', 'including', 'hilarious', 'Triangle', 'episode', 'featuring', 'return', 'Anya', 'ex-husband', 'ale-guzzling', 'troll', 'mystical', 'connection', 'Dawn', 'Buffy', 'finally', 'exploited.And', 'then', 'ended', 'slow-motion', 'dive', 'top', 'tower', 'season', 'final', 'shot', 'tombstone', 'informed', 'saved', 'world', 'lot', 'second', 'time', 'Buffy', 'season', 'ended', 'Buffy', 'life', 'total', 'disarray', 'time', ""'d"", 'have', 'wait', 'four', 'months', 'change', 'networks', 'find', 'out', 'were', 'ever', 'getting', 'back']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

Season Five is one of the darkest in the history of ""Buffy"" in terms of subject matter; it is also one of the most pivital. the season gets off to a rollicking start in ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" where Buffy meets, you guessed it, Dracula. It is also in this episode where we meet Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) in a very Partick Ewing-in the shower way. Wait, Buffy's WHAT???!!! The next few episodes carry on as if Buffy always had a sister. It isn't until later that we learn Dawn is a mystical key that when activated will create hell on earth. The ""Big Bad"" of Season Five is Glory, a former god who has been banished to earth who is in a desperate search to find the key. This season also introduces Spike's infatuation with Buffy as well as the notorious ""Buffybot."" It all comes to a stunning climax in ""The Gift,"" one of the finest finales in the history of the show. You'll be permanentley glued to the edge of your seat during this episode. Every second is brilliant. However, the highlight of the season is definately ""The Body,"" which is the finest hour of television I have ever seen. Nothing can compare to the sheer power of this episode. The entire episode focuses on Joyce's, Buffy's mother's, death. Joyce was not killed by any supernatural entity, which makes it all the more real. It is sudden, and unexplainable. Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the perfomance of her career in this episode. From shock, to horror, to sadness, Gellar should have won an Emmy for this episode. Her performance is perfect. The other actors are fantastic in this episode as well. From Willow's (Alyson Hannigan's) fear of not looking appropriate, to Xander's (Nicholas Brendon's) quiet desperation, to Dawn's sadness, to Tara's (Amber Benson's) previous experience, everything is spot on perfect. Special mention must go to Emma Caulfield for her wonderful outburst about the fact that no one will explain to her what death is. This is the best ""Buffy"" episode in the history of the show.

I also enjoy the longer story lines as well. I was so glad to see Riely go. I liked the character, but him and Buffy together was not good. I could have done without the intro of Dawn (even more so in the last two seasons). In the later seasons she becomes to whinny and too much of a distraction. The episode ""The Body"" is one of the most powerful episodes I've ever seen on tv. It truely captures the feeling of death when you first have to deal with it. I also liked the fact that they included a vampire in the end of the episode to show that life still continues even in the most horrible situations. Watching the episode i just sat there almost stunned...to me the best episode of Buffy ever.

767108,A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY,B0000AQS18,Jeff Pearlman,"[4, 5]","This was the season where Buffy gained a sister, lost her mother, dumped Riley, began to feel a once-unthinkable attraction to Spike, and explored the dark side of being a Slayer.  Five seasons in, and the writers still found new ways to question and work with the show's premise.  Exceptional.  Willow's powers, and her relationship with Tara, intensified.  Anya embraced capitalism, Giles toyed with leaving, and Dracula even stopped by for a spell.  Except for one early episode featuring his real-life twin brother, Nicholas Brendon's Xander was in sort of a holding pattern this year.  Clare Kramer was great gorgeous fun as the villain of the year--Glorificus--accessorized with tight dresses, high heels, &quot;a bad home perm&quot; (said Spike; though I did not find her ass at all lop-sided), and an entourage of fawning, scabby &quot;Hobbits with leprosy.&quot;As the season aired originally, I feared that BTVS had finally jumped the shark with Dawn.  (When she screams, I still feel that way:  get out get out GET OUT!)  But Michelle Trachtenberg, I now realize, was swell.  Her instant bonding with the Scoobies really helped solidify the friends &amp; family dynamic that is my favorite part of this show.  I've always liked the theme that her friendships have kept Buffy inspired to continue fighting beyond the point when past, lonelier Slayers had given up.  Also, regarding the underappreciated Marc Blucas:  the time did seem right to let Riley go, but his growing disillusionment with the military and his place in Buffy's heart was a very good subplot and Blucas played it very well.  He's also, why do I even bother being jealous, one of the best-looking guys I've ever seen on TV.  I wish him luck with whatever comes next for him.  No, I'm not his agent...Anyone reading this review (thanks, by the way) will have to rely on someone else's opinion about &quot;The Body&quot; and the episode following it.  These are the episodes dealing with Joyce's death, from natural causes, about two-thirds of the way through the season.  Since they first aired, I lost my mother, and I doubt I will ever feel up to watching those two episodes on DVD.  I recall that they were well-done but having suffered this unbearable loss in real life prevents my appreciation of the writers' creative take on this subject.  Ditto for the bonus feature on the last disc, &quot;Natural Causes,&quot; which discusses the storyline.  I got through 20 seconds of it.  Even seeing Joyce's picture on a table in a scene starts me crying.Hitting less close to home is the rest of the increased mortality rate in Joss' vision over the last few seasons.  Knowing what's to come in Seasons 6 &amp; 7 makes some of the scenes with Tara and Anya sadder than they were when first aired.In fact, the losses have REALLY racked up in light of what happened this year on &quot;Angel.&quot;  Losing Cordelia, Fred, AND Wesley this year, so soon after Tara, Anya, and (what can I say, he &quot;grew&quot; on me--pun in there somewhere) Jonathan is a bit too much.  If 14 years of Dawn can be inserted into everyone's memories so easily, surely a few more Jars of Osiris can be found on ebay to revive some of these people for the movies we're all hoping for.  Even for this kind of show, us fans have had to absorb way too many deaths.&quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; have been the best shows on TV for the past few years.  They provided entertainment (and some misery) at a time when I needed it (the entertainment), and still need it, desperately.  Anyone remotely interested in this show will not be disappointed.  Oh yeah, the packaging, the picture quality, the sound (I have DVD stereo now; the Winnebago vs. the Knights of Hack-n-Slash was boomin') are all first-rate.

767109,A2GJQ1MLNP3B23,B0000AQS18,Jeffrey Matthew Cohen,"[13, 15]","Season 5 of Buffy is one of those amazing examples when all the story-telling elements come together to create a unified and explosive plotline arc. This season has everything: a deposed God, mideval knights, the watchers council, monks, lots of dark witchcraft, Dracula, two Xanders, the newly arrived little sister that turns out to be timeless destructive energy, Spike fighting for the good guys, the First Slayer, crazy robots, brain-sucking, aliens from outerspace, a really cute doctor, and the deaths of two main characters!!Glory is by far (in my opinion) the best big bad ever! She's fantastically powerful, but at the same time really ditzy. She fits perfectly into the Buffy-verse: scary & funny, but believable all at the same time. This season also cements in Tara and Spike as scoobies. And it introduces Warren for the first time (who will figure largely into the plot of Season 6).The highlights of the Season: Fool for Love (Spike's past), The Body (realistic look at death), Tough Love (first glimpse at Dark Willow), and The Gift (my favorite season finale & the death of another main character).And as with all good things, there are some low points. Listening to Fear (alien is summoned to kill crazy people), and Family (Tara's creepy family arrive) aren't the best, but they're still better than most of what's on TV. Bad Buffy is a lot like bad pizza: even when it's bad, it's still pretty good! OK--corny, I know, but it makes a point! Also, I'm a huge Riley (Marc Blucas) fan, and was sad to see him go this season (he goes on to make a guest appearance in Season 6).In conclusion, buy Buffy Season 5 on DVD!!!

767110,A2IXV2QW0A8U3F,B0000AQS18,Jennifer French,"[1, 3]","Season Five is, in my opinion, one of the best seasons of Buffy.  From meeting Dracula (to which Buffy's reaction was great) to Dawn's appearance, Spike's infatuation with Buffy (hello, was going to stake Drusella for her), and the battle with Glory, Season Five had some of the best episodes and overall arch ever.  Glory is the perfect villion.  Self-serving, unapologetic, and determined to find &quot;her key.&quot;The character of Dawn was a little trying on the nerves this season.  She tended towards utter selfishness and bratty behavior, that made for some wincing while I was watching the series.  After a while, you just want to smack the kid and tell her to shut up.My favorite part of this season was Spike.  When he discovers his love for Buffy, it changed him in a good, making the show even better way.  His reaction to Buffy's &quot;gift&quot; was a prime example of how deep his feelings for Buffy were.&quot;The Body&quot; is the best episode of the season.  Buffy's reaction to Joyce's natural death was astounding.  I cannot believe Sarah Michelle did not get an emmy for her protrayal.  Are you telling me that daytime drama was the only place that saw the talent this woman has.  Amazing acting, writing, and direction.  (Note:  There is absolutely no background noise throughout the whole episode.)Overall, Season Five of Buffy rates up there with Season Two.

That episode ends strangely because all of a sudden Buffy has a sister. It turns out she's really something called ""the key"" and she was put in human form by monks for Buffy to protect from an evil god called Glory. Glory wants to use the key to open up a dimension that would bring about the end of the world. Buffy and her friends  all have memories of her sister Dawn as if she was always there. Dawn even thinks she's a real girl and Buffy has to hide it from her that she's not.If having to protect Dawn from Glory isn't enough for Buffy, her mom suddenly dies. She has to deal with having to take care of the house and raise Dawn as well. The whole funeral episode for Buffy's mom is moody and depressing and actually makes you feel like you lose someone as well. It's well done and feels real even if it's not something you would expect from Buffy. For a season that starts off funny it winds up being pretty sad.Buffy loses a lot this season, her b/f leaves, her mom dies and even she dies. Oh on top of it she finds out Spike has a crush on her so she doesn't exactly like that either. Despite being an overly dramatic season it's also pretty damn strong. A lot happens all in one season and it has it's best villian with Glory. This was the last strong season, I liked the last one but it felt rushed to me and wasn't worthy of being the last season.

I've read reviews from other fans who did not like the opener, Buffy vs. Dracula, but I enjoyed the episode (never having seen Gellar and the actor playing Dracula in AMC probably helped).  The last half of this season is done powerfully.  I am grateful to Joss Wheadon for exploring this very difficult topic of the death of a family member.  He did this with such grace and so close to the bone that it takes your breath away (if you've been through times like these, anyway).

All heartwrenching episodes that proves that ensemble is one of the best. All the acting is superb, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar.

767116,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0000AQS18,Joe Sherry,"[1, 2]","The fifth season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" introduced the character of Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg).  Dawn is the sister of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar).  Now, if you have been watching for the first four seasons, you know that Buffy doesn't have a sister.  She is an only child.  But, if you have been watching the show for several seasons now, you may also have noticed some odd things.  It began near the end of Season Three, where we see Buffy and Faith (Eliza Dushku) talking.  There is a flash of something on the bed, so quick that we can only get a hint that it is a person, but it is never explained.  In Season Four, there is more clues that something or someone is coming and Buffy has dreams of preparing a bed for someone and in that dream Tara (Amber Benson) mentions the word ""Dawn"", though we don't know at the time that what she is referring to is Buffy's sister.Things are explained in due course, but the set up for this is that at the start of the season everyone is acting as if they have known Dawn for years and she has a family history.  There is a reason for this, of course, but telling what the reason is would be spoiling the fun of discovering this fresh.Season Five brings the characters back home again after the fourth season focusing on college (and the first three working around high school).  There are several key elements introduced.  The first is obviously Dawn, and Buffy's relationship with her.  This also changes the family dynamic with Joyce (Kristine Sutherland), of course.  Another key element is the Big Bad for the Season, Glory (Clare Kramer).  Telling too much about Glory would ruin nearly all of the surprises for the season.  As in all of the seasons, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is ultimately rooted in the lives of the characters and while they are out killing vampires and fighting demons, the characters are also dealing the mundane details and facts of ordinary life, in all facets of life.  This has been one of the strengths of the show (and this season, in heartbreaking detail).I hesitate to say that any one season is ""superior"" to another since this is my favorite program.  This season is slightly different than Season Four in that this time there is more of a direct storyline progression that Season Five is following.  The Fourth Season was more a collection of episodes that tracked the emotional growth of the characters, but not really against a Big Bad.  Season Five ended in such an incredible way that, some have suggested, it would have been the perfect place to have ended the series.  While I agree that it would be a perfect conclusion, I am glad that I have two more seasons to watch.  There are so many strong episodes in Season Five that it is tough to highlight just a couple, but some episodes of note are ""The Body"", ""The Gift"", and ""Family.""  Despite the fact that this is a show about a ""Vampire Slayer"", this show is about so much more and is much deeper (and better) than the title might suggest.-Joe Sherry",5,"a very strong, emotional season",1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,3001,"['fifth', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'introduced', 'character', 'Dawn', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Dawn', 'sister', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Now', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'know', 'Buffy', ""n't"", 'have', 'sister', 'only', 'child', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'several', 'seasons', 'now', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'noticed', 'odd', 'things', 'began', 'end', 'Season', 'Three', 'where', 'see', 'Buffy', 'Faith', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'talking', 'flash', 'something', 'bed', 'so', 'quick', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'hint', 'person', 'never', 'explained', 'Season', 'Four', 'more', 'clues', 'something', 'someone', 'coming', 'Buffy', 'dreams', 'preparing', 'bed', 'someone', 'dream', 'Tara', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'word', 'Dawn', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'what', 'referring', 'Buffy', 'sister.Things', 'are', 'explained', 'due', 'course', 'set', 'up', 'start', 'season', 'everyone', 'acting', 'have', 'known', 'Dawn', 'years', 'family', 'history', 'reason', 'course', 'telling', 'what', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'spoiling', 'fun', 'discovering', 'fresh.Season', 'Five', 'characters', 'back', 'home', 'again', 'fourth', 'season', 'focusing', 'college', 'first', 'three', 'working', 'around', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'several', 'key', 'elements', 'introduced', 'first', 'obviously', 'Dawn', 'Buffy', 'relationship', 'also', 'family', 'Joyce', 'Kristine', 'Sutherland', 'course', 'key', 'element', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Season', 'Glory', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'Telling', 'too', 'much', 'Glory', 'would', 'ruin', 'nearly', 'surprises', 'season', 'seasons', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'ultimately', 'rooted', 'lives', 'characters', 'are', 'out', 'killing', 'vampires', 'fighting', 'demons', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'dealing', 'mundane', 'details', 'facts', 'ordinary', 'life', 'facets', 'life', 'been', 'one', 'strengths', 'show', 'season', 'heartbreaking', 'detail', '.I', 'hesitate', 'say', 'one', 'season', 'superior', 'favorite', 'program', 'season', 'slightly', 'different', 'Season', 'Four', 'time', 'more', 'direct', 'storyline', 'progression', 'Season', 'Five', 'following', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'was', 'more', 'collection', 'episodes', 'tracked', 'emotional', 'growth', 'characters', 'not', 'really', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Season', 'Five', 'ended', 'such', 'incredible', 'way', 'have', 'suggested', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'place', 'have', 'ended', 'series', 'agree', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'conclusion', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'watch', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'strong', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Five', 'tough', 'highlight', 'just', 'couple', 'episodes', 'note', 'are', 'Body', 'Gift', 'Family', 'fact', 'show', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'much', 'deeper', 'better', 'title', 'might', 'suggest.-Joe', 'Sherry']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season
767117,A13KXWTN0DT878,B0000AQS18,"Josh ""Josh""","[4, 5]","Every year of Buffy is intense, moving, funny, and relative, but the fifth season magnifies each of these qualities. With the fun stuff that is Buffy vs. Dracula, the season then introduces Michelle Trachtenberg as Dawn, and thus begins the goodness that is the fifth season. Aside from season two and the Buffy / Angel / Angelus story arc, the Dawn / Buffy / Glory story arc is the next to have as much emotion and structure. Some saw Dawn as annoying, as did I, but in the end, the storyline changed that idea for me.I know it's said everywhere, but this season also produced one of Joss' best episodes, The Body. It is an episode that shows almost true brilliance from Joss, as the director, and superb performances from the cast. And I've never spared so many tears for a tv show as I did during the season finale, The Gift. Not even did the series finale hit such an emotional spot.As for the DVD set itself, it's a step up from the fourth season, as each season steps up.  Plenty of commentaries from Joss and writers/directors/producers. These commentaries are the most interesting to sit and listen to if you're a devote fan, but great listens with a little filler if you aren't. The featurettes are there as always, even more this time around (the &quot;Natural Causes&quot; covering The Body is one of the more interesting, and seeing Clare Kramer speak on Glory in the &quot;Story of Season 5&quot; is great). Also included are Outtakes, finally, but just some from the first 3 seasons. They're still great.Buffy's fifth season is my favorite out of all of the seasons, whether it be because of the story arc, superb cast (Sarah MG's and Alyson Hannigan's best moments are here), great directing, or just because the relation to the characters ... it's unknown. As for all other Buffy fans, it varies. As for those who aren't fans, then I recommend going back and purchasing season one and then subsequently purchasing the other seasons. It's worth it.

767119,A2KXQ1CIU9B8Z2,B0000AQS18,JR,"[1, 1]","This season could have easily gone south. Any time you introduce a new character like Dawn you must be very careful that the entire Buffy matrix doesn't end up on the wrong side of the universe. For Buffy fans we must accept what Buffy accepts because she thinks it has always been that way, she has a sister named Dawn. Suprisingly however, the season actually begins with all things, Buffy meeting Dracula! Overall this is a powerful season, and one that Joss Whedon has called probably close to his best. Why? How? easy. He was under the belief that Buffy would not be renewed for season 6, and he wanted to put it all out there and give Buffy a royal send off--and that he did. With the intro of a terrific baddy like Glory which mercifully makes us forget about a rather luke warm villain like Adam from season 4. This is also the season, which really started as far back as one, and picked up steam in season 4, of Willow becoming more powerful and dangerous, albiet more subtley before it explodes in season 6. It is also the season where Buffy is starting to creep closer to playing with forces that down the line will unleash the first. Study the episodes about the first slayer that she encounters very carefully for clues, also anything involving Willow playing with the mojo. Episodes you cannot and will not want to miss ""The Body"" I dare you to find a more chilling portrait on television of a daugther losing a parent. It will leave you breathless and make you think deeply about our mortality. And of course, the ""The Gift"" A perfect ending for a terrific season. A more beautiful way to end the possible end of a series, I think not. Other things to watch, Spike's growing obession with Buffy, and Tara. Her character development this season is crucial to the axis of season 6, the season that almost never was. It is, and was a special season.

When before in seasons 1-4 she was an upbeat, a happy and friendly character, here she's completely changed around into a manipulative, condecending, , full of herself and ungrateful little twit. In almost every episode she comes crushing into Spike's crypt breaking the door down and punching him in the face, it got very old and annoying. She puts Spike down all the time but when she is in trouble he is the one she is running to for help. And after he helps her one would expect gratitude but she goes around looking down at him and insulting him along with everyone in her crew. What used to be a hero became an antihero. Buffy's character in this season is extremely unlikable, her voice, her clothes, her everything. Every time she goes on patrol to kill vampires or stop the end of the world she is dressed like she is going on a date. And why oh WHY in God's name did the producers/writers make Spike fall in love with her? Why does everyone on this show have to fall in love with her? She doesn't have the character and the personality of a hero, she is annoying as hell and expects everyone to run around and do what she wants.

Probably where many people really think the show started to lose its touch.  While I thought Glory was a great departure for the traditional villain, I guess Buffy had just broken the mold too many times for even a character like Glory to really strike people.  Some solid episodes in it though.  The one about the Buffy Bot, and when Spike confronts Buffy about his past are in season five.  They are all must see episodes for any fan.All and all, I give the season a B+.  I never thought Dawn found her way into the group, and I never felt any true emotion between Buffy and her.  But, who knows, this was also the season where Buffy seemed to lose her girly tendencies and become just a stone cold warrior like the rest of the slayers before her (its kinda sad, considering that she consciously tried to never become them).A safe buy for any fan.

As a villian, Glory was okay, but she, too, was bratty.Buffy vs. Dracula was one of the more stupid episodes of the series.  It was too contrived and Dracula wasn't convincing.  And yet, ""The Body"" is probably one of the very best episodes of the series and, perhaps one of the top 20 episodes on ANY television series.

767130,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000AQS18,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 8]","I always think of the second season as being the best year of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" mainly because the grand two-part finale of ""Becoming"" was the operatic high point of the series.  How could Joss Whedon ever top the moment when Buffy kissed Angel, told him that she loved him, and then killed him?  The short answer is that it could not be done, but no one can accuse Joss of not trying.  Besides, one thing we have consistently seen each season since the second is that if the top is not as high, the bottom and average scores are on the rise.Having dealt with the Master, Angelus and Acaltha, Faith Mayor Wilkins, and Adams and the Intiative, the ante gets upped beyond vampires and demons to the level of a god for the season's final battle.  After the abbreviated first season Whedon always comes up with a first half story arc that combines with the second half story arc for the big finish, but this year Glory shows up in episode five.  However, Joss remains true to the formula because the Fifth Season comes down to Dawn and Glory, and even with the appearance of a deranged deity from another dimension, it is the sudden appearance of Buffy's kid sister that defines the season.Dawn pops up at the end of the season premier episode, ""Dracula,"" the first really comic opening for a Buffy season, and we do not find out about the ""Key"" until the fifth episode, ""No Place Like Home.""  But then we do not find out that Glory is a god until Quentin Travers drops that little bombshell at the end of ""Checkpoint.""  If anything, I would have liked Joss to have played out the mystery a bit longer, but it was fun to have Buffy and everyone just accept Dawn and the idea that she had always been there.  Plus, throwing a bratty kid sister into the Buffy mix is a nice way of shaking things up.  Then again, Joss had a way of topping that with regards to Joyce Summers.There are a few choice examples of significant character evolutions in the history of television programming, and with ""BtVS"" we can add Spike's name to the honor role that includes Margaret Houlihan and Charles Emerson Winchester from ""M*A*S*H,"" and Lou Grant going from a supporting character on a classic sitcom to the lead of a dramatic program.  The chip the Initiative put in Spike's head in Season Four was only the start of the fun, because now Spike has been having dreams about the Slayer.  William the Bloody with a crush in his head.  The end result is that in ""The Gift"" so many of the memorable moments involve Spike: Willow tells him to go and he goes, the look on his face when he realizes he has failed Dawn, and the fact that he is the one who totally breaks down sobbing at the end.  Throw into the mix Spike's refusal to tell Glory about the Key and his reward from Buffy.The Fifth Season is not without its flaws.  Glory is given a convenient Achilles heel regarding Ben and manages to avoid a sustained all-out assault until the final trio of episodes.  In terms of character transformations we also have Xander renouncing his role as the show's ""butt monkey"" and Anya becoming the show's comic relief.  I appreciate the desire to do the former but the latter gets played out way too often over the rest of the series.  Compare the Anya that was turned human in Season Three with what we have at this point; did she really learn nothing during 4,000 years as a vengeance demon?  After all, she was human once, and in a bad marriage: did she forget all that?  I reached my Anya saturation point during this season, where I started wincing a lot at her comments (but Whedon does use this for a great moment in ""The Body"").Of course, if we are talking changes in characters then we have to applaud the Willow that takes over at the low point of the season when Buffy retreats into her self in ""The Weight of the World.""  In retrospect it is rather astounding to look at how many changes the gang goes through in the Fifth Season.  From where they started, seldom have characters come this far; and there are still two seasons to go.In terms of DVD extras all you need to know is that Joss Whedon does audio commentary for ""The Body.""  You already know he should have had an Emmy nomination for writing that one, but he should have been nominated for director too: pay attention to the way he uses the camera to capture Buffy's disorientation and provide one of the best portrayals of grief in television history.",5,A whole new world Dawns for Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,4409,"['always', 'think', 'second', 'season', 'being', 'best', 'year', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'mainly', 'grand', 'two-part', 'finale', 'Becoming', 'was', 'operatic', 'high', 'point', 'series', 'How', 'could', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'ever', 'top', 'moment', 'when', 'Buffy', 'kissed', 'Angel', 'told', 'loved', 'then', 'killed', 'short', 'answer', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'one', 'can', 'accuse', 'Joss', 'not', 'trying', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'consistently', 'seen', 'season', 'second', 'top', 'not', 'as', 'high', 'bottom', 'average', 'scores', 'are', 'rise.Having', 'dealt', 'Master', 'Angelus', 'Acaltha', 'Faith', 'Mayor', 'Wilkins', 'Adams', 'Intiative', 'ante', 'upped', 'vampires', 'demons', 'level', 'god', 'season', 'final', 'battle', 'abbreviated', 'first', 'season', 'Whedon', 'always', 'up', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'arc', 'second', 'half', 'story', 'arc', 'big', 'finish', 'year', 'Glory', 'up', 'episode', 'five', 'However', 'Joss', 'true', 'formula', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'down', 'Dawn', 'Glory', 'even', 'appearance', 'deranged', 'deity', 'dimension', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'Buffy', 'kid', 'sister', 'season.Dawn', 'up', 'end', 'season', 'premier', 'episode', 'Dracula', 'first', 'really', 'comic', 'opening', 'Buffy', 'season', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'Key', 'fifth', 'episode', 'Place', 'Home', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'Glory', 'god', 'Quentin', 'Travers', 'little', 'bombshell', 'end', 'Checkpoint', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Joss', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'mystery', 'bit', 'longer', 'was', 'fun', 'have', 'Buffy', 'everyone', 'just', 'accept', 'Dawn', 'idea', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'there', 'throwing', 'bratty', 'kid', 'sister', 'Buffy', 'mix', 'nice', 'way', 'shaking', 'things', 'up', 'Then', 'again', 'Joss', 'had', 'way', 'topping', 'regards', 'Joyce', 'Summers.There', 'are', 'few', 'choice', 'examples', 'significant', 'character', 'evolutions', 'history', 'television', 'programming', 'BtVS', 'can', 'add', 'Spike', 'name', 'honor', 'role', 'Margaret', 'Houlihan', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', 'M*A*S*H', 'Lou', 'Grant', 'going', 'supporting', 'character', 'classic', 'sitcom', 'lead', 'dramatic', 'program', 'chip', 'Initiative', 'put', 'Spike', 'head', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'only', 'start', 'fun', 'now', 'Spike', 'been', 'having', 'dreams', 'Slayer', 'William', 'Bloody', 'crush', 'head', 'end', 'result', 'Gift', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'involve', 'Spike', 'Willow', 'go', 'look', 'face', 'when', 'failed', 'Dawn', 'fact', 'one', 'who', 'totally', 'breaks', 'down', 'sobbing', 'end', 'Throw', 'mix', 'Spike', 'refusal', 'tell', 'Glory', 'Key', 'reward', 'Buffy.The', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'not', 'flaws', 'Glory', 'given', 'convenient', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'regarding', 'Ben', 'avoid', 'sustained', 'all-out', 'assault', 'final', 'trio', 'episodes', 'terms', 'character', 'transformations', 'also', 'have', 'Xander', 'renouncing', 'role', 'show', 'butt', 'monkey', 'Anya', 'becoming', 'show', 'comic', 'relief', 'appreciate', 'desire', 'do', 'former', 'latter', 'played', 'out', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'rest', 'series', 'Compare', 'Anya', 'was', 'turned', 'human', 'Season', 'Three', 'what', 'have', 'point', 'did', 'really', 'learn', 'nothing', '4,000', 'years', 'vengeance', 'demon', 'was', 'human', 'once', 'bad', 'marriage', 'did', 'forget', 'reached', 'Anya', 'saturation', 'point', 'season', 'where', 'started', 'wincing', 'lot', 'comments', 'Whedon', 'use', 'great', 'moment', 'Body', '.Of', 'course', 'are', 'talking', 'changes', 'characters', 'then', 'have', 'applaud', 'Willow', 'over', 'low', 'point', 'season', 'when', 'Buffy', 'self', 'Weight', 'World', 'retrospect', 'rather', 'astounding', 'look', 'how', 'many', 'changes', 'gang', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'where', 'started', 'seldom', 'have', 'characters', 'come', 'far', 'are', 'still', 'two', 'seasons', 'go.In', 'terms', 'DVD', 'extras', 'need', 'know', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Body', 'already', 'know', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'writing', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'director', 'too', 'pay', 'attention', 'way', 'camera', 'capture', 'Buffy', 'disorientation', 'provide', 'one', 'best', 'portrayals', 'grief', 'television', 'history']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

767136,AQKY5TW7OTY9W,B0000AQS18,"Marvin The Critic ""&#34;The Critic&#34;""","[0, 0]","Okay I will be the first to say that Dawn was not my favorite character and continues this streak until the end. But i must admit this did provide the character of Buffy a challenge and away to grow into a more aware person. While she had always watched out for the world in general. when it came to home life. She had her mother and really Joyce was a grown woman so she could take care of herself. She really didn't have a reason to be super caring at home. She was free to be well in a ""college mode"" forever until the sudden presence of Dawn. This put her in a whole new flock of dangerous situations and in a way made her more relateable.I don't know about you but i find it a lot easier to relate to someone who has a nagging sibling than to an only child. We got to see Buffy take on not only the world but family life full on as well.  She really had to step up to the table when her mother died forcing her to have to now be the new head of the house, as well as still saving the world on the regular.  She can't go unscathed throughout this process. She breaks down a bit when she finds her mother has a tumor. She also has a situation arise where the golden boy, Riley leaves for good.( He didn't seem to fit in so this was kind of expected.)  She also has to drop out from school.So between all of this. Life becomes more real and we see more of how life (not monsters)  can be a struggle in itself. Those,all in all, makes her more relatable. Before all of this she was just another cute blonde who battles monsters. So while i didn't initially like this change. I see how it actually helped to open up a whole new level to the story.Xander finally starts to grow into his own after having such a hard time the season previous. Willow starts to dig deeper into her own magic abilities and sometimes with scary results.I love the character of Glory. She is really the first villain to come along and not look like your typical Beast. She even has times where she seems like someone you would meet at random and start to like her. Then you quickly see how things that seem harmless can be quite the opposite in no time flat. (The first fight between her and Buffy is truly something worth watching. The last fight is also quite a spectacle to see as well.)This season also starts the obsession of Spike with Buffy which was a twist upon all twists. I like Spike so anyway to keep him in the story line I am all for it!So I must admit this wasn't a perfect season (there are times when  dawn becomes too  real and annoying),in my opinion, but it is one of the best ones. Especially with the finale which could have seriously been the end to the series. It was dramatic enough and seemed to taper off everyone's story just right.  This isn't to say the next two seasons didn't offer some good stories and direction. But i think I would have been happy with it all just ending here.

Spike is my favorite in this season with his pinting over Buffy as he finds out he loves her madly and she hates his guts. We also see Marc Blucas(Riley) leave the show in the 10th episode Into The Woods. some hot lesbian scenes involve Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson, if Seth Green(OZ) was still around he would of gotten two girlfriends, but no he had to leave. moving along we still have Giles and Xander, which Xander proposes to Anya in the end episode where Buffy dies a second time since the first season. a must have in any Buffy fan collection. you also get to see when Spike was bit and turned as well in the episode Fool For Love. saver it",5,"what can I say, I just love her",1066348800,"10 17, 2003",2003,976,"['not', 'greatest', 'season', 'series', 'episodes', 'are', 'classic', 'time', 'off', 'Buffy', 'Dracula', 'then', 'chick', 'named', 'Glory', 'arrives', 'town', 'find', 'out', 'Buffy', 'sister', 'named', 'Dawn', 'also', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'Anya', 'cast', 'credits', 'so', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Dawn', 'Spike', 'favorite', 'season', 'pinting', 'over', 'Buffy', 'out', 'madly', 'guts', 'also', 'see', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'Riley', 'leave', 'show', '10th', 'episode', 'Into', 'Woods', 'hot', 'lesbian', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'Seth', 'Green', 'OZ', 'was', 'still', 'would', 'gotten', 'two', 'girlfriends', 'had', 'leave', 'moving', 'still', 'have', 'Giles', 'Xander', 'Xander', 'proposes', 'Anya', 'end', 'episode', 'where', 'Buffy', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'season', 'must', 'have', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'collection', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'when', 'Spike', 'was', 'bit', 'turned', 'as', 'well', 'episode', 'Fool', 'Love', 'saver']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season
767140,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B0000AQS18,Mike,"[1, 1]","RELAX...the quote in my review title is straight from Season Five. No actual Bob Barker was harmed during the filming of this review.As Season Five opens, this show had safely made the full transition from Sunnydale High to the college years, and instead of getting entrenched in ""Buffy Hills 90210"" petty collegiate fluff, it headed straight into death, loss, and gut-wrenching emotions.As a season-long central villain, Glory mixes the every-hair-in-place diva obsession of Cordelia with the twisted and consistently disturbing psyche of Drusilla (who returns to find her ex-lover Spike ""tired of playing"" her kind of games). Glory's ""minions"" provide fawning comic relief in an otherwise heavy season (one of them is the source of the quote mentioned above). Think ""Smithers"" from ""The Simpsons"" in little ogre bodies.The new ""central hub"" for meetings is Giles' new business venture, the magic shop. After witnessing the death of the store's umpteenth owner, he sees profit in his future, buys the store, and hires Anya as his cashier (more comic relief). Naturally, it also becomes a favorite visiting place of demons with heavy blunt objects, who inflict thousands of dollars worth of damage on the store and its merchandise as the season progresses.There's some closure with the characters of Riley and Buffy's mom (hence much of the season's dire weight), as well as the show's writers filling in the blanks on the mystery / backstory of Buffy's little sister Dawn (and her link to Glory).It would have been extremely easy for the show's creators to play it safe in Season Five by establishing a formula and cranking out tiresome episode after episode. They chose to do the opposite...to take some big risks, to pull out some major surprises, to defy expectations.There's a significant emphasis on Spike in Season Five, culminating in a ""spoiler moment"" that comes at the end of Episode 18, ""Intervention."" As actor James Marsters has mentioned on a number of occasion, Whedon's original plan for the character was to kill him off after his initial appearance. Luckily for the series, they took a sharp left turn and decided to develop Spike into one of the show's most memorable characters.In the Season Four box set, there's some discussion of the episode ""Hush."" Apparently someone told creator Joss Whedon that THE reason for the show's success...the SINGLE REASON...was the dialogue between Buffy and the other characters, the verbal interplay. It was shortly after receiving that feedback that Whedon decided to craft an episode that was completely silent after the first few minutes.I've got to believe that a similar desire to defy expectations and ""think outside of the box"" went into the production of this season.",5,"""We will bring you the limp and beaten body of Bob Barker""",1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,2732,"['RELAX', 'quote', 'review', 'title', 'straight', 'Season', 'Five', 'actual', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'was', 'harmed', 'filming', 'review.As', 'Season', 'Five', 'opens', 'show', 'had', 'safely', 'made', 'full', 'transition', 'Sunnydale', 'High', 'college', 'years', 'instead', 'getting', 'entrenched', 'Buffy', '90210', 'petty', 'collegiate', 'fluff', 'headed', 'straight', 'death', 'loss', 'gut-wrenching', 'emotions.As', 'season-long', 'central', 'villain', 'Glory', 'mixes', 'every-hair-in-place', 'diva', 'obsession', 'Cordelia', 'twisted', 'consistently', 'disturbing', 'psyche', 'Drusilla', 'who', 'find', 'ex-lover', 'Spike', 'tired', 'playing', 'kind', 'games', 'Glory', 'minions', 'provide', 'fawning', 'comic', 'relief', 'otherwise', 'heavy', 'season', 'one', 'source', 'quote', 'mentioned', 'Think', 'Smithers', 'Simpsons', 'little', 'ogre', 'bodies.The', 'new', 'central', 'hub', 'meetings', 'Giles', 'new', 'business', 'venture', 'magic', 'shop', 'witnessing', 'death', 'store', 'umpteenth', 'owner', 'profit', 'future', 'store', 'Anya', 'cashier', 'more', 'comic', 'relief', 'Naturally', 'also', 'favorite', 'visiting', 'place', 'demons', 'heavy', 'blunt', 'objects', 'who', 'inflict', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'damage', 'store', 'merchandise', 'season', 'progresses.There', 'closure', 'characters', 'Riley', 'Buffy', 'mom', 'hence', 'much', 'season', 'dire', 'weight', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'writers', 'filling', 'blanks', 'mystery', '/', 'backstory', 'Buffy', 'little', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'link', 'Glory', '.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'easy', 'show', 'creators', 'play', 'safe', 'Season', 'Five', 'establishing', 'formula', 'cranking', 'out', 'tiresome', 'episode', 'episode', 'chose', 'do', 'opposite', 'take', 'big', 'risks', 'pull', 'out', 'major', 'surprises', 'defy', 'significant', 'emphasis', 'Spike', 'Season', 'Five', 'culminating', 'spoiler', 'moment', 'end', 'Episode', '18', 'Intervention', 'actor', 'James', 'Marsters', 'mentioned', 'number', 'occasion', 'Whedon', 'original', 'plan', 'character', 'was', 'kill', 'off', 'initial', 'appearance', 'Luckily', 'series', 'took', 'sharp', 'left', 'turn', 'decided', 'develop', 'Spike', 'one', 'show', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters.In', 'Season', 'Four', 'box', 'set', 'discussion', 'episode', 'Hush', 'Apparently', 'someone', 'told', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'THE', 'reason', 'show', 'success', 'SINGLE', 'REASON', 'was', 'dialogue', 'Buffy', 'other', 'characters', 'verbal', 'interplay', 'was', 'shortly', 'receiving', 'feedback', 'Whedon', 'decided', 'craft', 'episode', 'was', 'completely', 'silent', 'first', 'few', 'minutes.I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'believe', 'similar', 'desire', 'defy', 'expectations', 'think', 'box', 'went', 'production', 'season']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season
767141,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0000AQS18,Mitch Weaver,"[3, 5]","In the fifth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, we are introduced to two new characters. The first is Buffy's sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg). She is actually a mystical force of energy sent to Buffy by monks to be protected. The monks supply false memories to Buffy, her mother, and the rest of the gang which causes everyone to think that Dawn has been around and grown up with Buffy. The monks refer to Dawn as &quot;the key&quot; which can unlock all the different hell dimensions. The second character we are introduced to is a hell god named Glory (Clare Kramer)who has been banished to earth. She is virtually unstoppable, and not even Buffy can slow her down. Glory needs the key to get back home, which will open up all the other hell dimensions in the process destroying mankind as we know it. But, Glory has no idea what the key looks like. The main focus of season 5 is the countdown to when Glory will find out that Buffy's sister is the key she is looking for. The interesting side story in season 5 deals with Spike's growing feelins for Buffy, and him fighting against the fact that he is falling in love with the Slayer who has become his arch nemisis throughout the show.While I enjoyed every season, I must say that season 5 managed to be the second best season of the entire show after season 3. The entire season flowed extremely well because each episode built off the one before it. Season 5 definately poured on tons of suspense because endless search for the key. Newcomer Claire Kramer does an excellent job as Glory and becomes the best villan on the show since Angelus. Newcomer Michelle Trachtenberg also does a wonderful job as Dawn. Now a lot of people think that Buffy the Vampire Slayer &quot;jumped the shark&quot; when Dawn was introduced. However, I feel that show creator Josh Whedon did an excellent job at how he introduced Dawn into the show and with his explanation of why she was there. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy), Nicholas Brendon ( Xander), Alyson Hannigan ( Willow), Anthony Stewart Head ( Giles), James Marsters (Spike), and Emma Caulfield( Anya) are all back and do a fantastic job. This season also manages to show Willow's increasing power as a witch as well, and her relationship with Tara grow stronger. Season 5 also marked the tragic death of the character Joyce Summers(played extremely well by Kristine Sutherland) which added even more emotion into season 5.Whether it was Glory pouring on suspense and Willow gaining more power as a witch, or the hilarious moments watching Spike fall in love with Buffy, season 5 had something in it for all fans of the show. With the acception of season 3, season 5 has become my favorite season overall. Episodes worth mentioning are &quot;Buffy vs Dracula&quot;, &quot;No Place like Home&quot; which introduces Glory, &quot;Foor for Love&quot; in which Spike tells Buffy about the two slayers he killed, &quot;Checkpoint&quot; which brings back the watchers council, &quot;Bloodties&quot; in which Dawn deals with being the key, &quot;Crush&quot; which has Drusilla return to the show, &quot;The Body&quot; which focuses on Joyce's death, and &quot;The Gift&quot; which is the best season finale of the whole show. The DVD package itself is great. You get everything from great comentary and featurettes, to outtakes from the show.A solid 5 stars...",5,The second best season...,1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,3351,"['fifth', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'are', 'introduced', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'first', 'Buffy', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'actually', 'mystical', 'force', 'energy', 'sent', 'Buffy', 'monks', 'be', 'protected', 'monks', 'supply', 'false', 'memories', 'Buffy', 'mother', 'rest', 'gang', 'everyone', 'think', 'Dawn', 'been', 'around', 'grown', 'up', 'Buffy', 'monks', 'refer', 'Dawn', 'quot', 'key', 'quot', 'can', 'unlock', 'different', 'hell', 'dimensions', 'second', 'character', 'are', 'introduced', 'hell', 'god', 'named', 'Glory', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'who', 'been', 'banished', 'earth', 'virtually', 'unstoppable', 'not', 'even', 'Buffy', 'can', 'slow', 'down', 'Glory', 'key', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'will', 'open', 'up', 'other', 'hell', 'dimensions', 'process', 'destroying', 'mankind', 'know', 'Glory', 'idea', 'what', 'key', 'looks', 'main', 'focus', 'season', '5', 'countdown', 'when', 'Glory', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'Buffy', 'sister', 'key', 'looking', 'interesting', 'side', 'story', 'season', '5', 'deals', 'Spike', 'growing', 'feelins', 'Buffy', 'fighting', 'fact', 'falling', 'love', 'Slayer', 'who', 'become', 'arch', 'nemisis', 'show.While', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'must', 'say', 'season', '5', 'managed', 'be', 'second', 'best', 'season', 'entire', 'show', 'season', '3', 'entire', 'season', 'flowed', 'extremely', 'well', 'episode', 'built', 'one', 'Season', '5', 'definately', 'poured', 'tons', 'suspense', 'endless', 'search', 'key', 'Newcomer', 'Claire', 'Kramer', 'excellent', 'job', 'Glory', 'best', 'villan', 'show', 'Angelus', 'Newcomer', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'also', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Dawn', 'Now', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'quot', 'jumped', 'shark', 'quot', 'when', 'Dawn', 'was', 'introduced', 'However', 'feel', 'show', 'creator', 'Josh', 'Whedon', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'how', 'introduced', 'Dawn', 'show', 'explanation', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Buffy', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'Xander', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Willow', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Giles', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Spike', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'Anya', 'are', 'back', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'season', 'also', 'show', 'Willow', 'increasing', 'power', 'witch', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'Tara', 'grow', 'stronger', 'Season', '5', 'also', 'marked', 'tragic', 'death', 'character', 'Joyce', 'Summers', 'played', 'extremely', 'well', 'Kristine', 'Sutherland', 'added', 'even', 'more', 'emotion', 'season', '5.Whether', 'was', 'Glory', 'pouring', 'suspense', 'Willow', 'gaining', 'more', 'power', 'witch', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'watching', 'Spike', 'fall', 'love', 'Buffy', 'season', '5', 'had', 'something', 'fans', 'show', 'acception', 'season', '3', 'season', '5', 'become', 'favorite', 'season', 'overall', 'Episodes', 'mentioning', 'are', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'vs', 'Dracula', 'quot', 'quot', 'Place', 'Home', 'quot', 'Glory', 'quot', 'Foor', 'Love', 'quot', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'two', 'slayers', 'killed', 'quot', 'Checkpoint', 'quot', 'back', 'watchers', 'council', 'quot', 'Bloodties', 'quot', 'Dawn', 'deals', 'being', 'key', 'quot', 'Crush', 'quot', 'Drusilla', 'return', 'show', 'quot', 'Body', 'quot', 'Joyce', 'death', 'quot', 'Gift', 'quot', 'best', 'season', 'finale', 'whole', 'show', 'DVD', 'package', 'great', 'get', 'everything', 'great', 'comentary', 'featurettes', 'outtakes', 'show.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season
767142,A25AXWGBGJ5KBS,B0000AQS18,"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo""","[12, 13]","The season 5 DVD box needs another review like Giles needs another book, but there's no way I can resist putting a few thoughts down.This season made me feel like I need to stand on the top of a tall building and yell to the world that every single person on this planet needs to see this show.Seriously, has there ever been another hour-long drama that has maintained this sort of quality over five consecutive seasons? Yes, shows like ""NYPD Blue"" and ""ER"" have remained remarkably consistent, but they're pinnacles of a genre. They elevate a stereotype into art.There has never been anything like ""Buffy"". Those who scoff have not seen ""Hush"", or ""Graduation Day"" or this year's ""The Body"".Besides, what sort of TV show can be referenced, without sounding too-too fanboy-ish, by their episode titles?When people refer to the show as dark, it meant (in previous years) usually in terms of cinematography, in tone, in it's ""supernatural"" emphasis......but this fifth year was dark. Dark as in death. Agony. Pain. Probably the least numbers of laughs per episode, but an excruciating amount of anguish. Real tears will be shed watching this season.Oh sure, there were all sorts of little giggle-fests sprinkled throughout the 22 shows. Glory's infectious maniacal glee, the duplicate Xanders, the progressively-more-reliable Emma Caulfield as Anya, Spike's asides......but the list of unforgettable heart-wrenching moments is almost too painful to recount.First and foremost is I believe the single most exquisitely painful depiction of a loved one's death I've ever seen on television. It is unflinching. Horrifying. Oh so real. What sort of genius can fill 90 episodes of death and destruction on an epic basis, yet make one single intimate death inflict such emotional damage? On the viewers, not just the characters, mind you.Before I go any further, bravo Miss Gellar. Three words I'll never forget:""Mom? Mom? Mommy?""As a trauma surgeon, I'm prepared for pretty much anything that rolls through my doors.I was not prepared for this. I was bewildered. I was shocked. I was involved in a TV show the way no grown, married man should...yet there I was, hand over mouth, mewing out the word ""No"" to my television set.You know everytime you see somebody die on TV it's fake. I'll tell you this didn't feel ""fake"" at all.Then there's the Buffy-Riley break-up. Yes, we all knew it was inevitable, but then why were we all yelling at our TV sets when the helicopter took off?How about Tara's dementia? And how Willow cares for her? Or earlier in the season, when the Scoobies demonstrate the true meaning of family towards Tara? How can that possibly be effective, and not in the least bit hackneyed? Or Spike's unrequited yearning? The ending of the ""Buffy-bot"" episode was a master class of screenplay and acting.I can and should but will not go on and on and on.I simply felt the need to add my voice to the appreciation of this unexpectedly overwhelming show.",5,"I need a new word for ""wow"".

This was the second worst season ever (the raspberry going to season six) and Glory was the most ill-defined, poorly acted villain ever.  I think her super power was PMS.Buffy was about the teens being a step ahead of the adults, but by adding Dawn who was nothing more than an annoying whiner with no purpose once this season ended, they simultaneously made teens look bad and turned our hip lead characters into the ""souless"" adults they once looked down one.  Bad move.Buffy vs. Dracula the season opener is showed us what this season should have explored:  A vampire who wanted to turn Buffy and Buffy delving into slayer lore to find out her origins and gain new powers.  Aside from the ep where she asks Spike to tell her about the slayers he killed, we don't get to see Buffy really exploring her slayer half.  It's not until season 7 that they somewhat explain how slayers came to be and even that is sketchy.I don't think Buffy treated Riley badly, her mom was sick what was she supposed to do, stop to boink him and stroke his ego every other day?  Cry on his shoulder like he could cure a brain tumor?  He was very needy and he WAS the rebound guy, the anti-Angel (the real Angle gave her what she needed w/o being asked at Joyce's funeral).  Riley was the wrong guy, he wasn't what she needed, she wasn't what he needed and I hated the guilt trip Xander put on her for letting Riley the dull walk.  Buh-bye Riley.  Don't come back.Joyce's death was unnecessary and should at least have come at the hands of a baddy instead of dragging out her boring mundane medical condition for half the season.Dawn should have died at the end of season 5, freeing us all from her.  In fact, instead of making her a fake sister, why not have her be a kid lonely Joyce fostered?  Why make 4 seasons a lie by adding Dawn?At the end, we have Buffy essentially committing suicide to escape her craphole of a life.  Yeah, she did it to save the world, but she also did it to escape the pain of her mom's death, the tedium of raising Dawn, her friends' endless insistence that she constantly save them from danger but maintain a heart and the hopelessness of her own existence.  Where did the vivacious, strong young woman from high school go?Downer of a season.

767148,A1BBT9XLKQDV81,B0000AQS18,"N8 ""Buffy is Queen!!""","[2, 6]","Buffy season 5 was a nice return to the bad supernatural element (for those of us left feeling really empty after the lameness that was season 4) but also left a lot of feelings in the Buffy-verse just floating around.This was Buffy's last season on the WB, which is part of the reason why this season is one of the more melodramatic of the 7.  Nearly every episode had some tumultuously important emotional thing happen to Buffy (be it her new &quot;sister&quot; Dawn, the death of her mother, or at the end, Buffy's own &quot;death&quot; (yes, she dies again)) but really all that seems to happen with this season is the introduction of Dawn, and the removal of Joyce Summers from the equation that is Buffy's life.Glory makes a kick-ass villain, Spike once again saves the entire show (anyone else notice how boring Angel would be this year without Spike?), and Buffy sort of mopes throughout her life in a non-sensical manner trying to do what's right in her own eyes.  It's a very transitional season in which the characters  mature more than probably any other season and seem as though they are ready for anything, including the end of the series.  Which is why I was sort of disappointed with the outcome of Season 5.  The show was prepared for its own demise, and when that didn't happen because UPN picked it up, it seemed like they weren't really sure what to do with it.All in all, Season 5 has some great fights, some great maturing, and some great moments.  I'd say behind season's 2, 3, and 7, this was Buffy's best season (making it 4th place out of the 7).  If you're a Buffy fan this review was pointless to you because you're going to buy the DVD anyway based on what you feel about the show.  If you're a  new Buffy fan, start from the beginning or else season 5 is just going to be a big confusing mess.

767150,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0000AQS18,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[6, 10]","The fifth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a transitional season of the series to say the least.  Beginning with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) battling Dracula (yes, you read that right) and introducing Buffy's sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) who appears out of nowhere and everyone knows her, but she's new to us.  How is this possible you ask?  Dawn is actually &quot;the key&quot;; a form of pure energy that can unlock the gates between dimensions that was made into a human form and sent to the Slayer for protection, while false memories of Dawn were implanted into the minds of Buffy, her mother (Kristine Sutherland), the Scoobies, and everyone else.  Why?  There's a very, very, VERY, evil force named Glory (Clare Kramer) who is after said key, but as the above Amazon review says, Glory's not a demon, she's something much, much worse: a god.  This is where many of the show's fans began to lose interest in the show and felt that the introduction and story of Dawn was just too much.  However, the fifth season of Buffy is pure brilliance from beginning to end, and Joss Whedon and his creative team deserve all the credit they can get for taking this gamble.  Many pivotal events take place as well: including duplicate Xander's (Nicholas Brendon), Spike (James Marsters) declaring his love for Buffy, Riley (Marc Blucas) leaves after Buffy makes herself emotionally distant towards him, and the sudden death of Buffy's mother which is followed by one of the best episodes in the series called &quot;The Body&quot; in which we see Buffy and Dawn deal with the aftermath of they're mother's passing.  Buffy's ultimate sacrifice in the season finale set the stage for quite a cliffhanger before the series left the WB and moved to UPN for two more seasons.  All in all, the fifth season of Buffy contained some of the best moments of the series, and some of the best acting (Gellar, Trachtenberg, and Marsters are superb) to come along since the second season.

I just can't believe it.Season Five is the best Buffy season. Ok, Season Three runs a close second, but it's in season five that things get extremely dangerous, extremely dangerous, extremelycreative. How many times have you seen a new character (Dawn) introduced this way, and to play such an important role?Also, this is the most ""Sarah-oriented"" season of them all up till that point. She completely rules the screen time on almost every episode, with amazing and emotional peformances,leaving not too much room to Xander and Willow and the others, but this serves the history and every actor is in total top notch form here. James Marsters is supreme in the new twist of his character, who falls in love with Buffy.The Season is a rollercoaster to a dramatic, breathtaking ending in ""The Gift"". The history arc was very well planned, and the first episodes barely mention the existence of Glory.Also, there's one great improvement: stunt action. Whereas in the first seasons the producers did not care too much about ""hiding"" the face of the stunt people (mainly of the Buff's stunt woman), in Season five it's clear that someone at top level said: ""We must make it better."" Buffy's stunt is more similar with Sarah than the previous stunt, and there's pratically not a single shot where you can see the stunt's face turned towards the camera (in the previous seasons, this happened everytime, what was a little bit annoying).Riley had nowhere to go, and the producers found a decent way to make him leave the show.",5,"The Top, The Best Season for sure!!",1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,1642,"['How', 'can', 'people', 'say', 'Buffy', 'jumped', 'shark', 'season', 'five', 'just', 'introduction', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'it.Season', 'Five', 'best', 'Buffy', 'season', 'Ok', 'Season', 'Three', 'close', 'second', 'season', 'five', 'things', 'get', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'extremelycreative', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'new', 'character', 'Dawn', 'introduced', 'way', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'Also', 'most', 'Sarah-oriented', 'season', 'up', 'till', 'point', 'completely', 'rules', 'screen', 'time', 'almost', 'episode', 'amazing', 'emotional', 'peformances', 'leaving', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'room', 'Xander', 'Willow', 'others', 'history', 'actor', 'total', 'top', 'notch', 'form', 'here', 'James', 'Marsters', 'supreme', 'new', 'twist', 'character', 'who', 'love', 'Buffy.The', 'Season', 'rollercoaster', 'dramatic', 'breathtaking', 'ending', 'Gift', 'history', 'arc', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'planned', 'first', 'barely', 'mention', 'existence', 'Glory.Also', 'one', 'great', 'improvement', 'stunt', 'action', 'Whereas', 'first', 'seasons', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'hiding', 'face', 'stunt', 'people', 'mainly', 'Buff', 'stunt', 'woman', 'Season', 'five', 'clear', 'someone', 'top', 'level', 'said', 'must', 'make', 'better', 'Buffy', 'stunt', 'more', 'similar', 'Sarah', 'previous', 'stunt', 'pratically', 'not', 'single', 'shot', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'stunt', 'face', 'turned', 'camera', 'previous', 'seasons', 'happened', 'everytime', 'what', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'annoying', '.Riley', 'had', 'nowhere', 'go', 'producers', 'found', 'decent', 'way', 'make', 'leave', 'show']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season
767154,A11WKQYGX53ZS9,B0000AQS18,"Pedro B. Celis ""Global Citizen""","[4, 7]","Buffy's season 5 has a very complicated story line.  For those of us that loved the show as it was, being season 2 the greatest of all, and with Angel as the best baddie of all, we suddenly get Dawn, Buffy's new love interest and her sister!.Dawn comes to upset the confort zone in which we all were with Buffy season 1 to 4.  In season 5 we get Glory, which is a very good but quite complicated baddie.  And we also get little sister Dawn, a tipical teenager that you start by hating, and end up loving her.  Moreover, we lose Buffy's mother to a horrible natural disease.  I would say that Buffy season 5 is more than ever about emotions, and the writers play our emotions masterfully around the one topic of Dawn.  The baddie Glory is not as important as all the emotions that we go through with Dawn.  We begin hating her as an impostor and an intruder, then we grieve with her, Joice's loss, so that at the end we cannot but love her and protect her just as Buffy feels that she has to do.Other stories really develop well in this season.  Willow relationship with Tara is strength beyond any misgivings when we suffer what Willow suffers for Tara.  Xander relationship with Anya gets stronger.  Giles actually kills Glory, letting us get a glimpse of Ripper's personality.  And last but not least, we can share Spike's love for Buffy and not just idolatration as was in the case of Riley.So, Buffy Season 5 is Complicated and Difficult.

767157,A2Q4CZVCN5APDL,B0000AQS18,Rick,"[8, 22]","I have to join the legions of BTVS fans who say it jumped the shark this season.  And it's mostly due to Dawn.  Anytime a new character is suddenly introduced to a show, especially when that character is a bratty annoying little kid, you know the show's best days are gone.Another weakness is the season's big bad, Glory.  The idea of the character being a god to up the stakes was good.  But,the character's personality was badly conceived and Clare Kramer is the worst actress to ever appear on the show. She couldn't act like she was on fire if she was burning.  Her annoyance level is off the scale.  And we had to endure a whole season of her.Riley (Marc Blucas) is the most underrated, underappeciated character in the show's history.  After a promising start to the character and to his relationship with Buffy in season four, things quickly get derailed here and he is gone in episode ten.He is sorely missed.Buff's death lacked emotional impact for the fact that of course the main character won't stay dead, despite a summerlong wait, she was back to the living at the end of the very next episode.  For a main character's death to be effective, there has to be the threat that the character will stay dead, that threat was never there. (Well, it was for the few people that were in the dark about the show going to UPN who thought Buffy was gone for good, but they soon found out otherwise. When this episode aired the deal was sealed the show would be on UPN in the fall and thus Buffy would not stay dead.)  They should have killed Dawn instead and of course left her dead.  The death of her sister would have devastated Buffy and made for some good storytelling next season.  The people who liked Dawn would be moved by the sense of loss and the many Dawn haters would be happy to see her gone.  Everybody wins.Ther are some good moments this season, and with the exception of Michelle Tractenberg (Dawn) and Clare Kramer (Glory), everyone's acting was excellent.  I especially enjoyed the introduction of the Buffybot.This season was still way better than a lot on TV, but the high standards the show had set effectively ended with the season four finale.",2,The beginning of the end,1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,2170,"['have', 'join', 'legions', 'BTVS', 'fans', 'who', 'say', 'jumped', 'shark', 'season', 'mostly', 'due', 'Dawn', 'Anytime', 'new', 'character', 'suddenly', 'introduced', 'show', 'especially', 'when', 'character', 'bratty', 'annoying', 'little', 'kid', 'know', 'show', 'best', 'days', 'are', 'gone.Another', 'weakness', 'season', 'big', 'bad', 'Glory', 'idea', 'character', 'being', 'god', 'up', 'stakes', 'was', 'good', 'character', 'personality', 'was', 'badly', 'conceived', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'worst', 'actress', 'ever', 'appear', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'was', 'fire', 'was', 'burning', 'annoyance', 'level', 'scale', 'had', 'endure', 'whole', 'season', 'her.Riley', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'most', 'underrated', 'underappeciated', 'character', 'show', 'history', 'promising', 'start', 'character', 'relationship', 'Buffy', 'season', 'four', 'things', 'quickly', 'get', 'derailed', 'here', 'gone', 'episode', 'ten.He', 'sorely', 'missed.Buff', 'death', 'lacked', 'emotional', 'impact', 'fact', 'course', 'main', 'character', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'dead', 'summerlong', 'wait', 'was', 'back', 'living', 'end', 'very', 'next', 'episode', 'main', 'character', 'death', 'be', 'effective', 'be', 'threat', 'character', 'will', 'stay', 'dead', 'threat', 'was', 'never', 'there', 'Well', 'was', 'few', 'people', 'were', 'dark', 'show', 'going', 'UPN', 'who', 'thought', 'Buffy', 'was', 'gone', 'good', 'soon', 'found', 'out', 'otherwise', 'When', 'episode', 'aired', 'deal', 'was', 'sealed', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'UPN', 'fall', 'thus', 'Buffy', 'would', 'not', 'stay', 'dead', 'should', 'have', 'killed', 'Dawn', 'instead', 'course', 'left', 'dead', 'death', 'sister', 'would', 'have', 'devastated', 'Buffy', 'made', 'good', 'storytelling', 'next', 'season', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'Dawn', 'would', 'be', 'moved', 'sense', 'loss', 'many', 'Dawn', 'haters', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'gone', 'Everybody', 'wins.Ther', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'season', 'exception', 'Michelle', 'Tractenberg', 'Dawn', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'Glory', 'everyone', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'introduction', 'Buffybot.This', 'season', 'was', 'still', 'way', 'better', 'lot', 'TV', 'high', 'standards', 'show', 'had', 'set', 'effectively', 'ended', 'season', 'four', 'finale']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

Is it the greatest season?  Well, next to Seasons 4 and 6, this season blazes, but most fans will still cite Seasons 1-3 as the golden age.  Don't be so quick to toss this season aside, however, because there are some amazing stories that get told.  Granted the inclusion of Dawn into the character line-up wasn't exactly a quantum leap forward in terms of loveable characters, but she'll grow on you later in the season (although that can't be promised in seasons 6-7).  Tara's character is given a stronger voice throughout the season as well.  Spike's character, however, becomes a casualty-that is, he goes from Big Bad to wisecracking sidekick, a hat he wears decently only half of the time.  The Big Bad this season, was a woman named Glory.  I personally had no problem with her, although many fans really hated the character.  The struggle she has in the episode, ""The Gift"", with her human host for control of the body she inhabits is a true tour de force.  There are many standout episodes here, more consistent than season 4.  The opener, of course, ""Buffy Vs. Dracula"" is memorable, especially for Xander's turn as a minion.  ""No Place Like Home"" sees Buffy enter a trance-like state to try to discern the nature of her mother's illness.  The trance she enters is truly unnerving, especially as she wanders about the house watching two different realities phasing in and out.  ""Fool For Love"" has Spike stringing Buffy along for the whole episode with his tales of how he killed two slayers.  James Marsters rules here.  ""The Body"" is an important episode because it sets the tone for the next two seasons that followed.  It is not an easy episode to watch, and certainly not one of my favorites, but after this episode, the rest of the six episodes kick the season into high gear and take you to a truly breathless climax.  For many Buffy purists, this was the proper end of the series, as seasons 6 and 7 were found by many fans to have been lacking the storytelling quality of past seasons.  The jury will probably be out forever on the later seasons, but most fans will agree that Season 5 was one of the strongest.  DVD features get better and better as the seasons progress (although the navigation menu for season 2 is still the coolest).  I liked the featurette with Danny Strong and his demonologist bit.

767159,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000AQS18,Robert Moore,"[142, 156]","One of the most extraordinary things about BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is that in Season Two they managed to produce one of the greatest seasons in the history of television, and then managed to pretty much equal it for the entire run of the show.  Amazingly, each year they did this by taking the show in completely different directions.  In the season opener Buffy meets and defeats the most famous of all vampires, Dracula, but the show demonstrated its willingness to take extraordinary risks by ending the episode with the startlingly revelation that Buffy has a sister.  Buffy, of course, is an only child, but the brilliant thing was the way the show continued for several episodes as if Dawn, Buffy's new sister, had always been a part of the family.  Moreover, Dawn isn't just a part of her immediate family:  all Buffy's friends have their own relationship with Dawn, and she is clearly completely integrated with everyone in the community.There are Buffy fans who like and dislike nearly every aspect of BUFFY.  Some did not care for the addition of Dawn to the cast, but I loved it, partly for the virtuosic manner in which they integrated her in the cast, and partly for the astonishing story line that developed out of who she truly was.  Dawn, an entity of pure energy that is a key to a demon portal, was created by monks as a real human being, a real sister to The Slayer, in order to guarantee that Buffy would protect her with her life.  I love the way that all the Scooby Gang completely accepts her, and the profound questions it raises in Dawn herself, as she desperately attempts to come to terms with the knowledge that she isn't who she remembers herself to be.Old subplots are resolved and new ones emerge.  Buffy's romance with Riley, nearly universally loathed by Buffy fans, thankfully ends.  Giles takes over the ownership of The Magic Box and Anya becomes his enthusiastic assistant.  Spike, still harmless due to his implant, is horrified to realize that he is in love with Buffy.  Joyce is stricken with a brain tumor and eventually dies of a brain aneurysm, which leads to what is in many ways the most remarkable episode in the entire history of the show, &quot;The Body.&quot;  Most of Buffy is shot employing a quick, fast moving pace.  But this episode intentionally slows down time, intensifying and emphasizing every nuance of Buffy's overwhelming grief and panic at discovering her mother's body.  In my opinion, it is the single best representation in either film or TV of human reaction to the death of a loved one.Season Five's primary story arc is, however, that of the hell goddess Glory and her attempt to recover The Key (Dawn) that will allow her to reenter her hell dimension.  Glory is, with the possible exception of Angelus, the best villain in the history of BUFFY and ANGEL.  She is a goddess portrayed as super consumer (her nice shoes and pedicures causes Dawn to remark, &quot;She has really nice feet&quot;), going on spending sprees to placate her sorrows at being trapped in a dimension not her own.  Her whacky wit and (for a goddess) naive stupidity combined with her considerable power creates excitement nearly every second she is onscreen.  In a season of many highlights, I especially love the episode where Glory's minions wrongly assume that Spike is The Key, and bring him to Glory, who tortures him to find out who The Key truly is.  Despite beating him badly, he refuses to tell.  Buffy's intense and heartfelt gratitude signals a change in attitude on the part of the Scoobies, and hints that behavior and compassion are as much a mark of someone becoming good (despite being a vampire) as having a soul (in the case of Angel).

767161,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0000AQS18,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[16, 62]","Having watched the series since the low-budget 1992 movie of the same name, I was horrified by this apparent fusion of 90210/Buffy. My claim is ironic seeing as how Luke Perry stared in the campy big screen version, this season once again all of the camp but none of the humor of that incarnation which at least wanted the viewer to have fun, be entertained, and generally like the product they had watched.Unfortunately, the TV network was trying to torture us in an experiment. The name is attached--but there is none of the fun, witty writting, and character interaction which had distinguished the series. Did I mention the bratty mysterious sister who is annoying??There is just so much wrong (morally, structurally etc) in the Buffy cannon that I cannot believe it received the public praise that it did. I will just comment on the highlights of what I found was most objectionable.Riley's gone, but that is no consolation because we are stuck with Dawn. Realizing many viewers prefered the early season romance with Angel, the writers (now unfortunately headed by Marti Noxin) attempted to pair Buffy with Spike, only to come up with equally insipid oneliners that sound as if my mother's junior high students wrote them in a scriptwriting contest and actually had connections to make their creation hit TV airwaves. Spike has emotional problems with relationships.James Marsters, not even being British, is obviously a better actor than David Boreanaz, but the recycled storylines and Buffy's incompetently explained transformation from assertive go-getter to passive victim (as well as the process itself) was embarassing and insulting. He's mooning after the slayer and trying to make sure that Dawn does not get hurt. What happened!! This is a character who does much better has a villan. He's not supposed to be the caring substitute father figure.Dawn herself came on the show merely because Michelle Trachtenbeg had industry connections and really wanted to get on the show to further her hollywood career. She did not care what she damaged--or what fan base she ailenated in this process. The show was going to be 'hers' to destroy.  The plot line of a power-mad goddess named Glory (Claire Kramer channeling Supergirl-era Faye Dunnaway dramatics) is a 'strange paralell. I doubt that she noticed.Noxon et all...did not understand or did not want to understand that it wasn't the fact Buffy had a souled vampire boyfriend in general it was supposedly how he acted aroud Buffy (multidimensional as opposed to a teenybopper cartoon) which was what really counted. Also the fact that this one had been chipped as opposed to gypsy cursed meant the audience was subjected to an endless stream of sex plots, again inserting an innappropriate amount of soap into the show. Spike did not have to remain chaste and would not feel guilt if he did it with the slayer.On top of everything, Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) died and we never got an equally realistic resolution to that storyline. Because Buffy never has to deal with home foreclosure, calls from Gallery employees or potential clients wondering what happended to Joyce, the transition WAS handled very shoddily and did not reflect the BTVS I had fallen in love with. Buffy and company also coincidentially never have to deal with anything like the utility company turning off the power despite their apparent lack of funds with mom's sudden death. Fast Food (Doublemeat Palace) does not generally pay living wages for adults to live on.Likewise, her father Hank Summers never steps in again----although we certainly saw more of him in the earlier seasons when everthing was not a prolonged soap opera. He's unconcerned with the fate of his daughters. They suffered a terrible shock, even if they are adults.After all of the distress which substandard writing previously caused Joss, I am amazed he was again so trusting with scripts. Okay, he cannot be everywhere at once. But when he's not guarding the really important stuff, people who DON'T share his vision DO take over and trash the series. They did it once, and then did it again.That a long-time and hardcore Buffy fan such as myself would not touch this series even if somebody gave it to me for free should be a very big warning sign. It was the season when evil forces were about. Please do not waste your money on this purchase, and stick to Buffy how Joss meant it to be portrayed by getting seasons 1-3.",1,What happened to my show??,1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,4439,"['Having', 'watched', 'series', 'low-budget', '1992', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'horrified', 'apparent', 'fusion', '90210/Buffy', 'claim', 'ironic', 'seeing', 'how', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'stared', 'campy', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'season', 'once', 'again', 'camp', 'none', 'humor', 'incarnation', 'least', 'wanted', 'viewer', 'have', 'fun', 'be', 'entertained', 'generally', 'product', 'had', 'watched.Unfortunately', 'TV', 'network', 'was', 'trying', 'torture', 'experiment', 'name', 'attached', 'none', 'fun', 'witty', 'writting', 'character', 'interaction', 'had', 'distinguished', 'series', 'Did', 'mention', 'bratty', 'mysterious', 'sister', 'who', 'annoying', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'morally', 'structurally', 'etc', 'Buffy', 'cannon', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'received', 'public', 'praise', 'did', 'will', 'just', 'comment', 'highlights', 'what', 'found', 'was', 'most', 'gone', 'consolation', 'are', 'stuck', 'Dawn', 'Realizing', 'many', 'viewers', 'prefered', 'early', 'season', 'romance', 'Angel', 'writers', 'now', 'unfortunately', 'headed', 'Marti', 'Noxin', 'attempted', 'pair', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'only', 'come', 'up', 'equally', 'insipid', 'oneliners', 'sound', 'mother', 'junior', 'high', 'students', 'wrote', 'scriptwriting', 'contest', 'actually', 'had', 'connections', 'make', 'creation', 'hit', 'TV', 'airwaves', 'Spike', 'emotional', 'problems', 'relationships.James', 'Marsters', 'not', 'even', 'being', 'British', 'obviously', 'better', 'actor', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'recycled', 'storylines', 'Buffy', 'incompetently', 'explained', 'transformation', 'assertive', 'go-getter', 'passive', 'victim', 'as', 'well', 'process', 'was', 'embarassing', 'insulting', 'mooning', 'slayer', 'trying', 'make', 'sure', 'Dawn', 'not', 'get', 'hurt', 'What', 'happened', 'character', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'villan', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'caring', 'substitute', 'father', 'figure.Dawn', 'came', 'show', 'merely', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenbeg', 'had', 'industry', 'connections', 'really', 'wanted', 'get', 'show', 'further', 'hollywood', 'career', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'damaged', 'what', 'fan', 'base', 'ailenated', 'process', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', ""'hers"", 'destroy', 'plot', 'line', 'power-mad', 'goddess', 'named', 'Glory', 'Claire', 'Kramer', 'channeling', 'Supergirl-era', 'Faye', 'Dunnaway', 'dramatics', ""'strange"", 'paralell', 'doubt', 'noticed.Noxon', 'et', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'understand', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Buffy', 'had', 'souled', 'vampire', 'boyfriend', 'general', 'was', 'supposedly', 'how', 'acted', 'aroud', 'Buffy', 'multidimensional', 'opposed', 'teenybopper', 'cartoon', 'was', 'what', 'really', 'counted', 'Also', 'fact', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'chipped', 'opposed', 'gypsy', 'cursed', 'meant', 'audience', 'was', 'subjected', 'endless', 'stream', 'sex', 'plots', 'again', 'inserting', 'innappropriate', 'amount', 'soap', 'show', 'Spike', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'remain', 'chaste', 'would', 'not', 'feel', 'guilt', 'did', 'slayer.On', 'top', 'everything', 'Joyce', 'Summers', 'Kristine', 'Sutherland', 'died', 'never', 'got', 'equally', 'realistic', 'resolution', 'storyline', 'Buffy', 'never', 'deal', 'home', 'foreclosure', 'Gallery', 'employees', 'potential', 'clients', 'wondering', 'what', 'happended', 'Joyce', 'transition', 'WAS', 'handled', 'very', 'shoddily', 'did', 'not', 'reflect', 'BTVS', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'Buffy', 'company', 'also', 'coincidentially', 'never', 'have', 'deal', 'anything', 'utility', 'company', 'turning', 'off', 'power', 'apparent', 'lack', 'funds', 'mom', 'sudden', 'death', 'Fast', 'Food', 'Doublemeat', 'Palace', 'not', 'generally', 'pay', 'living', 'wages', 'adults', 'live', 'on.Likewise', 'father', 'Hank', 'Summers', 'never', 'again', 'certainly', 'saw', 'more', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'when', 'everthing', 'was', 'not', 'prolonged', 'soap', 'opera', 'unconcerned', 'fate', 'daughters', 'suffered', 'terrible', 'shock', 'even', 'are', 'adults.After', 'distress', 'substandard', 'writing', 'previously', 'caused', 'Joss', 'am', 'amazed', 'was', 'again', 'so', 'trusting', 'scripts', 'Okay', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'everywhere', 'once', 'when', 'not', 'guarding', 'really', 'important', 'stuff', 'people', 'who', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'share', 'vision', 'DO', 'take', 'over', 'trash', 'series', 'did', 'once', 'then', 'did', 'again.That', 'long-time', 'hardcore', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'such', 'would', 'not', 'touch', 'series', 'even', 'somebody', 'gave', 'free', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'big', 'warning', 'sign', 'was', 'season', 'when', 'evil', 'forces', 'were', 'about', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'waste', 'money', 'purchase', 'stick', 'Buffy', 'how', 'Joss', 'meant', 'be', 'portrayed', 'getting', 'seasons', '1-3']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

767164,A29CWGLEAS9AUN,B0000AQS18,"R. Seehausen ""aeroblaster2""","[3, 4]","When Buffy's younger sister, Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), showed up early in this season, it sent fans crying out that its creator, Joss Whedon, was breaking the artistic consistency of the show.Being Joss Whedon, however, he of course had an explanation for this sudden appearance of the character.It was only semi-plausible.Season 5 had a slightly over-the-top feel to it in general, starting out with the excellently written ""Buffy VS Dracula"" and quickly introducing a younger sister to the show's lead, a character viewers had never heard of before (except for a bit of foreshadowing in a couple of notable dream sequences in previous seasons).The writers kept introducing new elements to the plotline, and  ended up with a bunch of complex and occasionally clunky plot devices all merging together into a fairly cohesive whole.Some despised the lead villain, ""Glory"", or ""Glorificus"" (Clare Kramer), a god from a demon dimension hell-bent on getting back to her home and destroying everything in her path.  But others enjoyed her quirky, Cordelia-like ditziness and glamourous-to-gaudy fashion sense.  In the end, she was an interesting character, a very torn personality, but Kramer's portrayal was, on occasion, lacking.Though it had flaws, this season contains two of the most memorable episodes in the history of Buffy the Vampire Slayer: ""The Body"" and ""The Gift"".The former is perhaps the most honest look at grief over the loss of a loved one ever portrayed on television, and the total lack of a musical score only serves to punctuate the overwhelming reality of the themes of the episode.  It is also one of the best and most honestly acted episodes ever produced for the show, and many fans rate it very highly on their list of favorites.The latter was written with the intent of serving as a series finale, if the show was cancelled and not picked up by another network (UPN eventually grabbed two more seasons of it).  Its climax brought tears to the eyes of the several million viewers watching across the nation.  It remains consistently considered one of best episodes of the series.Despite its over-the-top nature and somewhat muddled plotline, as well as other niggling concerns, Season 5 remains one of the best of Buffy, and thus one of the best of television.

767165,A3252E3EF9YOKI,B0000AQS18,"Sanis1 ""sanis1""","[1, 3]","The Fifth season of Buffy was the beginning of the end of the show.  It was not all bad but it lack the greatness that the previous seasons had.  The creators went each season of having to outdue the previous season's evil character.  So in this season, the evilness had to be a god i.e. Glory.  The show lost some of its magic along the way as well.  With the departure of two main characters from two seasons ago, the show was never able to replace them fully.  Though Spike turned out to be a great character, his stay on Buffy was rather wormy during this season.  He became a stalker type, a puppy dog figure that he never truely gets over until his turn on Angel.  The show's weakness is really shown by the introduction of Buffy's sister, Dawn.  Taking a note from comic book, the creative team decided to distrub the history that they created from the first 4 Seasons and totally crush it.  Dawn's character is too young for some of the themes that ran through Buffy prior to this season.  If she was alittle older and less whinny, then I think it would have been a better idea.  Another problem was the relationship with Riley.  No one liked Riley and by mid season the creative team finally listened to its fans by having him leave.  The relationship of Anya-Zander and Willow-Tara were all done well without dominating the show like prior relationships of past.  I leave that up for the viewer to decide.  Meanwhile, Giles was being wasted as an actor and a character with his taking over the Magic Box.  It seemed at first that he was going to be more of a Watcher at the beginning but the creators cut that role by the middle of the season.  Though the death of Buffy's mother did create one of the best shows produced by Buffy, this lead to a trend of eliminating all adult influnces in Buffy's life with Giles leaving the following year.  At this point the show takes an unrealistic trend of forcing Buffy into an adult role but total eliminating some of the adult themes like paying a mortgage (also the total neglect of trying to explain why Buffy's father did not take Dawn is beyond realistic).  The show ends with a great final but again the creators book a key from comic book lore and killed off not just a main character but the title character.  Also, again the creative team does not show any adult growth in Buffy but not having her kill a human, meanwhile leaving that job for Giles.

I love the Fifth Season and it is coming out a month ahead of the original schedulings because the series is over.  I just hope that because the series is over, they will not stop giving us the wonderful extras, such as audio commentary on at least 6 episodes and the behind the scenes featurettes.This season introduces Dawn, the Slayer's younger sister whom we have never met or heard reference to.  All of a sudden she shows up, and everybody has memories of her, even Angel.  This season's theme is that a slayer can never be fully prepared for what is happening and that even Buffy, the most extraordinary slayer, cannot fight everything.  All of the foreshadowing of past seasons are completed by the end of the season.  Season Three:  Faith: ""Little Miss Muffet counting down to 7-3-0""where the 7-3-0 is 730 days, or exactly two years from then, and foreshadows that something major that Buffy is counting down to, or all slayers are counting down to, will happen in the season 5 Finale.  Season Four: Tara: ""Come back before dawn"" in Buffy's dream in the finale.The first arc is mainly about Buffy and Riley, he can try all he wants, but he cannot be the strong man that Buffy needs.  He comes to the rescue and saves her once or twice, but he cannot compete with the evils in her life.  She draws him to the darker side of the world and he gets jealous when Dracula shows up and she goes into a type of trance when he sucks her blood.  Riley wanted to know that feeling so he goes to a demon house and gets his blood sucked by a vapiress.  Once again Joss Whedon show the metaphor of vampires sucking blood as... something not meant for little kids.  When he can't deal with it anymore and realizes that Buffy doesn't love him, he goes back to work with the Initiative in South America.  This ends the first arc.The second arc starts with a powerful energy chasing after monks to get something back that they ""stole"".  Thus, Glory is introduced.  We find out more about Dawn and why we never heard mention of her before, and Willow's and tara's relationship is tried to the maximum.  I will not Spoil this any further.  If you are any kind of fan of Buffy, buy this DVD set, I will, and you will enjoy it.

Everyone is acting normally as if she has always been there, but little by little we get to understand what's going on. This will be a central element in this season's plot.And what a season it is! Powerful enemies, emotional roller-coasters, love and infatuation galore. It is as if we get the quality episodes we have been used to getting but you add on top of that one of the most fascinating story arcs ever. Once I started watching this season it was hard to slow down.

However, it became clear half-way through the season that there had been a lot of setup for the season's arc that was subtly woven in and then delivered an enormous payoff later.  Starting with the epsode the Body and moving through to the season finale the Gift, Buffy had what was probably its most consistently powerful run ever, framed by two of the 10 best Buffy episodes ever.  Week after week I remember being constantly impressed by the quality of the writing, acting and direction.  With the DVD I was sucked in all over again.So in brief a very powerful season featuring an excellent (and completely deranged) new villain in Glory and tremendous performances from the whole ensemble.  Sara Michelle Gellar, in particular, stands out as Buffy is faced with both terrible personal adversity and an opponent so powerful that her own abilities are virtually irrelevant.

If you have queries how I've seen it, I have it on Region 4 and its definitely worth buying on Region 1 if you're a big Buffy fan.**SPECIAL FEATURES**DISC 1 --Commentary by David Fury & David Grossman for ""Real Me"" - I didn't find this all that interesting because I didn't exactly love the episode, but David Fury has some interesting things to say about introducing Dawn.DISC 2 --Commentary by Douglas Petrie and script for ""Fool For Love"" - Douglas Petrie's commentary is not as great as I expected, he should've gone into more detail about the behind-the-scenes stuff in ""FFL"" instead of focusing on all the plot points. However we get some information on the building of the sets and his motivation to do the episode.DISC 3 --Trailers - We get trailers for Buffy Season 2, Buffy Season 3, Buffy Season 4, Buffy the Movie, Angel Season 1 and Angel Season 2.Script for ""Into the Woods"" - What can I say? Good script.Featurettes - Buffy Abroad, Demonology: A Slayers Guide, Casting Buffy, Action Heroes - The Stunts of Buffy**I haven't watched Buffy Abroad yet, but if it is anything as good as the hilarious Danny Strong hosted Demonology, or as insightful as Casting Buffy, or as stunt-packed as Action Heroes, it should be a good watch.DISC 4 --Script for ""Checkpoint"" - Nice script. I wish they were easier to read though.Commentary by Jane Espenson for ""I Was Made to Love You"" - One of the more honest commentaries I've heard. Jane goes into detail about the things she liked and didn't like about the episode, and also why she wrote it.DISC 5 --Commentary by Joss Whedon for ""The Body"" - This is one excellent commentary. Joss talks about making the episode, why he chose to shoot the way he did, the pacing of the episode, the actors, and how hard it was to make it in such a depressing mood. Anybody who loved the episode (its my second favourite) will LOVE the commentary.DISC 6 --Featurettes - The Story of Season 5, Natural Causes, Spotlight on Dawn**The Story of Season 5 is fun to watch because you get interviews with the cast, crew and writers and why they did the episodes they did (especially liked the talk about ""Buffy vs. Dracula""). I really wish Sarah would allow herself to be interviewed, she never really talks about Buffy on the DVDs. Also, they never talked much about ""The Gift"" as an episode, but talked a lot about the minor episodes like ""The Replacement."" I'd love to hear what she has to say. Natural Causes is an excellent look at the making of ""The Body"" and why the writers chose to have Joyce die a natural death. Spotlight on Dawn talks about the importance of family and Dawn symbolising that. Excellent featurettes, better than the Disc 3 ones.Still Gallery - Nice promo pics for the season. I wish there were more of ""The Gift"" and less of ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" just like I did with the Story of Season 5 featurette._________________________________________________________TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY? I say buy. There is a good load of special features here, all enjoyable to watch or listen to. The only complaint I have is that there is no commentary for ""The Gift"" and the writers don't really talk that much about it when they are interviewed. Did something bad happen on the making of that episode?

767173,ARK2ECYUL18CD,B0000AQS18,SOAD Fanatic,"[0, 2]","Buffy S5 is just yet another excellent season of this great show, I'd rank this season my 4th fave behind 3, 2 & 4. This season is very consistent, there are only a couple of average episodes and the rest are either very good or excellent. This season's story arc about the latest big bad Glory plays a bigger part than season 4's did. Glory is a fantastic big bad, arguably the best big bad ever. There are also some brilliant comedy episodes here like Triangle & Intervention. All in all this season is very well balanced and that is why its so highly rated by Buffy fans.

I guess diehard (so to speak) fans of the show either love or hate this season, but me... I liked it.The season begins with the Buffy vs. Dracula episode, which is pretty tepid for Vlad Tepes (although German actor Rudolph Martin, who later played the same character in TV movie, was pretty convincing as the titular bloodsucker).Next up is the episode which introduces Michelle Trachtenberg as Buffys heretofore unknown sister, Dawn. Then there is an episode called Fool for Love, which gives us a look at Spike's origin and back-story.  Listening to Fear is about aliens. Into the Woods is an interesting and emotional episode, and I Was Made to Love You, featuring evil robot girlfriend, is just the opposite (but still fun). The Body, and Forever are like mini-movies, they are so good.

I also liked where the crazy man called Dawn curds and whey in front of the magic box (little miss muffet) to finally solve the mystery for those who didn't figure it out yet.My biggest problem was how the writers dealt with Spike in season 5, and the huge plot oversight in why after repeated attempts even chipped of doing evil he remained unstaked, in season 4 they gave the really dumb excuse of him being helpless with the chip as the reason, in season 5 Spike almost caues the death of Riley in &quot;Out of My Mind&quot; and seems to come close to having his chip removed by stealing the Dr who was there to help Riley, kidnaps Buffy and threatens to have Drew kill her if she doesn't admit she loves him in &quot;Crush&quot;, and various breaking and entering,stalking and clothes stealing, not to mention the Buffybot, yet other than threats of staking, the danger he truly still represents is looked over and never addressed.Xander finally finds something he is good at, and leads to a very good income with construction, and has some really good scenes with Buffy as the heart of the group &quot;I was made to love you&quot; and some good scenes in &quot;The Replacement&quot; the character who seemed to be directionless with various bad jobs in season 4, is set up to be the only one with a future career in season5.Willow is starting to become very powerful and uses dark magic to fight Glory after she attacks Tara in &quot;Tough Love&quot;, a preview of how the lure of Dark magic can corrupt even good natured Willow.Giles is back as Buffy's watcher and re-instated with the council.Riley leaves thinking that Buffy can't be with a normal guy, and him being just human can't compete with her old love of Angel, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;Buffy I think has finally come to terms that she will never have a normal life, with the death of her mother &quot;The Body&quot;, a sister to now take care of who is being sought by a hell god, dropping out of college, Riley leaving and the hopes of having a normal relationship with him, and her final sacrifice in &quot;The Gift&quot; which would have been a good ending for the character of Buffy Summers.I think season 5 would have been a great ending for a great show, the scooby gang defeated their most powerful foe, Glory a god, and with Buffy's death it would have had a conclusion to Buffy's saga..It is worth a purchase.",4,If you like Buffy you will like re-watching season 5,1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,2940,"['think', 'season', 'ended', 'Buffy', 'would', 'have', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'upcoming', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'will', 'be', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'will', 'show', 'WB', 'years', 'were', 'best', 'show', 'overall.The', 'introduction', 'Dawn', 'will', 'end', 'mystery', 'started', 'way', 'back', 'end', 'season', '3', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Buffy', 'amp', 'Faith', 'up', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'Dawn', '2', 'years', 'later', 'quot', 'little', 'miss', 'muffet', 'counting', 'down', '730', 'quot', 'end', 'season', '4', 'quot', 'Restless', 'quot', 'where', 'dream', 'Tara', 'Buffy', 'quot', 'Be', 'back', 'Dawn', 'quot', 'also', 'liked', 'where', 'crazy', 'man', 'called', 'Dawn', 'curds', 'whey', 'front', 'magic', 'box', 'little', 'miss', 'muffet', 'finally', 'solve', 'mystery', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'yet.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'how', 'writers', 'dealt', 'Spike', 'season', '5', 'huge', 'plot', 'oversight', 'why', 'repeated', 'attempts', 'even', 'chipped', 'doing', 'remained', 'unstaked', 'season', '4', 'gave', 'really', 'dumb', 'excuse', 'being', 'helpless', 'chip', 'reason', 'season', '5', 'Spike', 'almost', 'death', 'Riley', 'quot', 'Out', 'My', 'Mind', 'quot', 'come', 'close', 'having', 'chip', 'removed', 'stealing', 'Dr', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'help', 'Riley', 'Buffy', 'have', 'Drew', 'kill', ""n't"", 'admit', 'quot', 'Crush', 'quot', 'various', 'breaking', 'entering', 'stalking', 'clothes', 'stealing', 'not', 'mention', 'Buffybot', 'yet', 'other', 'threats', 'staking', 'danger', 'truly', 'still', 'looked', 'never', 'addressed.Xander', 'finally', 'something', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'income', 'construction', 'really', 'good', 'scenes', 'Buffy', 'heart', 'group', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'love', 'quot', 'good', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Replacement', 'quot', 'character', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'directionless', 'various', 'bad', 'jobs', 'season', '4', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'future', 'career', 'season5.Willow', 'starting', 'become', 'very', 'powerful', 'dark', 'magic', 'fight', 'Glory', 'Tara', 'quot', 'Tough', 'Love', 'quot', 'preview', 'how', 'lure', 'Dark', 'magic', 'can', 'corrupt', 'even', 'good', 'natured', 'Willow.Giles', 'back', 'Buffy', 'watcher', 're-instated', 'council.Riley', 'thinking', 'Buffy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'normal', 'guy', 'being', 'just', 'human', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'old', 'love', 'Angel', 'quot', 'Into', 'Woods', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'think', 'finally', 'come', 'terms', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'death', 'mother', 'quot', 'Body', 'quot', 'sister', 'now', 'take', 'care', 'who', 'being', 'sought', 'hell', 'god', 'dropping', 'college', 'Riley', 'leaving', 'hopes', 'having', 'normal', 'relationship', 'final', 'sacrifice', 'quot', 'Gift', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'ending', 'character', 'Buffy', 'Summers.I', 'think', 'season', '5', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'ending', 'great', 'show', 'scooby', 'gang', 'defeated', 'most', 'powerful', 'foe', 'Glory', 'god', 'Buffy', 'death', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'conclusion', 'Buffy', 'saga..It', 'purchase']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

If season 2 was good, and season 3 was better, the fifth was in many ways the pinnacle of the show in overall greatness.  With a strong opening show showcasing the world's most famous vampire (Dracula) against the Slayer, it picks up from there by also introducing Buffy's little sister Dawn.  What? Buffy doesn't have a little sister you say? Leave it to this show to mess with your head and yet make perfect sense after explaining it.  Foreshadowed by Faith in season 3, and hinted at  by Tara in season 4, Buffy gains a little sister who apparently was always there.  Not going to spoil the details, but rest assured this story arc will begin to make sense and when it does, you can't help but grin at how good it gets.The season's big bad has a lot to do with the Dawn arc, and is one of the best villains since the Mayor and Faith.  Glory, or Glorificus, a hell goddess bent on obtaining something called the key in our world.  One of the best things about the great villains in Buffy is that you love them.  You hate them because they're evil, but at the same time, the actors that portray them make them characters you can't help but love.  It happened with Spike and Dru, it happened with Faith and the Mayor, and it happens here, with Glory.  Kudos to actress Clare Kramer who gives us the best evil performance since Angelus, Faith, and the MayorThis season also marks big changes in the fact that we lose one of the major supporting characters in the Buffy universe, not a major cast member but one that has been with us since the beginning.  THE BODY, is without a doubt one of the finer moments in television, full of emotion and...silence.  Not silence as in last year's HUSH, but silence in that this episode features no music, no soundtrack...just ambient noise and the dialogue of our scoobies dealing with their loss.  Again, Buffy shows that it remains one of TV's most convincing dramas with this very powerful episode.  I've never seen a show that showed grieving over the loss of a loved one so strong and convincing. Too bad many people cannot see past the name of the show and the monsters to believe that.  If they could, they'd learn a lot about what drama can be.  All the monsters and demons in Buffy are metaphors for our problems, and as such it allows it to tackle things in ways ordinary shows can't begin to fathom.All in all, a great season, and it rightfully earns it's stars and a place amongst your DVD collection.",5,GLORIUS!,1062979200,"09 8, 2003",2003,2542,"['5', 'Years', 'Buffy', 'gone', 'being', 'season', 'heights', 'season', '2', 'was', 'good', 'season', '3', 'was', 'better', 'fifth', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'pinnacle', 'show', 'overall', 'greatness', 'strong', 'opening', 'show', 'showcasing', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'vampire', 'Dracula', 'Slayer', 'up', 'there', 'also', 'introducing', 'Buffy', 'little', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'What', 'Buffy', ""n't"", 'have', 'little', 'sister', 'say', 'Leave', 'show', 'mess', 'head', 'yet', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'explaining', 'Foreshadowed', 'Faith', 'season', '3', 'hinted', 'Tara', 'season', '4', 'Buffy', 'gains', 'little', 'sister', 'who', 'apparently', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'Not', 'going', 'spoil', 'details', 'rest', 'assured', 'story', 'arc', 'will', 'begin', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'grin', 'how', 'good', 'season', 'big', 'bad', 'lot', 'do', 'Dawn', 'arc', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'Mayor', 'Faith', 'Glory', 'Glorificus', 'hell', 'goddess', 'bent', 'obtaining', 'something', 'called', 'key', 'world', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'great', 'villains', 'Buffy', 'love', 'hate', ""'re"", 'evil', 'same', 'time', 'actors', 'portray', 'make', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'happened', 'Spike', 'Dru', 'happened', 'Faith', 'Mayor', 'here', 'Glory', 'Kudos', 'actress', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'who', 'best', 'evil', 'performance', 'Angelus', 'Faith', 'MayorThis', 'season', 'also', 'big', 'changes', 'fact', 'lose', 'one', 'major', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Buffy', 'universe', 'not', 'major', 'cast', 'member', 'one', 'been', 'beginning', 'BODY', 'doubt', 'one', 'finer', 'moments', 'television', 'full', 'emotion', 'silence', 'Not', 'silence', 'last', 'year', 'HUSH', 'silence', 'episode', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'ambient', 'noise', 'dialogue', 'scoobies', 'dealing', 'loss', 'Again', 'Buffy', 'one', 'TV', 'most', 'convincing', 'dramas', 'very', 'powerful', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'showed', 'grieving', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'so', 'strong', 'convincing', 'Too', 'bad', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'name', 'show', 'monsters', 'believe', 'could', ""'d"", 'learn', 'lot', 'what', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'monsters', 'demons', 'Buffy', 'are', 'metaphors', 'problems', 'such', 'tackle', 'things', 'ways', 'ordinary', 'shows', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'fathom.All', 'great', 'season', 'rightfully', 'stars', 'place', 'DVD', 'collection']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

She deals with the arrival of her baby sis Dawn, played with conviction by Michelle Trachtenberg of Harriet the Spy and Inspector Gadget fame, as well as the loss of one of the most beloved characters in the entire series. By that I mean the death of Buffy's mom Joyce Summers, played by Kristine Sutherland. We see the return of Drusilla(Juliet Landau), Harmony(Mercedes McNab), as well as Buffy's eternal lover Angel(David Boreanaz). Then she faces off with Glory, disarms Quentin Travers and the Watcher's Council, and in the end of it all dies from a swan dive into the Hellmouth portal. One of the characters I was glad to see leave the show was Riley Finn played by Marc Blucas.

One of those Gods, the beautiful and shape-changing Glory wants the key in the worst way.The Glory story-line pretty much runs through most of the season, culminating with Buffy's sacrifice in the final episode.  Along the way there are several self-contained episodes such as Buffy Vs. Dracula.  This is a funny episode although one would hope that Dracula was somewhat more powerful although I think that's what they were going for.Spike becomes more of a main character this season as well as we start to see the first signs of his love for Buffy and his protectiveness of Dawn.And of course we have the haunting and sad passing of Buffy's mom and the aftermath on the Scooby Gang.Theses sets get better and better with more great special features.

767193,AE1OP60IC5O82,B0000AQS18,truster38,"[6, 9]","Season Five was the most arc-heavy and structured season of Buffy.  Having first hinted at Season Five's arc way back in Season Three, the excellent pacing was the polished example of a machine that, by this time, was well-oiled.  The episodes fit so neatly together and created such a complete story that many regard this as the best season of the show.  With this new balance came fewer great stand-alone episodes and more of an appreciation for the overall story.  This wasn't necessarily because the &quot;great&quot; episodes were lacking but because the &quot;weaker&quot; episodes became stronger.  Part of the reason many fans remember an episode like Superstar from Season Four so well, beside the fact that it was a great episode, was because of its peculiar placement as a stand-alone that didn't fit at the end of the season, where the arc should have been picking up speed instead of dropping off.  Season Five doesn't have that unevenness.  I find that I remember the least about this season's specific episodes and more about particular events within the episodes.  I tend to remember Joyce dying more than remembering that Joyce died in Episode 16 which orginally aired yada yada yada.  As always, the cast gives great performances all around.  Sarah Michelle Gellar in particular, Season Five after all being the season where Buffy seeks to learn more about the Slayer's history, is absolutely spectacular.  Gellar just completely embodies the role of Buffy, and her work in this season stands as one of the great TV performances.  By this time, viewers are gleefully aware that an episode can be centered around any member of the cast, and that member will respond with skill and passion for the material.  Alyson Hannigan is as utterly heartbreaking in &quot;Tough Love&quot; as Marc Blucas is desperate in &quot;Into The Woods.&quot;  And who doesn't remember Nicholas Brendon's work vividly in that same episode?  Emma Caulfield is fantastic in &quot;Triangle&quot; and James Marsters electrifying in &quot;Fool for Love.&quot;  Michelle Tratchenberg makes Dawn as sweet, annoying, and confused as I imagine a 14 year old would be even if she wasn't actually a big green ball of energy.  She does a great job holding her own.  And Amber Benson is so fragile and beautiful as Tara, a character that, like the Scooby Gang was early on in the season, none of us really knew that much about.  Anthony Stewart Head also gives a measured and nuanced performance throughout the season.  It's something you might not notice right away, but the acting in his eyes alone makes this season worth watching.  He is really not given much to work with, but makes us understand why no other actor could have brought so much depth and complexity to such a difficult and potentially shallow role.  The DVD itself is the most well packaged and put together of any of the releases so far.

Everything she ever knew was lost, and she had to learn how to go on in life, taking everything in stride.  The Fifth season is agruably the season were most of the characters grew up and learned about themselves... It was also hands-down the most dramatic season the show ever saw.The main plot of the season revolves around a mysterious key that is being hotly persued by Glory (a God that was exilled from her own demionsion).  Through the season Buffy learns that the key is something that is so precious to her, so can't let Glory get it, which leads to one of Buffy most spectacular battles (only short of the battle in season 7's ""chosen."")  And as all Buffy fans must know, this is the season were Buffy died... again.Through the season many old faces appeared including Harmony, Angel, Drusilla, and many more.  Also this the season that has the heartbreaking music-free episode ""The Body"" where Buffy loses her mother, and not to some demon but to the one thing that Buffy (or humans) can't fight... Mother Nature.Included in this season are the wonderful episodes...Buffy Vs.

767195,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0000AQS18,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 4]","The dominating theme is loss during the fifth season. Buffy's mom dies during season 5 most unexpectantly and that allows the series to examine things from a very different perspective. It was near the end of the show's run and, as a result, Whedon began to dive into a number of interesting themes and plots he hadn't tackled before.I didn't take immediately to Buffy; while I think Joss Whedon is a talented writer (he's a third generation writer; his father and grandfather were both writers for film and television as well), I tuned out the show at first because of all the praise. It made me suspicious. I'm happy to say that I've changed my tune.Season 5 had some of the best episodes of the series (I did catch up on it in syndication and DVD for comparison sake). The best episode, for me, was &quot;The Gift&quot; where Buffy sacrafices herself for someone very important to her. This fine episode (which deserved an Emmy)brought the themes explored earlier in the season full circle.The picture quality is very good for most of the discs. I did notice that there were some minor digital compression problems particularly on some of the darker looking episodes. Still, that's not a surprise given the amount of material packed into this terrific boxed set.The extras are pretty generous as well although it lacks one important person--Sarah Michelle Gellar. While I don't expect anything profound from her or anybody else in the cast for that matter, as an actor her take on her evolving character would have made this trip to Sunnyvale far more interesting.Regardless, this is a fine boxed set and Whedon manages to plug in his skewed view of life on the key episodes he authored. In light of the end of Buffy and the cancelled Firefly (a series that was never given the opportunity to take flight by Fox.

767196,A38JKOT65RLZ9Q,B0000AQS18,Wayne Rossi,"[9, 11]","After season 4 came out on DVD, I found myself still a devoted Buffy fan but unsure about the fifth season.  I wound up buying it on the advice of a friend I'd ensnared in the Buffyverse, and can't say it was too much of a letdown; I enjoyed it, but I felt something was ultimately lacking in the series.Fans of Clare Kramer's Glory (or, as it were, Glorificus) tend to cast her as one of the best villains of the series.  I heartily disagree; she may be on a par with the Master, but she's not the Mayor and she is certainly no Angelus.  Season 5 was extremely heavy on the arc elements, and Glory was too powerful as an individual and lacked good henchmen to act as ""little bads"" to contrast with herself as the ""big bad.""  That meant that Glory's threat was overplayed and overdone by the culmination of the season; a mistake of involving her in the arc too, too early.  The arc was not aided by the involvement of the Knights of Byzantium, who were frankly like the Buffyverse's equivalent of ""they need something to fight - I know!  Ninjas!"".  But, season 4 had taught us that Buffy could persevere despite less than perfect villains, and honestly after the Initiative one could almost be forgiven for thinking Glory outranks Angelus.The big controversy is over whether, at the end of the overrated ""Buffy vs. Dracula,"" the appearance of Dawn meant the sound of Buffy jumping the shark.  I found Michelle Trachtenberg to be a breath of fresh air on first view, and thought her performance was actually strong in season 5.  (Season 6 is a different question.)  It was a change that worked for the plot, letting the show do a ""damsel in distress"" routine to a certain extent.The rest of the actors pretty much stayed the course.  Sarah Michelle Gellar worked except for the late-season catatonia that Buffy was thrust into; she was particularly wonderful in ""The Body"" and ""The Gift.""  The spotlight isn't really on Nicholas Brendon or Alyson Hannigan as Xander and Willow (respectively), but both troop through like old pros; so does Anthony Stewart Head as Giles.  Amber Benson stays sweet and wonderful as Tara, though the main Tara-centric episode, ""Family,"" is pretty rank on the whole.  Marc Blucas (Riley) still can't make it believeable with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and his departure from the series is a welcome event.  It's James Marsters as Spike who goes through some real growth here; he is wonderfully fleshed out, and we see some deep (and some dark, and some pretty disgusting) layers added to his already intriguing portrayal of a vampire.As with most Buffy seasons after season 2, it's the standalone episodes of season 5 that have the most impact.  ""The Body"" is artistically brilliant, wonderfully filmed, and entirely emotionally devastating.  It is so brutally physical, so real, that it's hard to take.  Joss Whedon's directing has never been finer or tighter; he uses his camera to provoke realistic images that remind me of the brutal realism of Sven Nyqvist's camera work in Ingmar Bergman's film trilogy.  Yet my favorite episode (because ""The Body"" is something one admires, not likes) is unquestionably ""Fool for Love.""  Playing on the character arc of Buffy, it singly crafts much of the Spike / Buffy relationship, and at the same time masterfully reveals Buffy's fixation with death and darkness.  As a counterpart to Angel's wonderful ""Darla,"" ""Fool for Love"" is one of my personal favorite Buffy episodes.But, as usual, not all the standalones are brilliant.  ""I Was Made to Love You"" is somewhat weak in introducing the season 6 villain Warren; and a lot of the episodes just don't work that well.  The best comedy of them is probably the offbeat ""The Replacement,"" bringing Xander into focus for what feels like it was really the last time in the show, if we don't count the execrable ""Hell's Bells"" in season 6.  But the real weak point in season 5 is ""Into the Woods,"" which ranks among the worst episodes in Buffy history.  It takes Riley out of the show, which is welcome in and of itself, but the speech that Marti Noxon has Xander deliver to Buffy about Riley's good qualities at the end is practically Noxon beating the fans up for not liking her cardboard creation.  Just as Riley had been taken to a dark and interesting place, Noxon tries to sanctify him when he goes; it is a cruel move, and the episode deserves the vilification it receives.The up-and-down quality of the standalones is contrasted well with the main arc, which itself is a bumpy ride.  It ends fairly well, and there's some good drama and action, but the Knights of Byzantium really are just Random Ninjas thrown in to spice things up, and Glory really doesn't hold it together all that well.  It's still good television, and it's still worth watching, but it's almost unfair to compare this to the caliber of material we were used to with seasons 2 and 3.  It all finally works, and works well, in the cataclysmic and ultimately pyrrhic ""The Gift.""Season 5 of Buffy still works for the Buffy fan, and should be seen if only for ""Fool for Love"" and ""The Body,"" both of which are truly great episodes.  And the Glory arc isn't bad, it just isn't the Mayor arc or the Angelus arc.  ""Into the Woods"" aside, even the low points of this season are at least somewhat enjoyable.  It deserves watching, but it's not really a priority for the viewer who wants just the essentials.",4,You can't hit solid gold every time.,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,5388,"['season', '4', 'came',

767201,A18RJ91B28WFJ2,B0000AQS18,zebrastripes,"[0, 0]","I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season (Slim Set) (DVD) in the course of a little less than a week. In my opinion, this is overall the strongest season and has marked a turning point in the series. No longer is this show about school students but young adults understanding the dark world around them. During this review, I will explain what made this the most entertaining and addicting season even taking place after other high quality seasons.I have a strong belief that the second half of Season 2 is the most classic and memorable portion of the show despite the mostly weak first half. Season 3 was amazingly consistent but lacked passion and emotion. Into the transition to Season 5 we have Season 4, which had shining moments but was more inconsistent and had an embarrassing Big Bad, so what was to be expected for the next season? What we have here in this DVD set is a collection of all of Buffy's best elements. It is emotional, consistent, and contains an acceptable Big Bad. Throughout the episodes, the characters go through fascinating development and the theme of family is strong, both things I really enjoyed.Season 5 begins with a huge, what could be called a jump the shark, moment. A new character is added to the show, Dawn. She is Buffy's younger sibling who happens to be the Key, something that is wanted by Glory, the Goddess and Big Bad, to travel back to Hell. Some other important plots of the season consist of Spike's lusting over Buffy, Joyce's brain tumor, and Anya & Xander falling deeper in love. I found all of the plots and the way it changed and moved the characters to be extremely compelling, especially Spike's growth and the Summer's family drama. My only complaint is that Glory was definitely not the most memorable Big Bad, she is rather weakly acted and only seems like a threat in the last few episodes - but what she did brought in a lot of memorable character and plot changes. As for plot consistency, you could not ask for more. Triangle is the weakest episode, and even that is enertaining and a rather sweet story about Tara, Willow's lesbian girlfriend, who gets more of a personality in this and the following season.How are the characters in this season? Xander is sweet and awkward as always and Anya became one of my favorite characters, putting humor in an emotionally drenched season. Willow, at least from my perspective, was more put in the background. We do know she is becoming much stronger and powerful than ever before. Her girlfriend, Tara, develops more of a personality and background, even if it is a little weak. Giles begins the season considering to leave to London, feeling like he is keeping Buffy from becoming all that she can possibly be. He decides to stay for one more year after she tells him how needed he is at this time in her life. Their father-daughter relationship is absolutely beautiful. As for Buffy, with her new addition to the family, she learns to mature even more than before and continues to develop into a strong young women. Dawn tends to get much criticism from fans but I like her. She suffers from being the Key and attempting to understand her importance in this world, not originally supposed to be there. Talk about a lot to put on a young teenager's shoulders! Sure, she is not one of the show's classic characters, but she does not deserve all the hate she has drawn. The strongest character development and change is with Spike who falls in love with Buffy and has drastic changes as a character. He is no longer that pesky villan but a deep down sensitive and sweet vampire with a heart. Spike is easily the best character in the entire Buffy world.With only one real complaint, Glory not being one of the greatest villains, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best overall season. It more than makes up for the lacking Season 4 and puts the audience in a heart wrenching and emotional ride!
