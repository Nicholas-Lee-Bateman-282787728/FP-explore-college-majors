663718,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,B00005LOKW,Alejandro Cortes,"[3, 3]","Jodie Foster is known as one of the best actresses in these days, but with LITTLE MAN TATE she proved that she is capable of direct a good movie. LITTLE MAN TATE is a simple story, but it has many interesting angles.Basically it's the story of Fred Tate, a prodigious kid (expert in mathematics, physic, music and painting, among many other things), and the struggle of his mother Dede (Jodie Foster) to give his little son the possibility of enjoy a normal life without significant worries, like most of the 8 year old kids have. Eventually they meet Dr. Jane Grierson (Dianne Wiest), who sees in Fred a reflex of herself, and she tries to develop even more Fred's abilities and intelligence.LITTLE MAN TATE is a movie with interesting and multidimensional characters, even though this is a little movie, almost independent cinema, it's interesting enough to see Jodie Foster's solid directional debut. The best performances in LITTLE MAN TATE are: Adam Hann-Byrd as the little Fred Tate, he is the centerpiece of the plot and the movie, also Dianne Wiest is fine as Dr. Jane Grierson, her presence changes the life of Fred and his mom Dede. In LITTLE MAN TATE Jodie Foster is adequate as an actress, but as a director she is even better.",4,GOOD DIRECTIONAL DEBUT FOR JODIE FOSTER.,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,1239,"['Jodie', 'Foster', 'known', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'days', 'LITTLE', 'MAN', 'TATE', 'proved', 'capable', 'direct', 'good', 'movie', 'LITTLE', 'MAN', 'TATE', 'simple', 'story', 'many', 'interesting', 'angles.Basically', 'story', 'Fred', 'Tate', 'prodigious', 'kid', 'expert', 'mathematics', 'physic', 'music', 'painting', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'struggle', 'mother', 'Dede', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'give', 'little', 'son', 'possibility', 'enjoy', 'normal', 'life', 'significant', 'worries', 'most', '8', 'year', 'old', 'kids', 'have', 'Eventually', 'meet', 'Dr.', 'Jane', 'Grierson', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'who', 'Fred', 'reflex', 'herself', 'develop', 'even', 'more', 'Fred', 'abilities', 'intelligence.LITTLE', 'MAN', 'TATE', 'movie', 'interesting', 'multidimensional', 'characters', 'even', 'little', 'movie', 'almost', 'independent', 'cinema', 'interesting', 'enough', 'see', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'solid', 'directional', 'debut', 'best', 'performances', 'LITTLE', 'MAN', 'TATE', 'are', 'Adam', 'Hann-Byrd', 'little', 'Fred', 'Tate', 'centerpiece', 'plot', 'movie', 'also', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'fine', 'Dr.', 'Jane', 'Grierson', 'presence', 'life', 'Fred', 'mom', 'Dede', 'LITTLE', 'MAN', 'TATE', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'adequate', 'actress', 'director', 'even', 'better']",N/A

Although the main character is a genius, I think the main plot is about finding your place in life.  While some children are lucky and slide right in, here the genius child is out of place with his surroundings.  With a teacher and mom who cannot stimulate him intellectually, and the other children who make fun of him.Soon he has the chance to be in a school with other geniuses, but does he fit here?  I'll let you find out.I think the boy is engaging and believable as the child genius.  And as always Diane Weist does a terrific job as the head of the 'genius institute'.

This film should have had more press, it is a great, heartwarming movie.  The actor who played &quot;Fred&quot; in the movie is rather good for his age (he also shows up in an episode of NYPD Blue).  He interacts well with the cast and is believable.Basic plot outline; Mom, Jodie Foster, learns early on that there is something special about her little boy.  She has a hard time coming to terms with the fact that this child is, quite possibly, one of the smartest kids on the planet.  Some one tries to take him away to a better school, and she is offended that she cannot give him the intelectual stimulation he needs. So, she makes things difficult.  The rest, you will have to see.The movie is very good and well worth purchasing.  I only have the VHS, so I don't know if the special features are anything special, though I doubt they would be very impressive.  It doesn't have special effects, therefore, there probably aren't fifteen &quot;behind the scenes&quot; documentaries.  It generally drives me a bit crazy when &quot;the making of&quot; of a movie is longer than the movie itself. Ex. The Matrix.Gentlemen: this is a good movie to share with a ladyfriend.

Dianne Wiest also gives a wonderful performance in this movie as the psychologist with whom Fred Tate (a stunning performance by Adam Hann-Byrd) studies.  A little overbearing at times, she really gave her character life.  Dede Tate (Foster) is Fred's Mom who doesn't have a steady job and feels like she is competing with Jane (Wiest) for Fred's affection.  She finally comes to the realization that her son is looking for one thing and one thing only: a Mom.  So now it's up to her to prove that she is a good mom.

663725,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005LOKW,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[6, 8]","In her first job as director Jodie Foster shows us more than competent ability with a willingness to tell a story that's not formulaic.Jody plays Dede Tate, who could have been her character from ""Taxi"" all grown up.  Her only child is Fred.  She tells Fred she doesn't know who his father was.  She works odd jobs delivering drinks in a bar and ""dancing"".Fred is seven years old for most of the movie, and he's a genius.  Not a little bit of genius - Fred has ""Good Will Hunting"" or maybe above when he grows up kind of genius.  He plays classical piano on the clunky upright that Dede sells at one point because finances get a little tight.  Fred writes and composes poetry and when other kids are playing kickball on the playground Fred makes chalk drawings that look like they belong in the Louvre.What Fred would REALLY like is to play kickball with the other kids and not be considered a ""freak"".  When other kids are playing Fred is worrying about the ozone layer and the rain forests and fossil fuels, and Fred worries about it so much that he already has ulcers.  He's enrolled in a public school where class is so boring it takes awhile before his teachers realize he's not retarded.Dianne Wiest plays Jane Grierson, who was another ""child prodigy"" and played violin in the symphony at age eleven before growing up to head an institute for other hyperintelligent children.  She hears about Fred and invites him to come join the group.Much of the film deals with Fred being torn between biological Mom Dede and intellectual Mom Jane when he still REALLY wants a playmate.  Fred sees that despite her super intelligence, Jane is nonetheless alone and lonely.  He knows that his intelligence has long since surpassed Dede.  The other children at Jane's institute are the kind who get giddy over spelling words backwards and doing differential calculus in their head.  One of Fred's early role models, Damon, is nick-named ""The Mathemagician"" and goes everywhere with a big black cape.  Damon admits to Fred that he doesn't have any friends because he's ""an a--hole"".At one point Jane takes Fred away with her to the University where she is lecturing and he takes Quantum Physics.  In a silly scene Fred enters a full classroom on the first day of class where 80% of the students leave upon discovering that the class is Quantum Physics.  Did they not know that when they registered? In a nice touch a little later the Quantum Physics students left behind are straining to look over Fred's shoulder at his notes as he is clearly ""getting it"" where they are not.While at the university Fred gets bonked on the head and winds up meeting Eddie, played by Harry Connick, Jr. in a little movie interlude that adds almost nothing to the movie other than a scene where Fred gets a grown-up playmate.  Fred the classical pianist watches in awe as Eddie the jazz pianist tickles the ivories.  Fred has so much fun that he comes over to Eddie's the next morning. Eddie's fraternity brothers are only too happy to guide young Fred to Eddie's room where he has a young woman in a compromising position.You don't have to understand Quantum Physics or be able to do complicated math in your head to enjoy this movie - it's about the characters, NOT the academics.  We're told over and over that, in addition to his incredible genius, Fred is also super perceptive and ""sensitive"".  He's the kind of kid I hope grows up to be President.
