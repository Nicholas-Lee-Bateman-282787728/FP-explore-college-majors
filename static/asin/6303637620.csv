383277,A2UEW04N38LVB,6303637620,2many2read,"[4, 9]","An extremely convoluted little film by the talented Atom Egoyan that centers around Exotica, a strip club with its regulars and staff.Do not think that this is in any way a sexy film: it is a sad, bleak and confusing picture.It's so confusing that the DVD badly needs a director's commentary or some solution to the reverse plot on the disc.  Some reverse ploted movies -- like Following -- do include this.  (If you want a backward running plot that works and gives you Aha! moments, see Memento.)  I don't want to watch the entire movie again to figure it out.Then, too, because, Mr. Egoyan uses a stable of repertoire players, I kept thinking of their roles in the better, far clearer The Sweet Hereafter.Basically, everyone has a strange and hidden backstory. Spoilers here: the club DJ is the former lover of the dancer; the accountant cannot accept that his daughter is dead and so keeps hiring baby-sitters. One even says near the end of film, ""there's no baby to sit."" The last few scenes in the movie reveal the last bits of backstory -- the pre-Exotica lives of the characters.P.S. If I do read a fabulous plotline explanation of this film, I may want to change my rating. A revelation like ""Oh, gee, the pet shop guy is the club owner's son!""  I increased my rating to allow for that possibility -- that it's a great movie that I didn't get.I did watch it again. OK, sad film, filled with small moments of pain and loss.

383279,A39ULQ3KTNM8NV,6303637620,"""aelwen""","[12, 13]","An obsession is not unlike a dream, in the sense that you can find in both a very peculiar stance where sensibility and madness go hand in hand. But any attempt, by man or woman, to tread new roads to and from such places is  often futile, simply because the journey to such underminded conditions is  always one of self-discovery and self-torture.Quite possibly his most  sucessful movie to date, Atom Egoyan's marvelously written EXOTICA delves  deeply into the world of pain and obsession, painting for us a canvas in  which the characters and their stories are never static or cold, but  organic and contrived. Painfully marred by their fractured lives and by  their fears.EXOTICA tells the story of three very enigmatic and confused  individuals. Francis (Bruce Greenwood), an obsessed man who recently went  through a very traumatic experience; Christina (Mia Kirshner), an erotic  table dancer who has a very special relationship with Francis, and finally  Eric the club's D.J. (powerfully played by Elias Koteas), who seems in turn  to be obsessed with Christina.As I was watching the movie, I quickly  became enthralled with the story, if for no other reason simply because I  was absorbed at how very well portrayed the characters were. It seems that  at some point or another we all go through times when our own existance  seems to flicker, something breaks inside which gnaws away our sanity. The  only way to prevent our destruction is to see ourselves reflected in  someone else's life.This is the story told in EXOTICA.  Don't be  discouraged by the name, the movie is very enjoyable and fun. I was  particularly amazed by Elias Koteas performance. The DVD edition is nicely  presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.66:1, the video  transfer is solid throughout and even though there are no extras to speak  of, I think the movie itself is worth its price (or at least a rent). Give  it a try, I recommend it.",5,"Obsession and desire, Atom Egoyan's best to date.",946080000,"12 25, 1999",1999,1940,"['obsession', 'not', 'dream', 'sense', 'can', 'find', 'very', 'peculiar', 'stance', 'where', 'sensibility', 'madness', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'attempt', 'man', 'woman', 'tread', 'new', 'roads', 'such', 'places', 'often', 'futile', 'simply', 'journey', 'such', 'underminded', 'conditions', 'always', 'one', 'self-discovery', 'self-torture.Quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'sucessful', 'movie', 'date', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'marvelously', 'written', 'EXOTICA', 'deeply', 'world', 'pain', 'obsession', 'painting', 'canvas', 'characters', 'stories', 'are', 'never', 'static', 'cold', 'organic', 'contrived', 'Painfully', 'marred', 'fractured', 'lives', 'fears.EXOTICA', 'story', 'three', 'very', 'enigmatic', 'confused', 'individuals', 'Francis', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'obsessed', 'man', 'who', 'recently', 'went', 'very', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'Christina', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'erotic', 'table', 'dancer', 'who', 'very', 'special', 'relationship', 'Francis', 'finally', 'Eric', 'club', 'D.J', 'powerfully', 'played', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'who', 'turn', 'be', 'obsessed', 'Christina.As', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'quickly', 'became', 'enthralled', 'story', 'other', 'reason', 'simply', 'was', 'absorbed', 'how', 'very', 'well', 'characters', 'were', 'point', 'go', 'times', 'when', 'own', 'existance', 'flicker', 'something', 'breaks', 'away', 'sanity', 'only', 'way', 'prevent', 'destruction', 'see', 'reflected', 'someone', 'else', 'life.This', 'story', 'told', 'EXOTICA', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'discouraged', 'name', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'was', 'particularly', 'amazed', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'performance', 'DVD', 'edition', 'nicely', 'presented', 'original', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.66:1', 'video', 'transfer', 'solid', 'even', 'are', 'extras', 'speak', 'think', 'movie', 'worth', 'price', 'least', 'rent', 'Give', 'try', 'recommend']",Exotica VHS
383280,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6303637620,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 9]","I must admit, this is my first adventure into the dark and disturbing mind of director Atom Egoyan.  While I was hoping to be dumbfounded by the end of this film by amazing cinematography and story, I actually lost focus on this film.  For some strange reason, this film just didn't speak to me.  Perhaps it is because there are handfuls of films with similar themes that have been done so much better.  I was expecting a deeply depressing drama by the likes of which I have never seen, instead what I was handed was a cornucopia of bland overdramatic cinema.  It just felt like Egoyan was trying too hard.  I think he knew what he wanted to accomplish, and the idea sounded great in his head, but sadly when he transferred it to the silver screen, it just didn't seem to match.  This was a tough story to watch, and I could tell that Egoyan was having trouble behind the camera.  The feeling of continuity, solidarity, and character structure was definitely missing from this film.To begin, I didn't hate this film.  I thought that some of the actors did a decent job in front of the camera giving performances that I had not seen from them before.  I am a fan of Bruce Greenwood's work (the little that he does), so it was impressive to see him branch out and explore his acting possibilities.  Coupled with the overall depth of the film it did raise the bar a bit, but not far enough for my enjoyment.  When Egoyan should have been showing us more of the meat of the story, he instead was overloading us with elongated images of actors crying, wandering, or just muttering off into the distance.  I couldn't tell where Egoyan wanted to go with this film.  Was it to be something that intellects would grab a hold of because of the conversations, or the drama saps because of the structure of the film?  This should have been better defined by Egoyan, but instead we are left with too many clues without enough story.This is best shown by the ending.  When Egoyan was trying to surprise us, it was instead a huge lackluster that forced us to wonder why we waded through an hour and a half of dribble just to seemed shocked by the ending.  I agree, I never saw it coming, but that was because no clues were given to me to help me see the ending.  I felt that Egoyan was grabbing at nothing, pushing characters together that did not really have to go together.  I needed to see more interaction with the characters instead of just what happened with Greenwood's character.  When you are looking to make film of this structure, it is always good to not focus on just one character.  While one will stand out, it should be left up to the audience to make their decision on whom they like the most, unfortunately, Egoyan tagged early on that Greenwood would be the center of this story.  This then caused the other characters to fall into second place and not get the screen attention or development that they deserved.  We can see this with the confusing story that takes place.  I mentioned this before, but I think Egoyan had a great idea, but could not translate it to the screen.  What was the reasoning behind Eric and Exotica's owner's pregnancy?  Why did Christina and the owner kiss?  What ever happened to Christina and Eric's love?  What truly happened between Francis and his brother?  These were all questions that were never answered at all during this film.  It was as if there was another story before this on and we were not given any of it to see.  We needed to see more of the pre-story instead of what was given to us in the end.  This would have helped build a stronger ending.Overall, I wasn't impressed.  I didn't think it was bad, yet I wasn't blown away by it.  I think that Greenwood is a great actor and did wonderful in this role, but sadly I couldn't attach myself to him because I was too confused with the story.  Maybe I am wrong, buit it seemed like there were unanswered questions just left on the table throughout the film.  These questions needed answers, but nobody was brave enough to answer them.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"Do it for me, baby!",1099180800,"10 31, 2004",2004,4055,"['must', 'admit', 'first', 'adventure', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'mind', 'director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'was', 'hoping', 'be', 'dumbfounded', 'end', 'film', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'story', 'actually', 'lost', 'focus', 'film', 'strange', 'reason', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'handfuls', 'films', 'similar', 'themes', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'expecting', 'deeply', 'depressing', 'drama', 'likes', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'instead', 'what', 'was', 'handed', 'was', 'cornucopia', 'bland', 'overdramatic', 'cinema', 'just', 'felt', 'Egoyan', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'think', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'accomplish', 'idea', 'sounded', 'great', 'head', 'sadly', 'when', 'transferred', 'silver', 'screen', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'match', 'was', 'tough', 'story', 'watch', 'could', 'tell', 'Egoyan', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'camera', 'feeling', 'continuity', 'solidarity', 'character', 'structure', 'was', 'definitely', 'missing', 'film.To', 'begin', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'thought', 'actors', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'front', 'camera', 'giving', 'performances', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'am', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'work', 'little', 'was', 'impressive', 'see', 'branch', 'out', 'explore', 'acting', 'possibilities', 'Coupled', 'overall', 'depth', 'film', 'did', 'raise', 'bar', 'bit', 'not', 'far', 'enough', 'enjoyment', 'When', 'Egoyan', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'showing', 'more', 'meat', 'story', 'instead', 'was', 'overloading', 'elongated', 'images', 'actors', 'crying', 'wandering', 'just', 'muttering', 'off', 'distance', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'Egoyan', 'wanted', 'go', 'film', 'Was', 'be', 'something', 'would', 'grab', 'hold', 'conversations', 'drama', 'structure', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'defined', 'Egoyan', 'instead', 'are', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'clues', 'enough', 'story.This', 'best', 'shown', 'ending', 'When', 'Egoyan', 'was', 'trying', 'surprise', 'was', 'instead', 'huge', 'lackluster', 'forced', 'wonder', 'why', 'waded', 'hour', 'half', 'dribble', 'just', 'seemed', 'shocked', 'ending', 'agree', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'was', 'clues', 'were', 'given', 'help', 'see', 'ending', 'felt', 'Egoyan', 'was', 'grabbing', 'nothing', 'pushing', 'characters', 'together', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'go', 'together', 'needed', 'see', 'more', 'interaction', 'characters', 'instead', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'Greenwood', 'character', 'When', 'are', 'looking', 'make', 'film', 'structure', 'always', 'good', 'not', 'focus', 'just', 'one', 'character', 'one', 'will', 'stand', 'out', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'up', 'audience', 'make', 'decision', 'whom', 'like', 'most', 'unfortunately', 'Egoyan', 'tagged', 'early', 'Greenwood', 'would', 'be', 'center', 'story', 'then', 'caused', 'other', 'characters', 'fall', 'second', 'place', 'not', 'get', 'screen', 'attention', 'development', 'deserved', 'can', 'see', 'confusing', 'story', 'place', 'mentioned', 'think', 'Egoyan', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'could', 'not', 'translate', 'screen', 'What', 'was', 'reasoning', 'Eric', 'Exotica', 'owner', 'pregnancy', 'Why', 'did', 'Christina', 'owner', 'kiss', 'What', 'ever', 'happened', 'Christina', 'Eric', 'love', 'What', 'truly', 'happened', 'Francis', 'brother', 'were', 'questions', 'were', 'never', 'answered', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'story', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'see', 'needed', 'see', 'more', 'pre-story', 'instead', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'build', 'stronger', 'ending.Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'blown', 'away', 'think', 'Greenwood', 'great', 'actor', 'did', 'wonderful', 'role', 'sadly', 'could', ""n't"", 'attach', 'was', 'too', 'confused', 'story', 'Maybe', 'am', 'wrong', 'buit', 'seemed', 'were', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'just', 'left', 'table', 'film', 'questions', 'needed', 'answers', 'nobody', 'was', 'brave', 'enough', 'answer', 'them.Grade', '***', '*****']",Exotica VHS

The only thing this movie serves as a mystery with a simple plot. The movie was designed to make you think there is more to it than there really is. The key to the movie is the flash back of Eric and Christina walking in the field.They drag that flash back all the way to the end of the film,and there's you answer! They could have just made a movie out of the flashback because that is the Plot!And trust me people there is no pot of gold at the end of the flash back! The Girl Christina played by Mia Kirshner,was basically an ordinary girl that was made out to be mysterious.There was nothing mind goggling about her personality. Basically there was 3 guys that had very serious mental problems. Seriously disconnected from reality with an obcession for Christina. But not the kind of obcession you would expect. The club was beautiful but a joke, there was no nudity which really makes the movie unreasonable. A strip club with no stripping? Come on people! When this mystery unravels you will be sitting there like ""that was it?"" The only thing in this movie that resembled sensuality was when Christina was talking to the owner of the club and touching her pregnant belly. The rest is just whatever I guess! The movie is nice to look at but is very drawn out for what the plot was actually conveying. A real artistic, sensual, surprising, puzzling movie to watch would be Mullholland Dr,and Lost Highway. People that think this is the greatest movie since ""Slice Bread"" obviously haven't seen alot of challenging thrillers. ""Palmetto"" unraveled more mystery than this! But over all it did have a feel of sensuality about it I guess it had alot to do with the lighting and the fact that Mia was beautiful.

The viewer hangs on every word, both to pick up (almost desperately) clues toward understanding the over-lapping stories, but also because the characterizations are so thoroughly riveting.Bruce Greenwood displays excellent range as he portrays both a care-free young family man as well as that character in middle age, besought with layer upon layer of tragedy and &quot;baggage.&quot;Mia Kirshner similarly impresses as we see her character at various stages: as a troubled pre-teen, replete with pony tail and braces, and also as both a mature college graduate and, quite convincingly, as an exotic dancer.Elias Koteas is stunning as an anguished and lost club DJ/poet.Don McKellar and Arsin&eacute;e Khanjian are also quite brilliant in supporting roles.Be prepared to want to immediately view the film a second time -- to do so is not merely repetition but serves as an opportunity to continue to fathom the depths of the characters and the film's unrelentingly passionate intrigue.",5,A fascinating and highly provocative mosaic,1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,1363,"['First', 'all', 'Canadian', 'filmmaker', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'lavishly', 'intense', 'film', 'NOT', 'be', 'mistaken', 'quot', 'Showgirls', 'quot', 'triple-x', 'movie', 'R-rated', 'film', 'presents', 'certain', 'elements', 'mystery', 'one', 'must', 'pay', 'extraordinary', 'attention', 'detail', 'innuendo', 'intensity', 'characters', 'plot', 'propel', 'film', 'several', 'levels', 'viewer', 'hangs', 'word', 'pick', 'up', 'almost', 'desperately', 'clues', 'understanding', 'over-lapping', 'stories', 'also', 'characterizations', 'are', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'riveting.Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'displays', 'excellent', 'range', 'care-free', 'young', 'family', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'middle', 'age', 'besought', 'layer', 'layer', 'tragedy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'similarly', 'see', 'character', 'various', 'stages', 'troubled', 'pre-teen', 'replete', 'pony', 'tail', 'braces', 'also', 'mature', 'college', 'graduate', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'exotic', 'dancer.Elias', 'Koteas', 'stunning', 'anguished', 'lost', 'club', 'DJ/poet.Don', 'McKellar', 'Arsin', 'eacute', 'Khanjian', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'supporting', 'roles.Be', 'prepared', 'want', 'immediately', 'view', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'merely', 'repetition', 'opportunity', 'continue', 'fathom', 'depths', 'characters', 'film', 'unrelentingly', 'passionate', 'intrigue']",Exotica VHS

'Exotica', a ""Gentleman's Club"", is the focal point of a world in search of meaning. Men come not just to watch beautiful women sensually dance in various stages of undress. They come to forget, however briefly, the pain and suffering they have experienced in the world outside.Christina (Mia Kirshner) and Eric (Elias Koteas) work at the club, Christina as a dancer, Eric as the DJ. As the customers watch the enchanting Christina perform on-stage and privately, Eric watches the customers watch her. As you might have guessed, while moods and emotions are generally muted and controlled within the confines of Exotica they are forever on the verge of breaking through the illusory nature created and sustained by alcohol and sexual stimulation. There are untold stories to be brought into the light of day and only when the truth is known will the many tangled relationships and reasons for being there finally make sense.Director Atom Egoyan has conjoured up a place outside of time and space, a purgatorial oasis where all regrets, memories and hopes converge into the incessant drone of the music and the tantalizing movements of the dancers. Truly a stunning vision that will stay with the viewer for quite sometime. Definitely not a film for everyone, 'Exotica' deals with adult situations and contains numerous scenes of nudity and some mild homosexuality. However this thoughtful, probing tale ultimately transcends most of the dark, depressing elements and offers a ray of hope and forgiveness. If you're the adventureous type who is looking for something different 'Exotica' is definitely the film for you.Mia Kirshner and Elias Koteas (two of my favorite actresses/actors) are fantastic. Also wonderful performances by Bruce Greenwood, Don McKellar, Arsinee Khanjian and a young Sarah Polley.",5,"""You Have To Ask Yourself What Brought The Person To This Point?""",1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,1927,"['undiscovered', 'gem', 'film', 'incredibly', 'inventive', 'powerful', 'script', 'sure', 'suprise', 'please', ""'Exotica"", 'Gentleman', 'Club', 'focal', 'point', 'world', 'search', 'meaning', 'Men', 'come', 'not', 'just', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'women', 'sensually', 'dance', 'various', 'stages', 'undress', 'come', 'forget', 'however', 'briefly', 'pain', 'suffering', 'have', 'experienced', 'world', 'outside.Christina', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'Eric', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'work', 'club', 'Christina', 'dancer', 'Eric', 'DJ', 'customers', 'watch', 'enchanting', 'Christina', 'perform', 'on-stage', 'privately', 'Eric', 'customers', 'watch', 'might', 'have', 'guessed', 'moods', 'emotions', 'are', 'generally', 'muted', 'controlled', 'confines', 'Exotica', 'are', 'forever', 'verge', 'breaking', 'illusory', 'nature', 'created', 'sustained', 'alcohol', 'sexual', 'stimulation', 'are', 'untold', 'stories', 'be', 'brought', 'light', 'day', 'only', 'when', 'truth', 'known', 'will', 'many', 'tangled', 'relationships', 'reasons', 'being', 'finally', 'make', 'sense.Director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'conjoured', 'up', 'place', 'time', 'space', 'purgatorial', 'oasis', 'where', 'regrets', 'memories', 'converge', 'incessant', 'drone', 'music', 'tantalizing', 'movements', 'dancers', 'Truly', 'stunning', 'vision', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'quite', 'sometime', 'Definitely', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', ""'Exotica"", 'deals', 'adult', 'situations', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'mild', 'homosexuality', 'However', 'thoughtful', 'probing', 'tale', 'ultimately', 'most', 'dark', 'depressing', 'elements', 'ray', 'hope', 'forgiveness', ""'re"", 'adventureous', 'type', 'who', 'looking', 'something', 'different', ""'Exotica"", 'definitely', 'film', 'you.Mia', 'Kirshner', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'two', 'favorite', 'actresses/actors', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Also', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Don', 'McKellar', 'Arsinee', 'Khanjian', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Polley']",Exotica VHS

Films like Mullholland Drive, Memento, Following, etc. Like a good postmodern novel (no that's not an oxymoron - there are a few [Paul Auster comes immediately to mind]) these films are non-linear and one is kept guessing about not only what will happen, but whethere central characters are crazy, evil, benign, etc. The audience is kept intentionally in the dark, and thus on edge, and sometimes (as is the case with Mullholland Drive) there is no clear resolution, no tidying things up at the end. Egoyan seems to be operating in similar territory.Another characterstic that these directors share is that often their characters are not what one would call likeable. This is the case in Exotica. A Canadian Customs Inspector (David Hemblen) is assigned to audit the books of a nervous Toronto exotic pet shop owner. From the outset, we see that this is not going to be your typical CPA/customer relationship. Things get more intriguing when the inspector finds a pistol in the pet-shop owner's drawer and reacts enigmatically.As the film progresses, the inspector's psyche gradually disintegrates, until finally there is a denouement of denouements at the end of the film. Finally, Egoyan lets the audience in on the source of the inspector's descent into emotional breakdown. No spoilers here, but suffice it to say that the ending provides resolution, without relying on clich&eacute;s.Another satisfying Egoyan film. Thoughful script.

The same flashy, self-conscious editing/direction and messing with timelines characterize all three movies.  Unfortunately, the emotional throughlines of the character's stories in ""Exotica"" aren't served well by this technique.  For flashbacks, enigmatic characters, surprising revelations, etc. to thrill rather than frustrate the viewer,  the characters themselves should be distanced from the viewers by a cynical point of view, as was the case in ""Suspects"" and ""Games"".In ""Exotica"", Egoyan attempts to draw us into the inner lives and histories of characters who have suffered enormous loss and interact with each other complexly. But beyond that, he really wants us to connect emotionally with these characters (and the fine acting throughout encourages this).

383292,A3MKHD3AKS69BH,6303637620,"Danny Kim ""Taste""","[2, 4]","The set up for &quot;Exotica&quot; is similar to all of Atom Egoyan's films: a situation that brings characters colliding into each other, mostly quiet and subtly, in classic Canadian restraint.  They collide in the most peculiar locations and situations.  In &quot;The Adjuster&quot;, Elias Koteas plays a man who donates his house to a family that has lost their lives to a seemingly tragic fire only to suffer same the fate of his clients that he puts his own family's lives on the line for.In Exotica, Koteas plays a college radio dj turned strip club announcer.  And Egoyan chooses to portray the descent from innocence eloquently through flashbacks.  Mychael Danna's score provides an integral emotional lift and feeling of hope to the scenes between Eric and Christina.  This contrasts sharply with the exotic Indian Hindi vocals that relentlessly accompany the strippers as they disrobe.The depth of expression is conveyed as simply as Eric flicking a light on and off until the reason is not there.  Over the vocal track you hear the regret in his voice, &quot;I just need to find a structure.  I feel like the days just slip away.&quot;  There is a slight vein of philosophy throughout most of Egoyan's films.  The man is so intellectual, he could not create a philosophically devoid film if his life depended on it (though he did have a stint as a director on tv with &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;)Though some of the acting is a bit wooden, as is the case with most Canadian films (and actors ie. Keanu), the glimmer of the gem here is the ethereal heaven and occupational hell that Egoyan pours focused expression into.  He takes a lot of care into creating flawed but sympathetic characters that may appear deranged on the surface, but slowly we are shown the pieces that have unraveled them.  And the payoff is eery but appropriate for the tone of this film.  If you like Egoyan's style, I highly recommend &quot;Speaking Parts&quot; and &quot;Felicia's Journey&quot;.  &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; falls in the category of a less personal novel adaptation, opposed to the originally written Exotica.",5,A Classic Tale of Fallen Angels,978480000,"01 3, 2001",2001,2149,"['set', 'up', 'quot', 'Exotica', 'quot', 'similar', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'films', 'situation', 'characters', 'colliding', 'other', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'subtly', 'classic', 'Canadian', 'restraint', 'collide', 'most', 'peculiar', 'locations', 'situations', 'quot', 'Adjuster', 'quot', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'man', 'who', 'house', 'family', 'lost', 'lives', 'seemingly', 'tragic', 'fire', 'only', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'clients', 'own', 'family', 'lives', 'line', 'for.In', 'Exotica', 'Koteas', 'college', 'radio', 'dj', 'turned', 'strip', 'club', 'announcer', 'Egoyan', 'chooses', 'portray', 'descent', 'innocence', 'eloquently', 'flashbacks', 'Mychael', 'Danna', 'score', 'integral', 'emotional', 'lift', 'feeling', 'hope', 'scenes', 'Eric', 'Christina', 'sharply', 'exotic', 'Indian', 'Hindi', 'vocals', 'relentlessly', 'strippers', 'disrobe.The', 'depth', 'expression', 'conveyed', 'as', 'simply', 'Eric', 'flicking', 'light', 'reason', 'not', 'there', 'vocal', 'track', 'hear', 'regret', 'voice', 'quot', 'just', 'need', 'find', 'structure', 'feel', 'days', 'just', 'slip', 'away.', 'quot', 'slight', 'vein', 'philosophy', 'most', 'Egoyan', 'films', 'man', 'so', 'intellectual', 'could', 'not', 'create', 'philosophically', 'devoid', 'film', 'life', 'depended', 'did', 'have', 'stint', 'director', 'tv', 'quot', 'Friday', '13th', 'quot', 'quot', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'quot', 'acting', 'bit', 'wooden', 'case', 'most', 'Canadian', 'films', 'actors', 'ie', 'Keanu', 'glimmer', 'gem', 'here', 'ethereal', 'heaven', 'occupational', 'hell', 'Egoyan', 'pours', 'focused', 'expression', 'lot', 'care', 'creating', 'flawed', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'may', 'appear', 'deranged', 'surface', 'slowly', 'are', 'shown', 'pieces', 'have', 'unraveled', 'payoff', 'eery', 'appropriate', 'tone', 'film', 'like', 'Egoyan', 'style', 'highly', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Speaking', 'Parts', 'quot', 'quot', 'Felicia', 'Journey', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'quot', 'category', 'less', 'personal', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'opposed', 'originally', 'written', 'Exotica']",Exotica VHS
383293,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303637620,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 4]","Atom Egoyan's Exotica is an outstanding movie.  I have seen Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter (1997) which is also very good.  A father's (obsessive) love for his daughter(s) is featured in both movies, consequently the theme must mean something special to Egoyan.  He is a most talented and original movie maker, a Canadian as are his players, Bruce Greenwood, (Francis Brown, the accountant whose daughter was murdered), Sarah Polley, (Tracey, the high school girl), and Mia Kirshner, (Christina, the exotic dancer).  His wife, Arsinee Khanjian and Polley were also featured in The Sweet Hereafter.What really makes the movie is Egoyan's use of time and action sequence.  He cuts up the chronological order of events and then presents them in a dramatic way.  This is not so easy to do.  Christopher Nolan in Memento (2000) used the same technique to great advantage.  I have come late to such a technique and would love to master it myself.  I worked on it last year and a couple of years before.  You can't just scissor it and then paste it back together.  Something must be gained from reversing the order of events.  When Eric and Christina are shown walking the fields in a long line of people I jumped to the conclusion that Tracey would be found dead.  We don't learn that Francis lost his daughter until the film is nearly finished.The psychology of Francis and the young girls is interesting.  Christina says she gave something to him and he gave something to her.  This vagueness with its unmistakable sexuality is something that always exists between young girls and older men.  And, as Egoyan observes, there are rules and awkwardness, and confused emotions.  However the girl wants it made unmistakably clear that she is desired physically and just talk is almost never sufficient.  She often doesn't know whether she really wants to be ""taken"" fully, and of course that is usually, shall we say, problematic.  Some great subtly is required in handled such a theme, and Egoyan realizes that.  His character Francis Brown is content with fantasy and does not touch at all.This film would have found a larger audience except for the title, the theme, and the milieu.  The female audience for the most part didn't even consider watching the movie since, as one woman said, I thought it was just another movie with an older man lusting after a girl half his age.  That theme bores women to death.  But surprisingly at the IMDb a viewer asks how women feel about the film and several write in to say that they liked it.  Another poster remarks that women over forty actually liked Exotica in higher percentages than males.I thought the veracious and business-like depiction of the exotic dancer club was well done.  The very nice side plot with the gay animal importer was just a perfect fit for the main plot.  Egoyan wrote the script.  It is a great script.  So much surprises.  It's almost too good.  For me, since I have seen so many, many movies, something different, some surprises in plot, in character, in treatment are always welcome.And the plot does surprise.  Even when the protagonist, Francis waits outside the club to shoot Eric, Egoyan turns the situation on its head by having Eric appear from the side and explain something that changes Francis's attitude toward him.I am being vague because I don't want to spoil the story.  Some movies--most movies I would say, since I go back to the generation that would go into the theatre and sit down during the middle of the movie; and then four or five hours later, realize, ""This is where I came in""--in most movies to know the ending or the plot would not spoil the movie.  We know so and so dies at the end.  What is interesting is how he dies, how the actions develops.  But in this movie to know the plot would take something away.I think.  I'm not sure.  Anyway Francis is a tax auditor who lost his daughter when she was less than eight years old.  She was murdered.  The police initially thought he did it, but he was found innocent and the murderer was apprehended and convicted.  But Francis is left hollow and tries to bring her back in a way by having teenage girls ""babysit"" his nonexistent daughter.

Each of these characters--the DJ of Club Exotica (Elias Koteas), the pregnant owner of the club (Egoyan's wife Arsinee Khanjian), the mysterious, school girl dancer (Mia Kirshner), her most frequent customer (Bruce Greenwood), and the lonely owner of an exotic pet store (Don McKellar)--has something hidden, deep within the interactions between each other and the non-linear storytelling of Exotica, which multiple viewings enhance to even greater detail.After winning many Genie Awards (the Canadian equivelant of the American Oscar) including best director and picture, as well as being hailed as a &quot;Miramax Classic&quot; on the box, one would think that the DVD would be filled with lots of added bonuses, and at the very least: a theatrical trailer.  Alas, the Exotica DVD boasts no special features, if you don't count the gorgeous widescreen transfer, much to my own dismay.Since many critics praised the film when it was released in 1994, especially Roger Ebert, there is hope that a new DVD will be created.  The Criterion Collection includes numerous foreign, avant-garde, cultish films on DVD, most all of them boasting quite a few, excellent special features (especially the sadly-out-of-print Sid &amp; Nancy DVD; but not for the feature-less Night Porter disc).

Then we have Francis (Bruce Greenwood), an auditor who spends most of his time with Christina at the club, but doesn't really get ""friendly"" with her.  He also gives piano lessons to a girl about 15 (Sarah Polley) and acts very strange...too polite.  What kind of pervert is he?

383311,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6303637620,Only-A-Child,"[34, 37]","CAUTION-SPOILERS AHEAD-EXOTICA has been overwhelmingly praised by the critics. I think the Tomatometer is at 95% favorable. Here is my take on EXOTICA-maybe it will help some viewers to appreciate this fine film.The film is very much a paradox, sensual but sterile, intense but distant, hollow but haunting. It is a complex story with a relatively simple theme. The characters include Francis (Bruce Greenwood) as a Canadian government revenue auditor who is auditing the financials of an exotic pet store (whose owner Thomas is played by Don McKeller) while trying to exorcise his demons at a strip club called EXOTICA. During his nocturnal visits to the club he pays his niece Tracey (played by Sarah Polley) to baby-sit his seemingly absent daughter. The viewer gets to know the strip club DJ, Eric (Elias Koteas); a stripper, Christina (Mia Kirshner) who dances for Francis and happens to be Eric's ex-girlfriend; and the very pregnant (by Eric) club owner Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian) who is having an affair with Christina.The plot is an example of elliptical storytelling in that it moves in a purposeful ever-circling way to slowly reveal the connections between the worlds of each character. There is enough misdirection to keep the viewer wary of their perceptions. They must pay complete attention and remember what they see.There are significant technical reasons to like this film. It is first and foremost a director's film and Adam Egoyan's directing is amazing. A director is responsible for both casting and for directing their cast. For Exotica Egoyan added to his cast of regulars two of the best young actresses (Kirshner and Polley) in Canada. Kirshner's performance provides an extremely unusual combination of sensuality and thinly masked pain. Polley is simply the most subtly expressive actress in film today. They are world class talents who seem to deliberately stay away from mainstream films but have little trouble getting lots of work. Greenwood, McKellar, Koteas, and Khanjian, are likewise excellent. Egoyan kept all six reined-in so that their performances are low-key and restrained. While there were many stylish and beautiful camera shots he mostly keeps the characters at a distance. Exotic d&eacute;cor, busy sets, atmosphere, restrained acting, minimal tight shots, and frequent plot misdirection keeps the viewer from bonding or strongly identifying with the characters. He did not want the viewer getting into the heads of the characters, he wanted us to internalize the theme and to take it into our heads. This way if we pay attention we will learn as much about ourselves as we will about the characters.The theme is substitution, how the process of living is simply a process of substitution. We grow out of things and find substitutes for them. We lose something precious but we carry on by finding a substitute. We expand our horizons and find substitutes that we did not know about or that we thought unattainable. We need something we can't have so we find something that works as a substitute. Sometimes the substitutes are an improvement on the original, sometimes they are a better match with a new stage of life, sometimes they are an imperfect substitute but the best that we can manage, and sometimes (certainly in this film) they are an addictive trap that keep us from moving on or growing.Most people's dreams don't come true and they settle for a substitute, often without really noticing. The most compelling scene in `Field of Dreams' is when Burt Lancaster is talking about what it was like to give up his dream of playing major league baseball. He says: `It was like coming this close to your dream and then watching it brush past you like a stranger in a crowd. At the time I didn't think much about it. We just don't recognize the most significant moments in our lives when they happen. Back then I thought: there will be other days, I didn't realize that was the only day'. While his character accepted the end of his dream and substituted a life as the town doctor, in Exotica the substitutes are dysfunctional because there is no acceptance. That is why so many of the substitutions involve payment, a transactional substitution is a temporary event and allows the illusion to stay alive.Exotica focuses on the substitutes used by its central characters. Francis substitutes Christina for his daughter and Tracey for Christina (when she was his daughter's babysitter). Eric substitutes his club DJ job for the career he wanted in radio, he substitutes his voyeurism in the club for his inability to have a lasting relationship. Zoe substitutes for her dead mother and continues to run the club, instead of a husband she has Eric contractually substitute so that she can have a baby. Thomas substitutes his opera liaisons for a real relationship and substitutes an incubator for the eggs he has taken from a nest. Christina substitutes a protective Francis for her uncaring and probably abusive father. Voyeurism substitutes for interaction.Eric's voyeurism eventually leads him to the conclusion that the Francis-Christina mutual dependency has gone from a temporary coping mechanism to an addictive trap. He elects to destroy that relationship by convincing Francis to touch Christina. Eric knows that the relationship must end once this occurs, no matter how Christina reacts. Either she will no longer be able to use Francis because he betrayed her trust or Francis will no longer be able to use her because he can no longer maintain his illusion of protecting her purity. Then they will both have to move on and seek new and hopefully more positive substitutes.Contrary to some who have commented on this film I did not see any real `plot holes'. Almost every detail is eventually explained and if anything Egoyan made the plot a little too predictable. But at least this was balanced by some interesting misdirection-like having Tracey live above a shabby strip mall so you jump to the conclusion that she is a child prostitute and that Francis has a thing for young girls. Certainly on the second viewing it is clear that many clues are provided and that the outcome is being subtly telegraphed throughout the film in a kind of mental striptease.As already mentioned, the really unique feature of this movie is that the viewer does not really connect with the characters but instead connects with the substitution theme. The audience is given a new perspective from which to think about their own substitutions. Perceptive members of the audience are forced to be more than observers. This is powerful stuff.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5,Help For the Viewer?,1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,6622,"['CAUTION-SPOILERS', 'AHEAD-EXOTICA', 'been', 'overwhelmingly', 'praised', 'critics', 'think', 'Tomatometer', '95', '%',

But it was not what I expected.  The whole movie is about being not what you expected.  We think we understand the people we are seeing, we want to put them into stereotypes, but it doesn't work that way. The movie shows how one event (which we never fully understand until the VERY end) can have life-changing impacts on so many people.  We see all these strange plot elements coming together, almost (sorry for the cliche) like a rug being woven. Seeming unconnected elements come together into a whole.It is also a sad movie. Not like a tear-jerker sad, but a sadness that permeates all the characters throughout.  They have no joy...the stripping has ZERO joy, so do not get this movie if you want stripping. It is paced to match this sadness, and the performances are minimal and spare. If you need fast-paced, Hollywood style plot development, stay far away.  If you need something though-provoking, surprising and emotionally draining, here you go!

383318,A3E1N2J6DHGXL4,6303637620,Robert Gamble,"[12, 14]","One has to wonder if those who rated this movie poorly 'got it'.  I gave this to a co-worker and he was highly confused at the end because he missed a critical link.  For myself, I'm not sure what I expected.  I knew I liked Mia Kirshner, and the pick-up of the DVD in a bargain bin was a &quot;what the heck&quot; purchase though I'd read reviews that seemed to promise a dark, disturbing, thought provoking movie.Well, the packaging, as alluded to in the description, makes this seem like a standard erotic thriller.  The addition of much of the action taking place in a strip club only seems to reinforce this as being standard, even shallow, fare.  It's anything but.  It might not be believable as a story, but the characters themselves are.  Not only that, but fittingly enough, the shallowest seeming character through much of the film turns out to be potentially the most complex.  It wasn't until after the end credits had rolled, and while still wrapping my mind around the whole canvas of the movie, it clicked as to why the character may have acted in a certain way.I'll add a disclaimer here for anyone interested in the movie.  If you are at all squeamish about the concepts of pedophelia, homosexuality, strip clubs, etc... well, just be aware that you might feel highly uncomfortable.  I only plead discomfort to the first and parts were painful to watch even though nothing explicitly happens (and as is the case of the whole movie, nothing is anywhere near as simple or obvious as it first appears).Highly recommended if you want a thought provoking, dark movie that at times makes you do a mental doubletake.",5,Shallow to deep.,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,1627,"['One', 'wonder', 'who', 'rated', 'movie', 'poorly', ""'got"", 'gave', 'co-worker', 'was', 'highly', 'confused', 'end', 'missed', 'critical', 'link', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expected', 'knew', 'liked', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'pick-up', 'DVD', 'bargain', 'bin', 'was', 'quot', 'what', 'heck', 'quot', ""'d"", 'read', 'reviews', 'seemed', 'promise', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie.Well', 'packaging', 'alluded', 'description', 'seem', 'standard', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'addition', 'much', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'strip', 'club', 'only', 'reinforce', 'being', 'standard', 'even', 'shallow', 'fare', 'anything', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'believable', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'Not', 'only', 'fittingly', 'enough', 'shallowest', 'seeming', 'character', 'much', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'potentially', 'most', 'complex', 'was', ""n't"", 'end', 'credits', 'had', 'rolled', 'still', 'wrapping', 'mind', 'whole', 'canvas', 'movie', 'clicked', 'why', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'acted', 'certain', 'way.I', ""'ll"", 'add', 'disclaimer', 'here', 'anyone', 'interested', 'movie', 'are', 'squeamish', 'concepts', 'pedophelia', 'homosexuality', 'strip', 'clubs', 'etc', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'might', 'feel', 'highly', 'uncomfortable', 'only', 'plead', 'discomfort', 'first', 'parts', 'were', 'painful', 'watch', 'even', 'nothing', 'explicitly', 'as', 'case', 'whole', 'movie', 'nothing', 'anywhere', 'near', 'simple', 'obvious', 'first', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'want', 'thought', 'provoking', 'dark', 'movie', 'times', 'do', 'mental', 'doubletake']",Exotica VHS
383319,A16QODENBJVUI1,6303637620,Robert Moore,"[5, 5]","This was easily one of the best films made in the 1990s, but it has to be strongly emphasized that it is not a sex film.  The movie is not about sex, but about relationships, and the bizarre and wildly unexpected ways our lives can criss-cross each other.  The movie does not have a fraction of the intended sexual content of a movie like BASIC INSTINCT or SHOWGIRLS.  If someone rents EXOTICA expecting to be titillated, they are going to be severely disappointed.  On the other hand, if you want a film that will challenge you intellectually, this is your flick.The movie is best seen two or more times.  The plot is not incoherent, as some writing here have found it, but complex.  And part of the job of a re-viewing is seeing all the subtle ways the lives of the different characters are bound up with the lives of the other principle characters.  Gradually we are given more and more information about the characters, and when we receive the last bits in the final seconds of the movie, the effect, at least for me, is staggering.The acting is superb.  Bruce Greenwood, a staple of Atom Egoyen films, is marvelous as the accountant.  His character is also the hardest to figure out.  It is only near the very end of the movie when we have enough evidence of what has happened to him that we are able to understand what makes him tick.  Mia Kirshner is good in her role as the stripper in the club who has a very unusual relationship with the account.  Again, the dynamics of their connection is not explained until the very last shot in the film.  But the kudos for the most impressive job in this film goes to the tragically underrated and underappreciated Elias Koteas, as the club DJ and estranged boyfriend of the stripper.  In most films, Koteas has only a very small role to work with, such as LIVING OUT LOUD (where he plays &quot;the kisser&quot; [check the credits!  that's his character's name!] the man Holly Hunter meets very briefly on the back landing of a nightclub) or as the morally conflicted captain who is relieved of his duty for showing too much concern for the well-being of his men in THE THIN RED LINE.  EXOTICA gives us a hint of what he could do with more significant roles.EXOTICA has one of the most surreal scenes I have ever seen:  Mia Kirshner dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl, signing in American Sign Language the lyrics of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, while she does a strip dance (again, not as sexy as it might sound).So, while not even remotely a sex film, this is an exceptionally complex and intelligent one about the intricacies of human relationships.  In closing I would like to agree with the reviewer who found the cover of the video/DVD to be horrid.  It seriously misrepresents the nature of the film.  This is very much an &quot;art&quot; film, not an erotic one.",5,A Phenomenal But Unexpectedly Nonerotic Film,997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,2833,"['was', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'made', '1990s', 'be', 'strongly', 'emphasized', 'not', 'sex', 'film', 'movie', 'not', 'sex', 'relationships', 'bizarre', 'wildly', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'lives', 'can', 'criss-cross', 'other', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'fraction', 'intended', 'sexual', 'content', 'movie', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', 'SHOWGIRLS', 'someone', 'rents', 'EXOTICA', 'expecting', 'be', 'titillated', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'other', 'hand', 'want', 'film', 'will', 'challenge', 'intellectually', 'flick.The', 'movie', 'best', 'seen', 'two', 'more', 'times', 'plot', 'not', 'incoherent', 'writing', 'here', 'have', 'found', 'complex', 'part', 'job', 're-viewing', 'seeing', 'subtle', 'ways', 'lives', 'different', 'characters', 'are', 'bound', 'up', 'lives', 'other', 'principle', 'characters', 'Gradually', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'more', 'information', 'characters', 'when', 'receive', 'last', 'bits', 'final', 'seconds', 'movie', 'effect', 'least', 'staggering.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'staple', 'Atom', 'Egoyen', 'films', 'marvelous', 'accountant', 'character', 'also', 'hardest', 'figure', 'out', 'only', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'have', 'enough', 'evidence', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'able', 'understand', 'what', 'tick', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'good', 'role', 'stripper', 'club', 'who', 'very', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'account', 'Again', 'dynamics', 'connection', 'not', 'explained', 'very', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'kudos', 'most', 'impressive', 'job', 'film', 'tragically', 'underrated', 'underappreciated', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'club', 'DJ', 'estranged', 'boyfriend', 'stripper', 'most', 'films', 'Koteas', 'only', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'work', 'such', 'LIVING', 'OUT', 'LOUD', 'where', 'quot', 'kisser', 'quot', 'check', 'credits', 'character', 'name', 'man', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'very', 'briefly', 'back', 'landing', 'nightclub', 'morally', 'conflicted', 'captain', 'who', 'relieved', 'duty', 'showing', 'too', 'much', 'concern', 'well-being', 'men', 'THE', 'THIN', 'RED', 'LINE', 'EXOTICA', 'hint', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'significant', 'roles.EXOTICA', 'one', 'most', 'surreal', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'dressed', 'Catholic', 'schoolgirl', 'signing', 'American', 'Sign', 'Language', 'lyrics', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'quot', 'Everybody', 'Knows', 'quot', 'strip', 'dance', 'again', 'not', 'as', 'sexy', 'might', 'sound', '.So', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'sex', 'film', 'exceptionally', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'one', 'intricacies', 'human', 'relationships', 'closing', 'would', 'like', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'found', 'cover', 'video/DVD', 'be', 'horrid', 'seriously', 'nature', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'not', 'erotic', 'one']",Exotica VHS
