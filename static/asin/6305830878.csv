480302,A11JZYOPFMDGXW,6305830878,"A Quiet Conscience ""Q.C.""","[19, 20]","I admit I rented Bumblebee because Janeane Garafalo and Elijah Wood are in it. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was soon absorbed in the story of Barney Snow (Wood) a teenager with no memory who has agreed to participate  in experimental therapy administered by Garafalo and a group of doctors at  an Institute housing terminally ill young people. Barney is the only person  there who is not dying, but he is having haunting visions of being in a car  accident. He befriends a couple of the patients who turn out to be as  vitally important to Barney and the audience as Barney himself. We are  drawn in and held tight as this movie slowly opens doors for Barney and  reveals the truth about his past and his identity. I found the entire last  quarter of the film gripping and poignant. I am sorry I did not get to  experience this film in a theatre properly, but it translates well on video  nonetheless. It blew me away. My only complaint is Rachael Leigh Cook as  Barney's love interest and teh sister of a patient at the Institute. She  does not seem to have much to do with the story at all, which is mildly  annoying. I would have liked to see her character have more depth and  purpose especially since she interacts with Barney closely in the last half  of the film. Overall, The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is a sweet film that stays  with you long after the credits roll and I am going to purchase it as soon  as the price lowers from 100 dollars:)FYI: The title refers to the  bumblebee's ability to fly even though it should not be able to due to its  body size and tiny wing span.",4,"INtriguing, beautiful story",959990400,"06 3, 2000",2000,1589,"['admit', 'rented', 'Bumblebee', 'Janeane', 'Garafalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'are', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'soon', 'absorbed', 'story', 'Barney', 'Snow', 'Wood', 'teenager', 'memory', 'who', 'agreed', 'participate', 'experimental', 'therapy', 'administered', 'Garafalo', 'group', 'doctors', 'Institute', 'housing', 'terminally', 'ill', 'young', 'people', 'Barney', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'dying', 'having', 'haunting', 'visions', 'being', 'car', 'accident', 'couple', 'patients', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'vitally', 'important', 'Barney', 'audience', 'Barney', 'are', 'drawn', 'held', 'tight', 'movie', 'slowly', 'doors', 'Barney', 'truth', 'past', 'identity', 'found', 'entire', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'gripping', 'poignant', 'am', 'sorry', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'experience', 'film', 'theatre', 'properly', 'well', 'video', 'nonetheless', 'blew', 'away', 'only', 'complaint', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Barney', 'love', 'interest', 'teh', 'sister', 'patient', 'Institute', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'story', 'mildly', 'annoying', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'character', 'have', 'more', 'depth', 'purpose', 'especially', 'Barney', 'closely', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'Overall', 'Bumblebee', 'Flies', 'Anyway', 'sweet', 'film', 'long', 'credits', 'roll', 'am', 'going', 'purchase', 'as', 'soon', 'price', 'lowers', '100', 'dollars', 'FYI', 'title', 'refers', 'bumblebee', 'ability', 'fly', 'even', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'due', 'body', 'size', 'tiny', 'wing', 'span']",The Bumblebee Flies Anyway VHS

He has volunteered to undergo a new type of therapy that will help him rediscover his past.  You see Barney has no memories of who he is, his family or his past.  He's hoping that Dr. Harriman (aka: The Handyman) can help him in his quest.  The therapy he must undergo takes place in a hospital for terminally ill patients.  While searching for his past, he finds that his present is much more interesting.  Having been told not to consort with the terminally ill patients, Barney finds he has more in common with them than he ever could have imagined.  Helping him deal with all of this are Dr. Harriman and his newly found friends Billy, Mike, Mazzo and Cassie.Convincing performances by Elijah Wood as Barney, Janeane Garofalo as Dr. Harriman, Joseph Perrino as Mazzo, and Rachel Leigh Cook as Cassie.

It was a real disappointment to me although I love Elijah Wood's acting skills, and think Richard Cormier's books are fantastic to read.Something was amiss with this  movie - the acting other than that of Elijah Wood, Janeane Garofalo, and  the young boy in the wheelchair, was stilted - they sounded as though they  were reading, not acting.

It is still unclear to me.  Nevertheless, this movie is extremely touching, and worth watching.Barney Snow is living in a hospital for terminally ill children, but is not near death...just amnesiac.  Barney is in despair.  All he can remember is his name and a few random facts.  The film follows his journey, as he meets his fellow patients and begins unraveling the real story as to why he is the way he is.  This is a film about life: how to appreciate and hold onto it.Elijah Wood is excellent as Barney Snow, and quite reminiscent of Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker in ""Spider-Man.""  The boys who play his friends are also very good.  Rachael Leigh Cook and Janeane Garofalo's characters, however, are too stiff and one-dimensional.",4,"Somewhat confusing, but touching",1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,872,"['end', 'Bumblebee', 'Flies', 'Anyway', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'set', 'out', 'accomplish', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'still', 'unclear', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'extremely', 'touching', 'worth', 'watching.Barney', 'Snow', 'living', 'hospital', 'terminally', 'ill', 'children', 'not', 'near', 'death', 'just', 'amnesiac', 'Barney', 'despair', 'can', 'remember', 'name', 'few', 'random', 'facts', 'film', 'journey', 'fellow', 'patients', 'unraveling', 'real', 'story', 'why', 'way', 'film', 'life', 'how', 'appreciate', 'hold', 'it.Elijah', 'Wood', 'excellent', 'Barney', 'Snow', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spider-Man', 'boys', 'who', 'play', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'characters', 'however', 'are', 'too', 'stiff', 'one-dimensional']",The Bumblebee Flies Anyway VHS
