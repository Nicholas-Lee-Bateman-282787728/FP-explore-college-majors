1015154,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000HKKZQ2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","""If Hitler is dehumanized and shown only as a devil, any future Hitler may not be recognized, simply because he is a human being."" - Intro to SwastikaAdolf Hitler, the Fuhrer of Germany and the dictator who will be remembered as the evil devil incarnate of modern history which led to the death of eleven million people.Through many staged videos shot during the 1930's, the images that people have seen of Hitler was the military leader who would transformer the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship which was based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism (National Socialism which incorporated biological racism and antisemitism).But what many people have a difficult time understanding is how can millions of people follow such an evil man?  How can they look up to this person who preached hatred?Fastforward decades after World War II and the death of Adolf Hitler and his bride, Eva Braun (in April 1945, as the Red Army closed in on Berlin, Eva killed herself by biting into a cyanide capsule while Hitler shot himself in the head with a pistol).Philippe Mora and Lutz Becker had wondered about how can people follow someone like Hitler?  What kind of research material is available?  And through their research, what was found were the home videos of Adolf Hitler captured by Eva Braun.  Never touched or viewed by the American military who confiscated it.  So, this is 16 mm footage that has never been seen since they were in the possession of the Hitlers until 1973.Both Mora and Lutz found eight hours of home videos showcasing video taken by Eva Braun but also footage that no one has ever seen of Adolf Hitler before.  Away from the staged military propaganda films, Mora and Becker assembled the footage along with other historical footage to show how people of Germany fell for Hitler and why they followed him.  The power of propaganda film could help ignite the nation to back a leader, which many soldiers vowed to God to follow Hitler and his ideology.And thus ""Swastika"" was created.  A controversial documentary featuring banal home videos but showcasing a side of the evil leader among his family and friends and inter-weaved with propaganda footage as we see Hitler with Eva Braun, with children, dogs and being shown as a compassionate and beloved leader.For the film, the audio-less footage which was overdubbed (but verified by those who were featured in the film and also by German lip readers) by actors and featured music, and while the film received a tumultuous reception at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973 (to put it bluntly, a fist fight among the audience had taken place), the film was also banned in Germany for 37 years until 2010 in worries that the humanistic footage of Hitler may inspire Neo-Nazi's, nor did they want footage to be shown of a time when Germans absolute adored their ""charismatic"" leader.The film had been used as educational tools for universities as a way of understanding Nazism but also to engage viewers of why the documentary was deemed as controversial.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Swastika"" is presented in 1:33 Full Frame and in color and black and white.  As expected from a documentary featuring older footage, footage was restored back in 1973 but the fact that Eva Braun's video were not tampered with, the quality was very good considering the age of the film.  According to Lutz Becker, the film was shot using American 16mm color stock, Ektachrome.For the most part, picture quality is very good for archived and historical footage and the editing of putting together Eva Braun's home video along with propaganda and Nazi film were done well, although some may find the home videos quite banal as they are old home videos.As for audio, while the audio was dubbed by actors utilizing research by German lipreaders to people who were featured in the film, it gives you an idea of what types of conversations were being discussed on the home video.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Swastika"" comes with the following special features:Introduction from Jonathan Petropoulos - (1:58) Jonathan Petropoulos talks about how he used ""Swastika"" as a teaching tool and asking the students of why this documentary was so controversial.Filmmakers Discussion - (30:05) Producers Sanford Lieberson, David Puttnam, director/writer Philippe Mora and writer Lutz Becker talk about the making of ""Swastika"".Manipulation and Nazi Propaganda - (12:12) Producers Sanford Lieberson, David Puttnam, director/writer Philippe Mora and writer Lutz Becker talk about the propaganda documentaries at that time.Interview with Albert Speer and Lutz Becker - (14:43) In 1937, Lutz Becker was interviewed by the BBC about how he had access of Eva Braun's films and how sound was incorporated into this film.  And a discussion with Albert Speer, former photographer for Hitler on knowing Hitler and Braun.Color Film in Nazi Germany - (1:59) A special feature on the use of color in the films by Nazi Germany.Puncturing the Myth of Leni Riefenstahl - (5:53) Lutz Becker talks about actress and filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, who was known for a being a filmmaker for Hitler work but the discussion relates to how Riefenstahl may been given attribution of being a director of films that were not done by her but also showing how amoral she was with her footage taken in the concentration camps.Trailers - The theatrical trailer to ""Swastika"" and also other titles available from Kino.JUDGMENT CALL:He has been called a demon.  A murderer.  And his name will be forever linked to hatred and evil... Adolf Hitler.There is no forgiving a man who led to massive atrocities and the deaths of millions but it's important to remember that he is also human and that one human can inspire a country to do horrific things.  How is this possible?  How can this even happen?As a person who loves watching documentaries especially to see a city and lifestyle of a time period that is no more, I am also fascinated by watching footage of propaganda films that have been used to fool a country and disguising the truth of their people.""Swastika"" is rather intriguing in a historical sense because in other footage,  the most vile person of this century, Adolf Hitler, typically shown as a dictator, shown during his speeches but mostly as a military leader.  But with ""Swastika"" and the home video footage shot by Eva Braun, we see a side of Hitler that no one has seen before.We see footage of a man discussing hunting of a bore with his colleagues, the discussion with his colleagues (such as Hermann Goering and Joseph Goebbels) of the young children that look up to him as a hero, the dictator out walking his dogs and of course, his time with his Nazi soldiers and also with his mistress Eva Braun, as she stretches and has fun in the water with her dog.  Shots taken at Hitler's Bavarian mountain retreat in Berghof in Obersalzberg.But by no means was ""Swastika"" trying to show the good-side of Hitler.  The film was banned from Germany for 37-years in fear that the documentary's humanistic approach may make Hitler look like a good guy than an demon.  In fact, because of the home videos of Hitler...people were so uncomfortable at Cannes that a fight broke out in the audience.  It's a controversial film but this is an anti-Nazi film that shows how a nation was fooled by Hitler's grasp on the city.  The control that the Third Reich had in instilling this belief in men, women and children.  But a film that shows that evil tyrants are human and it's important to show how a human can lead a country to do terrible things.It's important to also note that the director, Philippe Mora is Jewish and when he took on the goal to make Swastika a film, it was during a time he wanted to document the making of Albert Speer's (a photographer for Adolf Hitler and friend of Eva Braun) book about the Third Reich.Also interesting is how the film came about.  According to various news sources, including an interview with Australia publication, ""The Age"", Mora began to become interested in the project when he saw a photo of Eva Braun in a book and she was holding a 16 mm camera.  Lutz Becker then tried to find out more information and talked to an army officer who was part of the raiding party at Berghof and was told that ""a pile of cans"" had been taken away.  Becker contacted the Pentagon and it was revealed that a bunch of film cans were found in Eva Braun's bedroom and when they received permission to look at it, there were eight hours of footage with only a fraction being used for ""Swastika"", footage featuring Adolf Hitler.  And the footage featured Hitler with Goebbels, Goering, Himmler, Heydrich, Eva and her sisters and Hitler's dog Blondi.But the question that has been raging since 1973 when it comes to ""Swastika"" was will this documentary humanize Adolf Hitler or will people see the anti-Nazi message of this film.It's one thing to have seen footage of similar situations in North Korea with the late Kim Jong-il and seeing his near rock-star presence to his countrymen, the tight grasp the country has on what their people can see on television and seeing their propaganda films that reinforce their belief in their leader, their country and their goal to have this Aryan utopia.""Swastika"" shows us along with the home video footage these other historical footage of how thousands of people were enchanted by Hitler, women going so far to jump barriers to see him.To see y0ung German soldiers making an oath to God that they will follow their leader, to see child soldiers fighting each other and then are back to marching.  To see these young women sing in glee to their leader and to see even American Olympic champion Jesse Owens smiling to the camera and talking about how great the German people are and actually praising the treatment he received during the 12th Summer Olympics in Berlin.But when you look at the history of dictators, they all have similarity in the fact that they controlled communication and people saw their leader as charismatic and wonderful.  And while the film does showcase Germans being wooed by their leader, we are also given that image of what their had lead them to do as we see images of dead Jewish people, nearly skeletal as they are being bulldozed and buried.The German people were so ignorant of what was going on around them that they were continually fed the good news about their leader and the Third Reich. One story that Philippe Mora had told was of a sculptor who worked with Hitler and when he saw the documentary, he felt everything featured in ""Swastika"" was factual until the part of the Jews being bulldozed and insisted that the video footage was constructed by Hollywood.As for the DVD release of ""Swastika"", viewers are treated with an insightful filmmakers discussion plus discussion about the manipulation of the people and the power of Nazi propaganda, classic interviews with Lutz Becker and also Albert Speer, the use of color film in Nazi Germany and also conversation of the amorality of filmmaker/actress Leni Riefenstahl who worked with Hitler.Overall, ""Swastika"" is an intriguing documentary especially with the home video footage of Hitler/Braun which I have never seen before and many others haven't.  But as far as the argument goes and the worries about whether or not this documentary will humanize Hitler, my feeling is that it's all subjective on the viewer.  This film is obviously an anti-Nazi film when watched from beginning to end but it's also a film that easily shows us that the worst in humanity can be disguised through propaganda and how many people believed in it.For those who are interested in older historical footage  of Germany especially the Nazification of the German population, will find ""Swastika"" to be a surprising and possibly disturbing documentary.",4,"""Swastika"" is a surprising and disturbing documentary",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,11812,"['Hitler', 'dehumanized', 'shown', 'only', 'devil', 'future', 'Hitler', 'may',

I am continuously fascinated that the majority of Germans could so easily fall under his spell and later buy into - so completely - his desire to rid the earth of Jewish people. And while this film doesn't shed any new light on that, it does show a side of Hitler that he kept private and actually shows that he was not a monster at all times.One scene that really hit me was when Hitler was trying to pet his beautiful German Shepherd, Blondie. They say that dogs can detect good or bad in people and to see Blondie shy away - as if she were afraid of being beaten - was really telling. &#34;Swastika&#34; isn't the film that reveals what drove Hitler, rather a film that shows him at various states out of the spotlight; in the comfort of his home or the occasional public appearance and it's really like watching a train that you know is just about to derail... you know what's coming, but there's nothing you can do to stop it and you just can't take your eyes off of it.

1015161,A2NAMBJPU6IPNW,B000HKKZQ2,Joseph Egan,"[18, 18]","This is an absolutely fascinating look at pre-war Nazi Germany.  The film attempts and I believe succeeds in allowing the viewer to experience what it was like to live in Germany prior to the Second World War.  This was before the bombings, death camps and all the horrors that are now associated with the words Nazi and Adolf Hitler.  Hitler as well as his inner circle are shown in a manner that makes them all too human and, for me; quite easy to relate to on a human level.  That alone would make the film worth watching but what I really found extremely powerful was seeing how much the German people idolized Hitler and watching it could understand why.  The film was vilified when it first opened and considered by many pro Nazi because it lets the viewer interpret this material for themselves.  This is a film that doesn't ""tell"" the viewer anything.  It is a film that makes the viewer experience something radically different and having experienced it forces them to understand exactly what they have experienced.  If you have ever asked yourself ""why Nazi Germany"", this film will set you on the road to answering that question.  In my opinion, the film's preface says everything:  ""If the human features of Hitler are lacking in the image of him that is passed onto posterity, if he is dehumanized and shown only as a devil, any future Hitler may not be recognized, simply because he is human being.""

1015162,A2BTXL0E3XE9MA,B000HKKZQ2,Juan B. Mansfield,"[3, 5]","The German Camelot of the XX Century?Disturbing  documentary.  When I saw it after dinner, it took me longer than usual to fall sleeping.  I got sort of hallucinations, nightmare.How can one conceive the Hitler we have known in so many books and in movies and films, based upon historical facts, with all the brutalities committed in occupied territories by the SS and the Wehrmacht, to have the sort of gentle, caring, completely human personality shown in Swastika. People like Bormann, Himmler, Goering, and Ribbentrop behaving all like normal and even nice people.Master of crime and propaganda like Goebbels (read the book, Symphony just to learn on how he played the game having a Jewish Symphonic orchestra until the USA entered the war when musicians were sent to concentration camps) playing with children, giving gifts and smiling, enjoying Christmas. Hitler moved by a girl crying during the commemoration of the death of his father and other participants of the September 1923 revolution fighting against Nazi opponents.  We see Hitler as Godfather in a Christian church with a tender attitude during the baptism of Goering son.  The same person that ordered the elimination of all Jews, Gypsies and all people considered sub human.  The same that ordered the massacre in Russia and the same that encouraged the final solution and the use of gas chambers, ovens, and the starvation of Jews in the concentration camps.You finally sort of realize the fact that perhaps there are so many Hitlers, Bormans,  Goerings, Himmlers and even Speers (not as a criminal but willing participant in the Rich as professional Architect and also as Manager of hard labor enterprises for the Reich war production) around ready to terminate other human beings one way or another.  All of them masters of atrocities.Some shots appear with images of starving Jew kids in Poland and the corpses of former concentration camps inmates pushed to a common hole dig in the ground by a British tractor but these are less that 10 minutes intervals in the 1 and a half hours film.If one is to summarize the film in one word, I would say controversial.One thing is true. This film should be for people exposed to WW II history mostly in books or documentaries from respected sources. Otherwise it can mislead the understanding of a dark period of the XX century.I have read many books on the subject starting when I was 20 years old with the classic Rise and Fall by William Shirer and followed by at least 20 more including visits to the British War Museum and the underground museum in Paris as well as the beaches of Normandy.  The last book read was In the Garden of Beasts written by William E. Dodd the USA Ambassador to Nazi Germany appointed by Roosevelt and the picture shown there is vivid and dramatic.  The only similitude is the air of strict military organization in cities and the cleanliness of streets and the people in the streets well dressed and healthy plus the hard working spirit in the air.Who knows, but Swatika gets close to project Hitler and friends as living in paradise with the total support of the German people.Technically is fine, excellent color considering the year when filmed, fine editing and above all the Bonus material is of top interest and very professional.  In fact I think the film without the Bonus to explain details is incomplete.  I would have preferred the introduction with less exposure of the Swastika. Too long shot and does not add value in my opinion.At the end after watching the film and bonus I closed my eyes and these question are unanswered:Were all Germans Nazis at heart?  Was it their Camelot?How do you separate fact from perception?  Were all Germans associated to this bunch of criminals because of their petit bourgeois aspirations?At the end you still wander the whys behind this film?  Reason to marketing it?  Show a friendly Nazi structure? Encourage the revival of Nazism?  Show common people becoming monsters?  Show that most Germans were happy with the regime?  Show that most Germans were also culprits of the Nazi atrocities?How did the world let that happened when there was time to stop it?  Did not the world powers realize that a monster was growing in front of their faces with a diabolic capacity to start the destruction of all we believe and replace it by a myth of blood?  Only Churchill saw what was coming but little could he do until the storm burst all over in a war that left more than 50 million people dead (military and civilians including 7 million Germans).And the most terrible question:Is that man in his 40s seating next to you in the cinema or in a restaurant or smiling to your son, daughter or grandchildren perhaps a potential criminal if given the power?How do you know who is good and how is evil in this world?",4,German Camelot?,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,4801,"['German', 'Camelot', 'XX', 'Century', 'Disturbing', 'documentary', 'When',

We will never see something similar in belief when it comes again. It's erroneous to state that he was the most evil or destructive dictator even in modern history. Stalin actually did worse but not on the epically world stage.The point is to remember that Hitler regardless of all the evil and pain he wrought on the earth as a man he was not all bad. I'm not saying that in a matter of defense for him but a fact that every man has those points which are warm and even loveable, something relatable to all. There were points of policy that were not wrong. The point it drives at is people accuse you of being an apologist if you say such things but without that very humanity and being able to have sensible points is what makes a man such as Hitler truly scary. For he appeals to that human center and heart and much as the German people said during the Holocaust was that our beloved compassionate leader could never do such things.It begins in 1933 and shows throughout how Germany appeared and was a normal beautiful life like any other nations in so many ways. Not just a deceiving picture but all enveloping reality. It takes us straight through to 1939 all the while giving us views of the German culture and society. Well giving us the private films with views of him and his conspirators relaxations and respite from the rigors of conquering Europe. Just showing us how it was all life and business as usual.I think this is very vital for students of history and for us all to remember that men commit horrible atrocities on earth.

As the movie starts you have to sit there and watch a swastika move all over the screen with this eerie music playing in the background like some 60s/70s startrek film. And then you watch all this incoherent footage. There was no meaning to it. You just sat and watch Adolf play with a dog. Then it cut to him making a speech. THen it cut to Jessee Owens in the Olympics talking on camera about how great Germany was him to. Then it cut to Adolf lounging around with some women. Then it cut to Adolf talking to some children. Then the ending (of course this had to be shoved in there) was of a bulldozer pushing bodies into a pit . . . the makers of this ""film"" would have us assume (given the hysteria built up around this man and Germany of WWII that time) these were victimized Jews. But if watch with an open mind you will see just what the prologue says--a man. Not a monster. Not a superhuman alien being with mystical powers that some would like Adolf to be . . . known as ""Hitler"" . . . like it is his first and last name . . . but you see a man. A man who looks tired in some footage. Playful in others. Soft spoken and speaking in a normal tone in speeches not screaming and foaming at the mouth like most ""historical"" footage of him and this era. You see him reciting a pledge and the German officers repeating it . . . including their allegiance to ""God"", not to the Devil as American history books would have us think. You hear the British PM talk about how England declared war ""on"" Germany for not withdrawing troops from Poland, not that Germany invaded England running all the Londerners underground like Hollywood movies would have you think. You see protestors trying to disrupt his speeches. You hear him singing/saying ""Glod Bless America"". You see aerial footage of a totally destroyed Berlin, not the partying whooping it up hey dayers that movies would have you think of Germans during this time. You see Adolf going to an art museum and attending an art parade. You hear him playing around with some women at his house talking about Clark Gable and their liking of ""Gone with the wind"". So in other words you get glimmers of who he really was, not the rotten to the core villain complete with horns coming out of his  temples and poison dripping from his veins instead of blood certain groups in the US have to make him out to be to keep their political and economic livelihoods going strong. The captions were hardly readable as they were in white and the background they were supposed to be ""commentary"" on (not labeling for) was light. But you could make enough of them to see that they were very politicized . . . one read ""Hitler's Propaganda Minister"" or something like that . . . in other words it is was his Press Secretary or the equivalent of the US Chairman of the Democratic or Republican Parties. If you watch enough of these documentaries you begin to get some semblance of what really was going on back then . . . something you don't get from the fictional Schindler's List and other dramatizations of WWII. There is a British documentary on here that showed how the concentration camps came about . . . how those were not the goal or drive of the nazis. Etc.
