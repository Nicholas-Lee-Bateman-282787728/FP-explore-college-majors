I bought  it because I am a guy who loves red heads running around ala all naturale. The main actress Danielle De Luca, who played the main character Diana, actually did a pretty good job playing the character. Everyone else did a fair to lousy job. The story is pretty simple. Not allot of gore. I thought they did end it pretty good though. If you like looking at a hot red head runnning around the country side in the nude, with a splash of vengence and cruelty thrown in for S***s and Grins, this is your kind of movie. This movie is not in the same shocking league as I Spit on Your Grave or it newer remake, much more toned down.

E Jackson,"[3, 3]","Interesting- this is supposed to be a low budget film, and yet, the quality of the story and the characters that come off quite experienced whether they actually are or not, leads me to believe this is a movie that definitely falls under the underrated category.The story is about a madman who takes naked women and makes them run naked through fields, valleys and rivers, and has a hunting game with them (by giving the women a 15 minute head start).  It's a sick, twisted game that one lady has a heck of a hard time struggling with, and thus is the focus of the storyline.  She runs from the maniac, hides, and runs some more.  Lots of action during the second half of the movie.There's some rather cruel scenes that involve young boys getting shot and killed, and I'm not particularly happy about this exceptionally graphic part of the movie, but other than that, this is a thriller that you'd never guess is considered a low budget film staring no-name actors and actresses- I don't think so.

There is a major twist in the end of the film, and again it is not as if this type of thing has not been done before, but nevertheless, the twist turns the entire movie on its head, making for an exciting conclusion.The storyline is familiar, as I said. Young girl is forced to work as a ""dancer"" to make money, falls victim to a game in which humans are hunting other humans. Young rookie cop is eager to help find the missing girl but the good 'ol boys in the police dept. are protecting the ""hunters"" and obstructing the young cop's ability to help, so he has to figure it out on his own.Even though the viewer pretty much knows all along where the film will end up in the conclusion, there are enough thrills along the way to make it worthwhile.

So I am going to try and split it up into sections.The Script: I really like the concept, which you can read about in the synopsis. Every now and then the dialogue is marred with a few unrealistic lines. It is a little slow to get going, and not enough character development because there are simply too many characters.Acting: The acting is very uneven. While most of the actors are relatively talented and believable, there are plenty of performances that felt forced. Notably the handler character that sounds like Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother Where Art Thou), but feels too contrived. Joe Mantegna is absolutely wasted. I would much rather the Deputy character be completely cut and have Mantegna have more of the focus. Like I said, too many characters result in a severe lack of character development. Danielle De Luca performed admirably and makes her character very likable.Editing: If you show me one more close-up of a deer's eye, I may have to punch you in the throat, Mr. Eberhardt. I mean that with the utmost respect, but it's cutaway shots like those that make the viewer aware of the fact they aren't watching an ""A"" movie.

Here we have a rather unusual serial killer who kidnaps strippers and prostitutes, takes them out into the New Mexico wilderness, strips them naked and let's them go with a head start so he can hunt them down. One woman ends up with a lot more wits on her than the killer expected and gives him a good run.The story is loosely based on real-life serial killer Robert Hansen, a resident in Alaska and big time game hunter who did indeed kidnap and hunt down about 20+ women throughout most of the 70s and into the early 80s before finally being caught.Productionwise, the film was done pretty cheap, looking like it was shot on video. Joe Mantegna provides the only star power in the film playing the small town sheriff investigating the disappearances of these women. But the plot does hold you pretty good and keeps your attention.

This is an old plot. One knows this (or should know this) before they engage themselves. So the idea for the writer and director is ""how can we twist this?"" What kind of spin can we put on it to keep the idea fresh. This had nothing fresh to offer.Many of the reviewers commented on how well the lead actress played her role. I found her mediocre at best. And they had her doing some things that were so stupid she should have been killed off right away. Yes I'm out in the wilderness with a high powered rifle toting psycho trying to kill me. So what do I do? I scream for help at the top of my lungs. Again, these kinds of movies rely on how the prey outsmarts the hunter and turns the tables. What she was doing was moronic. They set her up as being a bubble headed loser and she  gets lucky in a couple of instances that allow her a slight leg up on her pursuer. But then she doesn't capitalize on the situations. At one point the hunter is out cold from a rock to the head. Shouldn't she have grabbed his rifle and done him in right then and there. But nnnnooooooo....she takes off only to have him come to and start all over again. What the writer needed to do was set up a victim who actually has some real smarts to engage in a clever cat and mouse. There is no cleverness here.There isn't much budget here either and what little there is is spent on securing Joe Montegna for his role. The cinematography isn't very good. The music isn't memorable and above all the writing is tepid.

And to be quite honest, there's really not that much more necessary to describe this movie.  However...In a small New Mexico town, there is not much more than vagrants, the local police force, and a prosperous, albeit grimy strip joint (giggity).  With promises of a job that are not unlike the Russia to Europe sex trade, young girls with high hopes and incredible navety make their way to BFE, New Mexico to learn that they are now trapped (read: enslaved) as strippers, and their only way out is to earn restitution for travel expenses incurred.  Unfortunately for the new strippers, there's a sociopath on the loose who enjoys hunting the most dangerous game.Enter red-hot redhead Diana (Danielle De Luca), who traveled from Texas after winning some drunken wet t-shirt contest at a hometown pub.  With nowhere to turn, she falls into the precarious situation of owing the strip club management.  And now the tables are set.Overall, this is a very enjoyable.  The scenery is amazing, the cast believable.  There's even an extended scene in which Diana is running nude (sorry, no slow-mo) for about 15 minutes.  Being that it's not a top-notch thriller, there are several scenes which require incredible suspension of disbelief (i.e. ridiculous decisions made by the victim), but overall it's not a terrible hindrance.  The one major downfall to this movie is the ending.  Sometimes being clever is a good thing, and at other times it's alright to stick to the formula that works.

Garfield) preys on strippers and prostitutes whom he hunts in the wilds of New Mexico after first drugging them and setting them free, utterly naked and defenseless.Joe Mantegna, the only star power in the film, plays a curiously obtuse small-town sheriff. Aware of illegalities in the local strip club, and bedeviled by a lengthy ""missing persons"" caseload comprised entirely of young, pretty girls, albeit strippers and prostitutes, he refuses to put 2 and 2 together, does nothing, and is apparently more concerned with angering the oddly popular weirdoes in his town, than in solving crimes.Diana (DeLuca) is an innocent girl from Texas who takes up a benefactor's offer to work, good money guaranteed, in that same small town in New Mexico. When she arrives, she's put up in a flyblown motel with a heroin addict for a roommate. She's then told that she's expected to work as a stripper, obligated to pay back the money laid out for her travel expenses, food, and lodging, ""plus interest . . . and it compounds,"" as she is told by her sneering benefactor-turned-slavemaster, who takes most of the money she earns. When she complains, he tells her to ""lose the thong,"" which she does, only to be heavily fined by the club owner, who is complicit in the enslavement scheme. With no money to give her ""benefactor"" that night, he threatens her, but then suggests she privately ""entertain"" a few customers. Desperate to escape what is obviously a horrible and never-ending situation, Diana agrees. Spotted by the trolling Mandel, she agrees to have sex for money but then tries to put him off, only to belatedly discover she is more a prisoner than ever. Mandel, armed with rifle and crossbow, would seem to have all the advantages.DeLuca, a staple of recent ""B"" slasher films, is pretty and vivacious, and utterly convincing as the bewildered Diana. DeLuca carries a large portion of this film on her petite shoulders by her lonesome and in the altogether nude, playing the hungry, bruised, dirty and terrorized Diana with a realism that is disturbing to watch.NAKED FEAR is a gem of its genre, and is well worth the 90 minutes you will give to it.",4,"""It's different than I expected.""",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,2528,"['things', '-including', 'low', 'budget', 'shot', 'video', 'quality', 'direct-to-dvd', 'release', 'cast', 'unknowns', '-considered', 'NAKED', 'FEAR', 'far', 'better', 'be', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'actress', 'Danielle', 'DeLuca', 'storyline', 'based', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'Robert', 'Hansen.Like', 'Hansen', 'who', 'operated', 'Alaskan', 'outback', 'fictional', 'Colin', 'Mandel', 'J.D', 'Garfield', 'preys', 'strippers', 'prostitutes', 'whom', 'wilds', 'New', 'Mexico', 'first', 'drugging', 'setting', 'free', 'utterly', 'naked', 'defenseless.Joe', 'Mantegna', 'only', 'star', 'power', 'film', 'curiously', 'small-town', 'sheriff', 'Aware', 'illegalities', 'local', 'strip', 'club', 'bedeviled', 'lengthy', 'missing', 'persons', 'caseload', 'comprised', 'entirely', 'young', 'pretty', 'girls', 'strippers', 'prostitutes', 'put', '2', '2', 'together', 'nothing', 'apparently', 'more', 'concerned', 'angering', 'oddly', 'popular', 'weirdoes', 'town', 'solving', 'crimes.Diana', 'DeLuca', 'innocent', 'girl', 'Texas', 'who', 'up', 'benefactor', 'offer', 'work', 'good', 'money', 'guaranteed', 'same', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'Mexico', 'When', 'put', 'up', 'flyblown', 'motel', 'heroin', 'addict', 'roommate', 'then', 'told', 'expected', 'work', 'stripper', 'obligated', 'pay', 'back', 'money', 'laid', 'out', 'travel', 'expenses', 'food', 'lodging', 'interest', 'told', 'sneering', 'benefactor-turned-slavemaster', 'who', 'most', 'money', 'When', 'lose', 'thong', 'only', 'be', 'heavily', 'fined', 'club', 'owner', 'who', 'complicit', 'enslavement', 'scheme', 'money', 'give', 'benefactor', 'night', 'then', 'privately', 'entertain', 'few', 'customers', 'Desperate', 'escape', 'what', 'obviously', 'horrible', 'never-ending', 'situation', 'Diana', 'Spotted', 'trolling', 'Mandel', 'have', 'sex', 'money', 'then', 'put', 'off', 'only', 'belatedly', 'discover', 'more', 'prisoner', 'ever', 'Mandel', 'armed', 'rifle', 'crossbow', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'advantages.DeLuca', 'staple', 'recent', 'B', 'slasher', 'films', 'pretty', 'vivacious', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'bewildered', 'Diana', 'DeLuca', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'petite', 'shoulders', 'lonesome', 'altogether', 'nude', 'playing', 'hungry', 'bruised', 'dirty', 'terrorized', 'Diana', 'realism', 'disturbing', 'watch.NAKED', 'FEAR', 'gem', 'genre', 'well', '90', 'minutes', 'will', 'give']",N/A

That's it in a nutshell.I'm going to burn in Hell because I enjoyed this movie......at least the parts I didn't fast forward through.In the days of drive-ins, this would have been the second feature shown.  It is the ""make-out"" movie of your Saturday drive-in date.Okay, let's talk 'not PC'.  The plot of the movie amounts to 'young woman with a troubled home life takes a job offer without realizing what the job entails.  A male predator pays to get her out to a small town and then sells her to a strip joint.  In order to pay back the pimp-wannabe for the advace money, she has to go along with stripping and may have to eventually turn tricks.  Now mix in a hunter who favorite prey has become naked strippers.'  Voila, the plot of the movie.During the last quarter of the movie, the director makes a feeble attempt to justify all the exploitation by throwing in a couple of extra killings (male this time), allowing the girl her revenge and then lets her go vigilante.  To restate, this is all just an attempt to justify and legitimize the plot which is merely a vehicle that allows the filming of a pretty woman running around naked. The plot could just as well have been 'pretty girl joins deer herd and runs around naked'.  Same result, practically the same movie.For the right set of viewers (i.e. those viewers needing a female nudity fix), this is the movie to choose. The movie's 'Naked Prey' is a very pretty woman. Otherwise, unless you are a collector of exploitation films or bad movies like I am, watch but don't buy.Depending on how much you 'read' into the movie, there is a small to moderate amount of parallelism to this movie and 'I Spit on Your Grave'. The abundant nudity, the chase scene and the revenge are reminiscent of 'I Spit on Your Grave'.  However in Naked Fear, there are no visual rape scenes.  The movie implies that the the screaming and begging you hear off camera while a locked door is being filmed amounts to torture of the female victim.  Torture that amounts to maiming the victim inorder to make for an easier hunt.
