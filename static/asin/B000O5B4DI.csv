I saw it years ago in theatre and finally found it here, bought it,mshared it. Nothing to deep but just nice. Fine for kids who may want a break from violence.

1062452,A6U4PGBCIXF2H,B000O5B4DI,"pemory ""pemory""","[0, 0]","I purchased a copy of this film based-upon the positively glowing reviews I read here as well as some additional commentary comparing this to the work of Bill Forsyth. While this film tries very hard to be whimsical, it really, really stretches credibility (you have to suspend your disbelief to its utmost to buy-in to the story) and lacks the cohesion, character-development, magic, and soul (not to mention inspired direction and top-notch acting) found in Forsyth's Scottish films of the early 1980s. Certainly the cinematography of the sublime Scottish countryside is wonderful and the film has its heart in the right place, but to be asked to accept that nearly everyone in Edinburgh is aware of the robbers' identity (even a band of kids) while the bumbling police can't figure it out or that a group of Japanese journalists can somehow catch-up with the on-the-run crooks while the cops cannot makes the film too slight and way too silly. If you're a fan of the band Big Country, you'll no doubt want to take a look at this since they composed the soundtrack, but otherwise, if you're looking for a long-lost gem you won't discover it here unless you're okay with a plot that requires you to ditch all sense of reality. Stick with the real thing and get a copy of Forsyth'sLocal Hero (1983)orComfort & Joy [VHS] instead.",2,A dissenting opinion,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,1328,"['purchased', 'copy', 'film', 'positively', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'read', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'additional', 'commentary', 'comparing', 'work', 'Bill', 'Forsyth', 'film', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'whimsical', 'really', 'really', 'credibility', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'utmost', 'buy-in', 'story', 'cohesion', 'character-development', 'magic', 'soul', 'not', 'mention', 'inspired', 'direction', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'found', 'Forsyth', 'Scottish', 'films', 'early', '1980s', 'Certainly', 'cinematography', 'sublime', 'Scottish', 'countryside', 'wonderful', 'film', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'be', 'asked', 'accept', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Edinburgh', 'aware', 'robbers', 'identity', 'even', 'band', 'kids', 'bumbling', 'police', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'group', 'Japanese', 'journalists', 'can', 'somehow', 'catch-up', 'on-the-run', 'crooks', 'cops', 'can', 'not', 'film', 'too', 'slight', 'way', 'too', 'silly', ""'re"", 'fan', 'band', 'Big', 'Country', ""'ll"", 'doubt', 'want', 'take', 'look', 'composed', 'soundtrack', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'looking', 'long-lost', 'gem', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discover', 'here', ""'re"", 'okay', 'plot', 'ditch', 'sense', 'reality', 'Stick', 'real', 'thing', 'get', 'copy', ""Forsyth'sLocal"", 'Hero', '1983', 'orComfort', 'Joy', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'instead']",Restless Natives

I had to see it twice because of the accents (did he say ""clown"" or did he say ""clone""?). I later made a tape of it when it was shown on cable and I was elated to find it out on DVD.The movie is still a visual two thumbs up and the soundtrack (by Big Country) still kicks [...]. But if you are looking for a laugh so hard that your sides hurt kinda movie, this isn't it. As for the plot, it works.
