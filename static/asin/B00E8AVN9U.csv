If not, and if the four TV movies are not included (and it would be stupid not to include them), then I will not bother purchasing this set as I already own all twelve individual seasons and the four-movie set.(Incidentally, the five-star rating is for the shows themselves, as well as for my deep and abiding love for the divine Angela Lansbury.)",5,Truly complete???,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,815,"['Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'set', 'will', 'be', '*TRULY', 'COMPLETE*', 'will', 'include', 'four', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'followed', 'series', 'Also', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'released', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'undoubtedly', 'save', 'money', 'were', 'technical', 'problems', 'discs', 'froze', 'middle', 'several', 'episodes', 'would', 'not', 'continue', 'playing', 'Have', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'been', 'remastered', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'single-sided', 'discs', 'not', 'four', 'TV', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'not', 'include', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'bother', 'purchasing', 'set', 'already', 'own', 'twelve', 'individual', 'seasons', 'four-movie', 'set', 'Incidentally', 'five-star', 'rating', 'shows', 'as', 'well', 'deep', 'abiding', 'love', 'divine', 'Angela', 'Lansbury']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete Series"

This complete set is exactly what you want if you are a fan of the series.DiscsThis set itself contains only the single sided discs. This is fantastic if you consider the fact that many movies/shows suffer from poorly created double sided discs.The entire set has 63 discs containing 263 episodes. That is quite a lot of crime solvingPackagingThis packaging is very slim. The entire set takes up about as much space as the first four individual seasons.Do you need this?If you are in the market for some Angela Landsbury goodness then you should consider your options. If you have none of the previous seasons then you probably want this complete set. It will definitely be your best deal. If you own some or most of the individual seasons you might want to just update the single seasons that have the higher quality discs. This may be a more cost effective measure.ExtrasYou won't find any extras that weren't already present in previous sets. This is nice of them seeing as how completion it's won't be pressured into buying this fir added content.Unfortunately, you won't be getting the TV movies that were created. This is a small complaint as they can easily be purchased separately.The extras includeThe Great 80s Flashback; Origin of a Series; Recipe for a Hit; America's Top Sleuths; The Perils of Success, and the Magnum, P.I. crossover episode.This is a great set and if you are considering purchasing it I don't think that you will be disappointed.

Since I think at least one murder occurred in every episode, that's one a heck of a lot of murders. I was always amazed that every place Jessica ever went, another murder occurred, and many of them right there in her own small town of Cabot Cove, Maine. That place must have been the murder capital of the world. I certainly wouldn't want to be around Jessica for very long or I just might have turned up dead. Even though this TV series is still on TV in reruns, we still watch it every day it's on. We truly love it. I'm sure we've probably seen every episode numerous times but we still enjoy watching each one of them.

I was one of those people who purchased all of the individual sets as they came out but I knew if there was ever a day where a complete set came out I'd get it. The series itself is timeless. I used to watch this series with my Grandmother back when it originally aired on CBS. I loved it then and I love it now!As for the Complete set itself. It's beautifully put together. All 12 seasons are up together in a box that is just the right size for my book shelves. The box set has the slimmer DVD packages rather than the bulky sets when the series was originally put out on DVD. One thing I really like is that there are no double sided DVD's in this set! This is a major improvement from the first 3 seasons put out years ago where they were double sided and I would have some digital issues from time to time with those sets. So again...I love this set!!!Some have complained about the movies not being included in the set. I'm personally OK with this. The movies had a different feel from the series and it really doesn't bother me to have the movies in a separate case.So...should you get this set? I say if you are a MSW fan...then yes. It's smaller and it's a quality set! And the price isn't extremely bad either compared to other complete series.",5,Love this set!,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1335,"['Received', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Complete', 'Series', 'yesterday', 'love', 'set', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'purchased', 'individual', 'sets', 'came', 'out', 'knew', 'was', 'ever', 'day', 'where', 'complete', 'set', 'came', 'out', ""'d"", 'get', 'series', 'timeless', 'used', 'watch', 'series', 'Grandmother', 'back', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'CBS', 'loved', 'then', 'love', 'now', 'Complete', 'set', 'beautifully', 'put', 'together', '12', 'seasons', 'are', 'up', 'together', 'box', 'just', 'right', 'size', 'book', 'shelves', 'box', 'set', 'slimmer', 'DVD', 'rather', 'bulky', 'sets', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'like', 'are', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'set', 'major', 'improvement', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'put', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'where', 'were', 'double', 'sided', 'would', 'have', 'digital', 'issues', 'time', 'time', 'sets', 'So', 'again', 'love', 'set', 'have', 'complained', 'movies', 'not', 'being', 'included', 'set', ""'m"", 'personally', 'OK', 'movies', 'had', 'different', 'feel', 'series', 'really', ""n't"", 'bother', 'have', 'movies', 'separate', 'case.So', 'should', 'get', 'set', 'say', 'are', 'MSW', 'fan', 'then', 'yes', 'smaller', 'quality', 'set', 'price', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'bad', 'either', 'compared', 'other', 'complete', 'series']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete Series"

Though, with this set, (which I won't get until Christmas) I won't have to do that anymore. The individual sets, aside from the packaging, are the same as the set that came out a few years ago. The only real difference is the first 3 seasons are now on single sided discs. Luckily, I only had the first season.
