This one is very good with scripture quotation and a reverent attitude toward Jesus Christ.  The title refers to the personal decision every person must make to receive Christ.  The story is about a mother and son grieving over the loss of the husband in the family with a sub plot of forgiveness between family members.  If you like Christian movies, give this one a try.
