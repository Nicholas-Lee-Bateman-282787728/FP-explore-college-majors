It wasn't that I wasn't interested in his story -- quite the contrary, as I've seen quite a few documentaries on it as a matter of fact -- it was just that I thought he would have been better served working with a professional writer to tell his tale.  The story then surely would have been more polished.I think that a lot of people know about Mr. Schiller's story, and I think that a lot of people feel his pain.  That's all well and good; he was treated like a POW victim by his captors.  But I believe that those same people perhaps became a little too personally attached to the story, and probably those same people saw this film and panned it.Like I've said a million times before, books and film are different media.  And this same story was told by different writers of those media in different ways.  Here, the screenwriter decided to use levity, and to go in a more satirical direction with the story than the book.  I think that that's OK, even though I can understand if Mr. Schiller isn't too happy about the film.  (Peeking around the web I believe that there are lawsuits attached to this film, due to story ownership.  Stay tuned on that.)But I was pretty happy when I saw that this was available for free with Amazon Prime.  I've wanted to watch it for quite a while, and I jumped at the chance.  This film is ridiculous, but it's supposed to be; some of the humor is pretty top notch.  I laughed my head off when Ken Jeong, playing someone named Johnny Woo, was giving his ""Get Rich Quick"" seminar.  In particular, the ""Everyone is either a doer or a don'ter"" line killed me.  By the way:  did I spell ""don'ter"" right?  Well, no matter either way.  I started thinking about it, and from what I remember, seminars were really popular during the timeframe of this story so it made the scene even funnier.  And I've always thought seminars are ridiculous myself, but not ridiculous in a good way, like this film.It's unfortunate that Mr. Schiller was more than thrown under the bus by his captors.  But I also think that it's unfortunate that Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson -- who is terrific here, by the way -- and the rest of this fine cast, were also thrown under the bus by critics for making this film, mostly for what I believe to be political reasons rather than artistic reasons.If you can separate yourself from the actual story and understand that this is meant to be satire, then you should like it.  If you can't?  Well, go read a book.

1629597,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYLO8,C. Sawin,"[5, 8]","Throughout most of his career, director Michael Bay has released blockbuster films every other year that always seem to destroy the box office and take a piece of your soul whenever you willingly pay for one since it's a proven fact that watching a Michael Bay film is like staring into the eyes of Satan himself. ""Pain & Gain"" is Bay's smallest film since ""Bad Boys"" and his first film that wasn't part of the ""Transformers"" franchise since ""The Island"" way back in 2005. Not only does ""Pain & Gain"" only have one explosion in its entire 130-minute duration, but it may actually be Bay's most entertaining and amusing film to date or at least his best since ""The Rock.""Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is an ex-con who gets a second chance as the manager of Sun Gym. Despite making the gym he works at extremely profitable, Daniel finds himself dreaming of a bigger and more luxurious lifestyle yet doesn't have the proper skill set or patience to even attempt approaching that the honest way. He gets an extremely wealthy client named Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) who has worked very hard to get where he is today, but is also a self centered prick. Daniel decides that he'd be doing the country a favor if he stole Victor's lifestyle from him and comes up with a kidnapping scheme that would result in Victor signing all of his money and assets over. He brings in his best friend Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and a fresh out of prison religious meathead named Paul (Dwayne Johnson) with the idea that no one will get hurt and they'll be living the high life in a matter of days. After they get what they're after, Daniel, Adrian, and Paul's newfound fortune is short-lived thanks to the amount of loose ends that they leave.The film takes place during a six month period between October 1994 and June 1995 in Miami. It is literally jam packed with some of the most ridiculous things you've ever heard anyone say in a film, but it's completely believeable since these guys aren't very bright and basically put all their efforts into weightlifting. Anthony Mackie's tangent about breast milk at the strip club is downright hysterical. One of the cool things about ""Pain & Gain"" is that nearly everyone gets to jump in on the narrative at one point or another. While it's typically Daniel telling the story, Adrian, Paul, retired private detective Ed (Ed Harris), and even the stripper Sorina (Bar Paly) get to tell the events from their perspective or at least give details of their back story.Slow-motion seems to be utilized in a not so serious way. During the film's opening, Daniel is running from the cops. As the SWAT team jumps out of a van, all of their movements are slowed down while Daniel is shown sprinting at full speed before eventually slowing down and making a bunch of goofy facial expressions. Victor getting a taser shot to the side of the temple is the most memorable use of the effect since the one shot seems to last an eternity. This is the best role of Dwayne Johnson's career. The Paul Doyle character is really complex. While he has his demons, he seems to try so hard to be a good person and on top of that is a religious man who's sober. Not only is Paul funny (""I am blessed with many gifts and one of them is knocking you the @#$% out!""), but he's an emotional carousel as the way he feels always seems to send the character spiraling out of control and Johnson does an extraordinary job with the role.Bay recycles the rotating room to room sequence that he used in ""Bad Boys II"" and this is the second big film this year that Dwayne Johnson has been shot at while being underwater.

1629600,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00BEIYLO8,DanD,"[3, 5]","Let's get this straight: this movie is based on a true story.  I'm not sure how accurately (I'm guessing not very), but yes, this actually happened: a ""gang"" of bodybuilders decides to kidnap and torture a businessman, solely because he's a jerk and they feel entitled to some of his money.  Apparently, someone in Hollywood heard this story and thought, ""Hey, that'd make a great movie, but let's make the kidnappers the good guys and the victim the bad guy.""There's no ironic tongue-in-cheek, Coen Brothers shtick going on here.  Oh, Michael Bay attempts it; he's going for Coen cold, but at his BEST, he's hitting LADY KILLERS (more on that in a minute), and straying far from FARGO or BURN AFTER READING.  In fact, he's not even in the same ballpark.  There's no, ""Take it with a grain of salt.""  You can't even fall back on this just being fiction.  You're actually supposed to root for these lunkheads, because they're ""everymen"" and they only want ""a better life"" (which involves driving over an innocent guy's face with a truck).  As the lead, Mark Wahlberg seems to be in an entirely different movie.  It's not his fault; he's given some awkward performances, but he's given us enough gold to tell when he's trying, and when he's struggling with the material.  Ed Harris gives a reliably solid late-act supporting turn, and Tony Shalhoub does his Tony Shalhoub thing.Where the movie almost hits its stride is with Dwayne Johnson.  His born-again murderous thug Paul Doyle is totally out of place with the rest of the film; what the writers got wrong everywhere else, they got right with Doyle, and Johnson has the comedic timing to pull off the part.  That being said...how sad is it that the best thing about your film is The Rock?  This is the first movie that truly offended me, in its utter ignorance and desire to pander to baser instincts (and this is coming from a guy who thinks the SCARY MOVIE franchise is still entertaining).  I can truly say I wish I hadn't seen this movie.  But then again...there's a lesson in how NOT to make a movie here.  Bay isn't necessarily a bad filmmaker; he's given us some great pieces of modern shlock entertainment, which critics dismiss but in reality serves a real purpose.  But Bay is trying to pull off a semi-Oscar hat trick here; he's walking into Coen territory and finding out he's floundering in the deep end of the pool.  The film is sexist; the film presents us with gratuitous violence because the filmmakers feel the audience is dumb enough to buy it.  I won't say PAIN & GAIN is a total waste of time; that's a highly subjective stance (even more so than, say, an online review).  But I can tell you straight up that I wish I hadn't seen it.  I can also point out that, in 15 years, this is only the second one-star review I've given.

Her answer was startling! She was surprised by how much Americans idealize criminals! I hope after people watch Pain & Gain that will no longer be true!Keep in mind Pain & Gain is a true story, which makes it extraordinarily disturbing! Anyone reading this film review may someday, unwittingly, cross paths with people who are as evil and ruthless as the three men in this story are. It's a cautionary tale for us all! One bad guy is charming. One is a bit simple-minded and the other is so ordinary he could easily be your next door neighbor. But they all have one thing in common: They are incredibly selfish and if you get in their way, they are going to kill you.I have lived in both South Florida and Connecticut and I've seen plenty of snotty rich people who are full of themselves and flaunt their wealth. But does that justify stealing from them and killing them? Two of these three men had steady employment at a half decent job, and they are certainly not starving! What could possibly drive them to such incredible acts of depravity and insanity?The answer is simple! All three of these thugs wanted wealth and to some degree a glamorous lifestyle. Isn't that what advertising and the rest of the media constantly tells us: We can't be satisfied until were are all both rich and glamorous? That if you're not at least Upper Middle Class, you're some sort of loser or failure?I was once an Catholic altar boy and I used to attend many Baptisms. There was one question the priest always asks the Godparents that stuck in my mind: ""Priest: Do you reject the glamour of evil and refuse to be mastered by sin?"" I could never totally understand what the ""glamour of evil"" meant. How can evil possibly be glamorous? Pain & Gain makes you realize how seductive and glamorous evil can be for anyone who, ironically, is not a strong person!See:23 Things They Don't Tell You About CapitalismandDangerous Liaisons: How to Recognize and Escape from Psychopathic Seduction",5,A Sobering Tale About Psychopathic Behavior and Depraved Capitalism!,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,2138,"['Many', 'years', 'asked', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'culture', 'What', 'single', 'biggest', 'difference', 'culture', 'American', 'culture', 'answer', 'was', 'startling', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'Americans', 'idealize', 'criminals', 'hope', 'people', 'watch', 'Pain', 'Gain', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'true', 'Keep', 'mind', 'Pain', 'Gain', 'true', 'story', 'extraordinarily', 'disturbing', 'Anyone', 'reading', 'film', 'review', 'may', 'someday', 'unwittingly', 'cross', 'paths', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'evil', 'ruthless', 'three', 'men', 'story', 'are', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'One', 'bad', 'guy', 'charming', 'One', 'bit', 'simple-minded', 'other', 'so', 'ordinary', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'are', 'incredibly', 'selfish', 'get', 'way', 'are', 'going', 'kill', 'you.I', 'have', 'lived', 'South', 'Florida', 'Connecticut', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'snotty', 'rich', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'full', 'flaunt', 'wealth', 'justify', 'stealing', 'killing', 'Two', 'three', 'men', 'had', 'steady', 'employment', 'half', 'decent', 'job', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'starving', 'What', 'could', 'possibly', 'drive', 'such', 'incredible', 'acts', 'depravity', 'insanity', 'answer', 'simple', 'three', 'thugs', 'wanted', 'wealth', 'degree', 'glamorous', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'what', 'advertising', 'rest', 'media', 'constantly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'satisfied', 'were', 'are', 'rich', 'glamorous', ""'re"", 'not', 'least', 'Upper', 'Middle', 'Class', ""'re"", 'sort', 'loser', 'failure', 'was', 'once', 'Catholic', 'altar', 'boy', 'used', 'attend', 'many', 'Baptisms', 'was', 'one', 'question', 'priest', 'always', 'Godparents', 'stuck', 'mind', 'Priest', 'Do', 'reject', 'glamour', 'evil', 'refuse', 'be', 'mastered', 'sin', 'could', 'never', 'totally', 'understand', 'what', 'glamour', 'evil', 'meant', 'How', 'can', 'evil', 'possibly', 'be', 'glamorous', 'Pain', 'Gain', 'realize', 'how', 'seductive', 'glamorous', 'evil', 'can', 'be', 'anyone', 'who', 'ironically', 'not', 'strong', 'person', 'See:23', 'Things', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'CapitalismandDangerous', 'Liaisons', 'How', 'Recognize', 'Escape', 'Psychopathic', 'Seduction']",N/A

Even if the pool was empty, they'd still be drowning in stupid.  And you gotta give Florida credit; NO one does crazy like Florida.Mark Wahlberg as Chief Crazy in Charge just nailed it.  If you loved Wahlberg in The Other Guys, he brings the funny here too, while still playing the positive-thinking psycho-killer.  Even rewound a couple times just to watch his face as he ripped some major snappy dialogue.  Part of what makes Wahlberg funny is his flow and patience to wait for *just* the right beat to make his move.  He doesn't tell jokes or do schtick, thank god.  He just convinces us he's completely unaware that what he's saying is hilarious.Anthony Mackie brings his own special crazy, especially at the strip-club bar when he's tripping on just how big he's gonna get in that gym:  Ima get SWOLE!  Ima have to turn SIDEways and shiat just to walk through tha door!!.  Because Dwayne Johnson played the guy who was Christian with still a tiny bit of conscience while snorting dumpsters full of coke, he had to tone down his funny from what we saw in The Other Guys, and only once do we get to see him do that blazing adorable full-faced smile of his.Of special note is Emily Rutherfurd who all-too-briefly played Ed Harris' wife.  That kind of wicked-smart and wicked-cool makes her wicked-funny.  We desperately need more nuanced female roles like this and the actresses who can handle it.  Ken Jeong as the slimy, cliched motivational speaker was the perfect choice.

Doyle, the most interesting of the three characters, is a fictional composite of people who had much smaller roles in the crime spree than Lugo and Adriane,  and liberties are taken with characterizations of victims and the details. True-crime buffs who want to know more should read one of the excellent books out there for the complete story. Also, Pain and Gain true story? is a good blog that quickly outlines what parts of the movie did and did not really happen.That aside, looking at this as purely for its entertainment value, it is a fast paced film with a captivating, twisted story line that is not for the squeamish.I love both Rebel Wilson and Ken Jeong and like a smart, dark comedy. However, I found the casting of these two comedians in this movie (as well as some of the sight-gags) to be a distraction. They are more laugh out loud funny and didn't mesh well into this dark tale.At the end the narrator explains to us that our take away is to appreciate what we have. I've also heard Michael Bay in interviews say that's what he was going for. I didn't see it. Really what did these criminals have of real worth to begin with? I'd say the message is even for shallow, dissatisfied, and self-absorbed people - money doesn't insure happiness and ill-gained money comes with lots of complications. So even though it pretty much sucks, stick with your pathetic little existence.My guess is that mainstream audiences will find this movie uncomfortable and that it will be in and out of theaters pretty quickly, but will find a niche market on DVD.",3,It was hard to laugh - so messed up,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,1824,"['was', 'hard', 'laugh', 'so', 'messed', 'up', 'was', 'how', 'couple', 'front', 'aptly', 'put', 'were', 'leaving', 'theater.This', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'claim', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'actual', 'criminal', 'events', 'true', 'story', 'stretch', 'Doyle', 'most', 'interesting', 'three', 'characters', 'fictional', 'composite', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'much', 'smaller', 'roles', 'crime', 'spree', 'Lugo', 'Adriane', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'characterizations', 'victims', 'details', 'True-crime', 'buffs', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'should', 'read', 'one', 'excellent', 'books', 'there', 'complete', 'story', 'Also', 'Pain', 'Gain', 'true', 'story', 'good', 'blog', 'quickly', 'what', 'parts', 'movie', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'happen.That', 'aside', 'looking', 'purely', 'entertainment', 'value', 'fast', 'paced', 'film', 'captivating', 'twisted', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'squeamish.I', 'love', 'Rebel', 'Wilson', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'smart', 'dark', 'comedy', 'However', 'found', 'casting', 'two', 'comedians', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'sight-gags', 'be', 'distraction', 'are', 'more', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'dark', 'end', 'narrator', 'take', 'away', 'appreciate', 'what', 'have', ""'ve"", 'also', 'heard', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'interviews', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Really', 'what', 'did', 'criminals', 'have', 'real', 'worth', 'begin', ""'d"", 'say', 'message', 'even', 'shallow', 'dissatisfied', 'self-absorbed', 'people', 'money', ""n't"", 'insure', 'happiness', 'ill-gained', 'money', 'lots', 'complications', 'So', 'even', 'pretty', 'much', 'sucks', 'stick', 'pathetic', 'little', 'existence.My', 'guess', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'uncomfortable', 'will', 'be', 'theaters', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'will', 'find', 'niche', 'market', 'DVD']",N/A

did he really scam a christian gun salesman, or punch out a kidnap victim, or barbecue severed hands to eliminate fingerprints? we can't be sure. a secondary problem is that the movie is over two hours long: it's asking a lot from one liners and snappy visuals to sustain a viewer's interest that long, but a lot of the length is in jokes that are entirely expendable. for example: the three minute scene in the strip joint, where mackie extols the virtues of a ""steroid milkshake"" (breast milk and HGH) is funny, i guess, but really who cares?fictional elements usually give a director the freedom to shape the story in pursuit of a coherent interpretation or style ... but there is quite a lot of graphic gore and human pain, including torture and two clumsy murders, that knock the style off kilter. it's possible to present murder as comedy in a film -- see kubrick's ""lolita"" or the coen's ""blood simple"", for example -- but the violence shown here breaks through the comic pretense and is frankly disturbing. the scene where johnson punches out inmates in a prison yard is funny; the scene where he runs over a kidnap victim with a van is not. the characters morph from comically shallow and grandiose to pathetically sadistic and greedy ... and you can't, in a single film, have it both ways. once we're put on our guard as to whether it's ""OK"" to laugh or not, the film loses its ability to draw us into its world. we're just gawkers at gore and grief and embarrassed that we ever thought it was something to laugh at.",3,a mixed bag of unmixable tricks,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,3048,"['movie', 'fundamentally', 'botched', 'job', 'middling', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'compromise', 'five', 'star', 'visuals', 'acting', 'one', 'star', 'directorial', 'stance', 'subject.taken', 'movie', 'clowns', 'three', 'clowns', 'center', 'narrative', 'pain', 'gain', 'zesty', 'often', 'flat', 'out', 'hilarious', 'true', 'story', 'flabbergasting', 'piece', 'cinema', 'tony', 'scott', 'script', 'camera', 'editing', 'postprocessing', 'tricks', 'domino', 'create', 'snappy', 'saturated', 'hectic', 'storytelling', 'style', 'full', 'flashbacks', 'presentation', 'monologues', 'four', 'pivotal', 'actors', 'wahlberg', 'jackie', 'johnson', 'shaloub', 'deliver', 'deadpan', 'very', 'funny', 'characterizations', 'stupid', 'people', 'striving', 'stupid', 'values', 'script', 'full', 'rapid', 'fire', 'comic', 'one', 'liners', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lots', 'movies', 'i', 'know', 'what', 'i', ""'m"", 'doing.', 'wahlberg', 'invested', 'lot', 'sweat', 'pumping', 'steroid', 'dimensions', 'dwayne', 'johnson', 'are', 'skilled', 'comedians', 'rebel', 'wilson', 'ed', 'harris', 'stand', 'out', 'secondary', 'roles.the', 'problems', 'arise', 'script', 'treatment', 'script', 'supposedly', 'true', 'story', 'tick', 'toc', 'date', 'time', 'stamps', 'subtitle', 'still', 'true', 'story', 'script', 'fictional', 'composite', 'character', 'played', 'johnson', 'have', 'were', 'two', 'real', 'people', 'conspiring', 'crimes', 'imaginary', 'playmate', 'was', 'anyone', 'involved', 'plot', 'who', 'was', 'jesus', 'freak', 'punched', 'out', 'priest', 'lost', 'toe', 'botched', 'robbery', 'did', 'really', 'scam', 'christian', 'gun', 'salesman', 'punch', 'out', 'kidnap', 'victim', 'barbecue', 'severed', 'hands', 'eliminate', 'fingerprints', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'secondary', 'problem', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'asking', 'lot', 'one', 'liners', 'snappy', 'visuals', 'sustain', 'viewer', 'interest', 'long', 'lot', 'length', 'jokes', 'are', 'entirely', 'expendable', 'example', 'three', 'minute', 'scene', 'strip', 'joint', 'where', 'mackie', 'virtues', 'steroid', 'milkshake', 'breast', 'milk', 'HGH', 'funny', 'i', 'guess', 'really', 'who', 'fictional', 'elements', 'usually', 'give', 'director', 'freedom', 'shape', 'story', 'pursuit', 'coherent', 'interpretation', 'style', 'quite', 'lot', 'graphic', 'gore', 'human', 'pain', 'including', 'torture', 'two', 'clumsy', 'murders', 'style', 'kilter', 'possible', 'present', 'murder', 'comedy', 'film', 'see', 'kubrick', 'lolita', 'coen', 'blood', 'simple', 'example', 'violence', 'shown', 'here', 'breaks', 'comic', 'pretense', 'frankly', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'where', 'johnson', 'out', 'inmates', 'prison', 'yard', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'kidnap', 'victim', 'van', 'not', 'characters', 'morph', 'comically', 'shallow', 'grandiose', 'pathetically', 'sadistic', 'greedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'single', 'film', 'have', 'ways', ""'re"", 'put', 'guard', 'OK', 'laugh', 'not', 'film', 'ability', 'draw', 'world', ""'re"", 'just', 'gawkers', 'gore', 'grief', 'embarrassed', 'ever', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'laugh']",N/A

With his friend, Adrian (Mackie), and an ex-con (Johnson), Danny decides to rob a spoiled and egotistical businessman named Victor Kershaw (Shalhoub). After seemingly succeeding, Kershaw turns to a private investigator (Harris) to recover his finances and deal with the trio...But everything gets out of hand quickly.Thoughts: This is a Michael Bay film. As such, it matches his general off-kilter aesthetics and love of the ""BOOM, BANG, BOOM"". That said, this is different from his most recent endeavors (i.e. the Transformers) in that it is exceedingly more violent. However, the cast give morbidly entertaining performances which quickly helped make this a much more enjoyable film.

1629643,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYLO8,FNDNreview,"[2, 5]","Most of us have specific actors or actresses that we follow, both big names and occasionally small.  We grow comfortable watching certain action stars or people that make us laugh, but whether you realize it or not, we also often grow into a habit of watching films directed by certain directors.  The average movie-goer is usually pretty aware of big name directors, like Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese, and probably even the newly popular directors, like Christopher Nolan and J.J. Abrams.  However, a once noteworthy director (mostly known for his action sequences), Michael Bay  has recently gotten lost in the mix - due in large part to the fact that he constantly and consistently makes over-the-top films with high profile action...and far too much dramatic use of wind.  If there's a new Michael Bay movie coming out, you can usually assume it will have a ton of action, plenty of low angle shots, and scenes that look like they are moving in slow motion.  Whether you like Michael Bay's work as a director or not is up to you, but he's usually pretty easy to identify based on his work in films, such as the Transformers trilogy, Bad Boys, and Armageddon.  And his newest film, based on a true story, is Pain & Gain.Directed by Michael Bay (The Rock, Pearl Harbor), Pain & Gain stars Mark Wahlberg as Daniel Lugo, a bodybuilding instructor that has grown tired of living a life in poverty.  With his friends, Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul (Dwayne Johnson), Lugo hatches a plan to kidnap one of his clients, Victor (Tony Shalhoub) and extort his money by means of torture.  After successfully extorting the money, the ""Sun Gym Gang"" attempt to murder Victor, only to repeatedly fail.  Now, broke and without resources, Victor is out to reclaim his money and take down the gang.  Ed Harris, Ken Jeong, and Rob Corddry also star in supporting roles.In true Michael Bay fashion, it doesn't take long for the slow-motion drama to kick into high gear when Mark Wahlberg is stuck with a police car as he flees from his pursuers.  From there, the film flashes back to the beginning of the plot, unfolding the series of events, which are based on a true story.  Even though the film is based on real life events, the film's writers certainly add a great deal of ""Hollywood"" to this film in the form of humor and violence.  The Sun Gym Gang is portrayed like the Three Stooges of the crime world - bumbling around town, leaving an abundance of evidence for the police to find.  However, the police have no interest in pursuing a case that they deem to be so unbelievable that it can't be true, which is one of the reasons that this plot escalates to the point of murder.If you can manage to put aside the fact that this is a complete Hollywood production, you may be able to find some enjoyment in the film.  For a film that only had a budget of $25 million, one would have to assume that the majority of that budget went to high profile actors Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson (mostly Wahlberg).  Of course, that's pure speculation, but it's not like these two individuals didn't earn their cut with this film.  In fact, the only real bright spot (for a movie that really didn't need to be made in the first place) are the actors.  Pain & Gain isn't the best performance of Wahlberg's career, but it's certainly not the worst, either.  His charisma sells the main character as the half-witted conman, while Dwayne Johnson is nothing more than comic relief in a film that wasn't meant to be humorous.  There are plenty of humorous moments, including character interactions with sex toys, a chainsaw made in china, and the utter stupidity of the majority of the characters looking the other way while obvious crimes are taking place right in front of their eyes.  And, just like in Armageddon, Michael Bay had to throw in an over-the-top strip club scene.Overall, this is probably the best Michael Bay film in quite a while (not that he has a long list of overachievers to choose from anyway).  Still, he takes a break from the Transformers franchise to make something totally different than what he's been doing lately, which is a nice change of pace.  But, at the end of the day, it's still a Michael Bay film - chalked full of dramatic low angle, slo-mo shots that would probably cut the film run-time in half if they were cut out completely.  For a true story about a serious situation, this film is turned into one big joke - so it's not entirely a huge surprise that the real life people associated with this story are upset about how Pain & Gain has portrayed them.Overall Film Grade:  C+FNDNreview.com",3,Michael Bay turns a serious situation into a comedy,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,4615,"['Most', 'have', 'specific', 'actors',

Michael Bay's surprisingly clunky direction doesn't help nor does the barely above tolerable acting by a group of high paid actors. An action/comedy based on some real life heinous history? Don't think so.In the 1990s, during the rise of physical fitness gyms, Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) a borderline stupid Miami bodybuilder wants to live the American dream. He would like to have the money that other people have. So he enlists the help of fellow bodybuilder Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) and ex-convict, Christian bodybuilder Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson). Their kidnapping of wealthy Colombian Jew Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) and extortion scheme to get all his ill-gotten gains goes terribly wrong since they have muscles for brains and they're left to haphazardly try to hold onto the elusive American dream. Some cameo roles by Ken Jeong, Ed Harris, Peter Stormare, Tony Plana, Rebel Wilson, Larry Hankin and a huge cast ignite the tasteless story for a few moments, but for the majority of time the `comedy' is gory and simply not at all fun - nor is the true story upon which it is loosly based.

Which they do have every right to do so, it's inhumane to laugh about the death and sufferings of anyone. However, my dark humour tendencies cannot dislike this movie and I have to admit my dark side has gotten the better of me.I liked the idea that the producers of this film has made it a comedy instead of going through the old tragedy route. That was refreshing and that made the film bearable for the most part. I don't think I could've managed to set through it otherwise. Although there are inaccurate details that never happened in real life, most of the movie *at least the important parts* hold true to the story.A lot of reviews here were complaining about the fact that the director glorifies the Sun Gym Gang and their tedious crimes against their victims. However, I do not see that aspect in this movie at all. Just because the movie is about them doesn't mean it represents them as heroes, actually the movie makes them exactly what they were criminal minds with very little intellect to go with it. Which was their ultimate downfall. It also states the misconception these people had about the idea of the American Dream. Funny enough, in their point of view living the American Dream meant that they had to be rich they just chose the wrong way to do it and ended up getting what they deserved the end.I give it three stars, because although it was entertaining and the acting was moderately good as well as the script. It could've been better, there was a lot of mumbo jumbo going on in some scenes that was a bit confusing. Also, this is isn't the best thing that has ever been made in the history of film making.

Also, the previews of this movie made it appear that it was going to be a fun, light hearted, interesting comedy maybe along the lines of ""Tower Heist.""  But instead, it features one extremely anti-gay scene after another.  And I'm not over reacting; I lived through the homophobic 1970s and 80s in High School and College and work environments, all in small towns. So I know homophobia when I see it, and this movie was so backwards and just plain wrong, it Turned My Stomach several times.  And it's not the fun kind of homophobia that you see on South Park.  Nope.  In this movie, it is all too real, and very disturbing.Plus ""Pain and Gain"" is not really violent like a good action movie, but disgusting and nauseating with lots of scenes of dismemberment, and close-ups of the parts afterward.It's also a total downer with no defined good guys, bad guys, or victims. I mean...  They're all bad guys!!  Tony Shaloub plays a scumbag who is ""half a criminal"" but they never showed what he did in the past, and without some of that history, everything the guys do to him is just excessive, feels wrong, and I didn't root for anyone at all, especially since the three morons, who can't get a single thing right, go way overboard on absolutely everything they do.

1629707,A1BQOT47Q2I1TX,B00BEIYLO8,Jim C.,"[0, 0]","The last year brought four films which, in different ways, deal with the same topic:  amoral materialism run amok in today&#8217;s America.  They are:  The Bling Ring; Spring Breakers; The Wolf of Wall Street; and Pain and Gain.  In my view, despite its brutality, crudity, and ugliness, Pain and Gain is the best.  If you can stand it.Amazon&#8217;s customer reviews reveal roughly a 50-50 split.  Interestingly, Rotten Tomatoes.com, which collects critic reviews on films, shows a virtual tie between the pros and the cons.  The outraged negative reaction doesn&#8217;t surprise me.  Pain and Gain is not a pleasant film.  Many people were turned off by the raw language and sexual references.  Others abhorred the violence.  And others, oddly, despite all that sex and violence, were bored.That the Bling Ring was directed by Sofia Coppola may explain why it fared somewhat better with the critics--but not with Amazon customers--than Pain and Gain.  That Pain and Gain was directed by Michael Bay no doubt hurt the film with some critics.  (What if the same film been directed by a critical darling like Quentin Tarantino?  Pulp Fiction overflows with both violence and crudity.)Pain and Gain isn&#8217;t a comedy.  Overall, the mood is pitch black.  There is simply nothing funny about graphic violence inflicted on even sleazy victims.  Still, the film contains many absurd, laugh-out-loud moments, such as when the criminals botch the first kidnap attempt or when one of them fastens the victim&#8217;s seat belt before crashing his car.  Or when head criminal Mark Wahlberg organizes a Neighborhood Watch meeting, after moving into victim #1&#8216;s posh house.Other moments produce reflexive shock laughter, the kind we&#8217;ve all experienced in life.The film&#8217;s message about greed, the things people do for material gain, is bleak indeed.  And, in this regard, the film is absolutely uncompromising and stark.  Here we&#8217;re not dealing with Wall Street crooks or spoiled 20-somethings in L.A.  Here the stakes are , great bodily injury, life and death.To Michael Bay&#8217;s credit, he does not play the murder scene for laughs.  And he doesn&#8217;t prettify the three attempted murders on victim #1, though the victim&#8217;s resilience does produce shock laughter.  (He does cross the line, however, when the males at the Neighborhood Watch get-together eagerly volunteer to role-play an attempted rapist.  Not funny.)The writing is damned good, with a spot-on sense of real-life criminals.  Prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, and judges can cite chapter-and-verse about criminals who overrate their intelligence, who turn on one another when the going gets rough.The cast is terrific.  Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson (yes, he can act), Anthony Mackie (from &#8220;The Hurt Locker&#8221;), Tony Shalhoub, and Ed Harris.I&#8217;m not a Michael Bay fan.  But he&#8217;s made good films before.  (See, &#8220;The Rock,&#8221; selected for the elite Criterion Collection DVD series).  He&#8217;s done it again.  If you can stomach the violence and deal with the sexual references, Pain and Gain is well worth watching.

Ouch! It made the aftermath of my viewing experience that much more painful.Brief Synopsis:Paul Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is a personal trainer at a privately owned gym in Miami, Florida. He is young, motivated, and will do just about anything to live the ""American Dream"" or more plainly spoken, justify his sentiment of entitlement.Despite Paul's criminal past as a schemer, we watch Paul reinvent himself as a successful trainer at a local gym. He appears he is good at what he does. Moreover, he manages to triple the gym membership in just 6 weeks. As a successful trainer though he still feels the way like most hardworking Americans do, not appreciated. One of his more wealthier clients, Victor (Tony Shalhoub) is a self-made millionaire who seems to spend about as much time talking down to people as he did building his empire. Paul begins to take notice of his posh lifestyle and desires to have it whatever the cost. So what's the plan to achieve this lifestyle ? Forcibly kidnap him and drain his assets. Simple enough, but he realizes he can't do it by himself. The team is expanded to include Paul Doyle (Dwyane Johnson) who was a cocaine addicted convict but now turned evangelist Christian and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie). The three stooges begin their quest for wealth and glory but only with short term success.I'll start with the premise for the film. I found it hard to ignore that the film cannot help but to protect it's integrity by throwing mini disclaimers stating this is a true story. About an hour through the movie, we are reminded again with the subtitle, ""This is still a true story"". If this film was purely fictional it would be that much tougher to make this story into a motion picture film let alone retain an audience. But this is where the film tries to capitalize on the true story aspect. It is the ridiculousness and stupidity of reality that invokes a sense of awe and disbelief. People want to see what the next idiotic stunt these three ring ling circus brothers will produce next. It is obvious that we know where these criminals are going to end up but their amateur style is just enough to keep us watching. Why? Because it is true a story.The execution was just poor. Granted that taking an odd and true life murder story and rendering it into a dark comedy requires some serious skill. However, Michael Bay failed miserably accomplishing this task. Maybe the budget just wasn't big enough, after all, 26 million dollars is how much Michael usually spends on a car crash stunt. After watching every gore scene end with some sort of twisted line of humor, I cringed. Films that tout themselves as being a true story usually throw a red flag for me; details are usually fabricated to the fullest extent, and in most cases the truth is extended as far as it is allowed to go, or at least make a profit.  In the real life story, people were kidnapped, tortured and murdered. I didn't find this aspect funny but actually sick and depraved. But this makes sense because our culture is sick and depraved to begin with. It is a perfect fit. The sheer idiocy of these criminals wasn't enough to distract me from the real life victims that suffered. I left the theater questioning our culture as a society.",1,"All Pain, Too Much Pain, Stop the Pain, What Did I Gain ?!",1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,3459,"['Words', 'could', ""n't"", 'describe', 'pain', 'suffering', 'went', 'viewing', 'piece', 'cinema', 'garbage.Actually', 'pain', 'started', 'sat', 'down', 'when', 'paid', '12.50', 'ticket', '4.50', 'bottle', 'water', 'Ouch', 'made', 'aftermath', 'viewing', 'experience', 'much', 'more', 'painful.Brief', 'Synopsis', 'Paul', 'Lugo', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'personal', 'trainer', 'privately', 'owned', 'gym', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'young', 'motivated', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'live', 'American', 'Dream', 'more', 'plainly', 'spoken', 'justify', 'sentiment', 'entitlement.Despite', 'Paul', 'criminal', 'past', 'schemer', 'watch', 'Paul', 'reinvent', 'successful', 'trainer', 'local', 'gym', 'good', 'what', 'Moreover', 'triple', 'gym', 'membership', 'just', '6', 'weeks', 'successful', 'trainer', 'still', 'way', 'most', 'hardworking', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'appreciated', 'One', 'more', 'wealthier', 'clients', 'Victor', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'self-made', 'millionaire', 'who', 'spend', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'talking', 'down', 'people', 'did', 'building', 'empire', 'Paul', 'take', 'notice', 'posh', 'lifestyle', 'desires', 'have', 'cost', 'what', 'plan', 'achieve', 'lifestyle', 'Forcibly', 'kidnap', 'drain', 'assets', 'Simple', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'team', 'expanded', 'include', 'Paul', 'Doyle', 'Dwyane', 'Johnson', 'who', 'was', 'cocaine', 'addicted', 'convict', 'now', 'turned', 'evangelist', 'Christian', 'Adrian', 'Doorbal', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'three', 'stooges', 'begin', 'quest', 'wealth', 'glory', 'only', 'short', 'term', 'success.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'premise', 'film', 'found', 'hard', 'ignore', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'protect', 'integrity', 'throwing', 'mini', 'disclaimers', 'stating', 'true', 'story', 'hour', 'movie', 'are', 'reminded', 'again', 'subtitle', 'still', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'purely', 'fictional', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'tougher', 'make', 'story', 'motion', 'picture', 'film', 'let', 'alone', 'retain', 'audience', 'where', 'film', 'tries', 'capitalize', 'true', 'story', 'aspect', 'ridiculousness', 'stupidity', 'reality', 'sense', 'awe', 'disbelief', 'People', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'idiotic', 'stunt', 'three', 'ring', 'ling', 'circus', 'brothers', 'will', 'produce', 'next', 'obvious', 'know', 'where', 'criminals', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'amateur', 'style', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'Why', 'true', 'story.The', 'execution', 'was', 'just', 'poor', 'Granted', 'taking', 'odd', 'true', 'life', 'murder', 'story', 'rendering', 'dark', 'comedy', 'serious', 'skill', 'However', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'failed', 'miserably', 'accomplishing', 'task', 'Maybe', 'budget', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', '26', 'million', 'dollars', 'how', 'much', 'Michael', 'usually', 'car', 'crash', 'stunt', 'watching', 'gore', 'scene', 'end', 'sort', 'twisted', 'line', 'humor', 'cringed', 'Films', 'tout', 'being', 'true', 'story', 'usually', 'throw', 'red', 'flag', 'details', 'are', 'usually', 'fabricated', 'fullest', 'extent', 'most', 'cases', 'truth', 'extended', 'as', 'far', 'allowed', 'go', 'least', 'make', 'profit', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'people', 'were', 'kidnapped', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'aspect', 'funny', 'actually', 'sick', 'depraved', 'sense', 'culture', 'sick', 'depraved', 'begin', 'perfect', 'fit', 'sheer', 'idiocy', 'criminals', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'distract', 'real', 'life', 'victims', 'suffered', 'left', 'theater', 'questioning', 'culture', 'society']",N/A

1629710,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,B00BEIYLO8,JLR,"[1, 4]","This has to be the gayest movie I have ever seen. This movie is so homo that it would make Ellen Degeneres go straight. But if the movie's unintentional homoeroticism doesn't make you queasy, then the insipid writing will give you a stomach flu (""Sometimes God just f---s up your order and you gotta chow down on that s----y shame sandwich"" WTF?) I know, that was a bad attempt at humor at my part, but you got to admit, it was a hundred times more hilarious than anything in this steroid-induced catastrophe.The movie opens with Daniel Lugo (played by Mark Wahlberg in a performance that can be mildly described as a ""career setback"") doing a sit-up from what looks like an armpit on a billboard, cause that's supposed to be funny, apparently. Then when the cops arrive, Wahlberg makes a run for it and we have three pointless slow-motion shots that exist for no reason, other than for existing. Three minutes into the film and ""Pain and Gain"" is already in trouble.Depressingly, that's not even the worst part of the movie. That would be the remaining 126 minutes of the film. Throughout the movie, Lugo, along with his muscle-bound boyfriends Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie), extort a nasty, neighborhood millionaire (Tony Shalhoub) and try to keep the crime quiet from the feds, particularly the nosy private investigator (Ed Harris, who looks like he'd rather be somewhere else) out to bring them down. Unfortunately, they fail because script dictates that they act as idiotically as possible, showing that even butch gay bodybuilders are not the sharpest knives in the drawer.The first half of the movie is seeing the three idiots devise the plan while flexing their muscles in front of the camera. Is this supposed to make men butch? Or is it to make us buy the next Boy George album? They finally catch their victim and proceed to torture him into signing away his assets, using, of all things, sex toys. In the midst of all this silliness, the poor schmuck finds out who one of the idiots are by smelling his cologne. Oohhhhhkay.To get rid of the ex-millionaire, they decide to get him drunk and kill him in a car accident. Shalhoub survives and nobody in the hospital believes him. The three idiots decide to finish what they started, only to decide not to because police thinks it's drunk driving, even though earlier, Shalhoub found out who Wahlberg was. What was the point of them trying to kill a guy if no one was going to believe him anyway? Why did we need to see a car blow up? Because in a Michael Bay movie, there has to be an explosion, not an effective way to tell a story.The second half is every bit as idiotic as the first half. After achieving their goal, Shalhoub hires Ed Harris to investigate the act of injustice inflicted on him. Meanwhile, everything goes wrong for the beloved trio. Dwayne Johnson has become a cocaine addict and decides to rob bags of money from an armored car. After being chased by the police and getting his toe blown off, he arrives at his friend's party and, in typical Michael Bay form, we never hear from the police again. When they realize they're low in cash, they decide to rob a phone sex operator (yes, you heard me correctly), only to inadvertently kill him and his girlfriend with a weight bell and a HORSE TRANQUILIZER respectively. ""Raising Arizona"" this is not.Needless to say, this is downhill for our beloved heroes and downhill for moviegoers with a brain. To tell you more about this movie would do more harm than good, but when Bay isn't fixated on seeing his heroes wiggle their butts, he ogles on the breasts and bottoms of his ""female characters"". In Bay's movie, the women are, of course, composed of nothing but scantily clad hookers, morbidly obese slobs and, in a classy subplot, a fat nurse that provides penis erection treatments for one of the main characters. Yeah, between this, the cologne scene, the sight of male bodybuilders showing their muscles and the sex toys, this movie is totally not gay at all.This movie sucks, blows and swallows at the same time. I saw ""Fargo"" the other day (a truly great movie) and that film covered the same ideas of extortions with better directing, writing, acting and comedy. Even though it's based on a true story, ""Pain and Gain"" has the authenticity of a Hulk Hogan flick. At least ""No Holds Barred"" was good for a laugh. This is like being whipped by the guys from ""Passion of the Christ"" for two hours.If you want a better demonstration in just how immature this unintentionally homosexual fantasy is, just watch ""GoodFellas"" and compare Mark Wahlberg to Ray Liotta, Anthony Mackie to Robert De Niro, Dwayne Johnson to Joe Pesci, the hookers to Lorraine Bracco, and Rob Corddry to Paul Sorvino. Compared to the tastiness of that great movie, ""Pain and Gain"" is a McDonald's burger covered in moose piss.Strongest recommendation to avoid one of the worst movies ever made.",1,This may well be

There's muscles, lots and lots of muscles, weightlifting, knocking people the f@$# out, zany crime schemes, loads of hot girls in skimpy dresses and thong bikinis and sometimes nothing at all, dudes talking about getting ripped, humorous accidental murder, an idiot who thinks he's a mastermind, some middle-of-the-road comedic torture scenes (but nothing hard to watch), adult sex toys and the unavoidable humor that comes with them, gun fights, idiotic disguises, chase scenes, The Rock hilariously getting cracked out on drugs, inappropriate scenes involving a priest, an AMAZING cameo by Ken Jeong, the traumatic loss of a toe, disposal of dead bodies, embracing the notion of the chubby-chaser, erectile dysfunction...and things constantly go wrong in the funniest of ways.This all leads to the most ridiculous courtroom criminal trial scene and somehow this is based on a true story!!!!!This movie enjoys the narration of the ever-personable Mark Wahlberg as Danny Lugo.  Lugo is a personal trainer striving for physical self-improvement in the form of muscle mass--and is doing a pretty good job of it--but he wants more.  He wants the riches and the women; he wants what ""the other guy has.""  In this case, the other guy is Lugo's blow-hard arrogant client Victor.  During training sessions Victor narcissistically runs his mouth about everything he owns and how happy he is to have it, and this gets Lugo salivating.  After Lugo attends an over-the-top self-help seminar from Ken Jeong (The Hangover 2), he decides that he is a ""doer"" not a ""don'ter"" and he decides to get off his ass and take what he deserves...Victor's money!Lugo recruits Adrien (Anthony Mackie) and the recently saved, sober and released from prison Paul (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson).  Together, these three bumbling fools engage is kidnapping and heists which they believe to be brilliant but lack a certain technical soundness.  Much to my glee, they're far from brilliant.  But they achieve their goals in the most roundabout of ways and it is hilarious at all stages.Wahlberg has played the fool before (e.g., Boogie Nights, The Other Guys, Ted) and he does it at least as well here.  But the real shocker is Johnson, who plays his most over-the-top, weird, funny role ever.  He preaches AA lines like gospel, seeks to save Victor while torturing him and gets re-hooked on drugs--which leads to some amazingly funny scenes of a tweaked out 6'4"" 260 pounder with crazy eyes and a Fear and Loathing smile.  These guys must have had a blast on the set improvising these scenes because a lot of one-liners and exchanges were priceless.Among their lies, they pose as famous filmmakers and CIA agents to win the heart of a stripper, who joins their CIA ""team,"" and make a mess of their attempts to be smooth movie criminals.  Later, their involvement with the porn king of southern California gets predictably out of hand as well.Some great supporting roles come from Ed Harris, who does a fine job as an ex-cop private investigator with a lot of local PD clout, and Rebel Wilson (Bridesmaids, Pitch Perfect), a physician's assistant who catches Mackie's eye.I'm not saying this was necessarily a great movie to the masses. But for me, a Wahlberg/Johnson movie fan and action movie aficionado, this movie was perfect. I loved EVERY MINUTE of the often tasteless, shallow antics and also enjoyed Michael Bay's obligate explosions and chaotic gunfire (which was well-placed a few times in the movie).",5,Everything that I thought I wanted out of a bro-down action-comedy and then some!,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,3573,"['Pain', 'Gain', 'everything', 'thought', 'wanted', 'bro-down', 'action-comedy', 'then', 'muscles', 'lots', 'lots', 'muscles', 'weightlifting', 'knocking', 'people', 'f', '@', 'out', 'zany', 'crime', 'schemes', 'loads', 'hot', 'girls', 'skimpy', 'dresses', 'thong', 'bikinis', 'sometimes', 'nothing', 'dudes', 'talking', 'getting', 'ripped', 'humorous', 'accidental', 'murder', 'idiot', 'who', 'mastermind', 'middle-of-the-road', 'comedic', 'torture', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'hard', 'watch', 'adult', 'sex', 'toys', 'unavoidable', 'humor', 'gun', 'fights', 'idiotic', 'disguises', 'chase', 'scenes', 'Rock', 'hilariously', 'getting', 'cracked', 'out', 'drugs', 'inappropriate', 'scenes', 'involving', 'priest', 'AMAZING', 'cameo', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'traumatic', 'loss', 'toe', 'disposal', 'dead', 'bodies', 'embracing', 'notion', 'chubby-chaser', 'erectile', 'dysfunction', 'things', 'constantly', 'go', 'wrong', 'funniest', 'ways.This', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'courtroom', 'criminal', 'trial', 'scene', 'somehow', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'narration', 'ever-personable', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Danny', 'Lugo', 'Lugo', 'personal', 'trainer', 'striving', 'physical', 'self-improvement', 'form', 'muscle', 'mass', 'doing', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'more', 'riches', 'women', 'what', 'other', 'guy', 'case', 'other', 'guy', 'Lugo', 'blow-hard', 'arrogant', 'client', 'Victor', 'training', 'sessions', 'Victor', 'narcissistically', 'mouth', 'everything', 'how', 'happy', 'have', 'Lugo', 'salivating', 'Lugo', 'over-the-top', 'self-help', 'seminar', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'Hangover', '2', 'doer', 'not', ""don'ter"", 'get', 'off', 'ass', 'take', 'what', 'Victor', 'money', 'Lugo', 'Adrien', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'recently', 'saved', 'sober', 'released', 'prison', 'Paul', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'Together', 'three', 'bumbling', 'fools', 'engage', 'kidnapping', 'heists', 'believe', 'be', 'brilliant', 'certain', 'technical', 'soundness', 'Much', 'glee', ""'re"", 'far', 'brilliant', 'achieve', 'goals', 'most', 'roundabout', 'ways', 'hilarious', 'stages.Wahlberg', 'played', 'fool', 'e.g.', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Other', 'Guys', 'Ted', 'least', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'real', 'shocker', 'Johnson', 'who', 'most', 'over-the-top', 'weird', 'funny', 'role', 'ever', 'AA', 'lines', 'gospel', 'save', 'Victor', 'torturing', 're-hooked', 'drugs', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'tweaked', '6', '4', '260', 'pounder', 'crazy', 'eyes', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'smile', 'guys', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'blast', 'set', 'improvising', 'scenes', 'lot', 'one-liners', 'exchanges', 'were', 'priceless.Among', 'lies', 'pose', 'famous', 'filmmakers', 'CIA', 'agents', 'win', 'heart', 'stripper', 'who', 'CIA', 'team', 'make', 'mess', 'attempts', 'be', 'smooth', 'movie', 'criminals', 'Later', 'involvement', 'porn', 'king', 'southern', 'California', 'predictably', 'hand', 'well.Some', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'come', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'fine', 'job', 'ex-cop', 'private', 'investigator', 'lot', 'local', 'PD', 'clout', 'Rebel', 'Wilson', 'Bridesmaids', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'physician', 'assistant', 'who', 'Mackie', 'eye.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'was', 'necessarily', 'great', 'movie', 'masses', 'Wahlberg/Johnson', 'movie', 'fan', 'action', 'movie', 'aficionado', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'loved', 'EVERY', 'MINUTE', 'often', 'tasteless', 'shallow', 'antics', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'obligate', 'explosions', 'chaotic', 'gunfire', 'was', 'well-placed', 'few', 'times', 'movie']",N/A

Orduna""","[0, 1]","Pain & Gain is based on a real story, and when you read the &#34;real&#34; articles, you will find that this movie doesn't become as absurd as people like to think. Go and read the story, and then compare it to the film and you will see the core and major elements are there. Do they visually and sonically become the same? No. This is NOT a documentary, it's a film based on a true story. The same argument that people have about how bad this is, can inherently be the same negativity that will be placed on movies like &#34;Lincoln&#34; and other &#34;historical&#34; biographies.That being said, this movie captures the heart of the stories, which I may remind everyone were rejected at first. The editors that published the stories thought they were made up, because the truth is so outlandish. When put to film, everyone assumes it's trivial, or that it's been placed into a cartoon world, but reality is often times even more stranger than the fiction.What you get here is a movie that is wildly entertaining, and can stand alone as a good film with a lot of potent relevance. If you immediately hate the director for his past films, than you are going to hate this movie. But the arguments that people have in regards to pacing, visual effects, story telling, and more are misguided and only prove that the general audience wants to perpetuate this notion that Michael Bay can't direct or that he makes awful movies. I'm not defending the director's past, as this movie is definitely worth watching, as a stand alone piece.If you hate this movie, or any other, let's see your brilliant film.

1629727,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BEIYLO8,J. Richardson,"[1, 2]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Well that was fun. Going into Pain & Gain I didn't really have any expectations. This was mainly because I knew very little about the film beyond the basic premise of three men robbing other, very wealthy, men who didn't ""deserve"" their financial success. I was also unaware that this was based on a true story. Now there's no doubt in my mind that a lot of flare was added to make this more enjoyable from a cinematic standpoint, but to deny that Pain & Gain was a blast would be downright blasphemous.Pain & Gain's main character, if I had to pick one, would probably be Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg). He's the one who comes up with the idea and Adrian ""Noel"" Dorbal (Anthony Mackie) and Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) just agree to tag along in hopes of creating a better life for themselves. Daniel and Adrian are both fitness trainers working for Sun Gym. One day Daniel gets a new client by the name of Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) who starts telling Daniel his life story and how he's so rich, yada yada yada.Inspired by motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong), Lugo creates a scheme to rob this man who he believes is a crook. The only thing is he doesn't just want to rob him, he wants to destroy him and leave him with nothing. He convinces Adrian to help him out and when ex-convict Paul comes looking for a job at the gym, he convinces him too. So once they have the crew together the rest of the film is a joyride as you follow these three different men through an extremely insane story filled with theft, murder, cocaine, and strippers.I know what you're thinking, ""Well what's so different about that?"" True, we've seen movies like this before, but what we haven't seen are characters like these. I have yet to go too deep into the differences between the movie and reality, but the biggest one I've seen so far is that Dwayne's character is the product of multiple men. Meaning they took bits and pieces of four different men and created Paul. Normally an inaccuracy like this would be irritating to someone like me, but I find it hard to find too much fault in it when the execution was so flawless. Paul is perhaps one of the funniest characters we've seen since Alan from the original Hangover film. He's this huge, terrifying man on the outside, but inside he's this sweetheart trying to move on from his past.Then there's Lugo. The man who just wants to make a quick buck because he's tired of struggling through life. He's tired of doing the same thing day after day because no matter how good he looks he can't get a woman without sufficient income. He expects this to be an easy job. Kidnap Kershaw, get him to sign some papers, and drop him off somewhere. What he doesn't expect is Kershaw to put up a struggle because it takes a good month before he finally cracks. Daniel's probably one of the more grounded characters out of the entire cast. All he wants is to live a comfortable life, but he just can't seem to get ahead. His biggest issue is that he always wants to take shortcuts and that's what got him thrown in prison for fraud a few years back.What made Pain & Gain so enjoyable, for me, is that beyond the characters and beyond the violence they managed to keep a lighthearted tone throughout majority of the film. Even when they were cutting people up with a chainsaw or barbecuing hands on the grill, there was always that splash of comedy that turned a gruesome scene into a funny one. It's one of those films that's a comedy without actually being a comedy. When you break it down, Pain & Gain is just another crime film, but the fact that they had me laughing throughout the entire film makes it hard for me not to label it a comedy.Truthfully, as much as I enjoyed this movie, I do feel that it overstayed its welcome a little bit. Running at two hours and some change this is a long movie that starts to feel long in its final 20 minutes or so. Don't get me wrong, the laughs never stopped, but it did reach a point where I was like ""Is this really still going on? Are they really doing a second robbery?"" I know that this was all part of the actual story, but that doesn't diminish the fact that it started to lose some of its steam. There's only so much you can take before it starts to get old. Once it reaches that point you start to notice some things that just feel a little pointless and predictable.If there's been a cast with this much chemistry in the past please let me know now because at this moment in time I can't think of any. You see these three men in the promotional posters and it honestly doesn't look right. They're three completely different men with three completely different personalities, but the same can be said about their characters and that's why this film works as well as it does. After the lackluster Broken City I'm glad to have another Wahlberg film I enjoy. He's kind of taken pieces of his previous roles and applied them all in here. So if you're a fan of Wahlberg expect to enjoy his performance here. Then Dwayne gave what's probably my favorite performance from him so far. He brought a lot of laughs and I really hope we get to see this side of him more often. Mackie, on the other hand, continues to solidify himself as one of those actors who keeps a solid performance throughout, but also one who has yet to reach his full potential.There's a pretty diverse cast of characters ranging from really great to forgettable. You have Ed Harris as Detective Ed Du Bois, Ken Jeong as Johnny Wu, Rebel Wilson as Robin Peck (Adrian's love interest), Rob Corddry as Sun Gym owner John Mese, Bar Paly as Sorina Luminata (Paul's love interest), and Tony Shalhoub as Victor Kershaw. Just like the main cast, a lot of these characters are here for comedic effect. The only person who felt a little out of place was Rebel Wilson, but I think part of that was because she only received like two minutes of screen time. It just felt like her character didn't really add anything to the story. With that said, everyone involved did a great job.Overall Score: 8/10 - There's bound to be many inaccuracies scattered throughout Pain & Gain and if I had known about the story prior to watching this I probably would have noticed them. Thankfully, I didn't and that's ok because Pain & Gain accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain. You don't always need huge special effects or an intelligent plot to create a good movie. Sometimes the characters and their respective actors can carry the film and Pain & Gain is one of those films. It definitely could've benefited from a shorter running time, but if that's my biggest complaint about the experience then they're ahead of the game. If you're looking to have a good time at the movies then go see this. It's not complex and it's not a visual masterpiece, it's just fun.",4,8/10 - Good,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,6842,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Well', 'was', 'fun',

I've never been to a film where the theater audience vociferously ""BOOED"" out loud afterwards, until I saw this film. I believe the actors played their roles as directed, but the atrocious dialogue, the choppiness of the movie, and the over the top violence & cursing made it unbearable to watch.  I went in having knowledge of the original story after reading about it and having watched the TV documentary on ABC's ""Revenge for Real"" so I was looking forward to this film, especially since Mark Walberg & the Rock were starring in it. They took the basic premise of the story, flipped it on it's head to turn it into a twisted black comedy. They then proceeded to make the victim who was a self made millionaire out to be an obnoxiously rich head case who constantly boasted about how rich he was that would make almost anybody want to beat the tar out of him and take all his money. And they wrote out one of the primary characters, Jorge Delgado, the one who actually worked for Victor Kershaw.  He was the one who worked out at the Gym and got in with Danny Lugo.  Then they had the gall to keep saying throughout the film, ""This is a true story.""  It faintly resembled the basic events of the story, but changed everything else.  About half way through I almost walked out it was so awful, but stayed thinking that it might get better.  Unfortunately, it only got progressively worse. The movie is over 2 hours long and felt every bit like 4. Well, at least they got the title right.  The paying audience's 'PAIN' was the movie maker's 'Gain'.  This movie belongs in the trash heap of ""Worst movies ever made with big name actors.""  If this movie earned anything, it deserves a Razzie for ""Worst film of the year.""

1629746,A1DWUPXRD1HN1B,B00BEIYLO8,Kurt Russell,"[3, 5]","This movie is extremely stylish, so much so, that it will undoubtedly turn you off if you cannot handle it. Are you a fan of kinetic pitch-black comedies? Then this is one of the wildest and darkest movies I've ever seen on a big budget level. Think of something written by vintage Coen Brothers and directed by Guy Ritchie or Tony Scott. Indeed, this movie is that good - it's screwball noir with a message.Featuring a trio of meatheads and their moronic get-rich scam that goes to all hell, this story was a riot. Inventively told through multiple perspectives with a variety of flashbacks, dream sequences, and even different characters doing voice overs, the movie moves a mile a minute and is constantly surprising the viewer with a variety of clever twists and turns.I see that many critics of this film fault it for being ""too stupid to be true."" Well, unfortunately for the uninformed viewer who makes strange snap judgments based on the actual veracity of the plot, the story is astoundingly accurate in regards to its most unbelievable moments, which only adds to its greatness.But what ultimately elevates the film to art beyond the fact that it's highly entertaining, deeply suspenseful and hysterically funny, is its many observations on American greed and ambition. I guess because Scorsese's ""Wolf of Wall Street"" has the right pedigree, it gets elevated to Oscar nominations. This ""Michael Bay"" movie is extremely akin to that one: debauched antiheroes fiendishly stealing the American dream. Yet while I thoroughly enjoyed ""Wolf"" too, this flick is actually the smarter film. ""Wolf"" largely portrays their cast of characters as unstoppable party monsters. Yet ""Pain and Gain"" deals with a much richer and more developed crew, who each have far more personality and depth to wrestle with the good and evil motives. I felt far more for these sad losers than I ever did for the amazing DiCaprio. And while ""Wolf"" studied the upper-echelon of 90s white-collar crime, this movie has more universal appeal with its take on the scummy everyman looking to get rich quick.My wife who normally despises this kind of movie - loud, crude, violent action-comedy - thoroughly loved it too.

Its a dark comedy about a trio of very stupid criminals whose can-do attitude brings them success for a while.

Its based loosely on a true story and there are all kinds of ""that can't possibly have happened"" moments that turn out to be rather close to the truth.Its only flaw its that its a little too long. It also tries too hard to make one of the victims the subject of empathy. Even to the point of giving him an absurdist personal revenge moment. The story would work better with the victim being an awful person for whom nobody has much of any sympathy. Having him be tough is enough. We don't have to like him.Its not a film for the mass audience or (in particular) the regular Michael Bay audience. But it is very well done.The acting is exceptional.

Then he has a rich client who is a jerk. Danny seems very positive in a Tony Robbins seminar kind of way. I am drinking his Kool Aid. Yeah, this guy is likeable. The character is played by Mark ""How's your mother"" Walberg, which I found to be genius casting. The Rock was another good casting because he plays a big teddy bear with an occasional violent streak. We have seen him play the tooth fairy and loveable dad in The Game. So, that all fits. I was totally liking these characters. They decide to kidnap the rich guy and steal his money. I was still onboard because this guy is a real jerk. Kind of a Robin Hood thing.

1629802,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYLO8,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Director Michael Bay pulls a fast one on us and actually makes a pretty decent movie.  He changes things up with this ""based on a true story"" dark comedy.  It might have been even funnier if some of this wasn't true.  Set in Miami, three knuckleheads, stereotypical muscle-bound gym rats all, decide that to advance in the material world, they should kidnap a wealthy owner of a sandwich franchise.Victor (Tony Shalhoub) is a naturalized citizen coming from South America and likely has underworld connections.  In any case he keeps most of his money offshore.  He is a very unlikeable character, always demeaning others.  Daniel (Mark Wahlberg) is the ""brains"" of the trio looking to get Victor's dough.  He's actually sociable and manages to increase the membership of a health club owned by John (Rob Corddry).  But that isn't enough.  He's worked hard but is still short of his goal.  He wants more money.  When Victor becomes a client, kidnapping and ransom seems like the right course of action.  Helping him is his testosterone-addled best friend Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul, a loveable ex-con played with a soft emotional side by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.Things become complicated, but after a long series of torture methods, Victor gives Daniel the codes needed to get the money.  He basically signs away all his property and Daniel just moves into Victor's house.  When Victor recognizes Daniel's voice, the hapless trio decide they must kill Victor.  They try.  Several times.  Victor somehow manages to survive each time.  Ed Harris is along for the ride as a retired detective, hired by Victor to get the goods on Daniel and his cohorts.I found the film reasonably entertaining, finding the himbos fun to watch.  The film does have an amped up tone of violence, especially against Shalhoub's character.  He's such an unlikeable character however, we are almost happy to see it.  And Miami must have the only police department that shoots at unarmed, running suspects.The Blu ray disc is a winner.  It comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The various colors of Miami really pop in this film.  Awash in pastels and bright whites, the film really sparkles.  Both exterior and some dark, dirty, bloody interiors work well on screen.  Excellent detail shows sweat, beards and splattered blood with great clarity.  The disc comes with an exhilarating Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless track.  The subs are in action, particularly when the scene shifts to a strip club.  The kind that advertises ""totally nude"" but none of the performers are even partially nude.  I digress.  The overall audio offers excellent clarity throughout the film.  The softer ambient sounds are as good as the immersive gun battles.  Subtitles come in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

The troubling part is that this is said to be a true story.***Stop reading if you don't like spoilers.***The story starts with Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) running from what is an obvious raid on his place of employment, he's hit by a car and then the story flashes back to 6 Months earlier.Daniel is a personal trainer at a local Miami Gym and he comes in contact with a very well to do Colombian-Jewish Entrepreneur.  The Entrepreneur's name is withheld to protect the innocent but, needless to say, this guy hires Daniel as Personal Trainer and begins to tell him all about his success in life.Now Daniel attends a Johnny Wu (Never actually happened) seminar where he is convinced he is A doer and only needs to come up with a plan then make it happen.One thing leads to another Daniel recruits his two friends, Paul and Adrian, to come up with a plan of how they're going to take the Entrepreneurs life, money, and property away to make it their own.Needless to say, this whole thing leads to kidnapping, extortion, fraud, attempted murder, a double murder, and two death penalties for 6 months of living the high life.The acting was decent overall but, playing three dumb, homicidal, muscle heads (no this is not an insult to weight lifters, these guys really were dumb) probably isn't all that challenging.The movie itself was actually very entertaining, disturbing, and actually well done.  I was given tickets to a screening but, I would have honestly paid to see this movie had I not known what I know now.If you're okay with somewhat morbidly bizarre comedies then you won't be disappointed by this.  My biggest struggle with the movie was the glamorization of some very violent and tasteless acts.  This is evidenced by the fact Lugo wasn't stupid, some characters were fictional and some were only half fictional and the wife of doorbal actually aided in the cleanup of the two homicides.  In other words, Michael Bay and company went out of the way to make this story more funny than it really was.Seriously, there are somethings that cannot be unseen or unlearned and this movie has both of these elements.  I would have blissfully enjoyed my suspended reality had they not have flashed across the screen a reminder that it was still a true story amidst two people trying to return a chainsaw with blood and hair on it and the other guy grilling hand that were chopped off their victims.

Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is a muscle headed body builder who is inspired in ironic fashion by unorthodox motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong).

It is clear these guys were not bright. The writers created dialouge for these crooks in order to lighten the story and to keep them from looking like complete idiots. Fictional aspects such as making the nurse (Rebel Wilson) look heavy-set with portraying Doorbal as liking those type of women kept the story from becoming dry.The beginning of the film demonstrates some humor as Danny names fictional characters as his heroes...&#34;There are no shortcuts to the American dream&#34; he proclaims.

Soon after this movie began, I felt like a weight machine just knocked the air out of me at the gym, leaving me breathless. And this feeling just compounded throughout the overly long length of this extremely bad film.I went to see this film solely because of the recent work of Mark Wahlberg. He has developed into a fine actor, who makes some pretty good films which benefit from his presence; his quiet intensity brings a certain amount of realism to the film and make them more watchable. He is also using his clout within Hollywood to produce some interesting, intriguing films, most notably ""The Fighter"" and well-regarded cable-fare like ""Boardwalk Empire"". But even B movies like ""Ted"", ""Contraband"" and ""Broken City"" are more watchable because of him. When I tell people I recently saw a Wahlberg film, they usually wrinkle their nose, and I find myself defending him, extolling the virtues of each of his films.But that is ending as of today.""Painand Gain"", the new `comedy' based on a true story from director Michael Bay (""Armageddon"", ""Transformers 1 through the upcoming 4"") is mind-numbingly bad.Bay is ridiculed for the films that made him famous, films like ""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"", ""Transformers"", films in which special effects are more important than the actors, explosions are more commonplace than expository dialogue and an edit happens every two seconds. So it seems odd that he would take on the story of three bodybuilders who decide to extort a sleazy Florida businessman for everything he has. Odder yet, it is intended to be a comedy. On the surface, an explosion and car-chase- free film. But it should come as no surprise that Bay manages to work some of these elements into this story. Apparently, he was unable to cut the cord completely.There are so, so many things wrong with""Painand Gain"" it is difficult to point them all out. At one point, Danny Lugo (Wahlberg) tells his potential boss that he can bench-press 400 pounds. I'll concentrate on four of the many bad things about this film, one for each 100 pounds Danny lifts. I know, random but lets go with it.The most distracting thing is the constant shifting narration. From the moment the film begins, many characters narrate the film, telling us their thoughts, their histories, their motives. The film begins with Ed Harris addressing us, yet he isn't in the film until about 45 minutes later. Then, we hear Mark Wahlberg. Then, Dwayne Johnson (as he prefers now, but he'll always be The Rock to us) before we go back to Wahlberg and so on. This is a filmmaking technique most commonly used in mysteries and sometimes dramatic stories when it is necessary to learn what a particular character is thinking. Generally, if narration is used, it is the voice of one character, a central character, designed to illuminate some difficult-to-illustrate emotion or problem. In""Pain"",because the narration shifts back and forth, it isn't clear what we are supposed to learn from it. Let's face it, these characters are pretty stupid, which is part of the intended comedy, so the caper they try to pull off is not that complicated. It isn't necessary to guide us through the `complicated' narrative. If David Mamet were the writer and director of the film, the narration might be necessary and welcome, but this is not a David Mamet film. On so many levels.The narration does nothing to establish a POV, something""Pain""could really use. Presumably, the POV should be Danny Lugo, and you would expect it to come from him. But because it shifts back and forth, the narration becomesPAIN-ful and distracts you from following his story. But he is who we should be following, so why do the shifting narration?Stupid people aren't funny simply because they are stupid. But in""Pain"",that seems to be the conceit. The characters played by Wahlberg, The Rock, and to a lesser extent simply because he has less screen time, Anthony Mackie, are all dumb as door nails. Yet, nothing they do is funny. In fact, a lot of their actions are kind of horrible. Where are the laughs supposed to come from? This trio is supposed to be a newer generation Three Stooges. And the Stooges are pretty stupid as well. But their stuff is funny because it is elaborately choreographed slapstick. And while their actions caused pain,it causedpainfor them, not others. In""Pain"",the actions of these three bodybuilders causepainto others, somewhat horrible, never funnypain.Danny wants to kidnap one of his clients, a scuzzy local businessman (Tony Shaloub) and force him to sign over all of his money and property before they release him. The plan will work perfectly because they will wear masks and Danny has ""seen a lot of movies"". Of course, the plan doesn't go well and they have to make a lot of decisions on the fly, decisions which will not have the outcome they expect. A lot of people get hurt, some people die. It just isn't funny.But you also have to ask why Danny picks out this scuzzy businessman. Is it because he is annoying? Because he is, but Is that really enough reason to kidnap him and steal everything he has? If this is the sole reason, I can think of at least a dozen people that would be better targets. Heck, many of my readers probably would single me out on occasion. There isn't enough motive for him to target this individual. And when the plan starts to go wrong, he certainly doesn't deserve the treatment he receives.Michael Bay is best known for his testosterone-fueled, male-heavy action films. He is also the director of ""Bad Boys"", two films featuring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as cops in Miami who have to solve cases. These films are very similar and Bay clearly wants""Pain""to be a sort of ""Bad Boys 3""; all three films are based in Miami, men drive expensive sports cars, the camera lingers on and fetishizes females in bathing suits, the landscape is colored by a hazy, deep sunset. But Wahlberg, The Rock and Mackie are not comedians and simply can't extract anything out this material that is remotely funny.The last problem with""Pain"",the last one we will discuss anyway, is that there is simply no one in the story that is the least bit likable. Every single character is mean, stupid, looking out for themselves, violent, a criminal, stupid and mean. Yes, I know I repeated stupid and mean, but there are a lot of characters in the film who are both so it was worth mentioning a second time. Most films have to have at least one likable character, to allow us into the story and to become a part of the narrative. Without it, we stand back from the action, watching it with disinterested passion. Without this likable character, it is a bit like watching high schoolers putting on a bad play. Nothing connects.There are a lot of problems with""Pain"".Nothing works. The acting is atrocious. The story is alienating. The cinematography looks grubby. Bay seems like he would rather be directing an action film. The Rock's performance is all over the place and unconvincing. And the list goes on.""Painand Gain"" is just that. Allpainand no gain.Hopefully, if you get nothing else from this review, you will realize that watching this film is just a...Pain.",1,All PAIN and no GAIN...,1371254400,"06 15,

1629906,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B00BEIYLO8,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[0, 1]","Three bumbling juice heads led by Daniel Lugo (a motivated Mark Wahlberg) out to make quick cash kidnap Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub doing his best John Turturro impression), who is pegged as a financially wealthy ne'er-do-well by Lugo, after Kershaw comes into Sun Gym to tone up.  You see, Lugo's dreams have never quite worked out as he's wanted them.  He wants the sun, the burn of a good workout that leads to the satisfaction of a ripped bod, and to be his own boss living his dream of destiny as a wealthy and well-looked upon owner of his own gym.  As those tony dreams don't quite pan out he enlists the aid of fellow gym rat Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie, beefing up for his role in the upcoming Marvel movie &#34;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#34; no doubt) and ex-con pussycat in a tiger's body Paul Doyle (the surprisingly versatile Dwayne Johnson) in a scheme of kidnapping and extortion that turns both sublimely ridiculous and sickeningly unsavory at practically every turn.This group of meatheads are true bumblers and this lends the film its humorous tone though I assure you that the subject matter of the film is gruesomely dark; it's a little disconcerting that we can laugh at this.  And it is the films unsavory aspects that ultimately bring this film down.  I know that we're supposed to buy into and essentially overlook the horrible actions of these doofuses because they're practically cartoon lampoons and the film's setting is sun-drenched Miami where everyone looks fabulous but these guys are involved in killing and dismembering other people, using large drills and hatchets and saws to hack people (yes, they're already dead at this point but still...) apart.  That's just not a funny thing in my book.The actors portray mostly everyone as possessing the emotional depth of an inflatable kiddie pool (with perhaps the lone exception being that of unlucky victim Kershaw) and it's true that they infuse their performances with a certain dim abandonment (they do a good job).

While never officially on my radar, Pain & Gain, directed by the notoriously hated filmmaker Michael Bay, revamps a bizarre true story about Miami crime, sex, drugs, and bodybuilding to something surprisingly intriguing, hilarious, outlandish, and frankly disturbing.While this might offend some of more established film reviewers, I personally thought the opening scene with Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) exercising and running from the police in slow-motion and on a GoPro HD camera was pure cinematic gold that I could even jump off my chair and dance. In addition, much of the witty dialogue and banter between Wahlberg's psychopathic lust for greed alerts to an audience of how convincing ""crazy"" can be when you know you have so little yet you want to show so much. Dwayne Johnson provides an excellently bizarre, hilarious performance as Paul, a born-again Christian turned vigilante after trying to benefit Lugo's vicious schemes and a comical performance from Anthony Mackie as Adrian and Rebel Wilson playing his perverted admirer/wife as they try to overcome ""impotence.""The film, while inspired by real events and witnessed through a testimonial and confessional lens, should not be taken seriously! As a whole, the film works much like a Guy Ritchie film on drugs amped for American audiences with the stop-and-start talking and gruesome, graphic violence found in a Quentin Tarantino dark comedy. What Bay has created was a film, unlike the Transformers films, that is believable, relatable, and unsettling all at once to where the criminality being sensationalised is now seen as fictional entertainment and make-believe. His knackery for cinematography, electronic dance music and hip-hop (including a clever use of Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise), 1990s kitsch (especially big phones and pompous scene design), and action is all there and it did not disappoint too much in dark crime comedies like RocknRolla (a Guy Ritchie film which was legitimately terrible) or Nobel Son (one of the worst thrillers made in recent memory) but more like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Layer Cake, Reservoir Dogs, and In Bruges.While he is often mentioned as commercialistic, soulless, and politically incorrect, this film only amps much of this idea of him as an idiot when in actuality, the film was rather smartly done despite its bad press and very inappropriate take on real events. As some people claim this film was a parody or satire on Michael Bay's filmmaking, the perceivable self-mockery or deprecation of the whole two hours and nine minutes (which, in my opinion, went for too long and the film is better seen in small doses than as a whole) is probably better than if it was all the way serious for it won't make it stand out.
