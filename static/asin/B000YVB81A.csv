The sound was terrible, sometimes it was hard to hear and understand what anyone was saying. The actors in this movie did some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I would suggest renting this movie instead of buying it that is for sure. This must have been and extremely low budget movie so buyers beware.

1120958,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000YVB81A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 3]","Deadhouse (Pablo Maysonet IV, 2005)Deadhouse, according to IMDB, was Maysonet's debut; ""[h]e had never previously shot a film, short or feature, in his life. He attributes DeadHouse's lack of overall quality...to his inexperience at the time."" Which is as good a reason as any, I guess, though I do have to say that I've seen a lot of debut films that were a great deal more accomplished than this one, and so I'm not willing to give Maysonet too much leeway on this. Also, I wish I'd read this IMDB review snippet before seeing the movie: ""If you like Slipknot or [Insane Clown Posse], you'll love this movie."" Which, for all I know, is entirely true. I can't stand either of them, and had I read that, I might have steered clear of this. But I didn't, and so here I am to tell you about it.The plot is about as old as the hills: four teens find themselves faced with a family of twisted, sadistic serial killers who like listening to really, really awful music. (Couldn't they at least develop a taste for Mushroomhead?) In other words, if you've seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you've basically seen this one, though the masks and methods are a bit different, and Maysonet throws in a different twist on the old slaughterhouse routine by making one of the characters a butcher. You might find it worth wasting ninety minutes on if you've seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as many times as you can take and you want a slightly different take on the same movie, but otherwise, you can avoid it. About the only good thing I can say about it is that it's not the worst movie I've seen so far this year. In fact, it's not even in the top ten. It does have a sort of brainless watchability to it, and if you do decide to take the plunge, you'll at least be mildly entertained. I wish I could say that about some of the other cinematic classics I've subjected myself to this year (Forest of the Damned, anyone?) *",1,"It's from Brain Damage Films, you do the math...",1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,1919,"['Deadhouse', 'Pablo', 'Maysonet', 'IV', '2005', 'Deadhouse', 'according', 'IMDB', 'was', 'Maysonet', 'debut', '[', 'h', ']', 'e', 'had', 'never', 'previously', 'film', 'short', 'feature', 'life', 'DeadHouse', 'lack', 'overall', 'quality', 'inexperience', 'time', 'Which', 'as', 'good', 'reason', 'guess', 'do', 'have', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'debut', 'films', 'were', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'accomplished', 'one', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'willing', 'give', 'Maysonet', 'too', 'much', 'leeway', 'Also', 'wish', ""'d"", 'read', 'IMDB', 'review', 'snippet', 'seeing', 'movie', 'like', 'Slipknot', '[', 'Insane', 'Clown', 'Posse', ']', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'Which', 'know', 'entirely', 'true', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'had', 'read', 'might', 'have', 'steered', 'clear', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'here', 'am', 'tell', 'it.The', 'plot', 'as', 'old', 'hills', 'four', 'teens', 'find', 'faced', 'family', 'twisted', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'killers', 'who', 'like', 'listening', 'really', 'really', 'awful', 'music', 'Could', ""n't"", 'least', 'develop', 'taste', 'Mushroomhead', 'other', 'words', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', ""'ve"", 'basically', 'seen', 'one', 'masks', 'methods', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'Maysonet', 'throws', 'different', 'twist', 'old', 'slaughterhouse', 'routine', 'making', 'one', 'characters', 'butcher', 'might', 'find', 'worth', 'wasting', 'ninety', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'take', 'want', 'slightly', 'different', 'take', 'same', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'can', 'avoid', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'top', 'ten', 'have', 'sort', 'brainless', 'watchability', 'do', 'decide', 'take', 'plunge', ""'ll"", 'least', 'be', 'mildly', 'entertained', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'about', 'other', 'cinematic', 'classics', ""'ve"", 'subjected', 'year', 'Forest', 'Damned', 'anyone', '*']",Deadhouse
