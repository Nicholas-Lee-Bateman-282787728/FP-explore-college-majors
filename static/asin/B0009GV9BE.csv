I had no idea what was going on as it was all over the place. The dancers looked good on the screen but I couldn't follow the directions at all.  I just stood there like an idiot with my hands in the air talking to my TV in the hopes they'd help me better understand.

Wrong!  First of all, they go over each move way too quickly for a newcomer to catch on.  Plus, they demonstrate the moves facing the camera so the viewer doesn't know whether to to begin on the left or right foot.Also, the man and woman who demonstrate the moves are rarely in sync.  Half the time, the woman begins and the man has to catch up.  This is really an awful, disappointing DVD.",1,Useless,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,543,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'invited', 'party', 'where', 'line', 'dancing', 'going', 'be', 'featured', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'video', 'learn', 'moves', 'Wrong', 'First', 'go', 'move', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'newcomer', 'catch', 'demonstrate', 'moves', 'facing', 'camera', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'know', 'begin', 'left', 'right', 'foot.Also', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'moves', 'are', 'rarely', 'sync', 'time', 'woman', 'man', 'catch', 'up', 'really', 'awful', 'disappointing', 'DVD']",N/A
