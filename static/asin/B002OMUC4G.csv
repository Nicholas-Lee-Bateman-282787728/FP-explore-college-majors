1281325,AHTO9BXSBU7NN,B002OMUC4G,anonymous,"[0, 0]","The riffs were mostly good, but the movie itself the Cinematic Titanic crew found is very painful to watch more than the Starfighters back in the MST3K days and probably the worst movie ever made. Spoiler alert, there is a scene with almost 8 minutes of nothing happening at the near end; &#34;It's like watching someone else watch Manos (one of the best jokes in this riff).&#34; There is sexism at least in the film itself even thought it was made in the early 1970s and also, there are very incompetent characters. Enjoy if anyone is interested in checking out what is passed off to be a film at all. :)",4,The Worst Movie Ever Riffed On,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,606,"['riffs', 'were', 'mostly', 'good', 'movie', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'crew', 'found', 'very', 'painful', 'watch', 'more', 'Starfighters', 'back', 'MST3K', 'days', 'probably', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'scene', 'almost', '8', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'happening', 'near', 'end', '34', 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'watch', 'Manos', 'one', 'best', 'jokes', 'riff', '34', 'sexism', 'least', 'film', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'made', 'early', '1970s', 'also', 'are', 'very', 'incompetent', 'characters', 'Enjoy', 'anyone', 'interested', 'checking', 'out', 'what', 'passed', 'be', 'film']",Cinematic Titanic Presents: Doomsday Machine

1281327,A2PA9ACXDNHFID,B002OMUC4G,Scott M,"[7, 8]","Cinematic Titanic, Doomsday Machine, (#2)Cinematic Titanic is an off-shoot of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (a.k.a. MST3K).Both were created by Joel Hodgson, and other cast memebers are: Trace Beaulieu (original 'Crow'),J. 'Elvis' Weinstein (1st 'Tom Servo'), Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl (all from MSTK).J. Elvis created the theme song for 'Cinematic', and I really enjoy it.This movie is in color and from 1972.  This is the second DVD offered by Cinematic Titanic ((#2).  I have watched it at least twice and it's still easy to miss (if any) refference to a 'doomsday machine'. Most of this is about a crew on a (USA) spaceship that was launched into space (shot on 'location'?) :)The Riffs on here are Supurb!! (Riffs are comical comments said in-between the dialog.)One of my favorite 'riffs' - ""Why does he need a name tag - alone in space?""and towards the end a riff about 'It's a Wonderful Life' re: Clarance and George Bailey.The trialer for this DVD can be seen on Youtube (as well as other 'Cinematic' Titles).And Cinematic Titanic has it's own website.Total Running Time, 1:26:45There are no (MST3K) 'Bots' in 'Cinematic' - The 5 stand in sillouette.I've seen all the released MST3K's - and this 'Cinematic' is at least as good - if not better. My favorite 'Cinematic' is 'The Oozing Skull', but this one is great too.
