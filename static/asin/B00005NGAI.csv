668466,A3RODEQMP1IY51,B00005NGAI,"Allison Fox ""Film Fanatic & Philosopher""","[11, 12]","I rented this movie like I've rented many movies - RANDOMLY. I had no idea what to expect. I only knew it had something to do with a Rat (obviously). RAT was a very pleasant surprise (love the accents. especially when the wife says ""book"" like ""buke"" haha, maybe I'm just crazy... but so is this movie!!). Hubert Flynn (the rat throughout most of the film) is transformed somehow and goes home to his family. What's weird is the fact that the people in the movie never question that the rat is Hubert. Infact, when we enter into their life, the audience assumes that Huburt the Rat has been there living as a rat for serveral days or even weeks or months! The wife fixes him dinner and talks to him like he's human. They put pillows on his chair at the dinner table so that the rat, um, I mean Hubert, can reach the food. My reasons for liking this movie are simple: It's unique. It's humorous. It's mysterious. You never know what's going to happen next, so it keeps viewers interested! I thought it was very well made and a creative idea for a movie. The ending has a good twist as well. They have an official web site for the movie: rat-themovie dot com. It's a refreshing change compared to all the other movies out today. If you want a few laughs, and want to be in on a ""secret"" movie that a lot of people probably haven't seen ... 'RAT' is certainly a movie you won't soon forget.",5,You want ME to write a Buke?,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,1387,"['rented', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'rented', 'many', 'movies', 'RANDOMLY', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'only', 'knew', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Rat', 'obviously', 'RAT', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'love', 'accents', 'especially', 'when', 'wife', 'book', 'buke', 'haha', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'crazy', 'so', 'movie', 'Hubert', 'Flynn', 'rat', 'most', 'film', 'transformed', 'somehow', 'home', 'family', 'What', 'weird', 'fact', 'people', 'movie', 'never', 'question', 'rat', 'Hubert', 'Infact', 'when', 'enter', 'life', 'audience', 'Huburt', 'Rat', 'been', 'there', 'living', 'rat', 'serveral', 'days', 'even', 'weeks', 'months', 'wife', 'fixes', 'dinner', 'talks', 'human', 'put', 'pillows', 'chair', 'dinner', 'table', 'so', 'rat', 'um', 'mean', 'Hubert', 'can', 'reach', 'food', 'reasons', 'liking', 'movie', 'are', 'simple', 'unique', 'humorous', 'mysterious', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'viewers', 'interested', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'creative', 'idea', 'movie', 'ending', 'good', 'twist', 'well', 'have', 'official', 'web', 'site', 'movie', 'rat-themovie', 'dot', 'com', 'refreshing', 'change', 'compared', 'other', 'movies', 'out', 'today', 'want', 'few', 'laughs', 'want', 'be', 'secret', 'movie', 'lot', 'people', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'certainly', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",Rat
668467,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005NGAI,B. E Jackson,"[1, 6]","This may be perhaps the silliest movie I've ever seen.  The idea of a husband/father turning into a rat is just a strange storyline.  I wouldn't say this movie is necessarily a childrens movie either.  It's more like, well, just a really silly movie that some families might enjoy.I guess it was an okay film.  What I REALLY loved about it was all the really good songs that played throughout the film, which didn't resemble the storyline in any way.  Then again, I'm not Irish, so maybe they did.I think what kind of rubbed me the wrong way about the film was how the other family members continued treating the rat like it was the man of the family, and none of this looked believable at all.  For instance, the wife was determined to get the rat to eat his supper during dinnertime.  I think if someone I knew had turned into a rat, the last thing I'd care about is why they're not eating.I just couldn't get into the movie.",3,feed this movie rat poison,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,927,"['may', 'be', 'perhaps', 'silliest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'idea', 'husband/father', 'turning', 'rat', 'just', 'strange', 'storyline', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'necessarily', 'childrens', 'movie', 'more', 'well', 'just', 'really', 'silly', 'movie', 'families', 'might', 'enjoy.I', 'guess', 'was', 'okay', 'film', 'What', 'REALLY', 'loved', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'songs', 'played', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'storyline', 'way', 'Then', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'Irish', 'so', 'maybe', 'did.I', 'think', 'what', 'kind', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'continued', 'treating', 'rat', 'was', 'man', 'family', 'none', 'looked', 'believable', 'instance', 'wife', 'was', 'determined', 'get', 'rat', 'eat', 'supper', 'dinnertime', 'think', 'someone', 'knew', 'had', 'turned', 'rat', 'last', 'thing', ""'d"", 'care', 'about', 'why', ""'re"", 'not', 'eating.I', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie']",Rat

668471,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005NGAI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Rat (Steve Barron, 2000)Not at all what I was expecting, I must say. Rat is billed as a family comedy, but I'm not sure that either ""family"" or ""comedy"" is an accurate assessment here. It's got humor, certainly, but it's the blackest of humors. And I'd have thought this a decidedly adult comedy, not because there's all that much content that's inappropriate for the kiddies, but because the way it's approached is a bit on the subtle side; I'm not sure the kiddies would find it interesting enough. As an adult black comedy, however, it's worth your time.Hubert (Pete Postlethwaite) is a typical guy; he's not terribly happy in his marriage, his job is less than fulfilling, and he likes the odd pint at the end of the day. He comes home from the pub one night, just as every other night, goes to bed, and when he wakes up in the morning, he's a rat. Needless to say, his wife Conchita (Imelda Staunton) is less than pleased. The news spreads, and eventually the entire town knows. A family discussion leads to a possible solution, but whose best interest is it in, ultimately?Wesley Burrowes (Mystics) is known for his black comedies, and Rat is no exception to the rule. Barron (Electric Dreams) usually works in more mainstream comedies, but he was a fine choice to helm this; he gets good performances out of the entire cast, he adapts well to the darker tone of the material, and the finished product is well-paced and watchable. Send the kiddies to bed and watch this one by yourselves. *** ",4,A nice surprise.,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,1499,"['Rat', 'Steve', 'Barron', '2000', 'Not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'must', 'say', 'Rat', 'billed', 'family', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'family', 'comedy', 'accurate', 'assessment', 'here', 'got', 'humor', 'certainly', 'blackest', 'humors', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'decidedly', 'adult', 'comedy', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'content', 'inappropriate', 'kiddies', 'way', 'approached', 'bit', 'subtle', 'side', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'kiddies', 'would', 'find', 'interesting', 'enough', 'adult', 'black', 'comedy', 'however', 'time.Hubert', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'typical', 'guy', 'not', 'terribly', 'happy', 'marriage', 'job', 'less', 'fulfilling', 'odd', 'pint', 'end', 'day', 'home', 'pub', 'one', 'night', 'just', 'other', 'night', 'bed', 'when', 'up', 'morning', 'rat', 'Needless', 'say', 'wife', 'Conchita', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'less', 'pleased', 'news', 'spreads', 'eventually', 'entire', 'town', 'knows', 'family', 'discussion', 'possible', 'solution', 'best', 'interest', 'ultimately', 'Wesley', 'Burrowes', 'Mystics', 'known', 'black', 'comedies', 'Rat', 'exception', 'rule', 'Barron', 'Electric', 'Dreams', 'usually', 'more', 'mainstream', 'comedies', 'was', 'fine', 'choice', 'helm', 'good', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'well', 'darker', 'tone', 'material', 'finished', 'product', 'well-paced', 'watchable', 'Send', 'kiddies', 'bed', 'watch', 'one', 'yourselves', '***']",Rat

I've always liked Pete Postlethwaite (is that the way you spell it?)...he's got a craggy charisma I've enjoyed since Alien3 (yes I was one of the four people who loved that movie)This movie has little other than Pete and puppets in common with Alien3. (The Hensons were part of the production team so you know the puppets in Rat are well done!)This is a funny Irish fantasy that Roald Dahl might have written. Man turns into a rat & his family get together with a smarmy writer to turn their misfortune into a bestseller...laugh out loud rat chases ensue...there is also a lot of rat (fake rat of course) abuse and outrageousness.The DVD extras are also quite fun. There's a making of featurette with the whole cast (rats included) laughing up to the camera...and a casting call for rats. WELL worth the price of the DVD.

The humour in this movie comes mainly from the cool manner in which people react to extraordinary events, and from the contorted, but strangely obvious logic they employ. For example, in one scene they get a doctor to check up on Hubert.  The doctor enters the room and remarks that there is a rat wearing a jacket in the bed.  He is told that the rat is Hubert, and upon hearing this he slowly nods his head and makes a quiet, understanding remark like ""Oh, I see."" In any case, Rat is incredibly funny, and the concept of the film is entirely original. In the end, we even get a sense of understanding of why Hubert turned into a rat in the first place, and it makes complete sense.
