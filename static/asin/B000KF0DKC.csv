I'm consigning it to recycle.  If you like to watch self-absorbed people making agonizing choices in a virtually plotless film, this is the movie for you.",2,You Are Alone,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,287,"['amazingly', 'depressing', 'movie', 'would', 'rather', 'wind', 'duct', 'tape', 'head', 'pull', 'off', 'slowly', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', ""'m"", 'consigning', 'recycle', 'like', 'watch', 'self-absorbed', 'people', 'making', 'agonizing', 'choices', 'virtually', 'plotless', 'film', 'movie']",You Are Alone
1033344,ANRWZEICI5ZY0,B000KF0DKC,"D. F. Curran ""dfcurran""","[1, 1]","I had actually considered investing in this movie when Gorman was outdrumming up funding. I loved most of the script but did not like theending. Gorman insisted the ending was as it had to be.Seeing the completed movie I have to say I am amazed. Reading thescript I had not imagined the acting (and Gorman's directing) would beas powerful and moving as it is here. The two leads did an amazing job.They were very believable and this movie is well worth watching justfor the performances of these two amazing stars.Now, for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please don'tread further as you need to see the movie first. (I actually wish I hadnever read the script just so I could have experienced the movie endingfirst hand.)WARNING: This is not a movie for young teenage girls as it makes prostitution look attractive.----------------------------- SPOILERI have two main problems with the movie. First off, and I'm sure Imentioned this when I read the script, the wife should have died. Ifshe were dead the ending would be much more believable. As it is, wehave this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him 'yearsago.' If she left him and he is still in love after so long he'd haveto be seriously delusional. But he doesn't come across that way in themovie. (There is also the problem of why he did not expend all thisenergy going after the wife he still loves.)Plus, if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe thatthey had a fulfilling, reciprocating love, and therefore believe thatthe guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonable.However, I don't buy Daphne doing what she does in the ending. I'd needa heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (verynaive for a whore but believable due to Bohl's performance) did whatshe did. The character is simply not cold enough. And if she did thisout of some kind of love, or something else, then there is a wholepiece of the movie/story missing.Much of this movie is reminiscent of ""Sex, Lies, and Video Tape."" Ithink it could have been as popular if Gorman had chosen to give themovie a more believable ending.So watch the movie, enjoy the performance. And make up your own mind.",5,Fantastic acting and direction but the ending ??????,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,2196,"['had', 'actually', 'considered', 'investing', 'movie', 'when', 'Gorman', 'was', 'outdrumming', 'up', 'funding', 'loved', 'most', 'script', 'did', 'not', 'theending', 'Gorman', 'insisted', 'ending', 'was', 'had', 'be.Seeing', 'completed', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'amazed', 'Reading', 'thescript', 'had', 'not', 'imagined', 'acting', 'Gorman', 'directing', 'would', 'beas', 'powerful', 'moving', 'here', 'two', 'leads', 'did', 'amazing', 'job.They', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'justfor', 'performances', 'two', 'amazing', 'stars.Now', 'spoiler', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'please', ""don'tread"", 'further', 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'actually', 'wish', 'hadnever', 'read', 'script', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'experienced', 'movie', 'endingfirst', 'hand', 'WARNING', 'not', 'movie', 'young', 'teenage', 'girls', 'prostitution', 'look', 'attractive.', 'SPOILERI', 'have', 'two', 'main', 'problems', 'movie', 'First', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Imentioned', 'when', 'read', 'script', 'wife', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'Ifshe', 'were', 'dead', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'wehave', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'agonizing', 'woman', 'who', 'left', ""'yearsago"", 'left', 'still', 'love', 'so', 'long', ""'d"", 'haveto', 'be', 'seriously', 'delusional', ""n't"", 'come', 'way', 'themovie', 'also', 'problem', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'expend', 'thisenergy', 'going', 'wife', 'still', 'wife', 'were', 'dead', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'able', 'believe', 'thatthey', 'had', 'fulfilling', 'reciprocating', 'love', 'therefore', 'believe', 'thatthe', 'guy', 'devastated', 'enough', 'ending', 'be', 'reasonable.However', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Daphne', 'doing', 'what', 'ending', ""'d"", 'needa', 'heck', 'lot', 'convincing', 'believe', 'naive', 'girl', 'verynaive', 'whore', 'believable', 'due', 'Bohl', 'performance', 'did', 'whatshe', 'did', 'character', 'simply', 'not', 'cold', 'enough', 'did', 'thisout', 'kind', 'love', 'something', 'else', 'then', 'wholepiece', 'movie/story', 'missing.Much', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Video', 'Tape', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'popular', 'Gorman', 'had', 'chosen', 'give', 'themovie', 'more', 'believable', 'ending.So', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind']",You Are Alone
1033345,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B000KF0DKC,dooby,"[10, 10]","This is a tiny independent film. It is a talky. There is little action, minimal nudity and no sex. But it grabs your attention and holds you spellbound from beginning to end.Daphne is a Yale-bound, high-school girl turning tricks, not so much for the cash, but for the company. Buddy is the middle-aged next-door neighbour who catches her at it and blackmails her into entertaining him instead. His motives however are slightly less sleazy than that. They are both lost and lonely souls trying to find someone to connect with. When he calls her over, he immediately hands her a suitcase full of cash but insists that he doesn't want to have sex with her. They just talk and that is pretty much all that happens throughout. The film is very well written and very well acted. Jessica Bohl deservedly won the Best Actress awards at several Indie festivals for this film. In fact, she ad-libbed so many of her lines and did it so naturally that director Gorman Bechard ended up giving her co-writing credit. Bit by bit, we learn why she turns tricks and why he's so lonely and depressed. We also get to hear about all the kinky things her clients ask her to do - like the priest who pays $500 for a golden shower, or Mr Chang who pays to ""dine at the Y"" and ""toss her salad"" and likens her taste to that of sweet-and-sour chicken. The dialogue gets bawdy and quite hilarious at times but as we learn from the commentary, most of the funniest lines were deleted because they made the film overly funny. And the director's aim was far from that. The resultant film is restrained, sombre, and ultimately very sad. The director uses the word depressing quite a few times, especially in his commentary over the deleted scenes. Personally I don't feel it is depressing. But I do agree with him that the film works best this way, shorn of its ribald humour. It is indeed a beautifully sad film about how painful, loneliness can be, and the lengths people will go to find relief. Fortunately, all those deleted scenes are preserved on this DVD.The film was shot using just 2 Panasonic mini-DV cameras (AG-DVX100A) so don't expect brilliant picture quality. The transfer looks very good considering its source. It's presented in 1.78:1 widescreen (anamorphic). There is some lovely cinematography here, including some that ended up on the cutting room floor. However much I disliked the occasional shaky camerawork, Bechard explains on the commentary why he wanted them that way and what he wanted to convey by them. Colours are sombre and muted but accurate. Black levels are about what you'd expect of a mini-DV movie. Amazingly no colour-correction was done due to budget constraints. So what you see onscreen is the direct output of the mini-DV camera. Sound is in 2.0 Dolby Surround. Dialogue is always clear and the various music tracks are well presented. There are 16 music tracks in all, many previously unreleased, from the likes of Tywanna Jo Baskette, Matt Ryan and Crooked Fingers. No subtitles are provided.There is an engaging and very informative full-length audio commentary from director Gorman Bechard. There are 13 minutes worth of deleted scenes with and without commentary which are definitely worth watching. My favourites were the mother's comic-relief sequences which were all deleted, especially her delivery of those 3 classic questions ""that parents should never ask their daughters"". There are two theatrical trailers and the music video of Strays Don't Sleep's ""Cars and History"". Another lovely track is Tywanna's ""The Girl You Hate"". Also included on the DVD is Bechard's earlier short film, ""The Pretty Girl"". However for some strange reason, this 6-minute film is not in standard DVD format but in Apple-Quicktime and AVI format so that it's only playable on a Mac or PC. The complete shooting script is also included in Adobe PDF format. A very cute inclusion was Jessica Bohl's resume (in PDF format), detailing her acting, sporting and school qualifications, including her GPA, her typing speed and her knowledge of computers, as well as the fact that she is knowledgeable in Swedish and Spanish and studied at both Wesleyan and Stockholm Universities, graduating with a B.A. in 2002. Sorry guys, no phone number.PS. With her blonde hair dyed brown, Jessica Bohl bears more than a passing resemblance to the young Katie Holmes.",5,"Lovely, Sad Film about Two Lonely People...

1033346,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B000KF0DKC,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Striking, intelligent micro budget film about loneliness, as capturedduring an afternoon encounter between a Yale bound high school seniorwho's a prostitute in her spare time, and an older, depressed neighbor.Both the film and the two generally excellent lead performances (byunknowns Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage) do get stagy at times. Thefilm takes place largely in one room. And I wish I didn't see the twistending coming. In fact, I sort of wish it wasn't there at all. Whileit almost works, I didn't think the film needed it, and it felt tackedon, as if from another, more conventionally 'dramatic' film.The film is at it's best when it's dealing in simple emotional honesty,and the complexity of these characters lives. That's where this filmshines - in avoiding the clich&eacute;s we've come to expect in two characterslike this. She may be living a dark existence, but she's gettingsomething from it too. He's a man who can't let himself even indulge infantasy, and it's part of why he's so blocked as a human being.For a film that's all about sex and sexuality, it's surprisinglychaste, while still having uncomfortable erotic overtones and questions- both for the characters and the audience. Are we sick for havingmoments when this young girl turns us on? Is she sick for enjoying thatpower?I also appreciated that the dialogue is often elliptical, and thatsilence is as important as words.Not quite a great film, but an impressive effort to do somethingoriginal.",4,Impressive micro-budget drama,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,1480,"['Striking', 'intelligent', 'micro', 'budget', 'film', 'loneliness', 'capturedduring', 'afternoon', 'encounter', 'Yale', 'bound', 'high', 'school', 'seniorwho', 'prostitute', 'spare', 'time', 'older', 'depressed', 'film', 'two', 'generally', 'excellent', 'lead', 'performances', 'byunknowns', 'Jessica', 'Bohl', 'Richard', 'Brundage', 'do', 'get', 'stagy', 'times', 'Thefilm', 'place', 'largely', 'one', 'room', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'twistending', 'coming', 'fact', 'sort', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'Whileit', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'needed', 'felt', 'tackedon', 'more', 'conventionally', ""'dramatic"", 'film.The', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'dealing', 'simple', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'complexity', 'characters', 'lives', 'where', 'avoiding', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'two', 'characterslike', 'may', 'be', 'living', 'dark', 'existence', 'gettingsomething', 'too', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'even', 'indulge', 'infantasy', 'part', 'why', 'so', 'blocked', 'human', 'being.For', 'film', 'sex', 'sexuality', 'surprisinglychaste', 'still', 'having', 'uncomfortable', 'erotic', 'overtones', 'questions-', 'characters', 'audience', 'Are', 'sick', 'havingmoments', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'sick', 'enjoying', 'thatpower', 'also', 'appreciated', 'dialogue', 'often', 'elliptical', 'thatsilence', 'as', 'important', 'words.Not', 'great', 'film', 'impressive', 'effort', 'do', 'somethingoriginal']",You Are Alone
