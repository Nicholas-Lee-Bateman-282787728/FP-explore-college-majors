I actually find it to be better bare footed.  I would call this a muscle and strength work out and a super nice cool down at the end.  It has become one of my favorite DVD's when I am in the mood for a decent workout without the heart pounding.",5,Great workout without being crazy.,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,373,"['real', 'great', 'workout', 'not', 'high', 'impact', 'sure', 'work', 'out', 'body', 'equipment', 'required', 'not', 'even', 'shoes', 'actually', 'find', 'be', 'better', 'bare', 'footed', 'would', 'call', 'muscle', 'strength', 'work', 'out', 'super', 'nice', 'cool', 'down', 'end', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'when', 'am', 'mood', 'decent', 'workout', 'heart', 'pounding']",Willpower and Grace: Move With Integrity With Stacey Lei Krauss

It's the first dvd I have of Stacey's but I really like it and based on this one, I'd definately buy more of hers down the track.After a 15 minute warmup, there is floor aerobics for about 18 minutes, then nice stretches and then to finish off, there is floor toning.  It's tough, but fun because you have to challenge yourself.  The cardio section is using a lot (A LOT) of squats and lunges, and the arm movements are optional (you'll see why when you try this for yourself).  The floor workout at the end is a lot of pilates movements so that's good for your core, making this a complete workout to get your heart pumping and your fat burning.  I highly recommend this, because it's definately going to give you results.  I've seen them already even after 12 days.  I like this alot.",5,Really good ;-),1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,812,"['great', 'workout', 'first', 'dvd', 'have', 'Stacey', 'really', 'based', 'one', ""'d"", 'definately', 'buy', 'more', 'hers', 'down', 'track.After', '15', 'minute', 'warmup', 'floor', 'aerobics', '18', 'minutes', 'then', 'nice', 'stretches', 'then', 'finish', 'off', 'floor', 'toning', 'tough', 'fun', 'have', 'challenge', 'cardio', 'section', 'using', 'lot', 'A', 'LOT', 'squats', 'lunges', 'arm', 'movements', 'are', 'optional', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'when', 'try', 'floor', 'workout', 'end', 'lot', 'pilates', 'movements', 'good', 'core', 'making', 'complete', 'workout', 'get', 'heart', 'pumping', 'fat', 'burning', 'highly', 'recommend', 'definately', 'going', 'give', 'results', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'even', '12', 'days', 'alot']",Willpower and Grace: Move With Integrity With Stacey Lei Krauss
951999,A2F7UCDYPS7YBA,B000BWHEBA,Michelle Lee,"[0, 0]","I LOVE willPower & grace - as an experienced exerciser, I really look for a challenge with fitness DVD's. This does not disappoint.  And, as a staunch critic of fitness DVD programs, I feel this combines the most effective exercises from multiple exercise programs to create a well-calculated, well-balanced toning and strengthening workout that also enhances endurance and increases mind-body awareness.Yes, it really does ALL of that.The warm up is quick-paced but really does what its supposed to - warms up your muscles and provides dynamic stretching to help loosen you up. The cardio segment, truly, is ALL squats and lunges - I personally LOVE this, but if you have bad knees or a weak lower back, this would definitely be a segment you should watch before doing.Both the warm-up and cardio segments also feature several exercises that help improve balance - an element too many exercises programs do not emphasize.  Your feet will not know what hit them - you will need to use those toes and even the arches in your feet to maintain your posture and keep you standing.  The real benefit of barefoot training!The stretching segment is a good segue to the core routine - my FAVORITE part of the program. There are only a few basic exercises in the core segment but they WORK. Even though they are differentiated as spine strengtheners, ab strengtheners, etc., essentially all the exercises are interrelated and keep your entire core working with each one.  You will learn to embrace plank and bridge with as much love and respect as I have.The entire program is a little over an hour, but it really breezes by if you focus on the technical execution of the exercises and PUSH yourself - it is definitely a program where the benefits your receive reflect the effort you put into the workout.  You will feel energized from this - not exhausted!

952000,A3N4ZOH7VUFH2Z,B000BWHEBA,Rina Perez,"[0, 0]","I was sore for days after I finished 3/4's of the routine the first time I tried it [skipped the core part because I didn't have time]. The next time I did it and finished the whole thing, my body was aching bad for days [again]. I like it though-'coz I know I'd feel worked out after I'm done with it but days later, I'd still have a hard time walking and climbing the stairs. My thighs and buns were sore. It's very different. Just 10 min. into it and I was already feeling it and starting to break a sweat. NO jumping around but LOTS of squats/lunges on the cardio part and I was breathing hard. The poses on the core part were so long and I'd be shaking. A good DVD to include in my collection. You could take this on vacations 'coz there are no equipment required. I gave it just 4 stars because I recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge but I don't do this a lot because I'm kinda scared of the challenge....weird but true. Maybe I should do this more often so the soreness would eventually go away. I found this harder than Billy Blanks' Bootcamp or Jari Love's DVDs. I'd do Leslie Sansone's DVDs the next days just to recover from Stacey's routine....",4,I was sore for days.....,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,1164,"['was', 'sore', 'days', 'finished', '3/4', 'routine', 'first', 'time', 'tried', '[', 'skipped', 'core', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', ']', 'next', 'time', 'did', 'finished', 'whole', 'thing', 'body', 'was', 'aching', 'bad', 'days', '[', 'again', ']', ""though-'coz"", 'know', ""'d"", 'feel', 'worked', 'out', ""'m"", 'done', 'days', 'later', ""'d"", 'still', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'walking', 'climbing', 'stairs', 'thighs', 'buns', 'were', 'sore', 'very', 'different', 'Just', '10', 'min', 'was', 'already', 'feeling', 'starting', 'break', 'sweat', 'NO', 'jumping', 'around', 'LOTS', 'squats/lunges', 'cardio', 'part', 'was', 'breathing', 'hard', 'poses', 'core', 'part', 'were', 'so', 'long', ""'d"", 'be', 'shaking', 'good', 'DVD', 'include', 'collection', 'could', 'take', 'vacations', 'are', 'equipment', 'required', 'gave', 'just', '4', 'stars', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'challenge', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'scared', 'challenge', '.weird', 'true', 'Maybe', 'should', 'do', 'more', 'often', 'so', 'soreness', 'would', 'eventually', 'go', 'away', 'found', 'harder', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'Bootcamp', 'Jari', 'Love', 'DVDs', ""'d"", 'do', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'DVDs', 'next', 'days', 'just', 'recover', 'Stacey', 'routine']",Willpower and Grace: Move With Integrity With Stacey Lei Krauss

I thought I was advanced with the heavy duty cardio and weight lifting (lots of Cathe stuff) I've been doing, but this workout had me crying for mercy!  It's fun, it's ultra challenging and totally different than anything I've ever done!  The cardio portion is only 17 min. long, but the 15 min. warm up before hand is no walk in the park.  If you put some effort into the warm up, you could definitely consider it cardio, giving you 32 min. of cardio.  The core work at the end is no traditional crunches and lifts.  Some tough plank work, stability work on all fours, a deceptively easy-looking dead bug series, and some bridge work at the end that had me shaking! Throughout, there are yoga moves and a lot of balancing work.  The entire workout is done barefoot, which actually makes it more challenging to keep your balance and stability.  Stacey and her crew show three levels of each exercise, so it's do-able for anyone, but beginners will definitely be working extra hard!  All in all, a well rounded workout, which is a good addition to your routine if you're mostly doing traditional stuff.  Makes you realize how many muscles you have that you maybe aren't working.  Beware, though, it is different, so if you're not into that, you may not like it.  Also, there are plenty of squats in the warm up and cardio portions, but they are actually fun!

Unfortunately, the cardio section relies SO heavily on variations of lunges and squats that I had to subtract 2 stars. My knees were swollen and sore after that section, and I found myself longing for a more balanced effect.  Why not up intensity by adding some upper body, too? Plus, the last part of my body where I need to add more bulk is my thighs.  Check out the exercisers in the video - it looks to me like they have over-developed their quads and hams. No thanks.
