838779,A2RY3JWNMSREMD,B0002KPIRI,Kristina,"[38, 39]","Static/Virgil Hawkins really has to be the first African-American superhero that we've ever really had to look up to. I really like this show. It's creative and deals with important issues and politics, but in an easy format that kids can understand. The show even takes the leap into dealing with topics like racism and high school gun shooting. Virgil Hawkin has lost his mother because of gang violence and is now being raised by his dad and his older sister Sharon. His best friend is Richie Foley (who later on in the series, has a much more important role.)My only complaint is that this DVD only contains the first six episodes of the series. I wish that it would had been the release of season one rather than just a few episodes. You can get so much more on one disk these days. I would love to see a completed set of all four seasons on DVD someday, or at least volume two for season one.",4,An Electric Superheroe,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,898,"['Static/Virgil', 'Hawkins', 'really', 'be', 'first', 'African-American', 'superhero', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'really', 'had', 'look', 'up', 'really', 'show', 'creative', 'deals', 'important', 'issues', 'politics', 'easy', 'format', 'kids', 'can', 'understand', 'show', 'even', 'leap', 'dealing', 'topics', 'racism', 'high', 'school', 'gun', 'shooting', 'Virgil', 'Hawkin', 'lost', 'mother', 'gang', 'violence', 'now', 'being', 'raised', 'dad', 'older', 'sister', 'Sharon', 'best', 'friend', 'Richie', 'Foley', 'who', 'later', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'role', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'only', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'series', 'wish', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'release', 'season', 'one', 'rather', 'just', 'few', 'episodes', 'can', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'disk', 'days', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'completed', 'set', 'four', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'someday', 'least', 'volume', 'two', 'season', 'one']",Static Shock: Vol. 1 - The New Kid

838783,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B0002KPIRI,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[3, 3]","Being a fan of the Milestone Comic universe, Static Shock was one of my favorite shows. I taped every episode from season 1 to the finale in season four and i've been waiting for the DVD to come out since the show ended in 2004. But only six Episodes??? Come on WB. This show deserves the treatment you gave Justice Leauge, Batman Beyond and Batman: The Animated Series. As a part of the Timmverse, It belongs in the DC comics Classic collection with each individual season on two discs with all 13 episodes. That being said, I love this show and it's one of the best cartoons to come along in recent years.Static Shock is about a Virgil Hawkins, a 14 year old kid who is in the vein of Spider-man. A good kid dealing with teenage problems, he's bullied by  F-Stop (Hotstreak).  A gang offers him protection and a gun and he heads to the big bang. Not willing to commit murder he throws the gun they give him into the river. Witnessing the big bang, virgil owartches as  police, throw tear gas into the crowd, that causes the teenagers to mutate. From this gas Virgil gains superpowers. He and his friend Ritchie develop a Static, a secret identity so he can use his powers. In his Static idetity he takes on F-stop and saves the day. That's the gist of the first episode. every episode after gets even better.This show is is easier for younger kids to watch than Batman or justice league. The violence is toned down significantly, and It's more kid freindly in its writing and that's a good thing; not every superhero show need to be so serious. Remember superheroes are supposed to be FUN.Static shoock the Show is Shawn james five star Essential Tv Show. This release on the other hand isn't.
