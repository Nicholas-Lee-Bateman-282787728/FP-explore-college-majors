Sure there's a couple of boob shots, but is that worth ten bucks and 90 minutes of your time?  If you need to see a boob, there's about 5 billion web sites with free boob pictures.  This movie contains, I'll be generous here, about 2 minutes total of boob shots (most of which are provided by local strippers, with poorly done boob jobs and nipple rings....thankfully they covered up the cigarette burns or stab wounds these girls probably had).The production value of this film is sub-par and feels like a cheaply-made student film.  (primary example...the funeral scene is a poorly done green-screen in front of a still shot of a cemetery.  Yes, they couldn't even afford to shoot outside.Clearly shot on video, with actors culled from the production company's Facebook friend list, this weak attempt at a ""parody"" of 80's T'n'A films generates zero laughs and zero ingenuity.  The plot has been done about 300 times over the years (money grubbing brother wants to sell the family business, schlubby friendly other brother wants to keep it and is given 3 months to raise X amount of dollars).  There's nothing fresh or new in this film.  And for a comedy, I do expect a joke or two that lands.  I didn't even accidentally laugh at this one.I was a fan of movies like this in the 80's, because at least they had some semblance of production values and real actors.  But this film is clearly someone's pet project shot with friends and family on a commercial HDV camera.(And anyone who attacks the other reviewers saying ""this film doesn't promise to be a nudie movie!""  Um, the name is ""Bazookas The Movie"", has cleavage covering over half of the cover, with plunging necklines on the other girls on the cover, and has a big red-stamped ""unrated"" over the boobs.  Give me a break.  You know what you were selling...and you didn't deliver.This film is garbage, plain and simple.",1,ABOUT AS BAD AS THEY COME...,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,2128,"['Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'higher', '1', 'star', 'clearly', 'works', 'production', 'company', 'friends', 'writer/editor/producer/director', 'same', 'guy', 'shockingly', 'and/or', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'value', 'Sure', 'couple', 'boob', 'shots', 'worth', 'ten', 'bucks', '90', 'minutes', 'time', 'need', 'see', 'boob', '5', 'billion', 'web', 'sites', 'free', 'boob', 'pictures', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'generous', 'here', '2', 'minutes', 'total', 'boob', 'shots', 'most', 'are', 'provided', 'local', 'strippers', 'poorly', 'done', 'boob', 'jobs', 'nipple', 'rings', '.thankfully', 'covered', 'up', 'cigarette', 'stab', 'wounds', 'girls', 'probably', 'had', '.The', 'production', 'value', 'film', 'sub-par', 'feels', 'cheaply-made', 'student', 'film', 'primary', 'example', 'funeral', 'scene', 'poorly', 'done', 'green-screen', 'front', 'still', 'shot', 'cemetery', 'Yes', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'afford', 'shoot', 'outside.Clearly', 'shot', 'video', 'actors', 'culled', 'production', 'company', 'Facebook', 'friend', 'list', 'weak', 'attempt', 'parody', '80', 'T', 'n', 'films', 'generates', 'zero', 'laughs', 'zero', 'ingenuity', 'plot', 'been', 'done', '300', 'times', 'years', 'money', 'grubbing', 'brother', 'sell', 'family', 'business', 'schlubby', 'friendly', 'other', 'brother', 'keep', 'given', '3', 'months', 'raise', 'X', 'amount', 'dollars', 'nothing', 'fresh', 'new', 'film', 'comedy', 'do', 'expect', 'joke', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'accidentally', 'laugh', 'one.I', 'was', 'fan', 'movies', '80', 'least', 'had', 'semblance', 'production', 'values', 'real', 'actors', 'film', 'clearly', 'someone', 'pet', 'project', 'shot', 'friends', 'family', 'commercial', 'HDV', 'camera', 'anyone', 'who', 'other', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'film', ""n't"", 'promise', 'be', 'nudie', 'movie', 'Um', 'name', 'Bazookas', 'Movie', 'cleavage', 'covering', 'half', 'cover', 'plunging', 'necklines', 'other', 'girls', 'cover', 'big', 'red-stamped', 'unrated', 'boobs', 'Give', 'break', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'selling', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver.This', 'film', 'garbage', 'plain', 'simple']",N/A

It had pretty good production values for such a true independent filmmaker. The characters where endearing, yet funny. The stereotyping was fine, it didn't take away from the plot or the intent of the movie. I want to see a part two. I was thinking of way to help Angus the whole time. I will definitely look for more films by them, and just hope and wish upon a star that we can see more of the actress whole played the gym's accontant on screen. I don't mean the nudity either, although there wasn't much and they didn't use it gratituously. Overall I gave it a four out of five, because frankly I wanted more of the accountant on screen. This is definitely something to check out if you don't mind the low budget stuff, it's kind of in that realm of risky business for fast times at ridgemont high.

Angus (Vinny Duwe) is the good son trying to keep the business going and Judah (Sean R. Brooks) is the weasel of an older brother trying to sabotage the gym so he can sell it! The two brothers make a bet that will give control of the gym over to the winner and that's where the movie really shines!Angus enlists his employees (Angela Cohen, Nicole Galati, Jason J. Michael, Roberto Lombardi & Steven Nelson) to help him save the gym by introducing some sexy new classes and promotions, while Judah plots to destroy it with his henchmen (Joseph Campellone and Omar Portilla) by sabotage!The DVD package is 100% satisfying with a behind the scenes photo montage, directors commentary and a blooper reel that's just as funny as the movie itself! Not to mention how top notch the cinematography and the amazing music is in this movie!Bazookas is total slapstick, college humor in the vein of Porky's or Old School and is just as good (if not better) than most!

It was fun and we thought the finished film was really funny. But I'm sure to everyone else who saw it the movie probably really stunk. That's sort of how this movie is, except that no one had to pay to watch my awful movie.""Bazookas"" is about a gym that is in danger of going out of business. Two brothers have inherited it from their father who died while watching a beautiful topless woman play raquetball. One of the brothers wants to sell the gym to a developer to be torn down and turned into a high-rise. The other brother wants to keep it going. They make a bet to decide who gets to do what they want with the gym. The rest of the movie consists of scenes relating to one brother, and several occasionally topless women, trying to keep the gym in business while the other brother and his henchmen sabotage his efforts.The movie is odd in that everyone in the cast is well over 30 and yet there is a lot of nudity. I suppose I expected a movie with so much nudity to have younger, better-looking people in the cast. Anyway, it isn't the worst movie that I ever saw, ""Goonies"" holds that prize, but it isn't worth much either. I'm guessing it cost them less than $1000 to make this film.
