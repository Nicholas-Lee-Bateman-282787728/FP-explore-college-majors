You have to be able to see the humor in just about everything to like Tosh's stand up. His unique in how one joke always flows into the next, yet there's no real story to his lines. He's not up on stage telling about something funny that happened to him on his way to the airport. His lines come off like that sarcastic friend who's always off in his own head thinking about something else entirely than what is currently the topic at hand.His comedy will offend every kind of group out there, and that's pretty much the point. His jokes are meant to shock and cause you to laugh at all the things you know you're not supposed to. There is nothing in this film appropriate for kids of any age. He swears and talk about things that would make a porn star blush.What I like about his stand up show over his TV show is this is all his material and there's no videos of anyone doing anything sick on YouTube. I think Tosh is hysterical, but I can't watch Tosh.0 because of the America's Funniest Home Videos rejects clips he shows. Half of them make you want to gag or at least ruin the idea of eating anything for the rest of the day.

His jokes are short and witty and make me absolutely crack up.  We have watched this dvd several times and I laugh at the same parts each and every time.  Tosh's delivery is phenomenal.I like to think that his comedy is for the intellectually savy. Most of his jokes start out hitting a large % of the audience and as he goes on less of the audience is following him until there is a small % of people that are still cracking up! Some of his jokes are intellectually hilarious while others are the run of the mill ethnocentric based humor.I recommend this full length dvd to anyone who saw clips of Tosh on comedy central or other stand up spotlights on the artist- Worth the buck!

Tosh has worked this material to perfection; the timing is spot on, the delivery is expert, and he works the line that has you squirming AND laughing.For me, ""Completely Serious"" has to be one of the ten best comedy albums ever. OK, it's a DVD, but I ripped the soundtrack and listen to it on my portable music player. Its software tells me I've heard the album 55 times. I've played the video at least a half dozen times.I recommend this to anyone who's willing to laugh at taboo subjects. If you're familiar with Louis C.K., I'd say the ""willing to offend"" meter deflects similarly for the two, though they are otherwise quite different.

Swanson,"[37, 48]","4.8 starsBy far the best stand-up performance I've seen since Chris Rock's perfect Bigger And Blacker, this is one hour of extremely edgy yet somehow good-natured comedy. Tosh spares nothing and no one, least of all America in general. And he does it all so slyly, with that engaging grin and flashing eyes that say, yeah, you know I'm right, admit it.The material here is twenty minutes longer than what the Comedy Chunnel shows from this dvd. They cut a lot of the best, most over the top bits, so it's a treat to see them here. What really distinguishes Tosh is the intelligence and subtlety of some of his lines. He's skewering all of us, and our selfish society, and does it with so much verve and bonhomie that you hardly notice how deep the cuts go.I enjoy a comedian who can get straight to the heart of things, and Tosh is a master at that already on his first dvd. He's one of the few stand-ups I've seen in years who clearly has the goods in spades, and seems more interested in commenting on his version of the truth than getting easy laughs. He says things that seem so wrong at first, but one quickly realizes what's really wrong is how right he is about our complacency and prejudices.His new show on CC, Tosh.0, is decent, but goes for easy laughs and is nowhere near as funny as this dvd and his earlier cd. Let's hope the tv stardom doesn't derail his excellent stand-up, and that he doesn't go the Rock route and release only one performance every five years.
