716258,A1EPTOYTJ1K2ZM,B00006HBUA,Aaron L.,"[1, 1]","The live-action version of the popular cartoon series is just as good as any animated episode. Matthew Lillard is the most convincing Shaggy that exists in the universe and he totally plays this off to his advantage. His relationship with the computer-animated Scooby is wonderful and really makes the movie. The only real downfall to the movie (and it's a small one)is the fact that i don't really think Freddie Prinze Jr. should have been cast as Fred. I'm sorry, but Freddie Prinze Jr. and blonde hair just don't go together. Besides this one small flaw the movie is very good and i would recommend to anyone.",4,Scooby Doo a delight,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,612,"['live-action', 'version', 'popular', 'cartoon', 'series', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'animated', 'episode', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'most', 'convincing', 'Shaggy', 'universe', 'totally', 'off', 'advantage', 'relationship', 'computer-animated', 'Scooby', 'wonderful', 'really', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'downfall', 'movie', 'small', 'one', 'fact', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'Fred', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'blonde', 'hair', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'together', 'one', 'small', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'i', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone']",Scooby-Doo
716259,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B00006HBUA,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[4, 6]","First of all, my apologies, as this review is based entirely on my personal hopes of what this movie was going to deliver. Other viewers may have found lots of their expectations realised on the screen, but sadly, mine weren't.The makers of the Scooby Doo movie didn't really have to get a lot of things right to make this film a real laugh, yet they managed to do everything wrong. I was really looking forward to seeing my favourite cartoon come to life, but they messed up on all the basic rules of this classic show. First off, the main characters all only have one set of clothes, but the costume designers for the film couldn't even stick to the simple designs of the cartoon, instead they went for hopeless approximations that just look ill-fitting and careless. Worst offender is Daphne, done up in all sorts of lurid fashions and hairdos, looking nothing like the animated original. Same goes for poor Velma with that odd long lanky brown wig and shapeless sweater. Even Fred had several changes of costume and the wrong hairdo. Only Shaggy came across as the real deal, which is probably more of a tribute to Matthew Lillard's dedication rather than the designers.Next rule: There must always be a chase down a never-ending hallway with the same scenery going past over and over again. I think there were some chases in the movie, but nothing that brought this much loved (and much lampooned in the past) feature to the forefront where it should have been (Unless it was during a sequence when I dozed off).Next rule: The monsters must be dumb and easily fooled. Most monsters in the cartoon just went &quot;Graaagghh!&quot; and swiped their arms in thin air as Scooby and co. slipped away from them just in time. The movie monsters are actually quite frightening demons that fly through the air, taking possession of innocent holidaymakers. Frightening is good, but it doesn't belong in this context.Another thing that spoils the mood is surrounding the characters with hundreds of extras and other actors. It just shows up the implausibility of the whole gang ever passing for real people. This could have worked hilariously as a parody (a device that worked beautifully for the Brady Bunch Movie), but here it just makes the characters look thoroughly underdeveloped. They can't possibly interact with naturalistic &quot;real-life&quot; characters, only with similarly 2-dimensional ciphers like cackling crones, disgruntled sherrifs or sinister butlers.Next up, the characterisation. Again, Matthew Lillard steals the show as Shaggy, and truly breathes life into the part. Fred and Velma are boring and under developed, but that kind of reflects the cartoon, so no big deal there, although Velma could have been given more to get her teeth into. Worst of all, again, is Daphne, demonstrated by the insertion of the blatantly inappropriate &quot;Daphne does martial arts&quot; sequence. If Sarah Michelle Gellar can't stay away from playing Buffy, she shouldn't be considered for other movies. She certainly shouldn't bring the character with her. A huge mistake. Finally, Scooby Doo himself. Considering the possible options for bringing a talking dog to life, the movie version is actually quite successful. I thought the interplay between Scooby and the human mambers of the gang worked pretty well, and his character really came through. Shame that the animators decided to give him those bizarre big, bright, human style eyes which the cartoon version never sported. Weird and a bit creepy.As the the plot, its just far too busy. Anything and everything is thrown in making it clear that the makers could not decide what angle they were going for. They dabble in playing it true to the cartoon (very, very briefly), playing it for modern (Animal House-type) laughs, playing it as a parody, and playing it as a &quot;what if the characters went in this direction?&quot; kind of update. Too many styles, no substance and no chance for the audience to engage with any one mood. A real mess.As I said at the start, this is only my personal disappointment. I can't tell if other moviegoers had a similar experience, and lots of people seem to have found the film to be a riot. But as far as I'm concerned, it's a serious letdown and a huge wasted opportunity. I'm now waiting to see the second one to see if any of this gets put right...I really hope it does.",2,A Failure,1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,4372,"['First', 'all', 'apologies', 'review', 'based', 'entirely', 'personal', 'hopes', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'deliver', 'Other', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'lots', 'expectations', 'realised', 'screen', 'sadly', 'mine', ""weren't.The"", 'makers', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'get', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'make', 'film', 'real', 'laugh', 'yet', 'managed', 'do', 'everything', 'wrong', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'favourite', 'cartoon', 'come', 'life', 'messed', 'up', 'basic', 'rules', 'classic', 'show', 'First', 'main', 'characters', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'set', 'clothes', 'costume', 'designers', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'stick', 'simple', 'designs', 'cartoon', 'instead', 'went', 'hopeless', 'approximations', 'just', 'look', 'ill-fitting', 'careless', 'Worst', 'offender', 'Daphne', 'done', 'up', 'sorts', 'lurid', 'fashions', 'hairdos', 'looking', 'nothing', 'animated', 'original', 'Same', 'poor', 'Velma', 'odd', 'long', 'lanky', 'brown', 'wig', 'shapeless', 'sweater', 'Even', 'Fred', 'had', 'several', 'changes', 'costume', 'wrong', 'hairdo', 'Only', 'Shaggy', 'came', 'real', 'deal', 'probably', 'more', 'tribute', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'dedication', 'rather', 'designers.Next', 'rule', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'chase', 'down', 'never-ending', 'hallway', 'same', 'scenery', 'going', 'over', 'again', 'think', 'were', 'chases', 'movie', 'nothing', 'brought', 'much', 'loved', 'much', 'lampooned', 'past', 'feature', 'forefront', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'sequence', 'when', 'dozed', 'off', '.Next', 'rule', 'monsters', 'must', 'be', 'dumb', 'easily', 'fooled', 'Most', 'monsters', 'cartoon', 'just', 'went', 'quot', 'Graaagghh', 'quot', 'swiped', 'arms', 'thin', 'air', 'Scooby', 'co.', 'slipped', 'away', 'just', 'time', 'movie', 'monsters', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'frightening', 'demons', 'fly', 'air', 'taking', 'possession', 'innocent', 'holidaymakers', 'Frightening', 'good', ""n't"", 'belong', 'context.Another', 'thing', 'mood', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'hundreds', 'extras', 'other', 'actors', 'just', 'up', 'implausibility', 'whole', 'gang', 'ever', 'passing', 'real', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'hilariously', 'parody', 'device', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Movie', 'here', 'just', 'characters', 'look', 'thoroughly', 'underdeveloped', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'interact', 'naturalistic', 'quot', 'real-life', 'quot', 'characters', 'only', 'similarly', '2-dimensional', 'ciphers', 'cackling', 'crones', 'disgruntled', 'sherrifs', 'sinister', 'butlers.Next', 'up', 'characterisation', 'Again', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'show', 'Shaggy', 'truly', 'breathes', 'life', 'part', 'Fred', 'Velma', 'are', 'boring', 'developed', 'kind', 'cartoon', 'big', 'deal', 'there', 'Velma', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'get', 'teeth', 'Worst', 'again', 'Daphne', 'demonstrated', 'insertion', 'blatantly', 'inappropriate', 'quot', 'Daphne', 'martial', 'arts', 'quot', 'sequence', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'away', 'playing', 'Buffy', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'other', 'movies', 'certainly', 'should', ""n't"", 'bring', 'character', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Finally', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Considering', 'possible', 'options', 'bringing', 'talking', 'dog', 'life', 'movie', 'version', 'actually', 'quite', 'successful', 'thought', 'interplay', 'Scooby', 'human', 'mambers', 'gang', 'worked', 'pretty', 'well', 'character', 'really', 'came', 'Shame', 'animators', 'decided', 'give', 'bizarre', 'big', 'bright', 'human', 'style', 'eyes', 'cartoon', 'version', 'never', 'sported', 'Weird', 'bit', 'plot', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'busy', 'Anything', 'everything', 'thrown', 'making', 'clear', 'makers', 'could', 'not', 'decide', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'dabble', 'playing', 'true', 'cartoon', 'very', 'very', 'briefly', 'playing', 'modern', 'Animal', 'House-type', 'playing', 'parody', 'playing', 'quot', 'what', 'characters', 'went', 'direction', 'quot', 'kind', 'update', 'Too', 'many', 'styles', 'substance', 'chance', 'audience', 'engage', 'one', 'mood', 'real', 'mess.As', 'said', 'start', 'only', 'personal', 'disappointment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'other', 'moviegoers', 'had', 'similar', 'experience', 'lots', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'riot', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'serious', 'letdown', 'huge', 'wasted', 'opportunity', ""'m"", 'now', 'waiting', 'see', 'second', 'one', 'see', 'put', 'right', 'really', 'hope']",Scooby-Doo

716261,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00006HBUA,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","This was not a great movie in any way, yet somehow there was something appealing to it which made it not the worst movie I have ever witnessed.  You walk into this film with a level of expectancy.  You want to see the same characters, stories, and clich&eacute;d moments that you did while watching the television show, and you do.  The characters are creative, the story is very similar to the cartoon, and the clich&eacute;d moments are there in full force.  Coming from a household that used to religiously watch this cartoon, I wanted this level of security, and I found it in this film.  As a film watcher, I don't want to see the director of this film taking too many original risks and really destroying the culture of the cartoon.  It stayed true to its roots, and for that you cannot fault this film.  There were some humorous moments that made you think back to the cartoon, there were silly times where you just had to shrug and breathe in deeply, then there were some horrid moments that really just made you reach for the STOP button on your DVD player.  Yet, I was expecting this.  So, coming from an expectancy perspective, it was perfect.  Coming from an entertainment value, it could have been a bit tighter.To begin, the actors.  I agree that a remake like this may not have garnished the cream of the crop of Hollywood hitters, but I believe we could have done a bit better than Freddy Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard.  Sarah Michelle Gellar, I believe, could have been better as well.  Here we have some ""C"" level players who are a huge hit with the teen audiences, bringing to life characters, which were created during an older generation's time.  It just seemed a bit jumbled to me.  Then, to make matters even more confusing, we had the famed Rowan Atkinson as the sneaky Spooky Island owner.  Disappointing acting coupled with the great Mr. Bean doesn't quite fit for me.  He should have been used so much more to his potential.  He could have stolen this film from the others and made it into his own, but for some strange reason, bland acting breeds more bland acting, so you can't expect much.Outside of the acting, there isn't much else going on.  Nearly everything that happens we have seen time and time again through the cartoons.  Not much originality was brought into this film, while it felt like the money that should have gone to the creative department, was spent instead on sub-par CGI.  Scooby looked horrible.  I believe there was one instance where I could literally see right through him.  Then, you have these un-storied creatures that look like Donnie Darko's rejects.  Coupled with an annoying Scrappy-Doo.  There was potential in the CGI, but it seemed as if they low-balled and went with cheap CGI to appease the smaller child audiences.  The jokes needed to be planted deeper into the series.  I remember watching The Brady Bunch movie and laughing because the jokes just seemed to play off the taboo of the series.  I believe more focus on this with the Scooby-Doo movie would have raised this review another notch.Overall, I felt cheap after watching this film.  It wasn't a horrible film (though there was quite a bit of poor graphics and acting) because it gave you what you wanted when you walked in.  It gave you a mystery, the clich&eacute;d and overused structure of the original series, and that final moment when the true villain is revealed.  It followed a structure that I wanted, and I am ""ok"" with that for this film.  Normally, I would have asked for better, but there are some cartoons that do not need their internal structure tampered with.  Scooby-Doo was worth the one viewing, but I cannot say that I will ever be pleased to see it again.  The fact that there was the horrendous farting contest in the center of the film destroyed the entire experience for me.  That was the kind of humor I was not prepared for, nor did I feel it best represented the series.  The Mark McGrath cameo also did it in for me, but that my friend ... well ... is another story.  If you have never seen this film I suggest it once, but I do not feel that it needs a second viewing.  Scooby-Doo is alive, but in an animated version that continues to create laughter and creativity ... unlike this shoddy film.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Ramburgers,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,4279,"['was', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'way', 'yet', 'somehow', 'was', 'something', 'appealing', 'made', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'walk', 'film', 'level', 'expectancy', 'want', 'see', 'same', 'characters', 'stories', 'clich', 'eacute', 'moments', 'did', 'watching', 'television', 'show', 'do', 'characters', 'are', 'creative', 'story', 'very', 'similar', 'cartoon', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'moments', 'are', 'there', 'full', 'force', 'Coming', 'household', 'used', 'religiously', 'watch', 'cartoon', 'wanted', 'level', 'security', 'found', 'film', 'film', 'watcher', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'director', 'film', 'taking', 'too', 'many', 'original', 'risks', 'really', 'destroying', 'culture', 'cartoon', 'stayed', 'true', 'roots', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'film', 'were', 'humorous', 'moments', 'made', 'think', 'back', 'cartoon', 'were', 'silly', 'times', 'where', 'just', 'had', 'shrug', 'breathe', 'deeply', 'then', 'were', 'horrid', 'moments', 'really', 'just', 'made', 'reach', 'STOP', 'button', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'expecting', 'So', 'coming', 'expectancy', 'perspective', 'was', 'perfect', 'Coming', 'entertainment', 'value', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'tighter.To', 'begin', 'actors', 'agree', 'remake', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'garnished', 'cream', 'crop', 'Hollywood', 'hitters', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'Freddy', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'Here', 'have', 'C', 'level', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'huge', 'hit', 'teen', 'audiences', 'bringing', 'life', 'characters', 'were', 'created', 'older', 'generation', 'time', 'just', 'seemed', 'bit', 'jumbled', 'Then', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'had', 'famed', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'sneaky', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'owner', 'Disappointing', 'acting', 'coupled', 'great', 'Mr.', 'Bean', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'potential', 'could', 'have', 'stolen', 'film', 'others', 'made', 'own', 'strange', 'reason', 'bland', 'acting', 'breeds', 'more', 'bland', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much.Outside', 'acting', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'going', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'cartoons', 'Not', 'much', 'originality', 'was', 'brought', 'film', 'felt', 'money', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'creative', 'department', 'was', 'spent', 'instead', 'sub-par', 'CGI', 'Scooby', 'looked', 'horrible', 'believe', 'was', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'could', 'literally', 'see', 'right', 'Then', 'have', 'un-storied', 'creatures', 'look', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'rejects', 'Coupled', 'annoying', 'Scrappy-Doo', 'was', 'potential', 'CGI', 'seemed', 'low-balled', 'went', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'appease', 'smaller', 'child', 'audiences', 'jokes', 'needed', 'be', 'planted', 'deeper', 'series', 'remember', 'watching', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'movie', 'laughing', 'jokes', 'just', 'seemed', 'play', 'off', 'taboo', 'series', 'believe', 'more', 'focus', 'Scooby-Doo', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'raised', 'review', 'notch.Overall', 'felt', 'cheap', 'watching', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'film', 'there', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'poor', 'graphics', 'acting', 'gave', 'what', 'wanted', 'when', 'walked', 'gave', 'mystery', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'overused', 'structure', 'original', 'series', 'final', 'moment', 'when', 'true', 'villain', 'revealed', 'followed', 'structure', 'wanted', 'am', 'ok', 'film', 'Normally', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'better', 'are', 'cartoons', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'internal', 'structure', 'tampered', 'Scooby-Doo', 'was', 'one', 'viewing', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'pleased', 'see', 'again', 'fact', 'was', 'horrendous', 'farting', 'contest', 'center', 'film', 'destroyed', 'entire', 'experience', 'was', 'kind', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'did', 'feel', 'best', 'represented', 'series', 'Mark', 'McGrath', 'cameo', 'also', 'did', 'friend', 'well', 'story', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'suggest', 'once', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'second', 'viewing', 'Scooby-Doo', 'alive', 'animated', 'version', 'create', 'laughter', 'creativity', 'shoddy', 'film.Grade', '***', '*****']",Scooby-Doo

This pretty much says I already enjoyed the flick.  It's mindless and fun, and that's what makes it entertaining.There is definitely better picture quality with the Blu-Ray version when compared to the standard DVD.  There is far more pixelating in the standard DVD that is non-existent in the Blu-Ray version. But, the Blu-Ray version is not as flawless as it should be. Any flaws existing in the original film at the time of transfer (or flaws created during the transfer itself) will make their way to the high-def disc.I noticed a lot of very ""active"" backgrounds in many of the early scenes.  So much so, it's almost distracting.  At one point, Shaggy's green shirt even seems to be ""moving"".  But, later in the movie, everything looks stable and sharp as Blu-Ray should be.  This suggests to me that either the original movie has some flaws, or the there was some kind of issue with the transfer process itself.

716274,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00006HBUA,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 1]","Good 'ol Scooby and his Mystery, INC. cohorts. Brings back a lot of fond memories from long ago when I would regularly watch the old cartoon. Still fun today. Sadly, anyone who remembers it fondly like the way I and millions of other people do, won't find much to love with this new, live action adaption. It's souless and uninspired. The actors here all seem to be game for the kiddie action this film is full of, and they all do their best. However, it can't salvage the film from being anything more than a bright, overdone movie for little kids who don't know much about the history or the old cartoons. The plot is as light and unconvincing as the TV show, but here it goes - The gang split up and go their seperate ways after a case. They are all reunited two years later when they are contacted to come to an exotic island called Spooky Island, where odd, supernatural things are occuring. Gee, your kidding?. While there, the gang realize that a lot of people on the island come there normal, but they soon start acting rather oddly. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know what's going on or figure it out. This isn't anything new. The mystery of what's going on, who is doing it, and why they are doing it has always been as shallow as a kiddie pool. This new movie doesn't change that formula. The cast is fun and seem to be enjoying themselves. They make the most of what they got. Matthew Lillard, as Shaggy, is the best of the bunch. He really was a perfect choice for the role and he really brings the old cartoon character to life. Linda Cardellini as Velma did another fine job. She is obviously not as nerdy or unattractive as the old Velma, but she does an adequate job with the character and all of the ' jinkies ' she always has to say. Freddie Prinze, jr. is, well, he's Freddie Prinze, Jr. He really doesn't do anything with the character and doesn't do anything new or different to make anyone think that we're watching anything else but a same old Freddie Prinze, Jr. performance. Sarah Michelle Gellar. I love her. She is extremely talented, but she is wasted in a thankless role that doesn't have any character to it. It's a shame. She is so breathtakingly smart, tough, and talented in ""Buffy"", but all of that is wiped away in the vapid character of Daphne. Too bad. She is so much better than this. Comedian Rowan Atkinson of ""Mr. Bean"" fame also stars. There is also a rather odd cameo by Pamela Anderson here that just doesn't fit. The film is colorful and will sure entertain the young 'uns, but the adults who grew up on and loved the original will be bored and saddened with this new incarnation. The movie is never really funny, except for some things here and there(a certain scene with smoke coming out of the van comes to mind). It would've been great if the writers used more of that kind of comedy. Something more like a hilarious send-up like the big screen ""Brady Bunch"" movies. The movie, in one scene, resorts to low brow potty(i.e. 'farting') humor that just shouldn't of been allowed in this type of a movie. Okay, I got a tiny chuckle out of it, but it was wrong. In the end, this is a film that will no doubt be enough to satisfy the little viewers, but the older ones looking for a better homage to a beloved cartoon of long ago will be extremely disappointed.

The classic cartoon capers of Mystery, Inc. have finally reached the silver screen in SCOOBY DOO, but this isn't the film that fans have been waiting for. James Gunn's script pokes fun at the cartoon series, which is fine since the show is rife for parody, but the characters he creates and the overall mood of the entire picture lack the spirit of the original television show. For all of the extravagant sets and big name actors, one would hope that director Raja Gosnell could have invested a little more time and money into the ugly computerization that was used for Scooby and the monsters. Even if the creatures were made to look cartoony to avoid frightening the children in the audience, it does not excuse the tacky special effects. Sadly, the film doesn't even include so much as a cameo by any of the classic monsters, and instead adopts a whole new set of villains that kids are unlikely to remember. In trying to be hip to modern, SCOOBY DOO loses much of its magic, and makes Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze look like a couple of buffoons on screen. Only Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini truly capture the essense of the original characters. Had the makers gone with the initial plans to make this a campy throwback to the 70's like in THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, the film may have worked, but unfortunately SCOOBY DOO is a wasted opportunity that is unlikely to please generations new or old.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,ILHM Reviews Scooby-Doo,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,1660,"['Scooby', 'gang', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'are', 'invited', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'try', 'solve', 'case', 'where', 'sinister', 'madman', 'transforming', 'wild', 'teenagers', 'mild-mannered', 'college', 'students', 'using', 'ancient', 'voodoo', 'rituals', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'capers', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'have', 'finally', 'reached', 'silver', 'screen', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', ""n't"", 'film', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'James', 'Gunn', 'script', 'fun', 'cartoon', 'series', 'fine', 'show', 'rife', 'parody', 'characters', 'overall', 'mood', 'entire', 'picture', 'lack', 'spirit', 'original', 'television', 'show', 'extravagant', 'sets', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'director', 'Raja', 'Gosnell', 'could', 'have', 'invested', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'money', 'ugly', 'computerization', 'was', 'used', 'Scooby', 'monsters', 'Even', 'creatures', 'were', 'made', 'look', 'cartoony', 'avoid', 'frightening', 'children', 'audience', 'not', 'excuse', 'tacky', 'special', 'effects', 'Sadly', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'include', 'so', 'much', 'cameo', 'classic', 'monsters', 'instead', 'adopts', 'whole', 'new', 'set', 'villains', 'kids', 'are', 'unlikely', 'remember', 'trying', 'be', 'hip', 'modern', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', 'much', 'magic', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'look', 'couple', 'buffoons', 'screen', 'Only', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'truly', 'capture', 'essense', 'original', 'characters', 'Had', 'makers', 'gone', 'initial', 'plans', 'make', 'campy', 'throwback', '70', 'THE', 'BRADY', 'BUNCH', 'MOVIE', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'unfortunately', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'unlikely', 'please', 'generations', 'new', 'old.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Scooby-Doo

Directed by Raja Gosnell, it is fun and has the same spirit as the TV series did, while in 3-D.PLOT SUMMARY: In the opening of the film version of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, the Scooby gang are in the middle of solving a mystery. They have become very famous, but when Velma (Linda Cardellini) thinks everything is too formulatic, she decides to quite. The self-proclaimed leader and concited Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.) as well as Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) also quite, leaving Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby behind with the Mystery van. Two years later, all five of them receive mysterious invitations to an amusement park for college students called Spooky Island. At the airport, they discover that all of them have received the invitations and reluclantly decide to go. On the plane, Shaggy meets Mary Jane (Isla Fisher) and falls in love with her. It's ironic how she's allergic to dogs. When they get to Spooky Island, they meet the strange theme park owner, Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) who claims that something has gone terribly wrong in his theme park: the students who come to the park, arrive as their normal, wild and crazy selves. But when they leave, they are super-serious students, who act almost like zombies. Now, it's up to the Mystery Inc. gang to solve the mystery before it destroys all of humanity.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I must say how surprised I am by liking the film. I guess it's because I loved the TV show. The acting performances are probably the best part about the film--watching these young, talented actors like Gellar, Cardellini, Prinze Jr., and especially Lillard, transform into the cartoon characters who everybody loves. But Lillard steals the show--he manages to capture Shaggy's character like no other and brings him to life. I really believed that Matthew Lillard wasn't just PLAYING Shaggy, but he WAS Shaggy. The storyline is fun, light, and easy to follow. It can be scary at times for very young children, but it is mainly harmless. The directing by Raja Gosnell was amazing, and the special effects were awesome, especially the CG Scooby. It must be a challenge for actors to play alongside any CG character, but the cast of &quot;Scooby&quot; pulled it off really well. There are enough surprises to keep you interested, even though it may seem a bit predictable.The DVD has lots of goodies which include a making of the film documentary, filmmakers' and cast's commentary options, never-before-seen footage, featurettes, a music video, &quot;hidden extras&quot;, interactive computer games, and DVD-ROM extras. The DVD is available in both wide screen and full frame formats.I highly recommend &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;.Score:100/100A+",5,"Zoinks!

Hayes""","[5, 9]","I wasn't going to watch this period, but tonight on the ABC Family Channel this was on, so I'm like o.k. let's see why I wasn't up to watching this. I got my answer rather quickly. Mind you it was a clever attempt to show that it wasn't all cartoon pie in the sky. It starts with the Mystery Machine group Velma, Fred, Shaggy, Daphnie, and Scooby all going thier separate ways as a t.v. show wanting to be cancelled. It also showed that the five all had thier personal isssues with each other, and decide it's for the best to just go thier own ways. They are all brought back together by an anonymous person to solve the mystery on Spooky Island. I found Spooky Island to be a pathetc cross between Adventureland, and Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World. This is where the clever attempt starts to unravel as you see the group trying to solve the mystery, and along the way they pick up Scrappy Doo, and depending on your sense of humor this may be funny as Daphnie gets upset with Scrappy Doo because he peed on her, but to me the line Fred uses about Scrappy marking his territory on Daphnie was without a doubt a feeble attempt to rescue this movie from absolute ruin. The special effects were also out of place here for this being a cartoon for kids up to 8-9 years old to have special effects that are more geared at an older audience was improper. I think I know as to why the group Sugar Ray ended up killing thier careers as they performed in this movie, and then the group ends up turning into monsters. It would go even further to where Fred, Velma, and Daphnie all turn into monsters as well. I couldn't go further as the movie was just that bad. I found the fact that Shaggy actually fell in love with a girl as the closest thing positive that I could find about this movie, but I feel that he should date Velma though because she's more about sense, and would be the close friend that Shaggy needs that doesn't walk on all fours.

Matthew Lillard is the perfect Shaggy and the production design could have worked, but in an effort to update the Scooby genre for today's audiences, the writers have hijacked this franchise for some very unfamiliar territory.The original SD stuff was about being scared and solving a mystery.  This stinker of a film tries to cash-in on the retro-feel of the characters and make this into some Austin Powers wanna-be.  This movie is never scary and it actually is never funny either.By making the monsters real, the whole fun and innocence of the original series is lost.  The original characters were debunkers, not super-heroes on a journey of self-discovery.The film comes across as mindless as a ""Gilligan's Island"" episode but not nearly as fun.They don't even get the jargon right -- it's the ""Mystery Machine"" not the ""Mystery Van.""Again, it could have been fun and even a little scary, but this production is too interested in FX and being retro.  It just doesn't work.Perhaps if they had made a more gothic haunted house mystery, like the trailer and the animated opening sequence suggested, it would have worked better and been truer to audience expectations.

After all, who would buy a preppy ascot-wearing All-American boy hanging out with a brainy chick (outside of school finals), not to mention an obvious stoner and his Great Dane (Daphne was another story) to solve mysteries?Of course, some network executive may think they've finally found the perfect show to follow FRIENDS on Must See TV so perhaps we should just move on?With the success of live-action movies of popular cartoons such as ... ""The Flinstones"" and ""Josie and the Pussycats"" (hmmn, there really hasn't been a successful cartoon movie translation, has there?) it was only a matter of time before one of the most beloved cartoon characters got the big screen treatment.The whole Mystery Inc. gang is here: Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr. who will no doubt get the last laugh on those ""Spider-Man"" directors for casting Tobey Maguire in the lead role instead) Daphne (Sarah Michelle Geller), Velma (Linda Cardelini), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and of course, Scooby-Doo.Just like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Scooby is completely computer generated, which allows him to be just as animated as he is in the cartoons.Since the original source material wasn't exactly ""CSI"" or even ""Murder She Wrote,"" the screenwriters had to create a little drama and tension to make the big screen adaptation last a little longer than the typical 30-minute episode.A clash of egos leads Mystery Inc. to disband (Scooby sticks with his best-bud Shaggy since Velma may have been a whiz with mysteries but she was no great shakes in the kitchen) and for the next two years, enjoy life on their own.The gang reunites at the bequest of millionaire Mondavarious (Mr. Bean's Rowan Atkinson), the owner of Spooky Island, a spring getaway for college students. Apparently someone is turning the kids into well-behaved members of society via a mass brainwashing. Well, one thing is for sure. It's not affiliated with MTV in any way.The gang decides to work together one more time to get to the bottom of the mystery, but they all want to be the first one to crack the mystery while Shaggy and Scooby are simply interested in the all-you-can eat buffet promised by Mondavarious.Call me a risk taker, but I'm gonna go out on a limb here and put my money on Velma.Shaggy meets a girl (Isla Fisher) named Mary Jane - think about it for a second - who seems to be the ideal girl except for one thing ... she's allergic to dogs. And once again Mary Jane comes between yet another perfect partnership... but can Shaggy and the rest of Mystery Inc. get their act together in time to find the real culprit behind the crime?The film has everything that Scooby fans young or old have come to love over the years from Shaggy and Scooby's rather unique eating habits to Daphne's penchant for always getting caught by the villain.There's even a hilarious cameo appearance by Scrappy Doo, Scooby's scene-stealing mutt who thought he could take on every villain the gang encountered.Fans of the cartoon will eat this up like a fresh batch of Scooby-snacks. Sorry, I'm trying to get a quote worked into the film's next run of commercials. It's a fun little film to enjoy some overpriced popcorn and hot dogs just promise you won't wince when you hear that famous line ""And I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids.""",4,1960s TV toon gets the big screen treatment,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,3371,"['show', 'Scooby-Doo', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'originated', '1960s', 'who', 'would', 'buy', 'preppy', 'ascot-wearing', 'All-American', 'boy', 'hanging', 'out', 'brainy', 'chick', 'school', 'finals', 'not', 'mention', 'obvious', 'stoner', 'Great', 'Dane', 'Daphne', 'was', 'story', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'course', 'network', 'executive', 'may', 'think', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'found', 'perfect', 'show', 'follow', 'FRIENDS', 'Must', 'See', 'TV', 'so', 'perhaps', 'should', 'just', 'move', 'success', 'live-action', 'movies', 'popular', 'cartoons', 'such', 'Flinstones', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'hmmn', 'really', ""n't"", 'been', 'successful', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'translation', 'there', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'got', 'big', 'screen', 'treatment.The', 'whole', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'gang', 'here', 'Fred', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'who', 'will', 'doubt', 'get', 'last', 'laugh', 'Spider-Man', 'directors', 'casting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'lead', 'role', 'instead', 'Daphne', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Geller', 'Velma', 'Linda', 'Cardelini', 'Shaggy', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'course', 'Scooby-Doo.Just', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Scooby', 'completely', 'computer', 'generated', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'animated', 'cartoons.Since', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'CSI', 'even', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'screenwriters', 'had', 'create', 'little', 'drama', 'tension', 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'last', 'little', 'longer', 'typical', '30-minute', 'episode.A', 'clash', 'egos', 'leads', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'disband', 'Scooby', 'sticks', 'best-bud', 'Shaggy', 'Velma', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'whiz', 'mysteries', 'was', 'great', 'shakes', 'kitchen', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'enjoy', 'life', 'own.The', 'gang', 'bequest', 'millionaire', 'Mondavarious', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'owner', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'spring', 'getaway', 'college', 'students', 'Apparently', 'someone', 'turning', 'kids', 'well-behaved', 'members', 'society', 'mass', 'brainwashing', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'not', 'affiliated', 'MTV', 'way.The', 'gang', 'work', 'together', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'get', 'bottom', 'mystery', 'want', 'be', 'first', 'one', 'crack', 'mystery', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'are', 'simply', 'interested', 'all-you-can', 'eat', 'buffet', 'promised', 'Mondavarious.Call', 'risk', 'taker', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'here', 'put', 'money', 'Velma.Shaggy', 'girl', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'named', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'think', 'second', 'who', 'be', 'ideal', 'girl', 'one', 'thing', 'allergic', 'dogs', 'once', 'again', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'yet', 'perfect', 'partnership', 'can', 'Shaggy', 'rest', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'time', 'find', 'real', 'culprit', 'crime', 'film', 'everything', 'Scooby', 'fans', 'young', 'old', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'years', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'rather', 'unique', 'eating', 'habits', 'Daphne', 'penchant', 'always', 'getting', 'caught', 'villain.There', 'even', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Scrappy', 'Doo', 'Scooby', 'scene-stealing', 'mutt', 'who', 'thought', 'could', 'take', 'villain', 'gang', 'encountered.Fans', 'cartoon', 'will', 'eat', 'up', 'fresh', 'batch', 'Scooby-snacks', 'Sorry', ""'m"", 'trying', 'get', 'quote', 'worked', 'film', 'next', 'run', 'commercials', 'fun', 'little', 'film', 'enjoy', 'overpriced', 'popcorn', 'hot', 'dogs', 'just', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wince', 'when', 'hear', 'famous', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'meddling', 'kids']",Scooby-Doo

I was wrong! Scooby-Doo is fun, amusing movie that the entire family could watch.The plot of the movie is that two years after the Mystery Inc. gang goes their separate ways, Emile Mondavarious [Rowan Atkinson, a.k.a. Mr. Bean], owner of Spooky Island, invites them all [without any of them knowing the other has been invited] to his resort to investigate why the students, who've came there for Spring Break, are acting so strange. So, Fred [Freddie Prinze Jr.], Daphne [Sarah Michelle Gellar], Velma [Linda Cardellini], Shaggy [Matthew Lillard] and Scooby head to the island to check things out. When they get there, odd happenings begin to occur and they have to crack the case before things get out of hand! I also loved the ending. It was quite a surprise!Out of all of the actors, I thought Matthew Lillard did a wonderful job in his portrayal of Shaggy. He truly acted just like the cartoon Shaggy did.The special features on the DVD are great, too.

Wrong!  Although the casting director made some perfect choices (wait until you see and hear Matthew Lillard as Scaggy - he's perfect), nothing can help the script.  Yes, it pokes fun at the original characters and premise, with lots of references to the pot-smoking, free love, horribly dressed seventies.  Yes, the plot is classic Scooby, with its hauntings arranged by villains - and hints of real ghosts. And yes, it tries to appeal to this generation of kids, particularly boys, with the elementary school playground humor of bodily functions.  But even with some genuinely funny moments, nothing gels.

716294,A3SIZI2IVZR5AV,B00006HBUA,Dennis J. Anderson,"[0, 1]","I really think they could have done much better computer graphics with Scooby.  The rest of the main cast do a pretty good job. Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardinelli are so believable it is a bit scarry.  Sarah Michelle Geller and Freddie Prince Jr. do a fair job but this is not some of their better work.I know I know it is a recreation of a cartoon but I expected a lot better.  I think there is a story here that would be a good movie but I think they either did not have the budget they needed to do it right or the director needs to go back to school.  The movie does have a few laughs and would do a good job of scaring a 6 or younger  but I am not sure parts are appropriate for children of that age.  When it breaks down to a fart and burping contest between Shaggie and Scooby I think the movie hits a real low point.  It also makes me wonder how desperate they were for footage to leave it in the final cut.I gave it three stars because I did find some entrainment in it and my 9 year old has liked it for a couple of years.  I would have only given it two stars if I were reviewing it for the older crowd above the age of 20 at least.I am not sure if HD DVD helps or hinders it.  I am still trying to figure out what we ever saw in VHS after seeing DVD's and now that I have seen HD even up converted movies don't stack up at times.  So if your just trying to find movies to get a collection going or if you have a kid this is not a bad investment but if you want to save a few bucks I would suggest getting this and the Scooby Doo two movie together for the price you would be a bit ahead and save your money for action, science fiction, or music that would look and sound incredible on HD DVD.",3,The kid likes it.,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,1706,"['really', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'computer', 'graphics', 'Scooby', 'rest', 'main', 'cast', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Linda', 'Cardinelli', 'are', 'so', 'believable', 'bit', 'scarry', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Geller', 'Freddie', 'Prince', 'Jr.', 'do', 'fair', 'job', 'not', 'better', 'work.I', 'know', 'know', 'recreation', 'cartoon', 'expected', 'lot', 'better', 'think', 'story', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'needed', 'do', 'right', 'director', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'laughs', 'would', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'scaring', '6', 'younger', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'parts', 'are', 'appropriate', 'children', 'age', 'When', 'down', 'fart', 'burping', 'contest', 'Shaggie', 'Scooby', 'think', 'movie', 'real', 'low', 'point', 'also', 'wonder', 'how', 'desperate', 'were', 'footage', 'leave', 'final', 'cut.I', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'did', 'find', 'entrainment', '9', 'year', 'old', 'liked', 'couple', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'given', 'two', 'stars', 'were', 'reviewing', 'older', 'crowd', 'age', '20', 'least.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'HD', 'DVD', 'hinders', 'am', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'ever', 'saw', 'VHS', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'HD', 'even', 'up', 'converted', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'stack', 'up', 'times', 'So', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'movies', 'get', 'collection', 'going', 'have', 'kid', 'not', 'bad', 'investment', 'want', 'save', 'few', 'bucks', 'would', 'suggest', 'getting', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'two', 'movie', 'together', 'price', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'ahead', 'save', 'money', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'music', 'would', 'look', 'sound', 'incredible', 'HD', 'DVD']",Scooby-Doo
716295,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00006HBUA,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[2, 6]","Let me get started that I never was and still am not a fan of the whole Scooby Doo franchise, even when I was younger so I kept my expectations relatively low but even then, this big screen adaptation completely comes crashing down to the ground in a lot of ways.The plot is decent enough, telling about the gang who has gone their separate ways but reunite after they all get an invitation to Spooky Island where they discover an amusement park but strange things happen and endanger all of them and they all have to work together to find out what's going on to the tourists. Too bad the bumbling acting and miscast actors and actresses just ruin it from here.What really kills this film in my opinion is the grossly miscast actors that played the characters. No offense against any of them but this glaringly shows that where they stand, they were completely unsuitable for their roles. The most glaring of all were the actor who played Norville `Shaggy' Rogers and especially Sarah Michelle Gellar who I feel really dropped the ball on this one. They all act completely out of character and hardly even act like real heroes at all. Instead they just look like they were all just going for some Jurassic Park style joyride through caverns and acting like fools.In many ways, this feels more like watching a bad episode of TRL (Total Request Live) on MTV) with the worst of behavior of the characters. The music from Suger Ray is not bad and it's kind of funny watching the band members chase around the characters but they make up the bulk of what's good about this movie and even then, even they could not save this movie. The other redeeming quality is the ending which I must say isn't all that bad either but then again it was great just because the movie was over and that I could finally go and see something else instead. These things prevent this movie from being a one star but just barely a two star.I really tried to like this movie but even when the brain is turned off, there's nothing that was on here that was enough to persuade me to ever see this movie again. It's this kind of stupidity and dumb acting that has turned me away from comedies and made me shift into much darker more dramatic movies as of recently. It's not the worst movie in the world by any means but this ""Scooby Doo"" movie just fails in so many ways that it wouldn't kill me if I were to never see it again nor it being taken out of print. There is nothing that a ""Special Edition"", Expanded Edition, or truckloads of extras could rescue this waste of film from the dumpster.A complete waste of film. I can't even believe that they are even making a sequel. This isn't the worst movie in the world by any stretch of the imagination but it wouldn't kill me if this were to vanish from existence. There are some redeeming qualities in this film but they are few and aren't enough to make this movie worthy of killing time.If you're in the mood to see something that isn't necessarily thought-provoking and want some brainless comedy, then I would suggest ""Eight Legged Freaks"" which I feel was much better.Don't bother too much with the much hyped sequel in the works. For all we know, it will flop big time when it's released to theaters. On the other hand, with a more positive note, I hope they learned the mistakes made in this first ""Scooby Doo"" movie and try harder on the sequel but I have my doubts on that.",2,Dissapointing and very messy.,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,3402,"['Let', 'get', 'started', 'never', 'was', 'still', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'whole', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'franchise', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'so', 'kept', 'expectations', 'relatively', 'low', 'even', 'then', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'completely', 'crashing', 'down', 'ground', 'lot', 'ways.The', 'plot', 'decent', 'enough', 'telling', 'gang', 'who', 'gone', 'separate', 'ways', 'reunite', 'get', 'invitation', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'where', 'discover', 'amusement', 'park', 'strange', 'things', 'happen', 'endanger', 'have', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'tourists', 'Too', 'bad', 'bumbling', 'acting', 'miscast', 'actors', 'actresses', 'just', 'ruin', 'here.What', 'really', 'film', 'opinion', 'grossly', 'miscast', 'actors', 'played', 'characters', 'offense', 'glaringly', 'where', 'stand', 'were', 'completely', 'unsuitable', 'roles', 'most', 'glaring', 'were', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Norville', 'Shaggy', 'Rogers', 'especially', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'feel', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'one', 'act', 'completely', 'character', 'hardly', 'even', 'act', 'real', 'heroes', 'Instead', 'just', 'look', 'were', 'just', 'going', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'style', 'joyride', 'caverns', 'acting', 'fools.In', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'watching', 'bad', 'episode', 'TRL', 'Total', 'Request', 'Live', 'MTV', 'worst', 'behavior', 'characters', 'music', 'Suger', 'Ray', 'not', 'bad', 'kind', 'funny', 'watching', 'band', 'members', 'chase', 'characters', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'then', 'even', 'could', 'not', 'save', 'movie', 'other', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'ending', 'must', 'say', ""n't"", 'bad', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'great', 'just', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'could', 'finally', 'go', 'see', 'something', 'else', 'instead', 'things', 'prevent', 'movie', 'being', 'one', 'star', 'just', 'barely', 'two', 'star.I', 'really', 'tried', 'like', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'brain', 'turned', 'off', 'nothing', 'was', 'here', 'was', 'enough', 'persuade', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'kind', 'stupidity', 'dumb', 'acting', 'turned', 'away', 'comedies', 'made', 'shift', 'much', 'darker', 'more', 'dramatic', 'movies', 'recently', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'world', 'means', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'would', ""n't"", 'kill', 'were', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'being', 'taken', 'print', 'nothing', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Expanded', 'Edition', 'truckloads', 'extras', 'could', 'rescue', 'waste', 'film', 'dumpster.A', 'complete', 'waste', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'are', 'even', 'making', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', 'world', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'would', ""n't"", 'kill', 'were', 'vanish', 'existence', 'are', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'worthy', 'killing', 'time.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'see', 'something', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'thought-provoking', 'want', 'brainless', 'comedy', 'then', 'would', 'suggest', 'Eight', 'Legged', 'Freaks', 'feel', 'was', 'much', 'better.Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'much', 'hyped', 'sequel', 'works', 'know', 'will', 'flop', 'big', 'time', 'when', 'released', 'theaters', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'hope', 'learned', 'mistakes', 'made', 'first', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movie', 'try', 'harder', 'sequel', 'have', 'doubts']",Scooby-Doo

This live-action rendition of Scooby-Doo manages to be even sillier than the show it's based off of, and somehow, it's even more boring.Mystery, Inc. consists of a group of teens who go around solving, well, mysteries, usually involving ghouls and monsters, though the truth usually reveals itself as a human in disguise.  There's arrogant Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr., who's actually perfectly suited for this role), nerdy Velma (Linda Cardellini), vacantly pretty Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), bumbling goof Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), and of course, Scooby-Doo himself, appearing courtesy of the latest and most high-tech in special effects.After a two-year separation, the team comes back together to solve strange things going on on an amusement park island.  The kids who arrive at the park come out like brain-washed zombies and the owner wants to know who or what is behind this. And extremely ludicrous stuff happens from there on out.Yes, I realize I'm not supposed to take this movie seriously, but it fails at the most basic level of entertainment.  The jokes aren't funny (in fact, a few of them are cringe-inducing), the acting's mostly pathetic, and the proceedings simply lack a good sense of fun.  Sure, there are a lot of slapstick action sequences, fights with monsters, booby traps, and secret doorways, but it's all brought down by Raja Gosnell's lackluster direction and the cast's inability to appear or sound like anything more than a bunch of actors desperately trying not to be upstaged by a CGI-dog.And when you get right down to it, that's the only reason this movie exists; to showcase a silly Great Dane with cartoonish CGI.  On that level, I suppose there's some satisfaction to be had.  Scooby-Doo himself is a fairly impressive special effect.  The obviousness of it is definitely intentional, and the dog himself, while never actually provoking any genuine laughs, has a few amusing moments.The same cannot be said for the actors.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. is easily the worst of this cast, taking what should be a relatively simple role and still managing to seem rather flat.  Linda Cardellini is probably too busty and nubile for the role of Velma, but I guess she's okay to the extent playing such a character can afford.  Sarah Michelle Gellar can be a decent actress, and while she plays this vapid role to a tee, this doesn't change the fact she's incredibly annoying.  Matthew Lillard is also hard to watch, particularly in a fart contest that will probably have the kids rolling in laughter.  He does, however, make a pretty fair imitation of Kasey Kasem's voice.Scooby-Doo, the movie, has one fittingly enjoyable segment, involving protoplasm and body-switching, of all things.  For about five minutes, I actually found myself perking up from dullsville and even chuckling a few times.  But once that segment ended, the film went straight back to the garbage bin, particularly with a twist ending that's indescribably silly, even for a live-action cartoon.This is another strike for director Gosnell, the only other movie of his I've seen being Big Momma's house.  But does it even matter who directs a movie like this?  So long as the CGI dog is around, the kids'll rush in droves, and this will soon be a franchise that will milk all its money's worth before disappearing in cinematic oblivion.  But that won't be for another five years.* 1/2 out of [5 stars.]",2,"Boring, silly attempt at kids entertainment.",1036627200,"11 7, 2002",2002,3683,"['are', 'probably', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Scooby-Doo', 'charms', 'more', 'will', 'Namely', 'would', 'apply', 'kids', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'middle-aged', 'adult', 'who', 'regardless', 'not', 'was', 'fan', 'old', 'cartoon', 'series', 'actually', 'enjoying', 'picture', 'live-action', 'rendition', 'Scooby-Doo', 'manages', 'be', 'even', 'sillier', 'show', 'based', 'somehow', 'even', 'more', 'boring.Mystery', 'Inc.', 'group', 'teens', 'who', 'go', 'solving', 'well', 'mysteries', 'usually', 'involving', 'ghouls', 'monsters', 'truth', 'usually', 'human', 'disguise', 'arrogant', 'Fred', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'who', 'actually', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'role', 'nerdy', 'Velma', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'vacantly', 'pretty', 'Daphne', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'bumbling', 'goof', 'Shaggy', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'course', 'Scooby-Doo', 'appearing', 'courtesy', 'latest', 'most', 'high-tech', 'special', 'effects.After', 'two-year', 'separation', 'team', 'back', 'together', 'solve', 'strange', 'things', 'going', 'amusement', 'park', 'island', 'kids', 'who', 'arrive', 'park', 'come', 'brain-washed', 'zombies', 'owner', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'extremely', 'ludicrous', 'stuff', 'out.Yes', 'realize', ""'m"", 'not', 'supposed', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'most', 'basic', 'level', 'entertainment', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'fact', 'few', 'are', 'cringe-inducing', 'acting', 'mostly', 'pathetic', 'proceedings', 'simply', 'lack', 'good', 'sense', 'fun', 'Sure', 'are', 'lot', 'slapstick', 'action', 'sequences', 'fights', 'monsters', 'booby', 'traps', 'secret', 'doorways', 'brought', 'down', 'Raja', 'Gosnell', 'lackluster', 'direction', 'cast', 'inability', 'appear', 'sound', 'anything', 'more', 'bunch', 'actors', 'desperately', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'upstaged', 'CGI-dog.And', 'when', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'showcase', 'silly', 'Great', 'Dane', 'cartoonish', 'CGI', 'level', 'suppose', 'satisfaction', 'be', 'had', 'Scooby-Doo', 'fairly', 'impressive', 'special', 'effect', 'obviousness', 'definitely', 'intentional', 'dog', 'never', 'actually', 'provoking', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments.The', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'actors', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'easily', 'worst', 'cast', 'taking', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'relatively', 'simple', 'role', 'still', 'managing', 'seem', 'rather', 'flat', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'probably', 'too', 'busty', 'nubile', 'role', 'Velma', 'guess', 'okay', 'extent', 'playing', 'character', 'can', 'afford', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'can', 'be', 'decent', 'actress', 'vapid', 'role', 'tee', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'also', 'hard', 'watch', 'particularly', 'fart', 'contest', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'kids', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'however', 'make', 'pretty', 'fair', 'imitation', 'Kasey', 'Kasem', 'voice.Scooby-Doo', 'movie', 'one', 'fittingly', 'enjoyable', 'segment', 'involving', 'protoplasm', 'body-switching', 'things', 'five', 'minutes', 'actually', 'found', 'perking', 'up', 'dullsville', 'even', 'chuckling', 'few', 'times', 'once', 'segment', 'ended', 'film', 'went', 'straight', 'back', 'garbage', 'bin', 'particularly', 'twist', 'ending', 'indescribably', 'silly', 'even', 'live-action', 'cartoon.This', 'strike', 'director', 'Gosnell', 'only', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'being', 'Big', 'Momma', 'house', 'even', 'matter', 'who', 'movie', 'So', 'long', 'CGI', 'dog', 'around', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'rush', 'droves', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'franchise', 'will', 'milk', 'money', 'worth', 'disappearing', 'cinematic', 'oblivion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'five', 'years', '*', '1/2', '[', '5', 'stars', ']']",Scooby-Doo

716303,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00006HBUA,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[26, 31]","The key to enjoying SCOOBY DOO is not to expect too much.  The producers have billed the film as half hommage, half parody; in truth, it isn't really close enough to the original cartoon to be called hommage and it really doesn't go far enough to be called parody, and as usual Hollywood makes the mistake of trying to cover up the script's inadequacies with big-budget production values and expensive but actually so-so special effects.  All the same, the film does have its moments.  The story finds Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy splitting up due to ego conflicts--and then being unexpectedly reunited when the owner of a teen resort called ""Spooky Island"" invites them in to find out why his guests arrive as normal teens and then depart as, well, ZOMBIES.The script is fairly mundane, but it does have a few zingers, as when Velma says ""Let's get jinky with it!""  And although the cast is a mixed bag, they work hard to bring it off.  Freddie Prinze is wildly miscast as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar is not an ideal Daphne, but they play with tremendous energy; Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini, however, are so dead on target with their performances that they create an amazing sense of deja vu.  As for Scooby Doo, he is (of course) a computerized animation.  And so are most of the monsters the gang encounters on Spooky Island.  Although it works reasonably well, it isn't anything to write home about.I would recommend that parents preview the film before unleashing it upon their kids; some younger children may be unnerved by the monsters.  The DVD comes with a number of extras that include some cut scenes--and they offer an interesting contrast with the film, for they are very satirical.  Seeing them left me with the feeling that the film would have been much more entertaining if those scenes had been left in and the whole thing had been done with the same bite.  As it is--SCOOBY DOO is neither a great film nor a memorable film.  But we're all occasionally in the mood for some mindless fluff, and it fills that niche very well indeed.",3,Don't Expect Too Much & You'll Enjoy It As Mindless Fluff,1035763200,"10 28, 2002",2002,2063,"['key', 'enjoying', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'producers', 'have', 'billed', 'film', 'half', 'hommage', 'half', 'parody', 'truth', ""n't"", 'really', 'close', 'enough', 'original', 'cartoon', 'be', 'called', 'hommage', 'really', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'be', 'called', 'parody', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'mistake', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'script', 'inadequacies', 'big-budget', 'production', 'values', 'expensive', 'actually', 'so-so', 'special', 'effects', 'same', 'film', 'have', 'moments', 'story', 'Fred', 'Daphne', 'Velma', 'Shaggy', 'splitting', 'up', 'due', 'ego', 'conflicts', 'then', 'being', 'unexpectedly', 'reunited', 'when', 'owner', 'teen', 'resort', 'called', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'guests', 'arrive', 'normal', 'teens', 'then', 'depart', 'well', 'ZOMBIES.The', 'script', 'fairly', 'mundane', 'have', 'few', 'zingers', 'when', 'Velma', 'Let', 'get', 'jinky', 'cast', 'mixed', 'bag', 'work', 'hard', 'bring', 'off', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'wildly', 'miscast', 'Fred', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'not', 'ideal', 'Daphne', 'play', 'tremendous', 'energy', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'however', 'are', 'so', 'dead', 'target', 'performances', 'create', 'amazing', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'course', 'computerized', 'animation', 'so', 'are', 'most', 'monsters', 'gang', 'encounters', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'reasonably', 'well', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'about.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'parents', 'preview', 'film', 'unleashing', 'kids', 'younger', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'unnerved', 'monsters', 'DVD', 'number', 'extras', 'include', 'cut', 'scenes', 'offer', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'satirical', 'Seeing', 'left', 'feeling', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'whole', 'thing', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'same', 'bite', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', 'great', 'film', 'memorable', 'film', ""'re"", 'occasionally', 'mood', 'mindless', 'fluff', 'niche', 'very', 'well', 'indeed']",Scooby-Doo

716305,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00006HBUA,Get What We Give,"[0, 1]","Scooby Doo, Where Are You? was a staple of my Saturday mornings as a youth. It was entertaining and, to me, at that age, a bit creepy. The cartoon series today is still charming and even a bit more disturbing now that I know what some of the ""in-jokes"" are today. The live action film adaptation is almost an exact replication of the cartoon series. That is both a compliment and an insult to those involved. Let me explain....First of all, the kids will love this film. It is going to entertain them for hours on end and I'm sure they'll watch it over and over. That's who it's for isn't it? For them, it's going to be a four or five star affair. As parents, you can feel secure that the humor is clean enough (with enough innocuous potty humor thrown in to appease even the most jaded of 8 year olds), even if a couple of the scares are a bit intense.For those raised on the cartoon and expecting something more powerful, you probably won't feel the same way. My review is from the standpoint of an adult trying to recapture my youthful enjoyment of that old series. Don't do it! Here's the details:Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardinelli are almost creepy in their dead-on portrayals of their cartoon selves. Lillard, in particular, seems to be channelling Casey Kasem's voice work AND the cartoons bizarre movements for that character. Freddie Prinze, Jr. as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Danger-prone Daphne breathe a bit of new life into their cartoon selves. We discover that Fred is vain to the point of preening and Daphne is not just gorgeous, but a bit of an idiot. Scooby Doo is a computer generated character that will eventually have you believing that he must have really existed in his interactions with the actors. This is a tremendous compliment to the actors who had to do a great deal of blue or green screen work interacting with empty space.Lillard as Shaggy (and Scooby Doo, but he's really not there) is the real ""star"" of the show and needs to receive kudos for not only his dynamite portrayal, but his fantastically believable interactions with the non-existent Scooby Doo.What I didn't like about the film is that it is too much like the episodes and not enough like them all at the same time. The DVD extras lets us know that the filmmakers made a big mistake in not seguing the cartoon version opening credits into the live action film. It would have been great for those of us wanting a dip in the nostalgia pool (after all we have to take the kids, don't we?).Also, the villain in this piece is actually a bit on the horrific side, if you're taking the wee ones to see the film. That's surprising since the filmmakers make comments that they wanted to be sure to target the kids.Finally, if the filmmakers are merely going to remake an episode of the cartoon, what's the point? Why not just make a full length cartoon version of the quality of the original series?Ultimately, it is an enjoyable distraction to view this film. The actors are having fun and they make you want to have fun. The filmmaker wisely decided to maintain the bright day glo colors of the costumes for the cast.  Too bad the whole film isn't as bright as those colors.",2,Don't try rekindling your youth with this film adaptation,1034553600,"10 14, 2002",2002,3173,"['Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'was', 'staple', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'youth', 'was', 'entertaining', 'age', 'bit', 'creepy', 'cartoon', 'series', 'today', 'still', 'charming', 'even', 'bit', 'more', 'disturbing', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'in-jokes', 'are', 'today', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'adaptation', 'almost', 'exact', 'replication', 'cartoon', 'series', 'compliment', 'insult', 'involved', 'Let', 'explain', '.First', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'going', 'entertain', 'hours', 'end', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'over', 'who', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'four', 'five', 'star', 'affair', 'parents', 'can', 'feel', 'secure', 'humor', 'clean', 'enough', 'enough', 'innocuous', 'potty', 'humor', 'thrown', 'appease', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', '8', 'year', 'olds', 'even', 'couple', 'scares', 'are', 'bit', 'intense.For', 'raised', 'cartoon', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'powerful', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'review', 'standpoint', 'adult', 'trying', 'recapture', 'youthful', 'enjoyment', 'old', 'series', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Here', 'details', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Linda', 'Cardinelli', 'are', 'almost', 'creepy', 'dead-on', 'portrayals', 'cartoon', 'selves', 'Lillard', 'particular', 'be', 'channelling', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'voice', 'work', 'cartoons', 'bizarre', 'movements', 'character', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Fred', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Danger-prone', 'Daphne', 'bit', 'new', 'life', 'cartoon', 'selves', 'discover', 'Fred', 'vain', 'point', 'preening', 'Daphne', 'not', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'bit', 'idiot', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'computer', 'generated', 'character', 'will', 'eventually', 'have', 'believing', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'existed', 'interactions', 'actors', 'tremendous', 'compliment', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'blue', 'green', 'screen', 'work', 'interacting', 'empty', 'space.Lillard', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'really', 'not', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'receive', 'kudos', 'not', 'only', 'dynamite', 'portrayal', 'fantastically', 'believable', 'interactions', 'non-existent', 'Scooby', 'Doo.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'episodes', 'not', 'enough', 'same', 'time', 'DVD', 'extras', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'not', 'seguing', 'cartoon', 'version', 'opening', 'credits', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'wanting', 'dip', 'nostalgia', 'pool', 'have', 'take', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", '.Also', 'villain', 'piece', 'actually', 'bit', 'horrific', 'side', ""'re"", 'taking', 'wee', 'ones', 'see', 'film', 'surprising', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'comments', 'wanted', 'be', 'sure', 'target', 'kids.Finally', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'merely', 'going', 'remake', 'episode', 'cartoon', 'what', 'point', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'make', 'full', 'length', 'cartoon', 'version', 'quality', 'original', 'series', 'Ultimately', 'enjoyable', 'distraction', 'view', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'make', 'want', 'have', 'fun', 'filmmaker', 'wisely', 'decided', 'maintain', 'bright', 'day', 'glo', 'colors', 'costumes', 'cast', 'Too', 'bad', 'whole', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'bright', 'colors']",Scooby-Doo

The ONLY thing this movie has going for it is the first rate casting and performance of MATTHEW LILLARD as &quot;SHAGGY&quot;. That dude is &quot;SHAGGY&quot; from every physical characteristic all way down to the voice! Of course, the computer animated SCOOBY DOO is first rate &quot;actor&quot; as well. The girl who plays &quot;Thelma&quot; gives credibility to her character, but, realistically, &quot;Thelma&quot; was more akin to the 'Professor' on Gilligan's Island than a lost in love puppy-eyed romantic. Sarah Michelle Gellar &amp; Freddie Prinze Jr. seem just as miscast, as their characters are misrepresented from the originals. Most of those classic shows should be left as they were in entertainment history...most &quot;remakes&quot; lack the passion and spirit of the originals and are so shamelessly camped up to total silliness. As with Casper, The Brady Bunch,etc. - PLEASE leave them as they were, maybe a series of full length cartoon movie features are best on the SCOOBY DOO issue. This is like all those songs the Carpenters, Karen &amp; Richard, rerecorded and made their own during their heyday...and to this day, NOBODY has dared to go near, remake or touch those masterpieces.

What was conceivably a very, very bad idea turned out to be a surprisingly good film with a fair amount of comedy. Originally a Mike Myers vehicle (thank God THAT didn't work out), but then recast with I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream actors, the realization of Scooby Doo as a CGI character interacting with live action actually works. I'd say it was a one in a million chance but Raja Gosnell managed to pull it off.The most impressive transformation tho is not cartoon Scooby to CGI Scooby but Matthew Lillard's performance as Shaggy. No way would I have believed he could possibly take on the role of one of my most fave characters ever but he just seems to completely disappear and the spirit of Shaggy takes him over. He brings some real integrity to what is widely regarded as an artless family movie. Even Freddy Prinze Jr. (!) seems to nail the voice and narcissism of Fred and Sarah Michele Gellar is quite good as Daphne. Tho I was always more attracted to Velma for some reason and Linda Cardellini brings some true sex appeal to the role. It was cool to hear Shaggy's often unmentioned real name (Norville Rogers) near the beginning, tho I'm not sure everybody will entirely get it.Of course the plot is the usual baloney but there is constant action and invention to keep even the most impatient viewer stuck on till the end. The gang go to a theme park resort called Spooky Island (actually an Australian resort) to solve the mystery of why the wild spring break kids are turning into well-mannered nerds. But not only are there guys in masks but there are some REAL spooks too. I would have liked Rowan Atkinson to have a bigger role as Emile Mondavarious but considering the twist (which comes as an amusing surprise) at the end, the plot doesn't really give room for it. It's good to have him in there though instead of a cast full of 20-somethings. But 99% of the comic genius comes Matthew Lillard.Now that audiences have warmed to a live-action Scooby I'm eagerly awaiting the more sophisticated looking sequel. I'm sure it will be a massive hit just like this.For the REALLY observant try to spot a member of the `Neighbours' cast from a several years ago among the partying college kids.The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (stay away from the useless Pan and Scan version) with Dolby 5.1 sound.

It was funny and enjoyable. Some of the scenes were a bit scary probably for our 3 year old, but she didn't act like it. What can you say about the whole ""showdown"" between Shaggy and Scooby with bodily function noises? I was in stitches in the theatre. It had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes!If you're looking for an in-depth storyline, forget it. It's not there. This movie is playing homage to the old cartoons that I grew up watching UNTIL Scrappy came on board. And yet, they even play homage to that in a way I love. For all the Scrappy haters out there, we get our just revenge with what happens in this movie to him. Many people let this cloud their judgment of the movie and hate it just because of that. Well, I see that the makers of this movie agree with the rest of us: SCRAPPY STUNK! He was obnoxious, selfish and just overall irritating! He never should have existed and that his appearance was the downfall of the Scooby series.Each character is VERY believable, especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. And, with me being a Buffy fan, I just HAD to see SMG in this movie as Daphne. She pulled it off great. As for Freddy Prinze Jr., I'm not so sure he was the BEST Fred, but he pulled it off for me, even though his Fred was different from the cartoon in many respects.As for the DVD, the widescreen edition looks awesome. The features on the DVD are pretty good for a WB release. My kids loved listening to the commentary from the stars. The other features of the movie are pretty good as well and the DVD-ROM features are pretty cool. My 6-year-old daughter loved the games from the DVD-ROM.The deleted scenes are pretty cool. Some, you wonder why they removed them, but if you listen to the commentary while watching them, you can understand why that was done and it makes total sense.Now, supposedly this movie had a lot of sexual and drug references in them that were ultimately removed. I was one of the people who wanted those to be removed when I read about it in a newspaper article before the movie was released and I'm glad those aren't included here. Many people would probably cry foul that they were not included, but since my daughters know how to navigate around the DVD features, I would NOT want them to have access to them. Plus, I do not want to have to lock this DVD out with parental locks. Instead, I would want my daughters to be able to watch this when they want. So, kudos to WB for not including those scenes and for not releasing them at all in the theatres. Otherwise, I would have refused to take my daughters to it and they already knew it was coming, so that would have been a total blow to them.Excellent movie, excellent DVD. I still watch this movie and get a laugh. The soundtrack is pretty good as well. I can't get into a lot of the rap and hiphop stuff, but some of it on the soundtrack is pretty good. I would recommend getting that as well. My daughters absolutely love the soundtrack and dance to it until they drop with exhaustion.I would be prepared that it's PG for a reason: lewd humor (the bodily noises section) and Fred DOES utter a derogatory word about women that you hear alot from today's generation, but it actually was something I didn't catch until someone else said something about it. Since he talks in the ""lingo"" after being possessed, it's kind of hard to understand and I think for most kids, it will go over their heads. Also, Daphne talks about opening up a can of whoop, uh, mule on someone. It's too bad they couldn't have left those out.Overall, an excellent movie. Fun and funny to watch over and over again.

Both feelings turned out to be founded.  The movie, on pure entertainment value, was very good and was certainly suitable for the whole family.  The characters were generally well-cast.  Can't imagine why Freddie Prinze, Jr. would come to mind for the part of Fred (other than the obvious name sharing), but he did just fine in the role.  Not sure why Sarah Michelle Gellar was the choice for Daphne, but again, fine job.  I had never heard of Linda Cardellini, but she proved to be a fantastic Velma.  Scooby was very cute and the ""voice"" was on-target, but his coloring was a bit off to be technical.  He was much browner in the cartoon and his spots were black.  But I digress.  SHAGGY, now Shaggy was worth the price of admission.  Matthew Lillard IS Shaggy.  If I watched this movie a second time, it would be for Lillard's performance.  I couldn't get over how well he nailed the voice, the look, the mannerisms, etc.  You will be amazed.  The plot had quite a twist at the end that will surely surprise you if no one has spoiled it for you yet.  Most of the essential Scooby elements are there.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that they ""updated"" Scooby Doo a bit too much.  They interjected way too much R&B-type music and humor that just wasn't there in the original ... and wasn't necessary in the remake.  Each persona's quirks or tendencies were magnified with the exception of Shaggy who, again, was true to form.  I might have toned it down and kept the characters more in line with the original.

It stars Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini as Velma.  The plot revolves around the group's mystery solving team, Mystery Inc.  The group has split up after differences among the members surfaced.  However, two years later, each receives a letter from the owner of Spooky Island, a hot spring break resort.  Apparently, some supernatural forces have been at work on the island, and the group has been summoned to see if they can help.  However, each does not know that anyone else has been invited, so its a shock when everyone arrives at the airport and discovers that they're all going to the same place.  Will everyone be able to put their differences aside and solve the mystery?I thought the acting in the movie was pretty good overall. However, I thought Fred's character was too preppy and self-involved. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a good job as Daphnie, and Linda Cardellini makes a perfect Velma, but this movie belongs to Matthew Lillard.  His portyayal of Shaggy is top notch.  He even sounds like the old Saturday morning character that we grew up with.  His relationship with Scooby is just like I remember as a child.

Whatever the director and producers were trying to achieve by bringing Hanna-Barbera's classic cartoon to life, it's fairly safe to say they failed.  Despite excellent character interpretations by Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini as Shaggy and Velma, the fleshing out of the Mystery Inc. team is disappointingly shallow.  As is the irritating mission of self-discovery and angst each character goes through before discovering that (surprise, surprise) teamwork is best.The film could be forgiven many of its foibles if only it was rib-ticklingly hilarious.  Unfortunately it suffers from trying to cater both to a young audience, and also to adults who fondly remember the cartoon from their childhood days.  Rowan Atkinson is cringingly unfunny as the strange proprietor of Spooky Island amusement park, and surely even kids are by now impervious to fart and snot jokes.  However, the sequence inside the spooky abandoned castle raises a few hearty chuckles.The trademark unlikeliness of the situations Mystery Inc. got themselves into in the cartoon doesn't transfer well into realism.  The plot, which has a number of large holes, concerns the mysterious change in behaviour of college students who are holidaying at the resort of Spooky Island.  And, it has to be admitted, that thanks to some great sets and the wonders of CGI, the resort looks like a pretty cool place to spend a vacation.  The construction of the theme park has awakened some ancient (and quite scary, considering the PG-rating) monsters, so it's up to the team to unmask the villain and save the world.

So many heavy-hitters have not been released, and so much junk has. Sadly this film falls into the latter category.Scooby-Doo had alot of potential--the CGI Scooby was done pretty well, the rest of the gang was fairly well-cast, and the actor who played Shaggy was all but perfect for the role. But the plot is terrible--I bought the DVD, watched it once, and have never wanted to watch it again. I can't understand why movies like this even see release on a format that is still very new--why waste money putting out junk like this when there are much better movies that haven't seen release? In my opinion (and that's all it is), a good 1/4 or 1/5 of the Blu-Ray titles available are like that. I just scratch my head trying to figure out who would *want* something like that in hi-def. Maybe if you have alot of money to waste, I guess.Scooby-Doo is the kind of movie to buy from the discount DVD rack for $5, knowing not to expect much.

I think that just about any person on the planet who saw the old Scooby cartoons when they were still actually broadcast on television should see this movie, but try not to get too worked up about it because....There is almost no attention paid to the power of the old Scooby &quot;franchise&quot;.  Old fans will not quite recognize what they liked so much about the cartoon, new fans will not be able to make the connection to what the old fans were raving about in the first place, etc.No attempt was made to exploit any of the &quot;subversive&quot; subtext of the cartoon (i.e., that Shaggy is always hungry because he's something of a pothead and has the munchies on a regular basis).  There was ample opportunity to dress everyone in this movie in the dreckiest 70's outfits imaginable, which would have been kind of funny.  My guess is that Daphne/Buffy said &quot;no way, I'm not wearing that thing&quot;.  Daphne/Buffy also got her boyfriend onto the set (news flash...Freddie Prinz, Jr. is not convincing as a blond).  It turns out she's responsible for more evil-doing than the vampires give her credit for.Scooby is not an exact duplicate of the cartoon character, even though he is a cartoon.  Scooby's eyes are too big (and too black...maybe Scoob is the one with the recreational drug problem).  Something there is about a live-action film that does not love a cartoon.  Maybe there was a test run performed with a &quot;small-eyed&quot; computer-generated Scooby, and it just didn't look right.

As much as I despise him, I have to say that Matthew Lillard does an excellent job as Shaggy.  He's the best character in this flick.  Linda Cardellini is good as Velma, but she has a couple of lines(ex. &quot;Let's get jinky with it&quot;) that are just atrocious.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. wasn't necessarily miscast as Fred, but the character was portrayed in a way that doesn't really reflect the character from the original show.  Sarah Michelle Gellar was annoying as Daphne.  Nevermind the fact that she pulled out the old kung-fu ala &quot;Buffy,&quot; she's just not convincing enough in this role.  The CGI Scooby was just that, a CGI Scooby.  He looks fake, but dogs can't talk either, so I'm okay with that.  His character is actually pretty good.The best part of this film is the opening scene with the Luna ghost.  It looked as if it were straight out of the old series.  Everything heads south from there.  The characters, excepting Shaggy and Scooby, are weightless.  The nasties are just plain silly and the jokes resort to sophomoric humor.  I'm sure every thirteen year-old boy in the crowd got a laugh from the farting contest between Shaggy and Scooby.  A few cuss words were thrown around, and Daphne puts a whipping on a wrestler-type baddie.Overall, this film works well with kids between the ages of eleven and sixteen.  Younger kids MIGHT get scared by the bad guys, and the language can get a little rough for the really young'uns.  For us older folks who grew up with the series, it's nice to see Scooby and the gang in a live-action format.  However, I feel that this movie tries too hard to make itself appeal to all age groups.  I also think that the director should have decided on whether he was making a nostalgic flick, a spoof, or an updated version using potty humor.It's watchable and somewhat funny, but you might want to rent this one before laying any money down for it.",3,"Okay at best, but it doesn't beat the original series",1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,1993,"['quot', 'Scooby-Doo', 'quot', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'As', 'much', 'despise', 'have', 'say', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'excellent', 'job', 'Shaggy', 'best', 'character', 'flick', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'good', 'Velma', 'couple', 'lines', 'ex', 'quot', 'Let', 'get', 'jinky', 'quot', 'are', 'just', 'atrocious', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'miscast', 'Fred', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'way', ""n't"", 'really', 'reflect', 'character', 'original', 'show', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'was', 'annoying', 'Daphne', 'Nevermind', 'fact', 'pulled', 'out', 'old', 'kung-fu', 'ala', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'quot', 'just', 'not', 'convincing', 'enough', 'role', 'CGI', 'Scooby', 'was', 'just', 'that', 'CGI', 'Scooby', 'fake', 'dogs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'either', ""'m"", 'okay', 'character', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'Luna', 'ghost', 'looked', 'were', 'straight', 'old', 'series', 'Everything', 'heads', 'south', 'there', 'characters', 'excepting', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'are', 'weightless', 'nasties', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'jokes', 'resort', 'sophomoric', 'humor', ""'m"", 'sure', 'thirteen', 'year-old', 'boy', 'crowd', 'got', 'laugh', 'farting', 'contest', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'A', 'few', 'cuss', 'words', 'were', 'thrown', 'around', 'Daphne', 'whipping', 'wrestler-type', 'baddie.Overall', 'film', 'well', 'kids', 'ages', 'eleven', 'sixteen', 'Younger', 'kids', 'MIGHT', 'get', 'scared', 'bad', 'guys', 'language', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'rough', 'really', 'older', 'folks', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'series', 'nice', 'see', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'live-action', 'format', 'However', 'feel', 'movie', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'appeal', 'age', 'groups', 'also', 'think', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'decided', 'was', 'making', 'nostalgic', 'flick', 'spoof', 'updated', 'version', 'using', 'potty', 'humor.It', 'watchable', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'one', 'laying', 'money', 'down']",Scooby-Doo

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 2]","I had heard so many negative things about this movie that it took me a long time to gain the courage to watch it.  I'm glad I did.  While Freddie Prinze, Jr., and Sarah Michelle Gellar appear initially miscast as Fred Jones, and Daphne Blake, by the end of the movie you can sort of see it.  The real winners here are Matthew Lillard in his best role ever as Shaggy and a digital Scooby-Doo.The beginning of the movie find the team of ghost hunters split up due principally to the personalities of Daphne and Fred.  Scooby and Shaggy are, as usual, interested in food, surfing, and food, remaining true to themselves.  The owner of an island amusement park invites all of them, separately, to the island to help solve a mystery.  After the not-quite-together team realizes there is a real mystery, the five some slowly grow together into the best team they have ever been.The plot of movie is relatively unimportant.  We have seen plots similar to these in dozens of animated Scooby Doo cartoons.  We loved them.  You will recognize the essence of those plots in this movie.I was initially uncomfortable with how Daphne and Fred were played.  I was expecting both characters to act more as they were in the cartoons.  However, as the movie progressed I saw the method to the director's madness, and while I can't say I was ever thrilled by what I saw as a significant deviation from the cartoon characters, I tried not to get hung up on it.  I supposed I should have been uncomfortable with Scrappy Doo whizzing on Daphne, but I was never a big fan of Scrappy anyway.I have yet to mention very little about Linda Cardellini as Velma.  After Matthew Lillard's Shaggy, Linda's Velma was the next best portrayal of the Mystery, Inc., team.  Just as Matthew Lillard was Shaggy, Linda Cardellini was Velma.  Interestingly, Velma, always played as the brainy, somewhat geeky, type, is the same here, yet Linda Cardellini somehow brings a beauty to Velma that was never in the animated shorts.The real charm of this movie comes from Matthew Lillard.  I have seen him in so many movies, including others with Freddie Prinze, Jr., and while his characters were often done well, he is outstanding as Shaggy.  I think the true star of this film is Matthew Lillard, followed by the digital Scooby.  Every time I watched Matthew, it was as though Shaggy had come to life.

We were under no delusion that it would approach the cartoon too closely.However, we were not prepared for the seventh level of hell this movie took us on a ride for.  It should have had a warning label:  ""PARENTAL ADVISORY -- DANTE'S INFERNO ON THIS MOVIE.""The only character worth noting, applauding, and commiserating with is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.  He has the voice and most of the characterizations nailed pat.However, Freddie Prinze Jr. is astoundingly annoying as ""Fred""...I love Sarah Michelle Gellar in Buffy, but I cringe and wince to see what she has been reduced to here.  ... but this movie's banal plot, trite dialogue, and non-existant character development could not even give anyone room to do anything with this.Velma...oh, my.  The joke with the glasses--one of the only few nods to the original series, along with Scooby Snacks--is forced and made me want to rip my hair out.  Her giddines of finding romantic interest near the end made me cover my eyes and shake my head with despair.Scooby.  Where to start here.  The voice?  Ok, I'll give the movie credit for that.  The fart jokes?  Oh, WHY?!?  ...  And, quite frankly, the cartoon's version of Scooby looked more considerably dopey...this computer animated version doesn't have quite the screwy eyes the cartoon-counterpart had.So...to recap.  Fred, a one-dimensional show-stealing sexist teams up with vacuous Daphne along with love-deprived attention-starved Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby to go to an island whose evil villain winds up being ...  Was it meant to be funny when you found out who it was?  Maybe, but the laughter was quite firmly suppressed by the amount of forced humor, bad plot, equally bad sets, and pain...lots of pain.  Sexual humor didn't belong in a cartoon, but Daphne makes it quite implict (yet painfully clear) that the ghost is doing something he shouldn't be.  The drug humor was particularly not wanted in what was originally a CHILDREN'S CARTOON...  Other liberties that were taken?  Let's see...the monsters on the island are REAL!  That never happened in the cartoon series.  Also, I don't recall any romantic interest ever being introduced either.In the end, where do you stop?

Had that not been the case I would no doubt have passed it by.  And so I would have managed to miss the kind of utter silliness that somehow manages to entertain and warm the heart.  But be warned, if you have a low tolerance for the utterly ridiculous you may find this film a harrowing experience.The film opens with the breakup of the Scooby Gang.  Velma (Linda Cardellini) is tired of Fred (Freddie Prinz), who always taking credit for her plans.  Daphne (SMG) is tired of always being the one who is carried of by the villain.  And Shaggy (Matthew Lillard)?  Well, Shaggy and Scooby are a bit too focused on food, as usual.  Everyone stomps off in separate directions.  Two years later all meet again in an airport, having been individually invited to help investigate a problem at Spooky Island.  As Mandavarious (Rowan Atkinson) the theme park owner explains it, the college students who frequent the island on holiday are being changed somehow.  He is desperate for help.And so begins a crazy pastiche of monsters, chase scenes, dark rituals, and slapstick meant purely to entertain and amuse.  For the most part made for the young, the film appeals equally to those who recall their Scooby watching youth with fondness or who are willing to set aside all requirements of believability.  Of course, the film is almost entirely action, with only fitful attempts at character development.  For 90 minutes, director Raja Gosnell manages to make sure that there is never a moment when that lacks something diverting to capture one's attention.Initially I was a bit put off but the animation for Scooby-Doo.  But the mind's eye, wonderful organ that it is, quickly makes the adjustment.  The 'making of Scooby-Doo' extra makes quite a bit of the difficulties of acting with an animated character - of knowing where to look and how to react when there is nothing there.  And when you look at the film, the actors' interaction with Scooby is totally natural, which goes far to make it all believable.  In the final analysis, the dog comes very close to running away with the show.The film does have redeeming values, as well as being pure entertainment.  Friendship becomes one of the driving forces of the plot, much more so than it ever was in the cartoon.  One thing I did not care for was some gratuitous crudeness that I feel went too far.  Not doubt this was the reason that the film received its PG rating.

Calculated, clever, and great.Knowing that the audience would probably be a lot of adults who enjoyed the cartoons as kids, the writers combined things we love about the cartoon with the obvious flaws: what would Fred REALLY do for a living if the gang broke up? What would a Velma journey of self-discovery look like?Best of all, they took the most hated SD villain of all time (and I don't mean the Black Knight Ghost) and finally gave him what he deserved.Matthew Lillard is perfect as Shaggy. Linda Cardellini is near-perfect--a tad prettier than I imagined Velma to be, but she somehow mimics a cartoon character while authentically actin, not an easy task. Sarah Michelle Gellar acts perfectly as Daphne even if physically she isn't a just-right fit--leaving us with Freddie Prinze, who is not bad as Fred. His acting and voice are perfect but not his physique. The producers wanted a real-life couple for Fred and Daphne so that's who we got.Although Rowan Atkinson is a good villain, the part seems to have been written for someone else--and was. The very different Tim Curry was cast but bowed out after he found out who the real villain was, illustrating how passionate we are about that character.Not as wonderful as SD 2, Monsters Unleashed, but witty, well-performed, and worth your time.",4,Scooby Doo meets Into the Woods,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,1315,"['was', 'great', 'Calculated', 'clever', 'great.Knowing', 'audience', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'lot', 'adults', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'cartoons', 'kids', 'writers', 'combined', 'things', 'love', 'cartoon', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'what', 'would', 'Fred', 'REALLY', 'do', 'living', 'gang', 'broke', 'up', 'What', 'would', 'Velma', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'look', 'Best', 'took', 'most', 'hated', 'SD', 'villain', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Black', 'Knight', 'Ghost', 'finally', 'gave', 'what', 'Lillard', 'perfect', 'Shaggy', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'near-perfect', 'tad', 'prettier', 'imagined', 'Velma', 'be', 'somehow', 'mimics', 'cartoon', 'character', 'authentically', 'actin', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'perfectly', 'Daphne', 'even', 'physically', ""n't"", 'just-right', 'fit', 'leaving', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'who', 'not', 'bad', 'Fred', 'acting', 'voice', 'are', 'perfect', 'not', 'physique', 'producers', 'wanted', 'real-life', 'couple', 'Fred', 'Daphne', 'who', 'got.Although', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'good', 'villain', 'part', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'someone', 'else', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'was', 'cast', 'bowed', 'out', 'found', 'out', 'who', 'real', 'villain', 'was', 'illustrating', 'how', 'passionate', 'are', 'character.Not', 'as', 'wonderful', 'SD', '2', 'Monsters', 'Unleashed', 'witty', 'well-performed', 'time']",Scooby-Doo

As a result, I've only seen a handful of episodes of this show in my entire life.  Yet, I was curious about the live action version, so I finally sat down and watched it.The Mystery Inc. Gang is in the middle of another exciting case.  Yet when they've captured the ghost, something strange happens.  A microphone is trust into Fred's face (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and suddenly the gang starts fighting.  Velma (Linda Cardellini) is tired of Fred taking all the credit.  And Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is absolutely sick of always being the damsel in distress.  Only Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby-Doo are interested in staying together.  And so the gang breaks up.Some time later, they are brought back together by Mandavarious (Rowan Atkinson).  He owns Spooky Island, a hip college resort.  Unfortunately, his guests are arriving as normal college students and leaving as zombies.  Will the Mystery Inc. Gang be able to reconcile to solve the case?The problem with taking a half hour program and making it a full length movie is the added time.  The writers tried to deal with that my adding the conflict within the group.  However, so little time is spent on it that it feels like an after thought.  Instead, the movie spends most of its time focusing on the story, which makes sense for the most part.  There's a twist at the end that I thought was just plain weird, but maybe that's just me.  Matthew Lillard is the standout member of the cast.  His Shaggy perfectly brought the cartoon character to life.  And the computer animated Scooby, while looking like a cartoon was believable.There are some parts that might frighten small children, but most will be ok with it.

I used to watch it as a kid - and liked Daphne's whole look to be honest! (I like purple) But then they brought Scrappy Doo into the whole equasion, and almost booted Scooby out. Scooby or Scrappy? Scooby every time, there's really no contest.Then this comes out. Some people are never really sure of original cartoon character being put into a computer, and coming out nothing like how they were - for instance, the Garfield movie that is coming out this summer. He TALKS. But I'll still want to see it.There wasn't that much action in this, so that was quite disappointing. The humour was quite good, especially from the fabulous Matthew Lilliard as Shaggy. How good a choice was he for Shaggy?! Pure genius. The rest of the cast were great for Daphne, Fred &amp; a relatively unknown Linda Cardellini for Velma - who looks totally different!Maybe I wasn't getting some of this movie, but when all their inner spirits came out and swapped bodies etc, was it just me, or did Velma totally change?! Or was that supposed to be part of the story? Cos suddenly, she was still wearing that orange top, but it changed from a poloneck, into a V-neck, very low cut, and she had a pair to rival Daphne's! And then it changes back. Zoinks indeed!And Sarah Michelle Gellar is just a tad too old to be playing Daphne. If you look closely in a couple of scenes, she is wearing way too much concealer under her eyes, to cover up any possible bags, which seems almost too light for the rest of her skin, and makes her look really gaunt in the process.This is a good movie if you're a fan of Scooby Doo. The DVD has lots of extras, if you could work out how to get into them, without getting distracted by Scooby Doo messing about, and if you can get past the fact that Scooby's mouth doesn't match what he's saying (which some reviewers obviously can't), then you can sit back, relax, and enjoy.

They did an even amazing job turning Scooby Doo into a computerized live action version to where Scooby is extremely realistic. As for the cast, I heard the rumors that everyone was basically disappointed. I wasn't I thought they picked the cast perfectly for the part. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Trying to forget about her Buffy character) did a great job playing the new aged Daphne, Matthew Lillard was the best part of the casting job as Shaggy!!! Linda Cardelini was beautifully transformed into the part of Velma, and as much as I love him Freddie Prince Jr. did an ""okay"" job of Fred. Not to mention one of my favorite actors and comedians Rowan Atkinson does a fabulous job in the film. Also for the Scrappy Doo lovers, you might be suprised, but definately not disappointed. The movie is upgraded to be in ""the now."" And the background and sets are truly amazing and like a animated cartoon version for a live action movie. There is quite a bit of adult humor, but still makes if fun for young kids. I would think the film is great for ages 13 and up. But I think kids and adults will enjoy this movie from the cartoon and lovers of Scooby Doo. It does get silly in a bit parts and slow, so in that retrospect it might be dull to some. But the plot and the charaterizations performed by the cast did a brilliant job.As for the DVD I would give that an A. I loved all the extra's on the DVD. From the never seen before footage, behind the scene's documentary, an interactive triva game, Commentary from the cast and filmakers and much much more.

716355,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00006HBUA,Michael Crane,"[0, 0]","Wow, I really thought I was going to loath this movie in every shape and form.  I really did not want to see this movie, but I was forced to watch it with my family.  But to my surprise, I found the movie &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; to be pretty entertaining and decent.  It's nothing I'm going to see again any time soon, but it is a lot better than I thought it was going to be.The film version follows the cartoon pretty well.  Mystery Inc. is on the verge of breaking up forever until they are invited to a spookey theme park where the owner thinks there is something strange going on.  So it is up to them to uncover the mystery and find out why people who leave the park seem like mindless zombies.  As with the cartoons, there are tons of twist, surprises, and a logical explanation at the end.What really made me like the movie was Matthew Lillard.  He was a true spitting image of Shaggy in every possible way; he even sounded like him!  And even the animated Scooby, which I thought would turn out really bad, was very comical and convincing.  The rest of the cast was all right, but it was really Matthe Lillard who made me appreciate the movie more.The DVD is pretty cool.  Lots of special features, the picture looks great and the sound was also pretty impressive.  However, the menu is terrible!  It's very confusing to figure out which option or feature is highlighted at first.  One of the worst I have seen on a DVD in a long time.All in all, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; turned out to be an all right film.  I don't love it, but I don't hate it.  I guess it's somewhere in the middle.  Am I ever going to want to see it again.  Probably not.  But, I will say I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  If you're a fan of the cartoon show, chances are you will enjoy this movie.

As a long time fan of the cartoon, I loved how they were able to recreate the cartoon characters without trying to change them. Oh sure, there's a bit of potty humor in it, but geez, this is the age we live in. Frankly, it wasn't nearly as bad as some other movies employing the same technique. It was quite mild. The cast was incredible. Sarah Michelle Gellar can play virtually any role she wants and make believable. She's great as Daphne.

716359,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00006HBUA,Monty Moonlight,"[3, 3]","Scooby-Doo, the live-action movie, opens with the original gang solving one of their typical mysteries, the case of the Luna Ghost. Daphne has been kidnapped, Velma has a plan, Fred is giving orders, and Scooby and Shaggy are playing the fall guys. It's all very familiar, and hilarious to see in live-action, with all the physical gags of the cartoon! But when the case is solved and Fred takes the credit again, everyone (except Scooby and Shaggy) realizes how totally tired they are of the parts they play in Mysteries, Inc. Velma is tired of not getting any credit or attention, Daphne is tired of being the damsel in distress, and Fred is looking to expand his horizons on his favorite subject, himself. So, despite Scooby and Shaggy's protests, the group finally splits up after all these years.One year later, the gang finds themselves bumping into each other at an airport on their way to an amusement park resort called Spooky Island. It seems they've all been invited by the owner, Mr. Mondavarious, to investigate the strange behavior of the college kids who visit and work there. At first, Velma, Freddie, and Daphne are frustrated about running into their old friends, each one determined to solve this mystery on their own, but in time those old feelings of friendship return as they work together as a team to do what they do best. And Shaggy and Scooby couldn't be happier at the reunion, though Shaggy's attentions are divided as he channels most of his energy into wooing a young lady named Mary Jane. Together, the gang overcomes many obstacles to discover the truth behind the strange goings on at Spooky Island, and what they discover in the end is something few would ever have suspected!Scooby-Doo is a great movie! I've watched Scooby cartoons all my life, and found this movie to be tons of fun! But it's not for everyone! There are those certain Scooby fans who can't stand it when the supernatural events in a Scooby story turn out to be real instead of just a man in a mask. Well, if you're that type, you may not like this film, but then, maybe you will. See, in this movie the Mystery involves both the Supernatural, AND the villain in a mask routine! Then, believe it or not, there are those out there who are loyal fans of Scrappy-Doo! Well, if you love Scrappy, you will probably hate this movie, as it involves a lot of extreme Scrappy bashing. Yes, he's in this movie, and yes, he plays a major role (though with minimum screen time), but Scrappy is depicted in a very negative light. This was done mostly because so many fans hate Scrappy, but as I said, some people do love him. As for me, I like him okay, loved him as a kid, but I can go both ways on the subject now, and I can easily take a little Scrappy bashing so it didn't bother me. Now, the sets in this film are amazing! Very spooky and funny at the same time! As for the casting; perfect Shaggy, great (though much more attractive than the cartoon) Velma, gorgeous as always Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a perfect Daphne, and her new hubby (grrrr) Freddie Prince, Jr. does a sufficient job with Fred, a character that was never that great to begin with. I probably wouldn't have cast Freddie P. as Fred, since the voice isn't right and he doesn't look that much like him either, but he doesn't hurt the film at all. It's not like Rosie O'Donnel trying to convince us she's Betty Rubble, ruining what otherwise was a great Flintstone movie (oh, and the kids were too old in that one, but that's a whole other review). As for the CGI Scooby and Scrappy-Doo, well, they're obviously CGI, but they're still pretty good once you adjust your eyes and your mind to ignore that aspect. They just needed some better light and shadow work in a lot of their scenes. A lot of fans didn't like the look Scooby had, but I thought it was a great interpretation of Scooby as a ""real"" dog. I mean, that's a tricky thing to have to do. Overall, this is a FUN movie, that's the key word. Even my dad sat and watched all of this one, which was surprising. Of course, some people will just watch to see Sarah Michelle Gellar I suppose. I should also point out that Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) plays Mr. Mondavarious, and gives one of his usual hilarious performances! The DVD is great by the way, with some nice behind the scenes stuff, and a great CAST commentary! Definitely a must own for fans of Scooby-Doo or cartoon movies in general (By the way, if you like this one be sure to get the Josie and the Pussycats live-action movie)! The deleted scenes on the Scooby-Doo DVD are really great, and most, if not all of them, would have been great to see in the actual film! Especially the wonderful animated opening! They truly should have left that one in! As for the sequels that were talked about so much on the commentary, I'm looking forward to them, but I better see Scooby-Dum in one of them, and please, no Scooby-Dum bashing! I love that guy! Dum dum dum duuummmmmm!",5,A great movie for this long-time Scooby fan!,1035158400,"10 21, 2002",2002,4950,"['Scooby-Doo', 'live-action', 'movie', 'original', 'gang', 'solving', 'one', 'typical',

When Buffy first premiered on the WB network in the spring of '97, I knew from the start that Sarah would be the best actress to play Daphne Blake. Her future husband, Freddie Prinze, Jnr.

Carnegie,"[20, 35]","I didn't watch this by choice and I don't usually like to write such short negative reviews as this but Scooby Doo really is up there with the worst that Hollywood has to offer. It's also hard to understand who this movie was aimed at. True, my six and four year old nephews seemed to enjoy it but then when you are that age a prolonged farting competition between Shaggy and Scooby is probably very funny. However it also has some gay innuendo at the expense of Freddie Prinze's character Fred and its cast seems very obviously aimed at the teen market (surely teenagers don't have that poor a taste)? Of said cast the only performance I can recommend is that of Mathew Lillard as Shaggy who has the voice of the famous cartoon character down to a T. As for Scooby himself I was relatively unimpressed with the CGI canine and I am not at all surprised that Mike Myers decided not to pursue this project.

Not usaully old cartoons, like Scooby-Doo is, but I'll watch it if I have nothing else to do. Of course, it won't make me laugh or anything, but its entertainment. When I heard they were making a Scooby-Doo movie, all I did was shrug and say ""ah"". I planned on seeing it. I tryed a couple of times to see it theaters, but I ended up seeing other things instead. Then, it came out on video, and I rented it. The first 5 minutes, where the ""gang"" are in the factory, I thought ""God, I'm not going to watch all of this junk"", and ""Oh, yeah, that looks real"". I thought that 'til right up when the marijuana reference kicked in. (The part where Shaggy says ""Me & Scoob went to do what we do best"", an then all the smoke comes out of the van, and turns out to just be smoke from a grill.) That got a laugh. After that, I was pretty open to the rest of the movie. And there are about 2 more references to drugs after that (""I got a bag of...hamburgers"", ""Mary Jane? That's my favorite name!""). And the movie isn't just a complete imitation of the 60's show (which you could tell by what you just read), and in some parts, it actully spoofs it. The only problem is the special effects. I'm sure this movie got a HUGE budget, and they could afford better effects for (at least) Scooby-Doo, the so-called star.

But overall, it made me want to turn it off and put in the original cartoon instead.What this film does right is the sets, costuming and props. They all have to perfect mix of the cartoon and the real world. It really feels like the world of Scooby-Doo could exist somewhere. Also, the performance by Matthew Lillard as Shaggy is dead-on. He is perfect in the role. Also the voice of Scooby is dead-on as well, but unfortunately all the other actors are not quite the same.Freddy Prinze's Fred is very much off. It didn't seem like him at all. Daphne was too quirky for her own good, and Velma's characterization was close, but no cigar. Perhaps most disappointing was the CGI Scooby, who was too cartoony next to the real actors. The lighting on the CGI was always too bright for conditions, and over-all provided a distraction.The story also seemed to drag halfway through, like it was a plot for a half-hour cartoon stretched into a feature length film (which it basically is). It just seems like the stories of Scooby-Doo are better suited for short cartoons.

With that thought, I have all the reasons to tell you the truth about this horrible cash-in movie: IF YOU REALLY ARE A SCOOBY DOO FAN AND REALLY LIKE YOUR CHILDRENS, DO EVERYTHING THAT'S POSSIBLE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!! IT'S A DISGRACE, IT SIMPLY RUINS WITH SCOOBY DOO'S GOOD NAME! Freddie seems like Johnny Bravo, Daphne is a frightened young child who wants to prove something for people, Velma are a dumb, and one scene, Scooby (the first character that are 99% good) and Shaggy (the second character that are 99% good) are competing who farts harder. Worst: there are not a single funny joke in the whole movie (except the end, that reminds me ""Scooby Doo on Zombie Island""), the story is a disgrace, far from the interesting misteries Scooby and the guys always solved on the cartoons. And to disgrace even more: Scrappy Doo are the main bad guy!!! WHAT'S THIS?? IT ONLY CAN BE A VERY BAD JOKE! THAT'S NOT THE SCOOBY DOO'S REALITY, IT'S ALL WRONG!!! IF SCOOBY DO HAVE STARTED LIKE COMIC BOOK, IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED PROFANATION FOR THEIR FANS!! IF MY GRADE ARE RIGHT? NO! IT'S -5 STARS, OR WEAKER. Geez, how can awful things being so difficult to forget! That's what I want, to forget this junk forever. Now they are trying to disgrace the Scooby Doo's name a second time, so I wanna give my previous advice for people: DON'T GO TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH SCOOBY DOO 2, FORGET ABOUT, IF YOU RESPECT THE SCOOBY'S LEGACY! WAIT WHEN, REAL ARTISTS, WHO CARES ABOUT THE RIGHT THINGS, GET A GOOD STORY AND MAKE A DECENT SCOOBY DOO MOVIE, NOT THIS TRASH. At least, this movie is useful for just three things:1) To illustrate perfectly what NOT to do in a future Scooby Doo adaptation;2) To show how NOT TO DO an adaptation of a TV cartoon, or any other adaptation;3) To reinforce the idea that Scooby Doo are a FAMILY'S CARTOON and it have to remain like this, without this tragic and scatologic adaptation for disturbed teens.Ps.: Now it's the time that people starts give me negative votes about my review. Go ahead, I don't care about that! It only proves how blind people are these days. I made my part, to warn you, but if you want to continue lying to yourself, c'mon, and give me a negative vote!

Therefore, this movie breaks no new ground by giving us real monsters for the Mystery Inc. clan to discover or battle, and Im sure that any nasty little dialogue heard hear has not already been addressed to the very young by simply going to regular school with other kids.

716381,A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE,B00006HBUA,"Robert W. Berg ""Rob""","[4, 4]","""Did he just write the words 'smart' and 'witty' in reference to the new 'Scooby Doo' movie?"" you might ask. Well, yes I just did! I saw this film in the movie theatre on a blind date, and we both had a great time...and mind you, we went at a matinee on a Sunday. The theatre was swarming with kids, and you know what? Still had a good time.The film's greatest strengths lie in its screenplay and in its amazing cast. The screenplay wisely spoofs the ""Scooby Doo"" cartoon gently, while at the same time paying loving homage to it. This is not a mean parody, but obviously the work of a writer who understood ""Scooby"" and, as a fan, is better able to crack jokes about everything from the purported drug subtext to the detestable Scrappy Doo. A ""Scooby"" project that will actually admit what a horrible creature Scrappy is...well, you just have to respect that. No, this movie does not have a deep plot...but, IT'S SCOOBY DOO! IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO! How many ""Scooby"" cartoons have you seen that have changed your life? Ummm? Did you just say ""None""? Now, you get the point!I will say that the film breaks the ""Scooby"" rule only in one area. The ""surprise"" ending where they reveal the identity of the bad guy...is actually a surprise. Which is really quite surprising in and of itself.Now I have to rave about two particular cast members...Sarah Michelle Gellar and Matthew Lillard, who were so pitch-perfect in their respective renditions of Daphne and Shaggy that you would swear that the cartoon versions were ripped right off the animation cells and brought to life. SMG has proven her comedy chops and brilliant sense of timing in ""Cruel Intentions,"" and on special comedic episodes of ""Buffy."" Well, this is her first full-out comedic role in a film that you'll actually want to see (I'm discounting ""Simply Irresistable""...Ugh!), and she is a joy to watch. In one particularly great scene, she and Fred's souls switch bodies. Her jubilant expressions, when she, as Fred, touches Daphne's breasts, are an absolute riot. And there's Matthew Lillard, who captures all the sweetness, innocence, lovability and doltishness of Shaggy. He is not only funny but actually touching at times.Freddie Prinze and the girl who played Velma are not quite as good...but they're more than passable.The computer-animated Scooby, however, is wonderful. It perfectly mixes the look of a ""real"" dog with cartoonish expressions. In fact, from posters and TV commericals, I thought Scooby looked not so great, but when you see him in the movie for extended periods, he looks absolutley perfect. He is far better than most CGI I've seen in any film (leaves ""Harry Potter""'s pathetic attempts at CGI in the dust), except for, perhaps, ""Lord of the Rings.""With all of this said, I'm not sure how well this movie would play for someone who is not a fan of the cartoon or has just never seen it. The movie is very dependant on in-jokes, so my review is from the persepective of a Scooby-phile. If you are one, I promise you will dig this movie. If you aren't, you might still enjoy it, but not quite ""get"" all of it. I'd recommend a weekend spent watching reruns on the Cartoon Network before you watch this film.",4,"A smart, witty sendup of the old ""Scooby Doo"" cartoons...",1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,3191,"['Did', 'just', 'write', 'words', ""'witty"", 'reference', 'new', 'Doo', 'movie', 'might', 'ask', 'Well', 'yes', 'just', 'did', 'saw', 'film', 'movie', 'theatre', 'blind', 'date', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'mind', 'went', 'matinee', 'Sunday', 'theatre', 'was', 'swarming', 'kids', 'know', 'what', 'Still', 'had', 'good', 'time.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'lie', 'screenplay', 'amazing', 'cast', 'screenplay', 'wisely', 'spoofs', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'cartoon', 'gently', 'same', 'time', 'paying', 'loving', 'homage', 'not', 'mean', 'parody', 'obviously', 'work', 'writer', 'who', 'understood', 'Scooby', 'fan', 'better', 'able', 'crack', 'jokes', 'everything', 'purported', 'drug', 'subtext', 'detestable', 'Scrappy', 'Doo', 'A', 'Scooby', 'project', 'will', 'actually', 'admit', 'what', 'horrible', 'creature', 'Scrappy', 'well', 'just', 'have', 'respect', 'No', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'deep', 'plot', 'IT', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', 'IT', 'NOT', 'SUPPOSED', 'TO', 'How', 'many', 'Scooby', 'cartoons', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'changed', 'life', 'Ummm', 'Did', 'just', 'say', 'None', 'Now', 'get', 'point', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'Scooby', 'rule', 'only', 'one', 'area', 'surprise', 'ending', 'where', 'reveal', 'identity', 'bad', 'guy', 'actually', 'surprise', 'Which', 'really', 'quite', 'surprising', 'itself.Now', 'have', 'rave', 'two', 'particular', 'cast', 'members', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'pitch-perfect', 'respective', 'renditions', 'Daphne', 'Shaggy', 'would', 'swear', 'cartoon', 'versions', 'were', 'ripped', 'right', 'animation', 'cells', 'brought', 'life', 'SMG', 'proven', 'comedy', 'chops', 'brilliant', 'sense', 'timing', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'special', 'comedic', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'Well', 'first', 'full-out', 'comedic', 'role', 'film', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'want', 'see', ""'m"", 'discounting', 'Simply', 'Irresistable', 'Ugh', 'joy', 'watch', 'one', 'particularly', 'great', 'scene', 'Fred', 'souls', 'switch', 'bodies', 'jubilant', 'expressions', 'when', 'Fred', 'Daphne', 'breasts', 'are', 'absolute', 'riot', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'who', 'sweetness', 'innocence', 'lovability', 'doltishness', 'Shaggy', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'actually', 'touching', 'times.Freddie', 'Prinze', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Velma', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', ""'re"", 'more', 'passable.The', 'computer-animated', 'Scooby', 'however', 'wonderful', 'perfectly', 'look', 'real', 'dog', 'cartoonish', 'expressions', 'fact', 'posters', 'TV', 'commericals', 'thought', 'Scooby', 'looked', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'extended', 'periods', 'absolutley', 'perfect', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'CGI', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'CGI', 'dust', 'perhaps', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'would', 'play', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'fan', 'cartoon', 'just', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'very', 'dependant', 'in-jokes', 'review', 'persepective', 'Scooby-phile', 'are', 'one', 'promise', 'will', 'dig', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'might', 'still', 'enjoy', 'not', 'quite', 'get', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'weekend', 'spent', 'watching', 'reruns', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'watch', 'film']",Scooby-Doo

716383,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006HBUA,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 4]","The movie version of ""Scooby Doo"" does a good job capturing the look, the sound and the feel of the original cartoon series - which may explain why it works effectively for the first 15 minutes or so and for no time thereafter.  The creators of the show knew what they were doing when they limited their running time to a mere half hour (minus commercials).  And, even though the film lasts only a short 86 minutes itself, this particular installment is still a full hour longer than any ""Scooby Doo"" episode has a right to be.Although the film itself is a witless bore, special praise should still be lavished on Matthew Lillard, who does a bang up job as Shaggy, Scooby's hyperkinetic best friend.  Lillard has nailed down the look, the voice and the mannerisms of the character to a tee and one hopes his career will go far once he ends up in more substantive vehicles than the one he is trapped in here.  The other actors (Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar and Linda Cardellini) provide the requisite energy for the roles they've been called on to play and cannot be held responsible for the overall shoddy nature of the uninspired screenplay.  As with most modern day ""event"" pictures, the special effects here end up overwhelming the pedestrian storyline, but this lowest-common-denominator aspiration seems to be what pulls in the big box office bucks these days so I guess we're stuck with it, at least for the foreseeable future.  Scooby Doo himself seems like just another CGI effect, partly because, as a character, his inarticulateness ends up relegating him to the status of secondary player in his own movie.  He just doesn't seem very important to the action of the story.""Scooby Doo"" has a nice, sunny look to it and it is never really offensively bad.

No matter how many of the movies they try to make (Let's hope they stop at 2), the cartoon will always be the best!!!Being a fan of the cartoon I was not sure I would enjoy the movie.  The movie stars Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Geller as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini as Velma.  I have to say I do not like Freddie Prinze as Fred.  Freddie Prinze is a horrible, horrible, horrible Fred.  Matthew Lillard is perfect as Shaggy.  The action in the film starts right away which I like.The Mystery Inc. group break up after arguing over who should take credit for solving a case.  Velma is tired of Fred taking the credit, and quits.  Fred and Daphne follow suit, leaving Shaggy and Scooby Doo on their own.  A year later the gang end up coming back together when a mysterious theme park owner's beckons for their help.  There are strange things taking place and he wants their help to find the menace that seems to be taking over his young customers.  Their fee for solving the case will be $10,000 and all you can eat.  When they arrive at the park, they find some zombie like teenagers boarding a boat. Turns out a spell is cast on the island. Each member tries to solve the crime on their own, but they find they have no choice but to come together and solve the mystery as a team.Shaggy meets the girl of his dreams named Mary Jane (get it?)  who also likes to eat Scooby snacks.  Matthew Lillard really played his part well.  He looked like Shaggy, and he sounded exactly like Shaggy from the cartoon.  He was cast perfectly!!!Daphne pulls out her ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" moves in the film. I don't recall the cartoon Daphne fighting like that at all.To the reviewer who said ""filmmakers should keep women in mind when they make comedies.  Women do not find flatulence the least bit funny"" please speak for yourself!!!!  You cannot speak for all women in general.  As a woman I actually find that type of thing pretty funny.  Then again I have a crazy sense of humor.The park owner is Mr. Emile Montevarioous played by Rowan Atkins (Mr. Bean Rat Race).  There are some neat cameo appearances that add to the fun in this film.  Miguel A. Nunez Jr. (Thin Line between Love and Hate, Life) also stars in the film.There were moments during the film I laughed a whole lot.  Scooby and Shaggy have a major belching, and farting contest.  I found that to be quite hilarious.  The ending to me was a surprise in terms of who he villain was.  Totally unexpected.I thought the movie was fun, and it's one I would consider watching again.  As a Scooby cartoon fan, I was satisfied with the film.",3,I actually enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would,1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,2713,"['was', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'live-action', 'version', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'try', 'make', 'Let', 'hope', 'stop', '2', 'cartoon', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'best', 'Being', 'fan', 'cartoon', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'movie', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Fred', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Geller', 'Daphne', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Shaggy', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'Velma', 'have', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Fred', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'Fred', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'perfect', 'Shaggy', 'action', 'film', 'right', 'away', 'like.The', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'group', 'break', 'up', 'arguing', 'who', 'should', 'take', 'credit', 'solving', 'case', 'Velma', 'tired', 'Fred', 'taking', 'credit', 'quits', 'Fred', 'Daphne', 'follow', 'suit', 'leaving', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'own', 'year', 'later', 'gang', 'end', 'up', 'coming', 'back', 'together', 'when', 'mysterious', 'theme', 'park', 'owner', 'beckons', 'help', 'are', 'strange', 'things', 'taking', 'place', 'help', 'find', 'menace', 'be', 'taking', 'young', 'customers', 'fee', 'solving', 'case', 'will', 'be', '10,000', 'can', 'eat', 'When', 'arrive', 'park', 'find', 'zombie', 'teenagers', 'boarding', 'boat', 'out', 'spell', 'cast', 'island', 'member', 'solve', 'crime', 'own', 'find', 'have', 'choice', 'come', 'together', 'solve', 'mystery', 'team.Shaggy', 'girl', 'dreams', 'named', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'get', 'who', 'also', 'eat', 'Scooby', 'snacks', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'really', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'looked', 'Shaggy', 'sounded', 'exactly', 'Shaggy', 'cartoon', 'was', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'Daphne', 'out', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'moves', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'cartoon', 'Daphne', 'fighting', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'keep', 'women', 'mind', 'when', 'make', 'comedies', 'Women', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'flatulence', 'least', 'bit', 'funny', 'please', 'speak', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'women', 'general', 'woman', 'actually', 'find', 'type', 'thing', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Then', 'again', 'have', 'crazy', 'sense', 'humor.The', 'park', 'owner', 'Mr.', 'Emile', 'Montevarioous', 'played', 'Rowan', 'Atkins', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Rat', 'Race', 'are', 'neat', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'add', 'fun', 'film', 'Miguel', 'A.', 'Nunez', 'Jr.', 'Thin', 'Line', 'Love', 'Hate', 'Life', 'also', 'film.There', 'were', 'moments', 'film', 'laughed', 'whole', 'lot', 'Scooby', 'Shaggy', 'have', 'major', 'belching', 'farting', 'contest', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'ending', 'was', 'surprise', 'terms', 'who', 'villain', 'was', 'Totally', 'unexpected.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'one', 'would', 'consider', 'watching', 'again', 'Scooby', 'cartoon', 'fan', 'was', 'satisfied', 'film']",Scooby-Doo
716390,A3TXPVSQ4LUQGK,B00006HBUA,"""sonnetinkinston""","[1, 1]","I am so tired of seeing the horrible reviews this movie recieved.  I am 20, so no, I didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's watching this show.  However, I DID grow up in the 80's and 90's watching this show, so maybe I just have a different take.  Okay, so Freddy Prinze, Jr. was not the most perfect choice for Fred.  A lot of reviews resent his representation as an attention starved and fame hogging character, but I have to say that while the movie took it to the extreme, it by no means pulled it out of thin air.  And Daphne was always getting captured and lost in the spooky old dungeons and mansions, and it was normally Velma or (Duh duh duh!) good ol' Freddy to the rescue.  And the romantic connection everyone is claiming came from nowhere at the end of the movie?  Were ya'll even watching?!?  While Gellar and Prinze may only have been chosen for their star power and not for their excellent casting as the characters, they DO portray the relationship that we all know existed between Daphne and Fred rather well.  And NO ONE can tell me Velma and Shaggy weren't brilliantly casted!The plot, while not in the &quot;Scooby Doo, Where are you?&quot; fashion, is more along the lines of &quot;The Thirteen Ghosts of Scooby Doo&quot; minus Vincent Price.  The monsters are real, not masked men. And for all the Christians bashing the movie for that reason, be forewarned, if you deny the existence of evil in the world, regardless of your religion, then you open yourself to it.  Being unaware doesn't exclude.  Besides, this was a FUN, FAMILY ORIENTED movie, remember.  The occult elements were in Scooby Doo fashion, discovering new legends associated with the area in which they are investigating the mystery.In essence, if you enjoy this movie for what it was intended to be, which was a fresh representation of fantastic characters, which remains true to the ideas implied in the series, as well as a fun film, then you'll get the point.

When I heard a few years ago that they were planning on making a live action film, I was excited. Then I heard that Sarah Michelle Gellar had been cast as Daphne and Freddie Prince, Jr. had been cast as Fred. I almost choked. I knew then that this movie was doomed from the start. And boy was it ever.Most of the casting was terrible. The story is garbage. Though this is marketed as a family film, SCOOBY-DOO is anything but family fare. The plot revolves around soul sucking monsters bent on taking over the world. The setting for this delightful concept is a horror theme park, including rides where a person could literally lose their head.The film is neither a parody nor remake of the original cartoon series and therefore it seriously flounders. Had it been a parody (ala THE BRADY BUNCH), it could have worked. Had it been a remake (ala THE ADDAMS FAMILY) it would probably have worked. However, the film does neither and totally strays from the spirit of the series.In fact, the movie has only one thing going for it: Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. It's either a tribute to his talent or a statement about how bad SCOOBY-DOO is, but Lillard gives one of the finest comic performances of the year. His portrayal of Shaggy is flawless and is the only reason to watch this film.True Scooby-Doo fans will be repulsed by this film and those who don't know better don't need to have their minds warped by seeing such a disgrace to a cartoon classic.",2,Doomed from the Start,1052265600,"05 7, 2003",2003,1586,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Scooby-Doo', 'once', 'weekday', 'afternoon', 'once', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'used', 'love', 'watching', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'When', 'heard', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'planning', 'making', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'excited', 'Then', 'heard', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'Daphne', 'Freddie', 'Prince', 'Jr.', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'Fred', 'almost', 'choked', 'knew', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'doomed', 'start', 'boy', 'was', 'ever.Most', 'casting', 'was', 'terrible', 'story', 'garbage', 'marketed', 'family', 'film', 'SCOOBY-DOO', 'anything', 'family', 'fare', 'plot', 'soul', 'sucking', 'monsters', 'bent', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'setting', 'delightful', 'concept', 'horror', 'theme', 'park', 'including', 'rides', 'where', 'person', 'could', 'literally', 'lose', 'head.The', 'film', 'parody', 'remake', 'original', 'cartoon', 'series', 'seriously', 'flounders', 'Had', 'been', 'parody', 'THE', 'BRADY', 'BUNCH', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'Had', 'been', 'remake', 'THE', 'ADDAMS', 'FAMILY', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'worked', 'However', 'film', 'totally', 'strays', 'spirit', 'series.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'going', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Shaggy', 'tribute', 'talent', 'statement', 'how', 'bad', 'SCOOBY-DOO', 'Lillard', 'one', 'finest', 'comic', 'performances', 'year', 'portrayal', 'Shaggy', 'flawless', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'film.True', 'Scooby-Doo', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'repulsed', 'film', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'minds', 'warped', 'seeing', 'disgrace', 'cartoon', 'classic']",Scooby-Doo

Who but Gosnell could have translated into live-action the existential miasma that permeated the original cartoons like an inky cloak, a cloak that invariably contained Mr. McGumbly underneath many layers of hideous disguises, like a ghoulish matryoshka doll?Mr. Gosnell must be part Dane himself to convey with such unerring poignancy the deeply lachrymose yet pulchritudinous serial existence of Scooby, an existence bound in the tiny nutshell of the Mystery Machine and the stagnation of comic foils such as Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne, with the sometime, though never often enough, appearance of that intrepid eyas Scrappy-Doo.

716405,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B00006HBUA,William R. Hancock,"[3, 4]","Well, ""Soitenly""!!!!! I mean, Jinkies, this IS the Scoobster, even if he is a little physically altered by his CGI conversion to pseudo-reality.But, is it any good? Well, actually, yes it is. Could have been BETTER, I think, but it was passable enough...and enjoyable enough...as lightweight entertainment. Better than that if you evaluate it solely as a ""kiddie"" movie.If you want to analyze it as ""Cinema"", it has to get mixed reviews. It was only partially well-cast. Matthew Lillard as Shaggy OWNS the show. He IS the shagster. All the body language, the vocal nuances, the facial expressions, the ""eye language"", it is all there. If anybody else could top Lillard as the definitive Shaggy, I'd be interested to hear who it could be. And Linda Cardellini as Velma was also an inspired choice. Could have been that Christina Ricci might have done equally well, but who is to say? The Cardellini performance is fine with me.I am mixed in my feelings about Sarah Michelle Gellar's Daphne. She plays this a lot more neurotically and with a lot more of a chip on her shoulder than any  recollected visions I have of the basically good hearted ol' ""Daph"". And one just KNEW, going in, that the producers would work to play to Gellar's ""Buffy"" persona at some point, and sure enough, they did (Tho' I admit, I liked the ... kicking she dished out to Scrappy's masked wrestle-mania henchman, and the subsequent disruption of the little creep's plans that flowed from it).Freddie Prinz's Fred Jones just doesn't hit it with me, though. His is the one characterization I can't buy into here. He is just totally miscast. He doesn't look good as a blonde, he doesn't look like the cartoon Fred Jones, and his runaway conceit is a bit too over the top.The dog also doesn't look totally like the cartoon Scooby, but then, SO WHAT? Big whiff. Nobody else looks identical to THEIR cartoon counterparts either.The sequential presentation is a little skewed, with the best sequences coming right at the beginning (The Luna Ghost), but all in all this is fun hokum that mostly works( the ""paging Mr. Doo"" sequence is a hoot). I paid for a ticket to see it in the theatre and then shelled out for the DVD. As tight as I am reputed to be, I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't liked the overall effort.If one is a long-term ""Scoobster"" fan, though, there is one single scene in this movie that makes any & all of its faults totally irrelevant.  A to-die-for moment that many people have waited YEARS just HOPING to see. And director Rajah Gosnell gives it to you. FINALLY! What is it? Oh, Come onnnnnnnn! How can you ASK???It's when Scooby , at long last, BUSTS SCRAPPY'S CHOPS!!! Makes you want to STAND UP AND CHEER!!!!!Now if these folks at WB/Cartoon Network want to continue on down the sequel road (and Scooby II is about wrapped, I understand), then I would suggest the following to them; take a cue from the old ""Scooby Doo Movies"" guest-star format (no, I don't mean Pam Anderson!) and cut a distribution deal with Universal. Then go Computer Graphic Imagery crazy and send the gang to Universal's famed, fictional east European monster world (No, not Transylvania)...Vasaria. And by means of CGI hook them up with a Bela Lugosi Dracula, a Boris Karloff Frankenstein Monster, A Chaney, Jr., Wolfman, a Dwight Frye Renfield, and a Lugosi (again) Igor. Add Abbott & Costello to the mix....AND Cassandra Peterson as Elvira and Darren McGavin (""younged up"" via CGI like Anthony Hopkins in ""Red Dragon"") asKarl Kolchak. Add ""The Monster Mash"" to the proceedings and GO WITH THE FLOW!Oh, yes...one more thing, Warner Brothers (and Dot). In future let's use the straight-up version of the original theme song a little more in the credits, how about? I'm not saying don't use more contemporary stuff here and there, but...hey...lets always give a nod to the original vision when we can.Deal?",3,Would You Watch It For a Scooby Snack???,1068768000,"11 14, 2003",2003,3875,"['Well', 'Soitenly', 'mean', 'Jinkies', 'Scoobster', 'even', 'little', 'physically', 'altered', 'CGI', 'conversion', 'pseudo-reality.But', 'good', 'Well', 'actually', 'yes', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'BETTER', 'think', 'was', 'passable', 'enough', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'lightweight', 'entertainment', 'Better', 'evaluate', 'solely', 'kiddie', 'movie.If', 'want', 'analyze', 'Cinema', 'get', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'was', 'only', 'partially', 'well-cast', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Shaggy', 'OWNS', 'show', 'shagster', 'body', 'language', 'vocal', 'nuances', 'facial', 'expressions', 'eye', 'language', 'there', 'anybody', 'else', 'could', 'top', 'Lillard', 'definitive', 'Shaggy', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'hear', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'Velma', 'was', 'also', 'inspired', 'choice', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'equally', 'well', 'who', 'say', 'Cardellini', 'performance', 'fine', 'me.I', 'am', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Daphne', 'lot', 'more', 'neurotically', 'lot', 'more', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'recollected', 'visions', 'have', 'basically', 'good', 'hearted', 'ol', 'Daph', 'one', 'just', 'KNEW', 'going', 'producers', 'would', 'work', 'play', 'Gellar', 'Buffy', 'persona', 'point', 'sure', 'enough', 'did', 'Tho', 'admit', 'liked', 'kicking', 'dished', 'out', 'Scrappy', 'masked', 'wrestle-mania', 'henchman', 'subsequent', 'disruption', 'little', 'creep', 'plans', 'flowed', 'Prinz', 'Fred', 'Jones', 'just', ""n't"", 'hit', 'though', 'one', 'characterization', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'here', 'just', 'totally', 'miscast', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'blonde', ""n't"", 'look', 'cartoon', 'Fred', 'Jones', 'runaway', 'conceit', 'bit', 'too', 'top.The', 'dog', 'also', ""n't"", 'look', 'totally', 'cartoon', 'Scooby', 'then', 'WHAT', 'Big', 'whiff', 'Nobody', 'else', 'identical', 'THEIR', 'cartoon', 'counterparts', 'either.The', 'sequential', 'presentation', 'little', 'skewed', 'best', 'sequences', 'coming', 'right', 'beginning', 'Luna', 'Ghost', 'fun', 'hokum', 'mostly', 'paging', 'Mr.', 'Doo', 'sequence', 'hoot', 'paid', 'ticket', 'see', 'theatre', 'then', 'shelled', 'out', 'DVD', 'As', 'tight', 'am', 'reputed', 'be', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'had', ""n't"", 'liked', 'overall', 'effort.If', 'one', 'long-term', 'Scoobster', 'fan', 'though', 'one', 'single', 'scene', 'movie', 'faults', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'to-die-for', 'moment', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'waited', 'YEARS', 'just', 'see', 'director', 'Rajah', 'Gosnell', 'FINALLY', 'What', 'Oh', 'Come', 'onnnnnnnn', 'How', 'can', 'ASK', 'when', 'Scooby', 'long', 'last', 'BUSTS', 'SCRAPPY', 'CHOPS', 'Makes', 'want', 'STAND', 'UP', 'AND', 'CHEER', 'Now', 'folks', 'WB/Cartoon', 'Network', 'want', 'continue', 'sequel', 'road', 'Scooby', 'II', 'wrapped', 'understand', 'then', 'would', 'suggest', 'following', 'take', 'cue', 'old', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Movies', 'guest-star', 'format', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Pam', 'Anderson', 'cut', 'distribution', 'deal', 'Universal', 'Then', 'go', 'Computer', 'Graphic', 'Imagery', 'crazy', 'send', 'gang', 'Universal', 'famed', 'fictional', 'east', 'European', 'monster', 'world', 'No', 'not', 'Transylvania', 'Vasaria', 'means', 'CGI', 'hook', 'up', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'Dracula', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Frankenstein', 'Monster', 'A', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'Wolfman', 'Dwight', 'Frye', 'Renfield', 'Lugosi', 'again', 'Igor', 'Add', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'mix', 'Cassandra', 'Peterson', 'Elvira', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'younged', 'up', 'CGI', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'asKarl', 'Kolchak', 'Add', 'Monster', 'Mash', 'proceedings', 'GO', 'WITH', 'THE', 'FLOW', 'Oh', 'yes', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Dot', 'future', 'let', 'use', 'straight-up', 'version', 'original', 'theme', 'song', 'little', 'more', 'credits', 'how', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'more', 'contemporary', 'stuff', 'here', 'there', 'hey', 'always', 'give', 'nod', 'original', 'vision', 'when', 'can.Deal']",Scooby-Doo
716406,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00006HBUA,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Being a fan of the original cartoon I went to see this live-action version of ""Scooby-Doo"" in the theater in June, 2002 (Was it that long ago?). After the first 15 minutes or so I slowly became more and more disappointed. But after seeing it again last night, I must say it's better on repeat viewings.What most impressed me on my first viewing was Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Both Freddy Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Fred and Daphne weren't quite right for the roles, although serviceable. Yet this is made up for by the addition of the ultra-winsome Isla Fisher as Mary Jane. The CGI Scooby was good for the time (2002), but not as effective ten years later, but the CGI's okay, it's certainly nothing to miss the film over.What disappointed me on my initial viewing? I was hoping for a straight live-action adaption of the cartoon sorta like 1994's ""The Flintstones (Collector's Edition)."" What I got instead was part homage and part parody. This would have worked for me but the film bogged down in the ""Spooky Island"" segment, which comprised the 2nd and 3rd acts, a full hour of the film. What's wrong with this large chunk of the film? The whole ""Spooky Island"" set was just too cartooney for a live-action homage. It's hard to explain, but it just turned me off. In hindsight, I suppose the cartooniness was intended since the film's based on a cartoon (aduh).Viewing it a second time, I had the same impressions of the film up to the 30-minute mark, but the final hour won me over. How so? I still don't like the limitations of the ""Spooky Island"" set but I was impressed with the whole 'well of souls' aspect (I can't remember what they called it in the movie) and the complications thereof, as well as the ingenious way they included Scrappy-Doo in the plot. I used to think I was the only one who literally couldn't stand Scrappy-Doo, but -- after seeing this live-action movie -- I saw that my feelings were pretty much universal. What's wrong with Scrappy-Doo? Scrappy rightly become the symbol of an annoyingly overexuberant or cute character added to a series in an attempt to maintain ratings, also known as the Cousin Oliver Syndrome (from the final season of the ""The Brady Bunch: The Complete Series with Shag Carpet Cover"").The film runs 86 minutes, which is perfect for cartooney fare like this, and was shot in Queensland, Australia.FINAL WORD: This live-action version of ""Scooby-Doo"" is defintely better on repeat viewings. If you loathed it on your initial viewing be sure to give it another chance. Aside from obvious positives like Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini nailing Shaggy and Velma, the film features cutie Isla Fisher in a significant role, plus the creative plot elements of the 'well of souls' and Scrappy-Doo.GRADE: C+ or B-",3,Better the second time around,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2808,"['Being', 'fan', 'original', 'cartoon', 'went', 'see', 'live-action', 'version', 'Scooby-Doo', 'theater', 'June', '2002', 'Was', 'long', 'ago', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'slowly', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'disappointed', 'seeing', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'must', 'say', 'better', 'repeat', 'most', 'impressed', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Shaggy', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'Velma', 'Freddy', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Fred', 'Daphne', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'roles', 'serviceable', 'made', 'up', 'addition', 'ultra-winsome', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'CGI', 'Scooby', 'was', 'good', 'time', '2002', 'not', 'effective', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'CGI', 'okay', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'miss', 'film', 'over.What', 'disappointed', 'initial', 'viewing', 'was', 'hoping', 'straight', 'live-action', 'adaption', 'cartoon', 'sorta', '1994', 'Flintstones', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'part', 'homage', 'part', 'parody', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'film', 'bogged', 'down', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'segment', 'comprised', '2nd', '3rd', 'acts', 'full', 'hour', 'film', 'What', 'wrong', 'large', 'chunk', 'film', 'whole', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'cartooney', 'live-action', 'homage', 'hard', 'explain', 'just', 'turned', 'off', 'hindsight', 'suppose', 'cartooniness', 'was', 'intended', 'film', 'based', 'cartoon', 'aduh', '.Viewing', 'second', 'time', 'had', 'same', 'impressions', 'film', 'up', '30-minute', 'mark', 'final', 'hour', 'won', 'over', 'How', 'so', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'limitations', 'Spooky', 'Island', 'set', 'was', 'impressed', 'whole', ""'well"", 'souls', 'aspect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'called', 'movie', 'complications', 'thereof', 'as', 'well', 'ingenious', 'way', 'included', 'Scrappy-Doo', 'plot', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'literally', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Scrappy-Doo', 'seeing', 'live-action', 'movie', 'saw', 'feelings', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'universal', 'What', 'wrong', 'Scrappy-Doo', 'Scrappy', 'rightly', 'become', 'symbol', 'annoyingly', 'overexuberant', 'cute', 'character', 'added', 'series', 'attempt', 'maintain', 'ratings', 'also', 'known', 'Cousin', 'Oliver', 'Syndrome', 'final', 'season', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Shag', 'Carpet', 'Cover', '.The', 'film', '86', 'minutes', 'perfect', 'cartooney', 'fare', 'was', 'shot', 'Queensland', 'Australia.FINAL', 'WORD', 'live-action', 'version', 'Scooby-Doo', 'defintely', 'better', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'loathed', 'initial', 'viewing', 'be', 'sure', 'give', 'chance', 'Aside', 'obvious', 'positives', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'nailing', 'Shaggy', 'Velma', 'film', 'cutie', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'significant', 'role', 'creative', 'plot', 'elements', ""'well"", 'souls', 'Scrappy-Doo.GRADE', 'C+', 'B-']",Scooby-Doo
