They don't fit with their fake looks and their acting. The CGI(animated) dog is bad, and humor is low. If I was in the movie, I'd never show my face in the public and never would go by the same name as in the credits. That was 1 hour and 22 minutes of a true waste of time. I doubt the money they earned from the previous movie was actually spend on the making of this movie. But the good part is that frog mutants at least looked O.K. and much better than the dog. I had no idea the movie would be so bad.

I was completely disappointed with the big budget version of Scooby Doo on the big screen, but was very happy with the Scooby Doo: They Mystery Begins made for TV reboot.  So I went into this with high expectations as I suspect other did, and this did not live up to those lofty goals.  The first was extremely well done (better as I said than the ones done with much bigger budgets), so this had big shoes to fill, and as is the case many times with sequels, it just couldn't live up to it.  That being said, it wasn't as awful as some would lead you to believe either.Despite a mediocre script and some cheesy things that I can only assume were done for budget constrains, the cast was again excellent and true in their portrayal of their characters.  The standard Scooby Doo humor and homage gags are there, though not in as much abundance as the first one.At $14.99 I think the price is a bit steep and wouldn't buy it unless you are certain you will watch it again, and even then I might consider waiting for the inevitable price drop that will happen... eventually.  In the mean time, for most, the rental will be enough to just see it once, be done with it, and to be caught up when (and if) they make a third installment.",4,"Not as good as original, but keeps you interested",1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,1295,"['am', 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'live', 'action', 'remakes', 'cartoons', 'was', 'completely', 'disappointed', 'big', 'budget', 'version', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Mystery', 'Begins', 'made', 'TV', 'reboot', 'went', 'high', 'expectations', 'suspect', 'other', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'lofty', 'goals', 'first', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'better', 'said', 'ones', 'done', 'much', 'bigger', 'budgets', 'so', 'had', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'as', 'case', 'many', 'times', 'sequels', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'being', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'awful', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'either.Despite', 'mediocre', 'script', 'cheesy', 'things', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'were', 'done', 'budget', 'constrains', 'cast', 'was', 'again', 'excellent', 'true', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'standard', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'humor', 'homage', 'gags', 'are', 'there', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'abundance', 'first', 'one.At', '14.99', 'think', 'price', 'bit', 'steep', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'are', 'certain', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'even', 'then', 'might', 'consider', 'waiting', 'inevitable', 'price', 'drop', 'will', 'happen', 'eventually', 'mean', 'time', 'most', 'rental', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'just', 'see', 'once', 'be', 'done', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'when', 'make', 'third', 'installment']",Scooby-Doo!

I had my doubts about Freddie and Shaggy not looking like the cartoon version but we loved the first movie they made.  The first one also bucked the Scooby Doo formula and had real ghosts but over all was great, we loved it.  This one is unfortunately a train wreck love story.  The main reason for this is they totally take out the mystery, it gets very little play time as they break the golden rule of Scooby Doo, there is not the subtle flirting there is dating between Freddie and Daphne; Shaggy is head over heals for Velma.  So you are left with Scooby Doo minus Scooby Doo and a mystery . . . you are left with a boring and annoying love story.  Really too bad as I love the cast.

There just hasn't been anything Scooby that I haven't liked.I was really hyped up for this movie, so much that we made it a point to get together at my house to watch the premier (say what you want but when you get to an age like me where you are trying to relive your childhood as much as possible before you REALLY get old, you appreciate these things lol)  As a whole I think this movie was good, it flows from the last movie and it ends with resolution while leaving an obvious opening for another movie (apparently the cast has a contract for 3 movies so fingers crossed).I knew it would only be a matter of time before romance became a major subject of these younger series and here it is.  Shaggy is crushing on Velma.  Thank you for finally getting this out there!  You can't run around 2 girls and 2 guys solving mysteries without at least being interested once in your colleagues and I have always thought it was funny that Shaggy and Velma didn't have something going on.  Well, this movie explains why they don't.  Good job filling in some cracks.  You also see a glimpse of Fred with the vintage look.  Funny and hopefully that is going to lead up to the classic look.Lake Monster is very childish.  Fun, but still harder to get into than any other Scooby movie.  Great for young kids but mature viewers like me, eh, maybe you should get into a 3rd grade mindset first.  Just a suggestion.  Someone commented in a review that the movie was boring.  While to me it did not seem near as boring as you made it out to be, I totally feel where you are coming from.  There is a lot of down time and yes, its easy to kind of drift off.The movie is not even out so I don't want to go into a lot of plot detail (and anyone that knows Scooby Doo shouldn't need a summary anyways) Monsters, mystery, chase.  I think this is something you will want to pick up for a little light childish humor.

Roark,"[5, 11]","The thing I remember most fondly about the original series as a child was that it was a perfect blend of creepy locations, spooky music, scary ghosts and comic relief provided by Scooby and Shaggy...and in the end, all the scary monsters turned out to be just some guy in a mask trying to cover up a criminal activity. Sure, it was a predictable formula, but it was done well enough. Plus, it was relatively harmless.This movie retains almost nothing from the 1968 series except for the characters and the scary monster, which is actually a monster. That's my biggest gripe with the story: instead of some harmless guy in a costume, they fill it with real monsters and a possession. Also, the cast spends more time trying to date each other than it spends on solving the mystery. Neither message is age appropriate for the type of kid that's going to be watching Scooby Doo.As a movie onto itself, it is typical of the poorly developed story, forgetable dialogue, and wooden acting that you see in most of the made-for-kids TV movies. My kids were either too young for the scary scenes and romance or too old for the gags. This pretty much killed any future interest I have in buying any new Scooby products for my kids.

Get this gang, the sixties are OVER man! And plus, get this; it's a talking cartoon dog! Get a grip. I like a lot of Scooby Doo and I thought this was right up there with the best of 'em. There have been dozens of interpretations of the Scooby Doo formula over the past 45 years and if I have to say that this is just a new vision of said formula then have it that way. But as I just said... it's a cartoon. It's a silly cartoon gone live action... I see one reviewer say that kids' made for TV movies ain't what they used to be. What are we comparing to? H.R. Puffnstuff and the Magic Flute? A Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen film?I thought that the first theatrical Scooby Doo was money well spent. The second theatrical release was just so so, as was the first TV joint with these kids. This follow up bit gave the new kids a chance to shine,,, with a plot that was actually somewhat engrossing for a Scooby Doo mystery. It has to do with a mysterious blue rock that holds the power of the moon, an old lake town, a witch from colonial times, and Velma getting possessed. It all rolls together into the story of the said title lake monster,,, and has some wild moments.For those who like the sixties style, especially when the crew used to bust into musical numbers, well that happens twice.
