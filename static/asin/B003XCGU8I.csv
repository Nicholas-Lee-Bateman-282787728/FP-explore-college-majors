The dancing scenes sre amazing, but I found the acting to be rather stiff and the relationships explored dull and unemotional. Being based on a true story the plot also suffers from the same malaise that all such actual accounts do, the ending is already known so the possibility of manufacturing any cinematic tension, or anticipation is difficult if not impossible.My favorite segments of the story where those based in China showing Li's early years of training and the brief glimpses of what life was like during the Mao regime.

1370358,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B003XCGU8I,David Bower,"[5, 5]",Realizing that movies will often take liberties with the facts I was curious how close this movie reflected what really happened. The name and story of Li Cunxin was already familiar to me as my daughter was a student there at the time Li came to Houston and actually married a young dancer who had been brought in from Great Britain the same way Li Cunxin had been brought in from China.Being part of that same group of young dancers gave my future son-in-law many opportunities to get to know Li so I was curious to ask him how faithful the movie was to the facts as he recalled them. He said first of all that he enjoyed the movie and found it followed the facts reasonably well. He also remarked how extremely poor Li's family in China had been as Li seemed to reflect on that part of his life to the other dancers to try and help them understand the vast differences he was experiencing in the USA.One point he mentioned had to do with the scene near the end of the movie where Li has the opportunity to dance while his parents are present. He said he was not present at that performance but has a good friend who had attended who told him Li's parents did not go on stage as shown. In addition he believed the performance was of a different ballet but Li was dancing the main male lead.Overall he was enthusiastic about the movie and I too found it of interest.

1370363,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003XCGU8I,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 3]","MAO'S LAST DANCER (2009) is yet more proof why I ADORE anything filmed Down Under - and makes me angry that we have to wait up to 2 years to see any of it. It is a fine family film that deserved a G rating (I don't know what it got).This is the biography of famous Australian, Chinese-born Li Cunxin (played by real-life ballet star Cu Cao, a/k/a Chi Cao), based on his autobiography of the same title. This great Australian danseur noble - now a stockbroker and proud father of three boys - hand-picked Cao to play him in the film. Cao, a spectacular actor in his film debut here, in real life is a stunningly beautiful danseur noble with the Birmingham Ballet (danseur noble is what the 'male ballerina' is called, for all you ignorant ones out there).With his dazzling beauty and huge, luminous eyes alone, Cao will assuredly win you over and cause you to shed a few tears - as I did. Cao's parents were both teachers of the real Li Cunxin during his student days at the Beijing Art Academy in the 1970s until around 1980.This brilliant though occasionally corny movie tells the truly dramatic story of Cunxin's life, from his boyhood in a China filthy with communist politprop to his now-celebrated 1986 performance in Houston. The film elegantly flashes back to Cunxin's childhood and teen years, and I am at a loss to comprehend how they found such beautiful boys to play him at ages 11 and 14.His defection to the U.S. in Houston caused an international incident, with some sort of hostage situation at the consulate in Houston - it is portrayed very well here. Though it was the Chinese defection story heard round the world, I admit, I do not recall any of this. I was busy watching Baryshnikov back then. This film, while rich in the deep poetry of ballet, is also rather dismissive of details.Nothing is ever fully explained at any point and we are left to sort of guess at the events. Why ballet director Ben Stevenson (a brilliant Bruce Greenwood sporting a perfect British accent) is in bed with the Chinese government; why the Chinese are even doing Western ballet at all during this time; all kinds of unanswered details.To me, because this is an Australian production, the film is too accepting of Maoism and the subsequent, slightly less radical communism in China. Certain scenes apparently showcase China's 'communist greatness' and that made me feel sick. Why people round the world keep doing this I know not. All I know is communism is an evil that ought to be blighted forever. A telling scene in the film takes place in 1989 when Cunxin visits home with his wife Mary; not very long after the Tiananmen Square massacre but you wouldn't know it from this film.A powerful cast blooms around the glowing, jade-like Cao: Kyle macLachlan as internationally famous immigration attorney Charles Foster; Jack Thompson in a speaking cameo as the judge who helps Cunxin defect; Joan Chen as Li Niang, Cunxin's mother; a terrible Camilla Vergotis as Mary, Cunxin's second and present wife; Su Zhang as Cunxin's classic ballet Teacher Chan; and the beautiful Guo Chengwu as a teen Cunxin.

In the late '80s, I traveled in China and saw the hints of change happening as Maoism gave way to more modern forms of communism--not that freedom of speech has ever been fully accepted to this day. I was curious to see how this film addressed that time period.""Mao's Last Dancer"" is based on the true story of Li, a male ballet dancer pulled from a small Chinese village to represent his country and government in the arts. He grows up in an institutional environment, basically raised by the state, just as many Chinese athletes still are to this day. Told in flashbacks, we see how he grew mentally and physically, and when at last he gets a chance to visit America for three months, we see his struggles to reconcile his anti-capitalist upbringing with the freedoms he finds in Houston, Texas. Li's eyes are opened to a world of opportunity and free speech. Even as his Chinese controllers hope to draw him back from the brink, he makes choices that will affect his future as a family man, dancer, and human being.The flashbacks are done skillfully, making the story easy to follow, and the dance choreography is incredible. Although the film seems long, it is bolstered by its true-to-life source material, and the depictions of Chinese thinking seemed spot-on. My only complaint was a highly manipulative scene, in which the director attempts to fool the audience into believing something that we later find out is not true.

1370366,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003XCGU8I,Grady Harp,"[35, 35]","MAO'S LAST DANCER is a gem of a film that proves that true stories of the travails of artists who must have freedom to express make excellent stories. And in this case the story is true. Adapted from the autobiography by the same name by Li Cunxin and adapted for the screen by Jan Sardi and directed by Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy, Bride of the Wind, Breaker Morant, Double Jeopardy, etc), this story gradually unfolds in both China and America and is in both Chinese and English.In the author's own words, 'In a small, desperately poor village in northeast China, a peasant boy sits at his rickety old school desk, interested more in the birds outside than in Chairman Mao's Red Book and the grand words it contains. But that day, some strangers come to his school - Madame Mao's cultural delegates. They are looking for young peasants to mold into faithful guards of Chairman Mao's great vision for China."" ""The boy watches as one of his classmates is chosen and led away. His teacher hesitates. Will she or won't she? She very nearly doesn't. But at the last moment, she taps the official on the shoulder and points to the small boy. ""What about that one?"" she says."" This is the true story of how that one moment in time, by the thinnest thread of chance, changed the course of a small boy's life in ways beyond description. One day he would dance with some of the greatest ballet companies of the world. One day he would be a friend to a president and first lady, movie stars, and some of the most influential people in America. One day he would himself become a star: Mao's last dancer and the darling of the West.'The film opens when Li Cunxin (Chi Cao, who joined Birmingham Royal Ballet in 1995 and was promoted to Principal in 2002.Trained at the Beijing Dance Academy and the Royal Ballet School.His parents were two of Cunxin Li's former teachers at the Beijing Dance Academy. Li wanted Cao to portray him) is only a peasant boy of 11 (played at that stage by Wen Bin Huang) and proceeds to show us the above described aspects of his life, as a teenager (played by Chengwu Guo) during his training in Beijing, and finally in his visit and eventual defection to America in 1979 - 81. Representing the American aspect of the story is the kind generosity of Houston Ballet choreographer Ben Stevenson (Bruce Greenwood) and dancers and members of the support teams for the ballet. Once in America Li discovers his true talent in classical ballet and wants to remain in America, but the Chinese consulate refuses to let him remain in America, even though Li has met and fallen in love and married. Li is torn - between his love for the family he might never see again (Joan Chen is remarkable as his mother), his love for his wife, and his need to remain where he can polish his gifts as a classical ballet dancer. The well publicized hostage situation in 1981 is included in the film as is the gradual transition of the Chinese growth after the death of Chairman Mao. The ending is a bit saccharine, but by the ending the audience is so enraptured with the story that it all works well.

Location scenes were well selected and nicely modified to resemble period village and dance studios.Negatives (admittedly a few are nuances):(1.) As someone who tutors exchange students from China I found personal fault with scenes that show the process by which a Chinese limited English speaker would handle English language acquisition as being totally incorrect. That the main actor was already fluent in English and the crew clueless did not help.(2.) The important cultural respect of presenting gifts such as tea or red good fortune knots were not shown and, alternatively, the behaviors such as handling the personal items of the host without permission were shown. The immense cultural history of China was ignored yet the skyscrapers of Houston were idolized.(3.) Weak examples of folk morality tales were presented e.g. of the countless frog-in-the-well variations the directors chose the one that is not storytelling strong.(4.) Although Mao's visage was commonplace I felt that the directors went overboard in using it to showcase the political differences between our two countries; usually associating it with cold heartless mean spirited Communist Party members. It is difficult to compare ideologies that in one case emphasize participation as an honor, not necessarily just for oneself, but for the community and another that promotes it as self-fulfilling personal gain.(5.) So much movie time was spent on the politics that the most important aspect of being an athlete which is the hard work of training was either not shown or shown briefly and often weakly. As a counterpoint, to show how difficult the training can be, both ""Dancing Across Borders"" and Maria Tallchief's life stories provide a more accurate insight into ""what it takes"".  Relatedly, the coaching sequences were the worst I have seen for any sport. If those techniques were used on real athletes they would have gotten no where except maybe out of their sport.(6.)

When he was eleven years old in China, living with his parents and six siblings, a delegation from a Beijing dance academy selected him to study ballet in Beijing far from his family. Mao was the dictator of China at the time and the people lived a cruel, impoverished, ever-fearful life. Li suffered in the academy because of homesickness and harsh treatment. But there was one compassionate teacher at the academy who gave Li advice that helped him become one of China's greatest dancers. Then, he was given the opportunity to dance with a ballet company in Houston, Texas, with the proviso that he must return to China in a month. Li was enchanted by the freedom in America and by the people he met, including a beautiful woman, a member of the ballet company but, unfortunately, not a very good dancer. The film tells what happens to Li when he tells the Chinese officials that he wants to stay in the US, how they kidnap him, what a Texas lawyer does, how he is told that he can never go back to China and never see his family again, how at an emotional moment at the end of a ballet....

However, I quickly became aware that this film was a narcissistic autobiography that was also serving as anti-Chinese, anti-communist propaganda. I am not Chinese and I am not pro-communist, let me get that out of the way now! However, when a movie highlights all of the flaws of one side, and only highlights all of the positives of the other side, that is a big giveaway that a book or movie is propaganda! Li Cunxin literally thinks the grass is greener on the other side. You can see how he preferred Western women over Chinese women and preferred American architecture, lifestyle and culture. He did come off as selfish in the movie. Let's be honest, he would still be a peasant in rural China if the Chinese government didn't train him as a ballet dancer. He wasn't grateful to them for helping him in his formative years. He abandoned his own country and his family after spending 3 months in America. I don't know, maybe he was brainwashed? Texas is a very Republican state. Perhaps he knew he was special and resented Communist China for not properly compensating him? I did further research while watching the movie and realized that Li eventually became a stockbroker. I know I might be generalizing, but that profession speaks volumes about what kind of personality and political views a person has. I know of another movie by a stockbroker who also portrayed himself as some wonder figure, the guy who wrote the book ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" I started to realize that the movie was all about what a great guy Li Cunxin was, and how he's better than everyone else and why China is such a bad place to live.I really wasn't expecting to be hit with the propaganda sledgehammer when I rented this movie. The message is also anachronistic, because China is very modern and capitalist now. There was also a lot of hypocrisy. He appears to criticize the Chinese government for making ballet dancers dance with guns and perform propaganda shows, but doesn't also realize that America is also obsessed with guns and war movies?

1370377,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B003XCGU8I,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[3, 4]","This is an amazing true story based on Li Cunxin's autobiography of the same name. As other reviewers have noted, Li Cunxin grew up poor in rural China as one of 7 sons. He was chosen as a young boy to move to Beijing to participate in a grueling full-time ballet training program. He grew up to become one of China's finest ballet dancers, and was invited to be a guest student with the Houston Ballet in the 70s by then director Ben Stevenson. He fell in love and married a young American dancer, and defected, causing an international incident.This movie documents all of this beautifully, as well as some subsequent events. The flashbacks to Li's childhood, both in rural China and his later training in Beijing, are very well-done, and are fascinating in their portrayals of China at this time. The dancing is fabulous, especially Li's 'breakout' scene, where he fills in for an injured dancer during an excerpt of Don Quixote. If you like ballet and/or history, you will love this movie.The only reason I just couldn't quite give it 5-stars was because some of the acting and writing was poor. The scenes between the Elizabeth McCay character (the young women Li initially marries) and Li were very cheesy, and when she leaves for San Francisco, it was not clear they were separating for good. Equally fuzzy was his new relationship with Australian dancer Mary McKendry, whom he eventually married and had (has) a family with in Australia. From what I have read, this actually occurred many years after the break up with Elizabeth McKay, but it was all a bit fuzzy and hard to follow in the film. I also found the final scene, in which Li and his wife visit China and dance for his village, including his once imprisoned early ballet teacher, over-the-top cheesy.These were small bumps overall though, in an otherwise excellent movie about a fascinating life.",4,"The Story and Dancing are Riveting, Some Minor Acting/Narrative Problems, But Overall Very Good",1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,1865,"['amazing', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'Li', 'Cunxin', 'autobiography', 'same', 'name', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Li', 'Cunxin', 'grew', 'up', 'poor', 'rural', 'China', 'one', '7', 'sons', 'was', 'chosen', 'young', 'boy', 'move', 'Beijing', 'participate', 'grueling', 'full-time', 'ballet', 'training', 'program', 'grew', 'up', 'become', 'one', 'China', 'finest', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'was', 'invited', 'be', 'guest', 'student', 'Houston', 'Ballet', '70s', 'then', 'director', 'Ben', 'Stevenson', 'fell', 'love', 'married', 'young', 'American', 'dancer', 'defected', 'causing', 'international', 'incident.This', 'movie', 'documents', 'beautifully', 'as', 'well', 'subsequent', 'events', 'flashbacks', 'Li', 'childhood', 'rural', 'China', 'later', 'training', 'Beijing', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'are', 'fascinating', 'portrayals', 'China', 'time', 'dancing', 'fabulous', 'especially', 'Li', ""'breakout"", 'scene', 'where', 'injured', 'dancer', 'excerpt', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'like', 'ballet', 'and/or', 'history', 'will', 'love', 'movie.The', 'only', 'reason', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'give', '5-stars', 'was', 'acting', 'writing', 'was', 'poor', 'scenes', 'Elizabeth', 'McCay', 'character', 'young', 'women', 'Li', 'initially', 'marries', 'Li', 'were', 'very', 'cheesy', 'when', 'San', 'Francisco', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'were', 'separating', 'good', 'Equally', 'fuzzy', 'was', 'new', 'relationship', 'Australian', 'dancer', 'Mary', 'McKendry', 'whom', 'eventually', 'married', 'had', 'family', 'Australia', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'actually', 'occurred', 'many', 'years', 'break', 'up', 'Elizabeth', 'McKay', 'was', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'hard', 'follow', 'film', 'also', 'found', 'final', 'scene', 'Li', 'wife', 'visit', 'China', 'dance', 'village', 'including', 'once', 'imprisoned', 'early', 'ballet', 'teacher', 'over-the-top', 'cheesy.These', 'were', 'small', 'bumps', 'overall', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'life']",N/A

The ballet master manages to inspire Li to learn the complicated ballet moves from his own story of an archer who lifted logs for one year to become strong enough to bend a bow.  He is allowed to come to America for a summer class with the Houston Ballet Company where he falls in love with an American dancer and defects through marriage but endeavors to persuade the Chinese authorities to allow him to stay in America and not take retribution upon his family still in China.  The Chinese attempt to kidnap him and return him to China but diplomacy intervenes and he is allowed to stay in Houston.  Of course the Chinese will not allow him to return home EVER to see his family which he reluctantly accepts.  I've always like Beresford's other films and this one is right up there with Breaker Morant and Driving Miss Daisy, etc.  The dancer, Chi Cao of the Birmingham Royal Ballet is the mature Li and has won the Gold Medal of the international competition in Varna, Bulgaria and his dancing is just thrilling.  The film is a well acted ""documentary"" based on Li's book about his life in China and in ballet.  Oddly, his parents were teachers of ballet and Chi Cao one of their students.  Li chose him to act his life in the movie which was certainly appropriate.  Joan Chen is wonderful as his mother - all the acting was very good and believable.  I felt the bargain price of Amazon's Prime offering a MUST HAVE THIS IN MY BALLET COLLECTION.  I've shown it to friends who are not ballet fans and they have all loved it!!  Many people who have not been exposed to great ballet dancing are often amazed at the required athletic ability.  Those who know of ballet appreciate Chi Cao's artistic accomplishments and enjoy the dance sequences very much.  The dance excerpts are quite short in nature but fit into the movie exactly right.  Kudos to the creative artists and crew involved in the making of this film.  A pure joy to watch - don't miss the significance of the final lift at the end of the film.  The culture clashes are well presented and the change in China's society quite remarkable in a short period of time.  The story is set in the 70's and 80's - China today is a much different place and all the better for it.  Ballet fan or not - this is a terrific film and so enjoyable for the entire family.

Always seen as mediocre but with promise, Li Cunxin pushed himself incessantly, until as an adult his talent finally earned him the chance to dance with his company outside of communist China ... specifically leading him to the USA.  Communism and a contempt for the decadence of American life leaves Li confused and anxious upon his arrival in Houston, but staying with the Houston Ballet's artistic director Ben Stevenson (Bruce Greenwood) and falling for a beautiful up-and-coming ballet American ballerina both contribute to Li's slowly evolving views on this new and freer life ... and when he finally begins debating the idea of possibly defecting, after becoming something of a celebrity dancing here in the 1980s, even viewers absolutely sure of where the film is going from there still have a couple surprises in store.The film is a bit long, but no less involving for Li Cunxin's journey and his evolution as a human being, dancer, and as a man.

Given only a two star recommendation from the critics, I was expecting a schlocky cornball bit of fluff. It was instead a joyful celebration of the human spirit that avoided going too far overboard. Sure, the ending was a deliberate tug at the heartstrings, but the rest of the movie was a touching motion picture about determination and difficult choices.Mixing in flashbacks of his discovery in a small village through his training in Beijing with his initial eye-opening voyage to the United States and his instruction in the differences between eastern and western ballet styles, the story gave the uninformed (like me) enough ballet insight to stoke my curiosity but never smothered me, thus allowing me to appreciate the physical and mental demands of this art form without getting bored. Bruce Greenwood, playing against his usual nasty type, does a fine job as the ballet director and Joan Chen provides poignancy and strength in her limited role as Cunxin's mother.Mao's Last Dancer was a lovely film about courage, hard work, sacrifice, and conscience. Despite some of the more rhetorical and argumentative reviews, it is not a movie about politics. Many have criticized the movie as pro-American propaganda, but I didn't see that. To deny that China went through a dramatic period of change over the years the story takes place is an understatement, but I saw nothing heavy-handed about either side.  The characters are the focus of Mao's Last Dancer.

1370412,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003XCGU8I,Tsuyoshi,"[18, 23]","Australian biopic ""Mao's Last Dancer"" is based on the autobiography of former Chinese-Australian ballet dancer Li Cunxin. Born in mainland China, Li Cunxin was sent from his impoverished village when he was 11 years old as a hopeful candidate for the Beijing Dance Academy. It was the time of Chairman Mao and ""Gang of Four."" He passes the test, and later joins the Huston ballet company as an exchange student. In America, now a young dancer hoping for the future, Li Cunxin has to make a decision that will change his life forever.""Mao's Last Dancer,"" directed by Bruce Beresford (""Driving Miss Daisy"" ""Tender Mercies""), shares the central theme with another coming-of-age tale ""Billy Elliot,"" but the Australian film is also about the protagonist's conflict between the two different cultures against the backdrop of the changing political climate in China. The script by Jan Sardi (""Shine"" ""The Notebook"") tries to show the young boy's emotional growth by using several episodes in the academy, but what really happened, I suspect, is something less melodramatic than is depicted here. Perhaps we should read the book.I am no expert, but the ballet dancing scenes are beautiful, strong and convincing (in spite of unnecessary use of occasional slow motions). Chi Cao, principal of the Birmingham Royal Ballet in real life, plays the adult Li Cunxin. He is obviously no professional actor, but he shows what he can do on the stage. Unfortunately, Li's romance (very important even in his life, as it turns) is not very interesting, even emotionally vapid, despite the best efforts from Chi Cao and Amanda Schull (Center Stage).Bruce Greenwood (""Star Trek"" ""Thirteen Days"") plays Ben Stevenson, artistic director of Houston Ballet. Kyle MacLachlan (""Desperate Housewives"") appears as Li's attorney Charles Forster, but his role (though second-billed) is more like an extended cameo. Joan Chen plays Li Cunxin's mother Niang; Wang Shuang Bao plays his father Dia. Also, the cast includes Jack Thompson in the blink-and-you-will-miss-it cameo.The film certainly has a good story to tell, which is nearly ruined by clich&eacute;d storytelling.
