451689,A24IFKQC1FWT1T,6305161615,"B. C. Farmer ""remraf""","[47, 53]","I was really taken by Kung Fu Hustle - I thought it was extremely unique and a whole lot of fun.  After watching it, I backtracked and watched Shaolin Soccer.  I enjoyed that movie as well, and then found myself on Amazon looking up other Stephen Chow movies.  I found this one, and looked it up at my local video rental stores.  No dice.  So I went ahead and purchased it through Amazon.  Now that I've watched it, I will say that I enjoyed it, but I didn't need to purchase it.  If you can find some other means to see it, by all means do so.  If the only way you can see it is by purchasing it, read on...This is not a bad movie by any means.  It's just not a movie that was made with a US audience in mind.  And there's no reason it should have been - it was not released stateside like Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle were.  Be that as it may, the English subtitles have been done by someone whose primary language is not English.  And hey, that's not a bad thing.  I'm sure that whoever did the subtitles did the best he or she could.  Being a person who has tried to speak and write a foreign language myself, I can understand the task the translator had to take on.  But the reality is this; for an American viewer who is counting on those subtitles to follow the story, a very literal and often times confusing translation is presented.  I found myself constantly having to think ""what does this actually mean?""  For instance, does ""fairy"" really mean fairy?  Or does it mean angel?  Or does it mean ghost?  Or (more likely) is there not a corresponding word in the English language that really conveys the true meaning conveyed in the movie's native language?  By the time all of those thoughts run through one's head, a couple of other subtitles have already come and gone that you have not devoted that kind of thought to.  In short, it can be a little hard to follow.I also second the comments from some earlier reviews; the humor here is not as universal as it was in Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.  It seems to be very specific to the Chinese culture.  Again, I understand that there is no reason it should be anything but what it is.  I'm just trying to give ""average Kung Fu Hustle fan"" a heads up here.What I found most fascinating about the movie (i.e. - the reason I did enjoy it at all) is the fact that this was a movie that I assume isn't the least bit self conscious of its culture - it just is what it is.  Given that, it's arguable that something like this can be a more interesting look into Chinese culture than some National Geographic article or TV special like ""CHINESE CULTURE:  What it means to you!""So in the end, if you're looking for another Shaolin Soccer or Kung Fu Hustle (and English is your native tongue), I would say that this movie IS NOT what you're looking for.  But if you do watch it and are interested in peeking in at other cultures, you might come away with something else...",3,If you find yourself here because you loved Kung Fu Hustle...,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,2932,"['was', 'really', 'taken', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'thought', 'was', 'extremely', 'unique', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'backtracked', 'watched', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'found', 'Amazon', 'looking', 'up', 'other', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'movies', 'found', 'one', 'looked', 'up', 'local', 'video', 'rental', 'stores', 'dice', 'went', 'ahead', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'will', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'purchase', 'can', 'find', 'other', 'means', 'see', 'means', 'do', 'so', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'purchasing', 'read', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'just', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'US', 'audience', 'mind', 'reason', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'stateside', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'were', 'Be', 'may', 'English', 'subtitles', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'someone', 'primary', 'language', 'not', 'English', 'hey', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', 'subtitles', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'Being', 'person', 'who', 'tried', 'speak', 'write', 'foreign', 'language', 'can', 'understand', 'task', 'translator', 'had', 'take', 'reality', 'American', 'viewer', 'who', 'counting', 'subtitles', 'follow', 'story', 'very', 'literal', 'often', 'times', 'confusing', 'translation', 'presented', 'found', 'constantly', 'having', 'think', 'what', 'actually', 'mean', 'instance', 'fairy', 'really', 'mean', 'fairy', 'mean', 'angel', 'mean', 'ghost', 'more', 'likely', 'there', 'not', 'corresponding', 'word', 'English', 'language', 'really', 'true', 'meaning', 'conveyed', 'movie', 'native', 'language', 'time', 'thoughts', 'run', 'one', 'head', 'couple', 'other', 'subtitles', 'have', 'already', 'come', 'gone', 'have', 'not', 'devoted', 'kind', 'thought', 'short', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'follow.I', 'also', 'second', 'comments', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'humor', 'here', 'not', 'as', 'universal', 'was', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'be', 'very', 'specific', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'Again', 'understand', 'reason', 'should', 'be', 'anything', 'what', ""'m"", 'just', 'trying', 'give', 'average', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'fan', 'up', 'here.What', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'i.e', 'reason', 'did', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'was', 'movie', 'assume', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'self', 'conscious', 'culture', 'just', 'what', 'Given', 'arguable', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'look', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'National', 'Geographic', 'article', 'TV', 'special', 'CHINESE', 'CULTURE', 'What', 'So', 'end', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'English', 'native', 'tongue', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'NOT', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'do', 'watch', 'are', 'interested', 'peeking', 'other', 'cultures', 'might', 'come', 'away', 'something', 'else']",God of Cookery

Think of an Iron Chef episode and mix that with Shaolin Socccer style fighting (another golden Chow Gem) and you have Cookery.  it is a Rags to riches type story as many Chow films are, but it isnt the typical one.  A tongue in cheek movie with good dialogue and an amusing love interest this film is good even on sequential viewings.

451691,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,6305161615,Carl Malmstrom,"[3, 13]","Perhaps I've seen to much Jackie Chan to be able to properly appreciate this movie, but I found myself sitting on my couch at the end of the movie wondering what had just happened.  &quot;God of Cookery&quot; is certainly a movie that tries hard to please its audience, but somewhere along the line (I think maybe at about an hour into the movie) it simply abandons its plot and moves into the realm of the incredibly bizarre.  It certainly means well, but it has no idea what to do with itself.&quot;God of Cookery&quot; is apparently a parody of sorts of the Chow-Yun Fat classic &quot;God of Gamblers&quot;.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen &quot;God of Gamblers&quot;, so I can't give you a comparison as to how effective the parody is.  However, in its own right, I don't know how well it stands.Certain parts of the movie have a definite zany flair that make you like them in spite of what you think of the movie.  The whole &quot;West Side Story&quot; sequence involving two local gangs fighting over control of one restaurant's recipes is a very cute sequence that had me smiling for days afterward.  Even parts in the monastery sequences where Stephen Chow's character is learning cooking skills are funny enough to stand on their own merit.  However, other parts - especially the final battle/cooking sequence - simply go too far around the bend for me to be able to appreciate them - or even laugh.None of this is helped in the movie by the progressively deteriorating English grammar in the subtitles, either.  I try not to be picky about typos or small problems in grammar - after all, Cantonese to English is by all accounts a really tough translation - but there were entire scenes that I could not understand due to the grammatical confusion.  By the end of the movie, practically every sentence was confusing.All in all, I find myself not hating this movie.  When movies try as hard as this one did to get you to like it, it's hard to hate them.  However, I was disappointed by it.  I really wanted to like it a lot more than I did.  Perhaps I just don't have the hang of proper Hong Kong comedy, but I found myself feeling puzzled when others were laughing hysterically.  So, in retrospect, I would say that if you've heard good things about &quot;God of Cookery&quot; and are looking for a mindless Hong Kong action comedy then go for it.

451692,A8Z7ZGJW3HEKF,6305161615,Celeste Chang,"[1, 1]","After this, I think Stephen Chow tried to broaden the appeal of his movies to Western audiences (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), but IMHO, lost some of the quirky charm in the translation. I've been a Stephen Chow fan for years, ever since my aunt foisted an unlabeled VHS tape on me containing ""Hail the Judge"". I eventually tracked down most of his movies (on cheap VCDs) through the magic of the Internet. They are a bit formulaic, with him playing an initially heartless S.O.B. who gets into trouble and has to crawl his way back to the top while learning some humanity, but ""God of Cookery"" absolutely nails it, and I was laughing hysterically most of the way through. Of course it's funnier in Chinese, and if you're familiar with all the genres being spoofed (Iron Chef, wuxia (superhero swordsmen) serials, gangster movies, supernatural comedy/drama, etc.)Great performances all around. Stephen Chow's arrogant chef manages to be corrupt and greedy without being completely repulsive, so his eventual turnaround is believable. Karen Mok is just as good as playing a disfigured woman who runs a streetside noodle stand and a small gang, who help him when he hits bottom. Everyone is insane, down to the woman who judges the final cook-off at the climax of the movie. The discussion of the merits of the ""folding chair"" as a martial arts weapon!
