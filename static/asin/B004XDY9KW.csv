The color is vibrant, the film work excellent, lots of interesting facts, attractive images and liked the low-key narration.  The scenery starred instead of the narrator.  Like focus on the sights, not the personality of the tour guide.  Really enjoyed this and will watch it again.  This is free with Prime membership which makes Prime a valuable investment.",5,Great Color and Scenes of France,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,488,"['Watched', 'couple', 'other', 'travel', 'videos', 'France', 'color', 'was', 'off', 'scenery', 'not', 'pretty', 'was', 'delight', 'contrast', 'color', 'vibrant', 'film', 'work', 'excellent', 'lots', 'interesting', 'facts', 'attractive', 'images', 'liked', 'low-key', 'narration', 'scenery', 'starred', 'instead', 'narrator', 'focus', 'sights', 'not', 'personality', 'tour', 'guide', 'Really', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'free', 'Prime', 'membership', 'Prime', 'valuable', 'investment']",Burt Wolf: France
