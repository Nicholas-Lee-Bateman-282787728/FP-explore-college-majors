186311,A2U82IFJLPZXJT,1572522100,Andrew Charig,"[3, 3]","First, a caveat:  this film is in French with Korean subtitles; however, if you click on ""subtitles"" to start, you can get it with English subtitles which are quite adequate.It is a fine filming of an essentially-true story from mid-sixteenth-century (ca 1540 - 1560) France.  The only downside I noticed was some slips into flashforwards and flashbacks that left me momentarily confused. Good qualities more then compensated:* the sets and costuming are excellent;  historical advisor Natalie Zemon Davis must have advised the designers to consult contemporary painters - the Elder Brueghel is obvious  -  and it contributes much to the authentic feel of the tale* the performances are thoroughly worked out to be convincing.  So much has been posted on-line about this story of imposture, that I won't be giving the ending away by saying that both Martins were played with fine discrimination: the imposter (Gerard Depardieu, who received a French Academy Award for the role) and the real Guerre were sufficiently alike in appearance to be accepted by the audience, and sufficiently different in personality to make the ending credible, which is careful acting.  Kudos also to whoever played the judge: he portrayed all the qualities of a man conscious of his responsibilities, without ever looking judgemental (which he was not suppposed to be). English-speakers are not used to seeing the roles of judge and detective combined (not quite Rumpole of the Bailey, shall we say?), but in 16th-century France they were, and that actor did it very nicely.Five stars.",5,Well-researched at every level.,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,1564,"['First', 'caveat', 'film', 'French', 'Korean', 'subtitles', 'however', 'click', 'subtitles', 'start', 'can', 'get', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'quite', 'adequate.It', 'fine', 'filming', 'essentially-true', 'story', 'mid-sixteenth-century', 'ca', '1540', '1560', 'France', 'only', 'downside', 'noticed', 'was', 'slips', 'flashforwards', 'flashbacks', 'left', 'momentarily', 'confused', 'Good', 'qualities', 'more', 'then', 'compensated', '*', 'sets', 'costuming', 'are', 'excellent', 'historical', 'advisor', 'Natalie', 'Zemon', 'Davis', 'must', 'have', 'advised', 'designers', 'consult', 'contemporary', 'painters', 'Elder', 'Brueghel', 'obvious', 'much', 'authentic', 'feel', 'tale*', 'performances', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'worked', 'out', 'be', 'convincing', 'So', 'much', 'been', 'posted', 'on-line', 'story', 'imposture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'giving', 'ending', 'away', 'saying', 'Martins', 'were', 'played', 'fine', 'discrimination', 'imposter', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'who', 'received', 'French', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'real', 'Guerre', 'were', 'sufficiently', 'alike', 'appearance', 'be', 'accepted', 'audience', 'sufficiently', 'different', 'personality', 'make', 'ending', 'credible', 'careful', 'acting', 'Kudos', 'also', 'whoever', 'judge', 'portrayed', 'qualities', 'man', 'conscious', 'responsibilities', 'ever', 'looking', 'judgemental', 'was', 'not', 'suppposed', 'be', 'English-speakers', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'roles', 'judge', 'detective', 'combined', 'not', 'quite', 'Rumpole', 'Bailey', 'shall', 'say', '16th-century', 'France', 'were', 'actor', 'did', 'very', 'nicely.Five', 'stars']",N/A

186313,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,1572522100,Bomojaz,"[6, 7]","This excellent movie is a suspenseful mystery involving possible mistaken identity, with a strong Hitchcockian feeling to it, set in a mid-1500s peasant village in France. Martin Guerre (Gerard Depardieu) marries Bertrande (Nathalie Baye) but soon after disappears. Eight years later he returns - but is it really him?Some in the village grow to doubt the real Martin has actually returned - he can't remember people and suffers other lapses of memory - though Nathalie remains faithful. These villagers bring Martin to trial, where he defends himself admirably. It looks like he's being framed, while Nathalie continues to support his claim without question.In court, just as he's about to be declared innocent, another Martin appears (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), claiming to be the real Martin. Can he be believed? Without spoiling the ending for anyone, I will just say that there are quite a few surprises from this point on in the movie, and that the real Martin is disclosed. In fact, near the end we come to realize that certain identifying clues have been fed to us all along.It's an intriguing story extremely well handled. A great deal of attention went into the setting, which is perfectly done and most authentic. Based on a true story. The 1993 remake SOMMERSBY, with Richard Gere and Jodie Foster, which changes the setting to rural Tennessee and alters the ending somewhat, can't hold a candle to this original.

Over time -- and throughout numerous viewings of my own copy of the film purchased several years ago -- my reverence for this film has only increased.  Yes, it introduced me to the prodigious talents of Mr. Depardieu.  Yes, it has an intriguing plot with a passionate and surprising, yet, somehow inevitable conclusion.  However, the most memorable aspect of the film for me has always been how all of the film's elements combine to make the viewer completely experience medieval France.  As you watch the characters in their homes, speaking with one another, you swear you can SMELL their unwashed, earthy-smelling bodies.  When you see people trudging through the rutted streets, you can FEEL the sucking of the mud as it tries to keep the boots of the pedestrians in its grasp.  Never have I been more involved in a film on so many levels simultaneously.  I have recommended this film too many times to count, and I have loaned my copy out only to trusted friends.

I know it's based on an actual event but were this a novel it'd be one of those of which I'd say it would've made a far better short story.The question of whether the man who returns home from war in the 16th century is actually the same long-lost Martin who left his family years before, or an imposter, is intriguing for those who may not be in the know, but the time in between the introduction of the mystery and the conclusion doesn't feature much in the way of goings on. I think this could have been a much better movie had there been a greater effort to show rural village life during this period, or even had it aimed to become a love story. As it was it relied too heavily on its own central question (is it Martin or not?) to carry its whole running time, and there simply was not enough material to achieve that. It's also the kind of movie that doesn't offer much on a repeat viewing. (I got the DVD for someone as a gift, and watched it with him.) Gerard Depardieu was unusually sedate in the title role, and those who might not know about it should be aware that there is the typical quota of nudity you might expect in a European release.One final note, this is the film that back in the `90's inspired an American remake called Sommersby, that starred Jodie Foster, James Earl Jones, and Richard Gere, although in that case the events were advanced in time to the post-American Civil War, and wholly invented, not based on historical fact.",3,"No Spoilers, Just A Review",1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,1643,"['saw', 'film', 'VHS', 'back', 'college', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'release', 'DVD', 'lot', 'terms', 'enhancing', 'experience', 'seeing', 'again', 'interesting', 'story', 'up', 'point', 'know', 'based', 'actual', 'event', 'were', 'novel', ""'d"", 'be', 'one', ""'d"", 'say', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'far', 'better', 'short', 'story.The', 'question', 'man', 'who', 'home', 'war', '16th', 'century', 'actually', 'same', 'long-lost', 'Martin', 'who', 'left', 'family', 'years', 'imposter', 'intriguing', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'know', 'time', 'introduction', 'mystery', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'feature', 'much', 'way', 'goings', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'greater', 'effort', 'show', 'rural', 'village', 'life', 'period', 'even', 'had', 'aimed', 'become', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'relied', 'too', 'heavily', 'own', 'central', 'question', 'Martin', 'not', 'carry', 'whole', 'running', 'time', 'there', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'material', 'achieve', 'also', 'kind', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'got', 'DVD', 'someone', 'gift', 'watched', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'was', 'unusually', 'sedate', 'title', 'role', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'typical', 'quota', 'nudity', 'might', 'expect', 'European', 'release.One', 'final', 'note', 'film', 'back', '90', 'inspired', 'American', 'remake', 'called', 'Sommersby', 'starred', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'case', 'events', 'were', 'advanced', 'time', 'post-American', 'Civil', 'War', 'wholly', 'invented', 'not', 'based', 'historical', 'fact']",N/A

The story line has been redone by Jody Foster and cast in  post-Civil War Virginia, but this film is head and shoulders above the  remake. If you can't understand French, read the subtitles and watch it  more than once.The setting is a small village in France during the late  Middle Ages. The tale centers on a soldier, Martin Guerre played by Gerard  Depardieu (in his younger slimmer body), who returns home after years of  absence.  He renews his relationship with the wife he deserted (or rather  begins again since his former relationship left much to be desired). His  years away have made him a better person than the callow youth he was when  left the village seeking adventure.  He has become a loving husband and a  hard worker, and discordance seems a thing of the past.After much hard  work, one day, he asks his family to relinquish a parcel of land he says  rightfully belongs to him. This request disturbs the family who had assumed  he was gone for good and would never assume ownership of the land. Their  greed leads them to begin a court proceeding against him charging him as an  imposter who has no right to the land.I found the legal angles of the  story quite intriging. It was illuminating to discover there were laws and  jurisprudence as well as thoughtful judges during this period. The  &quot;humanist&quot; movement had begun, so there were newer provisions for  protecting individuals from the group.

No doubt the wife knows he's not the same man who left years before (and this makes the story idiotic from the outset) although she pretends she doesn't (how could she not know?).  And (big surprise!) the townsfolk are suspicious.  Afterall, how many people look like Depardieu?  Well, the movie carries this ruse out for all of two, fairly boring subtitled hours of annoying French-speak and gushy google-eyed lovelooks from the movie's ""hero"" and ""heroine"" as the viewer is treated like the fool he (or she) is for watching this drivel.

186324,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,1572522100,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 3]","What can history teach us exactly? For starters, it can tell us where humanity, either as separate individuals or as a collective society, has been in the past centuries on this planet, what we are accomplishing now, how we were able to come to this point, and where we might be heading in the near future and how we could avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Though using films set against historical time periods, whether it be our own as Americans or somewhere else in the world, is not exactly a new trend in the college world, more are becoming increasingly aware of the advantages it offers to students in their ability to learn and grasp the subject matter of particular time periods. And even though some of these films discuss events that may not be considered earth-shattering in terms of scope and consequential effects, such as The Return of Martin Guerre, but they still benefits its audience by viewing the lives of the people of that particular period in our past and allowing them in their minds to draw comparisons and contrasts to issues in contemporary Europe and America.The story for The Return of Martin Guerre remains comparatively true to the source on which the script was based on but it does rely on creative liberties, especially near the end of the film, to keep the romantic theme represented throughout the feature afloat. The most cringing moment in the film, at least for sticklers for historical accuracy, comes when Bertrande reveals to the judge at the end of the film what she had done and why she did it. The real Bertrande, on the other hand, had never made such a confession and there was no evidence in the story to suggest that she ever knew he was not her husband, though there is certainly nothing that would rule it out of the realm of possibility either. Though the answers provided by the film could potentially be the adequate reasons as to why Bertrande did what she did, it does a far greater disservice to the audience then if they had merely concluded the film with the execution of Arnaud. Actually, this action is rather insulting to the intelligence of the audience, insisting that they can not ponder for themselves the possibilities as to why Bertrande would have supported a man who was obviously not her husband and live in perpetual sin and that they need everything placed in front of them on a silver plate.Bertrande de Rols, performed admirably by the positively radiant Nathalie Baye who truly appears as though she is expanding her beautiful radiance with each scene she is in, is portrayed in the film as a compassionately brave and enduring young woman struggling in a society that offers few options with which to shape her life, offering a relevantly-balanced match to Depardieu's Arnaud de Tihl. G&eacute;rard Depardieu is remarkably enjoyable in the role of Arnaud de Tihl, a veteran French soldier who convinces an entire village that he is a man who ran off to war years earlier, even his own wife. Arnaud is a tremendous character fit for only the most skilled of performers, in part to his phenomenal memory and quick-wittedness, something that helps out excessively in court. Without doubt, Depardieu fits the bill perfectly. Not much can be said of Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, who takes on the role of the real Martin Guerre, as he only seen all too briefly early on in the film and then at the very end when he ""miraculously"" appears at the last minute before the judgment of the case is revealed. But, from what can be seen of him in the film, Donnadieu does an exceptional job presenting a character so emotionally distant from everyone that it is hard to root for him, although you do not get the feeling as though you should totally despise him.Praise is to be given to the filmmakers for remaining so faithful to the 16th Century time period of the true story and not willing to stray, at least not too often, into attempts at modernization in order to better accommodate the mainstream movie-going public, or those with the money in their pockets. Accuracy ranges from the pristine presentation of the Parlement Court down to both the inside and outside appearances of the villages and towns, the props appropriately used by the characters on screen as if they were truly performing their daily tasks, the costumes they wore, and even the some of the locations in which sequences were set against. Furthermore, the film conscientiously represents the severely limited options of women within the defined time period as opposed to men who merely had to own land in order to wield their power and influence. And though the exploration into the events surrounding the life of Bertrande following the disappearance of her husband, specifically her struggle as a single dishonored mother living in a male-dominated society, is not given as much focus as would be desired, the feeling of remorse and sympathy for the young woman is still felt within the minds of its audience. But this does not mean to say that The Return of Martin Guerre is absolutely perfect in its representation or that is fails to adhere to the temptations of creative liberties.With what has become quite a standard trend within the realm of the Hollywood film productions, with the inclusion of the foreign releases as well, the characters of the film are seen with a different costume within each new scene they appear in, giving the appearance as though the director is keeping in line with his modern audiences' practices, but, in the historical time period in which it is set, this would have been extremely uncommon even by the standards of the nobility. And whether this was ever the intention of director Daniel Vigne or not, the film's style and presentation often reflects to its audience a medieval-like atmosphere which is not accurate to the time in which the plot was set against. Unless audience members beforehand had previous acknowledgement of what era the romance happened to be set against, the ""Middle Ages"" would be the obvious conclusion that would be made, thus damaging their historical assessment of the issues involved, though certainly not completely.Staying in line with our honest assessment of the evening's presentation, it can be said that the experience would have been significantly more engrossing, and therefore increasing the level of intrigue, for all involved had it been decided not to include the use of English subtitles into this version of the classic French film. True, foreign languages are quite a bewildering and complex beast to master no matter who you talk to, but is that not the purpose of attending a university? Should we not be challenging the mind and engage in novel, if not bizarre, experiences for us even if we are to only find failure in our attempts? Students should not be deprived of being entirely enveloped in the true aspirations of the director and its source material. Had they even been unable to decipher a majority of the film's dialogue, they at least would have walked away immersed in a truly sincere experience and could therefore research the time period and story itself on their own time.Overall, The Return of Martin Guerre successfully bucks the trend of foreign releases being unable to maintain the same level of intensity and enthusiasm crossing the ocean that they had back in Europe and does so with an eloquent flare and style, though subtitles would have been better left out of the final print. And though it certainly lacks what one would consider Sixth Sense-like twists that would have certainly given it a far more exhilarating quality about itself, its enduring sense of romanticism and nostalgic appeal of the country in Europe make it worthy enough of attention. Furthermore, there is hope that the effect of this film on its budding audience members will be enlightened by the roughly two hour experience and will be so inspired that they will become more immersed in the subject matter, and this could very well be that film, though, sadly, it may not be mainstream enough to have any lasting effects.",4,The Moose Hole - 'The Return' of True

A moving story brought to life by the great acting of Gerard Depardieu and a strong supporting cast.The film involves the life of a well-to-do farmer in 16th century France (not the Middle Ages and the Hundred Years War as erroneously claimed by the main reviewer!)  Bored with farming and searching for adventure, Martin Guerre, a man who cares little for women or husbandry, goes off to war and leaves behind his beautiful wife (Nathalie Baye.) Years have past and the wife lives a solitary life of chastity while she awaits the return of her husband.  An impostor (Gerard Depardieu) comes back as Martin Guerre to embrace his wife but suspicions abound.  How long will this clever plot work?  Will the wife find out?  What happens to the real Martin Guerre?The reviewers who claim this story to be fiction or exaggerated are clearly unfamiliar with French history as this story is completely true: all of the minute details of this tragic story were preserved in a 16th century court manuscript that recorded all of the testimonies and the verdict of the court.  This touching film follows the lives of real historical characters who, although simple late Rennaissance peasants, risked the scorn of their peers and the infliction of serious criminal penalties for true love: it's a moving tragedy to watch.

186329,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,1572522100,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 3]","The first time I saw this film, I needed a break from graduate school exams (in France).  I did not particularly like Depardieu and knew nothing of the story.  But once I was inside, I was amazed and left thinking it was one of the best films I had ever seen, a serious fan of Depardieu ever since.  It is an extraordinarily vivid historical reconstruction of a true story, illuminating a tumultuous period of history with exceptional accuracy.  You feel the texture of the life, with innumerable subtle allusions that deep reading in history can uncover - about the rights of women, law, the role of religion in everyday life, about identity and possibility - and the best of all:  a completely absorbing story that keeps the viewer guessing the whole time.The two principal characters, played by Depardieu and the astonishingly beautiful yet apparently plain Natalie Baye, are compelling in their love, having re-found each other.  Martin Guerre, unhappy and unloving, had walked away from everything that he had:  some land, a large extended family, and the obligations of his station.  He returns after nearly a decade of war as a soldier in Spain, to welcome and forgiveness, fitting into the life of the village in his proper role.  Martin and Bertrand have children, continue to work, and everything seems fine.  Then some vagabonds arrive, who inadvertantly claim that Martin is not who he claims to be.  This sows doubt in the village and gets tangled in some local politics and greed, leading to a law suit and threats of violence.The story is framed by the investigation of a good, aristocratic magistrate who seeks to find the truth behind the allegations.  Is it true?  Or do the accusers have ulterior motives involving greed and corruption.  It is utterly riveting and a mystery until the end.  The personalities are well drawn and evolve throughout the course of the story - the viewer's perception of the all changes more than once.  I just watched it with my children, who normally prefer computer games, and they watched in fascinated silence, except when they asked questions (the best reward of all!).Warmly recommended.

186330,A7DCWCD9S7RKL,1572522100,"S. Goodwin ""groovie reader""","[10, 12]","This has got to be one of my favorite Gerard Depardieu films of all time. It is a wonderful story about a man who disappears shortly after his marriage.  Several years later, the man known as Martin Guerre returns, apparently from a war, but he is much changed.  He is more educated and much nicer to his wife than he was when he was first married.  Since he looks a bit different, many were wary about who he really was, but then he earned everyone's trust and the love of his wife.  This film is beautifully acted and a wonderful romance. Don't even bother with the lame remake &quot;Sommersby&quot;, it cannot hold a candle to the original.",5,Gerard Depardieu Rules!,974246400,"11 15, 2000",2000,643,"['got', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'films', 'time', 'wonderful', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'shortly', 'marriage', 'Several', 'years', 'later', 'man', 'known', 'Martin', 'Guerre', 'returns', 'apparently', 'war', 'much', 'changed', 'more', 'educated', 'much', 'nicer', 'wife', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'married', 'bit', 'different', 'many', 'were', 'wary', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'then', 'earned', 'everyone', 'trust', 'love', 'wife', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'wonderful', 'romance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'lame', 'remake', 'quot', 'Sommersby', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'original']",N/A
