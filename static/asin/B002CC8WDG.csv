Not only does she bring a youthful and truly innocent feel to the character but her acting really does bring a joyful tear to my eye.This movie is the story of a young confused girl trying to figure out what love is. In her pursuit for the answers she seeks she is faced with her choice between a lusty and reluctant father of a teacher and a lost, uninspired student.Every scene in this movie is dripping with mystery, who is Tsumugi? What is going on in her mind? These questions and more popped into my head while watching this film.I found that anyone can really relate to Tsumugi as no one really knows what love is.Additionally, I found the sound design and the music to be complete genius, each sequence was perfectly matched with a strange and almost ominous feel that truly mirrors the theme of the movie.I highly recommend, not only for the wonderful love scenes but also for the story that will leave you rethinking your views on love and life.",5,The lost girl,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,1019,"['Sora', 'Aoi', 'HOT', 'performance', 'Tsumugi', 'truly', 'amazing', 'Not', 'only', 'bring', 'youthful', 'truly', 'innocent', 'feel', 'character', 'acting', 'really', 'bring', 'joyful', 'tear', 'eye.This', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'confused', 'girl', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'love', 'pursuit', 'answers', 'faced', 'choice', 'lusty', 'reluctant', 'father', 'teacher', 'lost', 'uninspired', 'student.Every', 'scene', 'movie', 'dripping', 'mystery', 'who', 'Tsumugi', 'What', 'going', 'mind', 'questions', 'more', 'popped', 'head', 'watching', 'film.I', 'found', 'anyone', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'Tsumugi', 'one', 'really', 'what', 'love', 'is.Additionally', 'found', 'sound', 'design', 'music', 'be', 'complete', 'genius', 'sequence', 'was', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'strange', 'almost', 'ominous', 'feel', 'mirrors', 'theme', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'only', 'wonderful', 'love', 'scenes', 'also', 'story', 'will', 'leave', 'rethinking', 'views', 'love', 'life']",Tsumugi

1262583,A2LFWRKGPW5PU0,B002CC8WDG,"Ramm ""DVD-OCD""","[34, 36]","Pinku genre actress Sora Aoi has the quality that the Japanese refer to as 'kawaii' (CUTE) that is manifested in a kind of fresh, youthful, naive innocence of appearance and demeanor. The Japanese schoolgirl typically epitomizes these aspects and that is the titular role that Sora plays to good effect in the PinkEiga film ""TSUMUGI"".  Her character is a strange mix of Lolita-esque teen temptress and troubled young woman trying to come to grips with growing up and she bounces back and forth between seducing one of her (much) older school teachers and a nerdy male class mate. The 'action' in the movie is mostly provided by the Pinku 'obligatory' sex scenes and the moralistic quandry that the school teacher finds himself in as he see-saws back and forth between his guilty liaisons with the underage Tsumugi and a more proper (but less exciting) affair with another female school teacher who is trying to snare him.  There are several lite weight bondage scenes, as Tsumugi enjoys being 'taken' on occasion while tied up, and an interesting sub-plot that involves a friend of the school teacher who is an aged Japanese punk rocker. In the final analysis the film doesn't really go anywhere exceptional as it wends its' way to a somewhat nihilistic conclusion - and may ultimately be considered as chiefly a vehicle to display Sora's considerable physical attributes - she IS built! -and in one brief scene appears totally nude (pubic hair & all!) a real rarity in Japanese soft core sex flix.  Having seen Sora Aoi in a few movies I would say that 'Tsumugi' really suits her persona better than some of the other (more 'action' oriented) films she has been cast in.  Her other stand-out role, for me, was in the film ""Man, Woman, and the Wall"" - worth checking out.  As with most Pinku offerings the film clocks in at a relatively short  62 min. play time,.. in Jap. w/ English subs.",4,Sora Soars!,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,1889,"['Pinku', 'genre', 'actress', 'Sora', 'Aoi', 'quality', 'Japanese', 'refer', ""'kawaii"", 'CUTE', 'manifested', 'kind', 'fresh', 'youthful', 'naive', 'innocence', 'appearance', 'demeanor', 'Japanese', 'schoolgirl', 'typically', 'aspects', 'titular', 'role', 'Sora', 'good', 'effect', 'PinkEiga', 'film', 'TSUMUGI', 'character', 'strange', 'mix', 'Lolita-esque', 'teen', 'temptress', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'growing', 'up', 'back', 'forth', 'seducing', 'one', 'much', 'older', 'school', 'teachers', 'nerdy', 'male', 'class', 'mate', ""'action"", 'movie', 'mostly', 'provided', 'Pinku', ""'obligatory"", 'sex', 'scenes', 'moralistic', 'quandry', 'school', 'teacher', 'back', 'forth', 'guilty', 'liaisons', 'underage', 'Tsumugi', 'more', 'proper', 'less', 'exciting', 'affair', 'female', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'trying', 'snare', 'are', 'several', 'lite', 'weight', 'bondage', 'scenes', 'Tsumugi', 'being', ""'taken"", 'occasion', 'tied', 'up', 'interesting', 'sub-plot', 'friend', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'aged', 'Japanese', 'punk', 'rocker', 'final', 'analysis', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'exceptional', 'way', 'somewhat', 'nihilistic', 'conclusion', 'may', 'ultimately', 'be', 'considered', 'chiefly', 'vehicle', 'display', 'Sora', 'considerable', 'physical', 'attributes', 'built', '-and', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'totally', 'nude', 'pubic', 'hair', 'real', 'rarity', 'Japanese', 'soft', 'core', 'sex', 'flix', 'Having', 'seen', 'Sora', 'Aoi', 'few', 'movies', 'would', 'say', ""'Tsumugi"", 'really', 'suits', 'persona', 'better', 'other', 'more', ""'action"", 'oriented', 'films', 'been', 'cast', 'other', 'stand-out', 'role', 'was', 'film', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Wall', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'most', 'Pinku', 'film', 'clocks', 'relatively', 'short', '62', 'min', 'play', 'time', '..', 'Jap', 'w/', 'English', 'subs']",Tsumugi
