It was nice to see how the filmaker portrayed the house.  I could see many parts of the house that had stayed the same.  When the young girl left her home after her mother abandoned her, the storyline went down hill from there.  There are sexual and abusive parts in the film that were mishandled.  The only good part of the film was when the young girl used art to tell her story.",2,HICK,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,455,"['beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'grandfather', 'home', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'filmaker', 'portrayed', 'house', 'could', 'see', 'many', 'parts', 'house', 'had', 'stayed', 'same', 'When', 'young', 'girl', 'left', 'home', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'storyline', 'went', 'down', 'hill', 'there', 'are', 'sexual', 'abusive', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'mishandled', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'used', 'art', 'tell', 'story']",N/A
1544724,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B0082CWTSY,California Dreaming,"[0, 3]","I decided to watch this for two reasons.  1.  All of the critics panned it, and so I wanted to see if it was bad as everyone thought.  2.  Chloe Moretz is in it, she is a very good young actress, and so I believed that she might save this flick, no matter how bad it might be.But unfortunately, this is surely not one of Ms. Moretz's best performances.  Usually she gives it all she's got; watch ""Kick A--"" where she is Hit Girl if you disagree with me.  Or ""Let Me In"" as well, where she was terrific.  (I actually liked her performance in that better than the original performance in the foreign film ""Let the Right One In."")  But here, even she seems to almost mail it in.  I'm not convinced that she was into this during filming herself, and so I believe that she just went through the motions.  (My apologies to this fine young actress in advance if I am mistaken.)When I watch a film, I always try to figure out what the theme is as soon as possible.  Here, I struggled, thinking, ""What is the theme?  Is it, 'You're born, life stinks, and then you die'?""  But then I took a peek at the virtual DVD cover from the streaming version, and it says something like, ""Trouble Travels Together.""  Is this a hint, and if so, are they saying, ""Troubled people hook up with other troubled people"" - kind of a take on ""Birds of a feather. . ."" - or is it, ""For some people trouble just seems to follow.""  I also considered, ""Everyone creates his own little fantasy world just to get through the day.""  But the sad thing is, whatever the main theme happens to be, I don't much care anyway since the movie was just kind of blah.There is one major issue with this film.  Since it was filmed in the US, and due to the age of the main character - Ms. Moretz - there were certain scenes that could not be shown that were therefore simply implied.  I still wonder what happened in those scenes since the action wasn't shown.  But I believe that this watered down the original story perhaps.  I believe that it was adapted from a book, and it would be interesting to read that book to confirm my suspicions.Now, the director seems to be potentially a fan of David Lynch.  There are a couple of scenes - and musical choices - that tips this off.  Not to give too much away, but there is a shooting scene that reminded me of the movie ""Blue Velvet.""  And there is a close-up camera shot on the burner on a stove that seemed ""Lynchian"" as well.  I used to be a big fan of Mr. Lynch, but I have to admit, I started getting tired of his films as he seems to recycle some of these elements over and over and over.  But before you get too excited, I'd still recommend the controversial ""Blue Velvet"" for a very entertaining watch.  It's still one of my favorites due to it's quirkiness.But as for ""Hick""?  Can I recommend it?  Well, probably not.  I don't believe that it is as bad as the critics think, but it is close enough.",3,Pretty forgettable,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,2907,"['decided', 'watch', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'critics', 'panned', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'bad', 'everyone', 'thought', '2', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'very', 'good', 'young', 'actress', 'so', 'believed', 'might', 'save', 'flick', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'might', 'be.But', 'unfortunately', 'surely', 'not', 'one', 'Ms.', 'Moretz', 'best', 'performances', 'Usually', 'got', 'watch', 'Kick', 'where', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'disagree', 'Let', 'Me', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'was', 'terrific', 'actually', 'liked', 'performance', 'better', 'original', 'performance', 'foreign', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'here', 'even', 'almost', 'mail', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'was', 'filming', 'so', 'believe', 'just', 'went', 'motions', 'apologies', 'fine', 'young', 'actress', 'advance', 'am', 'mistaken', 'When', 'watch', 'film', 'always', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'theme', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Here', 'struggled', 'thinking', 'What', 'theme', ""'re"", 'born', 'life', 'stinks', 'then', 'die', 'then', 'took', 'peek', 'virtual', 'DVD', 'cover', 'streaming', 'version', 'something', 'Trouble', 'Travels', 'Together', 'hint', 'so', 'are', 'saying', 'Troubled', 'people', 'hook', 'up', 'other', 'troubled', 'people', 'kind', 'take', 'Birds', 'feather', 'people', 'trouble', 'just', 'follow', 'also', 'considered', 'Everyone', 'own', 'little', 'fantasy', 'world', 'just', 'get', 'day', 'sad', 'thing', 'whatever', 'main', 'theme', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'anyway', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'blah.There', 'one', 'major', 'issue', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', 'US', 'due', 'age', 'main', 'character', 'Ms.', 'Moretz', 'were', 'certain', 'scenes', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'shown', 'were', 'therefore', 'simply', 'implied', 'still', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'scenes', 'action', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'believe', 'watered', 'down', 'original', 'story', 'perhaps', 'believe', 'was', 'adapted', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'read', 'book', 'confirm', 'suspicions.Now', 'director', 'be', 'potentially', 'fan', 'David', 'Lynch', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'musical', 'choices', 'off', 'Not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'shooting', 'scene', 'reminded', 'movie', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'close-up', 'camera', 'shot', 'burner', 'stove', 'seemed', 'Lynchian', 'as', 'well', 'used', 'be', 'big', 'fan', 'Mr.', 'Lynch', 'have', 'admit', 'started', 'getting', 'tired', 'films', 'recycle', 'elements', 'get', 'too', 'excited', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'controversial', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'still', 'one', 'favorites', 'due', 'quirkiness.But', 'Hick', 'Can', 'recommend', 'Well', 'probably', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'think', 'close', 'enough']",N/A

Did the critics see the same film I saw? Not only is this film not garbage, but I really liked it! The acting is very good, especially the scene stealing Eddie Redmayne. Chloe was born to play Luli and Blake Lively even shows some acting chops as Glenda. Don't get me wrong, this is not a perfect film, it has it's pacing and plot hole problems and had I not read the book, I might even have been lost in a spot or two. It's definitely not a film for everyone based on the dark subject matter, but if you're looking for something good that is away from the mainstream dreck that Hollywood pumps out on a daily basis, then check this one out.

So there is nothing really new about the overall plot and a lot of it is a bit cliche. But what makes this movie go is Chloe Moretz. She delivers what should be an Oscar worthy performance. She goes from innocent to precocious to sensual. Just like Brooke Shields had Pretty Baby and Dakota Fanning had Hound Dog, this is the movie that takes a popular young actress and puts her in situations that are sexually charged, dangerous, and yes....just plain hot.Of course Chloe  will probably not be nominated because of her age, the weakness of the overall plot, and because the PC crowd would find this movie ""exploitive of a minor"" or some such rubbish.This movie is really about Chloe and her expansion into more mature roles that allow her in-born sensuality and sex-appeal to come forward. And the movie plays to these strengths. Make no mistake, Chloe has the same appeal to men as other ""hot"" female film stars in spite of her age.

The natural and unforced acting of Chloe Moretz is the single best aspect of ""Hick"" and makes it entertaining without getting bogged down in plot contrivance and predictability.  Pacing is even handed, and although the film is alternately violent and sweet it never overdoes either aspect.  The most memorable aspects of ""Hick"" are those in which Chloe's character becomes introspective and thoughtful about her life arc.  The weakest points when director Derick Martini succumbs to the nearly fatal flaw of exaggerating antagonists to the point of parody.

She knows that if she can just make it to Las Vegas, things will be fine, and she will find her spot in life. Along the way, she meets people and some of them aren't as trust worthy as she thinks they are.  Luli tries to hang on to her innocents through her drawings, they're a source of  inspiration for her.

Thirteen year old Luli (Moretz) comes from a very messed up family. She spends the night of her 13th birthday at a bar with her parents and when the dad is too drunk to drive home a big fight occurs. When her mother leaves with an insurance man and her dad gets mad and leaves she is left alone. Deciding she needs a fresh start she heads out on her own for Las Vegas. The best way to describe this movie really is to compare it to the movie ""Jolene"" that came out a few years ago. But I'm guessing most people didn't see it so I will do my best. It sounds strange to say this but this is a coming of age story about a 13 year old girl. Through the people she meets on her way she has new life experiences that involves things she shouldn't learn about for at least 5 more years. Moretz is amazing in this and I just wonder how long it will take until she wins an Oscar. The cast in this is also very good and the movie is very much worth watching all the way to the surprising and bittersweet ending. I liked it.

On the way she encounters a former rodeo cowboy Eddie Kreezer (Eddie Redmayne) and a cocaine-snorting swindler Glenda (Blake Lively).""Hick"" has almost everything that we would want in this kind of film: gifted actors and nice soundtrack music, plus excellent photography that captures the landscapes. What it doesn't have is a decent script. The story of Luli unfolds in a rather slow manner, but it was alright with me. Watching some of the events that happen to the girl is not very comfortable (though discreetly handled), but, sure, these things could happen in real life.But ... what is the point of the movie? ""Hick"" starts out as a film about Luli's growing pains, but halfway through the film Eddie (and to a lesser degree Glenda) takes over the story. They may not be very likable, but at least they are more interesting than the heroine Luli about whom we don't know much about. She tells much about her young brother in her voiceovers, but not much about herself. There are certainly fairy-tale undercurrents in the film (Luli is often seen mimicking characters from classic movies), but that part of the film is not fully explored.One good thing about ""Hick"" is the performances from the cast (including underused Alec Baldwin). Most memorable among them is Eddie Redmayne, who is to be seen in Tom Hooper-directed musical ""Les Mis&eacute;rables.""
