But, I do enjoy survival thrillers or whatever the specific label is that applies to ""The Mist"". (I can't remember right now. There is a well used label for just about every type of movie.) Anyway, I like this type of horror flick where you have people trapped, surrounded by some sort of monsters, they struggle to survive, fight the monsters, and then try to escape. The most interesting thing is the fighting that goes on between the people trapped together. Now, that is what works best in ""The Mist"" to me. The scariest monsters ultimately become some of the people your stuck with. And the movie is ultimately about us and our society. Well it's human nature too, that we are faced with, perhaps just as much as whatever has to do with America. The made-up monsters and nightmare scenerio in which a diverse group of people, a cross section of citizens -sometimes from very different backgrounds, becomes an exploration of real world social problems. Honestly, put me up against the monsters unleashed upon the town anyday, over some of the townsfolk(or city folk, to be fair). (I'm serious. You do NOT want to be trapped with Jesus Junkies if you want to survive.)Why the 1 Star deduction: Rating systems like this are kinda silly anyway, but 5 stars only go to works of perfection like ""The Shinning"" which is a perfect horror film classic. CGI is abused like hell by filmmakers these days and it's a shame. If they're going to use it I wish they'd use it well. You can tell when they cut corners and did not spend that extra time (and money)fleshing out the details of a creature. If you ain't got the funds to do it right, just leave more up to our imaginations please. Our imaginations are not all ruined by countless hours of video game play. A great idea is to still use puppets and models with CGI which can have incredible results. In several years all this CGI cr*p (&lt;-I don't know what words we can use on Amazon)is going to look much worse to us than it already does, leaving films of this period as dated as 1950s adventure films that used stop-motion puppets.",4,Fear Itself,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2179,"['was', 'fun', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'horror', 'flicks', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", ""watch'em"", 'regularity', 'do', 'enjoy', 'survival', 'thrillers', 'whatever', 'specific', 'label', 'applies', 'Mist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'right', 'now', 'well', 'used', 'label', 'just', 'type', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'like', 'type', 'horror', 'flick', 'where', 'have', 'people', 'trapped', 'surrounded', 'sort', 'monsters', 'struggle', 'survive', 'fight', 'monsters', 'then', 'try', 'escape', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'fighting', 'people', 'trapped', 'together', 'Now', 'what', 'best', 'Mist', 'scariest', 'monsters', 'ultimately', 'become', 'people', 'stuck', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'society', 'human', 'nature', 'too', 'are', 'faced', 'perhaps', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'America', 'made-up', 'monsters', 'nightmare', 'scenerio', 'diverse', 'group', 'people', 'cross', 'section', 'citizens', '-sometimes', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'exploration', 'real', 'world', 'social', 'problems', 'Honestly', 'put', 'up', 'monsters', 'unleashed', 'town', 'anyday', 'townsfolk', 'city', 'folk', 'be', 'fair', ""'m"", 'serious', 'do', 'NOT', 'want', 'be', 'trapped', 'Jesus', 'Junkies', 'want', 'survive', 'Why', '1', 'Star', 'deduction', 'Rating', 'systems', 'are', 'kinda', 'silly', 'anyway', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'go', 'works', 'perfection', 'Shinning', 'perfect', 'horror', 'film', 'classic', 'CGI', 'abused', 'hell', 'filmmakers', 'days', 'shame', ""'re"", 'going', 'use', 'wish', ""'d"", 'use', 'well', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'cut', 'corners', 'did', 'not', 'spend', 'extra', 'time', 'money', 'fleshing', 'out', 'details', 'creature', 'ai', ""n't"", 'got', 'funds', 'do', 'right', 'just', 'leave', 'more', 'up', 'imaginations', 'please', 'imaginations', 'are', 'not', 'ruined', 'countless', 'hours', 'video', 'game', 'play', 'great', 'idea', 'still', 'use', 'puppets', 'models', 'CGI', 'can', 'have', 'incredible', 'results', 'several', 'years', 'CGI', 'cr*p', 'lt', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'words', 'can', 'use', 'Amazon', 'going', 'look', 'much', 'worse', 'already', 'leaving', 'films', 'period', 'as', 'dated', '1950s', 'adventure', 'films', 'used', 'stop-motion', 'puppets']",N/A

To this end, Darabont did the story a greater justice with his decidedly Lovecraftian ending. In Lovecraftian literature (Cthulhu Mythos, et al), the stories are all about the futility of hope, insanity derived from seeing the horrific or beautiful ""beyond the measure a human might perceive"", and the good guys never winning in the end. Had HP written ""The Mist,"" he assuredly would have chosen the same ending as Darabont. Darabont did an amazing job making this film very-HP Lovecraft, from tentacles-action (also in the original King story), to truly cyclopean creatures that literally seemed to have walked off a Lovecraft story. Viewing the film as Lovecraftian, then, Darabont's ending completely fits with the rest of the story, and is the only way it could have ended. I'd love to know how SK felt when he saw it.

1126625,A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ,B0010X73ZG,A Customer,"[4, 4]","I read 'The Mist' short story by Stephen King many many years ago.Frank Darabont, the director, wanted to make this film before but the technology required was not available so he made the stunning 'Shawshank Redemption' instead, also based on a short story by Mr King. This film has gone straight into my top 10 of all time. Yes, I absolutely love this story.Without giving too much away the plot focuses on a dad and his son who go out to the local store....For reasons unknown, you guessed it, a strange white mist appears everywhere. The performances from all the cast are spot on, great believable characters. The film was shot using three different cameras at times, so the actors did not always know where cameras were during some of the scenes. It feels like a claustrophobic play at times and the tension is terrific.For a study in crowd behaviour and paranoia this is an incredibly and carefully paced thrill ride. It's so much fun and keeps you well on edge. Again, try not to read anything beforehand because even on the back of the Blu-ray disk cover it mentions something you really don't want to know, because it might spoil your experience. In the Blu-ray version I have it has the film available to also watch in black and white, which I presume is a homage to those old B movies like 'Them' and 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' (which, by the way, I am surprised has not been remade yet). You may be aware that Stephen King was disappointed about Stanley Kubricks version of 'The Shining' however he approved of 'The Mist'.There is a moment in 'The Mist' that Frank Darabont created, Stephen King himself said it was something he wished he thought of for his original story. If you see the film and are not sure which is the moment I refer to, just zap me an e-mail and I will explain. I think it stands out so much from the rest when you have good strong performances in a movie like this. It's a mix of talent that comes together so well. As an actor I wish I had a part in it, I would have been so proud to be in a delightful slice of entertaining scary horror. The script is solid as expected and it is such a change of direction for Frank Darabont. Keep an eye out for the actress Marcia Gay Harden. You may remember her in the Clint Eastwood Film 'Mystic River'. She is absolutely fantastic in this. Christ, after writing this review I might watch this film again, but in black and white this time.

1126626,A39FKP35OY8VM2,B0010X73ZG,Adam,"[3, 5]","Some people think scary movies require some serial killer or ridiculous swamp monster.  For those people, ""The Mist"" will likely not be enjoyed.  For others looking for a more developed horror storyline, they may find it enjoyable.It is the story of a father and son trapped in a grocery store after a mysterious mist settles over the town.  Hidden in this mist are creatures that kill anybody daring to venture from the safety of the building.  However, as the world outside grows more frightening, a crazy religious woman starts to mislead a few people into thinking the way to solve their problem is through sacrifice.  So, on one hand, this movie is a horror movie because of the monsters.  On the other hand, it is a horror movie because the ""good guys"" are up against a mob of frightened, mislead town residents that used to be friends and neighbors.All in all, I liked this movie, as I found it to be psychologically intimidating.  It is not particularly gory, although there are a few bloody scenes from creatures attacking people.  The religious woman got to be a little over the top at the beginning, but she became really scary towards the end and fit really well with the story.  Lots of elements from the novella can be found in this movie, so readers of King may enjoy it.  The ending is different and, although many people say it was dumb and unrealistic, it was the only decent way the story could have ended different from the book and still have the same impact as the remainder of the story.I give this film 5 stars.  I really like it and think others would too.

If that is true it must have been a pretty good book because I really enjoyed this movie. It was the type of thriller/horror that more played with your mind instead of killing people nonstop. There were people that died in the movie but this movie messed with your mind more psychologically than anything kind of like Steven Kings other movie the shining. I don't mind movies that have a lot of killing in them but I think the ones that play with your mind our and put you thinking what would if I do if I were put in that situation are better. Everyone that is trapped in that store to being the movie is on the same page to start but once we are half way through and near the end everyone is divided.

Being a horror movie fan, this movie was on my must see list, and I have to say it was one of the best horror movies I saw last year.  I do feel that the CGI got a bit unrealistic at times, but that was something that can be easily ignored for the story-line and effectiveness of the mist to heighten suspense.I felt the movie was very faithful to the book version (minus the ending, which is very different from the book ending, and I will discuss my thoughts on it later), and while not your regular scary horror movie, it was still terrifying in its portrayal of the breakdown of civilized and rational behavior when a disaster of nightmarish proportions occurs.The horror all starts the morning after a particularly violent thunderstorm in a small town in Maine.  The main character, David Drayton and his family (wife and young son), watch from their front yard as a very heavy mist rolls across the lake from the mountains.  Nothing that appears out of the ordinary and Drayton dismisses it from his mind.  Later, as Drayton and his son go to the grocery store in town, the wail of emergency sirens begins as the mysterious mist creeps into town.  Things become interesting when a bloodied man suddenly bursts into the store yelling something is in the mist and ""got"" someone before his very eyes.The suspense and tension begins as everyone first tries to figure out what exactly is the mist, what is out there, what to do, and when it is partly realized what is going on, how to survive in this strange, new world.  I think the movie was very effective in highlighting the various behaviors from certain groups that occur in such a chaotic and bewildering scenario.  The behavior of the ""sheep"", those people willing to do anything and listen to anyone to feel safe and secure, and the few people who try to stay calm, clear-headed, and try to make sense of a terrifying situation.I felt the ending was appropriate for such a dark, despairing movie.  It really looks like the end of the world has come, and the ending fits with such a theme.  Any horror movie (or book) fan knows that most horror stories have a dark twist at the end, or if it doesn't end on a dark note, it doesn't conclude with a very happy ending either.  There is always some matters that are left open where you get the sense not all is as it appears to be.  Or if the viewer expects the movie to end in one way, it goes in another direction entirely, stunning the viewer as is the case with The Mist.Overall, this movie was very good and I recommend it.  Of the most recent King adaptations to screen (I'm thinking 1408, which I also saw, and that movie was terrible) it is one of the better ones.",5,One of the best horror movies to come out in 2007,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,2743,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'Being', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'movie', 'was', 'must', 'see', 'list', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'saw', 'last', 'year', 'do', 'feel', 'CGI', 'got', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'times', 'was', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'ignored', 'story-line', 'effectiveness', 'mist', 'heighten', 'suspense.I', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'version', 'ending', 'very', 'different', 'book', 'ending', 'will', 'discuss', 'thoughts', 'later', 'not', 'regular', 'scary', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'terrifying', 'portrayal', 'breakdown', 'civilized', 'rational', 'behavior', 'when', 'disaster', 'nightmarish', 'proportions', 'occurs.The', 'horror', 'morning', 'particularly', 'violent', 'thunderstorm', 'small', 'town', 'Maine', 'main', 'character', 'David', 'Drayton', 'family', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'watch', 'front', 'yard', 'very', 'heavy', 'mist', 'rolls', 'lake', 'mountains', 'Nothing', 'ordinary', 'Drayton', 'mind', 'Later', 'Drayton', 'son', 'go', 'grocery', 'store', 'town', 'wail', 'emergency', 'sirens', 'mysterious', 'mist', 'creeps', 'town', 'become', 'interesting', 'when', 'bloodied', 'man', 'suddenly', 'store', 'yelling', 'something', 'mist', 'got', 'someone', 'very', 'eyes.The', 'suspense', 'tension', 'begins', 'everyone', 'first', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'exactly', 'mist', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'partly', 'realized', 'what', 'going', 'how', 'survive', 'strange', 'new', 'world', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'highlighting', 'various', 'behaviors', 'certain', 'groups', 'occur', 'chaotic', 'bewildering', 'scenario', 'behavior', 'sheep', 'people', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'listen', 'anyone', 'feel', 'safe', 'secure', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'stay', 'calm', 'clear-headed', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'terrifying', 'situation.I', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'appropriate', 'such', 'dark', 'despairing', 'movie', 'really', 'end', 'world', 'come', 'ending', 'fits', 'theme', 'horror', 'movie', 'book', 'fan', 'most', 'horror', 'stories', 'have', 'dark', 'twist', 'end', ""n't"", 'end', 'dark', 'note', ""n't"", 'conclude', 'very', 'happy', 'ending', 'either', 'always', 'matters', 'are', 'left', 'open', 'where', 'get', 'sense', 'not', 'be', 'viewer', 'movie', 'end', 'one', 'way', 'direction', 'entirely', 'stunning', 'viewer', 'case', 'Mist.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'recommend', 'most', 'recent', 'King', 'adaptations', 'screen', ""'m"", 'thinking', '1408', 'also', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'one', 'better', 'ones']",N/A

It is sharp, has good color, and for the b/w version, has high contrast.  However, it does have a fair amount of grain to it (could be bad if you're expecting a crystal-clear transfer; could be good because it adds to the visceral nature of the film).*Contains deleted scenes, several fascinating featurettes, webisodes, and trailers (same stuff as from the 2-disc DVD set).  It's all contained on disc one.  Disc two has only the black-and-white version of the movie (with an introduction).*The movie itself seems to be influenced by HP Lovecraft; the monsters are all otherworldly bugs and shapeless monsters. Definitely some of the freakiest monsters ever put on the screen.*Also, special effects are pretty good.  Maybe not the best, but better than most other Stephen King based movies.*There are only a few bad scenes of violence, but they are exceptionally brutal and quite scary!*Even scarier than the monsters are the people. Most of the movie focuses on how everybody reacts to the situation, and there are many mixed and wild reactions. Many people act dumb and irrationaly, and few are sensible. This makes for very realistic and intense drama.*As a whole, it is a deep, brutal exploration of human nature in an extreme apocalyptic situation. The whole film is very thought-provoking.*Most of the story is close to the original novella by Stephen King; only the ending is different (see below).*It's not as corny or cliched as some of the other Stephen King works.The Bad Things*The ending was exceptionally brutal, and can be seen as either good or bad. I think it could have had a happier ending, but as it is in the film, it does leave you thinking and feeling bitter.*On the minus side, the ending is radically different from the original novella.*Sometimes, you just want to punch these stupid characters in the face (then again, this could be a good thing too, because the drama really absorbs the audience).This definitely goes above and beyond my expectations. It's not the typical horror flick; it's an intense thought-provoking study of people under pressure. The result is explosive, and unfortunately, highly believable. Even though it is stylistically similar to ""Dreamcatcher,"" or ""The Thing,"" it is more akin to ""Children of Men"" or ""Pan's Labyrinth.""

Are the monsters both scary and a bit silly? Of course. Are the special effects believable? Quite.Generally speaking, I've been a fan of King's non-monsterific works, like ""Misery"" and ""Delores Clayborne"", but I haven't enjoyed most of his horror books (my least favorite being ""Christine"").  When adapted to film, I've enjoyed them even less, with a few exceptions. ""The Mist"" is one of them.  I thought the book was better than average, but the movie seriously improved on the book.So, what sets this movie apart from inferior adaptations, like ""Christine"" or ""The Tommyknockers""? First, I thought the characters were better drawn and [generally] acted more as real people would in an unbelievable situation. Second, while the beasties were peculiar and horrifying, they didn't seem like caricatures, like Christine, or ill-conceived concepts, like the Tommyknockers. Third, Frank Darabont is quite good at putting characters in menacing situations, and getting the audience to feel it (just watch ""The Walking Dead"" for a great example). Last, the ending. It was unexpected, non-Hollywood, and was much better than the end in the book.I just got the Blu Ray, which includes a black and white version of The Mist.

Frank darabonts excellent adaptation of one of stephen kings lesser known novellas is full of great ideas and with a necessary first half of the movie given over more to character development rather than needless gore and empty shocks, this in turn leads to a far more satisfying second and third acts when you actually care about their plight, this is the key to a great movie, especially in this genre. Thomas jane heads a cast of great character actors as a simple trip to the supermarket turns into a siege when a huge mist descends upon the town full of other worldly creature's. Its a simple tale of 'who's the worst animal' the creature's outside or the ones trapped inside? but it's told with such glee and abandonment that you can't help but be absorbed into king's rather eerie world. The beasts themselves are a mix bag of lovecraftean giants and mutated insects and the mist itself adds to there mystery although this was probably more for budgetary reasons than for effect, but it's hard not to feel a bit let down that the bigger ones don't get more screen time, however the scene in the pharmacy with some terrifying arachnid types more than compensates. This is a rare horror movie, one that invests time and energy into it's inhabitants and is all the better for it, after all it's the ending that has had more criticism than anything else and that was for being so morbid and sad, but if this was a standard stalk and slash gorefest would anyone really care? i doubt it. see it.",4,The Best king adaptation ever?.....maybe,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,1838,"['thing', 'mist', 'up', 'kinda', 'way', 'beasties', 'do', 'movie', 'One', 'minute', 'thinking', 'watching', 'average', 'modern', 'day', 'homage', '50s', 'b', 'movies', 'then', 'bang', 'what', 'actually', 'watching', 'masterful', 'execution', 'storytelling', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'terror', 'keep', 'toes', 'curled', 'Frank', 'darabonts', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'one', 'stephen', 'kings', 'lesser', 'known', 'novellas', 'full', 'great', 'ideas', 'necessary', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'given', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'rather', 'needless', 'gore', 'empty', 'shocks', 'turn', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'when', 'actually', 'care', 'plight', 'key', 'great', 'movie', 'especially', 'genre', 'Thomas', 'jane', 'heads', 'cast', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'simple', 'trip', 'supermarket', 'siege', 'when', 'huge', 'mist', 'descends', 'town', 'full', 'other', 'worldly', 'creature', 'simple', 'tale', ""'who"", 'worst', 'animal', 'creature', 'outside', 'ones', 'trapped', 'told', 'such', 'glee', 'abandonment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'absorbed', 'king', 'rather', 'eerie', 'world', 'beasts', 'are', 'mix', 'bag', 'lovecraftean', 'giants', 'mutated', 'insects', 'mist', 'there', 'mystery', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'budgetary', 'reasons', 'effect', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'bigger', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'however', 'scene', 'pharmacy', 'terrifying', 'arachnid', 'types', 'more', 'compensates', 'rare', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'time', 'energy', 'inhabitants', 'better', 'ending', 'had', 'more', 'criticism', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'being', 'so', 'morbid', 'sad', 'was', 'standard', 'stalk', 'slash', 'gorefest', 'would', 'anyone', 'really', 'care', 'i', 'doubt', 'see']",N/A

Due to King's various creatures slithering, buzzing, or towering above like walking skyscrapers, I figured a movie would never materialize. Thank God for Frank Darabont! He uses just enough cgi to keep things interesting. After all, the hideous monsters in the mist are only as frightening as the  human monsters that emerge during the invasion. The folks trapped in the grocery store become their own worst enemies, nearly dooming themselves without much help from any titanic terrors! Marcia Gay Harden (The Dead Girl) is perfectly twisted as the bible-waving Mrs. Carmody. Mr. Drayton (Thomas Jane) tries logic, common sense, and other such useless tools in a hopeless attempt to reason w/ the unbalanced prophet, who soon gathers a group of mindless followers! So, while an army of creatures lumber about outside, the humans fight an epic battle of wills inside. Very well done. Yes, the ending is different from the book.

1126655,A1P7O2PAA8H1DD,B0010X73ZG,Blade329,"[2, 9]","This movie was so depressing and unnecessary.  It was more about psychology and feral instincts and less to do with monsters in the mist.  It's underlying message is pretty simplistic, that people are mostly bad and will do horrible things in the face of an apocalypse.  Yes I'm sure that some people would revert to animals under certain circumstances, but I think most would not.  The director also really cheats to make his point possible.  He goes out of his way to make the crazy woman, Mrs. Carmody, look like she's got the makings of a prophet.  He deliberately spares her the fatal sting of a giant bug, making it look like she's got some spiritual power.  The monsters also seem to follow her instructions, by not attacking when she says they wont.  So, if you are stacking the deck like that, then of course it makes your message more acceptable.  It's like tipping the scales of an experiment to more easily reach your predetermined conclusion.  It's ridiculous.** SPOILER ALERT **  This movie is also unnecessarily brutal.  I'm not talking about the monsters here either.  I'm talking about the brutal stabbing of a soldier just before they throw him out the door for the monsters to get him.  What was the point of that?  If he was going to be thrown out to be eaten, then why the stabbing over and over again.  It's just the lame director throwing out some more shock violence.  By the way, this did not happen in the book.Aside from the social experiment, the rest of the movie is interesting.  The monsters are pretty well done, though the special effects are average.  It's got some intense scenes that work pretty well.  You get bits and pieces of what's going on from the soldiers.  That's where you find out that a secret government experiment went horribly wrong.  They figured out a way to ""look"" into other dimensions.  Unfortunately, they allowed one of those dimensions to spill into our world.The ending is also just emotionally punishing.  ** SPOILER **.  The escapees from the market drive in the mist until they run out of gas.  The main character, David, and the other adults in the car decide that suicide is better than starving to death or being eaten.  David shoots everyone in the car including his young son.  No bullets are left for himself though . Distraught, he gets out of the car and decides to commit suicide by being eaten by monsters.  Just then, the mist clears and he sees the U.S. military approaching in force.  They are gathering survivors and killing all the monsters.  If he had waited a few more minutes, then they would have all survived.  What horrible and depressing ending.  It makes absolutely no sense for these characters, who went through so much to escape, to all of a sudden give up so quickly.  I left the theater feeling numb.  Was there a point to this movie?? I think the point was that the director wanted shock value and to be different.  He throws you a bone by clearing the mist and showing that the nightmare was ending, but come on.Overall, this movie will be fine if you don't mind depressing movies with little hope and where the main characters (good guys) all die.",2,The feel bad movie for the holidays.,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",2010,3141,"['movie', 'was', 'so', 'depressing', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'more', 'psychology', 'feral', 'instincts', 'less', 'do', 'monsters', 'mist', 'underlying', 'message', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'people', 'are', 'mostly', 'bad', 'will', 'do', 'horrible', 'things', 'face', 'apocalypse', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'would', 'revert', 'animals', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'think', 'most', 'would', 'not', 'director', 'also', 'really', 'make', 'point', 'possible', 'way', 'make', 'crazy', 'woman', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'look', 'got', 'makings', 'prophet', 'deliberately', 'fatal', 'sting', 'giant', 'bug', 'making', 'look', 'got', 'spiritual', 'power', 'monsters', 'also', 'seem', 'follow', 'instructions', 'not', 'attacking', 'when', 'wont', 'So', 'are', 'stacking', 'deck', 'then', 'course', 'message', 'more', 'acceptable', 'tipping', 'scales', 'experiment', 'more', 'easily', 'reach', 'predetermined', 'conclusion', 'ridiculous', '**', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '**', 'movie', 'also', 'unnecessarily', 'brutal', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'monsters', 'here', 'either', ""'m"", 'talking', 'brutal', 'stabbing', 'soldier', 'just', 'throw', 'out', 'door', 'monsters', 'get', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'thrown', 'out', 'be', 'eaten', 'then', 'why', 'stabbing', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'lame', 'director', 'throwing', 'out', 'more', 'shock', 'violence', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'book.Aside', 'social', 'experiment', 'rest', 'movie', 'interesting', 'monsters', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'average', 'got', 'intense', 'scenes', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'get', 'bits', 'pieces', 'what', 'going', 'soldiers', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'secret', 'government', 'experiment', 'went', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'figured', 'out', 'way', 'look', 'other', 'dimensions', 'Unfortunately', 'allowed', 'one', 'dimensions', 'spill', 'world.The', 'ending', 'also', 'just', 'emotionally', 'punishing', '**', 'SPOILER', '**', 'escapees', 'market', 'drive', 'mist', 'run', 'gas', 'main', 'character', 'David', 'other', 'adults', 'car', 'decide', 'suicide', 'better', 'starving', 'death', 'being', 'eaten', 'David', 'shoots', 'everyone', 'car', 'including', 'young', 'son', 'bullets', 'are', 'left', 'Distraught', 'car', 'commit', 'suicide', 'being', 'eaten', 'monsters', 'Just', 'then', 'mist', 'clears', 'U.S.', 'military', 'approaching', 'force', 'are', 'gathering', 'survivors', 'killing', 'monsters', 'had', 'waited', 'few', 'more', 'minutes', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'What', 'horrible', 'depressing', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'characters', 'who', 'went', 'so', 'much', 'escape', 'sudden', 'give', 'up', 'so', 'quickly', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'numb', 'Was', 'point', 'movie', 'think', 'point', 'was', 'director', 'wanted', 'shock', 'value', 'be', 'different', 'bone', 'clearing', 'mist', 'showing', 'nightmare', 'was', 'ending', 'come', 'on.Overall', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'depressing', 'movies', 'little', 'hope', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'good', 'guys', 'die']",N/A

1126658,A32RNVRS7KEV8A,B0010X73ZG,blister,"[3, 3]","Being a fan of Stephen King, I had read ""The Mist"", his novella, some years back and enjoyed it.  The sense of terror and what can happen to people's psychological states when trapped and desperately seeking escape and reason came across very well.I was excited to hear of a film adaptation, then was intrigued when I heard of a shocker of an ending that differed from King's novella.  So I took a chance and bought it.First of all, this is a combination science fiction/horror film, but with emphasis not so much on the monsters (which are very send ""chills down the spine type"" of monsters, especially the smaller buzzing, stinging, acid-web shooting ones).  Rather, the director chooses to explore the depths to which people can change given desperate situations.Starting out simply enough,(warning-some spoilers here) a freak thunderstorm brings then a mist which traps a group of people in a supermarket.  I found this very effective with the town siren going off, police cars racing by, and the first victim to get away running into the store claiming ""there's something in the mist!""What then follows is a character study of how people react. This is to me the horror element. Thomas Jane, in my opinion a good and too often overlooked gifted actor, does very well in his role as the artist trying to get others to understand the seriousness of the situation, but more importantly, as a devoted father determined to protect his son at whatever cost.  Marcia Gay Harden (bless her heart, that role had to have drained her emotionally) soars into orbit with her almost campy, over the top role as the religious individual who turns her beliefs into more irrational and insane thought patterns and tries (and succeeds) in bringing many others wanting answers to her side.Others on the good and ""bad"" side do well in their roles, but I do agree with what one critic said-that is the waste of actor Andre Baugher.  The fact he was a stubborn lawyer was one thing, but to believe others in the store were playing a joke on him when told there was blood and a remaining part of one of the monsters in the store room, even when the store manager also went back and saw it and came back and reiterated the truth-that was dissapointing.  Baugher's early demise in the film was also a dissapointment, whereas the film would have been more effective and involving with him working with Jane's character and coming to believe something in fact WAS out there in the mist. He would have been an asset to the closing sequence with his own stubborn beliefs being challenged through.It is true, the monsters and creatures don't make numerous appearances, but when they do, I was riveted, especially (spoiler) when the store window broke and they started getting in.  Yikes.  The pharmacy scene too with creatures of a different type was creepy.The ending is really the most powerful factor on how one looks at this film. I see the view point in that it is one of the darkest, most depressing, bleakest, all hope is gone type of movie endings I've seen.Wow.  That's all I can say. In all honesty, I read other reviews here to find the ending and I'm glad I did, or I might have been more upset.  We go to the movies to see sometimes scary movies and we're used to the ""oh, the monster isn't dead after all"" or ending like that.  The director here takes an entirely different approach and wow, it packs a wallop.  It is unsettling and shocking.In defense, though, the ending does portray sacrifice (how far would we go to spare a loved one from possible suffering-it's about a father's love for his son) and it also portrays a sense of reality in that life doesn't always have happy endings and what cruel twists of fate there can be.  Many reviewers have stated Jane's character never would have done that.  In all honesty, how do we really know?  How would we truly react if something bizarre like that happened and a loved one was at risk at any moment?  It's a sobering concept!!I credit the director, actors, and special effects wizards behind this movie in that if you look at it as a straight monster-science fiction/horror movie (monsters both creature and some human!), it does work.  If it doesn't for you, turn off the movie when the few that escape drive off into the mist and leave it at that....Sincerely,William",4,Unsettling or Powerful Horror Film-Depends on how you look at it,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,4313,"['Being', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'had', 'read', 'Mist', 'novella', 'years', 'back', 'enjoyed', 'sense', 'terror', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'people', 'psychological', 'states', 'when', 'trapped', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'escape', 'reason', 'came', 'very', 'well.I', 'was', 'excited', 'hear', 'film', 'adaptation', 'then', 'was', 'intrigued', 'when', 'heard', 'shocker', 'ending', 'differed', 'King', 'novella', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'it.First', 'combination', 'science', 'fiction/horror', 'film', 'emphasis', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'monsters', 'are', 'very', 'send', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'type', 'monsters', 'especially', 'smaller', 'buzzing', 'stinging', 'acid-web', 'shooting', 'ones', 'director', 'explore', 'depths', 'people', 'can', 'change', 'given', 'desperate', 'situations.Starting', 'out', 'simply', 'enough', 'warning-some', 'spoilers', 'here', 'freak', 'thunderstorm', 'then', 'mist', 'group', 'people', 'supermarket', 'found', 'very', 'effective', 'town', 'siren', 'going', 'off', 'police', 'cars', 'racing', 'first', 'victim', 'get', 'away', 'running', 'store', 'claiming', 'something', 'mist', 'What', 'then', 'character', 'study', 'how', 'people', 'react', 'horror', 'element', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'opinion', 'good', 'too', 'often', 'overlooked', 'gifted', 'actor', 'very', 'well', 'role', 'artist', 'trying', 'get', 'others', 'understand', 'seriousness', 'situation', 'more', 'importantly', 'devoted', 'father', 'determined', 'protect', 'son', 'cost', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'heart', 'role', 'had', 'have', 'drained', 'emotionally', 'orbit', 'almost', 'campy', 'top', 'role', 'religious', 'individual', 'who', 'beliefs', 'more', 'irrational', 'insane', 'thought', 'patterns', 'tries', 'bringing', 'many', 'others', 'wanting', 'answers', 'side.Others', 'good', 'bad', 'side', 'do', 'well', 'roles', 'do', 'agree', 'what', 'one', 'critic', 'said-that', 'waste', 'actor', 'Andre', 'Baugher', 'fact', 'was', 'stubborn', 'lawyer', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'believe', 'others', 'store', 'were', 'playing', 'joke', 'when', 'told', 'was', 'blood', 'remaining', 'part', 'one', 'monsters', 'store', 'room', 'even', 'when', 'store', 'manager', 'also', 'went', 'back', 'saw', 'came', 'back', 'reiterated', 'truth-that', 'was', 'dissapointing', 'Baugher', 'early', 'demise', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'dissapointment', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'involving', 'working', 'Jane', 'character', 'coming', 'believe', 'something', 'fact', 'WAS', 'there', 'mist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'asset', 'closing', 'sequence', 'own', 'stubborn', 'beliefs', 'being', 'challenged', 'through.It', 'true', 'monsters', 'creatures', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'numerous', 'appearances', 'when', 'do', 'was', 'riveted', 'especially', 'spoiler', 'when', 'store', 'window', 'broke', 'started', 'getting', 'Yikes', 'pharmacy', 'scene', 'too', 'creatures', 'different', 'type', 'was', 'creepy.The', 'ending', 'really', 'most', 'powerful', 'factor', 'how', 'one', 'film', 'see', 'view', 'point', 'one', 'darkest', 'most', 'depressing', 'bleakest', 'hope', 'gone', 'type', 'movie', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'seen.Wow', 'can', 'say', 'honesty', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'find', 'ending', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'upset', 'go', 'movies', 'see', 'sometimes', 'scary', 'movies', ""'re"", 'used', 'oh', 'monster', ""n't"", 'dead', 'ending', 'director', 'here', 'entirely', 'different', 'approach', 'wow', 'wallop', 'unsettling', 'shocking.In', 'defense', 'though', 'ending', 'portray', 'sacrifice', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'spare', 'loved', 'one', 'possible', 'suffering-it', 'father', 'love', 'son', 'also', 'sense', 'reality', 'life', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'what', 'cruel', 'twists', 'fate', 'can', 'be', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'Jane', 'character', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'honesty', 'how', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'How', 'would', 'truly', 'react', 'something', 'bizarre', 'happened', 'loved', 'one', 'was', 'risk', 'moment', 'sobering', 'concept', 'credit', 'director', 'actors', 'special', 'effects', 'wizards', 'movie', 'look', 'straight', 'monster-science', 'fiction/horror', 'movie', 'monsters', 'creature', 'human', 'work', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'when', 'few', 'escape', 'drive', 'off', 'mist', 'leave', '.Sincerely', 'William']",N/A

1126660,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0010X73ZG,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 4]","There has been -- and probably will be for some time -- speculation about the end of this film and how it strayed from Stephen King's novella by the same name:The Mist. There's good and bad in equal measure, depending upon your stance on Hollywood Horror versus the literary kind. But let's back-up and look at the beginning before we rush to the end...Equal parts supernatural thriller and science fiction yarn, the novella (published in 1985 in a short story collection entitledSkeleton Crew) was, well, phenomenal. It is the type of story most horror fans associate Stephen King with. Compartmentalized. Freakishly different. Plays on morality. Just flat-out good writing. King did well back in the 70s and 80s, but he has floundered as a writer in recent years with his horribly badFrom a Buick 8and the equally putridDreamcatcher(which was made into a very unfortunatefilmstarring Morgan Freeman). What exactly happened to Mr. King, I'm not sure. He hadn't had his brush with death (yet) and his earlier work sent the proverbial chills up my spine (most notably the excellentThe ShiningandIt). Regardless of past or more present works, Mr. King did get lucky withThe Shawshank Redemptionin that he got Frank Darabont to write the screenplay and direct. The Shawshank Redemption has been labeled one of the top 100 films of all times by nearly every film critic in the world, and it is one of my top ten favorites. The transfer from book to film went exceptionally well, and this was in no small part thanks to Darabont's work. Darabont did similarly nice work onThe Green Mile, but it didn't quite reach the heights that Shawshank did. But when I saw that Darbont was attached to this film, I leapt at the chance to watch it.Needless to say (because of my cool acceptance rating), I found The Mist to be entertaining but sadly lacking in several areas. But let's start with the good...The creature effects. The combined work using CGI and stop animation was excellent. KNB EFX Group as the Special Effects crew and CafeFX doing the Visual Effects showed us some eerily nice work. The ominous cloud of mist was perfect enough to shroud any early identification of the creatures within it and the actors reacted to the mist just as you would expect.Marcia Gay Harden (Into the Wild) stars as Mrs. Carmody, the bible-thumping, old-testament wielding, blood-seeking, Christian hypocrite that we all enjoyed in the novella. I hated her in the novella and I hated her here, meaning that Gay Harden pulled off a very good performance.Any further positives however (save one), get blurred by the ridiculous nature of the scripted characters. Too many times we get the `shock' effect simply for shock effect, rather than sticking with the compartmentalization of the situation (i.e., people of differing backgrounds at each others' throats in a supermarket during a crisis situation). Characters act as if they are surprised to see death and destruction after it has already been shown to them just a few hours before. People leap for weapons when a creature is nearby ready to skewer them. Main actor Thomas Jane who plays David Drayton could have been played by just about anyone, meaning that I didn't find his portrayal of this character memorable (whereas Gay Harden nailed her role) And the list goes on...Getting back to the ending -- and my final positive note -- I have to say that it was hampered somewhat by my enjoyment of the written word versus this visual medium. In the novella, Mr. King leaves the ending fairly ambiguous. Which I liked. I liked a lot. And here, in the film, that gets changed to a much more somber ending. Although I liked the fact that Darabont didn't sugarcoat the final act, I do think he could have kept King's original ending and added a few more fans to his legions. But let's make it perfectly clear that this ending is absolutely in-line with the true horror genre, which is why it got a semi-positive rating from me.",3,A Mediocre Film Based On A Fantastic Novella,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,3956,"['been', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'speculation', 'end', 'film', 'how', 'strayed', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'same', 'name', 'Mist', 'good', 'bad', 'equal', 'measure', 'depending', 'stance', 'Hollywood', 'Horror', 'literary', 'kind', 'let', 'back-up', 'look', 'beginning', 'rush', 'end', 'Equal', 'parts', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'science', 'fiction', 'yarn', 'novella', 'published', '1985', 'short', 'story', 'collection', 'entitledSkeleton', 'Crew', 'was', 'well', 'phenomenal', 'type', 'story', 'most', 'horror', 'fans', 'associate', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Compartmentalized', 'Freakishly', 'different', 'Plays', 'morality', 'Just', 'flat-out', 'good', 'writing', 'King', 'did', 'well', 'back', '70s', '80s', 'floundered', 'writer', 'recent', 'years', 'horribly', 'Buick', '8and', 'equally', 'putridDreamcatcher', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'unfortunatefilmstarring', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'What', 'exactly', 'happened', 'Mr.', 'King', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'brush', 'death', 'yet', 'earlier', 'work', 'sent', 'proverbial', 'up', 'spine', 'most', 'notably', 'excellentThe', 'ShiningandIt', 'Regardless', 'past', 'more', 'present', 'works', 'Mr.', 'King', 'did', 'get', 'lucky', 'withThe', 'Shawshank', 'Redemptionin', 'got', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'write', 'screenplay', 'direct', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'been', 'labeled', 'one', 'top', '100', 'films', 'times', 'nearly', 'film', 'critic', 'world', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'favorites', 'transfer', 'book', 'film', 'went', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'was', 'small', 'part', 'thanks', 'Darabont', 'work', 'Darabont', 'did', 'similarly', 'nice', 'work', 'onThe', 'Green', 'Mile', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'heights', 'Shawshank', 'did', 'when', 'saw', 'Darbont', 'was', 'attached', 'film', 'leapt', 'chance', 'watch', 'it.Needless', 'say', 'cool', 'acceptance', 'rating', 'found', 'Mist', 'be', 'entertaining', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'several', 'areas', 'let', 'start', 'good', 'creature', 'effects', 'combined', 'work', 'using', 'CGI', 'stop', 'animation', 'was', 'excellent', 'KNB', 'EFX', 'Group', 'Special', 'Effects', 'crew', 'CafeFX', 'doing', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'showed', 'eerily', 'nice', 'work', 'ominous', 'cloud', 'mist', 'was', 'perfect', 'enough', 'shroud', 'early', 'identification', 'creatures', 'actors', 'reacted', 'mist', 'just', 'would', 'expect.Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Into', 'Wild', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'bible-thumping', 'old-testament', 'wielding', 'blood-seeking', 'Christian', 'hypocrite', 'enjoyed', 'novella', 'hated', 'novella', 'hated', 'here', 'meaning', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'good', 'performance.Any', 'further', 'positives', 'however', 'save', 'one', 'get', 'blurred', 'ridiculous', 'nature', 'scripted', 'characters', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'get', 'shock', 'effect', 'simply', 'shock', 'effect', 'rather', 'sticking', 'compartmentalization', 'situation', 'i.e.', 'people', 'differing', 'backgrounds', 'others', 'throats', 'supermarket', 'crisis', 'situation', 'Characters', 'act', 'are', 'surprised', 'see', 'death', 'destruction', 'already', 'been', 'shown', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'People', 'leap', 'weapons', 'when', 'creature', 'nearby', 'ready', 'skewer', 'Main', 'actor', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'who', 'David', 'Drayton', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'just', 'anyone', 'meaning', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'portrayal', 'character', 'memorable', 'whereas', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'nailed', 'role', 'list', 'Getting', 'back', 'ending', 'final', 'positive', 'note', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'hampered', 'somewhat', 'enjoyment', 'written', 'word', 'versus', 'visual', 'medium', 'novella', 'Mr.', 'King', 'ending', 'fairly', 'ambiguous', 'Which', 'liked', 'liked', 'lot', 'here', 'film', 'changed', 'much', 'more', 'somber', 'ending', 'liked', 'fact', 'Darabont', 'did', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'final', 'act', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'King', 'original', 'ending', 'added', 'few', 'more', 'fans', 'legions', 'let', 'make', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'in-line', 'true', 'horror', 'genre', 'why', 'got', 'semi-positive', 'rating']",N/A

It's a bit pretentious, never deciding on whether it wants to be cerebral or straight up horror and its attempts at irony are heavy-handed and lack a sense of craft. It also suffered from the dumb girlfriend syndrome; why did we let it get to this point, why are we standing around and not running. The usual deadmeat characters with few, if any, surprises didn't help either.On the plus side and the reason I can still give the movie three stars is it's very well acted by a virtual ensemble cast. This helps to make the flick very engrossing for quite a while. Also the special fx are pretty good even if the action sequences aren't directed with any panache.All in all, it's an okay time killer but not nearly as good as Feast or Slither, both of which had a much better sense of irony and many more surprises on much slimmer budgets.

And that is why The Mist is one of my favorite movies of the last decade. Based on one of Stephen King's best and most Lovecraftian stories, The Mist tells the story of the aftermath of a particularly bad storm on a small town in Maine. The town supports a military instillation, one that apparently is engaged in some top secret research. The storm unleashes something from behind, and whatever it is, it hides in the mist.The main characters are trapped in a supermarket, with the mist surrounding them. And as the tension builds inside the building, the people inside become as dangerous as whatever is hiding in the shadows. The movie is loyal to the book, and this is yet another instance of Stephen King taking a simple but brilliant idea and crafting it into a stunningly horrifying masterpiece.It's rare that I worry too much about spoilers in a review. After all, it comes with the territory. But I don't want to say too much about The Mist. It shouldn't be ruined. There's simply too much to enjoy.The Mist is one of Frank Darabont's greatest works, and many of the actors in the film went on to star in The Walking Dead.

1126667,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0010X73ZG,Brian E. Erland,"[5, 6]","Synopsis: The '07 release `The Mist' unfolds like a Lovecraftian nightmare come alive in a small rural American community.  Cloaked within a dense, inexplicable mist that engulfs the town lurks a collection of phantasmagorical creatures ranging from what appears to be large, mutated dragonflies and spiders to enormous monstrosities that would answer to such diabolical names as Shoggoth, or Cthulhu if this film had been adapted from a H.P. Lovecraft novel. Though no mention of the nefarious Necronomicon is ever mentioned surely some blasphemous occult conjuring must have been going on in that top secret military base located on the outskirts of town that released these other dimensional beings into our world.David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his young son are trapped inside a supermarket with a group of terrified town residents and unfortunate travelers with a storefront wall of glass serving as their only protection from the mist and the horrors that await outside. Thoughts and emotions run wild within their precarious refuge. Some escape into denial, some fall into religious hysteria and some contemplate suicide. Only a brave few seem willing to face the truth and plan an escape, or die trying.Critique: `The Mist' is an exciting, harrowing film that firmly held my interest from beginning to end. Christopher Lambert look-a-like Thomas Jane delivers a solid performance as the strong and valiant David Drayton who is forced to not only suppress his own personal fear of the incomprehensible menace outside but deal with the mounting emotional onslaught of those around him. I also enjoyed the performance of Laurie Holden as the level-headed but vulnerable Amanda Dumfries and Marcia Gay Harden as the unstable religious zealot Mrs. Camody. On the negative side I wish they hadn't done the too often repeated alien incubation sequence. It was great in `Alien' but enough is enough. The religious fanaticism subplot was also a little over-the-top for my tastes but it certainly wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of the central storyline.When all is said and done it's definitely the Lovecraft inspired monsters in the mist that capture my imagination. I keep seeing in my minds eye those final moments of the film as the valiant few drive through the fog and view all the mayhem and destruction wrought by these creatures. The sounds of their unearthly bellowing and glimpses of unimaginable horror as they move in and out of sight within the thick mist are accentuated by the haunting soundtrack provided by Lisa Gerrard. This is truly an unforgettable image that will stay with the viewer for quite some time.",4,"""Promise You Won't Let The Monsters Get Me""",1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,2631,"['Synopsis', ""'07"", 'release', 'Mist', 'unfolds', 'Lovecraftian', 'nightmare', 'come', 'alive', 'small', 'rural', 'American', 'community', 'Cloaked', 'dense', 'inexplicable', 'mist', 'town', 'collection', 'phantasmagorical', 'creatures', 'ranging', 'what', 'be', 'large', 'mutated', 'dragonflies', 'spiders', 'enormous', 'monstrosities', 'would', 'answer', 'such', 'diabolical', 'names', 'Shoggoth', 'Cthulhu', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'adapted', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'novel', 'mention', 'nefarious', 'Necronomicon', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'surely', 'blasphemous', 'occult', 'conjuring', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'top', 'secret', 'military', 'base', 'located', 'outskirts', 'town', 'released', 'other', 'dimensional', 'beings', 'world.David', 'Drayton', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'young', 'son', 'are', 'trapped', 'supermarket', 'group', 'terrified', 'town', 'residents', 'unfortunate', 'travelers', 'storefront', 'wall', 'glass', 'serving', 'only', 'protection', 'mist', 'horrors', 'await', 'Thoughts', 'emotions', 'run', 'wild', 'precarious', 'refuge', 'escape', 'denial', 'fall', 'religious', 'hysteria', 'contemplate', 'suicide', 'Only', 'brave', 'few', 'seem', 'willing', 'face', 'truth', 'plan', 'escape', 'die', 'trying.Critique', 'Mist', 'exciting', 'harrowing', 'film', 'firmly', 'held', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'look-a-like', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'solid', 'performance', 'strong', 'valiant', 'David', 'Drayton', 'who', 'forced', 'not', 'only', 'suppress', 'own', 'personal', 'fear', 'incomprehensible', 'menace', 'deal', 'mounting', 'emotional', 'onslaught', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'level-headed', 'vulnerable', 'Amanda', 'Dumfries', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'unstable', 'religious', 'zealot', 'Mrs.', 'Camody', 'negative', 'side', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'too', 'often', 'repeated', 'alien', 'incubation', 'sequence', 'was', 'great', 'Alien', 'enough', 'enough', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'subplot', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'tastes', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'spoil', 'enjoyment', 'central', 'storyline.When', 'said', 'done', 'definitely', 'Lovecraft', 'inspired', 'monsters', 'mist', 'capture', 'imagination', 'keep', 'seeing', 'minds', 'eye', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'valiant', 'few', 'drive', 'fog', 'view', 'mayhem', 'destruction', 'wrought', 'creatures', 'sounds', 'unearthly', 'bellowing', 'glimpses', 'unimaginable', 'horror', 'move', 'sight', 'thick', 'mist', 'are', 'accentuated', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'provided', 'Lisa', 'Gerrard', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'image', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'quite', 'time']",N/A
1126668,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B0010X73ZG,Brian,"[3, 3]","Actors Thomas Jane, Toby Jones, Laurie Holden and Andre Braugher all topline this moody and exceptionally well-crafted staging of one of Stephen King's most time-honored tales. Having read the short novel a great many years ago, I initially approached this film with brimming trepidation. But, thankfully, all my fears were quickly allayed. Finally, we have a horror film that isn't a remake or an assembly-line style sequel! With that said, I cannot nor will I ever fully understand the scattershot negativity this is receiving. Aside from the film's closing moments, which I quite honestly do not abhor, this sterling adaptation follows King's original story almost perfectly.We begin the movie with aspiring artist, David Drayton. He, his young son, and all his neighbors and friends soon find themselves trapped within a bustling supermarket the very day following a vicious thunderstorm that has collapsed trees and power lines throughout Castle Rock. With this natural catastrophe comes another that is not all that natural or, for that matter, hospitable. A thick impenetrable mist has engulfed the once inviting landscape, concealing nightmarish monstrosities beyond imagination that live only to maim, dismember, and murder. The frightened townspeople rally together to fend off this unearthly onslaught, completely unaware of the human monster, brilliantly portrayed by Marcia Gay Harden, who is subsequently corrupting and dividing their rapidly dwindling number from within.That colorful breakdown basically represents the main outline to King's story. Everything else, by now, has unfortunately become the widely-disputed stuff of common knowledge. Varying shades of disgruntled fans have already voiced their harsh disapproval of Director Frank Darabont's new and darker ending while others, like me, found it brilliant and altogether daring. But what should be noted is that King, himself, enthusiastically preferred the film's ending far and above his own written one. ""The Mist,"" incidentally, had been Darabont's pet-project for countless years, long before he even brought ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before cameras. It was an obvious labor of love that he meticulously addresses within the 2-Disc Collector's Edition's expansive supplementals. And that particular edition, let me just say, is a certifiable must-own! Aside from the feature film on Disc One and the diverse plethora of behind-the-scenes extras, the viewer is also treated to a complete black and white alternate transfer on Disc Two that Darabont maintains the studio discouraged him from releasing. Younger people these days, as Darabont reflects in his monologue, do not often award black and white its proper due. That may certainly remain a matter of contention for some. But for me, personally, experiencing this movie in black and white is tantamount to reliving all the classic monster movies I grew up watching every Saturday afternoon. It gives King's narrative a whole new feel and adds even more atmosphere to what was already there.I couldn't possibly be any happier with this film. It was ever so much the faithful adaptation I had long hoped it would be and proves beyond any doubt, at least to me, that Stephen King still has what it takes to illicit a genuine scare from his fans.",5,"Classy, old-school style horror!",1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,3281,"['Actors', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'topline', 'moody', 'exceptionally', 'well-crafted', 'staging', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'most', 'time-honored', 'tales', 'Having', 'read', 'short', 'novel', 'great', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'initially', 'approached', 'film', 'brimming', 'trepidation', 'thankfully', 'fears', 'were', 'quickly', 'allayed', 'Finally', 'have', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'remake', 'assembly-line', 'style', 'sequel', 'said', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'ever', 'fully', 'understand', 'scattershot', 'negativity', 'receiving', 'Aside', 'film', 'closing', 'moments', 'quite', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'abhor', 'sterling', 'adaptation', 'King', 'original', 'story', 'almost', 'perfectly.We', 'begin', 'movie', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'David', 'Drayton', 'young', 'son', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'soon', 'find', 'trapped', 'bustling', 'supermarket', 'very', 'day', 'following', 'vicious', 'thunderstorm', 'collapsed', 'trees', 'power', 'lines', 'Castle', 'Rock', 'natural', 'catastrophe', 'not', 'natural', 'matter', 'hospitable', 'thick', 'impenetrable', 'mist', 'engulfed', 'once', 'inviting', 'landscape', 'concealing', 'nightmarish', 'monstrosities', 'imagination', 'only', 'maim', 'dismember', 'murder', 'frightened', 'townspeople', 'rally', 'together', 'fend', 'off', 'unearthly', 'onslaught', 'completely', 'unaware', 'human', 'monster', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'who', 'subsequently', 'corrupting', 'dividing', 'rapidly', 'dwindling', 'number', 'within.That', 'colorful', 'breakdown', 'basically', 'main', 'outline', 'King', 'story', 'Everything', 'else', 'now', 'unfortunately', 'become', 'widely-disputed', 'stuff', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Varying', 'shades', 'disgruntled', 'fans', 'have', 'already', 'voiced', 'harsh', 'disapproval', 'Director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'new', 'darker', 'ending', 'others', 'found', 'brilliant', 'altogether', 'daring', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'King', 'enthusiastically', 'preferred', 'film', 'ending', 'far', 'own', 'written', 'one', 'Mist', 'incidentally', 'had', 'been', 'Darabont', 'pet-project', 'countless', 'years', 'long', 'even', 'brought', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'cameras', 'was', 'obvious', 'labor', 'love', 'meticulously', '2-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'expansive', 'supplementals', 'particular', 'edition', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'certifiable', 'must-own', 'Aside', 'feature', 'film', 'Disc', 'One', 'diverse', 'plethora', 'behind-the-scenes', 'extras', 'viewer', 'also', 'treated', 'complete', 'black', 'white', 'alternate', 'transfer', 'Disc', 'Two', 'Darabont', 'studio', 'discouraged', 'releasing', 'Younger', 'people', 'days', 'Darabont', 'monologue', 'do', 'not', 'often', 'award', 'black', 'white', 'proper', 'due', 'may', 'certainly', 'remain', 'matter', 'contention', 'personally', 'experiencing', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'tantamount', 'reliving', 'classic', 'monster', 'movies', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'King', 'narrative', 'whole', 'new', 'feel', 'even', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'there.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'happier', 'film', 'was', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'had', 'long', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'proves', 'doubt', 'least', 'Stephen', 'King', 'still', 'what', 'illicit', 'genuine', 'scare', 'fans']",N/A

I can't help wondering if the positive reviews are referring to the book.I've seen Scooby Doo episodes that were scarier and more dramatic.I am usually open-minded and willing to accept some flaws if there is some payoff, however, this movie only has the flaws.The characters were bland, and the ""Christian"" was so stereotyped and unreal, that by her third scene she was unwatchable. They overplayed this character big-time. Her rather large role in the movie actually wiped out what little excitement or tension or drama the movie had been able to develop. When her character was speaking, it was so unreal and annoying we were rolling our eyes and fast-forwarding through her scenes.Yes I realize this is horror fiction and is therefore unbelievable, but that does not mean it has to be stupid. There have been plenty of good horror movies that had unrealistic subjects.

Having said that, I recognize that there are times that the tomes he writes don't translate well directly to the screen. An excellent example is 1408. The screenwriter mades some changes which were genuinely excellent and seemed more ""King"" than Stephen himself.I have been keenly anticipating the movie version of The Mist since first reading the story. The short format and essentially single setting seemed perfectly suited to movie making. When I heard that Darabont was going to direct, I couldn't think of anyone better than the director of The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption. For the vast majority of the movie, it was very much as I expected. The movie was nearly a virtualization of the story, and I mean that in the BEST possible way. I was very impressed with the acting, and direction etc.And the there was the ENDING.....As I noted, I have been reading King since the start in the 70s. Unrestrictedly happy endings are just not on in Steve's world, yet basic honesty and effort are usually rewarded in King land. The original ending in The Mist was stark and uncompromising, but left open some hope and future. The group that escaped from the store did the ""right"" thing and had a future having been rewarded for thier actions. The peope who stayed in the store were never commented on again in the story but were pretty clearly lost as a result of thier lack of personal fortitude- they didn't have that ""something"" that allowed them to challenge wildly intimidating odds. In the movie, however, the ending showed that the hero and his group had, of course made all the wrong decisions. Had they stayed put, they would have done fine, been rescued, and lived happily ever after- or at least as happily ever after as you could in such a situation.The movie lost the feeling for individual achievement and integrity that are such a large part of Kings' stories. The movie ending was, depending on your viewpoint; twisted, tragic, aggrivating, inconsistent, cruel, heartbreaking, unnecessary, etc.Words I didn't hear anyone outside the theater apply to the ending? Good or Great. I can't explain better than that. Maybe there will be one of the famous ""alternate endings"" on the DVD. I sure hope so.

The acting, screenplay, sets, and special effects were great. You feel you are part of the action. You will identify with this group of people being stranded in a grocery store with only a thin plate glass window keeping the horrible creatures outside from devouring them. I know I was on the edge of my seat and found myself drawn in by the great character development. The trip of a small party to the Drugstore next door was harrowing. Each person in the store was very believable. Including the religious zealot that was drawing people to her camp for the ""End of Days"". Once her camp starts snatching people to throw to the creatures a small group lights out to find rescue. The ending is remarkable and somewhat poetic.

Also as a parent I can say it was unrealistic beyond belief. Any normal parent, no matter what the circumstances, would never do what that guy did. NEVER! I'd have sat and played tick tac toe with my son and died of dehydration in that car.open ended is fine. This ending however was one of the worst in cinema history. Downer endings need to be done so that the viewer is still left feeling satisfied. Usually protagonist characters are sacrificed in a way that lets the viewer feel it was justified under the circumstances. Even in ""The Thing"", which I can tell from the lame use of the poster in the beginning, that this film hopes to align itself with, the two characters are still alive when the film ends. Speculation can occur with us the viewers as to what happened after the credits roll. SPOILER ALTERT!!! STOP READING!!!!! Killing your own son is nonsense. I am a father with a boy right about the age of the boy in the film. I would have sat in that car till I dehydrated with my son. There is no way any normal parent, which they made this guy out to be, would ever do that. Also it was in contradiction to what they had showed us all along. No matter how wild a film it has to at least adhere to the rules it sets up for us as we watch it. The film showed us a caring father,and no caring parent would ever do what this guy did. I don't care what horrible death from some beast from another dimension might be awaiting us. A parents job on this planet is not to take the life of their children. Anyone who enjoyed this ending must not be a parent yet. And if you are a parent and you did like this ending, God help you.Also: I can not believe this film was made by the same guy who did Shawshank and Green Mile.

As a small group struggles to survive within the local grocery, they will find that the real monsters are much more human... Frank Darabont gives us a modern twist on the classic monster movie in his stunning adaptation of Stephen King's THE MIST from 2007. Darabont sets a slow and deliberate pace in a small setting with minimal score to force the characters to the forefront of the film in a big way. The cramped grocery store becomes a microcosm of the outside world, and one that harbors fierce rivalries and personal politics that turn man against man. The real terror does not come from the Lovecraftian creatures lurking in the mist, but rather from the horrors that man will bring upon himself once the veil of civilization has been lifted. Although it is a striking character drama at its roots, that does not stop THE MIST from doubling as a frightening creature feature as well! From tentacled beasts to spindly spiders, THE MIST unleashes a horde of monstrous creations with a taste for blood. Thomas Jane provides a strong lead for the other characters to stand behind, but Marcia Gay Harden stands out the most as this generation's Piper Laurie, playing the religious nut that demands blood sacrifices to appease an angry God. THE MIST also features one of the most downturn endings of all-time. Though released to theaters in color, a black and white version can be found on the special edition DVD, and offers a whole new way to experience the film as it was originally intended.

1126683,A3TKDDLMCYJKT1,B0010X73ZG,"C. Chung ""Christopher Chung""","[5, 6]","I'm a horror snob.  Not out of egotism, but out of necessity.  I was once a die-hard horror fan, but I eventually lost interest in it because it was the same old thing done ad nauseam.  Sure, names, characters, and locations were switched around, but most horror followed the same typical plot path, and I simply gave it up when nothing truly new was presented.  True, we did have some excellent films here and there, but for the most part horror followed the same tried and worn direction.  And it got old.Well, after seeing 'The Mist', I have to say, to me, it was the best horror film I've ever seen. Hands down. Without giving anything away, it was the absolute darkest, most oppressive, and most situationally horrifying movie I have personally even seen, and I afterwards I was left feeling hollow and cold, almost as if I was dead inside.  Everything crafted in the film fit almost perfectly into the dimensions it was designed, the casting and actors were excellent, and it was a masterpiece of true horror---both from within the human condition, and from beyond with the otherworldly aspects.I was also pleased how the film created the mood and atmosphere.  Aside from a few mandatory things here and there, most of the more exotic Lovecraftian Horrors lurking in the mist were left in shadow or silhouette allowing our imaginations to fill in the gaps.  Because as we all know, our own minds will create more horrifying things than what can be shown on screen with rubber, makeup, or CGI.The cast was also very convincing.  Typically I dislike any type of ""protect the kid"" situations in a movie, but in this one it worked extremely well because it was done realistically.  The emotional ranges portrayed were also excellent; from terror, anger, religious zealotry, and anguish, it all seemed real.Another hallmark worth mentioning was, there was very little score used in the film which made it even creepier---maybe about 15 minutes of music total. The rest was eerie ambient sounds or the talking and breathing of the characters. Even the end credits were mostly devoid of music, and instead, the background noises from within the film were used.  This was extremely refreshing, as it not only made it seem more realistic (after all, in real life we don't have personal soundtracks playing in the background), it also emphasized the use of our own senses to convey emotion, sound, or feeling instead of blaring trumpets or French horns telling us how to feel in a certain scene.Now, onto the inevitable question: How does it stand up with the original story?  It holds up very well.  While the film stays very close to the source material, it still brings readers of the original work (myself included) something new.Over all this is how horror should be.  This isn't clich&eacute;d ""goreno"", and it's not predicable Hollywood tripe. It's a film that completely succeeds in immersing the viewer in the mood it's trying to set, and the effect lingers long after the film ends.I only had two complaints.  The first one was the near overuse of swearing.  I'm not opposed to swearing, after all, vulgarity has become quite well ingrained in our society's speech patterns, but here it almost seemed like the big-boy words were thrown in at random in each scene.  But then again, if I was thrust into the same situations as portrayed in the film, I'd probably be dropping non-stop f-bombs as well.My second gripe may contains spoilers, so if you don't want to read it, please scroll down to where the spoilers end.  I will say, if you can, DO NOT watch the trailers if you plan on watching this film!SPOILERS!!!-------My second gripe was the terrible editing job used on the commercials and the trailers.  The scenes in which they showed the military using flamethrowers and other vehicles ruined the ending for me, because when I didn't see those scenes, I rightly suspected it was the very end.  Not cool!  (Why do commercial directors and editors think it's acceptable to put a film's ending in the previews?)  Ugh...--------SPOILERS FINISHED, REVIEW CONTINUES:So why should you buy this?  This film was a powerhouse of emotion, terror, and suspense, and it successfully reinvents the horror genre to how it should be.  It also sets the bar for all future horror films to follow.  It's not catered to the least common denominator, it's not mindless, and it's not the typical faire thrown on the screen to make a few dollars.  Long after the film ends you are left haunted by the actions---or inactions made by the various characters, and you can't help but place yourself into the same situation and wonder what you would do.This was a genuine work of art that not only takes a bold new direction to film, but it also takes some huge chances, as those who have seen the film will know.Highly recommended.",5,How horror

However, as a color film, it resonates solely as a newly made great b movie. In the black and white version, located on disc 2, the film is absolutely stunning. Stunning in its imagery, which literally pops out in black and white, and stunning in its implications. What adapter/director, Frank Darabont has done here is completely transform his film from a drive in (type of) film, to a piece of art that contrasts dark shadows with the light showing through the Mist. In color, the people in the supermarket come across as regular people that one needs to look through their fascades to see the real people underneath. Though in black and white, within these two colors, within these two extremes, one can not help but watch as the two camps in the supermarket form in not only a highly literal, but also a theatrical way. It's clear in black and white that these characters are not just people, but archtypes for the human condition and in my opinion, the film benefits immensely from not only seeing the horror in black and white, but also feeling the horror, sometimes as bleak as possible.The ending reminded me of other powerful films, like ""The Rapture.""The two disc dvd version is the only way to go with this release.

1126688,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B0010X73ZG,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[3, 4]","In the 1970s I saw a book on the shelf at the local drugstore. It had a fascinating black cover, embossed with the face of a child with fangs. I asked my mother to purchase it, and that evening started reading Stephen King'sSALEM'S LOT. I was soon consuming each King book immediately after publication - ""The Shining,"" ""The Dead Zone,"" ""The Stand.""If nothing else, King was prolific (the man loves to write). I fell behind his massive publications, branching off to new authors and genres, some inspired by King's fine nonfiction workStephen King's Danse Macabre. Somewhere along the way, King wrote the novella ""The Mist,"" which director Frank Darabont made into a film this past year. Television previews were horrible, resembling a low-budget variation of John Carpenter's near-classic horror taleThe Fog (Special Edition)(1980), which had a notoriously poor remake itself in 2005.I have been beaten down over the years by increasingly degenerate horror films, breeding a level of cynicism for the genre I love. I felt exploited by the remakes of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes. ""Saw"" was unusually offensive. Each film spawned sequels of decreasing quality.I picked up the DVD case to ""The Mist"" at the rental store. I was surprised it was directed by Darabont, whoseThe Shawshank Redemption (Single Disc Edition)and ""The Green Mile"" were respectable, if not extraordinary, works. He was a talent with an established track record, unusual for today's horror offerings. Sold by his name (rather than King's), I rented the film with the hope of quality and cheap thrills.Much to my shock, I discovered one of the great horror films of the modern era, complete with crisp dialogue, tense atmosphere and earnest peformances by recognizable character actors. Arguably, it's one of the great monster movies of all time, with the horror deriving from human characters turning on one another as the apocalyptic tension increases.Several aspects of ""The Mist"" will remind viewers of Alfred Hitchcock'sThe Birds (Collector's Edition)(1963) and George Romero'sNight of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)(1968), or for those versed in ""The Twilight Zone,"" the 1960 episode ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street."" You have characters from different cultural backgrounds thrown together against an unknown menace. Birds, zombies or slithering creatures, no matter, the fascination of these films is how humans react to having their worlds permanently changed within a matter of minutes.I suppose the key to any monster film is the monster. Steven Spielberg'sJaws (30th Anniversary Edition)(1975) set a standard by not showing the creature until more than one hour into the film.Curse of the Demon / Night of the Demon(1957) had the audacity to not reveal the monster until the final scene. But this is the modern world, and Darabont is forced to reveal pieces of his creatures as ""The Mist"" progresses. When they do make an appearance, they are not creatures we have seen before. They fly, bite, swarm and slither. Some are big. Once the monsters are shown, specifically one evening as they crash into the store windows, the suspense remains. Like cockroaches, these creatures move too fast for comfort, and so dangerous that there is little hope.Following an especially violent thunderstorm, a mist pours into a small Maine town and a father and son find themselves trapped with 30-40 people at the local grocery store. Preceded by the terrifying wail of an emergency siren, the fog surrounds the store as a resident, covered in blood, rushes past the glass doors announcing ""There's something in the mist!"" Cell phones stop working, the electricity goes out and the trapped survivors, noshing on the store's potato chips and sports drinks, stare at the mist in frozen silence.Thomas Jane plays the father David Drayton, a local artist hunk who attempts to keep the residents calm while caring for his terrified son. Drayton's not a native, plus he's fairly well-to-do, and as the hours grind on he uncomfortably realizes that the locals are rallying around Bible-thumper Mrs. Carmody (Oscar-winner Marcia Gay Harden, in grand saliva-spitting form). In Jim Jones tradition, she announces the apocalypse, and the need to appease the Gods with sacrifice. Drayton's son is blonde and innocent and, well, it doesn't take Einstein to figure out who might be the first offering.Over the course of an agonizing hour, characters are established, tentacles slither through a loading dock, and an especially brave Hells Angels-type volunteers to walk into the mist with a rope around his waist. While I will not reveal his outcome, the screams of the store's inhabitants are traumatic and real. Multiple times I found myself imagining what I would do if trapped in the same situation. The brilliance of ""The Mist,"" and I believe this was intentional strategy by Darabont (who also wrote the screenplay), is the choices made were exactly what I considered.There's multiple American analogies one can apply to ""The Mist,"" as it dabbles in race and religious prejudices and lynch mob mentality. The Lovecraftian creepy crawlies throw everyone into a state of rabid panic and there's a genuine feeling of doom pervading the drama as it takes onLord of the Flies (50th Anniversary Edition)dynamics.As the final action unfolds, Drayton is forced to make a unimaginably difficult decision. Viewers will find themselves wondering if they could have committed the same act, a choice that will provoke conversation long after the haunting final credits.Mr. King's imagination has once again captured mine, and I've been reminded of an old, childhood friend, as comfortable as a black and white Rod Serling. Welcome back Mr. King, and thank you Mr. Darabont for having the bravery to fulfill a thoughtfully nightmarish vision.",5,Thoughtfully nightmarish....,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,5823,"['1970s',

Gibbs ""Horror Soundtrack Collector""","[0, 0]","I've read Stephen Kings Novella 'The Mist' several times since grade school in the 80's and it has always been a favorite.  When I heard that it was going to be a full length film, I was fairly skeptical.  Being that it was written decades ago, I figured the movie would be bogged down with modern day tie-ins replacing good old fashioned character suspense.  I was wrong.First off, the acting and the actors/actresses chosen were phenomenal.  While no one will be winning any awards from this movie, they are all very honest and believeable and their lines come straight from the story, which is generally a rare thing these days.  The special effects were well done and the gore was never too much.  But it was the continous tension that drove the movie to an extremely intense, yet morbid ending.I won't tell the story, I'll just say this:  the characters, their actions, reactions and motivations carry the film from start to finish.  The science-fiction aspect is more of a back-drop than anything, but it's pretty damned good in comparison to other King adaptations.  The way I envisioned this story every time I read it, was exactly as it appeared on screen....except for the end that is.  The ending was not bad by any means, but I think it will leave a jaw-dropping, awe-struck silence among the many who expect something more cheerful.It's not hard to believe that the fellas who brought Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile to the screen were behind this movie.  It shines as brightly as those movies when it comes to King adaptations, but it's the subject matter which puts a dark spin on it.

1126692,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0010X73ZG,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","A lot of horror films lately have fell into 2 categories: the so-called ""gorno"" type films where the film contains some of the more vile and disgusting imagery this side of Cannibal Holocaust while the other believes by putting in a whole bunch of scenes that make audiences jump and preferably has a creepy kid. The faults are of course gore disgusts, doesn't scare and having a bunch of scenes that make people jump out of their seat doesn't stay with you long enough to get under your skin. ""The Mist"", directed by Frank Darabont, at least approaches a horror movie by filling the film with tension and unease; it's just too bad it makes some faults with other things as well.Artist David Drayden is heading to the store to pick up some supplies after a particularly violent storm and a strange mist coming from the mountains. Just thinking it's routine, it turns even more strange when the mist rolls into town, blanketing everything and one citizen screams of things within it. While some are skeptical, others see proof that they are essentially trapped by the things that lurk on the outside as well as threatened by those that are in the inside, but not monsters necessarily but people.One of the hardest things to accomplish in a film, especially in the horror genre, is to have characters people watching will care about so that when they go, a feeling of sadness comes. The Mist strives for this in scenes where we get to know some of them but a lot of them are written so one-dimensionally or lacking that it's hard to feel anything for them since there's just not a lot for them to do. Then there's some dumb decisions and illogical choices that it's hard to take what they do and feel something from it. One character I thought worked well, which was Toby Jones as grocery store bagger Ollie while the one that got the most attention (though I didn't care for her) was Mrs. Carmody played by Marcia Gay Hayden who portrays her with such frequent Bible-talk that you feel if any comeuppance should come to her, it's simply because she's annoying and not what she's saying or represents.As a horror film, does it succeed? Well it does to a certain extent since there is some scenes of attacks and bug-related goodness and the servicable-but-not-stellar effect work gets you going but the emphasis on the human characters unhinged and without authority restraints doesn't give it as much creepiness but then there's some scenes like a pharmacy visit that work exceedingly well. As far as the ending is concerned, it's one where emotionally it might watch the feel of the film but doesn't really connect for some reason, either the overbearing music or acting but some feel it's the right kind of ending for this film or it's either too depressing and the ending worked or you didn't like it because of what it did.In many ways the Mist reminds me of a music band that is very musically accomplished but has a terrible singer. You could have things that work well (the direction, tone) but there's always that nagging thing that you can either forgive and keep listening or can't get past that one thing that brings it down.",4,More a welcome than a triumph,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,3134,"['lot', 'horror', 'films', 'lately', 'have', 'fell', '2', 'categories', 'so-called', 'gorno', 'type', 'films', 'where', 'film', 'more', 'vile', 'disgusting', 'imagery', 'side', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'other', 'putting', 'whole', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'make', 'audiences', 'jump', 'preferably', 'creepy', 'kid', 'faults', 'are', 'course', 'gore', 'disgusts', ""n't"", 'scare', 'having', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'make', 'people', 'jump', 'seat', ""n't"", 'stay', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'skin', 'Mist', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'least', 'approaches', 'horror', 'movie', 'filling', 'film', 'tension', 'unease', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'faults', 'other', 'things', 'well.Artist', 'David', 'Drayden', 'heading', 'store', 'pick', 'up', 'supplies', 'particularly', 'violent', 'storm', 'strange', 'mist', 'coming', 'mountains', 'Just', 'thinking', 'routine', 'even', 'more', 'strange', 'when', 'mist', 'rolls', 'town', 'blanketing', 'everything', 'one', 'citizen', 'screams', 'things', 'are', 'skeptical', 'others', 'see', 'proof', 'are', 'essentially', 'trapped', 'things', 'lurk', 'outside', 'as', 'well', 'threatened', 'are', 'inside', 'not', 'monsters', 'necessarily', 'people.One', 'hardest', 'things', 'accomplish', 'film', 'especially', 'horror', 'genre', 'have', 'characters', 'people', 'watching', 'will', 'care', 'so', 'when', 'go', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'Mist', 'strives', 'scenes', 'where', 'get', 'know', 'lot', 'are', 'written', 'so', 'one-dimensionally', 'lacking', 'hard', 'feel', 'anything', 'just', 'not', 'lot', 'do', 'Then', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'illogical', 'choices', 'hard', 'take', 'what', 'do', 'feel', 'something', 'One', 'character', 'thought', 'worked', 'well', 'was', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'grocery', 'store', 'bagger', 'Ollie', 'one', 'got', 'most', 'attention', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Hayden', 'who', 'such', 'frequent', 'Bible-talk', 'feel', 'comeuppance', 'should', 'come', 'simply', 'annoying', 'not', 'what', 'saying', 'represents.As', 'horror', 'film', 'succeed', 'Well', 'certain', 'extent', 'scenes', 'attacks', 'bug-related', 'goodness', 'servicable-but-not-stellar', 'effect', 'work', 'going', 'emphasis', 'human', 'characters', 'unhinged', 'authority', 'restraints', ""n't"", 'give', 'as', 'much', 'creepiness', 'then', 'scenes', 'pharmacy', 'visit', 'work', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'As', 'far', 'ending', 'concerned', 'one', 'where', 'emotionally', 'might', 'watch', 'feel', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'connect', 'reason', 'overbearing', 'music', 'acting', 'feel', 'right', 'kind', 'ending', 'film', 'too', 'depressing', 'ending', 'worked', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'did.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Mist', 'music', 'band', 'very', 'musically', 'accomplished', 'terrible', 'singer', 'could', 'have', 'things', 'work', 'well', 'direction', 'tone', 'always', 'nagging', 'thing', 'can', 'either', 'forgive', 'keep', 'listening', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'down']",N/A

For the MOST part it exceeds in creating an atmosphere of paranoia with the resultant skewed judgement of several key characters. I've watched BOTH the color and the black-and-white versions. I prefer the BNW because it sorta captures the ""essence"" of old Twilight Zone and Outer Limits TV shows pretty accurately (not necessarily the ""age"" but more the ""low budget enthusiasm""). The special effects are MOSTLY subdued (which is KEY) with the exception of the first ""tentacle"" scene which is pretty cheesy. The black-and-white version subdues this part of the film to an ALMOST acceptable level. Marcia Gay Harden puts on a ""tour-de-force"" as a religious zealot and the other characters are pretty well portrayed. My MAIN beef is with the ending. I guess Darabont was looking for something ""deeper and more emotionally profound"". I thought the short story (as King had written it) left us with an uneasy feeling of dread and uncertainess that was even more compelling. IN FACT...I can picture a scene (near the end of Darabont's cut) when the movie SHOULD have ended. I wish an ""alternate ending"" had been supplied with the DVD. If I had never read the short story I probably would have admired the ironic twist at the end. NEVERTHELESS...it is a good enough flick for admirers of ""low-budget"" sci-fi/horror to enjoy repeated viewings. 3.75 stars.

1126695,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0010X73ZG,Cubist,"[8, 10]","Filmmaker Frank Darabont has a real affinity for Stephen King's stories having previously adapted two of the author's non-horror tales (The Shawshank Redemption (Two-Disc Special Edition)andThe Green Mile (Two-Disc Special Edition)) and with his latest film he tackles another King story, The Mist, which comes fromSkeleton Crew (Signet)collection of short stories. Darabont's film thankfully flies in the face of the two prevailing trends of gruesome torture porn horror films and lame J-horror remakes to deliver old school scares for a truly satisfying horror film.Darabont does an excellent job establishing the characters, the dilemma they all face, and then pitting them against each other. Some critics had problems with the shrill, Bible-thumping character of Mrs. Carmody as being an easy caricature; however, by the end of the film, all of the things she has said come true. As anyone who has read any of Stephen King's fiction or seen one of his adaptations knows, a recurring motif is how the internal squabbling of a large group of people is as much of a threat as the horror that threatens them. King shows how fragile the trappings of society are and how it only takes one thing to trigger its collapse.What is so refreshing about The Mist is how flawed the characters are as represented by David, a movie poster artist and the film's hero. He gets scared and makes mistakes but rises to the occasion when needed. Is he any less of a hero for doing what he does in the film? Darabont raises some fascinating questions about the notion of heroics and this is nicely realized by Thomas Jane's wonderfully layered performance. The filmmaker has created a clever, tension-filled apocalyptic monster movie that has the balls to go out on such a daring sucker-punch of an ending that really ticked off some fans of the original novella. Darabont's film remains true to the spirit and vibe of King's story despite the radical reworking of the ending.The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont. He spends the bulk of the track pointing out how he cut costs on this modestly budgeted film and gives credit to the crew members who helped him make it, in particular, the effects people. Darabont goes into the nuts and bolts of filmmaking but the highlight is his explanation/justification of the film's controversial ending. As always, he delivers thoughtful observations and imparts loads of information.Also included are eight deleted scenes with optional commentary by Darabont. One scene provides an interesting bit of insight into Brent's character. There is more of David and Ollie trying to convince the others early on about the outside threat. Also included is more of Mrs. Carmody's religious ramblings.""Drew Struzan: An Appreciation of an Artist"" is a profile of this prolific movie poster artist. He has done some of the most memorable posters of all time, including ones for the Star Wars films, E.T. (1982), Blade Runner (1982), and the Indiana Jones films to name but a few. Darabont points out that the introduction of David working in his studio in the film is a tribute to Struzan.There are three Webisodes hosted by Darabont that provide a behind-the-scenes look at three scenes in the film and show what it looks like on the set juxtaposed with final product. We get to see how they did various practical effects in these scenes.Also included are three trailers.The second disc features a black and white version of the film that Darabont claims, in his introduction to it, is his preferred version because it was intended as an homage to classic horror films of the mid-1960s.""When Darkness Came: The Making of The Mist"" takes a look at the origins of the film. Stephen King sings Darabont's praises and talks about how he trusted the filmmaker with the material. There is plenty of on the set footage where we see the cast and crew in action. None of the major studios wanted to do it but Bob Weinstein gave it the greenlight so long as Darabont agreed to do it cheaply and in very little time. This is an excellent look at how this film came together.""Taming the Beast: Shooting Scene 35"" takes a look at the scene where the mutant bugs and birds invade the supermarket. It's the most action-packed scene in the film and was a challenge to shoot and coordinate because it involved a tricky combination practical and digital effects, lots of extras, and stunts.""Monsters Among Us: A Look at the Creature FX"" examines the designs for the various creatures in the film. He employed effects legend Greg Nicotero and illustrator extraordinaire Bernie Wrightson to design them and make them exotic-looking yet realistic enough so it seemed like they could really exist. It was a mix of CGI and practical mechanical creatures and puppetry.Finally, there is ""The Horror of It All: The Visual FX of The Mist"" which takes a look at Caf&eacute; FX's work on the film's visual effects. Their main guy used to do prosthetic effects and so he had an idea of what would be practical and what would be CGI. His company had very little time and we see the various stages of the effects. We also see how various effects shots in the film were achieved.",5,2-Disc Collector's Edition is the Way to Go!,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,5197,"['Filmmaker', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'real',

1126696,A3ANTB0VV4W0TA,B0010X73ZG,"Dale Albrecht ""He will live badly who does no...","[5, 11]","This review will contain spoilers.The Mist is a so-so monster movie that yearns to be more, tries to force itself into being something more and fails miserably.The movie works 'ok' when it's just about people being trapped in a supermarket and being preyed upon by creepy unseen creatures in the mist.  The creatures are obviously CGI and do deliver some gruesome kills but they are never particularly scary; the best of the bunch are the ones we never get a good look at and can only guess at their monstrosity from their vague outlines in the mist (go figure: leaving something to the imagination).What really bothered me about this movie was the 'drama'.  It never really rung true to me.  Sure, the local religious nut who thinks the mist is the coming of the end-times was believable, but having twenty other people become her 'followers' demanding a child's blood sacrifice after a COUPLE OF DAYS?  Unbelievable even for a cynic like me.  I know people tend to mob-up and do irrational things when hard times hit but these characters just hadn't gone through enough to justify their actions.Likewise, I feel the same about the much-reviled ending.  Essentially, 5 people escape the supermarket with 4 bullets left in their gun.  They drive 300 miles and they see monsters, mass destruction, and an apocalyptic landscape.  They run out of gas and within 5 minutes decide to off themselves.  The gunman, the lone survivor, then stumbles out of the truck only to discover that the army was not five minutes away - oh the humanity.While the ending is brutal, it's totally unjustified and almost seems like a tacked on finale.  Who are these losers who give up so easily?  Sure, it's the end of the world, but wouldn't you rather go out swinging, yelling and screaming?  Not these characters: they pack it in when they run out of gas - WOW.If anything can be said about human nature it is that people will go to great lengths to survive.  I just read The Terror by Dan Simmons which is about 105 men stuck in the ice at the North Pole for two years while being stalked by a monster.  These guys suffer: scurvy, lost limbs, starvation, cannibalism, but they continue on simply because of their will to survive.  The ending of the original novella was bleak but offered up the solace of ""well, there is always hope"".  Not much I guess, but way better than the movie which seems to say, ""better to kill yourself than live through another day of suffering and the chance to...live another day.""Quick gripes that really incriminate the filmmakers for being sloppy and obvious with their storytelling:-Dead can Dance song at the end; melodramatic and jarring-Characters standing around telling the audience about humannature; please just show us-Did the guy's wife really have to be all webbed-up on the frontporch?

People terrify me; human fraility scares the crap out of me.  Which is why ""The Mist"" has long been one of my favorite King novellas: sure, it's a monster tale, but the REAL monsters in the story aren't the ones out in the mist--they're the ones inside the store.  In some cases they are obvious; in others, not.When I first saw ""The Mist,"" I thought it was a good B-movie, with a classic ending (truly one of the best in horror cinema).  I was disturbed more so than usual, but not absolutely floored.  But I thought about it.  And thought about it.  It's been almost a year since I first saw it; I recently watched it a second time (in black and white this time, btw).  And I was terrified.  The special effects are pretty good, though at times they get in the way of the actors.  Let me stress that--the actors, here, are the true stars, not the special effects.  Thomas Jane is phenomenal; Marcia Gay Harden is chilling.  Frank Darabont does a brilliant job of bringing King's tale to the screen (even King himself has stated he wished he'd thought of this ending).The story, for what it's worth, centers around a group of people trapped inside a convenience store.  Outside the plate-glass windows is...the mist.  The mist and the deadly, flesh-eating creatures that lurk in it.  The real story of the movie, the real meat (and the real scary stuff), is what happens to the people trapped inside the store--how they cope with it, to who and what they turn to for comfort.  This is a film that tackles the topic of what would happen when ordinary citizens encounter something truly alien--not something we're halfway familiar with, but something completely outside our capabilities for rationalization.  What WOULD happen if strange beings appeared from practically nowhere and began eating your loved ones?  How would that affect the human psyche?That's what King's tale tried to explain; Darabont's film follows suit.  It is a haunting, subtle film that will stay with you long after it's over, thanks in part to (what I consider to be, at least) one of the greatest horror movie endings ever.  You should also, if given the chance (which thank God you are, on the two-disc edition), watch the film in black & white.  The effects come off as a little cheesier...but that's half the fun.  Because, with a film this dark and disturbing, we'll take the fun wherever we can find it.",5,A fantastic and truly terrifying horror film.,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,2524,"['When', 'scary', 'movies', 'monsters', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Vampires', 'werewolves', 'alien', 'beings', 'are', 'entertaining', 'not', 'scary', 'People', 'human', 'fraility', 'crap', 'Which', 'why', 'Mist', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'King', 'novellas', 'sure', 'monster', 'tale', 'REAL', 'monsters', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'ones', 'out', 'mist', ""'re"", 'ones', 'store', 'cases', 'are', 'obvious', 'others', 'not.When', 'first', 'saw', 'Mist', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'B-movie', 'classic', 'ending', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'cinema', 'was', 'disturbed', 'more', 'so', 'usual', 'not', 'absolutely', 'floored', 'thought', 'thought', 'been', 'almost', 'year', 'first', 'saw', 'recently', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'black', 'white', 'time', 'btw', 'was', 'terrified', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'though', 'times', 'get', 'way', 'actors', 'Let', 'stress', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'true', 'stars', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'phenomenal', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'chilling', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'brilliant', 'job', 'bringing', 'King', 'tale', 'screen', 'even', 'King', 'stated', 'wished', ""'d"", 'thought', 'ending', '.The', 'story', 'what', 'worth', 'centers', 'group', 'people', 'trapped', 'convenience', 'store', 'plate-glass', 'windows', 'mist', 'mist', 'deadly', 'flesh-eating', 'creatures', 'lurk', 'real', 'story', 'movie', 'real', 'meat', 'real', 'scary', 'stuff', 'what', 'people', 'trapped', 'store', 'how', 'cope', 'who', 'what', 'turn', 'comfort', 'film', 'topic', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'when', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'encounter', 'something', 'truly', 'alien', 'not', 'something', ""'re"", 'halfway', 'familiar', 'something', 'completely', 'capabilities', 'rationalization', 'What', 'WOULD', 'happen', 'strange', 'beings', 'appeared', 'practically', 'nowhere', 'began', 'eating', 'loved', 'ones', 'How', 'would', 'affect', 'human', 'psyche', 'what', 'King', 'tale', 'tried', 'explain', 'Darabont', 'film', 'suit', 'haunting', 'subtle', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'over', 'thanks', 'part', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'movie', 'endings', 'ever', 'should', 'also', 'given', 'chance', 'thank', 'God', 'are', 'two-disc', 'edition', 'watch', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'effects', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'cheesier', 'fun', 'film', 'dark', 'disturbing', ""'ll"", 'take', 'fun', 'can', 'find']",N/A

1126704,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0010X73ZG,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","""The Mist"" represents yet another Stephen King piece of literary for Frank Darabont to grab his hands on and try giving it the cinematic magic.  While the film is not at caliber of Darabont's past adapted films, nor is it among the greater films this year, but it's certainly good at what it intends to be.  The film is the case where everything goes wrong and everyone tries to cope with the danger that's fogging (literally) the outside world with mixed results.After a terrible thunderstorm, David Drayton and his son thought they have survived the wrath of Mother Nature.  When David and his son goes to the supermarket to get some supplies, things get out of control when a thick mist surrounds the streets after a wounded person tells the people to close the supermarket doors.  Not long, David knows there's something dangerous within the mist, so for the course of the movie he's stuck w/ a religious extremist, a woman who looks like Amy Smart but isn't, some military guys and mostly non-believers that will eventually become cannon fodder.  Things don't seem to look good for the locals of Silent Hill (yea, I know it doesn't take place in Silent Hill, but judging by the thick fog, the location and the inclusion of a crazy God lady, the movie might as well took place in that desolate town).""The Mist"" is not essentially a horror film, and if so, the film certain falters.  There's too much moments of comfort so the scare factor was low, the build-ups leading to the kills are rather predictable, and some people are just too ""durn"" ignorant to easily get away from the creatures. What's more distracting is the monsters have a way of sticking out like a sore thumb, thanks to its bland CG design.  I like them better when the sight of them is blurred by the mist, but when they're up close and seeing how fake they look, it pushed me away from the connection I have with the film.  At least the film did a good job of rarely using the soundtrack for the sake of ambience, but that doesn't ignore its by-the-book conventions, although that's not what the film is emphasizing.What really made this film sell is its character study.  The monsters that appear are few and far between, so it's all about the townspeople stuck in the supermarket and seeing' their fear of the unknown eventually succumb to their primitive nature; what the movie is really about is humans fighting against themselves.  The concept is rather been-there-done-that, but ""The Mist"" does it so effectively.  William Sadler's character goes from being a rough-and-touch mechanic to being spineless from the sight of the monsters to becoming obsessed with the praises of an extremely-devoted nut-case that is Ms. Carmody, and the transitions are rather believable.  On the subject of Ms. Carmody, Marcia Gay Harden does an incredible job of making me hate her character as she tries to preach to the survivors that what's going on is God's wrath against humanity and ultimately form a cult that does human sacrifices like they're Mayans.  For a woman who's deeply blessed, though, I'm surprised by how much she swears; I don't think her God would appreciate that.What I like most about the study is not even the main character is completely sane.  Sure, Ms. Carmody and her followers are downright loony, but it's tough to see David trying to maintain composure while protecting his son and trying to figure out how to escape from the mist with some of the less-crazy people in the market.  His character is definitely well-developed and so were a few characters that I find likeable, such as the gun-toting stork clerk who did something later in the film that mad me literally applaud him.  Too bad some of the other characters are underutilized, especially the young military fellow and the female store clerk who had a moment of desire before their fates are sealed.  The foreshadowing is so obvious and the end result is pathetic, I wonder why the director even bothers using that sub-plot?I must admit, I was bored out of my mind for maybe under the first-third of the film, but then I just noticed that I was starting to get into it.  Cast aside the thought that the movie might've ripped off a few invasion films and how the creatures never tried breaking through the windows to get their meal instead of waiting for the humans to come to them, when it gets to the heart of the cast, that's when ""The Mist"" becomes a solid drama story in a horror-setting.  The whole notion of primal lunacy sets the comparison between Ms. Carmody and David Drayton, and I knew that from the shocking ending that they may have differences, but when it comes to being in a hopeless situation, both have made some desperate choices that will ultimately affect them for the rest of their lives.  That moment left me feeling devastated by the time the movie's over, and I hardly felt that for most films of its kind.",4,"Fear, Desperation, & Low Visibility",1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,4886,"['Mist', 'yet', 'Stephen', 'King', 'piece', 'literary', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'grab', 'hands', 'try', 'giving', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'film', 'not', 'caliber', 'Darabont', 'past', 'adapted', 'films', 'greater', 'films', 'year', 'certainly', 'good', 'what', 'be', 'film', 'case', 'where', 'everything', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'tries', 'cope', 'danger', 'fogging', 'literally', 'outside', 'world', 'mixed', 'results.After', 'terrible', 'thunderstorm', 'David', 'Drayton', 'son', 'thought', 'have', 'survived', 'wrath', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'When', 'David', 'son', 'supermarket', 'get', 'supplies', 'things', 'get', 'control', 'when', 'thick', 'mist', 'streets', 'wounded', 'person', 'people', 'close', 'supermarket', 'doors', 'Not', 'long', 'David', 'something', 'dangerous', 'mist', 'so', 'course', 'movie', 'stuck', 'w/', 'religious', 'extremist', 'woman', 'who', 'Amy', 'Smart', ""n't"", 'military', 'guys', 'mostly', 'non-believers', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'look', 'good', 'locals', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'yea', 'know', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'judging', 'thick', 'fog', 'location', 'inclusion', 'crazy', 'God', 'lady', 'movie', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'took', 'place', 'desolate', 'town', 'Mist', 'not', 'essentially', 'horror', 'film', 'so', 'film', 'certain', 'falters', 'too', 'much', 'moments', 'comfort', 'scare', 'factor', 'was', 'low', 'build-ups', 'leading', 'kills', 'are', 'rather', 'predictable', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'durn', 'ignorant', 'easily', 'get', 'away', 'creatures', 'What', 'more', 'distracting', 'monsters', 'have', 'way', 'sticking', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'thanks', 'bland', 'CG', 'design', 'like', 'better', 'when', 'sight', 'blurred', 'mist', 'when', ""'re"", 'up', 'close', 'seeing', 'how', 'fake', 'look', 'pushed', 'away', 'connection', 'have', 'film', 'least', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'rarely', 'using', 'soundtrack', 'sake', 'ambience', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'by-the-book', 'conventions', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'sell', 'character', 'study', 'monsters', 'appear', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'townspeople', 'stuck', 'supermarket', 'seeing', 'fear', 'unknown', 'eventually', 'succumb', 'primitive', 'nature', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'humans', 'fighting', 'concept', 'rather', 'been-there-done-that', 'Mist', 'so', 'effectively', 'William', 'Sadler', 'character', 'being', 'rough-and-touch', 'mechanic', 'being', 'spineless', 'sight', 'monsters', 'becoming', 'obsessed', 'praises', 'extremely-devoted', 'nut-case', 'Ms.', 'Carmody', 'transitions', 'are', 'rather', 'believable', 'subject', 'Ms.', 'Carmody', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'incredible', 'job', 'making', 'hate', 'character', 'preach', 'survivors', 'what', 'going', 'God', 'wrath', 'humanity', 'ultimately', 'form', 'cult', 'human', 'sacrifices', ""'re"", 'Mayans', 'woman', 'who', 'deeply', 'blessed', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'God', 'would', 'appreciate', 'like', 'most', 'study', 'not', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'completely', 'sane', 'Sure', 'Ms.', 'Carmody', 'followers', 'are', 'downright', 'loony', 'tough', 'see', 'David', 'trying', 'maintain', 'composure', 'protecting', 'son', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'escape', 'mist', 'less-crazy', 'people', 'market', 'character', 'definitely', 'well-developed', 'so', 'were', 'few', 'characters', 'find', 'likeable', 'such', 'gun-toting', 'stork', 'clerk', 'who', 'did', 'something', 'later', 'film', 'literally', 'applaud', 'Too', 'bad', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'underutilized', 'especially', 'young', 'military', 'fellow', 'female', 'store', 'clerk', 'who', 'had', 'moment', 'desire', 'fates', 'are', 'sealed', 'foreshadowing', 'so', 'obvious', 'end', 'result', 'pathetic', 'wonder', 'why', 'director', 'even', 'bothers', 'using', 'sub-plot', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'bored', 'mind', 'maybe', 'first-third', 'film', 'then', 'just', 'noticed', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'Cast', 'thought', 'movie', 'might', ""'ve"", 'ripped', 'off', 'few', 'invasion', 'films', 'how', 'creatures', 'never', 'tried', 'breaking', 'windows', 'get', 'meal', 'instead', 'waiting', 'humans', 'come', 'when', 'heart', 'cast', 'when', 'Mist', 'solid', 'drama', 'story', 'horror-setting', 'whole', 'notion', 'primal', 'lunacy', 'comparison', 'Ms.', 'Carmody', 'David', 'Drayton', 'knew', 'shocking', 'ending', 'may', 'have', 'differences', 'when', 'being', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'have', 'made', 'desperate', 'choices', 'will', 'ultimately', 'affect', 'rest', 'lives', 'moment', 'left', 'feeling', 'devastated', 'time', 'movie', 'hardly', 'felt', 'most', 'films', 'kind']",N/A

Two, he could have gone for a totally nihlistic, ""everybody dies"" ending, which I would have prefered.  Three, he could have gone for a sappy, happy Hollywood ending, which would have been, at least, expected.

I had hoped for a different ending, where everone does not get shot, but I have to admit, it added extra terror and sympathy for the lead character. I enjoyed the scene where the big creature crosses in front of the car. I realize the CGI was not touted to be particularly advanced but that scene actually had an existential feel to it. The combination of the creature's sounds and the awe at its might, was effective.Overall the acting was very exaggerated, but I wonder if the film makers didn't intend it be a little tongue in cheek. I'll need to watch the extras to find out.

1126710,A3D2AIP1XQAZTZ,B0010X73ZG,Disco,"[9, 19]","Based on many other reviews, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great.  But given Frank Darabont's near-perfect impressions of Shawshank and Green Mile, I figured I should at least give it a shot.  Turns out I was unprepared for what is truly an awful Stephen King adaptation.To be fair, making a good horror film is difficult.  It's even harder to make a good horror film based on a book that was so lovingly-crafted.  The book is full of such vivid people, monsters, and events, that your imagination will sculpt images no film can possibly re-create.  And the sheer terror and suspense with which King describes the coming of the mist and particularly the ill-fated expedition to the pharmacy simply do not lend themselves to the film medium.  That isn't to say that Darabont couldn't have done worlds better, but ultimately, this is a movie that just should not have been made.Many people will say that King is simply bizarre or weird or will use some other pejorative.  That is naive.  There is a heart and warmth to his writing that was captured so well by the Shawshank and Green Mile films.  This film has none of that.Most offensive to me was the ending, and for multiple reasons.  First, it is badly shocking.  Darabont even admits in the commentary that it is partly for shock value.  I don't claim to be a Stephen King expert, but I've read a good 10-15 of his books, and this is one ending I can tell you he would never write.  Yes, the end scenario is alluded to within the book.  But from what I know about David Drayton, I would assert that he is incapable of such an act.  Second, Stanley Kubrick took some big liberties with The Shining, but where he transformed the original King story into a strong work of film that can stand alone, Darabont butchered the original text with his overuse of artistic license.  King outwardly claims to have ""liked"" the ending, but I wonder what he really thought.  I will admit that the book's ending would not work in a movie.  But that is just another reason this story should have been left alone.There were things I enjoyed.  I thought the monsters were tremendous.  Their appearances were not far from what I imagined whilst reading the book.  Credit must be given to the special effects team.  However, it seems that special effects are what Hollywood really excels at these days, so good monsters are to be expected.We know that Frank Darabont is capable of directing moving, worthwhile films.  He must have seen that The Mist would be a dud.  Why in the world would he choose to go through with it?  The DVD extras explain that the budget was indeed meager.  And why did Paramount Pictures back out?  Dimension Films wound up being the studio, a company that brought us such forgettable dreck as the Scream trilogy and all eight incarnations of Hellraiser.  This movie is definitely their cup of tea.",1,Read the book instead,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,2863,"['Based', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'great', 'given', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'near-perfect', 'impressions', 'Shawshank', 'Green', 'Mile', 'figured', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'shot', 'out', 'was', 'unprepared', 'what', 'truly', 'awful', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptation.To', 'be', 'fair', 'making', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'difficult', 'even', 'harder', 'make', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'lovingly-crafted', 'book', 'full', 'such', 'vivid', 'people', 'monsters', 'events', 'imagination', 'will', 'sculpt', 'images', 'film', 'can', 'possibly', 're-create', 'sheer', 'terror', 'suspense', 'King', 'coming', 'mist', 'particularly', 'ill-fated', 'expedition', 'pharmacy', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'lend', 'film', 'medium', ""n't"", 'say', 'Darabont', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'worlds', 'better', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'just', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made.Many', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'King', 'simply', 'bizarre', 'weird', 'will', 'use', 'other', 'pejorative', 'naive', 'heart', 'warmth', 'writing', 'was', 'captured', 'so', 'well', 'Shawshank', 'Green', 'Mile', 'films', 'film', 'none', 'that.Most', 'offensive', 'was', 'ending', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'First', 'badly', 'shocking', 'Darabont', 'even', 'commentary', 'partly', 'shock', 'value', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'Stephen', 'King', 'expert', ""'ve"", 'read', 'good', '10-15', 'books', 'one', 'ending', 'can', 'tell', 'would', 'never', 'write', 'Yes', 'end', 'scenario', 'alluded', 'book', 'what', 'know', 'David', 'Drayton', 'would', 'assert', 'incapable', 'such', 'act', 'Second', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'took', 'big', 'liberties', 'Shining', 'where', 'transformed', 'original', 'King', 'story', 'strong', 'work', 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'Darabont', 'butchered', 'original', 'text', 'overuse', 'artistic', 'license', 'King', 'outwardly', 'claims', 'have', 'liked', 'ending', 'wonder', 'what', 'really', 'thought', 'will', 'admit', 'book', 'ending', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'movie', 'just', 'reason', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'alone.There', 'were', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'monsters', 'were', 'tremendous', 'appearances', 'were', 'not', 'far', 'what', 'imagined', 'whilst', 'reading', 'book', 'Credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'However', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'days', 'so', 'good', 'monsters', 'are', 'be', 'expected.We', 'know', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'capable', 'directing', 'moving', 'worthwhile', 'films', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'Mist', 'would', 'be', 'dud', 'Why', 'world', 'would', 'choose', 'go', 'DVD', 'extras', 'explain', 'budget', 'was', 'indeed', 'meager', 'why', 'did', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'back', 'out', 'Dimension', 'Films', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'studio', 'company', 'brought', 'such', 'forgettable', 'dreck', 'Scream', 'trilogy', 'eight', 'incarnations', 'Hellraiser', 'movie', 'definitely', 'cup', 'tea']",N/A

So when I heard there was going to be movie made about it, I was incredible excited, but also a little worried. More often than not Stephen King adaptations have been less than enjoyable, but there are exceptions of course, ""The Shining"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", etc. But for every excellent adaptation there a half dozen stinkers. But then I heard Frank Darabont would be helming this, and my excitement in the project was once again rekindled. I was not disappointed. Not only is this a faithful and quite simply excellent adaptation, it actually surpasses the original story by fleshing things out more. A true rarity. This character-driven horror film is one-of-a-kind, with an ending you know is coming, but still can not help but be chilled to bone by it. To horror fans, I say buy this now! But even if you do not like horror, I know you can still find enjoyment in this movie, it is just so competently done, anyone can take something away from it. The acting, production, atmosphere, everything about it just exudes brilliance. I also enjoyed the lack of music up until the end of the movie, as that just added to the suspense of the movie. And then the only song used was so perfectly chosen, a ""Dead Can Dance"" like dirge that was as ominous as it was beautiful.

I remembered the book's basic premise and that was about all.  Since this movie never played locally (don't ask me why--ask Chaeker's Theaters), I anxiously awaited its release to DVD.Although I have been quite harsh on other King's novels (turned into movies), I was surprised at how good director Frank Darabont did with his actors, dialogue, and effects.  Darabont also directed ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile,""--two other Stephen King novels-turned-into-movies.  Here, he puts several townspeople in a claustrophic atmosphere/apocalyptic end-of-times scenario, and then hurls everything he can at them.  What the audience views is just how quickly man will turn on man.Marcia Gay Harding, as the bible-thumper know-it-all, managed to make her performance very believable, as she was an actual character and NOT a caricature.

I watch them to have fun and enjoy myself.Up until the ending, the movie was good. It seems odd that people struggling so hard to survive would just up and quit so easily. They just turned out to be a pathetic bunch of losers. Also, as they were driving down the highway, they passed hundreds of cars that would surely have had gas in them. When they were getting low on gas they could have changed cars. There was no need to run completely out of gas. Only a bonehead would have them do that. I mean they escape and go through all that and run out of gas with plenty of cars all around them? Duh.It's not logical for them to commit suicide while there is a possible means of escape. Switching cars and continuing their journey seems to me a logical and elegant way to stay in the game. So, how could the director overlook such a simple way to have them survive? It doesn't make sense.Of course if someone is one of the new dumbed down generation then this absurd ending will probably have them titillated to such a degree that they'll never realize they forgot to think while watching the movie.So, the director suddenly changed the characters into mindless stupid wimps just to show how wonderful he was at surprising people with a pointless ending?

So, I am not writing for the devotee.My  main criticism was in the length. First, the key location is a supermarket in which numerous people were trapped by the monsters coming in with ""The Mist"" which blanketed their small town and its environs. Here the usual representative types try to understand what is going on, arrive at solutions, act on solutions, and manifest their fears in various ways. We have a good assortment of types necessary to play out the various responses that, with some variation in each case, are the staples of thrillers of this particular type. Without doubt the filmmakers had a number of points they wanted to make,  I just found  the talk too prolonged, although the main antagonist to whatever the creators thought was rational (The Voice of God Lady) made a substantial contribution to the drama,  it could have been less insistent and much briefer. I'm afraid that I wanted less talk and more action.With that qualification, I thought the film a decent  rendering of the ancient plot, with the monsters being satisfactory, if not particularly awesome most of the time. Needless to say, there had to be a few types of attackers who were a bit disgusting to the average person.No particular ending was forced by the logic of the plot which preceded it. The choice was a random one (if you take the attitude that a film is a film and a book is a book, faithfulness to which is not the mandate of a filmmaker). I saw no reason, save personal taste, to dictate the ending chosen. I didn't much like it, so, given the absence of a logical necessity for it, I  put in my own ending (in my mind, of course) as a substitute. You are perfectly free to do the same if you  preferAll in all, for someone who customarily does not view such films, this falls into the decent category, suitable for recommending to the average viewer, but not with the urgency of ""don't miss it"". If you miss it, many other movies could substitute adequately from an entertainment viewpoint.  I knew none of the actors so cannot comment on their performances here compared to elsewhere. Seems to me they did a good job playing the roles as assigned.",4,With Defects but Should Satisfy Fans of the Genre,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,2265,"['usually', ""donj't"", 'watch', 'sort', 'thing', 'decided', 'look', 'genre', 'dozen', 'two', 'dozen', 'films', 'So', 'am', 'not', 'writing', 'devotee.My', 'main', 'criticism', 'was', 'length', 'First', 'key', 'location', 'supermarket', 'numerous', 'people', 'were', 'trapped', 'monsters', 'coming', 'Mist', 'blanketed', 'small', 'town', 'environs', 'Here', 'usual', 'representative', 'types', 'try', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'arrive', 'solutions', 'act', 'solutions', 'manifest', 'fears', 'various', 'ways', 'have', 'good', 'assortment', 'types', 'necessary', 'play', 'out', 'various', 'responses', 'variation', 'case', 'are', 'staples', 'thrillers', 'particular', 'type', 'doubt', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'number', 'points', 'wanted', 'make', 'just', 'found', 'talk', 'too', 'prolonged', 'main', 'antagonist', 'whatever', 'creators', 'thought', 'was', 'rational', 'Voice', 'God', 'Lady', 'made', 'substantial', 'contribution', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'insistent', 'much', 'briefer', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'wanted', 'less', 'talk', 'more', 'action.With', 'qualification', 'thought', 'film', 'decent', 'rendering', 'ancient', 'plot', 'monsters', 'being', 'satisfactory', 'not', 'particularly', 'awesome', 'most', 'time', 'Needless', 'say', 'had', 'be', 'few', 'types', 'attackers', 'who', 'were', 'bit', 'disgusting', 'average', 'person.No', 'particular', 'ending', 'was', 'forced', 'logic', 'plot', 'preceded', 'choice', 'was', 'random', 'one', 'take', 'attitude', 'film', 'film', 'book', 'book', 'faithfulness', 'not', 'mandate', 'filmmaker', 'saw', 'reason', 'save', 'personal', 'taste', 'dictate', 'ending', 'chosen', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'so', 'given', 'absence', 'logical', 'necessity', 'put', 'own', 'ending', 'mind', 'course', 'substitute', 'are', 'perfectly', 'free', 'do', 'same', 'preferAll', 'someone', 'who', 'customarily', 'not', 'view', 'such', 'films', 'decent', 'category', 'suitable', 'recommending', 'average', 'viewer', 'not', 'urgency', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'miss', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'could', 'substitute', 'adequately', 'entertainment', 'viewpoint', 'knew', 'none', 'actors', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'performances', 'here', 'compared', 'elsewhere', 'Seems', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'roles', 'assigned']",N/A

Two versions of the same film in one package. One disc is in beautiful color as released in the movie theaters and the other is gorgeous black and white as the director wanted to make available for the home market. The first time I ever saw this movie was on youtube of all places in terrible quality, so talk about a step up viewing it on Blu-ray! The color version of the film is stunning, especially the daylight scenes outdoors with greens that simply leap off the screen. The black and white version is outstanding quality as well. I think most mainstream viewers will prefer the color version while the film buffs will gravitate towards the black and white just for that old school atmosphere.Granted that this Blu-ray is stunning but technical details aside it still doesn't make an average film great. This is another in the multitude of subpar films based on Stephen King material. In this film bizarre creatures invade a small town after it is enveloped in a heavy mist. An assortment of people led by main star Thomas Jane get trapped inside a supermarket and have to fight for their lives against the strange invading lifeforms. The biggest negative aspect of this movie in my opinion is the lousy C.G.I. ( computer generated imagery ). The special effects are simply not first rate and tend to get goofy. Sure, there is plenty of blood and violence on display but I couldn't get past the underwhelming C.G.I. The black and white version of the film helps out somewhat in the sense that the effects look less intrusive with less color. Anyhow the film has a terrific atmosphere and anytime you have a movie with a bunch of townsfolk trapped in a small environment with bloodthirsty beasts outside you've got some entertainment value for sure. Stephen King usually has some religious or spiritual theme going on in his work and in this film we get a religious loon played by Marcia Gay Harden, one of the best characters in the movie. Little by little the rational people descend into survival mode and then the mayhem truly takes over.The ending of the movie has caused some controversy as it's quite nihilistic. I personally have not read the story by Stephen King on which this is based so I can't report if the ending there is the same or not. I liked the ending as it's different from the Hollywood norm. The whole mystery of where the mist and it's inhabitants came from is another fascinating plot point which I won't reveal. Granted there haven't been that many outstanding Stephen King adaptations over the years but with ""The Mist"" and the recent ""1408"", this horror writer has made a welcome return to the screen. I enjoyed the quality of the Blu-ray and the fact they went all out for this release.

The acting is decent considering the genre (Thomas Jane is competent, though some of the supporting cast were corny).  For example, it has the stereotypical overacted ""God fearing"" right wing nut-job warning about the apocalypse.  I grow tired of these stale, disconnected Hollywood roles.My main problem with this movie occurs towards the end--don't worry because I won't completely give it away.  As I began approaching the end of the movie I hoped things wouldn't go as I predicted.  With 25 minutes to spare, and accounting for the constant theme of ""nuance"", you can predict what's coming.  In fact, I thought to myself, ""This movie has two potential endings.  One will be uplifting, a story of survival and perseverance, of taking the high road; the other a typical modern-horror tale of failure that sends a defeatist banner in the air like all good little Hollywooders.""I have seen worse movies, but in keeping with the verbiage attached to Amazon's rating's system, I ""hated"" this movie primarily because of its pathetic, cowardly ending.  I enjoy movies about people who fight for their morals and their family, not this Hollywood crap that casts aside such principles.  If you want a movie you can feel good about, this isn't it.

About a year ago we had the excellent 1408 and now The Mist, which I think is even better. Its an easy premise to begin but it quickly devolves into infighting between the humans.It is very well acted, directed and produced and I wont add much to the storyline. Its all been said.SPOILER ALERTThe ending has two moments that I think are truly unique. The first is where they encounter a creature that is huge beyond comprehension and they are so stunned by it that they do not even say a word. It is right from the novella and very well done.The very ending? I loved it. It was so atypical Hollywood. It dared to take the hard path and not make it a happy ending. It was disturbing and depressing and it will stay with you for a long time.The two disc dvd is a great buy with lots of extras, including a spooky black and white version of the film and a nice commentary by the director.With the current flood of horror movies that are only meant to disgust and put no real thought in the story, this movie is a great refreshing change. Yeah, there were some gory moments, but more genuinely frightening ones and the director does a great job of putting you in that situation, in the supermarket, surrounded by the mist and the many bizarre creatures.

1126739,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B0010X73ZG,Genevieve Hayes,"[3, 3]","""The Mist"" (based on a story by Stephen King) is a movie about monsters but not the ones you would expect. After a massive storm, a dense mist descends upon a small town in Maine, bringing with it a swarm of giant, blood-thirsty insects. When the monsters arrive, artist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane), finds himself and his young son trapped in the local supermarket with a large group of townspeople and it doesn't take long for him to realize that these people must band together if they hope to ever leave the store alive.Although this is a monster movie, in the traditional, tentacles and fangs, sense. The giant insects get very little screen time. In a two hour movie, I only counted about six appearances of the insects and these are all relatively short, albeit, very gory (you may prefer to watch a different movie, if you happen to have a weak stomach). Instead, writer/director Frank Darabont (who also directed screen adaptations of two other Stephen King stories, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile""), focuses on the monsters inside the store, that is, the humans, in particular Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a fundamentalist Christian who is even more dangerous than the monsters outside.This is really a film about how humans behave in extreme situations. I read somewhere that one of Stephen King's favourite novels is ""Lord of the Flies"", and in a way, ""The Mist"" can be seen as being a variant on ""Lord of the Flies"", with adults rather than children. As with ""Lord of the Flies"", the message of this film is that if you take people out of their familiar surroundings and scare them enough, they will become savages - not exactly a message to restore your faith in humanity.This is a very well made film, with acting that is, in general, excellent (give or take a couple of the supporting actors). It's not as good as ""The Shawshank Redemption"", but few films are.

Frank Darabont  has consistently brought King's popular horror stories to the screen with great success.  For this film he's gathered a substantial cast, used computer generated graphics well, but in the end the result is a confusing mishmash of story versus sermon versus actors being overwhelmed by some really strange upstaging creatures.David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is a graphic artist who manages to weather a freak storm only to discover a mysterious mist hovering over his backyard lake.  Going to town with his young son to get supplies at a Food Store he joins the other townsfolk in the gossip about the mist which now engulfs the town: could it be due to some experiment at the military post lab in the mountains?  The store's generator sounds like it is fumbling, and while brave David tries to fix it (mind you, in this town with no electricity, the lights in the main store remain on....), he sees the back wall buckling and hears a bizarre noise.  Returning to the storefront, David informs the crowd of his findings, but his descriptions are not believed - especially by the town psycho Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who sees all things in relation to her channeling of God via her knowledge of the Book of Revelations, and the pessimistic out-of-towner Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), who has a running disagreement with David. But gradually David gathers some sensible folk (Toby Jones, Chris Owen, et al) to accompany him to the generator room and against David's warning, the back door is opened by the young stock boy and huge tentacles enter from the mist and consume the lad. Thus we have two factions: those who side with Mrs. Carmody's religious zealot need to sacrifice people to the outdoor monsters now flying about the store and those who are convinced they must fight the offenders with force and escape.  The mess of a story is further confused with overlay of father/son devotion, mass hysteria, mob rule, revenge on the military for loosing these 'other world monsters' on the public,  and 'what do we do if this is the end of the earth'.  How it all winds down may satisfy some and may irritate others.So why rate this film with two stars instead of one?  Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as the crazy Mrs. Carmody and Toby Jones offers a solid representation of the stable man as a clerk in the store who keeps his wits about him. Thomas Jane is Thomas Jane, and for an action hero, he seems to melt with the circumstances.  The movie is long, silly, not scary, and suffers from a weak script.  For those who are entertained by this sort of story it may be worthwhile.  For those who are fatigued by the same old line of good versus evil in the form of gooey huge monsters, pass on this film.

Inside are bizarre creatures and a group of people taking refuge in a supermarket have to figure everything out and survive. Is this the end of the world or a phenomena caused by a military experiment gone wrong -- or on purpose? It's not just about the monsters in the mist. It's mainly about the people and what can happen when they are scared and losing their composure.There was too much Mrs. Carmody, though, the lady who believes that she's a vessel of God and that she knows all the answers. She's got it all wrong, especially when she is speaking to God and saying that she wants to ""earn"" her place at His side by works she does. As the Bible states, it is not of works so nobody can boast and claim ""I got here but what I did."" It's Jesus' sacrifice that was the only acceptable payment for sin. It's grace; something we didn't deserve.Even commentary on a deleted scene mentioned that they cut out more featuring her because people ""got her"" and didn't need as much.The special effects were reasonable with the limited budget. The worst were the tentacles in the loading dock, which just seemed unfinished in some way. I liked the great Frances Sternhagen killing that giant bug with the spray and a flame; check out her doing it in the special effects.I thought the ending was just awesome. The father killed his son and the three other passengers rather than let them face death from the monsters. Then, he stepped out into the mist, calling for the monsters to get him. However, the mist started to dissipate and military vehicles all came into view...along with rescued people.I wonder what I would have thought if the trucks with saved folks contained all those who were left behind in the supermarket? I think that might have made it even cooler.The father did keep his promise to his son, who asked him to never let the monsters get him...but it was in a horrible way, ultimately, since if he just waited a couple more minutes everyone would have been fine and his promise would still have been kept, of course.With everything witnessed ... especially the absolutely huge monster at the end ... they all must have thought the mist was unending and they just gave up. I think I would have wanted to wait until I was starving or the monsters were right outside the window.Still, it was good to see something different in a movie; a depressing but awesome finale; and Mr. King approved of it and that's good to know.4 stars from me.",4,enjoyable,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,2670,"['really', 'am', 'not', 'interested', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'movies', 'based', 'dug', 'one.Based', '1980', 'tale', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'enveloped', 'terror', 'confusion', 'when', 'bizarre', 'mist', 'everything', 'Inside', 'are', 'bizarre', 'creatures', 'group', 'people', 'taking', 'refuge', 'supermarket', 'have', 'figure', 'everything', 'survive', 'end', 'world', 'phenomena', 'caused', 'military', 'experiment', 'gone', 'wrong', 'purpose', 'not', 'just', 'monsters', 'mist', 'mainly', 'people', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'are', 'scared', 'losing', 'composure.There', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'though', 'lady', 'who', 'vessel', 'God', 'answers', 'got', 'wrong', 'especially', 'when', 'speaking', 'God', 'saying', 'earn', 'place', 'side', 'Bible', 'states', 'not', 'works', 'nobody', 'can', 'boast', 'claim', 'got', 'here', 'what', 'did', 'Jesus', 'sacrifice', 'was', 'only', 'acceptable', 'payment', 'sin', 'grace', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve.Even', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'cut', 'out', 'more', 'featuring', 'people', 'got', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'much.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'reasonable', 'limited', 'budget', 'worst', 'were', 'tentacles', 'loading', 'dock', 'just', 'seemed', 'unfinished', 'way', 'liked', 'great', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'killing', 'giant', 'bug', 'spray', 'flame', 'check', 'out', 'doing', 'special', 'effects.I', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'awesome', 'father', 'killed', 'son', 'three', 'other', 'passengers', 'rather', 'let', 'face', 'death', 'monsters', 'Then', 'stepped', 'out', 'mist', 'calling', 'monsters', 'get', 'However', 'mist', 'started', 'dissipate', 'military', 'vehicles', 'came', 'view', 'rescued', 'people.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'trucks', 'saved', 'folks', 'contained', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'behind', 'supermarket', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'cooler.The', 'father', 'did', 'keep', 'promise', 'son', 'who', 'asked', 'never', 'let', 'monsters', 'get', 'was', 'horrible', 'way', 'ultimately', 'just', 'waited', 'couple', 'more', 'minutes', 'everyone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'promise', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'course.With', 'everything', 'witnessed', 'especially', 'absolutely', 'huge', 'monster', 'end', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'mist', 'was', 'unending', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'wait', 'was', 'starving', 'monsters', 'were', 'right', 'window.Still', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'movie', 'depressing', 'awesome', 'finale', 'Mr.', 'King', 'approved', 'good', 'know.4', 'stars']",N/A
1126746,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B0010X73ZG,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[9, 17]","Tried to like it, but this movie lost me pretty early on with a totally unrealistic scenario. The townsfolk are trapped in a supermarket, with some unknown killer mist outside. One woman wants to go out to find her kids who she left at home. Others respond that the mist might be poison gas. She self-righteously asks if anyone will escort her. The men silently refuse - and the film makes it clear that they're to be ashamed of themselves!Not only that, THEY LET HER OPEN THE DOOR AND LEAVE! That's right, she might be dooming them all to poison gas, but not only is she ""the good mother"" in this movie, they don't even try to stop her from possibly killing them all! Now that's not normal human behavior.There are many other scenes that just don't make sense at all. Some men cut off a tentacle and later try to convince the others that there's a horrible monster outside ... without showing them the tentacle. Why not just BRING IT AND SHOW THEM? I was getting really annoyed by this time. And there are many other scenes where people just STAND STILL to be killed, rather than running away.There is the stereotypical religious (Christian, what else?) nut calling for human sacrifice and spewing vulgarities and hatred, but that's OK, because, you know, Christian viewers are not going to bomb your building or anything, so it's totally OK to offend them. And it's ""brave"" and ""edgy"", too. And everyone knows that's what they're really like, right? But Christophobes will be totally satisfied, if you know what I mean, wink wink. (There is a mention that she is ""unstable"", but the whole religious-people-are-scum aspect will make a big impression upon ignorant viewers.)The ending was somewhat disgusting (not visually, but logically).

If I had a complaint it would be that some of the critters looked like Halloween decorations, this did not stop me from enjoying this movie or giving it 5 stars. Lots of extras on the DVD as well. Commentary, making of, deleted scenes etc. Opinions varied on this movie but I would recommend it, even with all the one star reviews. It can be tough rating a horror flick, what is scary to me may be silly to you, this seems to be the case with this movie. Differing opinions, none of them wrong.

The last five minutes bring the statement in #1 in question.I really loved this movie.  It had an intensity that has not been matched in a long while as far as thrillers go.  The characters were all excellent and those you are suppose to care about you actually do.  Which makes the filmmakers decision to conclude it the way they did really disapoint.  I am a huge fan of non-Hollywood endings, but the final moments in THE MIST are so completely bleak they tarnish the film and leave the viewer with a cold rock in the gut that makes the film unwatchable for the second time (it's hard to find truly good movies these days, but when one pops up it's usually the best the 2nd time around-IMO).  The ending is a fine example of either hate it or love it, and would have received 5 stars from this reviewer had the finale been tweaked a touch, and I do mean a touch.

But it is also not quite satisfactory.There is too much being in two minds going on here! Just look at the reviews, so many of them: so many are absolutely enchanted, so many others are totally put off. That must mean something.The reviewers' split mirrors quite appropriately the film's own schizophrenia: it is about important issues of the American society of today, about its separation in camps, about the split of modern and scientific rationalism versus the spirit of biblical literalism. Pragmatism versus Old Testament is the main message. But the plot is based on the horror vision of science gone wrong, of monsters born out of the hubris of military scientists.How can one get disentangled from that spiderweb? One can't easily, and the ending has a nice touch of futility. Don't get too logical about the ending, many will be frustrated by it, one can even argue that it is not logical, but it is certainly a powerful message.Before watching the film, I knew little about it and somehow hoped that it would be creative with using mist for horror. Then the fact that the mist is actually just hiding monsters came as a bit of disappointment, it somehow cheapened the film.

1126758,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B0010X73ZG,I'm Right,"[2, 2]","I think it depends on how people see human nature. Personally I loved this horror movie 20 minutes on because the truly frightening aspect of it wasn't so much the mostly shrouded monsters, but more so how people act in dire circumstances. If I were in that situation with my neighbors and townsfolk and they all as Tom Jane said ""have all their electricity turned off and the s*** scared out of them, they're willing to believe anything"". It's a very bleak and unflinching look at humanity, but look at Nazi Germany, look at the Donnor Party, look at the Salem Witch Trials for a few examples if you think that people would act like a rational team in horrible circumstances. Just thank the stars most of us haven't had to be in that situation.The monsters themselves were unique and original, and they kind of reminded me of Silent Hill 1, with very insect/dinosaur shapes. They did look a little cheesy which I think was Darabount's way to tribute to the 50's monster movies. Still their corny look was played completely sober and all of the deaths looked very gruesome and painful.Maybe the reason I liked the Mist so much was because of how dark and bleak the whole experience was, a man dies in vain trying to save his DoA burned brother, a local town brutally murders a local soldier, and of course there's the pitch-black ending.

1126760,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0010X73ZG,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 4]","I've been looking for the past several years for a deeply affecting and really excellent horror film, and this is it. Films like JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING and David Cronenberg's remake of THE FLY are about as great as you can get, because not only are they excellent horror films with taut and terrifying moments, they transcend the genre itself. Where Carpenter's THE THING is at its heart a story of utter paranoia and distrust and Cronenberg's THE FLY is a star-crossed love story set against the backdrop of the over-extension of man's reach, Frank Darabont's THE MIST is about how easily and quickly society can break down to its basest and ugliest forms when confronted with a seemingly apocalyptic threat.Thomas Jane (in what should have been a star-making role) plays David Drayton, a mild-mannered artist in a coastal Maine town who finds himself as the voice of reason when an eerie mist blows into town which may or may not be concealing an army of preternatural forces, trapping a small but substantial section of the townspeople in the local supermarket. He, along with his young son Billy (a nicely-cast Nathan Gamble) a pretty young schoolteacher Amanda (played beautifully by Laurie Holden) and a wonderfully crotchety old lady (played by Frances Sternhagen), along with a few others, are trying to hold their ground and their grip on an already-tenuous situation against local Bible-thumping lunatic Mrs. Carmody (played a little too over-the-top by the usually understated Marcia Gay Harden) who is using some unusual coincidences to prove that this attack is the wrath of God, and using the other townspeople's fear to cause a threat within the store that rivals the threat from without.It's easy to dismiss this film as simple escapism, but it is so much more. Great performances by Jane, Holden, Sternhagen and supporting players Andre Braugher and William Sadler put this film above the recent flurry of classic horror remakes, watered-down Japanese-to-American retcons and the ""torture porn"" sub-genre that have been masquerading as horror films, and it does so with great writing, great effects, great direction and the single most disturbing ending of a film since David Fincher's SE7EN.The last horror film that I saw that seemed truly original and terrifying and iconic was Victor Salva's JEEPERS CREEPERS. While this film may not be quite as visceral as that, it's still been five years since that film came out and since then, for the most part, Hollywood has been cranking out films like THE RING, THE GRUDGE, remakes of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, HALLOWEEN and THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and the ad nauseam SAW series and its fellow torturers HOSTEL and TURISTAS. Every so often, a terrific little indie horror gem like Lucky Mckee's MAY or John Fawcett's GINGER SNAPS will pop up, but that's all they do. THE MIST is the only horror film to come out of Hollywood in the last 5 years that has had any lasting effect on me, like the great horror films of the 70's like HALLOWEEN, THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, or some of the greats of the 80's like THE THING, THE FLY or NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. All of these films transcend the genre as THE MIST does, and it really seems like this is a dying breed of horror film when this film does half the business of lesser recent entries like I AM LEGEND, or 30 DAYS OF NIGHT, where, while decent films, are hardly the films that are likely to keep you up nights haunting you. THE MIST will either haunt you or anger you, but it will provoke debate, especially with an ending that may be on the level of nihilism that rivals that of Romero's original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.For my money, this was one of the very best films of last year, and I can only hope that in the future, this is a film that will be revisited and rediscovered as many of the now-classic horror films have been.",5,One of the dying breed of horror greats.,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,3846,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'really', 'excellent', 'horror', 'film', 'Films', 'JOHN', 'CARPENTER', 'THE', 'THING', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'remake', 'THE', 'FLY', 'are', 'as', 'great', 'can', 'get', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'excellent', 'horror', 'films', 'taut', 'terrifying', 'moments', 'transcend', 'genre', 'Where', 'Carpenter', 'THE', 'THING', 'heart', 'story', 'utter', 'paranoia', 'distrust', 'Cronenberg', 'THE', 'FLY', 'star-crossed', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'backdrop', 'over-extension', 'man', 'reach', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'THE', 'MIST', 'how', 'easily', 'quickly', 'society', 'can', 'break', 'down', 'basest', 'ugliest', 'forms', 'when', 'confronted', 'seemingly', 'apocalyptic', 'threat.Thomas', 'Jane', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'star-making', 'role', 'David', 'Drayton', 'mild-mannered', 'artist', 'coastal', 'Maine', 'town', 'who', 'voice', 'reason', 'when', 'eerie', 'mist', 'blows', 'town', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'concealing', 'army', 'preternatural', 'forces', 'trapping', 'small', 'substantial', 'section', 'townspeople', 'local', 'supermarket', 'young', 'son', 'Billy', 'nicely-cast', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'pretty', 'young', 'schoolteacher', 'Amanda', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'wonderfully', 'crotchety', 'old', 'lady', 'played', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'few', 'others', 'are', 'trying', 'hold', 'ground', 'grip', 'already-tenuous', 'situation', 'local', 'Bible-thumping', 'lunatic', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'played', 'little', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'usually', 'understated', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'who', 'using', 'unusual', 'coincidences', 'prove', 'attack', 'wrath', 'God', 'using', 'other', 'townspeople', 'fear', 'cause', 'threat', 'store', 'threat', 'without.It', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'film', 'simple', 'escapism', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Great', 'performances', 'Jane', 'Holden', 'Sternhagen', 'supporting', 'players', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'William', 'Sadler', 'put', 'film', 'recent', 'flurry', 'classic', 'horror', 'remakes', 'watered-down', 'Japanese-to-American', 'retcons', 'torture', 'porn', 'sub-genre', 'have', 'been', 'masquerading', 'horror', 'films', 'so', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'effects', 'great', 'direction', 'single', 'most', 'disturbing', 'ending', 'film', 'David', 'Fincher', 'SE7EN.The', 'last', 'horror', 'film', 'saw', 'seemed', 'truly', 'original', 'terrifying', 'iconic', 'was', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'JEEPERS', 'CREEPERS', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'as', 'visceral', 'still', 'been', 'five', 'years', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'then', 'most', 'part', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'cranking', 'out', 'films', 'THE', 'RING', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'remakes', 'THE', 'TEXAS', 'CHAINSAW', 'MASSACRE', 'HALLOWEEN', 'THE', 'HILLS', 'HAVE', 'EYES', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'SAW', 'series', 'fellow', 'torturers', 'HOSTEL', 'TURISTAS', 'Every', 'so', 'often', 'terrific', 'little', 'indie', 'horror', 'gem', 'Lucky', 'Mckee', 'MAY', 'John', 'Fawcett', 'GINGER', 'SNAPS', 'will', 'pop', 'up', 'do', 'THE', 'MIST', 'only', 'horror', 'film', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'last', '5', 'years', 'had', 'lasting', 'effect', 'great', 'horror', 'films', '70', 'like', 'HALLOWEEN', 'THE', 'EXORCIST', 'THE', 'OMEN', 'greats', '80', 'THE', 'THING', 'THE', 'FLY', 'NIGHTMARE', 'ON', 'ELM', 'STREET', 'films', 'transcend', 'genre', 'MIST', 'really', 'dying', 'breed', 'horror', 'film', 'when', 'film', 'business', 'lesser', 'recent', 'entries', 'AM', 'LEGEND', '30', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'where', 'decent', 'films', 'are', 'hardly', 'films', 'are', 'likely', 'keep', 'up', 'nights', 'haunting', 'MIST', 'will', 'either', 'haunt', 'anger', 'will', 'provoke', 'debate', 'especially', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'level', 'nihilism', 'Romero', 'original', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD.For', 'money', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'future', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'revisited', 'rediscovered', 'many', 'now-classic', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'been']",N/A

For years people have wished King's short story was longer and a maybe even redone as a full length novel.  We also wanted to see it on the big screen but alas we had to wait quite some time.  With King stories turned into movies you never know if it is going to be great (as withMisery,The Shawshank Redemption (also based on a short story)and others. Or just plain disappointing compared to the novel (such as the butchering of one of King's best novels with movie versionIt. So maybe in hindsight its not a bad thing we had to wait so long and some B grade director didn't make a cheap movie of this classic short story.The major feel of the short story was still here, obviously being a short story other scenes (and an ending) had to be added to make a feature length film so you knew that going in.  I think the additional scenes pay great respect to the King story.  If you watch the extras on the DVD particularly A Conversation With Stephen King and Frank Darabont you'll learn King loved the film, especially the controversial ending (and I'm not spoiling that for those who haven't seen it like so many reviewers seem to enjoy doing).  I thought the ending was well done and excellent way to wrap up the film.  You'll also learn Frank Darabont thought Stephen's name was Stefan when he came across his first King novel experience - The Shining.Other special features you get with this DVD package are an audio commentary with Frank Darabont (director).  The Making of the Mist documentary titled When Darkness Comes which is quite interesting.  Plus a few theatrical trailers.The movie alone is worth the price of the DVD.  Definitely one of Kings best ever stories brought to film.  Well done to all those involved.Basic plot if you've got no idea what the movie or short story were about is after a vicious storm residents of a small town converge on the local supermarket to get supplies and prepare for the next one which is also coming with a thick mist.  As they queue at the checkouts a terrified local man runs into the supermarket telling them to shut the doors and that another local was killed by something in the mist.  Many doubt there is anything to fear but it soon becomes evident there are things in the mist that make going outside suicide.  Inside the supermarket power struggles and paranoia mean that maybe the town folk have more to fear from each other, than what's outside!",5,One of King's Best Short Stories Finally Made into a Movie,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,2491,"['read', 'Mist', 'inSkeleton', 'Crewas', 'kid', 'immediately', 'wanted', 'more', 'story', 'years', 'people', 'have', 'wished', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'longer', 'maybe', 'even', 'redone', 'full', 'length', 'novel', 'also', 'wanted', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'had', 'wait', 'quite', 'time', 'King', 'stories', 'turned', 'movies', 'never', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'withMisery', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'also', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'others', 'just', 'plain', 'disappointing', 'compared', 'novel', 'such', 'butchering', 'one', 'King', 'best', 'novels', 'movie', 'versionIt', 'So', 'maybe', 'hindsight', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'had', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'B', 'grade', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cheap', 'movie', 'classic', 'short', 'story.The', 'major', 'feel', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'still', 'here', 'obviously', 'being', 'short', 'story', 'other', 'scenes', 'ending', 'had', 'be', 'added', 'make', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'knew', 'going', 'think', 'additional', 'scenes', 'pay', 'great', 'respect', 'King', 'story', 'watch', 'extras', 'DVD', 'particularly', 'Conversation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Frank', 'Darabont', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'King', 'loved', 'film', 'especially', 'controversial', 'ending', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'excellent', 'way', 'wrap', 'up', 'film', ""'ll"", 'also', 'learn', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'thought', 'Stephen', 'name', 'was', 'Stefan', 'when', 'came', 'first', 'King', 'novel', 'experience', 'Shining.Other', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'DVD', 'package', 'are', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'director', 'Making', 'Mist', 'documentary', 'titled', 'When', 'Darkness', 'Comes', 'quite', 'interesting', 'few', 'theatrical', 'trailers.The', 'movie', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD', 'Definitely', 'one', 'Kings', 'best', 'ever', 'stories', 'brought', 'film', 'Well', 'done', 'involved.Basic', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'short', 'story', 'were', 'about', 'vicious', 'storm', 'residents', 'small', 'town', 'converge', 'local', 'supermarket', 'get', 'supplies', 'prepare', 'next', 'one', 'also', 'coming', 'thick', 'mist', 'queue', 'checkouts', 'terrified', 'local', 'man', 'supermarket', 'telling', 'shut', 'doors', 'local', 'was', 'killed', 'something', 'mist', 'Many', 'doubt', 'anything', 'fear', 'soon', 'evident', 'are', 'things', 'mist', 'make', 'going', 'outside', 'suicide', 'supermarket', 'power', 'struggles', 'paranoia', 'mean', 'maybe', 'town', 'folk', 'have', 'more', 'fear', 'other', 'what', 'outside']",N/A

1126767,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0010X73ZG,Jason,"[4, 4]","It's difficult to rank the Stephen King works that have made it to the silver screen.  Among them, I'd rank Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile as the best two.  With that said, I believe no higher praise can be given to one of his works - considering the aforementioned duo are 5-star classics - than to say The Mist probably drifts its way into the award ceremony and snatches the bronze medal with a flesh-tearing tentacle.  It should come as no surprise then, that Frank Darabont was the writer/director of all three.The setup: A dense mist that rolls in from the nearby military science facility envelops a coastal town, causing townsfolk to congregate at the supermarket for supplies.  When otherworldly creatures begin to emerge from the mist divisive factions form.  Some spurred on Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) - a religious zealot whose fire and brimstone sermons prey upon scripture ignorance and fear of the unknown to spawn a cult-like following - believe the monsters to be an Old Testament prediction come true, while others, led by pragmatic but terrified everyman David Drayton (Thomas Jane), scramble to protect themselves and attempt to rationalize the mounting deaths from monsters...some of which did not come from the mist.Ultimately this film successfully explores the erosion of humanity and logic in the face of extreme terror.  It's akin to sacrifices atop pyramids because the volcano gods needed to be placated.  Much of mankind will eventually devolve towards beastly behavior when faced with a catastrophic situation that cannot be explained.  In that regard, I believe the movie is incredibly believable; psyches would fracture and reason would disappear if monsters appeared out of nowhere and began killing us in an array of terrifyingly lethal methods.The entire production of this film is superb.  Everything from acting to FX is nearly perfect in my opinion.  One aspect, however, stood out more than ever before.  The score exudes the very essence of the onscreen mood, and composer Mark Isham absolutely rips emotion out of the viewer's chest.  The Host of Seraphim is, in and of itself, a masterpiece of emotionally challenging music that loops infinitely in my nightmares.

I guess I'll figure it out by the end of the review. The story is centered around a small town community that undergoes a big storm leaving the townspeople in a panic. As they all head to a small local grocery store a strange mist comes upon the entire area. Those in the store are warned by an olderman that there is something in the mist that killed one of his friends. He urges for everyone to stay inside but there are always a few hard headed folks that just won't listen. As they go into the mist they quickly disappear leaving only a terrified scream behind.As the story moves forward we begin to see some interesting creatures. I was impressed by the visuals with the creatures being very different then what you usually see in these type films. At this point we have a few battles that all take place inside the grocery store once some of the creatures get inside. Besides fighting off creatures they also have to deal with an overly preachy townswoman that I was begging to see killed off. She will drive you to the brink of insaity, trust me. The film then begins to turn more toward showing how humanity deals with life threatening situations by turning on each other. I could have done without this idea. I really just want to watch a fun film without having to see someones opinions rolled into it. I feel it also made the film drag on. There was a bit too much focus on this topic.I'm not going to give the ending away but will say that it is very morbid. It definately wasn't the ending I was expecting. However I will give it credit since it was different from a mainstream hollywood ending. So overall I thought it was decent just way too long. It could have been wrapped up much quicker.

The characters are mostly well-developed, with a few exceptions and the FX are good for CGI. They're better when they rely on old-fashioned mechanical effects and I wish Hollywood would learn this lesson. The story moves briskly and the horror comes as a surprise and is actually scary and not just disgusting. There are a few false notes and I didn't like the ending but overall it was an enjoyable edge-of-your-seat bit of fun, which is all I ask from a horror movie.The character of Mrs. Carmody resonates with most characters in King novels and stories who have the slightest religious impulse. Invariably he paints them as vengeful and really makes them caricatures, which makes me wonder why he feels this way. She gets tiresome very quickly and I'm pretty sure a real-life situation would have shown someone shutting her up a lot earlier. This is how the short story was so I blame King for this Old Testament bible-thumper which is quite biased.The ending. I really did enjoy this movie, even the ending was okay the first time around but now I find it too close to the pointlessness shown in the ending of the original Night of the Living Dead. The actions taken by the characters at the end are at odds with their earlier attitudes and behavior and the second time I watched it I really hated the ending. The next time I'll just stop the movie when they stop their vehicle and spare myself the disagreeable ending. I wish they'd made an alternate ending like I Am Legend, the theatrical ending to that film was also senseless and out of character, but at least the alternate ending fit the character and story better. The ending of King's story was even bleaker than this but at least it did fit with what came before.Worth a rental at least, buy it if you like horror that is actually a bit frightening. Some of the minor characters come close to stealing the show so I hope we see more of them.

The actual monster scenes aren't well done and lack much tension (save for a few moments here and there) and are relatively short.  The bulk of the story centers around the characters devolving into baser versions of themselves all with an odd, out of place religious theme.  By the midpoint it was just too much to sit through.  I finished the film for the sake of finishing it, but it was lame, predictable and stupid.SPOILER ALERT (if you keep reading now then don't waste your time posting a comment saying ""you ruined the ending""...)I too disagree with the ending.  Not only did the character not deserve to have that happen, but it was also out of character.  Here is a man that has done all he can do to keep his son and him alive and moving and when the gas is gone he just calls it in and blows the kids brains out.  He doesn't stop to think for even two seconds that maybe there could be something else done like say, siphoning some gas out of all the other vehicles they've spotted, taking bearings of the surroundings to see if there is a safe place to hole up, at least waiting it out to see what other options might open up.  For all he knew the wind could spring up at any minute and blow the mist away.  He has been rationale and ""get it done"" up to this point, even going so far as to risk his life to get medicine for a dying man, so that to just suddenly give up like that was too much to accept.

1126772,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0010X73ZG,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 7]","Of the 108 Stephen King adaptations for film or TV, I am only familiar with a handful of them - 16 to be exact (counting also the film under review). Frank Darabont joins a list of remarkable past alumni (Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, John Carpenter) with this well-crafted monster movie with pretensions. Actually, Darabont is no newcomer to Stephen King territory - having already based three of his four feature-length movies on his work! - but this is the first movie I've seen from the director and, perhaps significantly, the only one of the three which is horror-related.Frankly, I wasn't even aware of the film at all before reviews of its DVD release started cropping up through my Amazon friends. As far as I can recall, theatrical release wasn't spread so widely, perhaps the name Stephen King (because of rampant overexposure over the years) nowadays no longer enjoys the same crowd-pulling effect as it did during his heyday. Still, judging by that modest crowd of actors assembled for the film and its clearly intentional ""realism"" (read a flat, made-for-TV look and relatively restrained gore), the film-makers hardly endeavored to boost its box-office chances any. Besides, we have lately been literally invaded by monster/alien movies so that it isn't hard for one (even as solid as this one is) to get lost in the shuffle.This story takes place in a small seaside American town that wakes up one morning to find itself enveloped in a mysterious cloud of thick mist. Soon enough, it becomes abundantly evident that this houses a barrage of slimy, unnaturally-enlarged and very deadly creatures of the bugs variety. To this tried-and-tested formula, Darabont and King add other much-used elements (religious fanaticism, military incompetence, scientific experimentation, impending apolcalypse, etc.) but take them beyond their bleakest and most ironic possibilities. The last half-hour, in fact, is where the film gets all choked up in message-mongering - complete with an overwhelmingly melancholic score. Indeed, learning that Darabont has even ""presented"" his own original black-and-white vision (as opposed to version) of this film on DVD only adds smoke to the fiery theory that this was intended from the start to be much more than a mere monster movie. Despite good work all around and the best intentions, THE BIRDS (1963), it certainly ain't...Anyhow, the festering tensions between the diverse factions trapped (for most of the film) inside a supermarket and the inherent suspense present in the group's generally unsuccessful excursions on the ""outside"" are skillfully handled and, despite the anonymity of the actors involved, some of the townspeople are blessed with full-blooded characterizations, most prominently Marcia Gay Harden (as the unbalanced, ultra-religious spinster). Most viewers won't fine the characters in this film intriguing but you can't deny Marcia Gay. I was pretty tired the night I watched it but it never let me take even a yawn! The story was superb with great thrills and suspense, but the thing that intrigued me most was the story had some realistic touch. Altogether I have to say this movie is not worth a miss.",4,Quality horror - what a concept!,1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,3192,"['108', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptations', 'film', 'TV', 'am', 'only', 'familiar', 'handful', '16', 'be', 'exact', 'counting', 'also', 'film', 'review', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'list', 'remarkable', 'past', 'alumni', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'well-crafted', 'monster', 'movie', 'pretensions', 'Actually', 'Darabont', 'newcomer', 'Stephen', 'King', 'territory', 'having', 'already', 'based', 'three', 'four', 'feature-length', 'movies', 'work', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'director', 'perhaps', 'significantly', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'horror-related.Frankly', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'film', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'release', 'started', 'cropping', 'up', 'Amazon', 'friends', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'recall', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', ""n't"", 'spread', 'so', 'widely', 'perhaps', 'name', 'Stephen', 'King', 'rampant', 'overexposure', 'years', 'no', 'longer', 'same', 'crowd-pulling', 'effect', 'did', 'heyday', 'Still', 'judging', 'modest', 'crowd', 'actors', 'assembled', 'film', 'clearly', 'intentional', 'realism', 'read', 'flat', 'made-for-TV', 'look', 'relatively', 'restrained', 'gore', 'film-makers', 'hardly', 'endeavored', 'boost', 'box-office', 'chances', 'Besides', 'have', 'lately', 'been', 'literally', 'invaded', 'monster/alien', 'movies', ""n't"", 'hard', 'one', 'even', 'as', 'solid', 'one', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle.This', 'story', 'place', 'small', 'seaside', 'American', 'town', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'enveloped', 'mysterious', 'cloud', 'thick', 'mist', 'Soon', 'enough', 'abundantly', 'evident', 'houses', 'barrage', 'slimy', 'unnaturally-enlarged', 'very', 'deadly', 'creatures', 'bugs', 'variety', 'tried-and-tested', 'formula', 'Darabont', 'King', 'add', 'other', 'much-used', 'elements', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'military', 'incompetence', 'scientific', 'experimentation', 'impending', 'apolcalypse', 'etc', 'take', 'bleakest', 'most', 'ironic', 'possibilities', 'last', 'half-hour', 'fact', 'where', 'film', 'choked', 'up', 'message-mongering', 'complete', 'overwhelmingly', 'melancholic', 'score', 'Indeed', 'learning', 'Darabont', 'even', 'presented', 'own', 'original', 'black-and-white', 'vision', 'opposed', 'version', 'film', 'DVD', 'only', 'smoke', 'fiery', 'theory', 'was', 'intended', 'start', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'mere', 'monster', 'movie', 'good', 'work', 'best', 'intentions', 'BIRDS', '1963', 'certainly', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Anyhow', 'festering', 'tensions', 'diverse', 'factions', 'trapped', 'most', 'film', 'supermarket', 'inherent', 'suspense', 'present', 'group', 'generally', 'unsuccessful', 'excursions', 'outside', 'are', 'skillfully', 'handled', 'anonymity', 'actors', 'involved', 'townspeople', 'are', 'blessed', 'full-blooded', 'characterizations', 'most', 'prominently', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'unbalanced', 'ultra-religious', 'spinster', 'Most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fine', 'characters', 'film', 'intriguing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'was', 'pretty', 'tired', 'night', 'watched', 'never', 'let', 'take', 'even', 'yawn', 'story', 'was', 'superb', 'great', 'thrills', 'suspense', 'thing', 'intrigued', 'most', 'was', 'story', 'had', 'realistic', 'touch', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'miss']",N/A

And that ending alone elevates this flick way above the usual genre movies that parade under the guise of 'horror.' When customers at a general store discover that there are some terrifying monsters on the loose, then they all react in different ways.Probably the most hysterical character is the black man, portrayed by Andre Braugher, who, for no reason at all, goes into a major hissy fit about racism when hero Thomas Jane, and others, try to persuade him to go with them to the rear of the store, to see for himself that there are evil creatures out there in the mist. He has been the major doubter that there is anything supernatural about the mist, although he has seen for himself the deaths of several customers.He bulges his eyes, stomps his feet and thunders out a lecture about hwo they're treating him like a moran because of his race. You keep wondering: what planet is this creep on? Everyone in the store is in danger of being slaughtered by the creepy monsters and here's this guy shrieking about being treated as a lower-grade of human. Strangely, when he and some others go out into the mist to seek safety, we're never told of their fates. Were they eaten alive?Another approach that highly irritated me was the oozing love and affection and protection shown to Thomas Jane's son. The kid is treated like this rare and delicate blossom who must never be left alone. Thomas Jane, by the way, was perfectly cast. He's strong, convincing and sympathetic.The ending is one of the most unforgettable in sci-fi/horror film history. I won't divulge anything about it but when you see it, your heart just drops.

Thomas Jane gives the same performance he always does but it works as the befuddled, terrified and courageous Everyman David Draytonmakes a simple decision with tremendous consequences: he goes to the grocery store.The sheer mystery and grotesque nature of what goes on is convincing by virtue of the relatively banal, provincial setting: relations between annoying townsfolk and the ""artist"" (Drayton) escalate when the fantastic is finally introduced into their own lives.  The scene in which the teenage boy makes an unwise decision to be a tough guy in front of the other locals lets you know what you're in for.  Andre Braugher is in this movie for about five seconds and I have no idea why: he's such a great actor and I would have been curious as to how his character would have dealt with the situation if he hadn't denied it was happening, or thought it was an ""inside joke"" being played by the locals.  Scarier than the things outside, though, is the religious fanatic played by Marcia Gay Harden, known as Mrs. Carmody to anyone who even skimmed the novella: the ultimate bad religious, the most irritating and horrifying phenomena in perhaps the entire tale, she takes full advantage of the situation to impose her blasphemous view of the Old Testament on the dumbstruck crowd, turning them into bloodthirsty monsters.  When the young marine is offered up to the looming horror outside as ""Food for the Gods"", one can barely watch.But the ending: this is key here.

It's an entertaining if not a bit overly preachy and dramatic creature feature. I mean they are stuck in a store with creatures outside in the Mist and they also have to deal with a crazy woman who starts preaching to them about religion. It's okay to get people to believe in faith during situations like that but this woman goes overboard.I don't blame Thomas Jane and other characters for wanting to leave, she's controlling and clearly insane. What bugs me with the movie is how it ends. Are we supposed to believe that everyone should've stayed with this crazy woman who was willing to have her followers kill non-believers. So I was entertained by the movie and her character but I also don't think it should've been so much about faith. The creature part is so well done that as a slimy and gross film it's almost as good as the Thing.The end just brings the movie down since I saw Thomas Jane's character as a good man and the end just makes him look like an idiot for not believing in the crazy woman. To me I wouldn't want to be around this woman either yet follow her beliefs. It's not that I don't believe in god but the woman just isn't crazy but she's mean to everyone and stand offish and acts more evil than holy. Hell I expected her to be the lead creature. Despite me not liking how it ended I still think it's under-rated movie that was well done by the director.

A massive and violent thunderstorm pounds a small town in Maine and does tremendous damage. David Drayton (Thomas Jane) takes his young son and his neighbor into town to get supplies and to see what is going on as the power is out. While at the grocery/hardware store an all obscuring mist rolls in and takes visibility to zero. The store is full of customers and a man runs in screaming that there is something in the mist. A man who goes outside is heard screaming and the customers close the doors of the store and prepare for the worst.The customers separate into 3 main groups, those who want to leave, those who want to stay inside and a group forms around a fanatic telling everyone it is the end of days. The store's generator shuts down and a clerk goes out to fix it and he is killed by a monster that attacks. A few try to leave but they either disappear into the mist or are heard screaming as they die....Stephen King's imagination runs wild in this story and the result is a very good storyline full of terrifying creatures let loose into this world. I am a Stephen King fan and own just about everything the man has written and I loved this story.Unfortunately the director and screen writers take liberties with the storyline and change the ending to create some closure that the novella didn't do. I feel that the ending of the movie is just too sad and for me I did not enjoy the movie as well as I enjoyed the book. It is still worth watching but just be aware that if you read the book that the movie is different.This movie features great special effects and they are right out of Stephen King's imagination.

Get Sean Penn to believably play the leading man in a romantic comedy.#2. Get Kevin Costner the actor to play a role that even slightly differentiates from him being the real life Kevin Costner.#3. Successfully adapt a Stephen King horror film into a movie without completely sabotaging the script (see Kubrick's The Shining).Frank Darabont, while having formerly been able to adapt The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile with great success, and while Meathead (Rob Reiner) managed to do the same with King's The Body (which was adapted into Reiner's Stand By Me), the horror aspect of King's writing has provided many director's with very little success. A quick glance at past failures read likes a Who's Who of pathetic filmography:Cujo (1983)Silver Bullet (1985) - I actually like this oneMaximum Overdrive (1986)Needful Things (1993)The Dark Half (1993)Thinner (1996)1990's Misery and the pre 1980 King films notwithstanding, seldom has a director managed to pull of a successful adaptation, especially those King films that had dealt with the supernatural like 1983's The Dead Zone or 1989's Pet Sematary. It's not a knock on King, just a telling fact that his style of writing doesn't always translate well to modern film.Then came The Mist. Darabont sinks his teeth into this one and the result is a very entertaining film that will keep the viewer entrenched for the long run. If ever someone was capable of taking a King book and translating it to the big screen, Frank is the man; however, The Mist at times seems a little too forced and many of the characters simply seem hollow throughout, which contrasted with Darabont's former King films, is a bizarre observation to make considering Shawshank and The Green Mile were heavily inter-laden with character development. Here, however, the story is the main character, and the principle players seem nothing short of h'orderves for an ending that Darabont no doubt put together as the measuring stick for the entire film. I have to say, the ending of this film will stay with you and is as powerful a horror finale as I've ever seen.This ending is the result of a plot that deals with a tiny town in Maine, where perhaps fifty townsfolk, including a father (played by Thomas Jane) and his son, find themselves trapped in a grocery store when an ominous mist rips through town, bringing with it dangerous, unseen creatures that proceed to rip a number of the doubting townsfolk to pieces.

The story is about the horrors of a society that breaks down.  As heard in a dialogue exchange in the movie:  ""I truly believe that we are a civilized society"".  But the response is ""Yeah, or at least until the machines stop working and 9-1-1 isn't available.  Then we become primitive.""  Another character says ""Put more than two people in a room together and it becomes a battle to see who will be killed first.  That's why we invented politics and religion.""The character of religious zealot Mrs. Carmody will certainly rub many viewers the wrong way, in particular because her message is overwhelmed by her delivery.  Mix fundamentalist religion with a scared mob of people and you have a recipe for ""The Lord of the Flies"" and all other sorts of trouble.  She gets it in the end, but let's take another look at her message:Perhaps, just perhaps, there was some degree of truth in what she was saying about how the Sinners of the world brought this evil upon them.  (No, I'm not a religious nut.  I'm just thinking about this in terms of the story's narrative as it relates to the ending.)  SPOILER ALERT! ***  The so-called ""sinners"" refused to believe that the Evil in the mist was God's retribution for the sins of Man.  And those same ""sinners"" chose to make a run for it rather than to sit and wait to die.  The ""believers"", however, stood fast and didn't leave the relative safety of the supermarket.  And sure enough, the ""sinners"" met their various fates (the one who didn't die probably wishes he had) while the ""believers"" were rescued.  Could this have been God's way of separating the ""sinners"" from the ""believers"" and meting out His various forms of punishment on the ""sinners""?The so-called Sinners, for most of the film, came off looking like the only ones with a degree of wisdom and pragmatism.

1126801,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0010X73ZG,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 5]","Critically acclaimed writer and director Frank Darabont (""The Majestic"") has proven himself quite adept when it comes to crafting hit feature films based upon some of author Stephen King's best-selling novels. His previous attempts, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"", resulted in great critical and commercial responses upon being released to theaters, and have found a special place in the hearts and minds of many movie fans along with becoming valued parts of many movie collections. So, when Darabont chose his next film to be based upon the novella ""The Mist"", yet again written by horror-master Stephen King, expectations were understandably high in regards to his undeniable talent for crafting such excellent films based on novels, a task not easily accomplished by even the most gifted of writers or directors. The downside to being as successful as Frank Darabont has been in his previous adaptations is that, eventually he's bound to make one that doesn't quite resonate as strongly with his audience. Well, it seems that that moment has finally arrived with the release of the box office disappointment, ""The Mist"", starring Thomas Jane (""The Punisher"") and Marcia Gay Harden (""Mystic River"").""The Mist"" is the story of a small New England town, that one seemingly normal day becomes immersed in this mysterious mist that appeared out of nowhere. At first the local townspeople believed the mist to be nothing out of the ordinary, that is, until one of their neighbors comes storming into the local supermarket scared to death and bleeding profusely from wounds he claimed occurred via creatures hidden within the mist. Now, these ordinary, everyday people must try to stand together to fight a series of extraordinary enemies, while trying to maintain their own sanity and keep their fears from tearing them apart.I have enjoyed Frank Darabont's previous adaptations of Stephen King novels, I found the prison drama ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to be a very solid drama, with incredible acting and storytelling on display; although I don't consider it to be one of the greatest films ever made as some might. Darabont's next effort was the death row drama ""The Green Mile"", which to me, was the more superior film of the two Stephen King adaptations that he had made thus far. So, like many moviegoers I believed that his next attempt ""The Mist"" would be just as good, if not better, than the previous two; however, I was wrong.""The Mist"" is, for the most part, an entertaining drama with some horror mixed in from time-to-time. The story is well-paced, featuring plenty of strong character development, and very sharp, well-written dialogue, which is not surprising given Frank Darabont's acclaimed skills as a screenwriter. Where the movie goes wrong, for me at least, is in the final 30 minutes or so of the film. When the people trapped in the supermarket begin to pick sides, it seems realistic to the point that in most cases any human being is going to try to find like-minded individuals in desperate times, such as those depicted in this film; however, I find it somewhat unbelievable that after only being trapped in the supermarket for a mere two days the people would snap so easily with common sense and rationale to the point they were willing to kill over their differences rather than finding a way to survive. Also, the final closing moments of the film were a little too disturbing for me, and essentially removed any sense of entertainment I had been feeling towards this movie, thus causing me to dislike this movie a great deal. I understand that the ending was probably realistic under such dire circumstances, although I would think had I been in those characters' shoes, I wouldn't have made such a rash, and as it turned out, rather unfortunate decision until it was clear that there was no hope left, and even then I'm not sure I would have gone with it. Some of you readers out there may disagree with me on that, and that's fine, but I would think you'd have to admit that their reasoning for taking the actions they took seemed a little impulsive, especially when the strange noise they heard wasn't like all the previous ones, which they previously had no problem waiting to discover just what was making the noise, so the fact that they gave such a knee-jerk reaction seemed out of character for each of them in the scene. I know I'm being quite vague about my dislikes for this film, but if you haven't seen the movie, and are still planning on viewing it, I don't want to ruin the specifics of what takes place in the closing moments.The actors in ""The Mist"" were very talented group, each delivering very convincing, and believable performances given the strange circumstances occurring to the characters within the movie. Thomas Jane was a great choice to portray the loving father and impromptu leader of the trapped locals within the supermarket, as he created a very realistic character that was full of strong qualities mixed with a dose of arrogance that created a very palpable tension at times between him and some of his neighbors from the town. Marcia Gay Harden was surprisingly very convincing as the religious fanatic that feeds on the fears of her neighbors, seizing an opportunity to convert them to her beliefs of God, and isn't remotely bothered by the means in which she gains followers. The rest of the cast was comprised of various character actors, which I personally don't know the names of though I recognize them from other movies I've seen them in. Each of them did a wonderful job in bringing realism and a mostly neighborly quality to their characters. The downer to having such a solid cast in this movie is that when the craziness begins to set in around the halfway point in the film, some of the actors didn't really sell the change as convincingly as others and it really stood out in places, and was a bit of an annoyance for me.One aspect of ""The Mist"" that surprised me the most was the excellent CGI work done to create the monsters. Now, I wasn't surprised that the CGI was so well-crafted, I mean in this day of modern cinema there's just no excuse for bad CGI, but for me I didn't expect there to be all that much, if any, CGI to be used in the film. I wasn't aware that there were going to be monsters hidden in the mist, so that was a very welcome and enjoyable surprise. And kudos to the special effects department for creating such creepy, even somewhat disturbing, versions of our various insects and bugs; such as, spiders, flies, mosquitoes, and so on. I thought by including monsters with the mysterious mist (which may have been in the novella, I wouldn't know because I haven't read it) was a good way to separate this movie from ""The Fog"" which was a movie about another small town being plagued by a mysterious fog that brought death and despair to the townspeople.""The Mist"" was an entertaining drama/monster film for the first 90 minutes, but the last thirty minutes of the movie really brought the entire experience down for me. It's sad to have a movie that is so well-written, directed, and acted, be felled by somewhat unbelievable, and in some cases disturbing, plot twists to the point that I was glad when the credits rolled so I could soon begin erasing this movie from my mind. Some people will probably still enjoy ""The Mist"" regardless of the problems that plague the latter portion of the movie, but for me I'd rather watch the much better Stephen King adaptations from Frank Darabont, and put this one out of sight, and out of mind.""The Mist"" is rated R for violence and language.",2,Runaway From This Mist...,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,7605,"['Critically',

Oops. No such luck. Instead I found myself in a Stephen King movie, which was quite fine by me. I've enjoyed several of Stephen Kings other books and films including The Stand, Stand By Me, The Tommyknockers, and even the Langoliers, but I had never read this one. It begins with an inside joke where an artist is painting a movie poster for a Stephen King novel and has other famous movie posters displayed as if he had painted them. We meet the family, the neighbor, and soon, half the town. And then THE MIST rolls in.Most of THE MIST takes place in a supermarket and most of the movie is typical Stephen King. We get to know a group of ordinary people who start to show their true colors as the pressure mounts. And the pressure mounts, you betcha! We have all sorts of creatures coming out of the mist to eat our frugal shoppers. But we also have our very own annoying humans inside the store, including an ""unstable"" Christian woman who constantly preaches her own version of the Bible and the end-of-days. As the movie progresses, we lose more shoppers until... I can't give away the ending, but I do have to talk about the ending. It's a very bad ending. And, apparently, it wasn't Stephen King's original ending. It's an ending that belongs in a different kind of movie, not a jump-out-of-the-mist-and-go-boo! movie. I mean, THE MIST is a modern B-Movie, and we all have certain expectations that go along with those. For instance, when the boy and girl make out, we know they're the next to die. Check. When anyone smiles or think they've made it, they're about to die in a particularly gruesome way. Check. And when our heroes risk everything to put an end to what's been dogging them, we expect ... well, we know what we expect and that box was definitely left unchecked.If it weren't for the ending, I'd have gladly given THE MIST higher marks for knowing that it was a Saturday matinee monster movie. Unfortunately, at the very last minute, it tried to be something more important, which is exactly what I did not want.Stephen King himself is quoted as saying, ""The ending is such a jolt--wham! It's frightening. But people who go to see a horror movie don't necessarily want to be sent out with a Pollyanna ending.""

1126805,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B0010X73ZG,- Kasia S.,"[16, 19]","I thought that this movie was a lot of fun! There was the usual mayhem that arises very quickly when people are trapped in one place together, within a day or two in books and movies they start acting crazy and give aliens and monsters reasons to mock us, for trying to end our lives when things go wrong or there is no way out. Well this was no exception, when a small Maine town ( hey it's a King story, of course it's in Maine) gets enveloped in a thick, cloying mist, those fortunate enough who have escaped early can wave goodbye to their friends and family members because something strange is happening and the chances of any survivors are glum.When David Drayton and his son make a quick trip to the supermarket for supplies after an electrical storm, they have no idea that the store will be their salvation and damnation at the same time. Once the store door closes and the fog closes in, screams in the distance tell everyone that this is no ordinary case of bad weather, not only is it mysterious but it houses creepy creatures that honestly scared and shocked me. The first time David encounters the blood hungry things in the mist is an unforgettable experience, paranoia adds another layer of terror as people who don't believe him need to see it for themselves and that is the beginning of the end. This horror flick was a lot of fun but also kept me in great suspense for almost the entire time, a little draining but worth it except I don't recommend getting too attached to any characters....some of them didn't last very long, and the ways their last moments ended were truly excruciating.The movie was pretty fast paced; the acting realistic enough and the creatures were not all CG, so that was refreshing. Highly recommended for lovers of suspense and terror and of course banging endings, this one was shocking and quite honestly very raw, almost painful in a strange way when no amount of relief the ending brought could erase the events that perspired before the last minutes.- Kasia S.",5,You don't want to know what lurks in the mist...,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,2012,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'was', 'usual', 'mayhem', 'very', 'quickly', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'trapped', 'one', 'place', 'together', 'day', 'two', 'books', 'movies', 'start', 'acting', 'crazy', 'give', 'aliens', 'monsters', 'reasons', 'mock', 'trying', 'end', 'lives', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'way', 'out', 'Well', 'was', 'exception', 'when', 'small', 'Maine', 'town', 'hey', 'King', 'story', 'course', 'Maine', 'enveloped', 'thick', 'cloying', 'mist', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'who', 'have', 'escaped', 'early', 'can', 'wave', 'goodbye', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'something', 'strange', 'happening', 'chances', 'survivors', 'are', 'glum.When', 'David', 'Drayton', 'son', 'make', 'quick', 'trip', 'supermarket', 'supplies', 'electrical', 'storm', 'have', 'idea', 'store', 'will', 'be', 'salvation', 'damnation', 'same', 'time', 'store', 'door', 'closes', 'fog', 'screams', 'distance', 'tell', 'everyone', 'ordinary', 'case', 'bad', 'weather', 'not', 'only', 'mysterious', 'houses', 'creepy', 'creatures', 'honestly', 'scared', 'shocked', 'first', 'time', 'David', 'blood', 'hungry', 'things', 'mist', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'paranoia', 'layer', 'terror', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'need', 'see', 'beginning', 'end', 'horror', 'flick', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'also', 'kept', 'great', 'suspense', 'almost', 'entire', 'time', 'little', 'draining', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'too', 'attached', 'characters', '.some', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'ways', 'last', 'moments', 'ended', 'were', 'truly', 'excruciating.The', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'fast', 'paced', 'acting', 'realistic', 'enough', 'creatures', 'were', 'not', 'CG', 'was', 'refreshing', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'lovers', 'suspense', 'terror', 'course', 'banging', 'endings', 'one', 'was', 'shocking', 'quite', 'honestly', 'very', 'raw', 'almost', 'painful', 'strange', 'way', 'when', 'amount', 'relief', 'ending', 'brought', 'could', 'erase', 'events', 'perspired', 'last', 'minutes.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",N/A

Lots of tension. Great special effects. Most of the deaths appeared to be excruciating. I love when a group destabilizes into a mob. It's always fascinating for me to watch civility drop away and mob mentality kick in. Many Steven King movies are not worth your time but this one is. There were a handful of moments when I was practically screaming, ""Why is nobody saying the clear truth?! Why aren't they already running?! What are they waiting for?! How are they failing to see the obvious?!"" But I think that's the curse of most horror films. There are gaps in logic either in the plot or the characters themselves. But then, I've actually been in many very bad, crisis situations in life so I suppose I'm cursed to nitpick. You have to let that roll off so you can enjoy the show. As a father, I found the ending to be utterly horrific. It was a mental kick in the teeth for me as I tried to imagine myself in the hero's place.

This is how the story goes: Following a violent thunderstorm, artist David Drayton and a small town community come under vicious attack from creatures prowling in a thick and unnatural mist.

Retreating to a local supermarket, Drayton and the survivors must face-off against each other before taking a united stand against an enemy they cannot even see.

1126820,A2O91YORQH16L5,B0010X73ZG,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[4, 7]","I really take my hat off to Stephen King for coming up with the thrilling story about a bunch of townfolks battling with some blood-thirsty monsters coming out of a myserious mist engulfing a supermarket in the movie, 'The Mist'.To me, he is indisputably a great suspense maestro.[I had enjoyed watching many of Stephen King's earlier masterpieces, including 'Carrie', 'Pet Semantary', 'The Sleepwalkers', 'The Thing', & 'The Fog'. In fact, 'The Mist' bore some resemblance to 'The Fog'.]Yesterday evening, my gym buddy asked me about what movie we could go & watch, & I told him that the only one I thought worthwhile would only be 'The Mist', after going through all the newspaper ads.The movie had both of us glued tightly to the edge of our seats for some two solid hours in the movie theatre at the Jurong Entertainment Centre. My buddy was so excited that he even ignored the call of nature till the very last minute of the movie's ending, when he had to rush to the gent's for a quick leak.The movie started off with a freak thunderstorm overnight. Our hero, probably an artist (played by Thomas Jane, whom I last saw as FBI agent turned vigilante, Frank Castle, in the action movie, 'The Punisher'), his wife & young kid saw their home, located in the vicinity of a beautiful lake, badly damaged on the next morning.There was an uprooted tree. Another fallen tree had crashed into a boat quay at the lake. In the far distance across the lake horizon, they saw a seemingly vast, but definitely unusual, mist looming on the lake surface.Together with their neighbour, whose Mercedes convertible was badly smashed up by an uprooted tree, our hero & his young kid went into town to pick up some emergency supplies. The wife was left behind.As they drove towards the town, they saw a convoy of military, fire-fighting & police vehicles rushing to go somewhere.As I listened to their casual conversation in the car, which turned to strange cues like 'nearby military base', 'Project Arrowhead', 'missile defence research', 'crashed flying saucer with frozen alien bodies', then I knew the movie was going to be really fun & exciting, even though I did not understand what it was all about.At the supermarket, a lot of townfolks was busy gathering their purchases.Three army soldiers then walked quietly into the supermarket, followed by a military policeman in close pursuit. They huddled at one corner, while I overheard the policeman telling the soldiers that their leave was cancelled & they had to return to base.In the next scene, an elderly man with a bloody nose & blood on his clothes rushed into the supermarket & yelled that something in the mist had grabbed his pal. He urged the staff to close the main door quickly.Outside the supermarket, the mysterious mist had thickened further & gradually engulfing the entire building.The building then started to shake violently in the next few scenes, with most of the ceiling panels & fluorescent lamps flying around.Next, the now frightened & bewildered townfolks trapped inside the supermarket realised that something was not right. The staff rushed to close the main door.I must say, the movie director certainly knew his craft very well, as he took his own sweet time to build up visually the suspense all the way from the beginning segment of the movie.Our hero meanwhile wandered into the generator room at the back of the supermarket. It was dark & he bumped his head. He heard something hitting the roller shutters at the rear loading dock. To him, he definitely sensed that there was something quite sinister out there.The next few scenes were some of the most pulsating action sequences of the movie. Gory & nauseating, too! That's why the movie was rated NC-16.Well, to all readers out there, I reckon you just have to go & watch this suspenseful movie to catch the remaining exciting plot, with all kinds of fiery monsters, big ones, small ones & even tiny ones, creating havoc inside the supermarket & nearby pharmacy.Worst of all, in all the confusion, there was this mad lady, holding a bible, talking about the end of days. Not too long later, her message began to affect some of the badly shaken townfolks, who then started to turn against each other. To me, they, the believers, were deadlier than all those crazy monsters coming out of the mist.Somewhere towards the middle of the movie, I began to put some pieces of the puzzle together, when the military policeman we saw earlier was found half-dead in some sort of a silky cocoon in the nearby pharmacy. Before he died, with thousands of small spiders crawling out of his physical body, he uttered some thing to the effect that the army had screwed up something that had created the diabolical mess in the town.Two of the three soldiers we saw earlier had also committed suicide at the back of the supermarket. The remaining solder was finally cornered & killed by the believers, & his body was thrown out of the main door, in an attempt to appease whoever or whatever was out there.It seemed that the army had unwittingly discovered a 'window' to another dimension, which those alien creatures had used to enter our world.Frankly, I did not like the ending part, although I was intrigued by the six-legged behemoth still lurking happily in the background. Somewhat shocking & unexpected, to say the least.Maybe, there's some kind of a message to all of us as human beings. Maybe, there's something else. Well, I reckon it serves as food for thought.In the end analysis, I must say that the cinematography involving all the seemingly out-of-this-world monsters - sliding, crawling, straddling, flying; some had squid-like tentacles, some even spitted acidic fumes, but all had one thing in common - they loved human blood! - inside & outside the supermarket was the best I have ever seen in recent months.I have truly enjoyed watching 'The Mist'. My buddy, too. He added that the two solid hours were well spent for the evening.",5,"I really take my hat off to Stephen King. I have truly enjoyed watching 'The Mist'.

1126831,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0010X73ZG,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","I adore Stephen King books and I consider ""Mist"" as one of his masterpieces but to my great surprise and delight this adaptation by Frank Darabont actually IMPROVED the original story! And this is not an easy thing to improve the work of such a master! In fact many Stephen King works (including masterpieces) were wrecked once filmed (just consider the horrible fate of ""Pet Sematary"" or ""Children of the Corn"") - well not this time ladies and gentlemen! Here we have a work on the same level as in ""Shawshank redemption"" and ""Green mile"", which is only normal considering that Frank Darabont directed those movies too.I do not want to provide spoilers, but simply by looking at the cover of the DVD you already know that the mist is the key element of this story, and that the action will mostly take place in a supermarket - and also that for the people trapped inside, leaving the said supermarket is not really an option, because of the above mentioned mist... The rest is for you to discover...Any Constant Reader of Stephen King will probably howl with delight during the first scene of this movie - I certainly did! Also please do not miss the title of the newspaper one of the customers is reading in the waiting line in the supermarket just at the beginning of the movie - it is a very pleasant joke addressed to Constant Readers..)) I liked it very much.However the jokes and delights will end quickly. This is a VERY tough and extremely dark horror movie, with a great lot of death and suffering - including many of the most likable characters! And after all this comes the ending, which is as shocking as the crucial moments in ""Seven"" and ""Shutter Island"". It WILL shock you and probably hurt you - so beware and in fact if you feel a little bit down or vulnerable, you should absolutely postpone watching ""The mist"" until a better moment! That is a serious warning - please do not take it lightly!King's short story ""The mist"" had some elements which I always considered as weak spots and didn't like (although I absolutely love the whole story) and Frank Darabont made the choice of not correcting them, to stay faithful to the original text. I think he made a honorable choice, although King's obvious dislike of US armed forces is the only weak spot in this otherwise extraordinary story - me for one I simply refuse to believe that in a situation of extreme danger for civilians, highly trained professional soldiers (all volunteers!) who swore a solemn oath to protect the citizens of their republic from any danger, just abandon helpless women and children and choose the cowards way out! But this is just one minor glitch and after all stranger things happen...Frank Darabont changed however the original story by developing more the character of ""the enemy inside"" and especially by extending the story beyond the original ending, which was already shocking, but finally left the final fate of the heroes a mystery... In the movie there is a real ending and it is a very surprising and extremely painful one - it is even more horrible than any ending in Stephen King's books! But I believe this is a necessary thing, because this achieves the lesson we learn - and this movie in my perception is a very Christian one, unlike the original story. And here are the Christian teachings which I identified in ""The mist"":1) ""Beware of false prophets who are like wolves coming dressed in sheep skins"" (beginning and middle of the movie)2) ""Thou shalt never deliver God's children in sacrifice to Moloch!!"" (second part of the movie)3) The suicide is a deadly sin!!and last but not least!4) Hope is a major Christian virtue - so if you abandon yourself to despair, beware, because this is even worse than sin - IT IS AN ERROR!!This movie shocked me horribly but also made me think a lot and I count it as one of the best modern horror films and one of the finest cinematographic adaptations of Stephen King prose.

King has such a knack for portraying peoples inner self and the dynamics of personalities in a very dire, very tense group setting.

1126835,A3TGCEFBB71MMR,B0010X73ZG,Mark Antony,"[2, 3]","I've always considered The Mist Stephen King's finest piece of work. A mini novel, or long short story, whichever way you think of it, the book was inspired after King was waiting in line with his son at a Supermarket, and the story idea came to him. He observed the attitude of the people waiting, and their moods. To King, everything is an inspiration..The Mist brings to life your worst nightmares, which could not possibly happen..But what if it DID happen? When horror stories affect people in ordinary life, everyday situations, it makes them more believable and scary at the same time, because the audience can associate themselves in it, and imagine how they themselves might well react.When David Drayton and his Son are trapped inside a supermarket during an unprecidented fog, it becomes evident terrible creatures are inside the fog, this phenomina unleashed after a terrible storm. Drayton has to decide if he and his son are at more danger inside the market from the other people there, increasingly under the influence of the eccentric Mrs. Carmody, or attempting to break out and face the creatures. The book offers no explanation, only inferences. The film takes on an ending of it's own, with the writers approval.Horror of this magnitude is better left inside the mind, which is why I think the book will never be surpassed by the film. Also, the casting is strange in some ways, Mrs Carmody for example is much younger than described in the book, manager Ollie Weeks much older. Cantankerous next door neighbour Brent Norton, for some reason, is nothing like the character described by King.It has not taken so many years to bring The Mist to film for no reason. It's so hard to do justice to a subject such as this. There will be moments of pure look away horror for the viewer, but it's my hope that the improvised ending will not leave too many dissatisfied. The ending, in a case like this, is something which can never be explained to any degreee of satisfaction, too many people will simply reject it.

He achieves a bit of both actually in this terribly endearing Seventies-feel Sci-Fi schlock fest.First up, Darabont cleverly doesn't go for big names in the lead roles - there are faces in there you'll recognize (William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn - who were both in the mighty ""Shawshank Redemption"" for instance), but it's mostly actors you vaguely know or don't recognize at all. It has the effect of making their predicament more real - ordinary townsfolk locked into a battle for survival - where common sense quickly takes a back seat and bravery becomes a luxury few are willing to deploy...Here how it goes - the Army's been experimenting up in the mountains (aren't they always) and have unleashed something nasty on our world (don't they always). As the 'mist' creeps in over a small US town after an unnatural storm, half the not-so-bright populace gets trapped in the local supermarket where it becomes quickly evident that it's probably not a good idea to go outside into the dense creeping fog, because people who do tend to either not come back or get eaten. Ropes that were attached to torsos - fall limp, there's a sound; a scream and someone's entrails end up on the potato chips stand...(thoughtless of them you have to say)...All the usual elements are in place - the irritating stupid ones who do something they shouldn't and end up as fodder, the lying Army types covering their uniformed asses, the wise old ones who sacrifice for the young, the cowardly big talkers who then sit in corners and whinge - the women who are ballsier and brainier than the men - all manner of parents who are just trying to protect their families...the resourcefulness and guts of those who do fight back and win...Darabont also cleverly ratchets up the tension by having no music for ages so that when the sinister synth drone does kick in - it really kicks in - and when the wailing vocals of Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance on ""The Host of Seraphim"" comes in towards the end - it has the emotional impact of a fist in the face. It's on an album called (not surprisingly) ""The Serpent's Egg""...Toby Jones is superb as the grounded Supermarket owner, Thomas Jane as the father who must keep safe his son at all costs and Andre Braugher as his difficult neighbour who doesn't buy into the hysteria and conspiracy theories and pays the webbed price.But the film belongs to Marcia Gay Harden who is stunningly effective as the town's religious zealot who seizes her it's-the-wrath-of-God moment with non-stop apocalyptical-jabbering. Of course after two days of ranting about sins and the End of the World and her being God's conduit, she begins to make twisted sense to the terrified folks desperate to placate the beasties outside. Enter the inevitable Lord Of The Flies scenario - a sacrifice must be made...There's something terribly old-fashioned about The Mist. It wants to make your girlfriend go ""yew!"" a lot and it achieves this on several occasions with genuinely squeamish aplomb. Coming over a bit like an Irwin Allen Seventies epic, The Mist is basically a very, very good B-movie.For Blu Ray owners - the special effect creatures are Jurassic Park meets Alien meets the bug scene in King Kong - creepy, scary and deliciously icky. The Blu Ray images are really clean and crisp and even when huge things lurk over cars in a blurry haze, you still see their monstrous outlines and 'feel' their size as the pumped-up audio does its thing. The 'black and white' version on Disc 2 is even creepier and a very clever addition.By the time the unexpected and staggeringly downbeat ending finally comes (some have truly hated this though) - you know someone has done their job right, because you've been rightly and royally entertained. And more importantly - you've rooted for these people - so much so that you end up thinking about them and their decisions - days later...Recommended.",5,"""Don't Go Out There!

Ok, so I stole that line from the hilarious ""Ruthless People."" Still, it would have made the only truly sensible line in the movie.Through out this movie the characters do things or fail to do things that no one in their right mind would or would not do in a crisis situation.  Plus you get the Bible thumping zealot who shows up in just about every Stephen King adaptation movie these days and it is really getting rather tiresome, even if you don't like religious zealots.  Enough!  There are many situations that are just downright stupid and I'll point a couple of them out:1.  Going to the pharmacy next door to get pain killers for a guy who has been injured and is in terrible pain.  Knowing that everyone who steps foot outside the door and into the mist ends up dying violently, why would at least 1/2 dozen people go to get the drugs when, at most it might take two heros for this mission?2.  When the star and starlet decide it's time to go, there's eight people who go out into the mist to get into our hero's SUV.  Of course half of these people don't make it.  Um... if YOU or I were leading this courageously stupid group of people, would it not make more sense for 1 or 2 people to make a run for the truck and then drive it right up to the doors to collect the others? I mean, what father in his right mind would risk his 8 year old son so recklessly when the kid could simply wait inside for the truck to pull up? Ridiculous.The Mist is one of my all-time favorite short stories. If memory serves me correctly (it's been at least 20 years since I read it), the mist is never explained and that's part of the story's magic.  In the movie, we get the tired old ""the military was messing with stuff it had no business messing with"" explanation. Why was there a need to explain it?The acting was good, the effects were pretty good, especially the flying creatures being torched in the store.  Then again, wouldn't YOU or I have had the common sense to have a fire extinguisher handy so as not to burn down our shelter?  These are really STUPID characters.When the bag boy is being pulled off the loading dock by the tentacles, wouldn't it have made since to simply lower the loading dock door, thereby severing the tentacles? Wouldn't YOU or I have at least TRIED that approach?  More stupidity.  These folks don't deserve to survive in a survival of the fittest world.  Makes one wonder how they managed to stay alive throughout life.The logical arguments with the attorney are just lame. No one would be THAT stupid after being shown that tentacle with all the teeth.The irony in the ending just seemed like the screen play writer was trying way to hard too do something shocking.

I picked it up because it has this great cover of some tentacle reaching up under a door and boasted of a ""fully surround sound experience"".The Mist was directed by Frank Darabont who directed The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Two Stephen King books that translated very well onto the big screen. I was looking forward to another Darabont/King collaboration.Starring Thomas Jane (The Punisher) as David Drayton, Marcia Gay Harden (Mystic River) as the religious-crazed Mrs. Carmody, Laurie Holden (Silent Hill) as Amanda Dumfries, and William Sadler (The Green Mile) as Jim this movie was held to a strict budget and time frame which created the perfect mentality for a horror film.Following a freak electrical storm, a mist creeps into a small town. David and his son travel to the grocery store the next day for supplies. While there a man, bleeding from his nose, comes running in warning the people to stay away from the mist.The crowd looks on as the mist envelops the parking lot.There are those who aren't sure what to do, some who want to go home to their children, and others who think something sinister at work. Mrs. Carmody believes it's the wrath of God come upon the town for their sins. Before the end of the film, she will have converted a large following to her beliefs.How will anyone escape the mist? Whenever someone tries to escape to their car, they are ""taken"" or eaten by whatever inhabits the mist.There is alot of foul language in this movie and the graphic content is high as well.

1126841,A2CVOAWC4OAKL2,B0010X73ZG,Matthew B. Cravens,"[1, 1]","Up until the point that I saw this film, the best Stephen King adaptation that I had seen was the spectacular ""Misery"".  Once the lights went up on this one though, my mind had changed on that.  ""The Mist"" is the best Stephen King adaptation to date.  Yes, it even beats other adaptations such as ""The Shining"".  The story is very simple; after a thunderstorm a strange looking soupy mist descends on a small town.  Several townsfolk find themselves barricaded very quickly in a supermarket after something in the mist starts attacking people in the town.  The movie centers around the characters' inner struggles with themselves as well as the predicament that they find themselves in, as well as with eachother.  The acting is brilliant and first-rate, particulary Marcia Gay-Harden's appearance as a Jim Jones type religious fanatic.  Each and every performance is authentic and filled with heart and emotion.  The suspense is the edge-of-your-seat variety.  And there is no shortage of shock-value either.  The creatures that roll into town with the mist are bizarre, gruesome and eye-popping.  As far as the controversial ending that differs so greatly from the novella, there is absolutely nothing bad about it and it fits perfectly with the nature and direction of the film.  If you were expecting a ""Mary Poppins"" type of ending, then you were at the wrong movie.  This movie is a dark, brooding film.  When you look at the context and the flow of the movie, the ending makes sense, although there is absolutely no question that it is shocking and will have you doing a double-take at the screen.  The point of it all, which the movie illustrates is, that there is no escape from the mist.  The mist slowly engulfs and takes over every character in some way or another in the film.  The movie does have a few flaws, but not enough that it's not worth your money.  A highly recommended film, ""The Mist"" packs a wallop.",5,Watch Out For The Mist,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,1925,"['Up', 'point', 'saw', 'film', 'best', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptation', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Misery', 'lights', 'went', 'up', 'one', 'though', 'mind', 'had', 'changed', 'Mist', 'best', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptation', 'date', 'Yes', 'even', 'other', 'adaptations', 'such', 'Shining', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'thunderstorm', 'strange', 'looking', 'soupy', 'mist', 'descends', 'small', 'town', 'Several', 'townsfolk', 'find', 'barricaded', 'very', 'quickly', 'supermarket', 'something', 'mist', 'attacking', 'people', 'town', 'movie', 'centers', 'characters', 'inner', 'struggles', 'as', 'well', 'predicament', 'find', 'as', 'well', 'eachother', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'first-rate', 'particulary', 'Marcia', 'Gay-Harden', 'appearance', 'Jim', 'Jones', 'type', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'performance', 'authentic', 'filled', 'heart', 'emotion', 'suspense', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'variety', 'shortage', 'shock-value', 'creatures', 'roll', 'town', 'mist', 'are', 'bizarre', 'gruesome', 'eye-popping', 'As', 'far', 'controversial', 'ending', 'differs', 'so', 'greatly', 'novella', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'bad', 'perfectly', 'nature', 'direction', 'film', 'were', 'expecting', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'type', 'ending', 'then', 'were', 'wrong', 'movie', 'movie', 'dark', 'brooding', 'film', 'When', 'look', 'context', 'flow', 'movie', 'ending', 'sense', 'absolutely', 'question', 'shocking', 'will', 'have', 'doing', 'double-take', 'screen', 'point', 'movie', 'escape', 'mist', 'mist', 'slowly', 'engulfs', 'over', 'character', 'way', 'film', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'flaws', 'not', 'enough', 'not', 'worth', 'money', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'Mist', 'wallop']",N/A

I was also not a huge fan of Thomas Jane from watching The Punisher. But, in the last few years, I've become a big Darabont fan from watching The Walking Dead and finding out he'd directed some other films I'd come to love. And although I still am not a fan of the heavy CGI creature creation, this movie still impressed me on a few other fronts; the cast, the script, and the plot. I couldn't have been more wrong about Jane's acting ability as it is truly brought out by Darabont's script here. The guy is phenomenal. The whole cast is, really. But for me, Marcia Gay Harden stands out as the crazy and Bible-thumping Mrs. Carmody. You just love to hate her because she plays the part so well. I'm a big fan of films with inner workings and deeper meanings, like The Dark Knight Rises, and I instantly saw it all in this film. I actually have a hard time seeing The Mist as a horror film because of it's deeper message. If you're like me and like FILM and not just movies, you enjoy something like this for much more than is on the surface. This is another film that touches the reality of human nature, and I love that.

1126846,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B0010X73ZG,M. Dog,"[5, 9]","The Good: Awesome (and I do no use that term lightly) special effects. The monsters in this film were designed by the great Bernie Wrightson, and they are terrifying, diverse and original. The effects were created with a combination of CGI AND models using stop-action animation, and they are really jaw-dropping. This combo of techniques raises the effects above the weightless CGI clutter seen in most films. This is one of the few films about which I can honestly say is worth watching for the special effects and the monsters.The Bad: All the bad that is inherent in Stephen King's novels - meaning cardboard characters and glaringly writerly dialogue; all which serve as a platform Mr. King's childish politics. The characters always feel like ""types"" and the dialogue he gives them always feels like sudden speeches out of the blue. Nothing ever, ever feels real or natural. With King, folks are very bad (meaning conservative or religious) or very good (meaning liberal and vaguely undeclared religiously). His heroes are always full of jibes and speeches contemptuous of politics, the ""govment,"" and any remotely organized religion. His villains are always quoting the Bible (usually from the Book of Revelations), work for the United States Government/Military, or are intolerant rural (always rural) racists. He also likes to throw in a ""strong, independent woman"", usually middle aged, completely non-sexual, with a heavy, Maine/northeastern accent, in every novel for good measure.The Ugly: Without giving up the end, suffice to say it is an ending done by a filmmaker determined at any cost to have a shocking ending. I dislike a tacked-on happy ending as much as the next person, and so much of king is soaked in sugar, but this film's conclusion is ugly just for the sake of ugliness.So ugly, in fact, it left me wondering if perhaps the filmmaker was telling us the ""crazy"" zealot was right all along: perhaps the mist really is a God wrought punishment, and God really is the vengeful Old Testament God, pointing his bloody finger at, well, who exactly? The brave and the liberal? A confused, cheap-shot ending, to say the least.Recommended for the monsters (who seem better scripted than the humans) and nothing else. --Mykal BantaPost-script: It seems the near fatal auto accident that Mr. King suffered seems to have completely upset him in some troublesome ways. The author now finds it perfectly acceptable to have his ""good guys"" shoot those characters he doesn't like in the face, at close range, in cold blood. There is, of course, the obligitory explainations of ""having no choice,"" but this is nonsense. None of Stephen King's heros seems to understand the concept of a warning or wounding shot, which in the situation depicted in the film would have had devastating effect. Perhaps this was a filmmaker's addition, but none the less, post-accident King seems to revel in ugly brutality in ways pre-accident King would not have.

Once there, the mist that they saw rolling across the lake has made it into town and engulfs the store.  The terror level is upped when a man runs into the store with blood on his face, screaming that there is something out there.  Indeed, there is, and soon those trapped in the store see what it is.  To make matters worse, a religious fanatic by the name of Mrs. Carmody (Harden) is stirring up some of the customers with her talk of the end of the world.  David finds himself looked to for guidance, and when things seem to be as bad as they can be, things get worse.Director Frank Darabont takes another stab at a Stephen King story, this time a horror story, and succeeds quite well.  Like ""The Shawshank Redemprion"" and ""The Green Mile"", ""The Mist"" is a faithful adaptation of the source material, with an added on ending that may or may not work for viewers.  I, for one, enjoy endings of this nature, but am not sure that it was the right ending to tack on the end of this particular story.  The acting is solid all around, especially Marcia Gay Harden as the disturbing Mrs. Carmody.  The film has its share of monsters, but the scariest ones are inside the store, not outside it.

1126851,AN8M401S8Y6DA,B0010X73ZG,Mike Liddell,"[126, 144]","On the two disc edition of The Mist, on disc 2 there is a glorious Black and White version of the film, with an introduction by the director Frank Darabont.  Darabont says he originally wanted The Mist to be in B&W; and be a throwback to the 50's and 60's horror movies such asNight of the Living Dead, which I felt it had a lot in common with.  Darabont says this can be considered his director's cut.  I knew he directed two other King favoritesThe Shawshank Redemption (Two-Disc Special Edition)andThe Green Mile, but I didn't realize his other contributions to the horror genre, until I checked out IMDB.  Starting in 1980 as a production assistant onHell Nightand going on to write the screenplays forA Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors,The Blob,The Fly II (Collector's Edition), andMary Shelley's Frankenstein.The Mist is an entertaining, at times infuriating, tragic horror film filled with fun scares in the form of 50s and 60s era monsters lurking in the mist outside and the uglier monsters inside that apply to our present day, a true creature double feature.Darabont reminded me of Romero and his use of horror and social commentary.  Here he makes an atmospheric horror movie, our main character, David Drayton, played by, Thomas Jane, (Deep Blue Sea) designs posters for horror movies, followed by a big storm, and ultimately has David and his son (mom at home) trapped in a supermarket with the towns people.  Similar to the mall inDawn of the Dead [Blu-ray] evil lurks outside the market, not in the form of zombies that can be seen, but old school monsters that lurk out in the mist.  That's the surface of the film, but as we go through the layers we find much more, such as the monsters that lurk inside the supermarket.  Human nature, when afraid and backed into a corner and the role the military plays once the smoke clears are some of the movie's other factors.The Black and White Version is the way to go, to get that old school feel the director intended, even the way the title on the dvd is written is like an old monster movie.

OK, you knew that when the minor character walked off into the mist with a rope around his waist that not all of him was coming back.  OK, You knew the giant arm-thing under the bay door was going to eat the sweet guy. But, guys, I didn't guess the ending.  I didn't particularly like it, but I didn't guess it.Now, let's get intellectual for a moment.  The real horror in this tale is not the monsters but the human reaction to being in the situation.

In the store filled with a bunch of crazy people who are about to sacrifice you for their religious beliefs or outside taking your chances with the creatures of the mist? I think we should ask ourselves who the real monsters are.Theres seems to be a lot of debate over the display of humanity and religion in the movie. I think Darabont intended to represent Mrs. Carmody not as what a strong Christian would be like during tense situations but as someone who uses religion as the reason for what they are doing whether it is good or bad, wrong or right. I believe when someone brings religion into a situation, they intend for it to do good, but it can and most times come off as being something people would say is wrong(especially sacrificing someone). The relation was displayed good in the movie.As far as the movie as a whole goes, it was pretty good. The acting was alright but could have used some work. I thought the creatures looked good and I was interested in the whole military operation part of it. I wish there could have been more said about that.

I am not a big Stephen King fan, but I am always impressed by his ability to show us the monster within us, that being much more dastardly and devious and dangerous than any other creature that might pop out from under our bed.This movie started out much like any other Stephen King movie, a group of people are trapped by unseen forces (in MAINE!), they break into factions quickly, those that believe quick action is best, those that think waiting it out is best, those that aren't thinking much at all, just shaking in fear in the corner praying.  Soon they discover a bit of what they are facing, but as time goes on, fear takes over and it becomes apparent that it is much more dangerous to remain inside with the others than to risk your life to the unseen monsters outside.  That sure says a lot about us as a society.This movie made me wonder how I would handle myself in a similar situation, because other than the giant flying bugs and creatures with fangs, this sort of crisis could happen at any time. Natural disasters happen and so can being trapped with others, and as people get hungrier, more desperate, they might do anything, and things can always turn into a sort of modern day witch hunt, as we look to blame and seek solutions in unlikely ways.  I love a movie that makes me think, even if it's disturbing!All in all, I really liked this film.  I liked that it made me think.  I didn't like what it says about us as humans, but, hey...the truth hurts!  It was disturbing, made me cry, and I probably won't be watching it again.  Do I think it's worth seeing...YES!

However, if the movie title evokes memories of John Carpenter's `The Fog' and its risible recent remake, don't be fooled.  Firstly, the horror when it happens is more intense, and secondly the movie sets out to be much more than just another creature feature.So what happens?  It's a standard small Stephen King-style American town, following a storm.  A cross section of the town's society are in the supermarket when a mysterious fog rolls in - then a man runs out of the mist with blood on his face saying `there are things in the mist - they took my friends'.  So, the townsfolk hole up in the supermarket, and then follows the fascinating part of the movie. The creatures make their presence known, and an explanation of sorts for their appearance presents itself, but that is hardly the point.  It is the interaction of the townsfolk as they polarize, latent resentments surface and they feel the need to unite under a cause or leader, that the movie focuses on.  If the unhinged bible-basher is somewhat over the top (if not downright offensive) it is more than made up by a great cast, acting their hearts out - even a remarkably good Thomas Jane.  The controversial ending I think is perfectly in tone with this theme of exploring what people will do, and transcends the film from a mere creature feature or straight to DVD King movie, to a genuinely interesting piece of work that will spark thoughts and conversation long after the movie is over.All in all, a thumbs up to this one, with gore in places and a moderate air of tension, but stirred to great effect with an interesting exploration of human nature.",4,Satisfyingly Mist-erious,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,1791,"['Frank', 'Darabont', 'Stephen', 'King', 'third', 'collaboration', 'return', 'expected', 'territory', 'Stephen', 'King', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'tightly', 'wound', 'horror', 'Darabont', 'However', 'movie', 'title', 'evokes', 'memories', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Fog', 'risible', 'recent', 'remake', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'Firstly', 'horror', 'when', 'more', 'intense', 'secondly', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'creature', 'what', 'standard', 'small', 'Stephen', 'King-style', 'American', 'town', 'following', 'storm', 'cross', 'section', 'town', 'society', 'are', 'supermarket', 'when', 'mysterious', 'fog', 'rolls', 'then', 'man', 'mist', 'blood', 'face', 'saying', 'are', 'things', 'mist', 'took', 'friends', 'So', 'townsfolk', 'hole', 'up', 'supermarket', 'then', 'fascinating', 'part', 'movie', 'creatures', 'make', 'presence', 'known', 'explanation', 'sorts', 'appearance', 'presents', 'hardly', 'point', 'interaction', 'townsfolk', 'polarize', 'latent', 'resentments', 'surface', 'feel', 'need', 'unite', 'cause', 'leader', 'movie', 'unhinged', 'bible-basher', 'somewhat', 'top', 'not', 'downright', 'offensive', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'great', 'cast', 'acting', 'hearts', 'even', 'remarkably', 'good', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'controversial', 'ending', 'think', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'theme', 'exploring', 'what', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'film', 'mere', 'creature', 'feature', 'straight', 'DVD', 'King', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'piece', 'work', 'will', 'spark', 'thoughts', 'conversation', 'long', 'movie', 'over.All', 'thumbs', 'up', 'one', 'gore', 'places', 'moderate', 'air', 'tension', 'stirred', 'great', 'effect', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'human', 'nature']",N/A

But it seems that over time, the horror movie genre has either gotten more stale by the second, or I've just seen so many that I'm jaded as hell.The Mist REALLY lived up to my expectations of good horror. The first thing that made me like it was there was NO SEX ANYWHERE in this movie! Hollywood has gotten it in it's head that sex sells a movie, but everytime I've ever watched a movie with copius amounts of grunge in it (take the newer dawn of the dead movie, for example) with friends, we all just cringe. This movie had NONE of that. It also spared us the obligatory big boobed blonde chick running up a set of stairs or hiding in the closet. That was my first yay.After that, it only continued to get better. The entire movie enthralls you as you watch the disintegrating social structure when so many people ar eput together. I felt this was highly true to human nature. The monsters were the glam of the movie, sure, but the real horror was in watching the people. With the zealot going off, and what happened to several of the characters ( namely the soldier later on) was absolutely terrifying for me to watch. I haven't been this enthralled with a movie since I was young. I didn't want to get up to pee it was that good. The whole movie, the mist, coupled with Dead Can Dance's song "" Host of Serephim"" just made for a haunting, frightening world in which these characters had to live through.The ending goes without saying. I prayed for "" not another it's a dream"" ending, and this movie delivered. My husband and I were SO HORRIFIED by the ending we could hardly beleive they allowed it to be produced-but the ending was the biggest horror of all, and threw me for such a loop there was no way I could call it conventional, or even expected. I was blindsided by this leap from normal Hollywood endings, and that thrilled me.Five stars.

The situation goes from inconvenient to horrific when they discover there are monsters in the mist; but mistrust and paranoia lead quickly to a situation inside that is more unsettling than the unknown horrors around them.I just saw this for a second time, and was once again impressed by how effective it was in its dark simplicity and how much it resembled the old school 50's and 60's horror thrillers likeThe Thing from Another WorldandNight of the Living Dead.  It puts the focus on the human drama, and the way that fear and mistrust can make human beings worse than any monster.  Marcia Gay Harden's apocalyptic power grab was truly frightening, and it's rare that commercial Hollywood filmmakers have the guts to deliver on a premise as scary as this one, and carry it through to the finish.  Compare the ending of this film, which is smaller scale but to my mind more effective and in its own way sublime, to the ending of Steven Spielberg'sWar of the Worlds, or to the ending of any other conventional Hollywood horror film and it will be clear how unique Darabont's approach was here, that managed to ramp up even on the darkness of Stephen King's original vision.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 6]","Frank Darabont, the man who brought The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile to the big screen, adapts Stephen King once again with The Mist; which ranks as one of the very best adaptations of the horror author's works.  Thomas Jane (The Punisher, Deep Blue Sea) stars as David Drayton, a movie poster artist living in Maine who, along with his young son (Nathan Gamble) is trapped with other survivors in a supermarket when a mysterious, deadly mist rolls into town; with something even deadlier lurking inside the fog.  Making matters even worse are the biblical ramblings of Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), who believes this is a sign from God, and soon demands that sacrifices be made.  Combining old school horror, social commentary, monster-flavored shocks, and more commentary elements of religious fanatiscism; Frank Darabont has managed to craft a modern day horror classic that does not disappoint.  Jane gives one of the best performances of his career, and though Marcia Gay Harden's character doesn't get much sympathy, she is very effective in her role regardless.  With wonderful CGI creature, monster, and makeup effects from the good folks at KNB, a great cast that also includes Silent Hill's Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, Andre Braugher, William Sadler, Alexa Davalos, and Jeffrey DeMunn, and one of the most unforgettable and unsettling endings in a mainstream movie in recent memory; The Mist isn't only one of the best King adaptations ever filmed, but one of the best horror movies released in quite some time.

Theatrical releases such as Christine and Dreamcatcher were utterly horrible, while the made-for-TV horror movies such as The Tommyknockers and the Langoliers were also bad.  On the other hand, the non-horror ones were excellent.  These included Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Green Mile, and Misery.  Then came The Mist, released in 2007.  This adaptation of a short story is probably the best horror movie released this decade that was not based of a Japanese story.  Though based on a short story, the movie clocks in at over two hours; long for a horror movie.  The plot is very believable, and the casting is excellent.  No big names in this movie, instead the story has a cast of a dozen characters that drive it forward; all of whom play important parts.  The ending is also great.As to the content, there is some gore, but it is not excessive.  There is some violence, but it does not dominate the story, and instead is only an extension of certain subplots.  The scenes requiring special effects are kept to a minimum, but those scenes are extremely well done and all the monsters look quite real.  Most importantly, there are no stupid scenes in the movie.  There is no scene of a guy running from a monster and then tripping.  There is no scene of some lady hiding from a monster, and then giving away her presence by tripping.

The book, by the way, can be purchased as a stand-alone novel (most likely because of the success of this movie).  The movie, specifically, is one of those rare gems where somebody&#8217;s taken a Stephen King story and adapted it perfectly for cinema.  The ending is a little different than the book, but I think it suited the film better.  Most of Stephen King stories are about the meat of the story, and not so much the ending.  So I actually like the film ending better to be honest, which is one of the most memorable aspects of this move.  This is a marvelous look at a small group of people and how they start behaving and changing when confined to a small physical area and the element of fear has been violently injected into the dynamic.I instantly thought I knew exactly how this movie was going to be based upon the fact that it&#8217;s a movie based on a Stephen King book that primarily takes place in a grocery store, and there&#8217;s monsters.

It has everything a monster movie should have such as suspense, panic, terror, madness with some powerful performances to boot. The premise is simple. A mist settles on a town and shoppers find themselves in a supermarket defending themselves from monsters that appear in the mist... and then having to defend themselves from each other. It leaves you asking the question ""are the monsters on the inside or outside?""That dichotomy is what drives the film. It is very much about human behaviour under extreme duress in this survival horror as people doubt there are monsters and go outside, go outside anyway for a cause or to save somebody or a family member, start a cult inside that blames ""unbelievers"" or form separatist movements to plan an action of escape from the mystery mist that brings with it a wrath of monstrous proportions.The ending grabs you by the scruff of your neck and rattles you emotionally. It is the sort of ending you thought Hollywood never had the brass pair to make and yet when it comes you wish it hadn't. Not that the twist isn't good, it delivers a punch, but rips your heart out with it. Never has a film explored such dark realms as this has.

1126879,ANZUZTIBMGK4S,B0010X73ZG,"Poe the Ghost ""George""","[30, 52]","The mist, is without a doubt Stephen King's worst punishment to his fans since Rose Red.Now, I know that the people in horror movies are supposed to be on the stupid side or otherwise no one would die and it wouldn't be much of a horror movie. But this, my friends... Is ridiculous! I don't know if breathing in the mist somehow effects your brain, if so, they certainly didn't mention it in the movie, but you'll watch the character's in this movie continuously make the dumbest mistakes possible! So dumb in fact, that it ruins the entire movie!The ridiculousness starts at the beginning of the movie, after a tree crashes through the main character's window during a storm, he starts to drive to the store with his son and next door neighbor. As he's driving down the road, he sees several trucks full of soldiers headed in the direction of his house, but rather than thinking this odd and turning back, he just keeps right on going.Fast forward to when he's already inside the store after everyone sees just how dangerous the mist is and how after anyone goes into it, you hear lots of screaming and ripping noises, and the person who went in doesn't seem to come back. Hmmmm... Could this suggest that there's something bad in the the mist and that the reason why there's so much screaming when somebody goes in and doesn't come back is because whatever was inside killed them??? Aparently not, because when the generator that powers the store stops working and the main character tells them not to go outside to try and fix it because a moment ago he saw something banging on the garage door, they all accuse him of imagining it. Then one of the teenage workers offers to go outside and fix it, and guess what? He gets killed by some sort of huge tentacled monster just seconds after opening the door. *GASPS* Didn't see that one coming...Fast forward again to later in the movie, it's night now and after what happened to the teenage boy everyone has piled bags of dog food, charcole, fertilizer, etc against all the doors and windows. (Yeah, that oughta keep 'em out...) They've also come up with the grand idea of soaking the heads of mops in buckets of kerosene to use as torches! (Bravo!) As well as rigging up an emergency lighting system of heat lamps powered by batteries.Now here's where the main character becomes just as dumb as everyone else and stops being the voice of reason in the film... One of the characters is sitting by a window with a lanturn, and suddenly a large insect-like monster with a huge stinger lands on the window. More people show up with there lanturns to investigate, and more bugs fly onto the window. Anyone else here know what attracts insects? Well, after standing there for what might as well have been an hour, our sharp-as-a-tack hero realizes that the bugs are being attracted by the light. (Once again, if I realized the minute that the first bug flew onto the window that the lanturn attracted it, then how dumb are the people in this town that it took them that long to figure it out?!) By the time our brilliant hero has uncovered the mystery of what has attracted the bugs, the guys in the back of the store figured it was the best idea to turn on the emergency lights and point them at the front window! A big gargoyle-like thing crashes through the window, the idiots light their torches and one of them procedes to trip over the buckets of kerosene that they left lying in the middle of the floor for easy access, thus burning himself alive & catching the store afire!Now, I should've stopped watching here, but I drove on...Later that night, they put out the fire, and saved the guy who lit himself and the store on fire. A woman who can no longer take the fear, commits suicide that night by swollowing a handful of pills, and the idiots carry her body to the window. (I was surprised at that point to see that they didnt break open the window, put her body on a grill as some form of funerary pyre, and have a fan blow her roasting fumes out the open window.)After that, the idiots decide to go next door to the pharmacy to treat the guy who cooked himself. More people die and the dumb guy is dead by the time they make it back.Next, the crazy overly-Christian lady starts a cult inside the store and pretty much everyone joins, then they sacrafice a young army cadet for the sins that brought this horror upon them.Our hero, his son, the babysitter, the lovable old lady, and the nice old man escape, get into a car and attempt to drive beyond the reach of the mist.After awhile, the car runs out of gas and they decide to commit suicide by shooting themselfs with their gun. (Now, with all the wrecked cars lying around them, you'd figure that they would just siphon some gas, but aparently killing themselves was a better idea...) 4 bullets, 5 people... Our hero shoots his son, the babysitter, and the 2 old people. He then gets out of the car and screams his head off at the horror of what he has just done.Seconds later, a tank and soldiers show up with several trucks filled with survivors, and the soldiers procede to use flame throwers to burn down these large cacoons that were hanging from the trees. After the cacoons are all burned, the mist dissipates... Then, the movie ends...And to think, if the main character had've gotten out of the car to siphon gas, one of the other survivors could've covered him with the hand gun, then they could've gotten back into the car, and before they could even turn the key they would've seen the army.So, in the end, it was a dumb movie, with dumb characters, that had a dumb ending because they were dumb...Now normally, I would've thought that our beloved scare master Stephen King had purposely made everyone so dumb as some kind of moral to the story, but alas... It wasn't presented in that way. It was meant to appear as a tragically ironic, ""Oh, if they only had've waited another second..."" ending.Also, as a Stephen King fan, I wasn't fond of the teaser within the movie...At the begining, the main character is drawing a painting of Roland from Stephen King's ""The Dark Tower"" series with a rose at his side and the fabled tower in the background. Then later, you find out that the main character draws movie posters... Now, if that was only a fan teaser and Stephen King never makes The Dark Tower into a movie, then that's just cruel... We've all been begging him to make a Gunslinger movie for years!",1,Why are the characters in this movie so dumb?!? *SPOILERS*,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,6426,"['mist', 'doubt', 'Stephen', 'King',

Fortunately, The Mist makes an attempt, albeit not the best, in trying to examine fear and how it affects people in an enclosed setting. Needless to say it results in the inevitable mob mentality as witnessed in numerous tales (Lord of the Flies, J.J. Abram's ""Lost"", etc.) but in this case the antagonists are not from our world. This is a nice touch in that in no way can the audience relate to the creatures in any way. They show no emotion nor any motivation in their killing almost as if they were going about their business as usual. There is a similarity to ""The Old Ones"" of H.P. Lovecraft's ""Cthulhu"" where he describes their indifference to life around them and even note the monster at the end of the film with tentacles as if a nod to Lovecraft. That being said we are left to focus  not on the creatures but on the struggle inside the supermarket between a growing religious fanaticism amongst the many against the few who hold onto using logic. This alone is enough to garner ten stars from me as this is the stuff that makes classics but unfortunately the third act falls apart rather quickly.I won't give it away here but when you do see it I wonder if the general public will agree with me in wanting to know why everything had to lead up to this. Why does our lead protagonist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) deserve this? The problem isn't the down ending, which I typically enjoy in films, the problem is simply what does it all mean? What are we left with when the lights go up? That religion was the way to go? Or just wait a little longer and everything will resolve itself so don't fight it? I can't help but think that the ending's sole purpose was shocking for the sake of shock value and nothing else. Which leads to my next question: What is the deal with Stephen King endings anyway? I've read his books and somehow they end just right at least on paper but on the big screen they seem to fall apart (check out IT or The Stand as examples). There's something about the relationship between the reader (their imagination) and the written word and how it can dupe you into buying any convoluted plot. However, on the big screen, the filmmaker has to make his interpretation of said ending work for everyone. He can't force us to accept whether it's right or wrong, it just has to work that one time and that's it. The majority of this film is entertaining, great atmosphere, good character actors and although this film's third act can be chalked up with all the other unsuccessful Stephen King endings the first two acts do make up for it.",3,One of the Better Stephen King Horror Adaptations,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,2747,"['are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'horror', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'utilize', 'character', 'development', 'part', 'narrative', 'least', 'try', 'say', 'something', 'society', 'individual', 'Fortunately', 'Mist', 'attempt', 'not', 'best', 'trying', 'examine', 'fear', 'how', 'people', 'enclosed', 'setting', 'Needless', 'say', 'results', 'inevitable', 'mob', 'mentality', 'witnessed', 'numerous', 'tales', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'J.J.', 'Abram', 'Lost', 'etc', 'case', 'antagonists', 'are', 'not', 'world', 'nice', 'touch', 'way', 'can', 'audience', 'relate', 'creatures', 'way', 'show', 'emotion', 'motivation', 'killing', 'almost', 'were', 'going', 'business', 'usual', 'similarity', 'Old', 'Ones', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'Cthulhu', 'where', 'indifference', 'life', 'even', 'note', 'monster', 'end', 'film', 'tentacles', 'nod', 'Lovecraft', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'left', 'focus', 'not', 'creatures', 'struggle', 'supermarket', 'growing', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'amongst', 'many', 'few', 'who', 'hold', 'using', 'logic', 'alone', 'enough', 'garner', 'ten', 'stars', 'stuff', 'classics', 'unfortunately', 'third', 'act', 'apart', 'rather', 'quickly.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here', 'when', 'do', 'see', 'wonder', 'general', 'public', 'will', 'agree', 'wanting', 'know', 'why', 'everything', 'had', 'lead', 'up', 'Why', 'lead', 'protagonist', 'David', 'Drayton', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'deserve', 'problem', ""n't"", 'down', 'ending', 'typically', 'enjoy', 'films', 'problem', 'simply', 'what', 'mean', 'What', 'are', 'left', 'when', 'lights', 'go', 'up', 'religion', 'was', 'way', 'go', 'just', 'wait', 'little', 'longer', 'everything', 'will', 'resolve', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'fight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'ending', 'sole', 'purpose', 'was', 'shocking', 'sake', 'shock', 'value', 'nothing', 'else', 'Which', 'next', 'question', 'What', 'deal', 'Stephen', 'King', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'somehow', 'end', 'just', 'right', 'least', 'paper', 'big', 'screen', 'seem', 'fall', 'apart', 'check', 'IT', 'Stand', 'examples', 'something', 'relationship', 'reader', 'imagination', 'written', 'word', 'how', 'can', 'dupe', 'buying', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'However', 'big', 'screen', 'filmmaker', 'make', 'interpretation', 'said', 'ending', 'work', 'everyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'force', 'accept', 'right', 'wrong', 'just', 'work', 'one', 'time', 'majority', 'film', 'entertaining', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'good', 'character', 'actors', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'can', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'other', 'unsuccessful', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'do', 'make', 'up']",N/A

Adding to those seems ridiculous, when the product at hand is a different thing altogether.A tip for my fellow DVD reviewers: People come here wanting to know about the DVD's quality, the extra features, the additional footage, and the alternate version on the disc. They don't come here wanting to know what all you mini-Eberts thought of the movie. Please, for the love of all things decent, review the DVD on the page, NOT the movie you saw in the theater!That being said, this is a nice DVD set and it offers quite a few reasons why you want to go with the 2-disc set over getting the cheaper 1-disc version. The primary bonus is getting the film that Frank Darabont wanted to release in the first place: A black-and-white version of the movie. This isn't just a ""turned off the color"" version, either, but a well-made, contrast-balanced, tweaked and specially designed for black-and-white version of the film. The effect this has on the movie is astounding. The monsters are more frightening- Probably because you really can't tell they're CGI when they're not in color. Something about computer color makes CGI look ""more fake"" than it is, and this version of the movie makes a strong argument for releasing more CGI effects-heavy movies in black-and-white. Perhaps if ""I Am Legend"" had been designed for black-and-white, it wouldn't have ended up with such cheesy-looking monsters.The quality of the DVD is excellent. Both versions of the film look great when upscaled for HDTVs, and they hold up well in the absence of a Blu-Ray or other HD version. The special features are pretty standard fare, but they're done well if you're into that sort of thing. The ""controversial"" ending (which I loved) remains intact, and I applaud them for not wimping out. Not all movies need to be happy-happy at the end.All in all, if you liked it in the theater, then this is the (current) definitive version to own on DVD. If you haven't seen it yet, and you're not one of those losers who ""won't watch black-and-white movies"", then I recommend watching the black-and-white version of this FIRST. It's what the director wanted in the first place, and the studio talked him out of it, but it really does make the movie all the more frightening and effective.",5,"I'll rate the DVD, not the movie--",1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,2979,"['get', 'really', 'sick', 'reviews', 'DVDs', 'Amazon', 'see', 'are', 'lot', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'posting', 'opinion', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'theaters', 'Sometimes', 'people', 'are', 'dropping', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'vain', 'hope', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'editor-in-chief', 'search', 'newest', 'film', 'critic', 'will', 'browse', 'Amazon', 'say', 'Gosh', 'Look', 'great', 'review', 'right', 'want', 'person', 'staff', 'pronto', 'digress', 'point', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'have', 'taken', 'life', 'actually', 'reviewing', 'product', 'being', 'offered', 'movie', 'DVD', 'lot', 'saw', 'Mist', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'were', 'scads', 'reviews', 'offered', 'time', 'Adding', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'product', 'hand', 'different', 'thing', 'altogether.A', 'tip', 'fellow', 'DVD', 'reviewers', 'People', 'come', 'here', 'wanting', 'know', 'DVD', 'quality', 'extra', 'features', 'additional', 'footage', 'alternate', 'version', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'here', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'mini-Eberts', 'thought', 'movie', 'Please', 'love', 'things', 'decent', 'review', 'DVD', 'page', 'NOT', 'movie', 'saw', 'theater', 'being', 'said', 'nice', 'DVD', 'set', 'quite', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'want', 'go', '2-disc', 'set', 'getting', 'cheaper', '1-disc', 'version', 'primary', 'bonus', 'getting', 'film', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'wanted', 'release', 'first', 'place', 'black-and-white', 'version', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'turned', 'off', 'color', 'version', 'either', 'well-made', 'contrast-balanced', 'tweaked', 'specially', 'designed', 'black-and-white', 'version', 'film', 'effect', 'movie', 'astounding', 'monsters', 'are', 'more', 'frightening-', 'Probably', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'CGI', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'color', 'Something', 'computer', 'color', 'CGI', 'look', 'more', 'fake', 'version', 'movie', 'strong', 'argument', 'releasing', 'more', 'CGI', 'effects-heavy', 'movies', 'black-and-white', 'Perhaps', 'Am', 'Legend', 'had', 'been', 'designed', 'black-and-white', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'such', 'cheesy-looking', 'monsters.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'versions', 'film', 'look', 'great', 'when', 'upscaled', 'HDTVs', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'absence', 'Blu-Ray', 'other', 'HD', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'standard', 'fare', ""'re"", 'done', 'well', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', 'controversial', 'ending', 'loved', 'intact', 'applaud', 'not', 'wimping', 'out', 'Not', 'movies', 'need', 'be', 'happy-happy', 'end.All', 'liked', 'theater', 'then', 'current', 'definitive', 'version', 'own', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', ""'re"", 'not', 'one', 'losers', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'black-and-white', 'movies', 'then', 'recommend', 'watching', 'black-and-white', 'version', 'FIRST', 'what', 'director', 'wanted', 'first', 'place', 'studio', 'talked', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'frightening', 'effective']",N/A

But now, having seen it, I can report that ""The Mist"" is - in places, at least, pleasantly surprising, and overall, isn't half as bad as you might think.The plot isn't anything out of the ordinary, and you could be forgiven for assuming that Steven King and screenplay writer Frank Darabont copied and pasted scenes from ""The Fog"" and ""The Birds"" to come up with this : Freak storm gives birth to a thick mist blanketing the town, and spews out numerous beasties that corral a group of people in a local supermarket - including David Drayton (Jane) and his son Billy (Gamble), their neighbour Brent Norton (Braugher) and local religious zealot Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). Escape seems hopeless and the locals become more and more restless as their numbers slowly decline. Et cetera et cetera. But ""The Mist"" wisely goes more for a Hitchcock-style suspense feel than a Carpenter all-out-horror motif, and this, frankly, saves the movie from itself.The acting's pretty average, with some good performances (Thomas Jane, Frances Sternhagen and Andre Braugher), some great performances (Marcia Gay Harden, Nathan Gamble) and - of course - some truly lousy performances by histrionic extras (""There's something in the mist!"", ""It's in the mist!"", ""No wire hangers ever!"", and so forth. Well, maybe not that last one, but you get the picture....). The screenplay (by Frank Darabont) is competent and nicely paced - within fifteen minutes we're in the thick of the action (although this does cause somewhat of a drag around the midway point, but hey, by then you've been watching for an hour, and another hour won't kill you...) - and, histrionic extras' dialogue notwithstanding, the script provides a functional, utilitarian dialogue that forwards a well-made, suspenseful movie. The ending is unexpected and very, very unsettling - and definitely contributes a great deal to my three-star rating.Direction is very good, there's one supermarket-in-chaos sequence just before the movie's mid-point that is very nicely done, and the special effects, surprisingly, are absolutely fantastic. CGI is well-animated and unpretentiously showcased, and while there are one or two points where the beasties look fake, the mist itself is convincing, and the creatures, for the most part, look plausible.The biggest problem with ""The Mist"" is that it's not very original. I haven't read the story that spawned it, but this movie version doesn't really do anything new. It retreads some very familiar waters with competent polish, though, and if you're in the mood for an undemanding suspense/horror movie with plenty of decent elements to it, this might be just what you're looking for.Recommended for rental - unless you're a huge King fan, in which case this two-disc version is your best bet.",3,"Solid suspense, lacks originality.",1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,2890,"['trailers', 'Mist', 'made', 'shudder', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'thought', 'here', 'Just', 'Horror', 'now', 'having', 'seen', 'can', 'report', 'Mist', 'places', 'least', 'pleasantly', 'surprising', 'overall', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'might', 'think.The', 'plot', ""n't"", 'anything', 'ordinary', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'assuming', 'Steven', 'King', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'copied', 'pasted', 'scenes', 'Fog', 'Birds', 'come', 'up', 'Freak', 'storm', 'birth', 'thick', 'mist', 'blanketing', 'town', 'out', 'numerous', 'beasties', 'corral', 'group', 'people', 'local', 'supermarket', 'including', 'David', 'Drayton', 'Jane', 'son', 'Billy', 'Gamble', 'neighbour', 'Brent', 'Norton', 'Braugher', 'local', 'religious', 'zealot', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Escape', 'hopeless', 'locals', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'restless', 'numbers', 'slowly', 'decline', 'Et', 'cetera', 'et', 'cetera', 'Mist', 'wisely', 'more', 'Hitchcock-style', 'suspense', 'feel', 'Carpenter', 'all-out-horror', 'motif', 'frankly', 'movie', 'itself.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'average', 'good', 'performances', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'great', 'performances', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'course', 'truly', 'lousy', 'performances', 'histrionic', 'extras', 'something', 'mist', 'mist', 'No', 'wire', 'hangers', 'ever', 'so', 'forth', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'last', 'one', 'get', 'picture', 'screenplay', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'competent', 'nicely', 'paced', 'fifteen', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'thick', 'action', 'cause', 'somewhat', 'drag', 'midway', 'point', 'hey', 'then', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'hour', 'hour', 'wo', ""n't"", 'kill', 'histrionic', 'extras', 'dialogue', 'notwithstanding', 'script', 'functional', 'utilitarian', 'dialogue', 'well-made', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'ending', 'unexpected', 'very', 'very', 'unsettling', 'definitely', 'great', 'deal', 'three-star', 'rating.Direction', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'supermarket-in-chaos', 'sequence', 'just', 'movie', 'mid-point', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'surprisingly', 'are', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'CGI', 'well-animated', 'unpretentiously', 'showcased', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'points', 'where', 'beasties', 'look', 'fake', 'mist', 'convincing', 'creatures', 'most', 'part', 'look', 'plausible.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Mist', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'story', 'spawned', 'movie', 'version', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'very', 'familiar', 'waters', 'competent', 'polish', 'though', ""'re"", 'mood', 'undemanding', 'suspense/horror', 'movie', 'plenty', 'decent', 'elements', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'for.Recommended', 'rental', ""'re"", 'huge', 'King', 'fan', 'case', 'two-disc', 'version', 'best', 'bet']",N/A

There have been some films that were extraordinarily bad, some that we extraordinarily good, and some that were just so-so.""The Mist"", however, is one of the films that holds up well when compared to the original story, except for the ending. The book ends with a slight hope for the future, whereas the film had a ""Twilight Zone-ish"" ending. Why Frank Darabont (who did amazing work with ""The Green Mile"") chose to make such a change is beyond me, but I guess in the long run, it did have more of an emotional impact.I was able to identify with the characters and their initial plight (surviving Hurricane Katrina was similar to what the townspeople went through during the aftermath of the storm, though on a MUCH smaller scale)and I truly cared about what happened to them.A simple trip to the supermarket quickly turns into a nightmare and the pace and suspense of the film never lets up until the very end. The special effects are quite convincing and the performances by the actors are very well done.Overall, ""The Mist"" is a very good horror/suspense film that should keep you quite entertained for the two-hour running time.

1126897,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0010X73ZG,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","Writer / Director Frank Darabont's adaptations of THE GREEN MILE and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION are clearly (along with Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME) the best filmed adaptations of Stephen King's work.  He gets, unlike someone like Stanley Kubrick  DIDN'T get with THE SHINING, that King is just as interested in the human interactions and reactions to the supernatural as he is in the supernatural itself.  His best stories don't just trot out horrific events, they trot out an assortment of flawed but interesting people to deal with those events.  Darabont's THE MIST doesn't quite reach the same lofty heights as his previous adaptations...but there is still much to admire.THE MIST is a fairly straightforward Stephen King novella.  A mysterious and very thick mist rolls in over a small town in Maine, and as the inhabitants quickly discover, there are amazingly vicious and awful creatures populating this mist.  So a group of townspeople hole up inside a grocery store, and immediately the bickering begins.  Some want simply to leave...others want to sit and wait.  After awhile, those left waiting begin to splinter into those who wish to take some action and those who are happy to cower.  And then there are those that believe that God has brought his wrath to bear on the town and only turning to him will save them.While the creatures outside are indeed horrific (in fact, they are among King's most basic, terrible creations.  They are creatures that seem to exist purely to tear people into little pieces and consume them), the events that unfold inside are really what build the tension to the breaking point.Darabont CLEARLY understands that is the true heart of this simple story, and he focuses much of his attention on the interactions of the unusual grouping of survivors.  (This is probably a good thing, because when the creatures ARE seen, the CGI effects that render them are not the greatest.  The monsters are still quite gruesome looking, but they aren't really convincing.  Again, it's the reactions of the people to those monsters that convinces us to be horrified.)The cast is very good.  No huge names, but all are well cast.  Thomas Jane is the ""hero"" of the tale, an illustrator who has come to town with his little boy, leaving his wife behind at home.  He is a sturdy, competent presence...able to be scared, but able to be brave as well.  He keeps his head, and others see this and turn to him as a leader.  Andre Braugher appears as a haughty attorney, and he is, as always, a charismatic presence.  The always wonderful Frances Sternhagen (Cliff's mother on CHEERS) steals her few scenes as a feisty old lady.  And I'd like to commend Laurie Holden, who very convincingly plays the young school teacher who brings some heart and sympathy to the scene.  She is not a well-known actress (she played Anna Kovarubias on THE X-FILES) but I think she could be quite good.  I also liked Toby Jones as the seemingly-meek store manager, and William Sadler as a dangerously simple-minded blue-collar type.  But it could be argued that the show is stolen by Marcia Gay Harden's nearly over-the-top but just in-control role as the hell-and-brimstone spouting religious zealot who leads her growing group of followers to commit acts that are nearly as horrific as those happening on the outside.At no moment is this a ""believable"" film...it is a horror movie...nothing more.  Yet it takes the clich&eacute;s of the genre (the group of people trapped in a building) and elevates them a little.  Darabont has kept the best parts of King's story...the elements that brought humanity to this story.The movie is not perfect.  I mentioned the effects already.  And I must touch on the ending.  If you remember King's story, the ending was VERY open-ended.  It was frustrating, but it was creepy too.  Darabont has recognized that it's less fair for a movie-goer to simply leave `em hanging.  So he has concocted an ending.  Some people may like the ending...but without spoiling anything, I'm going to say that I did not like it.  I can't discuss specifics...but to me, it shifted the tone of the film from a horror film to something even more horrifying...uncomfortably so.  This is a genre film after all...to have it take on an almost philosophical level of squirminess is not fair to the spirit of the 110 minutes that have come before the final 10 minutes.Nonetheless, I can recommend the film.  It is rated ""R"" for pretty strong language, and the violence...but it also isn't for youngsters because its presentation of humanity is a little harsh too.  If you're a fan of King or of horror films, check it out.  If you're looking merely to be lightly entertained...stay away.",4,"Solid, scary adaptation of a great King novella!",1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,4691,"['Writer', '/', 'Director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'adaptations', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'MILE', 'SHAWSHANK', 'REDEMPTION', 'are', 'clearly', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'STAND', 'BY', 'ME', 'best', 'filmed', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'work', 'someone', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'get', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'King', 'just', 'as', 'interested', 'human', 'interactions', 'reactions', 'supernatural', 'supernatural', 'best', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'trot', 'out', 'horrific', 'events', 'trot', 'out', 'assortment', 'flawed', 'interesting', 'people', 'deal', 'events', 'Darabont', 'THE', 'MIST', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'same', 'lofty', 'heights', 'previous', 'adaptations', 'still', 'much', 'admire.THE', 'MIST', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'mysterious', 'very', 'thick', 'mist', 'rolls', 'small', 'town', 'Maine', 'inhabitants', 'quickly', 'discover', 'are', 'amazingly', 'vicious', 'awful', 'creatures', 'populating', 'mist', 'group', 'townspeople', 'hole', 'up', 'grocery', 'store', 'immediately', 'bickering', 'want', 'simply', 'leave', 'others', 'want', 'sit', 'wait', 'awhile', 'left', 'waiting', 'begin', 'splinter', 'who', 'wish', 'take', 'action', 'who', 'are', 'happy', 'cower', 'then', 'are', 'believe', 'God', 'brought', 'wrath', 'bear', 'town', 'only', 'turning', 'will', 'save', 'creatures', 'are', 'indeed', 'horrific', 'fact', 'are', 'King', 'most', 'basic', 'terrible', 'creations', 'are', 'creatures', 'seem', 'exist', 'purely', 'tear', 'people', 'little', 'pieces', 'consume', 'events', 'unfold', 'inside', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'build', 'tension', 'breaking', 'point.Darabont', 'CLEARLY', 'true', 'heart', 'simple', 'story', 'much', 'attention', 'interactions', 'unusual', 'grouping', 'survivors', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'creatures', 'ARE', 'seen', 'CGI', 'effects', 'render', 'are', 'not', 'greatest', 'monsters', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'gruesome', 'looking', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'convincing', 'Again', 'reactions', 'people', 'monsters', 'be', 'horrified', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'huge', 'names', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'hero', 'tale', 'illustrator', 'who', 'come', 'town', 'little', 'boy', 'leaving', 'wife', 'home', 'sturdy', 'competent', 'presence', 'able', 'be', 'scared', 'able', 'be', 'brave', 'as', 'well', 'head', 'others', 'see', 'turn', 'leader', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'haughty', 'attorney', 'always', 'charismatic', 'presence', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'Cliff', 'mother', 'CHEERS', 'few', 'scenes', 'feisty', 'old', 'lady', ""'d"", 'like', 'commend', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'who', 'very', 'convincingly', 'young', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'heart', 'sympathy', 'scene', 'not', 'well-known', 'actress', 'played', 'Anna', 'Kovarubias', 'THE', 'X-FILES', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'also', 'liked', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'seemingly-meek', 'store', 'manager', 'William', 'Sadler', 'dangerously', 'simple-minded', 'blue-collar', 'type', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'show', 'stolen', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'nearly', 'over-the-top', 'just', 'in-control', 'role', 'hell-and-brimstone', 'spouting', 'religious', 'zealot', 'who', 'growing', 'group', 'followers', 'commit', 'acts', 'are', 'nearly', 'as', 'horrific', 'happening', 'outside.At', 'moment', 'believable', 'film', 'horror', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'genre', 'group', 'people', 'trapped', 'building', 'little', 'Darabont', 'kept', 'best', 'parts', 'King', 'story', 'elements', 'brought', 'humanity', 'story.The', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'mentioned', 'effects', 'already', 'must', 'touch', 'ending', 'remember', 'King', 'story', 'ending', 'was', 'VERY', 'open-ended', 'was', 'frustrating', 'was', 'creepy', 'too', 'Darabont', 'recognized', 'less', 'fair', 'movie-goer', 'simply', 'leave', 'em', 'hanging', 'So', 'concocted', 'ending', 'people', 'may', 'like', 'ending', 'spoiling', 'anything', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'specifics', 'shifted', 'tone', 'film', 'horror', 'film', 'something', 'even', 'more', 'horrifying', 'uncomfortably', 'so', 'genre', 'film', 'have', 'take', 'almost', 'philosophical', 'level', 'squirminess', 'not', 'fair', 'spirit', '110', 'minutes', 'have', 'come', 'final', '10', 'minutes.Nonetheless', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'pretty', 'strong', 'language', 'violence', 'also', ""n't"", 'youngsters', 'presentation', 'humanity', 'little', 'harsh', 'too', ""'re"", 'fan', 'King', 'horror', 'films', 'check', 'out', ""'re"", 'looking', 'merely', 'be', 'lightly', 'entertained', 'stay', 'away']",N/A

The guy who actually managed to make two of the four half-decent feature-length Stephen King film adaptations in existence (Misery and 'Salem's Lot are the others-- don't you dare bring up The Shining) made... this? To be fair, though, the first hour and change is pretty good. But man, I can't remember the last time a Stephen King adaptation blew the ending so badly. I probably should have known what I was getting into when I saw the cast was led by Thomas Jane, who has a string of awful movies behind this one (including the should-have-been-stillborn King adaptation Dreamcatcher), but I still held out hope. How terribly wrong I was.Jane plays David Drayton, the successful artist who, the morning after a big storm, goes into town with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) to get some food and supplies to fix the picture window, through which a tree crashed. While they're in the store, a thick mist rolls into town, and brings nasties with it. Drayton and his neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), who aren't entirely fond of each other, are trapped in the store with a number of other refugees, including the demented Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a religious nut who slowly begins to convince the people that the mist is a plague from God, and requires human sacrifice. Some army folks from the top-secret base up the hill, however, might have a different explanation-- if anyone can get them to talk.Like I said, the first hour isn't bad, even if Darabont does break one of the cardinal rules of a good monster movie (don't show the bad guy too much). After that, it goes way, way downhill, turning first into a mindless action movie and then into... I'm not sure I have the words to describe what it becomes next. Imagine the cheapest, most suck-out ending you can think of, and then multiply it by three. I mean, it doesn't even work within the context of the scene that came just before it, for heaven's sake.

1126899,A2NSEHGMUSE2U2,B0010X73ZG,Robert E. Rodden II,"[13, 18]","Stephen King's The Mist was probably the most requested story-to-film project of all of King's books and stories, so says his publicist.  No one could've been more excited about this picture finally being made than I, an avid fan of King's novels and short stories since his beginning.  I believe that a lot of fans breathed a sigh of ""finally"" when they heard the project was under way.  And Frank Darabont has had a decent track record with King movies, if a short track for sure.  Still, they had a great ensemble cast, lead by Thomas Jane, and with cgi in full swing these days, this film had the potential of becoming a modern day science-fiction classic, in the same way that B-films like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and ""The Quatermass X-periment"" have become undeniable classics over the years.I asked my teenage daughter to go with me, for she too is a Stephen King fan, and I knew we were going to see something special.  About halfway through the film, I was marveling at how Darabont had gotten it down right, how good it felt, dark and frightening, otherwordly and atmospheric.  I knew the story, I'd read it so many times, because I frankly love this sci-fi/horror adventure, like I love Bradbury's Fahrenheit-451, or John Cambell's ""Who Goes There"", so I knew there were no surprises that a fifteen year old shouldn't see.  I was enjoying myself so much, that I was already planning to ask other people to go to it, just so I had an excuse to see it again.  And even acknowledged that I'd be buying this movie on DVD as soon as it was available.And then when it happened in the last seven minutes of the film, when all the preceding story was mocked and destroyed in a kind of low-blow, cosmic joke, in which the main characters all decided to act against character, to step out of the classic story arc, and destroy a wonderfully paced film by turning it into a cynical existencial joke on mankind, I kept thinking, 'No way, they are not going to do this.  They can't.' But they did, and I sat there stunned, muttering, ""I can't believe they did this.  They've ruined it.""  I'd waited all these years, since I first read the novella in 1983, for this film, and they ruined it. My daughter looked at me and said exactly what I was thinking, ""I thought he would wake up and it would be a nightmare, but he didn't"".I won't spoil the ending for you, because it can't be spoiled any more so than watching does on its own.  If you want to know before you go to see the film, it's all over the place now, written in movie reviews and on blogs.I've read many comments from film goers that liked or 'loved' the new twist ending, but my feeling is they never read or appriciated the original story.  There are just as many, and maybe a little bit more, of us who absolutely hated the ending.  And we know it's because that's not how it ended in the novella.  We know that David Drayton's character would not have ended the story that way.  There just is absolutely no indication that he had that character attribute at any time in the preceding story.  Not one hint.  You just don't do that in good story-telling.I read somewhere that Darabont sent that change in the script to Stephen King and he said something like, ""I wish I'd thought of that ending"".  I can tell you that it is my experience that fiction editors do not like dark, cynical endings unless they are hinted at in the preceding story, and if King had written The Mist with the ending that is now in the film version forever, The Mist in novella form would most likely never have seen print.  I kind of wish it hadn't now, then I wouldn't have wanted a film version so badly.  In any case, I went from wanting to see The Mist again and again, and to wanting to buy the DVD, to never wanting to see the movie again.

Powers ""show maniac""","[3, 4]","Sorry for the play on words but i had to get it off my chest, having said that ""The Mist"" has one quality usually missing from most scary movies-it's really scary. Is the story implausable? You betcha-but that's the point of most horror stories-set up a life threatening situation-then scare the bejeezus out of the audience. It has been years since I read the Stephen King novella and I don't remember if the cliche explanation of ""science gone awry"" was responsible for the mist and the creatures lurking inside it but the person revealing what is happening does not meet a pretty end.The movie is extremely gruesome but the most gruesome character is not one of the creatures terrorizing the trapped super-market shoppers but Marcia Gay Hardin as Mrs Carmody the town loony and religious fanatic.  Her continuous rantings about ""the end of days"" and ""Gods vengeance against sinners"" finally convinces most of the terrified shoppers-but to the directors credit, he shows his disdain for Mrs Carmody by having her talk to her Lord and saviour sitting on the john.Much has been said about the ending and I agree-it is awful but if the movie had ended with the last act of Thomas Janes' character it would have been horrifying enough but the movie goes on for a few minutes more and what happens hits you like a punch in the gut.With the exception of the ending the movie is a well made chiller and if you happen to buy the 2 disc set you can also see the movie in black and white.  This gives the movie the feel of a 1950s sci-fi horror flick-but with better special effects and 2008 gore.",5,CHILLING-NOT TO BE MIST,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,1589,"['Sorry', 'play', 'words', 'i', 'had', 'get', 'off', 'chest', 'having', 'said', 'Mist', 'one', 'quality', 'usually', 'missing', 'most', 'scary', 'movies-it', 'really', 'scary', 'story', 'implausable', 'betcha-but', 'point', 'most', 'horror', 'stories-set', 'life', 'threatening', 'situation-then', 'scare', 'bejeezus', 'audience', 'been', 'years', 'read', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'cliche', 'explanation', 'science', 'gone', 'awry', 'was', 'responsible', 'mist', 'creatures', 'lurking', 'person', 'revealing', 'what', 'happening', 'not', 'meet', 'pretty', 'end.The', 'movie', 'extremely', 'gruesome', 'most', 'gruesome', 'character', 'not', 'one', 'creatures', 'terrorizing', 'trapped', 'super-market', 'shoppers', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Hardin', 'Mrs', 'Carmody', 'town', 'loony', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'continuous', 'rantings', 'end', 'days', 'Gods', 'vengeance', 'sinners', 'finally', 'most', 'terrified', 'shoppers-but', 'directors', 'credit', 'disdain', 'Mrs', 'Carmody', 'having', 'talk', 'Lord', 'saviour', 'sitting', 'john.Much', 'been', 'said', 'ending', 'agree-it', 'awful', 'movie', 'had', 'ended', 'last', 'act', 'Thomas', 'Janes', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'horrifying', 'enough', 'movie', 'few', 'minutes', 'more', 'what', 'punch', 'gut.With', 'exception', 'ending', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'chiller', 'happen', 'buy', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'feel', '1950s', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'flick-but', 'better', 'special', 'effects', '2008', 'gore']",N/A

Suffice to say this film works best when it allows itself to be a good old-fashioned monster movie. The mist itself is foreboding, and the tension among the characters palpable as they attempt desperately to determine where it comes from, what it holds, and how to escape. There is plenty of drama within the grocery store where many of the town's residents find themselves trapped, and it is here the movie occasionally bogs down. Like King himself, there is plenty of exposition among the various personalities. Unlike King, however, the payoff for such chatter is sometimes lacking. The general sense of dread from the unknown, being trapped, and the ensuing panic resulting in a mob mentality is best captured through the excellent film work and atmosphere rather than dialogue. And let's not forget the creatures, for there are many of them. Most are genuinely creepy and their appearances are regular, making for a fast-paced, action-oriented flick with plenty of scares to keep you interested. And though I was warned ahead of time about the surprising ending, I was in now way prepared for how it concluded. I'll let you find out, but it did stay with me after the credits rolled.

While Rod Serling is one of my favorite writers, this film's ending did not jibe with what came before it. What was the rush? There were no monsters near by and, had they waited, the soldiers may have appeared and saved them all.

Zwick,"[1, 2]","Essentially an unaccredited remake of John Carpenter's ""The Fog,"" ""The Mist"" is a 50's style B-monster-movie done with 21st Century special effects.  It's the oldie about a group of random strangers trapped in an enclosed space - in this case, a local supermarket - while some unknown threat lurks in the world outside.  But because it's based on a Stephen King novella, it comes with a veneer of deep-think philosophizing to make it seem better than it actually is.It all begins when a strange mist rolls into a small New England town, harboring within it a menace of an indescribable and deadly nature. Local artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the requisite everyman character who becomes the agreed-upon leader who helps the people trapped in the store cope with the crisis.For the most part, this is standard-issue stuff, with each of the stock characters falling into his or her assigned role - be it the soon-to-be-proven-wrong skeptic, the soon-to-be-cut-down-to-size (in some cases, quite literally) big-mouth braggart, and the curled-up-in-a-fetal-position quivering jellyfish, among others.  Heck, there's even an annoying scripture-spouting end-of-days religious fanatic (deliciously played by an over-the-top Marcia Gay Harden) who gets on everyone's last nerve, and who is really just the crazy ornithologist and her drunken detractor from the diner scene in ""The Birds"" rolled into one and then writ large.The first half of the movie is filled with people doing and saying some truly unlikely and stupid things, but the second half has a bit more bite to it as it explores the ways in which desperate people will turn on one another through fear and superstition, and, in so doing, become a greater threat to their own survival and safety than the thing outside.

1126911,AAOF195P95ZVC,B0010X73ZG,Ross E. Nelson,"[1, 2]","This movie could have been a three star production very easily, but is rescued from mediocrity by the intriguing questions it raises.  Apparently a military experiment has gone awry, opening a pathway between dimensions or worlds.  A thick mist spills into the town near the military base, bringing with it monsters that are for the most part not fully revealed, thus heightening the fear for the townspeople and the tension for the audience.The movie gets a little preachy almost immediately, with the first creature attack bringing a forced, almost stilted confrontation between the city slickers and the local rubes.  It's as if the director couldn't let the antagonism gradually build but pushes the characters right into it.  There is of course the kook Christian--an off-the-shelf character for so many Hollywood productions--who somehow convinces most of the people trapped in the grocery store that Judgment Day is at hand and sets up the internal drama of the film.  Most of the townspeople are portrayed as simpletons unable to resist the kook's self-portrayal as mouthpiece for God.The U.S. military clearly had no hand in helping the producers of The Mist, likely because it was shown in so unflattering a light.  Unfortunately that meant a lack of genuine-looking military equipment--do MPs still drive around in Jeeps?  And the tank at the end wasn't an Abrams or look like its predecessor.The level-headed folk have to escape the grocery story because the nutcases now believe that the monsters require human sacrifices (to satisfy God), and because of the fear that eventually the critters will figure out that plate glass windows aren't much of an obstacle to an easy lunch.  Pretty much everything that can go wrong does go wrong, both during the two days in the store and during the good guys' escape.On the other hand the acting was pretty good, especially by Nathan Gamble, the protagonist's little boy.  He plays it perfectly and movingly, as a scared little kid who cries and sucks his thumb.  He can't let go of his father.  How refreshing to see a little kid portrayed as a little kid, not some smart-aleck know-it-all.  The boy lent real emotion and urgency to the situation the town folks found themselves in.The movie also set off a train of thoughts about such a situation.  Except for the bugs, all the monsters appeared to be predators, but for predators to survive there must be prey.  Why didn't huge quantities of prey come through the door too?  You wondered if the monsters could step outside the mist (apparently not) and if not, why not.  And if the mist disappeared, would they too?  Indeed, at the end the mist does start to vanish and so too, it seems, do the monsters.  Putting yourself in the people's places, you might think that the first place you'd go to once out of the store would be to the military base, or the cop station, or any substantial brick or block building.  Instead our good guys drive around until out of gas and take pre-emptive measures to not be the critters' next snack.The ending, as all the reviews note, is a depressing shocker.  I doubt people would so easily give up, but then it's pretty hard to know just how most of us would handle a vicious alien invasion.  Decent special effects, an effective use of tension, and a little philosophizing on man's nature help push this movie over the top into four star territory.",4,"Somebody Close the Door, Please",1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,3390,"['movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'three', 'star', 'production', 'very', 'easily', 'rescued', 'mediocrity', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'Apparently', 'military', 'experiment', 'gone', 'awry', 'opening', 'pathway', 'dimensions', 'worlds', 'thick', 'mist', 'spills', 'town', 'military', 'base', 'bringing', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'fully', 'revealed', 'thus', 'heightening', 'fear', 'townspeople', 'tension', 'audience.The', 'movie', 'little', 'preachy', 'almost', 'immediately', 'first', 'creature', 'attack', 'bringing', 'forced', 'almost', 'stilted', 'confrontation', 'city', 'slickers', 'local', 'rubes', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'let', 'antagonism', 'gradually', 'build', 'characters', 'right', 'course', 'kook', 'Christian', 'off-the-shelf', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'who', 'somehow', 'convinces', 'most', 'people', 'trapped', 'grocery', 'store', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'hand', 'up', 'internal', 'drama', 'film', 'Most', 'townspeople', 'are', 'portrayed', 'simpletons', 'unable', 'resist', 'kook', 'self-portrayal', 'mouthpiece', 'God.The', 'U.S.', 'military', 'clearly', 'had', 'hand', 'helping', 'producers', 'Mist', 'likely', 'was', 'shown', 'so', 'unflattering', 'light', 'Unfortunately', 'meant', 'lack', 'genuine-looking', 'military', 'equipment', 'do', 'MPs', 'still', 'drive', 'around', 'Jeeps', 'tank', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'Abrams', 'look', 'predecessor.The', 'level-headed', 'folk', 'have', 'escape', 'grocery', 'story', 'nutcases', 'now', 'believe', 'monsters', 'require', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'satisfy', 'God', 'fear', 'eventually', 'critters', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'plate', 'glass', 'windows', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'obstacle', 'easy', 'lunch', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'go', 'wrong', 'two', 'days', 'store', 'good', 'guys', 'escape.On', 'other', 'hand', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'protagonist', 'little', 'boy', 'perfectly', 'movingly', 'scared', 'little', 'kid', 'who', 'thumb', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'father', 'How', 'refreshing', 'see', 'little', 'kid', 'portrayed', 'little', 'kid', 'not', 'smart-aleck', 'know-it-all', 'boy', 'lent', 'real', 'emotion', 'urgency', 'situation', 'town', 'folks', 'found', 'in.The', 'movie', 'also', 'set', 'off', 'train', 'thoughts', 'situation', 'bugs', 'monsters', 'appeared', 'be', 'predators', 'predators', 'survive', 'must', 'be', 'prey', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'huge', 'quantities', 'prey', 'come', 'door', 'too', 'wondered', 'monsters', 'could', 'step', 'mist', 'apparently', 'not', 'not', 'why', 'not', 'mist', 'disappeared', 'would', 'too', 'Indeed', 'end', 'mist', 'start', 'vanish', 'so', 'too', 'do', 'monsters', 'Putting', 'people', 'places', 'might', 'think', 'first', 'place', ""'d"", 'go', 'once', 'store', 'would', 'be', 'military', 'base', 'cop', 'station', 'substantial', 'brick', 'block', 'building', 'Instead', 'good', 'guys', 'drive', 'gas', 'take', 'pre-emptive', 'measures', 'not', 'be', 'critters', 'next', 'snack.The', 'ending', 'reviews', 'note', 'depressing', 'shocker', 'doubt', 'people', 'would', 'so', 'easily', 'give', 'up', 'then', 'pretty', 'hard', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'most', 'would', 'handle', 'vicious', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Decent', 'special', 'effects', 'effective', 'use', 'tension', 'little', 'philosophizing', 'man', 'nature', 'help', 'push', 'movie', 'top', 'four', 'star', 'territory']",N/A

Devoted King readers will definetly feel his prescence from almost the first frame of the film, where the movies protagonist/hero, played by Thomas Jane, is painting a canvas depicting King's well-known Dark Towers character, The Gunslinger.I don't want to get into a thorough review of the film since most people know what it's about from the summary. I just want to give my overall opinion on whether or not I liked it. And I did. For the most part.The film is definetly entertaining. Definetly scary. Definetly has some gore-moments. But, surprisingly, the scariest thing about the movie isn't the blood, guts or even the creatures.It's the tension and actions created by the characters themselves that make us cringe.King is a master at exposing human nature for what it really is. He gives viewers a fairly accurate depiction of what people would really do in the most dire of circumstances. And it's NOT pretty. King's main usage of stirring up conflict amongst the characters shines through Marcia Gay-Harden's maniacal Christian Crusader, Mrs. Carmody.Mrs. Carmody is one of modern horror's greatest villians in my opinion. Her acts of proselytizing the desperate survivors is eerily realistic and supremely scary. She was the most frightening part of this film for me.I liked the beginning and middle of this film and loved the underlying messages that King littered throughout it. It's a truly profound horror film in the sense that it actually comes chock-full-of political statements and even religious views, and despite the cheesy CGI graphics, it had a shocking impact on me.It's definetly worth watching. The only thing I can say is that the ending is a huge let down. I literally felt like crying. It was a seriously depressing, downright-somber end to a horror film and it left me shaking my head in shock.Really, truly one of the saddest endings to a horror film (or ANY other film for that matter) that i have ever seen in my life. EVER.That said, The movie was good. It's an emotional thrill ride filled with lots of scares, excellent acting from a fairly famous cast, and a ton of glimpses into the human mind.I wish the ending was different in any way other than the way it was and I would have given it 5 stars. I just don't like when a scary-thriller leaves me teary eyed and depressed.I will most likely be shaking my head in disbelief at this film for a couple of days. Which, is probably a sign that it's a good movie just for the simple fact that it disturbed me.I definetly recommend this film!",3,"Incredibly entertaining film, with a not so stellar ending",1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,2672,"['Stephen', 'King', 'one', 'hit', 'miss', 'authors', 'who', 'managed', 'keep', 'readers', 'viewers', 'entertained', 'imaginings', 'two', 'decades', 'Devoted', 'King', 'readers', 'will', 'definetly', 'feel', 'prescence', 'almost', 'first', 'frame', 'film', 'where', 'movies', 'protagonist/hero', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'painting', 'canvas', 'depicting', 'King', 'well-known', 'Dark', 'Towers', 'character', 'Gunslinger.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'thorough', 'review', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'what', 'summary', 'just', 'want', 'give', 'overall', 'opinion', 'not', 'liked', 'did', 'most', 'part.The', 'film', 'definetly', 'entertaining', 'Definetly', 'scary', 'Definetly', 'gore-moments', 'surprisingly', 'scariest', 'thing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'blood', 'guts', 'even', 'creatures.It', 'tension', 'actions', 'created', 'characters', 'make', 'cringe.King', 'master', 'exposing', 'human', 'nature', 'what', 'really', 'viewers', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'what', 'people', 'would', 'really', 'do', 'most', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'NOT', 'pretty', 'King', 'main', 'usage', 'stirring', 'up', 'conflict', 'characters', 'shines', 'Marcia', 'Gay-Harden', 'maniacal', 'Christian', 'Crusader', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody.Mrs', 'Carmody', 'one', 'modern', 'horror', 'greatest', 'villians', 'opinion', 'acts', 'proselytizing', 'desperate', 'survivors', 'eerily', 'realistic', 'supremely', 'scary', 'was', 'most', 'frightening', 'part', 'film', 'me.I', 'liked', 'beginning', 'middle', 'film', 'loved', 'underlying', 'messages', 'King', 'littered', 'truly', 'profound', 'horror', 'film', 'sense', 'actually', 'chock-full-of', 'political', 'statements', 'even', 'religious', 'views', 'cheesy', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'had', 'shocking', 'impact', 'me.It', 'definetly', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'ending', 'huge', 'let', 'literally', 'felt', 'crying', 'was', 'seriously', 'depressing', 'downright-somber', 'end', 'horror', 'film', 'left', 'shaking', 'head', 'shock.Really', 'truly', 'one', 'saddest', 'endings', 'horror', 'film', 'ANY', 'other', 'film', 'matter', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'EVER.That', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'emotional', 'thrill', 'ride', 'filled', 'lots', 'scares', 'excellent', 'acting', 'fairly', 'famous', 'cast', 'ton', 'glimpses', 'human', 'mind.I', 'wish', 'ending', 'was', 'different', 'way', 'other', 'way', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'scary-thriller', 'teary', 'eyed', 'depressed.I', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'shaking', 'head', 'disbelief', 'film', 'couple', 'days', 'Which', 'probably', 'sign', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'simple', 'fact', 'disturbed', 'me.I', 'definetly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

Schultz,"[1, 1]","The realism of the people and small-town settings portrayed here draws us in and bands us together with the party trapped in a grocery store, waiting out the coming of whatever ferocity is in the surrounding mist. The camera work and lighting puts us right in the faces of the frightened, beleaguered shoppers. I felt as if I were walking directly behind the store manager, peering over his shoulder as he circulates around the store, whispering counsel, quelling rising tempers, helping to plan escape. Toby Jones does a brilliant job in this part, a total departure from his role as Truman Capote in ""Infamous.""All the actors turn in compelling, realistic performances as each in turn gets spotlighted in the beam of whatever improvised light the shoppers devise when night falls and their power is cut.However, I can't be quite as enthusiastic about the creatures that strike out of the mist. Sometimes these artifacts, with their improbably akimbo limbs and their almost human, craning, questioning faces - even seem to be vaguely comical. With all the advances that have been made in fabrication and CG effects in recent years, these menacing arthropods still didn't seem to match the frightening realism of the attackers in decades-old movies such as ""Them.""Still, the movie is worth watching. It will take you out of yourself into that store-under-siege.Not all of the bonus material on the DVD is as worthwhile though. The Director's commentary is a little flat and uninformative and you can skip it unless you have a lot of extra time.

Along for the ride is neighbor Norton, whom David doesn't normally get along with.  Before leaving home, David and his family wonder about the strange mist hovering over the lake.  Once in town, he discovers the power is out there too, and the checkout lines in the grocery store are long.Then, they notice the mist rolling across the store's parking lot.  They hear screams, and a large earthquake-like thud shakes the store and silences the air raid siren.  A man runs into the store from the mist, informing the people that there's ""things"" out there.  Now trapped inside the store, the large crowd wonders what to do and who to believe.  Shopper Mrs. Carmody, a crazy lady from town, works the desperate crowd into a frenzy of religious fanaticism.  There ARE things in the mist, tentacles and large bugs and flying daemons, and as Mrs. Carmody preaches the end of the world and expiation via blood, David must find a way to save himself and his son, and the few who follow him.I can't help but compare the movie to the story, which I've read several times and consider it one of King's best stories (before he lost his talent and began writing drool).  In the book, King really captured the crowd mentality when people are shoved together in a tight place.  It didn't work as well in the movie translation.  In my summary of the plot, I tried to stay true to the movie, which in all fairness follows the book quite well until the ending.  I was disappointed in the movie for several reasons.  The director used all unknown actors, no big names to anchor the film.  The acting was rather wooden, and Mrs. Carmody should have been older and fatter (plus I miss the bright yellow pantsuit she wore in the book).  The FX was ok but not spectacular.  The scriptwriter changed the ending, and not for the better.  What this film really needed was a bigger budget to make it work; it's not grisly enough to be 'B' horror, and not performed well enough for mainstream films.  All in all, it turns out to be just a mediocre film that didn't live up to my expectations.  Rent, don't buy.

Saul ""opinionated, yet  truthful, mu...","[1, 2]","For a monster movie, this is a great film.The premise is simple, a mist (that spawns all types of monsters) surrounds a supermarket, trapping patrons inside. When somebody goes outside, they get killed in gruesome fashion. While it may appear that there is safety inside, since it is a grocey store , with big plate-glass windows, it is just a matter of time before the monsters get in. What I just described is your basic silly monster movie. The premise is ridiculous and it is unimportant what caused this phenomenon.What makes this movie good, is that the focus is on how the people inside of the grocery store try to cope with each other. There is betrayal, hysteria, allegiances and other relationships which actually is the primary focus of the film. There is a pragmatic and doting father with his son, a crazy religous zealot, mindless small-town yahoos, a pompous lawyer and other representatives of opposite polarities which make the human survivors much more monstrous towards each other than the dinosaur/monsters lurking outside. Like George Romero from ""Night of the Living Dead"", some of the melodramatic conflict is a metaphor for real life issues like racism, religous fanaticism, zenophobia and desperation.SPOILER ALERT. The main knock on this movie is the extremely dark and downer of an ending. The ending is not typical of a mainstream ""happy ending"". The ending is not stupid and it is consistent with the plot and progession of the characters.

Yes, I used the slowest FF speed possible, so I could still see that was happening, but the suspense was too much and the sounds were too creepy to watch it at normal pace.Stephen King's novella upon which this movie was based was brilliant. King excels at taking ordinary people, humanizing their characters by giving them traits and habits we can all relate to, and then putting them into the most extraordinary situations.That's what The Mist does. You can't help but wonder ""what I would I do in that situation?"" and, even though I was watching alone, on a few occasions I found myself shouting at the screen ""turn off the lights!"" ""get the bug spray!"" ""look behind you!""In Alfred Hitchcock's classic The Birds, the scariest scenes involve the characters trapped in a house that is under the siege of thousands of winged attackers. You don't see much, only the terrified faces of the characters. But the sounds! Wings flapping, high pitched bird calls, feathered bodies thumping against the walls and windows - it's one of the scariest scenes on film.The Mist is full of scenes like this, and the tension is kept high for most of the movie's running time.But The Mist is about more than monsters - its a study of how a society under stress falls apart into Lord Of The Flies-like anarchy and primitivism. Here, the movie is less successful. There's a little too much preaching and long stretches of dialog where the the characters discuss and debate what's going on. It's a little heavy handed. We would have understood the conflicts without them being explained to us.It also happens really fast - I think the movie spans two and a half days, by the end of which most of the survivors are willing to offer up human sacrifices to the monsters in the mist. I get what the director was going for, I just wish a strong editor would stepped in to leave a little more to our imagination.The acting is pretty good. I see on other reviews here that some people found Marcia Gay Harden a little  much, but I thought she was brilliant in a role that called for an over-the-top performance. She is, in general, a very accomplished actress, and I actually think she got a lot across with subtlety in this role. Even when she's standing there quietly, there's always something happening in her scheming, panicked eyes. The role is a caricature, but she brings real intelligence and commitment to it. I honestly believe that had she given this performance in a non-genre film, she would have been an Oscar contenderMy major complaint about the movie, though, is the ending. STOP READING NOW if you want to know nothing about how this film ends.Even with that disclaimer, I won't be too specific. I'll just say I thought the ending was needlessly cruel and emotionally sadistic. Just about the worst thing that you can imagine happens. It was clever, but it felt like a cheat. It seemed a betrayal of what happened before, and it made you feel as if the director (who also wrote the screenplay,and who changed the ending of the King story) really hated his characters, which I didn't understand.When the movie was over, I immediately hopped over to the ""extras"" menu, hoping to find an alternate ending that wasn't so mean-spirited. Unfortunately, there wasn't one, and I'm left with a bitter end to what had been a genuinely thrilling film.I'll still give The Mist four stars for how truly scary it was and for great effects and truly horrific creature designs. Maybe less sensitive souls will appreciate the fact that there is no stereotypically ""happy"" ending. But boy, did it have to be THIS brutal?What was up till then an entertainingly thrilling joyride became a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, where the human horror far exceeded that generated by the monsters. I suppose it's a commentary on something, but I'm not sure what. I just know that by seeking to increase the profundity of the ending, and by being so horribly cruel to characters we'd come to know and like, The Mist blew its smoke in the wrong direction.",5,"The Mist: Scary Start, Nail-Biting Middle, Mist-ifying Ending",1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,4177,"['watched', 'Mist', 'alone', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'two', 'occasions', 'characters', 'walked', 'menacing', 'white', 'mist', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'Yes', 'used', 'slowest', 'FF', 'speed', 'possible', 'could', 'still', 'see', 'was', 'happening', 'suspense', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'sounds', 'were', 'too', 'creepy', 'watch', 'normal', 'pace.Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'brilliant', 'King', 'excels', 'taking', 'ordinary', 'people', 'humanizing', 'characters', 'giving', 'traits', 'habits', 'can', 'relate', 'then', 'putting', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'situations.That', 'what', 'Mist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'even', 'was', 'watching', 'alone', 'few', 'occasions', 'found', 'shouting', 'screen', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'get', 'bug', 'spray', 'look', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'Birds', 'scariest', 'scenes', 'involve', 'characters', 'trapped', 'house', 'siege', 'thousands', 'winged', 'attackers', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'only', 'terrified', 'characters', 'sounds', 'Wings', 'flapping', 'high', 'pitched', 'bird', 'calls', 'feathered', 'bodies', 'thumping', 'walls', 'one', 'scariest', 'scenes', 'film.The', 'Mist', 'full', 'scenes', 'tension', 'kept', 'high', 'most', 'movie', 'running', 'Mist', 'more', 'monsters', 'study', 'how', 'society', 'stress', 'apart', 'Lord', 'Flies-like', 'anarchy', 'primitivism', 'Here', 'movie', 'less', 'successful', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'preaching', 'long', 'stretches', 'dialog', 'where', 'characters', 'discuss', 'debate', 'what', 'going', 'little', 'heavy', 'handed', 'would', 'have', 'understood', 'conflicts', 'being', 'explained', 'us.It', 'also', 'really', 'fast', 'think', 'movie', 'two', 'half', 'days', 'end', 'most', 'survivors', 'are', 'willing', 'offer', 'up', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'monsters', 'mist', 'get', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'just', 'wish', 'strong', 'editor', 'would', 'stepped', 'leave', 'little', 'more', 'imagination.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'people', 'found', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'little', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'role', 'called', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'general', 'very', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'actually', 'think', 'got', 'lot', 'subtlety', 'role', 'Even', 'when', 'standing', 'there', 'quietly', 'always', 'something', 'happening', 'scheming', 'panicked', 'eyes', 'role', 'caricature', 'real', 'intelligence', 'commitment', 'honestly', 'believe', 'had', 'given', 'performance', 'non-genre', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Oscar', 'contenderMy', 'major', 'complaint', 'movie', 'ending', 'STOP', 'READING', 'NOW', 'want', 'know', 'nothing', 'how', 'film', 'ends.Even', 'disclaimer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'specific', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'needlessly', 'cruel', 'emotionally', 'sadistic', 'Just', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'imagine', 'happens', 'was', 'clever', 'felt', 'cheat', 'seemed', 'betrayal', 'what', 'happened', 'made', 'feel', 'director', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'who', 'changed', 'ending', 'King', 'story', 'really', 'hated', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand.When', 'movie', 'was', 'immediately', 'hopped', 'extras', 'menu', 'hoping', 'find', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'mean-spirited', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', ""'m"", 'left', 'bitter', 'end', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'genuinely', 'thrilling', 'film.I', ""'ll"", 'still', 'give', 'Mist', 'four', 'stars', 'how', 'truly', 'scary', 'was', 'great', 'effects', 'truly', 'horrific', 'creature', 'designs', 'Maybe', 'less', 'sensitive', 'souls', 'will', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'stereotypically', 'happy', 'ending', 'boy', 'did', 'have', 'be', 'THIS', 'brutal', 'What', 'was', 'up', 'till', 'then', 'entertainingly', 'thrilling', 'joyride', 'became', 'tragedy', 'Shakespearean', 'proportions', 'where', 'human', 'horror', 'far', 'exceeded', 'generated', 'monsters', 'suppose', 'commentary', 'something', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'just', 'know', 'seeking', 'increase', 'profundity', 'ending', 'being', 'so', 'horribly', 'cruel', 'characters', ""'d"", 'come', 'know', 'like', 'Mist', 'blew', 'smoke', 'wrong', 'direction']",N/A

Over a span of only (I believe) two days, the once-ordinary small-town folk degenerate into a bloodthirsty, pseudo-religious mob who sinks to the level of wanting to initiate human sacrifice to appease the monsters outside. Marcia Gay Harden does a brilliant job playing the ultra-religious Mrs. Carmody, who whips the group into a feeding frenzy. You just want to reach through the screen and slap her to shut her up, because you can see what she's doing to stir up turmoil. I don't care how many monsters you throw out there; I can't imagine anything scarier than a mob mentality. Thomas Jane is wonderful as David Drayton, an ordinary guy just trying to protect his son, but over the course of events he gets reluctantly thrust into a leadership role. The cast is truly brilliant here, so much so that individual accolades would take up too much time. Suffice it to say that this is a fascinating, genuinely terrifying horror film that, like any good horror film or story, makes you reflect upon yourself and what you would do if faced with similar circumstances. We all want to imagine ourselves as the hero, but, really, what would happen to our mindset and our grasp on humanity and doing the right thing were we faced with such a situation? I believe that question is truly unanwerable. To put it short, we don't know until we're in it. I would have given The Mist five stars but for one thing: the ending. I did not like it at all, and wish the director Darabont would have stuck with King's original ending in the written story. Without spoiling the ending too much, I'll say that King's original ending would have at least given the audience a glimmer of hope rather than the deeply disturbing conclusion Darabont gives us. Of course, it may be that perhaps in a true horror story, the good guy never wins. Whatever the case may be, if you enjoy a good horror movie that makes you think and sticks with you long after you've finished the movie, than The Mist is definitely for you.",4,disturbing on many levels,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,2558,"['watched', 'first', 'time', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'thinking', 'movie', 'long', 'had', 'finished', 'Mist', 'perfect', 'examination', 'rapid', 'disintegration', 'civilization', 'humanity', 'when', 'faced', 'horrifying', 'circumstances', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'read', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'based', 'Mist', 'group', 'people', 'trapped', 'supermarket', 'otherworldly', 'mist', 'containing', 'violent', 'creatures', 'swirls', 'outside', 'what', 'more', 'terrifying', 'are', 'happenings', 'store', 'span', 'only', 'believe', 'two', 'days', 'once-ordinary', 'small-town', 'folk', 'degenerate', 'bloodthirsty', 'pseudo-religious', 'mob', 'who', 'level', 'wanting', 'initiate', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'appease', 'monsters', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'brilliant', 'job', 'playing', 'ultra-religious', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'who', 'group', 'feeding', 'frenzy', 'just', 'want', 'reach', 'screen', 'slap', 'shut', 'up', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'stir', 'up', 'turmoil', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'many', 'monsters', 'throw', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anything', 'scarier', 'mob', 'mentality', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'wonderful', 'David', 'Drayton', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'just', 'trying', 'protect', 'son', 'course', 'events', 'reluctantly', 'thrust', 'leadership', 'role', 'cast', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'individual', 'accolades', 'would', 'take', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Suffice', 'say', 'fascinating', 'genuinely', 'terrifying', 'horror', 'film', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'story', 'reflect', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'faced', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'want', 'imagine', 'hero', 'really', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'mindset', 'grasp', 'humanity', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'were', 'faced', 'such', 'situation', 'believe', 'question', 'truly', 'unanwerable', 'put', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'re"", 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Mist', 'five', 'stars', 'one', 'thing', 'ending', 'did', 'not', 'wish', 'director', 'Darabont', 'would', 'have', 'stuck', 'King', 'original', 'ending', 'written', 'story', 'spoiling', 'ending', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'say', 'King', 'original', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'given', 'audience', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'rather', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'conclusion', 'Darabont', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'perhaps', 'true', 'horror', 'story', 'good', 'guy', 'never', 'Whatever', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'enjoy', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'think', 'sticks', 'long', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'movie', 'Mist', 'definitely']",N/A

1126922,A3TDJYEQCXG1DA,B0010X73ZG,Sera69,"[0, 3]","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Its chucklesome special effects and one dimensional characterisation never get in the way of a good monster flick. The original short story is one of the most gripping Stephen King has done and no director could really go wrong with the source material, however, I'm not as totally convinced as others who seem to want to rate this as a modern day 'Birds'. It isn't. There are too many 'Wait a minute...' moments. And that ending! I love to be surprised and I'm as much for a downbeat end to a horror film as anyone, but forgive me, this was laughable. Talk about twisting the knife one to many times!Spoiler alert, the ending is nigh... Skip to the last paragraph now to avoid disappointment...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...The first thing that jars for me is the tentacles. Our hero hacks one off the monster and when he subsequently explains, to the whole store only a couple of people go back to view the limb. Excuse me? Flying tentacled monster stole the bag-boy? I wanna see!! Then the rubber thing conveniently goes and dissolves. Why? Cause it's a dumb movie...Then is the rapid conversion of some three quarters of the store to 'fire and brimstone' Christianity. I'm not above turning to religion in a crisis but this happens within 24 hours! The sacrifice of a soldier is thus, unrealistic. Considering we find out, in a cool bug skirmish, that 'the army done it' it would have been far easier and more dramatic for the crowd to turn on the soldier as some means of releasing their frustration at the scientists and the military and then turn to religion as absolution for their murder. It would have been very easy to script that into the movie, making the religious nut a more rounded, sympathetic character in the process. It would also have provided ample evidence of the fraying of these peoples lives and significantly increased the tension. But no...Third is when the monsters break in. The smaller ones are attracted to the light. The bigger ones swoop to feast on them and then come through the glass. Does anyone turn the lights down, even a little? Even after the attack? No. They revert back to candlelight for sure, but, even though I'm no entomologist, in my experience moths are as equally drawn to a glowing candle as to an arc light. Not these beasties. The store dwellers sleep happily and soundly all night.The fourth is the ending. Look away now folk's `cause I'm a-revealing all...It's just too hilarious. The hero escapes with his son, possible love interest and an elderly couple. They drive away unpursued by anything. Anything. Across State lines... Nothing. Passed pile ups and carnage... Nothing (The War of the Worlds is another victim of the 'miraculously clear highways' scenario after a super, mega disaster...) Ridiculous!And then the petrol runs out. The car stalls. The film could end here and it would be fine; an awesome creature feature. But no... The hero counts the bullets: five people, four bullets. It could end here and be viewed as compelling, with a cliff-hanger of 'Italian Job' proportions. But no... Despite none of the four adults having shown any signs of fatalism or depression they opt to end it. He makes the choice and shoots the others including his son (Utterly out of character! And, hey, no complaining, I warned you about the spoilers!) He screams his rage, leaves the car and heads out into the mist challenging the monsters 'Come on! Come on!' The film could end here and it would have been wonderfully downbeat. Certainly close to the classic status some have given it.But no...The mist clears and the Army come trundling along in their tanks and then, SECONDS later, refugee wagons roll passed full of survivors. Barely meters from the outskirts of a deadly, other-world disaster? Nonsense! So, the Monsters are defeated. Oh, if only our hero had waited 60 seconds... His tears flow. His rage and desperation! Oh no!! It's the egg that over eggs the pudding, the extra cook that spoils the broth, the straw that breaks the camels back. It turns the whole movie into a joke. Something you won't want to watch to the end ever again. Darabont blows it.... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...So, final advice: The Mist is a great, scary, tense movie with convincing CGI (if a little rubber in the prosthetics), frightening set-ups and just a little wrenching on the heart-strings and if you skip the last minute or even the last 30 seconds you'll love it for a long, long time. Just try not to smirk, laugh, guffaw, chortle or split your sides if you stay to the end because this is one movie that doesn't need a directors' cut it needs a studio cut!",4,Spoiler Alert!,1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,4726,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'chucklesome', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characterisation', 'never', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'monster', 'flick', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'gripping', 'Stephen', 'King', 'done', 'director', 'could', 'really', 'go', 'wrong', 'source', 'material', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'convinced', 'others', 'who', 'seem', 'want', 'rate', 'modern', 'day', ""'Birds"", ""n't"", 'are', 'too', 'many', ""'Wait"", 'minute', 'moments', 'ending', 'love', 'be', 'surprised', ""'m"", 'as', 'much', 'downbeat', 'end', 'horror', 'film', 'anyone', 'forgive', 'was', 'laughable', 'Talk', 'twisting', 'knife', 'one', 'many', 'times', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'ending', 'nigh', 'Skip', 'last', 'paragraph', 'now', 'avoid', 'disappointment', 'first', 'thing', 'tentacles', 'hero', 'one', 'monster', 'when', 'subsequently', 'whole', 'store', 'only', 'couple', 'people', 'go', 'back', 'view', 'limb', 'Excuse', 'Flying', 'tentacled', 'monster', 'stole', 'bag-boy', 'wan', 'na', 'see', 'Then', 'rubber', 'thing', 'conveniently', 'dissolves', 'Why', 'Cause', 'dumb', 'movie', 'Then', 'rapid', 'conversion', 'three', 'quarters', 'store', ""'fire"", 'brimstone', 'Christianity', ""'m"", 'not', 'turning', 'religion', 'crisis', '24', 'hours', 'sacrifice', 'soldier', 'thus', 'unrealistic', 'Considering', 'find', 'out', 'cool', 'bug', 'skirmish', ""'the"", 'army', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'easier', 'more', 'dramatic', 'crowd', 'turn', 'soldier', 'means', 'releasing', 'frustration', 'scientists', 'military', 'then', 'turn', 'religion', 'absolution', 'murder', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'script', 'movie', 'making', 'religious', 'nut', 'more', 'rounded', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'process', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'provided', 'ample', 'evidence', 'fraying', 'peoples', 'lives', 'significantly', 'increased', 'tension', 'Third', 'when', 'monsters', 'break', 'smaller', 'ones', 'are', 'attracted', 'light', 'bigger', 'ones', 'swoop', 'feast', 'then', 'come', 'glass', 'Does', 'anyone', 'turn', 'lights', 'down', 'even', 'little', 'Even', 'attack', 'No', 'revert', 'back', 'candlelight', 'sure', 'even', ""'m"", 'entomologist', 'experience', 'moths', 'are', 'equally', 'drawn', 'glowing', 'candle', 'arc', 'light', 'Not', 'beasties', 'store', 'dwellers', 'sleep', 'happily', 'soundly', 'night.The', 'fourth', 'ending', 'Look', 'away', 'now', 'folk', 'cause', ""'m"", 'a-revealing', 'just', 'too', 'hilarious', 'hero', 'son', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'elderly', 'couple', 'drive', 'away', 'unpursued', 'anything', 'Anything', 'State', 'lines', 'Nothing', 'Passed', 'ups', 'carnage', 'Nothing', 'War', 'Worlds', 'victim', ""'miraculously"", 'clear', 'highways', 'scenario', 'super', 'mega', 'disaster', 'Ridiculous', 'then', 'petrol', 'out', 'car', 'stalls', 'film', 'could', 'end', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'awesome', 'creature', 'feature', 'hero', 'bullets', 'five', 'people', 'four', 'bullets', 'could', 'end', 'here', 'be', 'viewed', 'compelling', 'cliff-hanger', ""'Italian"", 'Job', 'proportions', 'none', 'four', 'adults', 'having', 'shown', 'signs', 'fatalism', 'depression', 'opt', 'end', 'choice', 'shoots', 'others', 'including', 'son', 'Utterly', 'character', 'hey', 'complaining', 'warned', 'spoilers', 'rage', 'car', 'out', 'mist', 'challenging', 'monsters', 'Come', 'film', 'could', 'end', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderfully', 'downbeat', 'Certainly', 'close', 'classic', 'status', 'have', 'given', 'it.But', 'mist', 'clears', 'Army', 'come', 'trundling', 'along', 'tanks', 'then', 'SECONDS', 'later', 'refugee', 'wagons', 'roll', 'passed', 'full', 'survivors', 'Barely', 'meters', 'outskirts', 'deadly', 'other-world', 'disaster', 'Nonsense', 'So', 'Monsters', 'are', 'defeated', 'Oh', 'only', 'hero', 'had', 'waited', '60', 'seconds', 'tears', 'flow', 'rage', 'desperation', 'Oh', 'egg', 'pudding', 'extra', 'cook', 'broth', 'straw', 'camels', 'back', 'whole', 'movie', 'joke', 'Something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'end', 'ever', 'again', 'Darabont', 'So', 'final', 'advice', 'Mist', 'great', 'scary', 'tense', 'movie', 'convincing', 'CGI', 'little', 'rubber', 'prosthetics', 'frightening', 'set-ups', 'just', 'little', 'wrenching', 'heart-strings', 'skip', 'last', 'minute', 'even', 'last', '30', 'seconds', ""'ll"", 'love', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'Just', 'try', 'not', 'smirk', 'laugh', 'guffaw', 'chortle', 'split', 'sides', 'stay', 'end', 'one', 'movie', ""n't"", 'need', 'directors', 'cut', 'studio', 'cut']",N/A

1126926,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B0010X73ZG,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[2, 6]","This is a review of the story/movie, not the disc.As with many a Stephen King story, there is often a mesh of twisted scriptures, at least one literary Christ figure, horrible things from the unknown, and at least one underlying moral. This has got a blender-full of all of that... but in the famous words of Blendtech, ""will it blend?"" Not exactly.After a harrowing storm, the lead character, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) heads to town with his crotchety neighbor and son to get supplies to fix a broken window. A strange mist is seen over the lake, but dismissed as storm after-glow and they head to the local food mart, full of every stereotypical character from the one-horse town.As the mist envelopes the community, military vehicles are racing to and fro and the air raid siren goes off. A bloodied old man runs to the store, proclaiming that they need to lock the doors - something in the mist took a local. Took them. Yeah- and they believe him. You gotta start this story somewhere.Enter local loon and Messiah-in-waiting, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden). As always, Harden is the consummate actress. She couldn't act poorly if forced to at gun point - so bravo for her, but thumbs down for this looney portrayal of a scripture twisting nutjob that half the occupants of the store begin to nearly worship and some end up killing for her on command.The mob rule mentality - ok, I'll buy that. People are basically evil by nature - we need constant enforcement by society, parents, laws and faith to keep us from killing each other - when threatened by a definitely lethal unknown, with no reasonable hope of rescue, people will sacrifice their own mother if it makes them feel better.For someone who can quickly turn to the pages of her Bible she had conveniently stowed away with her in her purse, for just such an occasion, Carmody is foul-mouthed and not too hip on scriptures as she purports. She refers to the book of ""Revelations"" - in absolutely NO VERSION of the Bible is this book in the plural. It's a common mistake, but in a final script, laughable.  While Carmody is the voice of chaos, Drayton is the voice of reason - yet he is akin to a John the Baptist at first - a lone voice crying in the wilderness.A handful of the store occupants go to the loading dock to see why the generator is failing. Despite Drayton's warnings that he heard 'something' eerie outside the door, the testosterone is raging too high for these small-minded country folk who resent education and success, and they must prove themselves by venturing into the mist. I do tire very much so of this stereotype of the simpleton in the small town who has no respect for those with an education, yet those who are college educated are by definition, sound, logical and always right. Uh... no. But ok, we roll with it... the eerie music continues...As you expect by the music, sweat, testosterone and raised voices, the source of the eerie sound that Drayton heard, comes through the door opening via an extremely nasty set of tentacles that come right out of the worst nightmare you've ever had, after having seen cockroaches, then getting food poisoning. The thing is viciously strong, almost intelligent, full of rage and spikes that will take the flesh off an elephant with merely a love tap. The machismo men that were all hell-bent for leather to fix the generator stand like monuments as the poor lad gets eviscerated by the unknown goblin thing that eventually pulls him into the mist.Even the remnant of a tentacle chopped off with an axe is not enough to convince an otherwise apathetic crowd. Drayton's crotchety neighbor is delusional in his refusal to even look at the evidence, and races to his death with other disbelievers to prove that they're right, as they march out the door, into the mist. Can you say ""dismembered body parts?"" Oh yes, the flesh eating monsters know to leave parts behind just to scare the rest of their food - that makes perfect sense.Night falls, and we're not just talking tentacles anymore. We've got some jurassic freaking mosquitos that can suck the lava out of a volcano for breakfast and some bat-looking things - it's like Pandora's box threw up in this little town. The mist is all kinds of messed up. It's the stuff that Noah purposefully did not take on the ark... and it's attracted to light and these idiots are all pointing giant spotlights out a window at night into a white fog, but somehow they actually see outside instead of their own reflections. Yah - physics takes on unique properties in this store. The phones don't work. No cell phones. No land lines - but the power just goes on for days in this one grocery store. Yup.Tensions mount. One bathroom, no showers, lots of folks who all have their own issues, all getting mind bent over this house of horrors going on outside - thinking of their loved ones who are likely already being digested and pooped out - not a recipe for normal thinking or calm attitudes.Considering Anne Frank, her family and 2 other families were hidden away successfully in an attic for 2 years with Nazis constantly looking for people who were hidden away, and they still remained civilized, these people are ready to eat their own young after just 2 days. Well, maybe not their own young, but Mrs. Carmody is more than willing to sacrifice your son to satisfy God's wrath.Thanks to 3 young military officers (two of which hang themselves... giving you a hint of how well they thought the situation was going to play out) trapped in the store, the truth comes out as to what the mist is, and where these creatures have come from. It's not good, and I don't want to spoil it for you... it's a believable explanation - I mean - other than ""you're just having the worst nightmare you've ever had,"" there really isn't another one that's feasible in my opinion.  The concern is, will this ever end? Will the creatures ever leave? Is this a local or world-wide phenomenon? Is there any hope other than just being the last one to be unkown critter vittles?The morals are many in this tale:-don't jump to conclusions-two days is not long enough to decide that this will last forever without end - how about a little more faith & endurance, people?-suicide is rarely a choice that in the end solves your immediate problem... you're still dead-let calmer heads prevail-even the calmest head can lose reality when surrounded by crazies and craziness for daysThe special effects are GOOD. The Foley sounds are GOOD and eerie. There's a lot of blood, dismemberment and sinew - not one for kids or for expectant mothers. The story is all over the map. A little less drama in the store would have made more sense. The movie just goes on forever. Tensions are so high, people in the theater laughed out loud when certain characters were killed... out of a sense of relief that their blathering dialog would finally end. The movie loses a couple of stars for the out of balance portrayal of Mrs. Carmody - no one there with sensible counter arguments to her non-sensical ramblings on how this was proof that God was heaping his wrath upon this town for such sins as splitting the atom! Yes, we all remember that one from Deuteronomy! I didn't buy the sudden devotion/following this crazy lady had in just what appeared to be 36 hours. She spoke with authority, but was kooky and over the top - I think in a real world scenario, it would have taken at least a week for her to get that kind of following. When you think you're going to be eaten alive by a hideous, heartless unknown (I mean,it's not like it's a bear that's got cubs to feed or anything), the last thing you want to hear is the nagging, raised voice of a woman... and I AM a woman, and I don't want to hear it. Someone would have strangled her before she had more than a handful of followers were this to (God forbid) play out in real life.There were also continuation errors - most notably, a revolver that had been used several times, magically is fully loaded after being dropped by the gunman, after he is consumed by one of these instruments of God's purported wrath. I did find myself on the edge of my seat in spots - the acting is very good and the unknown is often far scarier than the known. This movie could have been a lot better. A LOT better. It was worthwhile seeing ONCE. I don't buy a DVD unless I plan on viewing a film repeatedly - this is one I never ever have to see again. It's scary, bloody and insulting on purpose - and in the end, it is ultimately a story devoid of happiness, hope or reprieve. I suppose in a way, as a Stephen King story, it's a resounding success in that it is a story that haunts you - but doesn't real life do that, anyway? In the end, you will leave this film utterly disappointed and depressed - I just don't see how anyone could have a different perspective after seeing it. If that's what turns you on in a movie, by all means - watch with impunity!",3,And the moral of the story is?,1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,8928,"['review', 'story/movie', 'not', 'disc.As', 'many',

The protagonist, Bill Drayton played by Thomas Jane, find ways to leave but are trapped inside the supermarket, if they try to leave, they get killed in the mist. Soon unable to bear the suspense of being holed up, a few try to escape but not with disastrous consequences.This movie tries to be more a study of human behaviour in times of terrible conflict (as explained by Thomas Jane's character when he says, ""Everybody is decent, as long as there is light and you can dial 9-1-1, once that is all taken away and your in the dark, what will you become""), but fails quite miserably in the process. The only truly remarkable actress in this movie is that of Mrs. Carmody, played by Marcia Harden, who plays a manipulative, despicable virago and doomsayer, that she really creates a hatred inside of you for her, when you see her role.Overall, this movie would have been better if it had been directed well, but it fails quite poorly with average acting (except for the above mentioned) and cliched attempt at horror (when you realize the explanation of the reason of the mist).Very average film, only worth at best a weeknight rental.",2,"wish i had ""mist"" this one....",1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,1380,"['story', 'mist', 'storm', 'based', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'suddenly', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'certain', 'mysterious', 'entities', 'mist', 'people.A', 'group', 'people', 'supermarket', 'hide', 'stay', 'cover', 'protagonist', 'Bill', 'Drayton', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'find', 'ways', 'leave', 'are', 'trapped', 'supermarket', 'try', 'leave', 'get', 'killed', 'mist', 'Soon', 'unable', 'bear', 'suspense', 'being', 'holed', 'up', 'few', 'try', 'escape', 'not', 'disastrous', 'consequences.This', 'movie', 'tries', 'be', 'more', 'study', 'human', 'behaviour', 'times', 'terrible', 'conflict', 'explained', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'character', 'when', 'Everybody', 'decent', 'as', 'long', 'light', 'can', 'dial', '9-1-1', 'once', 'taken', 'away', 'dark', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'quite', 'miserably', 'process', 'only', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'actress', 'movie', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Harden', 'who', 'manipulative', 'despicable', 'virago', 'doomsayer', 'really', 'hatred', 'inside', 'when', 'see', 'role.Overall', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'well', 'quite', 'poorly', 'average', 'acting', 'above', 'mentioned', 'cliched', 'attempt', 'horror', 'when', 'realize', 'explanation', 'reason', 'mist', '.Very', 'average', 'film', 'only', 'worth', 'best', 'weeknight', 'rental']",N/A

1126929,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B0010X73ZG,Sky,"[7, 7]","In 1920, H. P. Lovecraft wrote a short story called From Beyond about an alien environment inhabited by horrific creatures that overlaps with our own environment. Stephen King often gives credit to Lovecraft as inspiration for his Horror writings (seeStephen King's Danse Macabre).Therefore, it's no surprise--and perhaps not a coincidence--that King wrote a story circa 1980 called The Mist that explores what might happen if a window to that alien environment was inadvertently opened...wide...releasing a dense mist filled with monsters. (The Mist was later published in one of King's collection of short stories calledSkeleton Crew{1985}.)Fast forward to the late 2007 release of a feature film adaptation of The Mist. But what's really interesting is that the director of The Mist is the same guy that directedThe Shawshank Redemption...Frank Darabont...so my expectations for The Mist were very high! (Darabont also directed King'sThe Green Mile.)And my high expectations were met in the film adaptation of The Mist...mostly. The story in the movie is very loyal to the book (as I remember anyway...I read it more than 20 years ago!): A monster infested mist descends on a small lakeside town, and we follow the perils of a group of townspeople trapped in a grocery store when the mist hits. On screen, some of the actions and decisions by the terrified captives are a little hard to grasp, and the movie has a truly haunting and affecting ending that was much more depressing than the book's. Otherwise, the story from the book seems completely intact.There's great suspense. Good acting. I was thoroughly entertained. And unlike too many film adaptations of King's Horror stuff...The Mist was very well done and preserved a lot of the prose, shock and character of the original story.Any Horror fan should enjoy The Mist, and any fan of King and the original story shouldn't miss this DVD.",4,From Beyond,1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,1897,"['1920', 'H.', 'P.', 'Lovecraft', 'wrote', 'short', 'story', 'called', 'Beyond', 'alien', 'environment', 'inhabited', 'horrific', 'creatures', 'overlaps', 'own', 'environment', 'Stephen', 'King', 'often', 'credit', 'Lovecraft', 'inspiration', 'Horror', 'writings', 'seeStephen', 'King', 'Danse', 'Macabre', '.Therefore', 'surprise', 'perhaps', 'not', 'coincidence', 'King', 'wrote', 'story', 'circa', '1980', 'called', 'Mist', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'window', 'alien', 'environment', 'was', 'inadvertently', 'opened', 'wide', 'releasing', 'dense', 'mist', 'filled', 'monsters', 'Mist', 'was', 'later', 'published', 'one', 'King', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'calledSkeleton', 'Crew', '1985', 'Fast', 'forward', 'late', '2007', 'release', 'feature', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Mist', 'what', 'really', 'interesting', 'director', 'Mist', 'same', 'guy', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'so', 'expectations', 'Mist', 'were', 'very', 'high', 'Darabont', 'also', 'directed', ""King'sThe"", 'Green', 'Mile', 'high', 'expectations', 'were', 'met', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Mist', 'mostly', 'story', 'movie', 'very', 'loyal', 'book', 'remember', 'anyway', 'read', 'more', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'monster', 'infested', 'mist', 'descends', 'small', 'lakeside', 'town', 'follow', 'perils', 'group', 'townspeople', 'trapped', 'grocery', 'store', 'when', 'mist', 'hits', 'screen', 'actions', 'decisions', 'terrified', 'captives', 'are', 'little', 'hard', 'grasp', 'movie', 'truly', 'haunting', 'affecting', 'ending', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'depressing', 'book', 'Otherwise', 'story', 'book', 'completely', 'great', 'suspense', 'Good', 'acting', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'too', 'many', 'film', 'adaptations', 'King', 'Horror', 'stuff', 'Mist', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'preserved', 'lot', 'prose', 'shock', 'character', 'original', 'story.Any', 'Horror', 'fan', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Mist', 'fan', 'King', 'original', 'story', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss', 'DVD']",N/A

This movie was so dumb that I don't think I'll even be able to right an intelligent sounding review about it, so bear with me.  Btw, I gave it two stars because it's a decent kids movie....for the ones old enough to see some gore.I suppose I watched about the 1st half hour, just enough to see the first monster, and then then dumb factor went off the scale.  After that, I had no choice but to skim through the rest of it, stopping at the various  monster scenes to see if any of the stupidity had cleared up.For example, how many more ridiculous scenes must we be subjected to where one person gets attacked and ten others stand around with their mouths open?  Somehow, in some bizarre way, this is still considered good writing and good acting, but not in my book.And how stupid to they think the audience is, putting characters in that belong in a mental ward.  For example, when the mist first gets to the store, they hear one man screaming, and another comes running in with a bloody face, saying that 'something took him'.This immediately tells the characters what will happen if they venture into the mist.But then, for the first monster scene, we are treated to 3 redneck morons who are ready to open the door and go outside as if the mist is all silliness.  But then if the mist is just silliness, what is everybody hiding in the store for?This is a kids movie, with 'big scary monsters', and I have no doubt I would have loved this when I was ten or 12.  But at 34, I'm looking for at least a thin slice of reality in the movies I watch.The characters were dumb......literally idiots.  When you have an unbelievable monster movie, you have to make some other part believable so the audience can relate in some small way........that assumes the audience cares of course, and apparently many don't.May as well call this one a cash cow.  Combine top quality CGI monsters with the usual batch of cliches, and if you get lucky, you'll land a big paycheck.

That sums it up neatly.The first half is a tightly paced, suspenseful thriller.  Expertly executed, I was fully engrossed for the first hour or so.But then, whoa nelly!  What happened?  Pretension crept in, and suddenly we're watching something that the filmmakers obviously considered more ""important"" than a monster movie.  And I'm sure many would agree with me - the second half is ultimately more important than the first half.  A great pay-off can compensate for an uneven start.  But a killer start isn't going to really look so good after a soggy, half-baked conclusion.I don't want to spoil anything.  The movie is fun enough, and worth a rental.  But suffice it to say that when it was over I started thinking of all the movies this one cribbed bits and pieces from.  Let's see, ""Night of the Living Dead"" (and the other Romero 'Dead' films, for that matter), ""The Fog"", ""Tremors"", and about at least a hundred others.As a God-fearing Christian, I took minor offense to the old lady character who preached throughout the movie about how all the scary events taking place signaled the end of days.

1126937,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0010X73ZG,S. Rhodes,"[4, 5]","Stephen King adaptations are funny. There are some really good ones out there (Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, 1408)... some that are good but are in turn nothing like the books they were based on (Kubrick's The Shining) and some that are well... horrible (Pet Sematary, Dreamcatcher, Children of the Corn).  The Mist falls into the first category.  It's right up there as being one of the best.  It is not as good as any of the movies listed as being the good ones above (Shawshank is still the best of them all), but it's really good.After a freak storm in a small Maine town, the denizens must find a way to rebuild and reconstruct.  David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) decide to go to the store with friend Brent Norton (played by Andre Braugher).  Because of the storm, the power is out all over town, but what's really strange is that there's a mist ebbing closer and closer.At the store, the mist gets closer.  A screaming man eventually comes into the store, warning that there's something in the mist.  Something inhuman.  He's got all the qualities of a guy who barely escaped death.  He's panicked, out of breath and he's bleeding.  Some crazed religious woman named Mrs. Carmody (played extremely well by Marcia Gay Harden) warns that its death out there.  No one wants to leave for a moment.  And then a man tries to and the mist envelopes him and he screams such a horrid scream.  The people are now scared to leave.  David decides to go to the back and check on the backup generator and then he hears something.  He comes out of the back room panicked.  The others don't believe he heard anything because he, like everyone else, is a little on edge.  So they go to check.  Dave heads back with Jim (played by William Sadler--who actually showed up in The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption... Darabont must like him), Ollie (Toby Jones), Norm (Chris Owen) and Myron (David Jensen).  David continues to warn them that something is out there in the mist.  Norm volunteers to go out there and clear some of the mist surrounding the generator.  When they lift the shutter everything looks fine at first, until a tentacle slithers in and grabs Norm.  The other men try to rescue him, only to fail and Norm is dragged off into the mist right before their very eyes.  It's a gruesome sight and particularly bloody.No one believes the returning men when they tell them about it.  More people go out into the mist and die.  Mrs. Carmody eventually begins preaching that its the end of days come.  When they finally show the store manager that there really is something out there (because there's a piece of tentacle lying on the ground along with Norm's blood) they decide to hold off in the store as long as possible.  But of course, Mrs. Carmody doesn't believe it'll do anything.  When cabin fever sets in and Mrs. Carmody starts to be right about a few things... the people who once thought she was crazy now start to think she's right.  Because they, like many of us when faced with the unknown, want answers, and she seems to have them.  Pretty soon people begin pointing fingers and trying to find someone to blame for the mist.  And pretty soon they begin trying to find people to sacrifice.  The store becomes divided between those who support David and those who support Mrs. Carmody.  But David and his supporters are outnumbered.  And pretty soon the real focus isn't the monsters, but which is worse.  Being trapped in a store with people who have gone mad... or venturing out into the mist full of monsters?  Either way, David and his supporters all run the risk of being killed.  Either by the monsters in the mist... or killed by people who have gone crazy.The reason The Mist works so well is not because of the monsters but because of the characters trapped in the market.  All of them are played believably well.  The fear of the movie doesn't come from the monsters either, but rather comes from the human reactions to the events.  If Saw and Hostel were your cup of Tea, then The Mist is a very different film indeed.In terms of writing, there's nothing to stark here.  Most of the dialog spoken from the characters is ripped directly from the book.  And it manages to be good.  While the portions dealing with the monsters are far between, it's quite clear the movie wasn't meant to be about them.The only problem with Darabont's movie, really, is the ending.  Is it a good ending?  Yes.  Will it draw a lot of emotion from you?  Sure.  Will you like it?  There's a divide there.  More than likely you won't.  It is certainly far different from the original ending King had.  I personally did not like the ending but that does not make it a BAD ending.  But if how good an ending is is judged by the reaction, then Darabont has more than likely made a good one.  I will not give it away.  But it IS an ending that could change how much you like or dislike the movie.The Mist is a pretty good film.  A nice departure from where horror genre is.  This is not torture porn, nor is it a massacre filled with blood and guts all over.  It's a movie filled with human emotion and reaction.  If you're looking for a bloodbath of a movie, you won't find it here.  If, however, you're looking for a movie with some good characters and an ending that'll really evoke a strong reaction (whether positive or negative) then you'll get it with The Mist.",5,What Lurks in

1126938,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B0010X73ZG,S. Schell,"[1, 3]","""The Mist"", based on the novella by Stephen King, has a small group of people holed up inside a supermarket after an all-encompassing impenetrable vapor cloud rolls through the entire town.  It doesn't take long before a local man bursts through the doors in a blind panic, blood on his face and clothes and ranting about ""something in the mist"" that dragged his friend away.  From there we are led on a moderately-paced ride of suspense as strange and frightening creatures emerge from the fog, the death toll increases and the main characters make a last ditch effort at escape only to meet a fate worse than what awaits them outside the safe confines of the supermarket.For those that have been reading all the customer reviews (positive and negative alike), the ending has already been spoiled (and had it not been, I would've had no qualms about spoiling it myself - it's THAT BAD).Quite frankly, I think it speaks for itself.  Let me just say that it's like slapping down $40 for a great steak...and then getting food poisoning.  I did feel pretty sick to my stomach, steak or no steak, after watching the last ten minutes.  It's artistic license at its worst.I was also disappointed to see a talented director like Frank Darabont make a mockery of his previous efforts with an ending designed for maximum shock value.  Instead of giving the story the dignity that it deserves (and King actually SANCTIONED this new and horrific twist), Darabont instead has managed to churn out a movie capped by an outrageous denouement that has absolutely no artistic merit.  For fans of Darabont's previous work (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile), be forewarned - you will have the distinct urge to turn the other cheek at his future releases.  Anyone can shock and/or surprise, but if they do so with proficiency and artistry, they are to be commended.  There is nothing commendable about what Darabont has done to rework one of Stephen King's best stories.  On paper, ""The Mist"" remains a masterpiece.  On film, it is a near disaster.Having gotten that out of the way, I feel should I point out the movie's strong suits.  The first is the design of the creatures that wander through the mist, especially the larger ones.  Two giants who make appearances first at a halfway point through the film then the other in the last fifteen minutes are quite a wonder of conceptual design.  The screenplay is also good but I do feel that some of the characters are extreme, the religious fanatic in particular played by Marcia Gay Harden.  Of course, every good story needs a good antagonist, someone whom the reader constantly wishes would receive their comeuppance.  To quote from another of Darabont's films (The Shawshank Redemption), ""His Judgment cometh and that right soon.""Second is the wrenching performance of the film's lead actor Thomas Jane as the film's protagonist David Drayton.  Although I hated the ending, I thought Jane gave a commendable portrayal of a man tortured by his decision.  Also noteworthy is Nathan Gamble as David's son Billy - his performance was neither trite nor maudlin in the least.  Harden is a bit much with her fire-and-brimstone rhetoric as the sanctimonious Mrs. Carmody while the rest of the supporting cast blend in with one another.Bottom line: the film is excellent up until the last ten minutes.  Had a different ending been used and the ""gotcha"" ending (to quote another reviewer) became an alternative ending, I would've been much happier with it and would've even considered adding it to my collection of DVDs at home.What a shame...",3,Almost Great,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,3573,"['Mist', 'based', 'novella', 'Stephen', 'King', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'holed', 'up', 'supermarket', 'all-encompassing', 'impenetrable', 'vapor', 'cloud', 'rolls', 'entire', 'town', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'local', 'man', 'doors', 'blind', 'panic', 'blood', 'face', 'clothes', 'ranting', 'something', 'mist', 'dragged', 'friend', 'away', 'are', 'led', 'moderately-paced', 'ride', 'suspense', 'strange', 'frightening', 'creatures', 'emerge', 'fog', 'death', 'toll', 'increases', 'main', 'characters', 'make', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'escape', 'only', 'meet', 'fate', 'worse', 'what', 'safe', 'confines', 'supermarket.For', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'customer', 'reviews', 'positive', 'negative', 'alike', 'ending', 'already', 'been', 'spoiled', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'qualms', 'spoiling', 'BAD', '.Quite', 'frankly', 'think', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'slapping', 'down', '40', 'great', 'steak', 'then', 'getting', 'food', 'poisoning', 'did', 'feel', 'pretty', 'sick', 'stomach', 'steak', 'steak', 'watching', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'artistic', 'license', 'worst.I', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'see', 'talented', 'director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'make', 'mockery', 'previous', 'efforts', 'ending', 'designed', 'maximum', 'shock', 'value', 'Instead', 'giving', 'story', 'dignity', 'King', 'actually', 'SANCTIONED', 'new', 'horrific', 'twist', 'Darabont', 'instead', 'managed', 'churn', 'out', 'movie', 'capped', 'outrageous', 'denouement', 'absolutely', 'artistic', 'merit', 'fans', 'Darabont', 'previous', 'work', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Green', 'Mile', 'be', 'forewarned', 'will', 'have', 'distinct', 'urge', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'future', 'Anyone', 'can', 'shock', 'and/or', 'surprise', 'do', 'so', 'proficiency', 'artistry', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'nothing', 'commendable', 'what', 'Darabont', 'done', 'rework', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'best', 'stories', 'paper', 'Mist', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'near', 'disaster.Having', 'gotten', 'way', 'feel', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'movie', 'strong', 'suits', 'first', 'design', 'creatures', 'wander', 'mist', 'especially', 'larger', 'ones', 'Two', 'giants', 'who', 'make', 'appearances', 'first', 'halfway', 'point', 'film', 'then', 'other', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'are', 'quite', 'wonder', 'conceptual', 'design', 'screenplay', 'also', 'good', 'do', 'feel', 'characters', 'are', 'extreme', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'particular', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'course', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'antagonist', 'someone', 'whom', 'reader', 'constantly', 'wishes', 'would', 'receive', 'comeuppance', 'quote', 'Darabont', 'films', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Judgment', 'cometh', 'right', 'soon', 'Second', 'wrenching', 'performance', 'film', 'lead', 'actor', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'film', 'protagonist', 'David', 'Drayton', 'hated', 'ending', 'thought', 'Jane', 'gave', 'commendable', 'portrayal', 'man', 'tortured', 'decision', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'David', 'son', 'Billy', 'performance', 'was', 'trite', 'maudlin', 'least', 'Harden', 'bit', 'much', 'fire-and-brimstone', 'rhetoric', 'sanctimonious', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'blend', 'one', 'another.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'excellent', 'up', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Had', 'different', 'ending', 'been', 'used', 'gotcha', 'ending', 'quote', 'reviewer', 'became', 'alternative', 'ending', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'happier', 'would', ""'ve"", 'even', 'considered', 'adding', 'collection', 'DVDs', 'home.What', 'shame']",N/A

1126943,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0010X73ZG,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[4, 7]","I've always been touchy about the idea of a film version of The Mist considering it's my favorite Stephen King story.  Plus, it's a story I'd rather remember the way I visualized it while reading it than anything that would end up on film.  I wouldn't have given this movie a second thought if it hadn't been directed by Frank Darabont, who's probably the best at sticking to King's books.The Mist is a story of a group of people stranded in a grocery store surrounded by a thick mist full of Lovecraftian beasties.  Of course when you get a group of people together in this kind of horror movie situation, they tend to fall into the usual cliched categories of good guys and bad guys.  It then becomes more of a character study of human behavior, and the outside threat becomes secondary.  It's a premise as old as Night of the Living Dead, but it's a premise I've always found fascinating.All in all I thought the movie was good.  With a few minor exceptions, Darabont is pretty much letter perfect with the King story.  The acting was all around decent and the pacing was good.  My only real complaints come with the creatures.  I don't care what anyone says, fully computer generated monsters do not look good.  They look like something from a video game, and I think it's a cop out to use them.  Animatronic creatures with computer enhancements would have been good because it would at least look like something was actually there with the actors, yet fluid moving enough so it didn't look totally fake.The big controversy about The Mist is the ending.  No one will shut up about, so I guess I won't either.  This is the biggest difference between the novella and the movie.  King left us with an open, ""choose your own ending"" type of ending for the story.  Darabont leaves us with a grim Twilight Zone type of ending.  Darabont's ending left a real bad taste in a lot of people's mouths(including my wife who complained about it for the rest of the friggin night, totally ruining her mood and depriving me of the nookie I thought I'd be receiving.  Thanks, Frank!).  Of course if Darabont had used King's ending, people would have been whining about that too coz it robs the audience of the closure they so desperately need.  It's a true case of ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"".  I didn't hate Darabont's ending as much as most people did, though I didn't love it either.  I love the flipping of the bird to a Hollywood ending, we certainly need more of that kind of spirit in big budget movies.  It does have it's lapses in logic though.  NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE SPOILER THAT YOU NO DOUBT ALREADY KNOW:  A suicide pact is formed and carried out way too abruptly.  Sure the situation seemed hopeless, but it could have been much more hopeless.  You think you'd hold off on such a life changing decision until it's absolutely down to the wire, especially if your friggin' son is concerned!!  Oh, well.  The film had already been on for about 2 hours at that point, so I guess Darabont just wanted to cut to the chase.  But I do like the suicide and what came afterwards, it's the final slap in the audience's face.  It was just way too abrupt to be remotely realistic.Stephen King writes in his notes in Skeleton Crew that if The Mist were a film, it'd be low budget, in black and white and shown on a drive-in screen.  What a wonderful thought, what a wonderful dream.  Unfortunately in this day and age it will never happen that way.  But I do have to say that for today's state of horror films, The Mist is one of the best we'll see, and Darabont made this great King story probably the best it could have been made.",3,Mist-ifying,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,3631,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'touchy', 'idea', 'film', 'version', 'Mist', 'considering', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'story', ""'d"", 'rather', 'remember', 'way', 'visualized', 'reading', 'anything', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'second', 'thought', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'sticking', 'King', 'books.The', 'Mist', 'story', 'group', 'people', 'stranded', 'grocery', 'store', 'surrounded', 'thick', 'mist', 'full', 'Lovecraftian', 'beasties', 'course', 'when', 'get', 'group', 'people', 'together', 'kind', 'horror', 'movie', 'situation', 'tend', 'fall', 'usual', 'cliched', 'categories', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'human', 'behavior', 'outside', 'threat', 'secondary', 'premise', 'as', 'old', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'premise', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'fascinating.All', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'few', 'minor', 'exceptions', 'Darabont', 'pretty', 'much', 'letter', 'perfect', 'King', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'pacing', 'was', 'good', 'only', 'real', 'complaints', 'come', 'creatures', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'fully', 'computer', 'generated', 'monsters', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'look', 'something', 'video', 'game', 'think', 'cop', 'use', 'Animatronic', 'creatures', 'computer', 'enhancements', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'would', 'least', 'look', 'something', 'was', 'actually', 'there', 'actors', 'yet', 'fluid', 'moving', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'totally', 'fake.The', 'big', 'controversy', 'Mist', 'ending', 'one', 'will', 'shut', 'up', 'about', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'either', 'biggest', 'difference', 'novella', 'movie', 'King', 'left', 'open', 'choose', 'own', 'ending', 'type', 'ending', 'story', 'Darabont', 'grim', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'type', 'ending', 'Darabont', 'ending', 'left', 'real', 'bad', 'taste', 'lot', 'people', 'mouths', 'including', 'wife', 'who', 'complained', 'rest', 'friggin', 'night', 'totally', 'ruining', 'mood', 'depriving', 'nookie', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'receiving', 'Thanks', 'Frank', 'course', 'Darabont', 'had', 'used', 'King', 'ending', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'whining', 'too', 'audience', 'closure', 'so', 'desperately', 'need', 'true', 'case', 'damned', 'do', 'damned', 'do', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Darabont', 'ending', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'people', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'love', 'flipping', 'bird', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'certainly', 'need', 'more', 'kind', 'spirit', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'have', 'lapses', 'logic', 'NOW', 'IT', 'TIME', 'THE', 'SPOILER', 'THAT', 'DOUBT', 'ALREADY', 'KNOW', 'suicide', 'pact', 'formed', 'carried', 'out', 'way', 'too', 'abruptly', 'Sure', 'situation', 'seemed', 'hopeless', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'hopeless', 'think', ""'d"", 'hold', 'off', 'life', 'changing', 'decision', 'absolutely', 'down', 'wire', 'especially', 'friggin', 'son', 'concerned', 'Oh', 'well', 'film', 'had', 'already', 'been', '2', 'hours', 'point', 'guess', 'Darabont', 'just', 'wanted', 'cut', 'chase', 'do', 'suicide', 'what', 'came', 'afterwards', 'final', 'slap', 'audience', 'face', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'abrupt', 'be', 'remotely', 'realistic.Stephen', 'King', 'writes', 'notes', 'Skeleton', 'Crew', 'Mist', 'were', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'black', 'white', 'shown', 'drive-in', 'screen', 'What', 'wonderful', 'thought', 'what', 'wonderful', 'dream', 'Unfortunately', 'day', 'age', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'way', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'today', 'state', 'horror', 'films', 'Mist', 'one', 'best', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Darabont', 'made', 'great', 'King', 'story', 'probably', 'best', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made']",N/A

During a recent trip to my local movie store, they were getting rid of all their current back stock of DVD's and I was able to purchase this gem for $2.50. My wife is the horror fanatic and also the one who put it in. I was sitting in the kitchen, working on my novel, when I started to crane my neck over the counter to watch what was going on. Andre Braugher is one of my favourite actors of all time and he unfortunately is in too little offerings these days.I complained when it started, saying: ""here we go again, another Stephen King adaptation full of no-name / B-list actors in a made for TV drama. Lemme guess, some toxic sludge escapes during a power outage and acts like a growth compound on the surrounding wildlife?""How wrong I was, and how quickly I got sucked in.I'm not going to include any spoilers in this, as this is a film that folks that love the genre, love Stephen King -- must see and continue to watch to the bitter end. While some may bemoan the ending, you have to come to terms with the difference between a bad ending and an incredibly disturbing one. This film has an incredibly disturbing ending and bothered me well into the next day - not a bad ending. I wouldn't want to be cast into that scenario for all the gold in the world. The Mist is an excellent film* (note I said film and not movie) that I would've paid to see in the theatre and would've purchased on DVD for full price. It's too bad that they didn't market this film better as the Studios are doing much more for Sci-Fi / Horror these days than they used to.The special effects are also a bonus and not gratuitous, over the top or unnecessary. Frank Darabont has really made a very well-crafted film and worthy of some kind of mention.UPDATE: Just for the sake of things, I watched this movie a second time. Knowing full well what was coming, and having prepared myself mentally, I have to say that it *does* hold up after multiple viewings and actually took an even darker turns in my mind as I realized what I was about to witness again as the film progressed.

That makes him a marketing genius more than a literary one and a very rich man.  Then, let's say that a decent filmmaker like Frank Darabont gets ahold of the project and decides to try to one-up the master.  He keeps the essence of the original story -- itself a pastiche -- and tries to give the story more gravitas than it deserves.  The result would be ""The Mist,"" a movie most known for its ""courageous"" ending.  There's nothing courageous about it, both because it's probably the cheapest ending possible to wring horror out of the audience and because it's a re-working of the ending to ""Five Came Back,"" itself remade several times.  What is ""Five Came Back,"" you say?  It's the story of survivors of a plane crash in the Andes who are being stalked by cannibals and the lengths one of them must go to in the end to ensure the survival of the others.  There's skullduggery, tragedy, redemption, sacrifice, and even an old couple at the end that finds themselves in an untenable situation.  Oh, and a revolver with too few bullets.  Just like ""The Mist.""  But the ending of that film made a bigger point about the humanity of the characters and the irony of their situation.  The ending to ""The Mist,"" however, just seems nihilistic for the sake of being so, for effect.  Thomas Jane, a sturdy actor constantly being given the slip by stardom, gets stuck in a grocery store right around the time of a trans-dimensional rift that welcomes to earth all manner of freaky bugs whose job it is to kill everyone, preferably in as gory and painfully a way as possible.  If you're looking for more story than that, you won't find it, unless you count the better subplot involving a malevolent born-again Christian (Marcia Gay Harden) who is all of those holier-than-thou hypocrites you've known in your life rolled up into one murderously fanatical nutbag.  She may be over-the-top, but at least she is interesting.  A good cast -- Andre Braugher, William Sadler, Frances Sternhagen, among others -- is largely underused in this ensemble slaughterhouse, and my hopes that the only character playing against type (brought wonderfully to life by Toby Jones) would not suffer a predictable fate were, of course, dashed.  For what it is, ""The Mist"" is competent, but that's about all it succeeds in being.  The ""courageous"" ending gets tacked on to try to elevate it to heights it cannot achieve nor deserves to.  As the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.  The greatest horror may be when you're forced to watch it again, as I was.  Drinking might help, but my advice is to skip this movie and watch ""Five Came Back"" instead.  There aren't as many bugs, but there is a lot more humanity.",3,Glossy Schlock,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,2906,"['Okay', 'let', 'assume', 'sake', 'argument', 'Stephen', 'King', 'made', 'career', 'recycling', 'better', 'projects', 'one', 'audiences', 'let', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'source', 'marketing', 'genius', 'more', 'literary', 'one', 'very', 'rich', 'man', 'Then', 'let', 'say', 'decent', 'filmmaker', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'ahold', 'project', 'decides', 'try', 'one-up', 'master', 'essence', 'original', 'story', 'pastiche', 'tries', 'give', 'story', 'more', 'gravitas', 'result', 'would', 'be', 'Mist', 'movie', 'most', 'known', 'courageous', 'ending', 'nothing', 'courageous', 'probably', 'cheapest', 'ending', 'possible', 'wring', 'horror', 'audience', 're-working', 'ending', 'Five', 'Came', 'Back', 'remade', 'several', 'times', 'What', 'Five', 'Came', 'Back', 'say', 'story', 'survivors', 'plane', 'crash', 'Andes', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'stalked', 'cannibals', 'lengths', 'one', 'must', 'go', 'end', 'ensure', 'survival', 'others', 'skullduggery', 'tragedy', 'redemption', 'sacrifice', 'even', 'old', 'couple', 'end', 'untenable', 'situation', 'Oh', 'revolver', 'too', 'few', 'bullets', 'Just', 'Mist', 'ending', 'film', 'made', 'bigger', 'point', 'humanity', 'characters', 'irony', 'situation', 'ending', 'Mist', 'however', 'just', 'nihilistic', 'sake', 'being', 'so', 'effect', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'sturdy', 'actor', 'constantly', 'being', 'given', 'slip', 'stardom', 'stuck', 'grocery', 'store', 'right', 'time', 'trans-dimensional', 'rift', 'earth', 'manner', 'freaky', 'bugs', 'job', 'kill', 'everyone', 'preferably', 'gory', 'painfully', 'way', 'possible', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'count', 'better', 'subplot', 'involving', 'malevolent', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'who', 'holier-than-thou', 'hypocrites', ""'ve"", 'known', 'life', 'rolled', 'up', 'one', 'murderously', 'fanatical', 'nutbag', 'may', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'least', 'interesting', 'good', 'cast', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'William', 'Sadler', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'others', 'largely', 'underused', 'ensemble', 'slaughterhouse', 'hopes', 'only', 'character', 'playing', 'type', 'brought', 'wonderfully', 'life', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'would', 'not', 'suffer', 'predictable', 'fate', 'were', 'course', 'dashed', 'what', 'Mist', 'competent', 'being', 'courageous', 'ending', 'tacked', 'try', 'elevate', 'heights', 'can', 'not', 'achieve', 'deserves', 'saying', 'can', 'put', 'lipstick', 'pig', 'still', 'pig', 'greatest', 'horror', 'may', 'be', 'when', ""'re"", 'forced', 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'Drinking', 'might', 'help', 'advice', 'skip', 'movie', 'watch', 'Five', 'Came', 'Back', 'instead', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'bugs', 'lot', 'more', 'humanity']",N/A

Those who've read the story will know when this moment comes.I couldn't decide if the subsequent events of the tacked-on ending were meant to be Biblical (essential to the story dramatic tension), ""O.Henry""-style twists or just a reluctance on the filmmaker's part to trust the original ending.  It dragged on so long, I became fearful that it was going to be an ""It was all a bad dream"" cop-out ending.

1126950,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B0010X73ZG,Steven Aldersley,"[11, 13]","The MistDirected by Frank DarabontStarring Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Andre Braugher, Laurie Holden, Toby JonesWeinstein Company | 2007 | 126 min | Rated R | Sep 16, 2008Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 1.85:1Audio:English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1English: Dolby Digital 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English SDH, SpanishDiscs:50GB Blu-ray DiscTwo-disc set (2 BDs)Region freeFrank Darabont hasn't directed many movies, but three of them are in my collection. The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are both adapted from Stephen King stories and so is The Mist. Despite its lower budget, The Mist is another strong entry from Darabont.The thing I like about Stephen King is that most story elements are based in the real world. We can identify with the type of town and the characters who inhabit it. He usually changes one or two things to transport us into another world. In this instance, the other element is the mist. We learn that it has leaked through from an entrance to another dimension, along with some of the creatures from that reality.The exposition is handled well and draws the viewer into the situation. After a brief description of David Drayton's (Jane) home life, he travels into town with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and neighbor Brent Norton (Braugher). While the three are shopping in the local supermarket, a man runs in with blood on his face warning that there's something in the mist.Some of my favorite stories examine what happens when society breaks down. Stephen King seems to enjoy writing about it too. The Stand is one of the best novels dealing with the psychological effects of a catastrophe and The Mist delves into the same territory. Imagine the situation. You're in a store and a mist descends outside. A man runs in injured and shouts a warning. Do you listen, or do you ignore the warning and assume it's a natural phenomenon?Some people are deeply rooted in routines. They know how much they earn and live one or two paychecks away from disaster. Their routine means that they rarely have to think about anything out of the ordinary. They may excel in one or two known situations, but be completely out of their depth when facing the unknown. That's when we see who the real leaders are. Who will crumble and who will adapt and remain calm under pressure? Will anyone lose touch with reality completely and start behaving in unpredictable ways? Would you steal to feed your family or kill to protect someone? The Mist shows what happens in just such a situation. The results are interesting to say the least.My favorite character is Ollie (Jones), the assistant manager of the store. He's a great reminder of how people are not always what they seem. Looking like an older version of Radar O'Reilly, he's able to step up and make a difference in a crisis.Darabont doesn't spend a fortune on special effects, but the result is convincing to me. As the story unfolds, we see a variety of creatures. Some of them are close to creatures we know while others are like nothing we have ever seen.Another interesting choice from Darabont is the use of sound in the movie. Most entries in this genre would feature music heavily during every action scene. Darabont chooses to just show the events as they happen without trying to influence our mood with music. There are a few muted sound effects for most of the movie, but nothing more. The result is that we are drawn into the situation even more as if we are left alone to think about how we would handle the situation. The one exception is in the last few minutes of the story when The Host of Seraphim (Dead Can Dance) is played during a pivotal scene. Its impact is greatly enhanced due to the absence of music in the remainder of the movie.Darabont changes King's original ending. It's a brave choice and will annoy a lot of people. King remarked that he wishes he had thought of it. It's a resolution of sorts and it's certainly not typical Hollywood fare.Video Quality 4/5The Mist Blu-ray package consists of two discs; one showing the movie in color and the other in black and white. Darabont is known to prefer the black and white version as it adds to the intended feel. While I like both, I slightly prefer the color version. Detail is good in both and there's nothing to complain about. It's not up there with the best the format has to offer, but it's more than adequate.Audio Quality 4/5The movie is driven by dialogue and is as much a character study as a monster movie. With no music for the vast majority of the running time, this is not the type of movie to show off your sound system. It handles everything it's supposed to without going over the top.Special Features 4/5The commentary track goes into considerable depth and is an excellent addition for those who want to know how everything was done. There are also 15 minutes of deleted scenes, a ""making of"" feature and a discussion with King and Darabont. There are several other features focusing on certain scenes or special effects. Overall, over two hours, and a good supplemental package that's worth seeing at least once.The Mist is a fun world to visit for two hours. See it if you are a fan of horror or psychological drama and enjoy a decent Blu-ray presentation.Overall 4.5/5",5,Frank Darabont adapting Stephen King is always a must-see,1304035200,"04 29,

1126951,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B0010X73ZG,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[67, 81]","Director Frank Darabont successfully adapts yet another King tale.  He had done a great job with King's prison talesThe Shawshank RedemptionandThe Green Mile, but is equally good at working on King's thrillers.***This may contain some spoilers.  I think I'm vague enough, but some like to be warned of any potential spoilers within a review.  So, here's your warning***This film is based on a novella, a short novel that is usually less than 150 pages, which helps to keep this film tightly focused on a small band of people trapped in a supermarket as a strange mists surrounds an entire town.  Within this mist are incredible monsters that are very effectively produced as part CGI and part puppets.  They do look frighteningly real and not as obvious special effects.  As with any of these ""band of survivors"" kind of films there are an odd collection of characters, but I can't label them as stereotypes and that is a welcome change for this genre of film.All the actors bring a real and human quality to their characters.  Thomas Jane, ofDeep Blue Sea, King'sDreamcatcher, and husband to Patricia Arquette of NBC'sMediumfor which he had a role on two episodes, has always been something of an action actor with passing acting abilities, but here the director gets a sincere and highly emotional performance out of him.  Andre Braugher as the initially hostile out-of-towner, turned nice guy, turned angry guy, turned determine guy is performed quite well considering the complexity of the actual role.  You see the tension with him all the time, but you also see a ""nice guy"" trying to come out and get along with others who struggles with insecurities.  In addition, there is Toby Jones,The Painted VeilandInfamous, as a shift manager who is keenly insightful about people in general, but believably so.  The supermarket is rounded out with the likes of Frances Sternhagen who graces any film she's in, William Sadler who is great at playing semi-villains, and the ever reliable Jeffrey DuMunn who is no stranger to starring in King films.  Lauren Holden as a kind of a stand-in wife/son to Thomas Jane's character and his son while trapped at the supermarket and is good in her role.  She may be best known as the macho cop in the horror filmSilent Hill.I would be remiss if I didn't note the Oscar-winning actress Marcia Gay Harden's role as the sick, sadistic, Bible thumping, I'm against the world, bitter religious zealot Mrs. Carmody.  In the Stephen King world this is the Christian stereotype as it was in hisCarrienovel.  King himself admits that he has had a very negative view of Christians prior to his near fatal car accident, and often painted them with the same brush he painted Mrs. Carmody.  Even prior to his accident he was beginning to lighten up on his view of Christians and hisThe Green Mile - Six Volume Box Setis a good example to that softening of King's views.  Having said this, Harden plays this role a bit over-the-top at times, but is still convincing.  She does eventually become a caricature of sorts, but she is very compelling to watch and I give her kudos for that kind of performance.As much as the actors make this a very enjoyable film, much credit for the success of this highly effective horror film is the writing and directing by Danabont who just knows how to handle King's stories.  King often fought with his publishers when he had downer endings.  Publisher hate it when an author kills off the heroes in a story or evil appears to win, but King, to his credit, never flinched and has had numerous stories in which his main characters die and evil won.  I admire that with King and some of his most effective stories have been the ones with downer endings.  I'm not saying who dies in this story and who doesn't in this story or if the evil in the mist wins as I don't believe in spoiling someone else's enjoyment of a film, but this adaptation is very faithful to the novella and it does have a strong ending.  In fact, the ending is quite shocking, moving, harrowing, and just plain jaw-dropping.  I doubt anyone would see it coming which makes it all that much more effective.This is an outstanding horror film that is worthy of a place in your DVD collection.",5,A King-sized thriller!,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,4216,"['Director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'successfully', 'yet', 'King', 'tale', 'had', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'King', 'prison', 'talesThe', 'Shawshank', 'RedemptionandThe', 'Green', 'Mile', 'equally', 'good', 'working', 'King', 'thrillers', '***This', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'think', ""'m"", 'vague', 'enough', 'be', 'warned', 'potential', 'spoilers', 'review', 'So', 'here', 'warning***This', 'film', 'based', 'novella', 'short', 'novel', 'usually', 'less', '150', 'pages', 'keep', 'film', 'tightly', 'focused', 'small', 'band', 'people', 'trapped', 'supermarket', 'strange', 'mists', 'surrounds', 'entire', 'town', 'mist', 'are', 'incredible', 'monsters', 'are', 'very', 'effectively', 'produced', 'part', 'CGI', 'part', 'puppets', 'do', 'look', 'frighteningly', 'real', 'not', 'obvious', 'special', 'effects', 'band', 'survivors', 'kind', 'films', 'are', 'odd', 'collection', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'label', 'stereotypes', 'welcome', 'change', 'genre', 'actors', 'bring', 'real', 'human', 'quality', 'characters', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'ofDeep', 'Blue', 'Sea', ""King'sDreamcatcher"", 'husband', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', ""NBC'sMediumfor"", 'had', 'role', 'two', 'episodes', 'always', 'been', 'something', 'action', 'actor', 'passing', 'acting', 'abilities', 'here', 'director', 'sincere', 'highly', 'emotional', 'performance', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'initially', 'hostile', 'out-of-towner', 'turned', 'nice', 'guy', 'turned', 'angry', 'guy', 'turned', 'determine', 'guy', 'performed', 'quite', 'well', 'considering', 'complexity', 'actual', 'role', 'see', 'tension', 'time', 'also', 'see', 'nice', 'guy', 'trying', 'come', 'out', 'get', 'along', 'others', 'who', 'insecurities', 'addition', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Painted', 'VeilandInfamous', 'shift', 'manager', 'who', 'keenly', 'insightful', 'people', 'general', 'believably', 'so', 'supermarket', 'rounded', 'out', 'likes', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'who', 'film', 'William', 'Sadler', 'who', 'great', 'playing', 'semi-villains', 'ever', 'reliable', 'Jeffrey', 'DuMunn', 'who', 'stranger', 'starring', 'King', 'films', 'Lauren', 'Holden', 'kind', 'stand-in', 'wife/son', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'character', 'son', 'trapped', 'supermarket', 'good', 'role', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'known', 'macho', 'cop', 'horror', 'filmSilent', 'Hill.I', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'note', 'Oscar-winning', 'actress', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'role', 'sick', 'sadistic', 'Bible', 'thumping', ""'m"", 'world', 'bitter', 'religious', 'zealot', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'Stephen', 'King', 'world', 'Christian', 'stereotype', 'was', 'hisCarrienovel', 'King', 'had', 'very', 'negative', 'view', 'Christians', 'prior', 'fatal', 'car', 'accident', 'often', 'painted', 'same', 'brush', 'painted', 'Mrs.', 'Carmody', 'Even', 'prior', 'accident', 'was', 'beginning', 'lighten', 'up', 'view', 'Christians', 'hisThe', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Six', 'Volume', 'Box', 'Setis', 'good', 'example', 'softening', 'King', 'views', 'Having', 'said', 'Harden', 'role', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'still', 'convincing', 'eventually', 'become', 'caricature', 'sorts', 'very', 'compelling', 'watch', 'give', 'kudos', 'kind', 'performance.As', 'much', 'actors', 'make', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'much', 'credit', 'success', 'highly', 'effective', 'horror', 'film', 'writing', 'directing', 'Danabont', 'who', 'just', 'how', 'handle', 'King', 'stories', 'King', 'often', 'fought', 'publishers', 'when', 'had', 'downer', 'endings', 'Publisher', 'hate', 'when', 'author', 'heroes', 'story', 'evil', 'win', 'King', 'credit', 'never', 'flinched', 'had', 'numerous', 'stories', 'main', 'characters', 'die', 'evil', 'won', 'admire', 'King', 'most', 'effective', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'ones', 'downer', 'endings', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'who', 'story', 'who', ""n't"", 'story', 'evil', 'mist', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'spoiling', 'someone', 'else', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'adaptation', 'very', 'faithful', 'novella', 'have', 'strong', 'ending', 'fact', 'ending', 'quite', 'shocking', 'moving', 'harrowing', 'just', 'plain', 'jaw-dropping', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'would', 'see', 'coming', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'effective.This', 'outstanding', 'horror', 'film', 'worthy', 'place', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

Well for once, finally, that phrase truly does apply to this movie.The film starts off pretty basic with a glimpse into David Drayton's (Thomas Jane) home art studio.  Now, only the most observant horror fans will note that one of the pictures we are shown, hanging on his wall, is an exact picture of the dvd and vhs cover from the classic move ""The Thing"", starring Kurt Russell, one of my all time favorite horror films.  So, this threw me, at first.  I thought he was some kind of person involved in horror films, and was thrown off the mark in the wrong direction.Then this storm rolls in, a tree plows through Drayton's studio window, and as the family come outside the next day to survey the damage, they see an eerie mist, hanging back along the lake they live on.  He and his son go to town to buy clean-up supplies, and, basically, the entire movie then occurs in this store, with quite a number of other shoppers, as they barricade themselves inside in fear of the mist that has surrounded the store, and evidently, the entire town and beyond.When the first encounter with the mist occurs, what is shown is, frankly, a silly looking octopus type of leg.  One of my friend's who was with me commented ""okay, this is gonna be dumb.""  I, too, was then somewhat dismayed at the sight of that leg.  Again, because of that, I was taken in yet another different direction.Then the movie takes on a totally different tone, of who believes me and who doesn't, as people take sides.  We see just how insane and crazy people act when forced into situations of entrapment, powerlessness, and plain old fashioned being scared.The actors on this film did a wonderful job, in particular the crazy Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden).  This is a very verbal film for perhaps 90 minutes straight.When a few people do finally manage to escape, what they see and encounter beyond is just thrilling, gorey, weird, and very cold feeling, in particular the scene in which they are driving along some road and see a very, very tall creature in the mist.  It just makes you realize how far-encompassing this overall thing really is.Even though the ending is very, very depressing, I said to myself, you know, for once a movie ended the way it really should have, and keeps you wondering ""why?""

The original story is quite probably one of Stephen King's best shorts, a tale that has been a long time in coming to the silver screen revolving around a cross section of small town folk, along with a couple of ""out of towners"", trapped in a supermarket when a mysterious mist rolls in after some sort of earthquake happens. And as of movies of this type tend to be, its not the mist itself that you've gotta worry about but what lurks within it.Its a great movie and truly engaging. Director Frank Darabont has a way with actors and you've gotta give this guy credit. Given, he has a stable of regulars whom he works with quite often that are all clear cut professionals but he always manages to get top notch efforts from them, whoever they may be. It's also nice to see a few faces from his ""Walking Dead"" series here but that's just my own side bit of appreciation. The actors take what is essentially a B-movie and make it into something so much more just by the way they give their all into their respective roles. Thomas Jane is one of my favorite actors and I think he does dynamite work here, bringing his usual everyman demeanor into the role of David Drayton and owning it through and through. Everybody and I do mean everybody is truly at the top of their form in this film, especially Marcia Gay Harden who plays a truly deranged ultra-Christian with her own ideas of how to handle the terrible situation these people are in. And I have to make mention of Laurie Holden's eyebrows, which turn in a stupefying performance all their own.This Blu-Ray looks and sounds great with the usual supplements in tow. I find Darabont a joy to listen to on his commentaries and there's even a small interview he has with Stephen King that's a must watch for fans. The behind the scenes feature is a bit of fluff but still worth a watch.The best part about this package is that the film is presented in black and white on a separate disc, complete with an intro as to why they even bothered to include a version such as this by Darabont. I'll let you listen to it for yourself but I have to say, watching the film in black and white is pretty much the way to watch it and adds a quality to it that brings to mind the classics of yesterday, especially George Romero's classic, ""Night of the Living Dead"". The contrast especially is high, with stark blacks and bright whites that make the film jump out of your screen in a way that color, believe it or not, just doesn't do for the film. If you do pick this disc up, make sure you watch the black and white version.

What if they had not had that ending and instead the gas runs out or they keep driving until they clear the mist and then see the army and all the people and they are saved?An ending like that would have left most sort of dangling in the ind not really sure what to make of it.....Some questioned why they 'fought so hard to survive but then gave up at the very end'....Folks, that is what made this movie a 5 star movie.

I like horror best when it is suggested on screen, I don't like gore and this movie had more than enough of it to suit my tastes.  The creatures resembled the monsters in Cloverfield (another film with little redeeming value), and seemed a bit on the fake side to me.  The trapped towns people were so stupid and arrogant that there were a few I would have loved to feed to the monsters myself.  There were a lot of tired horror cliche's in this film, I don't think it had much new to offer.What I disliked the most about the film was the disturbing twist ending.  At heart I want the good guys to win out in the end, and evil to be defeated.  It was obvious that King was going for shock value, but I would have perferred a happier outcome.

The Mist offers up some of the most disturbing situations seen in a horror film since John Carpenter's The Thing (there's a blatant homage to that film in the opening scene). The acting is good for the most part but some of the dialogue seems forced and belongs in book form only. The sense of doom is great as are most of the visual effects. For some reason, the lead actor (Thomas Jane) makes a completely insane decision (to shock and offend the audience?) in the last 10 minutes of the film and it almost ruined the entire experience for me. -----SPOILER---- Any parent who loves their child as much as Jane's character did would NEVER in a million years murder his child to ""spare him from a violent death by the creatures"". As long as there is life, there is hope. So running out of gas on an abandoned road is no excuse to shoot your little boy in the head. Stupid decision by the filmmakers and it will no doubt enrage a lot of viewers. As a parent, I found this baffling and cheap. I would rather have had a pull-back shot of the earth showing the Mist covering the entire planet and a fade to black. -----END SPOILER---- There is almost no music in the film and that really adds to the realism.

1126973,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B0010X73ZG,trashcanman,"[10, 17]","""The Mist"" is the latest Stephen King adaptation to hit the big screen and I have to say it is one of the better recent attempts. The monsters are cool, particularly the ones you never really get to see (more on that later), and the characters make up your usual bunch of hateful idiots, hapless victims, and relatable protagonists. And then there's the ever-popular religious zealot; every town has at least one, but what happens when all hell breaks loose and people start believing them? Now THAT is scarier than any monster! The story is classic King through-and-through with splashes of George Romero (Night of the Living Deadand the like) and an awful ending that will baffle you in it's sudden abandonment of any and all logic in an attempt to be dark and ironic. There's much good, but there's some major bad in there that soured the brew for me.As the mysterious mist rolls over the small town and shoppers are trapped in the store, the tension builds exceptionally well. As usual, it doesn't take long for the masses to begin to fragment into opposing factions: the obnoxiously intellectual pig-headed sorts who refuse to admit that anything is wrong, the rednecks (gotta have the rednecks!), the aforementioned religious fanatics assuring us that the End of Days has come, and the sensible folk who keep their heads about them and take it as it comes.  Not so many of them it turns out. There is a satisfying amount of mystery about what exactly is in the mist and that tension works well, but once night falls and the beasties arrive in force, it's mostly gung-ho from there. The monsters themselves are creepy and otherworldy enough, but -like I said before- the ones that really worked for me are the ones you never get a clear shot of. It's been said over and over again that less is more, but with the advent of CG, filmmakers tend to forget that.Like Romero's classics, this isn't really a film about man versus monsters; it's about man versus man. No matter the situation, humans will always be petty, selfish, and ultimately violent creatures in need of control. LikeLord of the Fliesand many others before and since, ""The Mist"" assures us that civility will only last so long we are surrounded by civilization. As one character infers: turn off the lights, take away life's little necessities, put some people in an enclosed space, then scare them and you've got a recipe for violent insanity. It's been said through film over and over, but that message always rises above the happy-ending, everybody sticks together, sugar-coated garbage that is so often rammed down our throats by Hollywood. This is probably the film's best quality once the mysteries are exposed.""The Mist"" is a good film that settles in as a solid Stephen King adaptation that is diminished by a few bad decisions. The worst decision of all is the changing of the original ending which was left open to audience interpretation in the novella. That's what brings this otherwise solid fright flick down more than anything: a lazy, poorly thought out ""eff you"" to the audience that is supposed to bring closure, but only manages to abandon all logic and make the entire film seem less good than it is. Why, oh why do so many horror films stumble in the final act trying to be cute with the ending, especially when a workable finale reminiscent of ""The Thing"" was present in the source material?

It is a reflection of the film's negativity, not a negative opinion about the film, which is IMO actually very well done as a horror film. I like and admire the work, and have no intention of ever watching it again. But I am glad I did watch it once. Once was more than enough.I had heard about ""The Mist"" and of course that it was based on a Stephen King novella. That meant, it had to have some horrifying aspects and incredible twists. King always conjures up a good scare and the unexpected. I do not know how true this film is to the book, but as a monster flick, it's right up there and then some. The movie, ""The Mist"" delivers King type elements, in spades, along with a serious social commentary and morality tale of a very dark nature.Please consider taking the title of this review to heart -- this film is deep on many levels (sometimes hard to believe because much of the human actions are irrational) and will leave some viewers feeling, well, rather disturbed. If that is your cup of tea, you'll love it. If disturbing films aren't to your liking, you may not enjoy it.In fact, as much as I admire the film (it is extremely well made), I have absolutely no desire to see it again, any more than I have a desire to whack my thumb with a hammer. Because that is basically what ""The Mist"" is, a mental whack with a hammer, over and over again! Curiosity (which got me to watch the film) can sometimes be a very unfortunate thing!The story is a mix of very weak sci-fi and mostly horror.Many reviewers liken it to 50's monster flicks, but nothing in the 50's was as disturbing as this film is. In fact, this film does what the 50's films were trying to do - it scares the daylights out of the viewer on many levels. But in the 50's films, we knew the monsters weren't real nor could they possibly be. In this film, we're not so sure about that! And none of the films of the 50's were able to deliver a sense of loss and hopelessness the way this movie does. It's a total downer!But the 50's were a different time and had a different audience. In the 50's monster flicks, the army, or scientists or the government comes to the rescue, the monsters are defeated (after causing a great deal of destruction of course) and we are left with a sense of hope and of a ""lesson learned"" (i.e. don't do nuclear experiments on lizards).We are much more cynical in the 21st Century and have more of a sense of hopelessness. Look at all the ""end of the world"" movies and their disturbing popularity. Look at the ""science"" shows on cable TV that attempt to prove the prophecies of global destruction by religious and psychics alike. This would never fly in the 50's. Not that the 50's were a great time, but there was a sense of hope that is no longer in vogue.And so ""The Mist"" is true to its time. It is utterly hopeless, which is what makes it so compelling and disturbing - if you like that sort of thing.I say the sci-fi is weak because it is only used as an excuse for how the mist in ""The Mist"" came about. Basically, it's a one liner used to explain the mist and set up a chance for the human monsters to be, well, monstrous in the way history has shown us to be over and over again. Think of the hysteria of the Salem Witch Trials, the Inquisition (which went on for over 100 years) and the current wave of terrorism around the world, the riots incensed by zealots. We aren't a nice bunch. This film capitalizes on the worst in human nature. So does the news. So which is scarier?They really didn't have to explain anything about how the mist got to be there (as the movie, ""Cloverfield"" offered no explanations for its monster). It might have been even more disturbing if they hadn't.What IS disturbing is the monsters. They are many, and they are relentless - inside and out. To explain that, I have to give away some of the premise.***** Spoiler Alert *****A seemingly natural disaster affects a small town (probably in New England - this is based on a King story) starting with a strange and violent electrical storm, followed by the appearance of a creeping mist coming towards the small nameless town. Because of the storm, many of the townspeople have done what we all do in natural emergencies. They run to the stores to stock up on supplies.When in doubt, Buy Stuff!But this time, the mist catches a group of people off guard and traps them in a supermarket. The group is widely diverse and at first glance seem like ordinary folk, although there is a sense of tension in that many of the locals do not get along. This group of ""survivors"" (if you can call them that) have to deal with the onslaught of other-worldly monsters that are the denizens of the mysterious mist. How they do it is the crux of the film.You see, it's not just the monsters IN the mist, it's the monsters hiding FROM the mist that are equally terrifying, or perhaps disturbingly disappointing. We like to think that human beings are capable of doing better. In this film, most of the humans are at their worst.Those monsters, the ones in the supermarket, are US, or US as portrayed in the movie seen through a cynical but ironically parallel-to-reality view.Several human characters are of course over-the-top stereotypes (i.e. the town ""hicks"", the crazy religious zealot, the cowardly soldiers), but others are disturbingly normal, who exhibit the human proclivity for following the leader, no matter how crazy that leader may be.So we see human irrationality in full play as these people try to find answers to their situation, or find someone to blame (which they do, more than once). And this irrationality is why their actions, with each other, and in attempting to fend off the monsters of the mist, are equally irrational. The movie is pointing out how irrational many of us really are and how that just makes a huge mess.To see people behaving in this manner is very disturbing because, ironically, we see it on the news every day, where some very vocal and sometimes violent people follow insane politicians, self-styled gurus of science and philosophy, religious propagandists, and media moguls who lead them by the nose into the depths of irrationality. In this aspect, the movie ""The Mist"" is NO fiction!This is probably the social commentary of the film, that people are basically sheep, that some of us show courage, some show cowardice, and it is easy to pick a scapegoat when things get tough. All of this is true, of course, but the movie hammers it home again and again, as relentlessly as the monsters in the mist attack the humans, and indeed they do!Of course the mist monsters are what people want to see. The movie makes use of the time-honored cliches and cultural monster icons (hence not terribly original, but scary all the same) that terrify us on our deepest psychological and instinctive levels.Most of the monsters are, of course, insects -- horrific creepy crawly insects, large mosquito-like flying insects, nasty beetle type insects with vicious teeth, and of course, spiders, lots and lots of spiders. They are horrifyingly larger than life but not entirely gigantic, horrifyingly voracious, and painfully slow killing insects. When people are bitten, stung or otherwise attacked by these creatures, oh yeah, it hurts! There's no shortage of blood curdling screaming in this movie, and the blood flows pretty generously as well.Of course, the bugs are not alone. We get terrified on other instinctive levels by monsters with clawed and toothy tentacles (think of giant squids and octopus, even snakes), and flying bird/gargoyle type monsters with bat wings (the old demon bat scare) who are after the insects but won't stop eating there. These creatures look disturbingly like monsters I saw in an old video game called ""Alone in the Dark"". The movie dishes these creatures up very effectively, horrifyingly, and almost relentlessly. They may be cliche, but they work. Why re-invent the wheel?The ultimate GIANT monster is seen near the end of the film and ironically, it doesn't harm anyone. It's just so terrifying to see, and it is hard to forget. BUT you'll have to wade through two hours of horror to get to it.As scary and totally unforgettable (and indescribable) as this final monster is, it's not the end of the film, though you might think so.We do get set up for the ultimate hopelessness and the ultimate choice between life and death as we hear monsters growling in the mist just out of sight. Yeah, they're probably on the move and our intrepid few survivors better do something quick and desperate. BUT, hang on to your seat, the worst is YET to come!The final horror and disturbance comes with the ending, one worthy of Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"". It is a ""I NEVER saw that coming"" ending, one that is deeply tragic and hopeless and teaches a strict moral in the most horrible way:""When things get bad, if you act in desperation, even with the best of intentions, you may regret it.""I have read that this is NOT the ending in King's book, that he offered more hope. But, this IS the 21st Century, and hopelessness is the new fashion. The movie is a product of its time.Fortunately, time moves forward, and hopefully we're better than the characters and monsters of this film, because the cavalry may arrive just a few minutes too late.-------------------------Conclusion:As a horror film, ""The Mist"" is a top-notch movie. Scary as all get out.As a sci-fi flick, well, it's like calling a calculator a computer - there just is no real sci-fi in it because there is no science of any kind in it, not a single lab coat or test tube even!It is a monster film for sure, but that does not qualify it as science fiction, just fiction and possibly fantasy. But there be monsters a-plenty!As a social commentary, it is cynical, cruel and a downer. It is brutally honest a product of the worst in 21st century thinking.Acting - Top notch, totally convincing, and amazingly annoying at times.Suspense - Amazing, cliff hanging, with the usual ""NO, don't go in there!"" feeling that marks the standard horror genre.Pacing - Not too fast, they want the horror to sink in before the next onslaught.Special Effects - ExcellentComic Relief (often found in horror films to relieve tension) - Are you kidding? None of that stuff here!If you liked the movie ""Cloverfield"", you may also like this film.If you are a Stephen King fan, you may also enjoy the film, although I can't say how closely it follows the book.If you like twists, and can stomach it through to the ending, you'll get a BIG surprise.I'll never look at fog and other weather patterns the same again.And, just for fun, take a look at you local supermarket next time it snows. It MAY look familiar if you've seen this film.",5,"Deeply Terrifying, Disturbing, Haunting, and Unforgettable",1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,10823,"['like', 'film', 'negative', 'movie', 'extreme',

1126977,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0010X73ZG,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","One night a horrible storm ravages a small Maine town. The next morning the clean up begins. Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) notices the strange mist moving across the lake and though it seems unusual, it doesn't seem to concern him much. He goes into town with his son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), and their next door neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) to pick up a few supplies from the local supermarket. Everything appears normal. Then Dave and others in the store notice police cars, firetrucks, and military vehicles driving down the main road in front of the story at high speeds. Soon sirens ring out and an older man runs into the store yelling that there is ""something in the mist."" The doors of the store are closed just as the strange mist that Dave saw earlier on the lake covers everything outside. Screams are heard, the power goes out, and the earth shakes. No one knows for sure what's exactly outside in the mist, but the few people that leave the store to check things out aren't seen from again. The store has emergency generators, but they begin acting up. Dave and a few other volunteers try to fix the generator and soon discover that there are monsters in the mist. Those in the store begin dividing into different factions. There's those like Dave, who though nervous and frightened, keep their wits about them and try to figure out the best course of action. Then there are others like Brent who decides that action needs to be taken immediately and leave the store. There are many who aren't sure what's going on. Then there's Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Wallace) an eccentric woman who proclaims that the mist has been sent by God to cleanse the Earth in preparation for the final days. Some of what Mrs. Carmody says is reasonable, but her self-righteousness minus any compassion and mercy turn her into an apocalyptic cult leader. One by one those in the store succumb to Mrs. Carmody's cult-preaching, proving that what's happening inside the store may just be far more deadly than anything out in the mist.THE MIST is an adaptation by Frank Darabont of a Stephen King short story. Darabont wrote the script, directed, and co-produced THE MIST. I really like Darabont as a director. I have a friend who once said that if Darabont only directed five or six movies in his life, it would be enough because each of his films is so well-crafted. THE MIST is Darabont's fourth film and if he continues his pace, he probably only will direct five or six films in his life. But, that's okay.THE MIST is almost a perfect adaptation of Stephen King's original story, with a few slight changes.Mrs. Carmody. It may have just been me, but it seemed like Mrs. Carmody was more than just a kooky lady with some eccentric religious beliefs who becomes caught up in a sacrificial fever. Instead, it seemed to me that Darabont was using her character to vilify anyone who has religious beliefs. For instance, there were a couple of times when she would say something that I would agree with, but I found myself shuddering because her statements were not backed by her actions.However, Mrs. Carmody's portrayal is minor compared to the one huge alteration. King's story is ambiguous and no one knows what happens to the characters but the story ends in ""hope"". I guess that ending didn't satisfy Darabont because he took King's story and extended the ending and turns the hopeful ending into one of the bleakest and darkest endings I have ever seen in a movie. Darabont still remains one of my favorite directors, but it does make me wonder if Darabont, whose previous films were ones filled with hope, compassion, and faith (THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, and THE MAJESTIC), is taking his career in a different direction.Overall, THE MIST is a monster movie filled with psychological horror and an ending so bleak it might just make you sick.

1126978,AEE52GO98PFOL,B0010X73ZG,Tyr Shadowblade (TM),"[3, 5]","As a general rule, I've liked the film adaptations of King's short stories (Silver Bullet, Maximum Overdrive) better than the adaptations of his novels (Cujo, Shining).A lot of reviewers seem to think that the controversial ending of this particular adaptation was contrary to King's vision -- but at the end of the short story the protagonist clearly states that he has several bullets left and is willing to do what he needs to do if necessary -- then it concludes with the vision of the giant creature from another dimension lumbering overhead.  The film follows this train of thought to its logical conclusion -- and, according to the commentary -- King himself approved the script, stating that he wished he'd ended the story that way instead.  Ending was powerful and brilliant . . . but then there was the surprise twist immediately thereafter which made it so much more horrible.  THAT -- those last couple of minutes -- really should've been snipped off and reserved as an ""alternate"" ending, in my opinion.  If the mist NEVER cleared it would've been much better, and the sacrifice more noble.  But no -- gotta make the hero look like a fool for transgressing a societal taboo toward the greater good.Acting was brilliant, casting was perfect, script was amazing, effects were good (but it's more what we DON'T see than what we do).  Powerful societal commentary regarding such diverse subjects as: the disolution of civilized behavior during an extended crisis, the attraction of religious zealotry during a time of helplessness, and the responsible use of firearms by private citizens (as opposed to 99% of the televised portayals of such).  The fact that such care was put into making even minor characters fully developed and likeable makes it that much jarring when bad things happen to them . . . very unlike the typical ""horror"" or ""suspense"" flick where the audience neither likes nor cares about the characters -- and in many cases is actually glad to see them gone.  These characters are like our neighbors, our co-workers, our friends . . . and to see them being subjected to this is truly scary.THE MIST is probably the most REALISTIC horror film I've ever seen (if you can overlook the whole extradimensional monster thing).

1126985,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B0010X73ZG,Wayne C. Rogers,"[2, 3]","The Mist is director Frank Darabont's shot at doing an actual horror film that's similar to those made during the 1950s.  Just think of Them, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, It Came From Beneath the Sea, and you'll have of what he was trying to do with Stephen King's most famous novella.  It should also be noted that the movie is in both color and black and white on the Two-Disc Collector's Edition.  Simply take your pick of which version you want to watch.  Let it be known up front that if you decide to watch this movie hoping to see a Frank Darabont film (The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption), you're likely to be disappointed with the product.  While The Mist is an entertaining, well-made movie for its genre, it's not going to be nominated for any Academy Awards.For those of you who haven't read the novella or seen the movie, the story deals with a large group of people who find themselves trapped inside a local grocery store when a heavy mist drifts in from the surrounding woodlands, enveloping the entire Maine town and bringing with it an array of dangerous and hungry creatures in search of some subsistence.  It's not important how the mist came to be, though the film points to a military experiment gone wrong with the creatures entering our world from another dimension.  What's really unusual about this story isn't so much the danger that awaiting patiently outside the grocery store, but rather the danger that's inside the place.  As the tale progresses and the fear for their lives intensifies, the trapped people quickly split into two distinct camps with one being led by a religious zealot and the other by a sensible everyday man who simply wants to get himself and his young son back to safety.  The underlying current here is how swiftly the thin veneer of civilization can slip away when human beings are trapped and filled with an increasing fear for their lives with nowhere to turn.  The rest of the story deals with what happens inside the store, especially when some the jaw-smacking creatures breach the defenses that have been placed to keep them out.  The good citizens of the store prove to be infinitely more frightening than the strange things outside in the mist.I have to be honest and say that I was disappointed in the film when I first saw it in the theater.  I certainly didn't like the ending and the lack of hope it represented to me.  When the DVD set came out, I purchased it for my film library and decided to watch the movie a second time.  This proved to be a good thing because I found myself enjoying the film a lot more the second time around and could see how well made it actually was.  I still had problems with the finale because it was like everyone you cared about gave up at the end, not wanting to be food for the creatures hidden within the mist.  The ending to Stephen King's novella was completely different, but he's publicly stated that if he'd come up with Darabont's ending when originally writing the story, he'd gone with it.  Certainly the ending has provoked a great deal of controversy with the fans.  I think it's also strange that I liked the more realistic ending of the Director's Cut of 1408, but didn't enjoy it here.  Still, the movie's very entertaining with a number of scenes that will have you jumping in your seat.  It's fast pace with extremely good acting by Thomas Jane, Academy Award Winner Marcia Gay Harden, Toby Jones (who played Truman Capote the year before), Laurie Holden, the always fabulous Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, and Hollywoodland), and Andre Braugher (who was in the remake of Salem's Lot for television).As I wrote earlier, the Two-Disc Collector's Edition has the movie in both color and black and white formats.  There's a commentary by Frank Darabont, which is always fun to listen to, and a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie and the creation of many of its special effects.  This is definitely a movie that all horror buffs should have in their film library.

1126986,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0010X73ZG,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 6]","THE MIST is directed by Frank Darabont; after his somewhat misfire ""The Majestic"", he is poised to redeem himself with an adaptation of one of Stephen King's novellas. Darabont wrote the screenplay and directed this horror film that left a smile on my face after watching it in theaters. This film is a welcome return to contemporary horror film-making after Eli Roth's tiresome torture flicks and Asian long-haired ghosts.After an electrical storm hits a small town in Maine, a resident named David Drayton (Thomas Jane) with his son and ""not in too much good terms"" neighbor (Andre Braugher) goes to town to pick up some food and supplies. In no time at all, the area is engulfed with a mysterious mist with almost no visibility and brings nail-biting terror to all the people in the grocery store. Trapped inside, some people (with Toby Jones and Laurie Holden) look for a way to survive, while some led by a religious fanatic (Marcia Gay Hayden) look at the mist as a sign from God and a harbinger of end times.The direction by Darabont is excellent. He successfully managed to bring out all the expected emotions when scared folks of different character with different beliefs come together in one enclosed space. The result is a nail biting, unsettling tale of suspense that is the result for survival and blind human panic. The ingenuity of ""The Mist"" is that it effectively avoids the usual clich&eacute;s to generate sympathy. The film relies on the emotional reaction of its characters; while it is a straightforward tale of man versus the unknown, he uses character interaction as a means to express raw fear and panic. This is a very effective approach as it preserves the film's premise as a claustrophobic situation and helped me realize the potential panic in this situation.The Mist relies on its effective script to immerse the viewer in the hopelessness of the situation. Sure, it is not perfect. The occasionally snappy banter in the beginning of the film may turn off some viewers but I believe it helps the proceedings connect with the audience and give a subtle background of the town folk. Blood and gore inherent in the film but I think it was used sparingly and the timing/situation is perfect for such things; it never felt as a cheap way to generate routine scares. The screenplay relies more on cerebral suspense than depending on the computer-generated blood and effects.I think the reason why ""The Mist"" is so effective is because the terror comes in two fronts of the battlefield. Mob panic and hysteria is promoted by a stupid religious zealot; Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Hayden) who is made as the unbalanced villain. She fashions herself as the light and the messenger of God's word. She portrays God as a vengeful deity who is bent on ""hellfire and brimstone"" for all unbelievers. She feeds on a person's desire to be comforted and to belong in a very desperate situation. The second source of horror is the rampage of the creatures that consists of spider-like and locusts-like creatures with almost ""human"" features threaten the lives of the people in the store. There are also a few giant-like monsters in the film but I think at this point, the less you know the better. I have to say that the threat of the creatures seemed a bit minor at the time compared to the threat of scared people who is willing to do anything to feed their misconceptions.Aside from the direction and the excellent script, the film's key to its success is the top-notched effects and creature designs. Although the creature designs may not be wholly original, they do look inspired and fit the film's representation of the unknown. The performance of the cast is also worth mentioning. The performers successfully portray their characters with convincing fervor; I couldn't help but become immersed in the proceedings. Frank Darabont seemed to have found the right actors for the right job.The Mist may have strayed from the original ending as Stephen King's novel but I rather thought it made the film even darker and unpredictable. The twist in the final act closes the film with a large exclamation point. THE MIST is an effective blend of intense human drama and raw terror that is very effective. It managed to sidestep the usual heroics and replaces it with a beautiful bleak attitude bereft in ultimate irony. The film has a very honest but disturbing vision of human horror.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

1126987,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0010X73ZG,Wuchak,"[1, 2]","2007's ""The Mist"" is director Frank Darabont's third stab at a Stephen King story, after ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile.""THE STORY: A strange mist falls upon a Maine village wherein numerous townspeople hold up in a supermarket. Within the mist lurks strange insect-like creatures, big and small. Two groups slowly develop within the market: 1.) The sane group who just want to work together and survive and 2.) The increasingly-lunatic apocalypse mongers.Let me first address what doesn't work, and then we'll look at the film's many positives:WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The initial set-up of the story is fine until about the 35-minute mark when I started rolling my eyes at the character stereotypes and their unbelievable actions. For instance, Andre Braugher, who plays Thomas Jane's black neighbor, insists that Jane and a handful of others are cruelly joking with him about a tentacled creature that killed a grocery boy. The man is ridiculously paranoid of imagined slights and it's just not believable.Then there's the cliched self-righteous, hate-mongering, doomsday-obsessed ""Christian"" played by Marcia Gay Harden. I'm not saying people like this wacko don't exist (after all, Jesus plainly stated ""There will be false prophets; you'll recognize them by their fruits""), it's just that she doesn't come off believable. She also lacks the charismatic flair necessary to convert half of the people to her lunatic fringe.These are just two examples; there are more cartooney stereotypes that tempted me to tune out, the worst being when the wacko group attempts to sacrifice a guy for their deliverance. The word that kept coming to my mind was ""Dumb."" But I accepted this dumbness and persevered on the grounds that the people in the store are obviously a microcosm of American society, a melting pot of different beliefs and cultures. Hence, most of the people are TYPES rather than realistic individuals.Another negative is that a full 90-minutes of the 2-hour runtime takes place IN the supermarket (or adjoining pharmacy), which gives the film a confined vibe. Alhough this didn't bother me much it could wear out its welcome for some people. The good news is that the ending is truly worth the wait.WHAT WORKS: I was wondering what explanation would be given for the mist and the creatures. I figured the revelation would be another roll-your-eyes moment but they came up with a plausible explanation.Some have criticized that all the characters are unlikable, but this isn't true at all. For instance, Thomas Jane is a great protagonist. All hell's literally breaking loose but he keeps his head at all times. The only other film I've seen him in is ""The Punisher."" He's just a great ultra-masculine leading man in the manner of Eastwood, Heston, Reynolds, Stallone, Bronson, Brando, etc.There are numerous other likable characters like the beautiful Laurie Holden who plays the schoolteacher Amanda. She becomes Jane's companion-in-place-of-his-wife and substitute mother to his son. Amanda is truly spiritual, full of love, mercy and compassion. She's the antithesis of the Pharisaical Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). For instance, Carmody goes on and on with her religious blather and Amanda simply responds, ""You're too Old Testament.""Amanda wouldn't say this unless she was familiar with the differences between the Old and New Testaments. This would indicate that she's likely a Christian of some sort, which is substantiated by her truly loving spirit (not that non-Christians can't be loving, so don't get me wrong; just that agape love is the core fruit of the Christian faith, which is why Jesus taught that false prophets can be plainly recognized by their lack of this fruit ~ Matthew 7:15-23. Agape love is one-and-the-same as the ""fruit of the spirit"" detailed in Galations 5). Why do I point this out? Because it's tempting for Christians to write off ""The Mist"" due to the character of Mrs. Carmody, who doesn't paint Christianity in a very positive light, to say the least.But, again, Jesus said there would be people like this, and there ARE. They're counterfeits. Notice during Mrs. Carmody's solo prayer in the bathroom where she essentially boasts of herself to God, a definite Pharisaical trait. Amanda then enters the restroom, full of love and understanding. Carmody responds with venomous, horribly insulting words, a clear indication that she's not truly what she claims to be.I'm a Christian and am therefore in contact with believers all the time and I can honestly tell you that the majority of Christians don't even remotely resemble Mrs. Carmody. Most Christians in my social circles sincerely walk in love and try to serve God even while they're flawed human beings who have weaknesses and make mistakes. And, yet, there are some hateful legalistic zealots like Mrs. Carmody. One woman I know insists on being addressed as ""Apostle Harris"" at all times, even though she's not an apostle in the remotest sense. She's got to be one of the most joyless, unkind, hostile people I've ever met (she once ""rebuked"" me for not praying over a cupcake!!!), yet she masquerades as a supposed Christian leader. Nothing could be further from the truth. She's false, pure and simple.As noted above, the story starts to feel overly confined due to the one-dimensional setting, but the climax is truly worth the wait [NO SPOILERS]. At about the 1 hour and 45 minute mark the film takes on a truly mysterious and awe-inspiring vibe as a handful of people escape into the forboding mist. The score at this point becomes equal parts ominous, beautiful and otherworldly.The potent ending is controversial. Some hate it but it makes a powerful point: Never give up hope because you never know how close you are to the dawn.FINAL ANALYSIS: I highly recommend seeing ""The Mist."" Even though it recalls other mystery/horror films like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and ""Aliens,"" not to mention ""The Fog"" and ""Messiah of Evil,"" it possesses its own uniqueness. Yes, some of the characters and characterizations are cartooney and contrived, but -- again -- the characters are meant to be a microcosm of multicultural society. Besides the ending is incredible (even if you oppose one certain aspect) and the story truly is thought-provoking. It successfully provokes the viewer to ponder long afterwards. My wife and I had a nice long discussion on the various social/religious issues and other points. This is a sign of a very worthwhile picture despite its obvious dumb elements.GRADE: Borderline B+ or A-",4,"Good monsters, great ending, cartooney social commentary, truly

1126988,AP3B615GM191G,B0010X73ZG,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","At its core, ""The Mist"" (based on the Stephen King novella) is a classic ""humans trying to survive against monsters"" tale.  However, thanks to King's brilliant storytelling, a human element is introduced into the mix that takes the film to new psychological heights.For a basic plot summary, ""The Mist"" tells the tale of a small American town suddenly attacked by a variety of bug-like creatures.  After a terrible windstorm causes the town's residents to gather in the general store for supplies, they all find themselves trapped in the rather confined space as a curtain of mist blankets the entire city.  Whenever someone ventures out into the mist, however, they do not return alive.There are two reasons why this film is so interesting/entertaining:First, the special effects and alien creatures will have you on the edge of your seat.  One almost has to wonder if they did not inspire JJ Abrams' creature in the later ""Cloverfield"" picture, as the films are very similar in that regard.What truly sets the film apart, though, is that it is as much about humanity as it is about monsters.  As the bewildered townspeople struggle to determine their next move, all their personalities begin showing in crisis mode.  There is the religious zealot, the rednecks ready to fight at the drop of the hat, the natural leaders, and the ""lemmings"" willing to follow the loudest voice in a mob-like mentality.  In typical King fashion, it is a tale of humanity's struggles more than the paranormal aspect.Overall, then, ""The Mist"" is a great ""monster flick"" also including large doses of human drama.  It was a great Stephen King story, and the transfer to the big screen is almost impeccable.  Unless you are a bit squeamish, you will find this interesting on both the ""horror"" & ""psychological"" levels.",4,Monsters vs. Human Nature: Which Is Worse?,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1797,"['core', 'Mist', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'classic', 'humans', 'trying', 'survive', 'monsters', 'tale', 'However', 'thanks', 'King', 'brilliant', 'storytelling', 'human', 'element', 'introduced', 'mix', 'film', 'new', 'psychological', 'heights.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Mist', 'tale', 'small', 'American', 'town', 'suddenly', 'attacked', 'variety', 'bug-like', 'creatures', 'terrible', 'windstorm', 'town', 'residents', 'gather', 'general', 'store', 'supplies', 'find', 'trapped', 'rather', 'confined', 'space', 'curtain', 'mist', 'blankets', 'entire', 'city', 'Whenever', 'someone', 'ventures', 'out', 'mist', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'return', 'alive.There', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'interesting/entertaining', 'First', 'special', 'effects', 'alien', 'creatures', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'One', 'almost', 'wonder', 'did', 'not', 'inspire', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'creature', 'later', 'Cloverfield', 'picture', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'regard.What', 'truly', 'film', 'apart', 'as', 'much', 'humanity', 'monsters', 'bewildered', 'townspeople', 'struggle', 'determine', 'next', 'move', 'personalities', 'begin', 'showing', 'crisis', 'mode', 'religious', 'zealot', 'rednecks', 'ready', 'fight', 'drop', 'hat', 'natural', 'leaders', 'lemmings', 'willing', 'follow', 'loudest', 'voice', 'mob-like', 'mentality', 'typical', 'King', 'fashion', 'tale', 'humanity', 'struggles', 'more', 'paranormal', 'aspect.Overall', 'then', 'Mist', 'great', 'monster', 'flick', 'also', 'including', 'large', 'doses', 'human', 'drama', 'was', 'great', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'transfer', 'big', 'screen', 'almost', 'impeccable', 'are', 'bit', 'squeamish', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'horror', 'psychological', 'levels']",N/A
1126989,A2YMFNXSPRVKEW,B0010X73ZG,Z. Fu,"[2, 2]","I usually stay away from hyperboles. But, the Mist may be the Hamlet of monsters movies. It succeeds on two levels. It is first and foremost a monster movie that is truly horrific. Darabont's realistic direction fleshed out King's story and characters, and made the Lovercraftian horrors much more tangible and immediate. Secondly, the movie is a careful study of the psychology of fear, or how fear operates in group dynamics. It shows that fear makes people do what they otherwise would not, and makes them believe in things that they otherwise would not.There is much controversy surrounding the ending. It works fine for me both dramatically and emotionally. I would also like to point out that King clearly alluded to it in his novella:""I checked the gun and then put it into the glove compartment. Ollie had reloaded it after the expedition to the drugstore. The rest of the shells had disappeared with him, but that was all right. He had fired at Mrs. Carmody, he had fired once at the clawed thing, and the gun had discharged once when it hit the ground. There were four of us in the Scout, but if push came right down to shove, I'd find some other way out for myself.""The allusion renders the movie ending much legitimacy. An enthusiastic reader can even speculate that such an ending may be what King himself would have wanted it on a deep subconscious level. We would probably never know for sure.
