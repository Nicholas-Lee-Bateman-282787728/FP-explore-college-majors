This was the directorial debut of &Aacute;lvaro de Armi&ntilde;&aacute;n, and to his credit, the director does a solid job.  He serves up good cinematography, and quality lighting.  The film was shot in Spain, which makes for a beautiful and exotic backdrop for the story.The plot obviously borrows ideas from Jumanji and Final Destination, though the execution of the concept is original.  The first death in the movie is certainly more hardcore than what the Final Destination series offers up.  My bigger complaints with the movie was that CGI effects were overused, and none of the acting performances stand out.  I was also disappointed by the manner in which the Mamba game must be concluded (with a question), as the writer ripped the idea off from the speaking doors in Labyrinth.I mostly watched this movie because of the ridiculously sexy Eliza Dushku, and coupled with the game design, it made for a decent horror movie.

1314417,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B002ZNNXD6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 7]","With ""Open Graves"" it is time for another thrilling episode of movie calculus.  For this  2009 horror flick take ""Jumanji"" and add it to ""Final Destination,"" then add a splash of your pick of the ""The Blind Dead"" movies,  subtract ""The Monkey's Paw"" (a classic short story in the horror genre that apparently nobody in this movie has ever heard of), and throw in a hint of aBill Murraymovie that will give away the punch line.  Then, for good measure, go watch your favoriteEliza Dushku horror movieor an episode from one of hertelevision series, all of which are way better than this film.  We begin with a nice little flashback to the Spanish Inquisition, when a witch was condemned to a torturous death and then had her skin and bones used to create an ornately carved board game.  The Egyptian board game Senet dates back to 3500 BC, so it is not farfetched that the Inquisition would come up with a sick and twisted board game, just that it is a sick and twisted pro-type for Monopoly, which does not pop up in the real world until 1930.  Cut from dark dungeon of the 15th century to the present day in Northern Spain on a sunny beach where surfer girl Erica (Dushku), meets up with Jason (Mike Vogel), who buys a board game called Mamba from a creepy storekeeper.  That night Erica, Jason, and his  idiot friends, all of who are obviously fated to die before our two leads are left to try and stay alive until the final credits, get drunk and play the game.  It turns out that when you play the game whoever wins gets their heart's desire, and everybody else will, well, you know....To be specific: every time you land on certain squares on the board you pick up a game card, each of which has a cryptic rhyming couplet that tells you how you are going to die.  The game ends, people start dying, and damn if they do not start dying in the way predicted by their card.  Who saw that coming?  If this is not bad enough, the world weary Detective Izar (Gary Piquer) shows up and starts asking quesitons.  Seems somebody was recently skinned alive, which we all recognize as being what happened to Mamba Masamba, the witch from the film's prelude, but of whom the detective knows nothing.  But he is interested in the game, which is not a complication Erica and Jason need in their quest to stay alive.  Basically at this point you will have a series of gruesome deaths (lots of attacks by lots of animals, involving a sort of plagues of Egypt vibe, which is in keeping with the Old Testament level of vengeance favored by the Inquisition), of varying degrees of interest and grossness, until Erica and Jason try to play out the end game.There is never a point in ""Open Graves"" (a title, by the way, that really tells you nothing about the plot or action of the movie), where you care about the survival of anybody else besides Erica; any similar feelings for Jason will be squashed well before the end.  I suppose if you do not care about all the handsome young things dying, then you can better enjoying watching them die horribly, but that pretty much defeats the whole idea of being horrified by a horror movie.  Of course, Dushku's character has a clue sooner than the rest of the menu in this movie, but it takes a while for the others to catch up, and then it is, of course, too late, so on and so forth.  This is the first director credit for &Aacute;lvaro de Armi&ntilde;&aacute;n after twenty-one films as a second unit director or assistant director and he appears to be hampered by the special effects in this low-budget film in terms of coming up with any memorable sequences after the grizzly opening ( I kept dozing off and had to dopicture-go-backto see what I had missed, which was never worth the effort).  As for the writing, the screenplay is by Roderick Taylor and Bruce A. Taylor, television writers who graduated to the big screen with ""The Brave One,"" which makes me think that this was something they had on the shelf, because this is certainly not a step forward.  My final comment would be that if you want to see Eliza Dushku, go on line and find photos of her to look at, because there is not enough of that in this movie to justify rounding up either.  At least she got a trip to Spain out of this one.",2,"This horror movie about an evil board game is, well, boring",1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,4235,"['Open', 'Graves', 'time', 'thrilling', 'episode', 'movie', 'calculus', '2009', 'horror', 'flick', 'take', 'Jumanji', 'add', 'Final', 'Destination', 'then', 'add', 'splash', 'pick', 'Blind', 'Dead', 'movies', 'subtract', 'Monkey', 'Paw', 'classic', 'short', 'story', 'horror', 'genre', 'apparently', 'nobody', 'movie', 'ever', 'heard', 'throw', 'hint', 'aBill', 'Murraymovie', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'punch', 'line', 'Then', 'good', 'measure', 'go', 'watch', 'favoriteEliza', 'Dushku', 'horror', 'movieor', 'episode', 'one', 'hertelevision', 'series', 'are', 'way', 'better', 'film', 'begin', 'nice', 'little', 'flashback', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'when', 'witch', 'was', 'condemned', 'torturous', 'death', 'then', 'had', 'skin', 'bones', 'used', 'create', 'ornately', 'carved', 'board', 'game', 'Egyptian', 'board', 'game', 'Senet', 'back', '3500', 'BC', 'not', 'farfetched', 'Inquisition', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'sick', 'twisted', 'board', 'game', 'just', 'sick', 'twisted', 'pro-type', 'Monopoly', 'not', 'pop', 'up', 'real', 'world', '1930', 'Cut', 'dark', 'dungeon', '15th', 'century', 'present', 'day', 'Northern', 'Spain', 'sunny', 'beach', 'where', 'surfer', 'girl', 'Erica', 'Dushku', 'up', 'Jason', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'who', 'board', 'game', 'called', 'Mamba', 'creepy', 'storekeeper', 'night', 'Erica', 'Jason', 'idiot', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'fated', 'die', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'left', 'try', 'stay', 'alive', 'final', 'credits', 'get', 'drunk', 'play', 'game', 'out', 'when', 'play', 'game', 'whoever', 'heart', 'desire', 'everybody', 'else', 'will', 'well', 'know', '.To', 'be', 'specific', 'time', 'land', 'certain', 'squares', 'board', 'pick', 'up', 'game', 'card', 'cryptic', 'rhyming', 'couplet', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'game', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'damn', 'do', 'not', 'start', 'dying', 'way', 'predicted', 'card', 'Who', 'saw', 'coming', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'world', 'weary', 'Detective', 'Izar', 'Gary', 'Piquer', 'up', 'asking', 'quesitons', 'Seems', 'somebody', 'was', 'recently', 'skinned', 'alive', 'recognize', 'being', 'what', 'happened', 'Mamba', 'Masamba', 'witch', 'film', 'prelude', 'whom', 'detective', 'nothing', 'interested', 'game', 'not', 'complication', 'Erica', 'Jason', 'need', 'quest', 'stay', 'alive', 'Basically', 'point', 'will', 'have', 'series', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'lots', 'attacks', 'lots', 'animals', 'involving', 'sort', 'plagues', 'Egypt', 'vibe', 'keeping', 'Old', 'Testament', 'level', 'vengeance', 'favored', 'Inquisition', 'varying', 'degrees', 'interest', 'grossness', 'Erica', 'Jason', 'try', 'play', 'out', 'end', 'game.There', 'never', 'point', 'Open', 'Graves', 'title', 'way', 'really', 'nothing', 'plot', 'action', 'movie', 'where', 'care', 'survival', 'anybody', 'else', 'Erica', 'similar', 'feelings', 'Jason', 'will', 'be', 'squashed', 'well', 'end', 'suppose', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'handsome', 'young', 'things', 'dying', 'then', 'can', 'better', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'die', 'horribly', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'idea', 'being', 'horrified', 'horror', 'movie', 'course', 'Dushku', 'character', 'clue', 'sooner', 'rest', 'menu', 'movie', 'while', 'others', 'catch', 'up', 'then', 'course', 'too', 'late', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'first', 'director', 'credit', 'Aacute', 'lvaro', 'de', 'Armi', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'twenty-one', 'films', 'second', 'unit', 'director', 'assistant', 'director', 'be', 'hampered', 'special', 'effects', 'low-budget', 'film', 'terms', 'coming', 'up', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'grizzly', 'opening', 'kept', 'dozing', 'off', 'had', 'dopicture-go-backto', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'missed', 'was', 'never', 'effort', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'Roderick', 'Taylor', 'Bruce', 'A.', 'Taylor', 'television', 'writers', 'who', 'graduated', 'big', 'screen', 'Brave', 'One', 'think', 'was', 'something', 'had', 'shelf', 'certainly', 'not', 'step', 'forward', 'My', 'final', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'want', 'see', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'go', 'line', 'find', 'photos', 'look', 'not', 'enough', 'movie', 'justify', 'rounding', 'up', 'either', 'least', 'got', 'trip', 'Spain', 'one']",N/A

Battling a gameboard named Mamba which could either be the name of a snake or sound like the name of a dance doesn't make for high class tension or scariness. If you don't beat the game, you die - and in the order that you lost in relation to others playing the game.  The two leads, Dushku and Vogel, are your nominal heroes and eye candy. But, in the end, one cannot help but come away with the feeling that you have just watched a combination of rejected versions of THE FINAL DESTINATION and THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT. The latter two at least made some sense within the framework of horror movies but this one lacked any real substance and rationale.  Indeed, the penultimate appearance of a strange winged female creature who suddenly emerges from the sea is more reminiscent of the 1950s movie THE SHE CREATURE. To add some additional confusion to the story, this new creature looks a bit like Dushku. So what is this all about? Is Dushku not really human in the first place?  And what happened to Dushku when she paddled out to sea supposedly to sacrifice herself and save her new boyfriend? Does anyone really care at this point? The final opportunity to defeat the game and restore the lost friends of the group only reveals how lacking in forethought and sound reasoning our ""hero"" really is. However, perhaps all of this was planned as a setup for OPEN GRAVES II, OPEN GRAVES III, OPEN GRAVES IV, and so forth. My final observation: Stick to MONOPOLY.

The game's board and pieces were made from the skin and body of a witch named Mamba Mosamba who was executed for witchcraft during the Spanish Inquisition. If you die in the game, you die in real life.  It's like Jack Chick's Blackleaf all over again!Unfortunately, Open Graves is torn between being a hip by-the-numbers teen horror flick reminiscent of Final Destination and being an original movie about a board game.  The collective pretty people playing the game are preposterous stereotypes. Not one of them is likable.  The worst is the beautiful but acting-impaired Eliza Dushku as Erica, who makes googly eyes at hero Jason (Mike Vogel) over the board game.  The poor girl does her best trying to make board gaming look sexy, but after a certain point she's just looks ridiculous.Since whoever wins the game gets their wish, and it's pretty much a guarantee that if you play SOMEBODY has to win, the simple solution is to wish you never played the game, right?  Fortunately Jason figures this out.  Unfortunately it means everyone has to die before he can get to that point.  Open Graves acts as if this is a huge revelation.  It's not.Open Graves' concept is interesting but director Alvaro de Arminan simply can't deliver.  A side plot involving a cop who wants the game for himself falls apart at the end. Each death is intercut with stultifyingly bad poetry, as if that's supposed to increase the horror of a man getting his eye cut out by a crab.  Without a villain, movies about curses need to work hard to give the victims (and the audience) hope that they can somehow outwit the curse - Final Destination always dangled the possibility that the victim would escape his fate.  There's no way to avoid dying in Open Graves - it's a death march for a bunch of attractive idiots playing a game they don't like.  Not even the actors seem convinced.The ending tries to be edgy.  Mosamba's appearance is the most interesting part of the film, and the special effects are competent enough.

Here, we have the stunning Eliza Dushku, who after a series of small but interesting roles really kicked her career off in 2000's Bring It On, and has made really, really bad movie choices ever since, from the execrable Soul Survivors to this particular piece of silliness, which combines the aforementioned Ghost Game with Final Destination (kind of) with a dash of Hellraiser to come up with something that manages to be both entirely unoriginal and entirely unscary. Kind of odd for a guy who's been assistant director and/or second unit director to such lights as Pedro Almodovar (Live Flesh, All About My Mother), Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto),  and Cesar Martinez Harrada (Everything in Place).So anyway, plot: stoners/slackers on vacation (Cloverfield's Mike Vogel and stuntman Boris Martinez in his first acting role--neither of whom were scripted nearly as white as they are, judging by the way they make fun of Dushku's being white early in the film), along with a pouty model (Lindsay Caroline Robba, also in her first acting role) Pablo is shooting for a calendar and an enigmatic bathing beauty (Dushku) who comes along for, well, no apparent reason, pick up an old (as in Inquisition-era) game called Open Graves in a small market in Spain. It's rainy that night, so they decide to play with some other friends. They soon discover that every time the game is played, one of the players who drew a particular type of card loses his or her life in some really odd way. (Think of it as Monopoly's Chance cards, only with fortune-cookie sayings that are somehow in English, despite the game having, you know, never been out of Spain.) I'm sure you know the rest. Solve the mystery before Final Girl (obvious who that is, no?) gets chomped by the curse, or whatever. There's an even sillier subplot with an obsessed police detective (Gary Paquer), but I won't go into that here.I'm not sure how many ways I can say the word ""dumb"" without a handy thesaurus, so I'll just say this movie is dumb, dumb, dumb. As usual, Dushku is way too good an actress for the role, and you can see her trying to break out of it, but without success. (Until the last fifteen minutes, when her part becomes so unintentionally hilarious that even Meryl Streep couldn't have saved it, that is.) Vogel plays the same kind of cocky-yet-affable guy he did in Cloverfield, so no big stretch there, but he's a likable enough actor. Other than the two of them, however, there is not reason one for you to watch this movie.

1314423,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B002ZNNXD6,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[4, 9]","I am not going to cover a lot of ground on ""Open Graves"" since another reviewer has done quite a nice job noting how poor the film was.  I feel that I do need to add my voice of why I felt this movie was schlock. I remember seeing this movie premiering on ""The Sci-Fi Channel"" (renamed SyFy Channel) last year.I was attracted to this movie because Eliza Dushku (an engaging performer and easy on the eyes) was in it.  I am really a fan of Ms. Dushku; alternately most of the movies she is in are low budget pieces of trash.  This movie is not an exception.  The premise of the movie is a bunch of college students get together to play a game call ""Open Graves"".  The idea of the game is a lot like Jumanji with a macabre twist.  Therefore, one by one the players of this game meet their ominous maker.  Yawn.The acting was horrible, Mike Vogel, COME ON, I have seen ponds with more depth.  The characters (and acting) were insipid and the entire production of this movie was so poor.  The special effects were ""laugh out loud"" funny.  There is a scene involving a snake.  The snake looked like an unfinished graphic for a PBS special.  This is just a paradigm what one will experience when watching ""Open Graves"".  As for the ending, you have got to be out of your mind!!!  I felt desecrated, cheated and violated.  Not because of where the story or characters went, but how I wasted 90 minutes of my life.  This is a lot coming from a person who thought ""Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus"" was a decent B movie.Digressing, I really like Eliza Dushku (even though her performance couldn't save this sinking ship).  She might not be the most prolific actress out there, but she usually chooses good projects to be a part of.  I feel that most of her work in television is very solid.  ""Open Graves"", if nothing else, is an example of a ""poor career"" move on her part.  Who knows maybe Eliza lost a bet, the result this puke.",1,"I've watched it, now please throw me in an open grave and bury me alive",1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,1918,"['am', 'not', 'going', 'cover', 'lot', 'ground', 'Open', 'Graves', 'reviewer', 'done', 'quite', 'nice', 'job', 'noting', 'how', 'poor', 'film', 'was', 'feel', 'do', 'add', 'voice', 'why', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'schlock', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'premiering', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'renamed', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'last', 'year.I', 'was', 'attracted', 'movie', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'engaging', 'performer', 'easy', 'eyes', 'was', 'am', 'really', 'fan', 'Ms.', 'Dushku', 'alternately', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'pieces', 'trash', 'movie', 'not', 'exception', 'premise', 'movie', 'bunch', 'college', 'students', 'get', 'together', 'play', 'game', 'call', 'Open', 'Graves', 'idea', 'game', 'lot', 'Jumanji', 'macabre', 'twist', 'Therefore', 'one', 'one', 'players', 'game', 'meet', 'ominous', 'maker', 'acting', 'was', 'horrible', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'COME', 'ON', 'have', 'seen', 'ponds', 'more', 'depth', 'characters', 'acting', 'were', 'insipid', 'entire', 'production', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'scene', 'involving', 'snake', 'snake', 'looked', 'unfinished', 'graphic', 'PBS', 'special', 'just', 'paradigm', 'what', 'one', 'will', 'experience', 'when', 'watching', 'Open', 'Graves', 'ending', 'have', 'got', 'be', 'mind', 'felt', 'desecrated', 'cheated', 'violated', 'Not', 'where', 'story', 'characters', 'went', 'how', 'wasted', '90', 'minutes', 'life', 'lot', 'coming', 'person', 'who', 'thought', 'Mega', 'Shark', 'vs', 'Giant', 'Octopus', 'was', 'decent', 'B', 'movie.Digressing', 'really', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'even', 'performance', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'sinking', 'ship', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'prolific', 'actress', 'there', 'usually', 'good', 'projects', 'be', 'part', 'feel', 'most', 'work', 'television', 'very', 'solid', 'Open', 'Graves', 'nothing', 'else', 'example', 'poor', 'career', 'move', 'part', 'Who', 'maybe', 'Eliza', 'lost', 'bet', 'result', 'puke']",N/A
1314424,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZNNXD6,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 8]","In this Spanish-American horror film, unsuspecting young surfers and their friends play the board game on a whim. Following the instructions of the game, the seven players roll dice one after another and draw cards, on which they find some enigmatic verses. Actually, the old board game ""Mamba"" was made during the time of the Spanish Inquisition, and it has strange powers these players will know when one of them is found dead exactly the way the card predicted.Two names will pop up in our mind immediately - ""Final Destination"" and ""Jumanji."" Unfortunately the deaths of ""Open Graves"" are less shocking than in the former, and its CGI effects are much worse than the latter. Each set-piece is decent, but predictable, and some scenes feel drawn-out. The film contains some gruesome materials, but is never really scary.Perhaps, like me, you are interested in the film because of the two names: Mike Vogel and Eliza Dushku. Mike Vogel plays an American student visiting Spain (the story is set in Spain) and Eliza Dushku is Erica, a mysterious beauty living in a lighthouse. Their acting is not bad, I think. Because of the film's thin story, however, the two actors don't have much to do - and what their characters should do is pretty obvious from the very beginning of the game.The film has two subplots about a veteran detective of the local police and a man in a wheelchair, but first-time feature director &Aacute;lvaro de Armi&ntilde;&aacute;n fail to use their back stories (both related to the game) effectively, missing chances to heighten what little mystery or suspense there was in the main story. The ending (which I don't reveal here) is, I admit, something not many people would expect, sort of refreshing, but still it can be better with more developed characters and some additional ideas.Being an Eliza Dushku fan, I find the film passable viewing (hence my rating), but I believe some will be disappointed with the film and its dearth of suspense or scares.",2,"(2.5 STARS) ""Final Destination"" Meets ""Jumanji"": Passable Horror Suspence Starring Mike Vogel and Eliza Dushku",1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,1980,"['Spanish-American', 'horror', 'film', 'unsuspecting', 'young', 'surfers', 'friends', 'play', 'board', 'game', 'whim', 'Following', 'instructions', 'game', 'seven', 'players', 'roll', 'dice', 'one', 'draw', 'cards', 'find', 'enigmatic', 'verses', 'Actually', 'old', 'board', 'game', 'Mamba', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'strange', 'powers', 'players', 'will', 'know', 'when', 'one', 'found', 'dead', 'exactly', 'way', 'card', 'predicted.Two', 'names', 'will', 'pop', 'up', 'mind', 'immediately', 'Final', 'Destination', 'Jumanji', 'Unfortunately', 'deaths', 'Open', 'Graves', 'are', 'less', 'shocking', 'former', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'worse', 'latter', 'set-piece', 'decent', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'feel', 'drawn-out', 'film', 'gruesome', 'materials', 'never', 'really', 'scary.Perhaps', 'are', 'interested', 'film', 'two', 'names', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'American', 'student', 'visiting', 'Spain', 'story', 'set', 'Spain', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Erica', 'mysterious', 'beauty', 'living', 'lighthouse', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'think', 'film', 'thin', 'story', 'however', 'two', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'what', 'characters', 'should', 'do', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'very', 'beginning', 'game.The', 'film', 'two', 'subplots', 'veteran', 'detective', 'local', 'police', 'man', 'wheelchair', 'first-time', 'feature', 'director', 'Aacute', 'lvaro', 'de', 'Armi', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'fail', 'use', 'back', 'stories', 'related', 'game', 'effectively', 'missing', 'chances', 'heighten', 'what', 'little', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'there', 'was', 'main', 'story', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here', 'admit', 'something', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'sort', 'refreshing', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'developed', 'characters', 'additional', 'ideas.Being', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'fan', 'find', 'film', 'passable', 'viewing', 'hence', 'rating', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'dearth', 'suspense', 'scares']",N/A
