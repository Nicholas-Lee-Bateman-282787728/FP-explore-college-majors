560472,A33Y35HJGDHZ2H,B00004YZGP,B. Wright,"[5, 7]","This particular concert would have been astounding to watch from close up in person.  The vocals were mostly spot on.  I have to give these boys a hand.  They really can sing in concert, which I was not expecting when I bought this video.The grandeur of the show was degraded by the shoddy camera work, the bad cuts and the horrible audio mix.VideoThe camera work intercuts way too frequently usually not pointing at the correct location to get the perspective of the concert.  Although, the camera work is good enough to get most of the action.AudioThe audio recording sound quality is good, but not excellent.  The vocal mixes were, in most cases, way too low next to the music.  At many times, you can barely hear JC or Justin over the music and noise.  It's probably tough to mix a concert in among loud screaming fans, but I'm sure there has to be someone who could have done it.  Another example is during 'No Strings Attached', Lance's vocals are way too loud compared to Justin.And, on many songs you can hear the breathing against the microphone (very annoying).  While I know this can only be avoided to some degree, they could have turned the mics down during the non-singing parts.Song RenditionsIn most cases, the band does excellent renditions of the songs.  Many times, they rival the studio recording... which is quite a feat in a live setting.  Not many bands can accomplish this with such mastery no matter how hard they try.The exception to this is ""Bye Bye Bye"".  This is probably the worst rendition on the video.  The haphazard dance movements get in the way of the vocals and cause noticable degredation.  Plus, the guys were just plain tired and their vocals were not pristine seeing as it was an encore.  This song should have been first, not last.  I know they save the best for last, but in this case, I would have preferred to hear this one first.The best rendition being ""God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You"" with a close second to ""I Thought She Knew"".DancingWhile the dancing was very energetic, I felt that many of the syncronized movements got in the way of the song.  The songs were, in most cases, just not energetic enough to warrant that kind of dance.  I still have to give them cheers to be able to be that synchronized and still sing that well (except Bye Bye Bye).BanteringThere was a lot of bantering by the band members between the songs.  There was some kind of chatter between nearly every song.  There were only two songs where they went from one song directly into another without stopping.OverallThis is an excellent concert to watch on video.  It's too bad I didn't get to see it live (and probably never will since the band has disbanded).One last thing, throughout the video, they keep making references to being 'here to stay' in retort to those who were saying boy band days are numbered.  To that, I say, told you so.  Those were my sentiments at the time even though I have since watched the video and I do admire their ability to put on a concert without lipsyncing (that I can tell anyway).If you're a fan, it's definitely worth a buy.  If you like to watch excellent concerts, this is definitely one not to miss.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the production.  Especially after having seen a Backstreet Boys concert where the production was so much lower and the quality was average (and in some cases, below average) concert quality.",4,"Mostly excellent concert, bad video work, mediocre audio",1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,3422,"['particular', 'concert', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'astounding', 'watch', 'close', 'up', 'person', 'vocals', 'were', 'mostly', 'spot', 'have', 'give', 'boys', 'hand', 'really', 'can', 'sing', 'concert', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'when', 'bought', 'video.The', 'grandeur', 'show', 'was', 'degraded', 'shoddy', 'camera', 'work', 'bad', 'cuts', 'horrible', 'audio', 'mix.VideoThe', 'camera', 'work', 'intercuts', 'way', 'too', 'frequently', 'usually', 'not', 'pointing', 'correct', 'location', 'get', 'perspective', 'concert', 'camera', 'work', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'most', 'action.AudioThe', 'audio', 'recording', 'sound', 'quality', 'good', 'not', 'excellent', 'vocal', 'mixes', 'were', 'most', 'cases', 'way', 'too', 'low', 'next', 'music', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'JC', 'Justin', 'music', 'noise', 'probably', 'tough', 'mix', 'concert', 'loud', 'screaming', 'fans', ""'m"", 'sure', 'there', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'example', ""'No"", 'Strings', 'Attached', 'Lance', 'vocals', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'loud', 'compared', 'Justin.And', 'many', 'songs', 'can', 'hear', 'breathing', 'microphone', 'very', 'annoying', 'know', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'avoided', 'degree', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'mics', 'down', 'non-singing', 'parts.Song', 'RenditionsIn', 'most', 'cases', 'band', 'excellent', 'renditions', 'songs', 'Many', 'times', 'rival', 'studio', 'recording', 'quite', 'feat', 'live', 'setting', 'Not', 'many', 'bands', 'can', 'accomplish', 'such', 'mastery', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try.The', 'exception', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'probably', 'worst', 'rendition', 'video', 'haphazard', 'dance', 'movements', 'get', 'way', 'vocals', 'cause', 'noticable', 'degredation', 'guys', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'tired', 'vocals', 'were', 'not', 'pristine', 'seeing', 'was', 'encore', 'song', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'not', 'last', 'know', 'save', 'best', 'last', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'hear', 'one', 'first.The', 'best', 'rendition', 'being', 'God', 'Must', 'Have', 'Spent', 'A', 'Little', 'More', 'Time', 'close', 'second', 'Thought', 'Knew', 'dancing', 'was', 'very', 'energetic', 'felt', 'many', 'syncronized', 'movements', 'got', 'way', 'song', 'songs', 'were', 'most', 'cases', 'just', 'not', 'energetic', 'enough', 'warrant', 'kind', 'dance', 'still', 'have', 'give', 'cheers', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'synchronized', 'still', 'sing', 'well', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Bye', '.BanteringThere', 'was', 'lot', 'bantering', 'band', 'members', 'songs', 'was', 'kind', 'chatter', 'nearly', 'song', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'songs', 'where', 'went', 'one', 'song', 'directly', 'stopping.OverallThis', 'excellent', 'concert', 'watch', 'video', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'live', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'band', 'disbanded', '.One', 'last', 'thing', 'video', 'keep', 'making', 'references', 'being', 'stay', 'retort', 'who', 'were', 'saying', 'boy', 'band', 'days', 'are', 'numbered', 'say', 'told', 'so', 'were', 'sentiments', 'time', 'even', 'have', 'watched', 'video', 'do', 'admire', 'ability', 'put', 'concert', 'lipsyncing', 'can', 'tell', 'anyway', '.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buy', 'like', 'watch', 'excellent', 'concerts', 'definitely', 'one', 'not', 'miss', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'production', 'Especially', 'having', 'seen', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'concert', 'where', 'production', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'lower', 'quality', 'was', 'average', 'cases', 'average', 'concert', 'quality']",N/A

560479,A34S0FQAI0OYNP,B00004YZGP,peach momo,"[0, 1]","Having heard the type of energetic music dished out lately by the Orlando-based `N Sync, it comes as no unimaginable achievement for them to pull off an equally feisty feat in their concert. Expect to be dazzled with flamboyant costumes, colorful surprises and loads of raging, screaming fans for the whole 80-min show formerly broadcast on HBO.Like similar offerings from their counterparts, 'N Sync has its own rigourous dance rountine complemented by a rowdy, mainly female-based audience. Yet, with the opening song &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; seeing the five 'N Sync members soaring in mid-air strung on wire cables, the viewer should be subliminally prepared for a not quite run-of-the-mill visual spectacle ahead. For one, the outrageous, intricately embrioderated threads donned by `N Sync is rarely seen on many ""boybands"" of today.  Watch how 'N Sync &quot;light up&quot; into existence in &quot;Digital Getdown&quot;, not forgetting the ensuing, interesting dance sequence in the later part of the song. Even the stage, seemingly simple in structure, had its own spectacular show of tricks to boot - elevating pillars, mobile platforms, laser beams, conveyer belts, etc.If there is any mild dissatisfaction for this video, it could be the slightly off editing, leading to minor misses easily picked up by a discerning eye. Misalignment in dance positions that could have been covered up with an oblique camera shot was left unattended. There was a shot of JC Chasez in &quot;Digital Get Down&quot; that could been best deleted (was he licking his lips?). But, in any case, these trival flaws hardly impair the entertainment value of the concert. If you're a 'N Sync fan, you would definitely enjoy this video.Comparing between the DVD and the VHS formats, the main difference lies in an additional photo gallery present in the DVD which is really nothing special. The VHS is probably good enough.**A batch defect or an original factory production fault? On enabling the lyrics of my DVD, at Chapter 01, time 00:06:00, a display resembling the Micosoft Windows Explorer bar appears instead of lyrics.
