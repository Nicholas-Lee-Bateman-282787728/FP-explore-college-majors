I think this is Robin Williams best movie of all time, and i've seen all of them.  The special features are nothing to write home about (Pretty much just talking about how Robin improvised nearly the entire first half of the movie), but that doesn't change the fact that this is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time.  So get the special edition if you want the features, don't if not, but regardless, this movie is a must have for anyone who has ever even chuckled at anything that has ever come out of the mouth that is the one and only Robin Williams.",5,Robin William's Best,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,658,"['absolutely', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'classic', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'style', 'emotional', 'think', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'best', 'movie', 'time', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'Pretty', 'much', 'just', 'talking', 'how', 'Robin', 'improvised', 'nearly', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'movie', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'top', '3', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'So', 'get', 'special', 'edition', 'want', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'regardless', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'even', 'chuckled', 'anything', 'ever', 'come', 'mouth', 'one', 'only', 'Robin', 'Williams']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS
351542,A2S244KFX0745K,6303027016,Alan Edward Creager,"[2, 2]","Beware the Spoilers.""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is a wonderful movie. From start to finish, you never doubt that it is set in 1965 Saigon, with the Vietnam War not yet at the pitch it reached with the 1968 Tet Offensive, but definitely heading in that direction. The unconventional, hopelessly unmilitary Airman Adrian Cronauer, fresh out of Crete ""With women that look like Zorba"", gets off an airliner and is greeted by the seemingly perpetually-happy PFC Eddie Garlick, who never stops calling Cronaeur ""Sir"" even though the Air Force radio DJ has no rank whatsoever. Assigned to AFRS- Armed Forces Radio Saigon- Cronauer rides in a M151 MUTT through Saigon's crowded streets. The ride is entertaining even before it begins: PFC Garlick forgets the MUTT is already running and tries to start it, causing it to emit a noise everyone, car fan or not, will surely dread. Airman Cronauer meets one of his soon-to-be-coworkers at AFRS over the radio before he meets him in person. Dan ""The Man"" Levitan, a friendly but appallingly bland radio jockey, rambles on as Garlick drives. A dismayed Cronauer remarks, ""That guy's as boring as whale ****."" It is an act of true kindness on Cronauer's part that he never tells Levitan this in person. We soon meet the rest of the AFRS staff, some of whom are enthusiastic, others indifferent, and still others hostile to Airman Cronauer's arrival. Chief among the last bunch is Sergeant Major ""Where is this man's paperwork?"" Dickerson, who was allegedly shot in the *** while on a combat patrol. Dickerson hates Cronauer with increasing passion and outright glee as the film goes on, despising his politics and finding nothing funny about anything he says. The station censors, two unnnamed twin sergeants played by Don R. and Don E. Stanton, are the indifferent crowd. All each of them says in greeting to Cronauer is a nod, a blank look, and eventually, ""Hiya."" I found one of Cronauer's remarks about their jobs quite funny- ""Oh, yes! Censor, censor, censor! Join the Army and mark things!"" Soon, we find Cronauer going on air for the first time. There is a moment of uncertain silence. We in the audience are uncertain, the listeners, the staff, even Cronauer himself seem unsure of what will happen next. Then he cuts loose with a joyous cry of ""Gooooooood morning, Vietnam!"" and nothing is ever the same again.Airman Cronauer is hated by the bureaucrats and loved by the soldiers for the same reason- his manner is totally unconventional, entirely unpredictable, and he starts a wonderful tradition of busting the bureaucracy's rules by tossing the bland music selections aside and blasting across the airwaves with modern rock and roll. The first song he hits us with is the magnificent ""Nowhere To Run"" by Martha Reeves & The Vandellas. Yes! Going off the air, Cronauer spots one of the pretty Vietnamese girls he saw on his ride to the station earlier. He buys a bike with metal wheels and chases her across Saigon, leaving the hapless and distressed PFC Garlick to attempt to keep up. Seeing her go into an English class, Cronauer wonders what he can do to meet her. Garlick insists there is nothing that will work, that the cultural differences between Americans and Vietnamese are simply too much. But being the happy-go-lucky soul he is, Cronauer goes for it anyway. But what does he do? He walks into the class and buys it from the Army sergeant already teaching. His equally unconventional and hilarious way of teaching the class provides some of the greatest scenes in the movie. His first conversation with the class is this- ""First thing I'd like to know is, what subject this is."" A kindly middle-aged Vietnamese woman puts her hand up. ""Is it English?"" ""Yes it is, thank you so much for playing!"" It is after the class that we are introduced to Trinh and her brother, Tuan. The relationship he attempts to create with Trinh, and the friendship he does create with Tuan, are immensely influential in deciding the outcome of his tour in Saigon.This movie is hilarious- just about knocked me dead when I first saw it. But there is far more depth to it than if it were simply a comedy. It has very sad and thought-provoking moments as well as happy ones, and does not shy away from the senseless horrors of war. More and more, it appears that Vietnam is a world gone mad, and that the insane folks are the ones who make the rules.The degree to which SGM Dickerson loathes Airman Cronauer becomes apparent later on, when he has Cronauer kicked off the air after he violates regulations and reports on a bombing at Jimmy Wah's bar. Cronauer yells that Dickerson just wants everyone to think everything is fine in Vietnam when the opposite is true, and that the war is a couple of blocks away at most. Dickerson bellows that it is none of his blankety-blank business and replaces him with the horribly bland LT Steven Hauk. Cronauer is soon back on the air, to the tune of thousands of letters and calls from furious and bewildered GI's, who cannot stand to hear Hauk's awful comedy routine and the polka music he insists on choosing over rock and roll. The scene in which Hauk is fired as a radio DJ is one of the most significant in the movie, and has a surprisingly touching line from Hauk. Deeply hurt by Brigadier General Taylor's declaration that Cronauer is better at comedy than he is and *will* be reinstated, LT Hauk salutes and says, ""Sir, in my heart I know I'm funny."" Dickerson, still carrying on his vendetta against Cronauer, vows ""This is not over yet."" as he leaves. Dickerson sends Cronauer and Garlick into an area he knows is VC-controlled, hoping to get them killed, and only the intervention of Tuan prevents this. But even then it's not over- upon his return to AFRS studios, Cronauer meets with a gloating, triumphant SGM Dickerson, who gleefully informs Cronauer that he is gone. The reason? Tuan is not who he claims. He is a VC terrorist, responsible for many bombings in Saigon, including Jimmy Wah's. He was able to rescue Cronauer and Garlick because the guys hunting them were his friends. Dickerson has Cronauer beaten at last, but even then the Airman has the last laugh- he delivers one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in farewell to the good Sergeant Major, and as Dickerson pursues he is stopped by General Taylor. Why? Taylor, who has always loved Cronauer and is deeply sorry to see him leave, though mercifully with an honorable discharge, has at last had enough of Dickerson's unrelenting seriousness and hostility, and informs him that he, too is gone- SGM Dickerson, who had once boasted of his talent at sending people he hates to places they never even knew the Army had personnel in, is going to Guam.Cronauer's confrontation with 'Tuan', his final softball game with his English class, and the goodbye he and Trinh give one another are beautiful. He leaves PFC Garlick, who has taken over his post as radio DJ, with one last broadcast, and tells him to take care of himself. Garlick readily acknowledges that playing the broadcast could get him in trouble. Having learned from Cronauer and become increasingly bold and outgoing through the course of the film, he says that Trouble is now his new middle name.""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is everything it promises and so much more- it makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you think about many things, and in the end, if you appreciate the movie as I did, you will walk away loving it. This is as good a film on the Vietnam War as any, and one I highly recommend.""'scuse me, sir. Seeing how the former VP is such a VIP, shouldn't we keep the PC on the QT, 'cause if it leaks to the VC, he could end up an MIA and then we'd all be put on KP.""

He is undoubtedly funnier here than in either of those two movies.Adrian Croener's lively, upbeat, and hilarious radio show contrasts with the monotone, boring, and mundane show of the other DJ.  Right from the start, his superiors at the radio station treat him like dirt for no good reason at all.  One of them replaces him on the radio for a short time and while he thought he was funny, the only funny thing about his show was that he thought he was funny.  Among the humor on his show are things like voice impersonations, saying Nixon sounds like Mr. Ed the horse, creating guest voices in the studio, and my favorite- playing a tape he was forced to play of a conversation with Nixon.  He played it allright, but he interrupted segments of it with questions directed at Nixon, followed by his taped response to another question.  For example, one of the parts went somethign like this: Nixon was saying, ""I'm very unsatisfied with it, there's a lack of feeling there,"" and before it he interrupted the tape and asked, ""How is your sex life?""In the studio, Adrian sees the news coming in and that it must be ""approved"" before it is read on the air to the soldiers in Vietnam.  The things that are struck out are bits of news that point to a long, hard, and losing war ahead.  He wants the soldiers to be aware of these things, reasoning that freedom of speech is what America is all about.  He finally has ""had it"" with the resistance when a restaurant is blown up which he was in just a minute before.  So he gives up on the radio, but the masses make plain his extraordinary popularity and he gets back on.In the ending, Adrian is forced to relocate because he was friends with a boy who turned out to be the enemy.  This highlights a point he made earlier-- how do you know where or who the enemy is?  Angry, he chased down the boy and asked him what the hell.  The boy explained that it is not the communists but the Americans who are the enemy of Vietnam.  He tearfully yells about his family members who have been killed by American troops.  This incident highlights the point of the movie that American involvement in Vietnam was wrong.The conclusion of the movie is that although Adrian was stuck in a troubled, bad situation, he made the most of it, managing to do good and remain uncorrupted.",4,Balanced mix of comedy and seriousness.,1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,2522,"['roles', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'role', 'man', 'trying', 'persistenly', 'enlighten', 'help', 'others', 'spite', 'stubborn', 'wrong', 'status', 'quo', 'authority', 'figures', 'undoubtedly', 'funnier', 'here', 'two', 'movies.Adrian', 'Croener', 'lively', 'upbeat', 'hilarious', 'radio', 'show', 'monotone', 'boring', 'mundane', 'show', 'other', 'DJ', 'Right', 'start', 'superiors', 'radio', 'station', 'treat', 'dirt', 'good', 'reason', 'One', 'radio', 'short', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'only', 'funny', 'thing', 'show', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'humor', 'show', 'are', 'things', 'voice', 'impersonations', 'saying', 'Nixon', 'Mr.', 'Ed', 'horse', 'creating', 'guest', 'voices', 'studio', 'favorite-', 'playing', 'tape', 'was', 'forced', 'play', 'conversation', 'Nixon', 'played', 'allright', 'interrupted', 'segments', 'questions', 'directed', 'Nixon', 'followed', 'taped', 'response', 'question', 'example', 'one', 'parts', 'went', 'somethign', 'Nixon', 'was', 'saying', ""'m"", 'very', 'unsatisfied', 'lack', 'feeling', 'there', 'interrupted', 'tape', 'asked', 'How', 'sex', 'life', 'studio', 'Adrian', 'news', 'coming', 'must', 'be', 'approved', 'read', 'air', 'soldiers', 'Vietnam', 'things', 'are', 'struck', 'out', 'are', 'bits', 'news', 'point', 'long', 'hard', 'losing', 'war', 'ahead', 'soldiers', 'be', 'aware', 'things', 'reasoning', 'freedom', 'speech', 'what', 'America', 'about', 'finally', 'had', 'resistance', 'when', 'restaurant', 'blown', 'up', 'was', 'just', 'minute', 'before', 'up', 'radio', 'masses', 'make', 'plain', 'extraordinary', 'popularity', 'back', 'ending', 'Adrian', 'forced', 'relocate', 'was', 'friends', 'boy', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'enemy', 'point', 'made', 'earlier', 'how', 'do', 'know', 'where', 'who', 'enemy', 'Angry', 'chased', 'down', 'boy', 'asked', 'what', 'hell', 'boy', 'explained', 'not', 'communists', 'Americans', 'who', 'are', 'enemy', 'Vietnam', 'tearfully', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'American', 'troops', 'incident', 'point', 'movie', 'American', 'involvement', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'Adrian', 'was', 'stuck', 'troubled', 'bad', 'situation', 'made', 'most', 'managing', 'do', 'good', 'remain', 'uncorrupted']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS
351545,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303027016,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","When `Good Morning Vietnam' allows itself to be nothing more than entertainment it passes with flying colors.  It's the type of movie that really doesn't need too much of a plot.  When the film tries to add some substance to its running time is when it starts to fray at the edges.`Good Morning Vietnam' tells the somewhat true story (as in the film is not entirely faithful to actual events) of Adrian Cronauer, a radio DJ who spiced things up during the Vietnam War.  During his stationing in Vietnam he raised the morale of the troupes but also managed to press the buttons of some of the higher officials who saw his approach to broadcast as a slap in the face so-to-speak.  Their resistance didn't stop Cronauer from expressing his viewpoints and bucking the system, reading news he felt the troupes needed to hear, telling jokes he felt would raise their spirits and playing music he knew they would enjoy.When the film is focused on that aspect of Cronauer's stay it soars.  Robin Williams is hilarious, we all know this, and the film really allows him to just perform his standup routine to us all to enjoy; and enjoy we do.  Williams also manages to delve into the moments that startle and unravel Adrian, piecing together a complete man and not just a walking punch-line.But then, sadly, the film tries to add weight, and that weight comes in the form of Tuan, a young Vietnamese boy who befriends Adrian.  For the majority of the film he seems harmless enough; just an acquaintance to add some humanity to Williams' character, but in the third act new revelations are revealed and his character changes, and this spurs the film in an entirely different direction that, in my humble opinion, takes away from the films enjoyment.It feels forced and unnecessary.Until that moment though, the film is wonderful.  It is funny and moving and meaningful.  The performances for the most part are also splendid.  Williams received a much deserved Oscar nomination for his performance, and of the nominated five I have a feeling I would have leaned towards Williams for the win as well.  Tung Thanh Tran is also effective as Tuan, even if his characters development is ridiculous in my opinion.  Forest Whitaker is somewhat annoying here, but it was early in his career so I'll give him some slack (is it just me or does he sound like David Chappelle's imitation of a white man?).  The real standout here is Bruno Kirby who just nails Lt. Steven Hauk's wit and humor (or un-wit and un-humor) brilliantly and provides some of the films biggest laughs.In the end I must say that I enjoyed `Good Morning Vietnam' and would love to say that it was one of the best films of 1987.  If the ending had been ditched for one more appropriate then I would say that, but that pesky final act just throws the whole thing for me.  I recommend this film, because it has a lot going for it; it just pains me to say that it could have been even better.",4,Good morning indeed...,1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,2936,"['When', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'entertainment', 'flying', 'colors', 'type', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'need', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'When', 'film', 'tries', 'add', 'substance', 'running', 'time', 'when', 'fray', 'edges.', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'somewhat', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'faithful', 'actual', 'events', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'radio', 'DJ', 'who', 'spiced', 'things', 'up', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'stationing', 'Vietnam', 'raised', 'morale', 'troupes', 'also', 'managed', 'press', 'buttons', 'higher', 'officials', 'who', 'saw', 'approach', 'broadcast', 'slap', 'face', 'so-to-speak', 'resistance', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Cronauer', 'expressing', 'viewpoints', 'bucking', 'system', 'reading', 'news', 'felt', 'troupes', 'needed', 'hear', 'telling', 'jokes', 'felt', 'would', 'raise', 'spirits', 'playing', 'music', 'knew', 'would', 'enjoy.When', 'film', 'focused', 'aspect', 'Cronauer', 'stay', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'hilarious', 'know', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'perform', 'standup', 'routine', 'enjoy', 'enjoy', 'do', 'Williams', 'also', 'delve', 'moments', 'startle', 'unravel', 'Adrian', 'piecing', 'together', 'complete', 'man', 'not', 'just', 'walking', 'punch-line.But', 'then', 'sadly', 'film', 'tries', 'add', 'weight', 'weight', 'form', 'Tuan', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'boy', 'who', 'Adrian', 'majority', 'film', 'harmless', 'enough', 'just', 'acquaintance', 'add', 'humanity', 'Williams', 'character', 'third', 'act', 'new', 'revelations', 'are', 'revealed', 'character', 'changes', 'film', 'entirely', 'different', 'direction', 'humble', 'opinion', 'away', 'films', 'enjoyment.It', 'feels', 'forced', 'unnecessary.Until', 'moment', 'film', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'moving', 'meaningful', 'performances', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'also', 'splendid', 'Williams', 'received', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'nominated', 'five', 'have', 'feeling', 'would', 'have', 'leaned', 'towards', 'Williams', 'win', 'as', 'well', 'Tung', 'Thanh', 'Tran', 'also', 'effective', 'Tuan', 'even', 'characters', 'development', 'ridiculous', 'opinion', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'here', 'was', 'early', 'career', ""'ll"", 'give', 'slack', 'just', 'sound', 'David', 'Chappelle', 'imitation', 'white', 'man', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'who', 'just', 'nails', 'Lt.', 'Steven', 'Hauk', 'wit', 'humor', 'un-wit', 'un-humor', 'brilliantly', 'films', 'biggest', 'laughs.In', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'love', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1987', 'ending', 'had', 'been', 'ditched', 'one', 'more', 'appropriate', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'pesky', 'final', 'act', 'just', 'whole', 'thing', 'recommend', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'just', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS
351546,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,6303027016,andy8047,"[0, 0]","""Hello Vietnam,and greetings!"",says Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk in one scene of this film. It was this scene where he filled in for radio personality Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams) who was on reportedly on special assignment. Adrian arrives in Vietnam from America via aircraft. At first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the Vietnam radio airwaves. But they discover that Adrian's brand of humor is outrageous,very much like Howard Stern in real life. They also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing. Hey,this was(set in) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones from the United Kingdom. When Adrian and Lt. Hauk first met,the lieutenant told Adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself. When the lieutenant first heard Adrian on the air,the lieutenant was not pleased at all with Adrian's stint. ""You oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music',not wild stuff"",Lt. Hauk told Adrian in a meeting. The 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like Andy Williams,Perry Como,Mantovani,Jim Nabors,Lawrence Welk,Frank Sinatra and Percy Faith. ""Would Bob Dylan be out of line?"",Adrian asks Lt. Hauk and the lieutenant replies,""Way,way,way out of line!"". Adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in Vietnam and they hoped that Adrian would permanently do his morning show there. The brass decides to suspend Adrian,bringing heartbreak to fans. When Lt. Hauk did his stint,many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted Adrian back on the air. One listener said in a letter,""Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls."" Another wrote to Lt. Hauk,""You suck,eat a bag of s--t!"". So Adrian is back on the air but not for long because Sgt. Dickerson(the late J.T. Walsh),the top man of the brass,demanded that Adrian be cancelled. Sgt. Dickerson's superior loves Adrian and even demanded his reinstatement. Sgt. Dickerson is transferred to Guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant's abusive attitude. The title of this film is how Adrian began his morning show. On the very last show done by Adrian's friend Lt. Ed Garlick(Forrest Whittaker),Ed began the show saying,""Good morning,Vietnam"",just like Adrian. Ed tells listeners about Adrian's departure from Vietnam. We hear Adrian saying,""Goodbye,Vietnam"" in a pre-recorded message. Adrian also left Vietnam because of his association with a criminal who's the brother of a Vietnamese woman Adrian befriended. Other funny scenes include Adrian teaching the Vietnamese how to use profanity,Adrian doing a parody of the late Richard M. Nixon on the air and Adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield. This film was a megahit for both Williams and director Barry Levinson. They were both at least nominated for Academy Awards. Levinson did win a Best Director Oscar for his next film,RAIN MAN. This film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like THREE MEN AND A BABY. Both films were made by Touchstone Pictures,a division of Buena Vista Pictures. THREE MEN AND A BABY was a megahit as well. Both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. THREE MEN AND A BABY inspired a sequel,why didn't GMV?

But I have avoided this movie for a long time, since I have such mixed emotions and memories of the Vietnam War era. Still, the premise of this movie finally got to me: a disc jockey on the service radio station with all the ad-lib skill and insane humor of Robin Williams. After all, those guys needed things to laugh about, you betcha.Adrian Cronhauer (Williams) arrives to find the station is a decidedly mixed bag. Some are total sourpusses, some are just no-talent (the guy who thinks he should play polkas and tells the most stupid jokes you have ever heard), and some are cool but essentially powerless. That is, if you go by the rules. Cronhauer is not really into rules. He knows he's in a war zone, although he is told Saigon itself is pretty safe. And he accepts the twin censors (yes, literally twins) who cut out most of the news before he can broadcast it. But he plays rock and roll, he jives with the audience, makes up incredible ""interviews"" with people he imitates (including Nixon, among others), and becomes extremely popular with the soldiers. Not so the officers, except the one commander who understands that morale is a major issue with the troops, and is the one who discovered Cronauer on Greek radio and brought him to Vietnam.He's starstruck over a beautiful girl who passes by on the street, tracks her to an English class being taught by a soldier, and bribes the teacher to let him teach for awhile. But the girl is there with her brother, who is very protective. Keep your eye on that brother.Without giving away any plot lines, one thing I can recommend is you pay close attention in that English class, where Cronauer is really Robin Williams, teaching the class how to talk street-wise American English. Very, very funny stuff.There's both humor and tragedy, and some very thoughtful aspects to both, as in most Robin Williams films. Why not five stars? Because the military parts are pretty one-dimensional, the good guys really good, the bad guys really awful. The good guys smart; the bad guys stupid. And I figure you've seen one Vietnam war movie, you don't need more of bombs and bloody corpses. Still, I will grant they are relevant to the story, and not too over-done. Or at least the bombing of the bar where the Americans hang out is relevant to the story.",4,Destined to Be a Classic,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,2341,"['Everybody', 'love', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'have', 'avoided', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'such', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'memories', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'era', 'Still', 'premise', 'movie', 'finally', 'got', 'disc', 'jockey', 'service', 'radio', 'station', 'ad-lib', 'skill', 'insane', 'humor', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'guys', 'needed', 'things', 'laugh', 'about', 'betcha.Adrian', 'Cronhauer', 'Williams', 'find', 'station', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'bag', 'are', 'total', 'sourpusses', 'are', 'just', 'no-talent', 'guy', 'who', 'should', 'play', 'polkas', 'most', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'are', 'cool', 'essentially', 'powerless', 'go', 'rules', 'Cronhauer', 'not', 'really', 'rules', 'war', 'zone', 'told', 'Saigon', 'pretty', 'safe', 'twin', 'censors', 'yes', 'literally', 'twins', 'who', 'cut', 'out', 'most', 'news', 'can', 'broadcast', 'rock', 'roll', 'audience', 'up', 'incredible', 'interviews', 'people', 'including', 'Nixon', 'others', 'extremely', 'popular', 'soldiers', 'Not', 'officers', 'one', 'commander', 'who', 'morale', 'major', 'issue', 'troops', 'one', 'who', 'discovered', 'Cronauer', 'Greek', 'radio', 'brought', 'Vietnam.He', 'starstruck', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'street', 'English', 'class', 'being', 'taught', 'soldier', 'teacher', 'let', 'teach', 'awhile', 'girl', 'there', 'brother', 'who', 'very', 'protective', 'Keep', 'eye', 'brother.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'lines', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'recommend', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'English', 'class', 'where', 'Cronauer', 'really', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'teaching', 'class', 'how', 'talk', 'street-wise', 'American', 'English', 'Very', 'very', 'funny', 'stuff.There', 'humor', 'tragedy', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'aspects', 'most', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'films', 'Why', 'not', 'five', 'stars', 'military', 'parts', 'are', 'pretty', 'one-dimensional', 'good', 'guys', 'really', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'really', 'awful', 'good', 'guys', 'smart', 'bad', 'guys', 'stupid', 'figure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'bombs', 'bloody', 'corpses', 'Still', 'will', 'grant', 'are', 'relevant', 'story', 'not', 'too', 'over-done', 'least', 'bombing', 'bar', 'where', 'Americans', 'hang', 'out', 'relevant', 'story']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Good Morning, Vietnam stars Robin Williams playing the character of a radio announcer/comedian who makes the trip to Vietnam and gives the soldiers the morning news by way of humor, honesty and quick-witted cleverness.However, the entire movie is not *quite* a comedy film.  Every so often, you will be probably be surprised by a few really accurate portrayals showing what it really was like living in Vietnam during the war involving the way the Vietnamese were living.However the storyline mostly centers around Robin Williams' character getting to know the Vietnamese and communicating with them by walking around town and meeting them.  He even becomes a temporary teacher at one point, teaching the Vietnamese the English language and entertaining them in a goofy manner.Robin immediately takes an interest in this one Vietnamese woman who initially doesn't give a darn about him at all, but eventually things change later on.Another storyline element involves the brother of the girl he has an interest in.  He plays a crucial (and surprising) part in the storyline later on and gives one heck of a great speech at the end of the film.I'm really shocked at a few of those accurate surprises I mention above.  One scene in particular shows an explosion that totally caught me by surprise because of the timing, and other scenes show Vietnamese teens being forced to stand up against a wall and immediately be shot.  These are really shocking scenes to me.Luckily the really violent and brutally honest portrayal of Vietnam back in the early 70's only takes up a very small portion of the actual storyline.  The movie mostly focuses on Robin Williams' role as the comedian.Now those of you who've seen Robin Williams stand-up comedy routine, don't worry- he's not nearly as crude in this film as he is during those comedy acts on stage.  I'd say 80% of the jokes in Good Morning, Vietnam are clean and completely appropriate for the entire viewing audience.  That *other* 20% isn't really that bad either.  To sum it up- the film mostly shows Robin Williams just being his typically goofy self.A movie I highly recommend for the drama and comedy elements, however if you dislike Robin Williams style of humor, it's probably best to steer clear of this one.",5,very good,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,2261,"['Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'playing', 'character', 'radio', 'announcer/comedian', 'who', 'trip', 'Vietnam', 'soldiers', 'morning', 'news', 'way', 'humor', 'honesty', 'quick-witted', 'cleverness.However', 'entire', 'movie', 'not', '*quite*', 'comedy', 'film', 'so', 'often', 'will', 'be', 'probably', 'be', 'surprised', 'few', 'really', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'showing', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'living', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'involving', 'way', 'Vietnamese', 'were', 'living.However', 'storyline', 'mostly', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'getting', 'know', 'Vietnamese', 'communicating', 'walking', 'around', 'town', 'meeting', 'even', 'temporary', 'teacher', 'one', 'point', 'teaching', 'Vietnamese', 'English', 'language', 'entertaining', 'goofy', 'manner.Robin', 'immediately', 'interest', 'one', 'Vietnamese', 'woman', 'who', 'initially', ""n't"", 'give', 'darn', 'eventually', 'things', 'change', 'later', 'on.Another', 'storyline', 'element', 'brother', 'girl', 'interest', 'crucial', 'surprising', 'part', 'storyline', 'later', 'one', 'heck', 'great', 'speech', 'end', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'shocked', 'few', 'accurate', 'surprises', 'mention', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'shows', 'explosion', 'totally', 'caught', 'surprise', 'timing', 'other', 'scenes', 'show', 'Vietnamese', 'teens', 'being', 'forced', 'stand', 'up', 'wall', 'immediately', 'be', 'shot', 'are', 'really', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'me.Luckily', 'really', 'violent', 'brutally', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'Vietnam', 'back', 'early', '70', 'only', 'up', 'very', 'small', 'portion', 'actual', 'storyline', 'movie', 'mostly', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'role', 'comedian.Now', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'routine', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry-', 'not', 'nearly', 'crude', 'film', 'comedy', 'acts', 'stage', ""'d"", 'say', '80', '%', 'jokes', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'are', 'clean', 'completely', 'appropriate', 'entire', 'viewing', 'audience', '20', '%', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'sum', 'up-', 'film', 'mostly', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'just', 'being', 'typically', 'goofy', 'self.A', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'drama', 'comedy', 'elements', 'however', 'dislike', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'style', 'humor', 'probably', 'best', 'steer', 'clear', 'one']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

351552,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6303027016,Brian E. Erland,"[41, 46]","Many have tried to dismiss this film as nothing more than a comedic vehicle for Robin Williams. The concept of making light of the horrors of war, particularily Vietnam since it's still so recent in the minds of many turns alot of viewers off to the important potential lessons to be learned in this wonderfully insightful movie.Based on the true life accounts of Air Force officer and D.J. Adrian Cronauer we get a birds' eye view into the strict and ridiculous bureaucracy that can at times reign over military policy and in effect hamper the morale and efforts of the American military.Cronauer provided a much needed spontaneity to the air waves of Vietnam radio and brought however briefly to the American soldiers the contemporary music they wanted to hear. There is alot to laugh at in this film, what else could you expect with the likes of Robin Williams in the lead role. However there is much more going on than what first meets the eye. The concepts of acceptance, friendship, trust and love soon become entangled into the comedic elements which lead to the sad and poignant realization that cultural differences can't always be overcome by good intentions. A bittersweet truth so poignantly conveyed by the beautiful Trinh when rebuffing the romantic advances of Cronauer with the statement, ""Vietnam ladies not friends.""This film will definitely make you laugh. It will also make you cry and even more importantly make you think. In the final analysis that's what it's all about.

351558,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,6303027016,Cubist,"[2, 2]","Good Morning Vietnam is one of Robin Williams' earliest forays into drama. While The World According to Garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama, Good Morning maintains a much better balance. The first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in Saigon.Mitch Markowitz's screenplay makes a smooth transition between these two halves by doing it gradually with elements of comedy and drama blending together naturally so that neither one is entirely abandoned in favour of the other.Director Barry Levinson successfully harnessed the comedian's wild, manic energy in this movie. Of course, the Williams' radio monologues (famously adlibbed by the comedian) are the highlights as he cuts loose with his trademark rapid-fire humour (""What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts? Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery.""). Williams is an actor who needs a strong director to rein him in. His best movies are the ones where he collaborated with a director who had their own distinctive vision (Peter Weir, Terry Gilliam and Gus Van Sant) and this one is no different.Even though Good Morning is essentially a vehicle for Williams, Levinson wisely surrounds him with a strong supporting cast of character actors, like Robert Wuhl, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh.Along with Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth, Good Morning Vietnam gives a human dimension to the Vietnamese people. Unlike many other Vietnam War movies of the `80s, the Vietnamese are not portrayed as some anonymous enemy but real people with their own distinctive personalities.This incarnation is an improvement over the previous DVD. There is a six part ""Production Diary"" that runs 34 minutes. This is a retrospective look back at how the film came together and just how much of it is based on the real Adrian Cronauer who is interviewed. He sets the record straight and even talks about the origins of his famous sign-on (and the film's title). Director Barry Levinson talks about Robin Williams' extensive improvisations and how the director knew when to let him go and when he had to stick to the script. One part also focuses on the film's fantastic soundtrack of `60s rock `n' roll music and the role it played in the movie. Another segment focuses on the actual shoot that took place in Thailand and the logistical nightmare of filming there. Add to that the extremely hot weather which, incidentally, gave the film a certain amount of authenticity. There are lots of good anecdotes told but sadly, only cast members Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl are back with Williams no where to be found.""Raw Monologues"" features 13 minutes of footage from Williams' radio monologues that was not used or alternate takes of some of the jokes. There is some pretty funny material here but it is fascinating to see this material in rough form, watching how Williams would refine it by dropping some bits and keeping others with slight variations.Finally, there is the original teaser and theatrical trailers.",5,"""Rockin' from the Delta to the DMZ!""",1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,3163,"['Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'one', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'earliest', 'forays', 'drama', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', 'arguably', 'first', 'attempt', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'blend', 'comedic', 'sensibilities', 'drama', 'Good', 'Morning', 'much', 'better', 'balance', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'anarchic', 'anti-authoritarian', 'comedy', 'second', 'half', 'comedy', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'favour', 'unrequited', 'romance', 'growing', 'insurgency', 'Saigon.Mitch', 'Markowitz', 'screenplay', 'smooth', 'transition', 'two', 'halves', 'doing', 'gradually', 'elements', 'comedy', 'drama', 'blending', 'together', 'naturally', 'so', 'one', 'entirely', 'abandoned', 'favour', 'other.Director', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'successfully', 'harnessed', 'comedian', 'wild', 'manic', 'energy', 'movie', 'course', 'Williams', 'radio', 'monologues', 'famously', 'adlibbed', 'comedian', 'are', 'highlights', 'loose', 'trademark', 'rapid-fire', 'humour', 'What', 'difference', 'Army', 'Cub', 'Scouts', 'Cub', 'Scouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'heavy', 'artillery.', 'Williams', 'actor', 'who', 'strong', 'director', 'rein', 'best', 'movies', 'are', 'ones', 'where', 'collaborated', 'director', 'who', 'had', 'own', 'distinctive', 'vision', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'one', 'different.Even', 'though', 'Good', 'Morning', 'essentially', 'vehicle', 'Williams', 'Levinson', 'wisely', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'character', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Wuhl', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'J.T', 'Walsh.Along', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'human', 'dimension', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'many', 'other', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'movies', '80s', 'Vietnamese', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'anonymous', 'enemy', 'real', 'people', 'own', 'distinctive', 'personalities.This', 'incarnation', 'improvement', 'previous', 'DVD', 'six', 'part', 'Production', 'Diary', '34', 'minutes', 'retrospective', 'look', 'back', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'based', 'real', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'who', 'interviewed', 'record', 'straight', 'even', 'talks', 'origins', 'famous', 'sign-on', 'film', 'title', 'Director', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'talks', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'extensive', 'improvisations', 'how', 'director', 'knew', 'when', 'let', 'go', 'when', 'had', 'stick', 'script', 'One', 'part', 'also', 'film', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', '60s', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'music', 'role', 'played', 'movie', 'segment', 'actual', 'shoot', 'took', 'place', 'Thailand', 'logistical', 'nightmare', 'filming', 'there', 'Add', 'extremely', 'hot', 'weather', 'incidentally', 'gave', 'film', 'certain', 'amount', 'authenticity', 'are', 'lots', 'good', 'anecdotes', 'told', 'sadly', 'only', 'cast', 'members', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'Robert', 'Wuhl', 'are', 'back', 'Williams', 'where', 'be', 'found', 'Raw', 'Monologues', '13', 'minutes', 'footage', 'Williams', 'radio', 'monologues', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'alternate', 'jokes', 'pretty', 'funny', 'material', 'here', 'fascinating', 'see', 'material', 'rough', 'form', 'watching', 'how', 'Williams', 'would', 'refine', 'dropping', 'bits', 'keeping', 'others', 'slight', 'variations.Finally', 'original', 'teaser', 'theatrical', 'trailers']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

Director Barry Levinson ('Rain Man') was at the top of his game, and it has the FEEL of Vietnam.

351569,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,6303027016,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[9, 11]","It has been some time since I watched 1987's Good Morning, Vietnam, so while a lot of it was so memorable I recognized it immediately, some things were a bit of a revelation, especially as a metaphor for today's American military presence in the Middle East.Sure, you can make the obvious case for this to be a Hollywood anti-war movie, pure and simple, and it is at first glance. Surely making its points with individuals rather than troops is a powerful way to illustrate the effect of war on people rather than faceless masses. But Good Morning Vietnam is also a story about a relentless clash between front line creative powderkegs and front office administrators. It's also about how creative work reaches out to a lot of people that you may never meet, but to whom your work makes a difference, however big or small.More than anything, the movie is a perfect vehicle for Robin Williams, whose now-iconic stream-of-consciousness comedy is given full throttle as he goes on the air in a highly fictionalized portrayal of radio personality Adrian Cronauer. Taken out of the context of the late 20th century, when Williams was still breaking into movies and out of his ""Mork"" image, this performance takes on a greater depth than ever. He may appear to basically be playing himself, or at least his persona, but there's a whole lot more to it than just riffing when the cameras roll. As a matter of fact, if you watch the ""monologues"" presented in the bonus features (which are the same on this new Blu-ray as they were on the 2006 DVD edition, alas, with no commentary), you can see that he honed those routines over and over until they were as perfect as possible.It's no secret that this film does not tell the true story of Cronauer beyond his position of disc jockey in Vietnam and part time English teacher. What's also clear, especially watching it today, is that it also presents a view of 1965 through the prism of 1987 tastes and sensabilities.When William's character and an audience of Vitemanese viilagers sits in a dumpy, fan-cooled movie theatet to watch Beach Blanket Bingo, the complete irony is crystal clear as Frankie and Annette cavort in what is perhaps the penultimate beach movie. The movie seems out of place in that theater, but also in the pop culture context of 1987 and today. Actually, Beach Blanket Bingo was a new movie in 1965 and such goofy but popular films were huge hits, not the anamoly that it seems as presented in this context.Musically, it's the same way. The Beatles were a sensation, but they had only just become such over one year. Mainstream popular radio was playing Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin as well as The Supremes and the Beach Boys. In the accompanying documentary featurette, it is pointed out the Louis Armstrong's classic, ""Wonderful World"" (which became even more of a legendary song since the film's debut) was released after Good Morning Vietnam took place, but of course it served the story so well, it doesn't matter.And I'm not nit-picking for anachronisms. My point is that, in 1987 as in today, some are not aware that AM radio was so diverse. The film is peppered with putdowns of Percy Faith and Mantovani, but I'll bet the real Cronauer played Faith's ""Theme from A Summer Place."" The sensabilities and realities of what made popular music of the mid-sixties was filtered through what became ""classic rock"" programming by the late eighties -- and what would sell on a soundtrack album.Robin Williams is superb and is given fantastic support by a truly great team of actors, particularly Forrest Whitaker, Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl. Even the small roles are memorable -- and the faces of the local people and the soldiers are especially indelible.",5,"GOOOOOOOOD MORNING, BLU-RAAAAY!!!",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,3720,"['been', 'time', 'watched', '1987', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'so', 'lot', 'was', 'so', 'memorable', 'recognized', 'immediately', 'things', 'were', 'bit', 'revelation', 'especially', 'metaphor', 'today', 'American', 'military', 'presence', 'Middle', 'East.Sure', 'can', 'make', 'obvious', 'case', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'anti-war', 'movie', 'pure', 'simple', 'first', 'glance', 'Surely', 'making', 'points', 'individuals', 'rather', 'troops', 'powerful', 'way', 'illustrate', 'effect', 'war', 'people', 'rather', 'faceless', 'masses', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'also', 'story', 'relentless', 'clash', 'front', 'line', 'creative', 'powderkegs', 'front', 'office', 'administrators', 'also', 'how', 'creative', 'work', 'out', 'lot', 'people', 'may', 'never', 'meet', 'whom', 'work', 'difference', 'however', 'big', 'small.More', 'anything', 'movie', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'now-iconic', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'comedy', 'given', 'full', 'throttle', 'air', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'portrayal', 'radio', 'personality', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'Taken', 'context', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'when', 'Williams', 'was', 'still', 'breaking', 'movies', 'Mork', 'image', 'performance', 'greater', 'depth', 'ever', 'may', 'appear', 'basically', 'be', 'playing', 'least', 'persona', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'riffing', 'when', 'cameras', 'roll', 'matter', 'fact', 'watch', 'monologues', 'presented', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'same', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'were', '2006', 'DVD', 'edition', 'alas', 'commentary', 'can', 'see', 'honed', 'routines', 'were', 'as', 'perfect', 'possible.It', 'secret', 'film', 'not', 'tell', 'true', 'story', 'Cronauer', 'position', 'disc', 'jockey', 'Vietnam', 'part', 'time', 'English', 'teacher', 'What', 'also', 'clear', 'especially', 'watching', 'today', 'also', 'view', '1965', 'prism', '1987', 'tastes', 'sensabilities.When', 'William', 'character', 'audience', 'Vitemanese', 'viilagers', 'sits', 'dumpy', 'fan-cooled', 'movie', 'theatet', 'watch', 'Beach', 'Blanket', 'Bingo', 'complete', 'irony', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Frankie', 'Annette', 'cavort', 'what', 'perhaps', 'penultimate', 'beach', 'movie', 'movie', 'place', 'theater', 'also', 'pop', 'culture', 'context', '1987', 'today', 'Actually', 'Beach', 'Blanket', 'Bingo', 'was', 'new', 'movie', '1965', 'such', 'goofy', 'popular', 'films', 'were', 'huge', 'hits', 'not', 'anamoly', 'presented', 'context.Musically', 'same', 'way', 'Beatles', 'were', 'sensation', 'had', 'only', 'just', 'become', 'such', 'one', 'year', 'Mainstream', 'popular', 'radio', 'was', 'playing', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'as', 'well', 'Supremes', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'accompanying', 'documentary', 'featurette', 'pointed', 'out', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'classic', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'legendary', 'song', 'film', 'debut', 'was', 'released', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'took', 'place', 'course', 'served', 'story', 'so', 'well', ""n't"", 'matter.And', ""'m"", 'not', 'nit-picking', 'anachronisms', 'point', '1987', 'today', 'are', 'not', 'aware', 'AM', 'radio', 'was', 'so', 'diverse', 'film', 'peppered', 'putdowns', 'Percy', 'Faith', 'Mantovani', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'real', 'Cronauer', 'played', 'Faith', 'Theme', 'A', 'Summer', 'Place', 'sensabilities', 'realities', 'what', 'made', 'popular', 'music', 'mid-sixties', 'was', 'filtered', 'what', 'became', 'classic', 'rock', 'programming', 'late', 'eighties', 'what', 'would', 'sell', 'soundtrack', 'album.Robin', 'Williams', 'superb', 'given', 'fantastic', 'support', 'truly', 'great', 'team', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'Robert', 'Wuhl', 'Even', 'small', 'roles', 'are', 'memorable', 'local', 'people', 'soldiers', 'are', 'especially', 'indelible']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

The denunciation of the censorship that existed in the US forces in Vietnam, is still efficient, but it deals with the past. The Vietnam War is finished. The humor about the ex-Vice-Pr&eacute;sident Nixon, is of course a lot less efficient today, because a lot of time has gone by. The vision of the war is still very mild, though it emphasizes, still, the fact that the Viet Congs were everywhere, and it states in a very few sentences the real motivations of these young people who joined the fight against the Americans : personal, victims all around them, and the fact that they were at home, and the Americans were not.But the film has taken, since its first release, a completely new meaning, more allegoric but also tremendously strong. This time it has do only with the functioning of an institution, no matter which, that has to respect some norms coming from above and not from its audience, its public. It has to do with censorship and the desire and tendency of some people to refuse it in the name of the good old freedom of expression and of the press. Just this point, repeated quite many times, shows how strong such a functioning is. But the film delves into the human relations that come along with this general functioning. Those who detain authority in this institution feel frustrated by those who rebel against the censorship they try to impose. And it reveals that the former will try to do anything they can do get rid of the troublemaker : they will send him on an impossible and death-ridden mission, hoping he will be killed ; then they will build up a file trying to show that he is a traitor and has to be courtmartialed, and then they will condescendently move him out of the way with a nice speech on generosity, clemency and even compassion. This denunciation of this terroristic functioning of any institution, public or private, is still valid and full of relevence. On that level the film has not aged one single iota.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",5,Institutional dependence,987638400,"04 19, 2001",2001,2064,"['rather', 'old', 'film', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'aged', 'denunciation', 'censorship', 'existed', 'US', 'forces', 'Vietnam', 'still', 'efficient', 'past', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'finished', 'humor', 'ex-Vice-Pr', 'eacute', 'sident', 'Nixon', 'course', 'lot', 'less', 'efficient', 'today', 'lot', 'time', 'gone', 'vision', 'war', 'still', 'very', 'mild', 'still', 'fact', 'Viet', 'Congs', 'were', 'everywhere', 'very', 'few', 'sentences', 'real', 'motivations', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'joined', 'fight', 'Americans', 'personal', 'victims', 'fact', 'were', 'home', 'Americans', 'were', 'not.But', 'film', 'taken', 'first', 'release', 'completely', 'new', 'meaning', 'more', 'allegoric', 'also', 'tremendously', 'strong', 'time', 'do', 'only', 'functioning', 'institution', 'matter', 'respect', 'norms', 'coming', 'not', 'audience', 'public', 'do', 'censorship', 'desire', 'tendency', 'people', 'refuse', 'name', 'good', 'old', 'freedom', 'expression', 'press', 'Just', 'point', 'repeated', 'quite', 'many', 'times', 'how', 'strong', 'such', 'functioning', 'film', 'human', 'relations', 'come', 'along', 'general', 'functioning', 'who', 'detain', 'authority', 'institution', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'who', 'rebel', 'censorship', 'try', 'impose', 'former', 'will', 'try', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'do', 'get', 'rid', 'troublemaker', 'will', 'send', 'impossible', 'death-ridden', 'mission', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'then', 'will', 'build', 'up', 'file', 'trying', 'show', 'traitor', 'be', 'courtmartialed', 'then', 'will', 'condescendently', 'move', 'way', 'nice', 'speech', 'generosity', 'clemency', 'even', 'compassion', 'denunciation', 'terroristic', 'functioning', 'institution', 'public', 'private', 'still', 'valid', 'full', 'relevence', 'film', 'not', 'aged', 'one', 'single', 'iota.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'Paris', 'Universities', 'II', 'IX']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

I'm not normally one for war movies, but Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors and I've heard some good things about this movie.Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, a new Disk Jockey that is shipped to Vietnam to help bring humor to the Armed Forces stationed over there, during the Vietnam War.  He becomes extremely popular with the soldiers, but almost immediately is seen as a problem by the officers.  This upbeat, funny guy starts to change as he experiences the horrors of the Vietnam War, up close and personal.The first part of the movie was an excellent chance for Williams's stand-up to shine.

Asia is escalating.It is 1965 and the USA is sending more and more troops to S. Vietnam in an effort to live up to its commitments and treaty obligations (SEATO), and turn the tide against communism.  The US Army, worried about the G.I.s' morale, flies in Airman Cronauer from Europe to be a radio deejay and entertain the troops.  Things get a bit more complicated when he begins going around the censors by playing Rock and Roll and giving the news as it is...The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

351598,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6303027016,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 1]","Starring Robin Williams as Airman 1st Class Adrian Cronauer, this 1987 film is loosely based on a real radio DJ whose outrageous sense of comedy bucked authority and won the hearts of the American soldiers in 1965 Vietnam.  The audience never learns much about Cronauer's character as there is virtually no back story.  He is just set down in Vietnam at a time in history when the American police action is about to escalate. When he gets to know the Vietnamese villagers, however, his character slowly changes.  Of course there is conflict with his very uptight superiors which adds to the comedy.  Eventually though, the story becomes more complex than the comedy and, at film's end, Cronauer has become more mature and wiser.I found myself giggling at the jokes, but eventually the comedy all had a certain sameness.  However, I did get into the story.  There wasn't much military action, only some strong hints of what was to come.  Wisely, the film focused on the characters and portrays the Vietnamese villagers as real people who Cronauer teaches to curse in American slang and with whom he plays baseball, using mangos as the ball.  This is a good video, lighthearted and yet with a message.  Robin Williams' performance is excellent.  And, although some of the action was a little too slow for my taste and the comedy ran thin early, I still do give it a good recommendation.",4,He bucked authority and won the hearts of the soldiers,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,1384,"['Starring', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Airman', '1st', 'Class', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', '1987', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'real', 'radio', 'DJ', 'outrageous', 'sense', 'comedy', 'bucked', 'authority', 'won', 'hearts', 'American', 'soldiers', '1965', 'Vietnam', 'audience', 'never', 'much', 'Cronauer', 'character', 'virtually', 'back', 'story', 'just', 'set', 'down', 'Vietnam', 'time', 'history', 'when', 'American', 'police', 'action', 'escalate', 'When', 'know', 'Vietnamese', 'villagers', 'however', 'character', 'slowly', 'changes', 'course', 'conflict', 'very', 'uptight', 'superiors', 'comedy', 'Eventually', 'story', 'more', 'complex', 'comedy', 'film', 'end', 'Cronauer', 'become', 'more', 'mature', 'wiser.I', 'found', 'giggling', 'jokes', 'eventually', 'comedy', 'had', 'certain', 'sameness', 'However', 'did', 'get', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'military', 'action', 'only', 'strong', 'hints', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'Wisely', 'film', 'focused', 'characters', 'Vietnamese', 'villagers', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'Cronauer', 'teaches', 'curse', 'American', 'slang', 'whom', 'baseball', 'using', 'mangos', 'ball', 'good', 'video', 'lighthearted', 'yet', 'message', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'performance', 'excellent', 'action', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'taste', 'comedy', 'ran', 'thin', 'early', 'still', 'do', 'give', 'good', 'recommendation']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

351601,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,6303027016,Mark Turner,"[3, 6]","It's been 25 years since Robin Williams starred in GOOD MORNING VIETNAM just being released on blu-ray. The movie was based on the life of Adrian Cronauer, an Air Force officer who changed the way the military ran radio during the Vietnam War. At least that's what I think most of us thought the movie was about. But it turns out to be more about a comedian run wild in a starring role than about what happened in Vietnam.Williams stars as Cronauer, in this case an officer hand picked by Gen. Taylor (Noble Willingham) to bring his humor to the approved radio station the military runs for the troops. To date that station has had flat sounding DJs who play nothing more exciting than a polka. Cronauer changes that by playing rock and roll, the music that most of the soldier in the field listened to before they were brought to this country.This runs counter to the man in charge, Sgt. Major Dickinson (J.T.Walsh) and his right hand man Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby). They see no problems with the way things have been and so take offense to the new guy. But with the General backing him, Cronauer's personality runs wild on the air and he breathes fresh air into the style and content of the show he does. It also infects the other on air talent and makes them step up their game as well.As he gets used to his new situation Cronauer is aided by Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker). Garlick advises him of the way things are run, how to get around things on occasion and introduces him to the locals, the females of which are of particular interest to Cronauer. One in particular strikes his fancy and in an attempt to woo her, he takes over a class being taught to the locals on how to speak English. This leads to his meeting the young woman's brother and her family.The back and forth between enlisted talent and military officials continues. Cronauer has little or no idea of what is actually happening or how popular he's become. But he gets a wake up call when the local bar is bombed by members of the Vietcong. He sees the devastation and realizes that there is a war going on. This change in observation affects Cronauer in such a way that he reads a news brief uncensored for once on the air causing another major rift with the powers that be.The movie presented to us shows a man who took matters into his own hands and stood for what he believed. It also shows a spastic comedic presence on the air that eventually saw the good he was doing. But the fact is that when you take the time to watch the extras included on this disc you realize the whole character of Adrian Cronauer is less Adrian and more Robin Williams and that's always been one of my biggest problems when watching Williams act.Catch phrases and bits and pieces of his stand up routines always find a way into the roles he plays unless he has a director that takes hold of him and actually directs his talent which he has in abundance. But left unchecked and unharnessed Williams spastic interpretations of characters seem less like a person being portrayed and more like, well Williams performing as a comedian. Suddenly the story of Adrian Cronauer (though one would assume he was well paid for his story) is less what this is about and more about Williams being himself.In those extras director Barry Levinson says that the amount of time showing Williams on air antics amounts to less than 14 minutes. But those 14 minutes are the most alive in the film and were used in the advertising campaigns when the film came out to the point where that's the parts you remember. But there are many other times in the film that it feels more Robin and less Adrian.This was the first time I'd watched this film since seeing it 25 years ago. While it is still an enjoyable film it continues to grate on me that it seems more stand up than biopic. Williams has the ability to be a dynamic actor. To this day I felt that he deserved an Oscar for his performance in THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. But when he's turned lose and allowed to use his stand up in a role that doesn't need it, it distracts rather than enhances. The movie is worth watching to see a developing talent and an interesting story but I for one would have liked to see something more about the real Adrian Cronauer and less about Robin Williams.",3,EGO RUN WILD,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4276,"['been', '25', 'years', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'starred', 'GOOD', 'MORNING', 'VIETNAM', 'just', 'being', 'released', 'blu-ray', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'life', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'Air', 'Force', 'officer', 'who', 'changed', 'way', 'military', 'ran', 'radio', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'least', 'what', 'think', 'most', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'comedian', 'run', 'wild', 'starring', 'role', 'what', 'happened', 'Vietnam.Williams', 'stars', 'Cronauer', 'case', 'officer', 'hand', 'picked', 'Gen.', 'Taylor', 'Noble', 'Willingham', 'bring', 'humor', 'approved', 'radio', 'station', 'military', 'runs', 'troops', 'date', 'station', 'had', 'flat', 'sounding', 'DJs', 'who', 'play', 'nothing', 'more', 'exciting', 'polka', 'Cronauer', 'changes', 'playing', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'most', 'soldier', 'field', 'listened', 'were', 'brought', 'country.This', 'counter', 'man', 'charge', 'Sgt', 'Major', 'Dickinson', 'J.T.Walsh', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Lt.', 'Hauk', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'see', 'problems', 'way', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'take', 'offense', 'new', 'guy', 'General', 'backing', 'Cronauer', 'personality', 'wild', 'air', 'fresh', 'air', 'style', 'content', 'show', 'also', 'other', 'air', 'talent', 'step', 'up', 'game', 'well.As', 'used', 'new', 'situation', 'Cronauer', 'aided', 'Edward', 'Garlick', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Garlick', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'run', 'how', 'get', 'around', 'things', 'occasion', 'locals', 'females', 'are', 'particular', 'interest', 'Cronauer', 'One', 'particular', 'strikes', 'fancy', 'attempt', 'woo', 'class', 'being', 'taught', 'locals', 'how', 'speak', 'English', 'meeting', 'young', 'woman', 'brother', 'family.The', 'back', 'forth', 'enlisted', 'talent', 'military', 'officials', 'Cronauer', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'how', 'popular', 'become', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'when', 'local', 'bar', 'bombed', 'members', 'Vietcong', 'devastation', 'war', 'going', 'change', 'observation', 'affects', 'Cronauer', 'such', 'way', 'news', 'brief', 'uncensored', 'once', 'air', 'causing', 'major', 'rift', 'powers', 'be.The', 'movie', 'presented', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'stood', 'what', 'believed', 'also', 'spastic', 'comedic', 'presence', 'air', 'eventually', 'saw', 'good', 'was', 'doing', 'fact', 'when', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'extras', 'included', 'disc', 'realize', 'whole', 'character', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'less', 'Adrian', 'more', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'when', 'watching', 'Williams', 'act.Catch', 'phrases', 'bits', 'pieces', 'stand', 'up', 'routines', 'always', 'find', 'way', 'roles', 'director', 'hold', 'actually', 'talent', 'abundance', 'left', 'unchecked', 'unharnessed', 'Williams', 'spastic', 'interpretations', 'characters', 'seem', 'less', 'person', 'being', 'portrayed', 'more', 'well', 'Williams', 'performing', 'comedian', 'Suddenly', 'story', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'was', 'well', 'paid', 'story', 'less', 'what', 'about', 'more', 'Williams', 'being', 'extras', 'director', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'amount', 'time', 'showing', 'Williams', 'air', 'antics', 'amounts', 'less', '14', 'minutes', '14', 'minutes', 'are', 'most', 'alive', 'film', 'were', 'used', 'advertising', 'campaigns', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'point', 'where', 'parts', 'remember', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'times', 'film', 'more', 'Robin', 'less', 'Adrian.This', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'watched', 'film', 'seeing', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'grate', 'more', 'stand', 'up', 'biopic', 'Williams', 'ability', 'be', 'dynamic', 'actor', 'day', 'felt', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'ACCORDING', 'TO', 'GARP', 'when', 'turned', 'lose', 'allowed', 'use', 'stand', 'up', 'role', ""n't"", 'need', 'rather', 'enhances', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'developing', 'talent', 'interesting', 'story', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'something', 'more', 'real', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'less', 'Robin', 'Williams']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

351609,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,6303027016,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","Robin Williams won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Adrian Cronauer, a real life airman who spent a brief tour in Saigon as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Network.  Hoping to boost morale for an ever escalating war, military brass brought in Cronauer in 1965 to do 2 radio shows daily.  Known for his wit and innovative style, Cronauer was also a bit unusual and irreverent  as depicted in the film.Williams shows both sides of his acting ability.  He is at the top of his game when he is on the air or in front of the men.  His fast paced monologues are filled with bawdy humor, insults and celebrity mimicking followed by rock and roll music.  This upsets his superiors, specifically Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh) who want a monotone delivery of censored world news followed by music by the likes of Lawrence Welk or Percy Faith, the princes of elevator music.Cronauer is eventually suspended when he reads an unauthorized news bulletin involving a terrorist attack on a bar where he was moments before and that American servicemen frequented.  Williams shows his dramatic skills as well when he pursues a young Vietnamese woman who resists his charms.  He becomes friends with her brother when he volunteers to teach an English class to the locals.  Instead of ""see Jane run"" style of learning Cronauer teaches them American slang and expletives.  It's hilarious and nearly as funny as when he's ranting on the air.  When Cronauer opens his show with a loud drawn out, gooood morning, vietnaaaam we know it's time to buckle up and enjoy the show.  This is Robin Williams at his best.Neither the 1.85:1 Blu ray picture or the DTS HD Master Audio sound will likely put this movie on anyones demo list, but there is nothing objectionable either.  The video is clear and crisp.  The audio is limited by the audio designs of the era, so don't expect much wow from the surrounds or sub.Special features include a production diary (35 min.), some raw footage of Robin William on a roll, and trailers, all in standard def.",4,Robin Williams at his best in a Vietnam War Dramedy,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,2079,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'real', 'life', 'airman', 'who', 'spent', 'brief', 'tour', 'Saigon', 'DJ', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'Radio', 'Network', 'Hoping', 'boost', 'morale', 'ever', 'escalating', 'war', 'military', 'brass', 'brought', 'Cronauer', '1965', 'do', '2', 'radio', 'shows', 'daily', 'Known', 'wit', 'innovative', 'style', 'Cronauer', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'unusual', 'irreverent', 'depicted', 'film.Williams', 'sides', 'acting', 'ability', 'top', 'game', 'when', 'air', 'front', 'men', 'fast', 'paced', 'monologues', 'are', 'filled', 'bawdy', 'humor', 'insults', 'celebrity', 'mimicking', 'followed', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'superiors', 'specifically', 'Lt.', 'Hauk', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'Sgt', 'Major', 'Dickerson', 'J.', 'T.', 'Walsh', 'who', 'want', 'monotone', 'delivery', 'censored', 'world', 'news', 'followed', 'music', 'likes', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'Percy', 'Faith', 'princes', 'elevator', 'music.Cronauer', 'eventually', 'suspended', 'when', 'unauthorized', 'news', 'bulletin', 'involving', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'bar', 'where', 'was', 'moments', 'American', 'servicemen', 'frequented', 'Williams', 'dramatic', 'skills', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'woman', 'who', 'charms', 'friends', 'brother', 'when', 'teach', 'English', 'class', 'locals', 'Instead', 'see', 'Jane', 'run', 'style', 'learning', 'Cronauer', 'American', 'slang', 'expletives', 'hilarious', 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'when', 'ranting', 'air', 'When', 'Cronauer', 'show', 'loud', 'drawn', 'gooood', 'morning', 'vietnaaaam', 'know', 'time', 'buckle', 'up', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'best.Neither', '1.85:1', 'Blu', 'ray', 'picture', 'DTS', 'HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'sound', 'will', 'likely', 'put', 'movie', 'anyones', 'demo', 'list', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'either', 'video', 'clear', 'crisp', 'audio', 'limited', 'audio', 'designs', 'era', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'wow', 'surrounds', 'sub.Special', 'features', 'include', 'production', 'diary', '35', 'min', 'raw', 'footage', 'Robin', 'William', 'roll', 'trailers', 'standard', 'def']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

351635,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6303027016,Themis-Athena,"[0, 0]","1965 was the year when, as a result of the Congressional Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, American military buildup in Vietnam began in earnest, and troop strength grew by a factor of no less than eight; from 23,000 at the beginning of the year to roughly 184,000 at the end.  1965 was also the year when a new AFN DJ arrived in Saigon, which over the course of that same year would transform itself from a sleepy French-Vietnamese colonial town into the nightmare it has since come to be in the memory of countless vets.The new DJ in question was Adrian Cronauer; fresh from an assignment in Greece.While the idea for a fictionalized account of his Vietnam experience was Cronauer's own, fueled by the popularity of ""M*A*S*H,"" the script for Barry Levinson's ""Good Morning Vietnam"" was ultimately penned by screenwriter Mitch Markowitz with only some input from Cronauer himself, who has since gone out of his way to underline the fictional nature of the account and stress that his true stance was not so much anti-military as ""anti-stupidity.""  Thus, the film has to be taken with a considerable grain of salt; both as far as the portrayal of 1960s' armed forces radio and as far as the movie's plot is concerned.  But that doesn't make it any less poignant; nor does it take away one iota of Robin Williams's performance as Cronauer:  Indeed, the role of an irreverent, unstoppable DJ seemed tailor-made for Williams, who had burst onto the scene with his inimitable brand of lightning-quick ad-libbing ten years earlier in ""Mork & Mindy"" - and of course, all of Cronauer's hilarious broadcasts in this movie are ad-libbed, too.The film follows Adrian Cronauer from his arrival in Saigon in the spring of 1965 to his forced departure about a half year later (although the real Cronauer in fact stayed for a year and was not forced out but left when his regular tour of duty was over).  While a comedy, and although not trying to be anywhere near the ""definitive"" take on Vietnam, it does take a close look at the year when the conflict escalated and, in particular, at the resulting toll on human relations.  Robin Williams earned his first of to date four well-deserved Academy Award nominations for this role (the others were for ""Dead Poets Society"" [1989], ""The Fisher King"" [1991] and ""Good Will Hunting"" [1997], the movie for which he finally scored on Oscar night).  And in his inimitable way he provides pointed comic relief not only over the microphone but also, and always with a unique ear for the situation's mood, whenever the script would otherwise threaten to veer off into melodrama; such as after his discovery that his Vietnamese friend Tuan is actually a Viet Cong fighter named Phan Duc To (""It's unbelievable.  Five months in Saigon, and my best friend turns out to be a V.C.  This will not look good on a resume!!""); and in scenes that would otherwise be burdened with a bit too much cliche and/or deliberately funny writing, such as the conference after Cronauer's first broadcast, where Bruno Kirby (Lieutenant Hauk) gets to deliver such gems as ""Don't say that the weather is the same all the time here, because it's not; in fact, it's two degrees cooler today than yesterday"" and ""I hate the fact that you people never salute me - I'm a lieutenant, and I would like salutes occasionally.  That's what being a higher rank is all about.""  Even if Kirby himself gets to make up for these a little later in the same scene with the comment ""We are not going to escalate [Vietnam into] a whole war so we can get a big name comedian"" (Bob Hope who, as the men have informed him, does not ""play police actions""), it takes Williams's/Cronauer's final weaving of the lieutenant's preferred abbreviations into a single sentence to truly put the finishing touch on the scene.Although ""Good Morning Vietnam"" is clearly first and foremost a star vehicle for Robin Williams, he is joined by an outstanding supporting cast, including inter alia, besides Bruno Kirby, Forest Whitaker as Cronauer's good-natured sidekick PFC Montesque Garlick, the ever-reliable J.T. Walsh as his second great nemesis, Sergeant Major Dickerson (whose stock character of a straight-laced white middle class guy would probably not have come off convincingly as a villain vis-a-vis anybody *but* Robin Williams) and, in particular, Tung Thanh Tran as Tuan and Chintara Sukapatana as his sister Trinh:  Her plea with Cronauer not (even) to seek her friendship, let alone more, because for her such an association with a man (particularly a foreigner) is culturally unacceptable, is one of the movie's most quietly powerful scenes.  Exceptional is further Peter Sova's cinematography, which convincingly captures the daily realities of a city and a country on the brink of an all-out war, and is brilliantly complimented by the editing, which in turn also uses the soundtrack - more or less a mid-1960s ""greatest hits"" compilation - to maximum effect; be it in framing daily military routine, the soldiers' enjoyment of Cronauer's style of broadcasting or combat action:  Indeed, hardly any image could make a more powerful statement on the cruel absurdity of war than seeing a village blown up to the tune of Louis Armstrong's ""It's a Wonderful World.""Thus, ""Good Morning Vietnam"" is in its own way as poignant a wakeup call as any other movie about Vietnam - or about World War II, or any other war for that matter.  It deservedly netted the Political Film Society's 1989 Peace Award, in addition to Robin Williams's Oscar nomination and his Golden Globe and American Comedy awards, as well as the movie's ASCAP soundtrack award.  And it certainly bears revisiting - for its overall quality, for Robin Williams's performance, and also for lessons learned and deserving never to be forgotten.Also recommended:M*A*S*H (Widescreen

351638,A1XBYZX09V1OB4,6303027016,Valerie J. Saturen,"[0, 0]","Good Morning, Vietnam stars Robin Williams in the type of role he plays best, as the hilarious, irreverent, and nonconformist military disc jockey Adrian Cronauer. Based (extremely) loosely on a true story, the movie takes place in 1965, where Cronauer injects life and humor into the hellish existence of GIs fighting the Vietnam War. To the enjoyment of the troops and the fury of his superiors, he fills the airwaves with rapid-fire hilarity, mocks Nixon, plays rock music, and defies the overzealous military censors with ""unofficial"" news reports. Williams' performance is brilliant, and as he would later demonstrate again with films like Dead Poets Society and Patch Adams, the role suits him perfectly.The movie is so effective because it combines humor with poignancy as Cronauer's spirited humanity clashes with the regimented military life, the horrors of war, and the dehumanizing effects of conflict. He forges relationships with the Vietnamese people he comes into contact with, but heartbreakingly comes up against the barriers of cultural differences and political divides.In one of the most unforgettable scenes, he dedicates Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" to one of the young GIs headed off to the nightmare of battle. With painful irony, the song mingles with images of the brutal reality of the war. In a sense, the scene encapsulates the discord between Cronauer's insistence on maintaining his humanity and the inhuman world that surrounds him.",5,Classic Williams,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1478,"['Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'type', 'role', 'best', 'hilarious', 'irreverent', 'nonconformist', 'military', 'disc', 'jockey', 'Adrian', 'Cronauer', 'Based', 'extremely', 'loosely', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'place', '1965', 'where', 'Cronauer', 'life', 'humor', 'hellish', 'existence', 'GIs', 'fighting', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'enjoyment', 'troops', 'fury', 'superiors', 'airwaves', 'rapid-fire', 'hilarity', 'mocks', 'Nixon', 'rock', 'music', 'overzealous', 'military', 'censors', 'unofficial', 'news', 'reports', 'Williams', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'would', 'later', 'demonstrate', 'again', 'films', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'role', 'suits', 'perfectly.The', 'movie', 'so', 'effective', 'humor', 'poignancy', 'Cronauer', 'spirited', 'humanity', 'clashes', 'regimented', 'military', 'life', 'horrors', 'war', 'dehumanizing', 'effects', 'conflict', 'relationships', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'contact', 'heartbreakingly', 'up', 'barriers', 'cultural', 'differences', 'political', 'divides.In', 'one', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'scenes', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'What', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'one', 'young', 'GIs', 'headed', 'off', 'nightmare', 'battle', 'painful', 'irony', 'song', 'mingles', 'images', 'brutal', 'reality', 'war', 'sense', 'scene', 'discord', 'Cronauer', 'insistence', 'maintaining', 'humanity', 'inhuman', 'world']",Good Morning Vietnam VHS

However, it goes into dark territory as the Williams' character experiences the horrors of war  and his time on-air becomes a little more serious than comedic. Also, Cronauer/Williams becomes involved with some of the local Vietnamese to give him a little dramatic licence. This slows down the story and almost wipes clean the comedy aspect of the film. All of a sudden, his superior who has it in for Cronauer and his radio show antics in the first place, Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) takes over the radio duties.
