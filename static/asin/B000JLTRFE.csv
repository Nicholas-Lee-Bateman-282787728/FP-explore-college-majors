More dead air.I believe in later seasons Dallas gets back on track somewhat, but never again will it match the quality of seasons 1-5.The sets are also INCREDIBLY cheap looking (and were even back then), and the women's costumes and hairstyles haven't held up as well as they have on rival series Dynasty and Falcon Crest.  (The Mercedes and Porsche cars used on the series, however, are just as nice looking today as they were then, and better looking than a lot of the ""aerodynamic"" design cars manufactured today.)Overall this is a season only the Dallas completist need bother with.  It's a chore to watch much of the time rather than a pleasure, and breaking up Bobby and Pam was a huge mistake that went on for years to follow.

1028261,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B000JLTRFE,Edward Aycock,"[3, 3]","Season Six of ""Dallas"" is a show at its peak.  Season Five faltered somewhat as the show tried to find its bearings after the death of Jim Davis (Jock) and a sober Sue Ellen was removed from most the main drama, speanding far too much time sitting around at a distant ranch.  But with Season Six, everything hits the fan;  I don't think I've had so much fun with the show as I did here.So much happens in this season that it's impossible to encapsulate but there are many interesting stories that develop over the course of the episodes.  This season is mainly known as the one when JR and Bobby fougth for control of the Ewing empire in the wake of Jock's death.  This entails all kinds of scheming; for JR, that's natural, but Bobby starts to lose his own soul in his pursuit of power.  Characters whom I didn't think much of at first - Lois Chiles' Holly Harlow is a bit of a dud at first - become more important by the finale.And then there are the final four episodes in which every storyline brilliantly comes together.  I am glad I didn't read many recaps beforehand because it would have given away what happens.  But wow - when things happen they happen BIG.  Plus, we get the added bonus of Sue Ellen going back to the bottle with the usual disastrous results.This is definitely one season to watch again.

Ciepiela ""oldmovielover""","[8, 8]","Dallas season 6(really season 5) is unbelievable.like some other seasons, the storylines and arcs in this season come fast and strong. I even liked this season more than season 3, which everyone seems to favor the most. But i think this is my favorite with the season before it maybe in 2nd place.The end of the previous season, everyone finds out Cliff Barnes attempted suicide partly because of being cheated by J.R.Miss Ellie tells him something to the effect of"" You are a cold and unfeeling man,J.R, and as soon as BObby gets back( from California with pam, investigating christophers birth),I will dismantle you as president of Ewing OIL"", and in this season opener, she does just that...Little does she know J.R, soon runs another oil business,Harwood Oil, via a pretty little thing named Holly Harwood, who at once becomes Jr's reluctant ally,and then rival. Holly plans her revenge,and has much to do with changing his and SueEllens life in a way that has reprecussions for the rest of the series.The previous seasons, you got glimpses that Pam and Bobbys marraige was headed for trouble.When Jocks will is read and announces the fight for Ewing oil, their marraige cannot survive the intense change in Bobby and the toll it takes.In some episodes Bobby is irritable and downright nasty!(around the time he and ray are following Walt Driscoll), and this is the first season Bobby resorts to J.R like tactics like blackmail, to get his way in the business world..also worth mentioning is the more prominent reintroduction ( she was introduced in a previous season as were many other characters)of Cliff and pams devious half sister Katherine Wentworth, and Prescilla Pointer as their mother, Rebecca respectively. Miss Ellie gets closer with Clayton....boring, and Cliff is an amazing actor,,,he really owns the scenes he is in and ended up as one of my favorite characters as the series progressed although i feel he was unlikeable in the early seasons.lastly, The Lucy/Mickey storyline just kills me.The writing and chemisty between is so soft, and feels so special, you almost forget you are watching two characters in a tv show...I dont want to give anything away, but they make him out to be the love of Lucys life, certainly much more of a connection than she ever had with Mitch.Their story arc culminates in a very important plot point ...Charlene Hilton(lucY) is another one that won me over this season, from the abortion storyline at the beginning of the season( she was really pregnant by the time they started shooting the season, which explains all the funny/clever ways they had her sitting down or standing behind something for the first few episodes), to the Mickey storyline, you could really see what a good actress she was, and her costar was very talented too.All the episodes are excellent, none are boring,like all dallas seasons, the last 4 or 5 episodes are especially juicy, and the season finale office confrontation between J.R and Pam is classic, I promise you will want to watch this season over and over.",5,"Bar none: one of the best seasons, if not THE best.",1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,3043,"['Dallas', 'season', '6', 'really', 'season', '5', 'unbelievable.like', 'other', 'seasons', 'storylines', 'arcs', 'season', 'come', 'fast', 'strong', 'even', 'liked', 'season', 'more', 'season', '3', 'everyone', 'favor', 'most', 'i', 'think', 'favorite', 'season', 'maybe', '2nd', 'place.The', 'end', 'previous', 'season', 'everyone', 'out', 'Cliff', 'Barnes', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'partly', 'being', 'cheated', 'J.R.Miss', 'Ellie', 'something', 'effect', 'are', 'cold', 'unfeeling', 'man', 'J.R', 'as', 'soon', 'BObby', 'back', 'California', 'pam', 'investigating', 'christophers', 'birth', 'will', 'dismantle', 'president', 'Ewing', 'OIL', 'season', 'opener', 'just', 'Little', 'know', 'J.R', 'soon', 'oil', 'business', 'Harwood', 'Oil', 'pretty', 'little', 'thing', 'named', 'Holly', 'Harwood', 'who', 'once', 'Jr', 'reluctant', 'ally', 'then', 'rival', 'Holly', 'revenge', 'much', 'do', 'changing', 'SueEllens', 'life', 'way', 'reprecussions', 'rest', 'series.The', 'previous', 'seasons', 'got', 'glimpses', 'Pam', 'Bobbys', 'marraige', 'was', 'headed', 'trouble.When', 'Jocks', 'will', 'read', 'fight', 'Ewing', 'oil', 'marraige', 'can', 'not', 'survive', 'intense', 'change', 'Bobby', 'toll', 'episodes', 'Bobby', 'irritable', 'downright', 'nasty', 'time', 'ray', 'are', 'following', 'Walt', 'Driscoll', 'first', 'season', 'Bobby', 'J.R', 'tactics', 'blackmail', 'get', 'way', 'business', 'world..also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'more', 'prominent', 'reintroduction', 'was', 'introduced', 'previous', 'season', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'Cliff', 'pams', 'devious', 'half', 'sister', 'Katherine', 'Wentworth', 'Prescilla', 'Pointer', 'mother', 'Rebecca', 'respectively', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'closer', 'Clayton', '.boring', 'Cliff', 'amazing', 'actor', 'really', 'scenes', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'series', 'progressed', 'i', 'feel', 'was', 'unlikeable', 'early', 'seasons.lastly', 'Lucy/Mickey', 'storyline', 'just', 'me.The', 'writing', 'chemisty', 'so', 'soft', 'feels', 'so', 'special', 'almost', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'two', 'characters', 'tv', 'show', 'dont', 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'make', 'be', 'love', 'Lucys', 'life', 'certainly', 'much', 'more', 'connection', 'ever', 'had', 'Mitch.Their', 'story', 'arc', 'culminates', 'very', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'Charlene', 'Hilton', 'lucY', 'one', 'won', 'season', 'abortion', 'storyline', 'beginning', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'pregnant', 'time', 'started', 'shooting', 'season', 'funny/clever', 'ways', 'had', 'sitting', 'down', 'standing', 'something', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Mickey', 'storyline', 'could', 'really', 'see', 'what', 'good', 'actress', 'was', 'costar', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'episodes', 'are', 'excellent', 'none', 'are', 'boring', 'dallas', 'seasons', 'last', '4', '5', 'episodes', 'are', 'especially', 'juicy', 'season', 'finale', 'office', 'confrontation', 'J.R', 'Pam', 'classic', 'promise', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'season']",Dallas: Season 6
1028264,A1NDYG7YCATPLD,B000JLTRFE,Gregory A. Moorehead,"[7, 7]","""Dallas"", in my opinion is the best television show of all time, and this season illustrates why it is so. The stories revolve around universal and timeless themes such as the love-hate relationships among family members; the internal and external battle over the use of power for good or evil; the struggle to restore trust to tattered relationships; coming to terms with the death of a loved-one; and the hurt, fear and healing subsequent to sexual abuse. ""Dallas"" was never better than it was this season, aside from season 10 (which I hope will soon be released) this was the last truly great season.  There has never been, and there never will be a show as thoroughly entertaining as ""Dallas"". Much of the success of this season can be attributed to the performances of the cast. Was there ever any other performer who possessed a character the way Larry Hagman did J.R.?  Was there ever a character you loved to hate as much as you did J.R. (and at times still found yourself rooting for him)? How Larry Hagman never won an Emmy is simply beyond comprehension. Linda Gray as Sue Ellen Ewing was nothing short of brilliant, and Barbara Bel Geddes (the only cast member to win an Emmy for her work on the show) repeatedly gave reserved, but incredibly powerful performances.

Every plot twist seems to work to perfection. The JR-Bobby fight for control of Ewing Oil takes center stage. JR, of course, is willing to do anything to win the company, including selling to an embargoed country, obtaining a controversial variance and creating dummy corporations. Bobby also shows somewhat of a dark side in the fight for Ewing Oil. He is willing to sacrifice his marriage and good-standing relationships to gain control of Ewing Oil. Even the subplots with Cliff and Lucy, who have both had their share of clunkers, work well. The mark of a great show is that when the closing credits appear, you cannot wait to see the next episode. With season 6, I don't think that there was one episode that did not leave me wanting more.

1028270,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B000JLTRFE,Kasey G,"[1, 1]","**NOTE - This review contains Spoilers**In Season Six of ""Dallas"", the family gathers for the reading of Jock's will and the terms pit Bobby and J.R. against one another in competition for Ewing Oil as the brother who turns the biggest profit in 12 months wins controlling interest. This is the main plot line running throughout these 28 episodes that originally aired during the 1982-83 TV season, when ""Dallas"" dipped to #2 in the ratings after two years at the top.The competition between the Ewing boys tears the family apart to the point that Miss Ellie goes as far as having Jock declared mentally incompetent to dispute the terms of the will. Pam moves out of Southfork and into a hotel with baby Christopher, and soon takes up with hunky and attentive Mark Grayson (John Beck). Conversely, Sue Ellen and J.R. become closer than ever and remarry. J.R. signs on as consultant for competitor Harwood Oil, at the request of inexperienced but devious and leggy heiress Holly Harwood (Lois Chiles). Holly soon regrets doing business with the snaky J.R. and tries to cause trouble by seducing him then reporting their ""affair"" to Sue Ellen. The escalating war for Ewing Oil also prompts J.R. to resort to illegal dealings with Cuba.Donna heads up a new Texas Energy Commission, which puts her at odds with J.R. Meanwhile, Ray brings his irresponsible cousin Mickey to stay with them, in hopes the kid will shape up. Mickey eventually begins dating Lucy, who having been impregnated by her shutterbug stalker last season, undergoes an abortion with only Pam being in on the secret. Tragedy strikes near the end of the season and Mickey ends up in a coma after a car crash in which a drunken Sue Ellen was behind the wheel.Miss Ellie gradually begins socializing as a widow and as the season progesses, she grows particularly close to Clayton Farlow (Howard Keel), to the consternation of J.R.After Cliff's suicide attempt in last season's finale, mother Rebecca (Priscilla Pointer) declares all-out war on the Ewings, causing friction between her and Pam. Rebecca uses her considerable wealth to buy an oil company and appoint son Cliff president. Unfortunately, a series of events leads to Rebecca's death after a plane crash mid-season. Afton (Audrey Landers) plays the ""good girl"" this season, faithfully standing by Cliff after his suicide attempt and Rebecca's death. Half-sister Katherine (Morgan Brittany) butts heads with Cliff over her father's company, and secretly tries to widen the rift between Bobby and Pam, so she can have him for herself.At season's end, Pam asks Bobby for a divorce, Sue Ellen is driven back to the bottle, and Southfork goes up in flames during a fight between J.R. and Ray, with John Ross and a drunk Sue Ellen asleep upstairs.This season dragged a little, as the contest plotline between J.R. and Bobby was not that exciting. Things pick up mid-season around the time of the plane crash and get better from there.The offices at Ewing Oil get a makeover and Bobby's secretary Phyllis (Deborah Tranelli) gets more screen time. While Sue Ellen's trendy mullet 'do didn't appeal to me, Pam looks absolutely ravishing this season, her hair slightly lightened to a flattering rusty brown. Patrick Duffy has beefed up some and Bobby's sporting a bulkier physique.My favorite scene this season occurs when J.R. pimps out Sue Ellen to help seal a business deal and acquire a badly-needed oil refinery. J.R. purposely shows up late so the client can have some ""quality time"" with Sue Ellen. When he arrives with the excuse that ""one of my oil well's caught fire"", Sue Ellen snaps back ""Did the telephones burn TOO?"". Her delivery is sharp, cutting and priceless.Visually, this is the best season yet as all the scenes look bright and crisp and new. The discs are again dual-sided and come in three plastic snapcases, just like the Season 5 set.Not the best season, but still engrossing TV from the '80s when prime time soaps ruled the airwaves..",4,"Starts Off Dull, But Heats Up Mid-Season",1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,3973,"['**NOTE', 'review', 'Spoilers**In', 'Season', 'Six', 'Dallas', 'family', 'gathers', 'reading', 'Jock', 'will', 'terms', 'pit', 'Bobby', 'J.R.', 'one', 'competition', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'brother', 'who', 'biggest', 'profit', '12', 'months', 'controlling', 'interest', 'main', 'plot', 'line', 'running', '28', 'episodes', 'originally', 'aired', '1982-83', 'TV', 'season', 'when', 'Dallas', 'dipped', '2', 'ratings', 'two', 'years', 'top.The', 'competition', 'Ewing', 'family', 'apart', 'point', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'as', 'far', 'having', 'Jock', 'declared', 'mentally', 'incompetent', 'dispute', 'terms', 'will', 'Pam', 'Southfork', 'hotel', 'baby', 'Christopher', 'soon', 'up', 'hunky', 'attentive', 'Mark', 'Grayson', 'John', 'Beck', 'Conversely', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'J.R.', 'become', 'closer', 'ever', 'remarry', 'J.R.', 'signs', 'consultant', 'competitor', 'Harwood', 'Oil', 'request', 'inexperienced', 'devious', 'leggy', 'heiress', 'Holly', 'Harwood', 'Lois', 'Chiles', 'Holly', 'soon', 'regrets', 'doing', 'business', 'snaky', 'J.R.', 'tries', 'cause', 'trouble', 'seducing', 'then', 'reporting', 'affair', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'escalating', 'war', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'also', 'J.R.', 'resort', 'illegal', 'dealings', 'Cuba.Donna', 'up', 'new', 'Texas', 'Energy', 'Commission', 'odds', 'J.R', 'Meanwhile', 'Ray', 'irresponsible', 'cousin', 'Mickey', 'stay', 'kid', 'will', 'shape', 'up', 'Mickey', 'eventually', 'dating', 'Lucy', 'who', 'having', 'been', 'impregnated', 'shutterbug', 'stalker', 'last', 'season', 'abortion', 'only', 'Pam', 'being', 'secret', 'Tragedy', 'strikes', 'end', 'season', 'Mickey', 'up', 'coma', 'car', 'crash', 'drunken', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'was', 'wheel.Miss', 'Ellie', 'gradually', 'socializing', 'widow', 'season', 'progesses', 'particularly', 'close', 'Clayton', 'Farlow', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'consternation', 'J.R.After', 'Cliff', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'last', 'season', 'finale', 'mother', 'Rebecca', 'Priscilla', 'Pointer', 'all-out', 'war', 'Ewings', 'causing', 'friction', 'Pam', 'Rebecca', 'considerable', 'wealth', 'buy', 'oil', 'company', 'appoint', 'son', 'Cliff', 'president', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'events', 'Rebecca', 'death', 'plane', 'crash', 'mid-season', 'Afton', 'Audrey', 'Landers', 'good', 'girl', 'season', 'faithfully', 'standing', 'Cliff', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Rebecca', 'death', 'Half-sister', 'Katherine', 'Morgan', 'Brittany', 'butts', 'heads', 'Cliff', 'father', 'company', 'secretly', 'tries', 'widen', 'rift', 'Bobby', 'Pam', 'can', 'have', 'herself.At', 'season', 'end', 'Pam', 'Bobby', 'divorce', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'driven', 'back', 'bottle', 'Southfork', 'up', 'flames', 'fight', 'J.R.', 'Ray', 'John', 'Ross', 'drunk', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'asleep', 'upstairs.This', 'season', 'dragged', 'little', 'contest', 'plotline', 'J.R.', 'Bobby', 'was', 'not', 'exciting', 'Things', 'pick', 'up', 'mid-season', 'time', 'plane', 'crash', 'get', 'better', 'there.The', 'offices', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'get', 'makeover', 'Bobby', 'secretary', 'Phyllis', 'Deborah', 'Tranelli', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'trendy', 'mullet', ""'do"", 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'Pam', 'absolutely', 'ravishing', 'season', 'hair', 'slightly', 'lightened', 'flattering', 'rusty', 'brown', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'beefed', 'up', 'Bobby', 'sporting', 'bulkier', 'physique.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'season', 'when', 'J.R.', 'out', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'help', 'seal', 'business', 'deal', 'acquire', 'badly-needed', 'oil', 'refinery', 'J.R.', 'purposely', 'up', 'late', 'client', 'can', 'have', 'quality', 'time', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'When', 'excuse', 'one', 'oil', 'well', 'caught', 'fire', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'back', 'Did', 'telephones', 'burn', 'TOO', 'delivery', 'sharp', 'cutting', 'priceless.Visually', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'scenes', 'look', 'bright', 'crisp', 'new', 'discs', 'are', 'again', 'dual-sided', 'come', 'three', 'plastic', 'snapcases', 'just', 'Season', '5', 'set.Not', 'best', 'season', 'still', 'engrossing', 'TV', ""'80s"", 'when', 'prime', 'time', 'soaps', 'ruled', 'airwaves..']",Dallas: Season 6

One of the most underestimated actresses is Audrey Landers. She does an excellent job playing Aston and proves to be a fine actress. Of course, what would Dallas be without J.R. doing his underhanded tricks. He is caught in the sack with his business partner Holly by Sue Ellen, which drives her back to the bottle and eventually into a horrible car accident. A sad note is the deteoriation of Bobby and Pam's marriage. A good note is the romance of Miss Ellie and Clayton Farlow. Highlights: Sue Ellen finding out that Dusty is not impotent and has remarried, Sue Ellen trying to go to bed with Clayton and Ray and Donna's relationship with Ray's family.

At that time, I liked SueEllen and JR.  As an adult, I only like Lucy and and some of the younger cast, oh the irony.  Anyway, the writers seem to have a hard time coming up with storylines for Lucy which I find odd since she is YOUNG, beautiful and smart.  The show made women seem stupid and useless on the show.  Yes, Donna, was smart and intelligent on the show but she was BORING.This season, JR and Bobby are fighting over Ewing Oil.  Even with 2-sided DVDs (that will not play in my laptop), there are like 6 discs for your viewing pleasure.  The business discussions are long and tedious and oftentimes complicated.  It is really not entertaining at all.  After SueEllen and JR get back together, SueEllen basically just sits around all dressed up and pretty.  Lucy is dating Ray's nephew after a kidnapping, rape, and abortion.Ms. Ellie is a pivotal character; she and Pam and Marilee Stone seem to be the only smart women on the show.As as adult, I didn't realize how old the characters were on the show.  Clayton, however, was viewed as too old for SueEllen.  I personally think SueEllen should have been matched with another guy.  As  an adult, I don't see JR and SueEllen as a good couple.Bobby is the best male character this season; getting down in the dirt with JR while still looking hot doing it.",4,A lot of business talk and the show doesn't feel powerful anymore.,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,1422,"['have', 'said', 'previous', 'reviews', 'started', 'watching', 'Dallas', 'kindergarten', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'time', 'liked', 'SueEllen', 'JR.', 'adult', 'only', 'Lucy', 'younger', 'cast', 'irony', 'Anyway', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'coming', 'up', 'storylines', 'Lucy', 'find', 'odd', 'YOUNG', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'show', 'made', 'women', 'seem', 'stupid', 'useless', 'show', 'Yes', 'Donna', 'was', 'smart', 'intelligent', 'show', 'was', 'BORING.This', 'season', 'JR', 'Bobby', 'are', 'fighting', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'Even', '2-sided', 'DVDs', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'laptop', 'are', '6', 'discs', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'business', 'discussions', 'are', 'long', 'tedious', 'oftentimes', 'complicated', 'really', 'not', 'entertaining', 'SueEllen', 'JR', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'SueEllen', 'basically', 'just', 'sits', 'dressed', 'up', 'pretty', 'Lucy', 'dating', 'Ray', 'nephew', 'kidnapping', 'rape', 'abortion.Ms', 'Ellie', 'pivotal', 'character', 'Pam', 'Marilee', 'Stone', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'smart', 'women', 'show.As', 'adult', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'old', 'characters', 'were', 'show', 'Clayton', 'however', 'was', 'viewed', 'too', 'old', 'SueEllen', 'personally', 'think', 'SueEllen', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'matched', 'guy', 'adult', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'JR', 'SueEllen', 'good', 'couple.Bobby', 'best', 'male', 'character', 'season', 'getting', 'down', 'dirt', 'JR', 'still', 'looking', 'hot', 'doing']",Dallas: Season 6

Garrard ""the G-man""","[6, 6]","Here comes another season of J.R.'s (Larry Hagman) double-dealing ways as he attempts, this time, to wrench control of Ewing Oil from his brother and his mother. The body count rises, literally and figuratively, as the dastardly anti-hero works his machinations for his ultimate ends.New characters are introduced that play important parts in the developing story line while other characters find themselves more embroiled in the ongoing saga of the Ewing clan.As far as the new are concerned, prominent among those are Holly Harwood (Lois Chiles) as a reluctant ally to J.R. She finds herself initially fascinated by the oil man but soon sees the real J.R. and eventually must decide where her allegiance lies.Mark Grayson (John Beck) becomes the ""third wheel"" in a love triangle that causes a rift in the seemingly unbreakable marriage of Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and Pam (Victoria Principal).Ray's cousin, Mickey (Timothy Patrick Murphy) becomes the love interest of Lucy but, unfortunately, meets tragedy at the hands of one of the victims of J.R.'s dirty deals.As far as the ""old,"" Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) continues her ""abused wife"" ways as she remarries J.R., knowing full well his track rate for ""faithfulness.""Ray (Steve Kanaly) and wife Donna (Susan Howard) have their own problems as she tries to balance marriage with an ever-rising political career.Afton (Audrey Landers) must contend with her love for Cliff (Ken Kercheval) and his obsession with bringing down the Ewings and his love for Sue Ellen.Lucy (Charlene Tilton) goes through divorce bangs and her burgeoning attraction to Mickey.Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes) contends with her feelings for her late husband and her determination to bring an end to the family squabbles. In addition to those, she starts to find herself attracted to another man.Besides the regulars, recurring characters get their moment to shine in this outstanding season as well. Punk Anderson (Morgan Woodard) stands out as a worthy successor to ""Jock"" as the one man that can really keep the Ewing boys in line. Besides that, he's one heckuva sharp dresser in his western-styled attire.Pam's mom, Rebecca (Priscilla Pointer), makes her presence known as she works hard to support both her daughter and son.Harv Smithfield (George O. Petrie) as the family lawyer must volley both sides of the fence as he must deal with his loyalty to the late Jock's wishes and his friendship with Miss Ellie.Watching the episodes back to back, one can see how the producers spent a bundle on clothing and locations. Also, the sets were more lavish than in previous seasons, with upgrades at both the Ewing home and the offices.Acting-wise, no one can top Hagman as the devilish J.R. His lack of an Emmy win is an unexplainable travesty in the history of television.",5,"Season FIVE, really: the year of Jock's will",1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,2792,"['Here', 'season', 'J.R.', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'double-dealing', 'ways', 'time', 'wrench', 'control', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'brother', 'mother', 'body', 'count', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'dastardly', 'anti-hero', 'machinations', 'ultimate', 'ends.New', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'play', 'important', 'parts', 'developing', 'story', 'line', 'other', 'characters', 'find', 'more', 'embroiled', 'ongoing', 'saga', 'Ewing', 'clan.As', 'far', 'new', 'are', 'concerned', 'prominent', 'are', 'Holly', 'Harwood', 'Lois', 'Chiles', 'reluctant', 'ally', 'J.R.', 'initially', 'fascinated', 'oil', 'man', 'soon', 'real', 'J.R.', 'eventually', 'must', 'decide', 'where', 'allegiance', 'lies.Mark', 'Grayson', 'John', 'Beck', 'third', 'wheel', 'love', 'triangle', 'rift', 'seemingly', 'unbreakable', 'marriage', 'Bobby', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'Pam', 'Victoria', 'Principal', '.Ray', 'cousin', 'Mickey', 'Timothy', 'Patrick', 'Murphy', 'love', 'interest', 'Lucy', 'unfortunately', 'meets', 'tragedy', 'hands', 'one', 'victims', 'J.R.', 'dirty', 'deals.As', 'far', 'old', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Linda', 'Gray', 'abused', 'wife', 'ways', 'J.R.', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'track', 'rate', 'faithfulness', 'Ray', 'Steve', 'Kanaly', 'wife', 'Donna', 'Susan', 'Howard', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'balance', 'marriage', 'ever-rising', 'political', 'career.Afton', 'Audrey', 'Landers', 'must', 'contend', 'love', 'Cliff', 'Ken', 'Kercheval', 'obsession', 'bringing', 'down', 'Ewings', 'love', 'Sue', 'Ellen.Lucy', 'Charlene', 'Tilton', 'divorce', 'bangs', 'burgeoning', 'attraction', 'Mickey.Miss', 'Ellie', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'feelings', 'late', 'husband', 'determination', 'bring', 'end', 'family', 'squabbles', 'addition', 'find', 'attracted', 'man.Besides', 'regulars', 'recurring', 'characters', 'get', 'moment', 'shine', 'outstanding', 'season', 'well', 'Punk', 'Anderson', 'Morgan', 'Woodard', 'out', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Jock', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'really', 'keep', 'Ewing', 'boys', 'line', 'one', 'heckuva', 'sharp', 'dresser', 'western-styled', 'attire.Pam', 'mom', 'Rebecca', 'Priscilla', 'Pointer', 'presence', 'known', 'hard', 'support', 'daughter', 'son.Harv', 'Smithfield', 'George', 'O.', 'Petrie', 'family', 'lawyer', 'must', 'volley', 'sides', 'fence', 'must', 'deal', 'loyalty', 'late', 'Jock', 'wishes', 'friendship', 'Miss', 'Ellie.Watching', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'producers', 'spent', 'bundle', 'clothing', 'locations', 'Also', 'sets', 'were', 'more', 'lavish', 'previous', 'seasons', 'upgrades', 'Ewing', 'home', 'offices.Acting-wise', 'one', 'can', 'top', 'Hagman', 'devilish', 'J.R.', 'lack', 'Emmy', 'win', 'unexplainable', 'travesty', 'history', 'television']",Dallas: Season 6
