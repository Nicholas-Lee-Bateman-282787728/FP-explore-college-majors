1405543,A13TVF86XC4O42,B004FZWDT2,Curmudgeonly Grammarian,"[2, 2]","See if this sounds familiar: Veggie decides to use theater production to teach the city a lesson. Veggie stakes a lot on production, then learns a local church is doing a show the same night, only with a star attraction which is sure to draw the audience away from Veggie's crummy more commercialized act. Veggie turns evil, steals the star with the justification that ""it can't hurt"", attempts to use star, theater burns down due to faulty invention, Veggie is ruined, forgiveness handed out in ""spirit of the holiday"".Ring a bell? Right: Star of Christmas, possibly the least favorite and worst Veggie Tale until this one. Mike Nawrocki ought to be ashamed of the horrible repackaging of a prior VT, let alone one that was so badly done. The songs were terrible, the animation lousy, and the characters inspiring not a shred of empathy. Want to simulate the Christ-centered message of this DVD? You can't, because there's even less of a Christian message in this one than in ""Star of Christmas"". All you can do is hop around the room chanting the inane drivel, ""Bunnies, bunnies, bunnies"" until you can't stand it anymore.Terrible DVD. If Amazon allowed negative stars, this earns it. It's the only Veggie Tale I didn't even let my kids watch, because it's really THAT bad.",1,Badly redone knock-off of another Veggie Tale,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,1275,"['See', 'familiar', 'Veggie', 'use', 'theater', 'production', 'teach', 'city', 'lesson', 'Veggie', 'lot', 'production', 'then', 'local', 'church', 'doing', 'show', 'same', 'night', 'only', 'star', 'attraction', 'sure', 'draw', 'audience', 'away', 'Veggie', 'crummy', 'more', 'commercialized', 'act', 'Veggie', 'evil', 'star', 'justification', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'attempts', 'use', 'star', 'theater', 'burns', 'down', 'due', 'faulty', 'invention', 'Veggie', 'ruined', 'forgiveness', 'handed', 'out', 'spirit', 'holiday', '.Ring', 'bell', 'Right', 'Star', 'Christmas', 'possibly', 'least', 'favorite', 'worst', 'Veggie', 'Tale', 'one', 'Mike', 'Nawrocki', 'ought', 'be', 'ashamed', 'horrible', 'repackaging', 'prior', 'VT', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'done', 'songs', 'were', 'terrible', 'animation', 'lousy', 'characters', 'inspiring', 'not', 'shred', 'empathy', 'Want', 'simulate', 'Christ-centered', 'message', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'less', 'Christian', 'message', 'one', 'Star', 'Christmas', 'can', 'do', 'hop', 'room', 'chanting', 'inane', 'drivel', 'Bunnies', 'bunnies', 'bunnies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'anymore.Terrible', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'allowed', 'negative', 'stars', 'only', 'Veggie', 'Tale', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'really', 'THAT', 'bad']",VeggieTales: 'Twas the Night Before Easter

1405545,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B004FZWDT2,Mark Baker,"[41, 41]","Marlee Meade (played by Petunia Rhubarb) is a young reporter in Crisper County who is tired of the veggie interest fluff pieces she normally does.  She quits her job to revitalize the local theater.  Teaming up with her cameraman/writer (played by Larry the Cucumber), she decided to put on a new musical ""Up with Bunnies.""  It will premier right before Easter and use musical theater to spread hope to others.Then she learns that local girl made good Cassie Cassava (voiced by American Idol finalist Melinda Doolittle), winner of the TV talent show is going to be in town to sing at her home church on Easter Sunday.  Marlee knows that if she can get Cassie to perform during opening night, she'll reach a wider audience.  Can she do it?  Will that really help the community?Now please don't misunderstand what I am about to say.  I found this video to be quite fun, possibly one of the funnier videos that they've put out recently.  I laughed a few times at some of the pop culture references, even for shows I don't watch.  And I loved catching a couple of classic songs and some characters we haven't seen in a while pop up.  The new silly song is fun as well.However....We've seen the theater plot in these videos a couple of times already, couldn't they have come up with something new?The theme of this episode is that we need to help others.  No problem with that.  But why make it an Easter video?  They could have done a normal episode without the Easter trappings and had the same moral.  Yes, they tie it into Jesus' sacrifice for us, but it seems weak to me.Worse yet, they mention a couple of times what Easter is really about, but they don't really get into it.  If you don't already know what they believe, you wouldn't know any better after watching this tape.I think part of my frustration is that their first Easter video,Veggie Tales: An Easter Carol, is still one of my favorites, and I love how it really explores what Easter means and why it matters.  This one doesn't even come close to touching it.If you enjoy the humor of the series, you'll enjoy this episode.  But be sure to get The Easter Carol, too since that's the one you'll want to make sure you watch every year.",3,"All Flash, Little Substance",1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,2197,"['Marlee', 'Meade', 'played', 'Petunia', 'Rhubarb', 'young', 'reporter', 'Crisper', 'County', 'who', 'tired', 'veggie', 'interest', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'normally', 'job', 'revitalize', 'local', 'theater', 'Teaming', 'up', 'cameraman/writer', 'played', 'Larry', 'Cucumber', 'decided', 'put', 'new', 'musical', 'Bunnies', 'will', 'premier', 'right', 'Easter', 'use', 'musical', 'theater', 'spread', 'hope', 'others.Then', 'local', 'girl', 'made', 'good', 'Cassie', 'Cassava', 'voiced', 'American', 'Idol', 'finalist', 'Melinda', 'Doolittle', 'winner', 'TV', 'talent', 'show', 'going', 'be', 'town', 'sing', 'home', 'church', 'Easter', 'Sunday', 'Marlee', 'can', 'get', 'Cassie', 'perform', 'opening', 'night', ""'ll"", 'reach', 'wider', 'audience', 'Can', 'do', 'Will', 'really', 'help', 'community', 'Now', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'what', 'am', 'say', 'found', 'video', 'be', 'quite', 'fun', 'possibly', 'one', 'funnier', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'put', 'out', 'recently', 'laughed', 'few', 'times', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'even', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'loved', 'catching', 'couple', 'classic', 'songs', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'while', 'pop', 'up', 'new', 'silly', 'song', 'fun', 'well.However', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'theater', 'plot', 'videos', 'couple', 'times', 'already', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'new', 'theme', 'episode', 'need', 'help', 'others', 'problem', 'why', 'make', 'Easter', 'video', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'normal', 'episode', 'Easter', 'trappings', 'had', 'same', 'moral', 'Yes', 'tie', 'Jesus', 'sacrifice', 'weak', 'me.Worse', 'yet', 'mention', 'couple', 'times', 'what', 'Easter', 'really', 'about', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'what', 'believe', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'watching', 'tape.I', 'think', 'part', 'frustration', 'first', 'Easter', 'video', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'Easter', 'Carol', 'still', 'one', 'favorites', 'love', 'how', 'really', 'what', 'Easter', 'why', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'touching', 'it.If', 'enjoy', 'humor', 'series', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'episode', 'be', 'sure', 'get', 'Easter', 'Carol', 'too', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'year']",VeggieTales: 'Twas the Night Before Easter
