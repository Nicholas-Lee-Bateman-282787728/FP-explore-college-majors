1654242,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00D7HBV10,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","I hate reality TV.  OK; I like shows such as ""X Factor"" and even ""American Idol,"" although that latter show is really starting to show it's age.  ""America's Got Talent"" is probably the most entertaining of them all, as it's kind of like a modern-day ""Gong Show.""  The ""funnest"" times are watching the failures on AGT; not necessarily the successes.But it's hard to call those shows ""Reality TV"" in a way.  Shows such as ""Honey Boo Boo"" fit better into that genre, and they are horrible.  Horrible people, horrible plot, horrible TV.  But this movie almost fits into that category, although this actually works while those don't.And this works because you care about the characters here, while you couldn't -- or rather shouldn't -- give a dang about people such as Honey Boo Boo, or whatever her real name is.  While you may argue that being so knowledgeable about wine is a waste of time, these guys surely wouldn't agree.  They spend all of their waking hours, perhaps even their dreams, thinking about wine.  And anyone who spends this much time on any passion is someone that you can easily root for, and while your stomach may hurt from drinking too much wine while watching, that same stomach may hurt even more when one or more fails at becoming a Master Sommelier.I won't tell you who ""wins"" and who ""loses,"" but the one guy that I rooted for the most was Ian Cauble.  Sure, you might argue that he's somewhat cocky.  But it's hard to argue against that fact that he's really knowledgeable, and he really cares about his craft.  And he always seems to keep his head up, which surely must have been hard to do in his years-long goal of getting a pin and prestige.There are some really good production values here as well.  It was probably shot in HD video, but a lot of the post-production work was really nice.  You see wine pouring and tears flowing in slow motion.  Most documentaries such as these care little about this, but this movie didn't make that mistake.I say, turn off Honey Boo Boo; she lowers the IQ of all Americans.  But rather turn on ""Somm"" and be amazed that anyone in America can still have this much passion about his work.",4,Somm Kind of Wonderful,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,2152,"['hate', 'reality', 'TV', 'like', 'shows', 'such', 'X', 'Factor', 'even', 'American', 'Idol', 'latter', 'show', 'really', 'starting', 'show', 'age', 'America', 'Got', 'Talent', 'probably', 'most', 'entertaining', 'kind', 'modern-day', 'Gong', 'Show', 'funnest', 'times', 'are', 'watching', 'failures', 'AGT', 'not', 'necessarily', 'successes.But', 'hard', 'call', 'shows', 'Reality', 'TV', 'way', 'Shows', 'such', 'Honey', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'fit', 'better', 'genre', 'are', 'horrible', 'Horrible', 'people', 'horrible', 'plot', 'horrible', 'TV', 'movie', 'almost', 'category', 'actually', ""don't.And"", 'care', 'characters', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'rather', 'should', ""n't"", 'give', 'dang', 'people', 'such', 'Honey', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'real', 'name', 'may', 'argue', 'being', 'so', 'knowledgeable', 'wine', 'waste', 'time', 'guys', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'agree', 'spend', 'waking', 'hours', 'perhaps', 'even', 'dreams', 'thinking', 'wine', 'anyone', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'passion', 'someone', 'can', 'easily', 'root', 'stomach', 'may', 'hurt', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'wine', 'watching', 'same', 'stomach', 'may', 'hurt', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'one', 'more', 'fails', 'becoming', 'Master', 'Sommelier.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'wins', 'who', 'one', 'guy', 'rooted', 'most', 'was', 'Ian', 'Cauble', 'Sure', 'might', 'argue', 'somewhat', 'cocky', 'hard', 'argue', 'fact', 'really', 'knowledgeable', 'really', 'craft', 'always', 'keep', 'head', 'up', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'do', 'years-long', 'goal', 'getting', 'pin', 'prestige.There', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'probably', 'shot', 'HD', 'video', 'lot', 'post-production', 'work', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'see', 'wine', 'pouring', 'tears', 'flowing', 'slow', 'motion', 'Most', 'documentaries', 'such', 'care', 'little', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake.I', 'say', 'turn', 'off', 'Honey', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'IQ', 'Americans', 'rather', 'turn', 'Somm', 'be', 'amazed', 'anyone', 'America', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'much', 'passion', 'work']",N/A

I can only imagine the pressure, competitiveness, and stress that goes along with the much, much tougher Master level (level 4).This short (80 minute or so) documentary follows a small group of Bay Area wine professionals and their studies leading up to the exam.  I found it to be a pretty nice documentary because the folks didn't seem to be too over personified.  A lot of documentaries really edit the show to show people in situations they like, but it seems pretty fair here.  With the exception of a few of the Masters actually helping the others to study.I admit that much of the reason I enjoyed it was for nostalgia.  I enjoyed seeing Guy Stout a couple of times (he actually administered my Certified exam).  But this documentary is good for two kinds of folks: those in the wine industry who have actually taken or have considered taking any of the certifications from WSET, CMS, or SWE; or those who are interested in wine and want to see a bit of the inside of the wine industry at the highest levels.For the record: Rajat Parr has not taken any of the exams and so I was a bit peeved to see him in this documentary - but so it goes.  =)",5,Great little documentary (wine industry professional review) ~,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1259,"[""'ve"", 'completed', 'Certified', 'level', 'level', '2', 'Court', 'Master', 'Sommeliers', 'was', 'pretty', 'intense', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'pressure', 'competitiveness', 'stress', 'along', 'much', 'much', 'tougher', 'Master', 'level', 'level', '4', '.This', 'short', '80', 'minute', 'so', 'documentary', 'small', 'group', 'Bay', 'Area', 'wine', 'professionals', 'studies', 'leading', 'up', 'exam', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'nice', 'documentary', 'folks', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'too', 'personified', 'lot', 'documentaries', 'really', 'edit', 'show', 'show', 'people', 'situations', 'like', 'pretty', 'fair', 'here', 'exception', 'few', 'Masters', 'actually', 'helping', 'others', 'study.I', 'admit', 'much', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'nostalgia', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Guy', 'Stout', 'couple', 'times', 'actually', 'administered', 'Certified', 'exam', 'documentary', 'good', 'two', 'kinds', 'folks', 'wine', 'industry', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'taken', 'have', 'considered', 'taking', 'certifications', 'WSET', 'CMS', 'SWE', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'wine', 'want', 'see', 'bit', 'inside', 'wine', 'industry', 'highest', 'record', 'Rajat', 'Parr', 'not', 'taken', 'exams', 'so', 'was', 'bit', 'peeved', 'see', 'documentary', '=']",N/A

Less than 200 candidates have passed this test since it began in 1969; it has one of the lowest pass rates of any exam in the world.Our 2013 Seattle International Film Festival screening audience was interested, entertained and invested in the outcome. We each had our personal favorites and were appropriately anxious as the test day neared.Award-winning Director Jason Wise has accumulated wonderful interviews with articulate, funny, intelligent (and ambitious!) candidates. Many of them have photographic memories and when you learn all the minutiae that they must master, it would seem that ONLY candidates with photographic memories could compete! The scope of their education (and those flash-cards) is mind-boggling.It's fun to get acquainted with the candidates, their wives and girlfriends, other Master Sommeliers, and interested professionals. One father said his son gravitated to this profession because he is very competitive AND wine is an intoxicant. Several wives had some pretty emphatic things to say about that disgusting spit bucket that has become a part of their lives. Sommeliers don't DRINK all that wine, they sniff it, sample it, taste it, analyze it, then spit it out and continue on.The sequence of wine glasses being destroyed between segments becomes a character itself!

Since it is following six candidates who are studying to be Master Sommeliers, the fact become repetitive. But if you are really involved in wines this won't bother you.If you've seen the film (it played many wine film festivals) you will probably still want the DVD for the special features. Three are short: three minutes on the writing of the original film score, a four-minute alternate ending and two-minutes on the photographing of the ""shattering glass"" images used to define the chapters (these seem to really impress a previous reviewer here on Amazon.).

A documentary should be the filmmakers best effort to portray reality - What is it like to prepare for the Master Sommelier exam? What exactly is the Master Sommelier exam, and why should we care about anybody aspiring to take it?I'm not sure filmmaker Jason Wise fully comprehended his subject, and thus, rather than taking a broad view, he provides us a small portal through which to understand the process of aspiring to be a Sommelier.I think this film would have been improved by providing the context of exactly what a Sommelier is; what their typical working experience is like, and why some feel inspired to obtain the formal credential of ""Master"". Moreover, little context was provided to help us understand why the particular organization sponsoring the competition has the credibility, clout or ""license"" to hold itself out as worthy to certify ""masters"".However, my biggest gripe with this film is that Jason Wise (filmmaker) attempts to manipulate the audience in this so called ""objective portrayal of reality"" by subtly pitting, with bias, the laid-back approach of one contestant against the anal retentive approach of another. Wise wants to sucker you into a premature judgment about which approach is going to succeed, so that he can prove you wrong; Wise wants the approach to mastering a subject (and kind of person) Wise prefers vindicated. This is not true journalism - presenting the pertinent facts in an evenhanded manner and letting the viewer decide -, it's the kind of journalism that dominates America today, where the journalist takes upon himself the task of influencing the audience to see the world the way, he the journalist, wants you to see it.Despite all these egregious flaws I still rate this work as ""good"" (4 stars).
