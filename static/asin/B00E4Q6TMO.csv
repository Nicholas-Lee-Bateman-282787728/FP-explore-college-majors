I buy every DVD/Blu-ray they put out featuring Batman or The Justice League and many of the other movies too. This is a very good documentary that covers ALOT of villains, some I had never even heard of. I enjoyed it very much. However if you are looking for an exciting movie, this ain't it. For the casual viewer of animated fare this probably would have been a much better 'special feature' on the next animated Blu-ray release and I have to say even I wondered how long it was going to go on when there was still at least 30 minutes left to go. I really only have one complaint about the documentary: Are we really interviewing WWE Wrestling 'Superstars' as celebrity experts now?

I like the fact that they actually took the time to create a movie dedicated to super-villains; however I felt like everything was rushed. And they could have dug a little deeper on each character. I knew I was going in to hear about the usual suspects (on the cover) but I really wanted them to showcase their enthusiasm with some of the lesser known villains as well. I wanted more conversation and depth to Black manta and Cheetah. I also wanted other villains to get mentioned like Gentleman ghost or Ocean master, Despero and Catman just to name a few....hell they didn't even mention Gorilla Grodd. Villains aside I thought the narration was perfect and the choice to showcase all the characters at random made it feel as though there was no villain truly greater than another. All in all it's a great documentary to not only witness these iconic characters explained in a different light but also the film gives you first hand the type of effect these characters of the DC universe really have on people and fans as a whole. When you watch it be sure to look at the reactions of the creators and writers of the universe. Their excitement and enthusiasm alone is enough to show you. For a documentary they really get into it.

DC Comics marketed this video as an in-depth study of evil through the prism of its thousands of 'super-villains'. As such, I expected that this would be either:a) a feature-length commercial for DC comic books, animation and feature films-or-b) what it promised...a unique documentary, offering new and fascinating insightsInstead, it is one of the most un-focused, rambling and overall boring films I have viewed in many years.Aimed solely at rabid fanboys, who have memorized every bit of minutia from the DC canon, this is a bunch of 'talking heads', including current DC editors/writers, directors of DC comic movies, people from DC animation, and an occasional 'legit' expert (e.g., Neil Gaiman). There is nothing going on, except a lot of dis-jointed comments about arcs, characters and important 'moments' in DC history...all without any context from which to consider their value or connections.For example, a lot of 'Green Lantern' was touched on during the course of the film. They touched on the 10-year arc of GL Hal Jordan, and 'mentioned' aspects of his arc, like the destruction of Coast City, Sinestro releasing Parallax from the  Central Battery so it could possess Jordan, 'Black Hand's' suicide, so he could begin the 'Blackest Night' arc, the revelation that the Guardians were evil, and the final (for now) denouement between Jordan and Sinestro, after Sinestro had killed all the Guardians. All of these 'moments' were touched on many minutes apart in the film, out of order, without any unifying context for those unfamiliar with the intricacies of GL mythology. In addition, they were showing 'Parallax' from the wretched GL live-action film of a few years ago, which has nothing to do with the Parallax/Hal Jordan arc of the comics (which is what they were touching on).In short, it was like having a bunch of people walking around a comic book convention, filming random conversations and then clipping/pasting snippets of these conversations together...without any thought of context or continuity...and, releasing it as a movie.

1664530,A344N0X5LIV43M,B00E4Q6TMO,"Ryan ""Kozmik Pariah""","[8, 10]","This is a pretty good documentary about villains and how they define and/or compliment their respective heroes. I felt it seriously needed a little more focus in some areas and since there's no special features, it feels like it's missing maybe some form of villain encyclopedia of the relatively few mentioned villains (mostly the mentioned one's are the primary nemeses of DC's top heroes) and the people we see discussing the villains.Overall I almost wanted to four star this, but I couldn't because of one celebrity. Literally every single time DC overrated (once he was great but he's as bland as Marvel's Bendis now) superstar Geoff Johns appears to discuss a villain, this huckster does not technically offer insight into the psyche of the villain, or the villain's motivations, but he simply discusses that said villain is intriguing because &#34;there's a moment where [villain] did [action] and it's a great moment&#34;. The moments of greatness from the villain is inevitably not something fantastic but a moment or origin Geoff himself actually wrote in so it's a bit of fanfiction self service in my opinion. The villains he discusses are Black Manta, Sinestro, the Aquaman race he created for New 52, Amanda Waller (who is definitely nit really a villain to my knowledge), Flash's Rogues, and several others. Taking into account Zoom (Reverse Flash II), Darkseid, and one or two other brief notes from other creators, this documentary should have been called &#34;Necessary Evils of Geoff&#34;.That said it's not truly awful and the end talks about the lukewarm New 52 (painted as loved of course) and the then planned currently in the process &#34;Forever Evil&#34; event (I kind of laughed at the part about Rogues writing their weapon abilities on their DNA, because Forever Evil undid that part when the film released).",3,Not bad for comics' greatest villains,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1838,"['pretty', 'good', 'documentary', 'villains', 'how', 'define', 'and/or', 'compliment', 'respective', 'heroes', 'felt', 'seriously', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'focus', 'areas', 'special', 'features', 'missing', 'maybe', 'form', 'villain', 'encyclopedia', 'relatively', 'few', 'mentioned', 'villains', 'mostly', 'mentioned', 'one', 'are', 'primary', 'nemeses', 'DC', 'top', 'heroes', 'people', 'see', 'discussing', 'villains.Overall', 'almost', 'wanted', 'four', 'star', 'could', ""n't"", 'one', 'celebrity', 'Literally', 'single', 'time', 'DC', 'overrated', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'bland', 'Marvel', 'Bendis', 'now', 'superstar', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'discuss', 'villain', 'huckster', 'not', 'technically', 'offer', 'insight', 'psyche', 'villain', 'villain', 'motivations', 'simply', 'said', 'villain', 'intriguing', '34', 'moment', 'where', '[', 'villain', ']', 'did', '[', 'action', ']', 'great', 'moment', '34', 'moments', 'greatness', 'villain', 'inevitably', 'not', 'something', 'fantastic', 'moment', 'origin', 'Geoff', 'actually', 'wrote', 'bit', 'fanfiction', 'self', 'service', 'opinion', 'villains', 'are', 'Black', 'Manta', 'Sinestro', 'Aquaman', 'race', 'created', 'New', '52', 'Amanda', 'Waller', 'who', 'definitely', 'nit', 'really', 'villain', 'knowledge', 'Flash', 'Rogues', 'several', 'others', 'Taking', 'account', 'Zoom', 'Reverse', 'Flash', 'II', 'Darkseid', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'brief', 'notes', 'other', 'creators', 'documentary', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', '34', 'Necessary', 'Evils', 'Geoff', '34', 'said', 'not', 'truly', 'awful', 'end', 'talks', 'lukewarm', 'New', '52', 'painted', 'loved', 'course', 'then', 'planned', 'currently', 'process', '34', 'Forever', 'Evil', '34', 'event', 'kind', 'laughed', 'part', 'Rogues', 'writing', 'weapon', 'abilities', 'DNA', 'Forever', 'Evil', 'undid', 'part', 'when', 'film', 'released']",Necessary Evil: Super-Villains of DC Comics
