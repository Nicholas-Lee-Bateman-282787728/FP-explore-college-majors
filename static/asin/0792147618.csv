Serial killer movies are a tricky genre because they can dive into camp if they aren't careful, but Gary Fleder helms this vehicle with class.  He doesn't insert a lot of creativity and he certainly doesn't try anything different here, but as a straightforward thriller, this works very well and rarely comes off forced (the fight scene in the film's beginning was more a case of the novel being overthought).  Judd and Freeman make a great team, and the production design (that hideaway alone) is wholly effective and truly memorable.

This is a spellbinding suspenseful thriller with more than one twist so have an extra bag of popcorn ready for the microwave because your eyes will be glued to the screen.  This movie is all about the viewer trying to keep up as the detective negotiates the maze of clues and distractions.MORGAN FREEMAN is the reason I watched this movie.  Loved it!  Every time there's an ""Alex Cross"" novel-movie available I watch it.  Driving Miss Daisy, Seven, High Crimes, Shawshank Redemption, Glory, Million Dollar Baby, and all those many other movies are excellent, still, Morgan Freeman as the outright leading character are the height of entertainment!Just get all the ""Alex Cross Detective"" movies starring Morgan Freeman available and watch them four or five times.  The movies share titles with novels, but don't let that delay your viewing.An avid reader, I had never heard of James Patterson until I had seen ""Kiss The Girls"" and ""Along Came A Spider"".  Thus, I had the benefit of not being concerned as to whether the movie script followed the novel to the letter.  Who cares?!  If they differ, it is most likely because, duh, one is a MOVIE while the other is a BOOK.  Reviewers who complain about the differences must not understand that what makes a good chocolate cake doesn't quite make a good chocolate ice cream.  To achieve the same flavor, you've got to change some key ingredients.Morgan Freemam MADE the character Alex Cross worth watching.  When you need an actor to literally CARRY a movie, you've got to get someone with a reputation for doing the heavy lifting.  Freeman has long since done that in ""Driving Miss Daisy"".  Recently, though I don't know why he bothered to do it, unless as a personal favor to his friend Clint Eastwood, Freeman did all the hard work again in ""Million Dollar Baby"".  Come on folks.  I like Eastwood as much as anyone, but there's a REASON he's been directing movies and not acting in them for decades now, and ""MDB"" is a painful example.  Hilary Swank?  Well, if you get ""packaged"" between Eastwood's direction and Freeman's acting, cleary people will mistake you for an actress!  At least partially reminds me of Driving Miss Daisy.When you search ""DVDs"" for ""Morgan Freeman"", it lists 'related searches' as ""Denzel Washington"", ""Mel Gibson"", and ""Tom Hanks"".  Those guys are listed as RELATED to Morgan Freeman!  You should really see this movie.  And also see ""ALONG CAME A SPIDER"", which I've also reviewed.",5,Outrageously Entertaining!

Of course, having someone as good at presenting the merits of forensic scientist as Morgan Freeman certainly helps, as does the strong performance by Ashley Judd, fresh from her star turn in ""Heat"" playing opposite Robert DeNiro and Val Kilmer.  She is smart, sassy, and more than the match for the serial killer she must face alone here, and shows how well she can play an urbane, well-educated, and resourceful modern woman.And such talents are required by the somewhat convoluted plot spun from author James Patterson's gory novel of the same name. Filmed in somber tones, much of the action takes place in a makeshift subterranean lockup the serial murderer uses to such gruesome effect. Yet other scenes contrast this muddy environment by depicting the upscale area of the lovely area around the ""Research Triangle"" area of North Carolina near Duke University and the University Of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Since Judd's character is a surgeon also doing important pediatric research, it shows a number of familiar scenes that denizens of the area will certainly recognize.After Judd manages to escape from the killer and make her back to the world, she agrees to help Freeman find him. Of course, this is when all hell breaks loose, and a number of unexpected plot twists make this a suspenseful thriller that had me at the edge of my seat for the last half hour. It is a fast-paced movie, one that is fairly intelligent in its approach, and as relatively straight-forward `bang-em-up' entertainment it works quite well.

I haven't read the novel, so my agreement on the mediocrity of this movie stems from a slightly different source.This movie centers around Alex Cross (played by Morgan Freeman), a forensic psychologist assigned to investigate a series of bi-coastal kidnappings simultaneously occurring in North Carolina and California.  One of the women kidnapped is his own niece.  He subsequently deduces that there are two kidnappers, one on each coast, who are both helping each other as well as competing against each other in some sort of sick game.  Ashley Judd plays Kate Tiernan, a North Carolina doctor who is one of the women kidnapped but then manages to escape from the kidnapper's lair in the forest.  She and Cross team up to find the kidnapped women and capture the kidnappers.This movie is fairly entertaining, and Freeman and Judd are at their usual best.  I also enjoyed the scenery in which the movie was filmed.  However, this movie has a few drawbacks that cannot be overlooked.  First, while Morgan Freeman gave an excellent performance, it was obvious that his part should have been given to someone a little younger.  He's one of the greatest actors of our time, but he's a little too old to be doing action movies.  Also, this movie was too much like Silence of the Lambs, only not as good.

126910,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0792147618,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 3]","Based on author James Patterson's best-selling thriller, Kiss The Girls is one of those rare films that translates well from the pages of a novel to the big screen of Hollywood. Such a transition is especially fluid when Morgan Freeman is cast in the role of the leading character. Like Tom Clancy's books (which did well as films with big name stars filling the lead roles), James Patterson's books exhibit immense promise as tinsel-town screenplays. Along Came A Spider is the latest example. But Kiss The Girls can stand on its own as a thrilling murder mystery steeped in suspense...When Washington DC Detective Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) learns that his niece, Naomi (Gina Ravera), has been kidnapped, he travels to North Carolina in an effort to aid in her recovery. When a pattern of similar events draws authorities to the conclusion that the kidnappings are the work of a serial killer who calls himself ""Casanova,"" Alex Cross begins working alongside Dr. Kate McTiernan, a woman who recently escaped becoming the vicious serial killer's latest victim...But as Alex Cross and Kate McTiernan get closer to uncovering the true identity of Casanova, a killer who preys solely on young and beautiful women, Kate is yet again targeted by the killer - who's deeply disappointed she escaped the first time. Is Naomi still alive? Will Kate and Alex catch the killer before he catches them? And what is the true identity of this criminal mastermind? Kiss The Girls will keep you guessing until the end with its brilliantly conceived and well authored screenplay...Ashley Judd exhibits the talents which turned her into a Hollywood star with her role as Dr. Kate McTiernan, but the true show stealing performance belongs to Morgan Freeman for his role as the lead character Alex Cross. Patterson goes to great lengths to build a bond between Cross and his readers in Kiss The Girls, and that character development translates well onto the big screen. Moreover, Freeman is a likeable guy. He speaks in soft, but assertive, whispers. He's always in control of himself, and he plays characters that are generally honest, straight-forward, and humble. How could you not like a guy like that?Freeman's wide-reaching appeal among audience members adds depth to a movie that would otherwise consist solely of plot (which isn't necessarily bad for a movie in this genre). But that's why Kiss The Girls is a better than average murder mystery. In between the clues and the thrilling suspense sequences, the viewer isn't bored. That results in a more enjoyable movie experience, and that's one of the reasons why Kiss The Girls is a definite must-see film you won't want to miss...The DVD Report",4,"Freeman, Judd, and lots of suspense...",1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2689,"['Based', 'author', 'James', 'Patterson', 'best-selling', 'thriller', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'well', 'pages', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'Hollywood', 'transition', 'especially', 'fluid', 'when', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'cast', 'role', 'leading', 'character', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'books', 'did', 'well', 'films', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'filling', 'lead', 'roles', 'James', 'Patterson', 'books', 'exhibit', 'immense', 'promise', 'tinsel-town', 'screenplays', 'Along', 'Came', 'A', 'Spider', 'latest', 'example', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'thrilling', 'murder', 'mystery', 'steeped', 'suspense', 'When', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Detective', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'niece', 'Naomi', 'Gina', 'Ravera', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'North', 'Carolina', 'effort', 'aid', 'recovery', 'When', 'pattern', 'similar', 'events', 'draws', 'authorities', 'conclusion', 'kidnappings', 'are', 'work', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'Casanova', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'working', 'alongside', 'Dr.', 'Kate', 'McTiernan', 'woman', 'who', 'recently', 'escaped', 'becoming', 'vicious', 'serial', 'killer', 'latest', 'victim', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Kate', 'McTiernan', 'get', 'closer', 'uncovering', 'true', 'identity', 'Casanova', 'killer', 'who', 'solely', 'young', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Kate', 'yet', 'again', 'targeted', 'killer', 'who', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'escaped', 'first', 'time', 'Naomi', 'still', 'alive', 'Will', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'catch', 'killer', 'what', 'true', 'identity', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'well', 'authored', 'screenplay', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'talents', 'turned', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Kate', 'McTiernan', 'true', 'show', 'stealing', 'performance', 'belongs', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'role', 'lead', 'character', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Patterson', 'great', 'lengths', 'build', 'bond', 'Cross', 'readers', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'character', 'development', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'Moreover', 'Freeman', 'likeable', 'guy', 'soft', 'assertive', 'whispers', 'always', 'control', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'honest', 'straight-forward', 'humble', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'guy', 'Freeman', 'wide-reaching', 'appeal', 'audience', 'members', 'depth', 'movie', 'would', 'otherwise', 'consist', 'solely', 'plot', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'movie', 'genre', 'why', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'better', 'average', 'murder', 'mystery', 'clues', 'thrilling', 'suspense', 'sequences', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'bored', 'results', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'experience', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

126922,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0792147618,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Kiss the Girls is a disturbing, well-crafted movie that exceeded all of my expectations.  It is not what I would call horror per se, but there are certainly some realistic scenes of violence in it.  This movie pulls no punches; any ghastly images are there not for shock value but for the simple reason that the story demands them to be there in order for the film to be as powerful as it is.  Someone is kidnapping young, attractive girls in North Carolina's Research Triangle area; three have been found dead in the woods, but the rest remain missing.  One of the missing is the niece of Washington, D.C. forensic investigator Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman), and he goes to Durham to help find her.  Soon thereafter, medical doctor Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) is kidnapped from her home.  She wakes up to find a masked man telling her how much he loves her; this self-named Casanova has assembled a harem of sorts for himself, keeping the missing girls locked up in separate rooms in an unknown stone-walled location.  McTiernan is the only victim to break her captor's rules and survive, and she becomes Cross' greatest asset in his hunt for the criminal.  The eventual outcome is somewhat complex, but the terrific script allows for little misunderstanding on the part of the viewer.  Most importantly, the conclusion is both spectacular and largely unforeseen; Kiss the Girls triumphs in delivering a thoroughly satisfying ending, a fact which distinguishes it from the majority of action/thriller/psychological horror movies.Is there a better actor in Hollywood than Morgan Freeman?  His virtually perfect acting is greatly complemented here by Ashley Judd's own superb performance.  The role of Casanova is also played extremely well, guaranteeing the high-impact drama of the incredible conclusion.  As a native North Carolinian, though, I would like to say that the accents of the Durham policemen were not really accurate.  I have no other complaints at all.  Some may be interested in knowing there is no nudity in this film, which is somewhat refreshing.

126929,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0792147618,D. Litton,"[2, 2]","A highly intensifying and intelligent suspense thriller, &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; sets a precedent for the genre into which it is born. It has all the classical elements of a first rate thriller film: an involving story, a dark and unsettling tone, smart characters and a stellar cast. But what sets this movie apart from others of its kind is its superb intelligence, which contributes to the way the story moves, and a terrific cast that plays out their characters with unmatched superiority when it comes to dialogue and brain power.As the movie opens to its beginning credits, a man is telling an unknown person about his past voyeurism over two teenage girls, both of which he kidnapped and one of which he killed because she rejected him. This is all done in a series of floating images, intermixed with a frightening score and the deep voice of the killer, whose voice never breaks in its seriousness. As the movie progresses, detective Alex Cross learns that his niece has been kidnapped, only a day after a woman's body has been discovered tied to a tree in a string of killings following abductions of numerous women. Since all of the women have not been found, Cross is able to hypothesize that the killer does not kill on a whim, but &quot;collects&quot; women and keeps them hidden from the rest of the world. This character really gives Morgan Freeman a chance to play the detective we all know he can be, and he does it with the same bravura that made his acting in &quot;Seven&quot; such a success.Enter Kate McTiernan, a young medical intern who becomes the latest addition to &quot;Casanova's&quot; collection. She is kidnapped from her home and wakes up later to a dark room, where she is bound to a bed. After she learns that there are other women in other rooms close to her, she becomes more and more determined to escape, and succeeds in her task. After being in a coma, she makes acquaintance with Cross, who begins examining her mind and thoughts to find out what exactly happened to her as well as any clue as to the location where she was taken. As she begins remembering more clues, they begin an undercover hunt for the killer, making their way between Los Angeles and North Carolina in order to capture who they think is the killer. What they will ultimately discover is that they are dealing with more than what they originally think, and the results of their trophy may end up causing more harm than good.The movie is based on the novel of the same name by James Patterson, who is one of the better modern suspense writers of our time. It is clear that the movie has captured the true core of the novel, because in watching it, I was able to see many of the different Patterson techniques. The movie is a true innovation in that it takes all of the basic elements of a thriller and bends them to its own satisfaction and liking. What we think is going to happen really turns out to be something else waiting in the wings, and once the secrets are revealed, all the stops are pulled out and the showdown is underway.However original it may be, the film does derive a certain amount of inspiration from the film &quot;Seven,&quot; which is a novice for it usage of heavily dark images and intensely damp and moldy settings that give the movie a dirty, unclean feel. &quot;Girls&quot; uses this similar technique as well, mostly during scenes of heightened suspense as well as sequences that involve the seduction of the kidnapped women by the elusive, mask-wearing &quot;Casanova.&quot; Whenever he appears onscreen, there is always a shadow that falls on him, whether it be half of his form, or the lower half of his masked face. This adds so much more to the suspense and the unknown in this film, also allowing the viewer to use their imagination when it comes to putting the whole image together in their mind.The film is superbly adapted from the novel, with a greatly intelligent script and a story that never stops moving until the highly climactic ending. Throughout the movie, Cross and McTiernan have a terrific lingo of intellectual connection going, and the film is great in allowing them to help each other out in finding clues instead of pitting them against one another. They do share the same motive, which is to capture the killer, but while Kate has more incentive to find the suspect, Cross is the one who really ends up going overboard in his pursuit, pushing the envelope when it comes to finding clues. The killer's motive is also a welcome aspect, giving us something much higher and deeper than just dead bodies and wanton revenge.The acting is probably the most intrical part of the film, with two leads that pack a power punch of credibility and painstaking recreation of the characters from the novel. Morgan Freeman is able to embody everything that Alex Cross is, an ambitious detective whose extreme knowledge of crime and diverse criminal minds sometimes take him too far is his hunt. This is Freeman at his best here, giving us a high-caliber performance that keeps the suspense aspect of the film going. Ashley Judd breathes irrepresible life into the character of Kate McTiernan, who adds to the suspense as well as giving the story an emotional outlet. She comes off as strong and smart, using her brain as well as her high-order thinking skills in maintaining her character's personality and traits.&quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; is not like your everyday thriller, which is what makes it so refreshing. Unlike the many others before it, we are able to identify with the characters on a highly personal level, and we are right there with them as they go through the story's twists and turns. The movie comes out in the end as a successfully-adapted thriller!",4,Intense and gripping!,982627200,"02 20, 2001",2001,5722,"['highly', 'intensifying', 'intelligent', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'quot',

It a great looking film, and those who have read the book ought to be pleased with the performances, especially by Ashley Judd as Kate McTiernan. Mark Isham's score is appropriate in some places, like the main titles, and at other times it sends the wrong notes to fit the scenes.The screenplay suffers a bit from being to tightly adapted from the novel, which, as an experience is entirely different. The novels rely on short chapters and exchanges and constant shifting in viewpoint to keep the reader going along, but the movie needs a slower pace, more meticulous mood building, which this film accomplishes to a degree, but would have benefited from more freedom from the novel to cut down on the story and make the essential plot elements more developed. But to it's credit, the movie does employ a very different ending, which I feel is even better and far more appropriate than Patterson's sett piece finale.Mainstream moviegoers might find the film too dark and be uninterested by the seriel rapist plot, because it's more toned down than your typical detective thriller.

But overall, thanks to great acting, this one keeps afloat.  Freeman is as good as you can expect from him every time and Ashley Judd is very good in the roll that basically MADE her.  However, the two serial killer thing worked out so much better in the novel than it did in the movie because so many elements were left out.  The killers in the book were both very dangerous and repulsive, but in the film, only Cassanova resonates anything and the other turns into a wannabe and it kind of ruins the mood.Something that greatly surprised me was the excellent pacing throughout the entire picture.  Even through the ending, which tries to be shocking but is really nothing new, the pacing is incredible and the movie feels so short for its two hour running time.  That helps keep this movie entertaining since it could've easily gotten dull without keeping the excitement pumping.  A lot of Gary Fleder's camera-work is pretty nifty and some of the action scenes are quite great.  But unlike most killer genre movies that understand that the bad guys must, MUST be the most interesting aspect of the story, Kiss the Girls loses this when it tries to unsuccessfully juggle two killers.  It worked out so much better in the book, but that's okay, because if they had put anything else into the story, it would've become overlong and possibly boring.

126957,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0792147618,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 5]","Morgan Freeman seems to have staked out a niche role.  He seems to play a similar character in ""Seven,"" ""Along Came a Spider,"" and ""High Crimes,"" which also co-stars Ashley Judd, along with other roles.  I should also point out that Morgan Freeman acted in at least 20 films in the five years from 2000 to 2004, quite prolific in this era.  However, it is a role he does exceedingly well.  In fact, Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Cary Elwes and the rest of the cast hold their own from an acting viewpoint.  The problem with this movie is not the acting.  The problem is that this movie is just another in a series of similar movies that, while it has some interesting moments, is still similar in some ways to other recent movies that it appears to be more of a variation on a theme versus anything new.Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) is found by a river.  It turns out that she has escaped a serial kidnapper dubbed Casanova.  It also turns out that Kate has numerous skills, including the ability to defend herself when given the chance to do so.  Of course, Casanova has been keeping his victims drugged, which causes Kate problems for much of the movie.Dr. Alex Cross (Freeman) has a niece that appears to have been kidnapped by the Casanova, and he believes Kate may be the key to finding Casanova, his niece, and the other kidnapped girls.  Along the path to finding Casanova we discover that the kidnapper seems to move back and forth between the East Coast and the West Coast, as the West Coast kidnapper takes his victims soon after the East Coast kidnapper.  We also discover that the kidnapper is a very intelligent person (most of the time), and is so cool about his kidnappings that it is frightening.What I enjoyed about this movie was how I was thrown off the scent by the West Coast and East Coast connection.  Conversely, I was frustrated that it took Dr. Cross so long to figure out where Casanova might be hiding.  I admit that we had more information than Dr. Cross, but based on where Kate was found and her descriptions, Dr. Cross should have had a clue earlier.  I was also disappointed that Casanova did not build the same chill in me as the antagonists in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Seven,"" or even ""Along Came a Spider.""  This movie appears to be a thriller, but it comes across more as an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries.""Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  However, it seemed to me the movie promised much more than it delivered, and I was disappointed by the unfulfilled buildup.  I enjoyed Morgan Freeman's performance (as I nearly always do, the man is an excellent actor), and I found the other characters, particularly Ashley Judd, to be similarly believable.  But I just never got any significant chills from this movie.  It was like hopping on what appears to be a great roller coaster only to find out it was the kiddy coaster.

Kiss the Girls was one of the first things of his that I read, and I still think it's one of his best.  To make matters worse this intricate tale of a serial killer collaboration spanning two coasts was well acted by all participants, especially Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd.  Unfortunately, script and direction totally missed the mark.Actually I can't really fault the scriptwriting, it's just that it uses Patterson's book only for inspiration, and then heads of for parts unknown.  Either writer David Klass or Director Gary Fleder decided they could write a better thriller than James Patterson, and they simply should have called the film something else entirely.Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is drawn into the hunt for a serial kill when his niece Naomi disappears from her law school at Durham, North Carolina.  A killer who styles himself 'Casanova' is kidnapping women and keeping them as a harem, disposing of those who don't fit in.  One victim -Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) - escapes and joins Cross in what turns out to be a cross country hunt for not one, but two killers.As the film stands on its own, it is a decent police procedural, only marred by the apparent ineptness of the hunters, who first go after a red herring and then let one of the killers dribble through their fingers and who continually make mistimed moves.  Director Fleder goes out of his way to make the killers look intelligent at the cost of Alex Cross, the FBI, and the Durham Police.  This is overplayed way beyond what happens in the book.Well, it is very rare that a fictional serial killer does make the police look good, but this time the device is pushed to the point that the film never quite decides what it wants to be and loses its impact.  And the ending is a complete rewrite of Patterson's and lacks the final punch.  This film came out as a quick attempt to capitalize on the success of Silence of Lambs and in the process of imitation, the production never quite captured what made Kiss the Girls a strong novel on its own.So - Watchable, but not great.  Interesting, but not riveting.

126962,A36EW68H08UOCS,0792147618,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","Kiss the Girls has some good things going for it.  Morgan Freeman is one of the most believable actors of any generation, and Ashley Judd gives one of her better performances here as a Doctor who is kidnapped by the villainous murderer ""Casanova"".The movie has to stand up to comparisons with the Thrillers of today, and even limiting that to a shorter list of ""Movies with Serial Killers"", ""Kiss the Girls"" falls a little short. Although I liked much about the movie - specifically the acting of the two leads - I found myself mentally comparing the movie to ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"".The comparison to ""Seven"" is perhaps more obvious with Morgan Freeman in a similar role in both.  Silence of the Lambs stands at the top of the genre and it wasn't surprising to me that this movie didn't measure up.To me the most obvious shortcoming of ""Kiss"" compared to those two superior movies is in the performance of the villain.  Kevin Spacey's appearance in ""Se7en"" begins the final act of that movie, and his twisted character plays off of Brad Pitt and Mr. Freeman perfectly as Seven careens towards it's conclusion.  ""Silence"" tops ""Seven"" with two screen villains - Ted Levine as ""Buffalo Bill"" and Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest screen performances ever as Hannibal Lecter.I won't stoop to giving away actual spoiler information here but.... this movie's villain didn't strike the same bone-chilling terror down in my soul.  If Pee Wee Herman had come riding up on his bright red bicycle in the final act, I swear I would have found it as believable and as thrilling as the way this film plays out. (Now that I think about it, Pee Wee Herman would make a pretty good movie serial killer, huh?)But I digress.  Another bone of contention that I have is with the quality of the acting after Ms. Judd and Mr. Freeman.  Cary Elwes has been good before in comedy (Princess Bride and Men in Tights) and in drama (Lady Jane) - but he has previously demonstrated an imperfect ability to play a southern American(in ""Twister"" as the rival tornado chaser).  Here he plays a southern policeman and he not only doesn't quite pull it off - he doesn't pull it off to a level that damages the movie.  I find it ironic that as Robin Hood in ""Men in Tights"" his character gets to ridicule Kevin Costner's lack of the appropriate accent in HIS Robin Hood movie, where here his lack of the appropriate southern accent makes his character stick out like.... like.... Kevin Costner in Sherwood Forest!Beyond those shortcomings - I recommend ""Kiss the Girls"".",4,Thriller with a Less-Than-Scary Villain(s),1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,2552,"['Kiss', 'Girls', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one', 'most', 'believable', 'actors', 'generation', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'here', 'Doctor', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'villainous', 'murderer', 'Casanova', '.The', 'movie', 'stand', 'up', 'comparisons', 'Thrillers', 'today', 'even', 'limiting', 'shorter', 'list', 'Movies', 'Serial', 'Killers', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'little', 'short', 'liked', 'much', 'movie', 'specifically', 'acting', 'two', 'found', 'mentally', 'comparing', 'movie', 'Seven', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '.The', 'comparison', 'Seven', 'perhaps', 'more', 'obvious', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'similar', 'role', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'top', 'genre', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up.To', 'most', 'obvious', 'shortcoming', 'Kiss', 'compared', 'two', 'superior', 'movies', 'performance', 'villain', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'appearance', 'Se7en', 'final', 'act', 'movie', 'twisted', 'character', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'perfectly', 'Seven', 'conclusion', 'Silence', 'Seven', 'two', 'screen', 'villains', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'one', 'greatest', 'screen', 'performances', 'ever', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stoop', 'giving', 'away', 'actual', 'spoiler', 'information', 'here', 'movie', 'villain', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'same', 'bone-chilling', 'terror', 'down', 'soul', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Herman', 'had', 'come', 'riding', 'up', 'bright', 'red', 'bicycle', 'final', 'act', 'swear', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'believable', 'as', 'thrilling', 'way', 'film', 'out', 'Now', 'think', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Herman', 'would', 'make', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'huh', 'digress', 'bone', 'contention', 'have', 'quality', 'acting', 'Ms.', 'Judd', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'been', 'good', 'before', 'comedy', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Men', 'Tights', 'drama', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'previously', 'demonstrated', 'imperfect', 'ability', 'play', 'southern', 'American', 'Twister', 'rival', 'tornado', 'chaser', 'Here', 'southern', 'policeman', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'level', 'damages', 'movie', 'find', 'ironic', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Men', 'Tights', 'character', 'ridicule', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'lack', 'appropriate', 'accent', 'HIS', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'movie', 'where', 'here', 'lack', 'appropriate', 'southern', 'accent', 'character', 'stick', 'out', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Sherwood', 'Forest', 'Beyond', 'shortcomings', 'recommend', 'Kiss', 'Girls']",N/A

Heck they may not even like it. What's that old saying? ""One person's Treasure is another's Trash""Despite that I was genuinely surprised when I noticed that a few (just a few)reviewers actually trashed Kiss The Girls. One or two reviewers said it wasn't like the book while another said something really crazy, that it was just like The Silence of the Lambs, so it wasn't worth seeing. Well let me tell you, comparing Kiss the Girls with The Silence of the Lambs is like comparing the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Monument because they're both monuments. This reviewer took the common denominator, serial murderers, and said they're both the same. By extension, all movies about serial murders are like TSOTL and not worth seeing and then perhaps all action movies are like Die Hard also are not worth seeing and so forth.As for the comments about not following the book, thats why they write screen plays. Every book cannot be put into visual form without some modification, some more, some less and Kiss the Girls was definitely less. Now I have read Kiss the Girls and Silence of the Lambs too. If something was left out, so be it. That's the case in most movies. You can't cram six hundred pages of story into two hours. Now I didn't read it just before or just after I saw the movie but as I remembered it, I thought it followed the book pretty well.The PlotThe Durham Police Department has problem. Pretty college co-eds are disappearing from area college campuses. Additionally a couple of the women have been located in the wilds tied to a tree, exposed to the elements and wild animals. A note was found at each crime scene that said ""Cassanova"". Whether the remaining captives are alive or dead the investigators can only speculate.The latest victim happens to be the niece of Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) a well reputed forensic detective and author from Washington. He has assured his frantic sister in law that he will do everything in his power to find out what happened to Naomi.When Cross arrives in Durham he gets a tepid response from the authorities, being a famous big city cop nosing around in their business. But since this is family, this is personal and Cross will not be deterred. He discovers that there are six other victims, two of which have been found dead and that there is already a task force investigating.Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) is a remarkable woman. She is an Intern at a local hospital whose hobby is kickboxing. She is beautiful, bright and talented, just the way Cassanova likes them. Kate will make an excellent addition to his collection.The investigation is going nowhere, the investigators are stymied and need a break, when words comes that two boys found a woman on the bank of a river. It is the break they needed for it is the newly kidnapped Dr. McTiernan who apparently escaped from Cassanova but she is in the hospital and something is wrong with her.With the help of Alex Cross, Kate recovers from the drugs that Cassanova had given her, however she is of limited help.She is able to tell authorities that the other victims are alive and being held at some undisclosed location.ConclusionWell let's see, the movie is based on James Patterson's greatest novel and Ashley Judd is my favorite actress and Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor. The acting by all is superb, especially Judd and Freeman but everybody did an outstanding job. The directing was great, the story flows well and is extremely suspenseful.

126979,A3V61K0EF38GP4,0792147618,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","The novel Kiss the Girls was creepy, offering up a frightening scenario with an even more frightening kidnapper/rapist/killer.  This Hollywood adaptation takes the all-too-easy step back from that riveting plot to turn itself into a generic horror film.  In the book, we get an idea of what sort of ""prison"" the kidnapped women are being held in and what their captor, a man wearing various masks and calling himself ""Casanova"" does to them, but in the movie, we see very little of that.  Most of it is implied through dialogue and some is omitted altogether.  That's not really scary.  Overall, the killer in the movie is just watered down and simplified from his counterpart in the novel.  Thankfully, they were smart enough to leave in the second killer, but he barely got any screen time and very little was ever known about him.  Again, the book showed us just how cruel this man was to his victims.  I understand that there will always be changes made when a book is adapted for the big screen, but there's ""making changes"" and then there's taking away what made the book great.  Granted, the cast were all decent and Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd can do no wrong in my eyes, but it's just not enough to save this picture.  All it does is keep it slightly above the fate of becoming completely generic...could you imagine if Silence of the Lambs had taken that route?  If you're an Alex Cross fan like myself, you might not be thrilled by this adaptation of our beloved detective/psychologist's adventure in North Carolina.  But I've seen worse adaptations of books I've read and liked.

It makes ""Taking Lives"" look like a classic, and seriously -how many more of these uninteresting, predictable, bad-acted and full-of-flaws- thrillers will Morgan Freeman waste his talent on. He used to be my favorite actor, but now after seeing him in so many thin-plotted ""look-like-made-for-tv""-thrillers I've changed my mind. And his contribution in Stephen Kings' ""Dreamcatcher"" was perhaps his biggest disaster so far (well, perhaps next to this). Not that he is the problem in any of these movies, it's simply just that not even Freeman can save a paperthin-plotted B(!)-thriller like ""Kiss The Girls"". The problem is not that it resembles you of previous famous thrillers like ""Seven"" and (especially here of course to) ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" because thanks to those ""Kiss The Girls"" starts out well. My first reactions after a well-functioning opening was ""this will be good!"" Already after the first 30 minutes you can tell it will be better than Morgans' previous ""Along Came A Spider"". Yes, the movie is great and slowly builds up until...! Well, one of the many girls cidnapped by a ""serial""-killer (or whatever) manages to escape the prison-cave, good for her of course -but they make a big point of that this girl has been heavily drugged, and her legs did not carry her far. With the killer behind her she jumps into a waterfall, and is picked up by someone further down the river. Now the killers' ""lovenest"" located, right. He finds himself in these woods, right? Not far from that waterfall straight up that river right? So the policeforces send out a rescue-theme to find the other victims still trapped in that dungeon-like place that the now only alive witness who has managed to escape the killer not quite can tell is a basement or a tunnel, right? (Puh, this was a long sentence, sorry! But this is such a lowpoint!). No! Instead they keep fooling around, investigating various suspects -and the girl who managed to escape becomes Lara Croft, fearless it seems! Of course they find the tunnel before the credits starts to roll, but come on! So unrealistic it's not even entertaining! A child would shake its' head over this, and it's impossible to see through the fingers here. The movie is ""butchered"", and becomes like some parody on itself. I find no excuse for this from the moviemakers -and Morgan soon must start to be more ""picky"" about the scripts they keep sending him. This is embarrassing -and a waste of time. I wanted to turn the damn movie off -and after seing the ending, well, that would've been a clever thing to do! The killer is one of those you've expected as a possibility of course. Freemans' character suddenly looks like a fool, and you don't care if the killer gets away or not!I will never watch ""Kiss The Girls"" again! A disaster!",1,No! No! No!

There is a clever &quot;bi-coastal&quot; angle to the murders under investigation (I won't spoil it with an explanation) and the police investigators do well to identify it.BUT, it's the terrible screenplay that makes the movie's flow rather jerky. So much sudden stuff happened during the course of the detective sleuthing that I couldn't help not caring towards the second half. The finale is mildly predicatable, and the last straw that identifies the killer is so knuckle-headed that it takes away from the overall smart flavor of the film.On the upside, the shooting of the killer in the denouement is pretty novel (just so you wait until the end.) Morgan Freeman maintains every bit of his general quiet-yet-powerful screen charisma, and Ashley Judd delivers a very convincing performance of a woman with spirit.The movie has a good deal of suspense too, kept me riveted. But it surely shows what bad story telling can do to an otherwise great theme.On a scale of Freeman-Judd pairings, this is much better than &quot;Along came a spider&quot; (if you've seen it) but a weaker sibling to &quot;High Crimes&quot;.Nothing you'd want to own but definitely a recommended rental!",4,"GREAT PLOT, LOUSY SCREENPLAY.

Sanders, Bill Nunn, Brian Cox, Richard T. Jones, Roma Maffia, Jeremy Piven.Running Time:  111 minutesRated R for terror, violence and language.Kiss The Girls"" is the kind of movie that starts out quite deep, but the more it progresses, the more we discover the material's lack of depth, only leaving the plot to stumble about half way though truing what could have been the next ""The Usual Suspects,"" into only a so-so, typical, moody serial killer production.  The filmmakers have cast Morgan Freeman as police detective Alex Cross, who is hot on the track of a serial killer who snatches strong willed young women and keeps them in his yet-to-be-found lair to be tortured and raped at his will. He calls himself Casanova, and wares a bizarre looking mask on his face blocking any traces of his identity. Recently, this madman has captured Cross' niece, making this one case of personal will.  Early in the film, we learn of a woman named Kate Mctiernan (played well by Ashley Judd), a kick-boxing, strong willed, independent woman who is taken from inside her own walls one night by Casanova in a disturbing and terrifying scene. This character allows us to experience the grip and fortress of Casanova through her point of view. He tells her in his dark, cave-like dungeon that he loves her dearly, and orders her not to break any of his set rules. Once a captive for a day, she leans of the other kidnapped women also present, and realizes that it is all up to her to save these people by escaping. Therefore, in a detailed and convincing sequence, Kate confronts the angry Casanova and returns his hatred with a fight that gives her the upper hand on him, and like a blind cat in New York, she stumbles out of the maze-like territory and reaches daylight, only leading her to a near dearth experience in the process.Alex Cross interviews Kate after her delicate recovery. She explains all she knows to him, and also demands that she is allowed to participate in the bust of Casanova. Their first lead is a man named Will Rudolph, who only turns out to be an apprentice of Casanova and escapes the wrath of the police during his arrest and heads back to his leader. After that, even more assistants of Casanova are discovered, a rapist who has sex with, but never hurts, any of his victims.  The film offers good performances throughout the cast, especially by Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd; both characters are developed with a state of personal willingness and precise reason. Their motives are understood. In result, the audience feels great empathy for them. The villain is developed with a personality and revilement similar to the Keyser Sose character in 1994's ""The Usual Suspects"", one of the greatest villains in film history. He is first shown through peoples' descriptions and rumors, then through dark, foggy shadows with a deep, bellowing voice, which is first heard in the tantalizing opening credits. Unfortunately, the movie takes a turn for the worst about half way though when it takes on side characters who have no purpose in the plot to distract the audience for whatever reason. The mystery loses its much tension, and the film is all down hill from there-even the somewhat predictable final twist isn't nearly as effective as it could have been due to this blemish.  Even after the movie's almost fatal second act flaw; however, it still offers scenes of suspense that work well, a villain that is well developed, an atmosphere which is occasionally spectacular and performances that are convincing and intriguing.",3,Kiss the Girls  (1997),1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3649,"['Director', 'Gary', 'FlederCast', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Alex', 'McArthur', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Jay', 'O.', 'Sanders', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Richard', 'T.', 'Jones', 'Roma', 'Maffia', 'Jeremy', 'Piven.Running', 'Time', '111', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'terror', 'violence', 'language.Kiss', 'Girls', 'kind', 'movie', 'out', 'quite', 'deep', 'more', 'more', 'discover', 'material', 'lack', 'depth', 'only', 'leaving', 'plot', 'stumble', 'half', 'way', 'truing', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'next', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'only', 'so-so', 'typical', 'moody', 'serial', 'killer', 'production', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'cast', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'police', 'detective', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'who', 'hot', 'track', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'strong', 'willed', 'young', 'women', 'yet-to-be-found', 'lair', 'be', 'tortured', 'raped', 'will', 'Casanova', 'bizarre', 'looking', 'mask', 'face', 'blocking', 'traces', 'identity', 'Recently', 'madman', 'captured', 'Cross', 'niece', 'making', 'one', 'case', 'personal', 'will', 'Early', 'film', 'learn', 'woman', 'named', 'Kate', 'Mctiernan', 'played', 'well', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'kick-boxing', 'strong', 'willed', 'independent', 'woman', 'who', 'taken', 'own', 'walls', 'one', 'night', 'Casanova', 'disturbing', 'terrifying', 'scene', 'character', 'experience', 'grip', 'fortress', 'Casanova', 'point', 'view', 'dark', 'cave-like', 'dungeon', 'dearly', 'orders', 'not', 'break', 'set', 'rules', 'Once', 'captive', 'day', 'other', 'kidnapped', 'women', 'also', 'present', 'up', 'save', 'people', 'escaping', 'Therefore', 'detailed', 'convincing', 'sequence', 'Kate', 'angry', 'Casanova', 'hatred', 'fight', 'upper', 'hand', 'blind', 'cat', 'New', 'York', 'maze-like', 'territory', 'reaches', 'daylight', 'only', 'leading', 'near', 'dearth', 'experience', 'process.Alex', 'Cross', 'interviews', 'Kate', 'delicate', 'recovery', 'also', 'allowed', 'participate', 'bust', 'Casanova', 'first', 'lead', 'man', 'named', 'Will', 'Rudolph', 'who', 'only', 'out', 'be', 'apprentice', 'Casanova', 'wrath', 'police', 'arrest', 'heads', 'back', 'leader', 'even', 'more', 'assistants', 'Casanova', 'are', 'discovered', 'rapist', 'who', 'sex', 'never', 'hurts', 'victims', 'film', 'offers', 'good', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'state', 'personal', 'willingness', 'precise', 'reason', 'motives', 'are', 'understood', 'result', 'audience', 'great', 'empathy', 'villain', 'developed', 'personality', 'revilement', 'similar', 'Keyser', 'Sose', 'character', '1994', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'one', 'greatest', 'villains', 'film', 'history', 'first', 'shown', 'peoples', 'descriptions', 'rumors', 'then', 'dark', 'foggy', 'shadows', 'deep', 'bellowing', 'voice', 'first', 'heard', 'tantalizing', 'opening', 'credits', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'turn', 'worst', 'way', 'when', 'side', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'purpose', 'plot', 'distract', 'audience', 'reason', 'mystery', 'much', 'tension', 'film', 'down', 'hill', 'there-even', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'final', 'twist', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'blemish', 'Even', 'movie', 'almost', 'fatal', 'second', 'act', 'flaw', 'however', 'still', 'scenes', 'suspense', 'work', 'well', 'villain', 'well', 'developed', 'atmosphere', 'occasionally', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'are', 'convincing', 'intriguing']",N/A

Had I seen the movie first, I would never have read a book by James Patterson!First of all, as brilliant and wonderful as Morgan Freeman is, he is sadly miscast in this movie. Alex Cross, as described in the written series, is at least 10 years younger, and looks like ""a young Ali."" He also has an entirely different personality and affect. Freeman does his usually extraordinary best, of course, but he is forced to follow an inane script that explores none of Cross's humanity, none of his soul-searching, none of his deep love for his family that causes constant conflict (the brief scene where he is consoling his sister on the disappearance of his niece Naomi does not count).Cross's dear friend John Samson, such a strong and necessary presence in the books, is now Alex's cousin, stationed in Los Angeles (not in Washington DC, with Alex), and only peripherally involved with Cross's life. There is none of the hilarious repartee between the two, none of the incredible bond that has kept them together since childhood.Ashley Judd tries hard, but she is no Kate Tiernan, and the story is changed to such an extent that the viewer has no idea of the inner strength it takes Kate to help Alex track the killer after having escaped his lair. In fact, she's only in the lair a brief time, and none of the real horror of what happened to her at the hands of the would-be killer comes across. In fact, THIS Kate clearly states that she was not raped, hardly the case in the book.Casanova's twin in crime, the West Coast's Gentleman Caller, appears, but the circumstances between the two killers are so muddled that, had I not read the book, I'm not sure I would have fully understood the connection between them. The unmasking of the eventual killer comes as a disappointment, where it was a true shock in the book.I gave this movie two stars in homage to Morgan Freeman, who didn't deserve the poor script, the shoddy editing, the lackluster photography, and everything else that made this a bad movie. My advice to those who haven't read the book: Please do do before seeing this movie. For those who HAVE read the book: Get Alex Cross out of your mind.
