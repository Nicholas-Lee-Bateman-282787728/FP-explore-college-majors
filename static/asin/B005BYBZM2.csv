1453359,A3D1W9DU4XB30Q,B005BYBZM2,Bobby,"[0, 0]","The found footage genre can be quite the mixed bag. For every ""Rec"" we seem to get two films that end up as bad as ""The Devil Inside"". Sadly ""Atrocious"" is closer to the latter.Two siblings (Cristian and July) like to investigate urban legends and tape them in the process. When the family takes a trip to creepy old house with a creepy past (and an even creepier labyrinth outside), the two start their investigation that they'll wish they never started.Doesn't sound too bad right? Well, sadly the premise is about as good as it gets here. What could've been a very suspenseful and even claustrophobic addition to the found footage genre, just ends up a slightly tedious one instead. It's only 73 minutes, but it still manages to be a bit slow, and it takes a while to get going. Found footage films rely on their suspenseful buildups that lead to their spooky endings, but I truly didn't find the film to be all that suspenseful. I mean the Labryrinth was a great idea, and eerie in itself, but even that never fully lived up to it's potential. I actually thought the setting was more effective during the day scenes oddly enough. Once nightfalls, the setting is used for alot of panic, alot of heavy breathing, and alot of camera shaking. It's too bad.The film finally reaches it's conclusion, and it's mildly creepy I suppose, but not enough to make up for the faults that led up to it. As for the acting? Not too bad. The characters are supposed to seem ""real"", and for the most part they do. Sure they make unrealistic decisions (you'll wonder often why they're still holding on to their cameras) , but their acting isn't too bad.Overrall ""Atrocious"" isn't the worst of it's kind, and it may mildly interest people who love the found footage genre.

1453365,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,B005BYBZM2,Jeremy Storly,"[3, 4]","To start with, the first half of this film is very slow.  You will wonder what is happening, and what is the point of all of this.  In fact, it is truly like watching someone's home videos from 1995 -- very amateur, very boring.Yet, this is what makes this film succeed in the end.  These are truly human characters without any of the Hollywood tricks.  They are real; either you sympathize with them, or you don't.  End of story.  If you don't, you give this movie a one-star review and go on about your business.  But if you do, the suspense will grow on you gradually, creep up on you from behind, until you find yourself checking the windows and doors to make sure they are locked.When it comes to this kind of movie, I am no easy customer.  Only Carpenter's _Halloween_ and Kubrick's _The_Shining_ have affected me.  _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ (the iconic found-footage film) scared me the first time, but by the second viewing, I was hoping for the annoyingly contrived characters to be killed.  Even after several viewings, _Atrocious_ has retained its intended effect.  It is a well-crafted thriller that may seem tame by today's standards, but which creates an authentic atmosphere of horror and suspense unparalleled by few movies released in the past few years.Is it perfect?  No.  Even though it achieves its intended effect, it really needs something to draw the attention of its audience much earlier in the film.  I suspect most negative reviews are written by reviewers who only saw the first half.  Do yourself a favor and watch the entire film, then let's hear what you think.

1453366,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B005BYBZM2,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[0, 1]","We have another entry into the found footage horror genre, from the files of the Spanish police department comes this one where a family goes to a house in El Garraf surrounded by woods. There's a story about a young girl who got lost in an old labyrinth near said house. After hearing from a friend that there are varying versions of this old legend, they decide to film everything. They being Cristian and his sister July, they film using two handheld cameras to capture any sort of hauntings and images in this old house and it's surroundings.Well of course at first things seem fine, Cristian and July even explore this labyrinth during the day soon after arriving at the house. Of course like fools they get lost for a bit, then soon after things get weird, their dad doesn't want them in that place and to only film inside the house. Things get evern stranger when figures start appearing around at night, violence of course occurs but none of this ever warrants either Cristian or July putting down their camera or gasp turn it off and run for safety.The problems with ""Atrocious"" are plentiful, namely how for a good long while the kids just wander around, checking out the woods, the house especially the basement that has a lot of their old stuff from when they were younger. The shaky camera style of filming really puts off the viewer after a while, in fact it makes the movie feel very amateurish very quickly.The idea behind the movie isn't a bad one, if not fairly typical but even at 75 minutes this movie drags on for the first half. The Spanish setting and dialogue try to lend a different feel to this material but it doesn't work, at least for too long. Like most 'found footage' horror films and most horror films in general, ""Atrocious"" relies on the characters making very stupid decisions when they should maybe just leave during the day.Too many times during the night shots and during the scary moments I was saying out loud, ""Okay, yes?

1453372,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005BYBZM2,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Shot in the ""The Blair Witch Project""-like first-person POV style, ""Atrocious"" centers on the Quintanilla family of five, whose horrifying experiences at their summer house in Sitges are recorded in handheld video cameras. There is one good idea in ""Atrocious,"" but it is not enough to save this Spanish low-budget film from being another forgettable entry in the overcrowded horror subgenre of found-footage thriller.Christian and July, a brother and sister making a web show about urban legends, investigate a local legend of a ghost girl named Melinda, while staying at the family's country house. What follows is a series of familiar horror devices including a barking dog and a disused well, except the final fifteen minutes.The 75-minute film has several creepy moments, to be sure, but they are few and far between. Writer and director Fernando Barreda Luna knows how to enhance suspense, but achieved only limited success, as the film spends too much time trying to set up the atmosphere. The film's first half includes scenes of the protagonist wandering in the deserted hedge labyrinth and woods, which are disorienting at first, but then gets boring.Filmmakers of ""Atrocious"" seem to rely too much on the idea I mentioned above, a genre-bending attempt that might have worked as a short film. I will not disclose what it is here. I only add that being stretched beyond its limit, this idea does not have enough substance to stand as a feature film, which ""Atrocious"" strives to be.",2,Not Enough Substance to Stand as a Feature Film,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,1492,"['Shot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'first-person', 'POV', 'style', 'Atrocious', 'centers', 'Quintanilla', 'family', 'five', 'horrifying', 'experiences', 'summer', 'house', 'Sitges', 'are', 'recorded', 'handheld', 'video', 'cameras', 'one', 'good', 'idea', 'Atrocious', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'Spanish', 'low-budget', 'film', 'being', 'forgettable', 'entry', 'overcrowded', 'horror', 'subgenre', 'found-footage', 'thriller.Christian', 'July', 'brother', 'sister', 'making', 'web', 'show', 'urban', 'legends', 'investigate', 'local', 'legend', 'ghost', 'girl', 'named', 'Melinda', 'staying', 'family', 'country', 'house', 'What', 'series', 'familiar', 'horror', 'devices', 'including', 'barking', 'dog', 'disused', 'well', 'final', 'fifteen', 'minutes.The', '75-minute', 'film', 'several', 'creepy', 'moments', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Writer', 'director', 'Fernando', 'Barreda', 'Luna', 'how', 'enhance', 'suspense', 'achieved', 'only', 'limited', 'success', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'scenes', 'protagonist', 'wandering', 'deserted', 'hedge', 'labyrinth', 'woods', 'are', 'disorienting', 'first', 'then', 'boring.Filmmakers', 'Atrocious', 'seem', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'idea', 'mentioned', 'above', 'genre-bending', 'attempt', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'short', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'disclose', 'what', 'here', 'only', 'add', 'being', 'stretched', 'limit', 'idea', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'substance', 'stand', 'feature', 'film', 'Atrocious', 'be']",Atrocious

Not because of how it was shot, but due to the content.....2/3 of this movie felt like I was watching someone's boring home videos. A lot of it was just obvious filler....minute after minute of absolutley unnecessary nothing that simply killed time and didn't move the story along or was drawn out too long. There's literally 10 minutes straight of just someone running around in the dark, all you see is the camera's view with the light hitting the trees randomly and you hear someone panting. It's a looong stretch of film that's just this and this alone. This movie has a cool twist at the end, but not cool enough to make it worth the watch. This is one of those movies you start watching, realize it's boring, hang in there hoping it gets better, but it doesn't, and you struggle with yourself. Should I see it through or turn it off? Don't even bother wasting your time to get to that point! I want my 1.25 hours back! Not scary, boring, full of useless stuff to kill time to turn this into a 'movie'.
