To a certain extent, they are right. Although Last Holiday is full of contrivances and week plot points, the film is an absolute showcase for the lovely Latifa, and really does illustrate her at her very best.Directed by Wayne Wang, the film is also a lovely and sensitive homage to good food, fine wine, and making sure you get the most out of life. Queen Latifa plays Georgia Byrd, a clerk cookware in Kragen's department store in New Orleans. She likes to cook exotic meals but only eats Lean Cuisine.She's a reserved and rather timid woman and who is in love with a fellow clerk, hunky Sean Matthews (LL Cool J), but is too shy to connect with him. Her sales are the highest, she's the most beloved staff member, the most organized, professional and humane, and of course the least recognized.Bad news comes in the form of a death sentence when a routine CAT scan indicates she has only three weeks left to live. Upset, but determined to remake her life, she quits her job - much to the chagrin of her priggish boss - cashes in her stocks and IRA and flies to the Czech Republic, actually to the ski-and-spa town of Karlovy Vary. Amidst the splendors of this snow covered, old world resort, she bathes herself in luxury and mingles with the rich habitu?s of such a milieu.She befriends a group of rich congressmen including the vacationing Louisiana senator (Giancarlo Esposito), an evil retail magnate (Timothy Hutton) and his adoring mistress (Alicia Witt). Everyone begins to believe that she's a ""somebody."" She also connects with hotel chef (Gerard Depardieu). It seems as though impending death as liberated her with everyone at the hotel, staff and guests falling in love with her as she blossoms with charisma, wisdom, proficiency, courage and grace.The plot is predictable, and the ending comes as no surprise, but the charm of the film is Queen Latifa's winning performance as Georgia. She has a calm beauty and a kind of charming harmony that manages to inspire and rise about the somewhat trite and sentimental material. Along the way the movie attempts to make comments about the evils of corporate greed, the political corruption and there's a kind of average expression of human decency.Last Holiday is never either terribly funny or terribly dramatic, but Latifa's quiet solidity and the fact that she plays such an ordinary person faced with such extraordinary circumstances make us root for the film in ways that larger, louder pictures never manage to achieve.

This movie, thankfully, keeps a wonderful human tone to its characters.Georgia Byrd (to quickly sum up the synopsis you know already) has just been informed that she is about to die. Her life is flipped upside down, even to the point where she turns the churches praise meeting into a ""Why God Why?"" moment. The humanity keeps a smile on your face, the way everyone is nervous when they are supposed to be, particularly in love matters. The way Georgia enjoys cooking, but doesn't eat it. (The neighbor boy has that honor.) Also the blunt truth that Georgia is suddenly able to vocalize once she realizes, ""Hey, I am about to die, might as well say what I think.""  I believe there is a lesson there for myself I know. Sometimes we sugarcoat don't we?Last Holiday is a chick flick by definition.

642774,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JOSG,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","`Last Holiday', the remake of the 1950 film, has its moments of pure funny, but in the end the one thing I remember most about this film is its heart.  Like I've mentioned before, Queen Latifah makes anything worth watching.  I just love what she brings to a film and here is no exception; in fact her charm and grace is probably exemplified here more than any other film.  As Georgia Byrd she is warm and endearing and finds a place in our hearts from the moment she appears on screen.Many probably already know the premise of this film.  Georgia is a department store employee who has lived a life filled with missed opportunities.  She secretly desires fellow employee Sean Matthews but lacks the courage to pursue him.  She desires to make something of herself, become a chef; own a restaurant, but she still remains employed to the same jerk of a boss at the same prison of an establishment.  And then she bumps her head, and come to find out, she is going to die.  With this news she decides to take all her money and go on a well deserved holiday.She flies out to a beautiful resort in Europe with the plans to spend every last cent on treating herself to the luxuries she was always afraid to experience.  She throws caution to the wind and lives what's left of her life to the full.  This attracts the attention of a few of the resorts guests, including Matthew Kragen, the man who owns the chain of department stores Georgia worked for.  His paranoia over who Georgia may or may not be leads to some of the films funnier moments.The Queen really delivers here, but doesn't she always.  The supporting players all do a fine job as well.  I expected to see more of LL, but when he's on the screen you can't look away.  Alicia Witt (I just love this girl) does a great job as well.  I wish that she would land some better roles though; she seems to be sorely underused.  Gerard Depardieu is great, as usual, and Susan Kellerman is hilarious as the nosey maid Gunther.  Oscar winner Timothy Hutton plays his paranoid, self absorbed jerk of a character very well.  It's nice to see him; it's been a while.I fully enjoyed myself while watching `Last Holiday'.  It's a movie that, while we all know the ending before the movie has even begun, we can still become attached to the characters and feel the warmest sympathies for them.  Like I mentioned, this is not a laugh riot of a film.  The Queen's previous films (`Bringing Down the House' and `Taxi' come to mind) are more laugh out loud funny then this one, but its warmth help add layers to the film and make for a very well rounded and memorable movie experience.",4,Subdued comedy that targets the heart over the funny-bone...,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2622,"['Last', 'Holiday', 'remake', '1950', 'film', 'moments', 'pure', 'funny', 'end', 'one', 'thing', 'remember', 'most', 'film', 'heart', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'anything', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'love', 'what', 'film', 'here', 'exception', 'fact', 'charm', 'grace', 'probably', 'exemplified', 'here', 'more', 'other', 'film', 'Georgia', 'Byrd', 'warm', 'endearing', 'place', 'hearts', 'moment', 'screen.Many', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'premise', 'film', 'Georgia', 'department', 'store', 'employee', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'filled', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'secretly', 'fellow', 'employee', 'Sean', 'Matthews', 'courage', 'pursue', 'make', 'something', 'herself', 'become', 'chef', 'own', 'restaurant', 'still', 'employed', 'same', 'jerk', 'boss', 'same', 'prison', 'establishment', 'then', 'bumps', 'head', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'going', 'die', 'news', 'take', 'money', 'go', 'well', 'deserved', 'holiday.She', 'out', 'beautiful', 'resort', 'Europe', 'plans', 'spend', 'last', 'cent', 'treating', 'luxuries', 'was', 'always', 'afraid', 'experience', 'caution', 'wind', 'what', 'left', 'life', 'full', 'attention', 'few', 'resorts', 'guests', 'including', 'Matthew', 'Kragen', 'man', 'who', 'chain', 'department', 'stores', 'Georgia', 'worked', 'paranoia', 'who', 'Georgia', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'leads', 'films', 'funnier', 'moments.The', 'Queen', 'really', 'here', ""n't"", 'always', 'supporting', 'players', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'expected', 'see', 'more', 'LL', 'when', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'just', 'love', 'girl', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'wish', 'would', 'land', 'better', 'roles', 'be', 'sorely', 'underused', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'great', 'usual', 'Susan', 'Kellerman', 'hilarious', 'nosey', 'maid', 'Gunther', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'paranoid', 'absorbed', 'jerk', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'nice', 'see', 'been', 'while.I', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Last', 'Holiday', 'movie', 'know', 'ending', 'movie', 'even', 'begun', 'can', 'still', 'become', 'attached', 'characters', 'feel', 'warmest', 'sympathies', 'mentioned', 'not', 'laugh', 'riot', 'film', 'Queen', 'previous', 'films', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'Taxi', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'more', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'then', 'one', 'warmth', 'help', 'add', 'layers', 'film', 'make', 'very', 'well', 'rounded', 'memorable', 'movie', 'experience']",N/A

From the moment one meets the characters and knows the premise, it's possible to predict nearly every scene that will follow.But it doesn't matter.Here's the thing about formula: Formulas exist because when they work, they WORK. And Last Holiday works as few comedies of the last five years have. It's warm, sweet and genuinely funny, with solid performances in roles that, in countless other films and TV shows, have been flat and just awful.Even the rating is old-fashioned: Queen Latifah's Georgia Byrd not only doesn't swear, she won't stand for it and stops everyone around her from doing it. (Although the s-word does show up in a deleted scene on the disc.) This treat of a comedy is family friendly on top of everything else.

642802,A3PJMHXLUODF6K,B00005JOSG,C. Troxter,"[4, 31]","I just got around to seeing it last night.  It never fails.  This is one of those films that I put on the back burner when it first came out because it just did not look right.  Everytime I do that to one of these types of films, it turns out that they were not must-see films.  This one is clearly not good.First, the ""story"" opens up without ANY type of set or explanation of who the cahracters are, what their feelings are, what they are are all about and you end up not having any feeling for them because you do not know them.  The director(who needs a different career!) just jumps right into the film expecting you to have feelings for the characters.  The ONLY thing that you know about these characters is that they are Queen Latifah and LL Cool J!  I guess that is all the producers were betting on to make a quick buck.QL's character was 'supposed' to be a stiff, striagh and narrow woman who is in love with LL.  However, as in all of her films, she is never in character and is still sounding ghetto even though she is supposed to be proper type woman.  You don't know that she was in love with LL (just a scrapbook which she looked more like a sick stalker than in love) and you certainly did not get the feeling that LL was in love with her, let alone even liking her like that.QL's acting sucked.  I have not seen CHicago, but I cannot understand how her acting could have been nominated for an Academy Award.  Even the horrible Will Smith's acting is better!  She continues to use her oh so cliche 'jokes' that only she seems to find funny.  A decent actress would have pulled it off better, but the directing, screenplay and editing could not save this film.  WHere the actors fail, the production fails even more.  Now I know why there are directors and then their are directors who specialze in comedey.  It clearly takes more than calling yourself a director to pull off a movie, let alone a comedy.Yes, the timing was oof for everyone.  Characters are talked about and then never seen again.  When you do see one again (mamely LL), you forgot that he was in the film also.  LL's acting was probaly one of his best as he did not seem like LL Cool J, but his poor character, script and screenplay ruined anything that could been.You know QL is going to die, but you really did not feel bad for her because th eproducers did a poor job of setting up the characters and bringing the audience into their world that when you hear the news, you really don't care if she is going to die or not.  In fact, there was not one charater who you would be concerned about, except maybe the Chef.The movie was filmed in teh Czech Republic, I assumed because of the low cost.  Like someone who is going to blow ALL of their money because they are going to die thinks ""I will go to the world famous and always beautiful Czech Republic!""  Not Egypt, Rome, Paris, the Carribean, Hawaii - the usual spots.Al in all, this movie was not interesting.  It was boring because of the production.  This is why the most important part of a film is the story.  If you get that wrong, you don't have a movie.  The screenplay was horrible and this movie is not one for the collection, unless you are a female.  I never once got the feeling that they loved each other and I NEVER got the feeling that LL's character even like QL more than a co-worker.  They should have had me on teh job to clean this up.  Even some decent advisors would have worked.

Who would have thought, all those years ago, that this young female rapper would someday absolutely light up the screen and connect with audiences in a way few actresses can match?  She's simply wonderful in the role of Georgia Byrd, a character that so many of us can identify with.  Georgia is ""just folks,"" a kind and caring woman who has spent her whole life waiting for something big to happen, too shy and afraid to do anything more than maintain a scrapbook of ""possibilities"" - places she wants to go, things she wants to do, and the man she wants to be with.  Just as she is beginning to come to terms with her suddenly thirty-something life, Fate comes up and punches her right in the mouth.  Not only is she dying of a rare disease, she only has three or four weeks to live.Rather than lie down and wait for death, Georgia decides to live her last days to the fullest.  Cashing in all of her assets, she jets off to the spectacular Grandhotel Pupp in Karlovy Vary (in the Czech Republic), where she lives like a queen in the Presidential Suite, dines in the restaurant of the famous Chef Didier (Gerard Depardieu), and embraces activities such as snowboarding and base jumping.  Almost immediately, she becomes the talk of the town.  Hotel staff marvel at such an obviously wealthy woman actually treating them with kindness and respect, while some of the other guests try to find out who she is and (in the case of a few) what she is up to.  Among those other guests are Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton), the owner of the retail store Georgia worked at (whose profits-only management style rubbed her entirely the wrong way - and didn't exactly boost profits, either), an important Congressman, and one of her own state's U.S. senators.  Along for the ride, as well, is the striking Alicia Witt as Kragen's mistress.  Last but not least is Sean Matthews (LL Cool J), Georgia's former co-worker and all-around man of her dreams, who comes to play a profound role of his own in Georgia's life.  As for Kragen, who really is a loathsome creature, he's suspicious of this nouveau riche stranger who seems to enchant everyone around him, from Chef Didier to the political cronies with whom he is trying to pave the way for a major new acquisition.  Suspecting her of trying to sabotage his pending deal, he sets out to prove that he is far more equal than she is.  All of these diverse characters' lives will be changed forever by Georgia's interaction with them.Last Holiday is a romance, drama, and comedy all rolled into one - and it has a unique effect on the viewer.  While the movie is genuinely funny throughout, the dark shadow of this wonderful character's impending death hangs over every shining moment.  Personally, the movie made me feel a little bit unsettled; I couldn't stand the thought of this wonderful character dying.  It isn't every movie that can make you laugh with a lump in your throat, but Last Holiday can make you do just that.  I give a lot of credit to the writers, as they tie every little plot element together beautifully.Those with a passion for the gourmet may be interested in knowing that all of the ritzy food dishes seen in this movie were prepared by chefs from the Food Network, and the recipes for each of the featured dishes were posted on the Food Network web site - I don't figure this Southern boy is going to get a hankerin' for Spiced Lamb Shanks with Blood Orange Relish any time soon, but I'll know where to look if the urge hits me.The important thing is that you watch this movie.  It doesn't just make you laugh or cry, it gives you a new appreciation for life and the inspiration to get off your duff and start living - and to treat others with respect while you're doing it.",5,"A truly wonderful, heartwarming, meaningful film",1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,4038,"['Everyone', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'give', 'Last', 'Holiday', 'anything', 'less', 'five', 'stars', 'good', 'good', 'movie', 'story', 'casting', 'settings', 'are', 'just', 'dead-on', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'really', 'movie', 'special', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'years', 'ago', 'young', 'female', 'rapper', 'would', 'someday', 'absolutely', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'connect', 'audiences', 'way', 'few', 'actresses', 'can', 'match', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Georgia', 'Byrd', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'can', 'identify', 'Georgia', 'just', 'folks', 'kind', 'caring', 'woman', 'who', 'spent', 'whole', 'life', 'waiting', 'something', 'big', 'happen', 'too', 'shy', 'afraid', 'do', 'anything', 'more', 'maintain', 'scrapbook', 'possibilities', 'go', 'things', 'do', 'man', 'be', 'Just', 'beginning', 'come', 'terms', 'suddenly', 'thirty-something', 'life', 'Fate', 'up', 'punches', 'right', 'mouth', 'Not', 'only', 'dying', 'rare', 'disease', 'only', 'three', 'four', 'weeks', 'live.Rather', 'lie', 'down', 'wait', 'death', 'Georgia', 'live', 'last', 'days', 'fullest', 'Cashing', 'assets', 'spectacular', 'Grandhotel', 'Pupp', 'Karlovy', 'Vary', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'where', 'queen', 'Presidential', 'Suite', 'dines', 'restaurant', 'famous', 'Chef', 'Didier', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'activities', 'such', 'snowboarding', 'base', 'jumping', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'talk', 'town', 'Hotel', 'staff', 'marvel', 'obviously', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'actually', 'treating', 'kindness', 'respect', 'other', 'guests', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'case', 'few', 'what', 'up', 'other', 'guests', 'are', 'Matthew', 'Kragen', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'owner', 'retail', 'store', 'Georgia', 'worked', 'profits-only', 'management', 'style', 'rubbed', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'boost', 'profits', 'either', 'important', 'Congressman', 'one', 'own', 'state', 'U.S.', 'senators', 'ride', 'as', 'well', 'striking', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'Kragen', 'mistress', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Sean', 'Matthews', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'Georgia', 'former', 'co-worker', 'all-around', 'man', 'dreams', 'who', 'play', 'profound', 'role', 'own', 'Georgia', 'life', 'Kragen', 'who', 'really', 'loathsome', 'creature', 'suspicious', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'stranger', 'who', 'enchant', 'everyone', 'Chef', 'Didier', 'political', 'cronies', 'whom', 'trying', 'pave', 'way', 'major', 'new', 'acquisition', 'Suspecting', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'pending', 'deal', 'out', 'prove', 'far', 'more', 'equal', 'diverse', 'characters', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'changed', 'forever', 'Georgia', 'interaction', 'them.Last', 'Holiday', 'romance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'rolled', 'one', 'unique', 'effect', 'viewer', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'dark', 'shadow', 'wonderful', 'character', 'impending', 'death', 'hangs', 'shining', 'moment', 'Personally', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'unsettled', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'thought', 'wonderful', 'character', 'dying', ""n't"", 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'lump', 'throat', 'Last', 'Holiday', 'can', 'make', 'do', 'just', 'give', 'lot', 'credit', 'writers', 'tie', 'little', 'plot', 'element', 'together', 'beautifully.Those', 'passion', 'gourmet', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'ritzy', 'food', 'dishes', 'seen', 'movie', 'were', 'prepared', 'chefs', 'Food', 'Network', 'recipes', 'featured', 'dishes', 'were', 'posted', 'Food', 'Network', 'web', 'site', 'do', ""n't"", 'figure', 'Southern', 'boy', 'going', 'get', 'hankerin', 'Spiced', 'Lamb', 'Shanks', 'Blood', 'Orange', 'Relish', 'time', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'know', 'where', 'look', 'urge', 'me.The', 'important', 'thing', 'watch', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'cry', 'new', 'appreciation', 'life', 'inspiration', 'get', 'off', 'duff', 'start', 'living', 'treat', 'others', 'respect', ""'re"", 'doing']",N/A

Things begin to change when Georgia is diagnosed with an incurable illness. Told that she has mere weeks to live, Georgia decides to live it up for once in her life, before she dies.  Withdrawing her substantial life's savings, she heads off to Europe, transforming herself along the way from nondescript wallflower to assertive blossom that everyone seems magically drawn to.  Installing herself in a swanky hotel where she is swathed in luxury for the first time in her life, Georgia naturally learns quite a few things about herself.  She acquires a striking new wardrobe, goes snowboarding, indulges in expensive spa treatments and gourmet food.  ""Last Holiday"" is chock full of messages about the seductive power of appearances, cherishing and living every moment of life to the fullest, being true to oneself, yada yada.  As such, the movie is almost too sweet and terribly trite, saved only by the infectious charm of Queen Latifah's naturally warm, relaxed screen presence. Unexpected appearances by LL Cool J and Gerard Depardieu also give the picture some amusing heft.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","LAST HOLIDAY is formulaic, predictable, and often as uneven as my hairline, but Queen Latifah makes it fun to watch.  Her character, soft-spoken Georgia Byrd, a department store food sample cook with an eye for exquisite cuisine, learns she has a fatal illness (with only weeks to live!); so she cashes in her retirement savings and flies to Europe to be pampered at a posh 5-star ski resort.  (And if I learned I had just weeks to live and I felt good I would definitely do something similar, but I digress.)  Because she throws caution to the wind and spares no expense, the other guests assume she's a mega-rich tycoon of some sort, including her former (evil) boss (Timothy Hutton), and his more-than-just-an-executive assistant (Alicia Witt).  Of course she charms the socks off one and all (but that's Queen Latifah to a tee), including the resort's world-renowned chef (Gerard Depardieu), before her dreadful secret is outed, the plot takes a (predictably) positive turn, and all is rainbows and kittens.Queen Latifah carries the film admirably on her voluptuous shoulders, with a quiet dignity and charm.  Hutton makes a good villain and Depardieu is more than amusing.  LL Cool J also makes a few appearances as Georgia's budding love interest, yet has a dickens of a time getting to the resort himself.  Again, it's too long, often silly, very predictable with a splash of contrived, but overall Queen Latifah makes LAST HOLIDAY palatable.  Bon appetit!--D.

When she learns that she only has a limited amount of time to live, Georgia decides to stop playing it safe and take a few risks for once in her life.  She cashes out all of her investments and savings and decides to travel to a remote villa frequented by the rich and famous.  When everyone around her assumes that she is one of these mysterious millionaires, she goes along with it and continues to blow her money trying to fulfill a lifetime of hopes and dreams in a limited amount of time.This movie is filled with excellent intentions, but the follow through is shaky at best.  It's hard to take Georgia seriously when she gives others advice about living their life to the fullest when it took a knock on the head for her to realize how miserable she was.  Furthermore, it's also doubtful that anyone would realistically take every cent they had and try to blow it all on ridiculous things like a new wardrobe (you're dying, you won't get to wear half of it), ordering 6 entrees at the most expensive restaurant you can find (you can't eat it all, and I doubt duck reheats very well in a hotel room) and any of the other extravagant purchases made by Georgia in her last days.

642860,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JOSG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","I well remember Alec Guinesss and Kay Walsh in the original version of ""Last Holiday.""  But when I watched this 2006 remake I was anticipating a happier ending than the first time around, not only because this is an American production rather than a British one, but more so because Queen Latifah is in the lead role.  She is such an appealing person on screen, a woman who knows full well that attitude is the whole ball game.  Consequently, she makes up for the faults of this film and makes this an enjoyable remake of a film that a lot of people have strong affection for (in other words, if you know the original you probably will not like this one more, but you will not be offended by the attempt).Queen Latifah plays Georgia Byrd.  She works in the cooking ware section of a national department chain store in New Orleans (one unaffected by Hurricane Katrina).  She has taught herself to be a gourmet chef, but she makes her fancy meals for Darius (Jascha Washington), the kid who lives next door, while she diets on Lean Cuisine.  Georgia photographs her meals for her Book of Possibilities, which includes a photograph of a bride and groom on which she has pasted her face and that of Sean Matthews (LL Cool J), another clerk at the store.  Not that Georgia does anything more proactive than paste her dreams in her book.Then Georgia bumps her head and in the course of getting a CAT-scan from the previously owned machine the store has acquired she is informed by the doctors that she has a rare and fatal disease.  In three weeks time she will be dead.  When Sean offers her tickets for a basketball game next month, it is too little too late and what she sees as being the first of several grim jokes played on her by God.  So Georgia cashes in her 401-K and everything else she has to go to a gorgeous spa hotel in Prague where she can meet her hero, Chef Didier (Gerard Depardieu).  On the way to Europe she decides she might as well go out in style, and that means upgrading everything from her seat on the plane to the best suite at the Grand Hotel Pupp.  It also means trying everything, from expensive clothes (she looks great in purple) and strange spa treatments to snowboarding and trying everything on the menu.As in the original, Georgia is assumed to be on of the beautiful people by those who would never pay attention to her back home.  Although set in the Czech Republic, Georgia finds a bunch of people from back home.  Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton) is the rich guy who owns the store and Senator Dillings (Giancarlo Esposito) is a U.S. Senator from Louisiana, who failed to show up for services at her church like he promised.  Ms. Burns (Alicia Witt) is Kragen's mistress and Congressman Stewart (Michael Nouri) is there to meet with Kragen and Dillings for some shady business deal that needs Congressional approval.  It is strange that Georgia travels to Europe to meet a bunch of Ugly Americans, but it matters because even if they do not know her, she knows them, and speaking truth to power is not longer one of her problems.Screenwriters Peter S. Seaman & Jeffrey Price, who scored with ""Whose Afraid of Roger Rabbit"" but also have ""Wild Wild West"" on their resumes, get some of the credit too (they worked on the script for 23 years, which apparently helped).  There were two things they did that I especially liked.  The first was having Georgia arrived at the hotel in a helicopter, which created an instant buzz about her, to get the ball rolling on the plot.  The other was a sublime little twist when the villain hires the Teutonic Gunther (Susan Kellermann), to go through Georgia's hotel room to discover her secret.  Gunther learns both of Georgia's secrets and it indeed changes everything, but not the way we expect.  Nice moment, guys.  I did think they could come up with something better for the big climax at the end, especially given that they just let midnight on New Year's Eve pass to focus on the villain instead of the heroine, but by that point the requisite happy ending is inevitable and what we want for Georgia, so that is all that really matters.",4,"Queen Latifah, living large but apparently not long at the Grant Hotel Pupp",1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,4112,"['well', 'remember', 'Alec', 'Guinesss', 'Kay', 'Walsh', 'original', 'version', 'Last', 'Holiday', 'when', 'watched', '2006', 'remake', 'was', 'anticipating', 'happier', 'ending', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'not', 'only', 'American', 'production', 'rather', 'British', 'one', 'more', 'so', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'lead', 'role', 'such', 'appealing', 'person', 'screen', 'woman', 'who', 'full', 'well', 'attitude', 'whole', 'ball', 'game', 'Consequently', 'up', 'faults', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'remake', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'strong', 'affection', 'other', 'words', 'know', 'original', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'one', 'more', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'offended', 'attempt', '.Queen', 'Latifah', 'Georgia', 'Byrd', 'cooking', 'ware', 'section', 'national', 'department', 'chain', 'store', 'New', 'Orleans', 'one', 'unaffected', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'taught', 'be', 'gourmet', 'chef', 'fancy', 'meals', 'Darius', 'Jascha', 'Washington', 'kid', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'Lean', 'Cuisine', 'Georgia', 'photographs', 'meals', 'Book', 'Possibilities', 'photograph', 'bride', 'groom', 'pasted', 'face', 'Sean', 'Matthews', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'clerk', 'store', 'Not', 'Georgia', 'anything', 'more', 'proactive', 'paste', 'dreams', 'book.Then', 'Georgia', 'head', 'course', 'getting', 'CAT-scan', 'previously', 'owned', 'machine', 'store', 'acquired', 'informed', 'doctors', 'rare', 'fatal', 'disease', 'three', 'weeks', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'When', 'Sean', 'tickets', 'basketball', 'game', 'next', 'month', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'what', 'being', 'first', 'several', 'grim', 'jokes', 'played', 'God', 'So', 'Georgia', 'cashes', '401-K', 'everything', 'else', 'go', 'gorgeous', 'spa', 'hotel', 'Prague', 'where', 'can', 'meet', 'hero', 'Chef', 'Didier', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'way', 'Europe', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'go', 'out', 'style', 'upgrading', 'everything', 'seat', 'plane', 'best', 'suite', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Pupp', 'also', 'trying', 'everything', 'expensive', 'clothes', 'great', 'purple', 'strange', 'spa', 'treatments', 'snowboarding', 'trying', 'everything', 'menu.As', 'original', 'Georgia', 'assumed', 'be', 'beautiful', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'pay', 'attention', 'back', 'home', 'set', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'Georgia', 'bunch', 'people', 'back', 'home', 'Matthew', 'Kragen', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'rich', 'guy', 'who', 'store', 'Senator', 'Dillings', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'Louisiana', 'who', 'failed', 'show', 'up', 'services', 'church', 'promised', 'Ms.', 'Burns', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'Kragen', 'mistress', 'Congressman', 'Stewart', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'there', 'meet', 'Kragen', 'Dillings', 'shady', 'business', 'deal', 'Congressional', 'approval', 'strange', 'Georgia', 'Europe', 'meet', 'bunch', 'Ugly', 'Americans', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'speaking', 'truth', 'power', 'not', 'longer', 'one', 'problems.Screenwriters', 'Peter', 'S.', 'Seaman', 'Jeffrey', 'Price', 'who', 'scored', 'Whose', 'Afraid', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'also', 'have', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'resumes', 'get', 'credit', 'too', 'worked', 'script', '23', 'years', 'apparently', 'helped', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'did', 'especially', 'liked', 'first', 'was', 'having', 'Georgia', 'arrived', 'hotel', 'helicopter', 'created', 'instant', 'buzz', 'get', 'ball', 'rolling', 'plot', 'other', 'was', 'sublime', 'little', 'twist', 'when', 'villain', 'Teutonic', 'Gunther', 'Susan', 'Kellermann', 'go', 'Georgia', 'hotel', 'room', 'discover', 'secret', 'Gunther', 'Georgia', 'secrets', 'indeed', 'everything', 'not', 'way', 'expect', 'Nice', 'moment', 'guys', 'did', 'think', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'big', 'climax', 'end', 'especially', 'given', 'just', 'let', 'midnight', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'pass', 'focus', 'villain', 'instead', 'heroine', 'point', 'requisite', 'happy', 'ending', 'inevitable', 'what', 'want', 'Georgia', 'really', 'matters']",N/A

642872,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B00005JOSG,Mark,"[0, 0]","To quote Richard Roeper on last week's show: ""This movie was better than it had any right to be.""  This statement is one hundred percent accurate.  With any other combination, be it writing, directing, or acting, this film could have been horrible and so overdone.  But with the sweet and warm-hearted Queen Latifah in the role, the film becomes lovable.  Yes, at many points, this film is pretty cliche, and we have all seen these conventions in other films before.  But Latifah sparkles and lights up every scene so that we can't help but like this movie and sympathize with her character.  Latifah plays Georgia Byrd (in the original, Alec Guinness is the lead role, playing George Bird), a cookware demonstrator and saleswoman at a local Louisiana retail store, run by retail tycoon Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton).  She secretly has a crush on Shawn Williams (LL Cool J) and vice versa.  She is pushed around by her abnoxious boss Adamian (Matt Ross).  During a scene in which Shawn is eating some of the food Georgia prepares for the customers, she stands up quickly and hits her head on the cabinet door.  She is given a CAT scan by Dr. Gupta (Ranjit Chowdhry in very funny, but cliche, role) and he determines that she has Lampington's disease (a disease that apparently causes brain tumors) and has about three weeks to live.  So, Georgia takes all of the predictable steps: she quits her job, smashes her boss' cell phone, cashes in her savings bonds and travels to Hotel Pupp (they really say it that way?), a large resort in  Karlovy Vary, a small area in the Czech Republic, where Louisiana Senator Dillings (Giancarlo Esposito), Matthew Kragen (Hutton), Kragen's mistress Ms. Burns (Alicia Witt), and a congressman (Michael Nouri) are all meeting to discuss all of their futures and plans.  When Georgia arrives in a helicopter and upgrades to the presidential suite, everyone in the group of ""importants"" is interested in who she is.  Kragen is especially interested, especially if she is a representative of another company, or someone coming to investigate his doings with Senator Dillings and the congressman.  But we all know that Georgia is there to have a good time, and during the course of her stay she inspires and affects everyone in one way or another with her simple but true philosophies on life.  Along the way, she befriends Chef Didier (Gerard Depardieu, in a very mild and sweet role) and the two of them have wonderful chemistry on screen.  All the while, Shawn finds out about Georgia's condition and is determined to find her before her time is up.  Now, all of that said, the movie sounds familiar and cliche, yes, but Latifah is such a wonderful and sweet actress and every moment she is on screen is perfect.  Latifah makes this wonderful family comedy extremely hard to resist.  The rest of the cast, especially Gerard Depardieu, add to the wonderful chemistry brought to the film, and throughout all of the moments of cliche and familiarity, the cast never stops being funny and touching.  This is a film that is extremely difficult to dislike.",4,Cliches don't matter,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,3084,"['quote', 'Richard', 'Roeper', 'last', 'week', 'show', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'had', 'right', 'be', 'statement', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'accurate', 'other', 'combination', 'be', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'horrible', 'so', 'overdone', 'sweet', 'warm-hearted', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'role', 'film', 'lovable', 'Yes', 'many', 'points', 'film', 'pretty', 'cliche', 'have', 'seen', 'conventions', 'other', 'films', 'Latifah', 'sparkles', 'lights', 'up', 'scene', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie', 'sympathize', 'character', 'Latifah', 'Georgia', 'Byrd', 'original', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'lead', 'role', 'playing', 'George', 'Bird', 'cookware', 'demonstrator', 'saleswoman', 'local', 'Louisiana', 'retail', 'store', 'run', 'retail', 'tycoon', 'Matthew', 'Kragen', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'secretly', 'crush', 'Shawn', 'Williams', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'vice', 'versa', 'pushed', 'abnoxious', 'boss', 'Adamian', 'Matt', 'Ross', 'scene', 'Shawn', 'eating', 'food', 'Georgia', 'customers', 'up', 'quickly', 'head', 'cabinet', 'door', 'given', 'CAT', 'scan', 'Dr.', 'Gupta', 'Ranjit', 'Chowdhry', 'very', 'funny', 'cliche', 'role', 'Lampington', 'disease', 'disease', 'apparently', 'brain', 'tumors', 'about', 'three', 'weeks', 'live', 'So', 'Georgia', 'predictable', 'steps', 'job', 'boss', 'cell', 'phone', 'cashes', 'savings', 'bonds', 'travels', 'Hotel', 'Pupp', 'really', 'say', 'way', 'large', 'resort', 'Karlovy', 'Vary', 'small', 'area', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'where', 'Louisiana', 'Senator', 'Dillings', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'Matthew', 'Kragen', 'Hutton', 'Kragen', 'mistress', 'Ms.', 'Burns', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'congressman', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'are', 'meeting', 'discuss', 'futures', 'plans', 'When', 'Georgia', 'helicopter', 'upgrades', 'presidential', 'suite', 'everyone', 'group', 'importants', 'interested', 'who', 'Kragen', 'especially', 'interested', 'especially', 'representative', 'company', 'someone', 'coming', 'investigate', 'doings', 'Senator', 'Dillings', 'congressman', 'know', 'Georgia', 'there', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'course', 'stay', 'everyone', 'one', 'way', 'simple', 'true', 'philosophies', 'life', 'way', 'Chef', 'Didier', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'very', 'mild', 'sweet', 'role', 'two', 'have', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'while', 'Shawn', 'out', 'Georgia', 'condition', 'determined', 'find', 'time', 'up', 'Now', 'said', 'movie', 'familiar', 'cliche', 'yes', 'Latifah', 'such', 'wonderful', 'sweet', 'actress', 'moment', 'screen', 'perfect', 'Latifah', 'wonderful', 'family', 'comedy', 'extremely', 'hard', 'resist', 'rest', 'cast', 'especially', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'add', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'brought', 'film', 'moments', 'cliche', 'familiarity', 'cast', 'never', 'being', 'funny', 'touching', 'film', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'dislike']",N/A

642875,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005JOSG,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[13, 16]","Last Holiday is an excellent film starring the wonderful Queen Latifah (OK, so maybe I'm biased because I always liked her). The acting is very convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace. While this won't be wining any awards anytime soon, please don't let that stop you from getting this flick. The script is very well written and the casting couldn't be better. This movie kept my attention every step of the way!The action begins when we meet Georgia Byrd, a rather shy woman who wears ""frumpy clothing"" and works in cookware within a department store. She secretly has a crush on Sean Matthews, a coworker, who is played brilliantly by L L Cool J. Just about all Georgia ever does besides work in the store is sing in her church choir and watch TV food shows as she tries to follow along with what the chef is preparing. Georgia even denies herself a single bit of this food; she feeds it to a young child named Darius instead and eats nothing except her ""lean cuisine"" frozen foods which she cooks in her microwave.One day things change radically for Georgia. She hits her head by accident in the department store and she is rushed to the store's health clinic much to the chagrin of her supervisor who does nothing all day but talk on his cell phone and worry about profits. Much to Georgia's horror, Georgia has a CT scan that indicates that she has just three or four weeks to live.Georgia decides that in her last remaining days on this planet she will travel after all to a swank resort in Czechoslovakia. This was one of the things she always wanted to do in her scrapbook of ""possibilities."" By pure chance she meets the top head of the department store there (Matthew Kragen played well by Timothy Hutton) and his mistress. Georgia also meets the chef she always idolized, Chef Didier played well by G&eacute;rard Depardieu; her senator (Giancarlo Esposito) and a few other ""notables"" who are staying at this resort.Of course, to make the movie funny these people all simply assume that Georgia is some fantastically wealthy power broker-businesswoman and they try to decide who she is since none of them ever heard of her before. They also are so taken with Georgia that they want to do everything that she wants to do--it's childish but cute and funny and the same time.Meanwhile, Matthew Kragen pays off one of the staff to rummage through Georgia's things to find out once and for all who she really is--and Sean Matthews heads for Czechoslovakia to get Georgia back for his soul mate and bride.The movie can go anywhere from here. Will Matthew be able to discover who Georgia really is? Of course, Georgia never actually said she was a powerful business leader so maybe that will help--or maybe it won't when these snobs find out who she really is. What about Sean--will he be able to reach Georgia while she is still at the resort? And how will Georgia ever be able to handle her last days in Czechoslovakia after an avalanche may well leave her stranded there?The DVD has a couple of deleted scenes and the ""making of"" extras are good. I agree with the reviewer who writes that ""Last Look"" was indeed the best of the bonuses.Last Holiday gets two thumbs up from me! The cast is wonderful and everybody plays their roles perfectly.

642891,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B00005JOSG,Nathan T.,"[0, 1]","I do admit this movie is decently satisfying to watch because it is somewhat entertaining. However, the acting, script, and plot in this movie is very weak. Queen Latifah has her usual role as someone with moral values and stand for what's right, and does not back down. A wholesome woman if you may say.However, her lines in the movie were very mediocre and her character is not strong enough to support the kind of action the movie is trying to portray or at least SHOULD portray. Let's all admit straightforward, no lies; Queen Latifah is no way in heck a good actor. She's just mediocre. She does just enough acting to get the movie by without everybody booing her off the stage, she's a like-able person and that's the only thing she got going for her. Her acting is just to the bare minimum.In terms of script, I thought it was horrible. The movie was very fairytale-ish (which isn't bad I guess but makes it sorta lame) and extremely predictable. After the doctor diagnosed her problem, I predicted all of her actions all the way towards the ending. The plot was static and easily predictable because it is so. She did exactly as I thought she would in terms of (I'm trying not to release any spoilers).1. Job2. Her savings3. Her attitude changes (before she kept to herself)4. Her choice in using her savings.5. The doctor's diagnostics6. Ending.However, her role was not fully satisfied with the way she acted. For example when she confronted her lousy boss before quitting. The acting was there, but the scene was weak and her lines were weak so you never really felt satisfied with the outcome of her resolutions. Much stronger lines and more powerful dramatic scenes can make this movie much more intensifying and satisfying for the viewer.Am I disappointed? Nah...it's Queen Latifah, I was expecting something like this. It's not a bad movie, just wish they would have pushed it a bit more.

When she receives the devastating news that she has only three weeks left to live, she cashes in her bonds and IRA fund and checks into a $4,000/day suite in a grand hotel in the Czech Republic, determined to indulge in the kind of pampered living she'd shielded herself from all her life.Based on the 1950 film starring Alec Guinness in the lead role, ""Last Holiday"" provides a showcase for the talented Queen Latifah, who delivers what is probably her most subdued and fully-rounded performance to date.  Unfortunately, the praise does not extend to the film itself, which is woefully lacking in the kind of comic energy that would make this sentimental material even remotely palatable.  The secondary characters are little more than hollow stereotypes, and the movie relies too much on lowbrow slapstick when highbrow wit is what is really called for.  It also becomes smug and self-satisfied towards the end, providing sappy little lessons in life that are trite and not really all that inspirational.There are a few genuine laughs in the film and the scenery will knock your eyes out.  But apart from Ms. Latifah lighting up the screen as the divine Miss Georgia, there's not much reason to check into this two-star, somewhat less-than-grand hotel called ""Last Holiday.""",2,Latifah fine in desultory vehicle,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,1384,"['**1/2Georgia', 'Byrd', 'retail', 'salesclerk', 'who', 'lived', 'whole', 'life', 'box', 'When', 'devastating', 'news', 'only', 'three', 'weeks', 'left', 'live', 'bonds', 'IRA', 'fund', 'checks', '4,000/day', 'suite', 'grand', 'hotel', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'determined', 'indulge', 'kind', 'pampered', 'living', ""'d"", 'shielded', 'life.Based', '1950', 'film', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'lead', 'role', 'Last', 'Holiday', 'showcase', 'talented', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'subdued', 'fully-rounded', 'performance', 'date', 'Unfortunately', 'praise', 'not', 'extend', 'film', 'woefully', 'lacking', 'kind', 'comic', 'energy', 'would', 'make', 'sentimental', 'material', 'even', 'remotely', 'palatable', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'hollow', 'stereotypes', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'lowbrow', 'slapstick', 'when', 'highbrow', 'wit', 'what', 'really', 'called', 'also', 'smug', 'self-satisfied', 'towards', 'end', 'providing', 'sappy', 'little', 'lessons', 'life', 'are', 'trite', 'not', 'really', 'are', 'few', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'film', 'scenery', 'will', 'knock', 'eyes', 'out', 'apart', 'Ms.', 'Latifah', 'lighting', 'up', 'screen', 'divine', 'Miss', 'Georgia', 'not', 'much', 'reason', 'check', 'two-star', 'somewhat', 'less-than-grand', 'hotel', 'called', 'Last', 'Holiday']",N/A

I have gone to see it three times, and I plan on seeing it at least once more before it is out of theatres, and I hope it comes out on DVD fairly soon.Queen Latifah's performance is sensational as always, and she is perfectly cast. The supporting ensemble is also just brilliant.Sure, this isn't Oscar material, and this won't break any box office record either, but this movie is the ultimate in life-affirming. It is true that the whole notion of the plot is rather cinematically cliched, but Latifah gets around this without a trace of sap on her fingers.As the plot reaches its climax, it's hard to hold back the tears, at least if you're the sensitive type, and if you are not at least deeply moved you probably need to see a shrink.You will indeed see that life is not about regrets; go out and fulfill your dreams and enjoy the life you have, because any day could be your last.

I say that this is a must-see movie for everyone.I remember the first time I saw this movie.  I was at my town's local movie rental store and I saw this one on the newly released shelf.  I rented it and took it home to watch it.  At first I didn't know what to expect.  It was about a woman who finds out she has only has a short amount of time to live and decides to life her life to the fullest before she dies (which to be fair does sound sad at first).  I know it sounds familiar to other movies.  I even suspected that it wouldn't affect me in any way.  But then I got into 20 minutes of the movie and that was when I started to enjoy every scene there was.First off, I really love Queen Latifah as an actress.  She great at what she does and I enjoy a lot of movies she is in.  She was the reason I rented this movie in the first place and I'm glad I did.Second off, this movie was really good.  It wasn't amazing or great, it was just good.  It was one of those movies that just makes you happy and feel good.  I love how the movie starts off with Queen's character living a bored life and having a dream of one day opening up her own restaurant but lacks the will to actually do anything.  Then the &#34;bad&#34; part happens and she finds out she has a rare disease and is going to die within the next few months of her life.  This is where the best parts of the movie takes off.  We see her start living her life to the fullest and starts having fun.  She even teaches a few life lessons to other rich people along the way and even makes herself come to realize just how much she misses out.  That is actually a pretty good lesson for the movie to tell and it tells it really great.  I know other movies have done this before but this movie really does make the moment worth it.The ending is seen coming.  I don't even have to spoil anything, once you start watching the movie you know just how this movie will end.  But once the end does come it doesn't matter if you knew or not.  The ending to this movie was great and I love it.  The lesson is really powerful and it shows that our choices are what gives us a happy life.  Sure, there may not be happy endings in our world but that doesn't mean we can't live a happy life.I say buy this movie.  It is worth it and I believe you will love this movie as well.

642924,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JOSG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 0]","Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah) lives a very quiet, safe life as a sales clerk in the cookware department at Kragen's Department Store in New Orleans. She clips coupons, eats Lean Cuisine while cooking fabulous food for a neighbor's son, and secretly pines for Sean (LL Cool J), another sales clerk at the store. One day, Georgia bumps her head and learns that she has a rare, fatal tumor, giving her just three weeks to live. Shocked, she quits her job, withdraws her life savings and travels to the Grand Hotel Pupp in the Czech Republic. There, she finally starts living the life of her dreams.""Last Holiday"", directed by Wayne Wang (""The Joy Luck Club"", ""Maid in Manhattan""), is a star vehicle for Queen Latifah. Georgia Byrd is a role custom made for Latifah and it allows her to shine. The film is also surprisingly sweet, charming and enjoyable. A couple of minor missteps into ""I Love Lucy"" territory aside, this is a film to enjoy.Queen Latifah is a personality and, let's face it, not an actress. In each of her previous films, her personality has been bigger than life. In some cases, this has worked for her. In others, it hasn't. But as Georgia, Latifah does a very good job of creating a living, breathing person. We believe every nuance and thought of her character, making her real, making us care.She is a careful person, saving every penny, waiting for the opportunity to spend it. Working hard at a dead end job, she holds hope for the day when she will be able to use all of her skills and dreams to open a restaurant of her own. She practices for that day, cooking new dishes and taking a photo of the dish for her ""Possibilities"" book. A neighbor's son comes over to sample the food; Georgia seems to live on a steady diet of frozen low fat food in her ongoing battle to manage her figure.Georgia is very good at her job and takes pride in the Cookware department at the large store, offering another venue for her to work on and practice for her dream, as she prepares food every Wednesday. Working in retail, her boss is the stereotypical jerk who reads self-help books by Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton), the owner of the store, and idolizes both the boss and his cell phone. But Georgia puts up with it because she has dreams.Georgia also dreams about a relationship with Sean (LL Cool J), a fellow sales associate. She makes up excuses to be around him, buying things from his department, just for the attention. He is clearly shy and unable to express his feelings, making their relationship sweet and touching.Then events happen, life happens, sh*t happens, and Georgia learns she has three weeks to live. All of those dreams need to become a reality and fast.I just realized that I have been talking about Georgia; what happens to her throughout the film, what she does, how she handles things. A key testament to Latifah's performance is that I am referring to her character as a person.""Holiday"" is as good as it is because of Latifah's performance. She is sweet, charming and entirely believable throughout. As we witness Georgia's life in New Orleans, Latifah brings a quiet, demure, slightly defeated quality to the character. She puts up with a lot, but suppresses most of her feelings. What good would it do for her to yell or shout or get excited? But throughout, there is an air of hope as she longs for a relationship or talks quietly about her dreams. She even has a book, the ""Book of Possibilities"", in which she places brochures of places she wants to visit, articles about her idol, Emeril Lagasse, and pictures of the food she creates. This may sound a little hokey, and it is, but because Latifah does such a good job of creating Georgia, making her believable and real, this item becomes sweet, even a little endearing.After Georgia learns her fate, she becomes a different person, trying to live as many of her dreams as possible in the time she has left. Withdrawing her life savings, she makes the trip she has always dreamed of, to the Grand Hotel. Thankfully, Georgia remains much the same person. She changes, it would be a boring film if she didn't, but she retains all of her human qualities; still sweet, charming and quiet. Thankfully, she doesn't begin to take on the more annoying habits of the stereotypical rich and famous people she meets at the hotel. The big change for Georgia is she becomes liberated. Her remaining time on Earth has made her realize what she is missing. She does what she wants, says what she wants and doesn't care what other people think about it.Also good are LL Cool J and Gerard Depardieu. Boy, I never thought I would use both of those names in the same sentence. As Sean, LL Cool J is a nice compliment to Latifah's character; Sean is very similar to Georgia and it is sweet to watch them dance around each other, trying to get the courage up to start a relationship. Once Georgia gets to the Grand Hotel, she realizes two dreams; to stay at the hotel and to eat the food of Chef Didier (Gerard Depardieu), the other chef she idolizes. Of course they become friends, but it is slightly more natural than you might imagine.Less successful are the portrayals of the well-to-do she meets at the hotel. Upon her arrival, she immediately meets a Senator from New Orleans (Giancarlo Esposito), Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton), the owner of the department store where she used to work, and Kragen's Assistant/ Girlfriend (Alicia Witt). ""Holiday"" expects us to buy the contrivance that this woman travels thousands of miles and immediately runs into people who have previously affected her life. Because the film wants to be a feel good fairy tale, Georgia will naturally affect their lives, changing them for the better. Just as I was about to chuck a tomato at the screen, writing the film off, Latifah began to win me over again and I was willing to overlook this contrivance.""Holiday"" lays this on pretty thick. Not only does Georgia change the lives of the well-to-do she comes across, but the staff of the hotel come to know her, respect her and become empowered by her. These transformations work better than those of the rich and famous characters. In the universe of this film, rich equals vapid, superficial and ultimately bad. At least when Georgia is unconsciously changing the lives of the hotel workers, she is helping to empower the poor, the underclass, the ""Good"".Director Wayne Wang has done some great work (""The Joy Luck Club"") and made some not so great films (""Maid in Manhattan""). The director brings a level of depth and character to the film which I honestly wasn't expecting. Yes, Latifah is the life force of the film, but Wang provides the tapestry for her painting. And he probably guided her hand a lot as she applied paint to her character.Despite the film's simplistic message, Wang infuses the story with characters and details, some of which work, some don't, making the film a lot more interesting than you might think.There are a few points when ""Holiday"" falls flat, primarily when the story steers into sitcom territory, placing Georgia in one ""I Love Lucy"" situation after another. Imagine, the European Tour sequence of the original ""I Love Lucy"" show going to the Czech Republic and you might begin to get an idea of the ""crazy situations"" Georgia gets into. I think Lucille Ball might have done the same things. But in a sweet, moving film about a woman's journey, they are entirely out of place. At one point, Georgia snowboards across a group's lunch and ends up on the cover of a ski magazine. It just stretches the limits of credibility too far.But overall, the film works. And works well, in large part due to a winning performance from Queen Latifah.",4,Latifah's Winning Performance Makes The Film,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,7679,"['Georgia', 'Byrd', 'Queen',

(I won't name all the disappointments.) However, I began catching snippets of it on satellite, and it didn't make me want to gouge my eyes out with a spork. I finally managed to watch the whole thing and decided I wanted to own a copy.Georgia, like the meek George in the original, keeps her head down and does her job, unappreciated by the department store she works for. A  knock to the head results in her being taken to the store's doctor, who insists she have a CAT scan. (on a used machine, which is all the cheapskate management will go for.) Of course the manager wants to refuse, and only agrees to allow it when he's informed of the workers comp liability. The CAT scan reveals Georgia has something called Lampington's Disease, which unless treated, will result in death. Guess what? Georgia's crummy HMO won't cover it, and the out-of-pocket cost to her would be about 300k. So it looks like she's got three weeks to live, four at the most.The executives were without fail heartless, and watching Georgia take off her boot and beat the manager's cellphone to a pulp was an excellent sequence, as was his begging her not to quit, willing to raise her salary by a $1 an hour, which he'd previously refused to do, even though her's was the only department in the entire store that was making a profit.Realizing how much of her life she's let pass her by, Georgia decides to go out with a bang. She cashes in her IRA (I couldn't help cringing at the sock she was going to take on her income tax) as well as the bonds her mother left her and flies to Europe. It seems her death sentence is liberating, and she starts standing up for herself, refusing to accept the status quo when the man in front of her on the plane wants to spend the flight with his seat so far back he's practically in her lap, and paying the additional cost to fly first class, where she gets a taste of what the rich people get.Georgia takes a helicopter to the hotel where she'll be staying rather than wait for a taxi, moves to a 4k/night suite without a blink, takes snowboarding lessons, goes diving off dams, and makes friends with the hotel staff, including the chef. And the love of her life moves heaven and earth to go after her.This doesn't end the way the original did, (although it turns out that neither Georgia nor George have Lampington's) which works (IMHO) for this movie, and we get a feel-good ending.Of course, there's still what she'll have to pay the IRS.

This movie has some inspired comic moments from Queen Latifah and a quirky supporting cast.",5,Last Holiday (Full Screen Edition),1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,936,"['Georgia', 'Byrd', 'small', 'life', 'tucked', 'inside', 'big', 'dreams', 'shy', 'cookware', 'salesperson', 'New', 'Orleans', 'retail', 'outlet', 'knives', 'skillets', 'flair', 'master', 'chef', 'when', 'Georgia', 'days', 'are', 'numbered', 'caution', 'wind', 'embarks', 'dream', 'holiday', 'vacation', 'grand', 'resort', 'Europe', 'thinking', 'nothing', 'lose', 'Georgia', 'metamorphosis', 'transformation', 'everyone', 'Georgia', 'newly', 'uninhibited', 'personality', 'up', 'staff', 'guests', 'alike', 'including', 'venerate', 'chef', 'as', 'well', 'retail', 'magnate', 'who', 'convinced', 'rival', 'intent', 'sabotaging', 'business', 'plans', 'snowy', 'slopes', 'spectacular', 'spas', 'delectable', 'dinners', 'midnight', 'balls', 'Georgia', 'going', 'live', 'lifetime', 'fun', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'good-hearted', 'lovable', 'movie', 'movie', 'inspired', 'comic', 'moments', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'quirky', 'supporting', 'cast']",N/A
642932,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JOSG,Tucker Andersen,"[39, 54]","This film succeeds in its apparently sole purpose of providing a vehicle with a storyline that is enjoyable enough so that Queen Latifah's legion of fans will decide to spend slightly less than two hours and several dollars watching her be her very likeable self. (I would have preferred a role that allowed her to utilize more of the range of acting talent which she possesses.) This is a good film to see when you want to relax and watch a movie with a straightforward storyline (calling it a plot would be a great overstatement), good performances, a feel good ending such as seems to have become obligatory for this genre and which provides a lot of chuckles and a few truly hilarious sequences; perhaps just as enjoyably and surprisingly it contains absolutely no violence, no profanity and no lewdness so the only reason for anyone to be offended is its lack of surprises and underutilization of a talented cast.Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah) is the star of the cookware section of the Louisiana department store where she works, but she is too cautious and fearful to indicate to her fellow employee Sean Matthews (LL Cool J) that her dream is to spend her life raising a family with him. She is also too cautious to talk back to the new store manager who has been installed by the aggressive and obnoxious financier (Matthew Kragen played by Timothy Hutton) who has recently bought the store and is much more interested in immediately improving profitability than either customer or employee relations. She lives her life vicariously, honing her cooking skills through detailed imitation of famous chefs who are TV personalities but is reluctant to indulge herself to the extent of actually eating the food which she prepares (she serves it to the boy who lives next store and the customers who attend her in-store demonstrations) and she certainly appears destined to never achieve the courage necessary to open the restaurant about which she dreams.A medical examination resulting from aftermath of an accident reveals that Georgia has an incurable disease which will cause her death within a few weeks; after recovering from the shock and depression caused by the news, she decides to live out one of her fantasies; she then withdraws all her savings to ""blow them"" on fulfilling her dream of traveling to the posh Czech resort where her idol Chef Didier (Gerard Depardieu) works his culinary magic. At this point, what has been a quite slow paced narrative with only occasional flashes of humor suddenly hits its stride. In an ironic twist of fate, Kragen is vacationing with his entourage at the same resort, and Georgia's apparent joy of life (she has kept her imminent death a secret from everyone) and friendly personality contrast wonderfully with his intensity, uptightness and self-centeredness. Unbeknownst to him, his frustration at being upstaged is caused by a ""lowly salesperson"" in one of his stores, an ""imposter"" in these upscale surroundings. Several of the scenes as he tries to upstage her while she simply is enjoying the last days of her life are truly hilarious and the moments when the film resorts to moralizing are very few and never intense.Of course, the news of her imminent death eventually becomes known. Sean Matthews, who realizes that he no longer enjoys his job since Georgia has left, flies off to find her in order to share whatever time she has left. Meanwhile, the highlight of the film is the relationship which Georgia builds with Chef Didier; a chemistry gradually develops between them based on their love of the art of cooking and the complementary nature of their very different backgrounds. The casting of Depardieu in his role opposite Latifah was sheer inspiration!The premise for this film was derived from a 1950 film of the same name starring Alec Guiness; I have not seen that film but would guess that, in keeping with the usual formula which studios employ today, this 2006 remake has a much more feel good tone and less subtlety than did that classic. In summary, the message in this film is delivered extremely lightly and the innocuous story is told in an enjoyable way. As stated at the beginning of this review, if you are a Queen Latifah fan or what to just relax while viewing some lighthearted entertainment, you will enjoy this film enough to go see it during its theater release. Just be patient as the background story is slowly developed at the beginning of the film, don't expect a believable plot, and remember that among the current film releases in theatres there are productions which involve more meaningful and interesting stories based on much better screenplays.Tucker Andersen",3,(3 ) Enjoy Life Before You Die,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,4660,"['film', 'apparently', 'sole', 'purpose', 'providing', 'vehicle', 'storyline', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'legion', 'fans', 'will', 'decide', 'spend', 'slightly', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'several', 'dollars', 'watching', 'be', 'very', 'likeable', 'self', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'role', 'allowed', 'utilize', 'more', 'range', 'acting', 'talent', 'good', 'film', 'see', 'when', 'want', 'relax', 'watch', 'movie', 'straightforward', 'storyline', 'calling', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'overstatement', 'good', 'performances', 'feel', 'good', 'ending', 'such', 'have', 'become', 'obligatory', 'genre', 'lot', 'chuckles', 'few', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'sequences', 'perhaps', 'just', 'enjoyably', 'surprisingly', 'absolutely', 'violence', 'profanity', 'lewdness', 'so', 'only', 'reason', 'anyone', 'be', 'offended', 'lack', 'surprises', 'underutilization', 'talented', 'cast.Georgia', 'Byrd', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'star', 'cookware', 'section', 'Louisiana', 'department', 'store', 'where', 'too', 'cautious', 'fearful', 'indicate', 'fellow', 'employee', 'Sean', 'Matthews', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'dream', 'spend', 'life', 'raising', 'family', 'also', 'too', 'cautious', 'talk', 'back', 'new', 'store', 'manager', 'who', 'been', 'installed', 'aggressive', 'obnoxious', 'financier', 'Matthew', 'Kragen', 'played', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'who', 'recently', 'bought', 'store', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'immediately', 'improving', 'profitability', 'customer', 'employee', 'relations', 'life', 'vicariously', 'honing', 'cooking', 'skills', 'detailed', 'imitation', 'famous', 'chefs', 'who', 'are', 'TV', 'personalities', 'reluctant', 'indulge', 'extent', 'actually', 'eating', 'food', 'boy', 'who', 'next', 'store', 'customers', 'who', 'attend', 'in-store', 'demonstrations', 'certainly', 'destined', 'never', 'achieve', 'courage', 'necessary', 'open', 'restaurant', 'medical', 'examination', 'resulting', 'aftermath', 'accident', 'reveals', 'Georgia', 'incurable', 'disease', 'will', 'cause', 'death', 'few', 'weeks', 'recovering', 'shock', 'depression', 'caused', 'news', 'live', 'out', 'one', 'fantasies', 'then', 'savings', 'blow', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'traveling', 'posh', 'Czech', 'resort', 'where', 'idol', 'Chef', 'Didier', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'culinary', 'magic', 'point', 'what', 'been', 'quite', 'slow', 'paced', 'narrative', 'only', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'humor', 'suddenly', 'stride', 'ironic', 'twist', 'fate', 'Kragen', 'vacationing', 'entourage', 'same', 'resort', 'Georgia', 'apparent', 'joy', 'life', 'kept', 'imminent', 'death', 'secret', 'everyone', 'friendly', 'personality', 'contrast', 'wonderfully', 'intensity', 'uptightness', 'self-centeredness', 'Unbeknownst', 'frustration', 'being', 'upstaged', 'caused', 'lowly', 'salesperson', 'one', 'stores', 'imposter', 'upscale', 'surroundings', 'Several', 'scenes', 'upstage', 'simply', 'enjoying', 'last', 'days', 'life', 'are', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'resorts', 'moralizing', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'never', 'intense.Of', 'course', 'news', 'imminent', 'death', 'eventually', 'known', 'Sean', 'Matthews', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'job', 'Georgia', 'left', 'find', 'order', 'share', 'time', 'left', 'Meanwhile', 'highlight', 'film', 'relationship', 'Georgia', 'Chef', 'Didier', 'chemistry', 'gradually', 'based', 'love', 'art', 'cooking', 'complementary', 'nature', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'casting', 'Depardieu', 'role', 'opposite', 'Latifah', 'was', 'sheer', 'inspiration', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'derived', '1950', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'would', 'guess', 'keeping', 'usual', 'formula', 'employ', 'today', '2006', 'remake', 'much', 'more', 'feel', 'good', 'tone', 'less', 'subtlety', 'did', 'classic', 'summary', 'message', 'film', 'delivered', 'extremely', 'lightly', 'innocuous', 'story', 'told', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'stated', 'beginning', 'review', 'are', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'fan', 'what', 'just', 'relax', 'viewing', 'lighthearted', 'entertainment', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'enough', 'go', 'see', 'theater', 'release', 'Just', 'be', 'patient', 'background', 'story', 'slowly', 'developed', 'beginning', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'believable', 'plot', 'remember', 'current', 'film', 'releases', 'theatres', 'are', 'productions', 'involve', 'more', 'meaningful', 'interesting', 'stories', 'based', 'much', 'better', 'screenplays.Tucker', 'Andersen']",N/A

It has a powerful message that really causes one to evaulate the way we live everyday life and finding out what truly is important in life.
