1163266,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0019F02W6,calvinnme,"[4, 7]","Season nine is really the last great season of Cheers. It's the one in which Rebecca and Robin come to a resolution of their relationship after Robin finishes his time in prison, and where Rebecca and Sam finally fall into some form of normalcy in their relationship. Finally, it was the first full season after Sam finally got his bar back after losing it at the end of season five.Season ten can only be judged as ""more of the same"". That's not bad when you consider Cheers' weird cast of characters, but there are really no surprises. The only real season-long storyline is Sam and Rebecca's attempt to have a child together. For things to really get moving again you have to wait for the final season - season eleven. The outstanding episodes of season ten are the two involving the ""Bar Wars"" between Cheers and Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, and the very best of the season is the finale involving Woody's marriage to his wealthy girlfriend, Kelly. For once there is no season-ending cliffhanger here, just lots of fun Cheers-style.The timing between the release of seasons nine and ten - end of May for season nine and the first of September for season ten - makes it look like Paramount will probably release season eleven and probably ""Cheers: The Complete Series"" around Christmas time. Since these sets are always cheaper when packaged together I'd recommend waiting and seeing if that is what is planned.",4,"Not the best of Cheers, but still a good season",1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1411,"['Season', 'nine', 'really', 'last', 'great', 'season', 'Cheers', 'one', 'Rebecca', 'Robin', 'come', 'resolution', 'relationship', 'Robin', 'time', 'prison', 'where', 'Rebecca', 'Sam', 'finally', 'fall', 'form', 'normalcy', 'relationship', 'Finally', 'was', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'Sam', 'finally', 'got', 'bar', 'back', 'losing', 'end', 'season', 'five.Season', 'ten', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'judged', 'more', 'same', 'not', 'bad', 'when', 'consider', 'Cheers', 'weird', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'surprises', 'only', 'real', 'season-long', 'storyline', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'attempt', 'have', 'child', 'together', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'moving', 'again', 'have', 'wait', 'final', 'season', 'season', 'eleven', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'season', 'ten', 'are', 'two', 'involving', 'Bar', 'Wars', 'Cheers', 'Gary', 'Olde', 'Towne', 'Tavern', 'very', 'best', 'season', 'finale', 'involving', 'Woody', 'marriage', 'wealthy', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'once', 'season-ending', 'cliffhanger', 'here', 'just', 'lots', 'fun', 'Cheers-style.The', 'timing', 'release', 'seasons', 'nine', 'ten', 'end', 'May', 'season', 'nine', 'first', 'September', 'season', 'ten', 'look', 'Paramount', 'will', 'probably', 'release', 'season', 'eleven', 'probably', 'Cheers', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Christmas', 'time', 'sets', 'are', 'always', 'cheaper', 'when', 'packaged', 'together', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'waiting', 'seeing', 'what', 'planned']",Cheers: Season 10

It's full of surprises, full of laughs, and ten seasons in, manages to add even more nuances to well-established characters.""Get Your Kicks on Route 666"" is another stand-alone classic, primarily for the fact that it gets four of the show's male leads out of the bar and into a unique setting...a road trip to find their ""inner hairy man."" Kelsey Grammer delivers the best line here...""I wouldn't want to run into the wolf who could carry off Norm""...but it's a solid episode from start to finish.We get a return visit from Annie Golden as Cliff's on again, off again girlfriend Maggie, and of course there's Woody's wedding...every bit as chaotic as you might expect.Overall, Season 10 is worth a rock-solid four stars...maybe even 4.5.
