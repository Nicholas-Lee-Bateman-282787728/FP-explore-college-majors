I Know everything about ANY carnival ride, and Every rides manufacturer. Obsessed much?!?! lol! And i LOVE Horror Movies. I Was in my video store the other day, and i seen this an i was like..OMFGGG.... This is the PERFECT combination for me. So, i imidiatally HAD to get it. I put it in, as soon as i got home. I Wanted to Love this SOOOO MUCH. Unfortunatally, i didn't. The Movie doesn't make a lick of sense. I was confused throughout the whole movie. Some parts, were so dumb, they were actually HILARIOUS. Everytime something happened in this movie, it turned out to be a vision they were having. It is ASHAME, that someone, would ruin a movie, that had so much potential. The Artwork is FABOLOUS!! That's the only reason this movie gets Two Stars. The Movie itself, 1 STAR. Please...RE MAKE this movie.

There are extras included on the DVD that include ""deleted scenes"" and a 1993 visit throught the abandoned park in the hopes of re-opening it but the detoriation was much more than anticipated, so it never happened.  The movie itself had its moments, but as one reviewer said, the acting leaves something to be desired. I liked it for the fact that it was filmed there, for the most part. The fun house scene however, is the old bath house, as the fun house had collapsed over the years.If you're a fan of old abandoned parks, this one's for you!",3,Eeerie Setting at Chippewa Lake,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,662,"['could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'read', 'so', 'much', 'Chippewa', 'Lake', 'Park', 'thought', 'seeing', 'was', 'inspired', 'are', 'extras', 'included', 'DVD', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', '1993', 'visit', 'throught', 'abandoned', 'park', 'hopes', 're-opening', 'detoriation', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'anticipated', 'never', 'happened', 'movie', 'had', 'moments', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'acting', 'leaves', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'liked', 'fact', 'was', 'filmed', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'fun', 'house', 'scene', 'however', 'old', 'bath', 'house', 'fun', 'house', 'had', 'collapsed', 'years.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'old', 'abandoned', 'parks', 'one']",Closed for the Season

Spiritually the movies shares themes with Burton's Big Fish with the implied theme of the power of storytelling.  Whether you want to call it part ghost-story or part carnival from hell, Closed For The Season unfortunately never seems to find its focus or footing.The Positives:  Very surreal, lots of interesting imagery, the dialogue is well-written and often even poetic and thought provoking.  There's probably even a metaphor lurking about in the narrative somewhere.  Joe Unger, as the Carny, absolutely owns this film.The Downers:  The narrative, though surreal, is so disjointed at times that you may be left wondering if the producer/director had an idea for a story at all; heck, you might even be left wondering if there was even any story in the first place, or just a bunch of cool scenes strung together.  The ending doesn't exactly tie up the movie, though there is a connection between that and the opening scene.  The dialogue is well-written, but it is often onerous and slows the action and tension down.",3,"Ok, maybe it's half-open",1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,1255,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'read', 'Something', 'Wicked', 'Way', 'Comes', 'Circus', 'film', 'Seven', 'Faces', 'Dr.', 'Lao', 'Vampire', 'Circus', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'kind', 'ground', 'mind', 'will', 'be', 'treading', 'film', 'Spiritually', 'movies', 'shares', 'themes', 'Burton', 'Big', 'Fish', 'implied', 'theme', 'power', 'storytelling', 'want', 'call', 'part', 'ghost-story', 'part', 'carnival', 'hell', 'Closed', 'Season', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'find', 'focus', 'footing.The', 'Positives', 'Very', 'surreal', 'lots', 'interesting', 'imagery', 'dialogue', 'well-written', 'often', 'even', 'poetic', 'thought', 'provoking', 'probably', 'even', 'metaphor', 'lurking', 'narrative', 'somewhere', 'Joe', 'Unger', 'Carny', 'absolutely', 'film.The', 'Downers', 'narrative', 'surreal', 'so', 'disjointed', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'wondering', 'producer/director', 'had', 'idea', 'story', 'heck', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'left', 'wondering', 'was', 'even', 'story', 'first', 'place', 'just', 'bunch', 'cool', 'scenes', 'strung', 'together', 'ending', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'tie', 'up', 'movie', 'connection', 'opening', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'well-written', 'often', 'onerous', 'action', 'tension', 'down']",Closed for the Season
1434625,A31BDEUO4D8X6W,B004ZG17CK,wade,"[0, 0]","Was really pleased with this film, had some of the best filming at the now abandoned Chippewa Lake Park. I at first thought that there was alot of work involved building the rides and fun houses for this film, but then found out later that this was actually a long abandoned amusement park that was closed down 30 years ago. The scenery couldn't have been any better and the filming was of the best. I really thought that the main actor was Joe Unger (the carny)... excellent acting... top notch. The very cute couple Aimee Brookes, and Damian Maffei, were also really great with their acting. Was just wishing that their love and affection between them could have been built upon more... with maybe some more sensuous love making scenes. Some parts of the film were a little hard to understand and i wonder if maybe there was some re-editing that may have occured... or maybe some scenes were cut. A little bit of continuity problems, with jumping back in forth in time. Found it a little hard to understand what happened early on between the younger kids. Overall great storyline, and fantastic filming...great film for a couple looking to spend some time watching horror movies.",5,Excellent Horror/Amusement Park Story,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,1181,"['Was', 'really', 'pleased', 'film', 'had', 'best', 'filming', 'now', 'abandoned', 'Chippewa', 'Lake', 'Park', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'alot', 'work', 'involved', 'building', 'rides', 'fun', 'houses', 'film', 'then', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'was', 'actually', 'long', 'abandoned', 'amusement', 'park', 'was', 'closed', 'down', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'scenery', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'filming', 'was', 'best', 'really', 'thought', 'main', 'actor', 'was', 'Joe', 'Unger', 'carny', 'excellent', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'very', 'cute', 'couple', 'Aimee', 'Brookes', 'Damian', 'Maffei', 'were', 'also', 'really', 'great', 'acting', 'Was', 'just', 'wishing', 'love', 'affection', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'more', 'maybe', 'more', 'sensuous', 'love', 'making', 'scenes', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'little', 'hard', 'understand', 'i', 'wonder', 'maybe', 'was', 're-editing', 'may', 'have', 'occured', 'maybe', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'little', 'bit', 'continuity', 'problems', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'Found', 'little', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'early', 'younger', 'kids', 'Overall', 'great', 'storyline', 'fantastic', 'filming', 'great', 'film', 'couple', 'looking', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'horror', 'movies']",Closed for the Season
