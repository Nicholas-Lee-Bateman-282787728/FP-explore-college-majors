Having seen Cirque de Soleil live I can say this is as close as you can come to actually seeing it in person. The story is practically devoid of dialog, which of course is how it should be since the story is told in a purely visual manner.  It does require some thinking and interpretation of the almost staggering amount of symbols throughout the movie. But it is not as complicated as one might assume, since the main story line is very simple. Even at that, it is so beautiful and at times so breathtaking that you just need to sit back and enjoy. You are constantly amazed by staging, the colors, the costumes and above all by the artistry of the performers. Let's not forget the great music of the Beatles and its both humorous and wonderful interpretation in the film.

One unique feature of Cirque du Soleil is the absence of any animal.  That's the way I like it.  This film is essentially a showcase of the circus art of Cirque.  It includes seven shows that were running in Las Vegas in 2011.  They are spectacular.  Like all of Cirque's performance, they are character and story-driven.*Spoiler Alert.  The following review may contain spoilers.*The plot is simple.  A young woman (Erica Linz) visits a circus where a clown hands her a flyer on the show's star attraction - a handsome aerialist (Igor Zaripov).  During his flying act, he slips and falls into the sandpit below.  She jumps onto the sand trying to help and, together, they fall through the sand into a surreal world dotted with circus tents.  They are finally re-united after Erica visits many tents and witnesses many circus acts.  The film ends with a duet of the two aerialists performing a courtship dance in air.*End of possible spoilers*I watched the 2-D version on Amazon Prime.

The problem that I have:  while the picture quality with active is terrific, the glasses are a total pain; and with passive, while the glasses are terrific, the picture quality is terrible.  (480P per eye, with visible horizontal lines, is completely unacceptable with current passive.)  I do believe that 4K TV will fix this problem, however, and it looks like it will be going mainstream by at least 2014, thank god.  With 4K, you will have passive glasses -- those that you use at the theatre -- with 1080P per eye.  Now THAT'S what James Cameron will be talkin' about!So, I didn't watch this in 3D because I haven't bought a 3D set yet.  But I'd imagine that this film would be pretty terrific in 3D; the cinematography is fantastic in 2D.  So, while I believe that this is a 3 star in 2D, I'm going ahead and bumping it up to 4 since I figured that that would be only fair.With regards to the film itself, the thing that I actually noticed most:  the music.  I thought that the opening act, with the eastern influences -- harmonic minors suggesting middle eastern, followed by Asian keys from even farther east -- was terrific.  But then, seemingly, the film wanted to appeal to a mainstream American audience, and so the western music had to come out; Elvis followed by the Beatles.  I have to say that, for my taste, most of the music in the 60s, outside of Jazz, just wasn't that great.  You did have musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, however, that had real talent and brought true innovation to the music scene.  Too bad they didn't use some of his stuff instead.  And how about Miles Davis?This film tells a story, a story that I won't discuss since that would be a spoiler.  But I liked that; it wasn't a bunch of acrobatics thrown in willy-nilly to just show off.  At least there was a common thread that ran through the film, even though that thread was occasionally broken by varied music, some that I liked, some that I didn't, discussed above.Like I said, in 2D I'd say 3 stars.  But I'm sure that in 3D it will be 4.  And I can't wait to get that 4K TV so that I can pop on those passive glasses and watch this film again in 3D with 1080P per eye.

We watched it on a 60"" TV screen and I totally loved the video (enough to want to own the video). And sadly, it was a just a one day rental. So after viewing this video on a large screen, I ""tried out"" the trailer here on Amazon to see how it would view and sound on my Samsung Tab 2 10.1 Tablet. I was totally blown away!!!! So I downloaded the full video and have watched it OVER and OVER again.What I love about movies/videos on Amazon Video, keep your place so you can go right back to the movie/video later and just resume your viewing. What is so great also is the PICTURE QUALITY IS SUPERB and SOUND SUPERB!Yes, I do agree with previous viewers: That this is a mixture of previous Cirque Du Soleil shows. However, in my opinion, it has some of the greatest scenes from several of the shows and they work it into the very simple storyline: Girl sees young man performing (The Aerialist), then falls in love and wants to meet him, this is how the story begins, yet I felt like it took me ""Worlds Away"" in the outstanding footage that lead to the exciting finale. The finale is where the girl and the Aerialist fianly get together and perform together. This part I have played over and over and over as it is so beautiful. The price I paid for this video is so worth it and yes, it plays perfectly in FULL SCREEN on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.

It another trip into the magical fantasia, musical, dance world of Cirque du Soleil.  I have loved those I have seen live, and those I have on dvd.  This is a magical kingdom unto itself to be enjoyed and savored as a sweep of wild imagination.  There is a love story here, and it plays louder than usual in a Cirque production.  The artistry, the gymnastics, the athleticism, the scenery, the costumes, the colors swirling are wonderful. The music is marvelous.The cheap circus is played to the hilt in the opening scenes.  Then the magical circus takes over and buries the listener with wave after wave of the magnificent scenes from Ka, O, and Love.  I have only seen one of these, and want to see the other two even more now that I have had a taste of them.  But to enjoy this you have to let your imagination run wild, accepting lots of motion, characters, and superfluous action.  But that is the fun of the Cirque style - Beautiful action and costumes with lots of gymnastics, athleticism, surrounded by swirling music unique to this world. Of course, much of this does not make sense in the usual sense of a movie or even a circus.  You just have to ride with the flow, awed and mesmerized by the wild imaginations that dream this stuff up.I applaud Cirque du Soleil for allowing James Cameron and Andrew Adamson to take scenes from their shows, merge them into another sequence, and make more mystery and magic for those of us that love Cirque.",5,Fantasia by Circue du Soliel,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,1600,"['Worlds', 'Away', 'magnificent', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'composite', 'Ka', 'O', 'Love', 'three', 'Cirque', 'shows', 'Los', 'Vegas', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'trip', 'magical', 'fantasia', 'musical', 'dance', 'world', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'have', 'dvd', 'magical', 'kingdom', 'unto', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'savored', 'sweep', 'wild', 'imagination', 'love', 'story', 'here', 'louder', 'usual', 'Cirque', 'production', 'artistry', 'gymnastics', 'athleticism', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'colors', 'swirling', 'are', 'wonderful', 'music', 'marvelous.The', 'cheap', 'circus', 'played', 'hilt', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Then', 'magical', 'circus', 'listener', 'wave', 'wave', 'magnificent', 'scenes', 'Ka', 'O', 'Love', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'want', 'see', 'other', 'two', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'have', 'had', 'taste', 'enjoy', 'have', 'let', 'imagination', 'run', 'wild', 'accepting', 'lots', 'motion', 'characters', 'superfluous', 'action', 'fun', 'Cirque', 'style', 'Beautiful', 'action', 'costumes', 'lots', 'gymnastics', 'athleticism', 'surrounded', 'swirling', 'music', 'unique', 'world', 'course', 'much', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'usual', 'sense', 'movie', 'even', 'circus', 'just', 'have', 'ride', 'flow', 'awed', 'mesmerized', 'wild', 'imaginations', 'dream', 'stuff', 'up.I', 'applaud', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'allowing', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'take', 'scenes', 'shows', 'merge', 'sequence', 'make', 'more', 'mystery', 'magic', 'love', 'Cirque']",N/A

1611307,A2QWEFSPX33C5L,B00AIBZJLG,Modrnknght,"[108, 119]","THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE 3D BLU-RAY.I will start this review the way I felt when I first saw it in the movie theater...1. You have to LOVE Cirque Du Soleil. Not just ""like""...you have to love them.2. Don't spend even one second trying to analyse the plot. It's about a young woman who is mesmerized with a young male aerialist and she tries to find him again when they are separated. Everything else are sections of different Las Vegas Cirque shows and even in their entirety don't always make sense. If you try to understand why this is here or that is there, you will run out screaming. Turn off your brain and just let your eyes enjoy all the spectacular.3. It helps a lot to have seen at least a few of these shows in Las Vegas because the movie selects some of the best parts from each.  This will be sort of a video souvenir book for you.4. Did I mention you have to LOVE Cirque du Soleil?The thrilling sequences that the couple encounter individually are from the Las Vegas productions of ""O,"" ""Ka!"", ""The Beatles' Love,"" ""Mystere,"" ""Chris Angel's Believe,"" ""Zumanity,"" and ""Viva Elvis!""...and they come back together for a romantic aerial (updated from ""Ka!"").The 3D was spectacular on the movie screen and I have absolutely no qualms about giving it a full 5 of 5 for the 3D Blu-ray.  Scenes from ""O"" will have you putting down towels in case of water spilling out of your TV.  There is excellent depth and a few really wonderful popouts.  Colors are glorious!!!I have been to most of these shows in Las Vegas.  While I feel there is never ever any way to capture the experience of seeing them live, especially when performers fly overhead of you, this film does something that seeing it live never could: you will never see the performers this close up, no matter how good a seat you have.  The 3D cameras would occasionally be anywhere from 40 to 80 feet in the air, right there with the performers.Audio is likewise a 5 out of 5.  Great sound all around the room.  (Speaking of music, my favorite Cirque show in Vegas is ""The Beatles' Love"" and there are about six scenes from it (with Beatles music in the film, too), including ""Get Back,"" ""Octopus's Garden,"" ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,"" ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"", ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" and the film ends with a group shot of curtain moments for the different show casts set to ""All You Need Is Love.""  ""Love"" fans, rejoice!)Extras are really minimal and are located on the 2D Blu-ray disc.  A behind-the-scenes look with James Cameron that is only about 2-3 minutes long.  There is a featurette with star Erica Linz that looks at creating a series of acrobatic moves, and that 10-15 minutes is only minimally interesting.  The remaining extra is an ad for several Vegas Cirque shows.For fans of Cirque du Soleil and 3D, this comes highly recommended.",5,A must see for fans of Cirque's Las Vegas shows!,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,2840,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'THE', '3D', 'BLU-RAY.I', 'will', 'start', 'review', 'way', 'felt', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', '1', 'have', 'LOVE', 'Cirque', 'Du', 'Soleil', 'Not', 'just', 'have', 'love', 'them.2', 'Do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'even', 'one', 'second', 'trying', 'analyse', 'plot', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'mesmerized', 'young', 'male', 'aerialist', 'find', 'again', 'when', 'are', 'separated', 'Everything', 'else', 'are', 'sections', 'different', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Cirque', 'shows', 'even', 'entirety', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'try', 'understand', 'why', 'here', 'there', 'will', 'run', 'out', 'screaming', 'Turn', 'off', 'brain', 'just', 'let', 'eyes', 'enjoy', 'spectacular.3', 'lot', 'have', 'seen', 'least', 'few', 'shows', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'movie', 'best', 'parts', 'will', 'be', 'sort', 'video', 'souvenir', 'book', 'you.4', 'Did', 'mention', 'have', 'LOVE', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'thrilling', 'sequences', 'couple', 'encounter', 'individually', 'are', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'productions', 'O', 'Ka', 'Beatles', 'Love', 'Mystere', 'Chris', 'Angel', 'Believe', 'Zumanity', 'Viva', 'Elvis', 'come', 'back', 'together', 'romantic', 'aerial', 'updated', 'Ka', '.The', '3D', 'was', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'screen', 'have', 'absolutely', 'qualms', 'giving', 'full', '5', '5', '3D', 'Blu-ray', 'Scenes', 'O', 'will', 'have', 'putting', 'down', 'towels', 'case', 'water', 'spilling', 'TV', 'excellent', 'depth', 'few', 'really', 'wonderful', 'popouts', 'Colors', 'are', 'glorious', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'shows', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'feel', 'never', 'ever', 'way', 'capture', 'experience', 'seeing', 'live', 'especially', 'when', 'performers', 'fly', 'overhead', 'film', 'something', 'seeing', 'live', 'never', 'could', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'performers', 'close', 'up', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'seat', 'have', '3D', 'cameras', 'would', 'occasionally', 'be', 'anywhere', '40', '80', 'feet', 'air', 'right', 'performers.Audio', 'likewise', '5', '5', 'Great', 'sound', 'room', 'Speaking', 'music', 'favorite', 'Cirque', 'show', 'Vegas', 'Beatles', 'Love', 'are', 'six', 'scenes', 'Beatles', 'music', 'film', 'too', 'including', 'Get', 'Back', 'Octopus', 'Garden', 'Lucy', 'Sky', 'Diamonds', 'Being', 'Benefit', 'Mr', 'Kite', 'My', 'Guitar', 'Gently', 'Weeps', 'film', 'group', 'shot', 'curtain', 'moments', 'different', 'show', 'set', 'All', 'Need', 'Love', 'Love', 'fans', 'rejoice', 'Extras', 'are', 'really', 'minimal', 'are', 'located', '2D', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'James', 'Cameron', 'only', '2-3', 'minutes', 'long', 'featurette', 'star', 'Erica', 'Linz', 'creating', 'series', 'acrobatic', 'moves', '10-15', 'minutes', 'only', 'minimally', 'interesting', 'remaining', 'extra', 'ad', 'several', 'Vegas', 'Cirque', 'shows.For', 'fans', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', '3D', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

(This starts a bit slow but hang in there, you get used to the pace and it's a great show.) I always wanted to see a live performance in Vegas but it's pretty pricey for me and will probably never happen - so I was THRILLED to have the opportunity to see them perform in this movie.  I was not disappointed at all!The acrobatics, the skill, the choreography, the fantastic sets etc. are about impossible NOT to appreciate.  The acrobatics, by the way, are somewhat creepy at times but even still you just can't help but appreciate the incredible control and talent of these artists - it's fantastic, sometimes sensual and perhaps erotic (but G rated so it's ok for the kids to watch)I believe you have to think of this movie like watching a weird dream - a circus kind of dream. And, you don't have to ""understand"" it to appreciate it.  Just enjoy the show, the costumes, the talent, the cool sets, the pure fantasy of it all.There IS a loose ""story"" of sorts to this dialogue-free show...  A young girl goes to a circus and is watching an aerialist IN WHITE PANTS who falls (30+ feet?) to the sand of the circus ring floor which collapses to suck him in (like falling into the sand in the top part of an hour-glass).  She rushes from the audience seats to help him when he falls and gets sucked in too - into another circus type world/dimension.  Turns out he's been ""captured"".  She see's many cool circus acts in this new place as she looks for him.  And there is a ""battle"" of sorts (all on visible wires, but it doesn't matter that you can see the wires because it's just cool to watch and you can't help but appreciate the precision of choreography and all to keep that many wires from getting crossed/tangled while they do all this, and - small spoiler:  the captured (WHITE PANTS) aerialist is freed.  Once freed, he goes wandering around and like the girl, he also sees some incredible things.About 3/5 of the way through, the WHITE PANTS aerialist and the girl almost find each other but are kept apart.  The girl seems to walk out of the circus tent area (back to where they fell through??) and a group of the people that helped rescue the WHITE PANTS guy come across her and she tries to show them the flier/picture of the guy she's looking for but before they can help her they are attacked by creatures and the girl falls into a chasm or something. (Then comes a spiked wall fight with NO wires).Eventually, the girl wakes up in a safe place and the guy in the WHITE PANTS finds her and they do some aerial stuff together, flirt, play and fall in love...All in all it's pretty cool - fantastic even.

Other than the trailer, I had no previous knowledge about what I could expect (I have never been to any Cirque du Soleil show before).""Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away 3D"" (91 min.) brings a very simple story line (girl meet boy (the Aerialist) at a circus, boy disappears into a bottomless pit, girl chases after boy and eventually she finds him) to various scenes from a smorgasbord of Cirque du Soleil shows. There is of course no dialogue, so the visuals and the music are key in any such movie. First as to the music, I thought it was rather bland and uneven, but then midway into the movie we get a huge chunk of Beatles songs (Blackbird; Octopus's Garden; Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds; For the Benefit of Mr. Kite; Get Back; and later also While My Guitar Gently Weeps as the credits start), and immediately the movie perks up for me. As to the performances, they are outstanding and at times jaw-dropping (I particularly liked the trampoline performances set to the Viva Elvis music, but also the extended closing aerial ballet piece between the 2 protagonists is outstanding).Several comments: first, it wasn't until the credits started rolling that I realized this movie is in essence a ""greatest hits""/""best of"" Cirque du Soleil as it is made clear that all these scenes come from existing shows. Second, despite this being executive produced by James ""Avatar"" Cameron, I didn't feel like the 3D played all that an important role in enjoying the movie.

I mean come on, there is so much you can do with the plot! Unfortunately...it was pretty disappointing.What makes me love Cirque Du Soleil is that it's not just circus- there's a story that flows throughout the show and the stunts are more like works of art. This movie lacked in both. The scenes just didn't fit. They seemed to be cut out of other movies and put together.The biggest turn-off was the variation in music. First it was mystical chanting then it turned into something else which led into elvis which somehow led into the beetles...it just did not work for me. It started out as an adventure in Wonderland and quickly turned into a 'Best of' compilation. Because of this, it felt like I had already seen most of the acts.The story didn't flow. Each act usually contributes something to the story, but this really didn't have that.
