At home, its just fun to watch in 2D and enjoy the music.So the moral of this review is, read the product descriptions of things.next someone will complain ""Oh, the castle in it was Haunted!

Everyone I have shown this movie to loves it and has commented on how cool it is. The combination of the fantastic 3D effects plus surround sound give this little flick something truly special! I'd give the ""Haunted Castle"" 100 stars if I could.....just because it is so cool.This movie would not be nearly as entertaining in 2D or with average sound. If your lucky enough to own a pair of LCD shutter glasses and have a semi decent surround system --and you have not seen the ""Haunted Castle""-- I would seriously recommend you stop what your doing and purchase it immediately.For all you other suckers out there- get yourselves some shutter glasses, get that TV cranked up and check out the ""Haunted Castle"".

After I got my ""Ultimate 3D Collection"" assortment (which also included ""Alien Adventure"" and ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"" IMAX DVDs), the first movie I had to see was ""Haunted Castle"", since I love to go ghost investigating when I can get the free time and people to join me.  Sure, the movie doesn't even comes close to anything realistic in the field of paranormal investigation, but as a 3D CGI fun ride, it's awesome.  I can see that it would be quite boring in 2D, but I watched it with the accompanying Razor 3D shutter glasses (put out by edimensional) and was totally blown away.  Got my mother to sit in and enjoy the film as well.  We were both loving the dimensional effects, and more importantly, the fantastic music.  If it wasn't for ""Haunted Castle,"" I would never have known about ""Lunascape"".  Can't wait to get their ""Reminiscence"" album, which has the ""Lane Navachi"" song from this movie on it.  ""Arid"" is also excellent in the movie, though ""Little Things of Venom"" is really the only good song from their album ""At The Close Of Every Day"".  As for the CGI in the movie, it kind of reminds me of the first two ""Myst"" games for computers.  Really, the only thing that dates it is the globular effect used for when the three knights melt at the beginning of the film.  Everything else is still excellent.  My only complaint would be that the roller coaster segment doesn't go fast enough and wasn't more like the CGI ""Devil's Mine Ride"" short film (which can be found on the ""Computer Animation Festival 2.0"" video, if you can find a copy).  If you love IMAX and 3D movies, get ""Haunted Castle"".
