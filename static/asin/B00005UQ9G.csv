685252,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00005UQ9G,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 1]","Attribute #1 is that director Julien Temple shows us rather than tells us his vision of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his  creative process, especially given that STC was an obsessive-compulsive, addictive, visionary genius.  I liked director Temple's &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; but I adore this work.  Attribute #2 is actor Linus Roache who plays Coleridge.  Roache knocked me out before in &quot;Wings of the Dove&quot; and &quot;Priest&quot; and he does it again here.  He is an incredible talent and I'm beginning to lose count of how many leading men actors from the UK I can say this about!  It seems as if acting talent must move within the populace there like a virulent virus. This is a very artistic film with Temple's and Roache's collaborative efforts.  Some viewers are complaining about historical accuracy but all I can say is that I wish this film had been around when I was studying &quot;The Ancient Mariner&quot; in high school.  It would have been experienced then as an intense multi media event. I hope some 10th grade English teacher somewhere is using it that way.  Everyone else in the film does a very fine job too. The production values are marvelous.

685253,ASNE6WU6V6P2N,B00005UQ9G,Craig Larson,"[2, 2]","I saw the movie on DVD and really enjoyed it.  I was reminded of a similar film, _Haunted Summer_, which portrays the meeting of Percy Shelley and Lord Byron.  I guess I thought Wordsworth and Coleridge were more friendly than this (and maybe they were) in reality.  The film sure is biased towards Coleridge.  Wordsworth comes off very badly--he gives up on his revolutionary principles, marries a shrewish wife, and seems only interested in how he will be viewed by posterity.  Wordsworth goes to visit Coleridge and to collaborate with him, but can't seem to put a single word to paper.  Then, suddenly, _Lyrical Ballads_ is finished and published and filled with Wordsworth's poetry!The performances are excellent, particularly Linus Roache as Coleridge and Emily Woof as Dorothy Wordsworth.  The film is a bit odd at times, with jet trails moving across the skies of the 18th century, but it does a great job of getting at the creative impulse, showing the feverish bouts of imagination that gave rise to Coleridge's _Rime of the Ancient Mariner_ and the fragment _Kubla Khan_ (interesting that it shows an interruption by Wordsworth as the cause of STC losing his train of thought).  Also, the scene with frost forming on the window while Coleridge cares for his son Hartley, leading to one of his more memorable early poems, is a standout.  This film is well worth your time and isn't the boring, stodgy take on biography that some might be fearing.",5,Very Enjoyable Film--Definitely Not Boring or Stodgy,1017964800,"04 5, 2002",2002,1456,"['saw', 'movie', 'DVD', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'reminded', 'similar', 'film', '_Haunted', 'Summer_', 'meeting', 'Percy', 'Shelley', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'guess', 'thought', 'Wordsworth', 'Coleridge', 'were', 'more', 'friendly', 'maybe', 'were', 'reality', 'film', 'sure', 'biased', 'towards', 'Coleridge', 'Wordsworth', 'off', 'very', 'badly', 'up', 'revolutionary', 'principles', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'only', 'interested', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'posterity', 'Wordsworth', 'visit', 'Coleridge', 'collaborate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'put', 'single', 'word', 'paper', 'Then', 'suddenly', '_Lyrical', 'Ballads_', 'finished', 'published', 'filled', 'Wordsworth', 'poetry', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'Coleridge', 'Emily', 'Woof', 'Dorothy', 'Wordsworth', 'film', 'bit', 'odd', 'times', 'jet', 'trails', 'moving', 'skies', '18th', 'century', 'great', 'job', 'getting', 'creative', 'impulse', 'showing', 'feverish', 'bouts', 'imagination', 'gave', 'rise', 'Coleridge', '_Rime', 'Ancient', 'Mariner_', 'fragment', '_Kubla', 'Khan_', 'interesting', 'interruption', 'Wordsworth', 'cause', 'STC', 'losing', 'train', 'thought', 'Also', 'scene', 'frost', 'forming', 'window', 'Coleridge', 'cares', 'son', 'Hartley', 'leading', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'early', 'poems', 'standout', 'film', 'well', 'time', ""n't"", 'boring', 'stodgy', 'take', 'biography', 'might', 'be', 'fearing']",N/A
685254,A84TOOCIEF6FX,B00005UQ9G,David Webb,"[0, 1]",It is hard to make a film about poets that might appeal to any audience. In this case the use of opium by Coleridge and his relationship with Wordsworth adds a phantasmagoric aspect to this drama. Linus Roache (Law & Order) gives a disturbing and gripping performance as a man of genius addicted to opium. This adds to his genius but also has a destructive effect on his persona and family. I am no scholar but I think that the film is probably an exaggeration of actual events BUT it is only a film. It might induce one to actually read some of the poets represented in the film. While this is a period drama the filmmaker included images of modern buildings and con trails for some strange reason. These did not add to the film and were a slight and unnecessary distraction.

685256,AT1EDRWEBE5TE,B00005UQ9G,"Jody Schiesser ""interplanetary cowboy""","[0, 0]","Pandaemonium is one of the better films I've seen in a long time.  Some of its themes are much like the ideas (ala Hassan i Sabbah &amp; assassins &amp; hunger for paradise) that have attracted me lately.  It is about the poets Wordsworth &amp; Samuel Taylor Coleridge (who wrote &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;).  The exploration of the creative force, mingled with the seeking to see deep into reality is amazing (Coleridge tried to do it with opium, and both succeeded and kind of destroyed himself in the process).  The movie is based on real history but I think it took some liberties to make it a more powerful story.  Coleridge also wrote &quot;The Ancient Mariner,&quot; and that poem is incredible, I've even more taken by it to see it so lushly explored in a visual sense in how the idea and language came to Coleridge.  There's some really funny parts too, like a time when they eat datura and almost fall up off the world (or their perceptions convince them they are about to, and then they start playing with it, realizing the joke, but still pretending that they can fall up.)  There's a scholarly literary study on Coleridge published in 1927 called &quot;The Road to Xanadu - A Study in the Ways of the Imagination&quot; by John Livingstone Lowes, a brilliant book, and I wonder if the filmmakers got many of their ideas and details from that book.",5,A Study in the Ways of the Imagination,1035849600,"10 29, 2002",2002,1355,"['Pandaemonium', 'one', 'better', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'themes', 'are', 'much', 'ideas', 'Hassan', 'i', 'Sabbah', 'amp', 'amp', 'hunger', 'paradise', 'have', 'attracted', 'lately', 'poets', 'Wordsworth', 'amp', 'Samuel', 'Taylor', 'Coleridge', 'who', 'wrote', 'quot', 'Kubla', 'Khan', 'quot', 'exploration', 'creative', 'force', 'mingled', 'seeking', 'see', 'deep', 'reality', 'amazing', 'Coleridge', 'tried', 'do', 'opium', 'succeeded', 'kind', 'destroyed', 'process', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'history', 'think', 'took', 'liberties', 'make', 'more', 'powerful', 'story', 'Coleridge', 'also', 'wrote', 'quot', 'Ancient', 'Mariner', 'quot', 'poem', 'incredible', ""'ve"", 'even', 'more', 'taken', 'see', 'so', 'lushly', 'explored', 'visual', 'sense', 'how', 'idea', 'language', 'came', 'Coleridge', 'really', 'funny', 'parts', 'too', 'time', 'when', 'eat', 'datura', 'almost', 'fall', 'up', 'world', 'perceptions', 'convince', 'are', 'then', 'start', 'playing', 'realizing', 'joke', 'still', 'pretending', 'can', 'fall', 'up', 'scholarly', 'literary', 'study', 'Coleridge', 'published', '1927', 'called', 'quot', 'Road', 'Xanadu', 'Study', 'Ways', 'Imagination', 'quot', 'John', 'Livingstone', 'Lowes', 'brilliant', 'book', 'wonder', 'filmmakers', 'got', 'many', 'ideas', 'details', 'book']",N/A
685257,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B00005UQ9G,L. J Nary,"[2, 2]","This movie is mostly poetry weaving its way through the plot. When I first started watching I liked the visual imagery but I thought this is going to be a real dud. As I began watching and letting go, I got swept up in this movie. It was like listening to a beautiful piece of music. There is a storyline, it is about two poets, one of which I was familiar with, Wordsworth and the other, played by Linus Roach, Crane I think the poets name was. The jealously and rivalry which seemed to come more from Wordsworth was basically what the film was reflecting but the shots were really breathless and the words so perfect! This movie really stirred me. The creativity was really rolling inside after I got done with the picture. I love Samantha Morton and wanted to see it because she was in it. But Linus Roach really stole the show. What a wonderful actor and handsome man he is! I saw him in Wings of the Dove, he was good in that film but in this movie he shines much brighter. When the credits roll at the end keep tuned in and see a really neat video at the end. The movie was also how poetry changed and was based in nature and experiences with nature. I couldn't ask for more. Two of my favorite things, beautiful scenes of nature and poetry, really well worth my time. If you are not really interested in poetry or dialog based in poetry, this movie may not be worth your time. It can take awhile to creep up on you, but stay with it.

Halkin ""Tim""","[13, 15]","I am not a historian, and have not read either William Wordsworth's accounts of his relationship with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, or visa versa.  Before going into this film I was vaguely aware of their friendship, turned rivalry.  Based on the 2 reviews available on Amazon.com, I almost didn't buy this DVD.However, I weighed the facts:  I love both the poems of Coleridge and of Wordsworth that I have read.  They are epic and broad in scope, as well as eloquent and lyrical.  I am also an admirer of both Linus Roache and John Hannah's work, and find Julian Temple an interesting director to say the least.  I thought: how bad could this combination be?  My didactical reasoning won out and I bought and viewed this film, and I'm glad of it. And I can only recommend that others follow my lead.Is it historically accurate?  As far as I know, which is not a lot, in this matter - no! That said, it is trying to make a statement, not be a documentary.  Is Wordsworth displayed as an ogre in favor of praising Coleridge's drug-assisted genius?  Not really.  Wordsworth's opinion - that Coleridge's genius was not worth every price - was fairly portrayed in the film. Coleridge's drug addition is also not prettied up, or made to look romantic.  Fair is fair. They were both geniuses in their own right, but - like us all - mortals as well, with all the flaws that go with it.  They obviously became rivals, which is also - unfortunately - very human; we the audience have the opportunity to recognize that we don't need to choose between them.Panning this film for its historical inaccuracies is like the Maritimer shooting the albatross...it goes against the nature of the thing.  Experience the film as a poem, and relax about the details.  Isn't that what both of their poetry tried to teach us?Beautifully acted and magnificently filmed.
