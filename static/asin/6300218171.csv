I remember being scared but completely absorbed in the story on a very visceral level.  As an adult I read ""King Rat,"" and then started on ""Shogun"" and so I really wanted to watch the series again.  Fortunately, it is on DVD.  I was just as entranced by the series as an adult as I was as a child, only my focus was different.  The love story presented in the series is really very beautiful and I think the story line really capitalizes on the male perspective of what romance is.  Although I enjoyed the sections of the plot that centered around the intrigues and warfare that accompanied Toranaga's rise to power, it was the love story that interested me the most and really touched me.

Taking place during a period when all of Europe was competing for the riches of the world, the story starts off with the last  ship of a lost fleet, down to a skeleton crew (in size as well as health)  trying to find &quot;the Japans&quot;. Pilot-Major John Blackthorn, played  well by Richard Chamberlain, wakes up on shore in Japan after barely making  to land. Used to being in control, he is swept up in all the politics and  violence that this period of Japan could offer. In just the first day alone  he sees a beheading, is forced to listen to one of his crew boiled to  death, and must endure the shame of having a Samurai &quot;relieve  himself&quot; on his back. He then becomes a pawn between two lords, the  brutal Ishido, and the cunning Toranaga. As Blackthorn begins to understand  the culture, he also begins to build his own power and worth, causing  Toranaga to realize the value of the Englishman.Throughout this  mini-series the photography is stunning, the action impressive, and the  romance steamy. The acting here is also probably the best overall of any  epic film. The film follows closely to the book with minor exceptions, and  keeps the viewer riveted throughout the entire series. Also the continual  battle between Blackthorn and the Jesuit Priest, Father Alvito, seems to  have been written to match the feud between Ishido and Toranaga. Both feuds  are intense and gut-wrenching, leading though to different types of  endings.This series is a great story, told well, and captures the  imagination quickly. I would recommend this to any viewer who likes an  action-packed and entertaining adventure. Just be prepared: There are some  scenes that are a little violent. This was necessary to get the feel for  how violent this period was in Japan, however it can still be a wee bit  disturbing.

224201,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,6300218171,Carl Malmstrom,"[55, 68]","This is not an easy series to review because I find myself of two minds about it.  The story itself I find highly enjoyable and evocative of classical Japanese romance, if not exactly true to the form.  The history behind it, however, leaves something to be desired.The series is a surprisingly faithful adaptation of the book, and the mini-series format gives the story the depth needed to tell Clavell's book properly.  The costumes and settings are impressive (if possibly a bit more elaborate than history would require) and the story is a complex, well told one.  The style and pace of the story are even reminiscent of some classical Japanese romances like &quot;Gonza the Spearman&quot; or &quot;Double Suicide&quot;.  The ultimate moral and conclusion differ somewhat from the traditional Japanese, but then again, the intention was not to sell &quot;Shogun&quot; to a Japanese audience.The history, however, is a bit disappointing.  While the story of Blackthorne (Will Adams in real life) is a true one, Clavell paints an image of a Japan that is much more stratified and romantic than was actually the case at the time.  Tokugawa Ieyasu (Toranaga, played by Toshiro Mifune) actually codified and enforced the samurai code that Clavell has in place for the story.  The samurai and daimyo of the story are much more stylized than you would actually have found then.  For the type of samurai shown in this movie, one would need to jump about a hundred years foward.  Historically, the samurai of this movie would have been somewhat more like those seen in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (another Mifune movie).I am also somewhat confused as to why Clavell seemed to find the need to change the names of all of the historical characters of the movie.  If it was to distance the characters from the actual history, then it was probably a good idea.  However, if his intention was a historically accurate book or series (which I rather doubt) his decision is rather puzzling.On the technical side, the presentation of the series is a 'book-style' case with a booklet about the series (with lots of trivia and useful Japanese phrases) is quite nice.  I regret the producers' decision to compress the episodes together rather than to give a separate opening and ending for each, but it is a minor complaint.  I would love to see what they could do with this as a DVD release.All in all, though, &quot;Shogun&quot; is a lot of fun to watch.  The Japan presented is the Japan of American fantasy, but that is fine if you're watching it for the entertainment value.  If your interest in Japan tends towards the casual or your interest in James Clavell towards the serious, I recommend the entire mini-series.",4,"Entertaining, If Not Masterful...",979516800,"01 15, 2001",2001,2703,"['not', 'easy', 'series', 'review', 'find', 'two', 'minds', 'story', 'find', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'evocative', 'classical', 'Japanese', 'romance', 'not', 'exactly', 'true', 'form', 'history', 'however', 'something', 'be', 'desired.The', 'series', 'surprisingly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'mini-series', 'format', 'story', 'depth', 'needed', 'tell', 'Clavell', 'book', 'properly', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'impressive', 'possibly', 'bit', 'more', 'elaborate', 'history', 'would', 'require', 'story', 'complex', 'well', 'told', 'one', 'style', 'pace', 'story', 'are', 'even', 'reminiscent', 'classical', 'Japanese', 'romances', 'quot', 'Gonza', 'Spearman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Double', 'Suicide', 'quot', 'ultimate', 'moral', 'conclusion', 'differ', 'somewhat', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'then', 'again', 'intention', 'was', 'not', 'sell', 'quot', 'Shogun', 'quot', 'Japanese', 'audience.The', 'history', 'however', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'story', 'Blackthorne', 'Will', 'Adams', 'real', 'life', 'true', 'one', 'Clavell', 'image', 'Japan', 'much', 'more', 'stratified', 'romantic', 'was', 'actually', 'case', 'time', 'Tokugawa', 'Ieyasu', 'Toranaga', 'played', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'actually', 'codified', 'enforced', 'samurai', 'code', 'Clavell', 'place', 'story', 'samurai', 'daimyo', 'story', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'stylized', 'would', 'actually', 'have', 'found', 'then', 'type', 'samurai', 'shown', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'need', 'jump', 'hundred', 'years', 'foward', 'Historically', 'samurai', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'more', 'seen', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'Mifune', 'movie', '.I', 'am', 'also', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'why', 'Clavell', 'seemed', 'find', 'need', 'change', 'names', 'historical', 'characters', 'movie', 'was', 'distance', 'characters', 'actual', 'history', 'then', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'idea', 'However', 'intention', 'was', 'historically', 'accurate', 'book', 'series', 'rather', 'doubt', 'decision', 'rather', 'puzzling.On', 'technical', 'side', 'presentation', 'series', ""'book-style"", 'case', 'booklet', 'series', 'lots', 'trivia', 'useful', 'Japanese', 'phrases', 'quite', 'nice', 'regret', 'producers', 'decision', 'compress', 'episodes', 'together', 'rather', 'give', 'separate', 'opening', 'ending', 'minor', 'complaint', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'DVD', 'release.All', 'quot', 'Shogun', 'quot', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Japan', 'presented', 'Japan', 'American', 'fantasy', 'fine', ""'re"", 'watching', 'entertainment', 'value', 'interest', 'Japan', 'towards', 'casual', 'interest', 'James', 'Clavell', 'serious', 'recommend', 'entire', 'mini-series']",N/A

So many other people have done such a marvelous job of describing the movie I would surely fall well short of their prose. I do feel compelled to discuss the movie though and give you my thoughts, because I just fell in love with it, much like the film Casablanca. As others, I think this is the best mini-series I have watched. The story line of the movie was quite different from the book, and at first I found that disturbing, but the second time I watched it I found myself captivated by the story, the majesty, the acting, the beauty of Yuko Shimoto (the Lady Toda Mariko Buntaro), and a portion of the ending that I thought was fit for the way the story was adapted and written for TV. This being when Blackthorne gave to Omi-san the most precious gift he could give him. Omi was a man whom he had originally hated and despised beyond measure, but had come to respect and call friend in the end.Yes, I fell in love with Mariko-san in the book, and most assuredly in the movie. What man, who prefers to be with a woman, could not love such a wonderous, intelligent and most beautiful and pristine woman, neh? hehe The second bedroom scene ( first day out of Yokese) between Blackthorne and Mariko I think is the most romantic scene I have seen in the movies. There was no nudity, or obvious physical bonding, just a dialogue and a look that proved that their love was on a spiritual plane, not just pillowing, as the book called it, the physical bonding of a man and woman. They were as soul mates, much like the movie &quot;Serendipity&quot;, which I like immensely. The look on Yuko Shimodo's face was so radiant, and her eyes so beguiling. Such a beautiful and wonderful actress for this role. Who could not love her, neh? I would think anyone watching it would feel the sensuality and spiritual bonding that Clavell tried to covey and did in such a beautiful way in the book, as well as the movie.I have read much about Chamberlain's acting in this role. It could have been better I think. I have thought allot about who would be better at that period of time to act in the role, but I can't think of anyone. The only two that come to mind in recent times are James Caviezel because I liked him so much in the role of the &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (that movie being a complete rewrite of the book, which was a shame in my opinion). The other being Daniel Day-Lewis, who I thought was fabulous in the movie, &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;. I think each would make a better Blackthorne, but this is 24 years later, hehe. And now I just remembered that Chamberlain also played the role of the Count in an earlier version of the classic. I guess maybe the casting people see the same type of man in the role of Blackthorne. I think they did a marvelous job nonetheless.A few words on the characters. We all get caught up in the majesty of the time. It was a feudal period in Japans history, and this story is about the priviledged minority: a very small minority. The lady Toda for instance is, according to the book, the 4th most highly revered woman in Japan. It is so easy to get caught up in that kind of pagentry as we read about it and get lost in the book as we become one with the characters, or also watch the movie and do the same. I am reminded of a scene from &quot;History of the World II&quot; where Mel Brookes removes his head from the buxom bosom of a fair damesel and proclaims, &quot;IT IS GOOD TO BE KING&quot;, hehe. Certainly this movie and the book make that statement so true. I don't think I would like living in feudal Japan as a peasant, or eta. I am certain I would love to have lived there as a lord though, just as Pilot Major John Blackthorne, Anjin-san: Samurai, Hatamoto, Admiral of the Fleet and most highly regarded confidant, vassal and friend to his liege lord, Toranaga-sama, the Shogun (the military ruler of all Japan).I hope you have enjoyed my thoughts. I hope you watch the movie, but more importantly, read the book. The book is, as always, so much better.I highly recommend this movie and of course the book to anyone who loves to learn and read and loves a good story. It is one of the most captivating stories I have read. I learned allot of Japanese from the book, as well as the movie too. That was a plus. By the way, Blackthorne could speak fluently in 5 languages, and he was learning Japanese, the 6th. Lady Toda could speak 3. That did not come out in the movie. A few extra hours in the series could have made so many behind the scenes intrigue and knowledge of the characters become apparent.

Surprisingly, all of these have dated extremely well, mostly because they are all epic, memorable stories from a different era; but also because they are all well-made films with talented actors and huge budgets.  ""Shogun"" is perhaps the most expensive of the three boasting detailed sets, lavish costuming, and a large cast of extras.  There are many notable performaces in the show, the acting all around being very good.  The best part of the show is actually what is missing:  subtitles.  Having a show with so much spoken Japanese would normally demand subtitles, but the creators manage to do without with the use of characters translating and/or the voice of Orson Welles chiming in narrating over the more complex sequences.  Subtitles would take away from relating to the main character who is a stranger in a strange land that gradually picks up on phrases as he explores their culture.  This is indeed an expensive production, but the DVD is also very expensive.  If you are like me and your heart is set on seeing this show then go ahead and spend the cash, but ""The Thorn Birds"" is just as epic and lengthy and is half the price.

I have watched these DVD's several times now, and the set wears well. Certainly, it is one of the finest and most faithful adaptations of a book you will ever see.This DVD set was made from the re-broadcast version.  Compared to the original version, several short, minor scenes have been cut, and voice-over narration added in places.  Take for example the scene in which Lord Toranaga confronts Lord Yabu.  In the original broadcast, there was only a single subtitle at the beginning of the scene: ""Lord Yabu's treachery revealed"".  From the action and the actor's expressions, a viewer immediately can understands what is happening, and in my opinion the word-for-word voice over narration of the actual dialogue detracts more than it adds. I understand that the director's intent originally was for the viewer to experience the scene as Blackthorne with his limited fluency in Japanese would have.I've been to Japan a number of times since I first saw this series, and I am now amused to understand where and how some scenes were filmed.  The scene in which Blackthorne goes to to Osaka-Jo (castle) was filmed at both Himeji-Jo and Hikone-Jo: the procession enters at Himeji-Jo,  walks under the bridge at Hikone-Jo, then returns to Himeji-Jo.

Born on October 10th, 1924 under the name of Charles Edmund Dumaresq Clavell, the writer has such eloquent style that reading his works is like living his adventures.Clavell is the son of a British Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia. At the age of 16, he joined the Royal Artillery and was sent to Malaya to fight the Japanese, was captured and sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp on Java, later transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore. Clavell went through great distress while a prisoner of war in the hands of the Japanese, therefore, when we read his works, we read from the perspective of a man that has lived experiences that have provided depth of humanity in ways unknown to most of us.With Shogun, he achieves an in-depth and rare look into Japanese culture. If you read the book and watch this series, you end up becoming well versed in the wonders of Japan. It is the story of discovery, of great adventure, of romance, love, a new way to look at relationships and personal growth, for as the character played by Richard Chamberlain, John Blackthorne learns of the ways of Japan, the more he transforms into a new kind of man... no longer English, not necessarily Japanese, but a mixture that bridges two worlds.The world John Blackthorne discovers surfaces a culture where cruelty was part of daily life, where honor was the key to the lives of Samurai worriers, and where men like Toranaga, masterfully played by one of our favorite actors, Toshiro Mifune, live their lives in search for power and control.Through an assigned translator and interpreter, Lady Mariko, beautifully played by Yoko Shimada, John Blackthorne learns to love Japan, enjoys forbidden relationships and opens his heart to the transformation into Samurai. He develops a dictionary, English to Japanese that helps eliminate the language barrier.John Rhys-Davies plays the part of Vasco Rodrigues, a rather colorful individual that will capture your hearts with his interpretation of friend and foe to John Blackthorne.From watching this series as a family, we inspired Katya to learn more about Japan and even take lessons in Japanese. We got so interested in Japanese culture that we visited The Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens, [...] in Boca Raton, Florida and attended a festival and the Tea Ceremony.If you want to experience 10 hours worth of one of the best mini-series ever done, don't miss Shogun, a masterpiece done by Director Jerry London.

224236,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,6300218171,Get Serious,"[2, 4]","James Clavell wrote his Shogun novel in 1975. The film was produced a short time later with great difficulty (according to the backstory). Clavell had an apparent interest in the Far East and Japan in particular, as he was imprisoned under brutal treatment in a Japanese POW camp during WWII.  His books Taipan and Nobel House deal with the creation of Hong Kong by the British. His book King Rat dealt with his own experiences in the POW camp. All have been made into films. According to the producers and director of Shogun, it was extremely difficult to work with the Japanese and work in Japan during the filming and of couse go through so much film footage. The book/film deal with Feudal Japan, the time of Samurai and Warlords and continuous vicious and bloody civil war among them for several thousand years. Watching Shogun or reading the book gives us insight into the minds of the Japanese. There are hundreds of reviews on here, so I won't discuss plot or storyline. Clavell's novel concerns the true activities of a British sailor/navigator named William Adams (1564-1620) who was on the only one of five ships to make it to Japan around the South American cape (Magellan's route); all the rest lost to various catastrophes. Most of Clavell's story line directly reflect Adam's life in Japan.  The exceptions are that Adams was not only allowed to leave Japan, but established trade routes for the Japanese to many destinations for the Dutch and British, some more lucrative than others. Trading during the 1600's was where the wealth was and fortunes were made by adventurous men of the time. Clavell adds a love interest in the story and the film pretty much revolves around this. Primarily the film concerns the petty battles and murders by the various warlords and shows hours of footage of samurai soldiers walking through the forest on their way to meetings with other samurai soldiers. In this respect the film is quite boring, as are most of the love scenes (although I'm sure women would not agree). Some interesting highlights are the Ninja attacks, which are well-done. The Jesuits are portrayed as totally corrupt, helping the Portuguese make outlandish profits for a piece of the pie; which they were and which they did! We get something else from having a film like this in our face for ten hours. Is it possible for an entire country to suffer from a 'small-man' complex, resulting in a mentality of extreme arrogance and viciousness fulfilled by a soldier force of psychotics carrying big knives and murdering everyone who does not 'show respect and worship' to them? Feudal Japan did not enter the 'age of the gun' until later after trading began. Therefore big knives (samurai swords) were the order of the day. What can you do to the human body with a big knife? There are two things...stab it or conveniently whack off its head! And so the Samurai were a soldier force of arrogant bullies hiding behind Bushido and threatening the lives of anyone who opposed them. What is the difference between the civilian and the military worlds...the real difference? In the civilian world differences are solved by negotiation...the military solves things by force (like police do) by threatening your life or killing you. We are reminded of the Japanese actions during WWII at Pearl Harbor, Shanghai, China, Korea and in their POW camps. Buchido and this psychotic arrogance of the samurai prevaled.

Put simply, Shogun is a masterful adaptaion of the James Clavell Novel that translates with complete perfection to the screen. Personally, I have been waiting for the release of this movie on DVD since DVD was invented. The VHS tape was just too expensive, and not good enough quality to merit the honor this film deserves!It is the story of Pilot Major Blackthorn(an English navagator aborad Dutch sailing Ship who lands on the ""Japans"")played by Richard Chamberlain, who is forced to learn the Japanese language and culture because if he does not, his crew and entire villiages will be put to death. He is taught the language and customs through the teachings of Mariko(Yoko Shimada), a japanese lady who is trusted by one of highest lords of Japan: Lord Toranaga(played by Toshiro Mifune). Pilot Major Blackthorn, eventually falls in love with Mariko, and forms a love triangle with Lord Buntaro(Mariko's husband) on their journy to fulfill Lord Toronagas ambition fo becoming a ""Shogun"" warlord.The only title more powerful than Emperor.This is only a infinitessimal glimpse of the plot! It is a huge whilrwind of honor,political boundaries, culture, and tradition amidst a touching story of love. All of which are portayed beautifully in fuedal Japan. The costumes and settings are pristine, and the language is kept as close to the original time period Japanese as was possible for the translations.Just as ""American Yakuza"" (a film from the 1990's)  was true tothe current Japanese language and culture, so was this film true to the ancient culture and language of Japan.The Mini series is a masterpiece. All the performers were perfect in the roles. Which range from Traditional Japanese roles to Spanish traders, to Jesuit priests. If you value history, and cherish tradion, this is a film to covet!

224240,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,6300218171,HAMLET,"[1, 1]","Note: I saw this series with XFinity On Demand.Made in 1980, the mini-series Shogun is based on the novel of the same name by James Clavell (which I've never read, nor even heard about). Richard Chamberlain, Toshiro Mifune, Yoko Shimada, Damien Thomas & John Rhys-Davies (aka Sallah in Raiders Of The Lost Ark & Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, Gimli in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and Mordecai in One Night With The King) star, and they do a great job. Having Citizen Kane himself provide narration was a stroke of genius on the producers' part. It would have been good to see Sean Connery (aka James Bond) as Blackthorne, but for some reason, he balked at doing television, and we ended up with a homosexual as Pilot-Major John Blackthorne, which makes a scene where Blackthorne and Mariko are talking about pillowing very ironic.My gripes with this miniseries are few, and I shall list them. (SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW)I. There were no subtitles for the Japanese dialogue. I know that this may have been done for the feel of authenticity, which I understand (that was Mel Gibson's initial idea when he directed The Passion Of The Christ; good thing he later decided to add subtitles), but it's a great disadvantage for those of us who do not speak Japanese.II. The scene with Kuki and Omi came out of nowhere, as we had never seen them together, and therefore added nothing significant to the plot.III. Implying the final battle between Toranaga and Ishido & the outcome in voice-over made no sense whatsoever.IV. The ending made Toranaga seem less honourable than he had previously been seen as throughout the mini-series, and as more of a power-hungry warlord. It also didn't have a good payoff for Blackthorne, not showing him by Toranaga's side and obsessed with leaving Japan, and what the devil was it with Mariko saying in the letter that SHE was the one behind the burning of the Erasmus? Again, that made no sense whatsoever.Regarding the nude scenes and additional violence available in the European version of the miniseries, I personally have no problem with them. However, keep in mind that the miniseries aired on ABC, which is owned by Disney and they did not allow graphic violence & nudity in their programs (sadly, it's different now, with ABC airing shows like Modern Family and recently greenlighting a pilot from Jennifer Lopez about a homosexual or lesbian couple).Good miniseries, with the exceptions I noted above, and the fact that Chamberlain likes men.

When I was older, I read the novel (it's big and it's got small print, be warned)...and reread and reread it! Granted, there's only so much you can show on TV and only so many hours you can tie up programming, but I think the series does a darn fine job of following the book. For an American TV population probably not very familiar with Japanese customs, this was a fascinating look into a very different world.Even at 7, I felt the finely tuned tensions between the characters. I knew they had to deny what was in their hearts in order to hold to the dictates of society. Don't expect a Hollywood happy ending! This is much more like traditional Japanese stories and legends that end in heartbreaking separation of the hero and heroine for the sake of destiny or duty. If you're an anime or manga fan (like me!), you'll find familiar elements...I absolutely loved the costumes and the settings in this series.

I loved it at the time and nostalgia dictates that I can't claim to review it without bias.The story of a shipwrecked English Pilot in Medieval Japan circa 1600. This mini-series was the first exposure that many people in America had to Samurai, Ninjas and Japanese culture.  One of the most original elements was that the Japanese spoke Japanese and that subtitles only gradually appear as the main character begins to understand Japanese. This was a daring thing to do in a US Television mini-series but I think it really caught people's imagination at the time. I prefer subtitled foreign films anyway! The acting is very good : Lord Toragana is played by none other than Toshiro Mifune (the famous actor from many Kurasawa films I saw many years later) and John Rhys-Davies is unforgettable as Rodrigues. The story is very good although I thought the love story was a little over-emphasized (and perhaps unrealistic)but there's plenty of action for a 10-year old boy.It is surprising but true that James Clavell's novel was inspired by the true story of an English Pilot who was part of a Dutch expedition shipwrecked in Japan around 1600.

Protestant England and the Netherlands are at war with Roman Catholic Spain and Portugal.The story is basically set in the Age of Discovery, in the mid to late 1500s/early 1600s. There is a Dutch ship, the Erasmus, that is piloted by an English navigator, Blackthorn, played extremely well by Richard Chamberlain. The ship seems to get thrown off course, and encounters many severe storms, while unwittingly finding and traversing the secret Straits of Magellan. Despite a tragic loss of most of those on board, the ship is piloted safely away, and continues westward by northwest. Eventually, due in part to the storms, they reach land, and reach &quot;the Japans&quot;, as Blackthorn comments, almost lifeless.Blackthorn awakes in a completely foreign culture, with customs so different from his that he is at a complete loss as what to do. To his shock and dismay, and utter incomprehension, he has landed in Japan during the time of the samurai, an elite military class based on the concepts of bushido, a strict code of honor, and loyalty. There is one westerner there to greet him, Father Alveta, a Jesuit priest from Spain. He and Blackthorn are total and utter enemies from the start, and the priest is his nemesis throughout the film. The local samurai leader puts him in his place, but Blackthorn is noticed by his superiors, and eventually, by the Lord Torunaga, played by Torisho Mifune(who also starred in the famous &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; film of 1954). Blackthorn is recognized as a potentially valuable ally by Torunaga, who, in the course of the film, makes himself supreme military ruler, or Shogun, of Japan, subordinate only to the emperor. Blackthorn is commanded to learn Japanese, and the Lady Toda, played by Yoko Shimada, is his tutor. Of course, he falls madly in love with her, but there love is forbidden, as she is already married to an able samurai. Their love succeeds, despite all of the odds, but ends in tragedy, as she is killed in an assassination attempt on the Shogun. Blackthorn has another pilot as his friend and enemy, the indomitable Vasco Rodriguez, played by John Rhys-Davies.This movie has everything, romance, adventure, intrigue, politics, religion, war, and even earthquakes.

Davis,"[3, 4]","I was lost in thoughts on how to rate this mini series, and decided to go with a 5 star rating.It's a fact that this TV series was extremely popular when it was first aired.And those people, including my parents can't be wrong.In 1980, this TV series set the lower (and higher) limits in TV.OK, three things to consider1) The real-life figure, William Adams.2) The James Clavell's book based on William Adam's life.3) And this TV series.The good thing is they somewhat match in all aspects.CLOSED CAPTIONS:There are many scenes in Japanese only with no subtitles.If you ever tried to learn a foreign language, you'd know this is what, and how it happens.And the director wanted to give the same feeling. No subtitle IS A BRILLIANT idea. And they explain all those details anyway.To me, there were two downsides.In the first episode, in the very first scene (on 54th second) Orson Wells (the narrator) says ""in 1598..."" then it shows the ship, Erasmus from the top but what is it? You see the shadow of the helicopter!!!!!!The second downside was the ending.The real man, William Adams died in 1620. The TV series ends in 1600 or so.I believe there could have been a lot more to that.That's partly because of the book but I'm sure someone will come up with a sequel, sooner or later.I didn't like the ending.The story developed so well, so excellent and perfect and the end came so quickly. It is obvious that it doesn't end there. The ending is of no match with the rest of the series.

The year is around 1603 and Japan is a closed country to foreigners except hostile Jesuit Portuguese Catholic Priests who are the enemy of England, and of Protestants, in which Captain Blackthorne is both.

Here are my observations:The 10 hour mini-series actually did justice to this massive and thoroughly epic James Clavell novel. Extremely difficult to pull off, this movie accurately portrayed feudal Japan in ways other movies have not. Filmed entirely in Japan, the look, feel, and setting are outstanding.The story of course is entirely gripping, as we all identify with the brash, courageous, and profane main character, Pilot John Blackthorne. (Anjin-san, to the Japanese.) This is clearly one of Richard Chamberlain's best roles, as he thoroughly fills the character to the hilt. Rumor has it that Sean Connery was initially selected, but didn't want to do television.Toshiro Mifune was considered Japan's best motion picture actor, and was very effective as the war-lord, Toranaga.In my mind, I never liked the casting of the Lords Yaboo and Buntaro. I always envisioned Yaboo as thin and malicious, while Buntaro was more squat and unmovable. I would have reversed those two in this filming. That is about it.Story is loosely based on an actual Englishman named William Adams, who did indeed become confidante to the Shogun. [...]Well worth watching.

Admittedly it was medieval Japan, but it was in action and custom a Japan I could understand. In fact, at Odawara at the foot of Mount Fujiyama and the Hakone Mountains, I several times saw a remaining grey-stone medieval castle identical to the ones in SHOGUN.For those of you who have never resided in Japan among the everday people, trust in the fact that this movie will bring you very close to the real thing, although several hundred years removed.  The outlawed Samurai era did not completely leave Japan until almost 1900, and though it passed, most of the custom of the Japan I knew was yet controlled by that tradition.  Anywhere one went on the island of Honshu, where SHOGUN has much of its action, Shinto or Buddhist all exhibited its worship of ancestor and military war lord past. Even the 'willow world' in Tokyo yet remained in spirit if not actual locations of Yoshiwara Yukwaku of the Ginza area.If one has any interest in a very good story and a very good movie then one can do no better than view SHOGUN.

224255,A3NVN6RBBBQ0JQ,6300218171,Kevin Pazyck,"[9, 9]","Paramount was generous enough to transfer the classic TV mini-series to DVD. It could be seen as a risk since something this broad and expansive will not hold the attention of all audiences. Even with compression technology of the DVD format the movie still runs through four discs with a supplementary fifth disc. It is certainly a whole lot better than...what, ten VHS cassettes? That is a little trite.First, the story. James Clavell's book Shogun is an all-time classic with many plots with multiple characters, not just the seemingly ""main character"" Major Pilot John Blackthorne. The book covers a lot of ground that the movie epic amazingly does not have the time to reveal. If that does not say something about the complexity of the story, nothing will. The movie basically tries to mostly cover Blackthorne's adventure through the Japans, with additional focus on the machinations of the Jesuit 'enemy'.The transfer to DVD wasn't perfect but the source film is a little dated and grainy but the picture quality definitely passable. No major complaints and I appreciate the effort by Paramount to improve the image. The dialog sound is also not perfect but it does not degrade the experience. I only have one complaint, however tedious. The music is mixed slightly too high as compared to the dialog. The effort to keep turning the volume up and down between music and speaking does compromise the DVD production, but it shouldn't count against the movie.The casting for the movie is spot on for the most part. Chamberlain is believable as Blackthorne, and no one else cast at that time would've come close. The legendary Toshiro Minfune reveled in his role as the calculating Yoshi Toranaga. Damien Thomas is exactly how I imagined Father Alvito looked and acted while reading the novel. Yoko Shimada spoke with class and elegance as Mariko Buntaro. And John Rhys-Davies (yes, Gimli of the Lord of the Rings) gave a rolicking performance as the Spanish Pilot Rodrigues caught up in choice of friendship and duty.So, once again, a giant ""arigato gozaimash'te"" to Paramount for the DVD version to the movie production of one of the most intriguing novels ever.

However, the pilot of the ship, John Blackthorne's (played by Richard Chamberlain), is a very intelligent man, and soon comes to the attention of Daimyo Yoshi Toranaga. Trying hard to learn to understand the totally alien Japanese culture, Blackthorne also must survive in the conflict between the various power players as the country teeters on the brink of civil war. Along the way, though, Blackthorne is surprised to find love with his beautiful translator - Lady Toda Mariko (Yoko Shimada).My son recently purchased the computer game, Total War: Shogun 2, and he kept telling me about all of the various things in the game. I told him that he should watch the old 1980 movie, Shogun, which does a great job of showing feudal Japan, especially as seen through the eyes of a Westerner dropped into it. We watched the movie together, and he enjoyed it as much as I did!Even after all these years, the movie is still visually stunning, with excellent sets, and authentic Japanese actors who bring the Tokugawa Japan to life. I like that there are no Westerners in crappy makeup to take away from the realism that pervades the movie. Instead, the Westerners are Western and the Japanese are Japanese.

Bernabo,"[290, 301]","It has been two decades since James Clavell's novel first aired, but &quot;Shogun&quot; is still one of the finest mini-series yet produced and it still holds up.  The stranger in a strange land story of an English navigator shipwrecked in fuedal Japan strikes such a strong chord because the audience is in the same predicament as the main character, confronted with an unknown and dangerous world that refuses to make sense.  &quot;Shogun&quot; was filmed in Japan with remarkable fidelity to both the original story and local culture.As Pilot-Major John Blackthorne, Chamberlain is often called upon to do more with looks than with dialogue.  As the &quot;King of the Mini-Series,&quot; it is easy to forget what Chamberlain can do as an actor given the proper material (I wish his version of Christopher Fry's &quot;The Lady's Not For Burning&quot; was available on video tape).  Actually, there is a sense in which Chamberlain's performance is arguable the weakest of the cast, but that speaks more to the strength of the supporting players.  Certainly John Rhys-Davies steals every scene he is in as Vasco Rodrigues, Damien Thomas' Father Alvito personifies political machination, and Nobuo Kaneko as Lord Ishido has that glare down perfectly.  Ultimately, it is the Japanese actors who carry &quot;Shogun.&quot;  From the legendary Toshir Mifune as Lord Toranaga, to the novice actress Yko Shimada as Mariko, to Frankie Sakai as Yabu and every one of the characters who make up Blackthorne's Japanese household, these actors provide the new word that confront's Chamberlain's character.  The choice of producer Eric Bercovici to also adopt Clavell's novel was the ideal choice.  Bercovici was not only familiar with the mini-series format, having done &quot;Washington Behind Close Doors,&quot; but he was the writer on &quot;Hell in the Pacific,&quot; a 1968 movie with Lee Marvin and Toshir  Mifune.  During WWII the two men end up on a deserted island.  What made the film unique was that it was done without subtitles; Marvin spoke English and Mifune spoke Japanese and the idea was to show it in both countries without subtitles.  Okay, unfair advantage to the Japanese, but you have to appreciate the idea which &quot;Shogun&quot; certainly uses to great effect.Director Jerry London does an admirable job of presenting Japanese culture on its own terms, which is exactly what is right for the story.  My understanding was that the Orson Welles narration was added at the, uh, request of the network who felt audiences would not be able to read between the lines.  I think that for the most part &quot;Shogun&quot; would work without the excessive explanations, even if you have not read the novel, but we will never know.If you are looking for something to lose yourself in next weekend, you would not find too many things as intelligent and as fascinating as &quot;Shogun.&quot;  Just be sure you do the complete original mini-series and not the one cassette mini-version.",5,An Epic Mini-Series: take a weekend and enjoy it again,970963200,"10 8, 2000",2000,2987,"['been', 'two', 'decades', 'James', 'Clavell', 'novel', 'first', 'aired', 'quot', 'Shogun', 'quot', 'still', 'one', 'finest', 'mini-series', 'yet', 'produced', 'still', 'up', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'story', 'English', 'navigator', 'shipwrecked', 'fuedal', 'Japan', 'strikes', 'such', 'strong', 'chord', 'audience', 'same', 'predicament', 'main', 'character', 'confronted', 'unknown', 'dangerous', 'world', 'make', 'sense', 'quot', 'Shogun', 'quot', 'was', 'filmed', 'Japan', 'remarkable', 'fidelity', 'original', 'story', 'local', 'culture.As', 'Pilot-Major', 'John', 'Blackthorne', 'Chamberlain', 'often', 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'more', 'looks', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'King', 'Mini-Series', 'quot', 'easy', 'forget', 'what', 'Chamberlain', 'can', 'do', 'actor', 'given', 'proper', 'material', 'wish', 'version', 'Christopher', 'Fry', 'quot', 'Lady', 'Not', 'Burning', 'quot', 'was', 'available', 'video', 'tape', 'Actually', 'sense', 'Chamberlain', 'performance', 'arguable', 'weakest', 'cast', 'more', 'strength', 'supporting', 'players', 'Certainly', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'steals', 'scene', 'Vasco', 'Rodrigues', 'Damien', 'Thomas', 'Father', 'Alvito', 'political', 'machination', 'Nobuo', 'Kaneko', 'Lord', 'Ishido', 'glare', 'down', 'perfectly', 'Ultimately', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'who', 'carry', 'quot', 'Shogun.', 'quot', 'legendary', 'Toshir', 'Mifune', 'Lord', 'Toranaga', 'novice', 'actress', 'Yko', 'Shimada', 'Mariko', 'Frankie', 'Sakai', 'Yabu', 'one', 'characters', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'Blackthorne', 'Japanese', 'household', 'actors', 'provide', 'new', 'word', 'confront', 'Chamberlain', 'character', 'choice', 'producer', 'Eric', 'Bercovici', 'also', 'adopt', 'Clavell', 'novel', 'was', 'ideal', 'choice', 'Bercovici', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'familiar', 'mini-series', 'format', 'having', 'done', 'quot', 'Washington', 'Behind', 'Close', 'Doors', 'quot', 'was', 'writer', 'quot', 'Hell', 'Pacific', 'quot', '1968', 'movie', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Toshir', 'Mifune', 'WWII', 'two', 'men', 'end', 'up', 'deserted', 'island', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'unique', 'was', 'was', 'done', 'subtitles', 'Marvin', 'spoke', 'English', 'Mifune', 'spoke', 'Japanese', 'idea', 'was', 'show', 'countries', 'subtitles', 'Okay', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'Japanese', 'have', 'appreciate', 'idea', 'quot', 'Shogun', 'quot', 'certainly', 'great', 'effect.Director', 'Jerry', 'London', 'admirable', 'job', 'presenting', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'own', 'terms', 'exactly', 'what', 'right', 'story', 'understanding', 'was', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'narration', 'was', 'added', 'uh', 'request', 'network', 'who', 'felt', 'audiences', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'read', 'lines', 'think', 'most', 'part', 'quot', 'Shogun', 'quot', 'would', 'work', 'excessive', 'explanations', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'will', 'never', 'know.If', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'lose', 'next', 'weekend', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'intelligent', 'as', 'fascinating', 'quot', 'Shogun.', 'quot', 'Just', 'be', 'sure', 'do', 'complete', 'original', 'mini-series', 'not', 'one', 'cassette', 'mini-version']",N/A

The absolute excellence and quality of the cast performances and the faithfulness to Clavell's novel make this truly one of the best productions I ever saw on the small screen (along with Centennial, Richard Chamberlain's other Tour de force from that era).  This DVD set is worth every penny of the asking price. It has the entire mini-series as originally broadcast, and a whole extra DVD of bonus material, including a 90 minute behind the camera look at the making of the movie. NOTE: Because this was a made-for-TV movie to begin with, the original film was 35mm full-frame format, rather than the more common wide-screen format films like Panavision or Cinemascope. So the DVD is 720x480, 1.5:1 aspect ratio, which will fill a 4:3 monitor or TV set without top/bottom letterboxing, but will NOT fill a wide screen monitor from side to side: If you are watching this on a 16:9 screen, DON'T set it to stretch the image to fit, as this will make even the skinny villagers in Anjiro look like Sumo wrestlers.  Both audio and Video quality are excellent: the producers of this DVD took care to use as clean a print of the film as possible for the transfer. Also, in case you didn't know this, the story presented in this film is loosely based on real people and real historical events in Japan in the 1590's through 1603. Lord Toranaga is based on Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was appointed Shogun in 1603. The battle of Sekigahara, mentioned by the narrator (Orson Welles) at the very end of the film, actually happened, on October 21, 1600. John Blackthorne is based on a real English seaman, William Adams, who became an advisor to the Tokugawa Shogunate.  Also, while this movie is very enjoyable in it's own right, I recommend that you pick up a copy of the novel and read it.

I shouldn't have bothered. This miniseries is badly dated, and doesn't hold up in comparison to actual Japanese movies with similar themes.First, the plot is quite predictable. (Watch out, I'm about to drop some spoilers.) Richard Chamberlain plays John Blackthorne, a European who arrives in Japan under duress. During the early scenes, he's repeatedly threatened and imprisoned by the Japanese, and he's totally alienated because he doesn't understand their language. But, conveniently enough, Blackthorne soon saves the life of a local lord (several times!) and quickly rises in status from begrimed prisoner to samurai boss of a small town.Meanwhile, Blackthorne falls in love with a beautiful Japanese interpreter. Naturally, she returns his feelings. Naturally, she's married to a hateful and abusive jerk, so the audience can root for Blackthorne to whisk her away with a clear conscience. It's all so cliched, and so easy for Blackthorne. At every turn, he rescues or enlightens Japanese characters and gains their favor without seeming to even break a sweat. It's formulaic, rags-to-riches stuff. (And yes, I have heard that this is loosely based on true events. True events, mixed with baloney, I suspect.)Making matters even worse, Shogun feels a bit racist to me. This miniseries is famous for introducing American audiences to Japanese culture, yet in my view, Japan is depicted in an entirely negative light here. The Japanese characters are all subservient, robotic, and ultra-violent. They constantly threaten to kill each other (and indeed follow through on the killing) for the most trivial reasons. In many scenes, Blackthorne - the virtuous Caucasian who is clearly meant to be morally superior to the Japanese - looks down on Japanese culture and complains that it's based purely on violence. Yeah, well, in this movie it's all violence; in reality, it has about seven million additional facets. I can't help but conclude that Shogun was meant to stimulate Western interest in Japan, while simultaneously reassuring Western audiences that theirs is the superior culture.Given that, it's rather ironic and amusing that Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune gives by far the best performance in the whole thing. Despite the fact that Mifune's character is often low-key and has little to do, he totally eclipses the cheesy Richard Chamberlain and the hammy John Rhys-Davies. It's just a shame that, in certain key scenes, Mifune's Japanese dialogue is drowned out by Orson Welles' super-loud English narration. Why render a great actor inaudible? Hadn't the production team ever heard of subtitles? It's one of many lapses in this rather silly, overrated production.",2,Silly plotting and stereotypes ruin a handsome production,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,2817,"[""'m"", 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'original', 'broadcast', 'Shogun', 'checked', 'out', 'DVDs', 'recently', ""'m"", 'interested', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'miniseries', 'badly', 'dated', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'comparison', 'actual', 'Japanese', 'movies', 'similar', 'themes.First', 'plot', 'quite', 'predictable', 'Watch', ""'m"", 'drop', 'spoilers', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'John', 'Blackthorne', 'European', 'who', 'Japan', 'duress', 'early', 'scenes', 'repeatedly', 'threatened', 'imprisoned', 'Japanese', 'totally', 'alienated', ""n't"", 'understand', 'language', 'conveniently', 'enough', 'Blackthorne', 'soon', 'life', 'local', 'lord', 'several', 'times', 'quickly', 'rises', 'status', 'begrimed', 'prisoner', 'samurai', 'boss', 'small', 'town.Meanwhile', 'Blackthorne', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Japanese', 'interpreter', 'Naturally', 'feelings', 'Naturally', 'married', 'hateful', 'abusive', 'jerk', 'audience', 'can', 'root', 'Blackthorne', 'whisk', 'away', 'clear', 'conscience', 'so', 'cliched', 'so', 'easy', 'Blackthorne', 'turn', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'gains', 'favor', 'seeming', 'even', 'break', 'sweat', 'formulaic', 'rags-to-riches', 'stuff', 'yes', 'have', 'heard', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'True', 'events', 'mixed', 'baloney', 'suspect', 'Making', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'Shogun', 'bit', 'racist', 'miniseries', 'famous', 'introducing', 'American', 'audiences', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'yet', 'view', 'Japan', 'depicted', 'entirely', 'negative', 'light', 'here', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'subservient', 'robotic', 'ultra-violent', 'constantly', 'threaten', 'kill', 'other', 'indeed', 'follow', 'killing', 'most', 'trivial', 'reasons', 'many', 'scenes', 'Blackthorne', 'virtuous', 'Caucasian', 'who', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'morally', 'superior', 'Japanese', 'down', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'based', 'purely', 'violence', 'Yeah', 'well', 'movie', 'violence', 'reality', 'about', 'seven', 'million', 'additional', 'facets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'conclude', 'Shogun', 'was', 'meant', 'stimulate', 'Western', 'interest', 'Japan', 'simultaneously', 'reassuring', 'Western', 'audiences', 'superior', 'culture.Given', 'rather', 'ironic', 'amusing', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'far', 'best', 'performance', 'whole', 'thing', 'fact', 'Mifune', 'character', 'often', 'low-key', 'little', 'do', 'totally', 'cheesy', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'hammy', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'just', 'shame', 'certain', 'key', 'scenes', 'Mifune', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'drowned', 'out', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'super-loud', 'English', 'narration', 'Why', 'render', 'great', 'actor', 'inaudible', 'Had', ""n't"", 'production', 'team', 'ever', 'heard', 'subtitles', 'one', 'many', 'lapses', 'rather', 'silly', 'overrated', 'production']",N/A

It has everything going for it that you could possibly ask for: adventure, drama, romance, great characters, outstanding acting, an absorbing plot, all set against the backdrop of an exotic, distant land.Chamberlain plays the stranger in a strange land, and in the clash of the two cultures we see our own similarities and differences thrown into even sharper relief. The great sociologist, Daniel Bell, once said that both Japanese and American culture are unusual in how they can integrate seemingly contradictory elements--in the U.S., for example, religious piety and the pursuit of wealth. And in Japan, after the emperor regained power and outlawed the samurai class in he 1860s, they re-emerged as samurai warriors of business and international commerce, even taking market share from the U.S. in many markets, a much bigger, more powerful, and in many ways more technologically advanced country.As a martial artist and teacher for many years, I was very interested in how the martial arts were portrayed, and they were depicted very well. Clavell was fascinated by feudal era Japanese culture and military history and tactics, and it shows here. In fact, I've seen some of the feats of martial skill in the movie demonstrated by my own teachers.An interesting piece of trivia was that Shogun was the first network TV program which allowed the word ""p_ss"" to be used, and to show a man in the act of urinating.As a miniseries, Shogun was a class act that perhaps has never been surpassed. It's a dramatic and thrilling adventure that holds your interest from beginning to end, and that continues to hold your interest on repeated viewings.",5,A few miscellaneous comments,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,1884,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'add', 'much', 'many', 'great', 'reviews', 'already', 'here', 'thought', 'would', 'just', 'post', 'few', 'miscellaneous', 'observations.Shogun', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'way', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'ever', 'aired', 'many', 'people', 'estimation', 'everything', 'going', 'could', 'possibly', 'ask', 'adventure', 'drama', 'romance', 'great', 'characters', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'absorbing', 'plot', 'set', 'backdrop', 'exotic', 'distant', 'land.Chamberlain', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'clash', 'two', 'cultures', 'see', 'own', 'similarities', 'differences', 'thrown', 'even', 'sharper', 'relief', 'great', 'sociologist', 'Daniel', 'Bell', 'once', 'said', 'Japanese', 'American', 'culture', 'are', 'unusual', 'how', 'can', 'integrate', 'seemingly', 'contradictory', 'elements', 'U.S.', 'example', 'religious', 'piety', 'pursuit', 'wealth', 'Japan', 'emperor', 'regained', 'power', 'outlawed', 'samurai', 'class', '1860s', 're-emerged', 'samurai', 'warriors', 'business', 'international', 'commerce', 'even', 'taking', 'market', 'share', 'U.S.', 'many', 'markets', 'much', 'bigger', 'more', 'powerful', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'country.As', 'martial', 'artist', 'teacher', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'how', 'martial', 'arts', 'were', 'portrayed', 'were', 'depicted', 'very', 'well', 'Clavell', 'was', 'fascinated', 'feudal', 'era', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'military', 'history', 'tactics', 'here', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'feats', 'martial', 'skill', 'movie', 'demonstrated', 'own', 'teachers.An', 'interesting', 'piece', 'trivia', 'was', 'Shogun', 'was', 'first', 'network', 'TV', 'program', 'allowed', 'word', 'p_ss', 'be', 'used', 'show', 'man', 'act', 'urinating.As', 'miniseries', 'Shogun', 'was', 'class', 'act', 'perhaps', 'never', 'been', 'surpassed', 'dramatic', 'thrilling', 'adventure', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'hold', 'interest', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

Yes, a booklet with information and chapter listings would have been nice, but that's probably not going to be a dealbreaker for many people.I'd like to know what some of the other reviewers think was deleted in this edition.  I was very familiar with the miniseries, having seen it several times and having taped it at the time on an old Betamax, and I didn't notice anything missing in the DVD edition...except that accidental helicopter shadow!  Nothing that I expected to see was gone.  As an earlier customer pointed out, the original show ran for 12 hours on NBC because of all the commercials, network promos, opening titles and closing credits in every segment, etc.  Take out all that padding, and 9 hours of actual program content sounds about right.  If anybody can identify any actual deletions, I'd be interested in hearing what they are.I would have liked to have seen the brief nude scenes of Mariko in the bath included as much as the next guy.  But they were only in the European version anyway.  (Americans are considered by the world to be backward children in these matters.)  They were never in the American version, so although they would have been a welcome bonus, we can't say they were &quot;deleted.&quot;It was a real pleasure to start playing Shogun when the DVD package arrived, and Amazon.com had the best price for it that I could find, so that was an added benefit.

When you go down the line of people who gave this great title three or lower stars, you'll find it mostly comes from people who try to express their ""true"" historical knowledge, or simply didn't have the attention span for a drama of this caliber. Who cares?I was 8 years old when Shogun came to television for the first time and my mother, a single-parent who never had much time for TV, sat enthralled and entranced by it. It was probably the way I looked watching Battlestar Galactica, or Saturday morning cartoons, and during whole time Shogun was airing my mother could not be bothered to pull herself away from this wonderful drama.When I was a teen it aired again and I couldn't pull myself away, and it inspired my own interest in Japan and its culture. I submit to whoever is reading this the so-called history buffs, or historians who are giving this mini-series, or the book it was based on, low marks, it's only to flex their own scholastic muscle. It's pathetic posturing, really and has nothing to do with the true quality of the story.Shogun continues to be one of the greatest stories ever told, and among the best adaptations of a novel ever done, right up there with ""Lonesome Dove"", and ""Gone with the Wind"". The charm of Richard Chamberlain's portrayal of Blackthorne (I don't need to know who the character was based on), the beauty and grace of Yko Shimada's portrayal of Mariko and the rest of the wonderful cast, combine to bring us a tale for the ages of Feaudal politics and forbidden romance.I loved it.",5,If you have A.D.D. you'll hate it.,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,1636,"['Reading', 'reviews', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'movie', 'mini-series', 'be', 'entertained', 'When', 'go', 'down', 'line', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'great', 'title', 'three', 'lower', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'find', 'mostly', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'express', 'true', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'drama', 'caliber', 'Who', 'was', '8', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Shogun', 'came', 'television', 'first', 'time', 'mother', 'single-parent', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'time', 'TV', 'sat', 'enthralled', 'entranced', 'was', 'probably', 'way', 'looked', 'watching', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'whole', 'time', 'Shogun', 'was', 'airing', 'mother', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'pull', 'away', 'wonderful', 'drama.When', 'was', 'teen', 'aired', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'away', 'inspired', 'own', 'interest', 'Japan', 'culture', 'submit', 'whoever', 'reading', 'so-called', 'history', 'buffs', 'historians', 'who', 'are', 'giving', 'mini-series', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'low', 'marks', 'only', 'flex', 'own', 'scholastic', 'muscle', 'pathetic', 'posturing', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'true', 'quality', 'story.Shogun', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'stories', 'ever', 'told', 'best', 'adaptations', 'novel', 'ever', 'done', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'charm', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'portrayal', 'Blackthorne', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'who', 'character', 'was', 'based', 'beauty', 'grace', 'Yko', 'Shimada', 'portrayal', 'Mariko', 'rest', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'combine', 'bring', 'tale', 'ages', 'Feaudal', 'politics', 'forbidden', 'romance.I', 'loved']",N/A

First puzzled, then absorbed, waiting each week for the next step. I enjoyed this very faithful to the original book (as I had later opportunity to verify) mini series.Mr. Clavell (author of the book and one of the executive producers) constructs a master piece reflecting how two so different symbolic universes interact and react to each other. European vision and values embodied by Pilot-Major Blackthorne, Japanese ones by Toranaga-sama and Mariko-san. Characters are based on real-life people: Pilot-Major William Adams and Tokugawa Ieyasu.Situated in the late 16th century Japan, at the critical transition from a feudal state to a centralized administration (the Shogunate) that will last until 19th century, the story depicts the struggle of Toranaga to be designed Shogun..Blackthorne, step by step, discovers the values of Samurai code, learn Japanese, understand the complex psychology of the people surrounding him and fall in love with a noble woman. Finally he is converted in a true Samurai with a high rank in Toranaga's entourage.The story also reflects the deep conflicts aroused between different European groups, struggling to obtain exclusive access to this huge market. Portuguese, Spaniards, Dutch and English are opposed not only by commercial rivalry but also by religious drives.The mini series has a big budget support, reflected in the care put to recreate ambiance, wardrobe, weaponry and amazing interiors and gardens.Japanese actors and actress greatly contribute to render verisimilar the whole play.As for the characterizations: Richard Chamberlain, as Pilot-Major Blackthorne, gives a very sober and realistic composition; Toshiro Mifune, as Toranaga-sama is outstanding; Yoko Shimada, as Mariko-san is delicate and beautiful. Supporting cast is also very good and we may point out Frankie Sakai (Yabu), Damien Thomas (Father Alvito), John Rhys-Davies (Rodrigues) and Yuki Meguro (Omi) as over par.It also may be noted that ""Shogun"" has been nominated and won some Emmy Awards.Enjoy this mini series!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,The Conversion of Pilot-Major Blackthorne.,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,2162,"['Shogun', '1980', 'TV', 'series', 'came', 'major', 'surprise', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'TV', 'products', 'First', 'puzzled', 'then', 'absorbed', 'waiting', 'week', 'next', 'step', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', 'book', 'had', 'later', 'opportunity', 'verify', 'mini', 'series.Mr', 'Clavell', 'author', 'book', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'master', 'piece', 'reflecting', 'how', 'two', 'so', 'different', 'symbolic', 'universes', 'interact', 'react', 'other', 'European', 'vision', 'values', 'embodied', 'Pilot-Major', 'Blackthorne', 'Japanese', 'ones', 'Toranaga-sama', 'Mariko-san', 'Characters', 'are', 'based', 'real-life', 'people', 'Pilot-Major', 'William', 'Adams', 'Tokugawa', 'Ieyasu.Situated', 'late', '16th', 'century', 'Japan', 'critical', 'transition', 'feudal', 'state', 'centralized', 'administration', 'Shogunate', 'will', 'last', '19th', 'century', 'story', 'struggle', 'Toranaga', 'be', 'designed', 'Shogun..Blackthorne', 'step', 'step', 'values', 'Samurai', 'code', 'learn', 'Japanese', 'understand', 'complex', 'psychology', 'people', 'surrounding', 'fall', 'love', 'noble', 'woman', 'Finally', 'converted', 'true', 'Samurai', 'high', 'rank', 'Toranaga', 'entourage.The', 'story', 'also', 'deep', 'conflicts', 'aroused', 'different', 'European', 'groups', 'struggling', 'obtain', 'exclusive', 'access', 'huge', 'market', 'Portuguese', 'Spaniards', 'Dutch', 'English', 'are', 'opposed', 'not', 'only', 'commercial', 'rivalry', 'also', 'religious', 'drives.The', 'mini', 'series', 'big', 'budget', 'support', 'reflected', 'care', 'put', 'recreate', 'ambiance', 'wardrobe', 'weaponry', 'amazing', 'interiors', 'gardens.Japanese', 'actors', 'actress', 'greatly', 'render', 'whole', 'play.As', 'characterizations', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Pilot-Major', 'Blackthorne', 'very', 'sober', 'realistic', 'composition', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'Toranaga-sama', 'outstanding', 'Yoko', 'Shimada', 'Mariko-san', 'delicate', 'beautiful', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'may', 'point', 'out', 'Frankie', 'Sakai', 'Yabu', 'Damien', 'Thomas', 'Father', 'Alvito', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Rodrigues', 'Yuki', 'Meguro', 'Omi', 'par.It', 'also', 'may', 'be', 'noted', 'Shogun', 'been', 'nominated', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Awards.Enjoy', 'mini', 'series', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

What a joy to now see it, crystal-clear picture with crystal-clear sound! The DVD version (full production) is superb, it's like seeing it for the very first time. To be remembered: SHOGUN is NOT an entirely accurate historical event, IT IS A STORY. It should be viewed from that perspective: a story.

Blackthorne soon finds himself in the middle of a war between two samurai warlords struggling for dominion of the island kingdom.  Although initially suspicious of him, Blackthorne is soon appreciated by Toranaga (Toshiro Mifune) who takes him as a confidant to help him against his rival, Ishido: having much use for a man who knows a lot about war ships, fire arms, and many other things Japan might otherwise need from the West.  Although initially overwhelmed by culture shock, Blackthorne soon becomes as Japanes as can be with the help of his patron and the beautiful Lady Mariko (Yoko Shimada.)  Despite his rapid learning and loyalty to the new Shogun, Blackthorne is still a foreigner who is unaccustomed to the subtle and rigid customs of of his host country; he also realizes that this island will forever be his prison.This is an excellent mini-series with a good screenplay, great direction, a lavish production, and a great cast.

Although somewhat slow paced in parts, sometimes accompanied by hammy acting from the Western folks involved, probably underscored by the remarkably good Japanese acting, relives the traditions of the Japans in the 1600s, and is the main reason why you probably want to see it. Although the story is rather limited for the running time - English pilot marooned on the Japans, falls in love with a local Japanese woman and stirs up the hornets nest - it is not really the tale or Richard Chamberlain's Pilot-Major John Blackthorne / Anjin-san character who drives the show, but the whole Japanese culture on display and this is first rate stuff. Throwing in a few ninjas also heightens its validity as one of the best historical dramas aired on television. However it does show its age because of the impact of modern Asian cinema and better subtitle translation standards, speaking of which, Shogun completely avoids, with long dialogue sequences in Japanese without any English subtitles, to present the audience with a more vivid Japanese presence.

The color is vivid and the picture quality is excellent. The sound has been re-mixed into an impressive stereo surround, although the original mono track (this was broadcast before the days of stereo TV) is available for you armchair purists.Shogun was so popular that a special 30-minute summary version was shown a few days after it ended for viewers who had to miss the final episode to observe a Jewish holiday. Despite its success, someone at NBC decided that parts of the story needed to be clearer, so narration was added. The bad news is that this is not the original version from 1980, but that somewhat re-worked Shogun that aired a few years later.

Eventually he finds himself in the middle of what seems to be a geo-political conflict, secrecy and war, as he trys to just stay sane and stay alive and cope with this ancient yet alltogether new world.This is just as good as any film made for the theater, but very epic in length.

'Japan is rare and unique,' said James Clavell creator of John Blackthorne, 'Anjin' in Japanese, which means 'pilot.'Blackthorne (Richard Chamberlain) portrays an Englishman, pilot major of a Dutch fleet, who is shipwrecked on the turbulent waters off the 'Land of the Gods.' England's enemies (aristocratic warlords, British colonial, Portuguese traders, Jesuit missionaries) now await him...He is caught with his crew by Japanese warriors, and forced to listen as to understand the Japanese language and treatment... The audience - like him - struggles to catch what is going on, as no subtitles in the film...Blackthorne is surrounded by hundreds of warriors all dressed up with Japanese multicolored wardrobes fastened firmly by an obi (a long wide sash that holds the two swords). We are in presence of samurai, where 'physical courage and prowess are at a premium.'The English navigator starts a new life far from home, a new transformation of way of living, thinking and acting, from an uncivilized primitive prisoner to a man of strength, honor and courage...In this epic exposition we see:- Violent scenes of feudal Japan: Omi (Yuki Meguro) in his first meeting with Blackthorne beheads a man for not bowing in respect to him... Pieterzoon (Edward Peel), a man of Blackthorne's crew, is brought from a pit to be cook alive in a large deep pot... A companion Croocq (Steward MacKenzie) is pulled up from boiling liquid...- Intricate and complicated political plots: When Ferriera (Vladek Sheybal), a Portuguese trader, in the presence of Father dell'aqua (Alan Badel) gives Toranaga (Toshiro Mifune) and Mariko (Yoko Shimada) protection on the Black ship in return for the Englishman... When Rodrigues (John Rhys-Davies) has been overboarded... When the Ninja warriors attack Osaka Castle...- Dramatic scenes: Blackthorne's intend to commit seppuku... Mariko's seppuku frightening scene... When a disgraced warrior Yabu (Frankie Sakai) commits instant seppuku (hara-kiri).- Amusing moments: Blackthorne in his first Japanese bath in Anjiro... When he teach Toranaga the lively steps of the hornpipe... When he begins his 'mad dance' moving up and down in order to permit Toranaga escape from Osaka Castle...- Cultural exposition of the traditional Japanese woman: Her moods and feelings, her emotions, her reactions... Mariko badly beaten by her husband... Mariko treatments so affectionate, sweet and loving... Mariko's bath scene... Her risky love affair...- Best moment of the whole mini series: Blackthorne becomes a samurai!Filmed in epic proportions, with breathtaking cinematography, super acting, and great special effects (few arrow-in-the-chest scenes; the burning of 'The Erasmus;' the earthquake), this full-length version of ""Shogun"" is fair to James Clavell's colorful best-seller...The Jesuits (Friar Domingo, Father Sebastio, Father dell'Aqua, Father Alvito) are interpreters, writers of the first Japanese dictionary, who all share the commerce of silk between Japan and China...Richard Chamberlain appears fervently with noble ambition, firm and dominate as the Westerner who is taken by force as a prisoner, who hates his captors, but little by little is seduced by their culture...Toshiro Mifune performs with great dignity a powerful legendary figure who unifies several political factions into one nation under his authority as Japan's first Shogun!John Rhys-Davies plays Rodrigues, the Portuguese pilot, with a big sense of humor...Yoko Shimada (Mariko) is the 'perfect vision.' a woman of great beauty and rarity, delicate and fragile, a true precious jewel of the Orient!",4,Wonderful exposure

224308,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6300218171,Roger J. Buffington,"[1, 1]","&quot;Shogun&quot; is, in my opinion, the greatest miniseries ever made.  It is a very faithful adaptation of James Clavell's bestselling novel, and a great story it is.  This is the story of Pilot-Major Blackthorne of the ship &quot;Erasmus,&quot; which is the first English ship to navigate to the orient.  Shipwrecked in Japan circa 1600, Blackthorne must adapt to the Japanese culture or die.  This is a wonderful story of an extraordinary man who is thrust into a highly civilized but very alien culture--a culture wracked by intrigue, politics, powerful Jesuit priests, and imminent civil war.  The friendship between Blackthorne and Lord Toranaga is very satisfying, and the story of his love for the Lady Toda is touching.First and foremost, this is the story of a clash of cultures.  Blackthorne initially considers himself more civilized than his Japanese hosts, but by the end of the story he comes to appreciate the culture's emphasis on politeness, cleanliness, and honor.  He ultimately is assimilated and becomes an intimate advisor to Lord Toranaga and a samurai in his own right.Other reviews have pointed out various historical inaccuracies to the story, and I will only say that such inaccuracies do nothing to detract from what is ultimately a fine story.  This miniseries is remarkably free from overlong tedious &quot;filler&quot; scenes, and instead for the most part moves along smartly, holds the viewer's interest, and is highly entertaining.  The DVD is of very high quality both audio and video, and constitutes a very good value.  I had not seen Shogun for many years, and if there are any missing scenes on this DVD I don't remember them.  This appears to be a fairly complete reproduction of the miniseries.  I have read Mr. Clavell's novel several times, and this miniseries does a fine job adapting it to the miniseries format, and is quite faithful to the story, taking no liberties with it.&quot;Shogun&quot; is a story that will hold the interest of most viewers.

Once I start watching it I can't stop. ""The Making of Shogun"" included as an extra on disk five is great.I do have one major gripe about the packaging.  One reason I love DVD's are the chapters which allow me to quickly find a scene in a movie I really enjoy. While the five DVD's in this set have chapters when inserted into a DVD player, there is no guide on the packaging or in the five DVD set which lists all the chapters in the series. As a result I am forced to put each disk in my DVD player and look at the chapters on my TV screen to see if a particular scene is on the disk.There are a number of scenes in Shogun I want to watch over and over. I loved when Blackthorne was imprisoned and learns about Japan from the Franciscan priest or the time when Blackthorne saved Toranaga from the earthquake or when he became a samurai. I loved some of the scenes with Mariko. I loved when Rodrigues tried to kill Blackthorne during the typhoon and when Rodrigues visits Blackthorne with the intent to kill him. Since four of the DVD's cover the series (with the fifth being devoted to some nice extras) it is hard to guess which DVD has a scene I want to watch.It would have cost so little to include a piece of paper with a chapter index for the entire collection.

The picture quality is incredible (compare it to the 2 hour movie edit, which looks dark and grainy - the DVD looks like it was filmed in the last couple of years!), and the sound is great too.I must say that after finding out there's a 12 hour version of this, I was a little disappointed.  The 9 hours was engaging, but I was left wanting so much more.  Now I know why! :) Surely Paramount could have fit another three hours onto the 4 discs?  Also, why did they take out the nudity?  The movie edit has it, and it's not like this version on DVD was going to be broadcast on television.  The movie edit version also has a different scene on the docks, when a blinded Blackthorne is being escorted to his ship past the Black Ship and her crew.  In the mini-series version, Father Dell'Aqua along with a group of Christian samurai are confronted by Ferreria, the Black Ship captain, and his crew, who intend to burn Blackthorne on a stake.  In the movie version, there is no Ferreria character, nor is there a Father Dell'Aqua, so the dock scene that version was an alternate take!  Blackthorne is instead escorted to the docks area by his brown samurai where he stops to have an amicable conversation with Rodriguez who is now the Black Ship captain rather than just the pilot.  They must have planned the movie edit from day one for this alternate scene to even exist.  It's too bad they didn't include this as part of a deleted scenes feature.Overall, the set is amazing.  The making of featurette is very interesting, although the featurettes about the history of Japan and aspects of its culture are somewhat dull.

This series follows John Blackthorne who is an Elizabethan ship pilot who gets marooned in Japan and who gets embroiled in a war between samurai lords. He is made samurai and vassal to a Japanese lord and needs to learn about life in Japan quickly as his very life depends on it. There is all of this to the story and SO much more. This boxset has five discs with the series in four parts across four discs and the last disc having all the extras. There is also an excellent booklet with a history of the book and production of the series. This series has the most amazing costumes and film sets and over 3 million of the 23 million budget was spent on these aspects alone. This is very faithful to the book, with nothing added and only a very few minor points omitted. The story isn't compromised in the slightest and if you have enjoyed the book it feels wonderful to immerse yourself back into this world once again. Richard Chamberlain is simply excellent as Blackthorne and Yoko Shimada is also superb as Mariko. The extras include a 13 segment documentary of the making of Shogun, Historical featurettes on Samurai, Tea Ceremony and Geisha, as well as audio commentary on various scenes. This series has all the aspects of the book that I adored so much, samurai honour, romance, a glimpse of feudal Japanese life, betrayal and intrigue, an epic adventure and so much more. You will follow Blackthorne as he develops from a wary and scared foreigner until he reaches the heights of samurai and confidant to his Lord Toranaga. This is a stunning series and gives full justice to the book, the style and effects may be dated now but the story is as gripping as it ever was and I feel it still holds it own against TV productions of today.

224317,A23Q1T4MXZHFM7,6300218171,susumu-5,"[4, 4]","What is Japanese? Hundreds of dramas have been made so far to find out about it. I happened to be one of them and I am keenly interested in how American and European drama portray Japan and Japanese. In most of the cases Japanese in American films or dramas are something to be laughed at even by Japanese themselves. But SHOGUN, aired in 1980, one of the most successful Samurai dramas produced by non-Japanese staffs, predatingThe Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition)more than two dacades, is something different. It is done with sincere attitude to understand our culture. So this drama is in a way Kurosawa meets David Lean(The Bridge Over River Kwai).Overall this drama is set in last segment of Sengoku days during late 16th to early 17th century, but the author made the drama so it can be applicable to present-day situation. Better understanding of each culture is the key to mitigate the tension between U.S and Japan. In this drama you are thrown into the foreign land you know little about. As Blackthorne's understanding of the Japanese culture and language improve so could that of the viewers to find out what is really going on.Locations for the drama were entirely in Japan. You can even find some of the popular castles in Japan. Himeji Castle was used as Osaka Castle where Lord Ishido(Mitsunari Ishida) and Lady Ochiba(Lady Yodo) resided. Hikone Castle was used as Lord Toranaga(Iyeyasu Tokugawa)'s castle near Osaka Castle. (Historically Fushimi Castle). Matsumoto Castle was used as a local castle somewhere in Shinano(Currently Nagano Prefecture). Kumamoto Castle was used as Yedo Castle.NBC picked Clavell's work to get dramatized because SHOGUN is a Samurai drama American people love through Kurosawa films.To meet the challenge of creating a samurai drama, Production team allied with TOHO STUDIOS, which produced early Kurosawa works and has expertise in special effects as shown in Godzilla series. Toho staffs even corrected some of the factual errors the original scripts had. (But Japanese staffs might have been amazed how accurate James Clavell's understanding of Japanese people, culture and their mindset.)The genius in special effect was shown in Earthquake scene which took part in Anjiro in Izu Peninsula. Actually the magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit Izu in 1974 one year before the novel finished. They truly did a great work to make the novel spectacle scene in live-action.Actors are splendid as well. Toshiro Mifune as Lord Toranaga(Iyeyasu)does not seem fit as the image of Iyeyasu at first but as the drama goes on it is becoming fit as a fiddle particularly how he acted in the event of finding Blackthorne's ship Erasmus got burned at the last part of the drama. Frankie Sakai best known by the role in Sekai Daisendo,or the Last War as Lord Yabu made a great performance particularly the way he becomes a traitor and the way he commits seppuku(harakiri). Richard Chambalain as Blackthorne(William Adams) is comical and cute particularly when he speaks simple Japanese. He looks as if he were one of the English teachers living in Japan who enjoys the company of Japanese girls. Damien Thomas as Father Alvito and John Rhys-Davis as Rodrigues are stunning as well. They see Blackthorne as threat at first but they finally serve to save Blackthorne's life.Jesuit Christians vs Blackthorne is quite amusing because it is rare in Japanese Samurai dramas that their hostile attitude to each other is aptly described.Outside Japan they are enemies but in Japan they must get along with each other or they can not survive in Samurai's land. Such was the situation during second world war. Alliance finally prevailed. Clavell seems to imply from his bitter experience his idea that the Gaijins in Japan should cooperate each other irrespective of their cultural differences through this drama.Mariko as Yoko Shimada actually was the producer's second choice because the top candidate couldn't fit the shooting schedule. But she took the role partly because she performed the role of Lady Gracia, the character model of Mariko in NHK drama in 1978. Nagging problem was how to conquer the dilemma of her being both Christian and being the member of Samurai family.In Christianity committing suicide is regarded as sin. In this drama it showed Mariko's intent of suicide and then she didn't become a ""sinner"".Verdict: Excellent Samurai Drama produced in the U.S.Rating: 97 out of 100Recommended for: Samurai drama fans, fans of Japanese culture.

There is some entertainment value in seeing feudal Japan brought to life in an American miniseries, but as with a dog walking on its hind legs, it's impressive not because it is done well, but because it is done at all.Throughout Shogun, the limited budget of a TV production is evident.  An opening scene with a ship weathering a storm includes shots of an obvious set with ""rain"" being splashed on it.  Later on, an ""earthquake"" is created by shaking the camera and having a few dusty trenches cave in.But Shogun's worst, most unforgivable sin is its ending.  Without giving away spoliers, I can say that this entire mammoth miniseries builds to a climactic battle between two samurai armies, and then when that point is reached, the battle is NOT EVEN SHOWN.  Instead, we get Orson Welles narrating that the battle was really exciting, take his word for it.  Thanks, Orson, but I wanted to see the clashing armies, not just hear you tell me it happened.  Similarly, an attack by Blackthorne's ship on the Jesuit's ""Black Ship"" is constantly talked about and forshadowed... but never happens.  Moreover, the ending fails to provide any sort of meaningful resolution for the main character, Blackthorne, who is left thinking he'll succeed in a plan that we learn is doomed to failure.We learn that because Orson Welles doesn't just narrate, he also speaks the Japanese characters' thoughts and repeats their dialogue in English.  Instead of subtitles, sometimes you'll hear two Japanese actors talking to each other, and then their voices fade down and Orson starts telling you what they're saying to each other.  A jarring effect, and unnecessary -- subtitles would have been better.  But even if subtitles had been used, the viewer, after investing hours of his time in this story, would still be left feeling cheated by its failure to have any kind of dramatic payoff.Another flaw is the poor Japanese spoken by some of the Western actors.  While Richard Chamberlain's Blackthorne is supposed to be learning the language, others like John Rhys-Davies' Rodrigues should speak it better than they do.  It is so bad that it becomes distracting and had me laughing at the screen,Shogun is frustrating because the potential for a more interesting story was there.  But after setting up a complex scenario with Jesuits, Toranaga, Ishido, and Blackthorne and his crew all competing for advantage, Shogun spectactuarly fails to deliver.Shogun is at least packaged well as a DVD set.  The first four discs contain the main feature, and fifth disc includes a fairly interesting ""making of"" documentary.

Those looking for an action-packed samurai epic may want to stick with the way-too-Hollywood ""The Last Samurai"".  This is a thinking man's epic; character driven, full of political intrigue (though not nearly as much as the book), and filled with rich details that really transport you to that period in time. As great as it is to see such an excellent book done such justice, the film is flawed. Richard Chamberlain gives an often Charleton Heston-esque performance (not really a bad thing) but delivers some unintentionally hilarious lines (to his ship caught in a storm and about to crash into a reef: ""Turn you whore from hell, TUUUUURRRRN!"").  Rather than have subtitles for the few scenes where Japanese characters meet and speak amongst each others, we have annoying voice-overs (delivered by Orson Welles, no less) describing the conversation.  Cheesy.  Also, much of the political aspect of the story was simply cut out to make room for more Blackthorne and Mariko. Lastly, for a story about samurai that was already starving for action to actually have several battle scenes shortened or entirely cut out was unforgiveable. Yabu's duel with Blackthorne's retainer and the battle at Ishido's castle as Mariko tries to leave would have been awesome to see, but are simply skipped.  Don't worry though, the ninja attack is entirely intact and the highlight of the mini-series. Most of the action we do get to see is very brief and without any excitement or flair; this is where a little Hollywood touch might have helped.  Thankfully, the action is far from the main reason to watch.  This is a STORY.  It's got romance, drama, comedy,and much more.  John Rhys-Davies (that's Gimli for you LOTR fans) steals every scene he's in as Blackthorne's friend/rival pilot Rodriguez and Toshiro Mifune is absolutely flawless as Toranaga. The disc of extras is a happy bonus.  It's full of interesting observations from cast and crew and offers a lot of insight into the making of the film and the impact it had when it originally aired.  I prefer the book and with this mini-series clocking in at 8+ hours, it might take you less time to read the book. But know that this DVD collection does it justice and that is a rare thing these days.

There were just a few things that they could have done to really make this great.  First off was the transfer to DVD wasn't digital so in some shots there's a bit of a grainy quality.  Which is a little distracting when there truely are so many great shots.The only other complaints I have is about the original filming.  I don't understand why a film made for American TV has so much Japanese spoken without sub-titles.  I mean that when there wasn't one of the characters acting as an interpreter there was often a great deal of dialog spoken with no understanding of what was said.  Granted we eventually get the ghist of what was said, but personally I like to know what's being said if it was in the script.  It would have helped those of us who didn't read the book to get a better understanding of what all was going on.  On the DVD I thought that maybe they would have them included if you select English sub-titles, but there's nothing written when they speak Japanese.The only other problem was again with the original movie as a mini-series.  Even though most of the movie is a good strong story that really moves along there are some segments that slow things down so much that I'm thinking they were left in to fill the amount of time alloted.None the less this is a good DVD set, but I'd check to see if they release another addition in digital.",4,"Good, But Could Have Been Better",1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1442,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'agree', 'good', 'reviews', 'given', 'mini', 'series', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'really', 'make', 'great', 'First', 'off', 'was', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'digital', 'so', 'shots', 'bit', 'grainy', 'quality', 'Which', 'little', 'distracting', 'when', 'truely', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'shots.The', 'only', 'other', 'complaints', 'have', 'original', 'filming', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'made', 'American', 'TV', 'so', 'much', 'Japanese', 'spoken', 'sub-titles', 'mean', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'characters', 'acting', 'interpreter', 'was', 'often', 'great', 'deal', 'dialog', 'spoken', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'Granted', 'eventually', 'get', 'ghist', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'personally', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'DVD', 'thought', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'select', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'nothing', 'written', 'when', 'speak', 'Japanese.The', 'only', 'other', 'problem', 'was', 'again', 'original', 'movie', 'mini-series', 'Even', 'most', 'movie', 'good', 'strong', 'story', 'really', 'are', 'segments', 'slow', 'things', 'down', 'so', 'much', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'were', 'left', 'fill', 'amount', 'time', 'less', 'good', 'DVD', 'set', ""'d"", 'check', 'see', 'release', 'addition', 'digital']",N/A

The constant suicides everywhere might seem overdone or even silly, but are actually quite in keeping with the times depicted. Visit one of the actual castles in japan and you will find a rediculous selfslaughterfest among some of its regal inhabitants (if a lord kills himself a good dozen woman around him do the same and there are many ""goodbye"" poems on display, ah there is so much our culture could learn...).

The only complaint I have is the portrayal of the Japanese characters. With the exception of the translator Mariko, none of the Japanese characters ever speak for themselves. The film has instances of untranslated Japanese (irritating) and whenever something vital happens, the English narrator tells us what has taken place. This, I think, cheapens the Japanese players, reducing to them to secondary characters. In the book, they are as vital to the story as Blackthorne and the other ""barbarians"" and this doesn't come out as much in the film.

In the intervening decades I read the book about 5 times.I rate these DVD 5 stars because you will have a very hard time finding a better entertainment value for your money.  This show was fantastic.  The storyline (which I will not repeat) is complex and fascinating, and the miniseries does it justice.  The acting is superb - my personal opinion is that Yoko Shimada makes the series.  Markio is an extraordinarily complex character, and Ms. Shimada's portrayal captures her wonderfully.  Plus Yoko is unbelievably beautiful.  You can't go wrong looking at her for 9 hours.  But that is not to take away from Blackthorne, or Alvito, or Yabu, and of course Tishiro Mifune as Toranaga.  Stellar performances all.The miniseries faithfully reproduces the main substory, the rise of the Englishman to Samurai.  Much of the other substories, the interactions of the Japanese characters mainly, are not fleshed out.  This is not a criticism, since the resources were limited and the language barrier formidable.  Lastly, the score by Maurice Jarre completes the miniseries.  The score, as much as the acting, storyline, and scenery, helps make the series a masterpiece.I do have criticism about the DVDs.  One is, of course, the deleted scenes.  Since it&#65533;s been 23 years I don't remember everything about the series, and I sometimes think I remember scenes that were only in the book.  However, with 5 DVDs no scenes should have been left out.  Especially the nudity.  If I could watch those scenes on NBC when I was ... young, I should be able to see them now.  I do question the claim that 3 hours were cut.  The 12 hour miniseries included commercials, and the opening and closing credits for each episode.Next is the over-narration by Orson Wells.  Nothing against the venerable Mr. Wells, but the voiceover noticeably detracts from some scenes.  Sometimes the point is to be as confused as Blackthorn, but other times there is plot movement that the book clearly wants the reader to understand.  Many times the interactions are later summarized in English.  Regardless, while 23 years ago subtitles may have been taboo, they certainly aren't now.  In this respect Paramount should have updated the series with subtitles.Finally, while the packaging is adequate, a booklet would have been a great touch, including pictures, chapter titles, etc.So some minor criticisms, but again, this is fantastic entertainment and a great investment.",5,"Great Entertainment,",1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,2634,"['When', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'saw', 'Shogun', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'release', 'DVDs', 'did', 'see', '2.5', 'hour', 'version', 'will', 'never', 'speak', 'THAT', 'again', 'intervening', 'decades', 'read', 'book', '5', 'times.I', 'rate', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'will', 'have', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'better', 'entertainment', 'value', 'money', 'show', 'was', 'fantastic', 'storyline', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'miniseries', 'justice', 'acting', 'superb', 'personal', 'opinion', 'Yoko', 'Shimada', 'series', 'Markio', 'extraordinarily', 'complex', 'character', 'Ms.', 'Shimada', 'portrayal', 'wonderfully', 'Yoko', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'looking', '9', 'hours', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'Blackthorne', 'Alvito', 'Yabu', 'course', 'Tishiro', 'Mifune', 'Toranaga', 'Stellar', 'performances', 'all.The', 'miniseries', 'faithfully', 'main', 'substory', 'rise', 'Englishman', 'Samurai', 'Much', 'other', 'substories', 'interactions', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'mainly', 'are', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'not', 'criticism', 'resources', 'were', 'limited', 'language', 'barrier', 'formidable', 'Lastly', 'score', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'miniseries', 'score', 'as', 'much', 'acting', 'storyline', 'scenery', 'make', 'series', 'masterpiece.I', 'do', 'have', 'criticism', 'DVDs', 'One', 'course', 'deleted', 'scenes', '65533', 's', 'been', '23', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'everything', 'series', 'sometimes', 'think', 'remember', 'scenes', 'were', 'only', 'book', 'However', '5', 'DVDs', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'Especially', 'nudity', 'could', 'watch', 'scenes', 'NBC', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'now', 'do', 'question', 'claim', '3', 'hours', 'were', 'cut', '12', 'hour', 'miniseries', 'included', 'commercials', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'episode.Next', 'over-narration', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'Nothing', 'venerable', 'Mr.', 'Wells', 'voiceover', 'noticeably', 'scenes', 'Sometimes', 'point', 'be', 'as', 'confused', 'Blackthorn', 'other', 'times', 'plot', 'movement', 'book', 'clearly', 'reader', 'understand', 'Many', 'times', 'interactions', 'are', 'later', 'summarized', 'English', 'Regardless', '23', 'years', 'subtitles', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'taboo', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'now', 'respect', 'Paramount', 'should', 'have', 'updated', 'series', 'subtitles.Finally', 'packaging', 'adequate', 'booklet', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'touch', 'including', 'pictures', 'chapter', 'titles', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'again', 'fantastic', 'entertainment', 'great', 'investment']",N/A
