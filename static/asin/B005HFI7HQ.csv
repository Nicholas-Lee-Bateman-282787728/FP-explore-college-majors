1460961,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005HFI7HQ,Andrew Ellington,"[15, 16]","A few months back (well, it's been a while now), our local Independent Theater was playing a special showing of `A Better Life' and so my wife and I snuck away from the kids to indulge in one of our favorite pastimes; movies.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I had read good ink on Demian Bichir's performance and so I was excited to see what all the hype was about.Wow; he was outstanding.The film centers around an illegal immigrant named Carlos, working as a gardener in LA.  He came to America with his wife and young son hoping to make a better life for them.  Years later, he is raising his now teenage son alone, and his life really isn't that much better.  He works hard, day in and day out, but he isn't making much headway.  When a business opportunity presents itself, Carlos is hesitant to embrace it, but with a push from his sister he takes the leap, hoping that the payoff will be grand.  In the meantime, his son is being persuaded by schoolmates to join a gang, and his growing frustration with his own situation is making him question his own loyalty to his father.Sadly, `A Better Life' works better on paper than it does on film.  When Bichir is not on the screen, the film falters; especially because the depiction of the gang and Carlos's son's friends are pretty clich&eacute;d and poorly acted.  It takes you out of the gritty realism that Bichir brings to his role and his scenes.  It felt like two separate films conflicting with one another; which is semi-understandable considering that Carlos and his son live in two separate worlds, but the cohesion needed to meld these two worlds together was missing.  Bichir is remarkable though; a slow burning performance that grows in intensity but contains so much subtlety.  His final scene with his son left me a puddle of tears.  It was superbly played and possibly one of the single most moving scenes I've seen in all cinema this year.I would recommend this film.  It tells a beautiful story of one man's drive to help better his son's life.  It doesn't work as a whole as well as I wanted it to, for it does in moments seem too simply crafted, but simple can be rewarding when it is done right; and there are many moments in `A Better Life' that are certainly done VERY right.",4,Bichir's SAG nomination is no joke!,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,2261,"['few', 'months', 'back', 'well', 'been', 'while', 'now', 'local', 'Independent', 'Theater', 'was', 'playing', 'special', 'showing', 'Better', 'Life', 'wife', 'snuck', 'away', 'kids', 'indulge', 'one', 'favorite', 'pastimes', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'had', 'read', 'good', 'ink', 'Demian', 'Bichir', 'performance', 'so', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'hype', 'was', 'about.Wow', 'was', 'outstanding.The', 'film', 'centers', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'named', 'Carlos', 'working', 'gardener', 'LA', 'came', 'America', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'hoping', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'Years', 'later', 'raising', 'now', 'teenage', 'son', 'alone', 'life', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'better', 'hard', 'day', 'day', 'out', ""n't"", 'making', 'much', 'headway', 'When', 'business', 'opportunity', 'Carlos', 'hesitant', 'embrace', 'push', 'sister', 'leap', 'hoping', 'payoff', 'will', 'be', 'grand', 'meantime', 'son', 'being', 'persuaded', 'schoolmates', 'join', 'gang', 'growing', 'frustration', 'own', 'situation', 'making', 'question', 'own', 'loyalty', 'father.Sadly', 'Better', 'Life', 'works', 'better', 'paper', 'film', 'When', 'Bichir', 'not', 'screen', 'film', 'falters', 'especially', 'depiction', 'gang', 'Carlos', 'son', 'friends', 'are', 'pretty', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'poorly', 'acted', 'gritty', 'realism', 'Bichir', 'role', 'scenes', 'felt', 'two', 'separate', 'films', 'conflicting', 'one', 'semi-understandable', 'considering', 'Carlos', 'son', 'live', 'two', 'separate', 'worlds', 'cohesion', 'needed', 'meld', 'two', 'worlds', 'together', 'was', 'missing', 'Bichir', 'remarkable', 'slow', 'burning', 'performance', 'intensity', 'so', 'much', 'subtlety', 'final', 'scene', 'son', 'left', 'puddle', 'tears', 'was', 'superbly', 'played', 'possibly', 'one', 'single', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'cinema', 'year.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'beautiful', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'drive', 'help', 'better', 'son', 'life', ""n't"", 'work', 'whole', 'as', 'well', 'wanted', 'moments', 'seem', 'too', 'simply', 'crafted', 'simple', 'can', 'be', 'rewarding', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'Better', 'Life', 'are', 'certainly', 'done', 'VERY', 'right']",N/A

1460964,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B005HFI7HQ,DVD Verdict,"[3, 7]","Franck Tabouring, DVD Verdict --The plot of A Better Life remains rather simplistic throughout, starting off with a look at Carlos' everyday life as an L.A. gardener. Determined to offer his son a secured future, Carlos invests every dime he has into his buddy's truck and gardening tools, which he plans to use to build his own business. Carlos obviously doesn't have a driver's license or insurance, but he believes he'll be fine as long as he doesn't raise any suspicion. Alas, things take a turn for the worse when one of Carlos' new colleagues steals his truck right from under his nose. As a result, he and his son decide to track down the thief and retrieve the one last thing that binds Carlos to his hope for a better lifestyle.In a nutshell, the movie spends most of its roughly 100-minute running time following Carlos and Luis as they slowly start to bond while searching for the stolen vehicle. Both characters have opposing views of how to make a living as an illegal immigrant, and their relationship isn't exactly rock solid when we first meet them. While Carlos believes that hard, honest work can indeed lead to a more successful life, Luis finds himself drawn to the dangerous lifestyle of neighborhood gangs. Searching for the truck provides them with opportunities to both implement some of their own ways of handling things, thus building the ideal opportunity for father and son to connect.While all this sounds very engaging, A Better Life has its weaknesses. While some scenes and plot turns feel a little forced, other moments in the movie do indeed feel a bit overdramatic. A film like this one obviously can't survive without the necessary dose of heartfelt drama, but some of Carlos' and Luis' actions lack plausibility. Additionally, some of the coincidences these two characters clash with end up being more unconvincing than believable. This doesn't hurt the film as a whole that much, but it creates enough cause for viewers to occasionally raise their eyebrows. The film's third act sets itself apart from the rest in that it goes all saccharine on us, but I didn't necessarily consider that to be a flaw.What really lifts A Better Life into the realm of solid independent dramas is the cast. It goes without saying that Demi&agrave;n Bichir is a fabulous actor, and in the role of concerned father Carlos, he turns in yet another powerful performance. Fueling his character with a strong sense of sincerity, he brings a ton of emotion to his performance, making it incredibly easy for viewers to instantly connect with his personality. Jos&eacute; Juli&agrave;n's Luis is a bit tougher to like right away, but he too does a fine job portraying a teenage son flirting with gang life. He's the kind of actor whose facial expressions alone say enough about his personality.Director Chris Weitz brings a simple, yet efficient direction to the project. His filmography includes About a Boy, The Golden Compass, and The Twilight Saga: New Moon, proving he's more than capable of jumping in between genres. His first foray into the independent genre is a success as well. The film's production values are solid, and in terms of technical aspects, A Better Life looks great on DVD. The disc boasts a clean, sharp 1.78:1 widescreen transfer of the feature, shining with great, clear picture quality and decent colors. Audio is provided through a solid Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix. Extras on the DVD include deleted scenes, a music video, and audio commentary by Chris Weitz.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,See it for the acting performances,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,3533,"['Franck', 'Tabouring', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'plot', 'A', 'Better', 'Life', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'starting', 'off', 'look', 'Carlos', 'everyday', 'life', 'L.A.', 'gardener', 'Determined', 'offer', 'son', 'secured', 'future', 'Carlos', 'dime', 'buddy', 'truck', 'gardening', 'tools', 'use', 'build', 'own', 'business', 'Carlos', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'have', 'driver', 'license', 'insurance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'raise', 'suspicion', 'Alas', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'one', 'Carlos', 'new', 'colleagues', 'truck', 'right', 'nose', 'result', 'son', 'decide', 'track', 'down', 'thief', 'retrieve', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'Carlos', 'hope', 'better', 'lifestyle.In', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'most', 'roughly', '100-minute', 'running', 'time', 'following', 'Carlos', 'Luis', 'slowly', 'start', 'bond', 'searching', 'stolen', 'vehicle', 'characters', 'have', 'opposing', 'views', 'how', 'make', 'living', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'rock', 'solid', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'Carlos', 'hard', 'honest', 'work', 'can', 'indeed', 'lead', 'more', 'successful', 'life', 'Luis', 'drawn', 'dangerous', 'lifestyle', 'neighborhood', 'gangs', 'Searching', 'truck', 'opportunities', 'implement', 'own', 'ways', 'handling', 'things', 'thus', 'building', 'ideal', 'opportunity', 'father', 'son', 'connect.While', 'very', 'engaging', 'A', 'Better', 'Life', 'weaknesses', 'scenes', 'plot', 'turns', 'feel', 'little', 'forced', 'other', 'moments', 'movie', 'do', 'indeed', 'feel', 'bit', 'overdramatic', 'film', 'one', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'survive', 'necessary', 'dose', 'heartfelt', 'drama', 'Carlos', 'Luis', 'actions', 'lack', 'plausibility', 'Additionally', 'coincidences', 'two', 'characters', 'clash', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'unconvincing', 'believable', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'film', 'whole', 'much', 'enough', 'cause', 'viewers', 'occasionally', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'apart', 'rest', 'saccharine', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'consider', 'be', 'really', 'A', 'Better', 'Life', 'realm', 'solid', 'independent', 'dramas', 'cast', 'saying', 'Demi', 'agrave', 'Bichir', 'fabulous', 'actor', 'role', 'concerned', 'father', 'Carlos', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Fueling', 'character', 'strong', 'sense', 'sincerity', 'ton', 'emotion', 'performance', 'making', 'incredibly', 'easy', 'viewers', 'instantly', 'connect', 'personality', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Juli', 'agrave', 'Luis', 'bit', 'tougher', 'like', 'right', 'away', 'too', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'teenage', 'son', 'flirting', 'gang', 'life', 'kind', 'actor', 'facial', 'expressions', 'alone', 'say', 'enough', 'personality.Director', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'simple', 'yet', 'efficient', 'direction', 'project', 'filmography', 'Boy', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'New', 'Moon', 'proving', 'more', 'capable', 'jumping', 'genres', 'first', 'foray', 'independent', 'genre', 'success', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'solid', 'terms', 'technical', 'aspects', 'A', 'Better', 'Life', 'great', 'DVD', 'disc', 'clean', 'sharp', '1.78:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'feature', 'shining', 'great', 'clear', 'picture', 'quality', 'decent', 'colors', 'Audio', 'provided', 'solid', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'surround', 'mix', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'music', 'video', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Chris', 'Weitz.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",N/A

1460966,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005HFI7HQ,Grady Harp,"[26, 29]","A BETTER LIFE is one of the more understated films to come out of Hollywood, a film that has the courage to tell a story that is so politically charged - the immigration debate - that releasing it now is on the one hand asking for negative responses and on the other hand offers to the public the real truths behind our quandary about immigration.  This country consists of immigrants - all of us - no matter how far back we have to trace our ancestry: the only people who did not begin their family history as immigrants from every country in the world  and the Native Americans, and look how we are treating them!  If this film does nothing else than plead the case of human understanding it will have accomplished more than legions of films that touch this subject too lightly.Carlos Galindo (Demi&aacute;n Bichir, in an extraordinarily fine performance) crossed the border into the US with his new wife, looking for a way to improve his life.  Upon arriving his wife gave birth to their son Luis (Jos&eacute; Juli&aacute;n) and then promptly left Carlos in search of a better life, leaving Carlos to raise Luis alone.  Carlos is an honest, caring man who must live in the shadow of being illegal: he cannot have a driver's license or papers that allow him the benefits of other people. Carlos has a steady job as a gardener with Blasco (Joaqu&iacute;n Cosio) who owns a truck and the two men work hard as gardeners.When the film opens Carlos is saving is money from working with Blasco, living in a tiny house in the smarmy side of Los Angeles,  trying to provide better schooling for his 15 year old Luis. Luis is of the age when he is easily influenced by his peers: his best friend is Ramon (Gabriel Chavarria) who is waiting to be of age to join the gang and forget about school in lieu of making money and living high. Luis is tempted to follow him, but he still attends school despite frequent absences and disinterest in education. Carlos is faced with a dilemma: Blasco wants to leave the business of gardening and suggests Carlos buy his truck and tools and start his own business.  While Carlos sees the future in owning his own business (he can provide hope for a better life for Luis) he doesn't have enough money saved to buy the truck.  His sister, indebted to Carlos for his protection and help, brings him her savings and Carlos buys the truck.  Luis is surprised and then proud of his father's courage, but the happiness is short lived as one of the day laborers Carlos befriended - Santiago (Carlos Linares) - steals the truck, sells it on the black market and sends the money to his family in Mexico. It is this moment that provides an important turn for the relationship between Carlos and Luis.  Luis bonds with his father and together they manage to locate the truck and take it back, only to be caught by the police for driving without a windshield.  Carlos is jailed, Luis is devastated, but as Carlos is deported Luis pleads with him to 'come back home'.  The film's ending tests the credibility a bit but it is heartwarming nevertheless.The story as written by Eric Eason and Roger L. Simon is genuinely real and never veers toward the maudlin.  They have created characters who not only demonstrate the importance of father son understanding and relationships, but they have approached the entire gamut of immigrant challenges and the manner in which this country deals with current immigrants in an honest manner.  Without waving banners for or against immigration problems director Chris Weitz offers us the opportunity to see life from a different angle.  One of the reasons this movie is so powerful in its impact and message is due to the brilliant performance by Demi&aacute;n Bichir, hopefully a candidate for an Oscar, and his performance is beautifully balanced by that of Jos&eacute; Juli&aacute;n as his son. The film is scored by Alexandre Desplat and the music greatly enhances the rhythms of the story. There is such worth in this film that it would be wise for everyone in this country to view it - and remember our individual heritages and histories.

Corn ""reviewer""","[7, 7]","This  movie may not have received enough attention because of  its theme: a father, an illegal immigrant, struggling for a better life for himself and his son. But there isn't a political agenda here, no message that illegal immigration is ""right"" or ""wrong."" The film simply and poignantly portrays one family's experiences. The real surprise is how deftly this is done when it could have been a sloppy or heavy handed movie.Carlos, the Mexican father living illegally in Los Angeles, has a stoic integrity and determination. His son Luis gives meaning to his life. Unfortunately, Luis is full  of mixed emotions with anger often winning out. Should he join a gang? Give up hope that things will get better? Reject his father's ""old-fashioned"" values?The varied characters gave the movie a special intensity for me. The movie doesn't pull any punches or give in to easy solutions or try to hit viewers over the head with a particular point of view. The director ( Chris Weitz) is savvy enough to let events unfold  naturally, showing Carlos at work, Luis dealing with tensions at school and home, father and son struggling to understand each other.There is also a pivotal event which creates dramatic tension but to mention details would ruin this movie for viewers. How that moment is handled helps define the father/son connection. While I still consider the film well worth seeing, I was a bit disappointed in the abrupt ending and would have liked to see more about how things unfolded.

Carlos Galindo(Demian Bichir) is a former day laborer who has now found consistent work with Blaso Martinez(Jaoquin Cosio), owner of a small Landscaping company that tends to the homes of the rich and affluent of Los Angeles. Luis(Jose Julian) is Carlos teenage son. They live in gang territory where Luis attends a fortess like school where learning is not a priority. His friend Ramon(Gabriel Chavarria)just can't wait to join a gang and is pressuring Luis to be initiated into the gang as well. Carlos is a decent and moral person who wants a better life for his son.As Blasco nears retirement he offers Carlos the opportunity to buy his Ford pickup truck. Buying the truck as you will see also buys the landscaping business. The rich clients will of course recognize the truck and not worry about which illegal has shown up to tend to their opulent lawns. Carlos must chose between the uncertainty of day labor and finding the money to buy the truck. Ultimately he chooses the truck and that is where the tension and drama occur. When his truck is stolen he must get it back. The search to find his truck takes the father and son on a shared journey, a journey that brings them closer together. Carlos is faced with many obstacles where he could easily abandon his moral code and resort to violence. But he doesn't succumb. His son learns from this.Concerning our immigration policy the Director, Chris Weitz, does no sermonizing. Instead he lets the terrific story stand on it's own merits. And the film has many merits. This movie should encourage you, as it did for me, to reexamine the immigration debate. After watching this enjoyable movie it sparked me to question our immigration policies -what is gained by deporting honest and hard working people like Carlos? Conservatives portray a picture of only bad people, criminals sneaking into this country and causing all kinds of problems. Mostly they are not criminals just people wanting a better life and who are willing to work hard in honest endeavors to earn it. Where are the compassionate conservatives who might favor reform ideas like letting honest persons who have otherwise obeyed our laws and worked hard have the opportunity to become citizens.

Living in a one-bedroom shack with his 14 year old son Luis (Jose Julian), Carlos hopes to provide a better life for his boy.  Making a living as a gardener, Carlos has an opportunity to take over the business from his boss, but must first buy his truck and tools.  Borrowing money from his sister who married a gringo, he makes the purchase.Shortly thereafter, he hires a helper who had befriended him earlier only to have the helper steal the truck.  Without proper papers or even a driver's license, Carlos must find the truck on his own, with some assistance from Luis.  Directed by Chris Weitz (""About a Boy""), the film doesn't break new ground but certainly amplifies the immigration issue in the U. S.  Bichir is very effective with a wide range of emotion.  His son (a citizen) is teetering on the edge of joining a gang, but is a good kid underneath.  Eventually he sees the strength of his father in a gut wrenching conclusion.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The video is excellent throughout.

1460987,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005HFI7HQ,Tommy Dooley,"[3, 3]","This is one of those movies er sorry `films' that should have reached a much wider audience. It tells the story of an illegal immigrant from Mexico to East L.A. called Carlos Galindo (Demian Bichir), he has sold his labour for a few dollars to give his son the chances that he never had. Only problem is that he is an illegal and so therefore works for a pittance and that means he can only live on the wrong side of town. This means his only son Luis has to go to East Los Angeles High School for Gang members etc.  A place where having `twatoos', (as I call them), is de rigueur. Luis though seems to try to avoid all of that but it is nigh on impossible to not get swept up in that sub culture.Meanwhile Carlos's boss, who he gardens for, is leaving and offers to sell him his truck and therefore the gardening business. He asks his hard pressed sister for a loan and decides that this is his big chance to really change things through honest hard work. Luis has been spending his time being suspended from school and or watching MTV shoeing programmes of  `cribs' of Gangsta rappers and the juxtaposition with their one bedroom pit could not be more stark. This new venture though seems to make him take note.This film by director Chris Weitz is an understated gem. He also gets all of his actors to do all of the stunts thus to keep the realism there and avoid stunt doubles. He also does all the stunts first himself to prove they can be done. He takes us on a tour of life as an underclass and how it is such people who are the unseen and unappreciated workers in the background that do so many of the jobs no-one else wants. That is not paraded for anyone though it is simply laid out for you to judge (unlike Loach's `Bread and Roses' for example).Whilst this is a story of struggle and bad breaks it still maintains a kind of forlorn hope that things can get better and that is one of its main strengths.

1460988,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005HFI7HQ,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Director Chris Weitz, known for his work on the last installment of the 'Twilight' series, here has decided to tackle a more conventional immigration drama. At first glance, 'A Better World' has all the trappings of your typical saga about an undocumented, illegal alien, who struggles to survive economically, while raising a rebellious, teenage son. Thanks to Mexican actor, Demian Bichir (known for his role as Fidel Castro in Soderburgh's 'Che') and an exciting second act twist, 'A Better World' manages to rise above convention, leading us to the rarefied world of compelling drama.'A Better World' opens slowly as we meet Bichir as Carlos Galindo, the undocumented worker living in a rundown house in Los Angeles, whose son, Luis, has been flirting with gang members at school. Carlos can hardly keep track of Luis, as he's busy slaving away as an assistant landscaper for his boss, who keeps trying to sell him the truck he uses for day to day business. Carlos can be his 'own man' if he purchases the truck but hesitates, as he realizes that he has no driver's license and can be stopped at any time by the police. When his sister convinces him to accept $12,000 which she originally stored away for her children's education, Carlos purchases the truck, and is ready to start a new career as self-employed entrepreneur. He soon finds an assistant to help him in the business, which leads to disastrous consequences.WARNING--BIG SPOILERS AHEAD! The film suddenly becomes gripping when Carlos' truck is stolen by the assistant and he must go on a journey to recover it. Luis, initially alienated, now joins his father in the search for the truck, and finds himself bonding with the 'old man'. Along the way, Carlos tries to check his son's impulsiveness, by preventing him from administrating a more punishing beating to the assistant, after they discover where he is, and recover the car.Just as things look like they've gotten much better, the truck is pulled over by the cops and Carlos is arrested by the immigration authorities. Luis initially couldn't understand why Carlos didn't attempt to flee from the police while they were together in the truck, but later accepts the fact that his father consistently feels he must live by a set of high, moral principles.The setup for Carlos' tender farewell to his son while incarcerated in the Federal lockup, doesn't ring true, as the authorities in reality probably wouldn't have extended the courtesy to the son, to have a last minute tte-&agrave;-tte. Nonetheless, the words of farewell are quite emotional and heartfelt, as the father exhorts the son to live a moral life, unencumbered by avarice and the need to associate with undesirable companions. And Carlos fulfills his promise to Luis to return to the U.S., this time choosing devotion to his family over obeying the law. At film's end, Carlos is seen bravely, but illegally attempting to enter the United States once again.Birchir is excellent as the frustrated father, who manages to contain his anger, despite all the hard knocks he sustains, along the way. I didn't always understand everything Jos&eacute; Juli&aacute;n as Luis was saying when he interacts with the gang members, but the young actor is at his best when he communicates the new found respect for his father, after joining him in the quest to find the truck. Most impressive is Dolores Heredia as Carlos' sister, Anita, who exudes boundless integrity in the short scenes she performs in.'A Better Life' proves that there are illegal immigrants who are good people and are deserving of some kind of amnesty program. Hard core right-wingers may disagree but there should be some kind of policy that sorts out the good from the bad. Not everyone works to perfection in 'A Better Life', particularly the slow-moving exposition of the first Act, but as the story picks up, particularly in the second act, we soon come to realize that 'A Better Life', is deserving of the moniker of compelling drama.",4,"Slow-moving exposition gives way to gripping second act machinations, in this heart-felt immigrant saga",1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,4022,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Director', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'known', 'work', 'last', 'installment', ""'Twilight"", 'series', 'here', 'decided', 'tackle', 'more', 'conventional', 'immigration', 'drama', 'first', 'glance', 'A', 'Better', 'World', 'trappings', 'typical', 'saga', 'undocumented', 'illegal', 'alien', 'who', 'survive', 'economically', 'raising', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'son', 'Thanks', 'Mexican', 'actor', 'Demian', 'Bichir', 'known', 'role', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'Soderburgh', ""'Che"", 'exciting', 'second', 'act', 'twist', 'A', 'Better', 'World', 'manages', 'rise', 'convention', 'leading', 'rarefied', 'world', 'compelling', 'drama', 'Better', 'World', 'opens', 'slowly', 'meet', 'Bichir', 'Carlos', 'Galindo', 'undocumented', 'worker', 'living', 'rundown', 'house', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'son', 'Luis', 'been', 'flirting', 'gang', 'members', 'school', 'Carlos', 'can', 'hardly', 'keep', 'track', 'Luis', 'busy', 'slaving', 'away', 'assistant', 'landscaper', 'boss', 'who', 'trying', 'sell', 'truck', 'day', 'day', 'business', 'Carlos', 'can', 'be', ""'own"", 'man', 'purchases', 'truck', 'driver', 'license', 'can', 'be', 'stopped', 'time', 'police', 'When', 'sister', 'accept', '12,000', 'originally', 'stored', 'away', 'children', 'education', 'Carlos', 'purchases', 'truck', 'ready', 'start', 'new', 'career', 'self-employed', 'entrepreneur', 'soon', 'assistant', 'help', 'business', 'disastrous', 'consequences.WARNING', 'BIG', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'film', 'suddenly', 'gripping', 'when', 'Carlos', 'truck', 'stolen', 'assistant', 'must', 'go', 'journey', 'recover', 'Luis', 'initially', 'alienated', 'now', 'father', 'search', 'truck', 'bonding', ""'old"", 'man', 'way', 'Carlos', 'check', 'son', 'impulsiveness', 'preventing', 'administrating', 'more', 'punishing', 'beating', 'assistant', 'discover', 'where', 'recover', 'car.Just', 'things', 'look', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'much', 'better', 'truck', 'pulled', 'over', 'cops', 'Carlos', 'arrested', 'immigration', 'authorities', 'Luis', 'initially', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Carlos', 'did', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'flee', 'police', 'were', 'together', 'truck', 'later', 'fact', 'father', 'consistently', 'must', 'live', 'set', 'high', 'moral', 'principles.The', 'setup', 'Carlos', 'tender', 'farewell', 'son', 'incarcerated', 'Federal', 'lockup', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'authorities', 'reality', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'extended', 'courtesy', 'son', 'have', 'last', 'minute', 'tte-', 'agrave', '-tte', 'Nonetheless', 'words', 'farewell', 'are', 'quite', 'emotional', 'heartfelt', 'father', 'son', 'live', 'moral', 'life', 'unencumbered', 'avarice', 'need', 'associate', 'undesirable', 'companions', 'Carlos', 'promise', 'Luis', 'return', 'U.S.', 'time', 'choosing', 'devotion', 'family', 'obeying', 'law', 'film', 'end', 'Carlos', 'seen', 'bravely', 'illegally', 'attempting', 'enter', 'United', 'States', 'once', 'again.Birchir', 'excellent', 'frustrated', 'father', 'who', 'contain', 'anger', 'hard', 'knocks', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'understand', 'everything', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Juli', 'aacute', 'Luis', 'was', 'saying', 'when', 'gang', 'members', 'young', 'actor', 'best', 'when', 'new', 'found', 'respect', 'father', 'joining', 'quest', 'find', 'truck', 'Most', 'impressive', 'Dolores', 'Heredia', 'Carlos', 'sister', 'Anita', 'who', 'boundless', 'integrity', 'short', 'scenes', 'Better', 'Life', 'proves', 'are', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'deserving', 'kind', 'amnesty', 'program', 'Hard', 'core', 'right-wingers', 'may', 'disagree', 'should', 'be', 'kind', 'policy', 'out', 'good', 'bad', 'Not', 'everyone', 'perfection', 'A', 'Better', 'Life', 'particularly', 'slow-moving', 'exposition', 'first', 'Act', 'story', 'up', 'particularly', 'second', 'act', 'soon', 'come', 'realize', 'Better', 'Life', 'deserving', 'moniker', 'compelling', 'drama']",N/A
