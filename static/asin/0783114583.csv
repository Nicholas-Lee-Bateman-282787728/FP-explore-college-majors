I have been a huge fan of John and Joan Cusack for many years, thus the reason for buying this movie. I recently learned some facts about their dad, Dick.  I have seen Dick in only one hugely funny acting role in the movie, &#34;Return to Me&#34;, but was surprised to learn from the special features included in this DVD that the story and screenplay are proof of Dick's talents as a writer.  John Badham did a great turn, as usual, as director. The decision to star John Cusack in this movie was brilliant!  John's performance is right on target in this classic Western.  The film is cast with an array of wonderful performers, such as, L.Q. Jones, John McGinley, John Goodman, Miranda Otto, and Scott Wilson, as well as many others.  We quickly learn that Myrl Redding is indeed a &#34;Jack Bull&#34; because of his stubborn tenacity, inner strength, and pride. He is also a good and honest man to the bone.  As he seeks &#34;justice&#34;, many people and the law fail him.  He never gives up and is determined to get the justice due him!  Living in a fallen world, we all must come to realize that justice does not always come to us and, in dealing fairly, we do not always receive fairness.  The challenge is to remain true, fair, and just toward others without becoming bitter.  The tragic ending is painful to watch, as Redding tells his son to always stand up for himself, but to do it better.  This is not a typical Western, but is a wonderful character-driven tale that illuminates this good man and his struggle to do and be right in the days just before Wyoming wins statehood.

43203,AAE3M0GXNH13C,0783114583,Flavah,"[0, 2]","The Jack Bull was presented on HBO in April, 1999.  Why it never played on the big screen is a mystery to me. It certainly rivals any western to have come out of Hollywood in quite some time although without the graphic violence, sex and profanity.  True, there are some scenes laced with profanity but these are few and far between.  The violence is under-stated and restrained.The film's title refers to the Jack Russell breed of terrier which is said to never let go once it latches on.  Myrl Redding is like the Jack Russell in his tenacity.  It is justice he wants and justice he will have, even if it means the loss of everything he holds dear.His resolve will be sorely tested as he launches a very personal vendetta against rural Wyoming bully, Henry Ballard, masterfully played by L.Q. Jones.The Jack Bull's plot is riveting and beautifully acted by the entire cast. Watch for an astonishing performance from Drake Bell.  This star is a dead-ringer for a young John Cusack.  I would not be surprised if he were a distant relative.This reviewer was brought to tears during two key scenes in the film (once you watch it, you will know which I mean.)  This is a rarity for a western.  Interestingly, the screenplay for The Jack Bull was written by none other than Cusack family scion, Dick, who, in fact, had a different star in mind to play Myrl Redding, the horse trader.

43204,A30T2B7RFWGYNU,0783114583,FRED C. DOBBS,"[1, 1]","Unlike many of my favorite movies, will only be able to see this one about every 5 years. Why? It's a terrific movie but, geez, it's gut-wrenchingly sad. It's about a young idealistic horse breeder [Myrl Redding played by John Cusack] who seeks justice when two of his prized stallions are abused and ruined by an imperious land baron with whom he has political and ideological differences. When the local legal system fails him he decides to rely on his inborn human rights and natural law to procure justice. This movie is basically a reminder of the innumerous flaws inherent in the human condition and in human behavior especially with regard to the attainment of objective truth from which justice emanates. However, obtaining the truth is easier said than done here as special interests, self interests, inertia, conformity, avarice and egoism serve to obscure it. The 'don't stir the pot' & 'don't burn your bridges' principles are in full force here as local law officials just can't seem to help this guy. Redding's cheesy, weak lawyer is a spineless dud. The local judge and the land-baron tyrant, Ballard [played deliciously well by veteran L.Q. Jones], are pals. The local Sheriff is a lying dog. Redding's wife, Cora---played endearingly by Miranda Otto in a GREAT though short-lived performance---tries to aid her impulsive spouse by getting his OK to travel to the soon-to-be State capitol of Cheyanne to ask the State attorney general for help. Her efforts are fruitless and, in a paralyzing moment for the viewer, Myrl's ""miracle"" is tragically run over by a runaway stagecoach. This is a riveting scene that is notable for the detached, insouciant fashion that townsfolk [including the attorney general who shows up] deal with the tragedy, going about their business without any sense of urgency as the broken woman lay dying. Tough to take scene when Redding's right-hand man and close friend Woody [played by vet John McGinley of PLATOON fame], who was Cora's escort and was responsible for her well-being, returns to the farm with her body. Redding blames himself and all hell breaks loose thereafter as he mounts his relentless 'no killing/no blood spilling' campaign for justice. He rounds up local townfolk and drifters to support him but the bottom line is he's gotta pay them for their 'courage' and allegiance. Redding proceeds to burn Ballard into exodus and burn down the property of anyone who protects or conceals him. A couple of problems prop up, however, as two people get killed and Redding gets the blame. He is now an accused murderer---public support now beginning to wane as he is arrested and sent to trial. Fine performances by Scott Wilson [IN COLD BLOOD & IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, both 1967] as the bumbling, self-serving Governor of Wyoming, John Savage [DEER HUNTER, 1978] as Ballard's annoyingly sadistic hand, and a superbly effective performance by Glenn Morshower who has a great curt response to Redding's question regarding the alternative to refusing the State's offer of amnesty. John Goodman, though, steals the show late in the film as the no-nonsense, fact-finding and sympathetic judge who sets everybody straight. GREAT performance by Fred Flintstone, here. Fueled by the lies of corrupt witnesses a Jury finds Redding guilty [unjustly] of murder and sentenced to hang. The hanging scenario is stark, poignant and plain scary. Notably, Redding displays little emotion as he matter-of-factly gives his son last instructions. No fear here as his life probably ended long before when his cherished and adored wife was killed. The often wooden Cusack here gives an outstanding performance---his countenance alone bespeaking his tenacity, his innate sense of justice, his conviction. The scene where his body is removed from the gallows was haunting and well done.

Not because they aren't spectacular with lot's of special effects, etc, but because of a lack of substance regarding right and wrong. The Jack Bull was released in 1999 as an HBO film. The plot revolves around a man who treats people honestly and respectfully and believes in the law to uphold these virtues despite wealth, power and influence. He expects the same to apply to everyone. He encounters other men who are greedy, and dishonest.Jack Bull follows John Cusack's character in an attempt to get justice when he is wronged.The movie follows Cusack's pursuit of justice through honest means. When that fails, he takes the law into his own hands, eventually gaining retribution from the man responsible.Without giving the plot away, Cusack also must face the consequences for his vigilantism and it's results. This is a movie where the hero is held accountable just as the villian is for the wrongs they have done.The movie may be 4 or 5 years old, it may not have gotten it's well deserved attention when released. But, it is one of those thought provoking movies that stay with you. Well acted, thought provoking.I'm happy with this purchase and believe many of those who may have missed The Jack Bull will also enjoy this superb movie.John Row",5,The Jack Bull,1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,1325,"[""'ve"", 'become', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'many', 'recently', 'released', 'movies', 'Not', 'are', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'etc', 'lack', 'substance', 'regarding', 'right', 'wrong', 'Jack', 'Bull', 'was', 'released', '1999', 'HBO', 'film', 'plot', 'around', 'man', 'who', 'people', 'honestly', 'respectfully', 'law', 'uphold', 'virtues', 'wealth', 'power', 'influence', 'same', 'apply', 'everyone', 'other', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'greedy', 'dishonest.Jack', 'Bull', 'John', 'Cusack', 'character', 'attempt', 'get', 'justice', 'when', 'wronged.The', 'movie', 'Cusack', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'honest', 'means', 'When', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'eventually', 'gaining', 'retribution', 'man', 'responsible.Without', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'Cusack', 'also', 'must', 'face', 'consequences', 'vigilantism', 'results', 'movie', 'where', 'hero', 'held', 'accountable', 'just', 'villian', 'wrongs', 'have', 'done.The', 'movie', 'may', 'be', '4', '5', 'years', 'old', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'gotten', 'well', 'deserved', 'attention', 'when', 'released', 'one', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movies', 'stay', 'Well', 'acted', 'thought', 'provoking.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'purchase', 'believe', 'many', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'Jack', 'Bull', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'superb', 'movie.John', 'Row']",N/A

This is a fine crafted Western movie in all respects. It has a great storyline that grabs your attention right in the beginning and holds it completely up to the end .Just as the story comes to its unusual end ,and we don't want to let go; we are eased back to reality with a moving song and music by Bob Dylan,""Ring Them Bells"",sung by himself.This gripping saga is quite unlike any Western that I can think of. When I finished ,I read all the reviews and found some real interesting things.The story is based on a book written way back in the year 1810.And that it was written in German and had nothing to do with America and the Old West.It must have been a teriffic piece of creative work to adapt it to the location and time of Wyoming Territory obtaining statehood.The outdoor scenes were filmed around Calgary,Alberta and the movie is filled with excellent scenery and excellent use of photography in creating appropriate moods and atmosphere.While there is some shooting,it is very minimal,except for the scene where the Military uses massive gunfire and even a Gatlin gun to mow down a few Indians in an ambush. The movie deals with a lot about personl feelings,corruption and outrageous application of justice. In the fast development of the Old West, during the times when these areas were Territories,it was no time for delaying or unlawful application of justice. Redding,who was being unjustly treated by people and their misuse of power;gave the ""system' a chance to work;failing that,he had no other recourse than to take matters in his own hand,and get his justice.This movie brings home the idea that;""Justice delayed is justice denied.""This is a fine,powerful story with a lot of thought ,meaning and feeling ,so well crafted that it certainly ranks up there with the best.It deserves to be considered a classic for many reasons.",5,"""Myrl Redding didn't fail the law.The law failed Myrl.""",1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,2284,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'store.It', 'seemed', 'have', 'makings', 'western', 'had', ""n't"", 'associated', 'John', 'Cusack', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Westerns.I', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'familiar', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'movie.One', 'liner', 'notes', 'stated', 'Gritty', 'western', 'harks', 'back', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'classics', '.Since', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'stand', 'up', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try.Was', 'ever', 'impressed', 'fine', 'crafted', 'Western', 'movie', 'respects', 'great', 'storyline', 'attention', 'right', 'beginning', 'completely', 'end', '.Just', 'story', 'unusual', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'go', 'are', 'eased', 'back', 'reality', 'moving', 'song', 'music', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Ring', 'Them', 'Bells', 'sung', 'himself.This', 'gripping', 'saga', 'quite', 'Western', 'can', 'think', 'When', 'finished', 'read', 'reviews', 'found', 'real', 'interesting', 'things.The', 'story', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'way', 'back', 'year', '1810.And', 'was', 'written', 'German', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'America', 'Old', 'West.It', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'teriffic', 'piece', 'creative', 'work', 'adapt', 'location', 'time', 'Wyoming', 'Territory', 'obtaining', 'statehood.The', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'Calgary', 'Alberta', 'movie', 'filled', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'excellent', 'use', 'photography', 'creating', 'appropriate', 'moods', 'atmosphere.While', 'shooting', 'very', 'minimal', 'scene', 'where', 'Military', 'uses', 'massive', 'gunfire', 'even', 'Gatlin', 'gun', 'mow', 'down', 'few', 'Indians', 'ambush', 'movie', 'deals', 'lot', 'personl', 'feelings', 'corruption', 'outrageous', 'application', 'justice', 'fast', 'development', 'Old', 'West', 'times', 'when', 'areas', 'were', 'Territories', 'was', 'time', 'delaying', 'unlawful', 'application', 'justice', 'Redding', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'unjustly', 'treated', 'people', 'misuse', 'power', 'gave', 'system', 'chance', 'work', 'failing', 'had', 'other', 'recourse', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hand', 'get', 'justice.This', 'movie', 'home', 'idea', 'Justice', 'delayed', 'justice', 'denied', 'fine', 'powerful', 'story', 'lot', 'thought', 'meaning', 'feeling', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'certainly', 'up', 'there', 'best.It', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'many', 'reasons']",N/A

The Baron refuses, and with no help from the local or federal law  agencies, he takes matters into his own hands.  In my opinion, this is how  the Wild, Wild West really was, as every bit of this movie rings authentic.  Cusack is amazingly good in one of his best rolls ever (among Say Anything  and Grosse Point Blank), and John Goodman is equally as good as a  no-nonsense judge.  This is a good example of the price of taking the law  into your own hands, and I think this one will become a staple in any film  fan's, western or no, permanent video collection.  I give this one five  stars, and that's saying something seein' as how I ain't none too keen on  westerns and all.  Watch this movie.  Buy it.

I'm not a huge John Cusack fan, he's a good actor and I do enjoy some of his movies, but never thought of him as a 'westerner/cowboy' person in a movie. John's performance is near perfect.  L.Q. Jones (Dakota in Lone Wolf McQuade, Sims in Red River) as well as John Goodman step up and give excellent performances.  Visually the movie is stunning with the landscapes, realistic street and interior scenes, and the way the director used lighting to enhance the moment.  The story remimds me of some of Louis L'amour books but handles a topic that's not real easy to do without being sappy.Myrl Redding(Cusack) is a horse breeder with deeply entrenched 'right and just values'.  When the local 'power guy' Henry Ballard (L.Q. Jones), buys so much of the land then puts up a toll 'gate' the story begins.  Redding is taking a string of horses to market.  Two of which( 2 beautiful Black stallions) are already sold to be delivered.  Redding doesn't have the $10 toll so, Ballard says he can leave the two Blacks there as 'security' until he comes back through with the money from sale.  Redding reluctantly agrees and leaves one of his hands to watch over them.  By the time Redding returns, the 2 Blacks have been worked, mistreated, beaten and in really bad shape.  The hand was beaten and run off.  Redding vows that Ballard will make it right by restoring the horses to health and pay his hand $50.  Ballard refuses of course.  The plot instensifies with the typical 'Town Judge' in Ballard's pocket and the people of town afraid to do anything against the most powerful man in the area.The movie takes several predictable as well as undpredictable turns as the tension and story develop.  John Goodman plays his part of Judge in Cheyenne to perfection.  He's both honest and just as well as understanding politics of a town trying to become a capitol and wyoming trying to become a state.Very few movies warrant watching again and again for the story, acting, and quality.  The Jack Bull definitely does and will become a permanent part of my Western DVD's along with some of John Wayne's, Clint Eastwood, Tom Selleck.  If you're a western fan, this is a must have right along with Crossfire Trail, Unforgiven, The Good the Bad the Ugly, Tombstone, Silverado, and Hang em High to name a few.",5,6 stars!

Hard to believe this was a TV movie - kudos to HBO, once again.This is an un-romanticised view of the West - telling it like it was.  A man of integrity might get justice in one way, but it will cost him dearly in another.  From photography in washed out colours, to the slow burn build of events that means guns don't actually get used until late in the movie, this is set out to be both realistic and unflinching.  This asks the question - Just what is the value of going vigilante?  What is the real cost?  Is getting the justice you ask for worth any price?  And the wonderful (and certainly non -Hollywood) thing is, you are left to make up your own mind, there are no easy answers.John Cusack is just terrific here - you might find it a stretch to see him in a Western, but he is utterly credible in a tough role.  Miranda Otto as his wife is perfect casting, and in fact the whole supporting cast is spot on - except maybe some of the chief decision makers of the territory who are somewhat two dimensional.  Enjoy John C. McGinley (Perry from `Scrubs') in a minor role, and John Goodman in a pivotal role - albeit only in the last third of the movie.Music by Lennie Niehaus is similar but less minimalist than his score to Unforgiven, and adds in a wonderful way to the poignancy of the movie, along with some spectacular landscapes which crop up from time to time.  I'm sure Dick Cusacks (john's dad) would be proud of the end result of his script, produced by his son.Don't be put off by the fact this is a TV movie - it certainly rises way beyond its genesis to be something of a classic, born from the mould of `Unforgiven'.",5,In the same class as Unforgiven,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,1671,"['What', 'fantastic', 'value', 'DVD', 'Hard', 'believe', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', 'kudos', 'HBO', 'once', 'again.This', 'un-romanticised', 'view', 'West', 'telling', 'was', 'man', 'integrity', 'might', 'get', 'justice', 'one', 'way', 'will', 'cost', 'dearly', 'photography', 'washed', 'out', 'colours', 'slow', 'burn', 'build', 'events', 'guns', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'used', 'late', 'movie', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'realistic', 'unflinching', 'question', 'Just', 'what', 'value', 'going', 'vigilante', 'What', 'real', 'cost', 'getting', 'justice', 'ask', 'worth', 'price', 'wonderful', 'certainly', 'non', '-Hollywood', 'thing', 'are', 'left', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'are', 'easy', 'answers.John', 'Cusack', 'just', 'terrific', 'here', 'might', 'find', 'stretch', 'see', 'Western', 'utterly', 'credible', 'tough', 'role', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'wife', 'perfect', 'casting', 'fact', 'whole', 'supporting', 'cast', 'spot', 'maybe', 'chief', 'decision', 'makers', 'territory', 'who', 'are', 'somewhat', 'two', 'dimensional', 'Enjoy', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Perry', 'Scrubs', 'minor', 'role', 'John', 'Goodman', 'pivotal', 'role', 'only', 'last', 'third', 'movie.Music', 'Lennie', 'Niehaus', 'similar', 'less', 'minimalist', 'score', 'Unforgiven', 'wonderful', 'way', 'poignancy', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'landscapes', 'crop', 'time', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Dick', 'Cusacks', 'john', 'dad', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'end', 'result', 'script', 'produced', 'son.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'fact', 'TV', 'movie', 'certainly', 'way', 'genesis', 'be', 'something', 'classic', 'born', 'mould', 'Unforgiven']",N/A

43241,A1QYHMXSARAHO4,0783114583,Plank Spanker,"[1, 1]","I just finished watching The Jack Bull and thought it was a very good, true to life western drama.  It was what might happen when one event leads to the next, and then to the next, and so on like a domino effect.  A horse rancher, Myrl Redding (played by John Cusack), is a honest hardworking man who is wronged by a rich cattleman played by L.Q. Jones as Henry Ballard.  He has the town, the sherriff, and the local judge in his pocket, but not Redding.  Ballard feels he is the law and uses his station in life and money to corrupt situations for his own ends.  Redding, on the other hand, is motivated by a deep since of justice, so much so it is a flaw, leading him to make decisions and follow courses of action that sometimes have consequences he fails to foresee.  John Goodman turns in an exceptional performance as an ethical judge with the responsibility of following the rule of law even when that rule falls short of true justice.  While it does have several action sequences it tends to cultivate the drama which sometimes results in those events.IMO it is a different kind of western than it is sometimes compared to, films such as Unforgiven (Clint Eastwood,) Tombstone (Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer) and the like, which are a slightly better to me.

A man with pride and a strong sense of right and wrong.  He wants nothing more than to be left to his own accord.  He is a good neighbor, a good husband, a good father, a good man.  He runs an honest business as a horse trader and his word is his bond.  He is not afraid to stand up to anyone or anything he sees as unfair.  He will speak his mind at the drop of a hat, he speaks the truth as he sees it.In the opening scene he runs into the territory's most powerful man, Henry Ballard, played by L.Q. Jones.  Ballard is equally uncomprosing but not quite as moral.  The interaction between these two uncompromising men in the opening scene sets the tone for things to come.  Ballard takes an instant dislike to Redding.  The line has been drawn in the sand.  When Redding tries to move some horses to sell at auction he finds Ballard has bought more land and has put up a toll gate in his path.  Without the toll Redding is forced to leave his two prize horses as collateral.  Upon his return he finds his horses in a condition unlike that which he left them.  Redding will have none of it and the fued begins.Across the territory of Wyoming the fued continues, to a beautifull backdrop.  John Goodman gives a strong performance as the territorial judge, the Honorable Joe B. Toliver.  Toliver is fair minded and tough.  He wants to side with Redding in the dispute but doesn't know if the law will allow him.  Is Toliver big enough to stop this fued as it snowballs?  Is the Governor of the territory?
