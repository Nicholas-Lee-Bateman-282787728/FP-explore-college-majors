I hate to give this DVD a 3 star rating, but I just couldn't go any higher. The problem is, and this is strictly my own personal opinion based on my own taste, the show wasn't big enough.Rickie can still sing and play just as well as she did when she first hit the scene, but this concert is like an unplugged version. There are only two other gentlemen on stage with her. A bass player, and a percussionist, whom you can't hear very well. They both provide some minor backup vocals, but nothing spectacular. Rickie's also changed the traditional arrangements of the songs.I was hoping for an all out band on stage. Drums, bass, guitars, keyboards, backup singers, horns, etc. Go to You Tube and look up, Rickie Lee Jones 1979 Youngblood. That's what I was hoping for. No such luck.Some people may enjoy these unplugged shows with changes to the song arrangements, and that's great. It's just not for me. Her DVD, &#34;Live at the Wiltern Theatre,&#34; if you can get a copy, is much better. I'll hang on to &#34;Live in Stockholm,&#34; but it may be awhile before I watch it again.

She does 15 songs on the DVD plus 4 B-sides. All of them are excellent, but my favorites were It must be love, Chuck E's in love, Danny's All Star Joint, We belong together, Weasel and the white boys cool and Young blood.",5,Rickie Lee Jones Live in Stockholm,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,350,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'Rickie', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'live', 'DVD', 'time', ""'m"", 'glad', 'someone', 'decided', 'put', 'out', 'great', '15', 'songs', 'DVD', '4', 'B-sides', 'are', 'excellent', 'favorites', 'were', 'must', 'be', 'love', 'Chuck', 'E', 'love', 'Danny', 'All', 'Star', 'Joint', 'belong', 'together', 'Weasel', 'white', 'boys', 'cool', 'Young', 'blood']",Live In Stockholm
1427907,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004TRKGNG,M. Oleson,"[4, 4]","I've found that music concerts provide some of the highest rated DVDs of those reviewed by non-professionals.  No surprise I guess.  Most of us are going to buy/rent concert performances by our favorite artists, so yes we like them.  Back when the decade of the `80s began, Rickie Lee Jones came to the musical scene as an edgier version of Joni Mitchell who was at the height of her popularity.  As a talented singer/songwriter Jones gave audiences some great memorable songs.  Most are repeated here, but with slants different than what you might remember on the radio.  Ms. Jones earlier albums, including the self titled debut and ""Pirates"", were in heavy rotation in my house at the time and perhaps had a minor role in bringing my oldest child into the world.  I had lost track of her musically until recently as I've been diving into my old vinyl collection.  This 2010 concert shows Jones little worse for wear.  Sure she looks older, but don't we all.  She's still feisty and her strong voice is intact.  On the downside, her two man band (drummer and electric bass) are not always in synch with her, especially on vocals.  It's just a little distracting on a few songs.  The concert is directed by Grammy nominated Ian McCrudden, so from that perspective is very well done.  The camera movements, fades and dissolves are perfect for this mostly quiet show.  The 5.1 Dolby sound is just fine although it is missing from the ""B-Sides"" which consist of 4 additional songs.  And for the record, don't skip them.  I'm not sure why they weren't included in the main event as they are some of the best.  And why just in stereo?  Is it that expensive to just do the whole thing in 5.1?  In any case, fans should like this RLJ concert film.",4,Rickie Lee Jones as good as she ever was,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,1741,"[""'ve"", 'found', 'music', 'concerts', 'provide', 'highest', 'rated', 'DVDs', 'reviewed', 'non-professionals', 'surprise', 'guess', 'Most', 'are', 'going', 'buy/rent', 'concert', 'performances', 'favorite', 'artists', 'so', 'yes', 'like', 'Back', 'when', 'decade', '80s', 'began', 'Rickie', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'came', 'musical', 'scene', 'edgier', 'version', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'was', 'height', 'popularity', 'talented', 'singer/songwriter', 'Jones', 'gave', 'audiences', 'great', 'memorable', 'songs', 'Most', 'are', 'repeated', 'here', 'slants', 'different', 'what', 'might', 'remember', 'radio', 'Ms.', 'Jones', 'earlier', 'albums', 'including', 'self', 'titled', 'debut', 'Pirates', 'were', 'heavy', 'rotation', 'house', 'time', 'perhaps', 'had', 'minor', 'role', 'bringing', 'oldest', 'child', 'world', 'had', 'lost', 'track', 'musically', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'diving', 'old', 'vinyl', 'collection', '2010', 'concert', 'shows', 'Jones', 'little', 'worse', 'wear', 'Sure', 'older', 'do', ""n't"", 'still', 'feisty', 'strong', 'voice', 'intact', 'downside', 'two', 'man', 'band', 'drummer', 'electric', 'bass', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'synch', 'especially', 'vocals', 'just', 'little', 'distracting', 'few', 'songs', 'concert', 'directed', 'Grammy', 'nominated', 'Ian', 'McCrudden', 'so', 'perspective', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'camera', 'movements', 'fades', 'dissolves', 'are', 'perfect', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'show', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'sound', 'just', 'fine', 'missing', 'B-Sides', 'consist', '4', 'additional', 'songs', 'record', 'do', ""n't"", 'skip', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'main', 'event', 'are', 'best', 'why', 'just', 'stereo', 'expensive', 'just', 'do', 'whole', 'thing', '5.1', 'case', 'fans', 'should', 'like', 'RLJ', 'concert', 'film']",Live In Stockholm

When Rickie emailed me and told me to get this DVD of course I said, ""YES!"" I've seen it from beginning to end three times in just three days. The chemistry between Rickie, the bassist and drummer is amazing. Even more amazing is who truly masterful RLJ is on the guitar! The singing and harmonies are out of this world. This is truly the best live music DVD I've ever seen. Gorgeous songs from Balm in Gilead and songs from her debut release from 1979. It's too perfect to even describe.

1427909,A3IBRFEYQRDX31,B004TRKGNG,Vincent,"[4, 4]","The performance and technical quality here are both superlative.  Rickie Lee Jones excels in pop, jazz, blues, r&b--and she displays an unusual command of the stage.  Great selection of material and I think her two accompanists augment the music quite well, both instrumentally and vocally.  Particularly amusing is RL's comment on encores--""When I'm done, I'm done.""  One minor complaint:  the four extra songs under ""B Sides"" could and should have been integrated into the main show.  Otherwise, any fan of RLJ will thoroughly enjoy having this show.
