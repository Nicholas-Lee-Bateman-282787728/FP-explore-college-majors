I only object to the interviews with fans, which are very boring, indeed. Several are shot at length discussing how they worship Gould. Enough of that. There is quite a lot of footage of Gould at the keyboard, swaying in circles and humming to himself. Way too much of that is here and should have been cut. I was surprised at how much early footage apparently exists of Gould from the early 50s and beyond. I would have enjoyed more of that, since he was in his prime then. We really learn nothing about his personal life, either, zilch. Nor do we find out how and why he died at age 50. Finally, the film is probably a little too reverential for its own good.",3,I have a feeling this is not all,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,782,"['only', 'know', 'Gould', 'recordings', 'looked', 'forward', 'film', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'sort', 'only', 'object', 'interviews', 'fans', 'are', 'very', 'boring', 'indeed', 'Several', 'are', 'shot', 'length', 'discussing', 'how', 'worship', 'Gould', 'Enough', 'quite', 'lot', 'footage', 'Gould', 'keyboard', 'swaying', 'circles', 'humming', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'early', 'footage', 'apparently', 'Gould', 'early', '50s', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'was', 'prime', 'then', 'really', 'learn', 'nothing', 'personal', 'life', 'either', 'zilch', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'why', 'died', 'age', '50', 'Finally', 'film', 'probably', 'little', 'too', 'reverential', 'own', 'good']",N/A

I for one still cherish my original Goldberg Variations LP recording!This film is worth viewing and listening to because:  Gould explains ever so many things regarding how and why he recorded music and performed music in the manner which made him an Icon during the height of his career.

There are many  unscripted scenes that had been previously been introduced to the editor, where you witness Mr.Gould seeking perfection in the recording studio.

1007872,A2PAD826IH1HFE,B000GWBRQS,J Scott Morrison,"[45, 50]","This DVD is self-recommending if only because it is by our leading music documentarian, Bruno Monsaingeon, and is about one of music's legendary figures, Glenn Gould. Add to that the fact that Monsaingeon and Gould were friends for thirty years and that Monsaingeon had already made a number of previous documentaries about Gould, and you have a recipe for a great film. Monsaingeon is a working musician (a violinist) as well and his ability to understand the musical aspects of Gould's life is beyond question. (There is even a clip of Monsaingeon playing first violin in a snippet of Gould's Opus 1, his String Quartet.) Gould, of course, was himself a documentarian and he certainly left behind miles of film in which he plays, discourses about music and all manner of other things. There are even home movies of Gould as a young teen playing on the family piano.One charming conceit of the film is that Monsaingeon found five 'ordinary people' whose lives had been touched in special ways by Gould's playing and he filmed them in various activities connected with that. For instance, there is a former rock musician who goes pretty far to commemorate her emotional connection with Gould -- I won't spoil the surprise by telling you what it was she did. There is a Russian woman who develops a missionary fervor about exposing others to Gould's music. There is an Italian woman who makes a pilgrimage to Toronto and has a dialog with  the startlingly lifelike statue of Gould that sits outside the Gould studio there.One might wonder what more could be said about Gould after all the previous books and films about him. It is a tribute to Monsaingeon's art that he found a way to approach his subject in a new and fascinating manner. He constructs the documentary as if it were being narrated by Gould himself. Gould's fabled Lincoln Continental becomes a character in the proceedings, traveling through ravishingly photographed northern Canadian forests as we hear Gould discourse in a voice-over on various things. There are numerous video and audio clips, some never seen before, that give us a taste of both his playing and his thinking. We hear and see him play music not generally associated with him -- especially by those who think of Gould as being a Bach specialist -- music by Hindemith, Chopin, Weber, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and others, even Gould's quirky Mozart.Gould's personal eccentricities are not emphasized but are not avoided either. One does, however, come away, yet again, reminded of George Szell's famous remark about him, 'That nut is a genius!'. Gould was an utterly unique and important figure and it is no wonder that almost twenty-five years after his tragic death at 50, in 1982, his life is still being explored and celebrated.So, even if you've seen other films about Gould, including those by Monsaingeon, you will be rewarded by watching this film.Strongly recommended.Scott Morrison",5,Yet Another Brilliant Musical Retrospective from Bruno Monsaingeon,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,2923,"['DVD', 'self-recommending', 'only', 'leading', 'music', 'documentarian', 'Bruno', 'Monsaingeon', 'one', 'music', 'legendary', 'figures', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'Add', 'fact', 'Monsaingeon', 'Gould', 'were', 'friends', 'thirty', 'years', 'Monsaingeon', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'number', 'previous', 'documentaries', 'Gould', 'have', 'recipe', 'great', 'film', 'Monsaingeon', 'working', 'musician', 'violinist', 'well', 'ability', 'understand', 'musical', 'aspects', 'Gould', 'life', 'question', 'even', 'clip', 'Monsaingeon', 'playing', 'first', 'violin', 'snippet', 'Gould', 'Opus', '1', 'String', 'Quartet', 'Gould', 'course', 'was', 'documentarian', 'certainly', 'left', 'miles', 'film', 'music', 'manner', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'even', 'home', 'movies', 'Gould', 'young', 'teen', 'playing', 'family', 'piano.One', 'charming', 'conceit', 'film', 'Monsaingeon', 'found', 'five', ""'ordinary"", 'people', 'lives', 'had', 'been', 'touched', 'special', 'ways', 'Gould', 'playing', 'filmed', 'various', 'activities', 'connected', 'instance', 'former', 'rock', 'musician', 'who', 'pretty', 'far', 'commemorate', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Gould', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'surprise', 'telling', 'what', 'was', 'did', 'Russian', 'woman', 'who', 'missionary', 'fervor', 'exposing', 'others', 'Gould', 'music', 'Italian', 'woman', 'who', 'pilgrimage', 'Toronto', 'dialog', 'startlingly', 'lifelike', 'statue', 'Gould', 'Gould', 'studio', 'there.One', 'might', 'wonder', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Gould', 'previous', 'books', 'films', 'tribute', 'Monsaingeon', 'art', 'found', 'way', 'approach', 'subject', 'new', 'fascinating', 'manner', 'documentary', 'were', 'being', 'narrated', 'Gould', 'Gould', 'fabled', 'Lincoln', 'Continental', 'character', 'proceedings', 'traveling', 'ravishingly', 'photographed', 'northern', 'Canadian', 'forests', 'hear', 'Gould', 'discourse', 'voice-over', 'various', 'things', 'are', 'numerous', 'video', 'audio', 'clips', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'give', 'taste', 'playing', 'thinking', 'hear', 'see', 'play', 'music', 'not', 'generally', 'associated', 'especially', 'who', 'think', 'Gould', 'being', 'Bach', 'specialist', 'music', 'Hindemith', 'Chopin', 'Weber', 'Beethoven', 'Mendelssohn', 'others', 'even', 'Gould', 'quirky', 'Mozart.Gould', 'personal', 'eccentricities', 'are', 'not', 'emphasized', 'are', 'not', 'avoided', 'either', 'One', 'however', 'come', 'away', 'yet', 'again', 'reminded', 'George', 'Szell', 'famous', 'remark', ""'That"", 'nut', 'genius', 'Gould', 'was', 'utterly', 'unique', 'important', 'figure', 'wonder', 'almost', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'tragic', 'death', '50', '1982', 'life', 'still', 'being', 'explored', 'celebrated.So', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Gould', 'including', 'Monsaingeon', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'watching', 'film.Strongly', 'Morrison']",N/A

Bruno Monsaigneon strikes gold with a fresh look at a music giant. All Monsaigneon's films are gems. (his film of Menuhin's return to Russia - the patience and vision sticks with me. It should be made available again.) Monsaigneon arranges his films like subtle puzzles, like paintings. Hereafter is exquisite in that way. Most of the footage used is new to me, and that's saying something since video Gouldiana is abundant, most of it repetitive in varying degrees. Hereafter's colors and sounds are modern and true, even kindly, in their way, as Gould was in his. Monsaigneon divulges a keen cinematic palette so authoritatively it seems nonchalant. Rather much like Gould's playing. His honest affection for Gould is evident. It is, moreover, adoration of Gould's art that sings and makes this film what it is. Gould's playing throughout is stupendous, baronial, overwhelming. I've never seen footage like it! A few high wires, and always that truth-telling sound that was Gould's alone, that wins souls. Absolute recommendation to both acolyte and novice. Thanks Monsaigneon for your painstaking work. And for always looking after Glenn Gould.
