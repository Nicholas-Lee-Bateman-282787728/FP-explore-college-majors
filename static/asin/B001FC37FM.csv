I am comfortable with Maya's teaching and I take inspiration from her. I began with Maya's detox and destress and was so impressed that I went on to get her first two box sets of the journey through the chakra's. I also have some Ana and Ravi Dvd's and Gurmukh's DVD as I have connected with Kundalini Yoga and have a regular practice.There are three classes on separate DVD's and these work with the first 3 chakra's. As other reviewers have described already I found the Sets to be quite difficult initially and then slowly but surely, as I worked within my own limits, I have found that I can achieve more and more and the benefits are amazing! I feel energised, yet blissful...wonderful! I like how the classes are structured and the warm up section prepares my body and mind for the forthcoming sets. Maya's music is lovely. I like the fact that my eyes are closed throughout, unless I need to check a pose.I had practiced Hatha yoga for approx one year prior to discovering Kundalini yoga. kundalini Yoga is now my main practice.",5,Maya Fiennes Kundalini Yoga Classes for the lower three chakra's,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,1177,"['Courage', 'Creativity', 'Willpower', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'DVD', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'Maya', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'favourite', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'am', 'comfortable', 'Maya', 'teaching', 'take', 'inspiration', 'began', 'Maya', 'detox', 'destress', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'went', 'get', 'first', 'two', 'box', 'sets', 'journey', 'chakra', 'also', 'have', 'Ana', 'Ravi', 'Dvd', 'Gurmukh', 'DVD', 'have', 'connected', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'have', 'regular', 'practice.There', 'are', 'three', 'classes', 'separate', 'DVD', 'work', 'first', '3', 'chakra', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'already', 'found', 'Sets', 'be', 'quite', 'difficult', 'initially', 'then', 'slowly', 'surely', 'worked', 'own', 'limits', 'have', 'found', 'can', 'achieve', 'more', 'more', 'benefits', 'are', 'amazing', 'feel', 'energised', 'yet', 'blissful', 'wonderful', 'how', 'classes', 'are', 'structured', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'prepares', 'body', 'mind', 'forthcoming', 'sets', 'Maya', 'music', 'lovely', 'fact', 'eyes', 'are', 'closed', 'need', 'check', 'pose.I', 'had', 'practiced', 'Hatha', 'yoga', 'approx', 'one', 'year', 'prior', 'discovering', 'Kundalini', 'yoga', 'kundalini', 'Yoga', 'now', 'main', 'practice']",Maya Fiennes Kundalini Yoga: A Journey through the Chakras
1191646,A3FII5GIF8X4FG,B001FC37FM,Julie Ann,"[2, 2]","I have never found a Maya Fiennes yoga tape I dislike. For me, her yoga tapes present a perfect harmony between practicing yoga and meditation, and I start my day (as often as I can) with 20 minutes of one of her tapes. Usually the tapes are about 50 minutes long (this one has three dvds in it so that's why the price is higher, but it is so worth it each one presents different exercises and I often see myself being better in the specific chakra area I practiced earlier that day). Within each 50 minute tape, it is often broken into 3 segments of stretching and moving and then quiet meditation, so doing 20 minute intervals within each tape has me working on a particular tape for a few days and then I can begin a new one. Would highly recommend!",5,I adore Maya Fiennes,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,752,"['have', 'never', 'found', 'Maya', 'Fiennes', 'yoga', 'tape', 'dislike', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'present', 'perfect', 'harmony', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'meditation', 'start', 'day', 'as', 'often', 'can', '20', 'minutes', 'one', 'tapes', 'Usually', 'tapes', 'are', '50', 'minutes', 'long', 'one', 'three', 'dvds', 'why', 'price', 'higher', 'so', 'worth', 'one', 'presents', 'different', 'exercises', 'often', 'see', 'being', 'better', 'specific', 'chakra', 'area', 'practiced', 'earlier', 'day', '50', 'minute', 'tape', 'often', 'broken', '3', 'segments', 'stretching', 'moving', 'then', 'quiet', 'meditation', 'doing', '20', 'minute', 'intervals', 'tape', 'working', 'particular', 'tape', 'few', 'days', 'then', 'can', 'begin', 'new', 'one', 'Would', 'highly', 'recommend']",Maya Fiennes Kundalini Yoga: A Journey through the Chakras
1191647,A329WNRIFON9QC,B001FC37FM,KK,"[43, 44]","I love this set of 3 DVDs with one for each of the first 3 chakras (she has DVDs for each of the 7 chakras). Each DVD lasts for a about 40 minutes. There is a warm up section, set (kriya)for each chakra and a meditative section with exercise/s with mantra in each DVD. The warm up for the 3rd chakra was sun salutations and the warm up for the 2nd chakra was the 5 Tibetans.The music is beautiful and I love the pieces with violin music.The sets include some slightly different exercises to the ones in the Ravi ana series and of course some of the same.There is little extra talking besides giving instrutions at the start of each exercise. I like this since it allows me to concentrate inwards/ focus on my body.Valuable addition to a kundalini yoga DVD collection.I also enjoyed her DVDs for the 5, 6 and 7 chakras",5,beautiful music,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,817,"['love', 'set', '3', 'DVDs', 'one', 'first', '3', 'chakras', 'DVDs', '7', 'chakras', 'DVD', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'set', 'kriya', 'chakra', 'meditative', 'section', 'exercise/s', 'mantra', 'DVD', 'warm', 'up', '3rd', 'chakra', 'was', 'sun', 'salutations', 'warm', 'up', '2nd', 'chakra', 'was', '5', 'Tibetans.The', 'music', 'beautiful', 'love', 'pieces', 'violin', 'music.The', 'sets', 'include', 'slightly', 'different', 'exercises', 'ones', 'Ravi', 'ana', 'series', 'course', 'same.There', 'little', 'extra', 'talking', 'giving', 'instrutions', 'start', 'exercise', 'concentrate', 'inwards/', 'focus', 'body.Valuable', 'addition', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'collection.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'DVDs', '5', '6', '7', 'chakras']",Maya Fiennes Kundalini Yoga: A Journey through the Chakras

Each boxed set covers different chakras -- this one covers the first three.  (Warning - the workout for the first chakra is brutal! - in a good way.)  I love Maya's sequencing, selection of exercises, voice, and music.  I do Hatha yoga regularly, but Kundalini only occasionally.
