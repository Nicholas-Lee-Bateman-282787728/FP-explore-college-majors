However, this show must not do what &#34;Bones&#34; did and wait to long to get the two stars together. They almost lost Bones for good.  I understand you let the chemistry build. But then it can be a bit silly. They need to move it a long a bit faster for my taste anyway.  It is a first rate cast, the writing Is great but needs a few changes. But I do love the show and I really love that woman!!!!  lol  I have moved from the mentalist which I was not a fan of but learned to like it enough to watch, then i have moved to Castle. I am now caught up. Please Read the Review of &#34;JB&#34;. This person did a review that felt like he or she read my mind. And JB wrote it better than I will. Castle is funny, a kid at heart, and Beckett is a strong woman, and both have now been throw in a position to go one way or another. In the show Bones, in the forums, and ratings, it showed they had to put bones and booth together or lose the show. It was very simple. The writers lost that battle to screw with us. And House, they gave him and Cuddy four episodes before they destroyed their relationship and the show for good. And that show could have gone on for at least ten to 15 years depending on what they wanted to do. In Castle, they turned him dark, not as funny, they made it all about Beckett and all her whining.She is suppose to be the best Detective, hard and strong. But yet, all she does is whine. And the writers are doing all they can to make us feel like they love each other but they always have something, and it has become usually something so silly that precludes them from having one talk that would clear things up. Then when Beckett gets shot, Castle finally says &#34;I love you, I love you&#34;. Beckett has on so many occasions made remarks about how Castle has not said anything about how he felt about her. So finally in a really tough moment, he realizes He needs to say it to her finally. So he says it, then she passes out and ends up in surgery. This is how predictable this series is. When he said it, &#34;I love you, I love you&#34;. I knew she would say, &#34;i don't remember anything&#34;. And i also knew she would be lying when she said it. Then not long after, she is in therapy which is where we do actually hear her admit that she remembered everything. So again we are ending season 5, going into season 6 and they are not together. I should warn everyone now. The writers think they are clever.  So clever, they are not going to be on the air much longer unless they get these two together. So brace yourself. The things we loved about the show early on, have been gone for a while. It almost seems like they are writing the series and just finding ways to keep them apart. It's not as  fun anymore for me. Not the way it use to be. If they are not careful, they will not be on past season 6 and that is not even for certain. They need to lighten up the show, with the serious themes when they need it, and they need to get them together. Even kids and children have more sense then these adults. These types of shows are so predictable its the reason that most of the time people don't watch them and they are canceled. How about do something different. Put them together and have it work out? They did it on Bones and they are doing well. They ruined House.  The show will do better and the fans will be happy. Don't believe me? Read the forums. Look at the ratings from early on to now. I like this show and i hope they correct it so that it stays on the air. i use to really enjoy it. I am loyal and will watch, and hope they get together and really make the fans happy and extend the years of the show.

If you're old enough to remember, I have to liken Castle to a blend of &#34;Moon Lighting&#34;, &#34;Columbo&#34;, and &#34;Murder She Wrote&#34;.  If you are a fan of &#34;Firefly&#34; you will be unable to stifle a huge grin during the first few minutes of Episode 6 here in Season 2.The 30 second gist of the show is that Fillion is a crime writer who gets connected with an attractive detective and manages to convince the mayor (who Castle is friends with) that he should have unrestricted access to follow her around for inspiration. He's also a huge asset to the NYPD with his understanding of criminal behavior etc. Fillion is great and there is lots of comic relief surrounding the central murder plot so it's not a real downer to watch.  Season two continues to refine the chemistry between Beckett and Castle and their relationship is always in flux with lots of tension and humor.As of the time of this writing, they are into Season 6. We just started watching a few weeks ago, ripped through season 1 and are now halfway through Season 2. Owning them on Amazon is the way to go, commercial free and easy to watch on pretty much any internet connected device, not to mention binge watching multiple episodes back to back makes for nice unwind time after the kids are fast asleep!

1342894,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003F3NDWG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","Witty, suspenseful and fresh! The first season of ""CASTLE"" is the modern ""Moonlighting"" featuring a cool cast and each episode with an entertaining storyline.""CASTLE"" debuted on ABC as a mid-season replacement and began airing on March 2009. Created by Andrew M. Marlowe (""Air Force One"", ""End of Days"" and ""Hollyw Man"") and executive produced by Rob Bowman (""The A-Team"", ""The X-Files"", ""Day Break"") comes a new drama series on crime solving.The first season which featured 10 episodes stars actor Nathan Fillion (""Firefly"", ""Drive"" and ""Desperate Housewives"") as Richard Castle. The famous mystery novelist who is adored by many but behind-the-scenes, he is a playboy who has an on-and-off fling with his ex-wife (who is an actress), another ex-wife who is his publisher and lives with his bright teenage daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn, ""My One and Only"") and his meddlesome mother and former Broadway actress, Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan, ""The Nine"", ""Dharma & Greg"").There is a lot of pressure on Nathan to create another book and with him stuck, his luck starts to change when he meets by-the-book Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic, ""Heroes"", ""The Spirit"", ""Quantum of Solace"") who is investigating several murders which have taken place and the way that they were done were like the murders featured in several of his novels. Because of his knowledge of how things end up with his books, he gets the opportunity to assist the detectives in their case.Eventually, Richard Castle discovers that he can do several things in his life. Write his new book based on Detective Beckett, see if he can woo Detective Beckett and most of all to investigate other murders which he can incorporate ideas for his new book. At first, it seems implausible but with Castle being so well-known and friends with the mayor, Captain Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Huds0n) will do what he can to make the mayor and his boss happy, so he allows Richard to tag along with Detective Beckett.Needless to say, she's not happy about it but with his skills of mystery writing and her skills as a detective, the two find out that together, they can be an effective duo in crime solving. Also, joining Beckett are Detective Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas), Detective Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever) and forensics doctor Dr. Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones).In the first season, Detective Beckett and Richard Castle have worked together in handling various cases.  But one case that Richard would like to investigate is the death of Detective Beckett's mother but Beckett doesn't want him getting into her personal business.In the second season, Richard continues to work with Dr. Beckett and together they try to solve a variety of murder cases including one that deals with a serial killer going after Detective Beckett.  This season also shows us how Castle and Beckett seem to  start showing some affection towards each other but in the process, Beckett becomes closer with Detective Demming.""CASTLE - The Complete Second Season"" features 24 episodes on five discs.VIDEO:""CASTLE - The Complete First Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions. The drama series is quite slick as it gives you the feel of New York and like many abc studios related DVD releases, Disney has always done a good job with their TV show transfers. A show that balances outdoor and indoor shots with good lighting, the picture quality for ""CASTLE"" is pretty solid. I didn't see any major artifacting issues or low level noise that was distracting.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven with a few episodes (that involve gun fights) utilizing the surround channels. The series does utilize quite a bit of music and for the most, the series is understandable and clear.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""CASTLE - The Complete Second Season"" includes the following special features:DISC 5:* On Set With Seamus & Jon - (7:39) Interviews with Seamus Deaver (Detective Kevin Ryan) and Jon Huertas (Detective Javier Esposito) giving a tour of the set of ""Castle"".* On Location With Nathan - (6:50) Featuring Nathan Fillion showing us the crew of ""Castle"" on location.  From those working in audio, craft services, assistant directors, transpo drivers, set production, props, etc.* Manhattan's Most Unusual Murders -(7:57) Creator/executive producer Andrew Marlowe along with other executive producers, writers, director and cast as they talk about coming up with interesting, unusual and innovative murder cases each week for Castle.* Misdemeanors: Bloopers & Outtakes - (2:36) Outtakes from season 2 of ""Castle"".* Deleted Scenes - (9:07) Featuring three deleted scenes: Take 5, More Morlock and Alibi & Timeline.* Music Videos - (2:37) First season bloopers.JUDGMENT CALL:""CASTLE"" continues to be a fun and entertaining detective series.  Despite not being a detective, popular crime author Rick Castle is very good at solving cases and assisting Detective Beckett with her cases.  And through the first season, we know that sooner or later, the sparks are going to fly between the two characters (or will they?).Both Rick Castle and Detective Kate Beckett are just polar opposites but you know that there is this sexual attraction there that makes their chemistry work onscreen. In a way, both are like Bruce Wayne (Batman) in the way they are keen in investigating things. Castle, as a mystery writer and having done a lot of research, puts himself in the shoes of the criminal and thinks of the many possibilities that can exist between the characters.  Detective Beckett, almost having a similar tragic Bruce Wayne story is a by-the-book detective and for the most part, have their unique way of feeding off each other in terms of handling a case.Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic do a great job and have good chemistry onscreen.  Especially the number of verbal quips that writers have included this season for the characters. Here are a few examples from this season:Castle: If something were to happen to me I want you to watch out for Alexis. She looks up to you, and if a worth man would get frisky you can shoot them.Beckett: Nothing is gonna happen to you.Castle: But if it does...?Beckett: Ok.Castle: And would you also go into my closet and get rid of my porn collection before she finds it?Esposito: Don't worry, Bro. I got you covered in that.Castle: I knew there was something I didn't like about him. Too pretty. Bet he takes yoga classes just so he can pick up girls... Probably subscribes to The New Yorker but doesn't even read it... just leaves a copy layin' out where people can see it.Castle: Do you believe people get what they deserve?Beckett: Well, if they do then I must have done something terrible to be punished with you.Castle: Funny.Beckett: You know Castle, sometimes I forget that you have such a capacity for pure innocence in your life.Castle: Yeah, plus it was a great place to pickup chicks.Beckett: Then you open your mouth and you ruin it.Very hilarious season and the writing is also top notch.  The murder cases were absolutely interesting this season and I have to say that the more serious serial killer two-part storyline was fantastic and would love to see more of those serious storylines for season three.With that being said, I often wonder where the characters of Castle and Beckett will go.  For season two, things are now becoming a little bit like ""Moonlighting"" (for those who remember the 1995-1998 detective series with Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis) in which there is sexual attraction and viewers are teased of when these two will actually hook up.  But whereas the hookup pretty much spelled the end of ""Moonlighting"", hopefully ""Castle"" writers manages to do something different.  Personally, I liked where this Demming/Beckett story is going, especially seeing how Castle reacts with it.  Maybe Castle will find another woman in his life and it will be interesting to see how Beckett likes it.Aside from the Castle/Beckett sexual tension of the season and the unique murder cases, season two also features more storylines involving characters Detective Esposito and Detective Ryan which was very cool.  It's great to see the writers stepping things up and to tell you the truth, nothing wrong with adding a few more characters into the mix.  Would love to see another female detective (possible rival to Beckett).This season also featured more Lanie Parish and very little of Captain Roy Montgomery.  It would be great to see the writers utilize these characters a bit more.  But overall, I'm glad the writers did utilize more characters in this season.  I definitely enjoyed the addition of Detective Tom Demming (Michael Trucco, ""Battlestar Galactica"") and I felt the storyline involving the serial killer and Special Agent Jordan Shaw (Dana Delany) were fantastic!  But with Delany busy with ""Desperate Housewives"", I doubt we are going to see more of her anytime soon.  And I definitely enjoy the storylines that involve Castle's daughter Alexis and meddling mother Martha.  Although, it will be interesting to see a storyline that involves Alexis, that would be a great emotional storyline for Castle as his family's life hasn't really been pulled into anything serious.But with two season's playing it safe (despite season two's exciting serial killer episodes), I get a feeling that season three may get a bit serious and possibly episodes leading to tragedy.  Dare I say it, with the majority of ALL  ABC drama series pulling the tragedy card this past season with the exception of ""Castle"", I wouldn't be surprised if ""Castle"" did the same for season three.As for the DVD, ""Castle - The Complete Second Season"" is once again, another solid release.  Where the first season DVD box set, all we got was only ten episodes, we did get a good amount of special features including audio commentary.  With this season being 24-episode long, we get no commentary and several special features.  Also, the few special features on this second season DVD box set features Nathan Fillion, Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever but yet nothing on Stana Katic.  What's up with that?  I'll let it slide this time around but let's have a Stana Katic special feature for next seasons DVD box set!Overall, ""CASTLE - The Complete Second Season"" is another humorous, exciting and fun series and I look forward to the third season.

You just can't beat the cast chemistry, especially between Castle and Beckett.

It was disappointing to see this box set is severely lacking in extras and audio commentary, but I was looking around on Amazon and I foundCastle:  Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center-  it has some awesome stories from on-set, how they shot the pilot, and using the real-life Richard Castle novel as marketing tactic.

Best moment of the season? The opening of episode 6, the first on disc 2; it's the Halloween episode, and Nathan gets dressed up in the Mal clothes from Firefly, and the banter with his daughter about it is priceless, worth the price of admission all by itself in my opinion. (I should mention that I followed Fillion from that show and the movie to Castle in the first place.)More than any other procedural crime show, this one has excellent character interactions. The writers really have it down how a group of friends talks and cut on one another, just their cuts and jabs alone would make a great show without the typical mystery to solve. The fact that Castle and Beckett are both too proud and/or stupid to tell the other they love them gets old, but it also keeps one watching to see when they will finally get together.There are five episodes per disc, until the fifth which has four and the special features. The biggest let-down is the lack of commentary tracks on any episodes, esp. that intro to ep 6 which would have been fantastic to hear Nathan's thoughts on. There are behind the scenes bits typical of season special features, perhaps not as good as those of season 1 but still worth watching.Overall it's a good set, but not the best in terms of the bonus features.

1342916,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003F3NDWG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","With so many investigative/forensic cop dramas around, there is no dearth of procedural murder cases. So the networks tend to hang their hats on spectacular-looking lead characters who can string out the season by dint of sexy banter and the exchange of longing glances. It helps if there's chemistry. CASTLE's winning formula rests on the chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic. But the writers can only draw it out for so long, that romantic tension between the roguish best-selling novelist Rick Castle and the no-nonsense homicide detective Kate Beckett. And maybe I do feel a bit let down that the show in its second season ends up catering to that old recipe of let's almost bring them together only to yank them apart, nyah nyah. Yes, that's what I'm focusing on. Not the weekly murder mysteries (which are mostly never that gripping anyway), not the interesting supporting cast, not the show's humor. It's all about: Can Castle and Beckett just please get a room? No? Okay, *sigh* sign me up for Season 3.Rick Castle's pull with the mayor allowed him to shadow NYPD Detective Kate Beckett as she goes about solving mysteries. But the fact that Castle's fertile writer's imagination lends him a different perspective and insights into the cases, it's this knack of his that makes the 9th Precinct tolerate him (plus, it didn't hurt that he donated that fancy cappuccino machine to the precinct). Except the way the last season ended, the thought was that Castle may have finally stepped over the line. As Season 2 opens, Beckett is still cheesed at Castle for his poking his nose into Beckett's past, specifically into her mother's fatal stabbing. But Castle's exile from the 9th Precinct is resolved in the first episode (and the simplicity of how it's resolved is very cool), and so the Beckett-Castle crime-stomping team is back in business. For Kate, however, in a later episode, there would be a bit - just a little bit - of closure regarding her mother's murder (in the episode ""Sucker Punch"").Okay, just because I was waxing all rhapsodic over the two lead actors, it doesn't mean I don't appreciate the supporting cast, a bunch of engaging characters. Detectives Esposito and Ryan (a.k.a. ""Honeymilk"") seem really fun to hang around with, and these two jokers provide the workplace levity. But my favorite supporting actor is Molly Quinn who is so good at playing Castle's too-good-to-be-true teen-aged daughter Alexis. I happen to think that those father-daughter moments between Quinn and Fillion are almost as key to the show as the flirtations between Fillion and Katic. Castle may foster this charming grown-up kid act, but he takes his parenting responsibilities seriously, and this lends him some needed credibility.This time around, the series writers get 24 episodes to work with, and they play out several plot threads. Of course, there's the above-mentioned cold case centering around Beckett's mom. Castle's racy new creation, Nikki Heat (inspired by Detective Beckett), gets more run and Castle's book about her is even being optioned into a film. But then Castle gets a three book offer to write the continuing adventures of a certain British spy with a license to kill, except how is that going to affect his ride-alongs with the precinct? Things really heat up when the detectives hunt down a serial killer who leaves taunting clues to ""Nikki Heat"" (as he insists on calling Beckett) and the FBI takes over the case. These Feds are ramrodded by a frosty female profiler whom Castle declares is the federal version of Beckett (in the suspenseful two-parter ""Tick, Tick, Tick..."" and ""Boom!""). To my disgust, the show even introduces a new prospective love interest for Beckett.Other episodes I liked: ""The Double Down"" features the detectives and Castle partaking in a little wager to see who can first solve their respective cases; On Halloween Beckett and Castle bump into New York's undead community (""Vampire Weekend""); Beckett and Castle make an appointment with Lady Irina's House of Pain in ""The Mistress Always Spanks Twice""; ""A Rose for Everafter"" has Alyssa Milano guest starring as Castle's lost love; and our guys tangle with an agency that immerses its clientele in fantasy espionage experiences (""A Deadly Game"").One of the cool conceits of CASTLE is the ongoing cameos of celebrity authors who tend to regularly sit in on Castle's poker nights. It's a personal thrill for me because I read guys like Stephen J. Cannell and Michael Connelly.Also, it's nice to see that that fancy cappuccino machine is still going strong.Five DVDs comprise CASTLE - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON, with the following bonus material: a CASTLE Starter Kit which informs you on what you need to know, going in into this show; ""On Set with Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas"" has these two fun-loving blokes give you a tour of the show's set pieces; ""On Location with Nathan Fillion"" as he introduces various of the show's crew members; ""Manhattan's Most Unusual Murders"" is a behind-the-scenes peek at the production team's process of staging the show's murders; three deleted scenes (from episodes ""Deep in Death,"" ""Vampire Weekend,"" & ""The Mistress Always Spanks Twice""); bloopers & outtakes; and two music videos: Hayley Blue's ""Here Kitty Kitty"" and Sky Blue's ""Threshold"" (from the episode ""Famous Last Words""). These extras aren't bad, but an episode commentary or three would've been nice.",4,CASTLE Season 2 - no sophomore jinx,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,5420,"['so', 'many', 'investigative/forensic',

Thanks to the internet [where I have to wait 24 hours for viewing], I've been able to keep up with most of this season's episodes and must say it is quite an improvement over season 1.  I believe one of the writer's from Firefly has come on board, and if I'm not mistaken, Castle even dressed up as Mr. Fillion's Firefly character for Halloween - what a hoot!  And his Indiana Jones getup at the Mummy exhibition was another clever infusion of humor so indicative of this show - as was having Erick Avari, from the Mummy movie franchise, play the curator.

Castle has become bored with Derek Storm, his hero of twenty-odd best sellers. Castle has killed off Storm in his most recent best-seller.  Castle needs inspiration for a new character to create, and he uses his friendship with the mayor of New York to get an assignment to follow seasoned homicide detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic).Kate is rough and tough but somehow always feminine and mysterious. Kate 's mother was murdered when she was a teen, and that loss created the monster that became her drive to put bad guys behind bars and eventually solve her mother's murder.An unlikely friendship develops (a la Bones and Booth of the series ""Bones""), and (of course) sexual tension and serious feelings run high. Through the seasons, Castle develops and grows as he sees the reality and horror of true crimes against the innocent and evil. Beckett develops and starts to push past her walls, occasionally allowing Castle a glance at the truly amazing woman behind the ""iron curtain"" of her personality.The series is greatly benefited by the amazing support cast,  Season Two has some fun paying homage to the Nathan Fillion Sci Fi Channel cult classic ""Firefly.""

Emery,"[15, 20]","I want to state first that this show is excellent and I suggest everyone check it out.This is a review of the product however, which is very disappointing!First of all, they advertised when this was on pre-order that one of the bonus features would be Nathan talking with Stephen J. Cannell again, and this time Stana would be joining them....it oddly was missing from the released product.If that were the only disappointment, I'd have just let it go. However, not only is a piece of the marketing for this product false, the quality of the bonus features are seriously lacking.For example...Where it mentions the bonus features, it ends with ""And much more!"" That's a lie...well, misleading anyway. You see, the only thing not already mentioned in the bonus features is ""music videos"" which would be ""more"" but certainly not ""much more."" Stating ""much more"" implies there will be more than ONE additional bonus feature....which there is not!As for the bonus features that they do provide, there are 3 behind-the-scenes featurettes, 3 deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.The 3 behind-the-scenes featurettes are enjoyable, but incredibly short. (none of them are more than 7-10 minutes long) What makes it expecially disappointing is that the promo on this DVD for other ABC products is longer than ANY of the bonus features! How pathetic!Out of an entire season, there are only 3 deleted scenes on this DVD. What???The blooper reel is MAYBE 2 and a half minutes long.There are 2 music videos; The first one's not a real music video but actually a mock-up of one that they used in an episode where the victim was a singer. The sceond one is pretty good, but again was a character on the show who was a singer.For almost $40, I would have expected better bonus features. And there is NOT A SINGLE COMMENTARY on this set. WTF??? Ok, maybe the main actors were busy...at least give us a commentary from the writers or production!As I stated at the start of this review, I recommend this show to EVERYONE. If you're not as into the bonus features and commentaries as I obviously am, then by all means own this set. However, if you're like me and you buy these things wanting great quality bonus features with your episodes, then wait for the price to go down to around $25, because that's all this set is worth, IMHO.Also, when I took the platic wrapping off of the case, the spine split almost in half. I'm not sure if this was something I did wrong or if others have experienced this as well, so I'm mentioning it. It just seems to me that the spine should have been stronger than this, however I may have been too eager and caused it to split by mistake.",2,Great Show!

The dynamic chemistry of crime writer Rick Castle (Nathan Fillion) working with Detective Kate Becket (Stana Katic) are what gives the show it's edge.  Granted the comedic timing of every character on the show is dead on and makes the show even edgier; you just never know who's going to deliver the next great line.One of the reasons the show stays fresh is that it isn't just about the ""crime"" it's also got Rick Castles family. Castes family throws in another wrench that always adds either hilarity, perverseness, clarity, or something to spin Castles life out of control. It gives more depth to each episode.Showing Castle in the role of father and son has been a fabulous choice because without that dimension he'd just be another cute, fun, jerk. The writers utilize his family not only to move the story line along but also to build depth and sustenance to Castles character which makes him a really likable guy.With great comedic timing, sensational acting, and terrific writing this is one of those shows you stay home to watch. It's one of the few shows where the entire cast is amazing.They also launched the book ""Heat Wave"" in real life, which was a dynamic marketing strategy.

The writing and characterizations make this eminently watchable fare for those who enjoy comedy, drama, mystery, romance, FUN!, fast paced action, well directed storylines, exceptionally well written and FUN TV viewing!  Castle is all of that and more.  Well integrated as an ensemble piece should be, it never lets you lose sight of its main intention &#8212; FUN!  This second season of writer Rick Castle and Detective Kate Beckett's characters becomes more involved romantically, and at the same time reveals deeper personal involvement that my keep tham apart for longer than you might like.  However, the story of the lead players also lets us get more personal with the supporting cast, which is wonderfully well done.  The more you watch it, the more you'll like it!  Simply put, it would make its late &#34;Godfather&#34;, Steven J. Cannell, very happy to see the success it has garnered.  I can make no better comment than to say it deserves your watching.  You can preview it for FREE on ABC-affiliate TNT re-runs several afternoons a week.  Several seasons are being shown at the moment, and as current Season-5 draws to a close in its Monday night time slot, you will get to see more of Castle through Season-4 &#8212; and maybe beyond.However, I am a real fan of continuity, which is to say a lack of distractions.  The DVD set is quite affordable through 3rd party sellers at Amazon, and even at its full rlease price it is not overdone.  The 1st Season was an abbreviated one, but has lots of &#34;bonue features&#34; that make up for &#34;only&#34; 10 episodes.  In fact, the bonus material might help you re-focus on what the creator and director have in mind.  More than this will make my comments redundant, so I will just say go see some episodes, or just buy a good used or new set of DVD's, and enjoy the lack of distractions (commercials).  This is one TV Series that has just about all you want without excess.  Limited graphic looks at murder victims, romance, FUN! (and comedy, too), suspense, GREAT dialog, wonderful characters, continual development, and FUN!

There are so many crime shows out there, and this easily could have become another boring attempt to join this otherwise overcrowded genre.

The supporting actors all mesh well too.Nathan Fillion has excellent comedic timing, and he truly makes this show great.  I love the relationship he has with his mother and daughter.  The family dynamics that exist between these three make the show more enjoyable.  I also enjoy watching the relationship between Beckett and Castle develop, but this could easily become annoying if the writers continues to keep them apart for arbitrary reasons.The bonus features include a couple of music videos from one of the episodes (both kind of cheesy), a blooper reel, deleted scenes, on the set with Nathan Fillion, and a few others I can't remember off the top of my head.As far as content goes, the show is about murder so sometimes gruesome bodies are displayed.

Unless all these glowing 5-Star reviews are from the friends and family of the actors on the show or are from network-studio shills, I have no idea what show these folks are watching.  This show isn't great.  It's not even good.  It's mediocre at best.  Every episode is basically the same--a whodunit with a person killed right off the bat and the police (and writer Castle) investigating the murder. There's minimal character development devoted to the main and supporting characters which may or may not have made the show more interesting.  The worse aspect of the show by far is the female lead, Detective Kate Beckett (actress Stana Katic).  I'm not sure she even qualifies as an ""actress.""  She has zero range, zero charisma and zero sex appeal.  A cardboard cut-out might have done a better job in the role.  Consequently, there's NO romantic or sexual chemistry between her character, Beckett, and Castle (played by Nathan Fillion).  This lack of chemistry kills the show.  Fillion (who was great in ""Firefly"") does an okay job with his fairly listless and semi-goofy character.  As far as plausibility, it makes no sense that his famed writer character would CONTINUALLY go on investigations with the police.  Maybe once, but not thirty times!  I don't even think that would be legal.  He's basically acts like a cop on the show but isn't one.  Supporting characters (and actors) are all HUGE bores.  So little humor, very little romance, run-of-the-mill action and lifeless writing all add up to a pretty bad show, folks.  I got suckered into it by all the great reviews here.
