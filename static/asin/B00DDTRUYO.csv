She has a normal personal life and the personal does not overshadow the  police work or the mystery. Also most of the endings are quite exciting.

She does not need to act nor be treated any differently because she is a female. She takes on all the duties and grizzly crimes as well as any man. She is proof it can be done by someone who was once viewed as only being able to dance backwards while wearing high heels. She shows a totally soft side to her when dealing with her gorgeous husband and beautiful twin daughters. She not only has a tough job but she also has a wonderful demanding family. She has earned every bit of respect her colleges show her.,5,The Great Detective,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,600,"['notice', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'great', 'lady', 'detective', 'was', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'need', 'act', 'be', 'treated', 'differently', 'female', 'duties', 'grizzly', 'crimes', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'proof', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'viewed', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'dance', 'backwards', 'wearing', 'high', 'heels', 'totally', 'soft', 'side', 'when', 'dealing', 'gorgeous', 'husband', 'beautiful', 'twin', 'daughters', 'not', 'only', 'tough', 'job', 'also', 'wonderful', 'demanding', 'family', 'earned', 'bit', 'respect', 'colleges', 'show']",Irene Huss: Episodes 10-12

1655332,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DDTRUYO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","As witnessed by the slate of popular procedural programs on network television, we can't get enough of solving crime! I really enjoy having the opportunity to sample International programs, and the chilly Swedish mystery series ""Irene Huss"" deserves to be discovered by a larger worldwide audience.  The creation of crime novelist Helene Tursten, there have been 12 independent mysteries prepared for television between 2007 and 2011.  The first six episodes have been released to DVD previously, but now the remaining two sets are being dropped and that should complete your collection.Previously released:Irene Huss 1-3: Includes (1) The Torso, (2) The Horse Figurine, and (3) The Fire Dance.Irene Huss 4-6: Includes (4) The Night Round, (5) The Glass Devil, and (6) The Gold Digger.New to DVD:Irene Huss 7-9: Includes (7) The Hidden Watcher, (8) The Treacherous Net, and (9) The Man With The Small Face.Irene Huss 10-12: Includes (10) Ring of Silence, (11) Protected By Shadows, and (12) The Hunted Witness.In many ways, ""Irene Huss"" fits comfortably into the pre-existing slate of procedural crime drama.  There is never any doubt that Irene and her team will crack the case, but oftentimes it is more about the journey than the destination.  What distinguishes the series to me is a fierce lead performance by Angela Kovacs.  Smart, tough, and trying to have it all: Irene is an Inspector with the Gothenberg Police, but she's also a mother and wife.  Her daughters are practically adults, her husband is a successful restaurateur and their domestic tranquility is often compromised by Irene's job. The show balances these components well, and this allows us to see a fully formed picture of a modern working woman.  Of course, unlike most, Irene works for the Violent Crimes Division.  Sweden has always produced some great crime stories.  But with the Dragon Tattoo phenomenon, there might be a slightly higher interest in this seemingly peaceful country. I'm not so sure it's as safe as it seems with all of this perverse crime, the tourist board may need to worry!  In the end, I liked Irene Huss and enjoyed seeing her journey continue.  It may not be my favorite international program, but Kovacs makes it worth a look.Each DVD set contains 3 discs and each episode is approximately ninety minutes in length. This makes for about 4 1/2 hours of programming.  Personally, I think the pricing tends toward the high end.  As of this review, the current non-sale and subject to change price for each of these sets is 39.95.  Just think, to pick up all twelve episodes of the Irene Huss series would be almost 160.00.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that international series of this type are being made available at all, you just might want to watch for sale and bargain pricing if you're on a budget.  Hopefully I don't have to mention it since you've gotten this far, but this is in Swedish with English subtitles.The Three episodes are:10) Ring of Silence:  This case strikes a little to close to home for Irene.  A murder victim (who also shows signs of sexual abuse) is linked to a popular establishment frequented by Irene's daughter.  Solving this one is almost primal as the mama bear emerges.11) Protected by Shadows:  Once again, a case brings danger to Irene's doorstep.  A murder victim leads the police to tangle with a violent motorcycle gang, a gang with a wide reach and important connections.  Getting too close, a bomb scare makes this one personal.12: The Hunted Witness:  Maybe the team could solve this murder if they could ascertain who the victim was!  An unidentified girl is found floating, but she's not a typical drowning victim.  She was bludgeoned and is wearing someone else's diamond ring.
