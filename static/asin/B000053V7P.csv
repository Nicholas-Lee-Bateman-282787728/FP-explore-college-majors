565287,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000053V7P,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 11]","I didn't know that much about Charlie Parker walking into `Bird', and sadly, I still don't know that much about him.  The film attempts to shed some light (figuratively) on the man that was Charlie Parker, but through poor construction and overwrought delivery the film fails at almost every attempt.  True, both Whitaker and Venora are nearly flawless in this film, but their superb acting cannot in the end elevate what Clint Eastwood has done to this picture.Charlie Parker became famous in the 40's for his brilliant mastery of the saxophone.  At least that is what I gather.  He met and fell in love with the feisty Chad.  At least that is what I gather.  They had some kids together.  He had a drug and alcohol addiction problem.  He died young.  I gathered all of this, but this is just a simple and rather bland synopsis of a man who Eastwood tries to paint as extraordinary, as memorable or important.  I never really gathered that.  I never really understood why Eastwood was so fascinated with this man.Sure, he could play the saxophone, but what made him stand out from other musicians with hard lives who died young?I think that the story is here, it is just muddled down by Eastwood's poor production decisions.  The pacing is horrible, applying flashback overtop of flashback with no distinction between the two.  I was consistently confused as to when and what was going on.  Was this before he was married, was this after the kids were born, was this before he tried to commit suicide, was this after he was hospitalized.  Eastwood never truly gets a grasp at what he is trying to tell us.  One minute Parker is collapsing on the floor, the next he is playing at a club, the next he is meeting Chad for the first time, the next he is fighting with her about their children.  Possibly he was trying to create something profound, but he over-thought the construction and it comes off feeling like he randomly selected the scenes he thought looked the best and then strung them all together in no particular order.  But then again, how could Eastwood know what scenes looked the best when it is so hard to see the scenes to begin with.  The film is so dark that I felt as if I was watching a black screen with a few scattered shadows for most of the films running time.  I understand that the darkness may have added to the feel and mood of the era, but there is such a thing as improvised lighting, you know, making the objects visible to the audience.  I don't like straining to see what I am trying to enjoy.The film is a muddled mess overall, but the performances by the two leads are outstanding to say the least.  Whitaker is a tad overrated in my book, but aside from his outstanding `Last King of Scotland' performance this is truly his finest.  He really gets into Parker's head and delivers a heartbreaking portrayal of a lost soul.  It's just a shame that he works harder than Eastwood.  The true standout here is Diane Venora though.  Her portrayal of Chad is not diminished by Eastwood's unsteady hand, for her character is not as central as Whitaker's.  What I mean is that all of Eastwood's horrid decisions take away from the man that was Charlie Parker, but because of the fact that Chad is a supporting player she isn't damaged as much as Parker because she is allowed to develop a strong supporting performance.  Venora does just that, evoking raw and believable emotions with each scene.  She wants to save her husband but she knows in her heart that that is impossible.I really wish that `Bird' would have been handled better.  It's really hard to appreciate how devastating or even moving Charlie Parker's life was when you watch this messy production.  Whitaker and Venora deserve better than this.

565290,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,B000053V7P,Bomojaz,"[14, 16]","An uneven homage to jazz great Charlie Parker, directed and produced lovingly but with lots of flaws by Clint Eastwood. Basically it's a movie about Bird the drug addict and only incidentally about Bird the great innovator of modern jazz. Forrest Whitaker does a superb job in his portrayal of the almost continuously strung out Parker. He looks and talks just like him - indeed at times he seems to become him. It's a wonderful acting performance. But the character is one dimensional - really it could be about any junkie who happens to play jazz. The turth is Parker, like any great artist, worked hard at his craft, was more times than not committed to his job responsibilities, and loved what he was doing and had fun at it. The movie makes little if any recognition of these things. Instead we have a portrayal of the mythologized Bird: the free-spirited, junkie neer-do-well. Who wants to tell a story about Parker where he showed up to a gig on time, played well all night, and then went home when you can tell about the time he was 2 hours late and walked off the bandstand to shoot up in the club's men's room? We don't even get the idea of the martyred artist here, unable to confront the pressures of his art and audience - just a junkie who blew a great sax. And at 3 hours, the picture is much too long. All the arty tricks are employed, too: dark interiors, lots of shots in the rain. A lot was taken off the superior Gary Giddens documentary on Bird, too. There are mistakes galore as well, though Hollywood can be forgiven for that (i.e. he was not Charles Christopher Parker, Jr.; he and Chan did not buy a house ""near Westchester"" but in New Hope, PA, etc.). Some finagling was done with the music also, so that we hear Bird's solos as recorded by him but with modern sidemen added. Why? As a jazz fan I am delighted that mainstream Hollywood would do a jazz movie such as this, and I know Eastwood loves the music.

And, after all, it is their playing that we care about.  However, Clint Eastwood brings so much affection and integrity to this film and Forest Whitaker has such a perfectly fit genius of his own for this role that I think it comes off quite well.Charlie Parker was a tortured soul whose musicianship was so powerful that he was able to teach himself a virtuoso style of playing jazz alto saxophone that has influenced nearly every alto-sax player since.  Certainly, anyone with pretensions to playing bebop jazz.  The film captures his difficult beginnings, his powerful rise and artistry, his terrible drug addictions (and how this also provided an unfortunate influence on others), and his early, far too early, death.There is the sound of his playing throughout the movie, but it is in short snippets.  We get more over the closing credits.  But we get enough to remember what is special and unique about his playing.  Everyone talks about his speed and harmonic variety.  All that is there, certainly.  However, there is also so much in Parker's commitment to what he is singing through his horn that allows us to feel the music in a way that was unique to him.  Without that ability to reach into the heart of an audience, no amount of virtuosity can keep an audience for generations.  Parker is still winning new fans every day and that is his greatest legacy.  This film is a nice tribute to him.

Clint Eastwood does not insist on his youth and origins. He concentrates on the mature musician from the moment he gets into the profession (with a cabaret card) to the moment when he dies and gets out of it, still with his cabaret card, at least in  his dying heart. Charlie Parker represents a very typical case. The musician is stepping out of real life with his music. He steps into another world where the weight of the body and the ethics of the mind do not exist any more, and that's why his music is luminous and so entrancing. We are literally swallowed up by that swinging force because it is from an out world that is beyond pure comprehension and that is only to be enjoyed. But to produce that joy, that beauty and that light the musician has to burn his own life slowly but surely till death ensues. Alcohol, tobacco, drugs, wild living and no regularity at all, insanity too of the psychotic type quite often are the companions and the tools of this musician and even the few friends he meets along the way, both other musicians, or women and men who just love him are not enough to stop the fire that consumes him, especially because without that consumption that burns him inside out he would not be able to play music, to compose music, to create music. Clint Eastwood really renders that psychotic world with a force and a power that makes the film too short even if it were two hours longer. We would like to just drown in that music and in that soul that feeds us that music as if it were the honey of paradise and the blood of life. But every single drop he gives us is a drop he loses in his veins. Till they are dry and the heart empty.

565302,AM7PR12D8180Q,B000053V7P,"J. Lund ""jazzbrat""","[7, 8]","How does one make a mass market movie about a cult figure?  Director Clint Eastwood seems to have a satisfying if imperfect answer with BIRD.  The movie's plot loosely revolves around the relationship/marriage between modern jazz saxophonist Charlie 'Bird' Parker and his last wife Chan.  Criss-crossing this storyline are the two facets of Parker most known to jazz fans: his brilliant musicianship and his alarming self-destructiveness.  The movie does involve the use of flashbacks (rather than moving along in a strictly chronological manner), but not to the point of incoherence.True, the movie doesn't make a strong presentation as to why Parker is widely viewed as being a musical genius (arguably no one in jazz stands taller aesthetically).  Those not familiar with Bird might be left pondering what his exact stature is: a one-of-a-kind musician, or picked off an assembly line of equally-talented modern jazz reedmen by Eastwood because his self-destructiveness makes for a more provocative story?  Perhaps the answer is that Bird was unique, both as a musician and as a human being--his life was a disjointed blend of triumph and tragedy that translates well to a major motion picture aimed at the general public (something the music itself didn't succeed in doing, particularly during Bird's lifetime).From what I know of Bird's life, the movie does a bit of a remix job with the facts, but I would say to a lesser extent than most motion picture bios.  The cast performs admirably, and the DVD is in letterboxed, 5.1 audio, making this format the recommended one  by far.  Perhaps BIRD peeks into Parker's life from a bit of a side-angle.  However, any faults must be balanced against the fact that the end-product effectively leaves it for the viewer to sort out what it all means, rather than doing the thinking for them by outlining a string of easy-to-digest answers in the plot...just like a great jazz improvisation!",4,"The tragedy, and some of the triumph, of Charlie Parker...",986860800,"04 10, 2001",2001,1936,"['How', 'one', 'make', 'mass', 'market', 'movie', 'cult', 'figure', 'Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'have', 'satisfying', 'imperfect', 'answer', 'BIRD', 'movie', 'plot', 'loosely', 'relationship/marriage', 'modern', 'jazz', 'saxophonist', 'Charlie', ""'Bird"", 'Parker', 'last', 'wife', 'Chan', 'Criss-crossing', 'storyline', 'are', 'two', 'facets', 'Parker', 'most', 'known', 'jazz', 'fans', 'brilliant', 'musicianship', 'alarming', 'self-destructiveness', 'movie', 'involve', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'rather', 'moving', 'along', 'strictly', 'chronological', 'manner', 'not', 'point', 'incoherence.True', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'strong', 'presentation', 'why', 'Parker', 'widely', 'viewed', 'being', 'musical', 'genius', 'arguably', 'one', 'jazz', 'stands', 'taller', 'aesthetically', 'not', 'familiar', 'Bird', 'might', 'be', 'left', 'pondering', 'what', 'exact', 'stature', 'one-of-a-kind', 'musician', 'picked', 'off', 'assembly', 'line', 'equally-talented', 'modern', 'jazz', 'reedmen', 'Eastwood', 'self-destructiveness', 'more', 'provocative', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'answer', 'Bird', 'was', 'unique', 'musician', 'human', 'being', 'life', 'was', 'disjointed', 'blend', 'triumph', 'tragedy', 'well', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'aimed', 'general', 'public', 'something', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'doing', 'particularly', 'Bird', 'lifetime', 'what', 'know', 'Bird', 'life', 'movie', 'bit', 'remix', 'job', 'facts', 'would', 'say', 'lesser', 'extent', 'most', 'motion', 'picture', 'bios', 'cast', 'performs', 'admirably', 'DVD', 'letterboxed', '5.1', 'audio', 'making', 'format', 'recommended', 'one', 'far', 'Perhaps', 'BIRD', 'peeks', 'Parker', 'life', 'bit', 'side-angle', 'However', 'faults', 'must', 'be', 'balanced', 'fact', 'end-product', 'effectively', 'viewer', 'sort', 'out', 'what', 'rather', 'doing', 'thinking', 'outlining', 'string', 'easy-to-digest', 'answers', 'plot', 'just', 'great', 'jazz', 'improvisation']",N/A

Hartley ""Zimra""","[1, 1]","&#34;Bird,&#34; produced in 1988, was Clint Eastwood's directorial debut. &#34;Bird&#34; is a gripping drama about the life of Charlie &#34;Bird&#34; Parker, the incredibly talented alto sax player of the bebop jazz genre. The music throughout the movie is simply wonderful. In fact, this is the best feature of the movie, which has interiors that are too dark, dialogue which is unclear, and quick cuts from timeline to timeline which often leave the viewer confused as to what decade it is supposed to be.Clint Eastwood, an avid jazz fan, is also an accomplished jazz pianist. Despite the negatives listed above, he has created a memorable musical sound track of Charlie Parker's genius.Charlie Parker died in March 1955, aged 34. The doctor calling the coroner at the scene of his death described him as a 65-year-old male. Bird was a drug addict, an alcoholic, who had bleeding ulcers, cirrhosis of the liver and a weak heart. At least twice, he had tried suicide by drinking iodine. Several times when picked up for drug usage, he lost his New York State lounge card for playing jazz and had to go to the West Coast to join Dizzy Gillespie, where a lounge card was not required. From our point of view, that was a good thing, for it helped spread bebop throughout California and introduce other audiences other than in NYC, to his fantastical, sensitive and miraculous way of playing.Was it his sensitivity that made him so inept at handling the down times in life? When his little daughter died, he went back on drugs, after having been clean for a number of years, but having also during that time, increased his alcohol intake.Bird died young, on the verge of the rock and roll surge and the waning of bebop. But other great jazz performers managed to survive this time, such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and many another great. It could be though, that Bird died within his time, on the verge of changes in musical taste.The movie features strong performances by Forest Whitaker as Bird, Diane Verona as Bird's wife, Chan, and an excellent performance by Michael Zelniker, as fellow musician and friend, Red Rodney.It won several international awards, and an Oscar for Best Sound for its soundtrack.Whatever Clint's defects in his first directorial job, he has given us a stunning and lasting portrait of Charlie &#34;Bird&#34; Parker, one of the greatest jazz musicians of all time.",4,"Bebop, Bird, Clint",1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,2395,"['34', 'Bird', '34', 'produced', '1988', 'was', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'directorial', 'debut', '34', 'Bird', '34', 'gripping', 'drama', 'life', 'Charlie', '34', 'Bird', '34', 'Parker', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'alto', 'sax', 'player', 'bebop', 'jazz', 'genre', 'music', 'movie', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'fact', 'best', 'feature', 'movie', 'interiors', 'are', 'too', 'dark', 'dialogue', 'unclear', 'quick', 'cuts', 'timeline', 'timeline', 'often', 'leave', 'viewer', 'confused', 'what', 'decade', 'supposed', 'be.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'avid', 'jazz', 'fan', 'also', 'accomplished', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'negatives', 'listed', 'above', 'created', 'memorable', 'musical', 'sound', 'track', 'Charlie', 'Parker', 'genius.Charlie', 'Parker', 'died', 'March', '1955', 'aged', '34', 'doctor', 'calling', 'coroner', 'scene', 'death', 'described', '65-year-old', 'male', 'Bird', 'was', 'drug', 'addict', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'had', 'bleeding', 'ulcers', 'cirrhosis', 'liver', 'weak', 'heart', 'least', 'twice', 'had', 'tried', 'suicide', 'drinking', 'iodine', 'Several', 'times', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'drug', 'usage', 'lost', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'lounge', 'card', 'playing', 'jazz', 'had', 'go', 'West', 'Coast', 'join', 'Dizzy', 'Gillespie', 'where', 'lounge', 'card', 'was', 'not', 'required', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'helped', 'spread', 'bebop', 'California', 'introduce', 'other', 'audiences', 'other', 'NYC', 'fantastical', 'sensitive', 'miraculous', 'way', 'playing.Was', 'sensitivity', 'made', 'so', 'inept', 'handling', 'down', 'times', 'life', 'When', 'little', 'daughter', 'died', 'went', 'back', 'drugs', 'having', 'been', 'clean', 'number', 'years', 'having', 'also', 'time', 'increased', 'alcohol', 'intake.Bird', 'died', 'young', 'verge', 'rock', 'roll', 'surge', 'waning', 'bebop', 'other', 'great', 'jazz', 'performers', 'managed', 'survive', 'time', 'such', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'Dizzy', 'Gillespie', 'many', 'great', 'could', 'be', 'Bird', 'died', 'time', 'verge', 'changes', 'musical', 'taste.The', 'movie', 'strong', 'performances', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Bird', 'Diane', 'Verona', 'Bird', 'wife', 'Chan', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Zelniker', 'fellow', 'musician', 'friend', 'Red', 'Rodney.It', 'won', 'several', 'international', 'awards', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Sound', 'soundtrack.Whatever', 'Clint', 'defects', 'first', 'directorial', 'job', 'given', 'stunning', 'lasting', 'portrait', 'Charlie', '34', 'Bird', '34', 'Parker', 'one', 'greatest', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'time']",N/A

Parker himself, however, rates all the stars we have available, and Forest Whitaker does a more than capable job of evoking one of greatest musicians this country has produced. Director Clint Eastwood choses to try to tell Parker's tragic story through his relationship with one of his wives, Chan (an also good Diane Venora).

Others have claimed that the film was meant to be dark because of its subject matter.  Well, to say that this DVD is a little dark in some scenes is a gross undersatement.  It is so dark that you cannot see any of the people in these scenes.  I have the laserdisc of the film and it is no where near as dark as this DVD.  This DVD needed to be recalled!!  It is a joke and I am going to try and get a refund because the whole master needs to be re-done.  The ""remastered 5.1 sound"" is also a joke.  Although it sounds good, the sound on the laserdisc is vastly superior.  I was anxiosly awaiting this disc because the laser is not in widescreen, but the trade-off is not worth it.Up-date: I have just viewed both DVD and Laser simultaneously on my fairly new Samsung LCD HD TV and they actually both look the same.  Since the last time I watched my laserdisc copy was on my previous TV, which was a standard set, the overly dark picture seems to be related to the inability of LCD TVs to reproduce detail in extreme shadow areas.

565315,A3JEV3M4L5R2OL,B000053V7P,T. S. C.,"[1, 1]","I've seen this movie a few times now. For me it is a great film because it is about someone who helped shape the future of popular culture in America, and so hence the rest of the world. Charlie Parker was his name, but the world remembers him simply as 'Bird', which is also simply the title of the film.Many of my heroes are African Americans because we should never forget that popular music for the most part and the popular culture that was conceived in the United States largely has its roots in African-American culture, history and experience. The Blues, Jazz, Soul, Funk, Rhythm & Blues and many other forms of popular music really come out of the African-American experience and their originality and creativity and their different take on life from the dominant mainstream White culture of America.The 60's is well remembered by millions of people, and the happenings and films and music and art and photography of that deeply exciting era are still celebrated today all over the world. The 50's by contrast seem rather neglected, but it was the 50's, particularly in the United States of America, that really saw the birth of one kind of popular culture, which was Rock and Roll and all that went with that, the fast life, more egalitarianism, an eroding of race differences, fast food and that whole 'want-it-yesterday' sort of society that really could have only been born in America. Again, the music of the underclass, primarily African-American, would come to dominate American popular culture, even if the first greatest proponent of it was a poor White boy called Elvis.Bird was the forerunner of other improvisational musicians like Jimi Hendrix, Peter Green and Eric Clapton, to name but three, who would shine in the next decade, those wonderful, heady, exciting, world-shattering 60's. Bird's playing was seat-of-the-pants and thrilling and exciting, much like the later guitar heroes of the 60's and he stands out from many of the great Jazz men of his era. His music is for me eternally nostalgic and yet fresh as the day it was made-it makes me feel good and just glad to be alive. His music hasn't dated, whereas someone like Herb Alpert, as great as he was, seems dated now.America has always had two themes running through it; one was that a person should be virtuous, clean living and godly; the other was that you should find your pleasures where you could, be hard living, hard drinking and a fast living kind of person always looking for the next exciting thing to come along. Bird fits into the last category; his America is the underbelly, the rootless, the fast living kind, the kind that is most interesting. I say this as a Christian who doesn't take illegal drugs and lives moderately and drinks alcohol in moderation too! But you get my point; Bird is part of that American dream, that freedom, that raw excitement that America seems to have and certainly the 1950's America had in aces. The freedom of the open road, the freedom of going where you please, the freedom of free-form Jazz with those powerful improvised solos and the wonder of America with it's long straight roads, and lonely town and villages, and big dirty dangerous and downright wonderful big cities filled with every kind of person on the make and all looking for something that will thrill them and give some meaning to their lives, and the forests and coasts and all that America had to offer; Bird's music encompasses all this and more; he wasn't the only one but he was one of the greatest exponents of explaining the freedom of America in an art-form that was originally and uniquely American, and African-American at that.",5,Really good biopic of a culturally important musician,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,3639,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'great', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'helped', 'shape', 'future', 'popular', 'culture', 'America', 'so', 'hence', 'rest', 'world', 'Charlie', 'Parker', 'was', 'name', 'world', 'simply', ""'Bird"", 'also', 'simply', 'title', 'film.Many', 'heroes', 'are', 'African', 'Americans', 'should', 'never', 'forget', 'popular', 'music', 'most', 'part', 'popular', 'culture', 'was', 'conceived', 'United', 'States', 'largely', 'roots', 'African-American', 'culture', 'history', 'experience', 'Blues', 'Jazz', 'Soul', 'Funk', 'Rhythm', 'Blues', 'many', 'other', 'forms', 'popular', 'music', 'really', 'come', 'African-American', 'experience', 'originality', 'creativity', 'different', 'take', 'life', 'dominant', 'mainstream', 'White', 'culture', 'America.The', '60', 'well', 'remembered', 'millions', 'people', 'happenings', 'films', 'music', 'art', 'photography', 'deeply', 'exciting', 'era', 'are', 'still', 'celebrated', 'today', 'world', '50', 'contrast', 'seem', 'rather', 'neglected', 'was', '50', 'particularly', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'really', 'saw', 'birth', 'one', 'kind', 'popular', 'culture', 'was', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'went', 'fast', 'life', 'more', 'egalitarianism', 'eroding', 'race', 'differences', 'fast', 'food', 'whole', ""'want-it-yesterday"", 'sort', 'society', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'born', 'America', 'Again', 'music', 'underclass', 'primarily', 'African-American', 'would', 'come', 'dominate', 'American', 'popular', 'culture', 'even', 'first', 'greatest', 'proponent', 'was', 'poor', 'White', 'boy', 'called', 'Elvis.Bird', 'was', 'forerunner', 'other', 'improvisational', 'musicians', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Peter', 'Green', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'name', 'three', 'who', 'would', 'shine', 'next', 'decade', 'wonderful', 'heady', 'exciting', 'world-shattering', '60', 'Bird', 'playing', 'was', 'seat-of-the-pants', 'thrilling', 'exciting', 'much', 'later', 'guitar', 'heroes', '60', 'out', 'many', 'great', 'Jazz', 'men', 'era', 'music', 'eternally', 'nostalgic', 'yet', 'fresh', 'day', 'was', 'made-it', 'feel', 'good', 'just', 'glad', 'be', 'alive', 'music', ""n't"", 'dated', 'someone', 'Herb', 'Alpert', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'dated', 'now.America', 'always', 'had', 'two', 'themes', 'running', 'one', 'was', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'virtuous', 'clean', 'living', 'godly', 'other', 'was', 'should', 'find', 'pleasures', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'hard', 'living', 'hard', 'drinking', 'fast', 'living', 'kind', 'person', 'always', 'looking', 'next', 'exciting', 'thing', 'come', 'along', 'Bird', 'last', 'category', 'America', 'underbelly', 'rootless', 'fast', 'living', 'kind', 'kind', 'most', 'interesting', 'say', 'Christian', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'moderately', 'drinks', 'alcohol', 'moderation', 'too', 'get', 'point', 'Bird', 'part', 'American', 'dream', 'freedom', 'raw', 'excitement', 'America', 'have', 'certainly', '1950', 'America', 'had', 'aces', 'freedom', 'open', 'road', 'freedom', 'going', 'where', 'please', 'freedom', 'free-form', 'Jazz', 'powerful', 'improvised', 'solos', 'wonder', 'America', 'long', 'straight', 'roads', 'lonely', 'town', 'villages', 'big', 'dirty', 'dangerous', 'downright', 'wonderful', 'big', 'cities', 'filled', 'kind', 'person', 'make', 'looking', 'something', 'will', 'thrill', 'give', 'meaning', 'lives', 'forests', 'coasts', 'America', 'had', 'offer', 'Bird', 'music', 'more', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'exponents', 'explaining', 'freedom', 'America', 'art-form', 'was', 'originally', 'uniquely', 'American', 'African-American']",N/A
565316,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,B000053V7P,Unlucky Frank,"[140, 144]","Wow, I can't believe the negative reviews for this MASTERPIECE by Clint Eastwood. Being a big fan of Jazz, I've owned this film for many years in more than one incarnation, and have watched it more times than I care to tally.Many reviewers said it's overly dark. Yep. Jazz musicians spend most of their time in dark smoke-filled nightclubs. So does BIRD. This is a great MOOD PIECE. It could also be called FILM NOIR.Many said it doesn't establish why Charlie Parker was one of the greats of Jazz. In one particularly brilliant scene of writing in this film, Parker is talking about himself and the legend of BIRD to Red Rodney, partner in Jazz and fellow heroin addict. He talks about &quot;going inside the melody&quot; of Cherokee, a song he had played many times and was tired of doing. Parker decides to go around the melody with little notes and discovers his style. Thus, a whole new form of music called Be Bop is born. A superb scene.Many reviewers said it dwelt too heavily on the negative aspects of Parker's drug abuse. This is true. However, heroin played a significant part in early Jazz music in this country. Heavily significant. A majority of the best and brightest Jazz stars were plagued by addiction for many years. Read Miles Davis' autobiography. He lists them all. Eastwood recognizes this in a scene where Parker is in Paris and is debating whether to return to the States. A fellow sideman is trying convince him to stay in France where he can make a decent living. SIDEMAN: &quot;You can't make no living playing Jazz in the States.&quot; BIRD: &quot;Dizz can. Duke can.&quot; SIDEMAN: &quot;Well you ain't Dizz. And you certainly ain't Duke.&quot; BIRD: &quot;So I kick.&quot; The Sideman laughs uproariously. BIRD: &quot;I can kick.&quot; The Sideman laughs harder. The point of this exchange: the only successful Jazzmen are Duke and Dizzy because they may be the only ones not hooked on heroin. Subtle writing. A brilliant exchange that conveys so much about the world of Jazz. For some Jazz musicians, heroin was used in a creative context whether people will admit that or not. And drug and alcohol abuse DID kill Charlie Parker. Artists can be extremely self-destructive human beings.Some said it wasn't accurate. Many film biopics use composite characters for dramatic effect and change some history for storytelling purposes. Films can't possibly contain a person's whole history. It's not possible. But BIRD conveys Parker's fame and troubles with amazing grace and skill.Yes, BIRD is dark and depressing. It is also a brilliantly realized ART FILM. However, the timeline can be very confusing. I screened this for a friend, who was lost in the flashbacks. He did however, enjoy the film.Another thing I love about the script, is that it portrays Charlie Parker as an articulate and eloquent man, as many Jazz musicians were at the time and still are. (Wynton Marsalis comes to mind.) Even in &quot;the midst of my disorientation,&quot; Parker remains articulate. One of my favorite lines of dialogue is when Parker is waking up on the floor after passing out in a wealthy patron's house. She explains to him that he has passed out, and Parker retorts from the floor, &quot;Very undignified of me.&quot; BEAUTIFUL WRITING.I just had to chime in, because this film is an overlooked TREASURE. Forest Whitaker gives us probably the most amazing death scene I've ever witnessed on film. He should have won the Oscar for his performance. It was shamefully overlooked. Diane Venora is superb as are the rest of the cast. And as for Clint Eastwood; this is without a doubt, HIS BEST FILM. And one of my all time favorite flicks. Thanks Clint, for giving me many hours of enjoyment, and taking me back to a time I wish I had lived through, with this WORK OF ART.
