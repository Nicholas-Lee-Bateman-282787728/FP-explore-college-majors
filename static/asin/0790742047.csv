109778,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,0790742047,AC,"[5, 5]","I read several reviews before deciding to acquire a DVD of this movie, and subsequently watched it today.  I thought I'd add a few of my impressions, as a kind of 'addendum' to the many reviews which have conveyed the gist of the film.Something which stunned me, in viewing this film, was the performance by Rosie Perez -- I've long considered her to be a relatively underrated, and underappreciated actress, but her performance in ""Fearless"" is astonishing -- and in simply revisiting an online reference (just minutes ago), to take a peek at the list of films she's appeared in, I saw in the summary that she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in this film (and deservedly so, in my opinion) (it turned out to be the year that Anna Paquin had been nominated (and won) for ""The Piano"").There are some scenes in various films which leave me spellbound in my respect for and wonder as to how a particular actor was able to summon the relevant whatever-it-is that resulted in their portraying the powerful (and in this case, heartbreaking) emotional and believable physical expressions associated with a specific riveting scene -- and one such scene, in particular, in this movie, and from Rosie Perez, left me in awe of the emotional depth -- and complex combination of pain, grief, regret, sorrow, and tortured guilt -- that she was capable of portraying.  Honestly, it was one of the most achingly sad moments I've ever seen portrayed on film (and it 'locked' me in, and kept me motionless, while I found myself increasingly stunned by the artistic greatness I was 'witnessing').  I absolutely agree with the reviewer who conveyed that Rosie Perez was ""a revelation"" in this film.Something else I was struck by was something not always seen in films, and which is difficult to pull off 'convincingly', and involves someone 'letting go' of someone they have a deep, platonic relationship with, and who they want desperately to keep close in their life, and with whom the feeling is mutual, but knowing that 'severing' the relationship so that the person they're 'letting go' of can 'move forward' (and in this case, with grief, and with their life).  There is difficult-to-describe subtlety associated with the convincing portrayal of such in this film, and represents, in my opinion, another of the superbly acted scenes, and is one of the several hits-you-in-the-heart moments.Another thing that was deftly 'introduced' throughout the film was how, over time, someone who has experienced a death-defying trauma, let alone one which involved many people and included elements of chaos, can evolve (and for some, devolve) in the maelstrom of shock, grief, survivor guilt, and suddenly and stunningly shifted perspective -- and how the memories associated with the event can involve partially as well as initially-misremembered elements, and how the mind can gradually 'reveal' more of the actual event, as one becomes more capable of 'handling' such.Also, the film serves as a reminder that various survivors of a group-experienced trauma -- and regardless of how different their respective individual experiences might have been -- can be 'bound' to one another from that point on, and in ways that perhaps none of them quite understand, but which they 'recognize' nonetheless, and can find comfort in simply being around one another -- and at times, at the expense of those who had otherwise/previously 'been' the focus of their life.All in all, this was a very interesting film, and involved somewhat of a range of logical and believably 'altered' aspects of being if/when in the wake of complex trauma.  It also serves as a reminder to not take life for granted, and to appreciate the myriad wonder and beauty associated with life...",5,"The impressions I was left with, just hours after watching this film",1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,3757,"['read', 'several', 'reviews', 'deciding', 'acquire', 'DVD', 'movie', 'subsequently', 'watched', 'today', 'thought', ""'d"", 'add', 'few', 'impressions', 'kind', ""'addendum"", 'many', 'reviews', 'have', 'conveyed', 'gist', 'film.Something', 'stunned', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'performance', 'Rosie', 'Perez', ""'ve"", 'long', 'considered', 'be', 'relatively', 'underrated', 'underappreciated', 'actress', 'performance', 'Fearless', 'astonishing', 'simply', 'revisiting', 'online', 'reference', 'just', 'minutes', 'ago', 'take', 'peek', 'list', 'films', 'appeared', 'saw', 'summary', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'film', 'deservedly', 'so', 'opinion', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'year', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'had', 'been', 'nominated', 'won', 'Piano', 'are', 'scenes', 'various', 'films', 'leave', 'spellbound', 'respect', 'wonder', 'how', 'particular', 'actor', 'was', 'able', 'summon', 'relevant', 'whatever-it-is', 'resulted', 'portraying', 'powerful', 'case', 'heartbreaking', 'emotional', 'believable', 'physical', 'expressions', 'associated', 'specific', 'riveting', 'scene', 'one', 'such', 'scene', 'particular', 'movie', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'left', 'awe', 'emotional', 'depth', 'complex', 'combination', 'pain', 'grief', 'regret', 'sorrow', 'tortured', 'guilt', 'was', 'capable', 'portraying', 'Honestly', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'achingly', 'sad', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'portrayed', 'film', ""'locked"", 'kept', 'motionless', 'found', 'increasingly', 'stunned', 'artistic', 'greatness', 'was', ""'witnessing"", 'absolutely', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'conveyed', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'was', 'revelation', 'film.Something', 'else', 'was', 'struck', 'was', 'something', 'not', 'always', 'seen', 'films', 'difficult', 'pull', 'off', ""'convincingly"", 'someone', ""'letting"", 'go', ""'"", 'someone', 'have', 'deep', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'who', 'want', 'desperately', 'keep', 'close', 'life', 'whom', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'knowing', ""'severing"", 'relationship', 'person', ""'re"", ""'letting"", 'go', ""'"", 'can', ""'move"", 'forward', 'case', 'grief', 'life', 'difficult-to-describe', 'subtlety', 'associated', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'such', 'film', 'opinion', 'superbly', 'acted', 'scenes', 'one', 'several', 'hits-you-in-the-heart', 'moments.Another', 'thing', 'was', 'deftly', ""'introduced"", 'film', 'was', 'how', 'time', 'someone', 'who', 'experienced', 'death-defying', 'trauma', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'involved', 'many', 'people', 'included', 'elements', 'chaos', 'can', 'evolve', 'devolve', 'maelstrom', 'shock', 'grief', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'suddenly', 'stunningly', 'shifted', 'perspective', 'how', 'memories', 'associated', 'event', 'can', 'involve', 'partially', 'as', 'well', 'initially-misremembered', 'elements', 'how', 'mind', 'can', 'gradually', ""'reveal"", 'more', 'actual', 'event', 'one', 'more', 'capable', ""'handling"", 'such.Also', 'film', 'reminder', 'various', 'survivors', 'group-experienced', 'trauma', 'regardless', 'how', 'different', 'respective', 'individual', 'experiences', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'can', 'be', ""'bound"", 'one', 'point', 'ways', 'perhaps', 'none', 'quite', 'understand', ""'recognize"", 'nonetheless', 'can', 'find', 'comfort', 'simply', 'being', 'one', 'times', 'expense', 'who', 'had', 'otherwise/previously', ""'been"", 'focus', 'life.All', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'involved', 'somewhat', 'range', 'logical', 'believably', ""'altered"", 'aspects', 'being', 'if/when', 'wake', 'complex', 'trauma', 'also', 'reminder', 'not', 'take', 'life', 'granted', 'appreciate', 'myriad', 'wonder', 'beauty', 'associated', 'life']",N/A
109779,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790742047,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","It is rare to find a film that deals with such deeply affected moments and themes that doesn't try and overcompensate by thrusting overwrought dramatic moments at us left and right.  It is rare to see a film tackle such complex emotions without wearing every one of them on its sleeve.  Yes, there are tense moments and there are emotional outbursts and breakdowns and yet there is not a false note here, not a moment that feels overdone for the sake of `emoting'.`Fearless' tells the story of Max Klein, a man who stares his own death in the face as the plane he is on is hurtled towards the ground.  Internally grounded, Max offers assistance to the other passengers, helping them to relax into the situation, and then after he survives the crash he lends a helping hand to those escaping the craft.  Despite his seeming levelheadedness, Max's life is forever changed by the situation and this seeps into his home life as he tries to get back into the swing of things.  He alienates his wife and begins to draw ever closer to a fellow survivor, Carla, who is suffering emotional distress over the loss of her infant son.Peter Weir directs this film with a restraint that I find so becoming.  He completely understands how to sell the film without overselling it.  He pulls back in all the right moments (the film possesses an eerie sense of quiet) and then allows his actors, especially the Oscar nominated Rosie Perez, to explore the more dramatic scope of their character's suffering.  At the end of the day, `Fearless' is an astute observation on the effect certain events can have on our lives.  From a subliminal standpoint, Max is racked with a feeling is doesn't understand and it manifests itself in isolating ways.  The cast is exceptional here, with Bridges perfecting his take on the emotionally distraught and Isabella Rossellini doing some of her best work as Max's wife.Highly recommended for anyone seeking out a film that goes for the realistic over the obvious.",5,Fear is not a choice...,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,1980,"['rare', 'find', 'film', 'such', 'deeply', 'affected', 'moments', 'themes', ""n't"", 'try', 'overcompensate', 'thrusting', 'overwrought', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'left', 'right', 'rare', 'see', 'film', 'tackle', 'such', 'complex', 'emotions', 'wearing', 'one', 'sleeve', 'Yes', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'are', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'breakdowns', 'yet', 'not', 'false', 'note', 'here', 'not', 'moment', 'overdone', 'sake', ""emoting'."", 'Fearless', 'story', 'Max', 'Klein', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'death', 'face', 'plane', 'hurtled', 'ground', 'Internally', 'grounded', 'Max', 'assistance', 'other', 'passengers', 'helping', 'relax', 'situation', 'then', 'crash', 'helping', 'hand', 'escaping', 'craft', 'seeming', 'levelheadedness', 'Max', 'life', 'forever', 'changed', 'situation', 'home', 'life', 'get', 'back', 'swing', 'things', 'wife', 'draw', 'ever', 'closer', 'fellow', 'survivor', 'Carla', 'who', 'suffering', 'emotional', 'distress', 'loss', 'infant', 'son.Peter', 'Weir', 'film', 'restraint', 'find', 'so', 'becoming', 'completely', 'how', 'sell', 'film', 'overselling', 'back', 'right', 'moments', 'film', 'eerie', 'sense', 'quiet', 'then', 'actors', 'especially', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'explore', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scope', 'character', 'suffering', 'end', 'day', 'Fearless', 'astute', 'observation', 'effect', 'certain', 'events', 'can', 'have', 'lives', 'subliminal', 'standpoint', 'Max', 'racked', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'understand', 'isolating', 'ways', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'here', 'Bridges', 'perfecting', 'take', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'doing', 'best', 'work', 'Max', 'wife.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'out', 'film', 'realistic', 'obvious']",N/A
109780,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0790742047,Anthony Hinde,"[3, 7]","It's another little known film folks. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I was one of the few who sought this film out in Australia. &quot;Fearless&quot; was only showing in one cinema in Sydney and then only for two weeks. It  was such a pity, since this is a movie that anyone should enjoy. It is also  one to make you think.Basically the story of a plane crash  survivor coping with the trauma, &quot;Fearless&quot; goes way beyond just  that. It shows some of the many  tricks the mind can play on all of us. It  deals with priorities in life, family, children, friendships. We see how  mercenary the legal system can be. How does psychology approach near death  experiences and what about the family of those that have had them. In short  this film covers more than its fair share of big hitting issues.Jeff Bridges plays Max Klein, the central character who goes  through the crash and not only lives but is acclaimed as a hero after  leading many of the other survivors to safety. It is his life that the film  mainly deals with. He becomes detached from his past life, convinced that  he can not die but at the same time he takes no pleasure in the things that  he has or has achieved. His family can not seem to reach him and the only  person he can really interact with is a fellow survivor, Carla Rodrigo,  played by Rosie Perez. She is suffering greatly due to the loss of her baby  and no longer wants to live.Whilst Max seems quite successful at  helping Carla he is powerless to help himself. The Psychiatrist Dr. Bill  Perlman, played by John  Turturro, is also unable to help Max, who treats  him with disdain. As well, Max is drawn into the legal battle to gain  compensation from the airline for himself and his best friend, who died in  the crash. Brillstein, the lawyer played by Tom Hulce, is wonderful as an  amoral man who feels some guilt over the behaviour that his profession  forces on him whilst at the same time he feels he must defend his  questionable tactics in order to get the best deal for his clients and  incidentally, himself.In the end, Max has to be saved by his  loving but frustrated wife Laura, played by Isabella Rossellini, (the  Daughter of Ingrid Bergman). When Max suffers a deadly allergic reaction to  a strawberry which he deliberately eats, we are treated to a flashback  which shows the plane crash from his point of view, in its entirety. It is  a masterly job of special effects which makes your jaw drop. Laura  resuscitates Max and brings him back to his real life from the limbo he had  been living in.",4,"Do you really survive, even if you walk from a plane crash?",957744000,"05 8, 2000",2000,2557,"['little', 'known', 'film', 'folks', 'am', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'sought', 'film', 'out', 'Australia', 'quot', 'Fearless', 'quot', 'was', 'only', 'showing', 'one', 'cinema', 'Sydney', 'then', 'only', 'two', 'weeks', 'was', 'such', 'pity', 'movie', 'anyone', 'should', 'enjoy', 'also', 'one', 'make', 'think.Basically', 'story', 'plane', 'crash', 'survivor', 'coping', 'trauma', 'quot', 'Fearless', 'quot', 'way', 'just', 'many', 'tricks', 'mind', 'can', 'play', 'priorities', 'life', 'family', 'children', 'friendships', 'see', 'how', 'mercenary', 'legal', 'system', 'can', 'be', 'How', 'psychology', 'approach', 'death', 'experiences', 'what', 'family', 'have', 'had', 'short', 'film', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'big', 'hitting', 'issues.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Max', 'Klein', 'central', 'character', 'who', 'crash', 'not', 'only', 'acclaimed', 'hero', 'leading', 'many', 'other', 'survivors', 'safety', 'life', 'film', 'mainly', 'detached', 'past', 'life', 'convinced', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'same', 'time', 'pleasure', 'things', 'achieved', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'reach', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'really', 'interact', 'fellow', 'survivor', 'Carla', 'Rodrigo', 'played', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'suffering', 'greatly', 'due', 'loss', 'baby', 'longer', 'live.Whilst', 'Max', 'quite', 'successful', 'helping', 'Carla', 'powerless', 'help', 'Psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'Perlman', 'played', 'John', 'Turturro', 'also', 'unable', 'help', 'Max', 'who', 'disdain', 'well', 'Max', 'drawn', 'legal', 'battle', 'gain', 'compensation', 'airline', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'died', 'crash', 'Brillstein', 'lawyer', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'wonderful', 'amoral', 'man', 'who', 'guilt', 'behaviour', 'profession', 'forces', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'must', 'defend', 'questionable', 'tactics', 'order', 'get', 'best', 'deal', 'clients', 'incidentally', 'himself.In', 'end', 'Max', 'be', 'saved', 'loving', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'Laura', 'played', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Daughter', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'When', 'Max', 'deadly', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'strawberry', 'deliberately', 'are', 'treated', 'flashback', 'plane', 'crash', 'point', 'view', 'entirety', 'masterly', 'job', 'special', 'effects', 'jaw', 'drop', 'Laura', 'Max', 'back', 'real', 'life', 'limbo', 'had', 'been', 'living']",N/A

His works are always deep and thoughtful and this one is not an exception. I guess you are familiar with the plot and what I have to say that it's rather slow and... motionless. I understand this kind of story doesn't have to be some other way BUT then it's not a usual type of film you'd rent or buy to kill time on Sunday evening. Food for thought - yes, but be aware of it and don't expect entertainment. If you are aware then you'll like it 'cos it's really meaningful. It has a message that practically all Weir's movies have. But I won't give away anything from the story.So to sum it all up I'd say ""Fearless"" is a deep and serious work of art and like most of them it's a bit dull.

Emotionally deep, flawlessly directed and acted, without a false note throughout.Jeff Bridges is (as always) excellent as a man who has undergone a transcendent experience so profound he cannot find his way back to his real life and world.  Rosie Perez is not always my favorite actress, but here she is deeply moving as the guilt-racked, nearly destroyed mother of a dead child.  The interplay between these two as they relate to each other and cannot relate to their families is told simply and eloquently, building to a shattering emotional climax.Throw in terrific supporting performances by Isobella Rosselini as Bridge's loving wife who wants to reach him but cannot find the key to understanding his experience, Tom Hulce as a weasel lawyer, Benecio Torres as Rosie's husband who sees no harm in getting money for the tragedy and you have a full cast of three dimensional characters.Oh, and there is a frightening plane crash that is grippingly done.First rate in all departments, I originally thought this DVD needed to be in widescreen, but I have been advised that Pan and Scan is not used, and what you get is pretty much the movie as it was presented in the theatre.

109793,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0790742047,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 4]","Truly one of the most criminally underrated films of the last decade is filmmaker Peter Weir's 1993 meditation on fear and death. Adapted by Rafael Yglesias based on his own novel, the compelling story focuses on a San Francisco architect named Max Klein, who in the film's gripping opening scenes, has survived the devastating crash of a commercial airliner. Seemingly dazed, he walks away from the scene only to be forced to come back to his family. Weir treats the movie like an unraveling mystery as Max develops an eerie sense of invulnerability defying death with no regrets. His wife Laura gets frustrated with Max's remote behavior, while an airline therapist connects him with fellow survivor Carla, a young mother traumatized by the loss of her baby in the crash. Because of their shared experience, Max and Carla bond in ways that liberate both of them but not in directions one would expect, including an architectural tour of Oakland, California and a scary reenactment of the crash in a speeding vehicle.Despite its relentlessly downbeat tone, it is the concurrent unpredictability and almost centrifugal thrust of the plot that make the film resonate. Jeff Bridges gives a bravely unsympathetic performance as Max, as he challenges the other characters (as well as the viewer) to empathize with his character's stoic, often inexplicable actions.  Just as good is Rosie Perez, who is heart wrenching as Carla, as she by default becomes the emotional heart of the film. Isabella Rossellini does what she can in the underwritten part of Laura, though her character comes across at times as too strident given the situation. Making impressions in smaller roles are John Turturro as the unctuous airline therapist, Tom Hulce as a smarmy lawyer and Benicio Del Toro as Carla's clueless husband. Allen Daviau's striking cinematography and Maurice Jarre's otherworldly music (with a nice use of U2's ""Where the Streets Have No Name"") contribute immeasurably to the film's potency.  I find the film has even more resonance in a post-9/11 world where such personalized traumas unfortunately have become even more commonplace.

109796,A1GVVXMVBHVP4S,0790742047,Gary Lee Morrison,"[5, 5]","This is Peter Weir's brilliant film about post-traumatic stress syndrome in the survivors of a fatal plane crash. The continually under-rated Jeff Bridges gives a powerful performance as Max, a survivor locked in another dimension, helping others triumph over their PTSS but not acknowledging his own which impacts on his relationship with his wife (Isabella in a powerful performance as devoted but helpless and confused wife), his family, friends, professional life. His devotion to another survivor (a superb performance from Rosie Perez) leads to near disastrous consequences. The climax sees Max going under, reliving the trauma, wheezing, dying, and brought back from the brink by his wife - all to the powerful, haunting strains of Henri Gorecki's Symphony No. 3. This underscores the themes of love, tragedy and trauma, death, loss, the pain of the walking wounded and throughout the score by Maurice Jarre, excerpts from Penderecki's Polymorphia and the Kronos Quartet's Pieces of Africa add to the Gorecki masterwork to give a depth, sensitivity, and power to ""Fearless"" that raises it above the ordinary. What viewer could not well up with the falling, pathetic Max reaching out desperately to his wife and asking her to save him.

Rosie PEREZ (not Flores) is gripping in an Oscar-nominated performance that shakes you to the core.  Jeff Bridges, one of the great actors of our generation gives his finest performance in a role that demands his soul, and a deep connection to a spirit, few actors can convincingly pull off. His achievement - pure and simple- is an ability to make each film viewer actually inhabit his skin..even for a moment.  All of us can relate to the man and the tremendous lessons he learns throughout.  We all cheer him in his victory over death, and yet, fear him when he challenges his God to push him over a ledge.  Quite simply this is a keeper - a film of extraordinary depth and passion that holds up as a lesson n life, and at the same time, a character study of two deeply traumatized survivors.

It deals with range of emotions, from immense pain after loss of a loved one to the total impact of surviving  fatal accident.Max and Karla are both survivors of a plain crash. Max loses his best friend, Karla her son. Although Max walks out of the crash physically unhurt, he believes that he's dead. Strangely enough, this enables him to explore his adventurous side, to become more spontaneous, to feel invincible and to experience an ""overwhelming"" love for Carla. The pair develop beautiful friendship, helping each other deal with their issues.The great performances of Jeff Bridges who plays Max and Rosie Perez/Karla make this film truly unforgettable.  There is a scene in the movie  that left  me shattered. Carla bursts in tears, as she  blames herself for the death of her child. Her emotional torment is beyond belief! In order to save her form the destructive power of  her intolerable guilt feelings, Max crashes his car into a brick wall. He puts Carla on the back seat, buckles her up, makes her  hold the tool box and imagine that this is her baby, starts the car and drives with full speed into the wall. This is a mind-blowing  scene,charged with powerful emotions! Both actors are brilliant and the song ""Where The Streets Have No Names"" complements perfectly their stunning  performances!

It is one of those films that one finishes watching, and then walks back out into the sunlight (or the night) almost completely unaware of their surroundings, as you carry the world of the film with you for a long time, and then slowly re-enter your own life. For me, it was a life-changing experience, and ever since it was first released, it's been on my top 10 list permanently.Regarding the DVD, here's the best info I have: I went to a lecture about a year ago (approximately?) by the film's cinematographer Alan Daviau. He showed his own personal print of the film, which SHINED -- and was projected in 1.85. When questioned by me and others about the pathetic dvd available, he told us he was in the next couple of weeks, going to supervise a new transfer, and that a new DVD would be released soon that would do the film justice. Well, we're still waiting -- but for those of you who, like me, are literally offended by the quality (wrong aspect ratio, bad transfer, bad sound) of the existing DVD -- hopefully, there's hope!

109807,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0790742047,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","When we first meet Max Klein (Jeff Bridges), he is a different man from whom he was only a few minutes earlier in his life.  That is because the first time we see Max he is walking out of a corn field, holding a baby and leading a young boy along with some adults out of a California cornfield.  All of these people have just survived a plane crash and while others are in shock or distraught over what has just happened Max has a calm serenity that makes him stand apart from the crowd.  Just how far removed Max is from his fellow human beings starts to become clear when he just walks away from the crash site and finds a motel to check into for the night.  Eventually the authorities show up and start wondering why Max is not acting like a guy who was just in a plane crash.  When finally asked the obvious question as to why he did not call his family to say he was alive, Max calmly replies that he thought he was dead.  Still being alive is clearly something Max is going to have to get used to.Early on ""Fearless"" plays with the idea that Max is indestructible.  After all, if he can walk away from a plane crash without a scratch then walking through traffic or eating strawberries without having a severe allergic reaction is no longer going to be a problem.  But that is not really the point of what has happened to Max and the people in his life cannot understand what has happened to him either.  Once his wife, Laura (Isabella Rossellini) gets over the fact he is still alive she finds herself living with a stranger.  The airlines sends a psychiatrist (John Turturro) to help him adjust and a lawyer (Tom Hulce) has also arrived to help both Max and the widow (Deirdre O'Conell) of his partner (John de Lancie), who was killed in the crash, make big money on the tragedy.  The problem is that Max does not seem inclined to play along and say the right thing or provide the details that would translate into even bigger bucks.The boy (Daniel Cerny) who walked out of the cornfield with Max has been coming around to visit and Max's son, Jonah (Spencer Vrooman) resents the idea that he is somehow being replaced.  But Laura has the same fears when Max starts hanging out with Carl Rodrigo (Rosie Perez), another survivor who lost him infant son in the crash.  Max is the one person that she seems to be able to talk to and he seems to be content to continuing helping people, whether they are fellow crash survivors or not.  In a lesser film, a ""Random Hearts"" for example, tragedy would make such people from different worlds lovers, but that is not what the bond between these characters is all about.  Even Laura, hurt and confused by what this experience has done to her marriage, does not make the mistake of thinking that the relationship is sexual, although that does nothing to reduce the pain of being shutout of what is happening.The screenplay for ""Fearless"" is by Rafael Yglesias, based on his novel, but director Peter Weir is clearly trying to turn this story into something larger.  I do not think that the end result is as profound as the director intended, simply because it is hard to imagine getting to Max's point in the universe without having gone through the crucible of the plane crash.  Actually, that point is a bit off the mark because eventually we get to see what happened as the plane was going down and Max's transformation happens before the point of impact.  In fact, it happens at the moment that he accepts this is the moment of his death rather than when he finds Fate has managed to postpone that inevitable destiny.  On the one hand that is the point where our identification with Max becomes more manageable, but it comes so late in the film that rethinking what has happened so that it might serve as an object lesson for our own life is a bit difficult.Bridges is perfectly cast as Max, because he has always had that ability to look at people with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye that made it clear he saw through you and whatever you were trying to sell.  Max gives that look to the psychiatrist and the lawyer on several occasions, but he also has several other looks that provide glimpses as to what is going on in his mind as he tries to reconcile the world in which he lives with the new perspective that is in his mind.  Perez is equally as good as the woman walking on the edge, holding it together until the point where she finally cracks and admits the great guilt she bears for more than simply walking away from the crash that killed her son.  Rossellini is hampered by the fact that her character is required to be helpless for most of the picture and Hulce is required to be a typical immoral lawyer from start to finish and it is not just his performance but his character that is at odds with the rest of the film.  I thought Turturro's character was going to be just as big of a joke, but he has a session with crash survivors in which he proves himself to be more than competent, even if he is not operating on the same wave length as Max.Even if this is not as profound a film as it is clear Weir was trying to make it is still a very thoughtful and provocative movie.  The emotional impact on the viewer is going to depend on how well they can make the connections between Max's situation and their own lives in the real world.  Weir hired Maurice Jarre to do the score and his music provides a lot of the emotional power of the final act of the film as both Max and the audience come to terms with what it is all about.  I am not sure how you would live your life differently after watching ""Fearless,"" but it seems strange and rather sad to think that it would make no difference at all.Final Note:  It is hard to believe in this day and age that a deep film like ""Fearless"" would have no DVD extras.  There are so many DVDs are there where I do not really care what the director, writer and star have to say about the film, but that would not be the case with that one and hopefully in the future Weir and crew will do something to rectify this situation.",4,Walking away from a plane crash would change anyone's life,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,6047,"['When', 'first', 'meet', 'Max', 'Klein', 'Jeff',

Mountford,"[1, 2]","A disturbing account of a man's survival and recovery from the post-traumatic effects of a plane crash, _Fearless_ will probably never be one of my &quot;favorite&quot; films.  But it certainly raises some interesting questions.In brief, Jeff Bridges, in probably his best performance in any movie role to date, plays Max Klein, an architect who is intensely afraid of flying.  Max is traveling with his business partner from his home in San Francisco to a meeting in Houston.  Somewhere along the way something goes terribly wrong, and the plane crashes.  The film actually opens with Max leading some of the survivors to safety across a cornfield.Through a series of flashbacks, we get a sense of Max's realization during the long descent in the plane that he's not afraid anymore.  Further, he's able to calm some of the other passengers, including a little boy who is traveling alone.After the crash, Max has (somewhat predictable) trouble dealing with his family (Isabella Rosselini as his wife, Laura), with his partner's widow, the attorney involved in suing the airline (Tom Hulce), and the psychiatrist hired by the airline to counsel the survivors (John Turturro).  I mean, had he NOT had these difficulties, there wouldn't be much of a movie, would there?  His feelings of invincibility, his &quot;testing&quot; of God and fate -- all seemed almost cliche'd reactions.  That said, however, they were very well acted by Bridges.The only person he *can* relate to is Carla, a young mother who also survived the crash, who is having a lot of difficulty coping with the fact that her 2-yr-old son, who she was holding in her arms at the time of the crash, did not.  Rosie Perez gives a brilliant performance as Carla -- I was absolutely amazed at how good she is in this role.  I'd only seen her in light comedies (White Men Can't Jump; It Could Happen to You), and thought she was an &quot;OK&quot; actress.  I was totally blown away by her performance, and found it the most emotionally challenging aspect of the film.  You *can't* watch her anguish and walk away unmoved by it.Without giving away too much more of the plot, suffice it to say that Max is finally able to come to grips with his reaction to the aftermath of the crash.  The final scenes of the movie, in which the actual crash is replayed, are remarkable for their special effects.I'm giving this movie 4 stars -- it's a good movie if you're in a particular frame of mind.  It's NOT a lightweight subject, and certainly not lightweight performances by the principals.  I thought parts of it were maybe a little *too* predictable, but all in all, worth a look.

109809,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0790742047,magellan,"[1, 1]","Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors, and in this movie he gets a more unusual role than most, playing a man beset by survivor guilt after he miraculously survives a plane crash with hardly a scratch that kills all but a few of the passengers. As someone who's survived a couple of situations like this myself (although not an airplane crash) I could really relate to Jeff's character, and I think he did a fine job with the role. Weir's portrayal of how the crash unfolded using flashbacks seen through the eyes of various passengers as well as Jeff's is a truly inspirational stroke and an extremely powerful and effective device.This traumatic experience paradoxically gives Jeff a new lease on life, which he now approaches completely fearlessly--hence the title of the movie. His new devil-may- care attitude and confidence is a little too much for his wife, who desperately tries but can't really understand what Jeff's character is feeling, or his connection to Carla, who he helps to cope with the guilt of losing her child in the crash. The movie poignantly compares and examines Jeff's new-found desire to live life on the edge with the torpic attitudes of those who haven't been similarly ""awakened,"" and whether his approach is ultimately more in touch with reality than theirs. As recent events have shown, our connection to life is more precarious than we normally think as we methodically go about the mundane business of our everyday lives. But life has a way of throwing curveballs at us when we least expect it, like the lyrics in the Grateful Dead song, ""When life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door, or as Chekhov said, ""Life will sooner or later show its claws."" So who's to say whether Jeff's character is any crazier than the rest of us?Overall, this is a powerful movie from Weir on a fascinating subject which he examines without sentimentality or the usual easy answers and Hollywood cliches.",5,Surprisingly good,1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,1941,"['Jeff', 'Bridges', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'movie', 'more', 'unusual', 'role', 'most', 'playing', 'man', 'beset', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'miraculously', 'plane', 'crash', 'hardly', 'scratch', 'few', 'passengers', 'someone', 'who', 'survived', 'couple', 'situations', 'not', 'airplane', 'crash', 'could', 'really', 'relate', 'Jeff', 'character', 'think', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'role', 'Weir', 'portrayal', 'how', 'crash', 'unfolded', 'using', 'flashbacks', 'seen', 'eyes', 'various', 'passengers', 'as', 'well', 'Jeff', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'stroke', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'effective', 'device.This', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'paradoxically', 'Jeff', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'now', 'completely', 'fearlessly', 'hence', 'title', 'movie', 'new', 'devil-may-', 'care', 'attitude', 'confidence', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'wife', 'who', 'desperately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'Jeff', 'character', 'feeling', 'connection', 'Carla', 'who', 'cope', 'guilt', 'losing', 'child', 'crash', 'movie', 'poignantly', 'Jeff', 'new-found', 'desire', 'live', 'life', 'edge', 'torpic', 'attitudes', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'similarly', 'awakened', 'approach', 'ultimately', 'more', 'touch', 'reality', 'theirs', 'recent', 'events', 'have', 'shown', 'connection', 'life', 'more', 'precarious', 'normally', 'think', 'methodically', 'go', 'mundane', 'business', 'everyday', 'lives', 'life', 'way', 'throwing', 'curveballs', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'lyrics', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'song', 'When', 'life', 'easy', 'street', 'danger', 'door', 'Chekhov', 'said', 'Life', 'will', 'sooner', 'later', 'show', 'claws', 'who', 'say', 'Jeff', 'character', 'crazier', 'rest', 'Overall', 'powerful', 'movie', 'Weir', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'sentimentality', 'usual', 'easy', 'answers', 'Hollywood', 'cliches']",N/A

Bridges' performance is exceptional, perhaps his finest.  As are the performance given by Perez and Rossellini and the rest of the cast.  Weir's directing is superb and sublime.

109811,AESY8NCX6VS6O,0790742047,M. Burns,"[2, 2]","There are directors making movies of modern cinema, and then there's Peter Weir. Here's a guy who has never gotten the commercial success of Spielberg, the artistic raves of Kubrick, but equals or surpasses them on so many levels. Case in point: Fearless, another great film in a slew of great Weir films that takes a genre and doesn't necessarily break from it but explores it in unexpected ways. The subject of choice is an airplane crash, of which Max Klein (Jeff Bridges, lacking a deserved Oscar nom for this one) is one of a few dozen survivors. While many would be racked with grief (he lost his best friend and business partner), Klein experienced an epiphany of peace and bravery that carries through his experiences post-crash as well. We've seen things of this vein so many times that I thought I knew where Fearless was going, but at each end I was surprised. I expected romantic subplots and the like, but Weir holds the film with a knowing, masterful grace that he fully concentrates into the character Bridges plays.Fearless is less an exploration of grief than it is simply an intense look at the entire world of someone whose life is nearly taken. Rosie Perez receieved an Oscar nomination for her great work as a fellow survivor whom Max befriends, but the movie veers away from melodrama and woe-is-me theatrics even with them, instead showing what comfort we find among those who share our trauma. And Fearless never always seems like it's like the movie it appears to be, proof again of Weir's incredible talent of looking at a theme from another angle (what made Master and Commander an intimate character drama and not a mindless actioner). So much territory is covered in the film, yet it never seems dense, and the catharsis at the end is a payoff like none other. I found myself weeping at the film's magnificent finale - a lot - and yet the tears that Fearless elicits are not ones of sadness or happiness, but of satisfaction and pure emotional movement. It's nice to know there are directors out there who can make movies so powerful and yet never make us feel manipulated one bit.

Jeff Bridges gives a riveting performance, one of his best, in the role of Max Klein.  Before the crash, Max lived in a world like others, afraid of flying, and a victim of strawberry allergies.  He becomes a hero as he seemingly saves the lives of several other survivors; one little boy is so taken with Bridges that he continues to visit him after the traumatic experience.  Rosie Perez won an oscar nomination and deservedly so for her role as Carla, a young mother who blames herself for her little baby's death in the crash.  Isabella Rosselini, as beautiful as ever, plays Bridges wife who tries to bring him back into the real world he so seemingly willingly left behind.  Tom Hulce plays their lawyer, a good performance, one that makes you like him rather than find him repulsive.  John Turturro as a grief counselor is excellent in a small but well developed role.  Benicio del Toro merely fills the space as Perez' opportunistic husband; Deirde O'Connell as the widow of Bridges' partner is startingly effective.FEARLESS moves at a slow pace, and I found myself getting angry with Bridges for neglecting his family to help Perez.

It goes likethis:As Rosie lights a candle near the alter, she looksskyward and says, ""You know you hurt me.  You hurt meforever.  But I still believe in Him.""Jeff says, ""Well, people don't so much believe in Godas a thing than not to choose to believe in nothing.Life and death - they happen for no reason.  We thinkthat people are born because their mother's wantedthem alive...that God needed another homerun hitter forthe Giants.  We think that they die because they robme, or rob a bank.  That way, even though we can't begood enough or careful enough, we'll live forever.  Atleast we can try.  But it makes no sense if life ordeath just happens.  Then there's no reason to doanything.Rosie responds, ""Then there's no reason to love.""He asks, ""What?""She says, ""There's no reason to love.""""Fearless"" is nothing short of brilliant.  It may notbe the best film for me to see one week before I catcha plane to be with my sister and brother-in-law infrigid Spokane, Washington, but it was a passionateexpose' on human emotions, feelings and compassion.Max sets out to save the world, but we all know thatyou can't take care of everybody if you don't takecare of yourself first.This ""feel-good"" film comes with all the pieces.There's nothing missing.

Things still look the same, but they don't feel the same because I've changed radically.  I feel ALIVE!  This is a story about a crossing over from life to living.  Which is also to say that it is a story about amazing grace (or one can say an amazing story about grace - take your pick).  One truly realizes how much one is alive when one faces death.  Not the ""there but for the grace of God go I"" feeling we get as we pass a poor soul who is killed in a traffic accident on the freeway.  It's the feeling one gets when one has to really confront the ""this is it, this is my death -- now!"" reality that sends icy shivers down the back of your neck.  Only two things can happen.  You either really do die, or for some inexplicable reason you survive insurmountable odds and go on living.  But you have still transcended life because somewhere in that core of terror, you let go of life and all of your fears.  And with fear obliterated, so is prejudice.  You will gladly reach out and clutch the hand of a total stranger.  You've transcended all the pettiness in your life, and even some of the passions.  You are vitally connected to everything but simultaneously disconnected, since everyone else is on that other plateau of being alive but not fully living.  James Joyce called it an epiphany, and it is a feeling that comes with facing one's mortality head on, taking mind-altering drugs, long-term practice of meditation, great sex, listening to certain pieces of music, eating mocha hazelnut fudge ice-cream, and seeing movies like ""Fearless"".You'd think with death being so common in movies, and certainly in our lives, there would be more films about how one faces death in ways in which we can vicariously experience it with the character(s).  We all have to face it eventually.  I suppose it's 'easier' to watch death from a distance, but it's far more satisfying and therapeutic to live the experience vicariously.  Few films can achieve that narrowing of distance between audience and screen.  Peter Weir is a master of it (I actually felt as if I had disappeared in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock""!), and Jeff Bridges and the deeply underrated Rosie Perez let us fill their shoes by creating honest performances that run the gamut of every human emotion.  The score also pierces you and uplifts you.  First comes the devastation, then comes the glory.This is one film that I actually believe that everyone should see because it speaks to everyone of every race, gender, age, class and religion, and it humbles us equally.  I would be audacious enough to call it 'death therapy"", but I wouldn't want that to sound like the pedantic, 'good-for-you' movies that Hollywood usually puts out.  Think of it as ""this is your life"", only life as a looking glass, not a game show.I pray that the people who made this film love it as much as I - and apparently most of the other reviewers here - do.  If they do love it, hopefully they'll present the film in its original aspect ratio, and with lots of goodies, including commentary by the two leads and Peter Weir (and while they're at it, a quart of mocha hazelnut fudge ice cream).",5,Death be not fearful,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,3254,"['Once', 'very', 'rare', 'walk', 'movie', 'theater', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'outer', 'space', 'billion', 'light', 'years', 'Things', 'still', 'look', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'radically', 'feel', 'ALIVE', 'story', 'crossing', 'life', 'living', 'Which', 'also', 'say', 'story', 'amazing', 'grace', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'amazing', 'story', 'grace', 'take', 'pick', 'One', 'truly', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'alive', 'when', 'one', 'death', 'Not', 'grace', 'God', 'go', 'feeling', 'get', 'pass', 'poor', 'soul', 'who', 'killed', 'traffic', 'accident', 'freeway', 'feeling', 'one', 'when', 'one', 'really', 'confront', 'death', 'now', 'reality', 'icy', 'shivers', 'down', 'back', 'neck', 'Only', 'two', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'really', 'do', 'die', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'survive', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'go', 'living', 'have', 'still', 'transcended', 'life', 'somewhere', 'core', 'terror', 'let', 'go', 'life', 'fears', 'fear', 'obliterated', 'so', 'prejudice', 'will', 'gladly', 'reach', 'out', 'clutch', 'hand', 'total', 'stranger', ""'ve"", 'transcended', 'pettiness', 'life', 'even', 'passions', 'are', 'vitally', 'connected', 'everything', 'simultaneously', 'disconnected', 'everyone', 'else', 'other', 'plateau', 'being', 'alive', 'not', 'fully', 'living', 'James', 'Joyce', 'called', 'epiphany', 'feeling', 'facing', 'one', 'mortality', 'head', 'taking', 'mind-altering', 'drugs', 'long-term', 'practice', 'meditation', 'great', 'sex', 'listening', 'certain', 'pieces', 'music', 'eating', 'mocha', 'hazelnut', 'fudge', 'ice-cream', 'seeing', 'movies', 'Fearless', '.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'death', 'being', 'so', 'common', 'movies', 'certainly', 'lives', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'films', 'how', 'one', 'death', 'ways', 'can', 'vicariously', 'experience', 'character', 's', 'have', 'face', 'eventually', 'suppose', ""'easier"", 'watch', 'death', 'distance', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'therapeutic', 'live', 'experience', 'vicariously', 'Few', 'films', 'can', 'achieve', 'narrowing', 'distance', 'audience', 'screen', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'master', 'actually', 'felt', 'had', 'disappeared', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'deeply', 'underrated', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'let', 'fill', 'shoes', 'creating', 'honest', 'performances', 'run', 'gamut', 'human', 'emotion', 'score', 'also', 'uplifts', 'First', 'devastation', 'then', 'glory.This', 'one', 'film', 'actually', 'believe', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'everyone', 'race', 'gender', 'age', 'class', 'religion', 'equally', 'would', 'be', 'audacious', 'enough', 'call', 'therapy', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'pedantic', ""'good-for-you"", 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'out', 'Think', 'life', 'only', 'life', 'looking', 'glass', 'not', 'game', 'show.I', 'pray', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'apparently', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'do', 'do', 'love', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'present', 'film', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'lots', 'goodies', 'including', 'commentary', 'two', 'leads', 'Peter', 'Weir', ""'re"", 'quart', 'mocha', 'hazelnut', 'fudge', 'ice', 'cream']",N/A
109819,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790742047,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","The inability to ""reconnect"" in the wake of a significant emotional event, especially one involving a close encounter with death, is examined by director Peter Weir, in ""Fearless,"" a gripping drama starring Jeff Bridges as a man emotionally adrift after walking away from an accident (a plane crash) that by all rights should have killed him, but inexplicably did not.  And Weir goes on to take what is essentially a character study one step further, beyond the inevitable ""why me?"" that one who survives such an unimaginable episode in their life must necessarily make, to probe the psyche of the survivor and attempt to sort out the ensuing catch-22 of the mind, wherein the incident has manifested a schizophrenic sense of guilt/euphoria born of fate's decree that he, among those now dead, should live.  It's a lot to assimilate; a taxing physical and psychological challenge necessitating an expanded utilization of the human capacity, and the subsequent negotiation of the attendant recast attitude and aptitude.  All of which Weir succinctly captures through keen observation and his own intuitive grasp of the human condition.As the film opens, we see Max Klein (Bridges) making his way through a cornfield just outside of Bakersfield, California; he's carrying a baby in his arms and has a young boy by the hand, leading him determinedly through the haze of smoke from the crash.  There are others following Max, as well.  And even before they emerge from the field, coming upon the crash site where rescue workers are already furiously attempting to sort it all out, there is a detachment about Max that is readily discernible.  He surveys the situation calmly, as if seeing it all through the eyes of someone else, as if he were outside of himself, observing rather than experiencing.  Then after locating the baby's mother, he simply walks away from it all, never looking back.Two days later the F.B.I. finds him in a local motel.  They put him together with a representative from the airline, who offers him a train ticket back home to San Francisco.  But Max wants to fly home, which astounds the rep.  ""But your wife,"" she says, ""Told us that you didn't like to fly, even before the--""  ""The crash?"" he replies.  Then with assurance he tells her, ""I want to fly home on your airline.  But I have a request; I want to go first class.""  And we know now, without question, that Max is not the same man that he was before the crash.In his previous films, such as ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" (1975), ""Witness"" (1985) and ""The Mosquito Coast"" (1986), Weir established himself as a director who knows human nature and is adept at exploring the emotional depths of his characters, in stories dealing with ordinary people thrust into extraordinary situations.  As he does with this film, Weir sets a deliberate pace and allows that extra moment that means so much to the development of the characters.  It's a subtle approach that adds depth and resonance to his films, and allows his audience to experience, rather than just watch, the drama as it unfolds.  And he understands (as few directors do-- especially Americans ) the impact that ""silence"" can have, as in the scenes here shortly after Max leaves the crash sight.  First, Weir shows us a solemn Max, driving alone through the desert at high speed, gradually awakening to the joys of living, to that ""feeling"" of being alive, as he sticks his head out of the widow and lets the wind hit him in the face, slapping him with the reality that he is, indeed, alive.  But then we see Max parked by the side of the road, sitting on the ground, pensively staring out at the vast expanse of desert and at the low, blue mountains in the distance.  The absolute silence Weir effects allows us to share Max's thoughts at that moment, to get inside his head as he picks up a bit of dirt and examines it closely, then as he looks up again at the nothingness/everything that surrounds him.  As Max reflects, we reflect with him; and in that precise moment, that necessary connection between Max and the audience is firmly established.  It's a quiet, and brilliant, piece of filmmaking.Through many years and many movies, Jeff Bridges has demonstrated time and again his consummate ability as an actor who can ""touch"" his audience, and he continues to evolve with every new film.  Max is perhaps his most challenging role ever, as it requires a vast emotional range to make this character convincing and bring him to life believably.  And Bridges succeeds magnificently, and on a number of levels, with an inspiring, Oscar worthy performance.  The finesse with which he conveys his moods and emotions is extraordinary; he enables you to ""feel"" his displacement, share his compassion, sense his empathy and know his anger.  Quite simply, Bridges makes Max Klein a character you are not going to forget.As Laura Klein, Isabella Rossellini gives a remarkable performance, as well, as the wife given the gift of her husband's life, only to have to suffer his state of ""limbo,"" as she desperately attempts to penetrate the defense mechanisms that have given him a renewed appreciation for the touch, taste and beauty of life, all of which she is unable to share because his experience has taken him to a place she cannot possibly go.  Her portrayal is astute, convincing and some of the best work she has ever done.Also turning in a strong performance, for which she deservedly was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, is Rosie Perez, as Carla, a fellow crash survivor with whom Max forms an especially strong and significant bond.Written for the screen by Rafael Yglesias (adapted from his own novel), beautifully filmed by Allen Davian, and with a haunting score by Maurice Jarre that so sensitively enhances the drama in an understated way, ""Fearless"" is an example of filmmaking at it's best.",5,A Transcendent

109820,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,0790742047,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[6, 6]","&quot;Fearless&quot; begins with one of the best opening sequences ever: a dishevelled man steps between rows of corn in a cornfield. In one arm he holds a baby, a young boy is holding his other hand. As he emerges from the corn onto an asphalt road, the camera pulls back to reveal what is in the field behind him... the smoking wreckage and human debris of a commercial airplane which has just crashed.With this memorable beginning, &quot;Fearless&quot; quickly establishes a tone of simple beauty, honesty, and pathos in the face of disaster and tragedy, a tone which is maintained through every single scene. Though the plot of the film is important, this is a movie about people more than about events. The characters are what carry &quot;Fearless&quot; to the end, and the changes they go through as the story progresses are what it's all about.The main character is the man we first saw in the cornfield. His name is Max Klein, and simply put, his world is turned upside down by the plane crash. Though he survived the crash (and in fact, as the audience learns, saved the lives of several others), he cannot accept the idea that he is still alive. He begins to experience his life as if he were an outsider to it. Something in him is changed, perhaps irrevocably so, and his journey is the main story of the film.Max is played flawlessly by Jeff Bridges, in perhaps the finest and most nuanced role of his career. Bridges has been good in many films, but in &quot;Fearless&quot; he truly outdid himself. The other actors in the film also turn in excellent performances, from Isabella Rosselini as Max's wife struggling to love the new Max as she did the old one, Rosie Perez as another crash survivor who lost her child in the crash, John Turturro as a psychologist who tries to help Max, and all-too brief appearances by Tom Hulce as a delightfully self-deprecating lawyer representing the crash victims. The acting in &quot;Fearless&quot; is of such quality that the audience can forget that it's acting, and just allow the performances to be real.Peter Weir's direction, always of high-quality, is honed to fine effect for &quot;Fearless.&quot; As always, Weir uses some very powerful imagery to carry the story, but he walks the fine line of never allowing the images to overpower the story. Not a single image is there for its own sake, each shot helps to move the audience towards the conclusion. Weir's careful hand is evident throughout the film, but never moreso than in a stunningly moving plane crash sequence, in which the images have both metaphorical and literal meaning. The imagery of &quot;Fearless&quot; is subtle, but much of it is nonetheless unforgettable.The music chosen for &quot;Fearless&quot; could not have been better. Maurice Jarre's usual soft touch, an excellent match for Weir's visual style, is used here perfectly. As for the other music... from the Gypsy Kings' joyous &quot;Sin Ella&quot; to U2's striving &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; to Henryk Gorecki's rich and moving &quot;Symphony No. 3,&quot; each piece is chosen for its effect as stand-alone music, and also for how it fits with the images and the plot at that point. The film's climax, set to the Gorecki piece, is greatly enhanced by the music, so much so that it's now nearly impossible to imagine one without the other.Sadly, it seems that yet another of my favorite films has been given the short shrift in terms of DVD presentation. Still, I simply cannot bring myself to give &quot;Fearless&quot; anything less than what it so richly deserves.  There is no question that it is a five-star movie in my book, despite the fact that the DVD is disappointingly weak in terms of presentation. Shown in fullscreen &quot;pan &amp; scan&quot; only, with fair picture quality and no extras to speak of, the DVD for such a fine film as &quot;Fearless&quot; deserves far better than this.As a film, however, &quot;Fearless&quot; has remained one of my favorites ever since I first saw it.

At a time like that, do you look to God for answers - there are no atheists in foxholes or on crashing planes - or do you accept what you cannot change, leave your seat, and do what you can do to console a frightened and lonely boy in a forward row?Then, miraculously, if that word is appropriate, you survive the crash! Not only survive it: you become a hero for leading other survivors out of the wreckage. Interestingly, a lot of people would say ""Thank God I'm alive,"" rather than curse God for killing those who didn't survive - it is the same God responsible for both, after all, but somehow, if you're God, your PR is bullet-proof.Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) is the hero in Fearless; he believes, not that he was spared for some divine purpose, but that his survival demonstrates that there _is_ no divine purpose:""When I was 13 my father died in front of my eyes. You know, we were outside of our apartment. I was throwing this softball up and down. Mom screamed, I missed the ball, turned to look. Dad was dead on the sidewalk. A little blood coming out of his nose, his legs were all twisted under him. Looked like somebody with a big hand just reached out and squeezed the life out of him... Couldn't figure that out. He was a religious guy, hard-working, kind to my mother and my sister... I didn't know why God killed my Daddy. There was no reason to. So, I decided there was no God...""People don't so much believe in God as they choose not to believe in nothing. Life and death - they happen for no reason. We think that people are born because their mothers wanted them a lot or because God needed another home-run hitter for the Giants. They think that we die because we eat red meat or rob banks. That way, even though we can never be good enough or careful enough to live forever, at least we can try. But if it makes no sense, if life and death just happen, then we have no reason to do anything.""Max concludes (talking to God) ""You want to kill me but you can't!"" And he offers consolation to another survivor, Carla Rodrigo (Rosie Perez), who lost the baby she was holding in her arms as the plane hit the ground. Even so, she never lets go of her faith: ""You know, He hurt me. He hurt me forever. But I still believe in Him."" It isn't often that atheists and believers get a fair shake - in the same movie. But Fearless is fearless in that respect. The protagonist walks away from his near-death experience in a daze. ""Why didn't you call and say you were alive?"" demands his wife (Isabella Rossellini). ""I thought I was dead,"" replies Max.As with his wife, the people around Max want him to become the ""victim"" he is supposed to be: his lawyer (Tom Hulce), his shrink (John Turturro) and the wife (Deirdre O'Connell) of the best friend who was sitting next to him on the doomed plane (John de Lancie). Max spends so much time with Carla (Perez) that his wife thinks he's having an affair. Instead, Max demonstrates vividly to Carla that there was nothing she could have done to save her baby (which puts them both in the hospital):Carla (nervously): This is a German car?Max: Swedish.Carla: It's very sturdy?Max: It's a very safe car. Very safe and I'm an excellent driver. Never been in an accident - not while I've been behind the wheel, anyway. You know what? Doesn't mean we're gonna survive this ride. Because even if I do everything right, even strapped into this marvelous technology of the reinforced doors and roof, we could still be crushed.

Years later, when the commercial airliner Max is flying on crashes, he is again confronted with the random manner in which God disposes of life. What is most puzzling is that while most of the passengers on board were killed, Max not only survived, but was left unscathed. His suit is hardly wrinkled! Suddenly he is thrust into another zone where every breath is rapture; every grain of sand felt with the fingers and every blade of grass finding light through the cracks in the pavement a revelation.

Max begins to feel untouchable after his miraculous escape from death, but with this feeling of invincibility, he begins to lose touch with the living.

109829,A3R5AFKW4FP0U5,0790742047,SusieQ,"[7, 7]","I don't actually own many DVD's but FEARLESS is one that I've owned for several years.  It's a tossup for me as to which is stronger:  the storyline, or the actors' performances.  (It's one of the rare movies that I've never thought: ""this actor would have been better as that character."")  There is so much to like about this movie; so many little moments of ""good"" that make it all add up to ""great"".For example:  I can find Rosie Perez somewhat annoying in other performances.  But here she's got perfect restraint - she's superb as the grieving (and guilt-stricken) mother who's lost her little boy in the airplane crash. There's a scene where she and Max (Jeff Bridges' character) go to a mall at Christmastime, and she sees a baby boy in his mother's arms.  And she comes close to the little boy and sniffs delicately at his hair, and puts her hand up to touch his curls (but doesn't touch).  The other mother is turned or is turning away the whole time, looking at racks of clothing; at the last moment, when Perez raises her hand to touch the little boy's hair, she walks out of the frame.  Rosie Perez's expression, watching that child in his mother's arms, is one of those exquisite little moments.And again, in the last ten minutes of the story, Max (Jeff Bridges, in the role that should have won him the Oscar), at the end of his tether, says to his wife, from whom he's become estranged:  Help me.  And Isabella Rosellini just looks at him, with an expression of - well, it's very hard to put in words, she's been angry with him, and she's also puzzled yet somehow hopeful, then the doorbell rings and breaks the moment.And that ringing doorbell leads to who I sometimes think is my favorite character in this movie:  Tom Hulce as the lawyer.  Tom Hulce is fantastic, so funny, and SO lawyer-like, I felt like I knew him (I work in the legal field so I found all his dialogue and the accuracy of his performance {sadly} all too true.)  His brief appearances, I think there are three in total, bring some lightness into this serious and very emotional story.Hulce's last scene, which begins softly humorous as usual, segues into a finale between Jeff Bridges and Isabella Rosellini that is one of the best-directed moments of this film (remembrance of the airline crash) that should move the viewer to tears (it certainly gets me every time I've watched it).I mustn't fail to mention Benicio Del Toro as Rosie Perez's husband, he's excellent, and everyone who played a passenger on the doomed flight, even in the briefest amount of screen time, are excellent, too.I've also read the book FEARLESS and can say the author did an expert job adapting the screenplay from his book.  He jettisoned everything from the novel which didn't add to the heart of this story and frankly, he improved it.  And he was extremely fortunate in this cast, and having Peter Weir as director.

There's nothing amiss here--Peter Weir has made one of his best films (from a great portfolio), and the actors have given extremely intense performances that make everything here work.Probably the most important aspect of the film, though, is the treatment of the fear of death and the difficulties involved in having ""cheated"" death.  The movie makes us ask ourselves, ""How would I feel if I survived something that should have killed me?"", and of course, there really is no answer.  How would I look at the world after surviving a plane crash?  How petty and unimportant would all of my everyday trivia become?  How difficult would it be to be around people who still found the trivia to be important?  Max is faced with life after having cheated death, and life no longer makes as much sense to him now that his fear of death--his fear of losing things--is gone.The greatest strength of the film, though, is that it doesn't give us a condescending view of the trivial things that we see as important, but treats with respect those things that give meaning to our lives and help us to go on.  And all this is accomplished in a very watchable way, with characters that we can care about and a story that keeps our interest with seemingly little effort.  This is well worth the time it takes to watch it--several times.

Once the plane is grounded, he has the strength of mind to get others off the plane, and he is a hero.  He does not feel like a hero, but rather like he cheated death.  Yet, survival means he must take a complex journey to find his inner peace and equilibrium.He helps Rosie Perez (Carla), who was ripped apart by the knowledge that she was responsible for her infant son's death.  His wife (Isabella Rossellini) cannot understand his emotions or his journey, and is alienated and jealous of the new friendship with Carla.

Two weeks before I would have given it to him, he died. I haven't gotten over this, and probably never will. Six months ago, I went through an agonizing experience I'd brought on myself, and emerged from it no longer afraid of death.This is what Max Klein experiences. Faced with imminent death, he suddenly sees its lack of power over us -- there is no /reason/ for or to our existence, or what happens to us -- and loses his fear. The transformation is so extreme and indescribable that he disconnects from the people around him, walking around with a bemused indifference to -- and occasional anger at -- what the rest of the world considers important, calling himself and another survivor ""ghosts"", because, in a sense, he has ""passed through"" death. I won't discuss the film more than this, because it's the kind of film each person will have a distinctly individual reaction to.I have reservations, though. The ending is not well-motivated -- why Max eats the strawberry and reacts the way he does is not clear (at least to me, on first viewing). Worse, we don't see much of Max before his transformation. Though Jeff Bridges gives us, in a just a few seconds, the impression that Max's values are not much different from other people's, and that he hasn't given much thought about life and death, it would have been nice to see how much, and in what ways, he changed. But in the context of a film about our reaction to death and how that reaction informs our lives -- a film likely to rip out your heart -- these are minor points.""Mythbusters"" fans will find the scene in which Bridges demonstrates to Perez why she is /not/ responsible for her son's death very amusing, though it isn't intended to be. The TV series was several years in the future.I say to all those ""reviewers"" who think the latest blockbuster is ""the greatest film ever made"", or who find dramas ""boring"" -- come back when you're 60, and beg forgiveness for your shallow opinions.PS: This transfer is not widescreen, and is taken from a projection print.
