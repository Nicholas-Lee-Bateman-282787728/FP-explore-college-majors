The lessons on prejudiced and revenge were too ostentacious, instead of carefully woven into the stories. There were so many things going on,with so many people, that the movie bordered on boring. The characters were well defined, they just were not used properly.All in all, it did not cross the line into boredom, but it definately opened the door.  With everything going on, the movie went  no where, because it tried too hard to go everywhere. Don't think I will be reaching for this one on a rainy night.",2,Everywhere And Nowhere,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,762,"['movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'decided', 'only', 'go', 'one', 'two', 'directions', 'instead', 'went', 'fifteen', 'different', 'directions', 'introducing', 'fifteen', 'different', 'potential', 'stories', 'exploring', 'only', 'three', 'slightly', 'more', 'others', 'lessons', 'prejudiced', 'revenge', 'were', 'too', 'ostentacious', 'instead', 'carefully', 'woven', 'stories', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'movie', 'bordered', 'boring', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'defined', 'just', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'properly.All', 'did', 'not', 'cross', 'line', 'boredom', 'definately', 'opened', 'door', 'everything', 'going', 'movie', 'went', 'where', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'go', 'everywhere', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'reaching', 'one', 'rainy', 'night']",N/A

The problem is that the data shows a very different picture in the U.S.  Black on white violence is far more common than white on black violence, and often even seems acceptable to some.  The media and some public figures often trip over themselves making excuses for the few stories of black on white violence that somehow manage to make it into the mainstream news.Just getting really tired of the misrepresentation of how things really are.

1028734,A14VQ55F6O49C1,B000JMK6GW,Tommy,"[1, 1]","For a low budget indy film, Pariah does a good job of getting the story across. The acting is decent, the characters interact like a gang and the movie kept me interested from beginning to end. YES, I think American History X is a better made film (with 50 times the budget I might add) and YES I've seen Romper Stomper several times. To be honest, with the exception of Russel Crowe's outstanding performance, I never thought Romper Stomper was a very good movie. Romper Stomper is sloppy, loud and all over the place and for those reasons I enjoyed Pariah a lot more. Pariah has focus, it tells a tight story, the characters are interesting and there are some very sexy skin girls to look at along the way (something most of these movies are sorely lacking). My all-time favorite ""punk gang"" movie is still Suburbia but Pariah will definately be rewatched and enjoyed (with the exception of the rape scene which is very graphic and disturbing). If I had one major issue with the movie it would be with the lead actor who seeks revenge. He was almost TOO angry and brooding and his character really got on my nerves. It's hard to feel sympathy for a character you despise. Still a good movie and a great effort for such a low budget.",4,A good independent film that's worth a watch....,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,1234,"['low', 'budget', 'indy', 'film', 'Pariah', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'story', 'acting', 'decent', 'characters', 'interact', 'gang', 'movie', 'kept', 'interested', 'beginning', 'end', 'YES', 'think', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'better', 'made', 'film', '50', 'times', 'budget', 'might', 'add', 'YES', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Romper', 'Stomper', 'several', 'times', 'be', 'honest', 'exception', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'never', 'thought', 'Romper', 'Stomper', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Romper', 'Stomper', 'sloppy', 'loud', 'place', 'reasons', 'enjoyed', 'Pariah', 'lot', 'more', 'Pariah', 'focus', 'tight', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'very', 'sexy', 'skin', 'girls', 'look', 'way', 'something', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'punk', 'gang', 'movie', 'still', 'Suburbia', 'Pariah', 'will', 'definately', 'be', 'rewatched', 'enjoyed', 'exception', 'rape', 'scene', 'very', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'had', 'one', 'major', 'issue', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'revenge', 'was', 'almost', 'TOO', 'angry', 'brooding', 'character', 'really', 'got', 'nerves', 'hard', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'character', 'despise', 'Still', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'effort', 'low', 'budget']",N/A
