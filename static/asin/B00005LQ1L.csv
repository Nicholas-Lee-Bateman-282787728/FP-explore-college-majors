I didn't expect much, but it was cheap, so I grabbed it.What a pleasant surprise! I use this video regularly and definitely feel and see the results. Michelle Dozios clearly explains and demonstrates every move but is never condescending, irritating or intrusive. She also shows modifications for beginners and advanced exercisers, plus demonstrations of what NOT to do.I'm not a Pilates expert, but I've seen some of these positions before on other Pilates videos, so I'm guessing they're pretty standard. You'll really feel it in your abs. (I think that overall, Pilates is much more effective -- and interesting -- than crunches for toning abs. I know I see a big difference when I do this video regularly.)This is purely Pilates. There's no cardio, no weights. I like to alternate this video with cardio and weight work; additionally, you can skip the ab section on your other videos and use this instead.This is a great intro to Pilates, and you sure can't beat the price.

All the basics are covered. It's easy to take your cue from Michelle Dozois, she's got great educational skills. My level was a beginner's level who only followed several lessons once a week during 3 months with a great Pilates teacher. She showed me how to hold on to the right pilates posture, she was quite focus on the posture because it's a key element to do pilates efficiently. Then I moved away and went to a diffent gym center. The pilates courses were dreadfull and that's why I bought this DVD. Michelle is definitely an inspiring teacher and I would recommand this DVD to anyone, even true beginners who never tried sport before. Some top fitness teachers should closely watch how the ""for dummies"" collection is built, in regards with the menu, the informations and the instructions you get. It's safe and enjoyable with no delay. It's surprising how some workouts are filmed like music videos. In this video the focus is on the exercice core, not on the teacher's face or the decor.

That said, I have long known that I *need* to exercise, and since I'm closing in on 34, now is the time!Pilates has intrigued me for awhile; I have one DVD but just never got around to doing it after the first time for one reason or another.  I bought this earlier in February 2003, and have been doing it this week.  I like it!  Some of the moves are kind of difficult at this time, but I fully expect my abilities to improve as I slim down and become more toned.As others have said, this doesn't have a lot of glitz or music, and the instructor is the only one you see (though I haven't watched the more advanced sections yet, so this may be different in them).  That's okay!  The instructor seems very personable, and I don't &quot;feel bad&quot; because I can't do everything she's doing; she encourages you many times to do just what you can, and to take it easy if you find the moves a bit tough at first.  Soothing voice, an unassuming manner, and very good at explaining things.

664687,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B00005LQ1L,C. Daly,"[11, 14]","Overall I'd give this 3 1/2 stars, but I rounded up.Strengths: tips on neutral spine and breathing, which I think are essential to anyone beginning Pilates, but when you have watched these a couple of times, you can just skip to chapter 3 of the DVD for the workout.  However, there are pointers before each exercise which are very useful for the beginner but awkward to fast forward through.Michele is a good instructor, not grating or annoying like some others.Weaknesses:Some of the poses are not exactly appropriate for someone completely new to exercise.  I was shocked by the last two exercises, which I find extremely difficult though I've been doing Pilates for several months.  One of them was you had to get into a push-up or ""Plank"" position (not the girly kind) and take turns lifting up your legs.  For the next, you had to do the opposite, facing upward and holding your body up with just your arms, then take turns lifting up your legs.  Think of it like a triangle...your arms forming the short side and your body in a perfect diagonal.  Well let's just say my arms are the weakest part of my body and cannot support my weight.  I think there are several other exercises she could have included that would be much more effective and appropriate for a beginner than these intermediate ones.As has been mentioned, modifications are shown halfway through the reps, where they really don't do any good.  If you need to modify, you should be doing so from the beginning.Although it includes an ""intermediate"" workout on the DVD, these have several different exercises than the beginner workout. In some cases they're harder, but in other cases they don't seem harder. Sometimes it doesn't make sense which exercises are considered ""beginner"" and which ""intermediate."" Anyway, I would like to see a flowing beginner workout that does not include the instruction before each exercise.  It seems like whenever I find a workout that does not include excessive instruction before each exercise, the exercises are too difficult for me to do properly.",4,Good but not great,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,2055,"['Overall', ""'d"", 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up.Strengths', 'tips', 'neutral', 'spine', 'breathing', 'think', 'are', 'essential', 'anyone', 'beginning', 'Pilates', 'when', 'have', 'watched', 'couple', 'times', 'can', 'just', 'skip', 'chapter', '3', 'DVD', 'workout', 'However', 'are', 'pointers', 'exercise', 'are', 'very', 'useful', 'beginner', 'awkward', 'fast', 'forward', 'through.Michele', 'good', 'instructor', 'not', 'grating', 'annoying', 'others.Weaknesses', 'poses', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'appropriate', 'someone', 'completely', 'new', 'exercise', 'was', 'shocked', 'last', 'two', 'exercises', 'find', 'extremely', 'difficult', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Pilates', 'several', 'months', 'One', 'was', 'had', 'get', 'push-up', 'Plank', 'position', 'not', 'girly', 'kind', 'take', 'turns', 'lifting', 'up', 'legs', 'next', 'had', 'do', 'opposite', 'facing', 'upward', 'holding', 'body', 'up', 'just', 'arms', 'then', 'take', 'turns', 'lifting', 'up', 'legs', 'Think', 'triangle', 'arms', 'forming', 'short', 'side', 'body', 'perfect', 'diagonal', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'arms', 'are', 'weakest', 'part', 'body', 'can', 'not', 'support', 'weight', 'think', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'exercises', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'appropriate', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'ones.As', 'been', 'mentioned', 'modifications', 'are', 'shown', 'halfway', 'reps', 'where', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'need', 'modify', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'so', 'beginning.Although', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'DVD', 'have', 'several', 'different', 'exercises', 'beginner', 'workout', 'cases', ""'re"", 'harder', 'other', 'cases', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'harder', 'Sometimes', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'exercises', 'are', 'considered', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'Anyway', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'flowing', 'beginner', 'not', 'include', 'instruction', 'exercise', 'whenever', 'find', 'workout', 'not', 'include', 'excessive', 'instruction', 'exercise', 'exercises', 'are', 'too', 'difficult', 'do', 'properly']",Pilates for Dummies VHS

I work out 3 times a week doing cardio and weight training at the gym, but my abdomen never ""bounced back"" after I had my son three years ago, and what I was doing at the gym didn't seem to help. A trainer suggested I try some Pilates as she had had a lot of postpartum moms say it was the only thing that helped their stomach tighten back up. After just a few times with this I am seeing more tightness in my waist and some really nice muscles emerging in my hips and thighs.

The sound is flawless, the lighting, video quality and camera work are stellar, and the skills of Michelle Dozois, not only as an athlete, but as a speaker/teacher, are considerable.There are more authoritative DVDs, such as those from Classical Pilates, but they are more of a reference/documentary than a tutorial.  This, however, is a DVD to actually exercise with, rather than one to simply study.It has background music which can be shut off.  This background music, however, is extremely tasteful.  I'm picky about music, and I found that this music did not detract at all, and might even have enhanced my exercise experience.One thing to note is that the &quot;Beginner&quot; workout contains more exercises, and more difficult exercises, than some people might like.  I'm in fair shape, so I enjoyed this.  But it might be discouraging for some people.There is also an &quot;intermediate&quot; workout with more exercises, and less talk between them.  I'm looking forward to it -- by the time I do it, I'm sure it will bring me closer to the ideal Pilates &quot;flow&quot; or groove.The pacing is wonderful.  I found this DVD to be a perfect compromise between a too-slow, all-talk-and-not-enough-movement (GAIM Ana Caban) video, and a too-fast, perfect-form-but-not-enough-explanation (Classical Pilates) DVD.Each workout is broken into tracks so you can easily skip or revisit any particular exercise.

Lumagui ""green_lantern_2814""","[14, 15]","After reading some reviews and having some interest in trying out Pilates, I went out to find an instructional dvd. I'm not much into stretching. Really. I hate it as I find it the most boring aspect of any workout. So, then I heard about Pilates and the use of a pilates maching called the Reformer. Hmm, interesting. Almost a combination of stretching and machine work type of workout. Little did I know that it would be darn near impossible to find a pilates video using the maching without first buying the machine itself. But then I find out that there's matwork. Hmm, well, then I figured I'd try that first to see if I like it, and it's just not another boring stretching routine. So, I came across Pilates for Dummies at the store which was the right title and right price for me.Now, I consider myself pretty athletic being an avid weightlifter, runner and martial artists. That said, this pilates method is still tough. Didn't know there were other muscles that I never really learned to control under weight training and martial arts training. This workout really emphasizes control and mastery of your &quot;core&quot; which are the muscles of your midsection. And like other reviewers said, it really puts your abs on fire and I already have a nice set to begin with. I like how this workout stretches you  out for flexibility but it stil feels like a workout out with its reps and not just static stretching. The dvd itself is simple, but bright and attractive. The instructor gives great advice and explains the methods of eercises clearly. I had a little trouble with the breathing aspect caused it seemed too fast at times or held too long over several reps. I was half expecting it to be more of a yoga like meditative method of breathing. That, plus, when your abs are working it gets a bit harder to breathe but I guess I'll have to workout on that myself. Also, you get both a beginners and intermediate workout in the same dvd for that low of a price? It's definitely a winner for those who are just beginning or curious about Pilates.

As a totally uncoordinated, thin couch potato, I wanted a workout that slowly introduces me to the different positions, which builds my strength, increases my flexibility, and helps me relax.  I decided to try outPilates Workout for DummiesandBasic Yoga Workout for Dummies.I triedBasic Yoga Workout for Dummiesfirst as yoga was recommended by my sister.  I couldn't have been happier - the moves are explained slowly, in great detail.  I am gaining strength and flexibility, and am really learning to relax.I then triedPilates Workout for Dummies(I thought I would alternate it with the Yoga tape) and must say I was disappointed.  I knew something was wrong as soon as I heard Michelle Dozois.  She's very pleasant, quite chirpy in fact.  But she speaks way too fast.  I just did not get the calm, relaxed feeling as i did from the yoga tape.She starts by rapidly explaining the basics of pilates, ie, how to align the 'box' (torso, abdomen, hips) properly, as this is key to pilates.  As a person with poor coordination, I couldn't really follow what she was saying, and started getting discouraged.  Great, I thought, I can't even align my body right, how am I going to do the exercises?Not very well was the answer.  Dozois speeds through the exercises (18 moves in less than 40 minutes!).  While many reviewers here feel her explanations are just right, and others feel they are too much, I share the opinion of the few who feel there is too little, and what is presented is presented way too quickly.  I couldn't really understand much of what she was talking about and demonstrating, and thus couldn't do the moves properly.  I really am a dummy when it comes to workouts.Also, as other reviewers mention, easier modifications are presented not at the beginning of each move, but in the middle or towards the end.

I think it is a good place to start for beginners.  The instructor, Michelle, is very friendly and demonstrates each exercise before we get to try it at home.  (Do follow her advice at the beginning of the tape and watch it through first before trying the exercises.  I made the mistake of diving in and wound up getting lost.)  The pop-up dummy icons, while helpful at first, get sort of annoying becaue they interrupt her cueing.  And, Michelle could have probably done a bit more cueing, because this is a beginner's tape.  However, even doing slight modifications on some of the exercises, I feel tighter and leaner already.
