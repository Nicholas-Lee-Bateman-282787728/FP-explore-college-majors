It deals with a man from England who goes on to become a savior to a band of poor and starving Sioux Indians in the 1840's when they accept him as part of the tribe. Poignantly sadistic and offensive to the actual Sioux ritual of the Sun dance, it merely accommodates the new role of Harris as a Christ-like benefactor while objectifying the Indians as a tribe of incoherent savages.Once again, the view point is told by an outsider who functions solely to play the role of 'savior'. One scene is especially tedious and tritely when a tribe of Shawnee attack the Sioux encampment and Harris gathers all the Sioux and leads them like an 1800's era gun ensemble to fight off the attacking horsemen!

But it is in fact a lot deeper than that. It shows from inside the functioning, the culture, the rites and rituals of Sioux Indians when a white English Lord is captured and turned into a slave for some time. It shows how he manages to become a warrior by killing two Shoshone assailants. Then he marries the sister of the chief and eventually becomes the chief after a war with the Shoshones who attack the village that he defends successfully. And then they move. It shows how hard they are with old women when their sons have disappeared. It shows how hard they are with their warriors who have to go through very cruel rites. Pain is the deliverer of the soul. It shows the basic motivation of wars between tribes: to loot the others, in other words to survive by doing nothing productive but appropriating what is not theirs but the others'. It could be considered as light anthropologically but when it came out in 1970 it was a real revolution in the sympathy and empathy it conveyed about the Indians, but also about the fact that cruelty and pain were never looked for per se but always to prove the courage and the strength of the person.  In other words it is the proof that Sioux Indians had a high level of morality based on proved physical endurance and courage. It also proved that love was a real dimension among them governing the relations among fellow human beings in the tribe and between men and women, though their love was not necessarily expressed the way we would romantically adorn it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,A first in empathy for Sioux Indians,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1773,"['one', 'rare', 'films', 'American', 'Indians', 'not', 'concerned', 'extermination', 'Custer', 'company', 'fact', 'lot', 'deeper', 'functioning', 'culture', 'rites', 'rituals', 'Sioux', 'Indians', 'when', 'white', 'English', 'Lord', 'captured', 'turned', 'slave', 'time', 'how', 'become', 'warrior', 'killing', 'two', 'Shoshone', 'assailants', 'Then', 'sister', 'chief', 'eventually', 'chief', 'war', 'Shoshones', 'who', 'attack', 'village', 'successfully', 'then', 'move', 'how', 'hard', 'are', 'old', 'women', 'when', 'sons', 'have', 'disappeared', 'how', 'hard', 'are', 'warriors', 'who', 'have', 'go', 'very', 'cruel', 'rites', 'Pain', 'deliverer', 'soul', 'basic', 'motivation', 'wars', 'tribes', 'loot', 'others', 'other', 'words', 'survive', 'doing', 'nothing', 'productive', 'appropriating', 'what', 'not', 'theirs', 'others', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'light', 'anthropologically', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'was', 'real', 'revolution', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'Indians', 'also', 'fact', 'cruelty', 'pain', 'were', 'never', 'looked', 'se', 'always', 'prove', 'courage', 'strength', 'person', 'other', 'words', 'proof', 'Sioux', 'Indians', 'had', 'high', 'level', 'morality', 'based', 'proved', 'physical', 'endurance', 'courage', 'also', 'proved', 'love', 'was', 'real', 'dimension', 'governing', 'relations', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'tribe', 'men', 'women', 'love', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'expressed', 'way', 'would', 'romantically', 'adorn', 'it.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

He is captured by the Sioux Indians where he is first humiliated, but learns the Indian way of life, participates in a painful ritual, finds love and teaches the Indians a thing or two about war.  Ridiculous!  First of all, let's look at the cast.  In addition to Richard Harris there's Dame Judith Anderson from Australia, cast as Buffalo Cow; Corinna Tsopei, a former Miss Universe from Greece, cast as Running Deer; Manu Tupou, a Polynesian from the Fiji Islands cast as Yellow Hand.It's true the cast speaks in an Indian language but I wonder if that's just to cover up all their different accents.  And even though there is a note at the beginning of the movie that the ritual has been well researched, it is doubtful that any white man ever had this honor, which is played with all its gruesome reality with the intent to shock. I can't believe that a white man would ever become chief either.  This was supposed to be a groundbreaking film in 1970 because it depicted life inside the Indian camp, which I assume was based on historical research.  But the lead was still played by a white man and the entire story is seen through his eyes.  And thr emphasis was placed on the Indians' cruelty.  This is unacceptable to my sensibilities even though the film did hold my interest, the cinematography was good and I learned a few details about Indian life.

563353,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000051S43,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[5, 8]","If people thought Mel Gibson had it tough getting people to watch a movie that was fully in Aramaic, think back to 1970 when A Man Called Horse came out. This movie is almost entirely spoken in Lakota, and there aren't subtitles. This helps you to really get a sense of what it was like to be thrown into a foreign culture and to try to thrive there.Richard Harris plays John Morgan, a nobleman from England who has gotten bored with life and has been romping around the plans of the American West to find something more interesting. This is back in the 1820s, before the civil war, when there were vast expanses of quiet. Suddenly, Morgan is captured by the Sioux Indians. They treat him like a pack animal, calling him horse. It's not necessarily that the natives were ""excessively cruel"" to their captured slaves, in an unusual way. They looked down on them just as the southerners looked down on their slaves. They treated them as functional possessions - to be fed and watered, but certainly not paid much concern to. Morgan has to do chores, eat what is given to him, and sleep outside in the cold.Morgan learns to do what he must to stay alive, including defending his dignity. We get an ""I am not a horse!"" stand, very much reminding us of ""I am not an animal!"" from a certain other movie. Every person wants to be respected for their humanity. The chief's sister falls for his good looks and soon the two are making goo-goo eyes at each other. But there's a catch. For Morgan to get the girl, he needs scars on his chest.In a scene which probably goes down as one of the most memorable in all movies featuring native american cultures, claws are inserted into Morgan's chest muscles and he is suspended by them, spinning in slow circles. It is of course agonizing. But it was also a rite of passage, a way for a boy to prove he had become a man. A tribal ""tattoo"" if you will. The ceremony was the Sun Dance, to celebrate the strength and power of life.I give the movie high marks for really striving to keep the situations authentic. We don't get translations of all the Lakota language, nor is the movie ""dubbed"" in English. Instead, you have to listen to the native language and try to learn as you go what they are saying. There are of course English sections where Morgan is talking to himself or to another captive in the group. The clothing, the homes, the ceremonial lodge are all quite fascinating to see. Many of the actors were from the Sioux reservation and knew how to do these things properly.That being said, there is also a bit of ""English dude saves backwards natives"" as well. It's Morgan's skilled tactics that save the day when a battle ensues - even though this tribe has been fighting wars their entire lives, while Morgan has been off lazing in the sun. The chief's daughter could marry whoever she wanted and choose the ""best of the best"" - and she goes for Morgan. In very little time - and without really learning the language - Morgan goes from looked down on slave to most exulted leader.I am also a bit embarassed that they had such trouble finding real native americans to play the lead roles. I realize if we watch a movie about the Roman Empire we tend to have Americans, not 100% Romans, playing those parts. They put Americans into all the parts in a Robin Hood movie, too. However, Native Americans *are* Americans and they were right there in the areas that the movies were being filmed. Instead, they took actors who did not look Native American at all, painted them red, and made it seem that it was good enough. I certainly understand that a good actor can submerge himself into the part, but if the movie is about a captured male African slave and his traumas coming to America, it wouldn't do well to have that played by Gwyneth Paltrow and filmed in Siberia. As good as an actress as she is, the visual mismatch would interfere with the story.Still, in all, it is definitely a movie to watch at least one, and appreciate the parts that were done well. At one point, Morgan's fellow slave crows over a bad thing which has happened to one of the Sioux. Morgan turns and snarls at him, asking him if he has learned nothing in the five years he has been with the tribe. I certainly appreciate that sense that we can all learn from other cultures, if we would just open our ears and listen.",5,A Learning Experience,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,4336,"['people', 'thought', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'had', 'tough', 'getting', 'people', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'fully', 'Aramaic', 'think', 'back', '1970', 'when', 'Man', 'Called', 'Horse', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'spoken', 'Lakota', 'are', ""n't"", 'subtitles', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'thrown', 'foreign', 'culture', 'try', 'thrive', 'there.Richard', 'Harris', 'John', 'Morgan', 'nobleman', 'England', 'who', 'gotten', 'bored', 'life', 'been', 'romping', 'plans', 'American', 'West', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'back', '1820s', 'civil', 'war', 'when', 'were', 'vast', 'expanses', 'quiet', 'Suddenly', 'Morgan', 'captured', 'Sioux', 'Indians', 'treat', 'pack', 'animal', 'calling', 'horse', 'not', 'necessarily', 'natives', 'were', 'excessively', 'cruel', 'captured', 'slaves', 'unusual', 'way', 'looked', 'down', 'just', 'southerners', 'looked', 'down', 'slaves', 'treated', 'functional', 'possessions', 'be', 'fed', 'watered', 'certainly', 'not', 'paid', 'much', 'concern', 'Morgan', 'do', 'chores', 'eat', 'what', 'given', 'sleep', 'outside', 'cold.Morgan', 'do', 'what', 'must', 'stay', 'alive', 'including', 'defending', 'dignity', 'get', 'am', 'not', 'horse', 'stand', 'very', 'much', 'reminding', 'am', 'not', 'animal', 'certain', 'other', 'movie', 'person', 'be', 'respected', 'humanity', 'chief', 'sister', 'good', 'looks', 'soon', 'two', 'are', 'making', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'other', 'catch', 'Morgan', 'get', 'girl', 'scars', 'chest.In', 'scene', 'probably', 'down', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'movies', 'featuring', 'native', 'american', 'cultures', 'claws', 'are', 'inserted', 'Morgan', 'chest', 'muscles', 'suspended', 'spinning', 'slow', 'circles', 'course', 'agonizing', 'was', 'also', 'rite', 'passage', 'way', 'boy', 'prove', 'had', 'become', 'man', 'tribal', 'tattoo', 'will', 'ceremony', 'was', 'Sun', 'Dance', 'celebrate', 'strength', 'power', 'life.I', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'marks', 'really', 'striving', 'keep', 'situations', 'authentic', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'translations', 'Lakota', 'language', 'movie', 'dubbed', 'English', 'Instead', 'have', 'listen', 'native', 'language', 'try', 'learn', 'go', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'are', 'course', 'English', 'sections', 'where', 'Morgan', 'talking', 'captive', 'group', 'clothing', 'homes', 'ceremonial', 'lodge', 'are', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Many', 'actors', 'were', 'Sioux', 'reservation', 'knew', 'how', 'do', 'things', 'properly.That', 'being', 'said', 'also', 'bit', 'English', 'dude', 'saves', 'backwards', 'natives', 'as', 'well', 'Morgan', 'skilled', 'tactics', 'save', 'day', 'when', 'battle', 'ensues', 'even', 'tribe', 'been', 'fighting', 'wars', 'entire', 'lives', 'Morgan', 'been', 'off', 'lazing', 'sun', 'chief', 'daughter', 'could', 'marry', 'whoever', 'wanted', 'choose', 'best', 'best', 'Morgan', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'really', 'learning', 'language', 'Morgan', 'looked', 'down', 'slave', 'most', 'exulted', 'leader.I', 'am', 'also', 'bit', 'embarassed', 'had', 'such', 'trouble', 'finding', 'real', 'native', 'americans', 'play', 'lead', 'roles', 'realize', 'watch', 'movie', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'tend', 'have', 'Americans', 'not', '100', '%', 'Romans', 'playing', 'parts', 'put', 'Americans', 'parts', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'movie', 'too', 'However', 'Native', 'Americans', '*are*', 'Americans', 'were', 'right', 'there', 'areas', 'movies', 'were', 'being', 'filmed', 'Instead', 'took', 'actors', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'Native', 'American', 'painted', 'red', 'made', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'certainly', 'understand', 'good', 'actor', 'can', 'submerge', 'part', 'movie', 'captured', 'male', 'African', 'slave', 'traumas', 'coming', 'America', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'have', 'played', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'filmed', 'Siberia', 'As', 'good', 'actress', 'visual', 'mismatch', 'would', 'interfere', 'story.Still', 'definitely', 'movie', 'watch', 'least', 'one', 'appreciate', 'parts', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'one', 'point', 'Morgan', 'fellow', 'slave', 'over', 'bad', 'thing', 'happened', 'one', 'Sioux', 'Morgan', 'snarls', 'asking', 'learned', 'nothing', 'five', 'years', 'been', 'tribe', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'sense', 'can', 'learn', 'other', 'cultures', 'would', 'just', 'open', 'ears', 'listen']",N/A

563355,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000051S43,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","In the early seventies there was a ton of movies released that all dealt with the west from the perspective of the Indians. While we had been raised with movies that had savages attacking women and children for so long now we were presented with a group of humans who weren't the devil incarnate but just people who were different. Movies like LITTLE BIG MAN and SOLDIER BLUE came out. And in 1970 we had A MAN CALLED HORSE.Richard Harris stars as John Morgan, an English nobleman who has left his homeland for a time and come to America. Out in the Wild West, he's enjoying a hunting trip that is suddenly disrupted by a group of Sioux Indians that attack his camp, kill and scalp his guides and then capture Morgan.Naked and dragged behind a horse with a rope around him, Morgan is taken back to the Indian's camp and treated like the lowest of low. They view him as little more than a dog going so far as to keep him tied near them.As time passes, Morgan begins to learn about the Indians and their ways with the help of Batise (Jean Gascon), another captive who has learned how to speak their language but can also speak English and French. Through the translations Batise provides Morgan learns about his position in the tribe as a captive and also how they live their lives, how they differ from the lives led by English nobles.A day comes when the village the tribe lives in is about to be attacked by two members of another tribe. One of the boys takes out the first and Morgan leaps to attack the second, killing him with his own knife. As the boys scalp the first one, Morgan realizes to become accepted he must follow suit and does so to the second attacker.Morgan becomes accepted among the tribe and must earn his place among them. Throughout his stay he has caught the eye of Running Deer, the sister of the tribe's leader, Yellow Hand. He makes an offer for her hand in marriage but is rebuffed by Yellow Hand until he can complete the Sun Vow, a torturous physical ordeal the men of the tribe go through to prove their bravery. Morgan does complete the task and is united with Running Deer. It is perhaps the images of this ceremony that most will recall when thinking of this film, a scene where hooks are inserted through Morgan's chest muscles from which he is then hung from the ceiling.A MAN CALLED HORSE was a different sort of western than had been seen before. As I said earlier, rather than being presented with the actions of this tribe as uncivilized men we are instead offered a look at them through their eyes. The things they did might have seemed savage to us but in their culture it was totally acceptable. This film attempts to make that plain and understandable.The scenery in the film is gorgeous and one would think that with this being released now on blu-ray that it would be breathtaking. But the fact remains that while blu-ray may offer an amazing new look to most things it can only reprocess what there was to begin with. Without a high quality print or if the film were shot less than perfect, no amount of transfer to the blu-ray format will change what was originally shot.The acting in this film is well performed by all. Harris does a fine job portraying a man who was more lost before his capture than he was after. Early scenes have him describe his life in England that present him as being out of touch there even though he accepts it. His scenes of life with the Indians later on seem to present him more in touch with himself.Many never think about the life of the Indian or what they went through. You rarely even hear it spoken of today. And while Hollywood fluctuates between presenting them as either complete animals or noble savages, the fact is that perhaps they were like the rest of us, somewhere in between. This movie does its best to present that.",3,UNDERSTANDING INDIANS,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,3813,"['early', 'seventies', 'was', 'ton', 'movies', 'released', 'dealt', 'west', 'perspective', 'Indians', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'movies', 'had', 'savages', 'attacking', 'women', 'children', 'so', 'long', 'now', 'were', 'presented', 'group', 'humans', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'devil', 'incarnate', 'just', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'different', 'Movies', 'LITTLE', 'BIG', 'MAN', 'SOLDIER', 'BLUE', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'had', 'MAN', 'CALLED', 'HORSE.Richard', 'Harris', 'John', 'Morgan', 'English', 'nobleman', 'who', 'left', 'homeland', 'time', 'come', 'America', 'Out', 'Wild', 'West', 'enjoying', 'hunting', 'trip', 'suddenly', 'disrupted', 'group', 'Sioux', 'Indians', 'attack', 'camp', 'kill', 'scalp', 'guides', 'then', 'capture', 'Morgan.Naked', 'dragged', 'horse', 'rope', 'Morgan', 'taken', 'back', 'Indian', 'camp', 'treated', 'lowest', 'low', 'view', 'little', 'more', 'dog', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'keep', 'tied', 'them.As', 'time', 'passes', 'Morgan', 'learn', 'Indians', 'ways', 'help', 'Batise', 'Jean', 'Gascon', 'captive', 'who', 'learned', 'how', 'speak', 'language', 'can', 'also', 'speak', 'English', 'French', 'translations', 'Batise', 'Morgan', 'position', 'tribe', 'captive', 'also', 'how', 'live', 'lives', 'how', 'differ', 'lives', 'led', 'English', 'nobles.A', 'day', 'when', 'village', 'tribe', 'lives', 'be', 'attacked', 'two', 'members', 'tribe', 'One', 'boys', 'out', 'first', 'Morgan', 'attack', 'second', 'killing', 'own', 'knife', 'boys', 'scalp', 'first', 'one', 'Morgan', 'become', 'accepted', 'must', 'follow', 'suit', 'so', 'second', 'attacker.Morgan', 'becomes', 'accepted', 'tribe', 'must', 'earn', 'place', 'stay', 'caught', 'eye', 'Running', 'Deer', 'sister', 'tribe', 'leader', 'Yellow', 'Hand', 'offer', 'hand', 'marriage', 'rebuffed', 'Yellow', 'Hand', 'can', 'complete', 'Sun', 'Vow', 'torturous', 'physical', 'men', 'tribe', 'go', 'prove', 'bravery', 'Morgan', 'complete', 'task', 'united', 'Running', 'Deer', 'perhaps', 'images', 'ceremony', 'most', 'will', 'recall', 'when', 'thinking', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'hooks', 'are', 'inserted', 'Morgan', 'chest', 'muscles', 'then', 'hung', 'ceiling.A', 'MAN', 'CALLED', 'HORSE', 'was', 'different', 'sort', 'western', 'had', 'been', 'seen', 'before', 'said', 'earlier', 'rather', 'being', 'presented', 'actions', 'tribe', 'uncivilized', 'men', 'are', 'instead', 'offered', 'look', 'eyes', 'things', 'did', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'savage', 'culture', 'was', 'totally', 'acceptable', 'film', 'make', 'plain', 'understandable.The', 'scenery', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'being', 'released', 'now', 'blu-ray', 'would', 'be', 'breathtaking', 'fact', 'blu-ray', 'may', 'offer', 'amazing', 'new', 'look', 'most', 'things', 'can', 'only', 'reprocess', 'what', 'was', 'begin', 'high', 'quality', 'print', 'film', 'were', 'shot', 'less', 'perfect', 'amount', 'transfer', 'blu-ray', 'format', 'will', 'change', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'shot.The', 'acting', 'film', 'well', 'performed', 'Harris', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'lost', 'capture', 'was', 'Early', 'scenes', 'have', 'describe', 'life', 'England', 'present', 'being', 'touch', 'even', 'scenes', 'life', 'Indians', 'later', 'seem', 'present', 'more', 'touch', 'himself.Many', 'never', 'think', 'life', 'Indian', 'what', 'went', 'rarely', 'even', 'hear', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'fluctuates', 'presenting', 'complete', 'animals', 'noble', 'savages', 'fact', 'perhaps', 'were', 'rest', 'somewhere', 'movie', 'best', 'present']",N/A

At times I caught myself thinking about some of its scenes deemed by the years and felt sorry that wasn't shown in TV or available to hire. Searching into Amazon I finally found it and of course I bought it. I've just finished watching it and I'm delighted with the revival.It tells the story of an English Lord in 1825 that is hunting & sightseeing Wild America, far away from ""civilization"". He is captured by a Sioux warriors party and kept by its chief as a horse. In this quality the chief gift him to his mother.A hard apprenticeship starts for the Englishman, step by step he rises himself from ""horse"" to warrior to leader. Along with his hardships he comes to understand, admire and adopt this culture so different to his own but full of human values.Harris performs his part with deep conviction and is one of the best of his career. The rest of the cast is of multinational extraction: Manu Tupou fleshing Chief Yellowhand is Fijian, Judith Anderson, his mother is a distinguished performer of Macbeth & Medea, Corinna Tsopei sister of the Chief and lover of the Englishman is Greek and Miss Universe 1964, Eddie Little Sky performs as Black Eagle, Iron Eyes Cody the Medicine Man was born Italian and later adopted Native American identity and married a Native American woman. Real Native Americans performs as Warriors.Is this a drawback? Is it necessary to be Native American to flesh one? I don't think so. We do not expect actual Romans to impersonate Emperors or Egyptians to pass as Pharaohs.One of the other objections to the film is the atrocious pronunciation of the Lakota language, but this is only perceptible by very few. I'm used to hear horrible Spanish in American films and that does not irk me. The bottom-line is that the movie tries to show a realistic approach to the surroundings of a man thrown in an alien environment.Even with its flaws this film moved me to admire and respect Native American culture and start reading and investigating on the subject.A groundbreaking work from the earlier Seventies!!!!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,A Lord in the Teepees.,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,2328,"[""'m"", 'always', 'fascinated', 'books', 'movies', 'deal', 'interaction', 'subjects', 'different', 'cultures', 'such', 'Shogun', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Broken', 'Arrow', '.The', 'film', 'Man', 'Called', 'Horse', '1970', 'had', 'very', 'special', 'place', 'memory', 'times', 'caught', 'thinking', 'scenes', 'deemed', 'years', 'felt', 'sorry', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'TV', 'available', 'hire', 'Searching', 'Amazon', 'finally', 'found', 'course', 'bought', ""'ve"", 'just', 'finished', 'watching', ""'m"", 'delighted', 'revival.It', 'story', 'English', 'Lord', '1825', 'hunting', 'sightseeing', 'Wild', 'America', 'far', 'away', 'civilization', 'captured', 'Sioux', 'warriors', 'party', 'kept', 'chief', 'horse', 'quality', 'chief', 'gift', 'mother.A', 'hard', 'apprenticeship', 'Englishman', 'step', 'step', 'horse', 'warrior', 'leader', 'hardships', 'understand', 'admire', 'adopt', 'culture', 'so', 'different', 'own', 'full', 'human', 'values.Harris', 'performs', 'part', 'deep', 'conviction', 'one', 'best', 'career', 'rest', 'cast', 'multinational', 'extraction', 'Manu', 'Tupou', 'fleshing', 'Chief', 'Yellowhand', 'Fijian', 'Judith', 'Anderson', 'mother', 'distinguished', 'performer', 'Macbeth', 'Medea', 'Corinna', 'Tsopei', 'sister', 'Chief', 'lover', 'Englishman', 'Greek', 'Miss', 'Universe', '1964', 'Eddie', 'Little', 'Sky', 'Black', 'Eagle', 'Iron', 'Eyes', 'Cody', 'Medicine', 'Man', 'was', 'born', 'Italian', 'later', 'adopted', 'Native', 'American', 'identity', 'married', 'Native', 'American', 'woman', 'Real', 'Native', 'Americans', 'performs', 'Warriors.Is', 'drawback', 'necessary', 'be', 'Native', 'American', 'flesh', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'actual', 'Romans', 'impersonate', 'Emperors', 'Egyptians', 'pass', 'Pharaohs.One', 'other', 'objections', 'film', 'atrocious', 'pronunciation', 'Lakota', 'language', 'only', 'perceptible', 'very', 'few', ""'m"", 'used', 'hear', 'horrible', 'Spanish', 'American', 'films', 'not', 'irk', 'bottom-line', 'movie', 'show', 'realistic', 'approach', 'surroundings', 'man', 'thrown', 'alien', 'environment.Even', 'flaws', 'film', 'moved', 'admire', 'respect', 'Native', 'American', 'culture', 'start', 'reading', 'investigating', 'subject.A', 'groundbreaking', 'work', 'earlier', 'Seventies', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

It deals with a man from England who goes on to become a savior to a band of poor and starving Sioux Indians in the 1840's when they accept him as part of the tribe. Poignantly sadistic and offensive to the actual Sioux ritual of the Sun dance, it merely accommodates the new role of Harris as a Christ-like benefactor while objectifying the Indians as a tribe of incoherent savages. Once again, the view point is told by an outsider who functions solely to play the role of 'savior'. One scene is especially tedious and tritely when a tribe of Shawnee attack the Sioux encampment and Harris gathers all the Sioux and leads them like an 1800's era gun ensemble to fight off the attacking horsemen!

Having been raised on cowboy TV, where the Indian is invariably a dangerous savage, this film and Little Big Man were a revelation to me.  LBM was the first film I had seen that portrayed Indians not only as vivid individuals but sympathetically, though it verged on melodrama.  Horse was even better in so many ways.  The Indians first appeared as cruel and brutal, then became human and sympathetic as the film played on.  It is exactly the kind of evolution in perception that one can experience in another culture, with no holds bared and consistent realism throughout.  It is truly masterful in the way that it absorbs the white man into the tribe as an honored member and future leader, including the test of courage and pain.  I particularly liked the Frenchman, who taught him about Sioux ways; I have long remembered his pose: he acted crazy and came to be viewed as a kind of good-luck fool, so was not asked to work.Now, nearly 40 years later, I watched it with my son, 10.  He was shocked at first, then came to understand the culture some, and asked me plenty of questions.  This was a great pleasure to me, indeed it is the reason I got the film.  I could re-live it with him and stimulate his mind as well.Warmly recommended.

One guy who reported that he was writing his review from the Pine Ridge Reservation, complained, amongst many other things that the natives in this film are overly stoic, never cracking a smile.  Strange.  I saw plenty of smiling, joking and laughing so I have to regard this guy's criticism as invalid.  Another fellow thought the use of French was geographically impossible because French was only spoken in the South--apparently Louisiana.  Another brilliant critic that can be ignored.Anyway, this movie is great entertainment and, although it isn't certanly historically correct in every aspect, at least makes an effort to get it right.  Yes, it does the usual Hollywood thing of using white actors made up as Lakota but, hey, it's Hollywood and it is probably difficult to pick up trained actors on every street corner.  The Lakota, although not always shown in a glowing light, are always treated with respect.  I especially enjoyed the children's reaction to 'Horse' killing a Shoshone warrior.  Each little boy, while shouting the Lakota word for 'coup', strikes the corpse with his coup stick.  It is a testamony to the aggression trained into every Lakota boy.So I liked this movie and lot and, for my taste, found it far superior to Cosner's more politically correct 'Dances with Wolves.'

563369,AK61LQI92GTCH,B000051S43,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[14, 15]","An English nobleman, visiting circa-1820 America, is kidnapped by a band of Sioux warriors.  Before you can say `Lord Greystoke"" John Morgan (Richard Harris) is adapting to the strange and savage savages, and integrating himself into their strange and savage culture. That adaptation, of course, ultimately results in Lord John having a pair of splinters driven deep under his chest muscles and getting hoisted high in the air by a rope attached to those splinters.  After this initiation ceremony Horse/Lord John/Harris becomes a respected warrior in the tribe.  The scene, gruesomely realistic when A MAN CALLED HORSE was released in 1970, still works pretty well today.I recommend this movie with, no pun intended, reservations.  Director Elliot Silverstein does a good job of  presenting the story from Harris's point of view.  His initial capture and harsh treatment is appropriately exciting and unsettling.  Harris is good in the physically demanding lead role, and conveys well the disorientation Lord John feels and his gradually increasing confidence in the hostile environment.  And it's always nice to have a movie pay attention to details when it takes place in a foreign and exotic location - in this case a Sioux tribe in the early decades of the 19th century.  The small stuff, as far as I can tell, is accurately related.On the other hand, the `Tarzan factor' always has to be taken into account.  White English nobleman travels to the colony, is kidnapped by the `natives' and, through inherent superiority, rises to a position of power and prestige in the foreign environment.  At least A MAN CALLED HORSE treats the Sioux with interest and respect, and even has a few Native Americans, most notably Eddie Little Sky, among the cast.  Well, Iron Eyes Cody, the `Crying Indian' some of us may remember from anti-pollution television commercials of the `70s, has a part in it too. But I've just learned, to my surprise, that Iron Eyes Cody was a second-generation, full blooded Italian from Louisiana whose real name was Espera DeCorti.  Who'da thunk?  Yellow Hand, the chief who claims initial ownership of Horse, is played by Manu Tupou (Fiji Islands.)  Running Deer, Horse's eventual love interest, is played by Corinna Tsopei, Miss Greece 1964.  Perhaps the most intriguing bit of casting is the actress who plays Yellow Hand's mother and Horse's opening day tormenter, Buffalo Cow Head - beneath the brown grease paint and buckskin robe it's no other than the redoubtable Dame Judith Anderson.A MAN CALLED HORSE was followed, a half decade or so later, by RETURN OF A MAN CALLED HORSE.
