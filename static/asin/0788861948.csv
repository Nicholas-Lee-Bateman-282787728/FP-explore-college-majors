The extra scenes are good, though i wouldnt buy the DVD purely for them -- buy it for the show.I have seen every episode of the first season, and it's addictive!! Very funny, heartwarming and just all around enjoyable. The actors are great, my favorite character is George, because he seems so docile, but can be pushed to insanity. Best quotes, great writing and gripping. It's anything and everything you could want in an hour. I recorded this show on a whim on my DVR, and once I got into it I couldnt stop and watched the whole season in a sitting. I think this show differs from most medical dramas because it centers more about the lives of the interns, vs the big head surgeons, who are just supporting cast. It's not as straight drama as ER, and not as comedy as scrubs, it's just in the middle, and it's perfect.",5,This show is fantastic,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,883,"['special', 'features', 'are', 'good', 'insight', 'writing', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'i', 'wouldnt', 'buy', 'DVD', 'purely', 'buy', 'show.I', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'addictive', 'Very', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'just', 'around', 'enjoyable', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'favorite', 'character', 'George', 'so', 'docile', 'can', 'be', 'pushed', 'insanity', 'Best', 'great', 'writing', 'gripping', 'anything', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'hour', 'recorded', 'show', 'whim', 'DVR', 'once', 'got', 'couldnt', 'stop', 'watched', 'whole', 'season', 'sitting', 'think', 'show', 'most', 'medical', 'dramas', 'more', 'lives', 'interns', 'vs', 'big', 'head', 'surgeons', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'straight', 'drama', 'ER', 'not', 'as', 'comedy', 'scrubs', 'just', 'middle', 'perfect']",N/A

84403,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0788861948,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[11, 24]","I began this short first season of Grey's Anatomy with confusion.  Was it a comedy program, was it a drama, was it the clich&eacute; dramedy, or was it simply another television program attempting to bite what little piece of the ER pie there was still remaining?  It feels as if a network cannot be successful unless they staple their nightly lineup with either a lawyer-based program, or a medical drama.  With Grey's Anatomy on ABC, Scrubs on NBC, and ER still on NBC, one could probably get their own medical degree by simply watching prime time television.  Either way, Grey's Anatomy is your clich&eacute; addictive dramedy that is not quite as original as Scrubs and not to the emotional level that ER attempts to consistently be at.  It is, simply put, bland, but addictive.Grey's Anatomy reminds me of a bag of Cheetos.  As you open the bag, a gust of overwhelming smells enters your body.  You assume that what you are about to eat is going to be the greatest taste sensation to enter your mouth.  This could be equated to the opening scenes of Grey's Anatomy, but as you begin to chow down on those cheesy corporate made morsels, you discover that they taste just like everything else that you have ever eaten, and leave nothing more than bad breath and a orange powder on your fingers.  Yet, here is where Grey's Anatomy finally gets you.  Grey's Anatomy is the orange powder on your fingers that you cannot help but continually lick off, instead of just rinsing clean.  While the characters are clich&eacute; and seen in every television program created (the trailer park girl who worked her way to the top, the insecure boy, the jock, the over-achiever, and the ""regular"" middle-ground character), the story surrounding Grey's Anatomy will make you want to watch another episode after another episode, devouring every drop of orange powder, instead of simply washing it off.Grey's Anatomy is a painful show.  There are characters that you will love (the ""Nazi"" seems more real than anyone else on the show), the jokes will make you smile occasionally, and the intensity of being a first year doctor is obviously in place, but where Grey's Anatomy fails is the originality.  This is not original programming.  Using the season finale cliffhanger as an example, we, as a society of television watchers, have seen this all before.  The ""shock"" of the final episode did nothing for me.  I was not flabbergasted or excited about the upcoming season, I just felt cheated.  Why can't programs like this be more original?  You have recycled elements (newbies at a prestigious hospital) coupled with clich&eacute; moments (the head newbie has a relationship with the head doctor).  Even if you haven't seen this series yet, you already know what is going to happen.I think what utterly disappointed me about this program was the lack of ""realism"".  Sure, perhaps the lingo within the hospital walls were correct, and perhaps even the way that the interns were treated was accurate, but I do not feel that the characters (George, Izzy, Cristina, Alex, and Meredith) seemed plausible in any way.  I hate television programs claiming to be realistic dramedies that take the Friends route to acutely describe the social lives of the characters.  What I mean by this is that bills, transportation, outside circumstances that would typically be labeled as ""real life"", seem to go by the wayside and simply handed to them.  Take for example the party that Izzy threw at Meredith's house, how unbelievable was that?  At least 50 people and no cops were called or was there any concern of how much money these medical interns had to pay for all the booze.  Again, this was just one of many instances of this occurrence, but I hate when television programs take these shortcuts.  I want realism, I want real characters, and is it too much to ask that I want ""real"" issues.  Grey's Anatomy did not provide with enough laughs or enough original drama for me to enjoy it further than just your typical television series.Overall, I thought Grey's Anatomy played it safe.  The characters will not instantly attract you, but by the end of the first season there is a small spark in their eyes.  I will denounce the originality of this show because ... well ... there wasn't any.  The actors surrounding the characters were amateur at best, not quite grasping a character as a whole, but instead playing whatever had to be done for the immediate episode.  I know, from the votes listed here, that I will be in the minority, but I didn't think Grey's Anatomy needed to be as publicized as it was.  Was it good?  I would classify this series (at least the first season) as just ""general"" viewing.  If you were waiting for something to do for about an hour, I would put this program on, but to be a fan ... I think that would be difficult.  I look forward to the next season to see if the creators keep with their theme of unoriginality, or if they decide to actually push the envelope for a bit.  For this viewer, I hope they can muster enough strength to do the latter ...Grade: *** out of *****",3,"Rule number one, don't bother sucking up.

The fact is the relation between Meredith and Dr. Shepherd began weakly and could not, on its own, keep the story going. Neither could Meredith's own struggle for her parents. Her life is just too sad and lonely. On the other hand, the character development of Cristina and Dr. Burke flourished and developed into a strong bond. They were unmatched in many ways, their clash of personalities for one, and yet they made an interesting couple. His patience and her insecurity were fun to watch. The forthcoming Izzie, the unsettled Dr. Karev and the easy-to-relate-to Dr. O'Malley display strengths of character.The entry of Dr. Addison Shepherd tilted the balance and lifted  Ellen's heavy responsibility of carrying the story alone off her shoulders. Immediately, Meredith has more promising prospects and steers her life in the right direction.

84440,A2SZRY5TFW27TR,0788861948,Gordon Ewasiuk,"[5, 6]","Wow!  I discovered this show by accident.  THANK GOODNESS!  What a brilliant, well-written, well-acted drama!  The multiple plot lines, seeing the human, often flawed sides of doctors, even the music is just...the show is amazing.  ABC has a winner and this DVD  set is a must-see DVD of this year.Sadly, season 1 only ran nine episodes due to ABC discovering it late into the year.  Even still, nine episodes of GREAT TELEVISON are better than none.One thing that really stood out was seeing the character flaws.  Watching Meredith as she pursued a married man.  Hearing her call herself a whore while she's in bed with another man.  Seeing her hide from her Dad when he shows up at the hospital after so many years of being out of her life.  My heart cringed when Derrick (played superbly by Patrick Dempsey) told her he was ""very sorry"" right before his wife showed up.  By giving her flaws and making her appear like a regular person, she wins over hearts of viewers -- at least me.  I was rooting for her throughout season one and now season two.The other characters are just as good, if not better.  Burke, one of the residents, plays the confident, assured of himself, resident who, when he discovers he has competition for chief resident, doesn't consider the competition the enemy...just competition.  This, despite the current chief promising the slot to Burke.  Watching him work in the OR, he isn't cocky...just damned good.And who would have thought little Katherine Heigl (Izzie)would turn out to be so...well...full-figured?  She plays as a former model (actually looks like one too!) who paid her way through medical school by posing in lingerie -- cue a plot twist!  She is beautiful, funny, and has ""quarks"" that make her adorable.Sandra Oh plays as Cristina, a well-educated (3 or 4 degrees), motorcycle-riding, Korean doc.  She provides a tough, no-nonsense balance to Izzie.  T.R. Knight, who plays O'Malley, is funny to watch.Last but not least, there is Chandra Wilson, who plays as Miranda Bailey.  Her behavior, mannerisms, and the way she keeps her intern docs running around at just hilarious.  She is affectionately known as the ""nazi"".  I think of her like a mama bear watching over her cubs.  She is tough and demanding but she takes care of her docs.I think the current chief resident, played by James Pickens Jr, isn't long for the show.  He already developed a medical condition in Season 1 and has two doc angling for his job.  My bet is that he's gone by Season 2.  It would be a shame because he's got game -- the man can act.  There is a funny moment when he is practicing surgical moves and racing Sandra Oh.  During the warm-ups, she beats him.  During the actual exam, he not only beats her but performs the test with his eyes closed.(I am deliberately leaving out Alex Carev, played by Justin Chambers.  While he does a great job playing his role, his character is a snake in the grass.)Oh, about the DVD set.  It is made up of 2 DVDs.  It has a couple of bonus features:  Anatomy of a Plot (the toughest cuts from the pilot episode); Dissecting Grey's Anatomy (unaired scenes); and an Avant-Garde trailer.  The shows are in widescreen format - 1.78:1 and come in Dolby Digital 5:1 Surround sound.Get this DVD.

84441,A3IICSS30MRX9M,0788861948,Handsome Johnny,"[0, 0]","Obviously, you'd have to be a Grey's Anatomy fan to get into this package, because it chronicles the whole first season.  I wasn't into the show heavily at that point; my ex got me into it as it progressed that year, but I do remember a few of these episodes from first-run, and I like having this collection around, on the days that are not Thursday and I want to see a classic episode of this show.  One thing: I haven't seen Addison yet, as I don't think she appeared until season 2.  No Callie either; she didn't appear until Season 3.  This may not be for fans of Season 4 (current season), which is WAY different in tone than these DVDs.  At this time, a few years ago, I thought this was the best show on TV ever.  Due to some of the cast reshuffling, I no longer feel that way, as I do feel the quality has declined quite a bit (seasons 1-3 were the best, and I'd rate season 4 as 6/10, with some episodes rated as less than that).  The ""emotional"" factor is still there, occasionally, and it is probably heavier than it was in season 1, where they were just defining who the characters were, but I'd definitely say give seasons 1-3 a spin before getting into the post-Burke era, which doesn't seem to be their strongest.  Last point: in watching these episodes, it is clear to me that Burke (Isaiah Washington) is sorelly missed, as he was pretty much the ""star"" of the show at this time.  Case in point is the season 4 ""let go of the dress"" episode, which was just rerun.  That is one of the all time worst episodes in Grey's history.  Also, you may want to keep in mind, as you watch these episodes from season 1, that the show was part of the Sunday ABC lineup at the time, bookended by ""Desperate Housewives.""  I personally thought this was the best pairing in the show's history, and you can't tell me the pairing with Grey's and ""Big Shots"" is better, because ""Big Shots"" needs to be cancelled asap.",5,"For Grey's Fans, a Great Purchase",1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,1914,"['Obviously', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'fan', 'get', 'package', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'show', 'heavily', 'point', 'ex', 'got', 'progressed', 'year', 'do', 'remember', 'few', 'episodes', 'first-run', 'like', 'having', 'collection', 'around', 'days', 'are', 'not', 'Thursday', 'want', 'see', 'classic', 'episode', 'show', 'One', 'thing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Addison', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'appeared', 'season', '2', 'Callie', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'Season', '3', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fans', 'Season', '4', 'current', 'season', 'WAY', 'different', 'tone', 'DVDs', 'time', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'TV', 'ever', 'Due', 'cast', 'reshuffling', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'way', 'do', 'feel', 'quality', 'declined', 'quite', 'bit', 'seasons', '1-3', 'were', 'best', ""'d"", 'rate', 'season', '4', '6/10', 'episodes', 'rated', 'less', 'emotional', 'factor', 'still', 'there', 'occasionally', 'probably', 'heavier', 'was', 'season', '1', 'where', 'were', 'just', 'defining', 'who', 'characters', 'were', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'say', 'give', 'seasons', '1-3', 'spin', 'getting', 'post-Burke', 'era', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'strongest', 'Last', 'point', 'watching', 'episodes', 'clear', 'Burke', 'Isaiah', 'Washington', 'sorelly', 'missed', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'star', 'show', 'time', 'Case', 'point', 'season', '4', 'let', 'go', 'dress', 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'rerun', 'one', 'time', 'worst', 'episodes', 'Grey', 'history', 'Also', 'may', 'want', 'keep', 'mind', 'watch', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'show', 'was', 'part', 'Sunday', 'ABC', 'lineup', 'time', 'bookended', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'pairing', 'show', 'history', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'pairing', 'Grey', 'Big', 'Shots', 'better', 'Big', 'Shots', 'needs', 'be', 'cancelled', 'asap']",N/A

84456,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,0788861948,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[4, 5]","Grey's Anatomy appeared on Sunday nights on ABC as a mid-season replacement, following the highly-successful Desperate Housewives. By the time the nine-episode first season was finished, it was one of the highest-rated shows on television and it had bumped Boston Legal from the time slot.This two-disc set captures all nine of the first season episodes with a number of special features thrown in for good measure.Grey's Anatomy focuses on surgical resident Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her fellow doctors and residents at Seattle Grace Hospital. Meredith is the daughter of one of the most famous female surgeons in history, Ellis Grey, putting a lot of pressure on Meredith. Adding to that pressure is the fact that Ellis is now suffering from Alzheimers and Meredith is struggling to keep that information from her mother's former colleagues. Even more complications arise for Meredith in the pilot when she finds that the man she had a one-night stand with happens to be one of her supervisors, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). This relationship is the key ingredient in the first season of the show, as Meredith at first tries to get rid of the feelings, then embraces them, only to be slammed with a huge surprise in the final minutes of the season.Pompeo also provides the voice overs for the show, which at times can be rather overbearing, but can also provide just the right mood to establish where the show is coming from. Her character is not the most popular person on television because of the whining, but I think Pompeo does a great job as Meredith, someone obviously dealing with a lot of issues in her life.Dempsey is also fantastic as Dr. Shepherd, or as Meredith's friends like to call him, Dr. McDreamy. This was a career-reviving role for Dempsey and he nails it perfectly and he gets to provide the biggest surprise of the season as the final episode comes to a close.Sandra Oh stars at Cristina Yang, the gung-ho resident who sometimes goes a little too far with trying to get the best cases. It is obvious she is a gifted surgeon, but her bedside manner is far from stellar. She comes across as cold and uncaring at times, but viewers do get to see other sides of her. She enters a relationship with a superior, Dr. Preston Burke (Isiah Washington) midway through the season, and that relationship has carried on into season two.Washington is solid as Dr. Burke. Like Cristina, he is very driven and focused on his work. He has had precious little time for a personal life, which is possibly why he finds Cristina so appealing, as she seems to be just like him.T.R. Knight's George O'Malley, is my favorite character on the show. He has a huge crush on Meredith, but can't bring himself to tell her. He is a sweet guy, and a good doctor, but his bumbling ways make him appear unsure of himself, especially around women, particularly Meredith. You feel good for George when he goes out with a cute nurse who really likes him, but it comes back to bite him, as he contracts a venereal disease that is spreading through the hospital.Justin Chambers was added to the cast late as Dr. Alex Karev. Like Cristina, he has very poor bedside manner, but is cocky as all hell when it comes to his surgical skills. He tends to push other people aside and do what he thinks is right, even if other people offer better solutions.Roswell veteran Katherine Heigl stars as Dr. Izzie Stevens. She paid her way through med school as a model and has to deal with the repercussions of that when Alex finds a magazine spread and posts the photos throughout the hospital. She came from humble beginnings and made herself what she is, which makes her a very likeable character.James Pickens Jr. stars as Chief of Surgery Richard Webber, the man who oversees all the other doctors on the show. His failing eyesight becomes an issue late in the season, but basically in the first season, he just plays the leader. He gets a much-expanded role in the start of season two, when a former relationship between he and Meredith's mother is revealed.Chandra Bailey steals the show as Dr. Miranda Bailey, known as the Nazi. She is the supervisor for Meredith and her fellow interns and it is her job to make their days living hells. She obviously cares about the new doctors, but she is tough, not afraid to yell or get mad when the need arises.This set features two commentary tracks on the pilot, one from creator Shonda Rimes and director Peter Horton, the other from Heigl and Knight, with Oh joining in midway through. There are also a couple of featurettes and a look at a trailer in a foregn language, which is kind of cool.All in all, although this is a chick show, I enjoyed the set, much like I enjoy the show every Sunday night. It is truly addicting television.",5,The anatomy of a hit,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,4773,"['Grey', 'Anatomy', 'appeared', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'ABC', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'following', 'highly-successful', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'time', 'nine-episode', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'finished', 'was', 'one', 'highest-rated', 'shows', 'television', 'had', 'bumped', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'time', 'slot.This', 'two-disc', 'set', 'captures', 'nine', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.Grey', 'Anatomy', 'surgical', 'resident', 'Meredith', 'Grey', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'fellow', 'doctors', 'residents', 'Seattle', 'Grace', 'Hospital', 'Meredith', 'daughter', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'female', 'surgeons', 'history', 'Ellis', 'Grey', 'putting', 'lot', 'pressure', 'Meredith', 'Adding', 'pressure', 'fact', 'Ellis', 'now', 'suffering', 'Alzheimers', 'Meredith', 'struggling', 'keep', 'information', 'mother', 'former', 'colleagues', 'Even', 'more', 'complications', 'arise', 'Meredith', 'pilot', 'when', 'man', 'had', 'one-night', 'stand', 'happens', 'be', 'one', 'supervisors', 'Dr.', 'Derek', 'Shepherd', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'relationship', 'key', 'ingredient', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'Meredith', 'first', 'tries', 'get', 'rid', 'feelings', 'then', 'only', 'be', 'slammed', 'huge', 'surprise', 'final', 'minutes', 'season.Pompeo', 'also', 'voice', 'overs', 'show', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'overbearing', 'can', 'also', 'provide', 'just', 'right', 'mood', 'establish', 'where', 'show', 'coming', 'character', 'not', 'most', 'popular', 'person', 'television', 'whining', 'think', 'Pompeo', 'great', 'job', 'Meredith', 'someone', 'obviously', 'dealing', 'lot', 'issues', 'life.Dempsey', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Dr.', 'Shepherd', 'Meredith', 'friends', 'call', 'Dr.', 'McDreamy', 'was', 'career-reviving', 'role', 'Dempsey', 'perfectly', 'provide', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'season', 'final', 'episode', 'close.Sandra', 'Oh', 'Cristina', 'Yang', 'gung-ho', 'resident', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'trying', 'get', 'best', 'cases', 'obvious', 'gifted', 'surgeon', 'bedside', 'manner', 'far', 'stellar', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'times', 'viewers', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'other', 'sides', 'relationship', 'superior', 'Dr.', 'Preston', 'Burke', 'Isiah', 'Washington', 'midway', 'season', 'relationship', 'carried', 'season', 'two.Washington', 'solid', 'Dr.', 'Burke', 'Cristina', 'very', 'driven', 'focused', 'work', 'had', 'precious', 'little', 'time', 'personal', 'life', 'possibly', 'why', 'Cristina', 'so', 'appealing', 'be', 'just', 'him.T.R', 'Knight', 'George', ""O'Malley"", 'favorite', 'character', 'show', 'huge', 'crush', 'Meredith', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'tell', 'sweet', 'guy', 'good', 'doctor', 'bumbling', 'ways', 'make', 'appear', 'unsure', 'especially', 'women', 'particularly', 'Meredith', 'feel', 'good', 'George', 'when', 'out', 'cute', 'nurse', 'who', 'really', 'back', 'bite', 'contracts', 'venereal', 'disease', 'spreading', 'hospital.Justin', 'Chambers', 'was', 'added', 'cast', 'late', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Karev', 'Cristina', 'very', 'poor', 'bedside', 'manner', 'cocky', 'hell', 'when', 'surgical', 'skills', 'push', 'other', 'people', 'aside', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'even', 'other', 'people', 'offer', 'better', 'solutions.Roswell', 'veteran', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Dr.', 'Izzie', 'Stevens', 'paid', 'way', 'med', 'school', 'model', 'deal', 'repercussions', 'when', 'Alex', 'magazine', 'spread', 'photos', 'hospital', 'came', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'made', 'what', 'very', 'likeable', 'character.James', 'Pickens', 'Jr.', 'Chief', 'Surgery', 'Richard', 'Webber', 'man', 'who', 'other', 'doctors', 'show', 'failing', 'eyesight', 'becomes', 'issue', 'late', 'season', 'basically', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'leader', 'much-expanded', 'role', 'start', 'season', 'two', 'when', 'former', 'relationship', 'Meredith', 'mother', 'revealed.Chandra', 'Bailey', 'show', 'Dr.', 'Miranda', 'Bailey', 'known', 'Nazi', 'supervisor', 'Meredith', 'fellow', 'interns', 'job', 'make', 'days', 'living', 'hells', 'obviously', 'new', 'doctors', 'tough', 'not', 'afraid', 'yell', 'get', 'mad', 'when', 'need', 'arises.This', 'set', 'features', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'pilot', 'one', 'creator', 'Shonda', 'Rimes', 'director', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'other', 'Heigl', 'Knight', 'Oh', 'joining', 'midway', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'featurettes', 'look', 'trailer', 'foregn', 'language', 'kind', 'cool.All', 'chick', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'set', 'much', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Sunday', 'night', 'truly', 'addicting', 'television']",N/A

What makes this show so special? You could say it's the incredibly talented cast, the funny, sometimes out of this world plot lines. Who can ever forget the pregnant man! Perhaps it's how beautifully put together this show is, from the music to the ending monologues that connect these character's stories by glimpsing into their lives when they are most vulnerable, this show finds a way to leave you satisfied after every episode and simultaneously craving the next.Dempsey plays the perfect tragic hero, Katherine Heigle is perfect as the conscience of the show, Sandra Oh plays her role of a determined intern lacking complete interpersonal skills, so seamlessly and Pompeo finds a way to play her lonely character in a way where we don't have to feel sorry for her. I can go on and on....but I guess the point is that the cast has a certain chemistry that when all together their acting seems effortless.With the wave of crime-scene/investigation shows it's nice to have another high quality medical show that I believe can stand right up there with ER. I have to warn you though that this show is not an imitation of ER, it's much more light hearted, yet has these poignant moments of epiphany where you know that the character as grown in some way.  The show is based around five interns making their way through rounds, gaining experience and testing not only their abilities but their will, and confidence to believe in themselves and each other.The first season of Grey's Anatomy is a short one as it was a second-half season filler that exceeded all expectations with it's strong ratings, but don't worry I heard that the DVD's are loaded with extras like commentaries, behind the scenes, and unaired scenes.

84463,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,0788861948,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[4, 5]","Grey's Anatomy is a lighthearted funny medical comedy-drama that gives more insight into the doctors' lives than similar shows like House or ER.  The main characters of the show are the five surgical interns assigned to Dr. Bailey, a resident at Seattle Grace Hospital.  These aren't just any interns, they're surgical interns, the most cutthroat group of them all.  Under the tutelage of Dr. Derek Shepherd, a neurosurgeon, Dr. Preston Burke, a cardiothoracic surgeon, and ""The Chief""  Richard Webber, the interns learn and grow.  The show focuses not only on their cases and individual lives, but on the interaction the interns have with each other, their coworkers, and their patients.The interns are:Meredith Grey--daughter of living legend and super-surgeon, Ellis Grey. Dartmouth Graduate, though doesn't make it plain that she knows more than everyone else--at least not all the time.  Owns the house that three of the interns decide to share.  An overall nice girl.  It's a shame for poor Meredith that on her first day as a surgical intern she discovers she's slept with one of her bosses, Dr. Derek Shepherd (otherwise known as Dr. McDreamy).Christina Yang--Brown undergraduate, Stanford Medical School, and overall overachiever.  Christina Yang is smarter than you, and she's going to make it plain.  Christina is the type of girl who if you were racing to the corner and you tripped and fell, she'd finish the race first then come back and see if you were okay.  It works for her though and it's hard to dislike her for it.Alex Karev--someone has to play the bad guy, and on this show it's Karev.  He's the doctor who will tell you that you've got cancer and then tell you to suck it up when you shed a tear.  The good thing about Karev though is that his brutal honesty isn't covering up for anything.  Occasionally you find yourself wondering if someone can really be so callous.  Yes, they can.Izzy Stevens--Izzy is the pretty girl who people will always look at twice upon finding out that she's really a doctor.  She paid her way through medical school by posing as a centerfold in a men's magazine and the male doctors don't want to let her be more than a pretty face.  Izzy is the doctor you'd want to have if you were looking for compassion, and a kind word rather than the cold hard truth of the matter.George O'Malley--rounds out the merry group by being the peacemaker and the one who keeps everything balanced.  It's blatantly obvious that he has a huge crush on Meredith, but he thinks no one has a clue.  For some reason, Dr. Burke has picked George as his favorite.This group of interns offer humor, warmth, and usually some interesting turn every week.  This show is the reason I watch television on Sunday, and for a little hidden insight check out greyswriters.com, where you can see what the writers were thinking when they came up with different story lines.

What a joy!  Last weekend I watched the entire 9 episodes of the 2005 first season of Grey's Anatomy in one sitting.  It was a real joy, especially since each episode is only 40 minutes long and does not have commercials. I've always liked medical dramas and used to be hooked on ER.  But that now seems dated.

Knight is cast as a bumbling intern with a crush on Pompeo but her heart belongs to a staff doctor, Derek Sheppard.  And then there is Katherine Hengel. a former top model and Sandra Oh, somewhat caustic in her competitiveness.  By the end of the nine episodes all these people became real to me.And then there are the medical dramas - the cheerleader who collapsed during competition, the newborn baby with something wrong with his heart, the surgeon who was in danger of losing his eyesight, the complicated operations which forced the doctors to stand on their feet for hours at a time and think quickly and accurately, and the disappointments, both with the patients and with their romances.

Truth to be told, I don't have that much extra time, so I like to take advantage of it by watching only series that are very good. ""Grey's anatomy"" is simply excellent :)The plot is not overly complicated, but what really makes this show different, when comparing it to others, is the superb cast and of course the great storylines. ""Grey's anatomy"" tells us about the lives of five surgical interns: Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), ""Izzie"" Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Christina Yang (Sandra Oh), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight ) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Moreover, we also get to know about their teachers, teachers that in the case of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) become much more than that.In one of the many episodes that this dvd has, Meredith says that ""We've all heard the proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time, heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day. Still sometimes we have to see for ourselves. We have to make our own mistakes. We have to learn our own lessons. We have to sweep today's possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore.

I tell people all the time that what is so refreshing about this ""medical"" drama is that characters are ""very"" real people, most of which can be found in our families or lives. The writer of the show has found the perfect ingredients for success....a wonderful cast of characters (none of them are toooooo perfect..LOL. Just flawed enough to make them believable), a wonderful storyline and seemingly endless amounts of new material. It is better than ER in its prime.The story seems to center around Meredith Grey, an intense, lonely, resident who is broken emotionally by a series of events outside of her control (I think her parents divorce, her mother's illness, and a sex life that consists of meeting strangers in bars and taking them home). But while the story is about her, it is her interaction with a host of other characters that really makes the show good. The show opens with Meredith rushing to work after spending the night with a guy she met in a bar. Guess what, when she arrives to work, she finds that her new boss is none other than Dr. Shepherd, otherwise known as ""McDreamy"". Over the course of the show, we find that Dr. Shepherd is living and dealing with demons of his own. There are also her roommates, George (who is hopelessly in love with Meredith) and Izzy (the pretty girl who paid her way through medical school by modeling).

The character development helped keep me interested and I felt I got to know Meredith and the other interns. I also got a feel for the hardships being an intern is and how much work goes into becoming a doctor. You also get a feeling of connection with the interns because of how much we find out about them. Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Bailey, and Dr. Burke help them along the way and offer some good advice.

But Grey's Anatomy piqued my interest from the first episode and hasn't let go since the first episode.  After all what middle aged woman verging on older age would mind looking at Dr. McDreamy for a hours each week.  So with some extra time on my hands I thought I would watch the beginning episodes again when they recently became available.Again, I was pleased to realize while watching the last four episodes of season 1 why I really enjoy this show week after week. I am one who reads books  and watches movies and TV for character studies and this show has more than enough to satisfy anybody.  I really like the characters, even the angst of both McDreamy and his current girlfriend especially when his wife whom he's separated from shows up at the hospital for a special assignment. And even though it is a no win situation between these three and an angst filled relationships at best, it does make for good TV viewing.The theme of this show doesn't really differ from those presented in ER, Chicago Hope or even the oldie medical shows like Dr. Kildare and Ben Casey. But it's the cast which makes this a feral hit in my opinion.  Focusing on life in a large Seattle hospital the episodes I viewed are filled with the joys of healing, the agonies of life threatening illnesses and the education of those when they chose their specialty.  And we as viewers are privy to the lives and loves of five surgical interns and their difficult but lovable resident. There are also two dreamy attendants, a wise chief of staff and the mother of one of the residents who is from Alzheimer's.  The cast includes some rather unusual medical situations, i.e. a pregnant man, good writing is good and quirky characters which include a favorite of mine, Sandra Oh.While TV in real a vast wasteland, as somebody once described it in recent years, this show is a winner for me.

We are tired, we are scared, denying it doesn't change the truth. Sooner or later we have to put aside our denial and face the world. Head on, guns blazing. De Nile. It's not just a river in Egypt, it's a freakin' ocean. So how do you keep from drowning in it?"" Ellen Pompeo plays  Meredith Grey, a surgical intern, new to Seattle and Grace Hospital.The shows title is a reference to the famous anatomy book ""Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body"" by Henry Gray. Well known by all in the health care field, and very well memorized by all medical students. The music from each show is well worth listening to, most of it is new and on the top of the charts.""Greys Anatomy"" can be a play on words. Meredith is finding herself, not only in the surgical world, but in her personal life. Her mother is a surgeon suffering from Alzheimer's, her father is dead. She falls in love with the handsome Chief Neurosurgeon, Dr. Derek Shepard played by Patrick Dempsey. She later finds out he is married to a pediatric surgeon. Her new roommates are all surgical interns: T.R. Knight as bumbling, inept, George O'Malley; Sandra Oh, as  Cristina Yang , one of my favorites, and Katherine Heigl as Isobel ""Izzie"" Stevens. Cristina Yang has a one night affair with the hunky,Chief Surgical Resident, Preston Burke; that moves onto ""true"" lust. They are so diametrically different that the old saying"" opposites attract"" is, oh, so true.  And, then, there is ""The Nazi"",Chandra Wilson as Dr. Miranda Bailey. She whips the new interns into shape and keeps them on their toes. It turns out she has a heart as big as Kansas, but then, don't they all?The show is funny, has lots of drama, unrealistic at times and then more than real at other times. The workings of a real hospital? I will leave that for you to decide. The drama of every day in  the life of a surgical intern. Too much work, too little time, but these interns always find time for the personal stories of their patients and, this is where the shows true colors come shining through. The humanness of physicians and the people they care for; the love and dedication it takes to help someone become well, and the sadness and gloom of a death.  The open heart surgery in an elevator by a first year surgical intern is hard to believe, but somehow it works.  This is a TV show that works as well. The personalities ring true; we like them, we want them to succeed. Highly recommended. prisrob",5,Doctors Trying To Remain Human,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,2655,"['Dr.', 'Meredith', 'Grey', 'Sometimes', 'reality', 'way', 'sneaking', 'up', 'biting', '***', 'when', 'dam', 'bursts', 'can', 'do', 'swim', 'world', 'pretend', 'cage', 'not', 'cocoon', 'can', 'only', 'lie', 'ourselves', 'so', 'long', 'are', 'tired', 'are', 'scared', 'denying', ""n't"", 'change', 'truth', 'Sooner', 'later', 'have', 'put', 'aside', 'denial', 'face', 'world', 'Head', 'guns', 'blazing', 'De', 'Nile', 'not', 'just', 'river', 'Egypt', 'freakin', 'ocean', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'keep', 'drowning', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'Meredith', 'Grey', 'surgical', 'intern', 'new', 'Seattle', 'Grace', 'Hospital.The', 'shows', 'title', 'reference', 'famous', 'anatomy', 'book', 'Gray', 'Anatomy', 'Human', 'Body', 'Henry', 'Gray', 'Well', 'known', 'health', 'care', 'field', 'very', 'well', 'memorized', 'medical', 'students', 'music', 'show', 'well', 'worth', 'listening', 'most', 'new', 'top', 'charts', 'Greys', 'Anatomy', 'can', 'be', 'play', 'words', 'Meredith', 'finding', 'not', 'only', 'surgical', 'world', 'personal', 'life', 'mother', 'surgeon', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'father', 'dead', 'love', 'handsome', 'Chief', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Dr.', 'Derek', 'Shepard', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'later', 'out', 'married', 'pediatric', 'surgeon', 'new', 'roommates', 'are', 'surgical', 'interns', 'T.R', 'Knight', 'bumbling', 'inept', 'George', ""O'Malley"", 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Cristina', 'Yang', 'one', 'favorites', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Isobel', 'Izzie', 'Stevens', 'Cristina', 'Yang', 'one', 'night', 'affair', 'hunky', 'Chief', 'Surgical', 'Resident', 'Preston', 'Burke', 'true', 'lust', 'are', 'so', 'diametrically', 'different', 'old', 'saying', 'attract', 'oh', 'so', 'true', 'then', 'Nazi', 'Chandra', 'Wilson', 'Dr.', 'Miranda', 'Bailey', 'new', 'interns', 'shape', 'toes', 'out', 'heart', 'as', 'big', 'Kansas', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'funny', 'lots', 'drama', 'unrealistic', 'times', 'then', 'more', 'real', 'other', 'times', 'workings', 'real', 'hospital', 'will', 'leave', 'decide', 'drama', 'day', 'life', 'surgical', 'intern', 'Too', 'much', 'work', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'interns', 'always', 'find', 'time', 'personal', 'stories', 'patients', 'where', 'shows', 'true', 'colors', 'come', 'shining', 'humanness', 'physicians', 'people', 'care', 'love', 'dedication', 'help', 'someone', 'become', 'well', 'sadness', 'gloom', 'death', 'open', 'heart', 'surgery', 'elevator', 'first', 'year', 'surgical', 'intern', 'hard', 'believe', 'somehow', 'TV', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'personalities', 'ring', 'true', 'like', 'want', 'succeed', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'prisrob']",N/A

84512,A15MLF38WROSWU,0788861948,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[3, 5]","I'm going to make a confession.  When this show first came on, I did not watch it.  I honestly thought it would be yet another hospital show, like ER. Or trying to be the ABC version of House.  Not to mention, I was watching Crossing Jordan on NBC at 10 pm.  I kept hearing people talk about how awesome Grey's Anatomy was, and happened to catch the STD episode when Crossing Jordan did not come on, and was hooked on the show.  I was overjoyed when season 1 was coming out on DVD and bought my copy.  I finally got around to watching my set, and it really solidified my love of this show.Grey's Anatomy centers on the lives of medical interns.  Main characters are Meredith Grey, who has a lot to live up to, being her mother was the infamous Ellis Grey, top surgeon at the hospital at one point.  Izzie, who is way more then a pretty face.  She is compassionate, and very smart.  Chirstina, very competitive, but guarded.  George, the sweet loveable one, and finally Alex.  Alex is the guy with the big head, but he is a hottie(and knows it!!!), you will love and hate because he will do and say things that will have you hating him one min, then does something else that will have you loving him the next.The show is a great blend of drama, thrills and comedy.  It's sexy too, and the sexual chemistry between McDreamy, and Meredith is simply fantastic!!!  Now I have to admit, Burke and Christine's relationship kind of snuck up on me, and poor George!!!  Seems everyone knew how he felt about Meredith except Meredith, and it really makes me feel even more sorry for him (especially with what happened between them during season 2).What I liked about season 1 is I enjoyed every episode.  Every episode had something, that made me like it, so I don't have any particular episode that really stands out as a favorite I will want to watch more then others.  I will admit, I find it irresponsible, that Christina ends up pregnant, and so many staffers end up with an STD.  You would think medical professionals would know better!!!!  3 Interns, 4 residents, and 6 nurses end up with syphilis.  That's just gross.  Gross and irresponsible, but I digress.  I guess it was good they had that happen, to show just because you are in the medical field, they are still human.The medical cases are very diverse, the woman with the 50 pound tumor, the man who has seizers, but is fearing of losing his psychic gift, the woman who chooses to have her baby over her own health, the man who ends up with nails in his head from a nail gun, and decides to have a surgery that could cause him to lose some of his memory.  The rape victim who bit off her attackers penis.  The case that had me misty eyed was the nurse played by Anna Marie Horsford (Amen) and the only reason she was at the hospital was to die.  That was sad, and when Christine tried to save her, even though she had a DNR order, you saw the first inkling of Christine's toughness, and her vulnerability.I was so happy when Izzie got in Alex's face after he posted those photos of her all over the hospital.  When she started stripping down, and then said ""while you have $200 grand in school loans, I'm out of debt"", all I could do was clap and say YEAH IZZIE YOU ROCK!!!  When George realizes the nurse he slept with also had a relationship with Alex, and he attacks Alex, again, I just yelled.  George seems kind of passive, but eventually let's his edgy side show.I simply love Dr. Bailey.  She is tough, she is no nonsense, and she takes no mess.  They call her the Nazi, and she knows it!!!  If you are under Bailey's watch, you won't be getting away with nothing, even though Izzie and Christine did manage to sneak a dead body and perform an autopsy they were not supposed to perform.  Awesome!!!  When Izzie first starts out she is performing rectal exams, and not happy about it.  You can't help but laugh at her expressions when she does them.  Poor George is called 007 because a patient almost dies during a surgery he helped perform.The one surgery that really made my mouth drop was when the woman who had a prior surgery has a towel left in her!!!  Walking around with a towel inside of you for five years is totally nuts, but hey I've heard of worse.Another scene that had me laughing was George screaming ""I'm a man"" and trying to push back on buying tampons for the girls when he did the shopping for the week.  Also not wanting to see Izzie walk around in her underwear was funny also.Even though the show centers mainly on the interns, some of the other doctors get some camera time as well.  Dr. Burke is a handsome man with a God complex, and he has his eye on the Chief of Surgery position.  However, he finds out that Richard has brought in another doctor who could also end up with the position, which would be McDreamy, so now Burke has to prove himself worthy of the position.Meredith is not only having to deal with being a first year intern, but has to come to grips with the fact her one night stand, is also her boss, her mother is suffering from Alzheimer's and she is trying to keep it a secret, and trying to decide if they were going to sell her mother's house or get roommates and live in the home.  She decides to live in the houseSeason 1 is a short set, but you get so much material, you don't even really notice you only get 9 episodes of the show.  If you are a fan of this show, then you must have the season 1 set as part of your television on DVD collection.  I'm already saving for season 2 DVD set!!!!I will voice I'm NOT happy with ABC's decision to move the show to Thursdays for the next season.

84515,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,0788861948,Steven Herring,"[0, 0]","It's been years since I've seen these episodes, and I have to say that I didn't like them as much as I did when they aired. I can't really pinpoint what now I don't like, but I just didn't enjoy them as much. Even though I had forgotten most of the patients I still didn't feel like I cared if they lived or died. Another problem with this season is that it is only nine episodes. Grey's was a mid season replacement in 2005 and only nine were made. Nine hours doesn't give the show a lot of time to expand it's plot lines. There are some nice plots that are introduced though, but you won't see them blossom until season 2. The actors are all excellent. They really show the pain and frustration of doctors very well. Like I said before I loved these episodes when they aired so maybe my enjoyment of the episodes is ruined because I know how these doctors are going to end up in later seasons. Maybe some of the suspense is taken away. One thing that this show is good at is showing how death is just as potent as life. There is a lot of death in this show. Sometimes a depressing amount, but it is rather riveting if you don't know what's coming. The special features are messed up on this release. All of them are on the second disc. Even the deleted scenes from episodes on the first disc are on disc two. This led me to just ignore them all together. Overall this is a nice introduction to a great series. I recommend renting this season, because as I said they were not as enjoyable the second time around. Also there are only nine episodes and [...] bucks seems a little high, even though I paid forty when they came out in 2005. I hope that the re watch of season 2 is a little more enjoyable. I will be reviewing that as well later. If you like medical dramas with some soap opera relationships, then Grey's Anatomy should be playing in your DVD player in the near future.",4,"""It's a beautiful night to save lives""",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1882,"['been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'when', 'aired', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'pinpoint', 'what', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'Even', 'had', 'forgotten', 'most', 'patients', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cared', 'lived', 'died', 'problem', 'season', 'only', 'nine', 'episodes', 'Grey', 'was', 'mid', 'season', 'replacement', '2005', 'only', 'nine', 'were', 'made', 'Nine', 'hours', ""n't"", 'give', 'show', 'lot', 'time', 'expand', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'nice', 'plots', 'are', 'introduced', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'blossom', 'season', '2', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'really', 'show', 'pain', 'frustration', 'doctors', 'very', 'well', 'said', 'loved', 'episodes', 'when', 'aired', 'so', 'maybe', 'enjoyment', 'episodes', 'ruined', 'know', 'how', 'doctors', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'later', 'seasons', 'Maybe', 'suspense', 'taken', 'away', 'One', 'thing', 'show', 'good', 'showing', 'how', 'death', 'just', 'as', 'potent', 'life', 'lot', 'death', 'show', 'depressing', 'amount', 'rather', 'riveting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'messed', 'up', 'release', 'are', 'second', 'disc', 'Even', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'first', 'disc', 'are', 'disc', 'two', 'led', 'just', 'ignore', 'together', 'Overall', 'nice', 'introduction', 'great', 'series', 'recommend', 'renting', 'season', 'said', 'were', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'second', 'time', 'Also', 'are', 'only', 'nine', 'episodes', '[', ']', 'bucks', 'little', 'high', 'even', 'paid', 'forty', 'when', 'came', 'out', '2005', 'hope', 're', 'watch', 'season', '2', 'little', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'be', 'reviewing', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'like', 'medical', 'dramas', 'soap', 'opera', 'relationships', 'then', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'should', 'be', 'playing', 'DVD', 'player', 'near', 'future']",N/A

Thank god...something better than all of the boring rehashed dribble they are putting on TV lately.  It was about time we had something original to watch- original storylines as well as unique characters.  Grey's is entertaining, intelligent, sexy, fun, thought-provoking and shocking.I think what draws so many people to Grey's is that it has a good MIX- a dramatic show with medical emergencies, but it also is about the love lives and professional careers of the staff.  They have a fine balance between the two where neither take over, and the same for the characters, they each get their own storylines.  The staff is so enjoyable because the characters are so diverse, it's not just a show full of only dating or all married people.Season 1 was a fine season to start Grey's Anatomy.

84523,AV5G37VFE5NVD,0788861948,Tom Benton,"[8, 8]","Just when you thought TV execs had scraped the bottom of the medical show barrel, along comes GREY'S ANATOMY, a surprisingly fresh dramedy about the personal and professional lives of five surgical interns and their superiors.  In particular, the show focuses on Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the daughter of a legendary surgeon who - unbeknownst to everyone but Meredith - has advanced Alzheimer's disease.  In the first episode, Meredith awakens next to her one-night-stand, then rushes off for her first day at work.  When she arrives there, she discovers that her one-night-stand is in fact her boss, Dr. Derek Sheperd (Patrick Dempsey)!Meredith's not the only one with problems - her friends and fellow have their share of difficulties as well.  These friends include the wisecracking Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), ex-model Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), kind and shy George O'Malley (T.R. Knight), and the arrogant Alex Karev (Justin Chambers).  In charge of the interns is the cantankerous Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson), also known as ""The Nazi"".  They must also contend with the stern Dr. Burke (Isaiah Washington), who hides a kind heart beneath his harsh shell.There are two ""hot"" medical shows currently airing on TV, each resting on one side of the medical show spectrum.  At the dark, pessimistic end of the spectrum is HOUSE, M.D.  At the light end of the spectrum is GREY'S ANATOMY.  GREY'S ANATOMY utilizes a staff of talented writers who consistently come up with intelligent, creative scripts and inventive scenarios for the characters.  The show is never dull and always interesting, thanks in no small part to the writing staff.  The dialogue is witty and well-written.  The series masterfully fluctuates between being cheerfully humorous and grimly dramatic.  None of this would be possible without the great writing staff.  However, I must bring up the point that Meredith's voice-overs are so simplistic that they're cringeworthy.Even if the writing wasn't top-notch, the cast would be able to keep the show afloat.  Ellen Pompeo is very good as Meredith, but her performance is dominated by those from the rest of the cast.  Katherine Heigl and T.R. Knight are particularly great, and the two work very well together.  Sandra Oh is very amusing, and she has some great chemistry with Isaiah Washington - who is, by the way, excellent.  Then there's Patrick Dempsey, whose Derek Shepherd is as suave and cool a doctor as ever there was.It seems that most shows today have great soundtracks.  GREY'S ANATOMY is no exception - in fact, it has one of the best soundtracks of any show airing today.  The songs add new depth to each scene, always enhancing the show rather than detracting from it.  The theme song, Psapp's ""Cosy in the Rocket"", works wonderfully in the credits sequence.  I must say that the credits sequence is one of the best I've ever seen.  I don't know what it is about it - it just seems perfect to me.  There are no pictures of the cast, merely credits and images which let the audience know that this is more than a medical show: it follows the personal lives of the characters as well.How odd that so many great shows have begun as mid-season replacements.  GREY'S ANATOMY is one such show.  What began as a mid-season replacement has now become one of the biggest shows on television - and rightly so.  Great writing, inventive yet realistic scenarios, an excellent cast and a terrific soundtrack: what more could you want?  There's only one flaw in the series' first season: it's a mere 9 episodes long.GREY'S ANATOMY is like a breath of fresh air.

I was eager to see it for the simple reason that I am a devoted fan of Canadian Diva Sandra Oh whom I have followed since Double Happiness. She's right, she can never get any good roles in Hollywood films since she relocated, and doing a series like Grey's Anatomy is the best job she's gotten. Even though the top billing of this series went to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey, it was Oh who delivered the most memorable performance that's so worthy of her Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards. Well, so far I have only seen five episodes, so my review is more of an introductory. There's romance, educational moments, comedy, and tender moments in it's first five episodes. The gay patient teasing George was funny. The sneeky makeout sessions in the elevator between Meredith and Derek was thrilling and romantic. The ""Dr.Supermodel/Addison"" rescuing the illegal immigrant patient was a heartfelt experience. Then I was moved to tears when Cristina(Sandra Oh) couldn't save the live of the old black nurse. All I can say is that I am a film buff, and I was rather amazed that I enjoyed this series so much, and I definitly want to rent the rest of the first season.",4,Sandra Oh's performance is worthy of her G.G. and S.A.G.

What was so great and addicting about this medical drama? I decided to check it out for myself, all these years later. Grey's Anatomy is similar to Sex and the City - but with a hospital! It features a main female character, in this case Grey, narrating each episode and telling the audience life lessons about growing up and becoming a working adult. Grey is an intern at Seattle Grace Hospital along with many other interesting personalities, some who soon become her roommates! As interesting medical cases and patients move along during the story, the workers at the hospital all become involved in each other's personal lives and create some drama. But not too much drama. Despite the more recent Grey's seasons being criticized for too much over the top plots, this is a perfect blend of drama and medical life.
