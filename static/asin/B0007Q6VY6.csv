I've always been a John Travolta fan and anyone that is I think would agree with me when I say he brings to mind eternal youth. So to see him playing a jaded and bitter character with white hair is a tribute to the true natural talent of the man. I think he's one of the bravest actors we have to take parts that are physically unflattering but unexplainably beautiful because of the amount of spirit and pure joy that went into becoming 'unflattering.' Even Hairspray it looked like he was having a ball and I know he must have been thinking ""the reporters will start back up with the 'he's gay' bit, as if saying someone's gay enough times will turn them gay. John Travolta is wonderful in everything he's done because when you wake up every morning and say ""I can't wait to get to work!"" it shows.

They really get to me usually, firing straight down into my core, making me really feel. And that makes my somewhat ansy. The truth is that the best movies are often the ones we tend to overlook, and I'm ashamed to say that I didn't want to watch this. I'm so glad I did. It was the best couple hours I've spent watching a movie in a long time.Bobby Long is John Travolta, an ex-English professor who once had a big house and a nice family, but now lives in a dilapidated home in New Orleans where he drinks like a fish and eloquently rants about how wonderfully misunderstood he is. He lives with a younger man named Lawson, a former student of Long's, and an aspiring writer. Most of his work ends up in the fireplace. The home these two guys share belonged to a woman named Lorraine, who has just passed away, everyone being able to tell stories about what a great woman she was. Lorraine had an estranged daughter named Pursy (Scarlett Johansson), and upon learning about her mother's death, leaves Florida and her trailer-park life to discover the memory of her mother, as well as discover herself with the help of a couple very intelligent drunks. Just when Bobby thinks he has learned all he could ever know, life throws him a curve ball.Truly, a wonderful film. It moves along at a decent pace, slow enough for you to feel sucked into the Alabama lifestyle they lead, but fast enough to keep you interested in their engrossing lives. Don't skip out on this one.

This movie should prove what kind of talent she has to anyone who had doubts.Outside of Scarlett's wonderful acting, this movie was great. Don't be confused by the title - it is not a story about John Travolta falling in love or anything of the sorts. Their isn't even much romance in the story. The real love song that plays within the movie is that of the relationships built between the characters and in the somewhat predictable ending. This is a movie about a girl named after a weed going back to her roots, believing in herself, and in the end, re-discovering herself.The production value of this film was perfect for it being based in New Orleans.

John Travolta finishes up a good year with his performance as Bobby Long, a once famous college professor whose life has gone totally wrong.  Then it gets shaken up even more when a girl moves in with him and his roommate.  The movie dares to look at people who aren't at the peak of their lives and who aren't living in exciting places. Maybe it slightly glosses over Southerners as a whole, but this movie in no way says that they are perfect. They drink too much and accomplish too little. This movie asks us to consider what we leave behind.  Bobby Long who has come down with a severe case of Al Bundy-itis (only his involves the classroom as opposed to the football field), doesn't realize that his legacy is still being carried on in a very beautiful way.  Lorraine had the luxury of dying, however he had to continue on living, constantly being reminded of what he no longer is. He put all of his eggs into the basket labeled success and now he thinks he has nothing.  I also ask you to consider the conditions of Bobby Long's life. Not all of us have the luxury of wasting away working in a coffee shop. Some people are so poor they have the wait for a Christmas tree to fall off the back of a truck. Yet, Bobby Long considered himself to be emotionally poor not economically poor because emotions will always trump money.  The colors in this movie were very beautiful, and while the tone of the film may have been a wee bit self-involved it still worked. Johansson is always good and Travolta has been on something of a hot streak lately (though I haven't seen ""Be Cool"" yet). Also, Gabriel Macht is also very good as Lawson, and since this movie is little more than these actors that is very important. As part of my crusade to point out the flaws in our university system I do feel obligated to point out one flaw I noticed in the logic of this film. According to this film Bobby Long should be glorified because when he was a professor the rest of the staff hated him. However, they also say that Pursy should be glorified because she's going off to hang out with these slimy professors. . .just a thought.

Scarlett Johansson apparently has very limited range, as she's always playing the same mopey,aimless soul.  John Travolta seems like he could have made it here (something like his misplaced genius performance in Phenomenon), but he comes across flat.  Even when reciting real poetry, he doesn't sound like a poet, and the rest of his dialogue is very uninspired.  The emotional logic in the movie poor, as it's not very beleivable any of the characters motivations for their actions (except maybe the rock bottom ""poet"" living in a dump, but that's no reason for a movie).  The scenes around finding the lost letters are very vague and confusing, and the characters don't respond as emotionally as they should.  Anyways, the whole idea is contrived.  Furthermore, the dull speech by Travolta on graduation day is very trite, and not the least beleivable or sincere.  Just another way for him to have a day in the sun as he continues his down-and-out ways.  There is no reason to feel sorry for this character (even though an accident from his past is supposed to excuse him); a self-absorbed, philandering bore.And the whole thing about New Orleans being romantic and entrancing, please, who's going to be entranced about living year after year in a ghetto.

887243,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007Q6VY6,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","For those who have read Ronald Everett Capps' novel 'Off Magazine Street' and savor the slow, lugubrious, decadent pattern of life in the poor section of New Orleans, then Screenwriter/Director Shainee Gabel's transformation of those ideas into A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG will certainly satisfy. Though Gabel has manipulated characters names and identification to fit her sensitive interpretation of Capps' story into a visual manifestation, the changes are sound and serve to make this remarkably fine low budget film a humid, alcoholically lethargic slice of New Orleans as viable as, say, Tennessee Williams. There is a captured ambiance of the South complete with decay, shanties, intermittent rain, and aimless broken lives that sets a fine stage for a rather minimal story.Purslane Hominy Will (Scarlett Johansson) is a young high school dropout living in trailer park trash in Florida with a low class boyfriend Lee (Clayne Crawford) when she learns of her mother Lorraine's death in New Orleans. Though she hasn't seen or heard from her obese, druggie, songwriter mother in years, she wants to attend her funeral and strikes out for New Orleans.Arriving on the doorstep of her mother's rundown, rotting house, she discovers Bobby Long (John Travolta), an unkempt drunk who once was an English professor in a college in Alabama but fell into oblivion and alcohol when he lost his wife and family. He is living in filth with Lawson Pines (Gabriel Macht) who, as Bobby's teaching assistant whom Bobby has deemed gifted, has followed Bobby to write Bobby's biography - a work in progress that has stalemated in favor of alcoholism and disillusionment. Pursey hears that Booby and Lawson were Lorraine's closest friends (she had invited them to flop in her shabby house, entertained by their low key scholasticism and literature quoting), and that Lorraine had willed her home to the three of them.Pursey moves in reluctantly - she has nowhere else to go - and immediately is at odds with her 'roommates'. Likewise Bobby and Lawson resist Pursey's presence and insist she 'get a life' by returning to high school, making use of her obvious intellect. The verbal sparing that eventually leads the three to find a sense of family lays the foundation for the predictable conclusion.That is the simplicity of the tale - if it is storyline that is important to you. Gabel's distillation of Capps' novel is in the atmosphere she creates with these gifted actors. Bobby may be a drunk but he is the spokesman for a neighborhood of sad broken lives. The world is confined to the street that contains the local bar, churches, and graveyards - each of varying importance but all drenched in humidity and frequent rains and alcohol and aimless living. The local bar is tended by Georgiana (Deborah Kara Unger) with whom Lawson is having a strained affair. The folk who gather at Bobby's literature-spouting soirees include gardener Cecil (Dane Rhodes), Junior (David Jensen), to mention only a few well-defined characters. That anyone could alter the ennui in the way Pursey changes things is a minor miracle.The minimal music score by Grayson Capps is atmospheric as are the off-screen comments and quotations of great literature of TS Eliot, Robert Frost, WH Auden et al. The cinematography by Eliot Davis is properly claustrophobic and decadent in atmosphere. And while some feel the movie is too long for the minimal story, the length and pacing are in keeping with the traditions and the literature of the South and for this viewer it works exceedingly well.Travolta, Johansson, Macht, and Unger give multifaceted, highly sensitive performances. As for Shainee Gabel (whose only other film was the controversial 'Anthem') here is a writer and director to watch. The DVD contains some excellent deleted scenes and one of the more informative 'making of' segments with Gabel, Travolta, Johansson, Macht, and Rhodes speaking with quiet eloquence.

887248,A680RUE1FDO8B,B0007Q6VY6,Jerry Saperstein,"[3, 4]","John Travolta plays Bobby Long, a one time college English professor from Alabama whose uninhibited ways cost him his family and former life. He is now a literature spouting drunk, living in the house of Lorraine Wills, a singer-songwriter, who died young from drink and a hard life. Living with him is Lawson Pine, Bobby's former teaching assistant, who one day intends to write the great American novel about his mentor, none other than Bobby Long. One day the book will get written, if Lawson can stay sober enough and resist the languid ways of the Big Easy.Lorraine is dead - and her estranged daughter, Pursey, comes to the house. The men tell her that each of them owns a third of the house. Scarlett Johansson is very well suited to the role of Purslane Hominy Will, a high school drop-out, living with her boyfriend in a trailer park in Panama City FL.At first, Bobby seems determined to drive Pursey away, an effort Lawson reluctantly assists with for a while.As Pursey digs in her heels, the men come to respect her. They insist she finish high school. She demands they quit drinking.The relationships become deeper as hostility begrudingly turns into respect and affectation between these three very different people, who share the universal wants and desires of all people.Travolta plays his role well, though I feel he studied films and tapes of Truman Capote interviews. Macht plays his role as if he were simply being himself. Johansson in many ways has the most difficult role and she plays it well.I won't give away more of the story for fear of spoiling the movie for others.It's a sweet film, a nice little story. Not blockbuster material, not even necessarily a film that you'll vividly remember. It's just a sweet touching story typical of Southern, particularly New Orleans, stories. Lots of sad and lonely people who try hard to seize what little happiness they can scratch from life.Jerry",5,Travolta channels Truman Capote - and it works really well.,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,1913,"['John', 'Travolta', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'one', 'time', 'college', 'English', 'professor', 'Alabama', 'uninhibited', 'ways', 'cost', 'family', 'former', 'life', 'now', 'literature', 'spouting', 'drunk', 'living', 'house', 'Lorraine', 'Wills', 'singer-songwriter', 'who', 'died', 'young', 'drink', 'hard', 'life', 'Living', 'Lawson', 'Pine', 'Bobby', 'former', 'teaching', 'assistant', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'write', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'mentor', 'none', 'other', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'One', 'day', 'book', 'will', 'get', 'written', 'Lawson', 'can', 'stay', 'sober', 'enough', 'resist', 'languid', 'ways', 'Big', 'Easy.Lorraine', 'dead', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Pursey', 'house', 'men', 'tell', 'third', 'house', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'very', 'well', 'suited', 'role', 'Purslane', 'Hominy', 'Will', 'high', 'school', 'drop-out', 'living', 'boyfriend', 'trailer', 'park', 'Panama', 'City', 'FL.At', 'first', 'Bobby', 'determined', 'drive', 'Pursey', 'away', 'effort', 'Lawson', 'reluctantly', 'while.As', 'Pursey', 'digs', 'heels', 'men', 'come', 'respect', 'insist', 'finish', 'high', 'school', 'quit', 'drinking.The', 'relationships', 'become', 'deeper', 'hostility', 'begrudingly', 'respect', 'affectation', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'share', 'universal', 'desires', 'people.Travolta', 'role', 'well', 'feel', 'studied', 'films', 'tapes', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'interviews', 'Macht', 'role', 'were', 'simply', 'being', 'Johansson', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'difficult', 'role', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'story', 'fear', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'others.It', 'sweet', 'film', 'nice', 'little', 'story', 'Not', 'blockbuster', 'material', 'not', 'even', 'necessarily', 'film', ""'ll"", 'vividly', 'remember', 'just', 'sweet', 'touching', 'story', 'typical', 'Southern', 'particularly', 'New', 'Orleans', 'stories', 'Lots', 'sad', 'lonely', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'hard', 'seize', 'what', 'little', 'happiness', 'can', 'scratch', 'life.Jerry']",N/A

887252,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0007Q6VY6,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[13, 14]","Oscar nominee John Travolta (Best Actor, Pulp Fiction) and the lovely Scarlett Johansson (Match Point) star in this slow paced adaptation of the novel ""Off Magazine Street"" by Ronald Everett Capps. The movie features an underappreciated performance by Travolta, who captures the character of Bobby Long perfectly. It's a mature performance by Travolta and miles away from any character he's played before. The movie is about Pursy Will (Johansson), a young 18-year old who lives in Florida with a boyfriend. When Pursy hears that her estranged mother Lorraine has died, she travels to New Orleans to go to the funeral. Problem is, the funeral was a few days earlier; so Pursy travels to the house Lorraine left for her to find two men.One is Bobby Long (Travolta), a former English professor who's now an old drunk. The other is Bobby's protege Lawson (Gabriel Macht), who's writing a novel about Bobby that doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Pursy finds out that Lorraine left the house two all three of them, but instead of leaving she decides to live with both men despite their misgivings. The movie movies like a memoir, there's no particularly big events that occur. It moves along slowly, like life. There are a few turns of events that occur, but none of them are big enought to warrant calling it a ""twist"". Besides Travolta's wonderful performance, Johansson is perfect as Pursy. I would say that this is her best performance and it would be if not for the movie ""Match Point"". Not everyone will like this movie, many will find it dull and stupid; But this is a mature, sweet, and fairly entertaining movie. Seeing Johansson half-naked wasn't that bad either. I don't know how helpful this review will be in convincing a person to see this movie, but I bought it for 5 dollars at Wal-Mart so it won't be a tragic loss if you don't like it much.GRADE: A-",5,"Moves at a Slow Pace, But Very Good",1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1863,"['Oscar', 'nominee', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'lovely', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Match', 'Point', 'star', 'slow', 'paced', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Off', 'Magazine', 'Street', 'Ronald', 'Everett', 'Capps', 'movie', 'underappreciated', 'performance', 'Travolta', 'who', 'character', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'perfectly', 'mature', 'performance', 'Travolta', 'miles', 'away', 'character', 'played', 'movie', 'Pursy', 'Will', 'Johansson', 'young', '18-year', 'old', 'who', 'Florida', 'boyfriend', 'When', 'Pursy', 'estranged', 'mother', 'Lorraine', 'died', 'New', 'Orleans', 'go', 'funeral', 'Problem', 'funeral', 'was', 'few', 'days', 'earlier', 'so', 'Pursy', 'travels', 'house', 'Lorraine', 'left', 'find', 'two', 'men.One', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'Travolta', 'former', 'English', 'professor', 'who', 'now', 'old', 'drunk', 'other', 'Bobby', 'protege', 'Lawson', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'who', 'writing', 'novel', 'Bobby', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'anywhere', 'Pursy', 'out', 'Lorraine', 'left', 'house', 'two', 'three', 'instead', 'leaving', 'live', 'men', 'misgivings', 'movie', 'movies', 'memoir', 'particularly', 'big', 'events', 'occur', 'along', 'slowly', 'life', 'are', 'few', 'turns', 'events', 'occur', 'none', 'are', 'big', 'enought', 'warrant', 'calling', 'twist', 'Travolta', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Johansson', 'perfect', 'Pursy', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'movie', 'Match', 'Point', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'dull', 'stupid', 'mature', 'sweet', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'Johansson', 'half-naked', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'helpful', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'convincing', 'person', 'see', 'movie', 'bought', '5', 'dollars', 'Wal-Mart', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'tragic', 'loss', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'A-']",N/A
887253,A10872FHIJAKKD,B0007Q6VY6,Just Bill,"[7, 9]","My wife and I have been on a Scarlett Johansson kick lately. We can't seem to get enough of this beguiling, talented actress.Starting with Lost in Translation (a bona fide classic), we searched IMDB for other movies Scarlett has appeared in. We located a few others (The Girl With the Pearl Earring and A Love Song For Bobby Long) at a local rental store and watched them both.In Love Song, Scarlett is as sensual and alluring as Blanche Debois. She sizzles. Yet, she does so with an innocence that belies her raging sensuality. In the end, her performance is one that nearly steals every scene -- even if she's pictured in the background, casually smoking a cigarette or glancing off in the distance, or even listening to the other characters in the frame.The story had enough plot twists to keep us guessing. Yet, at the same time, it seemed totally predictable. Go figure.What surprised us most is John Travolta's performance. Hardly one of our favorite actors, Travolta (as the titular character) turned in a performance that I didn't think him capable of. He looked and acted seedy, like -- as Scarlett's character referred to him -- a ""dirty old man."" He wasn't dashing. There was nothing glamorous about him. In fact, there was very little to like about him. He was an old, gray-haired, sloppy drunkard.Another actor who surprised us was Gabriel Macht who played Bobby's protege. He seemed to reveal as many emotions with just a pained or quizzical look on his face as most actors can by emoting all over the place. He was the perfect counterpoint to Bobby's flamboyance -- a quiet fellow alcoholic who knew better but didn't see a reason to quit.His reason, as well as Bobby's, appears in the form of Scarlett Johansson's character. Typical plot twist. Yet, an atypical rendering elevated by performances that were mesmerizing.This is a movie I'm sure we'll want to buy.I recommend A Love Song for Bobby Long.",5,Unexpectedly outstanding performances elevate this to near must-see status,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1917,"['wife', 'have', 'been', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'kick', 'lately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'enough', 'beguiling', 'talented', 'actress.Starting', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'bona', 'fide', 'classic', 'searched', 'IMDB', 'other', 'movies', 'Scarlett', 'appeared', 'located', 'few', 'others', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'A', 'Love', 'Song', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'local', 'rental', 'store', 'watched', 'both.In', 'Love', 'Song', 'Scarlett', 'sensual', 'alluring', 'Blanche', 'Debois', 'so', 'innocence', 'raging', 'sensuality', 'end', 'performance', 'one', 'nearly', 'scene', 'even', 'pictured', 'background', 'casually', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'glancing', 'off', 'distance', 'even', 'listening', 'other', 'characters', 'frame.The', 'story', 'had', 'enough', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'guessing', 'same', 'time', 'seemed', 'totally', 'predictable', 'Go', 'figure.What', 'surprised', 'most', 'John', 'Travolta', 'performance', 'Hardly', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Travolta', 'titular', 'character', 'turned', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'capable', 'looked', 'acted', 'seedy', 'like', 'Scarlett', 'character', 'referred', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'dashing', 'was', 'nothing', 'glamorous', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'like', 'was', 'old', 'gray-haired', 'sloppy', 'drunkard.Another', 'actor', 'who', 'surprised', 'was', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'who', 'played', 'Bobby', 'protege', 'seemed', 'reveal', 'many', 'emotions', 'just', 'pained', 'quizzical', 'look', 'face', 'most', 'actors', 'can', 'emoting', 'place', 'was', 'perfect', 'counterpoint', 'Bobby', 'flamboyance', 'quiet', 'fellow', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'knew', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'quit.His', 'reason', 'as', 'well', 'Bobby', 'form', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'character', 'Typical', 'plot', 'twist', 'atypical', 'rendering', 'elevated', 'performances', 'were', 'mesmerizing.This', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'want', 'buy.I', 'recommend', 'Love', 'Song', 'Bobby', 'Long']",N/A

These undesirables might even try to get rid of themselves in the process, but only grow stronger as time passes.  In a remote and undisturbed place these undesirables can find a spot where they can find support, like-mindedness, or respectful privacy.  Some undesirables have a stunning appearance, but nonetheless they are rejects.  A Love Song for Bobby Long is a story about a small group of undesirable's in the outskirts of New Orleans where the magic of the city still can touch them.The camera opens shooting a man who the audience later discovers as Bobby Long (John Travolta) who lights a cigarette amidst the haze of alcohol while stumbling towards the door with a paper bag covering a bottle of booze.  When Bobby opens the door blinding light enter the room, as if the daylight would be something foreign and new to him.  Stumbling Bobby moves in an intended direction, as if he has a purpose. He limps due to a discolored toe that probably gives him difficulty in wearing proper shoes, as he wears a slipper on the aching foot.  Limping and stumbling Bobby arrives to a graveyard to pay his respects to Lorraine, someone near and dear who recently has passed away.Some distance away from New Orleans in Florida lives Pursy Will (Scarlett Johansson) Lorraine's only daughter who finds out from her deadbeat boyfriend that her mother has died.  Angry Pursy packs her belonging and leaves for New Orleans to attend the funeral, as she discovers that she has arrived too late and two men live in her mother's decaying house, Bobby and Lawson Pines (Gabriel Macht).  Quickly, Pursy learns that these men are not leaving, and these two alcoholic losers, especially Bobby, do not desire her presence.  Nonetheless, she stays, as she has nowhere else to go.A Love Song for Bobby Long brings the audience on a venture into the part of human society where most do not want to go, as people link it with losers, deadbeats, and misfits - the undesirables.  Despite the bleakness of the situation there are also moments of sunshine and pleasantness, which brighten the existence for all of those who try to forget and avoid society.  The moment of brightness begins to intensify as Pursy arrived, as her name also refers to a yellow flowering weed, yet she keeps on verbally beating down herself and alike.  Something is missing in Pursy's dropout existence, something that Bobby and Lawson recognize, as Bobby used to be an English professor and Lawson his teaching assistant.Eventually, Pursy pursues her General Educational Development (GED) test with a possibility to reach college.  However, Pursy struggles with her societal existence, as she perceives herself as a misfit, an undesirable.  Her negative self-perspective makes it hard for her to academically bloom, which both Lawson and Bobby recognize as they keep on encouraging her to study.  This leaves the audience with the notion of human dualism, as she does not want to be where she is; yet she does not want to leave.Director Shainee Gabel provides an interesting and thoughtful cinematic experience, which the audience can experience through lucid and cryptic reasoning concealed in literature, existential philosophy and psychology.  The mise-en-scene and the framing of scenes enhance the situational atmosphere, which seems to grasp one part of New Orleans with delicate touch and tact.  This combined with a well-performing cast and a script with empathetic and genuine feel ultimately offers a seriously intriguing story of second chances, hope, and love.",4,"Intriguing Story of Second Chances, Hope, and Love...",1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,3626,"['Weeds', 'undesirable', 'elements', 'seem', 'be', 'extremely', 'resilient', 'whatever', 'tries', 'remove', 'undesirables', 'might', 'even', 'try', 'get', 'rid', 'process', 'only', 'grow', 'stronger', 'time', 'passes', 'remote', 'undisturbed', 'place', 'undesirables', 'can', 'find', 'spot', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'support', 'like-mindedness', 'respectful', 'privacy', 'undesirables', 'have', 'stunning', 'appearance', 'nonetheless', 'are', 'rejects', 'Love', 'Song', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'story', 'small', 'group', 'undesirable', 'outskirts', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'magic', 'city', 'still', 'can', 'touch', 'them.The', 'camera', 'shooting', 'man', 'who', 'audience', 'later', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'John', 'Travolta', 'who', 'lights', 'cigarette', 'haze', 'alcohol', 'stumbling', 'door', 'paper', 'bag', 'covering', 'bottle', 'booze', 'When', 'Bobby', 'door', 'blinding', 'light', 'enter', 'room', 'daylight', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'foreign', 'new', 'Stumbling', 'Bobby', 'moves', 'intended', 'direction', 'purpose', 'due', 'discolored', 'toe', 'probably', 'difficulty', 'wearing', 'proper', 'shoes', 'slipper', 'aching', 'foot', 'Limping', 'stumbling', 'Bobby', 'graveyard', 'pay', 'respects', 'Lorraine', 'someone', 'dear', 'who', 'recently', 'passed', 'away.Some', 'distance', 'away', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Florida', 'Pursy', 'Will', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Lorraine', 'only', 'daughter', 'who', 'out', 'deadbeat', 'boyfriend', 'mother', 'died', 'Angry', 'Pursy', 'belonging', 'New', 'Orleans', 'attend', 'funeral', 'arrived', 'too', 'late', 'two', 'men', 'live', 'mother', 'decaying', 'house', 'Bobby', 'Lawson', 'Pines', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'Quickly', 'Pursy', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'leaving', 'two', 'alcoholic', 'losers', 'especially', 'Bobby', 'do', 'not', 'desire', 'presence', 'Nonetheless', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go.A', 'Love', 'Song', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'audience', 'venture', 'part', 'human', 'society', 'where', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'people', 'link', 'losers', 'deadbeats', 'undesirables', 'bleakness', 'situation', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'sunshine', 'pleasantness', 'brighten', 'existence', 'who', 'try', 'forget', 'avoid', 'society', 'moment', 'brightness', 'begins', 'intensify', 'Pursy', 'arrived', 'name', 'also', 'yellow', 'flowering', 'weed', 'verbally', 'beating', 'down', 'alike', 'Something', 'missing', 'Pursy', 'dropout', 'existence', 'something', 'Bobby', 'Lawson', 'recognize', 'Bobby', 'used', 'be', 'English', 'professor', 'Lawson', 'teaching', 'assistant.Eventually', 'Pursy', 'General', 'Educational', 'Development', 'GED', 'test', 'possibility', 'reach', 'college', 'However', 'Pursy', 'societal', 'existence', 'misfit', 'undesirable', 'negative', 'self-perspective', 'hard', 'academically', 'bloom', 'Lawson', 'Bobby', 'recognize', 'keep', 'encouraging', 'study', 'audience', 'notion', 'human', 'dualism', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'where', 'yet', 'not', 'want', 'leave.Director', 'Shainee', 'Gabel', 'interesting', 'thoughtful', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'audience', 'can', 'experience', 'lucid', 'cryptic', 'reasoning', 'concealed', 'literature', 'existential', 'philosophy', 'psychology', 'mise-en-scene', 'framing', 'scenes', 'situational', 'atmosphere', 'grasp', 'one', 'part', 'New', 'Orleans', 'delicate', 'touch', 'tact', 'combined', 'well-performing', 'cast', 'script', 'empathetic', 'genuine', 'feel', 'ultimately', 'seriously', 'intriguing', 'story', 'second', 'chances', 'hope', 'love']",N/A

Bernabo,"[7, 7]","One day Pursy Will (Scarlett Johansson) comes home to the trailer park in Florida and is informed by her boyfriend that Lorraine, her estranged song writing drug addicted mother, has died in New Orleans.  Actually, this is the second such message, so that when Pursy shows up for the funeral it has already taken place.  Then, as the insult added to injury, she is told that her mother's house is inhabited by Bobby Long (John Travolta), a defrocked Auburn professor of literature, and his former student and current prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Lawson Pines (Gabriel Macht).  They declare that each of them has inherited 1/3 of the house and Pursy believes them.  When she decides not to go back to her boyfriend, she has no place else to go but move into the house and try to turn it into something approaching a home. Meanwhile, the meaning of the title of ""A Love Song for Bobby Long"" is slowly but surely revealed in a 2004 drama that emphasizes character over plot.Of course bonds of affection slowly but surely develop between the three.  Bobby and Lawson like to quote literature at one another, which gives them something to do while drinking and smoking, which also allows them to avoid how long Lawson has been working on his great American novel.  But Pursy's presence definitely upsets the delicate balance of their lives, and after a while they feel compelled to return the favor.  As things change Lawson's interest in Pursy forces him to re-evaluate his life and his relationship with Bobby.  Lawson is still a worshipful acolyte, but now there is a mixture of contempt and sorrow for Bobby's situation.  As Pursy gets an education, both in school and at home, she changes as well, but Bobby Long is a tougher nut to crack.  Too bad the surprise ending is anything but for most of us.Johansson's performance is the centerpiece of the film, and for those who were wondering what she could do after ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" and ""Lost in Translation"" that would be on the same level, this would be the most obvious film to recommend.  Already there is ample evidence that Johansson has moved beyond the accomplishments of Claire Danes, who has apparently gone from being a great juvenile talent to being perilously close to ""whatever happened to"" territory.  Travolta's character is playing game with both of his younger housemates and himself, but they are fairly esay to see through, and Macht is not only stuck playing third fiddle but has to do ostentatious voice overs.  Consequently, there are a couple of colorful supporting characters who make more of a positive impression, but Johansson is the main reason to watch this one.Travolta does some singing in this film, mostly of traditional folk songs like ""Barbara Allen.""  But special mention must be made of Grayson Capps, who writes and sings the songs that are, in the context of the story, written by Pursy's mother (this makes perfect sense since his father, Everett Capps wrote ""Off Magazine Street,"" the novel on which the film is based).  At least, I think all of them are intended to be heard as such.  I am sure about ""I See You,"" ""Washboard Lisa,"" ""Love Song for Bobby Long"" and ""Lorraine's Song (My Heart Was a Lonely Hunter),"" and considerably less sure about ""Alabama Shuffle"" and ""Slidell.""  The important thing here is that although the songs are rather incidental to the action, they are important to the story and Capps work plays the same sort of effective role that John Cafferty did for ""Eddie and the Cruisers.""  If you take this as a de facto endorsement of the soundtrack then go right ahead, because these songs are one of the strong points of the film and are worth listening to a few more times.",4,Scarlett Johansson is well worth watching in this one,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,3690,"['One', 'day', 'Pursy', 'Will', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'home', 'trailer', 'park', 'Florida', 'informed', 'boyfriend', 'Lorraine', 'estranged', 'song', 'writing', 'drug', 'addicted', 'mother', 'died', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Actually', 'second', 'such', 'message', 'when', 'Pursy', 'up', 'funeral', 'already', 'taken', 'place', 'Then', 'insult', 'added', 'injury', 'told', 'mother', 'house', 'inhabited', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'John', 'Travolta', 'defrocked', 'Auburn', 'professor', 'literature', 'former', 'student', 'current', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Lawson', 'Pines', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'declare', 'inherited', '1/3', 'house', 'Pursy', 'When', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'boyfriend', 'place', 'else', 'go', 'move', 'house', 'try', 'turn', 'something', 'approaching', 'home', 'Meanwhile', 'meaning', 'title', 'A', 'Love', 'Song', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'slowly', 'surely', 'revealed', '2004', 'drama', 'character', 'plot.Of', 'course', 'bonds', 'affection', 'slowly', 'surely', 'develop', 'three', 'Bobby', 'Lawson', 'quote', 'literature', 'one', 'something', 'do', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'also', 'avoid', 'how', 'long', 'Lawson', 'been', 'working', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'Pursy', 'presence', 'definitely', 'delicate', 'balance', 'lives', 'while', 'feel', 'compelled', 'return', 'favor', 'things', 'change', 'Lawson', 'interest', 'Pursy', 'forces', 're-evaluate', 'life', 'relationship', 'Bobby', 'Lawson', 'still', 'worshipful', 'acolyte', 'now', 'mixture', 'contempt', 'sorrow', 'Bobby', 'situation', 'Pursy', 'education', 'school', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'tougher', 'nut', 'crack', 'Too', 'bad', 'surprise', 'ending', 'anything', 'most', 'us.Johansson', 'performance', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'who', 'were', 'wondering', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'level', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'obvious', 'film', 'recommend', 'Already', 'ample', 'evidence', 'Johansson', 'moved', 'accomplishments', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'who', 'apparently', 'gone', 'being', 'great', 'juvenile', 'talent', 'being', 'perilously', 'close', 'happened', 'territory', 'Travolta', 'character', 'playing', 'game', 'younger', 'housemates', 'are', 'fairly', 'esay', 'see', 'Macht', 'not', 'only', 'stuck', 'playing', 'third', 'fiddle', 'do', 'ostentatious', 'voice', 'overs', 'Consequently', 'are', 'couple', 'colorful', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'make', 'more', 'positive', 'impression', 'Johansson', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'one.Travolta', 'singing', 'film', 'mostly', 'traditional', 'folk', 'songs', 'Barbara', 'Allen', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Grayson', 'Capps', 'who', 'songs', 'are', 'context', 'story', 'written', 'Pursy', 'mother', 'perfect', 'sense', 'father', 'Everett', 'Capps', 'wrote', 'Off', 'Magazine', 'Street', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'least', 'think', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'heard', 'such', 'am', 'sure', 'See', 'Washboard', 'Lisa', 'Love', 'Song', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'Lorraine', 'Song', 'My', 'Heart', 'Was', 'Lonely', 'Hunter', 'considerably', 'less', 'sure', 'Alabama', 'Shuffle', 'Slidell', 'important', 'thing', 'here', 'songs', 'are', 'rather', 'incidental', 'action', 'are', 'important', 'story', 'Capps', 'work', 'same', 'sort', 'effective', 'role', 'John', 'Cafferty', 'did', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'take', 'de', 'facto', 'endorsement', 'soundtrack', 'then', 'go', 'right', 'ahead', 'songs', 'are', 'one', 'strong', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'worth', 'listening', 'few', 'more', 'times']",N/A
887259,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0007Q6VY6,Lee Armstrong,"[9, 9]","My experience of the DVD ""Love Song for Bobby Long"" was a welcome and joyful one.  New screenwriter Shainee Gabel did a good job of adapting Ronald Everett Capps' novel ""Off Magazine Street"" for the screen.  Some reviewers objected to the long Gabriel Macht voiceovers, but I thought they gave the film individuality and a lyrical appeal.  For me, one of the highlights was the excellent performance of Macht who I watched for a season on the short-lived TV series ""The Others"" & in the film ""The Recruit.""  The scene by the fire where he fills in Pursy on his part in Bobby Long's tragedy was an intense & memorable screen moment.  I also greatly enjoyed Canadian Deborah Kara Unger as the waitress in Sam Shepard's diner in the DVD ""Leo"" & was glad to see her in this show.  (I missed her in ""White Noise."")  As the bartender who allows herself to be Macht's girlfriend even though he's not in love with her, she hits so many levels.  In the deleted scenes, some of her best moments rested on the cutting room floor as Lawson Pines (Macht) tells her goodnight in the rain.  While addressing the supporting characters, Claye Crawford does a nice appearance as Lee, the trailer part trash boyfriend, who seems threatening and self-centered in his brief appearances.  He had a brief appearance as a helicopter pilot in another Travolta film, ""Basic.""Of the two main stars, Scarlett Johansson delivers another outstanding performance as the sometimes gritty, sometimes stubborn, sometimes insecure Pursy.  She has the star quality to carry a picture and does so admirably in this flick.  John Travolta as Bobby Long turns in a journeyman performance as the alcoholic professor whose personal tragedy left him unable to recover.  Perhaps a stronger directorial hand could have wrenched an even finer performance, but Travolta does a good job.  The music added greatly to film.  This is an excellent evening's entertainment.

This movie is so much better than the book!!!

The movie's Lawson (aka Byron) is a much younger, much more grounded non-perv, but he still drank too much. Gabriel Macht's take on the character is so much better than the character in the book. He made the movie for me! The same for Scarlett J's character Hanna (Pursy in the movie). Scarlett made her character so much more likable.Glad I bought this on DVD! I LOVED Lawson's reaction to seeing Pursy getting ready for her date and he kindly told her that the dress zipper needs to stay up.

I think John Travolta is miscast here.  He's no Southern professor fallen low,  Come on.  This is Vinny Barberino we're talking about here. Gabriel Macht does a good job.  I got the sense that he was crossing and uncrossing his legs the entire film.  He desired Scarlett Johansson; in fact I have to say that his subdued performance with little to work with other than occasional quotations from dead authors, well he did okay.Johansson has gotten all the ing&eacute;nue parts that directors can throw at her.  I saw her in Lost In Translation, In Good Company, and Girl with the Pearl Earring. She does nothing for me, but I have a buddy that thinks she's sexy.

Pursy (played by Johansson) is brought to New Orleans by the death of her mother.  There she meets all of her mother's friends including former English professor Bobby Long (played by Travolta) and his former student Lawson Pines (played by Macht).At once I felt drawn in to the world of Pursy's mother and with each introduction to a friend I wanted to know more.  This is also a coming of age movie as Pursy struggles to define herself as she becomes an adult.

It is not often that I am sorry to see a movie end, but in this case I was.

Screenwriter and director Shainee Gabel pulls strongly on Tennessee Williams', ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" feel of yesterday, for the perfect blend of the city in despair.This is the picture-perfect setting for all the characters to inhabit, as it parallels themselves first. Purslane Hominy Will (Scarlett Johansson) starts from a dire place in a broken down mobile home in Florida, living with a slimy boyfriend Lee (Clayne Crawford).  She receives a letter concerning Lorraine's death, the mother that abandoned her and left her with her Grandmother to raise at a very young age.Circumstances advance her to New Orleans to attend the funeral and arriving a day too late.  Pursy goes to Lorraine's home to be met by the two friends of her late mother who are living in the house supposedly by invitation. Bobby Long (John Travolta) along with his cohort and personal biographer of nine years Lawson Pines (Gabriel Macht), are living in a state of complete drunken disarray.Bobby Long and Lawson live in a community wrapped around the memory of Lorraine, who is elevated to a place of requiring her own following. Lorraine led a drug and booze infused life in the entertainment business and had made quite a beloved name for herself unbeknownst to Pursy.  Lorraine's life of song is reflected throughout this movie.The story unfolds slowly as Pursy, Bobby Long and Lawson have to learn  how to live together in this broken down place. Pursy has a strong backbone and refuses to leave while Bobby is forever trying to push her away.  She is a young woman who never finished high school although is intelligent beyond her years.With the set-up being simplistic, Gabel is duly able to dispense all the necessary elements to this piece. A moody and Blues filled original music score by Grayson Capps and Trina Shoemaker track her effort.  The cinematography swells a humid and totally atmospheric New Orleans.  From drenching rainy days, colorful floral garden beds to the lush green riverside: it's a standout.One of my favorite movies is this study of Purslane, Bobby Long and Lawson in need of their own personal redemption.

The explanation begins with the death of a matriarch named Lorraine who during her hard lived life enchanted a wealth of misfit men. Lorraine is the mother of estranged daughter, Pursy (Scarlett Johansson) who shows up to claim her portion of a dilapidated house with similar inhabitants. Pursy finds herself a roommate to both Bobby and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, writer Lawson Pines (Gabriel Macht). The relationship is strained to say the least between the lost young woman and the two un-ambitious lugs that she waits hand and foot on without knowing exactly why. Stories about Lorraine emerge through bar-hopping oral histories and memories spewed forth between alcoholic fogs. But through a somewhat restless process all of the mysteries fall into place and become familiar.This film is so pretty to watch filled with colorful characters and scenery against the artistic backdrop of New Orleans, the city becomes a character within itself. You can feel the heat as the characters struggle to find their way but there is almost always something beautiful to capture your eye. Scarlett Johansson is wonderful as the confused young woman who searches for answers about herself and her family. She haunts the screen with her luminous innocence and captures the character with perfect honesty. Travolta seems mis-cast at first as the aged and ailing Bobby Long but once he begins to spout the legendary prose of Eliot, Frost and all the others he captures the true essence of Bobby Long. Lurking quietly behind Travolta and Johansson is Gabriel Macht, as the talented yet sluggish Lawson Pines.

I've never been a big Travolta fan, but I did enjoy him in this. His southern accent isn't bad, and it's nice to see him looking old and grey haired and ill for a change. I think Scarlett Johanson is even better, though. She quite a natural actor with an unusual, flawed beauty. She doesn't overdo the Southerness, but speaks with just enough inflection that you believe she's who she's supposed to be. The movie does tie things up sort of neatly by the end, redemption and peace all around, but that's okay. It didn't sing to me, and yet I do find it a competent movie, humrorous at times and certainly worth your time.",4,Three and a half stars,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,745,"['pretty', 'good', 'not', 'smashing', 'great', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'premise', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'Travolta', 'fan', 'did', 'enjoy', 'southern', 'accent', ""n't"", 'bad', 'nice', 'see', 'looking', 'old', 'grey', 'haired', 'ill', 'change', 'think', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'even', 'better', 'quite', 'natural', 'actor', 'unusual', 'flawed', 'beauty', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'Southerness', 'just', 'enough', 'inflection', 'believe', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'sort', 'neatly', 'end', 'redemption', 'peace', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'sing', 'yet', 'do', 'find', 'competent', 'movie', 'humrorous', 'times', 'certainly', 'time']",N/A

It's kind of slow for the first hour, and it's a intense dialogue-driven film that gradually builds up to a very moving and wonderful climax. It's certaintly John Travolta's best work in recent years. Unfortunately, it's also a very little seen film. Scarlett Johansson is superb playing heavy scenes opposite Travolta and Gabriel Macht. Deborah Kara Unger is wonderful in a supporting role as a bartentress.Pursy(Johansson) made a trip to New Orleans from Florida upon being informed that her estranged mother has died. She was late to the funeral. She stayed in her mother's house lived by her mother's ex-lover Bobby Long(Travolta) and long time buddy Lawson Pines(Gabriel Macht). Bobby is in very bad shape both physically and emotionally. He is an alcoholic at a near-wreckage stage. He used to be a successful professor, but he failed in his personal life. He's trying to let go of his past mistakes and enjoy the remain of his life. Pursy is very judgemental of Bobby for being a drunk and talks too much crap. She wanted no involvement with him, but her mother left part of the ownership of the house to him. They seem to clash a great deal, but she soon discover a secret that was in her mother's letters written to her, but have never been mailed.....John Travolta looked very different here in white hair, and very emaciated. The scene when he urinated blood, and started to cry in the arms of Pursy was very moving. Gabriel Macht was mesmerizing when he talked about the traumatic events that changed and damaged Bobby Long. Scarlett Johansson's performance is even better than Girl With A Pearl Earring and Lost In Translation.Overall, this movie is about family ties, friendship, redemption, and forgiveness. If you let it, it will move you tears by the ending. The performances are definitely more worthwhile than the actual story of this film.",4,Very Touching Performances from Travolta and Johansson.,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,1930,"['Love', 'Song', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'small', 'quite', 'film', 'big', 'heart', 'kind', 'slow', 'first', 'hour', 'intense', 'dialogue-driven', 'film', 'gradually', 'up', 'very', 'moving', 'wonderful', 'climax', 'certaintly', 'John', 'Travolta', 'best', 'work', 'recent', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'seen', 'film', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'superb', 'playing', 'heavy', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'Travolta', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'role', 'bartentress.Pursy', 'Johansson', 'made', 'trip', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Florida', 'being', 'informed', 'estranged', 'mother', 'died', 'was', 'late', 'funeral', 'stayed', 'mother', 'house', 'lived', 'mother', 'ex-lover', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'Travolta', 'long', 'time', 'buddy', 'Lawson', 'Pines', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'Bobby', 'very', 'bad', 'shape', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'alcoholic', 'near-wreckage', 'stage', 'used', 'be', 'successful', 'professor', 'failed', 'personal', 'life', 'trying', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'mistakes', 'enjoy', 'remain', 'life', 'Pursy', 'very', 'judgemental', 'Bobby', 'being', 'drunk', 'talks', 'too', 'much', 'crap', 'wanted', 'involvement', 'mother', 'left', 'part', 'ownership', 'house', 'seem', 'clash', 'great', 'deal', 'soon', 'discover', 'secret', 'was', 'mother', 'letters', 'written', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'mailed', '..John', 'Travolta', 'looked', 'very', 'different', 'here', 'white', 'hair', 'very', 'emaciated', 'scene', 'when', 'urinated', 'blood', 'started', 'cry', 'arms', 'Pursy', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'when', 'talked', 'traumatic', 'events', 'changed', 'damaged', 'Bobby', 'Long', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'performance', 'even', 'better', 'Girl', 'A', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'Lost', 'Translation.Overall', 'movie', 'family', 'ties', 'friendship', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'let', 'will', 'move', 'tears', 'ending', 'performances', 'are', 'definitely', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'actual', 'story', 'film']",N/A
