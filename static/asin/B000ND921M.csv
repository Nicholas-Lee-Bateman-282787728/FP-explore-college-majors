1055981,ACX8YW2D5EGP6,B000ND921M,"Alexandra Stephens ""dreamgirl0922""","[4, 4]",Okay let me just start my review here by saying that this season surprised me. After the end of the 5th season i was sure that this show wasnt going to go anywhere but it surprised me. With Jackie and Hyde getting back together the way that they did. And then Eric and Donna planning their wedding. Then finding out that kelso got brooke pregnant at a molly hatchet concert. It was great. There were some down sides. Like how Eric left donna at the alter. How Kelso wasnt going to own up to his mistakes. The lose of the original Laurie. Things like that. But this was still an awesome season. One of the great episodes was when the christmas episode. When the gang goes back to high school for the dance with Jackie and the guys have this slow part where they walk in the gym to the song TNT by AC/DC. It's awesome. The end of this season was also wonderful. When you find out that Bud really isnt Hyde's father.To summarize i think that if you are a true 70's show fan you need to get this season because this is the second to the last true 70's show season. We like to think taht season 8 doesnt exist.

1055982,A1U98MDTZB55LY,B000ND921M,Cassie,"[0, 0]","i've watched that 70's show from begining to end. i love the whole series except for how they ended up Jackie's love interest. I won't spoil it for anyone but it was not the right guy!!!! anyway i have seasons 1-5 and i came to amazon for season 6. i have to throw a warning out here now. if you are someone who likes packaging, and you have previous seasons (original packaging), you have to be careful which dvd set you order. the one amazon has for sale (by MILLER CREEK STUDIOS) is some new cheaper packaging that came out, which is 3 dvd's instead of 4, and is in a plastic regular dvd case. inside are the three dvd's (this is the part that i was really confused about). the dvd's are each inside a PAPER (yes paper) dvd sleeve. i dont know why they would ever come out with this kind of packaging but it's pretty cheap looking, unless you're someone who doesn't care about quality of packaging. Anyway, i sent that one back because i was pretty mad since i am a stickler for packaging to all be the same, and it was not described as having paper sleeves. i found this version (BY 20th CENTURY FOX) by a seller and am very pleased with it. it is the original packaging with cardboard outer case and the individual slim plastic cases inside. the old packaging used to have 4 dvd cases each with seperate dvd, but this one has 2 cases with 2 dvds in each. that is not the fault of the seller however, that is what 20th century fox changed the packaging to after season 5 (i don't know why they'd do that in the middle of a dvd series, but it's not that bad, still looks the same from the outside). all in all this is the orignal version and nicer packaging. even if it's a few dollars more, it's worth it to me. so for anyone ordering this, if you're into packaging, make sure you find out what you're getting. u can tell in the differences of the thumbnails bc this is how all of the seasons are. the one by amazon is different, although it still had all the episodes on it, i personally didn't want paper dvd sleeves lol good luck to you all!",5,LOVE THAT 70's SHOW!,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,2048,"['i', ""'ve"", 'watched', '70', 'show', 'begining', 'end', 'i', 'love', 'whole', 'series', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'Jackie', 'love', 'interest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'guy', 'anyway', 'i', 'have', 'seasons', '1-5', 'i', 'came', 'amazon', 'season', '6.', 'i', 'have', 'throw', 'warning', 'out', 'here', 'now', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'packaging', 'have', 'previous', 'seasons', 'original', 'packaging', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'dvd', 'set', 'order', 'one', 'amazon', 'sale', 'MILLER', 'CREEK', 'STUDIOS', 'new', 'cheaper', 'packaging', 'came', 'out', '3', 'dvd', 'instead', '4', 'plastic', 'regular', 'dvd', 'case', 'inside', 'are', 'three', 'dvd', 'part', 'i', 'was', 'really', 'confused', 'dvd', 'are', 'PAPER', 'yes', 'paper', 'dvd', 'sleeve', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'why', 'would', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'kind', 'packaging', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'looking', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'quality', 'packaging', 'Anyway', 'i', 'sent', 'one', 'back', 'i', 'was', 'pretty', 'mad', 'i', 'am', 'stickler', 'packaging', 'be', 'same', 'was', 'not', 'described', 'having', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'i', 'found', 'version', 'BY', '20th', 'CENTURY', 'FOX', 'seller', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'original', 'packaging', 'cardboard', 'outer', 'case', 'individual', 'slim', 'plastic', 'cases', 'old', 'packaging', 'used', 'have', '4', 'dvd', 'cases', 'seperate', 'dvd', 'one', '2', 'cases', '2', 'dvds', 'not', 'fault', 'seller', 'however', 'what', '20th', 'century', 'fox', 'changed', 'packaging', 'season', '5', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""'d"", 'do', 'middle', 'dvd', 'series', 'not', 'bad', 'still', 'same', 'outside', 'orignal', 'version', 'nicer', 'packaging', 'even', 'few', 'dollars', 'more', 'worth', 'so', 'anyone', 'ordering', ""'re"", 'packaging', 'make', 'sure', 'find', 'out', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'u', 'can', 'tell', 'differences', 'thumbnails', 'how', 'seasons', 'are', 'one', 'amazon', 'different', 'still', 'had', 'episodes', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'paper', 'dvd', 'sleeves', 'lol', 'good', 'luck']",That '70s Show: Season 6

It was one of the best shows Fox ever aired... will there ever be another Kitty or another Fez?But I DO fault Fox or Carsey-Werner for the extreme packaging rip-off with this, Season 6.  The last 5 seasons have all been 4 DVDs.  Each DVD was in a separate slipcase.  With Season 6, there are only two separate slipcases... 2 DVDs are in each slipcase.I know this is a little thing but I take great pride in displaying my hundreds of TV-episode DVD packages.  Why did Fox make this change with only 3 more seasons to get to market?  Surely this saves them only a few pennies.  I would have gladly paid to have the full, nice packaging, even if Season 6 cost another bucks or two.  Very, very disappointed with Fox.  (Of course, they are the ones who screwed around with Mary Tyler Moore, Bob Newhart, and Dynasty.  Thankfully now Paramount is bringing out more Dynasty.)(The same thing happened with Moonlighting - not a Fox show.  But seasons 1 - 4 had such nice packaging, and then season 5 was in cheap packaging.

1055990,A2CYWAKMIATB56,B000ND921M,"Leopold Stotch ""Butters""","[22, 24]","It was tough to watch this show at the start of season 6. Laurie had married Fez at the end of season 5 and all hell had broken loose. Red had a heart attack. THis was going to be an integral part of the sixth season. But lo, and behold. THey had to change it because the part of Laurie will now be played by Christina Moore instead of Lisa Robin Kelly. I was ready to give up on the show. But the writers muddled through somehow, by minimalizing Laurie's involvement and focusing more on the Red-Fez dynamic and Fez's desire to become an american citizen. Once they did that, I was satiated. Crisis averted.Another aspect I enjoyed was the sense of impending doom with the gang. Kelso went off to police academy after he knocked up a hot librarian (and in typical Kelso fashion botched both with disasterous results), Eric and Donna set a date to get married, all the while expressing their doubts and fears about whether it was the right thing to do, and Hyde and Jackie got back together, but kept sparring over the direction of their relationship. Most of these storylines would have longlasting effects on the characters and the directions their lives would ultimately take. This season is the one where they became adults, more or less.And of course, who could forget Pam, Jackie's mom, hooking up with Bob? This was one of the better twists of the season, as it really forced Donna and Jackie to kind of set aside their feelings towards the others parent and work together to pry them apart without getting anyone hurt.Overall, it was a good season. Not the best. But still solid. THe best season, IMHO, would be season 3, due mostly to Dine and Dash, and the breakup of eric and donna. But still, what a show. I sorely miss it, and wish Topher Grace had not gotten that part in SPider Man 3.

I would recommend upgrading to a basic flip-tray case for about $2.==Audio/Video==The DVDs look and sound great. The presentation suffers a bit (I'd say 8.5-9/10) due to Mill Creek putting 8 or 9 episodes onto each disc, but it's not a deal breaker (for me, anyway).

Mill Creek's DVD release of Season 6 contains all 25 episodes in true 16:9 transfers.

My favorite character is Eric and he is extremely nerdy in this one, especially with his nerd fight with Mitch. Fez is hilarious when it comes to interacting with Red. Hyde is always the cool cat who you'd want to grab a beer with, and Kelso, well he's Kelso. The only complaint about this season is with the Laurie casting choice. Christina Moore's panties pale in comparison to Robin Kelly's devilish grin, but that doesn't take away from another great season of a great show that I love to watch religiously. Might I add I'm pleased at the condition of the package and will enjoy this season along with any friends and family that want to join in and visit Eric's basement.

Season 6 is an excellent season, I don't think it was one of the best seasons or a high point of the show in particular but it's an enjoyable one and has its share of great moments. Season 6 can be looked at as a turning point for this show, some things changed and will change during this season as with all others but it remains the show we love.I'll start by saying that having a different actor play the role of Laurie after 5 seasons was disappointing to fans and turned out to be the low point of season 6. This ""new"" Laurie is almost nothing like the old; she's very different and has nothing on the real Laurie. Fans have to understand that they couldn't get the actress who originally played her character to do season 6 and that Laurie's wedding cliffhanger at the end of season 5 just couldn't be ignored and they had to replace her. In this season we see what happens after Fez and Laurie's wedding, Bob has to choose between Pam and Midge, Red deals with a previous heart attack, we learn that Hyde's father is not who he thought he was and Red and Fez spend more time together for our viewing enjoyment. Not to forget that Eric and Donna take their relationship to the next level by getting engaged...and did I mention Kelso getting a girl pregnant?Yes, there's definitely a lot going on in season 6! I'd say that the chemistry between Red and Fez during this season was great, they were so good together and it made for many funny moments! Season 6 is where the gang become more adult and have to make important choices, Kelso goes to police academy, Eric and Donna get engaged, Eric is staying home and Donna is about to go to college. Don't worry just because the characters are more mature doesn't mean it's not That 70's Show anymore, the show is still as funny as usual and if you're a fan you won't be disappointed. The season 6 DVD release has a few small special features as well; there are two commentaries by the director on two episodes, promo spots, a season six in six minutes featurette and two featurettes on Debra Joe Rupp (Kitty) and Kurtwood Smith (Red). Those 25 episodes are sure I'll give season 6 four stars, it's not the best season in the history of the show but it's a very good one and is certainly not the worst.",4,Still Groovin',1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,2479,"['70', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'shows', 'when', 'aired', 'so', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'shows', 'have', 'power', 'have', 'impact', 'reason', 'how', 'feel', '70', 'show', 'Season', '6', 'excellent', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'high', 'point', 'show', 'particular', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'share', 'great', 'moments', 'Season', '6', 'can', 'be', 'looked', 'turning', 'point', 'show', 'things', 'changed', 'will', 'change', 'season', 'others', 'show', 'love.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'having', 'different', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'Laurie', '5', 'seasons', 'was', 'disappointing', 'fans', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'low', 'point', 'season', '6', 'new', 'Laurie', 'almost', 'nothing', 'old', 'very', 'different', 'nothing', 'real', 'Laurie', 'Fans', 'have', 'understand', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'actress', 'who', 'originally', 'played', 'character', 'do', 'season', '6', 'Laurie', 'wedding', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'season', '5', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'had', 'replace', 'season', 'see', 'what', 'Fez', 'Laurie', 'wedding', 'Bob', 'choose', 'Pam', 'Midge', 'Red', 'previous', 'heart', 'attack', 'learn', 'Hyde', 'father', 'not', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'Red', 'Fez', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'together', 'viewing', 'enjoyment', 'Not', 'forget', 'Eric', 'Donna', 'take', 'relationship', 'next', 'level', 'getting', 'engaged', 'did', 'mention', 'Kelso', 'getting', 'girl', 'pregnant', 'Yes', 'definitely', 'lot', 'going', 'season', '6', ""'d"", 'say', 'chemistry', 'Red', 'Fez', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'together', 'made', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'Season', '6', 'where', 'gang', 'become', 'more', 'adult', 'have', 'make', 'important', 'choices', 'Kelso', 'police', 'academy', 'Eric', 'Donna', 'get', 'engaged', 'Eric', 'staying', 'home', 'Donna', 'go', 'college', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'just', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'mature', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', '70', 'Show', 'anymore', 'show', 'still', 'as', 'funny', 'usual', ""'re"", 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'season', '6', 'DVD', 'release', 'few', 'small', 'special', 'features', 'well', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', 'director', 'two', 'episodes', 'promo', 'spots', 'season', 'six', 'six', 'minutes', 'featurette', 'two', 'featurettes', 'Debra', 'Joe', 'Rupp', 'Kitty', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'Red', '25', 'episodes', 'are', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'give', 'season', '6', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'history', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst']",That '70s Show: Season 6
