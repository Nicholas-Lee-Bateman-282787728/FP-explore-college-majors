Well written dialogue and story as Alec Baldwin plays the role he's been stereotyped in: the bad guy who isn't totally bad.  The ambiguity of  the final portion left me confused as to what was happening in Hopkin's  character's mind.  Why would he care about Baldwin's character?  The film  is frought with cryptic references and a soul-searching undercurrent during  the fight for survival in Alaskan wilderness.Finally, the bear is  really what the meat of the film seems to be about.  The exciting terror of  outwitting a bear before he has you for dinner.  All else is a bit of  an ill concieved 2nd plot, though the whole effort is worth seeing.

I had intended to go and see it but decided to wait until next week... Thankfully I was able to rent it out on laserdisc and was hooked.Edge of the seat entertainment indeed! Bart the Bear should have been  given an oscar for best supporting actor - certainly he was a lot better  than a lot of other film stars in other films.This is a fine film which  I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to watch a good taut thriller  with some good characters. I get the feeling that some people see the name  &quot;Elle McPherson&quot; and expect either a dumb movie so don't watch it  or they expect lots of gratuitous sex and are disappointed. Its such a  shame that her name is so prominent in the credits as she only appears for  a short time, the film is dominated by the excellent performances of  Hopkins and Baldwin. I certainly agree with one previous reviewer that one  of the most shocking and powerful scenes has to be the character who falls  prey to the bear.On another note, I loved the scenery. This is a great  film, I can't compliment it enough. Watch it, buy it, love it.This is an  excellent transfer, with very good sound.

159446,AMICVV9N2U2R4,0793927501,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[3, 4]","I may like the untactically-named The Edge for the wrong or right reasons. Be it wrong or right, whatever these reasons are, they have yielded powerful results. This is a movie that has practically dominated me for over ten years now. It scares me still to think of it; it yields such a powerful, personal, emotional impact that I definitely think twice before watching. This may sound misleading, as it implies that the movie as a whole moves me. But it doesn't. As a matter of fact, aside from the main factors that make me like this survival thriller very much, which I shall get to in a moment, the movie feels too 'slow'. It lacks a balance - because the opposite end of that scale is heavy as a set of weights.What have we here? This certainly unique Lee Tamahori picture, script written by David Mamet, centres around two diverse personalities; multi-millionaire Charles Morse and fashion photographer Robert Green. Charles (Anthony Hopkins) is a rather secluded, awkwardly philosophical tycoon, married to fashion model Mickey (Elle Macpherson), while Robert (Alec Baldwin) is an ambitious while rather short-tempered man who's not all what he seems. The two find themselves in the Alaskan wilderness, staying with a darkly philosophical cabin keeper. When Charles and Robert go with assistant photographer Stephen (Harold Perrineau) to take a session with a local hunter, their plane crashes and they are the only survivors, with nothing to rely on for survival but one another. Charles, being the clear-thinking one, assumes the role of leader, and throughout the film, especially after Stephen dies, his and Robert's personalities clash, climaxing in their ultimate confrontation towards the end of the film.Interesting as it sounds, this dominating plot element would in my opinion have been more gripping had the pace been fixed. True, one extremely positive aspect about The Edge is the breathtakingly beautiful vista of the Alaskan wilderness, excellently captured by New Zealander Lee Tamahori. Still, it seems he sometimes went overboard with the vista and the result is an overload of scenes where the characters just walk and converse. I like interesting dialogue, but the tension seems to get lost in-between these drawn-out scenes.So far, not so good, you may deduce. It doesn't sound as though I like this movie at all. Why do I give it a full house? As I said, I like The Edge for personal reasons, and possibly the reasons most people will remember this movie for. Those are the riveting and almost achingly haunting highlights of this movie; the encounters with the bear.Excellently acted by the already humbling Bart the Bear, late bear actor extraordinaire, an enormous Kodiak bear becomes an ever-present threat to the party of three (and eventually two). The bear, who has a great liking for human flesh (Hollywood logic but all for the benefit of this film), relentlessly pursues them, eventually plunging the main characters into despair and hopelessness, as he is more than a match for all of them. It is thanks to this bear that the movie gets a rush of blood into it.Even though it may sound like it, this is not the typical animal-attack clich&eacute; so many B-movies are made of. None of the bear scenes, extreme though all are, cross the line as overdone. They all feel extremely believable, which makes them really chilling. ""Savage"" is definitely the word for them, and yet the bear doesn't come across as a mindless killer. His intelligence is heavily underlined, which is important, because without a sense of kinship, no sense of thrill would be aroused. The Kodiak bear's great liking for human flesh is informed to the audience by the cabin keeper before all of this takes place, and is a vital piece of information to lay the foundation for, as well as strengthen the intensity of, the encounters with the bear.The bear only appears four times during the course of this two-hour flick, and he makes you forgive its drawn-out pace. The first time when he appears, coming across the main characters in the forest and immediately setting his eye on them, his presence is immediately registered upon the viewer. Lee Tamahori has every reason to be proud of Bart the bear, going so far as calling him ""the John Wayne of bear actors"". Bart comes across astonishingly realistic in the role of the fierce bear. Each shot serves its purpose; the acting, the movements and sounds Bart makes are all perfect. In the shot where the bear roars and attempts to strike Charles with his paw, foaming, I got the first real sense that ""Whoah, this bear means business."" No bear acting or perhaps animal acting as a whole has been this spot-on, in my opinon.Despite the often quite brutal scenes, beauty is almost ever present. This is even true for the second of the bear's appearances, which may be one of the most hair-raising pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen. If Lee Tamahori's reputation of being able to capture both beauty and brutality at the same time ever takes off during this film, this is where. The bear attacks the wounded Stephen during a thunderstorm, and despite valiant attempts made by Charles to stop him, the bear succeeds, almost effortlessly, in killing the helpless photographer. The bear is so frighteningly strong and Stephen's sheer terror so believable (Perrineau should have been nominated for an Oscar; I have never seen such terror radiate from a man's face in a film before or since) that I cannot keep my heart from racing during those few minutes the attack lasts before it's all over. Yet, and amazingly, the entire scene is astonishingly beautiful, extremely brutal as it is, so one is left torn over what one should be left feeling.The bear's surprise re-appearance later couldn't have been more spot-on, in my opinion. The way he just stands and growls at Charles, before taking off after him, is one of those movie moments that will haunt me forever. And then when he appears for the last time, in a deadly confrontation between him and the remaining two survivors, his threatening presence is absolutely perfect.Where would this movie be without the bear? I don't know; I never bother to watch any other part of it but Bart's scenes. Apart from the bear, the movie is too slow even for my liking, consisting of too much open space and too long stretches of time where nothing happens. Still, because eventually something does happen, and very much so, it can be forgiving. The bear becomes someone you wait for during the entire movie; a villain you root for. Still, despite his villainous role, I for one like him very much. That's typical of especially cartoon villains, who seduce you with their charisma. The bear certainly possesses charisma, no doubt about that. And it is only this charisma, in my opinion, which keeps one from feeling a sense of waste after watching The Edge. If you want to see possibly the best bear acting ever caught on film (Bart should have received an award for it), by all means see this. Just don't except much else.",5,Top-Notch Bear-Acting Saves the Day,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,7023,"['may', 'like', 'untactically-named', 'Edge', 'wrong', 'right', 'reasons', 'Be', 'wrong',

159449,ALR35EFI69S5R,0793927501,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[22, 26]","When famed writer David Mamet turns his attention to the fascinating subject of man's nature and his struggle to survive in the wilderness, the likelihood is that a fascinating movie will result. And with this depiction of a small group of men, including a reclusive and introspective fifty-something tycoon (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a shifty and conniving fashion photographer (Alec Baldwin), Mamet sets the stage for a mammoth struggle for the survival of the fittest as he pits the men against both a wily Kodiak bear as well as against each other. The other members of the stranded party is killed by the bear in quick fashion, leaving only Hopkins and Baldwin try to improvise some way to figure out how to get back to civilization and outrun this bear with an appetite for humans.There are a number of subplots running through the action sequences, and a number of plot twists that serve to illustrate that it isn't necessarily the strongest that survive so much as it is the smartest and most adaptable of the antagonists. Yet this is not merely a testosterone-enriched script, for there are a number of elements in the story that lend themselves to viewing the characters (including the bear) with compassion and understanding of the complex ways in which the way we behave both actively and indirectly influences our chances at surviving.In the midst of all this action and plot activity remains the singular beauty of the landscape, and in all their travails the characters are consistently outshadowed by the sheer scope of the topography, climate and setting of the great Alaskan wilderness.  It is almost as if the director is suggesting we get ourselves sand our petty personal concerns in context and perspective, and seen against the shadow of the great outdoors, their troubles seem much smaller and more manageable indeed. This is a great movie, a film with a great story, interesting dialogue, and a terrific ensemble of actors supporting the thrust of the tale.

159451,A2582KMXLK2P06,0793927501,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Wow, and to think I already knew that Anthony Hopkins is a genius actor and probably one of the best actors of our generation.  Now he takes his role to a whole new level as he and Alec Baldwin are stranded in the wilderness of Alaska surrounded by mountains after their plane goes down, and they have to fend for themselves.  More specifically making sure they keep their distance from a dangerous bear tracking their every movements.  This movie does suspense VERY well.The actual bear chases are quite suspenseful and not as cheesy or as silly as they usually tend to be.  These particular chases lure you in and keep you interested in how the guys plan their escape route.  I could probably nitpick over a few things- such as after the plane crashed none of the men had a scratch on them even though the pilot was killed, or that it didn't make sense that the men lit a match to start a fire even though they just swam out of a nearby lake and thus, their matches should have been soaking wet.  Otherwise the story does a remarkable job showing two men escaping from a bear.This movie is really spectacular.  We've all seen several ""stranded in Alaska"" movies before, but this one is exceptionally good.  Expect a good chunk of the storytelling to focus on finding a way home.  It's not just all about a bear hunting down men.  Anthony Hopkins does a tremendous job playing the calm, logical and rational guy whenever Alec Baldwin thinks a situation is hopeless.  The production is top notch, the quality of the storytelling with its smooth pace and easy to follow plot, and the acting -especially the acting- all create a phenomenal movie.  Of all stranded Alaskan movies I've watched, this one has the best acting of them all.  No doubt about it.  All because of Anthony Hopkins.Also expect more to the storyline other than survival.  There's a conniving conflict/secret between Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins related to Anthony's wife and the fact that Anthony is a millionaire- expect the wife to play a role as well without hardly being shown on camera throughout the movie other than in the beginning and end- you'll see what I mean.

I thought the bear scenes were a bit cheesy, especially when the bear lands on a spear wielded by 70-something Anthony Hopkins. Baldwin is his usual smarmy self.

Also, I laughed out loud when they appear in perfectly tailored bear skins after slaying the bear. How did they sew them together? The skins, freshly removed from a dead bear, would have been soaking wet with blood and gore for days or weeks, in reality. The David Mamet dialogue is pretty good in parts.

I find myself regularly wanting to go back and look at it. If you like survival movies, this is one of the best I have ever seen. If you like great acting, cinematography, and music, here you have it. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin are both magnificent as rich boss and executive going on an adventure photo expedition in Alaska. When Hopkins finds out that photographer Baldwin is having an affair with his model wife it gets frosty between them. While taking a flight together their bush plane crashes in a remote area and they must find their way back to civilization. When a huge bear attacks them and follows them relentlessly the priorities change and who is the real survivor is left open till the last few minutes. You may find yourself frightened by how effective this bear is in the movie. You will certainly feel you know what it is like to be attacked by a bear after it is over. Hopkin's and Baldwin's mental and physical abilities are tested to the edge. Irony abounds as the stronger younger man may not be the best suited to a hostile environment. Great movie and one I highly recommend.Blu-ray Addendum:  I just got my Blu-ray version 4/12/2013.  The picture and sound are superior and any fan that has the DVD should get the Blu-ray version.

Not a frequently visited genre anymore, and strangely after this movie (it wasnt a hit) because this pretty much covers the philosophical, primal struggle of man in the wilderness. Not much left to cover on the subject. Top notch writing from Mamet with near every other line quotable, career peak acting from Hopkins and Baldwin (before he switched into permanent Jack Donaghey mode), Jerry Goldsmith's chilling response to John Williams' Jaws score and Tamahori's absolute best directing effort of his spotty career.If you haven't seen The Edge because it always looked like two dudes in a Hemmingway impression fight to the death, than you have been missing a great film.

The flick is outstanding on virtually every level: cinematography, acting, suspense, score, locations, etc.Three men get stranded in the remote Northwest wilderness. The plane crash that causes this predicament has got to be the best such scene ever filmed -- it looked very real. Although nature itself presents some harrowing dangers for these men (especially in the form of a kodiak bear), two of them find out that their biggest danger is HUMAN nature -- in the form of covetousness, adultery, greed and murder.Anthony Hopkins stars as an intellectual billionaire who is insecure about his accumulated wealth of (seemingly useless) knowledge, his money and his beautiful model wife played by Elle MacPherson. He's not sure who he can trust, or who is really his friend just for the sake of such. He's a bit paranoid that people will naturally assume his sexy wife married him just for his money. And he suspects that she's having a fling with her photographer, played by Alec Baldwin.All this is the character backdrop to what is essentially a grand survival adventure. The entire mid-section of the film involves their encounter with the bear that stalks them. This chapter of the story could be called ""Claws"" (""Jaws"" with a bear). The men work themselves up into a savage frenzy in determination to kill the bear.

159489,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,0793927501,e. verrillo,"[4, 6]","I watched this movie mainly because the premise was good, the action gripping, the scenery breathtaking and it starred Anthony Hopkins. But as soon as I saw that the writer was David Mamet, I knew I was in for it.The plot is rather simple. A billionaire, Charles (Anthony Hopkins), and his wife's secret lover, Bob (Alec Baldwin), get stranded after a plane crash in Alaska. They must cooperate to stay alive, in spite of the fact that Bob is planning on killing Charles to get his wife/money. They decide to hike south to their last known location, but keep getting lost because they can't tell where south is. To complicate matters, they are being stalked by a man-eating bear which has acquired a taste for human flesh after eating a Rastafarian.That was the good part. The bad part was that the amazingly intelligent Charles could not figure out that what one does in this situation is find an open area, make a cross (or something identifiably man-made) with branches, and then keep a fire going nearby (they had matches). (Hey, when Tom Hanks was marooned, he figured all that stuff out--even without matches.) A continual fire would have provided warmth, smoke (for a signal) as well as protection from the bear.But given the assumption that clueless city folks could not come up with this simple strategy, even a rube like me can tell which way south is. The sun rises in the east (southeast during the winter) and sets in the west. Since it wasn't cloudy, it seems like the way south would have been obvious. Just look at the sun, or, if you don't want to go blind, a shadow will do.The stupidities continue. The bear stalks them because Bob doesn't obey orders to bury a blood-soaked rag. (He inexplicably hangs it in a tree, AFTER being informed that there are ""bear problems"" in these parts.) Later, Charles WALKS AROUND with a bloody rag on the end of a spear to lure the bear to a trap. Why not just wait, since the bear can sniff out the rag? Why get into a situation where you are forced to outrun a bear? (Impossible, by the way. Even though they did it several times.)Bob gets mauled in one scene, is miraculously healed in the next. Then he impales his leg on a rather large stake, which Charles pulls out the wrong way, but only leaves a little bitty hole. And, of course, Bob leaves a receipt for a watch given to him by Charles' wife (it's engraved with her name and Bob's) in a box containing a gift that Bob has given to Charles. (Obviously, he was thinking that Charles would never find it.) The very fact that Charles still has the box with its perfectly dry receipt after an airplane crash into a lake, falling into rapids, dangling over a chasm, and dashing through woods really stretches credibility. Seriously, people. What idiot wrote this screenplay?David Mamet, of course. Mamet is known for his pithy (i.e. empty) dialogue. ""It must be hard to be rich,"" muses Bob. ""You don't have any buddies."" (I'm paraphrasing. I can't bear to replay the scene.) ""How are you going to kill me?"" asks Charles. The dialogue went downhill from there, alternating between lame attempts at off-the-cuff wit, dull repetition (""Is that what you think? Is that what you think, huh? Is that what you think?"") and pure hysteria. The interminable ""We're gonna die out here!!!"" scenes resembled one of those stereotypical WWII movies in which some guy named ""Joey"" blubbers ""We're gonna die!!"" (and then gets blown up). Then someone else inevitably screams, ""They got Joey!!!"" (and then gets blown up). Mamet's writing isn't far off.On the bright side, Anthony Hopkins is always worth watching, no matter who writes his lines. And the bear was pretty good, too.",3,"Gripping action, beautiful scenery, but David Mamet can't write his way out of a paper bag",1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,3669,"['watched', 'movie', 'mainly', 'premise', 'was', 'good', 'action', 'gripping', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'starred', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'writer', 'was', 'David', 'Mamet', 'knew', 'was', 'it.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'simple', 'billionaire', 'Charles', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'wife', 'secret', 'lover', 'Bob', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'get', 'stranded', 'plane', 'crash', 'Alaska', 'must', 'cooperate', 'stay', 'alive', 'spite', 'fact', 'Bob', 'planning', 'killing', 'Charles', 'get', 'wife/money', 'decide', 'hike', 'south', 'last', 'known', 'location', 'keep', 'getting', 'lost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'south', 'complicate', 'matters', 'are', 'being', 'stalked', 'man-eating', 'bear', 'acquired', 'taste', 'human', 'flesh', 'eating', 'Rastafarian.That', 'was', 'good', 'part', 'bad', 'part', 'was', 'amazingly', 'intelligent', 'Charles', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'one', 'situation', 'open', 'area', 'make', 'cross', 'something', 'identifiably', 'man-made', 'branches', 'then', 'keep', 'fire', 'going', 'nearby', 'had', 'matches', 'Hey', 'when', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'marooned', 'figured', 'out', 'even', 'matches', 'continual', 'fire', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'warmth', 'smoke', 'signal', 'as', 'well', 'protection', 'bear.But', 'given', 'assumption', 'clueless', 'city', 'folks', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'simple', 'strategy', 'even', 'rube', 'can', 'tell', 'way', 'south', 'sun', 'east', 'southeast', 'winter', 'sets', 'west', 'was', ""n't"", 'cloudy', 'way', 'south', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'Just', 'look', 'sun', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'blind', 'shadow', 'will', 'do.The', 'stupidities', 'continue', 'bear', 'stalks', 'Bob', ""n't"", 'obey', 'orders', 'bury', 'blood-soaked', 'rag', 'inexplicably', 'tree', 'AFTER', 'being', 'informed', 'are', 'bear', 'problems', 'parts', 'Later', 'Charles', 'WALKS', 'AROUND', 'bloody', 'rag', 'end', 'spear', 'lure', 'bear', 'trap', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'wait', 'bear', 'can', 'sniff', 'out', 'rag', 'Why', 'get', 'situation', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'outrun', 'bear', 'Impossible', 'way', 'Even', 'did', 'several', 'times', 'Bob', 'mauled', 'one', 'scene', 'miraculously', 'healed', 'next', 'Then', 'leg', 'rather', 'large', 'stake', 'Charles', 'out', 'wrong', 'way', 'only', 'little', 'bitty', 'hole', 'course', 'Bob', 'receipt', 'watch', 'given', 'Charles', 'wife', 'engraved', 'name', 'Bob', 'box', 'containing', 'gift', 'Bob', 'given', 'Charles', 'Obviously', 'was', 'thinking', 'Charles', 'would', 'never', 'find', 'very', 'fact', 'Charles', 'still', 'box', 'perfectly', 'dry', 'receipt', 'airplane', 'crash', 'lake', 'falling', 'rapids', 'dangling', 'over', 'chasm', 'dashing', 'woods', 'really', 'stretches', 'credibility', 'Seriously', 'people', 'What', 'idiot', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Mamet', 'course', 'Mamet', 'known', 'pithy', 'i.e', 'empty', 'dialogue', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'be', 'rich', 'Bob', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'buddies', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'replay', 'scene', 'How', 'are', 'going', 'kill', 'Charles', 'dialogue', 'went', 'downhill', 'there', 'alternating', 'lame', 'attempts', 'off-the-cuff', 'wit', 'dull', 'repetition', 'what', 'think', 'what', 'think', 'huh', 'what', 'think', 'pure', 'hysteria', 'interminable', ""'re"", 'gon', 'die', 'out', 'here', 'scenes', 'resembled', 'one', 'stereotypical', 'WWII', 'movies', 'guy', 'named', 'Joey', 'blubbers', ""'re"", 'gon', 'die', 'then', 'blown', 'up', 'Then', 'someone', 'else', 'inevitably', 'screams', 'got', 'Joey', 'then', 'blown', 'up', 'Mamet', 'writing', ""n't"", 'far', 'off.On', 'bright', 'side', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'matter', 'who', 'lines', 'bear', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too']",N/A

Part character study, part adventure,I think this film works on both levels.  Anthony Hopkins, who I rarely find sympathetic, is very touching as the rich husband of a beautiful model played by ""beautiful model"", Elle Macpherson.  Alec Baldwin, co-stars as Macpherson's secret lover and a fellow wilderness refugee with Hopkins.  Baldwin gets to play himself (my opinion), charming and funny on the surface, but who's true character is selfish and dangerously hateful.The location shooting is breathtaking and the supporting cast give wonderful support, most notably (among the human actors), L.Q. Jones is dead on target as the lodge manager and ""would be"" entrepreneur.  However, the true star of the film is Bart the Bear, playing(?) a man eating Grizzly bear relentlessly focused on making a meal of the stranded airplane survivors. To those of you not familar with this legendary animal actor, Bart had significant roles in ""White Fang, among other adventure films, and a career making performance as the lead in ""The Bear"". He is absolutely on top of his game as the pursuer of our air crash survivors.  The film makers actually thank Bart and his trainer in the ending credits for making the film a reality.  In an industry where getting billing and credit is everything, that little thank you is saying a whole lot about a miracle animal actor.  This was Bart's last film, he died, too young, after the making of ""The Edge"".""The Edge"" is a serious work by a top writer, David Mamet, and a good film, made by professionals.

159500,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,0793927501,Haunted Flower,"[6, 6]","""The Edge"" was originally released in 1997 and is now being treated in the high-definition Blu-Ray style we are becoming accustomed to. It was directed by Lee Tamahori who later went on to more action-y films like ""Die Another Day"" and ""xXx: State of the Union."" It was written by David Mamet, brilliant playwright and screenwriter who also wrote ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" five years earlier featuring Alec Baldwin. The story is that of billionaire Charles Morse played by Anthony Hopkins coming with his model wife Mickey Morse played by Elle Macpherson to Alaska for a photo shoot with photographer Bob Green played by Alec Baldwin and his assistant Stephen played by Harold Perrineau (whom you might know now as Michael from ""LOST""). When the men go off in a plane in search of that perfect shot, it crashes and they are forced to struggle to survive in the wilderness over 80 miles from where they began lost in the woods.What this movie has works in spades. First you have the location which is perfect. Then there is the writing and development of two main characters whose layers peel away like an onion when put to the test in survival mode. The direction and chosen camera angles build up the suspense in an amazing way. There are close-ups and angles used where you can only see one character in the shot and you are convinced that something is going to come up behind them or the person they are talking to any second. Most of the time it doesn't, but when it does....WOW!Having Anthony Hopkins' stony disposition at the forefront gives an aura of experience hardly any man can match and Alec Baldwin looks almost foolish occasionally by comparison. Hopkins has a gift for being mysterious and eccentric while flashing the slightest of occasional smiles to appear human (or creepy). The character Charles is a genius of sorts picking up facts wherever he goes and retaining them, and claims to hardly ever put them to use. He is put to the test here in the ultimate survival situation in the middle of nowhere dealing with injuries, a giant bear, weather, and the men in his company losing their cool. There is particular tension between Charles and Bob over a woman. Alec Baldwin attempts to pull out all the stops by cracking jokes, having a mental breakdown, and oozing tears in moments of ultimate weakness. He achieves what he was going for because that's what he appears -- weak. Charles on the other hand despite all manner of challenges never fails to lose his cool and stoically plots out plans of action logically with little emotion and treats it all as a puzzle to solve instead of despairing.Bart the Bear gives one of the best animal performances EVER in this film. He's one of the biggest bears I have ever seen in my life and absolutely terrifying to behold. He has such a presence in this film that he gets fifth billing and he earned it. As a psycho maneater bear, I was awestruck by his imposing size and determination to run after those men for dinner.The scenery in the Alaskan wilderness is breathtakingly beautiful even when the wandering survivors are exhausted and at the brink of starvation, the mountains will catch your eye and you'll wish you could be there in that moment to experience the majesty.

I mean, at midday, when the sun's at it's peak, it's position in the sky would be roughly due SOUTH (and when Hopkins first made his floating needle compass, the sky was clear and sunny). Yet, they all relied on his cheesy compass, which caused them to unwittingly loose their direction and find themselves at their starting point a day later and after many miles of hiking.Other actions by Hopkins were similarly stupid. For instance, when rescuing Baldwin from his plunge into the deadfall bear trap (shortly after Baldwin was about to kill him), Hopkins pulls the half-buried wooden spike, which had pierced Baldwin's leg, straight up, which would drag an incredible amount of dirt into the puncture wound -- greatly increasing the degree of infection. (A smarter idea would have been to cut the spike and lift Baldwin's leg off of it.) Another dumb move was not to keep some kind of fire or torch burning at all times, so that they could both conserve their SIX matches and be ready to immediately start a larger fire in the event that a search plane or helicopter was seen or heard. (And those six matches seemed to remarkably light as many fires, suggesting that none were lit for naught.)Further, how could Balwin -- after the three survivors had already been chased by a Kodiak man-killer -- leave a blood-soaked pant leg (cut from Perrineau's trousers after he wounded himself with a knife) on a tree limb, the scent of which would attract any Kodiak for perhaps miles around. And where did that supply of wooden spears come from -- one of which killed the Kodiak -- after the bear chased Hopkins and Baldwin through the woods and over a steep embankment into a stream bed.Anyway, there were too many inconsistencies of that sort that served to discredit a movie that was otherwise pretty good.",1,What's With the Stupid Floating Needle Compass..?,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,2221,"['Edge', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie', 'plenty', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'excellent', 'action', 'sequences', 'BEAR', 'good', 'performances', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Harold', 'Perrineau.But', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'fact', 'none', 'three', 'plane', 'crash', 'survivors', 'had', 'enough', 'common', 'sense', 'approximate', 'way', 'was', 'south', 'not', 'even', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'genius', 'mean', 'midday', 'when', 'sun', 'peak', 'position', 'sky', 'would', 'be', 'roughly', 'due', 'SOUTH', 'when', 'Hopkins', 'first', 'made', 'floating', 'needle', 'compass', 'sky', 'was', 'clear', 'sunny', 'relied', 'cheesy', 'compass', 'caused', 'unwittingly', 'loose', 'direction', 'find', 'starting', 'point', 'day', 'later', 'many', 'miles', 'hiking.Other', 'actions', 'Hopkins', 'were', 'similarly', 'stupid', 'instance', 'when', 'rescuing', 'Baldwin', 'plunge', 'deadfall', 'bear', 'trap', 'shortly', 'Baldwin', 'was', 'kill', 'Hopkins', 'half-buried', 'wooden', 'spike', 'had', 'pierced', 'Baldwin', 'leg', 'straight', 'up', 'would', 'drag', 'incredible', 'amount', 'dirt', 'puncture', 'wound', 'greatly', 'increasing', 'degree', 'infection', 'smarter', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'spike', 'lift', 'Baldwin', 'leg', 'dumb', 'move', 'was', 'not', 'keep', 'kind', 'fire', 'torch', 'burning', 'times', 'could', 'conserve', 'SIX', 'matches', 'be', 'ready', 'immediately', 'start', 'larger', 'fire', 'event', 'search', 'plane', 'helicopter', 'was', 'seen', 'heard', 'six', 'matches', 'seemed', 'remarkably', 'light', 'many', 'fires', 'suggesting', 'none', 'were', 'lit', 'naught', 'Further', 'how', 'could', 'Balwin', 'three', 'survivors', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'chased', 'Kodiak', 'man-killer', 'leave', 'blood-soaked', 'pant', 'leg', 'cut', 'Perrineau', 'trousers', 'wounded', 'knife', 'tree', 'limb', 'scent', 'would', 'attract', 'Kodiak', 'perhaps', 'miles', 'around', 'where', 'did', 'supply', 'wooden', 'spears', 'come', 'one', 'killed', 'Kodiak', 'bear', 'chased', 'Hopkins', 'Baldwin', 'woods', 'steep', 'embankment', 'stream', 'bed.Anyway', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'inconsistencies', 'sort', 'served', 'discredit', 'movie', 'was', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'good']",N/A

I know if I were ever confronted with a real  bear when I was not at the zoo or Northwest Trek I would either soil  myself, run like hell, or pass out, but I rented this movie to see the  bear. Seriously, I thought I would be rooting for the bear the whole movie,  but I did start to really feel sorry for the characters (though it was  funny when they were trying to climb along that log and the bear  thoughtfully decided to start jumping up and down on it trying to make them  fall off) because the script and director did such a good job of making  them likeable. Well, Alec Baldwin played a jerk, but I felt so sorry for  Anthony Hopkins' character who was trying to hold it together, and I REALLY  felt sorry for the poor injured man who got cornered by the bear and shook  around by it like he was a Beanie  baby (tm) being shook around by a  hyper-active child.

Unfortunately, Mamet's script hampered my enjoyment of the glorious locales.The problem for me is that the dialogue is far too stagey and theatrical at times. Hopkins and Baldwin are both very solid here, but their words often feel fake, especially when spoken against these most authentic wilderness backdrops. It all seems too pontificating at times, and the film was suspenseful only when they were fighting the bear. But even then, it was laughably theatrical; no way Hopkins kills that bear that quickly with a suddenly fashioned perfect spear. No way!Still, there is lots of eye candy for nature lovers, and the occasional bon mot from Mamet, who is after all a very fine wordsmith. But I couldn't ever really let go into this movie; whenever I was about to, another out of place line would issue forth and I'd feel like I was watching a Broadway play, with all its inherent artifice, in the wilderness.

Written by the tremendously talented David Mamet (The House of Games, Oleanna), it is beautifully directed by the noted director Lee Tamahori (Once Were Warriors, Along Came a Spider). The film is a complex, fully fleshed story covering many themes, fully realized by a stellar cast. It also provides the viewer with breathtaking cinematography, as well as a compelling score written by Academy Award winner Jerry Goldsmith (The Omen).The film focuses an a mild mannered, self-effacing, slightly paranoid billionaire, Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins). A brilliant and well-read man with a penchant for esoteric knowledge, Morse is married to Mickey (Elle MacPherson), a young and beautiful, successful model. On location with her in a remote area of Alaska, she is surrounded by her young, fun loving camera crew, while he is seemingly the odd man out. He is astute enough, however, to sense that there are romantic undercurrents between his wife and her photographer, Robert Green (Alec Baldwin).When Morse accompanies Robert on what was to be a short excursion into the Alaskan wilderness, looking for a local hunter to pose in the photo shoot, disaster looms ahead, and the test for the survival of the fittest begins. It is here that the superior mind and knowledge of Morse is put to the test, as they find themselves pitted against nature. Morse rises to the occasion, emerging as a natural leader, while his younger, fitter rival, Robert, is often at a loss as to how to cope in their peculiar situation. It is also through the emerging and changing conditions that they face, that their respective characters emerge. It is in the wilderness that they are both unmasked and emerge as their true selves.This is a film that will keep the viewer enthralled. Anthony Hopkins has never been better as the quietly heroic Morse, and Alec Baldwin is excellent as the craven and duplicitous photographer who has cuckolded him. Elle MacPherson is luminous as the beautiful, young, trophy wife. The rest of the supporting cast, including the giant Kodiac bear, are also terrific.

So this film had the bona fides of being ""real"" - terrifyingly so. (a Google search yields many such recent cases, and many more that are referenced by old west stories)Intense and creepy tale about a group of ill-trained and ill-equipped city slickers caught out in the Alaskan wilderness. Having barely survived a plane crash, they only have what they're carrying - which is nearly nothing.Still, among the surviving passengers is humble multi-billionaire, Charles Morse, played with his usual deft and elegant proficiency by Anthony Hopkins. And while his character never actually had to live off the land, among his notable qualities includes an eidetic memory - everything he's ever seen, heard or read is permanently etched into his mind. That rare ability gives them a chance, knowing that they can utilize the primitive skills he's learned. Yes, 'book learned' as they say, but the will to succeed is buried deep within him. He didn't just have prosperity handed to him on a silver platter; he worked damned hard to get to the top. The fire that drove him as a younger man can be reapplied to their survival.All things being equal, with Charles in the lead, the group probably stood a good chance of making it out alive.Except for one major inequality - they've crashed into land that doesn't belong to them - modern humans. It's the kingdom of the Bear. The top predator. Long before hominids, the absolute undisputed ruler of the northwest territories. Having the intelligence equal to that of the smartest canines combined with an unforgiving killer instinct, qualities that instilled both fear and respect in the hearts of the native peoples who shared the land with them.Unfortunately, the group find themselves in the middle of territory held by a particularly brutal version of ursine - a man eater. They're rare, but they do exist. The Department of Fish And Wildlife, and even the Forestry Service, annually put down bears that even remotely show that kind of behavior.And the rogue animal quickly recognizes vulnerable and delicious prey. As the group works their way to civilization over frozen mountains and harsh wilderness - the bear voraciously probes, hunts, and takes them one after another.Charles realizes that this thing isn't going to be satisfied until it claims every last one of them. Their only recourse - fight. Fight for their lives, literally.Movie Note:- 'Edge' stars Bart The Bear. And unlike his on-screen persona, was one of the sweetest, smartest, and most beautifully gentle animals I have ever seen. Bart's cohort and trainer still runs a wildlife preserve in honor of his late buddy.

The plot is relatively simple: A billionaire named Charles (Hopkins) and his beauty-queen wife Micky (MacPherson) head off to Alaska for a photo-op, but Charles winds up being stranded in the Alaskan wilderness with the photographer Bob (Baldwin) and his assistant Stephen (Perrineau).  The three men then try to find ways to survive, not just against nature but among their relationships with each other as well.This is an intelligent adventure film with more dialogue than explosions.  The whole movie isn't always moving at the pace of a hardcore action flick, but when it does it leaves you biting your nails to the roots.  One of my favorite scenes is right in the beginning, where you are freaked out one moment and then breathe a sigh of relief the next.  The survival sequences are a lot of fun, and Hopkins delivers a great performance.  And the scenery is staggeringly beautiful!There are a few problems with this film, however.  Elle MacPherson may be pretty, but she doesn't act very well.  Also, once in a while, the dialogue makes a vain attempt to be intelligent and winds up just being vague (like the final line of the film).  Finally, the relationship between the men gets a little illogical after the film's pinnacle of excitement (more than halfway through the film).Nevertheless, the film is quite good, and it's worthy of more than one viewing.  Show it to your friends, they may be surprised at how exciting it actually is!Final note: The R-rating is there because of the violence and profanity.  The profanity never gets unreasonable; after all, it's pretty stressful to be lost in the Alaskan wilderness with nothing to eat.  The violence, however, involves intense adventure action and occasionally gets quite bloody.

In the Edge you will too get the impression that the beauty of this untamed nature can also devour: break the bodies and souls of our heroes, Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin, both offering their most underrated acting best.Three men are lost in the middle of a wilderness after their plane crash.The hope for an early return/rescue is dashed by the misleading spaces and a huge and determined Kodiak bear.One man, played by Harry Perrineau gets to know first hand about this determination,leaving Hopkins and Baldwin, bewildered, and weary,to try and escape with their lives.This is when the film really starts. It becomes a journey of incredible hardship that will strip both men of their 'social' selves and replace it with the need to survive that will take them to the 'Edge' of endurance on one hand, and the depths of their own souls on the other. The animosities, tension and grudges that laid hidden between the two men emerge as a powerful and consistent force that mark their relationship from then on.David Mamet has managed to write the 'Edge' that any human being can face whether lost in an unforgiving wilderness or anywhere else for that matter.It is simply how human beings  change,and how social niceties is slowly eroded when the need to survive becomes the single driving force. This is a fine piece of writing!Of course there is the thriller angle in the film..the bear, the master and primary predator of its environment,chasing two men that have been stripped from all the power and control they once possessed and taken for granted.The direction and cinematography of these scenes are of top  quality.So if you want to watch gorgeous scenery, be scared of this huge and beautiful animal,or witness the changes incredible circumstances that trigger in men, then the Edge is the film for you eyes and mind, a journey that can easily be revisited in the safety of your own home.",5,A Beauty That Can Devour!,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,2565,"['Edge', 'very', 'much', 'underrated', 'film', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'proper', 'recognition', 'above', 'average', 'multi-layered', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'many', 'levels', 'equally', 'well', 'written', 'directed.New', 'Zealander', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'excellent', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'name', 'writer', 'David', 'Mamet', 'manage', 'make', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'genre', 'might', 'drama', 'thriller', 'levels.First', 'breathtaking', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'spaces', 'so', 'are', 'equally', 'inviting', 'menacing.A', 'Napoleon', 'general', 'lamenting', 'disaster', 'French', 'army', 'once', 'said', ""'The"", 'vasteness', 'Russia', 'Edge', 'will', 'too', 'get', 'impression', 'beauty', 'untamed', 'nature', 'can', 'also', 'devour', 'break', 'bodies', 'souls', 'heroes', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'offering', 'most', 'underrated', 'acting', 'best.Three', 'men', 'are', 'lost', 'middle', 'wilderness', 'plane', 'crash.The', 'hope', 'early', 'return/rescue', 'dashed', 'misleading', 'spaces', 'huge', 'determined', 'Kodiak', 'bear.One', 'man', 'played', 'Harry', 'Perrineau', 'know', 'first', 'hand', 'determination', 'leaving', 'Hopkins', 'Baldwin', 'bewildered', 'weary', 'try', 'escape', 'lives.This', 'when', 'film', 'really', 'journey', 'incredible', 'hardship', 'will', 'strip', 'men', ""'social"", 'selves', 'replace', 'need', 'survive', 'will', 'take', ""'Edge"", 'endurance', 'one', 'hand', 'depths', 'own', 'souls', 'other', 'animosities', 'tension', 'grudges', 'laid', 'hidden', 'two', 'men', 'emerge', 'powerful', 'consistent', 'force', 'mark', 'relationship', 'then', 'on.David', 'Mamet', 'managed', 'write', ""'Edge"", 'human', 'being', 'can', 'face', 'lost', 'unforgiving', 'wilderness', 'anywhere', 'else', 'matter.It', 'simply', 'how', 'human', 'beings', 'change', 'how', 'social', 'niceties', 'slowly', 'eroded', 'when', 'need', 'survive', 'becomes', 'single', 'driving', 'force', 'fine', 'piece', 'writing', 'course', 'thriller', 'angle', 'film..the', 'bear', 'master', 'primary', 'predator', 'environment', 'chasing', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'power', 'control', 'once', 'possessed', 'taken', 'granted.The', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'scenes', 'are', 'top', 'quality.So', 'want', 'watch', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'be', 'scared', 'huge', 'beautiful', 'animal', 'witness', 'changes', 'incredible', 'circumstances', 'trigger', 'men', 'then', 'Edge', 'film', 'eyes', 'mind', 'journey', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'revisited', 'safety', 'own', 'home']",N/A

159559,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,0793927501,Richard Ross,"[3, 4]","As he demonstrated with his one scene in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", Alec Baldwin is a natural fit for David Mamet's funny and biting dialogue. Baldwin was later given a bigger role in Mamet's ""State and Main"" where he starred as an actor who liked sleeping with  underage girls. Before he made that film he collaborated with Mamet on ""The Edge"". Baldwin plays Bob, a cocky fashion photographer with eyes for his favorite model Mickey (Elle MacPherson). The only catch is that Mickey is the boss's wife. The boss is a brilliant billionaire named Charles and he is played by Anthony Hopkins. Charles suspects the two are having an affair and confronts Bob about it. Before Bob can answer, the plane the men are riding in collides with a flock of birds and crashes into the sea. This frightening accident strands Bob, Charles, and Bob's assistant Steven (Harold Perrineau) in the cold Alaskan wilderness. The men scramble to find shelter and warmth and devise a plan to be rescued. They figure their best chance is working their way up the highest mountain where they will be most visible to passing helicopters. Standing in their way is a giant Kodiak bear who picks up on their scent and begins stalking them. When Steven gets torn apart by the bear Charles and Bob are left to find a way out. The two men are forced to put aside their suspicions about each other and work together at finding food and devising a way to reach the top of the mountain.  Charles is full of odd wisdom such as fashioning a compass out of a needle and a leaf. Mamet's script is fascinating at coming up with these odd remedies.  The acting is excellent. Hopkins makes Charles a sympathetic character who is by no means a victim. Charles has his smarts working in his favor. Bob is an arrogant jerk but as embodied by Baldwin an extremely likable jerk. He has so many great chunks of dialogue to recite in this film. Things aren't all talk as director Lee Tamahori stages several exciting action scenes between the two men and the bear. Cinematographer Donald McAlpine captures beautiful shots of the dangerous waterfalls and mountains that our heroes cautiously navigate their way through.

The dialogue is what keeps viewers interested in the film as Hopkins and Baldwin must incorporate multiple dimenshions into their roles. They must relate to each other as busniess partners, fellow men trapped in the wilderness, having a deep past history, frustration due to the other's behavior and then convincly, change their personalities as the film ends.

He did star in &quot;The Road to Wellville,&quot; afterall.I  reluctantly watched this with a friend on tape after thinking I had escaped  having to see it at all when we missed the last screening of it in  theaters.What a surprise this film was.  I'm a big animal lover and I'm  of the opinion, &quot;if you don't want to get bitten by a shark, don't go  in the ocean.&quot; My sympathy for animals is more fervent when it comes  to mammals, including the misunderstood and much maligned Grizzly.  I must  say, however, this riviting tale of survival and 5-star acting had me  wishing that bad bear dead as much as the characters who find themselves  being hunted by the majestic beast.

People vote on these ""helpful"" reviews usually based on whether they agree with the reviewer's general opinion of the film. Well then strap yourself in to not agree with mine baby!There is quite a bit of pleasant scenery in this move. And then there is a ridiculously contrived plot about a bear stalking these two poor (well one rich) men in the wilderness. Thrown into the action, is a lot of money/sex/power chatter, treated in a typical Hollywood way. I would say ""liberal"" but that's too easy. And also, Mamet has moved over to the dark side lately although not sure if he was of the libertarian mind when he wrote this. Anyway, I love his work and can't quite understand what happened here.An apology for the rich guy. And forgiveness for the poor jealous guy too.

Lovely.The director and writer forgot all about Hitchcock's ""suspension of disbelief"" concept. I wasn't scared of the bear.

How refreshing for a contemporary film!  Anthony Hopkins is that character, a billionaire named Charles, whose keen intellect and thoughtful nature nonetheless make him a ripe target for his toothy supermodel wife and her photographer lover, Bob (played with just the right amount of oiliness by Alec Baldwin).  Even after a surprise birthday party calculated to give him a heart attack fails, Charles joins Bob and others on a plane expedition to find the subject for a photoshoot.  Disaster comes in the form of birds that cause the plane to crash in the Alaskan wilderness, setting into motion a chain of conflicts that include being stalked by a man-eating bear and the two men coming to terms with their true natures.  Hopkins' little-boy-lost-style of acting is perfect for Charles, who despite his money still suffers from living in a world that values all the wrong things (illustrated nicely when the local innkeeper turns a friendly breakfast conversation into a sales pitch).  But it's Lee Tamahori's steadfast direction and David Mamet's tight screenplay that add depth--the themes of good versus evil, thought versus physicality, and honesty versus deceit resonate with both symbol and action.

It says much for the power of Baldwin and Hopkin's performances that the magnificent bear, Big Bart, did not steal every scene in which he appeared.Billionaire intellectual, mildly paranoid Hopkins accompanies his trophy wife played by super model Elle MacPherson to a photo shoot in the Alaskan wilderness.  The always faintly menacing Alec Baldwin is a trendy, sophisticated fashion photographer who has more than a passing interest in Ms. MacPherson.  Hopkins reluctantly agrees to accompany Baldwin on a search for an elusive native trapper who Baldwin thinks will be an ideal photo subject. The plane goes down (in a jarringly effective scene).  Three survive, but on their first night the weakest of their party is horrifyingly mauled and taken away by a giant Kodiak bear.  Baldwin and Hopkins must make their way out of the wilderness with the terrifying knowledge that the bear is stalking them.  Hopkins is a wonderfully effective survivor and Baldwin shows a toughness and perseverance that belies his sophisticated image. Will the bear triumph? Will they get out alive? Are Baldwin and Hopkins ultimately partners or deadly adversaries?Thanks to David Mamet, the screenplay has depth and is probably full of deeper meanings that whizzed right by me. Lee Tamahori's fine direction lifted the film from a merely grand adventure saga to an absorbing study of two men and their inner beings. The script or the interactions never bored me.  There is one fine scene setup that alone was worth the price of admission to me.  Hopkins and Baldwin are peering over a fallen log desperately trying to ascertain the location of the bear.  Only their upper faces are showing.  Hopkins china blue eyes display enormous depth and intelligence while Baldwin's icy blues convey complete kill or be killed intensity.  I think reviewers have been unjust to Ms. MacPherson's contribution.  I believe she delivered just what she was supposed to: a beauty who was graceful, charming and perhaps a little shallow.This film is about as perfect as it can be.  The only flaw is a very disappointing DVD with no extras.  Hopefully, another edition will come out.  Anthony Hopkins is always marvelously articulate about his roles; it would be a treat to hear a few words from him.  Outtakes on Big Bart's scenes would be priceless.  I advise waiting for new edition before purchasing the DVD, but by all means, rent this one!

159586,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0793927501,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Anthony Hopkins stars as Charles in 1997's ""The Edge"", a sad, lifeless billionaire who has accumulated a vast store of mostly useless facts. Because of his great wealth he's unsure if people are honestly interested in him as a friend or just want his money. His much younger, model wife (Elle Macpherson) treats him more as a teddy bear than a romantic lover. He wonders if she's having an affair with her photographer Bob (Alec Baldwin).Charles gets stranded in the Northewest wilderness and is forced to confront three types of nature: First, he must contend with wilderness nature itself (the movie was filmed in breath-taking Alberta and British Columbia). Secondly, he comes face to face (literally) with a fierce Kodiak bear. Thirdly, he must confront human nature in the ugly form of arrongance, envy, malice, greed, lust and murder.Unexpectedly, as Charles confronts these three challenges he starts to blossom and fully come ALIVE, perhaps for the first time in decades. His colossal store of mostly worthless knowledge actually becomes useful.There are a couple ""Yeah, right"" Hollywood implausibilities -- for instance, the bear shaking the tree as the guys cross the river (an homage to King Kong) -- but, for the most part, the story plays out realistically.""The Edge"" addresses many powerful and worthy themes including Rebirth & renewal, confronting & overcoming incredible challenges, and, perhaps most potent of all, the power of repentance and triumphing over evil through goodwill & forgiveness.*** SPOILER ALERT *** Don't read the next paragraph if you haven't seen the movieSome may scoff at that last one but, after Charles gains the upperhand over Bob at the end, Bob sincerely repents of his wicked deeds before he ultimately dies (the 'wicked deeds' being his intention to kill Charles for his wife & wealth). At the end Charles refuses to say anything bad about Bob, even though he clearly has the right to; all he states is that Bob died saving his life. Why did he say this? Why didn't he lambaste him for being a murderous, greedy, adulterous scumbag? Perhaps not only because Charles accepted his repentance and FORGAVE him, but also because he realized that ALL OF US are screw-ups to some degree. We all have a dark, carnal side to our psyche, Bob simply made the mistake of going over THE EDGE; yet, in the end, he realized this and was truly sorry for it. What an amazing story about the power of repentance and forgiveness!*** END SPOILER ***These descriptions of the film's profundities are feeble at best; there's so much more I'd like to comment on but mere words won't do it justice. Discover for yourself. This is definitely a movie worthy of repeat viewings.BOTTOM LINE: If all you want out of ""The Edge"" is a great adventure/survival story with spectacular scenery, you'll definitely get it, yet it profoundly (and unexpectedly) offers so much more. I'm a pretty masculine dude but the last time I saw this film I was so affected that I broke down at the end.The next day I saw the Peter Jackson ""King Kong"" flick, which is essentially another adventure/survival yarn albeit with a giant gorilla and dinosaurs instead of a bear. Compared to ""The Edge"" Jackson's ""King Kong"" is a laughable $200 million Road Runner cartoon.""The Edge"" ranks with my all-time favorite films.
