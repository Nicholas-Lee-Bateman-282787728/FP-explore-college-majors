The moves are tricky, but they look great and I think with a bit of work you could pick them up. The girls look fantastic, their clothes are funky and the DVD is in short 10 minute sections so if you get bored like me, there really is no time to lose interest. I will continue to revisit it as I want to do the dances, and even if you do stuff up like I did, your heart rate still keeps going.",4,But maybe one day is will be FIVE *****,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,495,"['am', 'not', 'dancer', 'so', 'found', 'DVD', 'hard', 'end', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'hang', 'moves', 'are', 'tricky', 'look', 'great', 'think', 'bit', 'work', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'look', 'fantastic', 'clothes', 'are', 'funky', 'DVD', 'short', '10', 'minute', 'sections', 'so', 'get', 'bored', 'really', 'time', 'lose', 'interest', 'will', 'continue', 'revisit', 'want', 'do', 'dances', 'even', 'do', 'stuff', 'did', 'heart', 'rate', 'still', 'going']",N/A

She's a good dancer, but in this dvd she calls at the cues as she does them & only goes 3/4 speed at slowest, never half the speed.  She only breaks down the moves into 2-3x layers at most.If she would teach in 1/2 tempo a few times & practice each finished move several times before learning the next, it would keep the heart rate up, easier to follow. Yes, there'd be less moves, but least you could keep up & work more on the details rather then being lost on the basic move itself.The moves are old school, cool & well known, not too watered down, but also then calls for more practice.You can see a trailer atcollagevideo comtotalfitnessdvds com",4,"Great fun, good old school moves,  but needs more breakdown",1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,729,"['Julianne', 'Arney', 'been', 'great', 'friendly', 'bubbling', 'personality', 'good', 'dancer', 'dvd', 'cues', 'only', '3/4', 'speed', 'slowest', 'never', 'speed', 'only', 'down', 'moves', '2-3x', 'layers', 'most.If', 'would', 'teach', '1/2', 'tempo', 'few', 'times', 'practice', 'finished', 'move', 'several', 'times', 'learning', 'next', 'would', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'easier', 'follow', 'Yes', ""'d"", 'be', 'less', 'moves', 'least', 'could', 'keep', 'up', 'work', 'more', 'details', 'rather', 'then', 'being', 'lost', 'basic', 'move', 'itself.The', 'moves', 'are', 'old', 'school', 'cool', 'well', 'known', 'not', 'too', 'watered', 'down', 'also', 'then', 'more', 'practice.You', 'can', 'see', 'trailer', 'atcollagevideo', 'comtotalfitnessdvds', 'com']",N/A
