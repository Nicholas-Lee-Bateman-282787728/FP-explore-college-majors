1634536,A3V1ARVPHYOZJS,B00BGGIXBU,"D. S. Wymore ""Golden Age of Hollywood fan""","[3, 3]","I'm so incredibly happy that Fox has finally seen the light and has recognized the fact that there is a market for these films. Yes, they probably won't sell to the masses at Wal-mart but there are those of us who A) don't shop there and B) enjoy certain stars in just about any film they're in.I understand at the time this film was released, the critics and audiences were disappointed that Betty Grable was in a long skirt (no famous gams to be seen) and didn't dance. There are no production numbers, either. Her leading man, Dick Haymes, was a crooner, not a dancer and the storyline doesn't really leave room for any dancing.The story revolves around the women's suffrage movement in the 1870s. When Betty takes a job as a typist in an office, Boston is set on it's ear at the thought of a women doing a man's job. Consequently, Betty charms everyone and proves that she is very capable in all she does in the office, proving that women can work outside of the home.The songs by the Gershwins are not as famous as most of their other material. ""As if I Didn't Have Enough on my Mind"" is the stand out.As with all of the DVDs in the Fox Cinema Archives series - this is strictly bare bones: no chapters, no trailers, no commentaries, no inserts - just the movie.",3,No dancing Betty in this one!,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1267,"[""'m"", 'so', 'incredibly', 'happy', 'Fox', 'finally', 'seen', 'light', 'recognized', 'fact', 'market', 'films', 'Yes', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sell', 'masses', 'Wal-mart', 'are', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'shop', 'there', 'B', 'enjoy', 'certain', 'stars', 'just', 'film', ""'re"", 'in.I', 'understand', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'critics', 'audiences', 'were', 'disappointed', 'Betty', 'Grable', 'was', 'long', 'skirt', 'famous', 'gams', 'be', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'dance', 'are', 'production', 'numbers', 'either', 'leading', 'man', 'Dick', 'Haymes', 'was', 'crooner', 'not', 'dancer', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'really', 'leave', 'room', 'dancing.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'women', 'suffrage', 'movement', '1870s', 'When', 'Betty', 'job', 'typist', 'office', 'Boston', 'set', 'ear', 'thought', 'women', 'doing', 'man', 'job', 'Consequently', 'Betty', 'everyone', 'very', 'capable', 'office', 'proving', 'women', 'can', 'work', 'home.The', 'songs', 'Gershwins', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'famous', 'most', 'other', 'material', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Have', 'Enough', 'Mind', 'stand', 'out.As', 'DVDs', 'Fox', 'Cinema', 'Archives', 'series', 'strictly', 'bare', 'bones', 'chapters', 'trailers', 'commentaries', 'inserts', 'just', 'movie']",The Shocking Miss Pilgrim

Fenton,"[3, 3]","Betty Grable is incomparable as a female suffragette, a modern-working woman who challenges the placid facades of Boston society when she falls in love with her wealthy, elitist employer.
