It is an animated series and crap at that! That being said here in lies the brilliant work of Ozzie Nelson who for 14 years wrote the scripts, produced and directed the shows, and if that weren't enough stared in them! There's a reason why this show went 14 years. IT'S FUNNY! As a head comedy writer for a series I can tell you that the one liners and zingers here are second to none. Only Seinfeld can claim a better (no make that equal) amount of sure fire funnies per minute. And it doesn't stop there.

THANK YOU! to Shout and the Nelsons for releasing this wonderful collection of shows from the Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet.

When I first saw this collection for sale at Amazon I just figured it was going to be another cheap version and I passed it by. But while I was searching Amazon again one night I came upon this release again and this time I read the description. After learning it was going to be an authorized edition by the Nelson family I ordered it right away. My set arrived two days ago when bad news was coming at me from left to right and I was really feeling down in the dumps. When I was able to sit down and put in the first DVD all my troubles went away for a short time. The transfers are wonderful as is the sound. The only thing that disappointed me is that some of the songs have been deleted. I enjoyed Ricks song in the episode ""Tutti Frutti Ice Cream"" but it's been cut. However, this is very minor as far as I'm concerned. Fans of this wonderful collection will appreciate that fact that we finally have some crystal clear shows to watch. My only hope is that many more shows will be released very soon. Thank you again to Shout and the Nelson family for giving fans this wonderful collection.

That was the first clue that there was something wrong...the next one was that the classic Tutti Frutti episode wasn't as long as the bloody VHS available decades ago...they even cut Ricky's singing on that one...ridiculous.Perhaps this is why Gunnar and Matthew and Tracy aren't involved?

It brought me back to a simple  era of time, when gasoline was 26 cents, fruit cocktail was 10 cents. There seemed to be no inflation ? Because most everything was made in America. We should of stayed on track for this era had more morals, more, self pride , God was still in everything we did. We were always aware of him.But I know times change but they went in the wrong way !The Fifties was probably the best era in American Times.But anyway great 4 disc video, I really enjoyed it.

Yes, some of the episodes are cut from commercial TV viewing, but the overall feel and family-friendly episodes are a joy to watch.
