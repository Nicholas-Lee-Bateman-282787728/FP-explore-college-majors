1025733,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B000JBXHQY,"ANT ""azraelart""","[4, 5]","Possibly the most misunderstood movies of 2006, Snakes on a Plane is a hilarious tribute to every bad B-list cult classic horror/suspense movie ever made.  As funny as it is, it all depends on how you enter into the viewing experience.  You cannot take it seriously for one second and must remember that every line is a commentary or homage to previous horror movie bombs and cult classic busts.Naturally, the action is predictable and corny, the dialogue cheesy and dripping with dreck.  But, that is the point of the film, not to ever be taken seriously or take itself seriously.  The characters match suit, too.  You have the noble pilot, the horny co-pilot, the heroine stewardess, the older flight attendent (who is retiring after this 'one last flight'), the young newlyweds in love, the single mother with the baby, the rap star and his crew, the arrogant businessman, the tough-as-nails FBI agent (played perfectly by Samuel L.), his nervous and uncertain partner, and many other tribute roles.  You can almost tell just from the descriptions who is going to make it through and who is going to 'bite' the big one.Understandably, the acting is stunted at times and a tad silly all the time.  The lines are seemingly pulled from every failed horror movie ever made since 1954.  Still, in that vein, it succeeds perfectly as a tribute to bad movies and even corny CGI.  This movie was essentially written by the fans in the end, so their input helped to shape this flick into what it is today, a tribute to MST3K films.Overall, I rated this piece four stars due to it's humor value and success at honoring cult classics from days gone by.  I did feel that it could have been a little bit smoother and somewhat more fleshed out, but overall, this was a highly enjoyable film and I highly recommend it to fans of the genres in question.

1025736,A2QA095LQPDBJD,B000JBXHQY,Ariel Escasa,"[3, 3]","Let's start with the title. I can't recall any film in recent history that had a more unpretentious, straightforward, descriptive title than this one. I toyed with the idea of coming up with alternative titles, pretending I was part of the production team, and came up with such clunkers as Venom at 30,000 Feet, Air Reptilia, and Slither in the Sky. I saw the producers glowering at me and asking me, what the hell is wrong with Snakes on a Plane?? And I sheepishly nodded and said, yeah, you're right.Now, how about the pre-release hype? At no time did the filmmakers make us believe that this was anything more than a good old-fashioned thrill-ride. At no time did they promote this as the next Oscar contender. And after viewing the trailers, we knew exactly what to expect: pure, unadulterated, leave-your-brain-at-the-door entertainment. And that's exactly what we got. Some argue that the movie was overhyped. But can there really be such a thing when the hype is done so honestly?As for the storyline itself, well, here's the deal: a guy witnesses a mob kill, and Nelville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) is the FBI agent assigned to protect him. Flynn escorts the witness on a plane ride from Hawaii to LA, where the witness will testify against the murderer. Said murderer, the leader of a big-time international drug syndicate, devices a plan to see to it that the witness never takes the stand. He smuggles 500 deadly snakes onto the plane, housed in a crate with a time-release lock. And to get them agitated once they're out, he sprays the leis that the passengers are to wear with snake pheromones. That's right, he's willing to take down an entire plane because one of the passengers is the key witness against him.Silly? Sure.Fun? Absolutely.Those three elements -- the title, the advertising, and the absurd premise -- were all designed to tell us that this is a movie that refuses to take itself seriously. And the cast goes along with the gag with total aplomb. Jackson is perfect for this sort of thing. You have to admire his ability to go through this joke of a film while keeping a straight face. And once an actor of his stature gets into that tongue-in-cheek mode, the rest of the cast finds it that much easier to follow suit. Oh, and so do the CGI snakes.If you're looking for a fun no-brainer that entertains and nothing more, I say, go watch Snakes on a Plane.

You really don't have to think hard about what the story is about- it's completely obvious by the title.  It's not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, and after watching it I now know why people were making fun of it when it first hit theaters.  I guess in this day and age, we've seen countless horror flicks like these.  It's not a surprise anymore.  A whole bunch of snakes from different countries aboard a plane and kill anyone they can.  Is it original?  Well, not really.One thing I think the movie does very well is have a variety of different passengers on flight to make the story more interesting.  I won't go into detail, but there's so many different creative people on the plane to add some variety to the story, and I enjoyed it.The snakes themselves are really vicious, not to mention perverted.  You see, many times these snakes attack people by biting at their private areas.  I'm not kidding.  They are nasty snakes.  The part where one woman tried throwing up only for a snake to crawl inside her mouth and kill her was seriously disturbing.  Yuck.  Of course you wonder if the pilots will be attacked by the snakes making it very difficult for the passengers to land safely.  You know the answer to this.Samuel L. Jackson was pretty good, though honestly he's been much better in other movies.

I decided to wait until I came to my final, absolute conclusion about the movie for a little while, as I tend to try to do after seeing something.And my humble verdict about the phenomana that wasn't?""Snakes on a Plane"" rocks!We could talk for days about why ""Snakes on a Plane"" wasn't the box office blockbuster that people apparently thought it was destined to be. At the end of the day I saw few movies this year that were so unpretetnious about just wanting to entertain as ""Snakes"", and it did so in spades.I'm not going to reiterate the plot for you because I assume if you keep up with entertainment news at all you all ready know what the pictures about. I'm just going to tell you what you're gonna get if you fork over your hard earned dollars to see it.You're going to see a bunch of deadly snakes that have been unleashed on a plane. Samuel L. Jackson and the rest of the people on the flight must unite to destroy said deadly snakes while making sure the plane doesn't crash in the ocean. There are some excellent snake attack scenes, as well as a good sense of humor about itself(the movie never takes it self too seriously but never goes out and out camp either) and there are some scenes of geniune tension.This movie isn't rockey science, and it never tries to be.

1025742,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000JBXHQY,Boss Fan,"[10, 11]","One could argue there is a downside to all the pre-release hype and the notion of turning movies into cult classics before they even hit the screen.  It is a little unfortunate, for instance,  that when Jackson finally recites his already classic ""Make My Day"" line (""I've had it with these motherf*#king snakes on this motherf#@king plane!"") some of the joy is lost because you either know it is coming or you have been waiting the last 90 minutes for it.  Moments like these are supposed to be something of a surprise.  Discovered in the moment and then traded down amongst friends until it finally makes its way into the pop culture lexicon.  I don't think anyone was running around yelling ""Yippie-Ky-Yay, motherf*#ker!"" six months before the release of ""Die Hard.""  Things like this are supposed to catch on by accident, not be made specifically to do so.And that could be said about ""Snakes on a Plane"" itself.  The problem with setting out to make a film that is a cult classic from the get-go is that it negates the term.  Cult classics are such because they have, over the years, earned that reputation.  If a film is a cult classic just because it includes a lot of intentionally bad dialogue, over the top performances and ridiculous action, then nearly every Sci-Fi Channel movie or the hundreds of straight to video flicks that line the walls at Blockbuster are cult classics.  Truly great, so-bad-its-good B-movies usually become labeled as such because they aren't in on the joke.  The intent was to make an actual film, but they failed so miserably that the movies becomes unintentionally hilarious, yet everyone is playing it with such conviction it is even more hilarious (think ""Roadhouse"").  I'm not sure you can set out to create that.  It doesn't have the same feel or effect when you know that's what they are trying to do.But even if calling ""Snakes on a Plane"" a cult classic lacks authenticity and feels both premature and inaccurate, there is no denying it is still a lot of fun.  Some might ask why you couldn't just watch a crappy creature movie for free on many a cable channel rather than going out and ponying up hard earned cash for something so trite.  Make no mistake, while ""Snakes"" revels in its hokiness, it still looks better and has more quality performances and action sequences than you run of the mill creature feature (""Dinocroc,"" anyone?).  It is a good-looking action flick that warrants a big-screen release, however, it still knows to skew everything just cheesy enough (dialogue, performances, effects) to put the film firmly in the tongue-in-cheek action category.  Let's face it, a movie titled ""Snakes on a Plane"" isn't likely to confuse too many people looking for quality or smarts.All that said, if you were to come across ""SoaP"" some night on, say, Cinemax, you would be pleasantly surprised with how much fun this movie is, with its hilariously overblown caricatures of characters, its script where everything is written as if intended to be a one-liner, and its totally absurd high concept plotting (hundreds of poisonous snakes placed on a plane in order to kill a witness because they could not get to him since the plane is so heavily guarded by police and government officials - how, then, did they get the snakes on the plane? - if they can do that, surely they can get a gun and gunman onboard).  Sam Jackson is perfect for the part and some of his lines are true classics (""Time is Tissue,"" he is told - love his WTF face in response).It's a shame expectations and hype were so high.  ""SoaP"" is indeed junk, and it doesn't rate as the high-junk as many were hoping and/or led to believe.  But it is still good-looking, fast paced, highly entertaining junk.  Since it was something of a disappointment at the box office, maybe it will now have a shot at achieving true cult status.It certainly deserves it.",4,"""Time is Tissue!""",1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,3870,"['One', 'could', 'argue', 'downside', 'pre-release', 'hype', 'notion', 'turning', 'movies', 'cult', 'classics', 'even', 'hit', 'screen', 'little', 'unfortunate', 'instance', 'when', 'Jackson', 'finally', 'already', 'classic', 'Make', 'My', 'Day', 'line', ""'ve"", 'had', 'motherf*', 'king', 'snakes', 'motherf', '@', 'king', 'plane', 'joy', 'lost', 'know', 'coming', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'last', '90', 'minutes', 'Moments', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'something', 'surprise', 'Discovered', 'moment', 'then', 'traded', 'down', 'amongst', 'friends', 'finally', 'way', 'pop', 'culture', 'lexicon', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'was', 'running', 'around', 'yelling', 'Yippie-Ky-Yay', 'motherf*', 'ker', 'six', 'months', 'release', 'Die', 'Hard', 'are', 'supposed', 'catch', 'accident', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'specifically', 'do', 'so.And', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'problem', 'setting', 'out', 'make', 'film', 'cult', 'classic', 'get-go', 'term', 'Cult', 'classics', 'are', 'such', 'have', 'years', 'earned', 'reputation', 'film', 'cult', 'classic', 'just', 'lot', 'intentionally', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'top', 'performances', 'ridiculous', 'action', 'then', 'nearly', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movie', 'hundreds', 'straight', 'video', 'flicks', 'line', 'walls', 'Blockbuster', 'are', 'cult', 'classics', 'Truly', 'great', 'so-bad-its-good', 'B-movies', 'usually', 'become', 'labeled', 'such', 'are', ""n't"", 'joke', 'intent', 'was', 'make', 'actual', 'film', 'failed', 'so', 'miserably', 'movies', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'everyone', 'playing', 'such', 'conviction', 'even', 'more', 'hilarious', 'think', 'Roadhouse', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'set', 'out', 'create', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'feel', 'effect', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'do.But', 'even', 'calling', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'cult', 'classic', 'authenticity', 'feels', 'premature', 'inaccurate', 'denying', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'might', 'ask', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'watch', 'crappy', 'creature', 'movie', 'free', 'many', 'cable', 'channel', 'rather', 'going', 'out', 'ponying', 'up', 'hard', 'earned', 'cash', 'something', 'so', 'trite', 'Make', 'mistake', 'Snakes', 'revels', 'hokiness', 'still', 'better', 'more', 'quality', 'performances', 'action', 'sequences', 'run', 'mill', 'creature', 'feature', 'Dinocroc', 'anyone', 'good-looking', 'action', 'flick', 'warrants', 'big-screen', 'release', 'however', 'still', 'skew', 'everything', 'just', 'cheesy', 'enough', 'dialogue', 'performances', 'effects', 'put', 'film', 'firmly', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'action', 'category', 'Let', 'face', 'movie', 'titled', 'Snakes', 'Plane', ""n't"", 'likely', 'confuse', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'looking', 'quality', 'smarts.All', 'said', 'were', 'come', 'SoaP', 'night', 'say', 'Cinemax', 'would', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'movie', 'hilariously', 'overblown', 'caricatures', 'characters', 'script', 'where', 'everything', 'written', 'intended', 'be', 'one-liner', 'totally', 'absurd', 'high', 'concept', 'plotting', 'hundreds', 'poisonous', 'snakes', 'placed', 'plane', 'order', 'kill', 'witness', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'plane', 'so', 'heavily', 'guarded', 'police', 'government', 'officials', 'how', 'then', 'did', 'get', 'snakes', 'plane', 'can', 'do', 'surely', 'can', 'get', 'gun', 'gunman', 'onboard', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'perfect', 'part', 'lines', 'are', 'true', 'classics', 'Time', 'Tissue', 'told', 'love', 'WTF', 'face', 'response', '.It', 'shame', 'expectations', 'hype', 'were', 'so', 'high', 'SoaP', 'indeed', 'junk', ""n't"", 'rate', 'high-junk', 'many', 'were', 'hoping', 'and/or', 'led', 'believe', 'still', 'good-looking', 'fast', 'paced', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'junk', 'was', 'something', 'disappointment', 'box', 'office', 'maybe', 'will', 'now', 'have', 'shot', 'achieving', 'true', 'cult', 'status.It', 'certainly']",N/A

Well as someone who knows that zombies are everywhere, I was hoping for some Hollywood zombies.  There were some on the plane though, if you look closely.  People who are always yakking on cell phones and listening to digital music devices are usually suspect.  In the wake of 9/11 Hollywood decides to try and bring comedy into the mix with terror.  The result is also mixed, because it is just not quite realistic.  In real life the snakes would have died, because they are not going to survive long in another environment.  Why do you think these snakes are rare and only found in certain parts of the world in the first place?  It is like having a fish out of water, so to speak.The zombies win but only after a snake gobbles up an annoying, yipping dog.  I like dogs though so I was dismayed at this a great deal.  The fat dumb owner should have been the one gobbled up instead.  Samuel L. Jackson is a mean fighting machine and he puts on a great performance!!!  The kid he was guarding was a putz though, in real life they would have shipped him by bus or just ignored him, so that was also unrealistic.  However, what was realistic was that your tax dollar is highly wasted on things that do not matter, like transporting people like the guy named Jones in the movie.

Talk about one of the weirdest conceptual movies I've seen in a minute. The fact that a senario of snakes overtaking an airplane and causing everyone to panic was pretty entertaining to me. There were many funny scenes within this movie, like when the snakes attack the couple in the airplane lavatory. As for the actors, Samuel L. Jackson does a good job playing the FBI agent. Also Keenan Thompson (from Nickeloden's ""Keenan and Kel"") has an awkward part in the movie, that people will find funny. I know I did.A lot of people claimed this is a stupid movie or had a stupid concept. If they had a sense of humor and learn to have fun while watching movies like this, they will see how much of a great movie it is. True the concept of snakes (of various kinds) being on a airplane is kinda weird, but it's movies like this that make them so fun to watch. Ignore the ignorant who say this is a bad movie.

When I asked why everyone was highly anticipating this movie, the response was ""because it's called 'Snakes on a Plane'! There's snakes, and they're on a plane...what more do you want?"" My usual reply was a good movie and as much as it pains me, and surprises me to say this but this was actually a pretty fun movie. Sure it's camp but it knows its camps and that's all that matters. While I wouldn't put this near any of my favorite lists, I will cop to the fact that I did enjoy myself.Premise: there's snakes on a plane. Okay okay, not quite enough right? Here's the full rundown: a vacationing kid named Sean in Hawaii sees a murder committed by a notorious mobster and a hit is put on the kid's life. Enter Agent Flynn to escort him back to Los Angeles so he can testify. But rather than smuggle a bomb, an assassin or something common, they smuggle the popular snakes on board and of course as the cliche goes, ""all hell breaks loose"".A fair warning: anyone walking into this film expecting high art is obviously misinformed. This is a B-movie and the film knows it. Generic characters from the snooty Hilton-like girl to the uptight businessman to the flight attendant who's just about to retire. Dialogue is also notoriously cheesy and there's massive plot holes that even trains would get stuck in but that's not the point: point was to be entertained if only for an hour and a half and the film does exactly this. It's probably one of the best cases of audience participation as its completely fun to watch people react at the snake attacks.So what went wrong with the film considered it underperformed a bit? My guess is that people realized that this was an actual movie. Unlike certain films which turn out to be awful or campy, people were shocked that there was a film that was intentionally camp, even down to the title. But eventually...they watched the movie and the novelty value wore off. Then they realized this was indeed meant to be a pure popcorn movie and nothing more but people maybe thought this was the best film of its type of the year. Here's my advice: play this with a whole bunch of friends, get popcorn, booze and whatever you feel like. Watch this alone and you realize what it is.Ironically, a film possibly meant to be serious (The Covenant) was released the same day as this and it was bad because it was bad.

Oh, and snakes on a plane. Here's the breakdown.1.  Directing--Nicely done directing from David R. Ellis (Final Destination 2). It also has very nice special effects, the snakes look pretty real even when they are CGI.2.  Script--Wow, I also liked the script. It has some of the best movie lines in history including Samuel L. Jackson's famous line, which you will hear if you watch the movie.3.  Acting--Of course it's gonna be good if you have Samuel L. Jackson. You also have the very pretty Sunny Mabrey.Now for the content review.Rated R for language, a scene of sexuality and drug use, and intense sequences of terror and violence.1.  Sex/Nudity=4/10. There is one nudity scene, and it is somewhat graphic.2.  Violence/Gore=9/10. This movie can get pretty bloody. Many, many people are killed by the poisonous snakes throughout the movie. A man is beaten to death with a baseball bat at the beginning.3.  Language=9/10. The language is kind of high up there. 36 F-words and other profanities.Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. It's very good. An excellent creature movie and it is very tense throughout. The CGI throughout the movie is amazingly well done. Also Samuel L. Jackson's performance alone is worth watching the movie.

Never, ever, taking itself seriously, this cinematic mad hatter oozes goofiness, nonsense, silliness, ickiness, and thrills 'n chills by the skin-shedding score.  Samuel L. Jackson, as an FBI agent assigned to protect an informant marked by the mob, gets to go off in his traditional Samuel L.

Zany character actor David Koechner, who plays the plane's pilot, manages to maintain a coarse locker room persona--even after he's been bitten more times than Paris Hilton's had dates.

With my expectations aimed low, I grabbed a bag of popcorn and plopped onto the couch, ready for some cheap thrills.My expectations were not set low enough. Despite the promising first few minutes, which implied there would be more to this than just ""snakes on a plane,"" the movie fell apart at an accelerating rate. From the unexplained ability of the Hawaiian thugs to locate a  witness, to the almost comical misuse of the term ""antivenom""--it's actually ""antivenin""--the writers of this screenplay show a glaring lack of respect for even the basic armchair thrill-seeker. Adding to the insult, the snakes are digitally manipulated to the point that they resemble very few actual snakes. One of the characters claims that the snakes are all foreign, when in fact a rattlesnake is clearly visible more than once.Should I mention the ridiculous ""green light"" vision of the snakes? What about the silly ""wall of luggage"" which holds the snakes at bay, when minutes earlier the creatures were able to creep through every nook and cranny of the plane's fuselage and cabin? The biggest laugh for me came when the ditzy white  was allowed to kiss the hunky white guy at the end, while the headline star, Samuel L. Jackson himself, was refused the expected kiss from his lily-white airline stewardess counterpart.Years from now, this movie may still be around--on cable, on DVD, in small artsy theaters--as a novelty, a gag, an over-the-top parody of horror movies. With the overtly gratuitous skin, the over-acting, and the numerous story flaws, this is everything a campy movie should be. And maybe that's precisely what the directors were aiming for.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[19, 22]","Snakes on a Plane is one of those wacky, implausible action/thrillers that you get a kick out of, but don't take too seriously. I mean, c'mon, really, on paper the concept of passengers having to deal with crawly reptiles while trapped thousands of feet in the air just shouts out CHEESY! But it somehow works. It has that fun, tongue-in-cheek, popcorn feel of films like Arachnophobia and Tremors. And, like those two films, Snakes on a Plane lives up to its promise of vicarious thrills, as it has enough jump-in-your-seat moments to seem like a wild Magic Mountain ride; that's the kind of rush you get.And it doesn't take itself seriously. It is what it is: snakes on a plane. But it doesn't hurt that the film has someone of Samuel Jackson's caliber to headline it. Ever since Pulp Fiction, Samuel Jackson has been identified with hipness and has been hailed universally (but mostly by the MTV gen) as the coolest cat around, and whatever vehicle he stars in seems to gain some kind of credibility. Yup, even this decidedly B-level movie.Very quickly, the plot: When Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses a brutal murder in Hawaii, he becomes the lead witness to the prosecution trying to put away arch-criminal Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). Sean is placed in protective custody, under the eyes of his watchdog FBI Agent Flynn (Samuel Jackson). Sean and Agent Flynn board a redeye flight headed for Los Angeles, where Eddie Kim is currently under close surveillance and where Sean will testify. But Kim has found out about Sean and decides to take care of him by sneaking a crate of venomous snakes on the plane. Now, the plane's vent circulation has been laced with pheromones which rile up these creatures, and when the plane launches and the crate's time release mechanism sets loose the snakes - well, the crazy fun is on!There are so many scenarios you can come up with when you have snakes on the prowl, slithering in a confined area, amongst clueless people, and the writers dreamt up some doozies. There's one particular bathroom scene (no, not the couple making out, the other bathroom scene) that made me really cringe. Also a standout moment was the passenger lady with the barf bag. And biting or squeezing victims (yes, there's an anaconda!) aren't all that these snakes do. They double the jeopardy by getting into the plane's inner mechanisms and wirings and take out the flight's avionics system. And, of course, both pilots succumb to snake villainy. Oh, is there no end to these snake shenanigans?The acting, like the cheesy plot, is mediocre. Even my ER crush Julianna Margulies is just decent here. The one standout (other than Jackson) is Gerard Plunkett, who has brief moments as a rude-as-hell businessman, who had been ousted from first class. He really got under my skin, which is ironic, because later on...well, you'll see. And how does Samuel Jackson fare, acting wise? The usual. Jackson brings his patented ""cool,"" his ferocity, and his full-on commitment into the role of Special Agent Nelville Flynn. No surprise there. Whether armed with a taser, a fire extinguisher, a harpoon gun, or contemplating using a spork as a weapon, you daren't bet against him.The death-by-snake sequences are depicted in such a gruesome, graphic manner, yet they're done in such a broad, over-the-top style that the violence is blunted and the scenes go beyond being offensive to being surreal. Let's face it, in the right situations (like in movie theatres), we enjoy being scared. It's kinda like taking that ride in Universal, and King Kong shows up, and you jump and chuckle. Or maybe visiting a fun house. Or, again, like taking a Magic Mountain ride. That's what it felt like to me. And, of course, the audience went wild when Agent Flynn said what everyone had been waiting for: ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these  *&%(!!  snakes on this  *&%(!!  plane!""Samuel Jackson vowed on the MTV Movie Awards that Snakes on a Plane will win the best movie on MTV next year. I'm rooting for him.

1025781,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B000JBXHQY,Ian,"[20, 24]","I'm not ashamed to admit that from the moment I saw the title on the internet, I was hooked.  I absoloutly had to see the movie.  Well tonight, I finally did, complete with a t-shirt that had the movie logo (the two rattlesnakes intertwining the plane).  I sat down, and watched the movie with the greatest title since attack of the killer tomatoes.And did I like it?In the end, yes.  But I couldn't stop thinking about what could have been.Snakes on a plane follows the saga of an FBI agent (Samuel Jackson) as he protects a vital witness who's set to testify against a crime lord guy in los Angeles.  However, the crime lord has connections, and sets out to kill the witness.  And how does he intend to do that?With snakes.Lots and lots of hyper-crazed, super aggressive snakes.The concept of Snakes on a plane is just begging not to be taken too seriously.  It's the kind of movie that should seemingly be a campy, spoofy film that doesn't take itself seriously and has a lot of fun with the material.However, the movie is the exact opposite.  It takes itself quite seriously in all aspects, from charachters to the plot.  There are of course, jokes, but all of them are dialoge and not situations as you would think.  This is probably the biggest suprise of the movie:  It actually pulls off a crazy, unique idea very well.  The idea of these snakes on a 747 50,000 feet above the air is pulled off very well in a way that's believable and not hokey.The snakes, the stars of the movie (after Jackson), are hyper-aggressive and do come off as genuinly threatening.  They attack anything that moves and when there are dozens of them in the cramped interior of an airplane, the results aren't pretty.  This is where squemish viewers will probably want to stay away, because these snakes attack virtually all parts of the human body.  I don't want to give away too much, but if a snake bites and latches itself onto a human eyeball, you get an idea of what they'll go after.  This is a part of the film that is suprising:  It's very violent.  There are lots of bodies, lots of ""Oh yuck!"" moments all over, and one very effective jump moment that I won't give away.  Earlier this year, there were reshoots to make the film more gory for an R rating, and you can easily tell which scenes those are (the high heel for example).Samuel Jackson does an excellent job in this film.  He's belivable, and he of course, says the best lines in the film.  He's brave, courageous, and doesn't hesitate to get his hands dirty.  The other charachters are actually given quite a bit of screen time to help develop them and it's not very easy to tell who's going to be killed and who won't be.  There were some charachters I was sure who would die who diddn't, and a few who I thought would live and who diddn't.The film is just about the right length and moves quite belivably in terms of what to do next in the storyline because let's face it, you can't really come up with a lot of scenes diverging from ""Snakes attack people"" in a movie like this.  To the film's credit, it does manage to create attack scene after attack scene that doesn't seem redundant and repetitive.  However, the storyline does dry out in the climax of the story, which isn't a last, final showdown against the snakes as I thought it would be.  In fact, the snakes aren't the main factor of the climax, which I think they should be.Overall, Snakes on a plane isn't as hokey or dumb as you might think.  It takes itself seriously and pulls off the idea of serpants on a flying plane very well.  But...it's just not...right.  In my view, a film like this is just begging to be a spoofish movie and the end result isn't.  The first teaser trailer gave the impression that this was a silly and hokey movie, but sadly it was misleading advertising.  If I had helmed this film, it would have been closer to the vein of attack of the killer tomaotes, but the end result is good as it is.I'd recommend it, but I probably will never see it more then twice before I move on to something else.  Hopefully, it'll be spoofed in the next scary movie.Final rating:  6.8/10And if you're wondering, yes, Mr. Jackson does say ""I want these motherf***ing snakes off this motherf***king plane!!!"".  And yes, he says it very well, considering all the cheers in the theater.  This just might be the next Napoleon Dynamite in terms of quotes.",3,"It's good as is, but it could be so much more",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,4379,"[""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'moment', 'saw', 'title', 'internet', 'was', 'hooked', 'absoloutly', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'Well', 'tonight', 'finally', 'did', 'complete', 't-shirt', 'had', 'movie', 'logo', 'two', 'rattlesnakes', 'intertwining', 'plane', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'movie', 'greatest', 'title', 'attack', 'killer', 'tomatoes.And', 'did', 'end', 'yes', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been.Snakes', 'plane', 'saga', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'vital', 'witness', 'who', 'set', 'testify', 'crime', 'lord', 'guy', 'los', 'Angeles', 'However', 'crime', 'lord', 'connections', 'out', 'kill', 'witness', 'how', 'intend', 'do', 'snakes.Lots', 'lots', 'hyper-crazed', 'super', 'aggressive', 'snakes.The', 'concept', 'Snakes', 'plane', 'just', 'begging', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'kind', 'movie', 'should', 'seemingly', 'be', 'campy', 'spoofy', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'lot', 'fun', 'material.However', 'movie', 'exact', 'opposite', 'quite', 'seriously', 'aspects', 'charachters', 'plot', 'are', 'course', 'jokes', 'are', 'dialoge', 'not', 'situations', 'would', 'think', 'probably', 'biggest', 'suprise', 'movie', 'actually', 'crazy', 'unique', 'idea', 'very', 'well', 'idea', 'snakes', '747', '50,000', 'feet', 'air', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'way', 'believable', 'not', 'hokey.The', 'snakes', 'stars', 'movie', 'Jackson', 'are', 'hyper-aggressive', 'do', 'come', 'off', 'genuinly', 'threatening', 'attack', 'anything', 'moves', 'when', 'are', 'dozens', 'cramped', 'interior', 'airplane', 'results', 'are', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'where', 'squemish', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'stay', 'away', 'snakes', 'attack', 'virtually', 'parts', 'human', 'body', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'snake', 'bites', 'latches', 'human', 'eyeball', 'get', 'idea', 'what', ""'ll"", 'go', 'part', 'film', 'suprising', 'very', 'violent', 'are', 'lots', 'bodies', 'lots', 'Oh', 'yuck', 'moments', 'one', 'very', 'effective', 'jump', 'moment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'Earlier', 'year', 'were', 'reshoots', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'gory', 'R', 'rating', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'scenes', 'are', 'high', 'heel', 'example', '.Samuel', 'Jackson', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'belivable', 'course', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'brave', 'courageous', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'other', 'charachters', 'are', 'actually', 'given', 'quite', 'bit', 'screen', 'time', 'help', 'develop', 'not', 'very', 'easy', 'tell', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'were', 'charachters', 'was', 'sure', 'who', 'would', 'die', 'who', 'didd', ""n't"", 'few', 'who', 'thought', 'would', 'live', 'who', ""diddn't.The"", 'film', 'just', 'right', 'length', 'quite', 'belivably', 'terms', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'storyline', 'let', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'up', 'lot', 'scenes', 'diverging', 'Snakes', 'attack', 'people', 'movie', 'film', 'credit', 'manage', 'create', 'attack', 'scene', 'attack', 'scene', ""n't"", 'seem', 'redundant', 'repetitive', 'However', 'storyline', 'dry', 'out', 'climax', 'story', ""n't"", 'last', 'final', 'showdown', 'snakes', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fact', 'snakes', 'are', ""n't"", 'main', 'factor', 'climax', 'think', 'should', 'be.Overall', 'Snakes', 'plane', ""n't"", 'hokey', 'dumb', 'might', 'think', 'seriously', 'off', 'idea', 'serpants', 'flying', 'plane', 'very', 'well', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'view', 'film', 'just', 'begging', 'be', 'spoofish', 'movie', 'end', 'result', ""n't"", 'first', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'gave', 'impression', 'was', 'silly', 'hokey', 'movie', 'sadly', 'was', 'misleading', 'advertising', 'had', 'helmed', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'closer', 'vein', 'attack', 'killer', 'end', 'result', 'good', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'more', 'then', 'twice', 'move', 'something', 'else', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'spoofed', 'next', 'scary', 'movie.Final', 'rating', '6.8/10And', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'yes', 'Mr.', 'Jackson', 'say', 'want', 'motherf***ing', 'snakes', 'motherf***king', 'plane', 'yes', 'very', 'well', 'considering', 'cheers', 'theater', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'next', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'terms', 'quotes']",N/A

In one of the scenes in particular, when the man is in the restroom, it lost some of its impact because the snake looked slightly cartoonish, this wasn't evident on the big screen.If anyone is only seeing this for the first time on DVD you're going to miss on what caused the initial hype.  The film really came over much better on the big screen.Snakes on a plane - does exactly what it says on the tin, Samuel L Jackson perhaps the only man on the planet for such a job.Follow the story of a witness under government protection and the lengths the person being prosecuted will go to in order to make sure he dies.Vicious!Some of the snakes attack scenes are eye watering.On the big screen it was a five, some of the punch got lost in its translation to DVD though.It's a slippery customer alright.",4,Small screen robbed some of the magic,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1161,"['remember', 'watching', 'cinema', 'was', 'WOW', 'Enjoyable', 'slick', 'fast', 'funny', 'even', 'little', 'sexy.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'highlights', 'away', 'problems', 'bigger', 'screen', 'can', 'hide.For', 'example', 'close-ups', 'snakes', 'times', 'small', 'screen', 'higher', 'picture', 'density', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'cheesy', 'graphics', 'are', 'one', 'scenes', 'particular', 'when', 'man', 'restroom', 'lost', 'impact', 'snake', 'looked', 'slightly', 'cartoonish', 'was', ""n't"", 'evident', 'big', 'screen.If', 'anyone', 'only', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'going', 'miss', 'caused', 'initial', 'hype', 'film', 'really', 'came', 'over', 'much', 'better', 'big', 'screen.Snakes', 'plane', 'exactly', 'what', 'tin', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'perhaps', 'only', 'man', 'planet', 'job.Follow', 'story', 'witness', 'government', 'protection', 'lengths', 'person', 'being', 'prosecuted', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'make', 'sure', 'dies.Vicious', 'snakes', 'attack', 'scenes', 'are', 'eye', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'five', 'punch', 'got', 'lost', 'translation', 'DVD', 'though.It', 'slippery', 'customer', 'alright']",N/A

""Citizen Kane"" or ""The Godfather"" or ""Jean de Florette"" or ""Airplane!"", I would have stayed home with my DVDs.  No.  If I wanted subtle man-versus-vermin psychological horror, with organ music, I would have stayed home and listened to William Conrad as ""Leiningen vs. The Ants"".No.  No, no, no!  I wanted to go out on a Friday night and I wanted to see snakes on a plane.  Mo'fo' snakes on a mo'fo' plane.  And that is exactly what I got.The problems with this movie are very few.  Number one, the main character in this movie is a surfer dude but the movie was shot in British Columbia.  That's not a problem.  Good second unit photography will have you convinced that you're on Waikiki Beach, and you didn't come to this movie to see surfer dudes, anyway.  You wanted to see a CGI plane battling turbulence, and really vicious CGI snakes.Number two, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes for the snakes to get out into the cabin and start rearing and biting.  That's not a problem either.  Make a list of every delicate body part you'd expect a snake to bite, and once the snakes get out, game on.  You're waiting for the big python to show up?  Well, that's at least an hour wait, but once he's out, game on.Number three, it takes Samuel L. Jackson so long to drop That Line that you almost wonder if he's not ever going to say it.  Again, not a problem.Look, this movie was probably first-drafted in screenwriting class.  The writers care way too much about their reluctant FBI witness to a mob hit scenario, when the audience just wants snakes.  Snakes on a plane.  And then when we finally hit the airport, you can do a head count of the passengers and figure out who's going to die, how, and when.  There's the stuffy British business traveler (I had him pegged as the first to die), the hot-to-trot sexy young couple -- the girl's in pink thong panties, the aging flight attendant on her last flight, and the ambiguously gay male steward.  Finally, the overweight comedy co-pilot with the Texas accent.  The script writes itself.But it's got snakes.  Snakes on a plane.  If you took the time to come to this page and rate the movie one or two stars, you clearly didn't realize what movie you were buying tickets to go see and you shouldn't have been there in the first place.  If you want to see your awesomely bad snakes on a plane picture, this is literally the only movie to go see.Sequels: Snakes on a Train.  Snakes in Portland, Maine.  Snakes in the Drain.

""Snakes on a Plane"" does not pretend to be anything more than it is - a creepy crawly summer fling of crazy, wacked-out fun. It's even better than it has to be, with a semi-plausible scenario (young witness to a mob murder needs to be killed before testifying) to give the snakes a reason for being on the plane in the first place.The snakes themselves are terrific, slithering with frightening stealth and attacking with unbelievable ferocity. The scene where they first attack, I swear, is 20 minutes long and is just gut-crunchingly horrifying. The snakes are everywhere and come out of absolutely every nook and cranny you can imagine. Victims get bitten in every conceivable anatomical location, including every conceivable location, if you catch my drift. Every time the horror seems to stop, it picks up again, all the way to the end. You literally have to be on your way out of the theater before you're sure that the attacks are over.Most of the acting is decent, but Samuel L. Jackson and Julianna Margulies are standouts. As an FBI agent and a soon-to-retire flight attendant, respectively, they give the film a needed dash of grown-up seriousness and believability that gives the rest of the characters something solid to orbit. The writing is humdrum, but the plotting is terrific. There are so many obvious victims (puppies, babies, little kids) that you're not entirely sure who's going to get it until they do.

Jackson is going to be in it, and I went: ""Hmm, might be worth a watch because I enjoy watching him. But I still thought it would be lame, but boy, this movie crawled up my seat and bit me hard. It had a lot of intense action and was actually kind of realistic. Too many movies take themselves too seriously - this movie is at the other end of the spectrum. It clearly was developed from the start as pure escapism entertainment. You're not going to have a better understanding of humanity or yourself at the end of this movie. You will laugh out loud, you will cheer for Sam, and you'll love most of the characters (the one's that make it that is).David R. Ellis, the man at the helm, is a former stunt director and what matters in stunt sequences is timing and good pacing. His previous films demonstrated that - Final Destination 2 and Cellular - and here we get the same thing again. Thin plot, good tension. The obviously CGI snakes look pretty decent and make for some good creature flick fun with all of their jumping, hissing, and crawling just about everywhere that is humanly possible. Samuel L. Jackson gives an amazing performance. He never gives in to the campiness of the movie, and plays it completely straight. The self control he exhibits here should earn him a special Award.I recommend watching this movie, for the sake of the snakes. I honestly thought this movie was very amusing as well, with the whole idea of ""snakes on a plane"".

You have snakes on a plane and with nothing really surprising happening. I mean what makes it different from any movie with terrorists on a plane ""Executive Decision, Air Force One"" is that there's snakes instead of terrorists. Otherwise you have the usual stuff. You know every pilot will die so the heroe has to land the plane. You also know he'll most likely ask out the hot flight attendant and that everyone will live happily ever after. So ok it has snakes instead of terrorists but that's about the only difference.Yet I'd still recommend it for a boring friday night at home. It's entertaining with funny snake attacks when the first start to attack. But after awhile the whole snake on a plane thing gets tired. I mean how much could actually be done with snakes on a plane after all. I don't even think the film will make you jump, maybe cringe here and there if you don't like snakes but that's about it. Plus I don't think that Samual L. Jackson's so called new classic line isn't even that great. Samual L. Jackson and the line where he curses is probably the only thing that kept it from being on Sci-Fi channel. Instead then it would star Dean Caine and not Samual L. Jackson.

(They are, however, the types of people who go around claiming to have ""a Ph.D in common sense."")Opinion Two goes somethng like this: ""Well, it was fun seeing it in a crowded theater where the audience got into the spirit of it."" In other words, people who hold this opinion actually LIKED the movie, but they think that coming right out and saying so makes them look bad.Opinion Three - the BEST opinion - is that ""Snakes on a Plane,"" is actually quite brilliant. No, it's not the best picture of the year. But it may be the best example in quite awhile of a movie that knows exactly what it's about. Start with that title. It's stupid in just the right way - so dumb it's smart.More importantly, the title makes a promise that the film itself manages to deliver in the same over-the-top spirit. For what those who hold Opinions One and Two seem not to grasp is that ""Snakes on a Plane"" is a COMEDY. Not an action movie with a few laughs. Not a horror movie with some funny moments. It's a COMEDY with some action and horror thrown in for good measure. Better still, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is no dumb joke! In exploiting the cliches and conventions of action flicks of the past couple of decades, it rises at times to the level of brilliant satire. So, you think there were a few plot holes in that Jean-Claude Van Damme movie you caught on cable the other night? Hell, ""Snakes on a Plane"" has plot holes in its plot holes! Or do you ever notice how in some movies a character will just...disappear? Well, welcome to the world of ""Snakes,"" where major characters vanish with nary a trace...including the guy whose idea it is to put snakes on the plane in the first place!! GENIUS!So then what's the difference between a plot hole in the latest Steven Segall opus and a plot hole in ""Snakes?"" Well, the folks behind the Segall flick just hope you'll be so distracted by all the crap being blown up that you won't notice. The folks behind ""Snakes"" WANT you to notice. The real point, after all, is to get to the part where Samuel L. Jackson is battling it out with the @#!!@&* snakes on the #@*!!@! plane. It's as if the filmmakers decided, well, why make a set-up simply inconsequential if you can go just a little farther and make it ludicrous? Somehow, they manage to take the sloppiness of dumb-down cinema, amp it up just a litte, and spin it into comic gold.Ironically, it's only when Jackson takes on the titular Snakes does the movie lose a bit of its edge. Sure, there's some solid snake attack action, and there's a planeload of properly terrified (and hilariously cliched) passengers and flight attendants. But, personally, I could have used a bit more of Jackson picking snakes by the neck and tossing them to one side. It's surprising that the filmmakers didn't hit their punchline a bit harder. With so much fun to be hand on the way, though, this is a fairly minor criticism.So make no mistake: ""Snakes on a Plane"" is as void of logic as any movie you're ever likely to see. But it rides a conceit so clever - it's a movie that KNOWS it's a movie - that it flies straight over the heads of a public happy to feast on a diet of bloated, underwritten action fare. As such, it's brilliantly over the top.",4,Now...what was this movie about?,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,3473,"['are', 'when', 'down', 'only', 'three', 'possible', 'opinions', 'can', 'have', 'movie', 'Lowliest', 'movie', 'DUMB', 'so', 'STUPID', 'saying', 'folks', 'who', 'hold', 'opinion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'asked', 'join', 'Mensa', 'time', 'soon', 'are', 'however', 'types', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'around', 'claiming', 'have', 'Ph.D', 'common', 'sense', 'Opinion', 'Two', 'somethng', 'Well', 'was', 'fun', 'seeing', 'crowded', 'theater', 'where', 'audience', 'got', 'spirit', 'other', 'words', 'people', 'who', 'hold', 'opinion', 'actually', 'LIKED', 'movie', 'think', 'coming', 'right', 'out', 'saying', 'so', 'look', 'bad.Opinion', 'Three', 'BEST', 'opinion', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'actually', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'No', 'not', 'best', 'picture', 'year', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'example', 'quite', 'awhile', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'about', 'Start', 'title', 'stupid', 'just', 'right', 'way', 'so', 'smart.More', 'importantly', 'title', 'promise', 'film', 'deliver', 'same', 'over-the-top', 'spirit', 'what', 'who', 'hold', 'Opinions', 'One', 'Two', 'seem', 'not', 'grasp', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'COMEDY', 'Not', 'action', 'movie', 'few', 'laughs', 'Not', 'horror', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'COMEDY', 'action', 'horror', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Better', 'still', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'dumb', 'joke', 'exploiting', 'cliches', 'conventions', 'action', 'flicks', 'past', 'couple', 'decades', 'times', 'level', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'So', 'think', 'were', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'caught', 'cable', 'other', 'night', 'Hell', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'plot', 'holes', 'plot', 'holes', 'do', 'ever', 'notice', 'how', 'movies', 'character', 'will', 'just', 'disappear', 'Well', 'welcome', 'world', 'Snakes', 'where', 'major', 'characters', 'vanish', 'trace', 'including', 'guy', 'idea', 'put', 'snakes', 'plane', 'first', 'place', 'GENIUS', 'So', 'then', 'what', 'difference', 'plot', 'hole', 'latest', 'Steven', 'Segall', 'opus', 'plot', 'hole', 'Snakes', 'Well', 'folks', 'Segall', 'flick', 'just', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'be', 'so', 'distracted', 'crap', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'folks', 'Snakes', 'WANT', 'notice', 'real', 'point', 'get', 'part', 'where', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'battling', '@', '@', '*', '@', '*', '@', 'plane', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'well', 'why', 'make', 'set-up', 'simply', 'inconsequential', 'can', 'go', 'just', 'little', 'farther', 'make', 'ludicrous', 'Somehow', 'manage', 'take', 'sloppiness', 'dumb-down', 'cinema', 'amp', 'up', 'just', 'litte', 'spin', 'comic', 'gold.Ironically', 'only', 'when', 'Jackson', 'titular', 'Snakes', 'movie', 'lose', 'bit', 'edge', 'Sure', 'solid', 'snake', 'attack', 'action', 'planeload', 'properly', 'terrified', 'hilariously', 'cliched', 'passengers', 'flight', 'attendants', 'personally', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'Jackson', 'picking', 'snakes', 'neck', 'tossing', 'one', 'side', 'surprising', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'punchline', 'bit', 'harder', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'be', 'hand', 'way', 'though', 'fairly', 'minor', 'criticism.So', 'make', 'mistake', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'void', 'logic', 'movie', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'see', 'conceit', 'so', 'clever', 'movie', 'movie', 'straight', 'heads', 'public', 'happy', 'feast', 'diet', 'bloated', 'underwritten', 'action', 'fare', 'such', 'brilliantly', 'top']",N/A

However, Samuel Jackson's line from the movie will be the most quoted line this season. I'll delete the details, but briefly, surfer dude Sean, (Nathan Phillips) witnesses a brutal murder while on holiday in Hawaii. The killers try to kill him & he is rescued by FBI dude, Nelville (Jackson). It is decided to fly back to LA for Sean to be a witness. The murderers, presumably still at large, plan to bring down the plane one way or the other with crates full of vipers stored in the cargo hold. Half way thru the flight their cages open & the fun begins. You know the death toll will be high. This is all too funny to be taken seriouly as a horror movie. The first thing that occurred to me was another spoof on the old 60's movie ""Airport"" or even it's spoof ""Airplane"". The characters are presented for you to love/hate root for or against. There's the nasty old white businessman, a super-star & his funny, chubby  body-guards, hot stews, gay stews & a cute little boy that gets bit. There are two new members of the mile high club, a lot of Heather Graham look alike starlets & even a baby. Gratuitous sex, language & grisly snake bite scenes give this is an R-rating but that's  what they were aiming for. It's a B-movie but a good one. Samuel Jackson is 90% of this movie with help from stew, Julianne Margulies. It's good summertme, entertainment. I suspect the extras on the dvd when it comes out will be worth seeing.

1025798,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000JBXHQY,Joshua Koppel,"[0, 0]","This is a typical action flick in that it does little to make sense.  A young man witnesses a gangster kill a man in Hawaii.  Samuel Jackson is an agent trying to get him to go to L.A. and testify against the gangster.  They are set to take a plane but switch right at the last moment for protection.  The gangster has arranged for a crate full of deadly snakes to be on that plane.  The leis given to the departing flyers have been sprayed to make the snakes crazy.  Midway between the island and the mainland, a bomb blows open the case and the snakes are loose.  Very quickly the snakes are all over the place and people are dying.  The rest of the film has two parts.  In the plane people are trying to protect themselves from the snakes and keep the plane in the air.  On the ground efforts are under way to make sure the proper antivenoms are available.  And that's the movie.  Seriously.Many things do not make sense in this movie.  First there is the lei and kiss.  These are being given to people leaving Hawaii, not arriving (they even say ""Aloha""!).  The bad guys only find out the right plane at the last minute but manage to get the crate on the plane and hidden.  The security is lame enough to think a cat in a catbox is what is making the highly-trained dogs react (they are trained not to react to cats).  The snakes are in the crate for two hours smelling the flowers and don't bother one another in the least.  First class is entirely upstairs (atop a staircase from The Love Boat or The Titanic).  When everyone is kicked out of first class there is more than enough room for all of them elsewhere on the plane.  First class is also a huge palatial space (not usually found on commercial aircraft).  The cockpit door sometimes opens onto the main deck and sometimes onto the first class deck.  Jackson uses a code on a keypad to get into the cockpit but later has to force the lock with a knife (he doesn't even try the code).  The murder took place in Hawaii so why are they going to California to prosecute?  We are expected to believe the gangster tried to kill the witness, returned to Los Angeles, made a deal to acquire the snakes, had them shipped off to Hawaii, and then loaded onto the plane (all before Jackson and the witness could leave).  At the end Jackson and the witness are both approached by women who ask them to call them later.  The woman interested in Jackson does not give him her number (and he doesn't ask for it).  The woman interested in the witness does give him her number.  The list goes on and on.  All in all this makes about as much sense as Armageddon but as an action film people will probably love it.

""Snakes on a Plane"" is probably the funniest movie of 2006. So over the top and silly that even the toughest critic will laugh. Before I begin my review, I must say that moviegoers should not take this movie seriously. This is the kind of movie where you leave your brain in the parking lot and enjoy the silliness of the ride.Story:The story is almost irrelevant but here I go, a young man witnessed a brutal crime while he was riding his bike around the woods in Hawaii. To testify against the bad guys, he has to fly to LA with the FBI agent Nelville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson). For strange reasons, the bad guys came out with a great idea to get rid of the witness by putting dozens of deadly and angry snakes--including an anaconda from another movie--in the plane. It's up to our hero Nelville to save the day.Review:If you enjoy B horror movies from the 80s, this movie is for you. Although these angry foes took their time to show up, they did it in such a funny and unbelievable way that it's almost impossible not to laugh. The amusing part is that the movie portraits these snakes as vicious and intelligent (remember 'Anaconda') and the passengers as dumb, but brave.This ""war"" between humans and snakes continued throughout the film where both sides take causalities. I don't see this movie as a horror movie, this is a comedy and I'm pretty sure the people who made this film think that way also. Even the fake Jerry Goldsmith music score tries to give the movie a ""serious"" action mood, but every time I heard it, it made me laugh. The best part of the film is probably when Samuel Jackson gives his ""speech"" about the angry snakes taking over the plane.The Verdict:A feel good B flick with tons of jokes, unintentional laughs and impossible snake attacks.

1025800,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,B000JBXHQY,JR Pinto,"[2, 5]","OK - nobody expected this movie to be good.  The question is: ""Is it so bad it's good?""  The answer: kind of.  Watching it, I had the feeling I was back in the seventies; the movie feels like one of those old disaster movies (or The Love Boat, for that matter).  The first act introduces the characters - and I use that word loosely.  I am assuming that everything was kept clich&eacute;d for a reason - so we can laugh at the cardboard characters, each with their ""quirk"" or defining characteristic.  The way this is handled is right out of Fantasy Island - each character is handed a lay as he or she boards.  I was expecting them to wear nametags that read ""Victim #1,"" ""Victim #2,"" etc.Some of the filmmaking is cringe-inducing.  The worst part was when the stereotypically effeminate flight attendant seems to hit on a kick-boxer (of course there is a kick-boxer on board).  Then there are the plot holes - the way the snakes seem to go from being everywhere to being isolated.  I won't go into these things - you just have to check your sense of logic at the door.What people want to know is, does the movie pay off?  It does in some ways.  Once the snakes are loosed, there is a significant amount of gore and violence.  There is also a gratuitous and welcomed sex-scene.  Snakes attack passengers in every possible way.  By the time Samuel L. Jackson utters his famous, Internet-written line, the audience I saw it with (teenagers) exploded.  Watching it, I was reminded of the late filmmaker, William Castle.  This is a throwback to when movies were schlocky and fun.

I was expecting the film to take itself lightly and just have fun with itself, unfortunetly this movie took itself seriously and ended up being absolute garbage. I laughed more in this movie than I did in Talladega Nights, and no that isn't a good thing. I loved how analysts everywhere were predicting the movie to burst out with a 40+ million dollar opening and the movie barely reached $20 million. The point being here that the entire country knew it was stupid and realized that spending $10 to see this was insane. Luckily I see my movies for free since I work at a theater. The film needs no explaining, it's snakes on a plane and nothing else. The CGI is incredibly bad, and the snakes look like cartoons. The acting is bad, the sets are bad, the dialogue is trash, and the movie itself will be forgotten. Never have I seen so much hype for so much nothing.ACTING: Samuel L. Jackson screaming and killing snakes, and that's about it.BOTTOM LINE: In this movie a breast, a penis, and a buttox all get bitten by snakes. An obese woman also gets sexual arrousal from a snake.

1025806,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000JBXHQY,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 2]","""Snakes On A Plane"" is exactly that, a story about our legless friends on the attack aboard a passenger plane.  Of course, there's more to the story than that.  The film opens with an unlucky biker/surfer, Sean Jones(Nathan Phillips), seeing a man hung from his feet and beaten to death with a baseball bat.  The problem is that the murderer is a mob boss, Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson), who will stop at nothing in order to silence the witness.  In steps the FBI and agent Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson), who promises to get Jones out of Hawaii and into Los Angeles to give his testimony and put Kim away forever.From there, the rest of the film takes place aboard a plane with a mixed bag of characters.  There's the good (Julianna Margulies, Kenan Thompson, Rachel Blanchard, and Lin Shaye) the okay (Sunny Mabrey, Bruce James, and Flex Alexander) and the terrible (David Koechner).  There are plenty of honest laughs and even a few tense moments that help keep this baby in the air.  The story never tries too hard to trick the viewer.  It just rolls along saying, ""Yep, there's still MORE snakes left to find on this plane.""  As one stumbling block is cleared, another one slithers in to take its place.Something is to be said for the soundtrack of this film, which features everything from R&B; to 80's New Wave Revival.  Don't miss the closing credits tune, ""Snakes On A Plane (Bring It),"" by Cobra Starship with the Academy Is, Gym Class Heroes and The Sound.  It's an excellent tune.So why four stars?  For the simple fact that this movie knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be anything better or worse than that.  It's a fun flight of terror that does deserve more than one viewing.

And what a tag line!Imagine, if you will, being the bad, bad defendant in a Federal case and knowing that some wimpy kid is going to testify against you. You have options: (A) Let Sir Galahad run his mouth and take your chances, (B) whack the kid on the ground before he opens his piehole, (C) make sure that the plane he's on never gets where it's going.Option A is basically out. Option B is effective, but unoriginal. Option C is possible, but given increased airline security, things that go ""boom"" on board planes are a no-no. So what do you do?Aha! You hire some Manson Family holdout who deals in venomous snakes to load the plane with all manner of scaly, slithering, hissing, fanged Eve deceivers, about a thousand of them, who promptly crawl their way into every crevice of the plane and begin attacking the passengers and crew.This is the absurd premise of this ridiculously campy film. If you fear snakes, don't watch it. If you don't fear snakes, you might afterward. Or you might just say, ""Uhh-uhh-uhh-uhh.""Straight out of Andy Sidaris's HARD TICKET TO HAWAII playbook we are entertained by snakes that, seeking warmth, crawl up girls' skirts, nestle in their cleavages, jump out of toilets to bite guys who are standing up, er, doing their business, drop out of the overhead luggage compartments to eat people's eyes, kill the entire flight crew en masse, and leave the plane flying pilotless over the Pacific in a typhoon. The director occasionally switches tenses, and we get to see the action through the eyes of the snakes. Roll a natural two.While all this is going on, the passengers are of course screaming in terror, charging from one end of the plane to the other and climbing all over each other to get away from the snakes, even to the point of crushing one another to death. Oh, did I mention that the electrical system fails, making most of this chaos happen IN THE DARK?There's only one man who can save the day, and that's Samuel L. Jackson as the Federal Marshal who is protecting said material witness. Mr. Jackson puts aside all of his innate dignity to play this role, and is clearly having a good, good time screaming, ""Arrrrrrgh!"" along with the rest of the cast. Finally though, he recruits a kid who hasn't gotten the high score on Chuck Yeager's Air Combat for PS2 to land the plane. Oh yeah, man.The gross-out factor is pretty high, but so is the laugh factor. Memorable dialogue includes . . .Passenger---""There's a snake guy on the phone is gonna help us.""Stewardess---""I never thought I would ever ask this question, but does anybody here know how to fly this plane?""Guy with first aid kit---""The book says to suck out the poison,"" to which guy with his pants down says, ""WHAT????"". . . and so on. The scriptwriters leave no cliche unused as they turn the AIRPORT disaster genre totally on its head. Less slapstick, more intelligent and more hard-edged than the AIRPLANE series, this movie will instantly appeal to anybody who understands the art of the practical joke.Pure, side-splitting yuckiness, SNAKES ON A PLANE will have you looking under your seat the next time you fly the friendly skies.",5,"""I have had ENOUGH of these mother****ing snakes on this mother****ing plane!""",1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,3203,"['Even', 'title', 'film', 'go', 'Uhh-uhh-uhh-uhh', 'what', 'tag', 'line', 'Imagine', 'will', 'being', 'bad', 'bad', 'defendant', 'Federal', 'case', 'knowing', 'wimpy', 'kid', 'going', 'testify', 'have', 'options', 'Let', 'Sir', 'Galahad', 'run', 'mouth', 'take', 'chances', 'B', 'whack', 'kid', 'ground', 'piehole', 'C', 'make', 'sure', 'plane', 'never', 'where', 'going.Option', 'A', 'basically', 'out', 'Option', 'B', 'effective', 'unoriginal', 'Option', 'C', 'possible', 'given', 'increased', 'airline', 'security', 'things', 'go', 'boom', 'board', 'planes', 'are', 'no-no', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'Aha', 'hire', 'Manson', 'Family', 'holdout', 'who', 'venomous', 'snakes', 'load', 'plane', 'manner', 'scaly', 'slithering', 'hissing', 'fanged', 'Eve', 'deceivers', 'thousand', 'who', 'promptly', 'crawl', 'way', 'crevice', 'plane', 'begin', 'attacking', 'passengers', 'crew.This', 'absurd', 'premise', 'ridiculously', 'campy', 'film', 'fear', 'snakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'fear', 'snakes', 'might', 'afterward', 'might', 'just', 'say', 'Uhh-uhh-uhh-uhh', 'Straight', 'Andy', 'Sidaris', 'HARD', 'TICKET', 'TO', 'HAWAII', 'playbook', 'are', 'entertained', 'snakes', 'seeking', 'warmth', 'crawl', 'up', 'girls', 'skirts', 'nestle', 'cleavages', 'jump', 'toilets', 'bite', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'standing', 'up', 'er', 'doing', 'business', 'drop', 'overhead', 'luggage', 'compartments', 'eat', 'people', 'eyes', 'kill', 'entire', 'flight', 'crew', 'en', 'masse', 'leave', 'plane', 'flying', 'pilotless', 'Pacific', 'typhoon', 'director', 'occasionally', 'tenses', 'get', 'see', 'action', 'eyes', 'snakes', 'Roll', 'natural', 'two.While', 'going', 'passengers', 'are', 'course', 'screaming', 'terror', 'charging', 'one', 'end', 'plane', 'other', 'climbing', 'other', 'get', 'away', 'snakes', 'even', 'point', 'crushing', 'one', 'death', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'electrical', 'system', 'making', 'most', 'chaos', 'happen', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'day', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Federal', 'Marshal', 'who', 'protecting', 'said', 'material', 'witness', 'Mr.', 'Jackson', 'aside', 'innate', 'dignity', 'play', 'role', 'clearly', 'having', 'good', 'good', 'time', 'screaming', 'Arrrrrrgh', 'rest', 'cast', 'Finally', 'kid', 'who', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'high', 'score', 'Chuck', 'Yeager', 'Air', 'Combat', 'PS2', 'land', 'plane', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'man.The', 'gross-out', 'factor', 'pretty', 'high', 'so', 'laugh', 'factor', 'Memorable', 'dialogue', '.Passenger', 'snake', 'guy', 'phone', 'gon', 'help', 'Stewardess', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'ask', 'question', 'anybody', 'here', 'know', 'how', 'fly', 'plane', 'Guy', 'first', 'aid', 'kit', 'book', 'suck', 'out', 'poison', 'guy', 'pants', 'down', 'WHAT', 'so', 'scriptwriters', 'leave', 'cliche', 'unused', 'turn', 'AIRPORT', 'disaster', 'genre', 'totally', 'head', 'Less', 'slapstick', 'more', 'intelligent', 'more', 'hard-edged', 'AIRPLANE', 'series', 'movie', 'will', 'instantly', 'appeal', 'anybody', 'who', 'art', 'practical', 'joke.Pure', 'side-splitting', 'yuckiness', 'SNAKES', 'ON', 'A', 'PLANE', 'will', 'have', 'looking', 'seat', 'next', 'time', 'fly', 'friendly', 'skies']",N/A

Earlier, Sean had witnessed the murder of a prosecutor by the local Hawaiian mob.  Flynn has recruited Sean to fly to L.A. and testify against the mob.Of course, the mob wants to eliminate any and all witnesses.  Somehow, they got information of a witness flying to L.A.  So, snakes have been placed in the cargo next to boxes of leis.  The leis have been sprayed with pheremones, which cause aggression in the snakes.Predictably, the snakes eventually find their way out of cages and take over the plane.  They attack anything and everything in their sights.  People are just dying left and right.  The survivors are doing their best to increase the distance between themselves and the snakes.Meanwhile, Flynn, Sean, the pilots and the flight attendants have to figure out why the snakes were put there in the first place.  During this investigation, information is discovered.  However, will these tidbits of information save the crew and passengers from death?This is obviously some cheap date movie.  Perfect for the girl to jump and scream and retreat into the guy's arms for comfort.  However, I do have to admit something.  It does have one good scary moment that'll make you jump.  The rest are yawn-inducing.There are a few scenes where the snakes are real.  You can tell by how they move.  The rest are computer-generated (fake).  And there are lot of them.

1025814,ASSCA9IS0GWF5,B000JBXHQY,Laszlo Matyas,"[3, 5]","If you haven't experienced the hype, don't even bother with this movie. Snakes On A Plane became a cult phenomenon (and a deserved one, at that) because of the surreal, and quite accidental, viral marketing campaign that preceded its release. You probably know the story: before anybody even saw a preview, the movie became a legend in the Internet community, thanks to its transcendently moronic title and the mouthwatering prospect of Samuel L. Jackson yelling ""I have had it with these motherf***ing snakes on this motherf***ing plane!"" People loved it because the whole thing smacked of ultrareflexsive parody, the ""Chuck Norris Fact"" ideal transformed into a feature film. The whole thing was a fantastic demonstration of the Internet's power as a cultural force. It was hilarious, it was infectious, it was brilliant, and it was, er, postmodern. And then the movie came out.Snakes On A Plane reminds us that, postmodern or not, it's probably not a good idea to judge a movie based on the succinctness of its title. See, here's the thing: Snakes On A Plane is, in and of itself, a stunningly mediocre movie. Fast forward past the opening credits and Samuel Jackson's now legendary climactic line, and you've got a dull, formulaic action movie, full of forgettable dialogue, paper-thin characters, so-so action sequences, and respectably goofy comic relief. Sam Jackson is awesome in it, but he's Samuel freaking Jackson so that's to be expected. It's cheap entertainment, and it's also exactly the kind of thing that this movie's hype was satirizing. It's self-parody pure and simple, and the movie's occasional winking admissions to that fact don't really change much. Watch it with a group of friends, maybe drink a shot every time somebody gets bitten by a snake, and be sure to jump up and cheer when Sam Jackson says The Line.

Prior to that point she had jumped and screamed eight times, hit me four times, and dug her fingernails into my arm three times.  She also took several opportunities to tell me that I owed her because I was making her watch this movie, but that was before she got up and left me there alone.  To be fair, she did return for the end of the movie, by which time she had apparently reconsidered our situation during that interim period and had upgraded by status so that she now informed me that she owned me and that she would determine how and when I would be made to pay for this.When I suggested going to a movie today because Friday is (usually) the day that new films show up in town and she asked me what we could go see I had said, ""Snakes on a Plane.""  I had expected her to say ""No.""  Actually I was hoping that she would say, ""There is no way that I am going to see that m****r-f********g film about those m****r-f********g snakes on that m****r-f********g plane,"" but that is simply not her style.  So I did not really think she would want to see this film and would maintain that she went of her own free will.  However, when I suggested that we would have to own this film when it came out on DVD she told me that would be the day I would be moving out of the house.  Consequently, I have to suggest that ""Snakes on a Plane"" might not be the best date movie currently available at your local cinema.The premise of ""SoaP"" (great acronym) is elegantly simple.  Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses the murder of an L.A. district attorney who is vacationing in Hawai'i.  Being flown to Los Angeles to testify against the killer, Jones is in the care of FBI Agent Nelville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson).  However, the killer has arranged for what appears to be at least one of every venomous snake on the face of the planet to be let loose during the flight, thereby realizing the title of the film.  Also include in the cast are: Julianna Margulies as Claire Miller, the flight attendant who is on her final flight; Flex Alexander as Three Gi's, the rap star aboard the plane; Kenan Thompson as Troy, one of the rapper's two hefty bodyguards; and Rachel Blanchard as Mercedes, who appears to be a Paris Hilton wannabe.  Basically everybody on the film is a designed character (e.g., the irate First Class passenger, the newlyweds, the kick boxer, etc.), and when we meet them we are not really trying to learn anything about them, but just calculate their chances of being alive by the end credits (which you should stick around and watch for the music video).  Fortunately there are almost as many heroes as there are victims on this particular doomed flight.Basically, this 2006 film delivers exactly what the title promises.  Despite the famous line paraphrased and censored above, Jackson's character does not curse much in this film, which is a shame because nobody curses like Samuel L. Jackson (and that includes the character of Al Swearagen on ""Deadwood,"" and that fellow is no slouch when it comes to the art of the profane tirade).  What is important is that they come up with a way for the snakes to start attacking everybody on the plane at once, although we have to build up to that with an initial series of attacks before the snakes hit the fan.  I was not happy that they kept making the same mistake several times (leaving one person alone in the cockpit flying the plane), and the green ""snake-o-vision"" was nothing special, but otherwise I was able to put both logic and reasoning on the back burner for this one.  Plus, my wife fled the theater and you just have to round up for any movie that makes that happen.",5,"I have never had my date flee a movie theater until I went to go see ""Snakes on a Plane""",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,3746,"['wife', 'made', 'as', 'far', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'python', 'up', 'then', 'fled', 'theater', 'Prior', 'point', 'had', 'jumped', 'screamed', 'eight', 'times', 'hit', 'four', 'times', 'dug', 'fingernails', 'arm', 'three', 'times', 'also', 'took', 'several', 'opportunities', 'tell', 'owed', 'was', 'making', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'got', 'up', 'left', 'alone', 'be', 'fair', 'did', 'return', 'end', 'movie', 'time', 'had', 'apparently', 'reconsidered', 'situation', 'interim', 'period', 'had', 'upgraded', 'status', 'now', 'informed', 'owned', 'would', 'determine', 'how', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'pay', 'this.When', 'suggested', 'going', 'movie', 'today', 'Friday', 'usually', 'day', 'new', 'films', 'show', 'up', 'town', 'asked', 'what', 'could', 'go', 'see', 'had', 'said', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'had', 'expected', 'say', 'Actually', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'say', 'way', 'am', 'going', 'see', 'm****r-f********g', 'film', 'm****r-f********g', 'snakes', 'm****r-f********g', 'plane', 'simply', 'not', 'style', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'think', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'maintain', 'went', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'However', 'when', 'suggested', 'would', 'have', 'own', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'told', 'would', 'be', 'day', 'would', 'be', 'moving', 'house', 'Consequently', 'have', 'suggest', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'date', 'movie', 'currently', 'available', 'local', 'cinema.The', 'premise', 'SoaP', 'great', 'acronym', 'elegantly', 'simple', 'Sean', 'Jones', 'Nathan', 'Phillips', 'murder', 'L.A.', 'district', 'attorney', 'who', 'vacationing', 'Hawai', 'i', 'Being', 'flown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'testify', 'killer', 'Jones', 'care', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Nelville', 'Flynn', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'However', 'killer', 'arranged', 'what', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'venomous', 'snake', 'face', 'planet', 'be', 'let', 'loose', 'flight', 'thereby', 'realizing', 'title', 'film', 'Also', 'include', 'cast', 'are', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Claire', 'Miller', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'final', 'flight', 'Flex', 'Alexander', 'Three', 'Gi', 'rap', 'star', 'plane', 'Kenan', 'Thompson', 'Troy', 'one', 'rapper', 'two', 'hefty', 'bodyguards', 'Rachel', 'Blanchard', 'Mercedes', 'who', 'be', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'wannabe', 'Basically', 'everybody', 'film', 'designed', 'character', 'e.g.', 'irate', 'First', 'Class', 'passenger', 'newlyweds', 'kick', 'boxer', 'etc', 'when', 'meet', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'trying', 'learn', 'anything', 'just', 'calculate', 'chances', 'being', 'alive', 'end', 'credits', 'should', 'stick', 'around', 'watch', 'music', 'video', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'almost', 'many', 'heroes', 'are', 'victims', 'particular', 'doomed', 'flight.Basically', '2006', 'film', 'delivers', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', 'famous', 'line', 'paraphrased', 'censored', 'Jackson', 'character', 'not', 'curse', 'much', 'film', 'shame', 'nobody', 'curses', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'Al', 'Swearagen', 'Deadwood', 'fellow', 'slouch', 'when', 'art', 'profane', 'tirade', 'What', 'important', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'snakes', 'start', 'attacking', 'everybody', 'plane', 'once', 'have', 'build', 'up', 'initial', 'series', 'attacks', 'snakes', 'hit', 'fan', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'kept', 'making', 'same', 'mistake', 'several', 'times', 'leaving', 'one', 'person', 'alone', 'cockpit', 'flying', 'plane', 'green', 'snake-o-vision', 'was', 'nothing', 'special', 'otherwise', 'was', 'able', 'put', 'logic', 'reasoning', 'back', 'burner', 'one', 'wife', 'fled', 'theater', 'just', 'have', 'round', 'up', 'movie', 'happen']",N/A

There are spitting cobras, coral snakes, you name it. All of them are hyped up on pheremones and out to attack. And attack they do. If you can imagine a grotesque way for a snake to attach a person, it's in here. Snakes bite half-naked women on the breast. They bite a man on his privates while he's using the restroom. They stick their heads into peoples' mouths and bite their throat from the inside. They go heavily for the ""ick"" factor here.The also love the ""jump"" factor, with many situations where snakes leap out at you, or up at you, or down at you. Even when we re-wound it to see a scene again, it still caused us to jump.We found ourselves laughing at many scenes which were supposed to be scary, especially scenes involving rubbery snakes leaping directly for exposed breasts or so on. They seemed to have a sense of what specifically to attack. Also, real snakes would bite and retreat, to protect their fangs. They wouldn't for example bite a guy's exposed ""male member"" and then stay attached to it while the guy flailed around for 30 seconds in agony.Still, if you're an action movie fan, or maybe just to see what all the hype was about, it might be fun to rent this and take a look for yourself.

Everyone from writers at Rolling Stones Magazine and Entertainment Weekly to the pale, basement-huddled blogger-for-life had something to say, and almost everything they said was, ""YES!""  Articles were written about producers (who wished to remain anonymous) kicking themselves over having missed the chance to be a part of a movie that, since ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,"" had ""the best title ever.""The funny thing was, in spite of all of this heightened expectation, when the movie finally came out, hardly anyone went to see it.  It wasn't as if people DID go, realized it sucked, and told everyone else.  Bodies failed to materialize at the ticket counters.  It was as if the name of the flick was good enough, as if the collective consciousness had squeezed so many jokes out of the clownish title that it couldn't imagine any more fun was to be had, even in the movie itself.  Or maybe they were expecting something other than, well, snakes on a plane.  Bears on a boat, perhaps?  Dragons in a diner?  Pirahnas in a pool?  Bees on a bus?  Sharks in a subway!  Tigers on a trolly!  Wolves on a ski lift!  Lemurs on a ...... wait a minute.  Where was I?  Oh, yeah.  The movie.Young Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses the murder of a high profile D.A. at the hands of an even higher profile mob boss, Chen Leong, who has a policy of ""No Witness Left Alive.""  Good policy.  For a mob boss.  After much cajoling, Sean agrees to testify in court, and he is put under the protective custody of Neville Flynn, a cop with so much faith in practicality and reason that he comes across a little cold-blooded.  Good thing, because he's about to face an entire plane-load of equally cold-blooded enemies.  Snakes, people!  Snakes.Yes.  Mr. Leong, having discovered which plane will carry Jones to the trial, has it filled with exotic, poisonous and horny snakes.  (You would think, given his resources, that he would just put a timed explosive on the plane's engines, but then that would make for a short and mostly unsatisfying film.)  Midway through flight, the snakes slither out and cause general aggravation.  They damage the plane's electrical systems, interrupt young bathroom lovers in mid-coitus, and make life uncomfortable for stewardesses, captains, snooty doctors, and germaphobic rappers alike.That's it, folks.  The snakes do some hissing and biting, people do some screaming, panic ensues, and the plane tilts and sways.  Expect partial nudity, disgusting and cringe-worthy deaths, unlikely heroes, cowards (who get their comeuppance), and more than a few stupid jokes (the most successful of which are delivered by Kenan Thompson's Troy).

I'd seen the poster before, and thought it was really, really cool. Although I have to admit a preference to the Anacondas poster - the eyes freak me out everytime.Basically, the story is about a young boy/man (he looks really young when you originally see him), called Sean, played by Nathan Phillips - the rubbish spelling of Sean - who witnesses a murder. There was something I just couldn't put my finger on whenever he appeared on screen. He definitely reminded me of someone, but it wasn't until I discovered he was a character called John 'Teabag' Teasdale in Neighbours! I couldn't stop giggling. I don't remember the character, but I definitely remember the face. He has to get protected until he goes on the witness stand, and he gets protected by the wonderful Samuel L Jackson. To do this, they must take over the entire first class on a plane (there are upstairs and downstairs on a plane?!), annoying lots of people who have to then mix with the riff raff in business or whatever it's called.Some of the scenes in this are funny, particularly Rachel Blanchard (finally growing out of the teen movies) playing a Paris Hilton wannabee, complete with little yappy dog. Which takes a little bit too long for the rest of the passengers before it gets eaten. You have your rapper-of-the-moment, who's a hygiene freak, and his two bouncer guys, one of them HAS to be the guy from the Kenan & Kel show surely?!Some of the deaths are quite gorey, although nothing particularly new. I swear every guy crosses his legs when the snake comes out the toilet (450 snakes were used!) and I was so close to crossing my legs too. Then there's the couple joining the mile high club, I've never been so glad to see someone die in a movie, but these two deserved it, although the snake going straight for her nipple was enough for me to fold my arms! And then the boa constrictor (I think) nearly crushing the guy, and swallowing from the head downwards - well, UGH!!! But the rest of the deaths are nothing spectacular, and you'll be glad to see some of the passengers die.The snake vision that was used was pretty cool, and not something that's been pulled off as successful as that before. It added something more to the film, although it's a bit fuzzy and sometimes not that easy to make out what the snake is meant to be seeing.You do come out with a little buzz afterwards, as it's quite fast paced, and will keep you on the edge of your seat right til the end. It's quite a neat little film, I'll probably get it on DVD, and get even more freaked out by snakes.And I now have a little crush on Samuel L Jackson.

The film starts off really cheesy, but once they get on that plane, you won't be able to resist the venom this films packs. Samuel L. Jackson rocked the house with his great acting and line delivery (you know the one), and even the CGI snakes looked really good. I figured the most I would give this film would be 3 stars, but the movie won me over.

I don't know why this but it could refer to those people whose intimate areas (boob and crotch) get snake bitten in plane toilets. Very LOL.Claustrophobia - fear of confined spaces. Especially when your travel buddies are cobras, constrictors, coral snakes and rattlesnakes!Aviophobia - fear of flying. Up in the air you have no control.Ophidiophobia - fear of snakes. Man's first enemy since the Garden Of Eden.Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) has to escort star witness Sean Jones (Nathan Philips) from Honolulu to LA to testify in a murder trail. The defendant Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) somehow gets word of it and loads a truck load of slimy reptiles to kill everyone on board.You have the stock disaster movie characters - the woman with baby (you'll be hoping they'll be all right), the amorous couple, the grouch, the nervous wreck and kids travelling without parents. There's also an 2007 update - the rap star and his bodyguards.As the witness and the FBI agents take first class, the rest have to settle for coach. Soon, all hell breaks loose as the snakes join the party...You'll be grateful that some of the characters get killed - like the meanie who threw the pet chihuahua to the snakes and feeling wretched when the brave senior attendant Grace (Lin Shaye) saves the baby but gets fatally wounded.Outgoing flight attendant Claire (Julianna Marguiles) and her team have to navigate the mayhem and hysteria and eventually face the terrifying prospect of losing the captain and co-pilot as they succumb to deadly venom. There are many nail biting moments as well as blood and gore.  Eg Somebody's high heels went through a skull during a stampede, eeks.Extras galore.

However, the goal to make this like campy horror shifted into the territory of all out comedy.Watching it reminded me of watching the great comedy Airplane.  The stereotypical cast of characters showing up on an airplane: the star, the kids by themselves, the snob, and the lady with the crying baby.

However, it's a lot of fun if that's what you're looking for, and the snake attacks are actually a bit frightening.Firstly, this movie could never be done without Samuel L. Jackson. He makes it all the more humorous with his famous ending line that comes when he's making ready to shoot a hole in the plane's interior. ""I'm about to open up a window...I am sick and tired of these m************ snakes, on this m************ plane!""Then there are the other comical and unsuspecting passengers- -the rude british guy who pouts because he can't sit first class, the fat lady who continually asks the flight attendants for free snacks, and even the fake and unbelievably germophobic celebrity rapper named ""3Gs"" (P-Diddy Wannabe) whose hit single is titled, ""Booty Goes Thump!""This movie was a good time, and nothing more than that.

I saw it in a near empty theater( taking away the full crowd experience), but I still enjoyed this movie immensley. Now, to the plot...Samuel L. Jackson plays Neville Flynn, a special agent tasked with the mission of finding the eye-witness to a brutal murder by L.A. crime boss Eddie Kim, putting him on the soonest flight out of Hawaii,and escorting him to L.A.. Now, this would seem like an easy assignment, but Eddie Kim has already located the witness and plans to silence him by unleashing deadly snakes midflight. Flynn will stop at nothing to complete his assignment and takes the snakes down using an array of handy weapons such as a fire extinguisher, makeshift blowtorch, and tazer. If you are unsure about seeing this movie,just know it is one of the most fun and outrageous movies of the year. Oscar worthy?...the title already answers that. This movie is about Samuel Jackson kicking snake butt in a silver tube and that's what you get.

I became hooked to the plot almost immediatly, and was shocked by how menacing the snkaes looked. Also like with Daredevil, I got several emotions from this movie and was pleased by how fun it was viewing the film. The biggest surprise was how much the supporting characters were developed and vital to the plot. Sure many are sterotypes but it was nice viewing them and hopeing that certain ones would survive, one thing that makes a crisis movie good.There weren't many stupid deaths, and the ones that were stupid death's weren't annoying as I hated those characters. Also the way problems were resolved, felt believeable even though I'm sure most won't work in real life. And like with Volcano, the side plot of people not in danger was surprisingly vital and good to include.I really don't have any faults with this movie, minus the fact of the bad guy coming on the plane and putting himself in danger, I just couldn't understand that.

1025848,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000JBXHQY,RMurray847,"[5, 7]","If there hadn't been so much hype about this movie, chances are I would not have gone out of my way to see it on opening weekend.  But all the coverage made me think I was in for a ""Blair Witch"" type of pop-culture phenomenon...and I didn't want to miss out.  Well, I needn't have bothered.  I saw the film on Saturday of opening weekend in a theatre less than half full.  The crowd laughed at the right spots, but there was not the kind of wild excitement we were led to expect.  I guess I'm more gullible than most.The movie itself is fun in the kind of way that ANACONDA was fun, or DEEP BLUE SEA (more Samuel Jackson).  It's trashy, but it's glossy trash and it knows that it is trash.  No one believes they will win awards for the movie.  No one is thinking superstardom.  Mostly, I think, they folks in SNAKES ON A PLANE were thinking either a) Hey, it's a paycheck and/or b) it'll be fun.My biggest problem with the film is that it wasn't really terribly exciting.  The campy, over-the-top death scenes are what I expected.  The caricatures and the guessing game over who will live and who won't make it through the night are pretty much what anyone would expect.  But I also expected some genuine thrills...and I didn't get them.  I guess if you were honestly phobic about snakes (or maybe flying) you would get creeped out.  But otherwise, it's fairly uninspired action.  The best scenes actually come early on, when the snakes are dumped in large quantities onto an unsuspecting plane-load of passengers.  The mass hysteria, mass envenomation and mass death are fun for about five minutes.  No other scenes later in film come close the the pure visceral feel of that scene.The snakes themselves come in all varieties, and if you know anything about snakes (I know some...I've owned a few) you know that these pythons and boas would not act as they do.  You would know that a four year old child bitten by a cobra would not live five minutes, much less a few hours.  You'd know that most of the really colorful snakes are harmless milksnakes.  But that aside, most of the snakes are computer-generated, and not always very well.  They don't seem to really fit in against the background of the plane.  While I don't mind suspending disbelief, I couldn't suspend it enough to really imagine these folks were in great peril.Not surprisingly, the best thing about the film is Samuel Jackson.  He's doing his patented ""Shaft""-type character...but he's always a treat to watch.  He's one of the most natural screen presenses ever.  You can tell he honestly thinks it's a rare and wonderful treat to be able to be captured on film.  He gives it his all, and you just like the guy.  He's cool and he's funny, and no one blows a gasket like he does.So in my opinion, the film is worth seeing, but probably not at the theatre.  At this point, I think the best would be to see it on video in your darkened home, with lots of slightly tipsy friends around you.  Everyone would have fun, laugh and then instantly forget the film itself when they left the party.  But they'd remember their gathering fondly, if not the film.As for the R rating (which the film had to go back and add stuff to to earn...it was originally PG-13).  It still plays like a PG-13 movie 95% of the time.  There is one scene where a young couple joins the mile-high club in the airplane restroom...it is probably just a little more graphic than PG-13 would allow.  And Jackson (and some others) drop the ""F-bomb"" a few times...it adds nothing to the enjoyment of the movie.  We took our 14 year old (who normally doesn't get to see R rated films) and didn't really regret it.",3,Kinda fun...but not worth the hype either.,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,3645,"['had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'movie', 'chances', 'are', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'see', 'opening', 'weekend', 'coverage', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'type', 'pop-culture', 'phenomenon', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'out', 'Well', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'saw', 'film', 'Saturday', 'opening', 'weekend', 'theatre', 'less', 'half', 'full', 'crowd', 'laughed', 'right', 'spots', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'kind', 'wild', 'excitement', 'were', 'led', 'expect', 'guess', ""'m"", 'more', 'gullible', 'most.The', 'movie', 'fun', 'kind', 'way', 'ANACONDA', 'was', 'fun', 'DEEP', 'BLUE', 'SEA', 'more', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'trashy', 'glossy', 'trash', 'trash', 'one', 'will', 'win', 'awards', 'movie', 'one', 'thinking', 'superstardom', 'Mostly', 'think', 'folks', 'SNAKES', 'ON', 'A', 'PLANE', 'were', 'thinking', 'Hey', 'paycheck', 'and/or', 'b', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fun.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'campy', 'over-the-top', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'what', 'expected', 'caricatures', 'guessing', 'game', 'who', 'will', 'live', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'night', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'anyone', 'would', 'expect', 'also', 'expected', 'genuine', 'thrills', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'guess', 'were', 'honestly', 'phobic', 'snakes', 'maybe', 'flying', 'would', 'get', 'creeped', 'out', 'otherwise', 'fairly', 'uninspired', 'action', 'best', 'scenes', 'actually', 'come', 'early', 'when', 'snakes', 'are', 'dumped', 'large', 'quantities', 'unsuspecting', 'plane-load', 'passengers', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'mass', 'envenomation', 'mass', 'death', 'are', 'fun', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'other', 'scenes', 'later', 'film', 'come', 'close', 'pure', 'visceral', 'feel', 'scene.The', 'snakes', 'come', 'varieties', 'know', 'anything', 'snakes', 'know', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'few', 'know', 'pythons', 'boas', 'would', 'not', 'act', 'do', 'would', 'know', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'bitten', 'cobra', 'would', 'not', 'live', 'five', 'minutes', 'much', 'less', 'few', 'hours', ""'d"", 'know', 'most', 'really', 'colorful', 'snakes', 'are', 'harmless', 'milksnakes', 'aside', 'most', 'snakes', 'are', 'computer-generated', 'not', 'always', 'very', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'fit', 'background', 'plane', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'could', ""n't"", 'suspend', 'enough', 'really', 'imagine', 'folks', 'were', 'great', 'peril.Not', 'surprisingly', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'doing', 'patented', 'Shaft', '-type', 'character', 'always', 'treat', 'watch', 'one', 'most', 'natural', 'screen', 'presenses', 'ever', 'can', 'tell', 'honestly', 'rare', 'wonderful', 'treat', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'captured', 'film', 'just', 'guy', 'cool', 'funny', 'one', 'gasket', 'opinion', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'probably', 'not', 'theatre', 'point', 'think', 'best', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'video', 'darkened', 'home', 'lots', 'slightly', 'tipsy', 'friends', 'Everyone', 'would', 'have', 'fun', 'laugh', 'then', 'instantly', 'forget', 'film', 'when', 'left', 'party', ""'d"", 'remember', 'gathering', 'fondly', 'not', 'film.As', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'add', 'stuff', 'earn', 'was', 'originally', 'PG-13', 'still', 'PG-13', 'movie', '95', '%', 'time', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'couple', 'mile-high', 'club', 'airplane', 'restroom', 'probably', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'graphic', 'PG-13', 'would', 'allow', 'Jackson', 'others', 'drop', 'F-bomb', 'few', 'times', 'nothing', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'took', '14', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'normally', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'R', 'rated', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'regret']",N/A
1025849,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000JBXHQY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","Snakes on a Plane (David R. Ellis, 2006)I have spent the last eight months wondering whether Snakes on a Plane would be the best bad movie since Night of the Lepus. Well, it's finally out, and I got to see it. Finally. And now... I don't know. Don't get me wrong, as far as bad movies go, this one's a doozy. But, really, is the world even capable of producing another movie on a par with Night of the Lepus?In any case, I have also, as have all of us most likely, read scads of reviews of the movie. Most of them are of the ""it's so bad it's good"" variety. Some of them point out flaws that are certainly worthy. But there's a subset, and it's a rather large one, that seem to have missed one very, very big point-- this is a comedy. It was meant to be a comedy, though it was meant to play like a seventies disaster film. Intent is everything, and what the cast and crew did with this movie is nothing short of amazing, the film version of Julie Andrews' transformation in Victor/Victoria-- it's an intentionally hilarious rendition of a supposedly serious, but unintentionally hilarious, movie. The only word to describe such a thing is ""brilliant,"" really.In case you've been in a cave for the past year, the plot: Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips [Wolf Creek]) is a witness to the Hawaii murder of an LA County prosecutor. The killer, Triad-connected Eddie Kim (Romeo Must Die's Byron Lawson), finds out Sean was watching and sends some goons to kill him. He's rescued in the nick of time by FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. ""I am tired of these motherlovin' snakes on this motherlovin' plane!"" Jackson), who spirits him off to LA to testify against Kim. Kim, however, has a devious plan to get rid of Sean. I'm pretty sure you can tell by the movie's title what that plan is.The movie's biggest problem is that someone with a heavy, heavy hand was in the editing room on this one, and (at least, judging by the first draft, from which Christa Faust wrote the surprisingly good novelization) huge amounts of character and plot development were left on the cutting room floor to make space for the gore that got this film its hard-R rating. (Given the film's rather skimpy running time, I don't see why they couldn't have left in the scenes that told you that, for example, the cat in the hold belongs to the two little boys traveling alone, or given us the Chihuahua-rescue stuff that transforms Mercedes from an annoying whiner into a sympathetic character.) I grant you that continuity might have taken this film too close to the line of watchability, but still, a lot of the negative comments about it have, rightly, been about the godawful plot holes springing leaks all over the place. Characters get a bit of buildup only to be ignored from the rest of the film; the worst example of this is the short shrift given to the astonishingly beautiful Agam Darshi, who pops up for a few seconds of screen time now and again in the first half of the movie, then entirely disappears.On the other side of the balance is the fact that this movie has everything else an unintentionally hilarious disaster film needs, and plays it up without overplaying its hand. The infamous ""it's the snakes!"" line is the kind of thing Hollywood legend is made of. Sam Jackson does his thing, and does it well; everyone else was probably told ""you're going to be in a bad movie. Act like it."" There's a great deal of screaming, some completely gratuitous sex, a lot of snakes, one-liners flying around all over the place... what more could you possibly need?Time will tell if this will go down in history as one of the great bad movies. But it's the best one we've seen in a very long time.

Do I hope to come away with a better understanding of snakes, their biology and a realistic portrayal of how snakes react on a plane?Or did you come to see Samuel L. Jackson fight off enraged serpents and watch people get attacked by crazed reptiles while hurtling above the earth in a run away jet liner?Surprise!  The movie is completely ridiculous.  And you know what?  It's tons of fun.  This movie is a throw back to those stupidly fun 70's disaster movies.  You get little snippets of character before a horrible disaster breaks loose and someone has to step up and save the day.  You can't go wrong when your hero is Samuel Jackson.  Jackson employs his own kind of cool and takes on the scaly scourge with relish.  The rest of the cast does a great job as the victims to the completely absurd revenge plot.Yes the script is ridiculous.  The concept is ridiculous, what do you expect?  One of my favorite lines is when the villainous mastermind behind putting snakes on a plane to kill the witness is... ""I've exhausted all other options.""  Wow, I'd love to see what those other options were, because they had to be just as good as this movie.Seriously, the special effects are cheesy fun.  The dialogue is goofy.  The acting is solid, but over the top, and every one involved seems to know exactly what type of movie they are making.  It's not deep.  It's all for fun, and the glory of seeing Samuel L. Jackson apply a homemade blowtorch to fake looking snakes.  If that sounds like your idea of an entertaining and fun movie, then give this disc a spin.  You'll have a great time.  I did.*** A Note ***If you manage to see this on DVD, check out the gag reel.  It's actually pretty funny.",4,You got your comedy in my action!

These include not only indie films, but more mainstream fare that is dealt a less than adequate theatrical shelf life.  With Rudy's Rewind, I aim to recall and review some such films that are now available at rental and retail outlets. Not all are praiseworthy, but each deserves an extra slice of spotlight.""Snakes on a Plane"" is one of those flicks that strides the line of these guidelines. Despite opening at #1 and a vast whirlwind of media frenzy and public interest that preceded it, it was considered a commercial disappointment. It is nevertheless sure to continue galvanizing its place in the post-millennium cult cinema echelon.As unsophisticated as a Danielle Steel novel, it pays unadulterated tribute to the cheesy action/horror flicks of yesteryear like ""Airport"" and ""The Towering Inferno."" Containing similar elements (off-kilter premise, large cast, trumped-up special effects, unaffected writing), it exemplifies the genre for this generation.When Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) becomes the sole witness to a grizzly execution, crime lord Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) has one prerogative: kill him too. FBI Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) takes Jones into protective custody, and plans are made for a flight to Los Angeles where he can testify. This prompts Kim's cohorts to smuggle time-released boxes of venomous snakes into the plane's cargo. Masses of Hawaiian leis that provoke their violent nature are handed out to the passengers.Far-fetched plotline and so-so acting aside, the frightful flight takes off without a hitch. The only other character to get fully established is Claire Miller, played by a post-ER Julianna Margulies. This is a relief, since she and Jackson provide the film's backbone with thoroughly engaging performances.All hell breaks loose when the lead pilot predictably becomes an initial victim. The mass chaos is enough that those with intense fear of snakes or flying (ophidiophobia and aviophobia respectively) should steer clear of the film. Those who don't, however, are sure to be terrified, tickled or something in-between. While the context they provide is distressful to say the least, the snakes are so obviously computerized that it is sure to illicit laughter from some.When the gruesome events subside and the survivors land safely, the fact that they seem to recover instantly from the terror that befell them - and killed several less lucky comrades - underscores the fact that ""Snakes on a Plane"" is not to be taken seriously, but instead enjoyed for what it is: a fast-paced, action-packed horror flick that tips the hat to like-minded fare that inspired it.",4,Hokey 'Snakes' to Slither Into Your DVD Player...,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,2747,"['great', 'deal', 'motion', 'pictures', 'are', ""n't"", 'prime', 'box', 'office', 'performers', 'are', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'great', 'entertainment', 'include', 'not', 'only', 'indie', 'films', 'more', 'mainstream', 'fare', 'dealt', 'less', 'adequate', 'theatrical', 'shelf', 'life', 'Rudy', 'Rewind', 'aim', 'recall', 'review', 'such', 'films', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'rental', 'retail', 'outlets', 'Not', 'are', 'praiseworthy', 'extra', 'slice', 'spotlight', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'one', 'flicks', 'line', 'guidelines', 'opening', '1', 'vast', 'whirlwind', 'media', 'frenzy', 'public', 'interest', 'preceded', 'was', 'considered', 'commercial', 'disappointment', 'nevertheless', 'sure', 'continue', 'galvanizing', 'place', 'post-millennium', 'cult', 'cinema', 'echelon.As', 'unsophisticated', 'Danielle', 'Steel', 'novel', 'unadulterated', 'tribute', 'cheesy', 'action/horror', 'flicks', 'yesteryear', 'Airport', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'Containing', 'similar', 'elements', 'off-kilter', 'premise', 'large', 'cast', 'trumped-up', 'special', 'effects', 'unaffected', 'writing', 'genre', 'generation.When', 'Sean', 'Jones', 'Nathan', 'Phillips', 'sole', 'witness', 'grizzly', 'execution', 'crime', 'lord', 'Eddie', 'Kim', 'Byron', 'Lawson', 'one', 'prerogative', 'kill', 'too', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Neville', 'Flynn', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Jones', 'protective', 'custody', 'plans', 'are', 'made', 'flight', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'can', 'testify', 'Kim', 'cohorts', 'smuggle', 'time-released', 'boxes', 'venomous', 'snakes', 'plane', 'cargo', 'Masses', 'Hawaiian', 'leis', 'provoke', 'violent', 'nature', 'are', 'handed', 'out', 'passengers.Far-fetched', 'plotline', 'so-so', 'acting', 'aside', 'frightful', 'flight', 'hitch', 'only', 'other', 'character', 'get', 'fully', 'established', 'Claire', 'Miller', 'played', 'post-ER', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'relief', 'Jackson', 'provide', 'film', 'backbone', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'performances.All', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'when', 'lead', 'pilot', 'predictably', 'initial', 'victim', 'mass', 'chaos', 'enough', 'intense', 'fear', 'snakes', 'flying', 'ophidiophobia', 'aviophobia', 'respectively', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'film', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'however', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'terrified', 'tickled', 'something', 'in-between', 'context', 'provide', 'distressful', 'say', 'least', 'snakes', 'are', 'so', 'obviously', 'computerized', 'sure', 'illicit', 'laughter', 'some.When', 'gruesome', 'events', 'subside', 'survivors', 'land', 'safely', 'fact', 'seem', 'recover', 'instantly', 'terror', 'befell', 'killed', 'several', 'less', 'lucky', 'comrades', 'fact', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'instead', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'fast-paced', 'action-packed', 'horror', 'flick', 'hat', 'like-minded', 'fare', 'inspired']",N/A

Can you do that without laughing? I know I can't.What started out as an EXPLOSIVE internet phenomenon in spring 2006 became a legend by August. And unless you've been living under a rock for the last year and a half, you'll definitely know something about Snakes On A Plane. When the story surfaced, I thought it was such a genius idea for a brainless summer popcorn movie, became a regular on the IMDb board for a bit, got an official T-Shirt at Hot Topic, and, unfortunately, didn't get a chance to see it when it opened on August 18th. Well, last night I sat down with a friend at 1:30 in the morning with a can of Rockstar, popcorn, and french fries and put the movie on, truly, completely not knowing of what was about to be thrown in my face.As you can probably imagine, Snakes on a Plane is about...well...snakes on a plane. A teenager witnesses a brutal murder in Honolulu, doesn't do anything, and Samuel L. Jackson as a super-cool FBI agent must escort him to LA to testify. But the murderer wants this witness dead--so he releases deadly snakes on the plane to make sure he dies.The film is basically made up of people getting killed in the most random and outrageous ways imaginable by this ASTOUNDINGLY unrealistic movie, and Samuel L. Jackson killing the snakes and trying to protect the passengers. Hilarity ensues--I laughed throughout the whole movie. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous, badly written, super-corny, yet excruciatingly funny. Kenan Thompson portrays a video-game addict passenger who attempts to fly the plane and the whole thing is just really, really funny.Aside from that, being honest--S.O.A.P is without a doubt the WORST movie I have ever seen. Ever. It has no story, it's extremely corny (even the scenes without the snakes), makes you want to kill yourself, it's terribly acted, and everything else bad you can think of. Yet, there's a little voice inside you protesting, insisting you watch the rest of Samuel L. Jackson beating the crap out of poisonous snakes. While it is the worst movie I've ever seen--I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. I know this is an over-used, worn-out expression, but this is really the only film I've ever seen where it 100% applies--Snakes on a Plane is SO bad, it's good. It makes for a fantastic laugh and it's a healthier alternative to drugs to forget all your problems and worries and just enjoy a night of watching snakes kill people on a plane. Overall, the ULTIMATE summer party movie. It's original as hell, side-splittingly funny, and 100% awesome--yet it's also the worst film ever produced.The only problem is, I have no idea whether I give this movie 5 stars or 0 stars. So I've decided on half and half--a 2 1/2.Just see this movie. SOAP will undoubtedly go down in history as a cult classic.",2,The worst movie I've ever seen.

1025873,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B000JBXHQY,the masked reviewer,"[3, 4]","A delirious blend of Nature Runs Amok and In-Flight Terror subgenres, Snakes on a Plane plucks the cheesiest elements of both and tosses in a bit of TV Cop Show witness protection intrigue for good measure.Beginning and ending with beach montages, motorcrosser Nathan Phillips witnesses a bloody mob hit in Hawaii and is immediately almost taken out by members of the Eddie Kim gang. Luckily, Agent Samuel L. Jackson whisks him away to the safety of police custody in a hilariously hambone hotel-room shootout. From here we move to the airport - where you'll be thrilled to be out of the leafy wilds of Hawaii and into the sterile, claustrophobia-inducing halls and compartments of  the travel industry.Right off the bat, we're introduced to our flight crew, which features a few working girls, a sexually aggressive co-pilot, and even a token ""Air- Mary"". In the tradition of clich&eacute;d cop movies, Juliana Margulies is on her ""last day on the job"" and just wants it to be an easy one; however, somewhat NOT in the tradition of clich&eacute;d cop movies, she's not a cop - she's a stewardess. And we also learn that the chief baddie has decided to fill the plane with snakes, disguised as Hawaiian lais (don't ask), in order to kill off Phillips. (Already we're delighted at how the conventions of our various thriller subgenres are being appropriated, customized, retro-fitted, and inflated to bursting.)Next we meet the passengers, who range from generic stereotypes (the fat woman in the muumuu; the kids flying alone for the first time) to outright celebrity parody (Rachel Blanchard as a blonde bimbo with a tiny purse-dog name Mary-Kate, who throws herself at Flex Alexander's germophobe rap star). This is all well and good because we just know that these idiots are going to be snake-bait in mere moments.And once the snakes arrive, S.O.A.P kicks into high-gear. The fanged stowaways start attacking and they pretty much don't stop for the duration, giving us dozens of hilarious attacks and a hefty body count. The clich&eacute;s also arrive in ferocious number - (The noble stewardess ventures back into the snake-ridden coach cabin to save the missing baby; the inevitable ""is there anyone on board who can fly a plane?""), But the writers of S.O.A.P do serve up one small surprise by the end.Yes, the gay steward who spends the movie clapping and looking wide-eyed and offering to suck the venom out of fat men's behinds ends up being a total hetero, which is kind of a dated joke and a bit of a screw-you to anyone who actually enjoyed the fact that a gay character was somewhat heroic, helpful, sensitive, and alive by the last reel. (And just why are the other stewardesses shocked that he's hugging his girlfriend at the end? Have they never had a conversation with this man during their 5-hour flights?)

As soon as I heard about this film, I knew not to expect anything good to come from it, but I was willing to give a chance and at least watch it once. I think it was good thing to have my expectations set low for this film, because it ended up being much better than I ever thought it would be. I'm not saying this film is great, but its good for what it is. An over-the-top action/horror/disaster movie that isn't meant to do or say a lot, except to entertain you. If you try to take this film too serious, then you're in trouble. The plot, though not as dumb as I expected, is pretty lame. The acting is, well..not good..but again, you can't expect much here. However, I still can't really tell if the makers of the film were really trying for something serious here. In some scenes, especially the beginning, it does seem they are setting the audience up for a serious film, but as the story and the acting gets increasing worse, it seems that the makers just gave up and decided to let go and just make a fun little movie about snakes. And speaking of snakes, its hardly worth mentioning, since its just one of the many flaws of this film, but the C.G. snakes look exactly like..well C.G. snakes!! You can definitely tell a difference when a real snake is shown. Nevertheless, this DVD is filled with a lot of special features, most of which I'm not brought myself to watch yet. It includes commentary by the director and Samuel L. Jackson, 4 featurettes including ""Pure Vemon: The Making of), 10 deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and a music video and more. No, this is not a must have movie by any means, and no, I'm not really suggesting anyone to go buy it. You must have an acquired taste to get a kick out movies like these.

""Snakes"" is The Summer Movie of the summer, a fun ride, filled with thrills, scares, laughs, fun dialogue and good action.Samuel L. Jackson reportedly jumped at the chance to headline this film and I have no doubt this will pay off for him. There is enormous internet buzz about the project and the screening I attended was populated with people with their faces painted like snakes and wearing homemade t-shirts. This film has got to make a boatload of money. Right?Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips), a twenty something out enjoying the Hawaiian countryside on his dirt bike, when he comes across a bloodied man hanging upside down from a bridge. The man tells him to hide. Soon, Eddie Kim (Bryon Lawson), a gangster, shows up and murders the man but spots Sean as he speeds away. Hiding in his apartment, Sean hears someone jiggling the front door and rushes towards the balcony, trying to escape, when he finds FBI Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) who has arrived just in time to save his life. Flynn convinces Sean to fly back to Los Angeles and testify against the gangster, but Eddie Kim isn't about to let anyone testify against him, so he has some of his men on the lookout. Using a private plane as a decoy, Flynn, his partner and Sean take over the First Class cabin of Pacific Air flight 121, making Flight Attendant Claire Miller's (Julianna Marguilies) last flight hell. She has been accepted to law school and looks forward to never having to say ""I'm sorry, you can't sit in first class, but there is plenty of room in coach"". Shortly after taking off, the snakes get loose and there are a lot of motherf***ing snakes on the motherf***ing plane. As they slither around, all hell breaks loose.Whether they will admit it or not, studios salivate at the prospect of a `high concept' film, the projects they spend the most money on, devote the most advertising dollars to and book into the largest number of theaters. These projects usually begin with a pitch involving writers comparing too popular films. ""It's Freddy Vs. Jason."" ""It's a female Indiana Jones."" ""It's teenagers Vs. Death"". These simple ideas translate well into advertising and are more likely to capture the attention of a lot more people. I can't even imagine the reaction when the writers walked into the New Line offices and said ""its snakes on a plane."" That's all you need to know. But what sets some of these high concept films apart, makes them more memorable than others, is the window dressing.And Samuel L. Jackson is a good start for some interesting window dressing. Showing up moments before Sean would surely be killed; Flynn saves the young man's life and then manages to deal with just about every obstacle thrown in his way. Throughout, he exhibits the FBI Agent's toughness, never letting anything under his skin. The writers have come up with some memorable lines for Flynn, but Jackson makes them work, delivering them with his trademark deadpan cadence. The most memorable line was reportedly inspired by an internet parody of the film and added during reshoots. There is never any doubt who is in charge and this character will remain a memorable figure in cinema for some time.Director David R. Ellis has a lot of fun with the film, taking us on the celluloid equivalent of a roller coaster ride. He realizes the core audience will most likely have a short attention span, they want to see some snakes on a plane. But he has to get things going, introducing us to the characters and setting the story in motion. As he diverts our attention, to the details of some of the characters, he also cuts back to the hold of the plane, and shots of a timer, as it ticks down. We can put two and two together and figure out when the timer reaches 0:00, the snakes will get out.After the snakes are released, they slowly work their way through the cargo and this causes a lot of havoc with the electrical equipment. The Captain goes down to investigate, meeting one of the snakes. Yet, because this is an isolated event, no one else is aware of the problem yet. Then a couple of passengers, who are isolated from the rest of the plane, meet the deadly beasts. All of this amps us up for the main action, when the snakes enter the main passenger cabin. This reveal is unique, interesting and funny.When the rest of the passengers realize there are snakes on the plane, the roller coaster car begins speeding down the track, providing a lot of thrills and chills.Some of these attacks are amusing, some frightening, some just plane gross. Most of them elicit the response they do because we can identify. If a snake bit me there, it would be very painful.""Snakes on a Plane"" is a thrill ride of a movie. The entertainment value of the film is through the roof.That said, ""Snakes"" is not a great film. It could've been so much better, and so much more memorable, if a little more detail were paid to the window dressing. Beyond the core group of leads, we learn very little about most of the characters. This is the type of film where everyone is established with the quickest, broadest strokes, merely enforcing the comic book nature of the story. Also, because of this, it becomes extremely easy to pick out who will be killed by the snakes. Let's do a test. I will describe some of the passengers on Flight 121 and you decide which ones are killed during the course of the film; two young boys traveling unaccompanied to visit their mom in Los Angeles, afraid of taking the flight until their father charges the older boy with the care of the younger boy, the co-pilot who, wearing snakeskin boots, hits on every female crew member, an obnoxious British man who isn't happy about having to sit in coach with the `filthy Americans', a couple traveling home from their honeymoon and the husband has a fear of flying, a new mother carrying her baby in a papoose. I'll bet you got it right.Even though his presence is felt in every scene, the villain doesn't make a reappearance after his first two, brief scenes. Yes, we know he is responsible for the snakes on a plane, and he clearly gets away (how else would they make a sequel), but we never see him again. As the credits roll, picture begins again and it would make sense to see a brief explanation of how he escaped. No, instead we get a music video.If you are even remotely familiar with the premise of ""Final Destination"", it should come as no surprise that Director Ellis, who helmed ""Destination 2"", goes to great pains to come up with some elaborate snake attacks. After they attack this body part, and that body part, the attacks start to take a turn and become gory and gross for the sake of being gory and gross, deadening their impact.These quibbles aside, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is a great ride and a lot of fun. You will be hard pressed to find a better thrill ride at the movies this summer.",4,The Roller Coaster Ride of the Summer,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,6992,"['****1/2', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'should',

They say and do the same things that most of us would do in that situation. They fully understand, that even thou it isn't a comedy, they are in a completely ridiculous film, not meant to be taken seriously by anyone. Samuel L. Jackson is fearless, hysterical, and terrific as FBI Agent Neville Flynn. The supporting cast, of mostly newcomers, is also great, playing off the example set by Jackson and Margulies. Lets also not forget that while many of the attack scenarios were computerized, there were still a few dozen de-fanged venomous snakes with them at all times!

1025880,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000JBXHQY,Tom Benton,"[3, 3]","If you weren't thankful for the Internet prior to seeing SNAKES ON A PLANE, you will be after watching one of the year's most anticipated films.  The film's tentative title won over many a fan online during filming; when it was retitled FLIGHT 121, a fan outcry (and constant nagging from star Samuel L. Jackson) made sure that the tentative title stuck.  The surprise online interest in the film convinced New Line Entertainment to do something odd, and in my eyes, quite commendable - six months after principal filming had wrapped, New Line ordered the cast and crew to do numerous re-shoots to make the film a little more hokey and to give it an R-rating.  In doing so, they created an instant cult classic and one of the year's best - and certainly most entertaining - movies.The paperthin plot involves a young surfer (Nathan Phillips) who witnesses a murder at the hands of Asian crime lord Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson).  FBI agent Nelville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) convinces him to testify against the crime lord, and puts him under protective custody, arranging to transport him to Los Angeles from Hawaii via airplane.  However, they - along with the many other passengers of Pacific Air Flight 121 - are in for a surprise: Eddie Kim has placed an enormous crate full of numerous species of poisonous snakes on the plane.  When the timer goes off - the crate'll open and the snakes will be let loose.The best part of SNAKES ON A PLANE is that it realizes it's a hokey B-movie thriller, and it has fun being a hokey B-movie thriller.  Honestly, this is one of the most fun and entertaining movies I've ever seen.  For some reason, seeing people being attacked by snakes is extremely funny - and believe me, these snakes do attack people.  They strike at just about every point of the body you can think of (I mean that!).  Of course, the audience - and the passengers - are wondering, ""Just how do you ward off hundreds of venomous snakes on board an airplane thirty-thousand feet above the ground?""The answer?  Samuel L. Jackson.Why are most people going to see this movie?  Samuel L. Jackson.  The man is awesome, and he is perfect for this film.  Of course, the film's most popular form of advertising has been clips of Jackson shouting the film's already classic line quoted in my title.  Actually, the only thing about the film that disappointed me was the lack of cursing from Jackson.  It would've made the film even more hokey, if you can believe that such a thing is possible, to have a nice little string of curses from Jackson, a la PULP FICTION.  Nobody swears like Samuel L. Jackson.That aside, the film was wonderful.  It greatly surpassed by expectations.  It was even, at times, surprisingly inventive.  For example, there are numerous fuzzy, green point-of-view shots from the snakes.  The snakes keep coming from every angle, biting every body part, until the delightfully silly ending.

I'll admit, I laughed after seeing the promo poster for this film.  I laughed for days.  What a stupid, stupid idea; what a stupid poster; who would fund such an obvious piece of drek?  But for all the ridicule and scorn I heaped onto it, I also knew that I must see this film; and my only regret is having missed it in the theaters.  This film is a riot.  It is fully aware of it's own inherent ridiculousness and throws in self-referential quotes and obnoxious one-liners at you as fast as it can when it's not filling the screen with  hyper-aggressive snakes or showing victims from the snakes' point-of-view via super cheesy ""snake vision"".  And what can be said about Samuel L Jackson that we don't already know?  The man can truly do no wrong.  Now, onto the contents of the film.  Why should you see this silly horror flick?  Well, there's snake-kabobs, scorched snake, zapped snake, snake on a cat, a dog named after an Olsen twin used as snake bait, a rattlesnake squaring off against a baby with a rattle, microwaved snake, snake vs. snake, snake up a dress, snake in the food, snake on a booty, snake on a booby, snakes on a wienie, snakes in the oxygen compartments, snakes out a window, snake in the light-fixture, a snake scarf, snakes on faces, snake in a mouth, snakes vs. a liferaft, snakes bashing through barriers on a foodcart, a snake swallowing a man's whole head, snakes in overhead storage, snakes vs. a kickboxer, bashed snake, a snake on a someones' freakin' eye, snake vs. stewardess with an axe, snake vs. gay stereotype, snakes in the cockpit, and a high heel in a dude's ear.  Sure, that last one had nothing to do with snakes or a plane, but it ruled.  All of this insane awesomeness is, of course, tempered with countless shots of the plane (you know, the one with all the snakes) flying through stormy weather.  You may think that I've given the whole movie away, but there's more!  Can you guess what plot twist leads Mr. Jackson himself to give ""all praises"" to the almighty Playstation?  I didn't think so, smartie.  And at what point during the film does a character feel the need to drop a quote from a horrifyingly bad Gwen Stefani song?  Is there any love to be found on this mother-effin' plane with all of these mother-effin' snakes on it?  Watch this movie with the largest posse of homies, peeps, and boos you can find and just have a great time, because that's how a movie like this is meant to be seen and enjoyed.  And brace yourself for the inevitable sequel.

It features Samuel J. Jackson quipping with his usual bravura acting: ""I have had it with these mother--ing snakes on this mother--ing plane!"" I really loved it, and enjoyed every word he says. He is nearly as cool as angry Jules quoting a passage from the Bible in `Pulp Fiction.'Actually I also immensely enjoyed myself watching his character and the film itself precisely because of its unrealistic, absurd, and silly story. A gangster tries to kill a witness (Nathan Phillips) who is protected and escorted by an FBI agent (Samuel J Jackson, of course), and this bad guy thinks of an ingenious idea. Don't talk about a banal plan, like hiring a hitman, bribing the cops, or anything you have seen in the Hollywood films. No, `Snakes on a Plane' proposes a much greater plan -- How about snakes on a plane that carries the witness to LA? Lots of snakes with poison let loose on the airplane should do the job, attacking everyone on board.Do they? Yes. Sit back, watch this wildly entertaining film, and just enjoy yourself. You don' t need to know much else about the film except that David R. Ellis, known for his competent works such as `Final Destination 2' and `Cellular,' did a brilliant job again. He knows what we want in this kind of summer-season fun film, and delivers it. Co-stars include Julianna Margulies, Rachel Blanchard, Sunny Mabrey, Flex Alexander, Kenan Thompson, Keith Dallas, and Lin Shaye.Though the concluding chapter is slightly weak, `Snakes on a Plane' is well-acted, the special effects are decent, and definitely fun. But the real stars are these big, bad snakes, and yes, Samuel L. Jackson. The film also gives you a tip or two about deadly snakes, and flying a jet.

This was back when you could go to a movie theatre, pay for a ticket and watch both movies, a cartoon, a newsreel, and maybe one or two shorts.  That doesn't happen nowadays. Instead, now when you pay for a movie you end up with one movie preceded by ten minutes of commercials and five to ten minutes of trailers.  That's it.  It's such a shame that things don't happen the way they used to.  In the way movies are shown and marketed now, we end up with a heck of a lot of crappy films that are really ""B"" pictures pretending to be ""A"" pictures and what we end up with is a lot of movies that are just plain garbage.Fortunately, there are a handful of ""B"" movies still being made that don't attempt to pretend to be anything than what they are.  Reminiscent of 1970s disaster films such as AIRPORT, SNAKES ON A PLANE is such a movie.  Except for ""A""-list star Samuel L. Jackson, the movie is straight out of ""B""-picture-land.  Jackson stars in this movie revolving around a surfer in Hawaii, Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) who sees a crime overlord viciously beating a district attorney to death with a baseball bat.  He gets away, but the kingpin finds out where he lives. Fortunately, so does Neville Flynn (Jackson).  Flynn gets Jones onboard a plane leaving for L.A. so he can testify against the kingpin.  Everything seems to be going as plan, the police and authorities even falling for a decoy plane that is staged.  However, the thugs find out and plant a container full of non-native snakes aboard the plane.  When the plane reaches a certain height, a timer is set to go off that will eventually release the snakes.  Normally, the snakes wouldn't do a thing, but the leis that everyone has been given have been sprayed with a chemical to make the snakes go insane.  What follows is about an hour of mishap as the plane's passengers and crew fight to stay alive until they can get to L.A.SNAKES ON A PLANE will forever be remembered as a movie that the Internet helped make.  After filming had wrapped, other scenes were added to move the movie from being a PG-13-rated to an R-rated film.  Just about all of these scenes can be picked out, not only because they are the scenes where there is excessive bleeding or nudity, but because the film quality is of a different type than the rest of the movie.  Personally, I think the movie would have been more entertaining without the extra scenes added and with a PG-13-rating the movie would have been available to a larger audience.The movie is what it is.  It doesn't pretend to be something that it isn't.  The script isn't that great and much of the scenario is so far-fetched that even someone living in the Emerald City of Oz would have a hard time believing it.  For example, anyone who knows anything about snakes could point out that the constrictor snake seen in the film is not anywhere near big enough to attempt to eat a person or that many of the corn and bull snakes seen in the film are completely harmless, docile, and non-venomous.  Nevertheless, the movie doesn't pretend to follow the rules of logic and turns out to be quite entertaining.

In fact, I'm terrified of these slithering creatures.  I've had a couple of horrifying experiences in my past with snakes, one of them with a large rattlesnake that was in hiding in my mom's house near the edge of the woods.  Snakes are certainly something that I try to avoid in my present life.  Because of that, I'd normally not even think about seeing a movie with the title, Snakes on a Plane.  Also, it would be natural to assume that a film with this kind of name would be a cheesy, second-rate production that you'd kick yourself for watching after it was over.  What drew me to this DVD, however, was a short interview I read with Samuel L. Jackson about how surprised he was at the quality of the script, which is what made him decide to do the movie.  I began to think that maybe this film was a lot better than I'd originally thought and decided to take a chance on it.  Now, after having watched it, I can say that not only did I jump out of my seat about two-dozen times, but that I also screamed out loud in pure fright more than once.  Would I watch this movie again?  Damn right I would!  In fact, I'm going to watch it with the director's commentary just as soon as I finish this review.The movie centers on Sean Jones (played by Nathan Jones) seeing the murder of an L.A. prosecutor by gang lord, Eddie Kim.  The prosecutor is in Hawaii on vacation, but that doesn't stop Kim from flying there and killing the man with a baseball bat.  After Sean witnesses the murder, he takes off on his motorcycle as fast as he can and hides from everyone.  Kim, however, knows that he was seen by someone and orders his men to find the guy and kill him.  FBI agent, Neville Flynn (played to perfection by Samuel L. Jackson) rescues Sean just as the killers are breaking into his apartment.  Flynn quickly explains to Sean that the only way to stay alive is to fly to Los Angeles and testify against Eddie Kim.  Kim, not seeing any way to get to Sean on the ground, arranges for a special crate of venomous snakes to be placed on board the plane that Flynn and Sean will be flying on.  A timer will explode on the crate, opening it so that the hundreds of snakes will be set free to explore the many areas of the Jumbo Jet.  The idea is not so much that a snake will bite Sean, but rather that the snakes will cause the plane to crash into the ocean.  There is the usual array of eye-catching characters making up the plane's crew and passengers, played by Julianna Margulies, Rachel Blanchard (I thought she was actually Heather Graham), Sunny Mabrey, Flex Alexander, and a score of others.  Of course, once the snakes get lose, all hell breaks out on the plane as more than two-thirds of the passengers are killed.  Then, when you begin to catch your breath and think that it can't get any worse, the pilots of the plane are killed, too.  Will the plane make it to Los Angeles?  Who'll land the plane?  How many passengers will be left alive if and when the plane does land?  ""Snakes.  I hate snakes!""This is NOT the type of movie that you want to see on an airplane.  I guarantee that the passengers wouldn't find it entertaining and that it might cause a few heart attacks in the process.  I was so exhausted emotionally after watching the movie that I could barely stand up and run to the bathroom.  I'd been gritting my teeth for over twenty minutes, not wanting to stop the film and risk ruining the mood and momentum.  Though there were some laughs in the movie, this is definitely played straight and serious.  And yes, there were real snakes used in the filming of the movie.  It wasn't all special effects.  Samuel Jackson gets to utter his famous line near the end when he says, ""I'm tired of these mother******* snakes on this mother******* plane,"" and then he does his stuff.  There are a couple of holes in the plot.  The first is how both Kim and the FBI discovered who Sean Jones is so quickly.  The members of Kim's gang only see Sean's back when he's riding away on his motorcycle.  They don't even know what he looks like.  Also, Sean heads straight home and hides.  He doesn't tell anybody about what he saw.  Yet, he's found out by both sides of the law on what seems to be the same day of the killing.  Second, how is Kim able to arrange for hundreds of venomous snakes from around the world to be collected together and flow to Hawaii in time to be put on the same plane as Flynn and Sean are flying on.  You get to see the snake wrangler who lives in the Mohave Desert, but still isn't explained how everything was done so swiftly.  Yeah, I know.  Movie magic!  Also, you never see Kim being arrested at the end.  To me, it seemed as if Samuel L. Jackson's character should've hunted Kim down and personally killed him after all of the deaths that occurred on the airplane.  Still, these things didn't take away from the movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The director, David Ellis, did a fantastic job of keeping the pace fast and right in your face.  This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend.  The only question is who'll be screaming the loudest?  There's over an hour of extras on the DVD, including four documentaries, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and the director's commentary on the film.  Here's a final word of advice to potential viewers of Snakes on a Plane.  Make sure that you don't have a bowl of popcorn in your lap when you watch this film, or else it might end up all over the living room floor.",5,"Now, I hate flying as much as I do

Nothing amazing really, but also nothing like the planewreck one might imagine.On all accounts Snakes On A Plane delivers the goods. There's action, suspense, humor, and above all, lots of motha-f%$@ing snakes. Samuel L. Jackson's FBI agent is cool and hardcore, striving to maintain his unruffled demeanor even with a plane full of snakes hopped up on aggression-inducing pheromones.The added sex scene (featuring Taylor Kitsch, now famous for Friday Night Lights on NBC) is great R-rated fun (added in later in an attempt to give the blogging hype-makers what they were expecting). The CGI snakes look a little fake at times, but when there's hundreds of them, they can't all be perfect. What's most surprising is that nothing in this film is tongue-in-cheek. It's pretty much a straight forward action flick that got a lot of hype for the title. I'm not sure whether the hype ended up hurting or helping the film overall. It helps you look past the plot holes that most major action movies have. For example, if the ""bad guys"" are willing to kill everyone on the flight to make sure that one guy dies, and they can sneak a crate of snakes onto the plane, why not just sneak a bomb on there? Answer: then Samuel L. Jackson would never get to say: ""I've had it with these motha-f%$@ing snakes on this motha-f$%@ing plane!"" And believe me, that line is worth the entire film. It's beautiful.The DVD itself is a masterpiece as well. There's a blooper reel, deleted scenes, a music video (& making of), and several featurettes on the making of the film itself. One about the snake handler and the snakes, one about the CGI, one about the blogging craze, and one generally about the whole concept and creation of Snakes On A Plane. It's all great material.In the end, this is a film that should leave audiences feeling entirely satisfied. When you go to see a film called Snakes On A Plane, you should know what you're getting into. Now we just have to wait for the sequel: Snakes On ANOTHER Plane.
