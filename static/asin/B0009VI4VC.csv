Itis a  very relaxing atmosphere, (yes, Geri always has something to add), but who doesn't know someone like that?  It's always very positive and what people are thinking anyway, but just don't have that sweet blunt way that she does.  I guess if you're looking for a very serious workout, that's different, but I felt that I was in a room working out with a bunch of friends.  Kasy Appleton always seems so concerned that noone does more than they should for their body, and keeps mentioning to slow down and follow your body's lead.  When I first picked this DVD up, I didn't know that Geri was a Spice Girl', or I wouldn't have taken it seriously, but I'm glad that I did.  She's a riot, and has one of those personalities that can't just 'zip it', (like me), that's what makes it so fun, to break up the monotony, and her perfect accent is so funny.  She's gorgeous, but doesn't act like it at all, (which makes me like her even more)!  I have John Lee, and  love his very serious  workouts, but this is so refreshing, I live in the country and feel like when I put the DVD in the recorder, it's time to have fun with real friends!  Thanks Geri and Katy, and I'm so glad that I bought your two DVD set.  I hope you come out with more, you make it all so fun!",5,Geri was great!,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,1378,"['have', 'done', 'Yoga', 'not', 'steadily', 'have', 'several', 'other', 'DVD', 'subject', 'one', 'favorite', 'very', 'relaxing', 'atmosphere', 'yes', 'Geri', 'always', 'something', 'add', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'someone', 'always', 'very', 'positive', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'thinking', 'anyway', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sweet', 'blunt', 'way', 'guess', ""'re"", 'looking', 'very', 'serious', 'workout', 'different', 'felt', 'was', 'room', 'working', 'out', 'bunch', 'friends', 'Kasy', 'Appleton', 'always', 'so', 'concerned', 'noone', 'more', 'should', 'body', 'mentioning', 'slow', 'down', 'follow', 'body', 'lead', 'When', 'first', 'picked', 'DVD', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Geri', 'was', 'Spice', 'Girl', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'seriously', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'riot', 'one', 'personalities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', ""'zip"", 'what', 'so', 'fun', 'break', 'up', 'monotony', 'perfect', 'accent', 'so', 'funny', 'gorgeous', ""n't"", 'act', 'even', 'more', 'have', 'John', 'Lee', 'love', 'very', 'serious', 'workouts', 'so', 'refreshing', 'live', 'country', 'feel', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'recorder', 'time', 'have', 'fun', 'real', 'friends', 'Thanks', 'Geri', 'Katy', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'hope', 'come', 'out', 'more', 'make', 'so', 'fun']",Geri Yoga With Katy Appleton

I felt like I was part of a very small class, as Katy moved back and forth between Geri doing the advanced work and another woman doing easier poses. I felt so smooth and relaxed after, and my shoulders and back didn't crack at all for the rest of the day.Geri DOES talk far too much, and seems rather obsessed with which poses help your digestive system, but it didn't stress me out. This DVD is more instructional than a workout, but I certainly felt worked out after.Overall, a good start for a beginner but probably not for more advanced students.",5,"Really solid intro to yoga, even with Geri's chatter",1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,670,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'anyone', 'lot', 'yoga', 'experience', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'nearly', 'senseless', 'DVD', 'was', 'perfect', 'felt', 'was', 'part', 'very', 'small', 'class', 'Katy', 'moved', 'back', 'forth', 'Geri', 'doing', 'advanced', 'work', 'woman', 'doing', 'easier', 'poses', 'felt', 'so', 'smooth', 'relaxed', 'shoulders', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'crack', 'rest', 'day.Geri', 'DOES', 'talk', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'rather', 'obsessed', 'help', 'digestive', 'system', 'did', ""n't"", 'stress', 'out', 'DVD', 'more', 'instructional', 'workout', 'certainly', 'felt', 'worked', 'out', 'after.Overall', 'good', 'start', 'beginner', 'probably', 'not', 'more', 'advanced', 'students']",Geri Yoga With Katy Appleton

She looks good and is very scantily attired. There are two other people demonstrating different levels. I found this to be a good informative class that does not take itself too seriously.  They talk to each other during some of the poses and Geri tries to crack a joke once in awhile. All with the British accent.Katy Appleton as the instructor explains the approach to the postures. So it is a learning class, not just a workout routine. I like that they encourage the viewer to do the best they can and not try to be too perfect. They do show you what you are trying to achieve but on a given day one may not be able to get there. I like the two levels of exercise. At times I began with the easier approach but could move into the more demanding one as the class went in that direction. Both levels are demonstrated and explained.This video is rather long. More than 90 minutes, but I like that it doesn't rush. It is not vinyasa.  I found that I like the space to rest in between poses while Ms Appleton explains the next pose.  Some instructors jump into the next pose right away.  I liked the relaxation at the end. It's about 5 minutes. Some classes skip that part of the work.Their approach takes great care to remind me not to go beyond my limitations.  Those limitations might vary somewhat from day to day. It does show you the more challenging positions too, if you can go there. I usually can't.In the end I feel like I've done a worthwhile workout. I felt good when I finished the class.",4,lighthearted yoga,1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,1604,"['have', 'many', 'yoga', 'videos', 'collection', 'added', 'one', 'Geri', 'Just', 'curious', 'suppose', 'good', 'very', 'scantily', 'attired', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'people', 'demonstrating', 'different', 'levels', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'informative', 'class', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'talk', 'other', 'poses', 'Geri', 'tries', 'crack', 'joke', 'once', 'awhile', 'British', 'accent.Katy', 'Appleton', 'instructor', 'approach', 'postures', 'learning', 'class', 'not', 'just', 'workout', 'routine', 'like', 'encourage', 'viewer', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'too', 'perfect', 'do', 'show', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'achieve', 'given', 'day', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'there', 'two', 'levels', 'exercise', 'times', 'began', 'easier', 'approach', 'could', 'move', 'more', 'demanding', 'one', 'class', 'went', 'direction', 'levels', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'explained.This', 'video', 'rather', 'long', 'More', '90', 'minutes', 'like', ""n't"", 'rush', 'not', 'vinyasa', 'found', 'like', 'space', 'rest', 'poses', 'Ms', 'Appleton', 'next', 'pose', 'instructors', 'jump', 'next', 'pose', 'right', 'away', 'liked', 'relaxation', 'end', '5', 'minutes', 'classes', 'skip', 'part', 'work.Their', 'approach', 'great', 'care', 'remind', 'not', 'go', 'limitations', 'limitations', 'might', 'vary', 'somewhat', 'day', 'day', 'show', 'more', 'challenging', 'positions', 'too', 'can', 'go', 'there', 'usually', ""can't.In"", 'end', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'done', 'worthwhile', 'workout', 'felt', 'good', 'when', 'finished', 'class']",Geri Yoga With Katy Appleton

There is great instruction for beginners who can be intimidated by the poses.  The caveats given about shoulder and head stand being done with a teacher in the beginning of learning are not usually given in yoga workout videos.  I have been practicing yoga for over 18 years and I have seldom heard the warnings given that were said on this dvd.  I agree the set ups are slow but I do not believe that this workout is geared toward the experienced practitioner.
