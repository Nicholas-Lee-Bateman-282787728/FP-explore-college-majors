1610539,A3JSO0N085OQXU,B00AGJYJZM,B. Wasden,"[0, 2]","Scenes From A Gay Marriage is a movie with its share of eye candy. There are some handsome men in this film. And there are some funny moments too. But the story isn't that great. And the sound isn't, either. For example, a lot of Matt Riddlehoover's dialogue was really hard to hear on my computer. This isn't a bad movie, and I would recommend it to gay film fans because it has cute guys who are gay. But I wish it would have been better and some nudity wouldn't have hurt.

But the overall film was very good. And I laughed more times than I could count. The movie has an interesting range of people, including the lost lover, of course the &#34;married&#34; couple, the requisite woman sensitive to gays and very open, and some hunky men.

1610544,A2SE9F3RBSJQEH,B00AGJYJZM,Thierry,"[2, 3]","I wanted to give this movie more stars. Really did. It is well photographed, the acting is good, the storyline is interesting, the comedy lines are great, and it's a well constructed film. More than anything, it feels like a Woody Allen type film, where people all talk like they really do in real life and illustrate how they deal with real life situations. I felt like I was eavesdropping in on the actual lives of the characters while watching the film.The female lead was ""something else"". Kind of like a white trailer trash macho male, talking about all manner of things that offend ""his ego"", and hooked up on trolling for p...y wherever he can find it. Somebody should have washed her mouth out with Lava soap at some point, but then again she would not have been nearly as funny.I think the title of the film should have been ""all the interesting things that come up when you don't have a life"". Here we have a protagonist who is out of love, out of work, out of ideas. And then things just start popping up in his life that are interesting. From the neighbors upstairs who he overhears and draws the wrong conclusions, to a new slant on his relationship with his former boyfriend, who has moved away, but helps him to understand what is happening in his new life alone. And then there's the new guy in his life that just pops up in the form of a maintenance man.What he does about all the new happenings in his life seem really true to form from the perspective of the gay subculture. How relationships begin, develop, continue or end in the culture is accurately portrayed in the film with a happy ending to boot. What could be better?So, why only the 3 stars. There are two significant flaws in the film that unfortunately diminish what it could have been.  The first is a production values issues. It is very difficult to hear what people are saying in the film, especially when you hear them talk through the air duct.  There are no subtitles available with the film, so it is very difficult to pick up lots of the dialogue unless you turn up the volume way too high. And then, there is a more serious problem with the music in the film. It is obvious that Mark is trying to imitate Woody Allen with his musical choices. The music is great, BUT it needs serious editing.The music is so loud and played when people are talking, that it drowns out the dialog. And it comes up at inappropriate times in the film as well. It looks like the director didn't understand that the music should be an accent to the dialog and action, not in place of it. Perhaps the director should watch more Allen movies to see how the master interweaves the dialog and music into the context of the film. That would have really helped here.None the less, an interesting film that merits even a second viewing.",3,Interesting things to do when you don't have a life,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2798,"['wanted', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'stars', 'Really', 'did', 'well', 'photographed', 'acting', 'good', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'comedy', 'lines', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'constructed', 'film', 'More', 'anything', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'type', 'film', 'where', 'people', 'talk', 'really', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'illustrate', 'how', 'deal', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'felt', 'was', 'eavesdropping', 'actual', 'lives', 'characters', 'watching', 'film.The', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'Kind', 'white', 'trailer', 'trash', 'macho', 'male', 'talking', 'manner', 'things', 'offend', 'ego', 'hooked', 'up', 'trolling', 'p', 'y', 'can', 'find', 'Somebody', 'should', 'have', 'washed', 'mouth', 'Lava', 'soap', 'point', 'then', 'again', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'funny.I', 'think', 'title', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'things', 'come', 'up', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'life', 'Here', 'have', 'protagonist', 'who', 'love', 'work', 'ideas', 'then', 'things', 'just', 'start', 'popping', 'up', 'life', 'are', 'interesting', 'neighbors', 'upstairs', 'who', 'wrong', 'conclusions', 'new', 'slant', 'relationship', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'moved', 'away', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'new', 'life', 'alone', 'then', 'new', 'guy', 'life', 'just', 'up', 'form', 'maintenance', 'new', 'happenings', 'life', 'seem', 'really', 'true', 'form', 'perspective', 'gay', 'subculture', 'How', 'relationships', 'begin', 'develop', 'continue', 'end', 'culture', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'boot', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'So', 'why', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'are', 'two', 'significant', 'flaws', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'production', 'issues', 'very', 'difficult', 'hear', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'hear', 'talk', 'air', 'duct', 'are', 'subtitles', 'available', 'film', 'very', 'difficult', 'pick', 'up', 'lots', 'dialogue', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'then', 'more', 'serious', 'problem', 'music', 'film', 'obvious', 'Mark', 'trying', 'imitate', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'musical', 'choices', 'music', 'great', 'BUT', 'serious', 'editing.The', 'music', 'so', 'loud', 'played', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'out', 'dialog', 'up', 'inappropriate', 'times', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'accent', 'dialog', 'action', 'not', 'place', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'should', 'watch', 'more', 'Allen', 'movies', 'see', 'how', 'master', 'dialog', 'music', 'context', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'helped', 'here.None', 'less', 'interesting', 'film', 'even', 'second', 'viewing']",Scenes from a Gay Marriage
