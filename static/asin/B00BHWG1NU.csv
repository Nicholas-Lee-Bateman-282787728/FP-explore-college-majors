The show is first off so colorful and features adorable little main characters that I knew my kids would want to watch it.  Second though is the educational benefits from it.  The show teams teamwork, patterns, shapes, and numbers.  This particular DVD features 91 minutes of Team Umizoomi adventures and it is broken down into four episodes.Purple Monkey MissionBuster the Lost DogCuckoo BearsAnimal School House!As you can probably tell from the names of the episodes and the DVD, this title is all about animals.  Each episode has an animal that the Umizoomi help and it was adorable to see all these episodes on one DVD.  While these are episodes that have been on television, I don't think we had seem any of them previously.  The animation is super adorable and the music gets my kids excited and moving.I received this title to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",5,Adorable Animals!,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,997,"['first', 'time', 'watched', 'Team', 'Umizoomi', 'knew', 'was', 'show', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'kids', 'watching', 'show', 'first', 'off', 'so', 'colorful', 'features', 'adorable', 'little', 'main', 'characters', 'knew', 'kids', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'Second', 'though', 'educational', 'benefits', 'show', 'teams', 'teamwork', 'patterns', 'shapes', 'numbers', 'particular', 'DVD', '91', 'minutes', 'Team', 'Umizoomi', 'adventures', 'broken', 'down', 'four', 'episodes.Purple', 'Monkey', 'MissionBuster', 'Lost', 'DogCuckoo', 'BearsAnimal', 'School', 'House', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'names', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'title', 'animals', 'episode', 'animal', 'Umizoomi', 'help', 'was', 'adorable', 'see', 'episodes', 'one', 'DVD', 'are', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'television', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'seem', 'previously', 'animation', 'super', 'adorable', 'music', 'kids', 'excited', 'moving.I', 'received', 'title', 'review', 'exchange', 'sharing', 'honest', 'opinion']",Team Umizoomi: Animal Heroes
