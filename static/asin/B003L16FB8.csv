1348304,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B003L16FB8,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[3, 3]","I am usually apprehensive to watch movie versions of theatre plays, and it is rare that a performance is pulled off to perfection. This was it! Superb performances, true to the dramatic plot, and complete with intensive moods required to pull it off. And, when I knew that two impressive actors would portray the characters, Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft as Thelma, the mother of Jessie, a young lady planning her suicide, carefully, strategically and nonchalantly. The story takes place in the home with just two people, and all in one night, within a matter of a couple of hours. There is no musical soundtrack to draw from the moods.Pulitzer Prize by Marsha Norman 'Night Mother.Marsha Norman won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983, and when I learned she did the Screenplay for the movie, I was more confident the performance would be first class. If you haven't read the book, do so, it is riveting, unlike something you may have read in drama.A right to dieJessie is divorced and has a juvenile son whose whereabouts are unknown. She caretakes for her mother, Thelma and has a brother Dawson and his family who live nearby. In her lifetime, Jessie has had epileptic seizures, her husband Cecil left her and she moved back with her mother. She feels like a failure. But it is this night, after plans to do her mother's manicure, that Jessie plans go to her bedroom and kill herself. It is her right, as she is tired, hurt, sad, and feels used. Throughout, you will learn of the past.Stages of grief - for the livingIn 1969, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross wrote the groundbreaking book, On Death and Dying (Scribner Classics) and named the five stages of grief that people who are dying go through, and not in an exact order. The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. What we see is Thelma, going through these stages, denying that the suicide will happen, angry attempting to stop it, bargaining with Jessie to stay alive, depressed and down with this reality.This is an emotional, powerful film with exceptional performances....Rizzo",5,"""I'm tired, I'm hurt, I'm sad, I feel used""  -  Superb performances!",1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,2059,"['am', 'usually', 'apprehensive', 'watch', 'movie', 'versions', 'theatre', 'plays', 'rare', 'performance', 'pulled', 'off', 'perfection', 'was', 'Superb', 'performances', 'true', 'dramatic', 'plot', 'complete', 'intensive', 'moods', 'required', 'pull', 'off', 'when', 'knew', 'two', 'impressive', 'actors', 'would', 'portray', 'characters', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Thelma', 'mother', 'Jessie', 'young', 'lady', 'planning', 'suicide', 'carefully', 'strategically', 'nonchalantly', 'story', 'place', 'home', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'one', 'night', 'matter', 'couple', 'hours', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'draw', 'moods.Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Marsha', 'Norman', 'Mother.Marsha', 'Norman', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', '1983', 'when', 'learned', 'did', 'Screenplay', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'confident', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'class', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'do', 'so', 'riveting', 'something', 'may', 'have', 'read', 'drama.A', 'right', 'dieJessie', 'divorced', 'juvenile', 'son', 'whereabouts', 'are', 'unknown', 'mother', 'Thelma', 'brother', 'Dawson', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'nearby', 'lifetime', 'Jessie', 'had', 'epileptic', 'seizures', 'husband', 'Cecil', 'left', 'moved', 'back', 'mother', 'failure', 'night', 'plans', 'do', 'mother', 'manicure', 'Jessie', 'go', 'bedroom', 'kill', 'right', 'tired', 'hurt', 'sad', 'feels', 'used', 'Throughout', 'will', 'learn', 'past.Stages', 'grief', 'livingIn', '1969', 'Dr.', 'Elizabeth', 'Kubler-Ross', 'wrote', 'groundbreaking', 'book', 'Death', 'Dying', 'Scribner', 'Classics', 'named', 'five', 'stages', 'grief', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'dying', 'go', 'not', 'exact', 'order', 'five', 'stages', 'are', 'denial', 'anger', 'bargaining', 'depression', 'acceptance', 'What', 'see', 'Thelma', 'going', 'stages', 'denying', 'suicide', 'will', 'happen', 'angry', 'attempting', 'stop', 'bargaining', 'Jessie', 'stay', 'alive', 'depressed', 'down', 'reality.This', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'film', 'exceptional', 'performances', '.Rizzo']",N/A

Anne Bancroft (God Rest her Soul) was a fabulous actress. She brings an element of talent to every film she has been in, completely transforming the film from good to WOW. Add Sissy Spacek to the mix and you have (in my opinion)one of the greatest films to come out of the 80s era of great film. This movie takes place in a small house in the country. The dialogue had to be good to pull this off and these two actresses did a great job.  This movie is about Jessie a troubled woman, who decides that she does not want to endure life anymore. She prepares for her suicide and discusses it with her mother while catching up on household chores, drinking hot coco and sitting at the breakfast table. Listen to what she says, her words are so profound, so moving and saddly real.  I watch this movie over and over, understanding Jessie and feeling so very sorry for her mother.

Note, I'm not here to give a review of this film, I am here to praise the spectacular acting and to highly suggest watching it to anyone that wants to experience superior acting. Sissy Spacek (in brown eye contacts that make her look impossibly sad) should have taken home her second Best Actress Oscar for this performance. That isn't just a statement, it's a fact. This is, without a doubt, one of the finest performances ever caught on film. I have now seen this film 3 times, and her flawless performance only gets better every time. Anne Bancroft is also amazing, and thankfully, offers a tiny bit of comic relief in this grim and devastating film. Both actresses had a ton of dialog to remember, and they both handled it with expertise, as evidenced in one 'long take' after another.Like I stated, this story is unrelentingly grim, but it's one that will raise a lot of questions and discussions with its viewers. To me, that's always a good thing.But first and foremost, I highly recommend this film to all to witness 'acting' at its absolute finest. It simply can not get any better than this. I have never known of Sissy Spacek giving a weak performance, and she's certainly  been outstanding in the many films of hers that I have seen.

1348310,A3KWSNJD5OOAIF,B003L16FB8,"JesusIsLordDLWC ""DLWC""","[0, 0]","I would not recommend anyone watching this film especially if you are suicidial. Sissy Spacek's charter in this movie was not only phyiscally ill with epilepsy, she was also seriously depressed to the point of suicide and Ann Bancroft's character was her mother whom was in a constant state of denial and ignorance concerning her daughter's condition since childhood. Sissy Spacek's character's family also treated her horribly and stayed away from Sissy Spacek due to ignorance, her brother and his wife would seldom come to visit her and when they did, Sissy could not deal with the socialization of  being around other people. It is hard to say weather or not the disease of epilepsy has anything to do with severe depression, but, I would imagine that from a sucidialpoint of view such as euthanasia (assisted suicide) it would make matters worse. If you are not familiar with epilepsy, then let metell you a little bit about it from what I have experienced, &#34;Epilepsy (from the Ancient Greek verb &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; meaning &#34;to seize, possess, or afflict&#34;)[1] is a group of long-term neurological disorders characterized by epileptic seizures.[2] These seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking.[3] In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause[2] while seizures that occur due to a specific cause are not deemed to represent epilepsy.[4]In most cases the cause is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain cancer, and drug and alcohol misuse, among others. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal cortical nerve cell activity in the brain.[4] The diagnosis typically involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms (such as syncope) as well as figuring out whether any immediate causes are present. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG).Epilepsy cannot be cured, but seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases.[5] In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, surgery, neurostimulation or dietary changes may be considered. Sissy Spacek's character had a son whom she never really saw or was estranged to and he was a criminal. Her marriage to her husband did not work out due to her illnesses and her mother was more dependent on Sissy than Sissy was dependent on her mother.  All throughout the movieshe prepares for kill herself with her deceased father's shot gun and does everything throughout the movie to prepare for it.This movie is not for the faint of heart, it will leave you feeling extremely depressed and sad. Please do not watch this movieif you are sucidial. The acting in this movie was excellent and the story line was also excellent but did not address the hopelessness this woman felt because of her loneliness and illness. She felt totally worthless and helpless because of the epilepsy and seizures. You might want to find another more uplifting movie with Sissy Spacek and Ann Bancroft, both are excellent actresses.June 20, 2014Mrs. Dione  L. WilliamsCrayton, Craytond2000@msn.com, Naperville, IL.

I'm still trying to decide whether it was a mistake or not. The first five minutes made me think so&#8212;for one thing, I knew I was in for trouble when I saw &#34;produced by Aaron Spelling,&#34; and for another, the syrupy, bucolic music (supplied by TV music guru David Shire, who's about a half-step above Yanni on the subtlety scale) makes a mockery of the play's subject matter: a late-thirtysomething divorcee, Jessie (Sissy Spacek) tells her mother (Anne Bancroft) that she's going to kill herself in a few hours, and the two of them go back and forth about the decision while reliving memories and having heart-to-hearts about various topics. The play is notable for being one of the first, and still one of the only, level-headed looks at suicide in American literature, and after that first bit is out of the way (it actually continues on about fifteen minutes after the opening credits, and none of it's in the play), we get down to the brass tacks of Ms. Norman's contest of wills between a woman who's tired of life and a mother who's too scared to be tired of life. And it's fantastic. Spacek and Bancroft both play their roles to the hilt, and while the dialogue isn't quite as intense in the film as it is in the play (cameras being what they are, the characters are allowed to move about the house, where the play takes place almost completely in two rooms), it still works extremely well. And then comes the end of the play... and David Shire works his magic once again, wrecking the film's effect. (The movie also emphasizes one line I managed to pass over in the play, during Bancroft's last speech, that's just plain bad, and one wonders why Norman, who adapted her own play for the screen, allowed it to remain.)Fast forward through the first twenty minutes (up to where Spacek asks Bancroft where the gun is, which opens the play) and stop at the last line of the play (&#34;Loretta? Let me speak to Dawson, honey.&#34;) and you've got a decent adaptation of an excellent play. ***",3,Exit Stage Right.,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,2180,"[""'night"", 'Mother', 'Tom', 'Moore', '1986', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '18Jun2001', ']', 'Having', 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Marsha', 'Norman', 'wonderful', 'Pulitzer-winning', 'play', 'figured', ""'d"", 'check', 'out', 'movie', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'decide', 'was', 'mistake', 'not', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'made', 'think', 'so', '8212', 'one', 'thing', 'knew', 'was', 'trouble', 'when', 'saw', '34', 'produced', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', '34', 'syrupy', 'bucolic', 'music', 'supplied', 'TV', 'music', 'guru', 'David', 'Shire', 'who', 'half-step', 'Yanni', 'subtlety', 'scale', 'mockery', 'play', 'subject', 'matter', 'late-thirtysomething', 'divorcee', 'Jessie', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'going', 'kill', 'few', 'hours', 'two', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'decision', 'reliving', 'memories', 'having', 'heart-to-hearts', 'various', 'topics', 'play', 'notable', 'being', 'one', 'first', 'still', 'one', 'only', 'level-headed', 'looks', 'suicide', 'American', 'literature', 'first', 'bit', 'way', 'actually', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'opening', 'credits', 'none', 'play', 'get', 'down', 'brass', 'tacks', 'Ms.', 'Norman', 'contest', 'wills', 'woman', 'who', 'tired', 'life', 'mother', 'who', 'too', 'scared', 'be', 'tired', 'life', 'fantastic', 'Spacek', 'Bancroft', 'play', 'roles', 'hilt', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'quite', 'intense', 'film', 'play', 'cameras', 'being', 'what', 'are', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'move', 'house', 'where', 'play', 'place', 'almost', 'completely', 'two', 'rooms', 'still', 'extremely', 'well', 'then', 'end', 'play', 'David', 'Shire', 'magic', 'once', 'again', 'wrecking', 'film', 'effect', 'movie', 'also', 'one', 'line', 'managed', 'pass', 'over', 'play', 'Bancroft', 'last', 'speech', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'Norman', 'who', 'adapted', 'own', 'play', 'screen', 'allowed', 'remain', 'Fast', 'forward', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'where', 'Spacek', 'Bancroft', 'where', 'gun', 'play', 'stop', 'last', 'line', 'play', '34', 'Loretta', 'Let', 'speak', 'Dawson', 'honey.', '34', ""'ve"", 'got', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'excellent', 'play', '***']",N/A
