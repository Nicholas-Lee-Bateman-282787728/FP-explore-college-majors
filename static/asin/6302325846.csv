Starring Bette Davis in one of her best roles of her long career.In Family Reunion, the incomparable Bette Davis shines in one of her last roles of her illustrious career. Portraying a woman of conscience, she speaks of all that is noble about small town America and the value of family loyalties.Bette Davis stars as Elizabeth Winfield, a feisty, New England school teacher, retiring after fifty years of educating children in the community which bears her name.For her years of service, she is given an unlimited bus pass and sets out on a cross-country odyssey to heal old family feuds, not realizing she is being lured out of Winfield in a cunning plot by greedy shopping mall developers.

After waiting many years for DVD release, I now have a more permanent copy to play again and again.  Inspired by a story in Ladies Home Journal decades ago, this wonderful tale of a willful, obdurate and stubborn matriarch of the  Winfield clan shipped off with a bus ticket so her family can undertake some chickanery behind her back is wonderfully played by a galaxy of well-known character actors crowned by Ms. Davis and her pedantic style of speech and well-done New England accent. A great story about family coming together to realize that blood means moe than money.

I saw this years ago on t.v. as it was a made for television movie. The plot is very good. Your basic good fighting evil. Well, maybe not evil, but definitely not good. All of the acting was not fantastic, but Bette Davis was superb. The time-line with distances don't always seem to work, but overall, the movie is so much worth watching and owning. Now that I have it, it will be one of those movies I watch once-a-year.
