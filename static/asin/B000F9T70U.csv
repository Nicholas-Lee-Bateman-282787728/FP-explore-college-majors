These kids have EVERYTHING.They are pretty spoiled, but most of them have managed tobe decent people, despite their lush surroundings.  It is fun to see them interact, with the gorgeous backdrop of sun and surf.  It's a lifestyle that most of us will never know, and maybe that is part of why it is so fascinating. They take it so for granted. A new Beamer from Daddy for graduation.  A quick trip to Cabo.  Blowing a couple thou in a boutique with your besties.  And the pedicures!This series was made about 6 or 7 years ago, so it would beinteresting to see where these kids are now.  We know where Lauren Conrad and Kristin Cavalleri are, but the restare not really in the public eye. I wish they would do a followup special of ""Where are they Now?""

All they do is vacation because heaven forbid they go get real jobs.  Then they winge to each other about the same stuff day after day after day after day ...  They rehash the same boy issues over and over and for a change of pace, the guys are more mature than the idiot girls.  When Kristin and Stephen have their talk about her seeing another guy, there is no dialogue because they are both too stupid to think of something to say, and then what happens?  She drives off in her car on the phone (very safe driving) and mouths off about him to her friend and every other word is 'like'.  If they say 'like' one more time, I might scream.  And who the heck pays for their vacations etc?  Their parents who if had been present in their lives more, might have raised better kids.  These kids might be rich, but their lives are boring because all they do is hang out with the same people (even those they hate) at the same places all the boring time.  Why don't they read a newspaper or do something else intelligent to broaden their narrow minds and bring more varied conversations to this show.Don't waste your money on this rubbish.
