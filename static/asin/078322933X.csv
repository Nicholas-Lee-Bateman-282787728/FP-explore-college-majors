Although Mark Wahlberg is an awful actor, he is effective, albeit in a corny way, during the film. Reese Witherspoon's acting is the key ingredient in making the film to work because of her reactions to different situations. The biggest bonus of Fear is the inclusion of William Peterson who played two of the all-time great characters in To Live and Die in L.A. and Manhunter. There is absolutely no contest between him and Mark Wahlberg, so it is unfair for the father to go up against three to five antagonists at once. Peterson obviously brings a lot of energy to other end just like how Nick Nolte did for Cape Fear. As for the story, I have a hard time thinking any negative points, perhaps I am just too sick of Marky Mark.

When David starts to come on strong to innocent Nicole, her father, an over protective and rather wealthy man, proclaims that he is too much of a secretive boyfriend to hold on to and after Nicole attempts to break up with him, that's when all hell breaks loose.This is truly Wahlberg's break-out role. He perfectly portrays that of a sickingly psychotic killer (and in one dramatic scene, beats himself up to win over Nicole) and while, surprise surprise, Reese Witherspoon seems totally in love with him, you know there's something wrong. But you just can't help but watch it!In the end, Walhberg and Witherspoon come to terms with their strange romance in a dramatic twist that the ignorant might have not seen coming. And while it's predictable plot might not immediately win you over, the superb acting will.

61516,A2582KMXLK2P06,078322933X,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Fear was a surprise.  The first 20 minutes are entirely generic and forgettable garbage involving familiar conflicts between a sassy and stubborn teenage daughter (played by a very cute and young Reese Witherspoon) and her parents resulting in several arguments that we've seen thousands of times before (both on TV and in reality).  However as soon as Reese Witherspoon's character meets a boy at a hip party that she has a crush on, almost nobody would have guessed the serious direction this plotline would have turned.This boyfriend is completely nuts.  He's apparently part of a gang that lives in a cabin of sorts, and does several bad things including treating women as sex objects and just a complete lack of respect for them overall.  These kids also have a strong desire to get even with the people they happen to have a personal problem with.  It just so happens -due to constant threats- that Reese's father is their main target which results in a tremendously enjoyable and suspenseful final 25 minutes of film.  Saying this group of kids is unstable is quite the understatement.  They have no compassion for the harm they cause and are willing to fight to the death.I can't get over how young Reese Witherspoon looks in this movie.  It's amazing really.  I'm not even sure at this point she was aware her popularity would skyrocket a few years later.  I'm not sure if this movie was in any way responsible for her future success either.  I don't really remember hearing about Fear back in the day though it's really such a solid movie that it most certainly *should* have been mentioned and *should* be remembered.

FEAR presents an excellent view of one such super-thug in Wahlberg's character. He is a cruel, explosive keg of rage and fury. At first, when trying to woo young Nicole (Reese Witherspoon from American Psycho), David appears sweet, sensitive, and understanding. Well, it's all just a a means to an end. David only wants to have Nicole, to possess her. His sugary words in the beginning are meant only as bait. Nicole's dad (William Peterson) is suspicious of David from the start. He goes out of his way to keep him away from his daughter, which draws them closer together. Ultimately, Nicole must (and boy, does she!) see David for what he truly is for herself. Her fantasies must be shattered before it's too late. Unfortunately, David is very persistant, and will not give up so easily. He is crazy, which enables him to do as he pleases without rules, limits, or much thought. He's a scary guy! I thoroughly enjoyed FEAR and recommend it as a great thriller.

Martin Scorsese's CAPE FEAR is a good example of a film dealing with this thematic if, of course, one doesn't count the hundreds of B-movies available here at Amazon. Now, why James Foley, the acclaimed director of AT CLOSE RANGE, took an interest in such a project ?A careful vision of FEAR, beyond the thrills produced by this kind of film, is necessary. In this perspective, the first scene of the movie is very revealing. A father of a 16 years old girl is shocked by the sexy clothes she's wearing. With his very protective behaviour, he will then do everything he can to get away David Mc Call from Reese Witherspoon. With little success of course. Note the numerous references to make-up, clothes, condoms in FEAR as if the characters wanted to protect themseves. From what ? From the bestial Mc Call whose apparitions in the film always coincide with the destruction of the protections carefully created by the father Steve Walker. Reese Witherspoon gets an hematoma while tring to protect her friend Gary from David's burst of anger and she will have her first sexual experience with him.

The film starts off promising enough with the nubile but virginal Nicole(Reese Witherspoon) falling for brooding grunge boy David(Mark Wahlberg) starting with whispering sweet nothings to more intimate contact on a rollercoaster.  Daddy Steve(William Petersen) objects to David but can't exactly put his finger on it.  Maybe it's the fact that David pummeled Gary, Nicole's platonic friend, and blackened Nicole's eyes in the process.  Whatever subtlety there was in the film is thrown out the window with an extended siege by David and his grunge buddies of Nicole's house that plays like a junior version of ""Cape Fear"".

Fear, however, is quite effective for what it is and though nothing about it is top-rate as far as a great Thriller goes, the combined package of what Fear offers still grabs hold of you and pulls you in for the ride.David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) catches the eye of Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) and the pair hook up for an evening together after leaving a dance club.  Nicole is practically shocked when the man she gets to know is much more than meets the eye, and her dreams seem to be coming true when she thinks she has found the perfect guy.  The first half of Fear sets up a love story that is actually enjoyable to watch, as both David and Nicole fall for each other.  I never felt the love story was ever very cheesy, especially when the ""roller coaster experience"" is quite original.  David finally meets Nicole's family, and everyone is amazed at this perfect, handsome gentlemen.  Everyone except Nicole's father, Steve (William Peterson) who just doesn't buy into it.All good things must come to an end....if it's too good to be true....etc etc...and here we go...David comes by Nicole's school on a typical afternoon to pick her up and witnesses her friend Gary hugging her.  The kind and gentle David we thought we knew is suddenly transformed into a raging beast, knocking Gary to the ground and kicking the crap out of him.  Smart Nicole thankfully doesn't want anything to do with David again.  Regretting his mistake, David apologizes til it wears down Nicole.  She gives David another chance, meanwhile outraging Steve.  Thus begins the war between Steve and David, and eventually brining the enitre family into the mix.The last half of Fear is, well, Fear.  The thrills and suspense begin.  The final setting of the film is at the Walker residence, where David and his buddies won't rest until they bust inside and do the damage.  Overall, it's a predictable finale, but the bits and pieces getting there are always fun and contain some surprise thrills.You might feel silly when you step out of the spotlight about Fear, cause its certainly not a masterpiece but its a fun ride nevertheless that effectively entertains.  If you're looking for a good teenager love story that isn't cheesy follwed by a sudden turn for the worst in terms of thrills, Fear is worth checking out.Acting - 3.5Characters - 3.5Story - 3.5Suspense - 4Overall - 4",4,If it's too good to be true...,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,2473,"['Fear', 'sort-of', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'type', 'thriller', 'though', 'not', 'classic', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'become', 'Fear', 'however', 'quite', 'effective', 'what', 'nothing', 'top-rate', 'as', 'far', 'great', 'Thriller', 'combined', 'package', 'what', 'Fear', 'still', 'grabs', 'hold', 'pulls', 'ride.David', 'McCall', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'eye', 'Nicole', 'Walker', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'pair', 'hook', 'up', 'evening', 'together', 'leaving', 'dance', 'club', 'Nicole', 'practically', 'shocked', 'when', 'man', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'dreams', 'seem', 'be', 'coming', 'true', 'when', 'found', 'perfect', 'guy', 'first', 'half', 'Fear', 'up', 'love', 'story', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'David', 'Nicole', 'fall', 'other', 'never', 'felt', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'ever', 'very', 'cheesy', 'especially', 'when', 'roller', 'coaster', 'experience', 'quite', 'original', 'David', 'finally', 'Nicole', 'family', 'everyone', 'amazed', 'perfect', 'handsome', 'gentlemen', 'Everyone', 'Nicole', 'father', 'Steve', 'William', 'Peterson', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.All', 'good', 'things', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', '.etc', 'etc', 'here', 'go', 'David', 'Nicole', 'school', 'typical', 'afternoon', 'pick', 'up', 'friend', 'Gary', 'hugging', 'kind', 'gentle', 'David', 'thought', 'knew', 'suddenly', 'transformed', 'raging', 'beast', 'knocking', 'Gary', 'ground', 'kicking', 'crap', 'Smart', 'Nicole', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'David', 'again', 'Regretting', 'mistake', 'David', 'down', 'Nicole', 'David', 'chance', 'meanwhile', 'outraging', 'Steve', 'Thus', 'war', 'Steve', 'David', 'eventually', 'brining', 'enitre', 'family', 'mix.The', 'last', 'half', 'Fear', 'well', 'Fear', 'thrills', 'suspense', 'begin', 'final', 'setting', 'film', 'Walker', 'residence', 'where', 'David', 'buddies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rest', 'bust', 'inside', 'do', 'damage', 'Overall', 'predictable', 'finale', 'bits', 'pieces', 'getting', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'contain', 'surprise', 'thrills.You', 'might', 'feel', 'silly', 'when', 'step', 'spotlight', 'Fear', 'cause', 'certainly', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'fun', 'ride', 'nevertheless', 'effectively', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'teenager', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'cheesy', 'follwed', 'sudden', 'turn', 'worst', 'terms', 'thrills', 'Fear', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.Acting', '3.5Characters', '3.5Story', '3.5Suspense', '4Overall', '4']",N/A

I didn't really see what this movie didn't have to please people around the globe. It had a story, and an intriguing one at that, it had a lot of genres to mix its story up in, it had well-developed characters - especially the character of the father - and it had excellent direction, acting and a great script that explores further into the world of terror. The film succeeds highly because of its characters and the original bunch they are. Reese Witherspoon plays the short-skirt wearing, blonde-haired and extremely family-bound and nice young girl that gets involved with a psychopath and doesn't know how to take it. Mark Wahlberg plays this psychopath excellently, his character is someone obsessed with Witherspoon's character and we will go to any great lengths to protect her and assure that his and her relationship is safe. And then he gets violent, very violent, and the outcome is horrifying. The father is not the most original character in the film, but the most developed. He is the caring, brave and extremely clever dad who wants the best for his daughter but doesn't want to hurt her. Anyway, enough about the characters. The rest of the movie rocks too - the script is surprisingly original for its premise, taking the boy-meets-girl, girl-dumps-boy, boy-gets-angry angle to new areas in psychological horror. The suspense scenes are incredibly tense and the movie has some gut-wrenchingly scary but incredibly good ideas.

Peterson) - a yuppy, workaholic architect, and Laura (Amy Brenneman), her neurotic, mother in law.  One day NIcole and her slutty friend Margo (Alyssa Milano) decide to skip school and go to a trendy hangout.  While there, they see two guys who they like, and more importantly they pick up a flyer for a party.At the party is where Nicole meets David (Mark Wahlberg), the same guy that caught her eye from that morning.  They are immediately smitten, and when the party breaks down into chaos, David is there to rescue Nicole; it's contemporary Romeo and Juliet.David plays the sensitive guy perfectly, quickly gaining Nicole's trust and affection.  It's an awkward romance, but he shows his rough edge rather early when he adjusts Nicole's watch to flout her parent's rules.  It's only a matter of t ime before he shows is intentions and darkside, as he manages to deflower Nicole on a roller-coaster and show a psychotic jealousy while absolutely laying the beatdown on Nicole's male friend who dared to hug her.  She obviously rebukes David, but eventually he wins back her trust.  It's amazing how intimidating David is, because he only gets worse, destroying property, stealing, psychological abuse, self mutilation, and much, much worse.From there the movie moves quickly to trouble, as a convincingly insane David begins to tear Nicole from her family and causes her father to truly hate him.  Conflict rises to the breaking point and it becomes a battle for survival as David will do anything to have Nicole as his own, and her friends and family must fight for not only her heart and mind, but also their safety.I highly recommend this movie for a psychological terror.  Mark Wahlberg has never been better, and he elicits genuine fear and terror as a troubled David.

In other words, the real danger to the purity and sanctity of their beloved girl is the world they have sheltered them in.

Their pure and beautiful daughter meets a dark and handsome stranger at a party, and is immediately drawn into his grip and power.3.)  This dark and handsome stranger is poor.  But much worse he's grammatically-challenged, and so these rich white men who've obviously all been educated at Hotchkiss and at Yale have absolutely no idea what he's saying.4.)  Their pure and beautiful daughter loses her virginity to this dark and handsome stranger with grammar issues.5.)  Their trophy wife starts liking this dark and handsome stranger.6.)

David seems nice at first but then things get out of hand and David becomes obsessive. The movie builds and builds to an exciting yet predictable ending that will leave you satisfied. Reese Witherspoon is wonderful as Nicole and Marc Wahlburg is creepy as David. Other notable performances are from William Peterson(from t.v's C.S.I) as Nicoles overprotective father, Amy Brennaman(Judging Amy) as the stepmom, and of course Nicole has to have a best friend played by the gorgeous Alyssa Milano star of Charmed.

Nicole dreams of falling in love with the perfect guy who will sweep her off her feet. That dream comes true for her one night at a rave when she meets David McCall, who instantly sweeps innocent Nicole off her feet with his charm and kind-heartedness. Unbeknownst to her, David has borderline personality disorder and is also an ex-convict. Well....you know this won't end well.When Steven first meets David, he takes a liking him but when Nicole begins staying out past curfew, ends up with a black eye (that she got after David accidentally hit her when he assaults her friend, Gary, after he discovers them hugging), and discovers an empty condom wrapper (after David sneaks into the house and has sex with Nicole one night) under Nicole's bed, he becomes suspicious of David and his motives. Steven decides to do some background research on David and digs up some interesting facts about David's background.After Nicole ends things with David after discovering him sexually forcing himself on her best friend, Margo one night, Steven makes it clear to David that he's no longer allowed to have any kind of contact with Nicole. Obviously having grown a deep obsession over Nicole, this doesn't sit well with David which is where it all begins to go south. What follows is David revealing his true colors and growing fatally aggressive and will plow down anyone standing in his way from being with the beautiful Nicole. How it ends? Well you'll have to see it for yourselfOverall this is a great and exciting thriller---despite it's corny elements. Mark Wahlberg plays the psycho character to a T and none of the characters disappoint in their roles.

Mark and a pinup underwear model, plays a psycho that matches physical skill with mental aptitude to alternately charm and terrorize high schooler Witherspoon, dad Peterson, and stepmom Brenneman. His role is metaphoric to the role Glenn Close played in ""Fatal Attraction"" while dad Peterson figures out right away he's a bad guy and warns daughter and wife of his bad deeds to come.The film travels a predictable path to an apocalyptic closing scene where Wahlberg and his gang of four seek revenge on Peterson, who trashed their home. They come equipped with guns, other weapons and psychic terror to carry out their revenge...only to learn the family lives in an impregnable home. As you may guess, it turns out not to be impregnable after all. The movie closes with many scenes of ultraviolence where the ending is just as predicatable as the rest of the story.What characterizes this film is its incredible violence. In one scene, a child of about 10 or 12 runs over a bad guy with a car. In another scene, stepmom Brenneman drills a hole through a bad guy's hand with a handheld motorized drill. Another time teen Witherspoon stabs her former boyfriend with a jagged edged piece of wood, leaving a gaping hole in his back. If this isn't enough, there is an animal beheading in the flick.This is an exciting and involving film but its copycat story and level of violence work against its value as art. While there is a lot of shock value to keep you riveted to the screen, it become increasingly more over the top as it goes on. In that respect it reminded me of the 1979 opus ""Fury"", where scenes of incredible violence punctuated the final 30 minutes and essentially changed the value of the film.""Fear"", too, is a throwback to 1970s slasher and hate filled movies and operates in the same horizontal plane. It pretends to be a teen version of ""Fatal Attraction"" with some of the tension of ""Cape Fear"" but is actually more akin to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" with violent criminals taking the place of ""The Hills'"" flesh eating wackos. Meanwhile, Mark Wahlberg's psycho has none of the artistry that Robert Mitchum and Robert DeNiro displayed in the original and remade ""Cape Fear"".I think it a good idea to show some fear before buying this and bringing it home if you have children under age 17. If you are a teen and/or want a cheap thrill, excitement and violence, this is your cup of tea.",3,"Exciting, ultraviolent and way over the top",1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,2825,"['Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'CSI', 'star', 'William', 'Petersen', 'Fraser', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'had', 'hit', 'stride', 'TV', 'movies', 'when', '1996', 'production', 'was', 'released', 'leaving', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'bad', 'girl', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'name', 'star', 'teen', 'version', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'also', 'mixes', 'affect', 'original', 'remake', 'Cape', 'Fear', '.Wahlberg', 'who', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'known', 'rapper', 'Mark', 'E.', 'Mark', 'pinup', 'underwear', 'model', 'psycho', 'physical', 'skill', 'mental', 'aptitude', 'alternately', 'charm', 'terrorize', 'high', 'schooler', 'Witherspoon', 'dad', 'Peterson', 'stepmom', 'Brenneman', 'role', 'metaphoric', 'role', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'played', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'dad', 'Peterson', 'figures', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'bad', 'guy', 'daughter', 'wife', 'bad', 'deeds', 'come.The', 'film', 'travels', 'predictable', 'path', 'apocalyptic', 'closing', 'scene', 'where', 'Wahlberg', 'gang', 'four', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Peterson', 'who', 'trashed', 'home', 'come', 'equipped', 'guns', 'other', 'weapons', 'psychic', 'terror', 'carry', 'out', 'revenge', 'only', 'learn', 'family', 'impregnable', 'home', 'may', 'guess', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'impregnable', 'movie', 'many', 'scenes', 'ultraviolence', 'where', 'ending', 'just', 'as', 'predicatable', 'rest', 'story.What', 'film', 'incredible', 'violence', 'one', 'scene', 'child', 'about', '10', '12', 'runs', 'bad', 'guy', 'car', 'scene', 'stepmom', 'Brenneman', 'hole', 'bad', 'guy', 'hand', 'handheld', 'motorized', 'drill', 'time', 'teen', 'Witherspoon', 'stabs', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'jagged', 'edged', 'piece', 'wood', 'leaving', 'gaping', 'hole', 'back', ""n't"", 'enough', 'animal', 'beheading', 'flick.This', 'exciting', 'involving', 'film', 'copycat', 'story', 'level', 'violence', 'work', 'value', 'art', 'lot', 'shock', 'value', 'keep', 'riveted', 'screen', 'become', 'increasingly', 'more', 'top', 'respect', 'reminded', '1979', 'opus', 'Fury', 'where', 'scenes', 'incredible', 'violence', 'punctuated', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'essentially', 'changed', 'value', 'film', 'Fear', 'too', 'throwback', '1970s', 'slasher', 'hate', 'filled', 'movies', 'same', 'horizontal', 'plane', 'be', 'teen', 'version', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'tension', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'actually', 'more', 'akin', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'violent', 'criminals', 'taking', 'place', 'Hills', 'flesh', 'eating', 'wackos', 'Meanwhile', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'psycho', 'none', 'artistry', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'displayed', 'original', 'remade', 'Cape', 'Fear', '.I', 'think', 'good', 'idea', 'show', 'fear', 'buying', 'bringing', 'home', 'have', 'children', 'age', '17', 'are', 'teen', 'and/or', 'want', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'excitement', 'violence', 'cup', 'tea']",N/A

When she tries to back off from the relationship, he decides to terrorize her family.The movie is formulaic and predictable, but it also has some pretty good scenes. Reese's character is a typical high school girl trying to assert her independence.  When her dad picks up on some disturbing signals The Boyfriend is sending out, he tries every trick in the book to discourage her from continuing to date the young man.  As every parent of teens knows, the best way to ensure that a relationship will become more committed is to DISAPPROVE of it, loudly and often. That's why, when your adolescent/young adult brings home a person who gives you the creeps, you play the role of supportive, loving parent totally enamored of the new interest, until your kid (hopefully) comes to his or her senses.Anyway. You just know bad things will happen, and they do.It is interesting that religion is only ever mentioned in movies if religion is central to the story (ie, ""Sound of Music"" and ""Black Narcissus"") or if it's a negative trait--another red flag that the religious person is a nutcase. In this film, there is absolutely no evidence of anyone having any sort of faith life, until we see the inside of The Boyfriend's room. He has a crucifix prominently displayed, and there are a few other religious items. This did not add to the story, except to underscore the fact that this character was a loon.

That's when things go ""psycho""...David quickly begins to sport the crazy-serious-insane-obssessed face whenever any other guy goes near Nicole or when her father tries to keep them apart.

In a whole mess of unbelievable trouble that will leave the moviewatcher saying ""hello?  this would never happen!"" while watching the movie through their hands.All in all, not a terrible flick.

(And that scene on the roller coaster, I don't care who you are it's not happening that way.)Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a sweet faced 16 year old freshly transported from Seattle to live with her father and step mother.  Still somewhat neive and overly friendly with all she meets, she meets a handsome stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg).  At first all seems well, as he wins over her parents and they are enjoying the bloom of new love.  But David has a dark side, whose jealous nature emerges slowly but surely.  Eventually he shows that he doesn't just have a dark side, but is outright dangerous.  Lies about the past, violence, and the inevitable ending in a blaze of glory violence take place.This is a movie all girls should watch, it teaches us all about the bad boys.  A part of us is drawn to the bad boy, whose dangerous and somewhat psychotic side appeals to girls.  Why?  Because we girls want to be bad ourselves and we are trying to live it through the bad boy.  Reese Whiterspoon's friend played by Alyssa Milano is the more obvious example.  She picks up the ugliest, greasiest man in the room, praces around in her hootchie mama outfits because he wants her to, and allows herself to be used and abused until it's too late.  Fortunately for Reese, her sexuality is kept under under more modest wraps.Of course, we must learn these lessons by doing no matter what your friends, family or even the movies can tell you.  Eventually we can see through these thin venirs and get past it.  If you want to be a bad girl, be one on your own time.  The bad boys of this world are lots of fun, most are tornados in the sack, but cheat left and right, wrap chairs around heads, and will call and ask for bail money.

Fear managed to be the worst movie I saw this weekend, and that's saying something.The story: boy (Mark Wahlberg) meets girl (Reese Witherspoon). Boy loses girl. Boy goes into obsessive stalker rampage. Girl's father (William Petersen, now immortalized in CSI) gets suspicious. Things get ugly.That's all? You ask. Well, when it's done right, it's great stuff. The problem is, it's not done right here. Nothing about this movie, in fact, except the casting and the soundtrack, was done right. Wahlberg was still a few years away from growing into himself as an actor, and instead of coming across as creepy stalker boy, he comes across as an insecure kid trying to play creepy stalker boy. (If that was intentional, it goes entirely against the grain of the environment in which Wahlberg's character lives.) The family couldn't be less familial if they tried; there's no chemistry, either positive or negative, between these characters. Come to think of it, this is more of a problem with the Witherspoon/Wahlberg relationship, which never once plays as true. Alyssa Milano has a brief spark of light as Witherspoon's nave best friend, but she doesn't get enough screen time to make anything of it.About the only two reasons to rent this movie are if the soundtrack is enough to make you sit through the rest of it, and to hear William Petersen curse.

I was afraid to commit to it since it seemed like a CRUSH rip-off and I didn't want it to outstand my beloved favorite movie. It didn't. But, it's still a creepy little thriller about obsession, love and murder.Meet Nicole Walker. A 16 year old girl with sex on her mind. Her father just married a woman and has a new stepbrother. Her girlfriend Margo Masse and her friend Gary decide one day, to be late for school and to go get some food at a gritty coffee shop. Nicole glances at David but doesn't really meet him until a party later that night. When the party becomes a riot, Nicole escapes with David to sit around and talk. It's love at first sight.One night, Nicole tells David that she's ready to have sex. He says he's with some friends and has to do something. She tells him it's alright and to come over after and she tells him the code to the front door. Well, David comes in and they have sex. A day later or so, David goes to Nicole's school to pick her up, he see's Gary hug her. Not good in David's eyes. He goes over and beats the crap out of Gary and in the process, hits Nicole in the face, giving her a black eye.Nicole's father is more than pissed. David seems to give him the creeps. When he confronts David, David says ""You know, Mr. Walker-you really aren't a f***ot."" Mr. Walker tells David to stay away from Nicole. After Mr. Walker leaves, David starts hitting himself in the chest. He tells Nicole that her father hit him. So she runs off with David, feeling sorry for him. He asks her if she wants to go to a party when he brings her back to her house. She tells him no. But after a few seconds, when he leaves, she decides to drive over herself. She goes there, and looks in a window to see Margo being abused and about to be raped by her ""true love"" David.She now discovers David's true dark side. She won't talk to him so he ""attacks"" her in a bathroom at the mall. Mr. Walker's red car gets smashed up with a note on the broken window saying ""Now I've poped both your ........!""....Mr. Walker finds out where David and his gang lives and ruins the place. When the group finds the place in ruins, David knows exactly who it is. And by their law ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a ...... tooth"" they decide to pay the Walker family a little visit...What worked in this movie was the psychotic attitude of David. He's a soid good actor and a damn good liar. You know he's bad but you really like him. He seems perfect. You try to like him after his accidently hitting Nicole but it becomes harder and harder.RECCOMENDED TO FANS OF:Fatal Attraction (1987)The Crush (1993)The Stepfather (1987)CASTMark Wahlberg...........David McCallReese Witherspoon....Nicole WalkerWilliam L.

But the lack of originality doesn't take away from the interesting progression of the movie. Directing, editing, writing and acting are still top notch. And, even though Wahlberg's character ends up going off the deep end, he portrays a believable 'normal' guy in the beginning, even providing an intense roller coaster service early in the movie.

Dubbed as the ""Fatal Attraction for teens"" by its own executive producer Brian Grazer, ""Fear"" follows the pattern of excitement and danger in one volatile package named David McCall, the obsessive boyfriend that is the centerpiece of this sophomoric thriller.  David's hapless victim and love interest is a high-school beauty named Nicole Walker (Witherspoon), a precocious but somewhat nave lass dealing with the typical teen angst and the added friction of her father's marriage to a younger woman (Brenneman).  Cutting class one day with Margo Masse (Milano) and Gary Rohmer (Caldecott), Nicole and friends pop into a local sports bar for some brief recreation.  While liberally puffing a cig, Margo ogles a group of men at a nearby pool table, marveling in particular at the grungiest guy of the group.  While Nicole disagrees with Margo's taste in men, she spots someone more of her own flavor, a handsome and brawny rogue that unwaveringly meets her lustful eye.  The moment is brief and they are gone within minutes, but Nicole bumps into him again that very evening at a raucous rave on the pier.  Their eyes meet again on the dance floor, bathed in neon lights and sandwiched by boisterous partygoers dancing to industrial rock.  Before you can say riot, they are running to the roof and away from police choppers crashing the hedonistic soiree.As they retreat to a quiet spot overlooking the Seattle skyline, we find out that this seemingly polite and handsome fellow is David McCall, a wolf in sheep's skin.  David is skilled at his romantic ruse and soon worms his way into the hearts of Nicole's family, all except for one - Steven Walker, Nicole's protective papa.  There's no fooling this father and Steven knows better than anyone that David is an outright fraud.  Of course, Nicole's rebelliousness is what creates the melodrama and suspense of this teen thriller, and she defies her father repeatedly to great effect.  She falls in love and even after watching one of her friends being beaten to a pulp by David over a platonic embrace, she continues to see him and only fuels his burgeoning obsession.  As you can imagine, the relationship gets ugly real quick and has a definitive effect on Nicole's family and friends. People who lust for psychopathic scares will enjoy a particular scene where Wahlberg crudely scrawls ""Nicole 4 Eva"" on his chest with a blunt razor. Ouch!  Love hurts, ne c'est pas?Bad-boy David is former rapper and one-time Calvin Klein underwear model Mark Wahlberg, the first of many roles that he took to branch out into film, beginning with minor spots in TV and then a bit part in 1994's ""Renaissance Man"".  ""The Basketball Diaries"" followed a year later, but his frightening turn as a jilted playboy brought his name to the lips of screaming girls everywhere.  He would later blow critics away in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"", a film centered around the late 1970's porn industry.Reese Witherspoon had quite a resume before she was approached with ""Fear"", having made a name for herself back in 1991 in ""Man On The Moon"", a bittersweet coming-of-age drama. Playing a spunky Louisiana teen, she starred opposite Jason London and had her first on-screen kiss.  She's come a long way since then, having starred in successful vehicles such as ""Pleasantville"", ""Cruel Intentions"" and her Golden Globe-winning performance in 1999's ""Election"".  Although Reese is a splendid character actress, there's nothing for her to do here except play the victim and she does it modestly.  Other key players are TV stars William L. Petersen (CSI) as Witherspoon's wary papa and Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy) as Laura, Nicole's brash stepmother.""Fear"" may be a cheap substitute for a well-devised thriller, but Wahlberg kicks it up a few notches to a respectable and reasonably enjoyable level.

61596,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,078322933X,the masked reviewer,"[0, 0]","When Fear slipped in and out of our collective consciousness in 1996 with all the impact of a school board election, the critics' near-unanimous cry of ""cheesy thriller"" was followed by the sound of the cineplex door hitting the picture on the butt as it made its way to oblivion.Well, yes, Fear is a cheesy thriller, and it's also formulaic, cliched, hysterical and even downright silly. But all of that misses the point. Unlike most formulaic, cliched, hysterical and silly movies, Fear has enough sex, swagger and thrills that you can still respect yourself in the morning after spending a lurid night with it.Like any charming piece of trash, Fear is best appreciated if you decide at the outset to give wholly in to it (a prospect which shouldn't, in and of itself, disturb anyone who thought Independence Day was a major work of motion picture art). Giving in to the movie isn't just a matter of accepting that it's a hokey cross of Fatal Attraction and The Wild One, though that is undeniably part of the fun. Nor is it just a matter of finding out whether underwear model Marky Mark Wahlberg can act (which he can, some). No, giving in to Fear is a question of embracing the unthinkable, of considering the possibility that a remake of Cape Fear with Wahlberg in the Robert De Niro role and William Petersen standing in for Nick Nolte might actually be an improvement. Seriously. In large measure, Fear is more satisfying than Cape Fear because Wahlberg is a more cuddly villain than De Niro and Petersen a less likable putz than Nolte.Where Nolte is dashing and able, Petersen is aptly wan as an architect whose career is accelerating a tad beyond his capacities, whose second marriage (to an innocuously cute Amy Brenneman) is crumbling, and whose teen daughter (Reese Witherspoon), the issue of marriage number one, is blooming sexually and increasingly eager to act on her new urges. Into this tenuous menage saunters Wahlberg, looking smashing as David McCall, a local hanger-out who's part altar boy and part psychotic. He literally seduces Witherspoon, and figuratively seduces her stepmom, her half brother and the family dog. Only Petersen, who understands David's predatory masculinity all too well, resists the guy's charms, and sets off a hair-raising rivalry, with Papa Bear trying to defend his little cub from the New Young Buck on the Block.Thankfully, Fear glides along with a big dumb grin on its face, utterly unaware that it's about any such thing as male domination, and therein lies its appeal. This same blissful ignorance also makes Fear a better bet on video than it was a theatrical film. Go to a theater and watch Wahlberg stalk a suburban family and you might start wondering if someone's dosed your Pepsi; watch a Wahlberg film on video and realize that it's actually about something, and you feel pretty good about lying around the house in your sweats on a Saturday night. Don't get me wrong, of course. In the end, as Fear winds its way from moderately engaging psychological thriller to ludicrously over-the-top siege movie, you'll find yourself, howsoever absorbed, grateful not to have spent ""E"" ticket prices for what is little more than a mental kiddy ride.The fact that Fear works as both pure cotton candy and intriguing horror show is attributable most of all to director James Foley, who's a frustrating talent as likely to produce pure crap (Who's That Girl?) or ponderous contrivance (Glengarry Glen Ross) as chilling drama (At Close Range) or compelling pulp (After Dark, My Sweet). This time, he's generally on the mark. He's got an appreciative, voyeuristic feel for teenagers (look at his 1984 directorial debut, Reckless, an archetypical young-teen-on-bike-gets-laid movie, for a similar pattern), and in Fear, Alyssa Milano is particularly piquant as Witherspoon's slutty best friend. But Foley's always been a guy's director with a knack for getting performances from young leading men: Sean Penn, Aidan Quinn and Jason Patric have all done solid work with him, and he gets some real moments out of Wahlberg (who has since stunned the world with further evidence of acting talent starting with BOOGIE NIGHTS and culminating in an Oscar nomination for THE DEPARTED. Go figure!)So, sure, give in to Fear for 90 minutes or so of cheap pleasure, but don't expect it to be anything more than what it looks like: a Mark Wahlberg movie. Which isn't so much to say that it sucks as to register surprise that there's as much good in it as there is.",5,Give Into 'FEAR',1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,4497,"['When', 'Fear', 'slipped', 'collective', 'consciousness', '1996', 'impact', 'school', 'board', 'election', 'critics', 'near-unanimous', 'cry', 'cheesy', 'thriller', 'was', 'followed', 'sound', 'cineplex', 'door', 'hitting', 'picture', 'butt', 'made', 'way', 'oblivion.Well', 'yes', 'Fear', 'cheesy', 'thriller', 'also', 'formulaic', 'cliched', 'hysterical', 'even', 'downright', 'silly', 'point', 'most', 'formulaic', 'cliched', 'hysterical', 'silly', 'movies', 'Fear', 'enough', 'sex', 'swagger', 'thrills', 'can', 'still', 'respect', 'morning', 'spending', 'lurid', 'night', 'it.Like', 'charming', 'piece', 'trash', 'Fear', 'best', 'appreciated', 'decide', 'outset', 'give', 'wholly', 'prospect', 'should', ""n't"", 'disturb', 'anyone', 'who', 'thought', 'Independence', 'Day', 'was', 'major', 'work', 'motion', 'picture', 'art', 'Giving', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'matter', 'accepting', 'hokey', 'cross', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Wild', 'One', 'undeniably', 'part', 'fun', 'just', 'matter', 'finding', 'out', 'underwear', 'model', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'can', 'act', 'can', 'No', 'giving', 'Fear', 'question', 'embracing', 'unthinkable', 'considering', 'possibility', 'remake', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'Wahlberg', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'role', 'William', 'Petersen', 'standing', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'improvement', 'Seriously', 'large', 'measure', 'Fear', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'Wahlberg', 'more', 'cuddly', 'villain', 'De', 'Niro', 'Petersen', 'less', 'likable', 'putz', 'Nolte.Where', 'Nolte', 'dashing', 'able', 'Petersen', 'aptly', 'wan', 'architect', 'career', 'accelerating', 'tad', 'capacities', 'second', 'marriage', 'innocuously', 'cute', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'crumbling', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'issue', 'marriage', 'number', 'one', 'blooming', 'sexually', 'increasingly', 'eager', 'act', 'new', 'urges', 'tenuous', 'menage', 'saunters', 'Wahlberg', 'looking', 'smashing', 'David', 'McCall', 'local', 'hanger-out', 'who', 'part', 'altar', 'boy', 'part', 'psychotic', 'literally', 'Witherspoon', 'figuratively', 'stepmom', 'half', 'brother', 'family', 'dog', 'Only', 'Petersen', 'who', 'David', 'predatory', 'masculinity', 'too', 'well', 'guy', 'charms', 'off', 'hair-raising', 'rivalry', 'Papa', 'Bear', 'trying', 'defend', 'little', 'cub', 'New', 'Young', 'Buck', 'Block.Thankfully', 'Fear', 'big', 'dumb', 'grin', 'face', 'utterly', 'unaware', 'such', 'thing', 'male', 'domination', 'therein', 'appeal', 'same', 'blissful', 'ignorance', 'also', 'Fear', 'better', 'bet', 'video', 'was', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Go', 'theater', 'watch', 'Wahlberg', 'suburban', 'family', 'might', 'start', 'wondering', 'someone', 'dosed', 'Pepsi', 'watch', 'Wahlberg', 'film', 'video', 'realize', 'actually', 'something', 'feel', 'pretty', 'good', 'lying', 'house', 'sweats', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'course', 'end', 'Fear', 'way', 'moderately', 'engaging', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'ludicrously', 'over-the-top', 'siege', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'howsoever', 'absorbed', 'grateful', 'not', 'have', 'spent', 'E', 'ticket', 'prices', 'what', 'little', 'more', 'mental', 'kiddy', 'ride.The', 'fact', 'Fear', 'pure', 'cotton', 'candy', 'intriguing', 'horror', 'show', 'attributable', 'most', 'director', 'James', 'Foley', 'who', 'frustrating', 'talent', 'likely', 'produce', 'pure', 'crap', 'Who', 'Girl', 'ponderous', 'contrivance', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'chilling', 'drama', 'Close', 'Range', 'compelling', 'pulp', 'Dark', 'My', 'Sweet', 'time', 'generally', 'mark', 'got', 'appreciative', 'voyeuristic', 'feel', 'teenagers', 'look', '1984', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Reckless', 'archetypical', 'young-teen-on-bike-gets-laid', 'movie', 'similar', 'pattern', 'Fear', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'particularly', 'piquant', 'Witherspoon', 'slutty', 'best', 'friend', 'Foley', 'always', 'been', 'guy', 'director', 'knack', 'getting', 'performances', 'young', 'leading', 'men', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'have', 'done', 'solid', 'work', 'real', 'moments', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'stunned', 'world', 'further', 'evidence', 'acting', 'talent', 'starting', 'BOOGIE', 'NIGHTS', 'culminating', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'THE', 'DEPARTED', 'Go', 'figure', 'So', 'sure', 'give', 'Fear', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'cheap', 'pleasure', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'movie', 'Which', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'say', 'register', 'surprise', 'as', 'much', 'good']",N/A

I can pretty much tell what is going to happen with movies. I couldn't tell a thing in this movie. This is not just your  run of the mill teen hororr/suspence/thiller/Mystery type of movie. This movie is a great movie to enjoy and a great life-lesson  (or moral, if you will) wihout actually living it. I won't tell what the lesson is, but Reese Witherspoon is generally in movies that teach something at the end, so be sure to look for it at the end and during this film.  This movie is so great in every way possible. By far the best[for me] hororr film of them all! Great movie!!! Very similar to ""Fatal Attraction"" But, geared towards a teen auidence. Both films are great, but also both have cerin material that DIDN'T have to be in there. VERY realsitic, in the sense that there are teens who choose to...ummm...well spend ""quality"" time with each other, and do live to regret that ""quality"" time spent. Alot of the time, that person that you spent the time with, ISN'T the person you thought they were. Very creepy. ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Fear"" are similar, and different at the same time.
