Two women that fight for the change of the treatment of children. One episode that really caught my eye was the one a young boy accidentally shoots and kills his younger sister only meaning to scare them he did not know that the gun he had still had bullets in it. When the boy was being sentenced it was the reaction of the boy and the ADA when he said it not enough, the was finally stopped the court officer and finally showed remorse ""I shot my sister!"" and Amy asked ""Did you know that the gun was loaded?""  and was the best episode. During that time Amy older brother is having his adopted son christening and the wrestling with their problems their adoptive mother.

Like ""Providence"" and some other long-awaited shows that have yet to debut on DVD, we don't even get re-runs anymore!  There must be some studio hang-up like lack of profit that keeps these shows off the shelves.  Everyone waited long enough for the first season of ""Becker"" to show up on DVD, so maybe there's hope.  But there are very few ""dramas"" tailored for women anymore and there's nothing out there now I would feel comfortable watching with my 14-year-old daughter.  [Gray's Anatomy, too much sex.  CSI, too much violence.  Pushing Daisies, too macabre.]  ""Judging Amy"" wasn't intended to give ""Law & Order"" or ""Boston Legal"" a run for their money.  It was a nice, simple women's drama that didn't care about winning the Lifetime victim of the week award.  The talks between Amy and Maxine held some of the best dialog ever written for women.

She and Lauren move back into the the family home where she once again has to learn to negotiate with her bossy, self opinionated mother, the magnificent Maxine (Tyne Daly),her gentle younger brother Vincent (Dan Futterman) and reconnect with older brother Peter(Marcus Giamatti)who runs the family business,an insurance agency originally belonging to their late father, and his dippy high strung wife Gillian (Jessica Tuck).The interesting saga about Amy and Maxine, in particular, is that they are both deeply caring human beings, whose working lives are dedicated to making the lives of others (mostly children in both cases) a more hopeful and positive experience than it otherwise would have been. And both are very good at what they do. Maxine is regarded with some awe by her co-workers in the Dept of Corrections, and Amy gradually developes into a fine Children's Court Judge.Yet it is in their private lives that overall turmoil threatens to unravel them, because despite coming from a close-knit family environment all three of Maxine's children find that negotiating long term successful partnerships seems to be beyond them.Judging Amy doesn't allow itself to become melodramatic, and there is never a likelihood of the viewer over dosing on sacharine. The scripts are strong, the acting first rate, the storyline never feels it's losing it's edge (an achievement of no mean feat over six series) and flawed though the characters may be, this only adds to the sense of reality and and understanding we feel as we share in their tials and tribulations.Amy Brenneman deserves full marks for developing an idea she had to write a series about her mother,then produce and star in it.The casting of Tyne Daly, was a crucial part of Judging Amy's success as a series, and the performances of Richard T Jones as Bruce Van Exel, Tim Omundson as Sean (Maxine's boss) and Jillian Armenante as Amy's court clerk Donna,were consistently outstanding.Now bring on the DVD Boxed Set.",5,"Judging Amy, A Rare Television Jewell.",1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2478,"['Judging', 'Amy', 'caught', 'eye', 'years', 'ago', 'originally', 'presence', 'great', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'actor', 'awesome', 'range', 'more', 'capable', 'keeping', 'entranced', 'week', 'week', 'was', 'proved', 'Cagney', 'Lacey', 'numerous', 'films', 'now', 'course', 'social', 'worker', 'andwidowed', 'mother', 'three', 'grown', 'up', 'spring', 'one', 'whom', 'Amy', 'played', 'so', 'realistically', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'childrens', 'court', 'judge', 'chip', 'old', 'block.Amy', 'divorced', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Lauren', 'Lauren', 'move', 'back', 'family', 'home', 'where', 'once', 'again', 'learn', 'negotiate', 'bossy', 'opinionated', 'mother', 'magnificent', 'Maxine', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'gentle', 'younger', 'brother', 'Vincent', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'reconnect', 'older', 'brother', 'Peter', 'Marcus', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'family', 'business', 'insurance', 'agency', 'originally', 'belonging', 'late', 'father', 'dippy', 'high', 'strung', 'wife', 'Gillian', 'Jessica', 'Tuck', '.The', 'interesting', 'saga', 'Amy', 'Maxine', 'particular', 'are', 'deeply', 'caring', 'human', 'beings', 'working', 'lives', 'are', 'dedicated', 'making', 'lives', 'others', 'mostly', 'children', 'cases', 'more', 'hopeful', 'positive', 'experience', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'Maxine', 'regarded', 'awe', 'co-workers', 'Dept', 'Corrections', 'Amy', 'gradually', 'fine', 'Children', 'Court', 'Judge.Yet', 'private', 'lives', 'overall', 'turmoil', 'threatens', 'unravel', 'coming', 'close-knit', 'family', 'environment', 'three', 'Maxine', 'children', 'find', 'negotiating', 'long', 'term', 'successful', 'partnerships', 'be', 'them.Judging', 'Amy', ""n't"", 'allow', 'become', 'melodramatic', 'never', 'likelihood', 'viewer', 'dosing', 'sacharine', 'scripts', 'are', 'strong', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'storyline', 'never', 'losing', 'edge', 'achievement', 'mean', 'feat', 'six', 'series', 'flawed', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'sense', 'reality', 'understanding', 'feel', 'share', 'tials', 'tribulations.Amy', 'Brenneman', 'full', 'marks', 'developing', 'idea', 'had', 'write', 'series', 'mother', 'then', 'produce', 'star', 'it.The', 'casting', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'was', 'crucial', 'part', 'Judging', 'Amy', 'success', 'series', 'performances', 'Richard', 'T', 'Jones', 'Bruce', 'Van', 'Exel', 'Tim', 'Omundson', 'Sean', 'Maxine', 'boss', 'Jillian', 'Armenante', 'Amy', 'court', 'clerk', 'Donna', 'were', 'consistently', 'outstanding.Now', 'bring', 'DVD', 'Boxed', 'Set']",Judging Amy: Season 1
