Veggietales is one of the greatest shows around for kids and this DVD in specific is a nice one to add to the collection. The episodes always have a point or lesson to learn and this DVD includes lessons in a very fun way to learn them.",5,Classic!,1319068800,"10 20, 2011",2011,284,"['When', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'show', 'watch', 'Veggietales', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'kids', 'DVD', 'specific', 'nice', 'one', 'add', 'collection', 'episodes', 'always', 'have', 'point', 'lesson', 'learn', 'DVD', 'lessons', 'very', 'fun', 'way', 'learn']",N/A

And to be honest, I love this series alot more as a teenager than when I was younger. Yeah, weird, huh?Anyways, to the review...This episode is about loving your neighbor. It first starts out with a re-telling of the Good Samaritan story in a ryhmning fashion. Then you have Larry's 'silly songs' segment, this one is called ""The Hairbrush Song""Then you have the main feature, 'The Gourds Must Be Crazy'It's a really good story about being a friend to those who are different because God made all of us special and different from each other.The only disappointment I had is the DVD was too short!It was rather enjoyable, but I wish I saw Junior on the USS Applepies alot longer than that. It would of been a pretty good space adventure. Junior is my favorite character out of all the vegetables ^_^Still, I totally recommend this DVD! It's a good story and a good lesson!",4,Junior in space!,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,921,"['was', 'really', 'little', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'started', 'be', 'honest', 'love', 'series', 'alot', 'more', 'teenager', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Yeah', 'weird', 'huh', 'Anyways', 'review', 'episode', 'loving', 'neighbor', 'first', 'out', 're-telling', 'Good', 'Samaritan', 'story', 'ryhmning', 'fashion', 'Then', 'have', 'Larry', ""'silly"", 'songs', 'segment', 'one', 'called', 'Hairbrush', 'Song', 'Then', 'have', 'main', 'feature', 'Gourds', 'Must', 'Be', ""Crazy'It"", 'really', 'good', 'story', 'being', 'friend', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'God', 'made', 'special', 'different', 'other.The', 'only', 'disappointment', 'had', 'DVD', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'was', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'wish', 'saw', 'Junior', 'USS', 'Applepies', 'alot', 'longer', 'would', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'space', 'adventure', 'Junior', 'favorite', 'character', 'vegetables', '^_^Still', 'totally', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'lesson']",N/A
