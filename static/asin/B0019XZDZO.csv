1164978,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0019XZDZO,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[11, 13]","I have to get something off my chest:  `Smart People' is an acquired taste.  If you like indie films that contain absorbing characters and dysfunctional families, then you're going to get into this one.  For me I've gone into a lot of intelligent films in the last year and often found something missing.  Not entirely different than `Margot at the Wedding,' 'Two Days in Paris,' and `Year of the Dog,' the film's deliberations have enough flair to capture my interest.  While the other films were clever, I have to admit, I personally didn't love them.  Don't expect `Smart People' to be the next `Little Miss Sunshine' or `The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)' but its quirkiness can reel one in from the onset.Dennis Quaid stars as pedantic curmudgeon Dr. Lawrence Wetherhold, a straightforward professor at Carnegie Mellon who has difficulty remembering students' names, but has no trouble mincing words about their papers.  On campus his son, Jim (Ashton Holmes) shows that even in close proximity to his father, the emotional distance between them is staggering.  In an odd role reversal dad only visit's the dorm when he wants something from him.At home daughter, Vanessa (Ellen Page) is a type-A personality student; she's gung ho to get A's and is preparing for her ACT exams with a vengeance.  A Republican zealot, her character is as sassy as Juno with none of the exuberant lilt. Uptight like her father, she also seldom minces words, but her delivery is deadly blunt and seldom funny. Plenty of opportunities for undercutting humor are given voice through her character.That leaves us with the plot.  When Wetherhold leaves his car illegally parked on campus, it gets towed.  When he retrieves it from impounding, he discovers he's not going to get preferential treatment, so he climbs a fence with barbed wire to get his car and briefcase for free.  Without succeeding he collapses on the pavement and is sent to Allegheny General.  At the hospital, he is treated by Dr. Janet Hartigan (Sarah Jessica Parker), a former student, who informs him he's had a seizure and his headstrong appeal to leave and drive will not take effect when her required report to the DMV restricts him from driving for six months.  Vanessa, who is in the thick of exams, doesn't like losing beauty sleep visiting her father in the hospital.But Larry's long lost adopted brother, Chuck (Thomas Hayden-Church), an infrequent visitor with a history of borrowing money, now offers to be his paid chauffeur.  He's a lousy driver to begin with, but Wetherhold doesn't have many choices.  Larry especially needs him to shuttle him to see Janet, with whom he's grown smitten, despite the fact she needs to forgive the memory of ""the same pompous windbag that made me change majors from English to biology.""Mixing like oil and water, Chuck tries to get officious and sometimes vicious Vanessa to lighten up and enjoy life.  Meanwhile, Dr. Janet takes some risks and tries to soften her old professor as he's set in his long-winded, unromantic ways.  Mutually beneficial, Vanessa tries to get her father to become head of the English department, so he can afford to send her to Stanford.  Brother Jim tries to fit in a life all his own.Sometimes relying too much on heavy sarcasm, the humor isn't always laugh-out-loud funny, but the casting certainly isn't amiss.  I like the way the movie undercuts the arrogance of people with intelligence misplaced.  Maybe everything doesn't coalesce in the film just like in real life, but in many ways the movie's cohesiveness keeps it consistent.A J.P.'s Tossup, Er...Heads:  2.5 *'s  Fair.  I liked it despite its weaknesses.  Sometimes it's not funny and happy to be that way, but I was drawn in by the characters.For fans of intelligent indie movies with quirky characters and smart dialogue,  this is a B- version of 'The Royal Tenenbaums (The Criterion Collection)' and highly recommended for you.",3,Intelligent People Behaving Stupidly,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3929,"['have', 'get', 'something', 'chest', 'Smart', 'People', 'acquired', 'taste', 'like', 'indie', 'films', 'contain', 'absorbing', 'characters', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'one', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'lot', 'intelligent', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'often', 'found', 'something', 'missing', 'Not', 'entirely', 'different', 'Margot', 'Wedding', ""'Two"", 'Days', 'Paris', 'Year', 'Dog', 'film', 'deliberations', 'have', 'enough', 'flair', 'capture', 'interest', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'clever', 'have', 'admit', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Smart', 'People', 'be', 'next', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'Special', 'Edition', 'quirkiness', 'can', 'reel', 'one', 'onset.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'pedantic', 'curmudgeon', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Wetherhold', 'straightforward', 'professor', 'Carnegie', 'Mellon', 'who', 'difficulty', 'remembering', 'students', 'names', 'trouble', 'mincing', 'words', 'papers', 'campus', 'son', 'Jim', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'even', 'close', 'proximity', 'father', 'emotional', 'distance', 'staggering', 'odd', 'role', 'reversal', 'only', 'visit', 'dorm', 'when', 'something', 'him.At', 'home', 'daughter', 'Vanessa', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'type-A', 'personality', 'student', 'gung', 'ho', 'get', 'A', 'preparing', 'ACT', 'exams', 'vengeance', 'Republican', 'zealot', 'character', 'as', 'sassy', 'Juno', 'none', 'exuberant', 'lilt', 'Uptight', 'father', 'also', 'seldom', 'minces', 'words', 'delivery', 'deadly', 'blunt', 'seldom', 'funny', 'Plenty', 'opportunities', 'undercutting', 'humor', 'are', 'given', 'voice', 'character.That', 'plot', 'When', 'Wetherhold', 'car', 'illegally', 'parked', 'campus', 'towed', 'When', 'impounding', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'fence', 'barbed', 'wire', 'get', 'car', 'briefcase', 'free', 'succeeding', 'pavement', 'sent', 'Allegheny', 'General', 'hospital', 'treated', 'Dr.', 'Janet', 'Hartigan', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'former', 'student', 'who', 'had', 'seizure', 'headstrong', 'appeal', 'leave', 'drive', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'effect', 'when', 'required', 'report', 'DMV', 'driving', 'six', 'months', 'Vanessa', 'who', 'thick', 'exams', ""n't"", 'like', 'losing', 'beauty', 'sleep', 'visiting', 'father', 'hospital.But', 'Larry', 'long', 'lost', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Chuck', 'Thomas', 'Hayden-Church', 'infrequent', 'visitor', 'history', 'borrowing', 'money', 'now', 'be', 'paid', 'chauffeur', 'lousy', 'driver', 'begin', 'Wetherhold', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'choices', 'Larry', 'especially', 'shuttle', 'see', 'Janet', 'whom', 'grown', 'smitten', 'fact', 'forgive', 'memory', 'same', 'pompous', 'windbag', 'made', 'change', 'majors', 'English', 'biology', 'Mixing', 'oil', 'water', 'Chuck', 'get', 'officious', 'sometimes', 'vicious', 'Vanessa', 'lighten', 'up', 'enjoy', 'life', 'Meanwhile', 'Dr.', 'Janet', 'risks', 'tries', 'soften', 'old', 'professor', 'set', 'long-winded', 'unromantic', 'ways', 'Mutually', 'beneficial', 'Vanessa', 'get', 'father', 'become', 'head', 'English', 'department', 'can', 'afford', 'send', 'Stanford', 'Brother', 'Jim', 'fit', 'life', 'own.Sometimes', 'relying', 'too', 'much', 'heavy', 'sarcasm', 'humor', ""n't"", 'always', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'casting', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'amiss', 'way', 'movie', 'arrogance', 'people', 'intelligence', 'misplaced', 'Maybe', 'everything', ""n't"", 'coalesce', 'film', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'cohesiveness', 'J.P.', 'Tossup', 'Er', '2.5', '*', 'Fair', 'liked', 'weaknesses', 'not', 'funny', 'happy', 'be', 'way', 'was', 'drawn', 'characters.For', 'fans', 'intelligent', 'indie', 'movies', 'quirky', 'characters', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'B-', 'version', ""'The"", 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'highly', 'recommended']",Smart People

1164982,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0019XZDZO,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","'Smart People' was an enjoyable enough movie that excelled only when Thomas Haden Church appeared on the screen.  He's a brilliant comedic actor capable of stealing scenes without seeming to try too hard.  In this film, he's perfected a look - sort of a wild-eyed daze fronting, we find out, a well-concealed, sly intelligence and sense of caring.  Haden Church's years of perfecting his chops on well-written sitcoms pay off here.The other actors, not so much.  Dennis Quaid seems a very likable guy, so it's hard swallowing him as a movie's prototypical misanthropic professor.  Sarah Jessica Parker?  My wife and I chuckled throughout with the idea of Carrie Bradshaw as a doctor.  And, since this movie was filmed prior to the release ofJuno (Single-Disc Edition), Ellen Page seems underused.

Instead, I reached the end of the movie going 'hmm.'  Although ""Smart People"" has lots of smart writing and is occasionally funny, it lacks the spark in interaction between the characters that is necessary to create a really great film in this genre.""Smart People"" centers around the life of Lawrence Wetherhold (Quaid) who is an English Professor at Carnegie Mellon.  Wetherhold acts like he can barely tolerate the rest of humanity, even though he cares for his two teenage children and his adopted brother.  After a freak accident, he encounters Janet Hartigan (Parker), a former student who is now a doctor.  The two begin dating, and Parker serves as the catalyst for change--eventually for the better--in Wetherhold's life.Except the problem is the viewer doesn't see enough of the Wetherhold-Hartigan relationship to see exactly why she changes him.  And why she's really interested in him at all, since he is arrogant and condescending towards her. This movie could have used a lot more interaction between these two characters, and a lot less between Wetherhold and his daughter--although in the absence of a compelling relationship between the two leads, the daughter (Ellen Page) does supply much of the entertainment in the movie.  To succeed, these movies need to develop strong relationships between characters, and ""Smart People"" lacks those relationships.  The seeds are there, but without full development, this movie is lacking something.I would recommend ""Smart People"" to people who like dysfunctional family dramas, but I would warn them that it's not as good as movies like ""Little Miss Sunshine"".",3,"People, yes.

1164987,A28HB1CS21SRDU,B0019XZDZO,canopy,"[1, 1]","Smart People is a movie about smart people making not so smart life choices.  In terms of plot, it doesn't have too much going on.  It definitely lacks the conventional structure of a clear beginning leading to a climax and then a resolution.  Not to say that structure makes a good film but this film definitely has the absence of structure.Plot:  There is a *smart* but arrogant professor who is guarded and socially inept.  And he lives with his equally guarded and arrogant daughter and a less arrogant son.  He also has an adopted brother in his life who is the complete opposite of him in every way.  Although this brother annoys the crap out of him, he also challenges him and his family with his opposite-ness.  Amidst all of that he falls in love with a beautiful *smart* doctor and learns to be less guarded and arrogant.The movie does move slowly.  This movie is definitely not meant to be your average feel-good type of movie.

I'd say it is a breath of fresh air from all that commercial, sappy movies that suffocate us everyday.  It is a good film.  But not a great film so I give it three stars.Just a note about the casting - I was very satisfied with the whole cast actually.  The casting director did a superb job in casting the right people who brought the right quality to each character.  And I must comment on Ellen Page and her role.  Many reviewers seem to be critical of her because this role was so similar to her character in Juno - but I think it was great that she was casted *because* this character was so similar to Juno.  What Ellen Page brings to this character is the perfect fit and, in a movie, that counts more than whether an actress decides to stretch herself or not.  As an audience, I'm more concerned about the quality of the character not 'who' plays it.

1164988,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B0019XZDZO,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[10, 11]","Smart People is a great dramedy--a mixture of comedy and drama. It goes for the Smart Laugh, not the Big Laugh. Mark Poirier, the son of a MIT professor, wrote a Smart script, and Smart Director Noam Murro very smartly cast some of the smartest actors around: Ellen Page, Thomas Haden Church, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Dennis Quaid. I loved it, because I am also very Smart, but it didn't do as well at the box office or with the critics (except it was the Number One DVD at Netflix for a while) as it deserved. That Smarts.I think the problem with this movie is that like the characters, Lawrence Wetherhold (Dennis Quaid) and his daughter Vanessa Wetherhold (Ellen Page), it doesn't suffer fools gladly. Thus, for a large portion of the audience, it is over their heads, and they feel like it is condescending, supercilious, and they feel patronized. As Lawrence's adopted brother, Chuck Wetherhold (Thomas Haden Church) says of Vanessa: ""You're a monster!""And that is an understatement. In another scene she says to her father, ""Theresa Sternbridge practically runs a soup kitchen and she's always seen posing in photos with crack babies and dying, old, crusty ladies. And do you know why? She scored in the 45th percentile on her SAT. People like you and me don't need to compensate.""Although Chuck sees that Vanessa, and her role model father, are both monsters, in spite or because of their intelligence, he still loves them and tries to help. Did I mention that Chuck is a screw up, down on his luck, and an opportunist who sees a win/win situation for himself when his brother has a seizure and cannot drive. He will have a place to stay, and 3 squares, for driving his brother around--albeit very unreliably.Though he is not the greatest driver, he really has a lot of intelligence about people. For instance, at a Christmas Dinner, where Vanessa's brother James Wetherhold (Ashton Holmes) complains about the rubbery ham (Vanessa used a recipe downloaded from the Internet written in the archaic French of Louis the XIV, and translated by her, maybe not as well as she thinks (a great example of her over achiever approach to cooking); when former student and now doctor Janet Hartigan (Sarah Jessica Parker) drops in unexpectedly Chuck explains ""These children haven't been properly parented in many years. They're practically feral. That's why I was brought in. To keep them from killing each other.""All of the characters have a story arc, where they have an epiphany, and reach a greater awareness; but the Father/Daughter dynamic between the professor and his precocious progeny is perhaps the most complicated. He takes her for granted and is even less involved with his son James, while she idolizes him and emulates his self absorbed and condescending approach to other, less worthy, people.---------------------Lawrence Wetherhold: I don't think you're very happy Vanessa.Vanessa Wetherhold: Well, you're not happy. And you're my role model.=============================She tries to sabotage his relationship with Janet, but he is more than capable of sabotaging it all by himself. However, with a little help and coaching from brother Chuck, perhaps he will prevail after all.By the way, fabulous performance by Thomas Haden Church, comparable to his character and performance in Sideways. Chuck was one of my favorite characters.That Ellen Page really nailed her role goes without saying. Her only danger now is being forever typecast as the wise-beyond-her-years waif. What other young actress could convincingly play someone stressed out about getting a perfect SAT score?Sarah Jessica Parker was smart and sassy, yet she was also a bit damaged, and had a lesson to learn. Great scene when Janet first meets Chuck.Dennis Quaid wore a fat suit and had a shuffling walk, like he had something stuffed up inside him. He looked very different than previous roles, and created a quite convincing persona. He really conveyed his utter disregard for those below him on the bell curve of intelligence. He was very annoying, as his role called for that, but gradually, perhaps, he would come around. One sub plot was about him getting a book published, and as you could imagine by the dry academic title, there was little chance of that happening. But when he submitted it under a title suggested by his daughter Vanessa, YOU CAN'T READ!, it finally was accepted.---------------Bloomberg: I got to the third section where I noticed a certain marketable tone, the surly smarter-than-thou @$$#0[3 tone.===================================Their strategy was that it would be attacked on NPR and three weeks later he'd be interviewed defending it on Charlie Rose. Kind of like when you have a lemon, make lemonade.Last but not least, Ashton Holmes as James Wetherhold and Camille Mana as Missy Chin, one of Lawrence's students, were both good in their small but pivotal roles. James had good reason to stay away from the toxic environment he called home as much as possible, but when he was there, he made a quiet impact.This was the first big screen role for Camille Mana, but I recognized her from the UPN sitcom One on One where she played Lisa Sanchez. She is very smart, having graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in economics after only 6 semesters, and I predict great things for her.In Smart People she keeps popping up as the thorn in her professor's side, and if he wasn't so self absorbed, perhaps he would remember her name. She and James even hook up, and you almost wish the focus had been on them a bit more. However, they function as a reminder that other people have lives just as interesting if not more so than the self absorbed professor and his equally self absorbed daughter. When James gets a poem published in The New Yorker, Lawrence is surprised to learn that he writes poetry. Perhaps he should listen to what other people have to say once in a while.I really liked this film because I could relate to the Smart People, and how hard it is for them to be humble. Yes, I too have a reputation for not suffering fools gladly, but after years of isolation, I would suffer them more than gladly. Though I may have an extremely high IQ, there are many different kinds of intelligence, and I wish that I had a little more intelligence about people. Perhaps I can get a high score on an intelligence test, but sometimes I can be a complete idiot.OTHER NOTABLE ROLES OF SMART PEOPLE CAST MEMBERSSex and the City - The Movie (Special Edition)(2008) ....

1164989,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B0019XZDZO,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[2, 3]","This refreshing movie definitely has an ""indie"" feel to it. Lawrence (Dennis Quaid) is a widower who teaches literature at Carnegie Mellon University; he sleepwalks through life, still in a funk over the loss of his wife, and unable to connect to his 2 children or any of his students. Enter Lawrence's lazy but perceptive adopted brother Chuck (Thomas Haden Church); he moves in with Lawrence and his teenage daughter Vanessa (Ellen Page), and the changes begin to occur. Vanessa is as controlled and uptight as her father; Chuck does his best to unwind her...almost too successfully, as she begins to develop a crush on him. Meanwhile, Lawrence meets Janet, an ER doctor (beautifully underplayed by Sarah Jessica Parker) who begins to unravel him as well. There are no breathless on the edge of your seat scenes; but many subtle laughs (mainly from Thomas Haden Church, who steals the movie from the rest of the cast) and interesting characters that will stay with you well after the movie is over. It is interesting to see SJP in a role outside of her ""Sex and the City"" Carrie Bradshaw personna; gone is the over-the-top neurotic hijinks of that character; instead, we see a more refined and controlled character. Quaid gives an excellent performance as the lonely and lost widower; Ellen Page is perfectly cast as the conniving bitter daughter.The DVD contains a number of deleted scenes (interesting to watch, but not really central to the movie), bloopers (your typical gag reel), feature commentary by filmmaker Noam Murro and writer Mark Jude Poirier. There is a making of featurette as well that includes interviews with the cast as well as info how Carnegie Mellon was picked as the school used in this movie. 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, widescreen (2:35:1, enhanced for 16x9 television), and French & Spanish subtitles.

1164990,A3V5YEY65T37UL,B0019XZDZO,David Butler,"[3, 4]","One might expect Smart People to resemble Sideways, since both films share the same producer as well as star Thomas Haden Church, but it actually falls a bit short of its predecessor. While they do share a similar tone, a breakdown of Smart People reveals a lack of overall substance.  The casting is the film's strongest point, with Dennis Quaid as a self-righteous literary professor and widower, Ellen Page his overachieving outcast daughter, Church his laid-back underachieving adopted brother, and Sarah Jessica Parker his physician love interest.The actors give excellent performances to bring about a necessary overtone of loneliness among goal-oriented people.  Page and Church have the standout roles, she giving the signature style of melancholy wit audiences discovered in 2007's sleeper hit Juno, and he playing almost exactly the same well-meaning bum he did in Sideways.  This is not to say that either are playing to type, but simply making the most of audience expectations before the tides inevitably turn.  Anyone who saw Page in Hard Candy or Church in Tales From the Crypt: Demon Knight knows that each have quite a range.On the downside, the script isn't as funny as it could have been, relying less on well-placed jokes and more on assumed laughter at situations which have become standard fare.  The editing is also unsuccessful at masking what must have been deleted scenes, as there are a few quick moments which seem to appear without reason.  Lastly is the fact that the ending comes off as a bit hurried, the most obvious flaw of which many other otherwise well-made movies tend to suffer.Generally speaking however, Smart People is enjoyable.  It is moderately intellectual and moving, but the title should not be taken too literally.  This is not a tale of high society (thank God), but rather one of interesting people who collectively represent the climb toward happiness in the American experience.  In this critic's opinion, Sideways is a superior film, but this one is worthwhile strictly because the actors make it fun to watch their characters scuffle.",3,See It For The Acting,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,2089,"['One', 'might', 'expect', 'Smart', 'People', 'resemble', 'Sideways', 'films', 'share', 'same', 'producer', 'as', 'well', 'star', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'actually', 'bit', 'short', 'predecessor', 'do', 'share', 'similar', 'tone', 'breakdown', 'Smart', 'People', 'lack', 'overall', 'substance', 'casting', 'film', 'strongest', 'point', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'self-righteous', 'literary', 'professor', 'widower', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'overachieving', 'outcast', 'daughter', 'Church', 'laid-back', 'underachieving', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'physician', 'love', 'interest.The', 'actors', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'bring', 'about', 'necessary', 'overtone', 'loneliness', 'goal-oriented', 'people', 'Page', 'Church', 'have', 'standout', 'roles', 'giving', 'signature', 'style', 'melancholy', 'wit', 'audiences', 'discovered', '2007', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Juno', 'playing', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'well-meaning', 'bum', 'did', 'Sideways', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'playing', 'type', 'simply', 'making', 'most', 'audience', 'expectations', 'tides', 'inevitably', 'turn', 'Anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'Page', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'Church', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'Demon', 'Knight', 'have', 'range.On', 'downside', 'script', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'relying', 'less', 'well-placed', 'jokes', 'more', 'assumed', 'laughter', 'situations', 'have', 'become', 'standard', 'fare', 'editing', 'also', 'unsuccessful', 'masking', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'quick', 'moments', 'seem', 'appear', 'reason', 'Lastly', 'fact', 'ending', 'off', 'bit', 'hurried', 'most', 'obvious', 'flaw', 'many', 'other', 'otherwise', 'well-made', 'movies', 'tend', 'suffer.Generally', 'speaking', 'however', 'Smart', 'People', 'enjoyable', 'moderately', 'intellectual', 'moving', 'title', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'literally', 'not', 'tale', 'high', 'society', 'thank', 'God', 'rather', 'one', 'interesting', 'people', 'who', 'collectively', 'represent', 'climb', 'happiness', 'American', 'experience', 'critic', 'opinion', 'Sideways', 'superior', 'film', 'one', 'worthwhile', 'strictly', 'actors', 'make', 'watch', 'characters', 'scuffle']",Smart People

1164995,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B0019XZDZO,Dr. E,"[2, 5]","The Wetherhold family is still reeling from the death of its matriarch. The environment is simply toxic. Professor Wetherhold clings to his departed wife's clothes. And, his teenage daughter uncannily slides into Mom's role: making dinners with internet recipes, tending to the laundry, and conducting various other hausfrau duties. When Uncle Lawrence arrives to help/mooch, the hilarity (almost but not really) begins.As is customary with indie films, there is nothing tidy about this work. Most of the characters are deliberately detestable: Professor Wetherhold (Quaid) is a self-absorbed misanthrope, his teenage daughter (Page) may as well be his doppelganger, and love-interest Dr. Hartigan (Parker) is excruciatingly insular (and still obsessed with a ""C"" paper she received in the professor's Victorian Literature course). While well-played, this dynamic becomes deadly ... the film just stagnates.Now, the one redeeming feature of this work is Thomas Haden Church's portrayal of Uncle Lawrence. Though nothing could possibly make this film truly great, Church makes it bearable. (And I thought I'd hate him for eternity after his despicable role inSideways!) With stark honesty, Church revives our memories of ""that uncle"" ... the one with all the ""get rich quick"" ideas, the one needing a place to crash, the one who bought you beer when you were sixteen ... yeah, that guy. And, instead of playing a buffoon, Church brings the role depth. There is something vulnerable in his character. For all his flaws, he is by far the most human ... and it is he who begins to heal the ""brilliant family.""  (Ironic, I suppose).Much like doctors who detestER, I found myself made uncomfortable by the depiction of academia (which constitutes the bulk of the film). Yes, it really is all politics ... yes, jargon-laden garbage really does translate to serious promotions ... but the whining students were just painful. I guess every seat-filler thinks he/she is memorable ... I can assure you, most aren't. Why should Professor Wetherhold feel guilty for not remembering inconsequential people? Why should he regret making less-than-glowing comments on student-papers? It's his job. I guess I'm just too close to the subject to be objective, but it seems some overly sensitive English major (who once-upon-a-time received a ""hard-breaking"" ""C"") wrote this script.Be prepared for a slow-paced film with some flashes of genuine comedy ... but nothing that will alter your life ... nothing you will even care to discuss (in the faculty lounge) on Monday morning.",2,"""We Could Use Some Antivenin in Here"" ...",1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,2557,"['Wetherhold', 'family', 'still', 'reeling', 'death', 'matriarch', 'environment', 'simply', 'toxic', 'Professor', 'Wetherhold', 'clings', 'departed', 'wife', 'clothes', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'uncannily', 'Mom', 'role', 'making', 'dinners', 'internet', 'recipes', 'tending', 'laundry', 'conducting', 'various', 'other', 'hausfrau', 'duties', 'When', 'Uncle', 'Lawrence', 'help/mooch', 'hilarity', 'almost', 'not', 'really', 'begins.As', 'customary', 'indie', 'films', 'nothing', 'tidy', 'work', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'deliberately', 'detestable', 'Professor', 'Wetherhold', 'Quaid', 'self-absorbed', 'misanthrope', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Page', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'doppelganger', 'love-interest', 'Dr.', 'Hartigan', 'Parker', 'excruciatingly', 'insular', 'still', 'obsessed', 'C', 'paper', 'received', 'professor', 'Victorian', 'Literature', 'course', 'well-played', 'dynamic', 'deadly', 'film', 'just', 'stagnates.Now', 'one', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'work', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'portrayal', 'Uncle', 'Lawrence', 'nothing', 'could', 'possibly', 'make', 'film', 'truly', 'great', 'Church', 'bearable', 'thought', ""'d"", 'hate', 'eternity', 'despicable', 'role', 'inSideways', 'stark', 'honesty', 'Church', 'memories', 'uncle', 'one', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'ideas', 'one', 'needing', 'place', 'crash', 'one', 'who', 'bought', 'beer', 'when', 'were', 'sixteen', 'yeah', 'guy', 'instead', 'playing', 'buffoon', 'Church', 'role', 'depth', 'something', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'flaws', 'far', 'most', 'human', 'who', 'heal', 'brilliant', 'family', 'Ironic', 'suppose', '.Much', 'doctors', 'who', 'detestER', 'found', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'depiction', 'academia', 'bulk', 'film', 'Yes', 'really', 'politics', 'yes', 'jargon-laden', 'garbage', 'really', 'translate', 'serious', 'promotions', 'whining', 'students', 'were', 'just', 'painful', 'guess', 'seat-filler', 'thinks', 'he/she', 'memorable', 'can', 'assure', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'Why', 'should', 'Professor', 'Wetherhold', 'feel', 'guilty', 'not', 'remembering', 'inconsequential', 'people', 'Why', 'should', 'regret', 'making', 'less-than-glowing', 'comments', 'student-papers', 'job', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'close', 'subject', 'be', 'objective', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'English', 'major', 'who', 'once-upon-a-time', 'received', 'hard-breaking', 'C', 'wrote', 'script.Be', 'prepared', 'slow-paced', 'film', 'flashes', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'will', 'alter', 'life', 'nothing', 'will', 'even', 'care', 'discuss', 'faculty', 'lounge', 'Monday', 'morning']",Smart People
1164996,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0019XZDZO,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","I like the actors and much of the dialogue in this 2008 comedy, but for an indie film being marketed as the comically idiosyncratic successor toSidewaysandJuno, the storyline feels relatively conventional. In fact, as directed by first-timer Noah Murro, the film bears a stronger resemblance to Noah Baumbach'sThe Squid and the Whalein which a disheveled, detestable elitist alienates the world around him with his wounded pride and cynical misanthropy. This time, in Mark Jude Poirier's screenplay, he takes the guise of Lawrence Wetherhold, an English professor at Carnegie-Mellon too smug to nominate himself as department head and wallowing in rejection form publishers over his manuscript. Burnt out from academia and contemptuous of his curriculum in Victorian-era literature, he doesn't bother remembering the names of his returning students. He is also the widowed father of two teens, naturally a study in opposites - Vanessa, a devoted right-wing daughter who shares her father's scabrous surliness and James, a son with a more creative bent whom he summarily ignores.Life gets complicated when Wetherhold ignominiously attempts to scale a chain-link fence in a parking lot only to have a seizure which prevents him from being able to drive legally. Just as Wetherhold's ne'er-do-well, ""adopted"" brother Chuck shows up at his doorstep to ask for money, Chuck ends up becoming his estranged brother's driver. At the same time, Wetherhold's comely ER doctor Janet Hartigan treats him while harboring a crush she's had on the professor since she was his student a dozen years prior. The rest of the movie takes standard twists and turns, and the problem I was having after a promising introduction was how by-the-numbers the plot developments were, how jumps in the timeline really didn't register coherently, and how contrived some of the baseline premise was, for instance, why an accomplished physician would really expect her professor to remember her after so long and why she would keep the final paper he graded. Even the music soundtrack by Nuno Bettencourt doesn't resonate with any quirkiness.The cast is not to blame for the contrivances as they easily live up to the film's title. Along with Jeff Bridges, Dennis Quaid continues to be one of the more underrated actors around, and he gives a smart, lived-in performance completely devoid of vanity. It's terrific, reassuring work. Echoing some of Carrie Bradshaw's insecurities, Sarah Jessica Parker is in familiar territory as Janet, although she looks sallow and a mite mature for the part. However, she is perfectly adept at conveying her lonely character's emotional hesitancies without having to wear a pair of Manolo Blahniks. Unsurprisingly, the scene stealers are Thomas Haden Church and Ellen Page. As Chuck, Church virtually replays Jack from Alexander Payne'sSidewaysbut with a greater core of decency. He lends an unexpected gravitas to his later scenes when he realizes he can't live in his brother's house all the time. Page uses her acerbic persona to confident effect as Vanessa, even though her natural sauciness was better served as a pregnant teen than as a Young Republican accepted to Stanford. Ashton Holmes is given little to do as James, a closet poet, and unfortunately, the normally vivacious Christine Lahti is completely wasted in a fringe role as a college administrator.

Why did Carnegie Mellon conduct a national search for a department head? (Heads are always chosen from within departments.) How did James manage to get a poem published in the New Yorker?

It makes one wonder how a cadre of fine actors can accept roles in a film such as this.Dennis Quaid (surprisingly looking fat and old and worn out) is Lawrence Wetherhold, a widowed professor of literature at Carnegie Mellon  a frustrated academic writer and depressed blowhard who mistreats his students and has little control over his shaky family - SAT obsessed daughter Vanessa (Ellen Page) and smolderingly angry son (Ashton Holmes) and  'adopted brother', the hippy irresponsible Chuck (Thomas Haden Church) who mooches off Lawrence when times are down.

His ER doctor Janet (Sarah Jessica Parker) happens to be one of Lawrence's former 'ignored' students and still maintains a crush on the difficult-to-love Lawrence. When their professional relationship merges into a courtship, Janet must drive and tolerate the bore Lawrence has become.

And that's what I'm going to do.I didn't have high expectations from ""Smart People"", despite it having (at least) three really talented actors - Dennis Quaid, Thomas H. Church and Ellen Page (with due respect to Ms. Parker!). Picked it on a whim, seeing the names and had no idea what the movie was all about.Righaway, it hits you smack in the face - the bluntness and abruptness in the lives of the characters in the movie. They are living as if living itself is the means and the end, all the while searching for happiness the way they define it. They all have different connotations of the term, and they want to achieve their share of happiness, with the people around them, the people they care about, the people they love. The only problem is - they are about as expressive of their feelings as a rock.Prof. Lawrence Wetherhold is an English Lit. Professor at Carnegie-Mellon, and his daughter and son don't get along with him really well, even though they care about him immensely. In fact, even the students whom the Professor declares as failures in his subject, despise him, but at the same time, respect him for his knowledge. If only his people skills were as good as even a quarter of how good his grasp over the language was, he would be the favorite of all. But of course, he is of the firm belief he doesn't need to be anyone's favorite. Hence, his misanthropic behavior only keeps on increasing day by day, until, one fine day, he begins to live within himself, merely exsiting in the outside world, even when those near and around him see him going off on a one-way road to desolation. He couldn't care less - he is smarter than all the rest of them. That's enough for him.His behavior more-than-just rubs off on his daughter, played with amazing maturity by Ellen Page (of 'Juno' fame), who is fast growing up into a self-solitary-confinist, with no friends so to speak of, and whose only ambition in life is to crack the SAT and go to Stanford. Beyond that, all she can see is herself following in her father's footsteps, who, incidentally, is her ""role model"". She finds him disgusting, but at the same time, is utterly protective of him. So much so that she can't even stand when he begins dating an ex-student.In all this chaos, Thomas H. Church plays the adopted brother of Prof. Wetherhold, who gate-crashes one fine day, and begins to belong at home in the Wetherhold household.Things begin to get even more complicated, but the movie is directed with such believable charm that everything that happens, even though expected, is never cliche. The poignant struggle that arises when people simply refuse to understand each other, when even the slightest of efforts would have done wonders, is laid bare convincingly enough for anyone seeing the movie to introspect.Is this the kind of life we are living today, when making ourselves understaood is so difficult that we are content with making ourselves believe that (at least) we understand ourselves? Is communication proving so elusive in the race for happiness that we forget that to thorougly enjoy that happiness, we need to share it with someone?In my opinion, the biggest irony depicted in ""Smart People"" is that a professor of the English language finds it difficult to communicate with his daughter, his adopted brother, his girlfriend (to whom, btw, he is unable to explain what she is to him!), his colleagues, his students, and practically everyone he meets, and is well on his way to nowhere.A very intelligent movie, with subtle hints of a message, which has to be searched to be found; but once found, is worth the effort.",5,Brilliant & Refreshingly Blunt,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,3765,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'said', 'myself', 'one', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'review', 'instead', 'one', 'when', 'see', 'share', 'experience', 'what', ""'m"", 'going', 'do.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'Smart', 'People', 'having', 'least', 'three', 'really', 'talented', 'actors', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Thomas', 'H.', 'Church', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'due', 'respect', 'Ms', 'Parker', 'Picked', 'whim', 'seeing', 'names', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about.Righaway', 'smack', 'face', 'bluntness', 'abruptness', 'lives', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'living', 'living', 'means', 'end', 'while', 'searching', 'happiness', 'way', 'define', 'have', 'different', 'connotations', 'term', 'want', 'achieve', 'share', 'happiness', 'people', 'people', 'care', 'people', 'love', 'only', 'problem', 'are', 'expressive', 'feelings', 'rock.Prof', 'Lawrence', 'Wetherhold', 'English', 'Lit', 'Professor', 'Carnegie-Mellon', 'daughter', 'son', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'really', 'well', 'even', 'care', 'immensely', 'fact', 'even', 'students', 'whom', 'Professor', 'failures', 'subject', 'despise', 'same', 'time', 'respect', 'knowledge', 'only', 'people', 'skills', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'even', 'quarter', 'how', 'good', 'grasp', 'language', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'favorite', 'course', 'firm', 'belief', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'anyone', 'favorite', 'Hence', 'misanthropic', 'behavior', 'only', 'increasing', 'day', 'day', 'one', 'fine', 'day', 'live', 'merely', 'exsiting', 'outside', 'world', 'even', 'when', 'see', 'going', 'off', 'one-way', 'road', 'desolation', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'smarter', 'rest', 'enough', 'him.His', 'behavior', 'more-than-just', 'rubs', 'off', 'daughter', 'played', 'amazing', 'maturity', 'Ellen', 'Page', ""'Juno"", 'fame', 'who', 'fast', 'growing', 'up', 'self-solitary-confinist', 'friends', 'so', 'speak', 'only', 'ambition', 'life', 'crack', 'SAT', 'go', 'Stanford', 'Beyond', 'can', 'see', 'following', 'father', 'footsteps', 'who', 'incidentally', 'role', 'model', 'disgusting', 'same', 'time', 'utterly', 'protective', 'So', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'when', 'dating', 'ex-student.In', 'chaos', 'Thomas', 'H.', 'Church', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Prof.', 'Wetherhold', 'who', 'one', 'fine', 'day', 'belong', 'home', 'Wetherhold', 'household.Things', 'begin', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'movie', 'directed', 'such', 'believable', 'charm', 'everything', 'even', 'expected', 'never', 'cliche', 'poignant', 'struggle', 'when', 'people', 'simply', 'refuse', 'understand', 'other', 'when', 'even', 'slightest', 'efforts', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'wonders', 'laid', 'bare', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'movie', 'introspect.Is', 'kind', 'life', 'are', 'living', 'today', 'when', 'making', 'understaood', 'so', 'difficult', 'are', 'content', 'making', 'believe', 'least', 'understand', 'communication', 'proving', 'so', 'elusive', 'race', 'happiness', 'forget', 'thorougly', 'enjoy', 'happiness', 'need', 'share', 'someone', 'opinion', 'biggest', 'irony', 'depicted', 'Smart', 'People', 'professor', 'English', 'language', 'difficult', 'communicate', 'daughter', 'adopted', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'btw', 'unable', 'explain', 'what', 'colleagues', 'students', 'practically', 'everyone', 'well', 'way', 'nowhere.A', 'very', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'subtle', 'hints', 'message', 'be', 'searched', 'be', 'found', 'once', 'found', 'effort']",Smart People

1165004,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0019XZDZO,Hikari,"[1, 5]","Nothing about this tired, self-conscious rip-off of other recent indie comedies says ""Smart"".  A high-profile cast plays a bunch of one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs from Screenwriting 101 as gamely as they can, all the while looking like a stint in the root canal chair would be about as much fun, and the proceedings are set to the most pervasively annoying treacly Edwin McCain meets Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack that never quits.  This movie can't even manage some original-sounding background music.  If the screenplay is trying way too hard to mimic bits of ""Good Will Hunting"" meets ""Dan in Real Life"" meets ""Juno"" meets ""Sideways"" . . .well, the squickily upbeat guitar tunes on the soundtrack fit right into that aesthetic.Dennis Quaid has never won an Oscar, but here he gives the Academy what they apparently like in hopes that this time will be the charm.  Sporting a beer gut and a massive face-concealing beard both Dennis Miller and Robin Williams would envy, he plays Dr. Lawrence Wetherhold, a crotchety literature professor, widowed years ago, whose grief has solidified into a chronic case of walking depression and general bad attitude.  Dr. Lawrence has a son in college at the institution where he teaches, a smart-alecky daughter in high school (played by Ellen Page reprising Juno as Tracy Flick in even worse sweater outfits) and a good-for-nothing chronically unemployed brother who shows up on Lawrence's doorstep asking for money . . .again.  When an ill-advised attempt to dodge bureaucracy ends with Lawrence in the ER with a concussion, he runs into a former student, attending doc Janet (Sarah Jessica Parker)and an oddball romance ensues, even though he had given her a C in his course 15 years previously.Along with half the known universe, I was a big fan of Parker in ""Sex and the City"", but the jury is still out for me as to whether she can actually act, or if Carrie Bradshaw was essentially an extension of herself.  Here she's striving for a 'serious' tone, as befits a medical professional, but she only succeeds in seeming low-energy and sad.  Nothing about her connotes 'doctor', from her stringy unprofessional hair to her sad-sack, annoyingly insecure delivery.  And I guarantee that you have never seen SJP so badly dressed, ever, nor are likely to again.  After this movie, I guarantee that ""The Family Stone"" will actually seem like a tour-de-force acting job to you.Come to think of it, low energy and sad is the vibe the entire cast puts forth, except for Thomas Haden Church, who is essentially retreading his Jack from ""Sideways"" as a low-rent stoner bum with a really bad haircut and even worse mustache.  The lighting is so supremely unflattering, everyone looks haggard and aged, particularly Quaid, but even Ellen Page, who at 22 could be presumed to have some vitality still in her.  The atmosphere is postively funeral, and I searched in vain for actual ""comedy"" within this comedy without success.  This is about as laugh-out-loud funny as a wrist-cutting.  Indeed--do the filmmakers even understand what normal people consider 'funny'?  In this movie, Juno/Ellen's uncle takes her out to a bar (she's 17) and gets her drunk on beer, and then she makes a pass at him and spends the rest of the movie rationalizing away the inappropriateness of the whole scenario given the fact that he was adopted and therefore not her REAL uncle.  Just the kind of logic that would appeal to Woody Allen, but profoundly unfunny nonetheless.Oddly, the one kind of charming aspect of this movie is also its downfall:  it's set in Pittsburgh in general and Carnegie-Mellon University in particular.  As a resident of Western PA during my collegiate years, I can say that absolutely, they got the production design down pat, to the washed-out light, the grimy, narrow and hilly streets, to the Wetherholds' cramped and very middle-class house.  Denizens of Pittsburgh will no doubt appreciate the 'cinema verite' feel of their fair city, but unfortunately too much realism is usually the opposite of funny. The last time Pittsburgh looked this good, it was in ""Dominick and Eugene"" an uplifting story about a retarded garbage man who dies young--a movie just as funny as ""Smart People""--which is to say, not at all.  After this interminable dose of 'realistic comedy' we gain a new appreciation for artifice in film-making.  Though ""Smart People"" goes to for the grungy, raw and 'real' look in its externals, the script itself is fake to the core.  People may look like this (those in need of a Prozac scrip, at any rate), but no real authentic people act or sound like this.  They went for the wrong level of realism here; it's easy to make everyone look bad, but not so easy to make them sound appealing.I give ""Smart People"" a D-minus.  I'd like to see a rewrite, this time with the funny put in.",2,Smart Like a Hangover,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,4843,"['Nothing', 'tired', 'self-conscious', 'rip-off', 'other', 'recent', 'indie', 'comedies', 'Smart', 'high-profile', 'cast', 'bunch', 'one-dimensional', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'Screenwriting', '101', 'as', 'gamely', 'can', 'looking', 'stint', 'root', 'canal', 'chair', 'would', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'proceedings', 'are', 'set', 'most', 'pervasively', 'annoying', 'treacly', 'Edwin', 'McCain', 'meets', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'soundtrack', 'never', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'manage', 'original-sounding', 'background', 'music', 'screenplay', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'mimic', 'bits', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'Juno', 'Sideways', '.well', 'squickily', 'upbeat', 'guitar', 'tunes', 'soundtrack', 'fit', 'right', 'aesthetic.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'never', 'won', 'Oscar', 'here', 'Academy', 'what', 'apparently', 'hopes', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'charm', 'Sporting', 'beer', 'gut', 'massive', 'face-concealing', 'beard', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'would', 'envy', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Wetherhold', 'crotchety', 'literature', 'professor', 'widowed', 'years', 'ago', 'grief', 'solidified', 'chronic', 'case', 'walking', 'depression', 'general', 'bad', 'attitude', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'son', 'college', 'institution', 'where', 'smart-alecky', 'daughter', 'high', 'school', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'reprising', 'Juno', 'Tracy', 'Flick', 'even', 'worse', 'sweater', 'outfits', 'good-for-nothing', 'chronically', 'unemployed', 'brother', 'who', 'up', 'Lawrence', 'doorstep', 'asking', 'money', '.again', 'When', 'ill-advised', 'attempt', 'dodge', 'bureaucracy', 'Lawrence', 'ER', 'concussion', 'former', 'student', 'attending', 'doc', 'Janet', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'oddball', 'romance', 'ensues', 'even', 'had', 'given', 'C', 'course', '15', 'years', 'previously.Along', 'known', 'universe', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'Parker', 'Sex', 'City', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'was', 'essentially', 'extension', 'herself', 'Here', 'striving', ""'serious"", 'tone', 'befits', 'medical', 'professional', 'only', 'seeming', 'low-energy', 'sad', 'Nothing', 'connotes', ""'doctor"", 'stringy', 'unprofessional', 'hair', 'sad-sack', 'annoyingly', 'insecure', 'delivery', 'guarantee', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'SJP', 'so', 'badly', 'dressed', 'ever', 'are', 'likely', 'again', 'movie', 'guarantee', 'Family', 'Stone', 'will', 'actually', 'seem', 'tour-de-force', 'acting', 'job', 'you.Come', 'think', 'low', 'energy', 'sad', 'vibe', 'entire', 'cast', 'forth', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'who', 'essentially', 'retreading', 'Jack', 'Sideways', 'low-rent', 'stoner', 'bum', 'really', 'bad', 'haircut', 'even', 'worse', 'mustache', 'lighting', 'so', 'supremely', 'unflattering', 'everyone', 'haggard', 'aged', 'particularly', 'Quaid', 'even', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'who', '22', 'could', 'be', 'presumed', 'have', 'vitality', 'still', 'atmosphere', 'postively', 'funeral', 'searched', 'vain', 'actual', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'success', 'about', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'wrist-cutting', 'Indeed', 'do', 'filmmakers', 'even', 'understand', 'what', 'normal', 'people', 'consider', 'movie', 'Juno/Ellen', 'uncle', 'out', 'bar', '17', 'drunk', 'beer', 'then', 'pass', 'rest', 'movie', 'rationalizing', 'away', 'inappropriateness', 'whole', 'scenario', 'given', 'fact', 'was', 'adopted', 'therefore', 'not', 'REAL', 'uncle', 'Just', 'kind', 'logic', 'would', 'appeal', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'profoundly', 'unfunny', 'nonetheless.Oddly', 'one', 'kind', 'charming', 'aspect', 'movie', 'also', 'downfall', 'set', 'Pittsburgh', 'general', 'Carnegie-Mellon', 'University', 'particular', 'resident', 'Western', 'PA', 'collegiate', 'years', 'can', 'say', 'absolutely', 'got', 'production', 'design', 'down', 'pat', 'washed-out', 'light', 'grimy', 'narrow', 'hilly', 'streets', 'Wetherholds', 'cramped', 'very', 'middle-class', 'house', 'Denizens', 'Pittsburgh', 'will', 'doubt', 'appreciate', ""'cinema"", 'verite', 'feel', 'fair', 'city', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'much', 'realism', 'usually', 'opposite', 'funny', 'last', 'time', 'Pittsburgh', 'looked', 'good', 'was', 'Dominick', 'Eugene', 'uplifting', 'story', 'retarded', 'garbage', 'man', 'who', 'young', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'Smart', 'People', 'say', 'not', 'interminable', 'dose', ""'realistic"", 'comedy', 'gain', 'new', 'appreciation', 'artifice', 'film-making', 'Smart', 'People', 'grungy', 'raw', 'look', 'externals', 'script', 'fake', 'core', 'People', 'may', 'look', 'need', 'Prozac', 'scrip', 'rate', 'real', 'authentic', 'people', 'act', 'sound', 'went', 'wrong', 'level', 'realism', 'here', 'easy', 'make', 'everyone', 'look', 'bad', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'make', 'sound', 'appealing.I', 'give', 'Smart', 'People', 'D-minus', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'rewrite', 'time', 'funny', 'put']",Smart People

He is so underrated and underappreciated.  He doesn't do a ton of movies, but when he is on his A-game, not many people are better.  He tends to steal a scene, seemingly unintentionally.  He's just good, really good.Dennis Quaid has sort of been out of the limelight for awhile and did a very good job playing a self-absorbed, cynical, jerk-of-a-proffesor.  His character is so sure that everyone else on Earth are idiots except him that he talks down to everyone.  Quaid played the foul tempered father surprisingly well.Sarah Jessica Parker really impressed me too.  She seemed to really try to be as un-Carrie Bradshaw like as possible. Fortunately, it worked for her.  Her character was a former student of Quaid's character that had a bit of a crush on him.  They, by chance, run into each other in an ER and begin a relationship that is unfavorable by Quaid's daughter, played by the very talented Ellen Page.The only complaint I can give the movie is the fact that Page plays a Neo-Conservative teenager that has only one goal and that is to go to a top notch college.  Oh and serve her father, brother, and uncle like a housewife.  It just didn't work and it wasn't her fault I don't think.  I came to the conclusion that it was probably a casting mistake.

Dr. Wetherhold most likely uses the same notes prepared the first time he delivered the lecture. Words just billow from him like smoke and not living things to be savored with others--his students. He holds their essays in as much disdain. During the course of the story he positions himself to be named the head of the English department.The pivotal point of the story is the doctor who treats Lawrence in the emergency room and grounds him from driving for six months (actually in retaliation for a C he assigned one of her essays written ten years earlier when she was his student and originally an English major.)They go out to eat. After he delivers a 45-minute soliloquy about Victorian literature, she interrupts to tell him what a stuffed windbag he is and leaves.All these people live in a grim reality of unrequited happiness,  acceptance of the status quo, and inertia to change anything. Little by little, life intercedes. There's a miracle that changes everything.""Smart People"" is about smart people, but not as a positive attribute. To take pride in being smart and not extending beyond oneself is the height of selfishness.

The film tells the story of Lawrence Wetherhold (Quaid), a literature professor at Carnegie Mellon. Lawrence lost his wife some years before the movie begins, and he appears to have been emotionally stunted ever since. He relates to his daughter, Vanessa (Page), on a purely intellectual basis, and he's cut off entirely from both his grown son and his adopted brother, Chuck (Haden Church).However, after a medical emergency, Lawrence meets Janet Hartigan (Parker), a former student now working as a physician.

I also found it difficult to relate to any of the characters. I mean, I understand that Lawrence needs to be an arrogant blowhard at times, but maybe a bit more humanity on Quaid's part (and in the script?) in some of the early scenes would have helped me out here. Ditto with Parker, who exasperated me to no end for no apparent reason.Page's Vanessa and Haden Church's Chuck were the only things that kept me watching. Page did a good job portraying Vanessa's confusion, her defense mechanisms, her vulnerability, and I appreciated it.

His job as a Literature professor has become unfulfilling as the position of head of the English department has eluded him as has appreciation of him by his co-workers and students. Lawrence levels condescension at most as he swaggers about in the confidence of his self perceived intellectual superiority.

After a turn of events Lawrence winds up in the hospital and cannot drive for 6 months at which point he begrudgingly accepts Chuck's offer to be his chauffeur and also attempts to begin a new romance with now doctor and former student Janet Hartigan (Sarah Jessica Parker)...""Smart People"" was a complete dud. It seemed to attempt to emulate in ways and ride off of the success of movies like ""Sideways (Widescreen Edition)"" but failed miserably. It is a shame as I have liked most of what Haden Church and Ellen Page have done.The Good: The acting was solid all around. I didn't have any problems with look of the movie.The Bad: Story / plot. One of the first mistakes is focus is spread too thin. Instead of the story focusing on Lawrence's relationship with his family or his adopted brother or his professional life, or his relationship with Dr. Hartigan it tries to focus on all of them which leaves the movie basically out of focus. The character follows a typical path that leads to self evolution which is demonstrated with the subtlety of a hurricane. I won't give away how but you are watching the movie and the event happens and you are thinking ""well the evolution has happened'.Characters: One of the main failings of this movie is the main character. In ""Sideways"" you can at least empathize with the Miles character even if you don't appreciate him. I couldn't find anything to like, or appreciate about the Wetherhold character. The character is so pompous and so sure that an education concerning literature is the only one of importance that he even condescends to a Doctor who runs the ER. Sarah Jessica Parker's character is also a problem. The 2 character are either unlikable, unbelievable or both.The score was also a problem for me. When doing a movie like this the score is critical in helping to carry the underlying emotion of the characters. Here we get a repetitive acoustic guitar riff that only implies melancholy and nothing else until the very end. It was repetitive, boring and didn't convey anything new as it repeated over and again.Overall: If you are a smart person, you won't waste your time on this one.",2,"Not dramatic, funny, or smart",1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,2700,"['Smart', 'People', 'written', 'Mark', 'Poirier', 'directed', 'Noam', 'Murro.Professor', 'Lawrence', 'Wetherhold', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'miserable', 'widower', 'job', 'Literature', 'professor', 'become', 'unfulfilling', 'position', 'head', 'English', 'department', 'eluded', 'appreciation', 'co-workers', 'students', 'Lawrence', 'levels', 'condescension', 'most', 'confidence', 'self', 'perceived', 'intellectual', 'superiority', 'Lawrence', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Chuck', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'up', 'needing', 'borrow', 'money', 'quickly', 'rebuffed', 'turn', 'events', 'Lawrence', 'up', 'hospital', 'can', 'not', 'drive', '6', 'months', 'point', 'begrudgingly', 'Chuck', 'offer', 'be', 'chauffeur', 'also', 'attempts', 'begin', 'new', 'romance', 'now', 'doctor', 'former', 'student', 'Janet', 'Hartigan', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Smart', 'People', 'was', 'complete', 'dud', 'seemed', 'attempt', 'emulate', 'ways', 'ride', 'success', 'movies', 'Sideways', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'failed', 'miserably', 'shame', 'have', 'liked', 'most', 'what', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'have', 'done.The', 'Good', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'look', 'movie.The', 'Bad', 'Story', '/', 'plot', 'One', 'first', 'mistakes', 'focus', 'spread', 'too', 'thin', 'Instead', 'story', 'focusing', 'Lawrence', 'relationship', 'family', 'adopted', 'brother', 'professional', 'life', 'relationship', 'Dr.', 'Hartigan', 'focus', 'movie', 'basically', 'focus', 'character', 'typical', 'path', 'self', 'evolution', 'demonstrated', 'subtlety', 'hurricane', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'how', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'event', 'are', 'thinking', 'well', 'evolution', ""happened'.Characters"", 'One', 'main', 'failings', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Sideways', 'can', 'least', 'empathize', 'Miles', 'character', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'like', 'appreciate', 'Wetherhold', 'character', 'character', 'so', 'pompous', 'so', 'sure', 'education', 'concerning', 'literature', 'only', 'one', 'importance', 'even', 'Doctor', 'who', 'ER', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'character', 'also', 'problem', '2', 'character', 'are', 'unlikable', 'unbelievable', 'both.The', 'score', 'was', 'also', 'problem', 'When', 'doing', 'movie', 'score', 'critical', 'helping', 'carry', 'underlying', 'emotion', 'characters', 'Here', 'get', 'repetitive', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'riff', 'only', 'implies', 'melancholy', 'nothing', 'else', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'repetitive', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'convey', 'anything', 'new', 'repeated', 'again.Overall', 'are', 'smart', 'person', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'one']",Smart People

Raising his daughter on his own has been difficult, but she's growing up just like her dad. And no, that is not a good thing. (He has a son, too, but he seems at least relatively well adjusted. So this movie is not about him.) The professor's dead-beat brother moves in with them and tries to give perspective to both the professor and his daughter.Apparently there is a new formula in small-budget, independent comedies.

He is the down-on-his-luck brother who weasles his way in to free room and board. While staying with his brother and niece he shakes them out of old habits and tries to implore them to take control and live their lives free from societal pressures to be something they do not want to be. Sounds heavy, but it wasn't that bad.This was Ellen Page's big follow-up to Juno. I don't think this was what people were hoping for. As the professor's daughter she brought all of the attitude of Juno with none of the charm.Dennis Quaid is our nutty professor, our single father. I like Mr. Quaid.

Some professors made us feel like we were a bug to be stepped on.  What if you happen to meet your old professor again?  Would you say hello?  Remind your professor about their flaws?  In this case, this film opens the door to the whole professor-student relationships.  Some of his former students remind him of being cold and oblivious to them as a person.  Eventually, the plot takes an interesting turn with his former student.  To avoid ruining the plot, it makes for an interesting storyline that weaves loss, rejection, failure, and new beginning.For CMU alums, you will recognize buildings like Porter and Doughetry Halls.  Also, there are some scenes like the big green on Forbes Avenue where a new art sculpture now stands.  You definitely see the streets of Pittsburgh how it was meant to be seen.

1165026,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0019XZDZO,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","***1/2A low-budget comedy/drama set in and around the city of Pittsburgh, ""Smart People"" is so muted and laidback in its demeanor and tone that it practically borders on the innocuous.  Yet, it is just that seeming banality that makes the movie work in the long run.A pot-bellied Dennis Quaid plays a snarling, insensitive English Literature professor who`s pretty much gone to seed in both his personal and professional life, a character not too far removed from the one Michael Caine played in ""Educating Rita.""  Lawrence Wetherhold is still so devastated by the death of his wife that he keeps all her clothes hanging in the bedroom closet as a sort of unholy shrine to the dearly departed woman.  Needless to say, Lawrence hasn't made any great strides moving on with his life - until, that is, he strikes up a tentative romance with a physician and former student of his (Sarah Jessica Parker) who helps him to begin that too long delayed process of reconnecting himself to the world.There's nothing particularly original or earth-shattering in this umpteenth tale of a burnt-out teacher finding a renewal of commitment and purpose in his profession, but writer Mark Poirier has provided enough in the way of ancillary details of character and plotting to at least keep matters interesting.Ellen Page, for instance, plays Lawrence`s overly possessive daughter, Vanessa, a college-bound Young Republican who's more obsessed with earning a perfect score on her SATs than with establishing meaningful friendships with people her own age.  Thomas Hayden Church portrays her adoptive Uncle Chuck, a black sheep wastrel who, in point of contrast, makes even Lawrence look like a paragon of togetherness and success.  Yet, despite his own troubles and failings, Chuck is the one who tries to get his niece to loosen up a bit and finally start enjoying life.Together these characters drift through life, making wry observations on their situations and relationships on their way to a happy ending.There may be a few too many musical montage sequences for the movie's own good, but the expository scenes, as directed by Noam Murro and performed by the actors, nicely capture the unhurried rhythms and simple ironies of everyday life.",3,inauspicious but winning drama,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,2229,"['***1/2A', 'low-budget', 'comedy/drama', 'set', 'city', 'Pittsburgh', 'Smart', 'People', 'so', 'muted', 'laidback', 'demeanor', 'tone', 'practically', 'innocuous', 'just', 'seeming', 'banality', 'movie', 'work', 'long', 'run.A', 'pot-bellied', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'snarling', 'insensitive', 'English', 'Literature', 'professor', 'who', 's', 'pretty', 'much', 'gone', 'seed', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'character', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'one', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'played', 'Educating', 'Rita', 'Lawrence', 'Wetherhold', 'still', 'so', 'devastated', 'death', 'wife', 'clothes', 'hanging', 'bedroom', 'closet', 'sort', 'unholy', 'shrine', 'dearly', 'departed', 'woman', 'Needless', 'say', 'Lawrence', ""n't"", 'made', 'great', 'strides', 'moving', 'life', 'up', 'tentative', 'romance', 'physician', 'former', 'student', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'who', 'begin', 'too', 'long', 'delayed', 'process', 'reconnecting', 'world.There', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'original', 'earth-shattering', 'umpteenth', 'tale', 'burnt-out', 'teacher', 'finding', 'renewal', 'commitment', 'purpose', 'profession', 'writer', 'Mark', 'Poirier', 'provided', 'enough', 'way', 'ancillary', 'details', 'character', 'plotting', 'least', 'keep', 'matters', 'interesting.Ellen', 'Page', 'instance', 'Lawrence', 's', 'overly', 'possessive', 'daughter', 'Vanessa', 'college-bound', 'Young', 'Republican', 'who', 'more', 'obsessed', 'earning', 'perfect', 'score', 'SATs', 'establishing', 'meaningful', 'friendships', 'people', 'own', 'age', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'adoptive', 'Uncle', 'Chuck', 'black', 'sheep', 'wastrel', 'who', 'point', 'contrast', 'even', 'Lawrence', 'look', 'paragon', 'togetherness', 'success', 'own', 'troubles', 'failings', 'Chuck', 'one', 'who', 'get', 'niece', 'loosen', 'up', 'bit', 'finally', 'start', 'enjoying', 'life.Together', 'characters', 'drift', 'life', 'making', 'wry', 'observations', 'situations', 'relationships', 'way', 'happy', 'ending.There', 'may', 'be', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'musical', 'montage', 'sequences', 'movie', 'own', 'good', 'expository', 'scenes', 'directed', 'Noam', 'Murro', 'performed', 'actors', 'nicely', 'capture', 'unhurried', 'rhythms', 'simple', 'ironies', 'everyday', 'life']",Smart People

1165032,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0019XZDZO,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 2]","Lawrence Wetherhold (Dennis Quaid) is an English professor at Carnegie Mellon University.  His aura of superiority keeps colleagues at a distance, squashing any possibility of relationships other than professional.  He customarily parks his car in the faculty lot so that it occupies two spots.  He loves his subject, but never really connects with his students, whose names and faces he seldom remembers.Wetherhold's wife has passed away.  His son, James (Ashton Holmes), although a student at Carnegie Mellon, lives in a dorm and keeps his distance, while his daughter, Vanessa (Ellen Page), still in high school, takes it upon herself to keep the home fires burning.  She appears to be very much her dad's girl:  clever, casting a wide swath of attitude, and often supercilious.  Yet she hopes to be accepted to Stanford University, on the opposite side of the country.In a fit of ill temper, Wetherhold knocks himself unconscious and lands in the hospital, where ER physician Janet Hartigan (Sarah Jessica Parker) happens to be a former student of his.  Because he's diagnosed as having had a minor seizure, Dr. Hartigan tells Wetherhold he cannot legally drive.  Reluctantly, the professor asks visiting adopted brother Chuck (Thomas Haden Church) to stick around, move in temporarily, and serve as his driver.We've seen self-important academics on screen before in such films as ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" ""The Paper Chase,"" and ""The Squid and the Whale.""  In ""Smart People,"" Quaid's Wetherhold is uptight, socially awkward, and condescending toward those he openly regards as his intellectual inferiors.  Yet we continue to care about him, understanding that the loss of his wife may have taken more of a toll than Wetherhold will acknowledge and hoping he will loosen up and become more of a mensch.Quaid holds the film together with a solid, carefully textured performance -- one of his best.  There is a sadness he carries with him like a knapsack filled with rocks, and he seldom smiles.  His rumpled hair, scruffy beard, and deeply lined face give him the appearance of a guy who has abandoned even simple attempts to make himself look presentable.  This is superior character acting, revealing a depth of emotion despite a facade of officiousness.  Not an easy trick to pull off.Church is a welcome joy in ""Smart People,"" as he amusingly contrasts with his older brother.  Though he is in many ways immature and irresponsible, Chuck has basic smarts that are especially sharp when it comes to human relationships.  It's Chuck who navigates an unusual relationship with Vanessa, stepping back to become her uncle rather than confidante when a hint of romance is about to ignite.  Chuck also eggs Lawrence on to pursue a relationship with Dr. Janet.  Church's Chuck has many elements of his sidekick to Paul Giamatti in ""Sideways,"" but the role is less showy, more subdued, and ultimately very effective.Parker's Dr. Hartigan seems a major plot manipulation.  As Wetherhold's student, she had a crush on him.  Now, as his doctor, we're meant to accept that she still feels a glow toward him.  She is more than patient with his incredible ineptness on a date, and keeps giving him second chances to redeem himself and shine in her eyes.  This is more the stuff of a ""Lifetime"" made-for-TV movie than reality.Ellen Page's Vanessa is really a variation of her title character in ""Juno.""  She's bright, mature, at a crossroads in her life, and feels she is losing control of her destiny.  Both Juno and Vanessa are casual optimists until they face a crisis.  For Vanessa, it is Dr. Hartigan, whom she regards as a threat to her role as unofficial caretaker of her dad's well being.Rated R, ""Smart People"" is a gentle film that balances personal drama with comedy.  Director Noam Murro has transformed Mark Poirier's screenplay into a look at a dysfunctional family that never delves into terribly dark corners.

Also of note, the soundtrack fit the film perfectly, it added a lot - enough that I'm considering purchasing the soundtrack, which is a rarity for me.",4,Well acted ramble,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,585,"['movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'clear', 'plot', 'defined', 'message', 'particular', 'ending', 'enjoyed', 'anyway', 'one', 'slighly', 'artsy', 'films', 'where', 'have', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'moments', 'acting', 'superb', 'kind', 'thought', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'was', 'channeling', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'points', 'probably', 'best', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actors', 'liked', 'lot', 'things', 'remained', 'unsaid', 'Also', 'note', 'soundtrack', 'fit', 'film', 'perfectly', 'added', 'lot', ""'m"", 'considering', 'purchasing', 'soundtrack', 'rarity']",Smart People

A seizure and a fall send Lawrence to the emergency room where the physician, a former student of his, ends up going on a date with him. His daughter, Vanessa, lonely and friendless, who's been bonding with his brother, tries to sabotage dad and the doctor's relationship, but Lawrence is good at that without help. This is a fine story told with non-stop heart-tugging humor and verve. The movie captured my attention immediately, and held it from beginning to end. This is a fun, funny, moving portrait of a delightful band of characters. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.",5,Smart People,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,822,"['Lawrence', 'Wetherhold', 'miserable', 'misanthropic', 'widower', 'pompous', 'professor', 'Carnegie', 'Mellon', 'indifferent', 'father', 'college', 'student', 'high-school', 'senior', 'reluctant', 'brother', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'who', 'come', 'town', 'seizure', 'fall', 'send', 'Lawrence', 'emergency', 'room', 'where', 'physician', 'former', 'student', 'up', 'going', 'date', 'daughter', 'Vanessa', 'lonely', 'friendless', 'who', 'been', 'bonding', 'brother', 'tries', 'sabotage', 'dad', 'doctor', 'relationship', 'Lawrence', 'good', 'help', 'fine', 'story', 'told', 'non-stop', 'heart-tugging', 'humor', 'verve', 'movie', 'captured', 'attention', 'immediately', 'held', 'beginning', 'end', 'fun', 'funny', 'moving', 'portrait', 'delightful', 'band', 'characters', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone']",Smart People

A cross between 'Little Miss Sunshine' and 'As Good As It Gets, 'Smart People' is witty, sarcastically humorous and intelligent.The characters are quirky and awkward; each of their personalities is taken to such an extreme that it becomes comical. Great acting overall; Ellen Page is brilliant in the role of Vanessa, an over-achieving, anti-social teenager. I was slightly disappointed with Sarah Jessica Parker, as her mannerisms were too reminiscent of 'Sex and the City', especially during the bedroom scene.",4,Smart Dysfunctional People,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,601,"['think', ""'Smart"", 'People', 'acquired', 'taste', 'movie', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'cross', ""'Little"", 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Good', 'People', 'witty', 'sarcastically', 'humorous', 'intelligent.The', 'characters', 'are', 'quirky', 'awkward', 'personalities', 'taken', 'extreme', 'comical', 'Great', 'acting', 'overall', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Vanessa', 'over-achieving', 'anti-social', 'teenager', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'mannerisms', 'were', 'too', 'reminiscent', ""'Sex"", 'City', 'especially', 'bedroom', 'scene']",Smart People
