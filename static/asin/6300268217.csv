I only got to see the movie once.  This movie is like a time capsule of the late '70s.  And how awesome it was to see Richard Tee, Eric Gale, Steve Gadd, Ullanda McCullough and Patti Austin in action!  Lou Reed had a nice movie-stealing cameo, and of course, always great to see Rip Torn and Joan Hackett...and bonus, you get to see her completely nude, front and back, which is worth the price of admission, lol!  It always amazes me to see someone in the '70s like Joan Hackett being so slim at her age.  And she didn't have the physique of someone who worked out.  If you look at a lot of '70s film and television, most of the people are slim and they probably didn't work out or watch what they ate.

Those other reviewers who 'got' the movie, whether being a musician or just an observer of how detritus gets peddled for art on a daily basis, are to be commended for recognizing the subtleties in this movie. One aspect of genius in this movie is recruiting REAL musicians to portray the characters they represent. Maybe some of those who found it boring would have preferred some hotel room trashing rather than a depiction of professionalism. Anyone with a job that involves travel knows about the strain that time away from your family can create. Add to that, being part of an industry that most people don't regard as a legitimate job. Also the politics of being subjected to the opinions of superiors (and their influences) who haven't the slightest idea of what you're trying to accomplish.

232168,A2D6YQW7AN9OTG,6300268217,Gary O. Shepherd,"[0, 0]","Paul Simon's screen debut in a dramatic acting role. This is a much maligned and little seen film, by one of the great geniuses of modern music. Simon wrote and starred in this tale of a has-been pop star who is on the verge of delivering a new album, and coping with changing musical trends and impending middle-age. It is generally well-done, if somewhat depressing on content. The musical sequences are worth the price of the DVD on their own. Simon's band at this stage of his career was absolutely stellar. The cameo appearance by the B52s is sardonically hilarious. The ending is a little predictable, and not quite believable, but the DVD will appeal to all fans of Paul Simon, and 70s and early 80s music.",4,Not a One Trick Pony,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,713,"['Paul', 'Simon', 'screen', 'debut', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'role', 'much', 'maligned', 'little', 'seen', 'film', 'one', 'great', 'geniuses', 'modern', 'music', 'Simon', 'wrote', 'starred', 'tale', 'has-been', 'pop', 'star', 'who', 'verge', 'delivering', 'new', 'album', 'coping', 'changing', 'musical', 'trends', 'impending', 'middle-age', 'generally', 'well-done', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'content', 'musical', 'sequences', 'are', 'price', 'DVD', 'own', 'Simon', 'band', 'stage', 'career', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'B52s', 'sardonically', 'hilarious', 'ending', 'little', 'predictable', 'not', 'quite', 'believable', 'DVD', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'Paul', 'Simon', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'music']",N/A

A lot of his songs really do lack a hook, as one of the characters in the movies said, and this movie is categorized as a musical, which means the songs Jonah plays with his band fill up the majority of the time.  I do have to credit Paul for the acting.  He doesn't deserve an Academy Award but he wasn't bad at all.

232170,APEF45BBSR1IC,6300268217,Karen Schlueter,"[1, 1]","Paul Simon has always been a great singer-songwriter. I've never pictured him as a screenwriter until I heard about, and saw this movie.(I even have a book of the movie script.) It was about a fictional rock star named [Jonah Levin]. With all the major changes in the music industry, Jonah's career was disintegrating, as was his marriage. Eventually he reclaimed both things in the end. Although, the movie wasn't a huge success, it was still a great movie. Besides Paul, the cameo appearances of musicians Steve Gadd, Eric Gale, Tony Levin, and Richard Tee were superb. Even the cameo appearances of [Harper] Simon, the B-52's, Sam and Dave, the Lovin' Spoonful, Tiny Tim, and Lou Reed were also outstanding. Paul is still one of the most gifted stars I've ever known.

Still, it probably captured fairly well some of the conflicts between members of the music industry, particularly artist and producer.Beyond that, as a Paul Simon fan there is an added interest as well as seeing Joan Hackett in one of her last movies, and a short cameo by John Sebastian.

It's not great and inspiring as a story. It's largely watching someone's downfall. To be honest, take out the humour, and this and Spinal Tap are VERY closely related.  It's the story of a somewhat outdated, and less-successful-than-he-used-to-be musician and deals with his professional and personal trials at this point in his career (the fictional character's).  This film deals with life on the road, the struggle for artistry versus the need for commercial success, and the personal hardships of someone who chooses the life of a musician.  Looking at this and VH-1's Bands On The Run show (I like that too) does a lot to take the glamour out of being a rock musician.  It's not the most upbeat of movies, but basically shows you the other side of A Hard Day's Night!  Fascinating as a character study and a look at the music industry.
