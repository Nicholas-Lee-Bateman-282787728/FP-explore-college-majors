It takes more liberties with the source material than most other Poirot adaptations do, changing some of the characters' relationships and personalities and even eliminating one of the characters entirely. (If, like me, you were eager to see Susan's husband Greg depicted onscreen, prepare yourself for the fact that he doesn't even exist here! Oh, and Susan herself is now Susanna and an entirely different character.)So why the four stars? Because once I got past my disappointment with the ways in which the movie deviated from the book, I found myself enjoying it to a surprising degree. The basic plot and themes are still intact. As is wonderfully characteristic of this series, we get some memorably sharp dialogue, a few likable characters and moments of sneaky poignancy. The scenery and costumes are typically gorgeous, and David Suchet is masterful as always.If you don't mind or even find it creatively interesting when Poirot movies differ from the Christie books on which they were based, I'd really recommend checking this one out!",4,Deviates from the book but enjoyable in its own right,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,1120,"['can', 'readily', 'understand', 'why', 'one', 'received', 'less', 'stellar', 'reviews', 'more', 'liberties', 'source', 'material', 'most', 'other', 'Poirot', 'adaptations', 'do', 'changing', 'characters', 'relationships', 'personalities', 'even', 'eliminating', 'one', 'characters', 'entirely', 'were', 'eager', 'see', 'Susan', 'husband', 'Greg', 'depicted', 'onscreen', 'prepare', 'fact', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'here', 'Oh', 'Susan', 'now', 'Susanna', 'entirely', 'different', 'character', 'So', 'why', 'four', 'stars', 'once', 'got', 'past', 'disappointment', 'ways', 'movie', 'deviated', 'book', 'found', 'enjoying', 'surprising', 'degree', 'basic', 'plot', 'themes', 'are', 'still', 'intact', 'wonderfully', 'characteristic', 'series', 'get', 'memorably', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'few', 'likable', 'characters', 'moments', 'sneaky', 'poignancy', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'are', 'typically', 'gorgeous', 'David', 'Suchet', 'masterful', 'always.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'even', 'find', 'creatively', 'interesting', 'when', 'Poirot', 'movies', 'differ', 'Christie', 'books', 'were', 'based', ""'d"", 'really', 'recommend', 'checking', 'one', 'out']",N/A

1041925,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B000M1A3PE,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","Agatha Christie's Poirot books are sometimes difficult to follow because of the multiple characters she places in her books, many of whom we dislike because of the little information we get about them in the early parts of the drama, and all of them are possible killers. Another problem is the many red herrings that she inserts. The difficulty is increased in the films where the events and the introduction of characters happen so quickly. The films frequently add a character or two that are not in the book and change events to meet what the film makers feel is cinematic necessity. She usually places a true clue in the book, but it is usually hard to see it; it is like a needle in a haystack of red herrings. These clues are easier to spot in the films because the film makers seem to give these facts an extra second. Yet, it is still not easy to spot. Despite these difficulties, the effort expended in reading or viewing her tale is rewarded by the enjoyment that the reader and viewer get. The enjoyment is increased in the films by the excellent acting by David Suchet as a quirky, idiosyncratic, overly egotistical, but always right (except for only two times), dogmatic searcher for truth.In this tale, Poirot is hired to find the murderer of an eccentric woman, the sister of a rich man who had just died.  Everyone knew that the rich man wanted to leave his wealth to a certain young man. Yet when Poirot's friend who hired him, a lawyer, opens the will, he finds that the young man had been disinherited. The dead man was cremated. After the cremation, just before she is killed, the eccentric woman shouts out that he was murdered. Was he murdered and, if so, why? Why was the young man disinherited? Later, a woman who seems to find the answer is hit over the head. What is going on? Who killed the eccentric woman and why?",5,"While different than the book and smetimes difficult to follow, the film is excellent",1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,1843,"['Agatha', 'Christie', 'Poirot', 'books', 'are', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'follow', 'multiple', 'characters', 'books', 'many', 'whom', 'dislike', 'little', 'information', 'get', 'early', 'parts', 'drama', 'are', 'possible', 'killers', 'problem', 'many', 'red', 'herrings', 'difficulty', 'increased', 'films', 'where', 'events', 'introduction', 'characters', 'happen', 'so', 'quickly', 'films', 'frequently', 'add', 'character', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'book', 'change', 'events', 'meet', 'what', 'film', 'makers', 'feel', 'cinematic', 'necessity', 'usually', 'true', 'clue', 'book', 'usually', 'hard', 'see', 'needle', 'haystack', 'red', 'herrings', 'clues', 'are', 'easier', 'spot', 'films', 'film', 'makers', 'seem', 'give', 'facts', 'extra', 'second', 'still', 'not', 'easy', 'spot', 'difficulties', 'effort', 'expended', 'reading', 'viewing', 'tale', 'rewarded', 'enjoyment', 'reader', 'viewer', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'increased', 'films', 'excellent', 'acting', 'David', 'Suchet', 'quirky', 'idiosyncratic', 'overly', 'egotistical', 'always', 'right', 'only', 'two', 'times', 'dogmatic', 'searcher', 'truth.In', 'tale', 'Poirot', 'hired', 'find', 'murderer', 'eccentric', 'woman', 'sister', 'rich', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'died', 'Everyone', 'knew', 'rich', 'man', 'wanted', 'leave', 'wealth', 'certain', 'young', 'man', 'when', 'Poirot', 'friend', 'who', 'hired', 'lawyer', 'will', 'young', 'man', 'had', 'been', 'disinherited', 'dead', 'man', 'was', 'cremated', 'cremation', 'just', 'killed', 'eccentric', 'woman', 'out', 'was', 'murdered', 'murdered', 'so', 'why', 'Why', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'disinherited', 'Later', 'woman', 'who', 'find', 'answer', 'hit', 'head', 'What', 'going', 'Who', 'killed', 'eccentric', 'woman', 'why']",N/A
1041926,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000M1A3PE,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""After the Funeral"", based on Agatha Christie's 1953 novel of the same name, is a feature-length film first broadcast as part of Series 10 of ITV's ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" in 2006. Poirot is asked by the lawyer Gilbert Entwhistle (Robert Bathurst) to investigate the family of his client, a Mr. Richard Abernethie, who recently died. To his family's surprise, Richard instructed that his estate be sold and the proceeds divided among his 5 living relatives: brother Timothy (Benjamin Whitrow), sister Cora, nieces Rosamund (Fiona Glascott) and Susannah (Lucy Punch), and sister-in-law Helen (Geraldine James). Everyone had expected his fortune to go to George (Michael Fassbender), Richard's favorite nephew. The day after, the eccentric Cora, an artist and collector looked after by her companion Miss Gilcrist (Monica Dolan), is gruesomely murdered in her bed with a hatchet.As usual, the family members dislike one another. But this is not a story of old family secrets. Poirot is at first consternated, because he believes that every single one of the family lied to him about their whereabouts at the time of Cora's murder. I have to say I saw the solution coming pretty early on, though not the entire scenario. The mystery is interesting enough. As these Poirot mysteries have all been placed in the interwar years, the film does not convey the same sense of post-war pessimism that the book does. Somehow all the characters seem pitiful, as if their lives have greatly deteriorated. But we don't know why. That would have been the War. This is a rare case where moving the mystery to the 1930s causes something to be lost.There have been some minor changes from the book, which make the characters' behavior more salacious. Salacious is not bad in itself, but this is entirely gratuitous and introduces elements into the plot that serve no purpose. I was particularly put off when Poirot humiliates one of the suspects by forcing her to confess to an indiscretion in front of her family. This is a vicious, pointless thing for Poirot to do and out of character. Poirot has always been a gentleman and protector of innocents. This was the season when writers introduced a bizarre religiosity into the series that gives Poirot a mean streak. ""After the Funeral"" is reasonably entertaining, but superfluous subplots, an ill-tempered Poirot, and a flat ending make it no more than mediocre on the whole.",3,"Something Is Lost in Adaptation This Time, and Unfortunately Something Gained.",1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,2410,"['Funeral', 'based', 'Agatha', 'Christie', '1953', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'feature-length', 'film', 'first', 'broadcast', 'part', 'Series', '10', 'ITV', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Poirot', '2006', 'Poirot', 'asked', 'lawyer', 'Gilbert', 'Entwhistle', 'Robert', 'Bathurst', 'investigate', 'family', 'client', 'Mr.', 'Richard', 'Abernethie', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'family', 'surprise', 'Richard', 'instructed', 'estate', 'be', 'sold', 'proceeds', 'divided', '5', 'living', 'relatives', 'brother', 'Timothy', 'Benjamin', 'Whitrow', 'sister', 'Cora', 'nieces', 'Rosamund', 'Fiona', 'Glascott', 'Susannah', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'sister-in-law', 'Helen', 'Geraldine', 'James', 'Everyone', 'had', 'expected', 'fortune', 'go', 'George', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Richard', 'favorite', 'nephew', 'day', 'eccentric', 'Cora', 'artist', 'collector', 'looked', 'companion', 'Miss', 'Gilcrist', 'Monica', 'Dolan', 'gruesomely', 'murdered', 'bed', 'hatchet.As', 'usual', 'family', 'members', 'dislike', 'one', 'not', 'story', 'old', 'family', 'secrets', 'Poirot', 'first', 'consternated', 'single', 'one', 'family', 'lied', 'whereabouts', 'time', 'Cora', 'murder', 'have', 'say', 'saw', 'solution', 'coming', 'pretty', 'early', 'not', 'entire', 'scenario', 'mystery', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Poirot', 'mysteries', 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'interwar', 'years', 'film', 'not', 'convey', 'same', 'sense', 'post-war', 'pessimism', 'book', 'Somehow', 'characters', 'seem', 'pitiful', 'lives', 'have', 'greatly', 'deteriorated', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'War', 'rare', 'case', 'where', 'moving', 'mystery', '1930s', 'causes', 'something', 'be', 'lost.There', 'have', 'been', 'minor', 'changes', 'book', 'make', 'characters', 'behavior', 'more', 'salacious', 'Salacious', 'not', 'bad', 'entirely', 'gratuitous', 'introduces', 'elements', 'plot', 'serve', 'purpose', 'was', 'particularly', 'put', 'off', 'when', 'Poirot', 'one', 'suspects', 'forcing', 'confess', 'indiscretion', 'front', 'family', 'vicious', 'pointless', 'thing', 'Poirot', 'do', 'character', 'Poirot', 'always', 'been', 'gentleman', 'protector', 'innocents', 'was', 'season', 'when', 'writers', 'introduced', 'bizarre', 'religiosity', 'series', 'Poirot', 'mean', 'streak', 'Funeral', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'superfluous', 'subplots', 'ill-tempered', 'Poirot', 'flat', 'ending', 'make', 'more', 'mediocre', 'whole']",N/A
