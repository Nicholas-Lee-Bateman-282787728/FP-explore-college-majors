1440587,A231FGX8G2Q5EW,B0053O8AQE,4EverYoung,"[0, 0]","I purchased season one on blu ray because I'm a fan of the show. The video and audio quality are brilliant. Many of the shows writers, consultants, producers used to work on the ""WIll and Grace"" show, so it's no secret were this show gets it's wit and humor from. The blu ray packaging offers a ""freebie"" in the form of digital copies of the entire season through the often loathed and hatred of ""Ultraviolet"" and it's sister or partner company ""Flikster"". I have never been a fan of either and never will be. I refuse to let these companies dictate when, where, if and how I can watch my content. That being said I decided to suppress my usual vomit inducing tendencies when either of the aforementioned names are uttered, and proceeded to activate the code on Flikster's web site to gain access to season one. My intent was to watch  the series using the free Flikster app available for use on apple's iPad and phone. if you do this you will be wasting your time people. The series is not available, and there is no eta as to when it will be available. You are then directed to click on the picture icon of the series once in the app, to direct you to others sources to view the series. You are then redirected back to ultraviolet's web site which doesn't have an available app to watch on apple products either.

I find 2 Broke Girls the best comedy on TV since Friends. The plot is not really complicated, it's just all about Max (played by Dennings) and Caroline (Beth Behrs) trying to earn money to pursue a cupcake business. But it's not that easy, a lot of complications, like money issues, or love, and even funny situations get in the way of this girls.

1440600,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0053O8AQE,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","My real reason for writing this review, the theme song. I could not get that song out of my head and the clips were always too short to Soundhound it. Well I finally found the song. It is Second Chance by Peter Bjorn and John. There aren't many television show theme songs that stand alone (Taxi was a notable exception). Second Chance is actually a really good song. The song is a huge surprise because the vocals of the song are never played on the show.Gimme SomeThis is one of my guilty pleasures. Two Broke Girls is an edgy dirty show. I hate to admit that I'm addicted to this show. Whitney Cummings humor is so edgy and funny. Kat Dennings as Max is perfectly cast, just the right mix of everything. During season one Caroline played by Beth Behrs frankly annoyed me. But as seasons two and three have aired, her character has softened and become more likeable.Stifler's Mom? Amazing casting choice (Jennifer Coolidge) for Sophie. Garret Morris (Saturday Night Live 1975-1980 - the outstanding early years) as Earl is underplayed to perfection. With only a few lines he carries a strong presence. Oleg, Jonathan Kite, is so disgusting. Anybody that has worked in a kitchen knows an Oleg. Making him Sophie's sex slave is genius. The show went just a little too far with Han as the butt of certain jokes. I'm glad they settled that down to more jokes about him and how he acts as opposed to any stereotypes - that took some doing to get those jokes just right. Matthew Moy as Han is an excellent actor. During season one he was more like Jon Cryer on Two and a Half Men - can't ever do anything right.There is a lot of just on the edge sex humor. Kat is quick to fill in the double entendre or flat out dirty remark. I like Denning and Behrs' chemistry. Whitney Cummings as writer on this show is much better than her self titled show, Whitney.I didn't give this show much of a chance to survive the first season.

1440606,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0053O8AQE,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[8, 13]","I started watching TWO BROKE GIRLS mostly because of the talented and beautiful Kat Dennings (who I fell in love with in CHARLIE BARTLETT and continued that love in THOR) and was really enjoying it for the first five episodes or so. I thought that the performances of the two leads (Dennings and Beth Behrs) were quite good, and their comic timing was pretty spot-on. However, the psuedo-shock ""offensive"" comedy of co-creator Whitney Cummings as well as the female-empowerment/hyper-sexual comic stylings of other co-creator Michael Patrick King (of SEX AND THE CITY fame) do become grating, because the repetition of the shock-comedy loses its edge after six or seven episodes of single and double-entendres, the stereotyping of the diner's meek Korean owner Han (Matthew Moy) and its Eastern Bloc refugee sex fiend Oleg (Jonathan Kite) and making fun of just about everyone.Plot-wise, it's a female mismatched buddy comedy: You have Max, the hard-as-nails, smart-mouthed, street-wisened babe (Dennings) and you have Caroline, the spoiled-but-newly-poor statue-esque blonde beauty naive little rich girl (Behrs). Paired together in a surprisingly-spacious yet somehow-affordable-on-a-waitress-and-babysitter salary as well as the 24-hour greasy spoon diner they both work in, Max teaches Caroline the realities of the world after being ungraciously thrust from her life of privledge after her Madoff-like father is imprisoned for putting together a Ponzi scheme, and then Caroline teaches Max about the business of selling Max's ""designer"" homemade cupcakes. It's not quite a 21st-Century female version of THE ODD COUPLE, but it's close.I'm glad that there is a comedy on network TV that has a little edge to it (since that's primarily reserved for pay cable stations like FX, which has shows like WILFRED and LOUIE or HBO, which has GIRLS, VEEP and THE RICKY GERVAIS SHOW), but the comedic appeal of TWO BROKE GIRLS isn't quite enough to hold interest since the sitcom aspects are a little tired and the supporting cast just doesn't have much to offer.However, I have nothing but praise for Dennings and Behrs.

It is NOT for younger viewers. The pilot alone should send that message.  And I can see where the claims of racism, etc. come from.  But, if you are willing to acknowledge that all sides are getting shot at fairly, and there isn't real racism, sexism or anything else terrible on display (just uncomfortable at times), then you should enjoy the show.2 Broke Girls certainly pushes boundries, but the show is incredibly funny, and well acted. You can totally side with either girl in any given moment, and it is easy to sympathize with Kat's character ""Max"" when she shows her tender, emotionally-wounded side sometimes, and it is easy to sympathize with Beth's character ""Caroline"" -- pretty much all the time.Yes, the show is raunchy, and yes it can be uncomfortable at times, but it is still hilarious, and like I said, I love Kat Dennings.5 stars.",5,I am in love with Kat Dennings!,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,1497,"['Seriously', 'love', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'deliver', 'snark', 'line', 'line', 'line', 'keep', 'amazingly', 'fresh', 'well', 'delivered', 'great', 'team', 'writers', 'giving', 'AWESOME', 'lines', 'deliver', 'are', 'awesome', 'Even', 'just', 'delivery', 'surprise', 'lines', 'NO', 'WAY', 'awesome.My', 'wife', 'first', 'saw', 'Thor', 'loved', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'liked', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', '2', 'Broke', 'girls', 'alongside', 'Beth', 'Behrs', 'even', 'Beth', 'really', 'just', 'serves', 'primary', 'thing-to-be-mocked.Make', 'mistake', '2', 'Broke', 'Girls', 'raunchy', 'NOT', 'younger', 'viewers', 'pilot', 'alone', 'should', 'send', 'message', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'claims', 'racism', 'etc', 'come', 'are', 'willing', 'acknowledge', 'sides', 'are', 'getting', 'shot', 'fairly', ""n't"", 'real', 'racism', 'sexism', 'anything', 'else', 'terrible', 'display', 'just', 'uncomfortable', 'times', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy', 'show.2', 'Broke', 'Girls', 'certainly', 'boundries', 'show', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'well', 'acted', 'can', 'totally', 'side', 'girl', 'given', 'moment', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'Kat', 'character', 'Max', 'when', 'tender', 'emotionally-wounded', 'side', 'sometimes', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'Beth', 'character', 'Caroline', 'pretty', 'much', 'time.Yes', 'show', 'raunchy', 'yes', 'can', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'times', 'still', 'hilarious', 'said', 'love', 'Kat', 'Dennings.5', 'stars']",2 Broke Girls: The Complete First Season
1440629,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0053O8AQE,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[28, 34]","After an awkward attempt with 'Outsourced' the small screen returns with another sitcom involving the economy. This time, they get it right.This CBS sitcom examines how two 'different' young women attempt to make ends meet  in the current American economy. Max (Kat Dennings) has always been working class, but poverty is a new and really unpleasant surprise for Caroline (Beth Behrs). She had been rich, until her family lost all of it's money from dad's ponzi scheme.The odd-couple friendship successfully works because they are both genuinely likable characters. They are both discovering what the world is currently like while struggling in a low-paying service sector job. This is where the storylines and comedy comes in.Caroline is gennuinely shocked to discover what a 'public dental clinic' looks like. Or some people must delay obtaining their needed treatment altogether until pain is intolerable.But she proactively realized that selling off her massive wardrobe will bring in lots of needed money for the two roomates to live on. She had already started thrift shopping at the local Goodwill.Viewers have watched a 'struggling young roommates' storyline many times before but the creators and writers artfully balance out comedy with economic-political reality here. Timely storylines are entertaining.Becoming low-income is something she had never expected, Caroline is however most challenged when a former boyfriend unexpectedly comes to the dinner where she now works. Having somebody from her former world now seeing her current situation is embarrassing: The rich are not expected to 'work' because of economic wealth and what it means.She however survives to tell the tale. And she discovers real friends like her for who she is, not for how much money she has.Watching this sitcom, I could not help but feel that I was being visited by the ghost of Norman Lear. The 'issue' writing and the character development are that well tuned on current issues without loosing the comedy. It is definitely something which everybody--and not just girls--are going to like watching.",5,Rich Viewing,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,2090,"['awkward', 'attempt', ""'Outsourced"", 'small', 'screen', 'returns', 'sitcom', 'involving', 'economy', 'time', 'get', 'CBS', 'sitcom', 'how', 'two', ""'different"", 'young', 'women', 'attempt', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'current', 'American', 'economy', 'Max', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'always', 'been', 'working', 'class', 'poverty', 'new', 'really', 'unpleasant', 'surprise', 'Caroline', 'Beth', 'Behrs', 'had', 'been', 'rich', 'family', 'lost', 'money', 'dad', 'ponzi', 'scheme.The', 'odd-couple', 'friendship', 'successfully', 'are', 'genuinely', 'likable', 'characters', 'are', 'discovering', 'what', 'world', 'currently', 'struggling', 'low-paying', 'service', 'sector', 'job', 'where', 'storylines', 'comedy', 'in.Caroline', 'gennuinely', 'shocked', 'discover', 'what', ""'public"", 'dental', 'clinic', 'looks', 'people', 'must', 'delay', 'obtaining', 'needed', 'treatment', 'altogether', 'pain', 'intolerable.But', 'proactively', 'realized', 'selling', 'off', 'massive', 'wardrobe', 'will', 'bring', 'lots', 'needed', 'money', 'two', 'roomates', 'live', 'had', 'already', 'started', 'thrift', 'shopping', 'local', 'Goodwill.Viewers', 'have', 'watched', ""'struggling"", 'young', 'roommates', 'storyline', 'many', 'times', 'creators', 'writers', 'artfully', 'balance', 'out', 'comedy', 'economic-political', 'reality', 'here', 'Timely', 'storylines', 'are', 'entertaining.Becoming', 'low-income', 'something', 'had', 'never', 'expected', 'Caroline', 'however', 'most', 'challenged', 'when', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'unexpectedly', 'dinner', 'where', 'now', 'Having', 'somebody', 'former', 'world', 'now', 'seeing', 'current', 'situation', 'embarrassing', 'rich', 'are', 'not', 'expected', ""'work"", 'economic', 'wealth', 'what', 'means.She', 'however', 'tell', 'tale', 'real', 'friends', 'who', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'has.Watching', 'sitcom', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'was', 'being', 'visited', 'ghost', 'Norman', 'Lear', ""'issue"", 'writing', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'well', 'tuned', 'current', 'issues', 'loosing', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'something', 'everybody', 'not', 'just', 'girls', 'are', 'going', 'like', 'watching']",2 Broke Girls: The Complete First Season

1440634,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0053O8AQE,trebe,"[36, 46]","Even in unfortunate situations like the recent scandals that have rocked Wall Street, and affected the future of millions of investors, there are opportunities to create humor.  Created by Michael Patrick King and Whitney Cummings, CBS's 2 Broke Girls, is a comedy set in New York City featuring two women from completely different ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, who come together as coworkers, only because one has lost her fortune, due to her father's involvement in a financial scandal.  This is a well-cast show with pretty good writing, but it is often a little too crude than it needs to be, with frequent references to sex, drugs, and crime.The series stars Kat Demmings as Max Black, a waitress in a small restaurant in Brooklyn.  She's street smart, a little hardened and cynical, and has a bit of a gutter mouth, but underneath that rough and crude exterior, there's a warm caring person.  Beth Behrs is Caroline Channing, a slim blonde beauty who bears more than a passing resemblance to Paris Hilton.  Caroline's father Martin was convicted and sent to prison for his involvement in a financial scandal (think Bernie Madoff).  In the process, the Channing family's financial assets were frozen, leaving Caroline locked out of her luxury apartment, and denied access to her rather substantial trust fund.The setup for the series is established in the first episode, as a desperate Caroline becomes a waitress at the Williamsburg Diner.  Owner Han Lee (Matthew Moy) hires Caroline, teaming her with Max, who is less than enthusiastic with being saddled with someone with zero experience.  Also in the restaurant are Oleg (Jonathan Kite) a cook who sexually harasses the girls, and Earl (Garrett Morris, the venerable SNLer) the lovable cashier.  With no place to live, Max invites Caroline to stay in the apartment that she currently shares with her boyfriend, but after catching him with another woman, Max kicks him out, and Caroline becomes her new roommate.Much of the humor is based on the obvious and pronounced differences between the two girls.  The contrast between the women's attitudes extends far beyond just economic matters, and provides many comic opportunities for the writers.  The writing is generally sharp edged, creative, and pretty clever, although presumably to appeal to a younger audience, heavily infused with vulgarity.  The sexual innuendo is frequently at the gutter level, when it really doesn't need to be.Both lead actresses are well cast, and do a nice job of immersing themselves into their characters.  Kat Demmings (Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, Thor) brings to Max, a realistic working class toughness, surly attitude, a body loaded with ample curves, and often delivers her lines with a cynical scowl.  Behrs has good comic instincts, to go along with a model's figure, and the stereotypical airhead chick voice she employs.  Caroline is a cartoonish character, who sometimes seems semi-detached from reality.  A graduate of Wharton business school, Caroline is particularly bright when it comes to financial matters, and applying her academic rich girl sensibilities to real world situations, is one of the foundations of the program's humor.While the differences between the Caroline and Max establishes a baseline, it is the things that they share in common, and the mutual experiences that bond them together, that makes the show interesting, and gives it some warmth as their friendship grows.  One common interest they share early on, is Caroline's horse Chestnut, who is kept in the backyard of Max's apartment.  The big thing though is their business partnership, as the ladies plan to make a successful business from Max's talent for baking cupcakes.  At the close of each episode, the running total of their financial assets is updated.The characters Han, Oleg, and Earl, are a bit racially stereotyped, and as the season progresses only Oleg really assumes a more significant role.  To perk things up, late in the season the writers introduce Sofi Kachinsky (Jennifer Coolidge), a mysterious woman who lives upstairs in the same building as the girls.  Another ethnically influenced character, Sofi is from Eastern Europe and runs a cleaning service.  Sofi becoming romantically involved with Oleg, provides another bridge between the girl's private life, and the things that happen at work.  The voluptuous Jennifer Coolidge (ExTerminators) is an experienced actress, whose presence strengthens the program, while creating more opportunities for the writers.With a talented and funny cast, 2 Broke Girls is clearly a series with much potential, however the writing exhibits a fixation with profanity, sexual innuendo, and double entendre, that seems to increase as the season progresses.  Even if an increase in vulgarity contributes to the program's popularity, CBS isn't a cable network, and not sinking into the gutter too often, may in the long run, result in the show reaching a larger audience.  The hilarious season finale, which features a guest appearance by Martha Stewart, is absolutely fabulous, and demonstrates that a little more class, and a little less crass, might be a winning approach for this very entertaining program.",4,sassy Max and the hot blonde giraffe...,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,5208,"['Even', 'unfortunate', 'situations', 'recent', 'scandals', 'have',
