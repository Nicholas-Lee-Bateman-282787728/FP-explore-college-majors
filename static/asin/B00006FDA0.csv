They go to the woods on a trip together, find the stone laying out in the open, after holding it they each are given special powers.  You can see a light in their eyes, a different colored light for each one, then they are transformed into evil personnas.They go back to school, show off their new personnas, where they do stuff previously they were not capable of.  But decide to ditch the stone after a friend of theirs is hurt because of its effect on them.The music is good, but pretty basic.  The camerawork is good, but nothing special.

It is enthralling from its opening frame, giving great insight into the lives of today's mystical youth. A goth student named Reese is the only person who wears black, since black is goth, and no one else can possibly pull it off w/ such panache and aplomb. Our dark hero accumulates some friends, and together they find a mysterious rock that glows, just sort of lying on the ground. Reese hears voices, everyone grooves to the magic mineral, and the levitation begins. Reese is deeply effected by the shimmering stone, causing him to use even more snappy sarcasm than usual. THE SURGE has more unforgettable quotes than TROLL 2, more idiotic genius than PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, and far more cloying, insufferable characters than most other films of the past 100 years! The special fx (mostly flashing lights) combine w/ the science-techno-babble, to form a stew of gloppy, paranormal pap, that is a marvel to behold! Just wait until you witness these hellish, angst-ridden, teens using their newly-acquired mind powers! Things get downright freaky deaky from there! The father / son dynamic between Reese and his mush-headed dad is so poignantly accentuated by generic goth music, that it drips sincerity!

Therefore, I'll do the honors of bestowing that information to you.  Reese, the main character, has just moved to a new town with his father and is trying to adjust to life in a school that seems bent on giving him hell in whatever way they possibly can.  After being bullied by some jocks on the corner of street one day, a few kids ride by and offer him a lift.  Afterwards, they venture to a secluded forest where they find a mystic lodestone with the ability to give powers to those who are able to levitate over it.  Reese and the others do so, and after gaining their unique powers they decide to get the school back for all the wrong it's done to them.  However Ashley (who has the ability to control your mind) abuses her powers and in turn decides to go muy loco on the world with her gang of &quot;zombies&quot; who she's gained control of.  Reese and the others must now find a way to stop Ashley from her dastardly plans for taking over the world.Dang, and she would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for those meddling kids...I suppose the acting in this movie was average for a B movie.  Though uninspiring and highly fictitious, the special effects do give this movie some credibility which is what helped give this trash its 2-Star rating.

It does give off a power surge to those who stand over it and gives them some kind of super-human powers, each teen getting a different power, sort of like Fantastic Four light.With their powers they then terrorize the school getting back at the bullies etc. Reese, while Goth, is somewhat level headed.
