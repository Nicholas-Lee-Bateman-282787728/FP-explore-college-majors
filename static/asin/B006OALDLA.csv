1517879,A13NN0XAWEUTSY,B006OALDLA,"Anthony J. Sommer ""AJ in AZ""","[9, 9]","I really liked this film but I'm a geezer and I loved the great black comedies that have sadly gone out of style: the Alec Guinness films of the early 1950s, ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""Catch 22,"" ""Being There"" and the all-time champ ""The Loved One.""A black comedy takes realistic situations (the opening scenes lull you into believing this will be a classic Western) and realistic characters and stretches them to absurd conclusions. Some of the reviewers here show they tried to take this film as a serious ""High Noon"" type of western and dissed it because it wasn't: ""There's not enough words"" (there were exactly enough).Look: The gunfighter (Cohen Holloway) kidnaps the pretty Englishwoman (Inge Rademeyer) and takes her out on the prairie to rape her. He tries but he can't get it up. THAT scene right there should have been your signal because it set the tone for the whole rest of the movie. So, dragging her along, he begins a quest to find a cure (for you younger viewers, Viagra didn't come along until more than 100 years later), consulting MDs, Chinese herbal doctors, an Indian medicine man, all the while being pursued by a very inept posse with a leader so dumb he shoots his scout (""I said I was a scout. I didn't say I was any good at it."") and the posse then becomes hopelessly lost.The final big gunfight between the gunfighter (who has by now won the sympathy of both Inge and the audience) and the posse members (who, after rescuing the girl now want to rape her) hits a hilarious snag when all of the participants run out of ammunition at exactly the same time.It's black comedy, people, and a very good one!

Even if it is just a western.And I didn't intend to watch this drivel-fest, but it was on &#34;free&#34; TV, and unfortunately it was on television today -- on the same channel in which my HD box was already set -- and more unfortunately, I didn't change channels.  It was probably that I was simply too lazy.I thought at first that this film starred Jennifer Connelly, but unfortunately that suspect Academy Award-winning actress is not in this film.  Or is that fortunately?  Either way, I guess the &#34;star&#34; here is Inge Rademeyer, but no matter.  No one could have saved this disaster, even an &#34;Oscar winner&#34; such as Ms. Connelly.  The writing is probably more atrocious than the acting, but I may be splitting hairs.  And the director surely wasn't far behind.Everything is manipulative:  the situations; the music; you name it.  And so I'll have to recommend the following:  when something calls itself &#34;Good for Nothing,&#34; take it at its word.

And immdiately it is obvious, the dialogue, acting, seriousness, tone, musical score, scenery, realism, originality and more, were ON-PAR, if not above almost any western I can think of... even, (gasp) Unforgiven.I was drawn in to the professionalism of the production... atention to every detail was given, cinematography and locations shot were amazingly beautiful yet harsly barren, the characters were impeckable, the sincerety, drama, details, everything.  This movie really brings home the true dangers of those lawless times.  Everything in this movie is not only believable, but draws you in, and puts you right there with the characters.  This is REALISM at it's best.I applaud the producers and directors for making a modern day western that isn't a hollywood shootem'up, or re-hash of a half-popular old western.  This movie will have your heart pounding, leave your jaw dropped, and put tears in your eyes.  There is suspense and surprises all along the way.  Well done, casual pace, but not a single boring moment.  THIS is how I envision the wild west must have really been like.This should be a western everyone should see..

1517888,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B006OALDLA,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[2, 5]","It's hard to review this movie because I didn't hate it but it had a lot of issues. It was okay to watch even though it was a bit slow but I enjoyed the characters and the scenery was nice but to me there just wasn't enough happening.The movie starts off with a bang. Isabelle is kidnapped by The Man and taken off into the desert where he tries to rape her. He can't because he has ED but instead of letting Isabelle go, he drags her along with him to a lot of meaningless spots and destinations as he tries to find a cure for his ED so he can finally get it on with Isabelle.The plot was definitely different from most westerns but there wasn't enough going on. Once Isabelle and The Man started on their journey the film comes to a standstill. The Man doesn't even speak to Isabelle until twenty minutes after the movie is on and he doesn't say a word for the first ten minutes so you wonder if he's a mute or if something else is wrong. Then all of a sudden The Man murders the sheriff's brother or son or whatever so the sheriff and his gang spend 90 minutes galloping across the desert to find The Man and Isabelle. This part seemed just thrown in because the writer realized there wasn't enough going on.It's like the writer just ran out of ideas. He had the basic plot but with tons of empty space which ends up making the movie unnecessary.I couldn't get Isabelle. She didn't act frightened in the least. She only tried to get away from The Man about twice then gave up. I understand she was in the desert but wouldn't she try her best to get away? It was so unrealistic. I couldn't understand how emotionless this woman was. People get shot around her and she doesn't shed a tear or show any fear. The Man tries to rape her and she isn't even shaken up! What does she do? She ends up traipsing (looked like willingly) around with her almost-rapist draped in her underwear. This is when my eyes rolled into the back of my head. Back in those days women didn't even show their undies to their husbands. A woman (especially one as prim and proper as Isabelle) would never have walked around half-naked with a man who not only she didn't know but that tried to rape her. Where was her fear? She acted like she was on a picnic. She wasn't terrified at all. I didn't understand that.I also don't understand why this is classified as a romance. There was nothing romantic between the two. The Man just wants to rape Isabelle and Isabelle hates him. Where is this romance? Sure they ""kinda"" bond at the end of the film but then it's over. There wasn't any obvious signs of a romance brewing especially on Isabelle's end. She keeps the same scowl on her face when she speaks to The Man that she had when he first took her. So the romance is lost on me. I wish the movie had spent more time on building a romance (even though it would've been weird)than having these two ride around mindlessly with no point.Also I have an issue with how the men are depicted in this film. I'm a woman but I was still kinda offended. This movie makes all men look like barbaric rapists. Every single man Isabelle encountered except three tried to rape her. I found it ridiculous. Sure back in western days you had men who preyed on women but this was just too much. I could buy The Man stealing her away and trying to rape her, fine. But after that it became tedious. Even the deputy tried to rape her! It just didn't make sense and was just offensive. I can't see how any man who watches this movie wouldn't see that fact.I thought the acting was well done but there needed to be more action and more things happening besides The Man riding around to cure his ED for 90 minutes.And the next time this writer/director wants to make a romance he needs to make sure it actually is one.",2,Hard to Say,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,3766,"['hard', 'review', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'had', 'lot', 'issues', 'was', 'okay', 'watch', 'even', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'scenery', 'was', 'nice', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'happening.The', 'movie', 'bang', 'Isabelle', 'kidnapped', 'Man', 'taken', 'off', 'desert', 'where', 'rape', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'ED', 'instead', 'letting', 'Isabelle', 'go', 'along', 'lot', 'meaningless', 'spots', 'destinations', 'find', 'cure', 'ED', 'can', 'finally', 'get', 'Isabelle.The', 'plot', 'was', 'definitely', 'different', 'most', 'westerns', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'going', 'Once', 'Isabelle', 'Man', 'started', 'journey', 'film', 'standstill', 'Man', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'Isabelle', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'wonder', 'mute', 'something', 'else', 'wrong', 'Then', 'sudden', 'Man', 'sheriff', 'brother', 'son', 'so', 'sheriff', 'gang', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'galloping', 'desert', 'find', 'Man', 'Isabelle', 'part', 'seemed', 'just', 'thrown', 'writer', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'going', 'writer', 'just', 'ran', 'ideas', 'had', 'basic', 'plot', 'tons', 'empty', 'space', 'up', 'making', 'movie', 'unnecessary.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Isabelle', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'frightened', 'least', 'only', 'tried', 'get', 'away', 'Man', 'twice', 'then', 'gave', 'up', 'understand', 'was', 'desert', 'would', ""n't"", 'try', 'best', 'get', 'away', 'was', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'emotionless', 'woman', 'was', 'People', 'get', 'shot', ""n't"", 'shed', 'tear', 'show', 'fear', 'Man', 'rape', ""n't"", 'even', 'shaken', 'up', 'What', 'do', 'up', 'traipsing', 'looked', 'willingly', 'almost-rapist', 'draped', 'underwear', 'when', 'eyes', 'rolled', 'back', 'head', 'Back', 'days', 'women', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'undies', 'husbands', 'woman', 'especially', 'one', 'prim', 'proper', 'Isabelle', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'walked', 'half-naked', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'tried', 'rape', 'Where', 'was', 'fear', 'acted', 'was', 'picnic', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrified', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'that.I', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'classified', 'romance', 'was', 'nothing', 'romantic', 'two', 'Man', 'just', 'rape', 'Isabelle', 'Isabelle', 'Where', 'romance', 'Sure', 'kinda', 'bond', 'end', 'film', 'then', 'over', 'was', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'signs', 'romance', 'brewing', 'especially', 'Isabelle', 'end', 'same', 'scowl', 'face', 'when', 'Man', 'had', 'when', 'first', 'took', 'romance', 'lost', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'building', 'romance', 'even', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'weird', 'having', 'two', 'ride', 'mindlessly', 'point.Also', 'have', 'issue', 'how', 'men', 'are', 'depicted', 'film', ""'m"", 'woman', 'was', 'still', 'kinda', 'offended', 'movie', 'men', 'look', 'barbaric', 'rapists', 'single', 'man', 'Isabelle', 'encountered', 'three', 'tried', 'rape', 'found', 'ridiculous', 'Sure', 'back', 'western', 'days', 'had', 'men', 'who', 'preyed', 'women', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'could', 'buy', 'Man', 'stealing', 'away', 'trying', 'rape', 'fine', 'became', 'tedious', 'Even', 'deputy', 'tried', 'rape', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'was', 'just', 'offensive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'man', 'who', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'fact.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'there', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'things', 'happening', 'Man', 'riding', 'around', 'cure', 'ED', '90', 'next', 'time', 'writer/director', 'make', 'romance', 'make', 'sure', 'actually', 'one']",Good For Nothing

Against everyone's wishes she moved and wishes to start her life in the wild western town. While out on her own a cowboy (Holloway) sees her and attempts to have his way with her. Frustrated when he isn't able to, he decides to kidnap her and keep her until he is able to function again. This is another in the long list of unimpressive and drawn out westerns. I'm not sure what happened to this genre but why is it so hard to make a good one anymore? Unlike most of the recent entries this one isn't really cheesy, just seems to have no point. The closest I can come to thinking what the plot is is a cowboy tries to rape a strange woman...then they start to fall in love. Not really sure what else was going on but I was really bored with this one. I am still waiting for a good western to come out. To me ""Open Range"" was the last good one. Overall, drawn out and boring, much like the last 10 or so westerns that have come out. I give it a C-.",2,"Another long and drawn out disappointing western. Could have been worse, but not much.
