1111100,A2QLRY6MOOYZ8W,B000WOYSBQ,Arthur,"[13, 17]","A really fun ""sci-fi"" serial from the fifties.  All the episodes are included, which is actually why I bought this set, instead of having to order two separate discs when it seemed like one or the other was always missing.  I've always been a sucker for these campy types of things, but I was pleasantly surprised when my kids, ages 2 and 4, got into the series as well. And how can you argue with an American Commando using a jetpack to foil an alien dictator who took over the moon?",5,"Kid-tested, Father-approved!",1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,484,"['really', 'fun', 'sci-fi', 'serial', 'fifties', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'actually', 'why', 'bought', 'set', 'instead', 'having', 'order', 'two', 'separate', 'discs', 'when', 'seemed', 'one', 'other', 'was', 'always', 'missing', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'sucker', 'campy', 'types', 'things', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'kids', '2', '4', 'got', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'can', 'argue', 'American', 'Commando', 'using', 'jetpack', 'foil', 'alien', 'dictator', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'moon']",Radar Men From The Moon: Complete Collection

1111102,A1GQGYROVZVW49,B000WOYSBQ,P. Schmidt,"[10, 11]","This item is supposed to be the complete 12 episode collection of Radar Men From the Moon, a 1950s movie serial. It comes on three DVDs. It is supposed to be remastered.When I received this item, it was in two separate DVD cases, one with a single disk, the other with two disks. The disks are recordable DVD, not factory produced ones. The DVD artwork is poorly printed on using an inkjet printer, and is off-center with the disk, has lines where the printer was not printing, and general looks like some kid made it at home.The video itself looks like somebody with the old VHS tape set of the series simply burned them to the disks using their home DVD recorder, and probably should have cleaned the VHS tape deck heads first. My own VHS copy of the  series looks better than these DVDs. There is no evidence of any ""remastering"" having been done. If whoever made these thinks sucking the video into a computer, adding menus, and burning disks is 'remastering', they are wrong. That is not what is meant in the film & DVD industry by this term.While the second and third disks seem to at least play correctly for me, having episodes 6 - 12 between them, disk 1 has a menu for ""Other Items"" and ""Episodes"". Supposedly if you select Episodes with your remote you will see menu selections for Episodes 1 - 5. On my disk I cannot select the ""Episodes"" menu item at all, because the disk is programmed to only allow me to select ""Other Items"", and even when selected the screen just regenerates back to the same menu. Somebody else commented in their review that they needed to make the selection within 30 seconds or else would have to remove the disk and reinsert it in order to get the menu to work. As soon as I get this menu on my equipment (I have two recently made Panasonic machines available to me), I try to select the ""Episodes"" but cannot even then...The disk is programmed to show a copyright warning for at least 10 seconds and then a disclaimer screen for a while longer, before showing the menu screen. Perhaps those count against the 30 second selection window? If so, I am not fast enough to select it. In any case, this is just wrong.A2ZDCS should not have put this on the market with such an unprofessional DVD design.",1,Disappointing item,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,2236,"['item', 'supposed', 'be', 'complete', '12', 'episode', 'collection', 'Radar', 'Men', 'Moon', '1950s', 'movie', 'serial', 'three', 'DVDs', 'supposed', 'be', 'remastered.When', 'received', 'item', 'was', 'two', 'separate', 'DVD', 'cases', 'one', 'single', 'disk', 'other', 'two', 'disks', 'disks', 'are', 'recordable', 'DVD', 'not', 'factory', 'produced', 'ones', 'DVD', 'artwork', 'poorly', 'printed', 'using', 'inkjet', 'printer', 'off-center', 'disk', 'lines', 'where', 'printer', 'was', 'not', 'printing', 'general', 'looks', 'kid', 'made', 'home.The', 'video', 'somebody', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'set', 'series', 'simply', 'burned', 'disks', 'using', 'home', 'DVD', 'recorder', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'cleaned', 'VHS', 'tape', 'deck', 'heads', 'first', 'own', 'VHS', 'copy', 'series', 'better', 'DVDs', 'evidence', 'remastering', 'having', 'been', 'done', 'whoever', 'made', 'thinks', 'sucking', 'video', 'computer', 'adding', 'menus', 'burning', 'disks', ""'remastering"", 'are', 'wrong', 'not', 'what', 'meant', 'film', 'DVD', 'industry', 'term.While', 'second', 'third', 'disks', 'seem', 'least', 'play', 'correctly', 'having', 'episodes', '6', '12', 'disk', '1', 'menu', 'Other', 'Items', 'Episodes', 'Supposedly', 'select', 'Episodes', 'remote', 'will', 'see', 'menu', 'selections', 'Episodes', '1', '5', 'disk', 'can', 'not', 'select', 'Episodes', 'menu', 'item', 'disk', 'programmed', 'only', 'allow', 'select', 'Other', 'Items', 'even', 'when', 'selected', 'screen', 'just', 'back', 'same', 'menu', 'Somebody', 'else', 'commented', 'review', 'needed', 'make', 'selection', '30', 'seconds', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'remove', 'disk', 'reinsert', 'order', 'get', 'menu', 'work', 'As', 'soon', 'get', 'menu', 'equipment', 'have', 'two', 'recently', 'made', 'Panasonic', 'machines', 'available', 'try', 'select', 'Episodes', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'then', 'disk', 'programmed', 'show', 'copyright', 'warning', 'least', '10', 'seconds', 'then', 'disclaimer', 'screen', 'while', 'longer', 'showing', 'menu', 'screen', 'Perhaps', 'count', '30', 'second', 'selection', 'window', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'fast', 'enough', 'select', 'case', 'just', 'wrong.A2ZDCS', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'put', 'market', 'unprofessional', 'DVD', 'design']",Radar Men From The Moon: Complete Collection
