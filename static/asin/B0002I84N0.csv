Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 5]","ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ... sorry, I feel like I could doze off right now and we haven't even made it to the meat of the review. That should give you a quick idea of what I thought of this film. This film was blander than the sugar-free bread we eat at this house. There was no suspenseful moments, there was absolutely nothing to laugh about (other than the sheer stupidity of this film), and the chemistry was horrible. How does a director expect us to sit through an hour and a half of this without hiring two actors that actually seem like they enjoy being together, or that they would realistically meet in real life. I never once imagined Moore and Bronson as a couple, and unfortunately, this film did not strengthen my imagination.So, where did this film go wrong? To start with the characters would mean having to talk about Moore and her inability to be funny. She is not a comic actress. She commands the screen in her dramatic roles, but brings nothing to her humorous side. There was a moment during the film when I thought I could see her ""humor"" on/off button. It was hard to distinguish between Moore the actress and Moore the dehumanized robot that attempted to provide humor to this dry piece of crust I like to call Laws of Attraction. It was pathetic, and at times ""silly"". It was not helped by the fact that Brosnan didn't even bother putting any effort into his role. I think that is what bothered me the most about the characters, they were not complex (though they tried to be), they were not entertaining, and they were not challenges on the actors part to portray. I enjoy a film so much better when actors go beyond their normal stroke of acting ability and provide something of substance and intrigue. The only aspect of this film that I was intrigued about was the ending credits.How many times have we seen this story? For those that argue that Hollywood brings us unique and crisp stories with each production should see this film. This film felt like a cinematic representation of an Alley McBeal episode. There was even the scene with the unisex bathroom ... did nobody see this connection? There was nothing special about this film. Normally, when I write these reviews I have at least one positive note to bring to the table, but with this film, there was nothing. From beginning to end, this film was horrible. The director must have known that it was an overplayed story because he literally rushed through this story. It reminded me of a child's first time with a woman, rushed and fumbled they try to make it to the end, but never really succeed in satisfying anyone. I hated and cringed every time Woods' mother was on screen. Her parts were underdeveloped, dull, and unnecessary to the story of the film. She was filler, nothing more. I kept looking for something, anything that I could bite down on and taste the flavor of this film, but all I seemed to find was gristle and fat (a meat joke for those carnivores out there).Overall, there was nothing redeeming of this film at all, and I can now fully understand why it rushed directly to the silver screen and even faster to the video release. I can now fully understand why there were so many copies for me to choose from at the store. I guess others discovered the truth about Laws of Attraction, and why the box oddly smelled like curdled cheese.Grade: * out of *****",1,Well that spoiled it for me.,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,3357,"['ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ', 'sorry', 'feel', 'could', 'doze', 'off', 'right', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'made', 'meat', 'review', 'should', 'give', 'quick', 'idea', 'what', 'thought', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'blander', 'sugar-free', 'bread', 'eat', 'house', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'was', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'other', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'film', 'chemistry', 'was', 'horrible', 'How', 'director', 'expect', 'sit', 'hour', 'half', 'hiring', 'two', 'actors', 'actually', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'being', 'together', 'would', 'realistically', 'meet', 'real', 'life', 'never', 'once', 'imagined', 'Moore', 'Bronson', 'couple', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'strengthen', 'imagination.So', 'where', 'did', 'film', 'go', 'wrong', 'start', 'characters', 'would', 'mean', 'having', 'talk', 'Moore', 'inability', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'comic', 'actress', 'screen', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'nothing', 'humorous', 'side', 'was', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'thought', 'could', 'see', 'humor', 'button', 'was', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'Moore', 'actress', 'Moore', 'dehumanized', 'robot', 'attempted', 'provide', 'humor', 'dry', 'piece', 'crust', 'like', 'call', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'was', 'pathetic', 'times', 'silly', 'was', 'not', 'helped', 'fact', 'Brosnan', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'putting', 'effort', 'role', 'think', 'what', 'bothered', 'most', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'complex', 'tried', 'be', 'were', 'not', 'entertaining', 'were', 'not', 'challenges', 'actors', 'part', 'portray', 'enjoy', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'actors', 'go', 'normal', 'stroke', 'acting', 'ability', 'provide', 'something', 'substance', 'intrigue', 'only', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'intrigued', 'was', 'ending', 'credits.How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'story', 'argue', 'Hollywood', 'unique', 'crisp', 'stories', 'production', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'film', 'felt', 'cinematic', 'representation', 'Alley', 'McBeal', 'episode', 'was', 'even', 'scene', 'unisex', 'bathroom', 'did', 'nobody', 'see', 'connection', 'was', 'nothing', 'special', 'film', 'Normally', 'when', 'write', 'reviews', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'positive', 'note', 'bring', 'table', 'film', 'was', 'nothing', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'horrible', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'overplayed', 'story', 'literally', 'rushed', 'story', 'reminded', 'child', 'first', 'time', 'woman', 'rushed', 'fumbled', 'try', 'make', 'end', 'never', 'really', 'succeed', 'satisfying', 'anyone', 'hated', 'cringed', 'time', 'Woods', 'mother', 'was', 'screen', 'parts', 'were', 'underdeveloped', 'dull', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'filler', 'nothing', 'more', 'kept', 'looking', 'something', 'anything', 'could', 'bite', 'down', 'taste', 'flavor', 'film', 'seemed', 'find', 'was', 'gristle', 'fat', 'meat', 'joke', 'carnivores', 'out', 'there', '.Overall', 'was', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'film', 'can', 'now', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'rushed', 'directly', 'silver', 'screen', 'even', 'faster', 'video', 'release', 'can', 'now', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'copies', 'choose', 'store', 'guess', 'others', 'discovered', 'truth', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'why', 'box', 'oddly', 'smelled', 'curdled', 'cheese.Grade', '*', '*****']",N/A
835224,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B0002I84N0,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[8, 8]","Did Hugh Grant and George Clooney turn this one down?  The perky and smart LAWS OF ATTRACTION starts out great, but the p-and-v dialog and perky plot don't (perhaps can't) hold up through the latter two-thirds of the movie.The story clangs together sophisticated British-American attorney Daniel Rafferty (Pierce Brosnan) and Manhattan's best divorce lawyer, Audrey Woods (Julianne Moore).  The wife of a successful, punk-style singer (played straight from her gut to our funny bone by the ever-amazing Parker Posey) wants a divorce, and goes to Woods for legal advice.  However, she finally settles on Rafferty while Woods winds up representing the rocker husband (a satire on every mascara'ed punker since Alice Cooper, raucously played by Michael Sheen).  The his-and-hers take on plaintiff and defendant brings to mind the classic ADAM'S RIB (1949) and of course the George Clooney-Katharine Zeta-Jones vehicle INTOLERABLE CRUELTY, but with a twist:  here Brosnan's Rafferty is the immovable object, usually managing to stay calm and collected and one step ahead of Moore's Woods, a frenetic, goal-driven, attention-disordered Gothamite (and obviously sexually deprived) yuppie.The tempo definitely lags and the tone gets a little mushy when both advocates have to Aer Lingus their way to Ireland to despose the household staff of the enormous castle that rocker-and-wife bought and lovingly restored before they went splitsville.  It just so happens that the neighboring village is having its annual festival; in a clever she-said he-said cut the female housekeeper describes the affair to Audrey Woods as ""sooo romantic"" while a butler sums it up for Daniel Rafferty as ""a good excuse for a three-day boozer.""Romantic it is, but Erin goes Bragh-less at the boozer when the competing attorneys wake up thinking themselves hitched!  (LOVER COME BACK, anyone?).  Back in Manhattan, Rafferty and Woods have to deal with their ambiguous emotions in light of their new marital status.  Welcome comic relief intrudes when the grandstanding rock'n'roller and spurned wife battle like Bickersons in open court, to the consternation of a Judge Judy-like jurist (the formidable Nora Dunn).The very end of the film (technically a fourth act, since the usual structure didn't reconcile everyone's problems) is set back in Ireland.  I don't want to ruin it, but I will say that it recovers some of the pace, dialog and irreverent tone of LAWS OF ATTRACTION'S first act.All in all, a pretty good time at the movies, though I can't help but wish that the comic tone that set the barre for the first act had held throughout the whole affair.  But it's fun, it's smart, it's modern, and Frances Fischer as Audrey's fashionista mom is delightful icing on the cake.  For households with kids, there is one clothes-on-the-floor scene leading to the (invisible) bedroom, but on the whole wit trumps raunch, making the film enjoyable to a wide audience.",4,"Starts Out Great, Ends Up Just Good--",1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,2936,"['Did', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'George', 'Clooney', 'turn', 'one', 'down', 'perky', 'smart', 'LAWS', 'OF', 'ATTRACTION', 'out', 'great', 'p-and-v', 'dialog', 'perky', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'perhaps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'latter', 'two-thirds', 'movie.The', 'story', 'clangs', 'together', 'sophisticated', 'British-American', 'attorney', 'Daniel', 'Rafferty', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Manhattan', 'best', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'Audrey', 'Woods', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'wife', 'successful', 'punk-style', 'singer', 'played', 'straight', 'gut', 'funny', 'bone', 'ever-amazing', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'divorce', 'Woods', 'legal', 'advice', 'However', 'finally', 'Rafferty', 'Woods', 'up', 'representing', 'rocker', 'husband', 'satire', ""mascara'ed"", 'punker', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'raucously', 'played', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'his-and-hers', 'take', 'plaintiff', 'defendant', 'brings', 'mind', 'classic', 'ADAM', 'RIB', '1949', 'course', 'George', 'Clooney-Katharine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'vehicle', 'INTOLERABLE', 'CRUELTY', 'twist', 'here', 'Brosnan', 'Rafferty', 'immovable', 'object', 'usually', 'managing', 'stay', 'calm', 'collected', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Moore', 'Woods', 'frenetic', 'goal-driven', 'attention-disordered', 'Gothamite', 'obviously', 'sexually', 'deprived', 'yuppie.The', 'tempo', 'definitely', 'lags', 'tone', 'little', 'mushy', 'when', 'advocates', 'have', 'Aer', 'Lingus', 'way', 'Ireland', 'despose', 'household', 'staff', 'enormous', 'castle', 'rocker-and-wife', 'bought', 'lovingly', 'restored', 'went', 'splitsville', 'just', 'so', 'neighboring', 'village', 'having', 'annual', 'festival', 'clever', 'she-said', 'he-said', 'cut', 'female', 'housekeeper', 'affair', 'Audrey', 'Woods', 'sooo', 'romantic', 'butler', 'sums', 'up', 'Daniel', 'Rafferty', 'good', 'excuse', 'three-day', 'boozer', 'Romantic', 'Erin', 'Bragh-less', 'boozer', 'when', 'competing', 'attorneys', 'wake', 'up', 'thinking', 'hitched', 'LOVER', 'COME', 'BACK', 'anyone', 'Back', 'Manhattan', 'Rafferty', 'Woods', 'have', 'deal', 'ambiguous', 'emotions', 'light', 'new', 'marital', 'status', 'Welcome', 'comic', 'relief', 'intrudes', 'when', 'grandstanding', 'rock', ""n'roller"", 'spurned', 'wife', 'battle', 'Bickersons', 'open', 'court', 'consternation', 'Judge', 'Judy-like', 'jurist', 'formidable', 'Nora', 'Dunn', '.The', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'technically', 'fourth', 'act', 'usual', 'structure', 'did', ""n't"", 'reconcile', 'everyone', 'problems', 'set', 'back', 'Ireland', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'will', 'say', 'pace', 'dialog', 'irreverent', 'tone', 'LAWS', 'OF', 'ATTRACTION', 'first', 'act.All', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', 'comic', 'tone', 'set', 'barre', 'first', 'act', 'had', 'held', 'whole', 'affair', 'fun', 'smart', 'modern', 'Frances', 'Fischer', 'Audrey', 'fashionista', 'mom', 'delightful', 'icing', 'cake', 'households', 'kids', 'one', 'clothes-on-the-floor', 'scene', 'leading', 'invisible', 'bedroom', 'whole', 'wit', 'trumps', 'raunch', 'making', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'wide', 'audience']",N/A

An oft-Oscar nominated actress, she's also hugely talented. I think ""Laws of Attraction"" is her first rom-com. And she really shines here as Audrey Woods, a successful New York divorce attorney who practices law by the book, is a no-nonsense go-getter and someone who does not date (because ""it's a trial marriage"" and she doesn't believe in marriages). When she lands a multi-million dollar case representing a heavy-metal rocker (Michael Sheen) who is sued for divorce by his wife (played by Posey Parker), Audrey's organized world (professional and emotional-wise) is turned upside-down when she is pitted against her polar opposite in the courtroom, the suave and unfathomable Daniel Rafferty (Pierce Brosnan). This is a rom-com, so don't expect much originality in the storyline... or the ending. But these are some of the plus-points of the movie:-1) the perfect, almost electric-like CHEMISTRY between Audrey and Daniel. I just loved to watch them talk, debate, 'fight', kiss.... They're so beautiful together.2) it features a medieval Irish castle (a property coveted by both clients). So expect scenes of lush, beautiful Ireland!!3) a good screenplay. The situations are never boring and the dialogue not (too) cliche like in many other movies of this type. You will find yourself rooting for the 2 main characters to stay together. There are funny scenes to make you laugh and romantic scenes to make you cry.There is an alternate ending featured on the DVD. I personally feel that it makes for a better ending than the one used in the film. Reason: It's more romantic and is set in Ireland. I figure since it's in Ireland that Audrey and Daniel truly fell in love with each other, then the final scene should take place in Ireland too (rather than in Chinatown, NY as in the actual film).There are many rom-coms released in recent years which are real 'duds' (think ""Maid in Manhattan"" - zilch chemistry between J.Lo and Ralph Fiennes, ""Two Weeks Notice"" - which suffers from the same fate, and ""Serendipity"" - the worst, most cliche of its genre, ever!).But ""Laws of Attraction"" is a real jewel. I also like it better than ""Intolerable Cruelty"", another very good rom-com set in the courtroom. I think that a genuine chemistry between the 2 leads is the no. 1 factor in the success of a rom-com. And ""Laws of Attraction"" has plenty of this.

She plays Audrey, a top divorce attorney who manages to appear by-the-book even when she's completely insecure. With her hair in a tight bun and her perfect, subtle suit, she's putting on a front, and Moore milks this for every funny moment she can get.Brosnan, playing her rumpled rival attorney Daniel, oozes sexiness, as well, by getting Audrey to love him by completely annoying her and catching her off-guard. He understands that the only way this woman will accept love is if it completely blindsides her, and he takes steps to do just that.The supporting cast, particularly Frances Fisher as Audrey's plastic surgery-enhanced mother, is really strong, though I feel better use could've been made of Parker Posey, who has some funny lines in this but has been much, much better elsewhere.As an homage to the Hepburn-Tracy movies, ""Laws of Attraction"" falls short. Building momentum through the chief characters' rivalry/romance, it sorta derails when the plot moves the action to Ireland instead of New York.

Why have organic love in films when we can laugh at characters for marrying their arch nemesis.  And by ""we"" I mean women because that is clearly who this film is aimed at.  They want to believe that they are as adorable as Julianne Moore and that it's somehow not their fault that they can't get a date.  That is until a guy looking like Pierce Brosnan walks into their lives.  They also want to believe that they can find a guy who looks great even if his clothes are wrinkled, and who is successful even without selling out to The Man.  What results here is a film that has good, but not overly good acting and is watchable but only barely.  The first half of the film relies on the Adam's Rib style of Battle of the Sexes, and that works to a degree.  The second half is a total snoozefest that involves a trip to Ireland and the marriage they advertised so heavily in the previews.  At the end of the film I found myself admiring it for its sentiment more than for it's entertainment.  Maybe it's a good thing to be reminded that just because we pretend that marrying in a haze and divorcing in a flash are painless does not make them so. **1/2",2,No Teeth No Edge,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,1280,"['seeing', 'film', 'occurred', 'maybe', 'people', 'really', 'do', 'want', 'love', 'stories', 'be', 'gigantic', 'contrivances', 'Why', 'have', 'organic', 'love', 'films', 'when', 'can', 'laugh', 'characters', 'marrying', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'mean', 'women', 'clearly', 'who', 'film', 'aimed', 'want', 'believe', 'are', 'as', 'adorable', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'somehow', 'not', 'fault', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'date', 'guy', 'looking', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'walks', 'lives', 'also', 'want', 'believe', 'can', 'find', 'guy', 'who', 'great', 'even', 'clothes', 'are', 'wrinkled', 'who', 'successful', 'even', 'selling', 'out', 'Man', 'What', 'results', 'here', 'film', 'good', 'not', 'overly', 'good', 'acting', 'watchable', 'only', 'barely', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'relies', 'Adam', 'Rib', 'style', 'Battle', 'Sexes', 'degree', 'second', 'half', 'total', 'snoozefest', 'trip', 'Ireland', 'marriage', 'advertised', 'so', 'heavily', 'previews', 'end', 'film', 'found', 'admiring', 'sentiment', 'more', 'entertainment', 'good', 'thing', 'be', 'reminded', 'just', 'pretend', 'marrying', 'haze', 'divorcing', 'flash', 'are', 'painless', 'not', 'make', 'so', '**1/2']",N/A

835242,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,B0002I84N0,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[5, 5]","Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore lock horns over a huge divorce case between a philandering rock star and his clothing designer wife.  Both are excellent lawyers and both are con men under their skins.  Brosnan is the superior con man but Moore rises to meet the challenge.  Throw in a sumptuous castle in Ireland and these two find themselves married after a night of heavy drinking and festivities.  Brosnan wants to keep the marriage.  Moore does not.More than a little part of whether you will enjoy this movie or not depends on whether you find Brosnan's charm and shenanigans endearing or not.  Much of the humor is found in Moore's neurotic behavior and her boiling under the surface reactions to her continually falling into Brosnan's traps.  (Many find the lovely and eccentric Ireland presented here very funny and endearing in and of itself.  Others are immune to the vapers of this romantic Ireland and so may find the movie a little weak.)  The writing is witty and devilish without being overly sophisticated or literary.  The overt message that marriages are worth fighting for is positively reactionary in our divorce weary world.  That may be a little to close to home for some in the movie-going public.  On the other hand, every married person has woke up in the morning to wonder just who is this person I married.  We spend the rest of our days trying to understand and love our spouse.  Sometimes one of us is quite bad at it.  That's where a little charm and a sense of humor can bridge the gap.This movie is much better than many would lead you to believe.  Predictable?  I suppose.  Funny?  You bet.  Ridiculous?  All over the place.  .  You note that in many review guides that some films that start with two stars grow over the years to three stars and even eventually four.

835244,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0002I84N0,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[8, 15]","There are two genres in the cinema that have a hard time staying fresh: the first one is the sports movie, the other is the romantic comedy.  Sports movies are basically will they win or will they lose.  Romantic comedies are stuck with the premise that two adorable people are destined to be together and since it's a comedy they can spend the whole movie looking for each other but in the end they must be drawn together.  If they broke up the cute little comedy would be a tragedy, and what self-respecting romantic would want that.  The only real way to lift films like these out of the conventional is to give us characters that are charming and/or pleasant to be around and/or a gimmick to pull us in.The new film LAWS OF ATTRACTION, does neither. It just sits there, an incoherent mess that would have improved if those involved would have taken the time and energy to realize they had a stinker on their hands.  It's poorly written, the dialogue rings false and feels stilted, and the charming couple we should be rooting doesn't have enough chemistry to make ice.In LAWS Juilianne Moore stars as Audrey, the top divorce lawyer in New York City.  She hasn't lost a case yet,  (I sometimes wonder if there is such a lawyer in the country), that is until she meets the dashing Daniel Rafferty (Pierce Brosnan) a divorce lawyer that seems to be her equal.  The two meet, get drunk, make love, and get the cases of their careers, against each other.  Can the fates draw them together?  Can they survive this case when they're obviously in love?  Can they survive getting drunk and married?  This movie will answer these questions exactly how you think they will.With all the scripts running around Hollywood I wonder how this one got made. I wonder who thought this was a multimillion-dollar idea.  I'd also like to meet the casting director who thought that Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore would make a great match.  I also wonder why these actors wanted to make this movie?The main problem with the film is that it lacks any real heart.  Sure there are plenty of sentimental moments, inspirational speeches about the sanctity of marriage and the bonds of love, but it does nothing with them because the film hopelessly meanders through plot setup after plot setup, without any real rhyme or reason.  Every moment, every word, and every character motivation is used simply to get us to the end and provide bad sitcom-like one-liners and over-dramatic scenes of tension.Director Peter Howitt has done romantic comedy before with so much more splash.  His delightful SLIDING DOOR offered something new and different.  The only nice words I have to say to him is that it looks great. From the interesting opening shots of the New York skyline to the lush hills of Ireland, he delivers cut picture perfect postcards of all the locations.  But you'll probably ask the same question I did, why the heck did they go to Ireland in the first place?Poor Julianne Moore is wasted in this film.  She plays her part with an almost reckless charm.  The script calls her to be neurotic at one moment, smart and sassy the next and bubbly like a cheerleader most of the time.  The script asks her to look sexy in business suits and pretty in dresses but not to act like a human being.  There is no depth to Audrey.  She's stupid.  I kept wondering why she played the character so flighty.  Moore is a talented actress who still has many great roles ahead of her.  I hope this movie was made just so she could buy a bigger house or maybe a third Porsche.  Please Ms. Moore don't sell you talent out to the Hollywood.Brosnan on the other hand acts so holier-than-thou throughout you wonder if it was stipulated in his contract that he not show off any of his flaws.  His character is so poorly written you wonder how he even got the nerve to play it.  If I had been in it I would have constantly asked the director what am I doing here.  Poor Brosnan, I'd love him to play a dashing villain sometime, for me please.I think LAWS OF ATTRACTION was probably made with noble intentions.  I liked what it was trying to say that even in this world where marriage is so temporary, true love and happy marriages can and do still exist.  I just wish the screenplay had been tighter and that the characters had been better written.  Noble intentions don't make good movies.LAWS OF ATTRACTION is just not worth the price of admission.  It's not worth 90 minutes of your day.  Life is so short and this movie is just not worth it.  Why not go for a nice walk and enjoy the warm spring air.

Two divorce lawyers, played by Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore, become immediate enemies as they face off in a high profile divorce case.  But their attraction to each other is just as strong as their need to win their cases, and they soon end up in bed together. They vacillate between wanting to ruin each other and spending time together.  When their research into their clients' assets results in a drunken and accidental wedding, they attempt to maintain the illusion of a real marriage despite their adversarial professional lives.The actions of these supposedly top-rate attorneys would have been grounds for disbarment several times over.  I can't imagine even mediocre lawyers being so stupid.  Because of this and a few other missteps, the plot doesn't hold together, but, fortunately, the chemistry between the two leads does.  Brosnan, despite his character's ruthless streak, exudes a rumpled charm while Moore is excellent as the cold, repressed professional who doesn't realize how much she craves affection.  You can't help rooting for their happiness.  As with most romantic comedies, there is no depth - just an unlikely love story that doesn't challenge.  Most viewers will end up smiling rather than laughing.""The Laws of Attraction"" has its charms despite the lackluster screenplay.

I knew that I would have to watch this movie just from the tagline. It sounded like a fresh, witty, fun, romantic comedy. Plus with a cast like Pierce Brosnan, Julianne Moore, and Parker Posey, it was sure to be a hit. It may have not been a hit at the box office, but it was a good film. It has it up points and its low points, but it was mostly good. The only problem was that I thought this movie was about two lawyers who wake up and they are married to each other. This thing happened almost after the first hour of the movie. That is a long time for the plot to actually start. A lot happens in the first hour, but the commericals were misleading. The film is not about two lawyers getting married, but it is about two lawyers who are attracted to each other.Audrey Woods is a divorce lawyer from New York who has never lost a case. But on a new case, being led by Judge Abramovitz, she meets Daniel Rafferty, a male divorce lawyer who has also never lost a case. Audrey's mother Sara, who does not like to be known as a mother in public, thinks that Daniel is VERY attractive, but Audrey does not like how Daniel handled everything. Things change for Audrey when she meets fashion designer Serena. She wants a divorce from her rock and roll star husband Thorne Jamison. Serena agrees to hire Audrey, but Daniel steals Serena from her, causing her to take on Thorne. The only thing the two married couple wants is a castle that they own in Ireland. Daniel and Audrey go to Ireland to check out the claims on the castle, but after a night of drinking and partying, the two wake up the next mourning, and relize that they are married. They return back to New York and have to pose married, while also dealing with the biggest divorce case of their careers.""Laws of Attraction"" is a delightful way to spend 90 minutes.

Hepburn and Tracy, Doris Day and Rock Hudson, Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the ""Thomas Crown Affair"" - actually, it was Pierce Brosnan's Thomas Crown performance that enticed me into renting ""Laws of Attraction."" I equally adore Rene Russo and Julianne Moore. Brosnan is tops on my list. So what could be bad? Hah! What's bad is what the actors were given to work with. The script - the narrative - what were the writers thinking? The direction is abysmal - shame on you, Peter Howitt. This film gives new meaning to the word ""fluff."" It's beyond marshmallow. When Pierce Brosnan's sex appeal is diminished and lovely Julianne Moore comes-off flat, there's something seriously wrong. And there's not a drop of chemistry between the two. I ask, sincerely, how is this possible?Yes, the plot is trite, filled with cliches, the pace is erratic, but these two actors, and the more than decent supporting cast, could have overcome all this, even slightly. No? Julianne Moore just doesn't have the right stuff to pull-off comedy. Her tone, her timing, just don't make for laughs. Now, as a serious dramatic actress, she's excellent. But, Ms. Moore, no more forays into comedy, please.Moore plays Audrey Miller, a top notch NYC divorce lawyer and Yale graduate, but a dull character. She is plagued by personal insecurities and neuroses due to a lifetime competing with her ever youthful, ever gorgeous mother, (Frances Fisher). Fellow divorce lawyer, Daniel Rafferty, (Brosnan), matches Miller case for case, and actually seems to win more than lose. A relationship is supposed to blossom here, with Audrey fighting commitment all the way. This is where chemistry, or lack of it, moves the movie into the realm of disaster.I might have appreciated ""Laws of Attraction"" more if it were truly terrible. But it is just blah. I must admit, I did watch the entire film because of Pierce Brosnan. But then, I cannot resist him. Not everyone feels this way.

835271,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002I84N0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","""Laws of Attraction"" is a romantic comedy about two high-powered divorce lawyers who are battling each other in and out of court.  The movie from Hollywood history that obviously comes to mind as a reference point is ""Adam's Rib"" with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.  But the reason this 2004 film falls short is not because it has Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore instead of Tracy and Hepburn, but because the story and screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna (""Three to Tango""), worked on by Robert Harling (""The First Wives Club""), is not even close to being in the same league as what Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon wrote for their good friends Spencer and Kate way back when.There is nothing wrong with the casting of this film.  Brosnan and Moore are both personable enough, and Frances Fisher does a nice turn as the mother of Moore's character.  Brosnan is Daniel Rafferty and Moore is Audrey Woods.  She is a perfectionist who is wound too tight, crying in a stall in the women's room before she goes to court, while he is so unwound that he falls asleep in court before the trial starts.  The only thing they have in common is that neither one of them has ever lost a divorce case, so obviously they are perfect for each other.  Audrey will be the last one to figure this out and the problem is not that this storyline is predictable, but that it is uninspiring.This becomes clear early in the film when Daniel and Audrey go up against each other in court for the first time.  She is a bit too uptight and he is a bit too laid back; the more you think about it the more you find it hard to believe either one is really undefeated in court.  But then one of them loses for the first time, which is fine because we know this is only the first round of this particular fight, which is going the distance, so it makes sense that the other one wins the second time.  But instead of being treated to a similar scene in which we see them do something that wins them the case, we just hear them tell about it on the courtroom steps.  The best part of the movie comes next, with a montage that offers a couple of cute bits as the two continue to wage wars.  But a montage relatively early in the film should not be the best part, there should have been even better moments worked into it, and we should have had the scene in the courtroom for the second trial to prove each of these lawyers are true heavyweights.The last half of the movie has to do with the biggest fight of all, which is a divorce case involving a rock star (Michael Sheen) and a dress designer (Parker Posey) whose names I forget because neither one is an attractive character.  I suppose this matters because it means our sympathies are not with one of them over the other.  A knock out fight in open court can be avoided but both of them want to keep the castle they have in Ireland, which requires our two stars to fly over there to check out the place (poor them).  If you saw the preview you know that the two posh lawyers from America get drunk and end up married.You can probably figure out what happens in the rest of the film because we have seen this story a few times before.  Brosnan and Moore have chemistry, but this movie cannot come up with much for them to do besides get drunk as an excuse for things to happen next and walk in the fog.  Going to Ireland is a plus, but even that is not exploited for as much as it might have been.  ""Laws of Attraction"" is a film that requires one of these smart lawyers to do something incredibly stupid just to set up the last act of the story, which only serves as another bitter reminder of how inadequate the script is for this film.Brosnan and Moore deserved much better than ""Laws of Attraction"" and you can only hope that they will get to do a film again some day with a much better script, which actually would not be hard given how close this one was to rock bottom.  Remember, even Tracy and Hepburn did ""Keeper of the Flame"" and ""Sea of Grass"" together and survived both of those films.  Fans of Brosnan and/or Moore are going to check this one out, but they are going to be disappointed in the results because they have to know this one could be so much better.",3,A pair of likeable stars saddled with a woefully bad script,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,4195,"['Laws', 'Attraction', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'high-powered', 'divorce', 'lawyers', 'who', 'are', 'battling', 'other', 'court', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'obviously', 'mind', 'reference', 'point', 'Adam', 'Rib', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'reason', '2004', 'film', 'short', 'not', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'instead', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'story', 'screenplay', 'Aline', 'Brosh', 'McKenna', 'Three', 'Tango', 'worked', 'Robert', 'Harling', 'First', 'Club', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'same', 'league', 'what', 'Garson', 'Kanin', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'wrote', 'good', 'friends', 'Spencer', 'Kate', 'way', 'back', 'when.There', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'casting', 'film', 'Brosnan', 'Moore', 'are', 'personable', 'enough', 'Frances', 'Fisher', 'nice', 'turn', 'mother', 'Moore', 'character', 'Brosnan', 'Daniel', 'Rafferty', 'Moore', 'Audrey', 'Woods', 'perfectionist', 'who', 'wound', 'too', 'tight', 'crying', 'stall', 'women', 'room', 'court', 'so', 'unwound', 'asleep', 'court', 'trial', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'one', 'ever', 'lost', 'divorce', 'case', 'so', 'obviously', 'are', 'perfect', 'other', 'Audrey', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'one', 'figure', 'out', 'problem', 'not', 'storyline', 'predictable', 'uninspiring.This', 'becomes', 'clear', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'Daniel', 'Audrey', 'go', 'up', 'other', 'court', 'first', 'time', 'bit', 'too', 'uptight', 'bit', 'too', 'laid', 'back', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'one', 'really', 'undefeated', 'court', 'then', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'fine', 'know', 'only', 'first', 'round', 'particular', 'fight', 'going', 'distance', 'sense', 'other', 'one', 'second', 'time', 'instead', 'being', 'treated', 'similar', 'scene', 'see', 'do', 'something', 'case', 'just', 'hear', 'tell', 'courtroom', 'steps', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'next', 'montage', 'couple', 'cute', 'bits', 'two', 'continue', 'wage', 'wars', 'montage', 'relatively', 'early', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'moments', 'worked', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'scene', 'courtroom', 'second', 'trial', 'prove', 'lawyers', 'are', 'true', 'heavyweights.The', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'do', 'biggest', 'fight', 'divorce', 'case', 'involving', 'rock', 'star', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'dress', 'designer', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'names', 'forget', 'one', 'attractive', 'character', 'suppose', 'matters', 'sympathies', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'other', 'knock', 'out', 'fight', 'open', 'court', 'can', 'be', 'avoided', 'want', 'keep', 'castle', 'have', 'Ireland', 'two', 'stars', 'fly', 'there', 'check', 'out', 'place', 'poor', 'saw', 'preview', 'know', 'two', 'posh', 'lawyers', 'America', 'get', 'drunk', 'end', 'up', 'married.You', 'can', 'probably', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'rest', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'story', 'few', 'times', 'before', 'Brosnan', 'Moore', 'have', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'much', 'do', 'besides', 'get', 'drunk', 'excuse', 'things', 'happen', 'next', 'walk', 'fog', 'Going', 'Ireland', 'plus', 'even', 'not', 'exploited', 'as', 'much', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'film', 'one', 'smart', 'lawyers', 'do', 'something', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'last', 'act', 'story', 'only', 'bitter', 'reminder', 'how', 'inadequate', 'script', 'film.Brosnan', 'Moore', 'deserved', 'much', 'better', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'get', 'do', 'film', 'again', 'day', 'much', 'better', 'script', 'actually', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'hard', 'given', 'how', 'close', 'one', 'was', 'rock', 'bottom', 'Remember', 'even', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'did', 'Keeper', 'Flame', 'Sea', 'Grass', 'together', 'survived', 'films', 'Fans', 'Brosnan', 'and/or', 'Moore', 'are', 'going', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'results', 'have', 'know', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A

But while Brosnan and Moore are competent actors, they just don't quite click as a romantic team in this movie and they lack the on-screen chemistry that Hepburn and Tracy had.There is some humor in their situation in that they are both divorce attorneys who make their living breaking up marriages, and yet both have radically different views about it. Brosnan has quite staid and traditional views on marriage and still believes in it, while Moore thinks it's completely dead as an institution. Much of the drama and humor in the movie arises from their fundamental disagreements about everything relating to marriage and their work.In addition to the tension there, they inadvertantly get ""married"" during a drunken binge at a party in Ireland. They wake up to find they're both married, despite the fact that they're now representing opposite sides of a famous rock band couple in a litigious divorce. The newspapers have a field day about this new conflict of interests.I would give it 3 stars, except the movie recalls Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew in that Brosnan is actually the man earnestly trying to domesticate his often irrascible and shrewish wife and refusing to be deterred by her personality, she wanting nothing to do with their relationship either in or out of marriage, and I liked that part. So I give it four although it probably rates no more than 3 or 3 1/2 stars. Their relationship situation isn't helped by his continuing to beat her in court with sleazy legal tricks while continuing to proclaim his love for her.

I had such high hopes for this light romantic comedy.  Bad does not even begin to cover it.  The brillance of these actors couldn't save this really, REALLY bad movie.  Didn't they read the script?!?  The storyline was ridulous, the court scenes unrealistic (did I mention they were divorce attorneys so a lot of time was spent here....) and since I don't want to give anyway any of the plot (it's stretched way too thin as it is), suffice to say their relationship seems to have been developed in some fantasyland.  It was soooo unbelieveable that even I - a die hard fan - had to roll my eyes.  Also, it contained the worse ending ever - well maybe not EVER, but certainly up there on the top ten.  The gruff but kind (?) judge played by some former SNL actress was painful to watch and the whole inside joke with the ""weather channel"" was not funny - not the first time they used it nor the fifth or sixth time they used it.  You'd think the filmmakers would have caught on and heavily edited this movie.

If this script had taken these two and done some unique things with them, I would no doubt have upgraded my rating.*sigh*But the movies does not do unique things.  Do you think there's a scene where they are suddenly thrust together into a romantic night, which they regret afterward?

835277,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0002I84N0,Matthew Horner,"[4, 4]","""Laws of Attraction"" opened last April to scathing reviews - banal, uninspired, outdated, etc. To me, romantic comedies are like houses - there are just so many house plans and facades out there. The trick is to make something interesting out of the available options. Viewed this way, ""Laws of Attraction' succeeds. It's not a romantic comedy on the order of ""Notting Hill"", ""Four Weddings a Funeral"" or ""Love Actually"". But it is an amicable piece of work. It's utterly predictable in the same way Doris Day / Rock Hudson comedies were in the 1960s.The story is as old as they get, dating back as far as 1948's, ""State of the Union"", which starred Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn as two married-to-each-other lawyers who find themselves battling each other in a bitter case.In this modern rendition, the two attorneys are not married to each other - yet.  Audrey [Julianne Moore] is a New York divorce lawyer who has never lost a case. She meets her match in Daniel [Pierce Brosnan], who has also batted a thousand in court. What ensues is a battle of wits and wills, but, of course, it's really love the two are after.""Laws of Attraction"" really is old-fashioned. It's about the man conquering a woman who is at least his equal. And it's about a strong woman who feels superior to men until she meets Mr. Right. Yet is this really sexist? If you are strong, do you respect - much less `fall for' -someone who is at least as strong as you are? And isn't the strong man falling for the strong woman a positive thing?Perhaps Moore and Brosnan realized early in production that this movie wasn't that special. If so, then they make the movie succeed by giving their usual professional performances. Moore in a weak movie is better to watch than most actresses in strong one.

Clooney fell for Zeta-Jones in Intolerable Cruelty and now we have Brosnan falling for Julianne Moore. But unlike Intolerable Cruelty where the only cruelty was putting the audience to sleep, this one is actually pretty entertaining.Audrey (Julianne Moore) is one of the best divorce lawyers around, that is until Daniel (Pierce Brosnan) moves to the city and opposes her in what seems like every single divorce case in the city. Audrey is very disciplined and organized where Daniel is a walking mess, he arrives late, wears scruffy clothes etc. You can see a pattern emerging here, can't you? This romantic movie follows the ""opposites attract"" and ""I hate you so much that I've fallen for you"" script. Doesn't take a genius to figure that out.Although I do agree with most of the reviewers about the weak script, it was executed quite nicely and how can you dislike Brosnan and Moore. They made a good couple and it was fun watching Moore trying so hard to outwit Brosnan, and in the end it's his slacker tactics that pay off. This movie is definitely more comedy than romance, and I think things worked out for the better. The acting won't win an Oscar, but it's enough to get a smile from you and keep you entertained. The supporting cast were also a joy to watch, everyone seems to be having a good time with the movie and guess what, you can feel it too.Personally, if I were you and I'm coming back from a hard day's work or a day of classes, I'm not gonna pop in ""Schindler's List""...I would pop in something light-hearted and this is just the movie.

Brosnan and Moore play opposing attorneys who find themselves in an intense love/hate relationship both in the courtroom and out in the real world.  Moore is one of New York's most successful divorce lawyers whose on-the-job experiences with estranged couples has pretty much turned her off of marriage completely, while Brosnan is a divorce attorney, who, though ruthless in court, has managed to retain his faith in marriage as an institution.  The couple bicker, squabble and wrangle over issues both personal and professional - all the while falling madly in love with each other.Though bright and humorous at times, ""Laws of Attraction"" can't overcome the trite predictability of its storyline or the stereotypical nature of its characters.  Brosnan and Moore are both attractive and energetic performers, but the screenplay lacks the kind of madcap sophistication that was the defining trait of those films of the `40`s that this movie wants so desperately to emulate.  It is indeed encouraging for those of us in the over-40 crowd to see two such seasoned players starring in a romantic comedy, but too often they are asked to behave in ways that are not so very different from the teeny-bopper or even twenty-something characters we find in most films of this type nowadays.",2,likable stars; predictable plot,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,1489,"['**1/2Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'go', 'Tracy-Hepburn', 'route', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'films', 'earlier', 'pair', 'rarely', 'level', 'two', 'notable', 'stars', 'Brosnan', 'Moore', 'play', 'opposing', 'attorneys', 'who', 'find', 'intense', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'courtroom', 'real', 'world', 'Moore', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'most', 'successful', 'divorce', 'lawyers', 'on-the-job', 'experiences', 'estranged', 'couples', 'pretty', 'much', 'turned', 'off', 'marriage', 'completely', 'Brosnan', 'divorce', 'attorney', 'who', 'ruthless', 'court', 'managed', 'retain', 'faith', 'marriage', 'institution', 'couple', 'bicker', 'squabble', 'wrangle', 'issues', 'personal', 'professional', 'while', 'falling', 'madly', 'love', 'other.Though', 'bright', 'humorous', 'times', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'trite', 'predictability', 'storyline', 'stereotypical', 'nature', 'characters', 'Brosnan', 'Moore', 'are', 'attractive', 'energetic', 'performers', 'screenplay', 'kind', 'madcap', 'sophistication', 'was', 'defining', 'trait', 'films', '40', 's', 'movie', 'so', 'desperately', 'emulate', 'indeed', 'encouraging', 'over-40', 'crowd', 'see', 'two', 'such', 'seasoned', 'players', 'starring', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'asked', 'behave', 'ways', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'teeny-bopper', 'even', 'twenty-something', 'characters', 'find', 'most', 'films', 'type']",N/A

Every film PG-13 and up has foul language, sexual activity, violence, etc. - all in abundance. There was one scene in which a rock star gives his wife the finger - but this film makes TV's ""The Practice"" look like it's rated R.Brosnan is a somewhat frumpled, yet highly successful divorce lawyer that moves from California to New York after a 10 year hiatus and begins representing people fighting against those represented by Julianne Moore. She is disgusted by him from the get-go. His hair is ruffled and his suits are unkept. She is anal and everything must be just so. She is in a competition with her mother as to who can look the best and be most energetic and her mother is winning by strides. Of course, her mother gets cosmetic surgery at the same rate people change their sheets.Familiarity might breed contempt, but loathing sometimes breeds attraction. As they are forced to work together or against each other from case to case, they force themselves to get along in a professional business matter. While trying to settle the estate of a British rocker and his American wife, they both end up going to Ireland to do research on the Rocker's castles and other holdings. They end up having to collaborate, even though they are professional adversaries and as unlikely as it would seem, they get ""accidentally"" married (not Britney married - just drunk married).They both wake in horror, desiring to keep their faux pas marriage under wraps and to somehow get a quickie divorce as soon as possible. Their accidental marriage ends up affecting them in ways they never imagined and their disdain for each other blooms into true affection - not just some teenage lust.While the viewer is not subjected to nudity or bedspring noises, it is more than implied that the two sleep together before they are married - so if you don't want your kids to see that, save this for when the kids are asleep - but for a Hollywood film, this movie is extremely tame.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. No stress, no paint-peeling language, no bed hopping, no toilet humor and no bullets flying. Wow - all this AND they were able to be sweet, smart and entertaining?! How innovative! Hollywood needs to produce more films like this rather than the continual load of mind garbage they are so famous for grinding out like so much sausage.",5,almost family safe,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,2453,"['are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'can', 'see', 'be', 'totally', 'relaxed', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'rated', 'G.', 'Every', 'film', 'PG-13', 'up', 'foul', 'language', 'sexual', 'activity', 'violence', 'etc', 'abundance', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'rock', 'star', 'wife', 'finger', 'film', 'TV', 'Practice', 'look', 'rated', 'R.Brosnan', 'somewhat', 'frumpled', 'yet', 'highly', 'successful', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'California', 'New', 'York', '10', 'year', 'hiatus', 'representing', 'people', 'fighting', 'represented', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'disgusted', 'get-go', 'hair', 'ruffled', 'suits', 'are', 'unkept', 'anal', 'everything', 'must', 'be', 'just', 'so', 'competition', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'look', 'best', 'be', 'most', 'energetic', 'mother', 'winning', 'strides', 'course', 'mother', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'same', 'rate', 'people', 'change', 'sheets.Familiarity', 'might', 'breed', 'contempt', 'loathing', 'sometimes', 'breeds', 'attraction', 'are', 'forced', 'work', 'together', 'other', 'case', 'case', 'force', 'get', 'along', 'professional', 'business', 'matter', 'trying', 'settle', 'estate', 'British', 'rocker', 'American', 'wife', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'Ireland', 'do', 'research', 'Rocker', 'castles', 'other', 'holdings', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'collaborate', 'even', 'are', 'professional', 'adversaries', 'as', 'unlikely', 'would', 'seem', 'get', 'accidentally', 'married', 'not', 'Britney', 'married', 'just', 'drunk', 'married', '.They', 'wake', 'horror', 'desiring', 'keep', 'faux', 'pas', 'marriage', 'wraps', 'somehow', 'get', 'quickie', 'divorce', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'accidental', 'marriage', 'up', 'affecting', 'ways', 'never', 'imagined', 'disdain', 'other', 'blooms', 'true', 'affection', 'not', 'just', 'teenage', 'lust.While', 'viewer', 'not', 'subjected', 'nudity', 'bedspring', 'noises', 'more', 'implied', 'two', 'sleep', 'together', 'are', 'married', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'see', 'save', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'asleep', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'movie', 'extremely', 'tame.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'stress', 'paint-peeling', 'language', 'bed', 'hopping', 'toilet', 'humor', 'bullets', 'flying', 'Wow', 'AND', 'were', 'able', 'be', 'sweet', 'smart', 'entertaining', 'How', 'innovative', 'Hollywood', 'needs', 'produce', 'more', 'films', 'rather', 'continual', 'load', 'mind', 'garbage', 'are', 'so', 'famous', 'grinding', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'sausage']",N/A

Audrey is the type of person who eats junk food when nervous (yet managed to keep her figure), and avoids relationships at all costs.  Daniel is unkempt who will throw Audrey's life in a tail spin.  The chemistry between these two work well.  He represents clients who are going through divorces from Audrey's clients.  He is obviously smitten, but Audrey is trying hard to fight her emotions.  Audrey has a mother who is fighting to stay young, and does not want to be known as her mother in public.  Her mother spends time exercising, and having botox parties.  However, the movie was stolen by rocker couple Thorne (Michael Sheen) and Serena (Parker Posey) as a couple going through a nasty divorce.  Their scenes are laugh out loud funny.  When Audrey meets fashion designer Serena, she convinces Serena that she should not deal with Thorne's infidelity and she agrees to be Serena's attorney.  Serena changes her mind and instead wants Daniel as her lawyer, and Audrey ends up taking on Thorne as a client.  The couple want the castle in Ireland.  While trying to settle the estate of the rocker couple Audrey and Daniel take a trip to Ireland to check out the estate, and speak with the staff.  While in Ireland they ""accidentally"" get married.  Seems drinking too much does not agree with Audrey.Audrey wakes up horrified, while Michael seems okay with the idea.  Audrey wants to keep everything under wraps, but word gets out they are married.  As time passes, Audrey comes to terms with her true feelings for Michael.It's a sweet film that's okay.  It's not super great, but I liked it enough that I would consider watching it every now and again.  This is not a film I would consider adding to my DVD collection.  I'm a huge fan of Moore and Bronsan, but to me the chemistry was kind of lacking too me.  I thought the scenes in Ireland were rather nice.  The castle was really beautiful.

The plot is screwy, turning this way and that into outrageous situations, but I didn't mind that so much when Brosnan and Moore appeared on screen together.Audrey Woods, played by Moore, was first in her class at Yale, and is now New York's most successful and best lawyer.

""Laws of Attraction"" is a very typcial and cheesey romantic comedy.  But c'mon, sometimes we're in the mood for cheese!  Among cheesey romantic comedies, ""Laws"" is a winner.  Genuinely adorable and sweet, the movie has heart.Brosnan takes a break from 007 and gives a most memorable performance; he earns my respect by showing me that he is, as an actor, secure enough with himself to take part in some mildly silly, self-deprecating comedy.  Actually Brosnan has perhaps never been more charming, but in a much more dorky and hilarious way than as James Bond.And what can I say about the delectable Julianne Moore, who is no doubt the hottest actress over 40?  Though technically old enough to be my mother, Moore continues to be delicious eye-candy on screen.  Her character insecure, slightly-neurotic, but ultimately adorable character is a joy to watch as well.Whilst giving great performances separately, Brosnan and Moore together produce wonderfully and somewhat unexpected chemistry.  I honestly did not expect the two to work so well together.  They really do make a good couple.  It's also refreshing to see a more ""age-appropriate"" couple, as the male character is typically paired up with a much younger female.My only beef with the movie is that very forced and ridiculous plot involving Parker Posey (who is normally a wonderful actress, but here woefully mis-cast), which I felt detracted from the movie's grace.All in all, this is a great date movie.
