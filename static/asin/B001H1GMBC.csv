If you watched All Creatures Great and Small you will love this updated version of quirky characters in a small coastal town and the doctor who takes care of them all.

Doc Martin, played by Martin Ellingham, is a most unlikely hero; at first viewing one may wonder why this man was selected to play the part. After just a few minutes he becomes Doc Martin and it's hard to imagine anyone else as the Doc.Series 3 continues where Series 2 left off with a few minor changes; we have a new PC played by John Marquez. PC Penhale arrives with his own set of dreams and problems with which Doc must deal. Doc's on and off interest in Louisa, played by Caroline Catz, begins to be on more than off.The beautiful scenery of Port Wenn, played by the Village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, is always a delight; the charm of the village, the narrow streets, and the beauty of the surrounding countryside is very pleasant to the eyes.

Doc Martin is still very brilliant solving medical problems that plague the little village and its very eccentric (strange) inhabitants.

They don't always escape his insults and barbs; however, they see that very deep inside he is a ""good person"" but you do have to get beyond his gruff exterior which at times is very hard to do.  In spite of a repulsion at the sight of blood (the reason he's no longer a surgeon in London and the reason he's a GP in Portwenn), he's really very medically brilliant and very dedicated--just no bedside manner.Yes.

1199033,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B001H1GMBC,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[54, 56]","Doc Martin Series 3 is lacking only in quantity of episodes. This is too fun a series to settle for so few. Of course Series 1 & 2 helps. Rude, grumpy Doc (Martin Clunes) vomits at the sight of blood. You'll laugh at the sight of other townsfolk in this serene, beautiful, fictional Portwenn (filmed in Port Isaac, Cornwall). Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole) is sane, almost, as is teacher Louisa (Caroline Cutz). Receptionist and phlebotomist Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) is outrageously funny along with Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and...well the list goes on with the regular cast.If you love English seaside village views and homespun humor, this is a series that will tickle your fancy, every episode, and make you beg for more. Episodes tend to carry over to the next and all have SUBTITLES. This is some of the best British Doctor's Life Comedy/drama ever produced. The ""Doc Martin Series"" is to Medical Comedy what ""Pie In The Sky"" is to Police Comedy. (See my reviews on both.)Bonus stuff includes cast filmographies and fun trivia along with subtitles.For the detail minded:..1 Tick Tock--Includes Pauline and Louisa seems to be trying to help doctor locals including a girl who jumps on car tops, her overweight mom, the fainting teacher Louisa, overlysleepy new cop, and a blind man with an untrained dog...2 The Morning After--Bert large changes from plumber to chef. Scenic Portwenn is hit with widespread food poinsoning, including Louisa, unrequited love to the stiff naive Doc.  A general misdiagnosis also proves to be a huge error in source...3 Love Thy neighbor--Louisa's new neighbors, a psychologist, has strange parental practices for their brat son. Conditions run rampant with the cop being agoraphobic (going out fear) & narcoleptic (sleep disorder), and others with rashes, and then there was Doc's blood phobia, & inability to tenderize a relationship with Louisa....4 The GP Always Rings Twice--Admirers aplenty in Portwenn. A divorcee pursues Doc. Auntie Joan has 'relations' with a painter. The plumber/chef's son, Al, Pauline's old flame, returns. Then there's Princess Tinkle, she dog....5 Breaking Up Is Hard to Do--Pauline's gambling on the internet at the surgery. Doc & Louisa gamble on a real date. And kiss. Nothing's going very well leading up to an unrelated beach accident and a surprise outcome....6 The Two of Us--Portwenn engagement news is rampant. Aunt Joan hears by rumor--oops! Large Restaurant struggles as does many with fungus illness....7 In Sickness and in Health--A very pregnant bridesmaid shoots her eye with a party popper. The vicar's drinking. The reception patio is flooded. Wedding florist is arrested. The bad news continues on this the wedding day.Delightful, warm, hilarious, witty, and quick dialogue moves this beautifully filmed series along so fast you'll be disappointed when the complete list of episodes are done. Then, like me, you have to click for a notification of Doc Martin, Series 4.  I think I should go back and repeat Series 1-2-3 in the meantime.",5,"Extremely funny, quirky villagers, but beautiful seaside town stories.",1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,3021,"['Doc', 'Martin', 'Series', '3', 'lacking', 'only', 'quantity', 'episodes', 'too', 'fun', 'series', 'settle', 'so', 'few', 'course', 'Series', '1', '2', 'helps', 'Rude', 'grumpy', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'sight', 'blood', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'sight', 'other', 'townsfolk', 'serene', 'beautiful', 'fictional', 'Portwenn', 'filmed', 'Port', 'Isaac', 'Cornwall', 'Aunt', 'Joan', 'Stephanie', 'Cole', 'sane', 'almost', 'teacher', 'Louisa', 'Caroline', 'Cutz', 'Receptionist', 'phlebotomist', 'Pauline', 'Katherine', 'Parkinson', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'Bert', 'Large', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'well', 'list', 'regular', 'cast.If', 'love', 'English', 'seaside', 'village', 'views', 'homespun', 'humor', 'series', 'will', 'tickle', 'fancy', 'episode', 'make', 'beg', 'more', 'Episodes', 'tend', 'carry', 'next', 'have', 'SUBTITLES', 'best', 'British', 'Doctor', 'Life', 'Comedy/drama', 'ever', 'produced', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Series', 'Medical', 'Comedy', 'what', 'Pie', 'Sky', 'Police', 'Comedy', 'See', 'reviews', 'Bonus', 'stuff', 'cast', 'filmographies', 'fun', 'trivia', 'detail', 'minded', '..1', 'Tick', 'Tock', 'Pauline', 'Louisa', 'be', 'trying', 'help', 'doctor', 'locals', 'including', 'girl', 'who', 'car', 'tops', 'overweight', 'mom', 'fainting', 'teacher', 'Louisa', 'overlysleepy', 'new', 'cop', 'blind', 'man', 'untrained', 'dog', '2', 'Morning', 'Bert', 'large', 'changes', 'plumber', 'chef', 'Scenic', 'Portwenn', 'hit', 'widespread', 'food', 'poinsoning', 'including', 'Louisa', 'unrequited', 'love', 'stiff', 'naive', 'Doc', 'general', 'misdiagnosis', 'also', 'be', 'huge', 'error', 'source', '3', 'Love', 'Thy', 'neighbor', 'Louisa', 'new', 'neighbors', 'psychologist', 'strange', 'parental', 'practices', 'brat', 'son', 'Conditions', 'run', 'rampant', 'cop', 'being', 'agoraphobic', 'going', 'fear', 'narcoleptic', 'sleep', 'disorder', 'others', 'rashes', 'then', 'was', 'Doc', 'blood', 'phobia', 'inability', 'tenderize', 'relationship', 'Louisa', 'GP', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'Admirers', 'aplenty', 'Portwenn', 'A', 'divorcee', 'pursues', 'Doc', 'Auntie', 'Joan', ""'relations"", 'painter', 'plumber/chef', 'son', 'Al', 'Pauline', 'old', 'flame', 'returns', 'Then', 'Princess', 'Tinkle', 'dog', '.5', 'Breaking', 'Up', 'Hard', 'Do', 'Pauline', 'gambling', 'internet', 'surgery', 'Doc', 'Louisa', 'gamble', 'real', 'date', 'kiss', 'Nothing', 'going', 'very', 'well', 'leading', 'up', 'unrelated', 'beach', 'accident', 'surprise', 'outcome', 'Two', 'Us', 'Portwenn', 'engagement', 'news', 'rampant', 'Aunt', 'Joan', 'hears', 'rumor', 'Large', 'Restaurant', 'as', 'many', 'fungus', 'illness', '.7', 'Sickness', 'Health', 'very', 'pregnant', 'bridesmaid', 'eye', 'party', 'popper', 'vicar', 'drinking', 'reception', 'patio', 'flooded', 'Wedding', 'florist', 'arrested', 'bad', 'news', 'wedding', 'day.Delightful', 'warm', 'hilarious', 'witty', 'quick', 'dialogue', 'moves', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'series', 'so', 'fast', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'when', 'complete', 'list', 'episodes', 'are', 'done', 'Then', 'have', 'click', 'notification', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Series', '4', 'think', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'repeat', 'Series', '1-2-3', 'meantime']",N/A

Many patients have conditions which are diagnosed, but we never really know what becomes of them.  This is unsatisfying and curious, as they are mostly permanent residents of this small village.Also some main character's will be missing abruptly in follow up seasons as if their contract negotiations failed or something.
