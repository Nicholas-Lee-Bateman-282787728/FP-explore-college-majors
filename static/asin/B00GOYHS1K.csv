1680053,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B00GOYHS1K,D.P.,"[6, 6]","Shawn Michaels has had numerous nicknames & taglines to him throughout the career such as &#34;The Heartbreak Kid (H.B.K.)...The Showstopper...The Icon...The Main Event&#34; but none of those are probably more important than &#34;Mr. WrestleMania&#34; because it's at the &#34;Showcase Of The Immortals&#34; where Shawn has the reputation of delivering the performance of a lifetime to the point where some of his opponents have said their greatest matches in their career was against him at WrestleMania. Here is the official match anthology of Shawn Michaels' WrestleMania matches starting from his days with Marty Jannetty to his final wrestling match with Shawn providing comments in between each match in regards to his opponents, the match itself, and the effect it's had on him such as coming to WWE, his championship aspirations, and going from tag team to singles competition. It should be noted that the WrestleMania XX triple threat match against Triple H & Chris Benoit is NOT included in this set.Rockers vs. Twin Towers - The WrestleMania debut for not just both Shawn Michaels & Marty Jannetty but also their opponents of the Big Boss Man (Ray Traylor) & the Akeem character (previously One Man Gang) with The Rockers showcasing their superior speed advantage with their double team maneuvers & fast tags working over the arm while also taking a shot at their partner on the apron before the Towers got the advantage back with their size & power using the same strategy of double team moves such as a body sandwich & double big splash while also attempting to take a page out of the Rockers' strategy going to the top rope at one point. These were two completely teams with different styles yet came together in a fun match.WrestleMania VRockers vs. Orient Express - Rockers were in control early using their quickness & double team maneuvers causing the Express to resort to tactics such as using illegal tactics such as Mr. Fuji on the outside to gain the advantage along with double teaming of their own as both teams traded momentum throughout the match with the Express slowing down the pace & keeping Rockers grounded while The Rockers continued to use a fast pace. This was a solid match with the only real downfall being the ending.WrestleMania VIRockers vs. Barbarian & Haku - The future Faces Of Fear were dominate in the early moments showing their power advantage with headbutts & chops while being able to keep catching The Rockers when trying to use their speed advantage causing them to resort to their double team maneuvers to gain an advantage such as their hip toss & superkicks along with Shawn delivering a dropkick that sent their opponent into Marty's frankensteiner only for Barbarian & Hauk to use double teaming of their own singling out one member of the team using power moves as both teams continued to trad momentum. This was a &#34;power vs. speed&#34; match with the Heenan Family going at a slow & methodical pace with grounded power offense & The Rockers going fast paced with flashy & aerial offense.WrestleMania VIIvs. Tito Santana - This was the WrestleMania singles debut of Shawn Michaels under the beginning stages of the persona that we would later know as &#34;The Heartbreak Kid&#34; with Sensational Sherri in his corner while Tito Santana was under his bull fighter gimmick of &#34;El Matador.&#34; Shawn kept taunting Tito only to get a running crossbody in response taking control by constantly taking down & grounding Shawn with a side headlock takeover before Shawn was able to use Tito's own momentum against him & even stop Tito dead in his tracks with what we would later know as &#34;Sweet Chin Music&#34; as both men traded momentum both in & outside of the ring. This was a good encounter.WrestleMania VIIIIntercontinental Championship Match vs. Tatanka - Tatanka already had previous victories against Shawn in both a non-title & six man tag match leading up to this match with both men having female managers in their corners from the debuting Luna Vachon & Shawn's ex-girlfriend Sensational Sherri who kept Luna from getting involved at ringside while it should also be noted that Shawn was coming into this match with a bad shoulder. Shawn kept trying to get control in the early moments only for Tatanka to remain one step ahead with escapes & counters while heavily working over that shoulder with stretches & strikes along with other offense like a single arm DDT & shoulder breaker before Shawn was able to resort to breaking the rules to get offense in going aerial coming off either the top rope or the apron to the outside on more than one occasion but either getting caught or crashing & burning more than once. While a lot of people point to the next year's Ladder Match as the birth of Shawn being &#34;The Showstopper&#34;, my opinion is that it actually started here because this was the opening match but nobody was able to follow or top this match quality wise throughout the rest of the card which also says something for Tatanka who was a very underrated competitor as well.WrestleMania IXLadder Match vs. Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television as Razor was the current Intercontinental Champion while Shawn claimed he was the real champion based off the fact that he was never beaten for the championship resulting in both of their championships being hung in the air. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ring post. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him &#34;making an ass&#34; of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, &#34;He Is Superman!&#34;WrestleMania X[History Of The Intercontinental Championship; Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn; From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden]vs. WWE Champion Diesel - Shawn came to the ring with Jenny McCarthy & his new bodyguard Sid while Diesel came to the ring with Pamela Anderson who was originally scheduled to be Shawn's valet while it should be noted that Jonathan Taylor Thomas of &#34;Home Improvement&#34; was the guest timekeeper & Nicholas Turturro of &#34;NYPD Blue&#34; was the ring announcer. Shawn tried to use his superior quickness early only for Diesel to keep using it against him such as a high back body drop that sent Shawn over the top onto a photographer & a hard whip in the corner that sent him over the top onto a cameraman before Shawn was able to take advantage of mistiming by Diesel going aerial either off the top rope or the apron to the floor working over his back & ribs area while Sid made his presence known which did come into play later on. It's no secret that Kevin &#34;Diesel&#34; Nash is very limited with what he does in the ring so you weren't going to get the type of WrestleMania performance he's gotten before & after this match with more athletic opposition but both men did the best they could when you also consider the fact that photographers around ringside for the L.T. main event who aren't normally at the show kept getting in the way whenever they tried to work outside of the ring but overall they delivered a good match.WrestleMania XIIron Man Match vs. WWE Champion Bret Hart - Just like they did the first Ladder Match, both men also did the very first Iron Man match in WWE history & for those who don't know the rules, the match has a 1 hour time limit & the man with the most decisions at the end of the time wins the match while it should be noted that Shawn created his own &#34;WrestleMania Moment&#34; before the match got started with his entrance. Shawn worked a different style than expected with him grounding Bret with various takedowns while Bret used the same strategy by keeping Shawn down with headlocks before Shawn moved into working over the arm with armbars & a hammerlock. Things started to pick up when Shawn caught Bret off guard with a head scissors that took him to the outside before attempting a Sweet Chin Music that missed Bret & knocked out someone else before returning to working over Bret's shoulder with various holds & even using the ring post multiple times as Shawn kept trading his offensive style from the high flying with a crossbody onto Bret on the outside to grounded wrestling with the Perfect-Plex. Bret started to get more aggressive with his offense like the coming off the top rope with a knee into Shawn's head & started focusing on his back after the backdrop over the post onto the outside with moves like the backbreaker, back suplex from the top rope, and throwing Shawn into the corner so hard that he went over the top rope & his Jose on the outside. Both men started showing signs of the exhaustion as the match kept going as Bret beat on Shawn until he was out of breath before both men started pulling out all the stops like Bret's suicide dive onto the outside & Shawn executing separate moonsaults & head scissors off the top rope. The final moments were very intense while everything that also happened after we heard a bell was controversial in it's own right but it doesn't take away that these two men delivered a quality performance.Wrestlemania XII[History Of The WWE Championship; Greatest Rivalries: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels; From The Vault: Shawn Michaels]WWE Championship Match vs. Steve Austin - Mike Tyson was the special outside enforcer for this match but already had his issues with Austin leading to him joining Shawn's group of D-Generation X weeks earlier while it should also be noted that Shawn Michaels came out to the DX band performing him to the ring while Shawn had been nursing a back injury that caused him to be out of action since the Royal Rumble in January. Shawn kept throwing jabs early causing Austin to retaliate with a clothesline & punches while making an ass out of Shawn. Triple H & Chyna got involved causing them to be sent to the back while Austin & HBK brawled from the ring to the stage to ringside with Austin backdropped over the railing at one point. Shawn remained in control working over Austin's legs while continued to taunt him. The big moment came with the referee being knocked out before Austin caught Sweet Chin Music into a stunner causing Tyson to get involved how nobody expected him to going into the match with Tyson delivering the final &#34;blow&#34; to Shawn Michaels.Wrestlemania XIV[Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line; History Of The WWE Championship]vs. Chris Jericho - Shawn's WrestleMania return here didn't start off well as two of this pyro guns didn't go off & were duds. Both men exchanged wrestling early on with headlocks & armlocks Shawn attempted to work over Jericho's leg with moves like a figure four while Jericho worked over his back with various moves like a vertical suplex, the Walls Of Jericho on the outside, and ramming Shawn's back into the ring post twice. Jerry Lawler made the comment that &#34;both men are so similar that it's almost like wrestling yourself&#34; which we saw apply to Jericho various times such as using Shawn's trademark moves like his flying forearm & Sweet Chin Music while Shawn pulled out some tricks of his own like the countering a suplex into a crossbody. This was definitely a quality match fitting of Shawn's reputation of &#34;Mr. WrestleMania.&#34;WrestleMania XIX[Shawn Michaels: My Journey; Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]vs. Kurt Angle - This was one of the most highly anticipated dream matches in history at that time. Shawn started this off with a slap in the face to Angle causing Kurt to get real aggressive with his amateur wrestling doing various takedowns & riding however Shawn showed a few amateur tricks of his own & even outwrestled Kurt. Kurt started to work over Shawn's back with an Angle Slam into the ringpost & many belly to belly suplexes including one attempt to do a german suplex off the ring apron onto the floor. Shawn had to resort to &#34;desperate measures&#34; to prevent that before performing his own crossbody dive onto Angle on an announce table. The matches got more aggressive & intense as it went on as Shawn was able to counter the anklelock various times while Angle delivered another Angle Slam off the top rope as both men came very close with the nearfalls & a very dramatic ending. A modern day classic encounter, period.WrestleMania 21[Shawn Michaels: My Journey]No Holds Barred Match vs. Mr. McMahon - Vince came into his match with an unbelievable tan (he looked like an Umpa Lumpa on steroids) showing off a portrait of his &#34;Muscle & Fitness&#34; magazine cover at ringside before Shawn went right after him using the announce table & the equipment on it to his advantage along with the magazine cover not only resulting in Vince getting cut over his eye but also forcing him to call help in the Spirit Squad allowing Vince to take brief control whipping Shawn & having Shane get involved using a kendo stick only for Shawn to return it right back not only using the kendo stick on Vince & a handcuffed Shane but also put a new member into the &#34;Kiss My Ass Club&#34; as Shawn started to get more calculated & more violent with his actions going back to his past as a &#34;degenerate&#34; against Vince such as a loud direct chairshot & ladder to bust him open, using a table & trash can & a pulling out the highest ladder I've seen in WWE to land on Vince with impact, and making sure Vince saw Sweet Chin Music coming directly at his face. This match wasn't the wrestling classic that Shawn has been known to deliver as &#34;Mr. WrestleMania&#34; as it wasn't designed to be that way more than just him being pushed to show off a very aggressive & violent side of him that we haven't seen in years while also having all the actions done to him for months by Vince come back to haunt him so in that light, this was a very entertaining match.WrestleMania 22vs. WWE Champion John Cena - Cena's entrance for this WM heavily makes up for this &#34;Chicago mobsters&#34; entrance from last year...and for those who saw the PPV live, the streaker has been edited out of the DVD release. As I said earlier, this match should have switched places with the Taker/Batista match as it would have been an outstanding undercard match but it wasn't a match that was worthy of being the main event. HBK showed some good storytelling by working on Cena's leg throughout the bout but unfortunately, Cena gave the performance that anti-Cena critics use when labeling him &#34;superman&#34; in that he no-sold his hurt leg at times & along with the piledriver on the steps he got earlier. This match was very much like his main event match with Triple H which means that it was a great match for what it was but it wasn't the quality that people would expect from a WrestleMania main event.WrestleMania 23vs. Ric Flair - Unfortunately, Ric Flair's matches as of late were just lackluster to average as best but Shawn gave Ric the best match he's had since the 2005 series of matches with Triple H. This match was an emotional rollercoaster as you saw Ric Flair pulling out some of his old &#34;dirtiest player in the game&#34; tricks on HBK throughout the match while HBK was conflicted with &#34;putting 'Old Yeller' out of his misery&#34; & even held back from taking Flair out with sweet chin music early in the match. During one point, HBK returned Flair's slap from RAW & drew &#34;first blood&#34; on Flair by making his mouth bleed while later, Flair looked like he was fighting for his life in HBK's figure four & even ripped off the bottom turnbuckle post in the process of trying to get out of it. However, Flair's career was ended with the words &#34;I'm sorry, I love you&#34; & the third sweet chin music. This was the type of performance that Ric Flair needed to end his career on...and he got it.WrestleMania XXIV[Ric Flair: The Definative Collection]vs. Undertaker - This is one of those matches that I can try to describe & review but the words wouldn't do it justice. This match had everything (including the unique &#34;Heaven & Hell&#34; entrances) on a physical & emotional level of both men refusing to lose to the point where this was the closest anyone had ever come to breaking the streak to the point where you saw the most emotion from Undertaker since his &#34;Deadman&#34; character returned 5 years ago & Shawn was even so desperate at one point, he was hoping for a win via count out. Instant classic here.WrestleMania 25[Shawn Michaels: My Journey; Undertaker: The Streak; Blu-Ray Version of History Of WWE: 50 Years Of Sports Entertainment]&#34;Streak vs. Career&#34; vs. Undertaker - Seeing how this is only the fourth time in WrestleMania history & the first time in 15 years that a non-title match is the final match at WrestleMania, you could tell that the quality they delivered last year was enough to warrant the closing position. Although these two put on such a memorable classic last year, they were able to put on another classic but different match this year as the stipulations of only winning by pinfall/submission along with the story of Shawn being so obsessed with ending the streak that he risked his own career...this match was more intense than the last one right from the opening moment when Shawn did Taker's trademark signature &#34;throat slash&#34; at the start. Taker hurt his leg early in the match giving Shawn the advantage by heavily working over that leg with various moves like the figure four & even the anklelock. Things really picked up from here with such moments as Shawn getting the tombstone on the floor, HBK executing a moonsault that you have to see to believe, and being able to counter moves from Undertaker that nobody else was able to counter before him while Taker himself was able to keep getting up from everything Shawn delivered. I don't want to reveal the ending but the match had such an effect on Taker to the point where he showed more emotion towards Shawn that we've seen from &#34;The Dead Man&#34; before Shawn refused to go out without a fight. As what has been the case with most of the matches here, keep watching after the match as you got got a very emotional WrestleMania moment.WrestleMania XXVI[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010; Superstar Collection: Shawn Michaels; Undertaker: The Streak]Blu-Ray extras include pre & post match interviews from WrestleMania including a promo on the Twin Towers, talking with Rhonda Shear from WMX, two WMXI interviews with Pamela Anderson & Nicholas Turturro, his backstage interview from his WMXIX return, and saying &#34;goodbye&#34; backstage after XXVI. Other Blu-Ray extras also include bonus stories talking about his friends leaving the company, what Ric Flair demanded from him & the story behind their watches, his involvement in &#34;End Of An Era&#34;, and the relationship between himself & Flair & Chris Jericho.The only major negative about this match anthology is that it is incomplete with the WrestleMania XX main event not being included due to the level of involvement involving Chris Benoit which would have been impossible to edit around unlike other recent sets where Benoit was featured (another issue for another time) but past that, this was not only an anthology fitting Shawn's label of &#34;Mr. WrestleMania&#34; but a nice timeline of his evolution throughout his WWE career with a nice percentage of these matches not released onto DVD past the WrestleMania sets so this is definitely one I would add to the collection.",5,Shawn Michaels' Immortal Showcase,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,20214,"['Shawn', 'Michaels',

1680057,A1L7PH0CS9BHP6,B00GOYHS1K,Tom,"[8, 11]","First off, this is just a review of the matches (I can't review the dvd because it isn't out yet).  I have seen all the matches and I have to say that most are well worth watching.  I'm sure that with this set, unlike Taker's WM set, we'll probably see Shawn in a sit down interview either before the matches are shown, or he may be shown talking about each match before they occur on the set.  I don't think the set will be just a set of his matches without his input.  I will probably edit this review after the set comes out, but for now here are the matches that will be on the set:Up first is his first WM match, a tag match as he and Marty Jannetty (The Rockers) take on Big Bossman and Akeem (The Twin Towers at WM 5 in 1989.  This was the second match of that night and it was a pretty good showing for both teams.  The match was fairly short, clocking in at just over 6 minutes, but it was a great enhancement match for both teams.Up next is from WM 6 and features The Rockers taking on The Orient Express.  This match was a lot like the last one and was just a fairly fun match to match.  It had some good moments but wasn't anything special.  The match ends in a countout and that kind of takes away from it but it is a pretty good showing from both teams.The next match is the last tag match that Shawn would have at WM and it featured the Rockers taking on Barbarian and Haku.  This was the opener for WM 7 in 1991 and boy was it a great contest.  The match clocked in at just over 10 minutes and had a little bit of everything.  Shawn was spot on in this one as was Barbarian.  Just a fun match to watch.The next match is Shawn's first match as a single competitor and had him going up against Tito Santana.  Again, Shawn would be in the opener for a WM.  This was a good match, not a great match, but good.  This was a good match for Shawn to get off and running for his singles career.  Good contest with some fast paced action.The next match is for the IC title and featured Shawn defending the title against the Native American Tatanka.  Again, Shawn finds himself in the opening match of a WM.  This is a killer match, maybe the best match of the whole WM 9 show.  Talk about back and forth action with some arial moves thrown in as well.  This was a great match from start to finish.  I did hate the countout victory and the fact that for some reason Luna Vachon comes to ringside with Shawn (still never figured that out).  All in all well worth seeing.The next match is one that made Shawn the performer that he always was meant to be.  It also started his long run of Matches of the Year that occured at WM.  I'm talking of course about the ladder match he had with Razor Ramon at WM 10 in MSG.  Awesome match!  It does have some moments of boredom to it but Shawn makes up for it by literally stealing the show.  In fact, I honestly don't remember too much that Razor did in the contest, I only remember Shawn and the moves that he did.  This is a fun match to relive again even though it's been released 100 times before.The next match is one of my all time favorite Shawn Michaels matches and has him going up against real life friend Diesel (Kevin Nash) at WM 11.  Another awesome match and for the second straight year a match of the year winner.  I remember being so excited for this match when I was younger cause I really thought Shawn was going to win (you have to remember that at that time there were a lot of title changes at WM).  I remember Shawn saying he was going to give the fans a match they will never forget.  Actually most fans do forget about this classic, but not me, it's one of my favorite WM matches.  Shawn just lights this match up and actually dominates most of the contest.  Well worth seeing.One hour.  That's what the next match represents:  One hour.  Shawn and Bret Hart would engage in one of the single greatest matches of all time at WM 12 in 1996.  They would wrestle in an Iron Man match for over an hour to see who truly was the best in the WWE at that time.  For over one hour we see these two go literally hold for hold with one another.  This is a great match that has been shown a lot but I'm hoping Shawn can give an introduction to the match with some insight as to what was going on in his head before and during the match.  This was a great match and one that is worth seeing yet again.  Once again, for the 3rd straight year, Shawn would win the match of the year.Shawn didn't compete at WM 13 due to what he said was a knee injury.  It has been told by some people that he was faking it, that Vince wanted him to drop the belt to Bret in a WM rematch but he didn't want to do that so he faked an injury and &#34;lost&#34; his smile.  So we would have to wait until WM 14 to once again see Shawn compete at the show of shows.  This time he would face the unstoppable force of Steve Austin.  This match was another classic, one of the best ones they would have.  The only downside is that Shawn is suffering for a legit back injury that he substained from his coffin match with the Undertaker earlier in the year.  Still Shawn grits it out and gives us, the fans, yet another fantastic matchup.  Not only that but he helped to establish maybe the single greatest star the WWE has ever had in Steve Austin.Unfortunatly, due to said back injury, Shawn would not be able to compete again at WM until WM 19 when he would go into Seattle to take on Chris Jericho in another stellar match up.  I remember when Shawn left there were so many people who were like, &#34;Who's going to be the next Shawn Michaels?&#34;  I heard everyone from Rob Van Dam to Jeff Hardy but I always ALWAYS thought it would be Jericho.  He was just so good, a perfect compliment to Shawn.  I was so pumped to see these two go at it at WM and I was not disappointed.  These two had great chemistry and never had a bad match but I feel this one may be the best one they had.  Some said it was the best match of the night.  I was one of them.  I liked Brock vs Angle but I thought Shawn vs Jericho was so much better.  Well worth checking out if you've never seen the match before.Now for the next match we should travel to Wm 20 to see Shawn take on both Triple H and Chris Benoit for the world heavyweight title.  Now if you read the synopsis of the dvd set it does say how you can enjoy all 17 of Shawn's WM matches.  I have heard and do believe that this match will not be on there.  I think if it does show up it will be heavily edited as is the case most of the time whenever Benoit is in a match.  That is a shame cause the match with these three guys is an extremely good match and did win a match of the year award.  Still, the WWE wants to erase Benoit from ever being associated with the WWE and wants to also try to erase him from our heads as well so more than likely you will either not see this match or it will be heavily edited.  I personally don't think it will be included.WM 21 was a dream match for its time.  I remember wanting to see these two guys go at it once Shawn was back wrestling on a full time basis.  Shawn vs Kurt Angle is one of the best WM matches you will ever see.  These guys know how to put together a match and a story for that match.  I mean they did work a headlock for over 10 minutes and still kept the fans attention.  Other than maybe CM Punk or Daniel Bryan, I don't think there's anyone who could do that in the WWE now.  This match was a very good wrestling match and another match of the year winner.The next match was Shawn taking on Vince McMahon in a No Holds Barred match.  This was a good match but I didn't think it was anything special.  I mean we had all seen Vince get his rear end handed to him numerous times before he took on Shawn so it wasn't really anything to look forward to IMO.  The match was good and did feature the use of a ladder, a trash can and chairs among other things.  The fans must have liked it cause it did Match of the year again so maybe it wasn't all that bad.  I just didn't care for it all that much.The next match was Shawn taking on John Cena in front of over 80,000 fans at WM 23.  The match was supposed to be a rematch from WM 22 with John taking on Triple H but after Triple H tore his quad for the second time in his career then Shawn got the match.  I'm actually glad that happened cause I hated the Triple H/Cena match from the previous year and I absolutely loved this match between John and Shawn.  This was another one of those back and forth matches where you honestly didn't know who was going to win.  I like those types of matches where it's hard to predict a winner.  This match was very good and actually made me give Cena some props (I hate Cena).  This match did not win match of the year (that was reserved for the 50 minutes classic these two had on Raw the next month) but it was still well worth seeing.Up next is WM 24 when Shawn retired one of his heroes Ric Flair (well not really).  I remember people raving about this match and I couldn't understand why.  I think it is a great match but it wasn't all that good.  I actually thought Edge and Taker had the better match that night.  This match was a fantastic send off for Flair but honestly, it was not one of his best matches.  Shawn kind of made him, at times, look like he was standing still.  This match was really all about emotion and they sure got it when it appeared that Flair would never wrestle again.  Of course we all know that he did come out of retirement but for this one fleeting moment, it was a little sad that we may never see the greatest of all time in the ring ever again.  I think that's the reason the match did win match of the year.WM 25 is when Shawn took on The Undertaker.  It may go down as the greatest WM match of all time and Shawn has had so many of them but this is one that may just take it.  Talk about a fantastic match from start to finish with almost no flaws, this is it.  For a little over a half hour these two gave of their bodies and their souls and we were just there to be along for the ride.  Loved the story to build up the match and I loved the match itself.  Well worth seeing and once again a match of the year winner.Lastly, we will Shawn once again try to end the Streak as he puts his career on the line yet again against the Undertaker.  This was at WM 26 and is another very good match.  This is another one of those back and forth matches where you have to take a breath whenever you can.  It is a good match but I thought WM 25's was a little bit better.  Still, great contest that did win match of the year and what a way for Shawn to go out.Unlike Flair, Shawn has thus far stayed out of the ring.  It remains to be seen if he ever will have another match (I think he will) but as for right now he has kept his promise to UT and made sure that was his last match ever.  If it is, then what a hell of a match to go out on.  I don't know if this set was necessary or not, most of these matches have been released before, but it is going to be another great companion piece to Shawn's From the Vault dvd, his Heartbreak and Triumph dvd, His two DX sets, his Journey dvd and the Rival set with Bret.  There are a ton of great matches to be seen on here and I'm hoping for either a new (short) documentary or maybe an introduction from Shawn before each match.  We'll have to wait and see but this should be a great set either way.",5,Mr. Wrestlemania,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,11395,"['First', 'off', 'just', 'review', 'matches', 'ca', ""n't"", 'review',
