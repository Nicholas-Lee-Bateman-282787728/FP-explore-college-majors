1065500,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000OVLBEO,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 5]","Drawing from 'Big Marvel' comics and the ancient myth of 'Faust,' 'Ghost Rider' trail blazes hell on earth.  With new dimensions in firey visuals, the movie gives us a lot to look at.  With semi-decent performances, the story skids over the ""sell your soul to the devil"" paradigm with a lot of pondering and repetition.  Sometimes it's entertaining; at other times profound, but too often the movie pauses and loses its cohesive tension.  Not that 'Ghost Rider' is meant to be great drama.  It is a comic book, yet mostly it comes off as stylish if not insipid in its development.Motorcycle stunt rider, Johnny Blaze, is approached by Mephisto (Peter Fonda) one night while commiserating over his co-star father's terminal cancer.  Offering a deal he can't refuse, Johnny doesn't so much consent as he does bleed over a written contract that is binding as hell on earth.  Loving the crowd's admiration as a sort of Evel Kneivel of the ault years, Mephisto covets Johnny to be the devil's own bounty hunter for hell's escaped souls and a weapon against his own son's treasonous attempts to overthrow his reign.  While Johnny's nocturnal escapades make him seem like he's just going for the ride, his willful track is to bond with his girlfriend, Roxanne (Eva Mendes).  Meanwhile, narrator/cowboy, Carter Slade (Sam Elliott) may have the key he's looking for to find an escape clause.'Ghost Rider' is enough of a spectacle to please an audience, but the story takes grand elements and makes a mediocre blend. It can be funny (To unwind Johnny guzzles down pots of coffee while listening to The Carpenters.)  Besides impressive combat scenes, it never really comes together.",2,Faustus on Wheels,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,1671,"['Drawing', ""'Big"", 'Marvel', 'comics', 'ancient', 'myth', ""'Faust"", 'Rider', 'trail', 'blazes', 'hell', 'earth', 'new', 'dimensions', 'firey', 'visuals', 'movie', 'lot', 'look', 'semi-decent', 'performances', 'story', 'skids', 'sell', 'soul', 'devil', 'paradigm', 'lot', 'pondering', 'repetition', 'entertaining', 'other', 'times', 'profound', 'too', 'often', 'movie', 'pauses', 'cohesive', 'tension', 'Not', ""'Ghost"", 'Rider', 'meant', 'be', 'great', 'drama', 'comic', 'book', 'yet', 'mostly', 'off', 'stylish', 'not', 'insipid', 'development.Motorcycle', 'stunt', 'rider', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'approached', 'Mephisto', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'one', 'night', 'commiserating', 'co-star', 'father', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'Offering', 'deal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'Johnny', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'consent', 'bleed', 'written', 'contract', 'binding', 'as', 'hell', 'earth', 'Loving', 'crowd', 'admiration', 'sort', 'Evel', 'Kneivel', 'ault', 'years', 'Mephisto', 'Johnny', 'be', 'devil', 'own', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'hell', 'escaped', 'souls', 'weapon', 'own', 'son', 'treasonous', 'attempts', 'overthrow', 'reign', 'Johnny', 'nocturnal', 'escapades', 'make', 'seem', 'just', 'going', 'ride', 'willful', 'track', 'bond', 'girlfriend', 'Roxanne', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Meanwhile', 'narrator/cowboy', 'Carter', 'Slade', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'may', 'have', 'key', 'looking', 'find', 'escape', 'clause', 'Rider', 'enough', 'spectacle', 'please', 'audience', 'story', 'grand', 'elements', 'mediocre', 'blend', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'unwind', 'Johnny', 'guzzles', 'down', 'pots', 'coffee', 'listening', 'Carpenters', 'impressive', 'combat', 'scenes', 'never', 'really', 'together']",N/A

1065502,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000OVLBEO,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 1]","Just when my expectations for super hero films were sky high after seeing The Dark Knight and Iron Man, Ghost Rider comes along and sends my expectations crashing back down. While it's not as awful as the likes of say, the Fantastic 4 films or what not, it still sucks and reminds me why I hated super hero films for the longest time up until last year. Worse yet, this film had potential to be great but instead ends up being a miserable flop.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story focuses on a man named Johnny Blaze; played by Nicholas Cage; a professional stuntman specializing in dirt bikes. After the death of his father during stunt, Johnny runs away and ends up meeting Satan himself who makes him become the Ghost Rider and stop evil forces and punish people for their sins. The rest of the story focuses on Johnny's love life and having to stop four villains possessing the powers of nature and one of them is Satan's own son.MUSIC: Generally consists of rock as well as a usual musical score you'd expect, but it's not in a good way.ACTION: These scenes were a mix between somewhat interesting to utter joke. The stunts involving the bike and the CGI effects were cool, but what's up with the fact these villains are so wimpy? The fight scenes with the villains end far too quickly and crappily scripted to the point of laughably bad and utterly inept. The action scenes overall are not good.ACTING: Nicholas Cage, can you not get a good role in anything anymore (Wicker Man was hated by critics and moviegoers, Bangkok Dangerous; same case, Next, etc.)? The dialogue was awful, and so was the acting. The actors did not seem to know how to work with the script and their performances were really bad.OVERALL: Do not watch. It's not the worst super hero film ever, but it still sucks. It's painful to see Nicholas Cage stoop this low especially because he's starred in good films like the National Treasure flicks and Face Off. I also doubt this film caught the feel of the Marvel character for the most part as well.THE GOOD: The CGI effects and some of the cool stunts.THE BAD: The action scenes, the acting, the storyline, and the music.",2,LAME!!!  4.25 OUT OF 10,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2139,"['Just', 'when', 'expectations', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'were', 'sky', 'high', 'seeing', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'along', 'expectations', 'crashing', 'back', 'down', 'not', 'as', 'awful', 'likes', 'say', 'Fantastic', '4', 'films', 'what', 'not', 'still', 'why', 'hated', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'longest', 'time', 'up', 'last', 'year', 'Worse', 'yet', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'instead', 'up', 'being', 'miserable', 'flop.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'professional', 'stuntman', 'specializing', 'dirt', 'bikes', 'death', 'father', 'stunt', 'Johnny', 'away', 'up', 'meeting', 'Satan', 'who', 'become', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'stop', 'evil', 'forces', 'punish', 'people', 'sins', 'rest', 'story', 'Johnny', 'love', 'life', 'having', 'stop', 'four', 'villains', 'possessing', 'powers', 'nature', 'one', 'Satan', 'own', 'son.MUSIC', 'Generally', 'rock', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'musical', 'score', ""'d"", 'expect', 'not', 'good', 'way.ACTION', 'scenes', 'were', 'mix', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'utter', 'joke', 'stunts', 'involving', 'bike', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'cool', 'what', 'up', 'fact', 'villains', 'are', 'so', 'wimpy', 'fight', 'scenes', 'villains', 'end', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'crappily', 'scripted', 'point', 'laughably', 'bad', 'utterly', 'inept', 'action', 'scenes', 'overall', 'are', 'not', 'good.ACTING', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'good', 'role', 'anything', 'anymore', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'was', 'hated', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'Bangkok', 'Dangerous', 'same', 'case', 'Next', 'etc.', 'dialogue', 'was', 'awful', 'so', 'was', 'acting', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'work', 'script', 'performances', 'were', 'really', 'bad.OVERALL', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'not', 'worst', 'super', 'hero', 'film', 'ever', 'still', 'painful', 'see', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'stoop', 'low', 'especially', 'starred', 'good', 'films', 'National', 'Treasure', 'flicks', 'Face', 'Off', 'also', 'doubt', 'film', 'caught', 'feel', 'Marvel', 'character', 'most', 'part', 'well.THE', 'GOOD', 'CGI', 'effects', 'cool', 'stunts.THE', 'BAD', 'action', 'scenes', 'acting', 'storyline', 'music']",N/A

There was some funny one liner jokes but come on it is a comic book movie. But to get to the point this film I thought had some really cool special efects and I liked the story also.

I'm not really a fan of comic book based movies unless they're done really well (The Crow, Daredevil, Sin City) and I don't like goody-two-shoes super heroes. Having thoroughly enjoyed Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil (I know, everyone and their mother hated it but I find it's Marvel's best comic book movie), I was curious to see if he could adapt Ghost Rider and keep the dark undertones of the comic. To my surprise, the movie kept the spirit of the rider, as much as a PG-13 flick allows, anyway.I didn't agree with the choice of casting Nick Cage as Johnny Blaze but he pulled it off; felt a bit too much like an Elvis impersonation at times (especially with the sunglasses), but overall, he did a good job. Eva Mendes did the best she could with the poor dialogue she had to deliver. Peter Fonda and Wes Bentley were perfect as Mephistopheles and Blackheart, respectively. Sam Elliott was his usual cool self with his portrayal of the caretaker, Johnny's guide.The plot was rather formulaic, plagued by cheesy scenes, and tended to drag at times, but when the Ghost Rider finally shows up, it's worth the wait. The CG is top notch and the effects of the Rider driving his flaming motorcycle, burning everything in his path are impressive. I also enjoyed the flashback sequence a la Daredevil when Johnny was a kid with his father. The climax, although predictable, was fun to watch.This film's not going to be everybody's cup of tea, but if you're a fan of Cage or Ghost Rider, or if like me you don't go for colorful heroes like Spider-Man, you should check it out.",3,"Ghost Rider, motorcycle hero...",1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,1625,"['great', 'film', 'fun', 'one', 'nonetheless', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'movies', ""'re"", 'done', 'really', 'well', 'Crow', 'Daredevil', 'Sin', 'City', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'goody-two-shoes', 'super', 'heroes', 'Having', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'Daredevil', 'know', 'everyone', 'mother', 'hated', 'find', 'Marvel', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'could', 'adapt', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'keep', 'dark', 'undertones', 'comic', 'surprise', 'movie', 'kept', 'spirit', 'rider', 'as', 'much', 'PG-13', 'flick', 'allows', 'anyway.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'choice', 'casting', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'pulled', 'off', 'felt', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Elvis', 'impersonation', 'times', 'especially', 'sunglasses', 'overall', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'had', 'deliver', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'were', 'perfect', 'Mephistopheles', 'Blackheart', 'respectively', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'was', 'usual', 'cool', 'self', 'portrayal', 'caretaker', 'Johnny', 'guide.The', 'plot', 'was', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'plagued', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'tended', 'drag', 'times', 'when', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'finally', 'up', 'wait', 'CG', 'top', 'notch', 'effects', 'Rider', 'driving', 'flaming', 'motorcycle', 'burning', 'everything', 'path', 'are', 'impressive', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'la', 'Daredevil', 'when', 'Johnny', 'was', 'kid', 'father', 'climax', 'predictable', 'was', 'fun', 'watch.This', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'everybody', 'cup', 'tea', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Cage', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'colorful', 'heroes', 'Spider-Man', 'should', 'check', 'out']",N/A

Being a sci-fi and comic book fan, it was a real joy to sit down and watch this movie. The special effects were true eye-candy, but that is about where my enjoyment of Ghost Rider ended.The story was flat. Nicholas Cage put in a very uninspired and bland performance. There was nothing exciting or fun about his acting. He was sullen and flat. The movie's music was an annoyance as well. It didn't flow very well, and seemed very amateurish. And the bad guys? They were just there. Nothing about the baddies truly scared you, nor created an ounce of - go get 'em - Ghost Rider.

First rule of being in a movie: Never sell your soul to the devil! It never works out. In this Marvel comic made into a feature movie, we follow motorcycle daredevil Johnny Blaze who does sell his soul to make his father healthy again. When the devil comes knocking we learn of the legend of the Ghost Rider; the agents who collect debts (souls) on behalf of the devil. We meet a cowboy who we later learn is also a Ghost Rider. Together they battle an evil being who is attempting to steal souls owed to the devil. An interesting story, interesting characters. Well acted, well photographed and great special effects! My favorite scene is the horse riding cowboy aside Johnny Blaze on his motorcycle both moving thru the desert at night leaving a trail of fire.This is one movie in which I like Nicolas Cage.

The only issue frankly I had with the film, as with most action or comic fantasy films is with character development.  I could've used  a little more depth into Blaze's relationship with his father and his friends, and Roxanne.  His inner demons so to speak, just more substance that's all.  Otherwise, the graphics and Demons were cool.  But A clearer idea of their intentions would have been better.  Why were the souls in the TexMex town so important?  Why was there beef between Daddy-devil and Son of satan?  Tell us script-writers?  That's basically the problem: when and if they make a sequel, which they undoubtably will since it fared well in the box-office.  They need a better more indepth script, otherwise the formula is there IMO.  I thought Eva M was fine, as Roxanne.  Too bad they killed off Sam Elliot, because Johnny needs a mentor.

Now that I have and I have seen the movie, I am not eagerly anticipating more of it. That being said, the movie is pretty watchable and it looks good. It certainly isn't a benchmark for film or for comic book superhero movies. Marvel movies really aren't either. Spider-Man 1 and 2 are about it. Ghost Rider is the kind of cotton candy/popcorn movie that is easy to swallow, but is instantly forgettable once it's over. Nicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, an Evel Knevel type motorcycle daredevil. Years ago, when Johnny was little, he made a deal with the devil after a close personal tragedy. The devil is Peter Fonda. Pretty fun casting really. Jump forward a number of years and grown up Johnny(Cage) is a much loved daredevil star. He knows what is keeping him alive and what has saved him from his jumps over the years that would of killed anyone else. One day, the devil comes to call. It appears Mr. Satan needs Johnny to pay his debt and become the Ghost Rider, a leather clad, fire lit skeleton with his nasty bike and chains. He needs the GR to track down and destroy an evil power that is loose on earth. Pretty standard stuff really. The movie has a fun cast, but they are not all up to the challenge. Nicolas Cage is Nicolas Cage, and even if the movie is awful, he is usually still watchable and interesting. He seems to kind of be sleepwalking thru the role, but he loves this stuff, so he was probably having fun. Fonda was interesting casting, and even tho he doesn't really have much to do, it's fun seeing him. His introduction and ""far out"" line was pretty good. Sam Elliot is always good. He has that voice, and you pay attention when he is on screen. Too bad he wasn't in a better movie. The worst of the lot was Eva Mendes. She is a raving beauty, but she seemed a little stilted in places, and some of her acting and delivery were a bit odd. Wes Bentley has nothing to do but be predictable, cliched evil. The writing is not very sharp, and some scenes and bits of dialogue tend to veer into total cheese territory, especially at the end with Cage having his final words with Fonda. Elsewhere, the movie looks great. The make-up and special effects are all fine and lots of fun. It is far from a perfect movie(did anybody think it would be anything else?), but Ghost Rider has it's simple minded entertainment to it and it's easy to watch.

That's my favorite scene in the entire movie.  (Can't you picture Elliot's genial, yet weathered face--with that trademark, lop-sided smirk--as he passes the reins of power on to Cage, the next skull-faced angel of vengeance who must battle the forces of evil?)Good acting!  Good casting! Outstanding photography! Colossal effects!  Director Mark Steven Johnson can film my movie any time he wants!Since the original inspiration for the character was ""Ghost Riders in the Sky,"" a song made popular by Vaughn Monroe in the late '40s, you might want to hear Monroe sing the song as you view a YouTube video that also has some fantastic visuals: [...]No need for me to go into the plot because the Amazon description at top of product page does that so well, even giving some spoilers for good measure.

With movies like X2 and Batman Begins, how can anyone have the nerve to produce a loser like this?  Here is a news flash for the producers of this movie.  When I go to see a movie called Ghost Rider, that means I want to see the Ghost Rider.  I don't want to see Nicolas Cage, as Johnny Blaze, for 80% of the movie.  That is precisely what you get.  In the brief instances that you get to see the Ghost Rider, it's not too bad.  It's unfortunate that just when you get into the action, the director just can't wait to get Cage's silly mug back on the screen.  He is the usual one-dimensional character that marks most of his film career.  If that is not enough to turn you off, there is a painfully bad love story here, involving the terrible acting Eva Mendez, that is about as juvenile as you can get. Anyone who knows anything about the Rider, knows that it is a dark story.  Yet, the producers thought it fitting to throw in quite a few ""funny"" scenes, that just have no place here.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 5]","GHOST RIDER is another of the comic-book-to-film ideas that cinema audiences have been inundated with as of late.BATMAN,SPIDER-MAN,SUPERMAN,HULK, have all made it from the graphic childhood page to celluloid, and some of them have done it well. But Ghost Rider sputters and dies.The most ""inflaming"" issue for me was Nicholas Cage (THE WICKER MAN). He's, what, 43 years old? And he's playing an Evel Knievel-esque, motocyclying hotshot who jumps everything from cars to spinning helicopter blades? Puhleease! He's getting too old for these roles and it's showing. Someone younger and with a cockier attitude could've pulled of a much more believable Johnny Blaze (perhaps Heath Ledger?)The love interest of Roxanne Simpson played by the exotically pretty Eva Mendes was nice to look at, but stood out as a mere cardboard character delivering unbelievably cliched lines. Other than showing off her constant cleavage, she didn't hold any acting power.Peter Fonda as Satan (aka Mephistopheles) was okay but he's seen so little that we don't really give a ""damn"" about him.The over-the-top evilness of Satan's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) was weak and his motives never fully explained (other than he wanted to have a ""Hell on Earth"" via a forbidden city that is likewise never explained at all).My only soft spots for the film were the wickedly awesome bikes, the laughable (and appropriately so) Ghost Rider CGI moments, and Sam Elliott's intoxicating narrative. I've always enjoyed listening to Elliott's voice -- it's syrupy smooth and deep baritone was a great dichotomy against an ancient tale turned modern.But the film as a whole is exceptionally weak. The love story feels and looks forced (again, Cage is just too old for someone the likes -- and looks -- of Mendes), the character's interactions are whisked aside in favor of action that isn't explained, and those characters that are interesting are given so little screen time that we just don't care about the story at all.Aside from the cool motorcycles and Sam Elliott's voice, this one should have you burning rubber back to your local video store in order to return it as soon as possible!",2,Burn Baby Burn!,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,2153,"['GHOST', 'RIDER', 'comic-book-to-film', 'ideas', 'cinema', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'inundated', 'late.BATMAN', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'SUPERMAN', 'HULK', 'have', 'made', 'graphic', 'childhood', 'page', 'celluloid', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'sputters', 'most', 'inflaming', 'issue', 'was', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'THE', 'WICKER', 'MAN', 'what', '43', 'years', 'old', 'playing', 'Evel', 'Knievel-esque', 'motocyclying', 'hotshot', 'who', 'everything', 'cars', 'spinning', 'helicopter', 'blades', 'Puhleease', 'getting', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'showing', 'Someone', 'younger', 'cockier', 'attitude', 'could', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'perhaps', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'love', 'interest', 'Roxanne', 'Simpson', 'played', 'exotically', 'pretty', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'was', 'nice', 'look', 'stood', 'out', 'mere', 'cardboard', 'character', 'delivering', 'unbelievably', 'cliched', 'lines', 'Other', 'showing', 'off', 'constant', 'cleavage', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'acting', 'power.Peter', 'Fonda', 'Satan', 'aka', 'Mephistopheles', 'was', 'okay', 'seen', 'so', 'little', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'damn', 'him.The', 'over-the-top', 'evilness', 'Satan', 'son', 'Blackheart', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'was', 'weak', 'motives', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'other', 'wanted', 'have', 'Hell', 'Earth', 'forbidden', 'city', 'likewise', 'never', 'explained', 'only', 'soft', 'spots', 'film', 'were', 'wickedly', 'awesome', 'bikes', 'laughable', 'appropriately', 'so', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'CGI', 'moments', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'intoxicating', 'narrative', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'Elliott', 'voice', 'syrupy', 'smooth', 'deep', 'baritone', 'was', 'great', 'dichotomy', 'ancient', 'tale', 'turned', 'film', 'whole', 'exceptionally', 'weak', 'love', 'story', 'feels', 'forced', 'again', 'Cage', 'just', 'too', 'old', 'someone', 'likes', 'Mendes', 'character', 'interactions', 'are', 'whisked', 'aside', 'favor', 'action', ""n't"", 'explained', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'given', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'story', 'all.Aside', 'cool', 'motorcycles', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'voice', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'burning', 'rubber', 'back', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'order', 'return', 'as', 'soon', 'possible']",N/A

Why can't Western superheroes not just be like Japanese superheroes--accept you have powers and start kicking evil butt?Gratuitous Peter Fonda shows up as the devil and thankfully a gratuitous Sam Elliot shows up halfway through to explain the whole storyline.The main flaw with this movie, though, is not enough Ghost Rider flaming skull action and too much Nic Cage and Eva Mendes attempting to act.The extras are boring--two audio commentary tracks and a couple of making ofs.

1065535,ADES8B01WRPI3,B000OVLBEO,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[5, 8]","I really enjoyed the FULL SCREEN version of this movie on DVD, so I decided to get the WIDESCREEN, EXTENDED CUT DVD version. I am very happy that I did, it is worth the extra cost!The basic story of GHOST RIDER is that a young man gets cheated in a deal with the devil and must become the devil's bounty hunter, (while trying to figure out how to beat the devil at his own game).There are 13 extra minutes of movie time on this DVD, and at least half of it takes place during the origin scenes involving the teenaged Johnny Blaze (not the adult Johnny Blaze played by Nicolas Cage). This extra footage is just as enjoyable as any other portion of the teen scenes, and it really helps a lot to develop the characters more!I especially like the new scene when the young Johnny Blaze asks to ride his dad's favored motorcycle named ""Grace."" ""Do you think you're man enough to ride Grace?"" ""Hell, yes!"" ""Well, I don't think so..."" Later his dad gives him the keys to Grace, to runaway with Roxanne, saying if he rides Grace he'll have a head start on his new life.Most of the other added minutes are short additions to already existing scenes, usually an extra line of dialog during conversations.I can only think of one scene where the new footage actually REPLACES original footage, (but still makes it better). In the saloon scene when Blackheart rounds up his spirit henchmen, originally one henchman asks, ""What about Mephistopheles?,"" and the scene ends with Blackheart replying that nobody may ever mention that name to him. In this improved EXTENDED CUT, instead of the question being asked, Mephistopheles himself shouts out for Blackheart to come outside the saloon to talk with him, and then there is the added scene of their discussion, which also helps to develop both characters better.I haven't really noticed any extra footage of the special effects Ghost Rider character himself, but the improved character development in all the other (mostly non-special effects) scenes is well worth the purchase of this EXTENDED CUT DVD, if you already know that you like this film, and even if you are seeing it for the first time with the EXTENDED CUT, you will have a better chance of liking it more.The Director's Commentary is excellent and informative. There is also a separate Producer's Commentary track, which is pretty good, too. One annoying story by the Producer is how he met actor Sam Elliott as a kid on a movie set, and is now ""paying him back"" for being so nice to him by giving Sam Elliott a role in GHOST RIDER. I think Sam Elliott could have gotten this gig all on his own, since he already had a major role in a Marvel Comics film, as General Ross in THE HULK movie, a few years back!Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)The EXTENDED CUT doesn't add much in the way of ""Making Of"" material. It adds about 20 minutes of poorly edited video touring the computer facilities where the computer effects are worked on, though the EXTENDED CUT DVD has a very enjoyable series of interview footage with comic book creators of the Ghost Rider character, that is very interesting and informative if you are into comic book history, like I am. This extra comic book interview material is separated by which decades are being discussed (mostly), 1970s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s; each decade getting about 10+ minutes, totaling about 40 minutes. Writer/editor Roy Thomas starts the 1970s section with a brief history of the character dating back to the early 1950s, inspired by the original song, and as a cowboy ghost rider. This section could have been made better by having a PLAY ALL function, so you do have to hit play after viewing each decade, but if you like comics history then it will be worth it.I really enjoy this GHOST RIDER EXTENDED CUT DVD, and I think it is the best movie/DVD of 2007, in my opinion. GHOST RIDER is not as good as SPIDER-MAN 2, the best comic book movie ever, but I like this GHOST RIDER film better than 2007's overstuffed, underdeveloped SPIDER-MAN 3 film!Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)Perhaps this GHOST RIDER movie's biggest weakness is that sometimes the main character, as a special effect, looks a little stiff, but this improves as the film progresses. But this movie version is better than the comics version, especially since the movie's Johnny Blaze is tempted and tricked by the devil but does not seek the devil out, as opposed to the original Marvel Comics story where Johnny Blaze turns to his Satanic past history of studying devil worship and summons the devil to cut a deal, as can be seen in the Marvel Comics collection called THE ESSENTIAL GHOST RIDER, VOLUME 1.Essential Ghost Rider, Vol. 1 (Marvel Essentials)The best things about this movie are that the story is fun, funny, and interesting, and also that most of the characters and actors are very likable. I also really like the somewhat Biblical imagery and references, some more overtly obvious than others, (like when one character speaks the Bible verse, ""I am Legion, for we are many!,"" or when Johnny's dad tells him to ride Grace, being a writer's metaphor for the Grace of God, which the Bible says is mandatory for Christians to live by); and with my own past, I feel like I can relate to the Johnny Blaze character trying to beat the devil who dogs his every step, and trying to beat your own foolish deals with the devil in your past, to try to fight against the devil and look out for other people to not get hurt by the devil.I also like the way that this film takes it for granted that Hell and the devil exist, as opposed to most of our secular western culture that wants to pretend that there is no devil, no Hell, and no eternal punishment. Sure, this film gets it wrong that one must CHOOSE to sell your soul to the devil, (like most of our western culture also believes), despite that the Bible teaches that all are condemned to Hell unless they CHOOSE to follow Jesus! But GHOST RIDER's depictions of the devil, Hell, and evil spirits are a lot closer to Bible teachings than many popular heretics of today who claim to be Christians while denying the existence of Hell, the devil, and that the Bible teaches of the existence of these things!",5,"The EXTENDED CUT, 2-Disc DVD is the Best Way to See This Movie!",1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,6190,"['really',

His father is killed in a tragic motorcycle accident during an exhibition. So distraught Johnny leaves his home, the carnival and his girlfriend Roxanne, to start a new life. A few years later Mephistopheles strikes a deal with Blaze to release give him back his soul as long as Johnny becomes the Ghost Rider by night. The Ghost Rider is a fiery demon bent on protecting the innocent and is employed to help Mephistopheles defeat his nemesis and son Blackheart. Blackheart and his accomplices Gressil, Wallow & Abigor are hell bent on becoming rulers of the Earth, but only one thing stands in their way and that's the Ghost Rider.This is actually quite a good movie and I feel a lot of people gave this quite unfair criticism. The intensity of some of the characters is unparalelled yet the acting is quite one dimensional. This is a great film but by no means perfect, possibly the only good acting is portrayed by those who characters matter in the film. Cage as Blaze, Fonda as Mephistopheles & Bentley as Blackheart as all excellent choices and fit their characters perfectly.I've never been a fan of Eva Mendes' acting and this film merely re-enforces my hatred for her so called acting ""skills."" Cage is quite surprising as I did expect him to have trouble playing a character that is meant to be quite young. However, he portrays the side of Blaze that is Psychotic, yet, troubled perfectly. The first image that comes to mind is when he first transforms into the Ghost Rider, he has this scarily maniacle look in his eyes that is extremely intimidating.Overall though this is still quite a good film and although it is let down in some parts with certain scenes, other parts will make up for it which is why it got a 4 star rating.You should try to watch this film before buying as it's one of those movies which you either love or hate.

Cage plays a motorcycle stunt driver that finds he has the power to fight evil minions, even when they have super powers. This is very enjoyable but not quite the caliber of X-Men, Hellboy, or Fantastic Four. I think the reason is it doesn't have quite the story depth as the more popular ones. Notheless I certainly enjoyed Nicholas Cage, Raquel Alessi, and Sam Elliott in this newest comic to screen movie. More so than the Spiderman series which I think is partly since I personally think Tobey McGuire is to wimpy for the role. Cage plays Ghost Rider tough and it pays off. Everyone does a good job and the effects are excellent. Music rocks and so does the movie. I think this may appeal to guys slightly more than ladies, but Cage will at least get their eye. Unfortunately my wife didn't find it as entertaining as me. She liked him better in Con Air.

If that isn't enough, drop a PG-13 rating on the film and hire a middle-aged hack to play the lead character as a final slap in the face to all of the fans.In GHOST RIDER, motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze makes a pact with the devil to save his father's life, but in exchange, he is tricked into becoming the devil's bounty hunter. As the Spirit of Vengeance, Ghost Rider must take off across the American Southwest to recover an ancient scroll for his new master while battling the forces of evil along the way.GHOST RIDER is a comic fan's worst nightmare. It demonstrates everyone's darkest fears when it comes to studio involvement tainting our most beloved characters on screen. Watching GHOST RIDER is like watching a competition for ""World's Worst Actor."" Eva Mendez must have breathed a sigh of relief when she was cast beside Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze's love interest. Even her stunning good looks cannot distract from her talentless performance. Nic Cage, on the other hand, can. Somewhere along the lines, Nic Cage must have mistaken the script for a comedy just as he had done in THE WICKER MAN remake, since he certainly makes a fool of himself the entire film. This version of Johnny Blaze is nothing but a disgrace to the tragic character in the comics, and Cage takes it upon himself to ham it up at every turn. And that still leaves out Wes Bentley, whose flamboyant take on the villainous Blackheart is laughable at best.Try as he might, Mark Steven Johnson simply cannot pull together a major comic book adaptation. He makes the same mistakes in GHOST RIDER as he had in DAREDEVIL, placing far too much emphasis on comedy and cheap romance in place of the violent action, pathos, and quest for revenge that are inherent to the story of Johnny Blaze. While there are several winning moments in the effects department that bring classic comic panels to life in a stunning display of fire and brimstone, the visual success of the film cannot compete with Johnson's failures in the scriptwriting process. Poor decisions regarding the uneven tone of the film and the absurd actions taken by the characters only serve to drive a deepening wedge between the audience and the events on screen.Why Columbia would gamble away a major movie franchise on such a pitiful combination of writing, acting, and directing, the world may never know, but the complete and utter failure of the film's first sequel will hopefully prevent the studio from doing any further damage to the character of the Ghost Rider.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",2,Ghost Rider,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,2801,"['Here', 'idea', 'Take', 'demonic', 'flaming-skulled', 'Spirit', 'Vengeance', 'known', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'one', 'darkest', 'heroes', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'remove', 'bloody', 'violence', 'comics', 'then', 'replace', 'jelly', 'beans', 'Carpenters', ""n't"", 'enough', 'drop', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'film', 'hire', 'middle-aged', 'hack', 'play', 'lead', 'character', 'final', 'slap', 'face', 'fans.In', 'GHOST', 'RIDER', 'motorcycle', 'stuntman', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'pact', 'devil', 'save', 'father', 'life', 'exchange', 'tricked', 'becoming', 'devil', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Spirit', 'Vengeance', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'must', 'take', 'off', 'American', 'Southwest', 'recover', 'ancient', 'scroll', 'new', 'master', 'battling', 'forces', 'evil', 'way.GHOST', 'RIDER', 'comic', 'fan', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'everyone', 'darkest', 'fears', 'when', 'studio', 'involvement', 'tainting', 'most', 'beloved', 'characters', 'screen', 'Watching', 'GHOST', 'RIDER', 'watching', 'competition', 'World', 'Worst', 'Actor', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'must', 'have', 'breathed', 'sigh', 'relief', 'when', 'was', 'cast', 'beside', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'love', 'interest', 'Even', 'stunning', 'good', 'looks', 'can', 'not', 'distract', 'talentless', 'performance', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'Somewhere', 'lines', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'must', 'have', 'mistaken', 'script', 'comedy', 'just', 'had', 'done', 'THE', 'WICKER', 'MAN', 'remake', 'certainly', 'fool', 'entire', 'film', 'version', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'nothing', 'disgrace', 'tragic', 'character', 'comics', 'Cage', 'ham', 'up', 'turn', 'still', 'out', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'flamboyant', 'take', 'villainous', 'Blackheart', 'laughable', 'best.Try', 'might', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'pull', 'together', 'major', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'same', 'mistakes', 'GHOST', 'RIDER', 'had', 'DAREDEVIL', 'placing', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'comedy', 'cheap', 'romance', 'place', 'violent', 'action', 'pathos', 'quest', 'revenge', 'are', 'inherent', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'are', 'several', 'winning', 'moments', 'effects', 'department', 'bring', 'classic', 'comic', 'panels', 'life', 'stunning', 'display', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'visual', 'success', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'compete', 'Johnson', 'failures', 'scriptwriting', 'process', 'Poor', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'uneven', 'tone', 'film', 'absurd', 'actions', 'taken', 'characters', 'only', 'serve', 'drive', 'deepening', 'wedge', 'audience', 'events', 'screen.Why', 'Columbia', 'would', 'gamble', 'away', 'major', 'movie', 'franchise', 'pitiful', 'combination', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'world', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'complete', 'utter', 'failure', 'film', 'first', 'sequel', 'will', 'hopefully', 'prevent', 'studio', 'doing', 'further', 'damage', 'character', 'Ghost', 'Rider.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

1065541,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000OVLBEO,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","Nicolas Cage is a comic book fan (Cage took his stage name from Luke Cage, one of the first Black Superheroes. Nick and his wife, Alice Kim Cage, had a son, Kal-el Coppola Cage, named after the comic book character ""Kal-el"" (aka Superman)) and collector, and a fan of the Ghost Rider comic book in particular; so he really wanted to do this movie. Too bad the director was Mark Steven Johnson, also responsible for Daredevil. Both movies are pretty lame and it makes you wonder if perhaps the comic book based action movie is not Johnson's forte. He made a big mistake in casting a guy to play the young Johnny Blaze who frankly didn't look a thing like a young Nicolas Cage. Hadn't he seen Valley Girl (1983)? Perhaps it was the vanity of Nicolas Cage that pressured him into it, to cut the director some slack, but the guy didn't look like Nicolas Cage at all to the point that it was hard to follow the plot. He looked more like a young Blackheart, the villain who was played by Wes Bentley.I think that there would be two kinds of people that would like this movie if it were done right: Fans of straight-ahead action movies and fans of quirky cult films. In other words, fans of Charlie Kaufman or fans of his twin brother Donald Kaufman (both of whom were played by Nicolas Cage in Adaptation.). I can't speak for the Donald Kaufman fans, but us Charlie Kaufman fans were sorely disappointed. There were numerous moments where opportunities for cool allusions to classic cult films arose, but they were tossed aside like ravaged kleenexes.For starters, Mephistopheles was played by none-other than the Easy Rider himself: Peter Fonda. But Fonda phoned in his portrayal. One of the motorcycles Johnny Blaze rides is based on the Captain America Harley Fonda rode in Rider, but with such a lackluster performance from Peter, who cares? The film opens with expository narration by cult film cowboy Sam Elliott, just as he does in The Big Lebowski (1998). But when he gets fired up to join Johnny Blaze for one last ride his flame peters out before the last round up. What a drag. This would have been a great place to feature Johnny Cash doing Ghost Riders in the Sky, but when they used that song it was by Spiderbait.Cage even did a parody of himself as Sailor in David Lynch's Wild at Heart, but instead of wearing a snake skin jacket which represented a symbol of his individuality, and his belief in personal freedom (this itself is a reference to Marlon Brando as Valentine 'Snakeskin' Xavier in The Fugitive Kind (1959)) and being a huge Elvis Presley fan, Johnny Blaze is a fan of Karen Carpenter?!? Maybe this would be a good place to throw in the fact that Cage IS a big Elvis fan, and, like Michael Jackson, he was once married to Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis? Or how about the fact that Nicolas Cage won the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas (1995)?Eva Mendes didn't win no Oscar, but she did play Denzel Washington's wife in Training Day (2001), and Denzel won an Oscar for that. Whenever I see Eva Mendes I think that she looks like an ethnic version of Cindy Crawford. They both have that beauty mark.

1065542,A3VP5SXUTKJFRW,B000OVLBEO,"C. DeGhoul ""urieldewolf""","[6, 7]","Despite NOT being a Nicholas Cage fan, I was very hopeful about this film. I mean, how can you go wrong with a character with a flaming skull riding a very rad, flaming bike? Unfortunately, this movie managed to get it wrong on many levels. Casting was a big problem. Cage is a fine actor but he can not carry off a larger-than-life superhero character and was constantly flipping between being overly melodramatic and flopping at attempts to be humorous. Cage was also, I feel, too mature an actor for the role. Quirks that might have been amusing/annoying with a younger actor just seemed somehow pitiful for a man his age. (I don't have a problem with mature superheroes. I have a problem with mature superheroes with the characteristics of a shallow twenty-year old.) I think a better choice would have been a talented but relatively unknown actor for the lead. Peter Fonda was competent but Wes Bentley had more villian flair. Eva Mendes was stuck in the thankless role of the stereotypical 'working girl' love interest. Ironically, I found the supporting actors much more interesting to watch (Peter Callan and Rebel Wilson, as examples).I could have forgiven this movie a lot if the plot wasn't riddled with holes big enough to drive a flaming elephant through, never mind a motorcycle. (SPOILER ALERT: The motorcycle blows away cars, and burns billboards and lizards but manages to never cause real harm to innocent humans. The painfully stereotypical cops accuse Blaze of somehow single-handedly killing a bar-load of Hell's Angels bikers -- who have obviously died of some seriously unnatural causes -- and their only evidence is his slightly charred license plate found in the city, nowhere near the scene of the actual crime. And there's no path of melted tar to tie the bar with the rail yard so assuming the flaming bike was involved at both scenes is quite a stretch. The same cops are 'smart' enough to track Blaze by his motorcyle's licence plate... but not smart enough to stake out his residence after Blaze escapes from jail. And that's just the tip of the plot-hole iceberg.) Plot holes are distracting, especially when numerous, and they prevent you from immersing yourself fully into a movie. Stretching reality is one thing; throwing it out the window is quite another.X-Men and Spiderman proved quite nicely that it IS possible to make a solid first movie in an established franchise, despite the inherent difficulties, IF you have tight writing and the right director -- two elements that were missing in Ghost Rider. It's not surprising that the writer and the director were the same guy and that this guy also wrote the screenplay for Daredevil and Electra. 'Nuff said.Things I liked: The f/x were interesting. Not perfect but fun. (Skull head was way too large. Skulls are not supposed to be the same size as, or larger than, the fleshed-out head. The Ghost Rider's head looked more like a Halloween mask than an actual skull. But the flame effects were excellent, as was the bike design, and the Western Ghost Rider's design and horse.) The scene of both Riders riding together was, I think, the best part of the movie. Not enough to justify the price of a ticket or DVD but nice eye-candy to take away some of the sting of the sloppy, predictable writing and silly plot contrivances. Unfortunately, the f/x went overboard at times. Just because you CAN flip cars and blow up things doesn't mean you SHOULD, especially if it only serves to burn holes in the story. The acting was competent but lacking a certain flair in too many cases, the exception being the supporting/background characters who were quite enjoyable to watch.  The reworked, updated ""Riders in the Sky"" was a nice, haunting touch, especially when coupled with the dual Riders scene.A few tweaks, a different director/writer, and a younger, preferably less well-known actor for the lead and I think Ghost Rider could have been an excellent comic-adaption movie. As it stands now, it's just an example of failed potential.

1065550,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000OVLBEO,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 5]","""Ghost Rider"" is based on a comic book character, and because of that, I know that I'm supposed to be somewhat lenient. Indeed, I was able to overlook the preposterous story, the cliche choices in setting and character, and the fact that every aspect of the plot was completely contrived. All that can slide in a comic book adaptation; it's meant to be fun, not meaningful. And true to its word, this is mindless entertainment at its purest. I also give it credit for being an incredibly good-looking film, with incredible special effects and entertaining stunts that are sure to please any action film buff. Top that off with the fact that this is a supernatural story, one that involves demons, the Devil, and yes, a man who transforms into a flaming skeleton. We now have a slight horrific edge, which makes the film that much more enjoyable.Still, I think that even a comic book adaptation should attempt to raise the bar in terms of performance and dialogue. The qualities of both elements are seriously lacking in ""Ghost Rider,"" and that forces me to lower my ranking to three stars. It seemed like the actors were purposely lax, as if they lost interest because they were starring in such a stylized, unrealistic film. That's not the way it works. Even if the material is ridiculous, even if the characters are flimsy and over the top, a comic book adaptation still deserves decent performances. Nothing of the sort was given for this film; every line was so amateurish that they barely passed as laughable. Likewise, every character was underplayed, overdone, or just plain poorly acted.The most prominent example of this is Nicholas Cage; after five minutes of watching him perform in this film, it was hard to believe that it was the same Nicholas Cage who won an Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas."" He plays Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle daredevil with a lot of baggage. As a teenager (played by Matt Long), he sold his soul to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save his father (Brett Cullen), who was dying of lung cancer. Unfortunately, he died the next day due to a failed motorcycle stunt (you guessed it; his father was also a daredevil). The reasoning is simple: curing the cancer was the only part of the deal. Furthermore, keeping him alive might spoil the Devil's future plans for Johnny. This is probably why he's been able to avert disaster as an adult; some of his stunts go horribly wrong, yet he always comes away unscathed. ""You've got an angel looking after you,"" says Mack (Donal Logue), Blaze's manager. ""Maybe it's something else,"" Blaze replies ominously.Yes, it is in fact something else. And now, it seems that Mephistopheles has finally found use for Blaze: he'll be turned into a Ghost Rider, a kind of demonic bounty hunter. By day, Blaze will be a normal man. But by night, in the presence of evil, he'll transform into a fleshless, flammable monster. His mission is to hunt the Devil's demon son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), and his three cohorts. If Blaze succeeds, his soul will be set free. Why is this mission so important? Blackheart has recently escaped from Hell with the intent to find a missing contract, one that was signed by a greedy man 150 years ago in a remote western town. Apparently, another Ghost Rider was supposed to deliver it to Mephistopheles. But instead of delivering the goods, this rogue bounty hunter ran off, never to be seen again, denying the Devil a chance to possess a legion of evil souls.This is where Blackheart comes in. He has some issues with daddy, and it definitely shows through his immature teenager-like attitude. He hopes to resolve these issues by overthrowing his father, which can only be done if he's in possession of the contract. How exactly this would work is never adequately explained, but I suppose it doesn't matter. What does matter is that it makes for fine conflict with Blaze, which is a must in any such story of a dark superhero. And it makes for some really impressive computer generated imagery, especially in moments when Blaze is forced to transform. If you like watching people go up in flames, then you'll love this movie.The other side of the story involves Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes), who had a failed romance with Blaze back when they were teenagers. Today she's a news reporter: smart, ambitious, and needing an extra button for her conveniently revealing blouse. She takes the opportunity to reunite with Blaze during one of his acrobatic shows (involving jumping his motorcycle across six operational helicopters at a distance of 300 feet). Here's a subplot that could have been affective had it not been for Mendes' performance. It was awful, to be perfectly honest. It's bad enough having to deliver some of the film's worst lines. Example: she waits in a restaurant for Blaze to show up. To pass the time, she downs glass after glass of wine. When she's thoroughly drunk, she turns to her waiter and asks, ""You think I'm pretty, right?"" Yes, it's a dumb line, and it was made dumber because the line was delivered badly (oh, and in case you were wondering, Blaze doesn't show up; that happened to be the night of his first transformation).As Blackheart continues searching for the contract, Blaze has a chance meeting with a mysterious caretaker (Sam Elliott) who tends a middle-of-nowhere graveyard (coincidently, it's the same graveyard where Blaze's father is buried). He's a strange man who seems to know an awful lot about Blaze and his ""condition,"" something the audience shouldn't find at all surprising; let's just say it's obvious right from the start who he really is. Anyway, he warns Blaze that he must stay away from family and friends. He also tells him to stay on graveyard property because Blackheart cannot step on hallowed ground (if only this were followed through; later on in the film, Blackheart stands inside a church, completely unaffected by it).Does Blaze listen? Of course not. He has a mission, one that he can't back out of. But will Blaze and Roxanne ever be able to rekindle an old flame (pun definitely intended)? Will the forces of evil be stopped before it's too late? Why am I even asking these questions? I can say that it all makes for great action sequences and shots of digital wizardry. If only it paved the way for an enjoyable film with enjoyable performances. ""Ghost Rider"" delivers in that it's visuals are spectacular. But the story is weak. The dialogue is substandard, as is the acting. How disappointing; such half-hearted attempts can only make a comic book adaptation difficult to engage. Someone must have made a deal with the Devil to get this film made. In time, I'm sure that that someone will pay the price.",3,Doesn't Set the Screen Aflame,1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,6668,"['Ghost', 'Rider', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'know', ""'m"",

1065553,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000OVLBEO,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","I seriously hope we get out of this comic book phase soon. It seems like for every top director that brings us a Batman Begins or X2: X-Men United, we get hacks and wannabes who think they can do just as well. After previously releasing (or is that staining the legacy of?) Daredevil, Mark Steven Johnson brings Ghost Rider to your TV set and like that other film, it's something you watch and all the while thinking of what director would've made this movie awesome.Johnny Blaze was a young kid in a father/son motorcycle duo working in a circus. Dad stricken by cancer, Johnny strikes a deal with the Devil himself, Mephistopheles, to cure him in exchange for Johnny's soul. But of course that doesn't mean Dad will be around long and Johnny grows up and becomes Ghost Rider, a flaming skeleton on a souped-up bike dishing out punishment to any evil. The Devil's son, Blackheart, is after an ancient contract which will give him lots of souls to overthrow his father and its up to Johnny to take him down so he can get his life back. Add in the complication of Roxanne, Johnny's old flame, and Johnny will have to save the day from evil.Sounds cheesy to read isn't it? Imagine watching it. Sure there's dumb dialogue right? They exist; just watch any recent Star Wars movie. But what makes Ghost Rider a pain to listen to is just how familiar it seems. You can practically make a checklist of all the cliche dialogue. And then there's the acting and at least we have Nicolas Cage who is either hamming it up for fun or he's trying his hardest but it comes across as being too cartoonish, even in a comic book movie. Eva Mendes is hot and I'm sure she can deliver good performances but this just smacks of bad acting direction, same goes for Wes Bentley. At least Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot bring some class and at least some chops into this thing.One thing I will say though: the effects have gotten better over the years. Remember that one shot where Wolverine spins around that piece of the Statue of Liberty but you can obviously tell the CG figure is way too fake? None of that here. While the facial additives look iffy, everything else from Ghost Rider himself to his riding and Blackheart's minions looks quite spot-on. As for the story itself, it's kind of hollow. One side character unexpectedly gets the axe and it's meant to be this big emotional denouement for them yet it just doesn't have the impact. Not to mention it's kind of...boring. No suspense or tension that's being built up and even in the extended cut, it just feels like adding or taking away, it's just a badly executed movie.My cousin is a comic book fan from X-Men to Spider-Man and Batman and even he was disappointed in this. Normally he finds at least something of merit in these movies (for example, he finds the equally-inept Elektra movie tolerable because ""Jennifer Garner's hot"").

Nicolas Cage delivers the lines with his usual quirky, over-the-top enthusiasm (or lack thereof).  His chemistry onscreen with Eva Mendes is believable and makes the story work quite well.I knew very little about the comic book character Ghost Rider before seeing this movie, so I enjoyed not comparing the storyline to any preconceived notion of what I thought this film should be.  I was simply along for the ride.What makes this movie so enjoyable is that I kept picturing Nicolas Cage reading the script and saying, ""Wow, I'm going to have fun playing this guy!""  And that's the way it seemed throughout the whole movie.  Whether it was an ""extra"" in the background, staring at the Ghost Rider's fiery trail, or one of the headlining actors in the film, I could see that ""this is a fun movie to be involved with"" look in their eyes.Johnny Blaze has his work cut out for him:  Save the girl; figure out exactly who he has become; analyze his powers and figure out what works and what doesn't; and deal with the authorities chasing him down every time he's trying to get rid of some spirit-world bad guys.  The action scenes, whether Johnny is riding his mortal-cycle or immortal-cycle, look really good.  I never found myself saying, ""Awe, c'mon, that looked way too fake.""  And unlike ""The Hulk"" movie, the scenes were shot with lighting that actually allowed the fighting to be seen instead of covered over by shades of black.Raquel Alessi, who plays the young Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes' character in the movie), looks uncannily like Mendes.  This really adds to the overall realism of the movie.  I think it was a little harder to find a young actor who looks anything like a young Nicolas Cage, so that transition was more difficult to pull off.I was happy with the way this movie wasn't afraid to show the real difference between good and evil, innocent and guilty, love and hate.Peter Fonda makes a great devil.  Not sure if that's a compliment, but I just had to throw that in.  He delivered some of the silliest lines in the movie, but somehow manages to make them work.  Now that's good acting.  Watching Fonda in this film made me want to run out and rent some of his other films (like Easy Rider).So, to sum up my review:  Ghost Rider manages to deliver a good solid script, some talented actors and actresses, really good special effects, suspense, drama, and action.  Ignore the naysayers and give this movie a shot.

1065558,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000OVLBEO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Even way back during my comic-collecting days, I never really crossed paths with Ghost Rider (I've read exactly one issue), and I only decided that I like Nicolas Cage after all about a year ago - so I wasn't exactly waiting for this film (and what a lengthy wait it turned out to be) with baited breath.  You know what, though?  I really enjoyed this movie.  OK, the first half hour is a little slow and boring, but once the actual Ghost Riding starts, the action makes up for the deficiencies in the storyline.  I can't say the whole flaming skull thing looks like it could even possibly be real, but it's still a flaming skull, and that is, by definition, pretty darn cool.  And we all know that you can't really go wrong with demon fighting.If you know nothing about Ghost Rider, here's all you really need to know.  As a teenager, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) sold his soul to the devil (but not for greedy or selfish reasons) - only to be totally screwed over by the evil-doer.  Knowing that old Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) could show up at any time to enforce his end of the deal, Blaze leaves the love of his life behind and heads out to lead a life of relative isolation.  Following in his father's footsteps, he becomes a famous motorcycle daredevil, continually upping the danger ante in an effort to prove to himself that he, not Mephistopheles, is responsible for his success.  Life goes on until the day he jumps the length of a football field (goalpost to goalpost, which would actually be 20 yards further than the 100 yards described in the film).  As fate would have it, Blaze's death-defying jump actually pales in importance to two other things that happen: this is the day that Blaze's young sweetheart, Roxanne (Eva Mendes), suddenly comes back into his life, and it is also the day that Mephistopheles decides to show up and put his reluctant bounty hunter to work for the first time.  Turning into a flaming skeleton consumed with the overwhelming need to punish evil-doers doesn't do much for romance, especially when it happens every night.  Ghost Rider's targets aren't exactly easy to kill, either, because they are a group of demons led by Mephistopheles' rebellious son Blackheart (Wes Bentley).  Father and son are both after the old contract for a thousand exceedingly corrupt souls a former Ghost Rider hid away from the devil's evil clutches.Once Blaze transforms into Ghost Rider, some heavy CGI work is used to tell most of the rest of the story.  None of the special effects will make your jaw drop open, but it's all pretty effective for the most part.  That whole romance thing butts in from time to time to take away from all of the demonic action, but even the plot's predictability in this regard does little to take away from the overall entertainment factor.  You especially have to love Ghost Rider's trademark finishing move, the Penance Stare.I know the reaction to Ghost Rider has been a little on the mixed side, but I for one am glad to hear that there are plans for a sequel in the works.  In terms of plot and characterization, this film does leave itself open to various levels of criticism, but Ghost Rider is a great character that could easily sustain a franchise of films.",4,Gotta love the Ghost Rider,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,3229,"['Even', 'way', 'back', 'comic-collecting', 'days', 'never', 'really', 'crossed', 'paths', 'Ghost', 'Rider', ""'ve"", 'read', 'exactly', 'one', 'issue', 'only', 'decided', 'like', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'year', 'ago', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'waiting', 'film', 'what', 'lengthy', 'wait', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'baited', 'breath', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'OK', 'first', 'hour', 'little', 'slow', 'boring', 'once', 'actual', 'Ghost', 'Riding', 'action', 'up', 'deficiencies', 'storyline', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'whole', 'flaming', 'skull', 'thing', 'could', 'even', 'possibly', 'be', 'real', 'still', 'flaming', 'skull', 'definition', 'pretty', 'darn', 'cool', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'wrong', 'demon', 'fighting.If', 'know', 'nothing', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'here', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'teenager', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'sold', 'soul', 'devil', 'not', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'only', 'be', 'totally', 'screwed', 'evil-doer', 'Knowing', 'old', 'Mephistopheles', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'could', 'show', 'up', 'time', 'enforce', 'end', 'deal', 'Blaze', 'love', 'life', 'heads', 'out', 'lead', 'life', 'relative', 'isolation', 'Following', 'father', 'footsteps', 'famous', 'motorcycle', 'daredevil', 'continually', 'upping', 'danger', 'ante', 'effort', 'prove', 'not', 'Mephistopheles', 'responsible', 'success', 'Life', 'day', 'length', 'football', 'field', 'goalpost', 'goalpost', 'would', 'actually', 'be', '20', 'yards', 'further', '100', 'yards', 'described', 'film', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'Blaze', 'death-defying', 'jump', 'actually', 'importance', 'two', 'other', 'things', 'happen', 'day', 'Blaze', 'young', 'sweetheart', 'Roxanne', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'suddenly', 'back', 'life', 'also', 'day', 'Mephistopheles', 'show', 'up', 'put', 'reluctant', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'work', 'first', 'time', 'Turning', 'flaming', 'skeleton', 'consumed', 'overwhelming', 'need', 'punish', 'evil-doers', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'romance', 'especially', 'when', 'night', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'targets', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'easy', 'kill', 'either', 'are', 'group', 'demons', 'led', 'Mephistopheles', 'rebellious', 'son', 'Blackheart', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Father', 'son', 'are', 'old', 'contract', 'thousand', 'exceedingly', 'corrupt', 'souls', 'former', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'hid', 'away', 'devil', 'evil', 'clutches.Once', 'Blaze', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'heavy', 'CGI', 'work', 'used', 'tell', 'most', 'rest', 'story', 'None', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'make', 'jaw', 'drop', 'open', 'pretty', 'effective', 'most', 'part', 'whole', 'romance', 'thing', 'butts', 'time', 'time', 'take', 'away', 'demonic', 'action', 'even', 'plot', 'predictability', 'regard', 'little', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'especially', 'have', 'love', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'trademark', 'finishing', 'move', 'Penance', 'Stare.I', 'know', 'reaction', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'been', 'little', 'mixed', 'side', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'hear', 'are', 'plans', 'sequel', 'works', 'terms', 'plot', 'characterization', 'film', 'leave', 'open', 'various', 'levels', 'criticism', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'great', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'sustain', 'franchise', 'films']",N/A

(I was a DC comics kid)  But the previews for the film looked entertaining so I decided I'd give the movie a try.  What I found was a pleasant surprise!  A good story with great effects and a role that fits Nicholas Cage quite nicely.The story revolves around a young man named Johnny Blaze, who along with his father performed a daredevil motorcycle act at carnivals.  When his father becomes terminally ill, Johnny strikes a deal with a stranger, who turns out to be Mephistopholes (the devil) played in a deliciously evil turn by Peter Fonda.  The deal awards the elder Blaze a miraculous recovery and in return the young man's soul is given as payment in the tradeoff.  Of course, a deal with the devil is never a good thing.  Mephistopholes tells the young man that when the time comes he will return asking for a favor.Years down the road, Johnny Blaze as an adult is now a daredevil motocyclist with superstart status.  Enter Blackheart, the vicious son of Mephistopholes, who wants to dethrone his father as the leader of hell.  Both demons want a contract binding thousands of souls of small town that was stole by a previous ""Ghost Rider"" or devil's bounty hunter.  With the doomed souls of the thousand villagers, Blackheart can usurp his father's power and turn his malicious sights toward the earth as a new kingdom.With the aid of the the former Ghost Rider, Johnny learns about his sudden transformation (flaming skull and all!) and begins a fight between the royality of hell.Nicolas Cage does a nice job as the reluctant hero, who with his new found powers can see the guilt of criminals and turn the pain of their victims against them.  Sam Elliot does well in his role as the ""retiring"" Ghost Rider and Eva Mendes is Roxy, the girl that young Johnny left after a tragic event in his past.  Wes Bentley is very good as the dark, murderious Blackheart..he makes a good villain.Overall the film is an enjoyable popcorn flick that is bound to entertain.  If you are a fan of the comic book, you may feel differently---I don't know how closely the director and writers followed the character and origin of the Ghost Rider.  But for people like me, who know nothing, I think you will enjoy the film.

To my surprise, I found Ghost Rider enjoyable and a lot of fun.  I have not read any of the comic books that the film is based upon but the story seems well put together and the performances are fairly good.  Nicholas Cage is a great choice to play Johnny Blaze and Eva Mendes is well cast as Roxanne but the part is one-dimensional and she does little more than react.  Wes Bentley plays a good villain as Blackheart but his role, also, does not have a lot of scope but Ghost Rider is an action film not one for character development.  It was good to see Sam Elliot (as a former Ghost Rider) and Peter Fonda (as Mephistopheles) again in a film.  An excellent performance was turned in by Matt Long as the young Johnny Blaze.Ghost Rider is an entertaining action film.  As an earlier review pointed out, Ghost Ride is not the comic book but a film based on the comic book so it may not meet everyone's expectations.  The performances may not be the greatest but neither is this a high drama that requires a wide emotional range.

It sets up like a tragedy, showcase the protagonist's transformation, has the superhero saved a helpless damsel (although I don't see the point of that scene since Ghost Rider wouldn't waste time on it),  gets into trouble with the law, dealing with a complicated romance, fights a villain in an elaborate setting, and it ends with the protagonist riding across the land with his patented costume; there's no surprises about this movie and nothing to resonate with me.  I will say that the special effects were quite good and mostly used in effective ways, like whenever Johnny Blaze gets near a shadow, whatever his body part touches it changes.  Plus, if there's an actor among the cast I can welcome with open arms and no real criticism, it's Sam Elliott; he's playing the same character from ""The Big Lewbowski"", but his relaxed demeanor was refreshing in an otherwise-dopey superhero film.For a movie about demons walking the earth and a flaming skeleton riding a Harley, this movie is campy.  The ridiculousness of its characters pushed me away from this film; I expected much from Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze since he's always been a little nutsy, but then there's the villains.  Mephistopheles (Henry Fonda) is so blatantly evil that he' laughable; granted, he IS evil given he's The Devil, but there's nothing subtle about him, which makes Blaze's pact with him worthy of a slap to the face.  However, he's nothing compared to the real antagonist, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who...has a way...with speaking certain...lines in......dramatic pauses, he's so cartoony about his behavior that I can't possibly seem him as a threat.  It's problematic enough just about everyone in this movie has an itching for cheesy one-liners, which makes me wonder if that's all Mark Steven Johnson is really capable of as a writer?

Stokes,"[0, 0]","If, like me, you're unfamiliar with the comic, here's the story: Johnny Blaze, motorcycle daredevil, sells his soul to the devil (Peter Fonda) in exchange for curing his father's cancer. His father's cured, all right, but he dies anyway, and Johnny Blaze is stuck with owing the devil.Knowing the devil could return at any time, he leaves his girlfriend and becomes a recluse, emerging only to do more and more dangerous stunts, taunting the devil who's keeping him alive.Then his old girlfriend reenters his life, and at the same time, the devil returns to collect. Johnny's mission is to retrieve a scroll, and to do that, he can become the Ghost Rider, who also ends up having some crime-fighting abilities.Along the way, he meets a mentor (Sam Elliot), who explains all the Ghost Rider lore.It was a nice way to spend a couple hours--not a great movie, but not terrible, either. I'd probably have found the flaming skull less silly if I'd been a fan of the comics, but it's just one of those things you have to accept or they'll spoil the movie.The story made sense, and was acted believably. Nicholas Cage fits as the resigned loner, though the haircut (bad wig?) made me cringe every time I saw it. And thank goodness it was a DVD and we watched it at home, because I think my incredulous burst of laughter when he appeared shirtless onscreen at the fake-looking abs (seriously, they looked like foam strips glued to his stomach) would have irritated other theatergoers.Sam Elliot was wonderful, of course--he always is.

I realize the story about Johnny Blaze collecting souls has a metaphysical premise to begin with, but still can't help but giggle when the Ghost Rider manifestation appears:  skull aflame, spikes on the shoulders of the leather jacket, chains afire, and a bike that goes anywhere it wants and does anything it wants.  Yep, the comic artist who spawned an apparition like this must have been sipping some pretty stout absinthe.  How else can you think up stuff like this?But enough with the silliness of this particular superhuman character who dares to defy Mephistopheles; GHOST RIDER (the movie) is just plain fun to watch, for a myriad of reasons.  Granted, Nicolas Cage looks more like a Johnny Blaze just joining AARP, but he still brings his own quirky humor to what could have been way too dark a role.  Buxom, voluptuous beauties like Eva Mendes make one glad to be alive; I could watch her bake cookies and still need heart medication.  Sam Elliott is one of my all-time fave actors, sporting a mumbling voice so low you swear you can feel the floor vibrate.  (""It's what's for dinner."")

The extended edition is an improvement, but this could have been a better film.Why did Ghost Rider get two films and Daredevil just one? The Daredevil movie is better than either of the two Ghost Rider flicks?The bigger slap in the face is that they didn't include both the theatrical and extended cut on one DVD/Blu Ray set. The Blu Ray looks and sounds very good, but which version to buy?Since I found both in the $5.00 bargin bin I bought both, but is it worth it? That depends on how much you want to own this film. If I were going with one I would go with the extended version, but there are more extras on the theatrical. It's bad enough they make mediocre films, but to try to make more money from fans by releasing two versions separately is just ridiculous and greedy.

The acting is borderline abysmal with the exception of the gravedigger with the shady past.  He's pretty spiffy.

Although there are some funny moments and some parts are entertaining, the action is hardly worth mentioning and whatever ""battles"" you're expecting can be thrown out the window.  Wes Bentley plays Blackheart and he might as well be an emo reject child who does relatively little except for turning people into dehydrated looking corpses.  Peter Fonda plays a poor Mephistopheles as well.  His final moments in the movie are akin to his emo son.  There are deaths, of course, but when there are you are not moved by them.

1065587,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000OVLBEO,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[0, 0]","Nick Cage is one of my personal favorite movie actors, mostly because he's so darn likeable, and he's been in some darn good movies, and some not so good. He also doesn't like to not work, so he takes most everything on his plate, and does a heck of a lot more than most other actors. This movie however is a departure for him, because it definitely doesn't seem like the movie, or character he'd play. But in the end, he somehow pulls it through, despite a very weak beginning, and a so-so middle. Darn it, I just gave you a review of most of the movie.Story: Around two or three in the morning on TNT a few months ago(isn't that when all the best movies are on?), I watched most of Blade 3. A generally terrible movie had it not had Ryan Reynolds to pick it up with his quirky and humorous personality. Ghost Rider amazingly has numerous similarities to Blade, from the whole supernatural storyline, hero, and yes, devilish villain (pun intended). But overall, there's nothing really interesting or compelling, or for that matter, original about the story. This is probably because the story, except for background info on the characters, is just background.By the way, superhero movies' back-stories have always been the weakest part of the movies. Not many can seem to pull off how they became a superhero, or their childhood story without boring me to death (think Spider-Man 1). This movie is no exception. Yes, it was very important, but could they have speed it up?Acting and Characters: Nicolas Cage of course saves the movie, with his personality, subtle humor, and just plain likability to an unlikable character. Johnny Depp in no way could have pulled off this role without turning it, well, into a dark Blade type movie, as opposed to a light Blade type movie (besides Depp will always being playing some version of Jack Sparrow in my mind.). Eva Mendes, is of course, as the damsel usually is, one of the weakest characters in the movie. She's a bit bland, unrealistic, and at times just does stuff that doesn't make any sense. Ghost Rider's friend (that guy from all those cancelled TV shows?) pulls off his poorly written role off quite nicely, making the character likeable. However, I don't know whether the guy is dead or not, can somebody tell me? Sam Elliot does great in his mysterious role, in which he doesn't do much, except provide a ""twist"" in the movie.Peter Fonda does a good job playing the devil, which may or may not be a good thing. Wes Bentley is very convincing, but his minions are all clearly failed Sci-fi channel actors. Which is about the worst comment you can get as an actor.The Effects: Nothing really jaw-dropping, or wow moments, or anything like that. No totally amazing action sequences. Instead, the action sequences look very cartoonish, and it seeps into the rest of the movie.Overall, an okay movie. Nothing really amazing, nothing really horrible either. However, Nicolas saves the movie in the corny role of Johnny Blaze, in a pretty corny movie. No Oscars are coming out for this movie. But a few Razzies might pay mind. Of course, coming from the guy that made Dare Devil, I would kind of expect it. This movie wants you to think it's Spider-man quality, but really, it belongs back in the 90's.

I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Well, to begin, I was totally unaware of the Ghost Rider thing and the comics upon which it was based so I had zero preconceived notions. Well, I have very mixed feelings about this as a movie. I didn't care much for the movie, but I found it interesting in a variety of ways. The whole story and the premise behind it is preposterous and requires a strange mixture of beliefs in the supernatural, various religions, the devil and a whole bunch of hocus-pocus drivel in order to enjoy and ""understand"" the plot. I'm lacking in that background and just regarded it as unmitigated nonsense. Furthermore, the acting was substandard, to say the least, and the characters were stiff and unsympathetic..However, the production of this movie and the stunts and special effects were spectacular. Time and time again I was left wondering: How did they do that? It's really amazing and I found the movie to be very interesting, not for the story, but for the production. Some of the stuff that is shown here is of Academy Award Nomination caliber, but it's saddled with a non-sensical story line. So, what does one do and how should such a production be rated?. Well, strangely enough, I wouldn't mind watching it a second time and that's compliment in itself. Use you're own judgement. If you're tolerant of complete nonsense as far as the story is concerned and want to watch an enjoyable display of special effects, then it's not a bad movie at all.Gary Peterson",4,"Complete Nonsense, But Very Well Done.",1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,1617,"['bargain-rack', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'starring', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'found', 'five-dollar', 'bin', 'Wal-Mart', 'Well', 'begin', 'was', 'totally', 'unaware', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'thing', 'comics', 'was', 'based', 'so', 'had', 'zero', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'Well', 'have', 'very', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'about', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'movie', 'found', 'interesting', 'variety', 'ways', 'whole', 'story', 'premise', 'preposterous', 'strange', 'mixture', 'beliefs', 'supernatural', 'various', 'religions', 'devil', 'whole', 'bunch', 'hocus-pocus', 'drivel', 'order', 'enjoy', 'understand', 'plot', ""'m"", 'lacking', 'background', 'just', 'regarded', 'unmitigated', 'nonsense', 'Furthermore', 'acting', 'was', 'substandard', 'say', 'least', 'characters', 'were', 'stiff', 'unsympathetic..However', 'production', 'movie', 'stunts', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'spectacular', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'really', 'amazing', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'not', 'story', 'production', 'stuff', 'shown', 'here', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nomination', 'caliber', 'saddled', 'non-sensical', 'story', 'line', 'So', 'what', 'one', 'do', 'how', 'should', 'such', 'production', 'be', 'rated', 'Well', 'strangely', 'enough', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'compliment', 'Use', ""'re"", 'own', 'judgement', ""'re"", 'tolerant', 'complete', 'nonsense', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'concerned', 'want', 'watch', 'enjoyable', 'display', 'special', 'effects', 'then', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'all.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

It is bad with a capital B!Ghost Rider completed filming back in 2005, but it was shelved because the studio didn't believe the film was good enough to be released. Apparently a lot of editing was done and a great deal of the film was scuttled, resulting in the disaster that was presented in 2007. Whenever a film sits gathering dust for that long, you can be pretty certain that it is not going to be very good.Nicolas Cage (who looks like he has a 50 year old's head on a 30 year old's body) absolutely chews up the scenery with such a bad acting job, attempting to channel Elvis Presley. In one scene he goes through some sort of Bad Acting 101 display as he dramatically and very slowly (not in slow motion though) raises his arm and points (but doesn't use the single index finger that most of us would use) and then utters the brilliantly scripted: ""Yoooooooooooooooooooooou"" as he speaks to Peter Fonda who laughably plays the devil.Cage was never secretive about his desire to play this character. Apparently he has been a fan of the comic for a long time. He must have put up some of the money for the film, because that can be the only explanation for the lousy performance. There's no reason for his character to speak like Elvis (and he isn't consistent in delivering it that way either).The special effects are cool in some scenes, but the battle scenes are really a let down. I've seen better in video games. Even the transformation from man to Ghost Rider is not exciting. It looks fake (which, I'll grant you is really misleading since no such creature exists. However, Marvel has done a great job with XMen and the Fantastic Four in creating films that incorporate the real world into their mythos). That said, the transformation should have been more dramatic and less drawn out.Cage's rug is its own character. And that brings to surface something really creepy about this film. Cage playing the title character. Never mind that he's about thirty years older than the character is supposed to be. Never mind that he overacts so badly that you feel compelled to turn away from the screen. It's the fact that he looks so very very old. His face is craggy and his pores look huge. He actually looks like he is ill: his body ripped with sinewy muscle, but his face drawn and sallow.Eva Mendes doesn't so much act as she moves around a bit and smiles and delivers a line.Wes Bentley resurfaces from previously committing career suicide (he insulted Harvey Weinstein of Miramax and threw prima donna tantrums on the set of The Four Feathers, garnering Weinstein's wrath to the point of being exiled from A list films)and plays one of the devil's sons: Blackheart. Bentley once said he would never be caught dead in a special effects film, because he was a ""serious actor"". Well, he's right about one thing: he is serious....seriously bad.

1065596,A34FEX6IPQL95G,B000OVLBEO,"Greg C. Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[0, 0]","Over the years, Hollywood has based movies on Marvel Comics. Some of these movies--in the late 80's/90's--were TV based or went direct to video. It was not until 1998 that Hollywood made a major hit with Blade (Wesley Snipes [130 million worldwide].) Blade would be important in setting up other marvel-based movies such as ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"", and most currently ""Ghost Rider"" (2007).Ghost Rider could have been hotter than these previous films. But unfortunately, the story, the characters,and even the special effects could have better.""Ghost Rider"" is the story of Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage), and his father (Brett Cullen); who are father and son cyclists for a carnival in Texas. His father is unhappy with him because he is too much of a hotshot but Johnny disagrees. He is in love with his girlfriend Roxanne (Eva Mendes), but he learns that Roxanne is going away and he will do everything and anything to keep her at his side--even if it means leaving his career. That evening, Johnny learns from a letter that his father is dying from Cancer.Later that evening, as Johnny is working on his motorcycle, Mephistopheles ([the devil] Peter Fonda) approaches him and he tells the young cyclist that he will cure his dying father. At what cost? Johnny sells his soul to the devil--and after another tragedy-- leaves Roxanne.Years go by and Johnny soon meets up with his former lover--now a reporter--as well as Mephistopheles. This time he needs Johnny to become a Ghost Rider (supernatural fiery demon [Bounty hunter]) to obtain a powerful contract from a former rider before his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and his demonic henchmen gain possession of it. If Johnny completes this mission, Mephistopheles will return his soul to him. Will Blaze accept his offer?Unlike other previous Marvel films--Spider-man and X-men series--that gave us a strong storyline, character development, very good CGI special effects, this movie belongs in the category of Marvel's ""B"" adaptations of lesser known movies as Daredevil (2003), and Elektra (2005).First off, if this is the first movie in the franchise, then we need to know more about our character Johnny Blaze. Our writer (Mark Steven Johnson) never explains where Johnny lives, what kind of relationship he has with his father, and most importantly, how did he and his father become stunt cyclists. Instead, we get Sam Elliot in the beginning of the movie giving us a cheesy narration of a former Rider's origin. Therefore, the narration being brief is much like the rest of the film.The story and the characters leave us confused. Let's take Blackheart and his henchmen for example; at first, he is Mephistopheles creation, then later (Elliot) tells us he is a fallen Angel, and then Blackheart makes a reference that he is his son. The Henchmen, also give unclear theme. Are they Mephistopheles' creation, or Blackheart's? It is also unclear about what Ghost Rider's character is supposed to do. Is he supposed to be the Spirit of Vengeance (a vigilante) or a Bounty Hunter for Mephistopheles? Even the love relationship between Johnny and Roxanne--why bother?--feels awkward. The movie is perplexing as it is.The special effects for the most part are very TV-like, except for some sequences where Ghost Rider himself is the focal point. The riding sequences and his transformation are technically good, but uncreative. For instance, when he is riding up a building, or going by cars on the street and making their car alarms go off, and even when he is riding under the water. When Ghost Rider is fully transformed, it reminds us of Scorpion from Mortal Combat.Ghost Rider becomes more laughable with the villains; Blackheart is walking down the street and lights are going off one by one--probably a crew member was in charge of shutting off the light switch. What about The Henchmen and their elemental effects? The water looks like something from my bathtub, but what made us really laugh was the ""Vampire henchmen."" The vampire's effects looked like smoke from a burned out campfire with the left over smoke. The fighting sequences with Ghost Rider are just too easy for him and the choreography was very robotic. There is virtually no challenge from these foes; they were as simple as a first level of a video game.An original movie needs a history and the audience must have a connection much like past movies such as ""Spiderman"", ""The X-Men"" and even ""Blade"", which started it all. This film gave us a very spotted and sloppy story, and very clich&eacute; villains. The critics would have had an easier time understanding this character if he was more of a loner, and if the movie specifically focused on him taking the vengeance on the criminals of society. I recommend this movie for the veteran Ghost Rider fan and the general comic book geek.

1065601,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000OVLBEO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 7]","Be warned: SPOILERS.I liked GHOST RIDER, I liked it a lot. And it's not because the acting was that great or the storyline that gripping. No, it was because Ghost Rider just looked so very damned cool on cinema (yes, I'm very shallow). Every time that flaming skull was on screen was yet another moment that made up for certain inadequacies which had held down the film. Admittedly, these comments are colored by my life-long addiction to comic books and superheroes. Although I'm not a big fan of Ghost Rider, I'm certainly familiar with his mythos and have read several of his issues. To me, the only change worth noting in the transition from comics to screen is that, now, Johnny Blaze guzzles jellybeans in a Martini glass and relaxes to Karen Carpenter tunes (I sense the Nic Cage influence at work here). Else, Johnny is the same tortured creature who, by day, is human and, by night, is a Spirit of Vengeance.The plot: When 17-year-old Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) discovers his father has developed cancer, he signs a pact in blood with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda, EASY RIDER) to save his dad. In return, the devil gets Johnny's soul. Many years later, Johnny (now played by Nicolas Cage, sporting an ungainly hairpiece) has followed in his father's footsteps and has become a motorcycle stunt rider in the Evel Kneivel mold. Nicknamed ""Mr. Invincible"" and hailed as a death defying superstar, Johnny prefaces every show with a soft utterance of his mantra ""You can't live in fear"" and has sought ever more dangerous stunts to dispel his suspicions that his success isn't due to his own skills but rather to the protective ministrations of Mephistopheles. He's about to find out.When Mephistopheles's son, the pigment-challenged, life force-sucking Blackheart (Wes Bentley), seeks to take over the family business - and just as Johnny becomes reacquainted with lost love Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes, ay caliente!) - Mephistopheles finally calls in his debt. Thus, Johnny unwillingly becomes the Ghost Rider, the Devil's emissary and bounty hunter. At night and in the presence of evil, Johnny goes thru a painful transformation as his body is supernaturally set on fire. In this guise, he is impervious to bullets and can take a serious amount of abuse. He can summon hellfire and can avail himself of the Penance Stare, an ability which allows him to mete out punishment to evildoers. And he has that smokin' hog...Mephistopheles contracts the Rider to take out Blackheart. But, naturally, it won't be easy. Blackheart has gathered into his own circle the Hidden (aka the Nephilim), three fallen angels with the elemental powers of air, water, and earth. And Blackheart also has a plan. He aims to dig up the lost contract stolen by another Ghost Rider one hundred fifty years ago, a contract boasting the names of souls so evil that that particular Rider rebelled against the Devil and skedaddled. Possessing this contract would presumably give Blackheart the edge over his father.Now, special effects-wise, I have absolutely no complaints. It's very hard to improve on the look of the Ghost Rider. Really, what's cooler than a burning skull? In terms of the Rider's physical manifestation, the movie, wisely, stuck with what's worked in the Marvel Universe. All the Rider's toys look awesome: the Hellcycle, his hellfire, and his flame-wracked chain. The Hidden, while turning out to be nothing but supernatural sissies after all, however, look very cool. And, when the Rider and the caretaker go for that one final ride together near the end, riding to ""Ghost Riders in the Sky,"" well, the theater audience erupted in appreciative applause.Nicolas Cage has declared himself a longtime fan of Ghost Rider (he even has a tattoo of the Rider), and he brings to the film a sincerity and a sense of fun, as well as his patented idiosyncratic touches. In his hands, Johnny Blaze is definitely a more intriguing character, if more off the wall. Eva Mendes, beautiful girl, but her performance is somewhat lackluster here. What's missing, I think, is that fire and sexy spunk she displayed in movies such as HITCH and OUT OF TIME. Her best scene in this film may have been when she is stood up by Johnny in a restaurant date and she then half-jokingly asks the waiter if he thinks she's pretty (that waiter's a knucklehead, but I did chuckle at his response). Peter Fonda mines nostalgia for all its worth from his iconic Captain America role in EASY RIDER as he gets back in a motorcycle flick, though he doesn't ride a bike. I never was quite sure if I ended up liking his performance as Mephistopheles or not. Meanwhile, Sam Elliott continues to be his ol' reliable self. He even gets a bit of a chance to relive his  more virile cowboy days.Now an assortment of beefs. My personal opinion is that neither Matt Long (young Johnny) nor Raquel Alessi (young Roxanne) adequately bear a resemblance to their older counterparts. Not a big deal, but it did throw me off the viewing mood for a nano-second. The fact that the three elemental antagonists succumbed too easily to Ghost Rider bugged me somewhat. The earth elemental, in particular, had me irked with the discarding of his own element in his attack on the Rider. And when a comic book is translated into cinema, surely we can dispense with the stilted, hokey dialogue. As it is, I had to endure unabashed corn such as ""My name is Legion - for we are many"" and ""I'm the only one that walk in both worlds - I'm Ghost Rider."" Pleeease.But, even with my gripes, I still find myself overwhelmingly in favor of GHOST RIDER. He's such a viscerally compelling figure, and I can never have enough of his head just, poof, combusting. The CG is so well done. Of course, there are a few dead spots here and there in this flick (some in the opening sequences, some in the scenes with Cage and Elliott), but, mostly, the viewer's attention is engaged. And, certainly, whenever the Rider is on camera, the movie takes on a whole new dimension of appeal. I like the fact that the Ghost Rider seems to be more of a raging force of nature, more his own entity, rather than a controlled extension of Johnny Blaze, although, undoubtedly, he exercises somewhat of an influence. Another factor in this movie's favor is its sense of humor, some of which originates from Nicolas Cage himself and his quirkiness. I've read that Nicolas Cage has already provincially agreed to a sequel. I absolutely believe this inaugural GHOST RIDER will demand sequels.",4,Ghost Rider versus Easy Rider,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,6499,"['Be', 'warned', 'SPOILERS.I', 'liked', 'GHOST', 'RIDER',

1065602,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B000OVLBEO,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[0, 0]","""Ghost Rider"" stars Nicholas Cage as a supernatural super-hero.  By day he is Johnny Blaze, a stunt biker in the vein of Evel Kneivel, who takes the nickname of his inspiration too far when as a teen he signs a document by a mystery man (Peter Fonda) to prevent his father from dying of cancer.  Tragically, Blaze's dad dies in a motorcycle crash, and the mystery man turns out to be Mephistopheles, who promises that the young Blaze's soul is now his.One fateful evening, Blaze begins to turn into a bizarre avenger, whose body is made bone, flame, and black leather.  He is now the Ghost Rider, the ""bounty hunter"" for the underworld, who will seek vengeance and punishment on wayward demons who venture from Hades to Earth without permission from the boss.Eva Mendes is Roxanne Simpson, a TV reporter and former childhood sweetheart of Blaze, who becomes the target of the main villain, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), the son of Mephistopheles who wants to take over the family business by unleashing an apocalypse on Earth so he can have an evil army to take out his old man.  A nice supporting nod is from Sam Elliot, as Caretaker, Blaze's mentor in handling his new powers.The movie is aware of its Marvel comic book roots and it is over-the-top where it needs to be.If there are any quibbles, it's that the action sequences tend to end rather abruptly-- allegedly, budgetary constraints were the reason for this.Overall this film is an entertaining popcorn flick.  Despite the nominal occult themes, the film isn't particularly scary, and at PG-13, most of the violence is directed at clearly inhuman monster-villains.

For the most part it was a success.  Far from award-winning, it's simple, light entertainment with awesome special effects.After learning his father has cancer, circus motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze makes a Faustian bargain with Satan.  The deal: Johnny's soul for his father's health.  What Johnny doesn't realize is that Satan can't be trusted (How he didn't know that I have no idea), and he's now committed himself to be Satan's bounty hunter.  Whenever near evil he transforms into a ghost rider: a chain-clad flaming skeleton in a leather jacket who rides a tricked-out, demonic motorcycle.  His primary mission is to act as a spirit of vengeance and take down Satan's son, Blackheart, who wishes to take over earth.Aside from the commitment Cage made to get into shape for the movie, the other eye candy involved is Eva Mendes, who looks incredible.  In nearly every scene not saturated with special effects, she steals the scene.  The real star, however, is the CGI.  A flaming motorcycle ripping through cities, roaring up the side of skyscrapers and melting windows, capturing evil-doers in a flaming chain, sending hell-fire flying into the sky, destroying everything and causing small animals to spontaneously combust, it's all in a day's work for a ghost rider.  That's what I call a good time.The major problems with this film are the poor plot and complete lack of character development.  Sure, there is the ghost rider legend, but beyond that we don't really get to hear an explanation for his antagonists, their quest, or much less anyone else.

The Ghost Rider Comics are famous and just like Spiderman and X-Men; to make an adaptation out of it requires a lot of work. It's not something you can easily slap on the big screen; both longtime fans and newcomers have to find the same power that makes Ghost Rider what it is in the comics, on the big screen. So having seen this I admit that although it had a few sore spots and kinks, I admire the work put into the movie.Nic Cage is pretty good in being Johnny Blaze and Ghost Rider. He adds much needed charisma to the movie and the emotional romance which was fairly traditional. Some of the superhero battles are neither sophisticated nor fantastic, to the point on making a grade. Eva Mendez was simply stunning and has out-standing beauty, but never had much chance to do anything ground breaking in this movie. The villain in the movie let the side down; Wes and Peter were both below par with their efforts similar to Eva. Sam Elliot was great even though he didn't have much to play with. I felt he was the only person who stayed in character and delivered his role gracefully throughout the entire movie.Special effects were very good considering the tight budget constraints; the direction was adequate if nothing stunning. Script was awful along with the plot, but to be expected in a comic book movie that tries to be nothing else other than a comic book movie not like the fantastic Batman Begins and Spider-man. This could have been another film in the vein of the Blade series instead of being a PG-13 safe movie viewing. A real shame here as I like the Ghost Rider character (though I've never read the comics). This could have been a great new series for fans missing their Blade style comic movie. Playing it save with a PG-13 script on subject matter that is truly R all the way really hurt this one!! Beside that it's a good effort and is still worth watching on big screen.",4,[3.5]--Fun.

He cures his cancer but never promises that he wouldn't die some other way...Johny then takes off and leaves his g/f behind. He continues as a professional stuntman in his father's footsteps. Eva Mendes ""his former g/f"" re-enters his life and she's now a reporter. He wants to get back into her life but he never makes it to their date because Mephistopheles also re-enters his life and he him to be his new bounty hunter. He turns him into a skull faced monster who can punish sinners. Cage has no control of his actions when he is the Ghostrider and automatically has to go head to head with Mephistopheles' son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wants to become stronger than Mephistopheles. So he wants Ghostrider to stop him and his other demon followers.But Blaze learns to control his new powers and wants to use them for good. A mysterious grave digger (Sam Elliot) knows all about what is going on and wants to help Blaze learn how to handle his new powers. The effects are decent and the look of the film is good. Nicolas Cage who was supposed to play Superman like 10 yrs ago shows that he's surprisingly good in a comic book movie. He's actually the best thing about the movie. Peter Fonda is also good as Mephistopheles or I guess you can just call him the Devil. He's cool in the movie and it would've been nice to see more of him instead of the slightly annoying Bentley. Donal Logue (Blade, Grounded for Life) adds some humor as Blaze's trainer but he's not really used enough either. Sam Elliot also gives one of the better performances in the movie.It's not really performances that hold this movie back from being great. Director Mark Steven Johnson handles the beginning of the movie just like he did with Daredevil. Although the father in Daredevil was developed better and we cared about his relationship with his son. We barely even see the dad enough here to learn to care about his fate. A lot of this movie just feels like one scene clunked onto another and another. It has it's fun parts but it would've been better if the movie wasn't done sorta sloppy. It can feel like Johnson is directing it with his eyes close. I think he did a much better job with the under-rated Daredevil. This movie has it's entertaining parts and Cage is super cool in the movie as are a lot of the supporting actors. But I had to remind myself that I even seen the movie.

The bike cage's character rides is very nice both before and after transformation. Eva mendes is pretty and sam Elliot does a great job. Now to the bad which starts with Nicholas cage's acting which I found to be over the top to the point of being comical and not very believable at all. Second the villians which for being things of such evil I found very unthreatening. The battles are over in minutes with it hardly ever feeling like they were a real threat to the ghost rider. The ghost rider had such potential to be a great movie but failed in the end I think. A story like this could have been a epic battle between good and evil but instead is watered and toned down for todays audiences. Everything comes off as a complete joke.

1065635,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000OVLBEO,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 4]","When director Mark Steven Johnson was lucky enough to be tapped to helm Fox's big screen adaptation of ""Daredevil"" he turned out to be an absolute perfect fit for the genre. Not only was he a fan of the comic, but he wanted to go against the Hollywood grain, and stay as true to the source material as possible. A move that was bold, but had proven successful several times over (""Spiderman"", ""Batman"", and ""Superman"" are good examples), and the choice proved to work out well for ""Daredevil"" as well, resulting in big box office numbers and DVD sales. So, after achieving success with his first comic book adaptation, Mark moved on to a character even more obscure than Daredevil, and since he'd proven himself with great success previously, Sony gave him the OK to both write and direct what he hoped would be Marvel's next big franchise, ""Ghost Rider"" starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes.""Ghost Rider"" is the origin story of Marvel's self-proclaimed 'Spirit of Vengeance'. After having sold his soul to the demon Mephistopholes (Peter Fonda) to save his father, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) must become the Ghost Rider, a bounty hunter whose purpose is to send escaped demons back to Hell. As if being a demon hunter wasn't enough to deal with, Johnny is trying to rekindle a relationship with an old girlfriend (Eva Mendes), while trying to gain control over the entity within him. Now, a demon named Blackheart (Wes Bentley) along with his minions, have come to Earth in search of a group of evil souls that was hidden by a previous Ghost Rider many years ago, Mephistopholes summons the Ghost Rider to stop Blackheart before he gains control of the souls and destroys the Earth.""Ghost Rider"" was one of those movies where I wasn't sure how it was going to fare at the box office. I had hope that it would do well, but I was aware of the fact that the character was not one of Marvel's most popular or well-known, unlike Spiderman and X-Men, but then again Daredevil wasn't known of too much outside of the comic book medium. The biggest advantages that this movie had going for it was the fact that Nicolas Cage (""Con Air"") was attached as the lead star, so fans of his work would surely turn out, Eva Mendes (""Hitch"") is popular with guys so that would put some more butts in the seats, and the director had achieved commercial success with his previous effort ""Daredevil"" so he had garnered some faith amongst comic book fans. With these advantages ""Ghost Rider"" had a decent chance of holding its own at the box office and possibly spawning a future film franchise. But did it deliver the goods, or was it a film that should have remained in development hell where it had stayed for so many years.I personally enjoyed ""Ghost Rider"", even though most critics hated it, I felt that it was a very faithful comic book adaptation, and a rather difficult one at that, since the history of the character has been tweaked over and over throughout the years at Marvel. Director/writer Mark Steven Johnson did a very good job of taking all the various histories of the character, finding the common themes among them and weaving them together to make a cohesive story that was full of terrific special effects, fights, drama, and even some comedy. He proved himself a very capable director for the genre with ""Daredevil"", and even though this movie isn't as dramatic as his previous effort, it was every bit as engaging and taking a character that is relatively obscure in the mainstream and making him popular is a tremendous achievement and one that both he and Marvel can be proud of.The actors did very well with their characters, for the most part. Nicolas Cage was an excellent choice for Johnny Blaze, Cage's quirkiness as an actor made him ideal for such a far-fetched role. Eva Mendes was solid as the love interest, early on I thought her performance seemed a little off, but she rallied after her first couple scenes and made the character hers. Sam Elliott was great as Caretaker, his scenes with Nic Cage were used mostly for exposition, but he managed to make them fun, and actually stole the scenes away from Cage every time. Peter Fonda, though not in the movie a whole lot, appeared to be enjoying his role as Mephistopholes, imbuing every line with a hint of malice, and delivering a more restrained performance than most actors when playing a role like his. Which brings me to the weakest member of the cast, Wes Bentley. Wes played the role of Blackheart so over-the-top that he seemed almost goofy in places rather than scary, near the end of the movie he finally scaled back his performance and began to deliver his lines with much more realism and finally fulfilled the villainous role he was in. For the most part if the special effects team hadn't done some tweaking to his facial features and the sound team wouldn't have manipulated his voice, Wes wouldn't have been very effective as the villain, but their work saved his early scenes in the movie, giving his performance a little more balance, but not much.However, with all the great performances, and even the weak one by Wes Bentley, ""Ghost Rider"" wouldn't have amounted to anything if it weren't for the outstanding special effects work that brought ol' flamehead to life. The special effects team worked hard to get the digital fire to look realistic, which is not an easy task given how random fire acts, and many times CGI created fire can be easily spotted when compared to real flames. But this time was different, the effects team not only made the fire realistic, but also managed to convey emotions using the flames, by playing with shadows on the skull of Ghost Rider, and also giving the flame a blue hue when he was calming down (a decision that is not actually scientifically accurate, a flame actually turns blue as it gets hotter not as it cools). The Hell Cycle also featured some CGI enhancements, specifically the flaming wheels. In the comics, the wheels were pure flame, but for the movie the decision was made to have actual wheels be engulfed in flames to lend more weight to the motorcycle on screen. The effects for all the demons that Ghost Rider must fight and all the powers he uses to dispose of them were all excellently rendered and are truly top-notch in the field of CGI. The best looking effect sequence was the ride across the desert with Ghost Rider and his predecessor riding side by side, that scene alone is a prime example of how high the quality of the CGI was in this film.Assisting the special effects wizards were the sound technicians who were tasked with the difficult job of creating sounds that could be passed off as being supernaturally created. In this task the techs succeeded brilliantly, the sounds were all very well crafted, all of the enhanced voices were very cool, most were only subtle enhancements (for Mephistopholes and Blackheart), but Ghost Rider's was by far the best vocal enhancement and the most involved. Every line Nicolas Cage spoke for Ghost Rider was enhanced through several filters to achieve the perfect sound that was described as being a 'deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar' mixed with his voice.As a side note, there are two versions of ""Ghost Rider"" available, the theatrical release and the extended cut. Both versions of the film are very good, but I would have to say the extended cut is the better version to watch, with approximately 20 minutes of footage inserted back into the film. This version of the movie contains much more depth, featuring several scenes that explain a few plotlines a little more, and just serves to flesh the story out a little better, making for a much more fulfilling movie experience.All in all, ""Ghost Rider"" is a solid comic book adaptation, that stays true to its roots, delivering an entertaining ride that doesn't disappoint.""Ghost Rider"" is rated PG-13 (for both theatrical and extended cuts) and contains violence and language.",4,Unleash The Spirit of Vengeance...,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,7932,"['When', 'director', 'Mark', 'Steven',

As a matter of fact, both father and son do the stunt motorcycle jumps for a carney type act.  When young Johnny finds out daddy has severe cancer, he sort of accidentally makes a deal with the devil.  He sells his soul to extend daddy's life. That kind of puts a halt to his future love life with girlfriend Rachel.  The good news is, Johnny gets to stay alive and wait until the devil needs him to perform a special task.  Johnny gets to be the devil's bounty hunter (The Ghost Rider) when the time is right.  He goes after the bad guys and collects their souls for the devil, he also gets to try to hunt down and battle Blackheart (the devil's son) over a list of souls from a long time ago.  This time, Peter Fonda does NOT ride the cycle.  He plays the devil.It's the story about a good guy who makes a mistake trying to help his father and winds up fighting evil.  The story line is good and the computer graphic imaging is outstanding!  They do some awesome effects when Johnny changes into the Ghost Rider, I mean it is some really wild effects with fire and stuff.Disc 1Never before-seen footage-(extended cut)Commentary with producerCommentary with Writer/DirectorAnd visual Effects SupervisorDisc 23 Making of documentariesFeaturettes ChronicilingGhost Rider Comic Book HistoryAnimaticsI really enjoyed the show and I don't watch a lot of movies anymore.",5,The devil's bounty hunter,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1582,"['2-Disc', 'extended', 'cut', 'version', '2', 'hours', 'special', 'features', 'widescreen', 'version', 'approximately', '123', 'minutes', 'hair', '2', 'hours.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Johnny', 'son', 'Evil', 'Keneval', 'type', 'guy', 'matter', 'fact', 'father', 'son', 'do', 'stunt', 'motorcycle', 'jumps', 'carney', 'type', 'act', 'When', 'young', 'Johnny', 'out', 'daddy', 'severe', 'cancer', 'sort', 'accidentally', 'deal', 'devil', 'soul', 'extend', 'daddy', 'life', 'kind', 'halt', 'future', 'love', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'good', 'news', 'Johnny', 'stay', 'alive', 'wait', 'devil', 'perform', 'special', 'task', 'Johnny', 'be', 'devil', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'when', 'time', 'right', 'bad', 'guys', 'collects', 'souls', 'devil', 'also', 'try', 'hunt', 'down', 'battle', 'Blackheart', 'devil', 'son', 'list', 'souls', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'time', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'NOT', 'ride', 'cycle', 'devil.It', 'story', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'mistake', 'trying', 'help', 'father', 'up', 'fighting', 'evil', 'story', 'line', 'good', 'computer', 'graphic', 'imaging', 'outstanding', 'do', 'awesome', 'effects', 'when', 'Johnny', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'mean', 'really', 'wild', 'effects', 'fire', 'stuff.Disc', '1Never', 'before-seen', 'footage-', 'extended', 'cut', 'Commentary', 'producerCommentary', 'Writer/DirectorAnd', 'visual', 'Effects', 'SupervisorDisc', '23', 'Making', 'documentariesFeaturettes', 'ChronicilingGhost', 'Rider', 'Comic', 'Book', 'HistoryAnimaticsI', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'anymore']",N/A

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[6, 12]","Any film that has motorcycles, demons, stunts involving helicopters and flaming skulls has to be great, right?  Not exactly.  ""Ghost Rider"" is far from being a great film.  In fact, it's pretty bad in spots.  What makes it worthy of four stars, however, is the fact that the director and the cast seem to be having a whole lot of fun with a story that comes from way out of left field.In ""Ghost Rider,"" Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) makes a deal with the devil, Mephistopheles (a cheeky Peter Fonda), in order to save his father's life.  As is always the case, the devil has an alternate plan in the works and tricks Johnny into becoming his lifelong bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider.  Blaze goes on to live what seems to be a charmed life where he dances with death constantly but never perishes.  When the devil's son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), finally surfaces on Earth looking for one of his daddy's old contracts, the devil calls upon his rider to stop him.  Blaze transforms into the very imposing and very flaming Ghost Rider and seeks out Blackheart.  If he carries out this one mission, the devil agrees to rid him of his curse.  While on the hunt, Blaze has to juggle a rekindling romance between himself and his old flame, Roxanne (Eva Mendes), a stunt biking career managed by the very concerned Mack (a funny Donal Logue), and the belief that he's a murderer.  He also befriends the Caretaker (Sam Elliott), who seems to have all of the answers.Overall, this film is not great.  It's just that is has a wonderfully stylized feel with deep blue and fiery red colors all about it that plays with your inner child.  The atmosphere is light, despite the demonic undertones.  I often caught myself going ga-ga over the excellent CGI effects as the Rider tore up the side of a skyscraper or took out Blackheart's lackeys with tongue firmly in cheek.  Cage hams it up as Blaze, channeling the soul of Elvis as he swaggers across the screen.  Fonda and Elliott, both silver screen steadies, eat their respective roles up with demonic flare and lawdog wisdom.  Even the supposedly sinister Blackheart is fun to watch.  Most actors weighed down with dismal dialogue such as Bentley is given would collapse on the screen, but Bentley manages to make you laugh with the delivery of classic one-liners such as, ""I don't think so!""  Eva Mendes seems to be the only person in the film who is remotely trying to take her role seriously, but even she seems to be having fun with this tale as well.Mark Steven Johnson (""Daredevil"") knows how to make a film very cool despite a dodgy script.  Johnson uses some twisty camera angles to drop the viewer right into the middle of the action.  The fight sequences are fairly light on actual human action and rely heavily on CGI.  This makes for a rather weak climax, but you can't help but watch it.""Ghost Rider"" isn't for everybody.  If you're a comic purist, you'll probably scoff at the way that this film picks and chooses elements of the entire ""Ghost Rider"" canon and collects them into one character.  If you're an action fan, you may grow tired of the constant CGI battle sequences.  However, if you've always loved B-movies and wonder what one would look like with a very large budget and a ""knows what's cool looking"" director guiding it, ""Ghost Rider"" is a definite purchase.  I personally enjoy it more than a lot of the other comic flicks I've seen.  With all of the dark and menacing adaptations flying around lately, it's nice to see a comic film that's just pure fun.",4,It Will Surprise You,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,3518,"['film', 'motorcycles', 'demons', 'stunts', 'involving', 'helicopters', 'flaming', 'skulls', 'be', 'great', 'right', 'Not', 'exactly', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'far', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'fact', 'pretty', 'bad', 'spots', 'What', 'worthy', 'four', 'stars', 'however', 'fact', 'director', 'cast', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'story', 'way', 'left', 'field.In', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'deal', 'devil', 'Mephistopheles', 'cheeky', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'order', 'save', 'father', 'life', 'always', 'case', 'devil', 'alternate', 'plan', 'works', 'tricks', 'Johnny', 'becoming', 'lifelong', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Blaze', 'live', 'what', 'be', 'charmed', 'life', 'where', 'death', 'constantly', 'never', 'perishes', 'When', 'devil', 'son', 'Blackheart', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'finally', 'surfaces', 'Earth', 'looking', 'one', 'daddy', 'old', 'contracts', 'devil', 'rider', 'stop', 'Blaze', 'transforms', 'very', 'imposing', 'very', 'flaming', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'out', 'Blackheart', 'out', 'one', 'mission', 'devil', 'rid', 'curse', 'hunt', 'Blaze', 'juggle', 'rekindling', 'romance', 'old', 'flame', 'Roxanne', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'stunt', 'biking', 'career', 'managed', 'very', 'concerned', 'Mack', 'funny', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'belief', 'murderer', 'also', 'Caretaker', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'who', 'have', 'answers.Overall', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'just', 'wonderfully', 'stylized', 'feel', 'deep', 'blue', 'fiery', 'red', 'colors', 'inner', 'child', 'atmosphere', 'light', 'demonic', 'undertones', 'often', 'caught', 'going', 'ga-ga', 'excellent', 'CGI', 'effects', 'Rider', 'tore', 'up', 'side', 'skyscraper', 'took', 'out', 'Blackheart', 'lackeys', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'cheek', 'Cage', 'hams', 'up', 'Blaze', 'channeling', 'soul', 'Elvis', 'screen', 'Fonda', 'Elliott', 'silver', 'screen', 'steadies', 'eat', 'respective', 'up', 'demonic', 'flare', 'lawdog', 'wisdom', 'Even', 'supposedly', 'sinister', 'Blackheart', 'fun', 'watch', 'Most', 'actors', 'weighed', 'down', 'dismal', 'dialogue', 'such', 'Bentley', 'given', 'would', 'collapse', 'screen', 'Bentley', 'make', 'delivery', 'classic', 'one-liners', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'film', 'who', 'remotely', 'trying', 'take', 'role', 'seriously', 'even', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'tale', 'well.Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'Daredevil', 'how', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'cool', 'dodgy', 'script', 'Johnson', 'twisty', 'camera', 'angles', 'drop', 'viewer', 'right', 'middle', 'action', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'fairly', 'light', 'actual', 'human', 'action', 'rely', 'heavily', 'CGI', 'rather', 'weak', 'climax', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'Ghost', 'Rider', ""n't"", 'everybody', ""'re"", 'comic', 'purist', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'scoff', 'way', 'film', 'picks', 'elements', 'entire', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'canon', 'one', 'character', ""'re"", 'action', 'fan', 'may', 'grow', 'tired', 'constant', 'CGI', 'battle', 'sequences', 'However', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'B-movies', 'wonder', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'look', 'very', 'large', 'budget', 'what', 'cool', 'looking', 'director', 'guiding', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'definite', 'purchase', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'more', 'lot', 'other', 'comic', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dark', 'menacing', 'adaptations', 'flying', 'around', 'lately', 'nice', 'see', 'comic', 'film', 'just', 'pure', 'fun']",N/A

Literally every thing went wrong in this movie. The CG is horrible. The writing is horrible. The action is nonexistent. The fact that you are even looking up this DVD is shameful.The story...I don't even want to have to explain this crap because it was so bad. Johnny Blaze and his father Barton Blaze are carnival workers who amaze audiences with their motorcycles stunts. Johnny is in love with a woman named Roxanne and they want to run away together. Johnny soon realizes his father has Cancer and is very upset by it. So he goes to the carnival to play with his bikes. Suddenly the Devil shows up and says that he'll cure Barton's Cancer if Johnny will sign his soul over. Johnny accepts and Barton's cancer goes away. Then, the Devil turns out to be a complete a-hole and kills his father anyway. The Devil tells him to forget about his friends, family, and loved ones. So he does and rides off.Johnny, played by Nicolas Cage, goes on to live a fairly normal life. Oddly enough he has friends and still remembers everything about the girl he once loved. Obviously the Devil had no idea what he was doing. The Devil then tells Johnny that he's going to have to kill Blackheart and The Hidden Ones. Yes, that is what they are called.The beginning segment that shows his carnival days with his dad is horrible. The entire part is full of bad acting, bad CG, and bad everything. His later years are basically the same thing. The Hidden Ones are elemental demons that Johnny seems to be fighting for no reason, but lack anything really cool about them. Nicolas Cage literally kills all of them in one swift move. If all else fails, he uses his stare of death. Yes...he stares at them...to death. He was wasting his time; he could've just made them watch this movie and they would've died. After he completely dominants these villains you will hear great lines like ""It's time to clear the air"" or some random laugh. This is all added in with the fact that he has this evil demon voice and sounds like a 12-year-old girl when he acts that way. It eliminates any possibility of Ghost Rider having anything cool about him at all. The entire thing is so cheesy you'll think you've become a cheese nip.At least you get some cool fight scenes right? The movie Bambi had more action in it. Nicolas Cage just waves his badly computer generated chain around and the bad guys just vanish...or he stares at them and they die. I mean...this is pathetic.Overall this movie has no redeeming qualities to it at all. If you loved the comic book, don't watch this movie. If you love movies, don't watch it. If you love your kids, don't watch this because I am afraid of what might happen to them in your rage over this movie.

1065645,AJW6KG5ATLE8H,B000OVLBEO,"K. Olsen-Keyser ""BookChick""","[1, 3]","Rarely does a movie based on a comic stay true to the original concepts of its graphic cousin. Surprisingly, little has been changed from the original Ghost Rider tome, which makes this film an even larger disappointment.Nick Cage, as usual, adds a bit of his own jokiness to the role including a dash of that overdone Elvis impression of his. There are a few rare moments in the portrayal of Johnny Blaze that makes the audience feel for his predicament. Unfortunately for Cage, those moments are acted out by the younger Blaze played by Matt Long.Eva Mendes is the breast-tacular Roxanne Simpson, Blaze's lost childhood love turned journalist. (This script left out the part about Roxanne being Johnny's stepsister and maybe that was for the best - eeew!) Mendes as a journalist is about as believable as Madonna playing the Holy Mother Mary - no offence to the Pop Queen, but it just isn't happening. When will Holly-would learn that the pretty face also has to have some acting talent to back it up?The movie falls all over itself, first taking the material very seriously and then almost poking fun at the script. One cannot tell if this is a comedy or a serious drama. Do I laugh at the dim-witted jokes? It was confusing to say the least. Scenes are completely disjointed throughout the movie making the pace irregular and leaving one with the sense that the cutting room floor is littered with pieces of what could have been an awesome film.There was a great deal of wasted scenes and buildup, particularly where the romance in the film was concerned. Most would agree that they bought a ticket to see Ghost Rider combing the streets for the souls of the damned not trying to make kissy face. After wading half way through the movie's starry-eyed mire, The Rider's transformation was somewhat disappointing with Cage screaming and walking around like Frankenstein. Don't expect any witty dialogue from Ghost Rider once he has changed either. Its all lame one liners and worn out clich&eacute;s from our flaming cranium hero.There was a somewhat interesting handling of The Rider on his bike of hell fire. It was fascinating how the bike tore up the roadway beneath it, but, would it have? Hell fire after all is a supernatural fire, only acting like real fire when The Rider chooses. One supposes that Ghost Rider had a penchant for causing collateral damage as he flew through the city streets blowing up cars and causing general mayhem. Naturally, there were a few great shots of cars flying through empty stores. But why? Why waste all that man-power and money on showing cars blowing up when it should have been spent on CGI and better costumes.Which brings us to the bad guys. Why do the bad guys always have to where long leather trench coats? Was there some law passed in Holly-would about villain attire that we are not aware of? Please, for the love of  Edith Head, let the bad guys where something besides black leather and paisley velvet, especially when our hero is dressed in a black leather biker outfit!Just who are the villains? That would be Blackheart and his merry minions, The Hidden, angels cast out of heaven hiding within the elements of earth(Grissel), water (Wallow) and air (Abigor). Blackheart has been reduced to showing up only in human form and his shape shifting abilities are never mentioned or explored. The Hidden could have been very interesting villains but sadly, they were killed off too quickly.The other heavies are the city police, who happen to find Blaze's license plate at the scene of a crime. Apparently, finding circumstantial evidence at a crime scene can lead to about 10 police cars coming to your doorstep to ask you a few questions. In this town, if you do come ""downtown"" quietly and answer all their questions in a civilized manner, they then have the right to throw you in jail! Well, that is Texas justice for you.The music for this film was a tad disappointing as the remix of ""Ghostrider"" by the Rollins Band should have been added in some fashion - although Henry, being very astute, may not have wanted any of his music associated with this steaming pile of ...well you know.Get this DVD on sale and only if you just have to have it to complete your ultimate Marvel collection.",2,There are only a handful of comic book movies that truly leave an impression -

Little bags of candy for 4 bucks!?  Such a ripoff.  Anyways...) its a fun movie, but it tries too hard, and it doesn't know what it wants to be.  For exaample, it has some pretty serious stuff going on(Demons, Satan, Hell) and it tries to make it into a campy Spiderman-like movie with ""great"" one-liners.The first problem is that Nick Cage is no Tobey Maguire.  I remember telling one of my friends that the movie was great as long as we didn't see Cage's face.  And the most I laughed occured when a baby(Yes a little baby, please people, don't bring little kids into movie theatres!)started crying right after Ghost Rider turned back into Nick Cage.  And I do seperate them because I rooted for Ghost Rider, I really did.  But Nick Cage........well......I wouldn't have been too heartbroken if he got beaten to a pulp.Getting back to the first's paragraphs problem.  So we've got Devils and stuff running around and the movie feels like a horror movie that doesn't want to be a horror movie.  I think this would have been better as a darker ""R"" rated movie.  Spidey and the Fantastic Four are built for witty one-liners and just campy fun, this movie had a serious feel to it.Now to the Direction.  Its not that great.  MSJ really needs to stop it.  Daredevil was an alright 3/5 movie, but it could have been so much more, just as this could have.  The effects are good, although some segments do feel like a video game.It does have some cool effects and the villains are nasty but Nick Cage brings it down.  I just could not see him as Ghost Rider.

And it isn't that the dialog barely resembles how human beings talk. (Sadly, it only occasionally breaks through to ""it's so bad it's funny"" terrain.) Taken as a whole, it's hard to imagine a worse superhero movie, and that's taking into account such dreck as The Fantastic Four (both versions) and Daredevil.I don't know what has happened to Nicolas Cage, by the way.

The only reason I remember this movie from the theater is the point when he strips naked to reveal some killer abs, at which point everyone in the hall was really into the film for about two minutes.This film has everything going for it - great special effects, a villain with real power and charisma (in fact, he was the star of the show, for me), and a gorgeous heroine who should have been given more screentime. Why they chose the old and out of talent Nicholas Cage to headline this otherwise stellar enterprise is beyond me. I mean, the man has nothing. Virtually nothing at all. There is no screen presence here, no memorable dialogue, and he really looks like one of those 50+ men who inject themselves with botox and believe that they look 25 again. Seriously, it IS that bad - I dare you to watch it and say anything remotely positive about his disgusting performance in this film.Granted, a film of this sort is ludicrous, but when a TV show can get the premise better (""Supernatural"" anyone?), its time to worry. I can say that the bike stunts were nice, and the 'head' effects were pretty stellar too. Its just that the romance is a bit convoluted even for a fantasy film of this sort, and lead actress Eva Mendes looks so detached and disinterested in her surroundings, its as if she belongs in some other film entirely. Now, this is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, but what happened to the hair and make-up here. Eva could have been presented so, so much better.The climax was great though - I always enjoy the concept of good vs. evil, and the storyline of selling your soul to the devil. This film captures that, but when compared to other films of a somewhat similar genre (such as the far superior and almost classic ""Constantine""), it falters quite a bit. For that reason, this remains a novelty piece with very little repeat value. Well, maybe you'll watch it twice if you're into bikes, but beyond that, believe me, its a tiring exercise.Two Stars. Casting the overrated and useless Nicholas Cage in this ruined all their chances. I can imagine someone like James Franco (best actor in Hollywood right now, right after Leo) pulling this off. In fact, I spent half my time in the seat wondering how wonderful it would be if a certain scene had been given to James Franco instead - now THATS the ""Ghost Rider"" I want to see.Watch this if you want to watch an over-the-hill and hideous Nicholas Cage run around in tights like a little girl. If that sort of thing is your bag, grab this immediately. If its not, I suggest writing a letter to the studio protesting the ruin of an otherwise possibly excellent film.",2,Nicholas Cage on Botox : An Experiment gone Wrong,1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,2764,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'fan', 'new', 'lows', 'even', 'abysmal', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'only', 'reason', 'remember', 'movie', 'theater', 'point', 'when', 'naked', 'reveal', 'killer', 'abs', 'point', 'everyone', 'hall', 'was', 'really', 'film', 'about', 'two', 'minutes.This', 'film', 'everything', 'going', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'villain', 'real', 'power', 'charisma', 'fact', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'gorgeous', 'heroine', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'screentime', 'Why', 'chose', 'old', 'talent', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'headline', 'otherwise', 'stellar', 'enterprise', 'mean', 'man', 'nothing', 'Virtually', 'nothing', 'screen', 'presence', 'here', 'memorable', 'dialogue', 'really', 'one', '50+', 'men', 'who', 'inject', 'botox', 'believe', 'look', '25', 'again', 'Seriously', 'bad', 'dare', 'watch', 'say', 'anything', 'remotely', 'positive', 'disgusting', 'performance', 'film.Granted', 'film', 'sort', 'ludicrous', 'when', 'TV', 'show', 'can', 'get', 'premise', 'better', 'Supernatural', 'anyone', 'time', 'worry', 'can', 'say', 'bike', 'stunts', 'were', 'nice', ""'head"", 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'stellar', 'too', 'just', 'romance', 'bit', 'convoluted', 'even', 'fantasy', 'film', 'sort', 'lead', 'actress', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'so', 'detached', 'disinterested', 'surroundings', 'other', 'film', 'entirely', 'Now', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Hollywood', 'what', 'happened', 'hair', 'make-up', 'here', 'Eva', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'so', 'so', 'much', 'better.The', 'climax', 'was', 'great', 'always', 'enjoy', 'concept', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'storyline', 'selling', 'soul', 'devil', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'genre', 'such', 'far', 'superior', 'almost', 'classic', 'Constantine', 'quite', 'bit', 'reason', 'novelty', 'piece', 'very', 'little', 'repeat', 'value', 'Well', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'twice', ""'re"", 'bikes', 'believe', 'tiring', 'exercise.Two', 'Stars', 'Casting', 'overrated', 'useless', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'ruined', 'chances', 'can', 'imagine', 'someone', 'James', 'Franco', 'best', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'right', 'now', 'right', 'Leo', 'pulling', 'off', 'fact', 'spent', 'half', 'time', 'seat', 'wondering', 'how', 'wonderful', 'would', 'be', 'certain', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'James', 'Franco', 'instead', 'now', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'want', 'see.Watch', 'want', 'watch', 'over-the-hill', 'hideous', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'run', 'around', 'tights', 'little', 'girl', 'sort', 'thing', 'bag', 'grab', 'immediately', 'not', 'suggest', 'writing', 'letter', 'studio', 'protesting', 'ruin', 'otherwise', 'possibly', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A

1065662,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000OVLBEO,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 5]","Mark Steven Johnson keeps trying to put unlikely heroes up on the screen.  He wrote the story of ""Jack Frost,"" about a father-cum-snowman who tries to bond with his son after he's already died (sorta).  He produced ""Elektra,"" about the jaded and acrobatic wunder-assassin of the same name.  And he wrote and directed ""Daredevil,"" a finely-filmed flop concerning the life and times of a blind do-gooder with super duper hearing.  None of these films were very well received, and their box office receipts were poor, at best.""Ghost Rider"" is like those others with one very important difference; it's making money.  Johnson's budgets have inexplicably risen since each successive flub, and finally it appears to be paying off.  Hell if I know why.  After all, ""Ghost Rider"" adheres to Johnson's superhero formula without much straying; perhaps it's just a matter of a larger fan base or greater advance anticipation.  Or maybe people have stopped taking these kinds of movies so seriously.That's not a bad thing, but it isn't entirely good, either.  The Batman series, for example, was in serious decline precisely because it began to rely entirely on big names, brassy settings and effects, and heaping gobs of camp value.  It wasn't until Christopher Nolan took the franchise and injected a serious dose of soul into it (""Batman Begins"") that people started to pay attention again and see beyond the conventional comic book trappings and into what made (and still makes) comics such a successful industry: the relatable idealism of its metaphors.Where does ""Ghost Rider"" fit into all of this?  Well, you have the typically tortured soul, Johnny Blaze (played as an adult by a slightly stunned Nicolas Cage sporting a chia-pet-esque hairdo), who is the son of a daredevil (wink, wink) and who is even a daredevil himself.  Blaze Jr. accidentally (yes, accidentally!) makes a pact with Mephistopheles (let's call him, oh, I don't know, Satan) which turns him, years later, into a sort of demonic bounty hunter.  Satan (in the guise of Peter Fonda, who fills this role with a sleepy sort of love) hires Blaze/Ghost Rider to catch four rogue demons, one of those demons being (drumroll) Satan's own son (the other three could form a band: Earth, Wind, and ... Water?).Of course there's a love interest (Eva Mendes).  Of course our hero buries himself beneath a mound of self-pity and regret.  Of course there's a wise-cracking buddy (Donal Logue) and a mysterious stranger who is full of key plot points (Sam Elliott).  Those things don't make the movie bad.  In fact, they're a cheeky nod at all of those comic book truisms; they're a silly-serious element to an otherwise gloomy and rather incoherent film.I'll be fair; I'm not a big ""Ghost Rider"" reader, so I don't really know the rules that govern his world, but, equally fairly, the movie doesn't bother explaining them to us.  When Blaze becomes his alter ego, he is a leather-bound skeleton cocooned in flames.  This is cool enough, but it does make it confusing when, for instance, Ghost Rider is almost choked to death by one of the demons (skeletons have esophaguses?).  And his horrific ""Penitence Stare?""  Well, I still don't really know what it does.I try hard not to care, but when you turn your mind away from one thing, there must be something else to turn it to, and there's not much else here.  Batman and Bond both found new life in characters with more humanity, but Ghost Rider's life seems to exist solely in the fire that surrounds him.  Cage as Blaze does a good job of mixing humor with pathos (it's fun just watching him mope), but when he's the blazing Rider, he's all burning bone.  It's hard to gauge the inner turmoils, thoughts, dreams, plans, subterfuges, and conflicts of a hero who wears the exact same skull-grin expression no matter what he's doing.  The special effects of his incindiary bike, his chain-wielding stunts, his tete-a-tetes with the unholy hosts -- those are all popcorn-munching fun; but this reviewer would've been doubly impressed if those same special effects had been employed to do something else: give a skeleton some heart.",3,A Skeleton Walks Into A Bar And Orders A Beer And A Mop,1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,4129,"['Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'trying', 'put', 'unlikely', 'up', 'screen', 'wrote', 'story', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'father-cum-snowman', 'who', 'bond', 'son', 'already', 'died', 'sorta', 'produced', 'Elektra', 'jaded', 'acrobatic', 'wunder-assassin', 'same', 'name', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Daredevil', 'finely-filmed', 'flop', 'concerning', 'life', 'times', 'blind', 'do-gooder', 'super', 'duper', 'hearing', 'None', 'films', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'received', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'were', 'poor', 'best', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'others', 'one', 'very', 'important', 'difference', 'making', 'money', 'Johnson', 'budgets', 'have', 'inexplicably', 'risen', 'successive', 'flub', 'finally', 'be', 'paying', 'off', 'Hell', 'know', 'why', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Johnson', 'superhero', 'formula', 'much', 'straying', 'perhaps', 'just', 'matter', 'larger', 'fan', 'base', 'greater', 'advance', 'anticipation', 'maybe', 'people', 'have', 'stopped', 'taking', 'kinds', 'movies', 'seriously.That', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'good', 'either', 'Batman', 'series', 'example', 'was', 'serious', 'decline', 'precisely', 'began', 'rely', 'entirely', 'big', 'names', 'brassy', 'settings', 'effects', 'heaping', 'gobs', 'camp', 'value', 'was', ""n't"", 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'took', 'franchise', 'injected', 'serious', 'dose', 'soul', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'people', 'started', 'pay', 'attention', 'again', 'see', 'conventional', 'comic', 'book', 'trappings', 'what', 'made', 'still', 'comics', 'such', 'successful', 'industry', 'relatable', 'idealism', 'metaphors.Where', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'fit', 'Well', 'have', 'typically', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'played', 'adult', 'slightly', 'stunned', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'sporting', 'chia-pet-esque', 'hairdo', 'who', 'son', 'daredevil', 'wink', 'wink', 'who', 'even', 'daredevil', 'Blaze', 'Jr.', 'accidentally', 'yes', 'accidentally', 'pact', 'Mephistopheles', 'let', 'call', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Satan', 'years', 'later', 'sort', 'demonic', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Satan', 'guise', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'who', 'role', 'sleepy', 'sort', 'love', 'Blaze/Ghost', 'Rider', 'catch', 'four', 'rogue', 'demons', 'one', 'demons', 'being', 'drumroll', 'Satan', 'own', 'son', 'other', 'three', 'could', 'form', 'band', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Water', '.Of', 'course', 'love', 'interest', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'course', 'hero', 'mound', 'self-pity', 'regret', 'course', 'wise-cracking', 'buddy', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'who', 'full', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'bad', 'fact', ""'re"", 'cheeky', 'nod', 'comic', 'book', 'truisms', ""'re"", 'silly-serious', 'element', 'otherwise', 'gloomy', 'rather', 'incoherent', 'film.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fair', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'reader', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'rules', 'govern', 'world', 'equally', 'fairly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bother', 'explaining', 'When', 'Blaze', 'alter', 'ego', 'leather-bound', 'skeleton', 'cocooned', 'flames', 'cool', 'enough', 'make', 'confusing', 'when', 'instance', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'almost', 'choked', 'death', 'one', 'demons', 'skeletons', 'have', 'esophaguses', 'horrific', 'Penitence', 'Stare', 'Well', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'try', 'hard', 'not', 'care', 'when', 'turn', 'mind', 'away', 'one', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'turn', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'here', 'Batman', 'Bond', 'found', 'new', 'life', 'characters', 'more', 'humanity', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'life', 'exist', 'solely', 'fire', 'Cage', 'Blaze', 'good', 'job', 'mixing', 'humor', 'pathos', 'fun', 'just', 'watching', 'mope', 'when', 'blazing', 'Rider', 'burning', 'bone', 'hard', 'gauge', 'inner', 'turmoils', 'thoughts', 'dreams', 'plans', 'subterfuges', 'conflicts', 'hero', 'who', 'exact', 'same', 'skull-grin', 'expression', 'matter', 'what', 'doing', 'special', 'effects', 'incindiary', 'bike', 'chain-wielding', 'stunts', 'tete-a-tetes', 'unholy', 'hosts', 'are', 'popcorn-munching', 'fun', 'reviewer', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doubly', 'impressed', 'same', 'special', 'effects', 'had', 'been', 'employed', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'give', 'skeleton', 'heart']",N/A

1065676,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000OVLBEO,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[0, 1]","The 2007 comic book-inspired film ""Ghost Rider"", directed & written by Mark Steven Johnson (who also directed & wrote the 2003 film ""Daredevil""), is an entertaining action & fantasy film.  The story focuses on a daredevil motorcycle performer named Johnny Blaze, who, as a teenager (played by Matt Long), performs alongside his motorcycle-riding father Barton (Brett Cullen).  Discovering that his father has terminal cancer, Johnny is paid a visit from an odd stranger who turns out to be the devil (veteran actor Peter Fonda), who offers to cure Johnny's father for Johnny's soul.  Unintentionally agreeing, Johnny's father is miraculously healed, but suddenly & unexpectedly dies after Johnny decides to leave with his teenage girlfriend Roxanne (Raquel Alessi).  Johnny instead leaves by himself, taking only his father's prized chopper.  As an adult (played by Nicolas Cage), Johnny continues to perform, but by doing increasingly dangerous stunts.  He gets another opportunity to connect with Roxanne (played as an adult by Eva Mendes), but is recruited by the devil to do battle with four fearsome demons, of which one is the devil's son named Blackheart (Wes Bentley).  It is then that Johnny transforms into the powerful, burning, skeletal, anti-hero minion named ""ghost rider"", along with his prized chopper, which transforms into a similar burning demonic riding machine.With dazzling special affects to bring the ""ghost rider"", demons & ghosts to life, the film will probably appeal to any comic book aficionado.  Thanks to the acting abilities of Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott (who plays a cemetery caretaker), ""Ghost Rider"" should keep most viewers engaged even though some plot elements are somewhat predictable.

1065680,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000OVLBEO,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 4]","On the surface, Ghost Rider is a cool concept.  I mean, a biker that's a flaming skull--the same skull that is on a lot of bikers' belt buckles?  How could you go wrong with that?The thing is, Ghost Rider looks cool, but he's a comic book character, so he needs to be more fleshed out than just an iconic burning skull.  That's when things get weird.I've always been a fan of modern Ghost Rider, but I never knew how wacky his background really is.  It involves the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and demons from hell.  Surprisingly, the Ghost Rider movie taps into the weirdness and seems to even revel in it.Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) makes a deal with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda, the original Easy Rider): in exchange for saving his father from cancer, Blaze's soul is Mephisto's property.  Of course, the deal turns sour and Blaze discovers that an interesting quirk of his contract: Since Blaze's soul is spoken for, he's nigh indestructible, a trait that's particularly useful in Blaze's career as a daredevil. Eventually, Mephisto comes calling on his debt, and it's a doozy: Mephisto's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) is attempting to usurp his father by absorbing a thousand souls.  And that's when Blaze discovers he actually bursts into flames, his skin melts off, and he becomes the walking skeleton known as Ghost Rider.The plot is reminiscent of Blade in that the bad guy is rebelling against his destiny, filled with a grand plan that basically translates to: ""I'll do everything the other bad guys do, only ten thousand times bigger!"" In Blackheart's case, it's a town that sold its collective souls to the devil in another contract.  If Blackheart can collect, it will be enough to help him take over the world.  MUAAHAHAHAHAH.Ahem.  Anyway, there are some other characters, like Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendez, who can rock a dress like nobody's business), and a former Ghost Rider himself, Caretaker (Same Elliott).  They're mostly window dressing really for Ghost Rider to strut his stuff.  Ghost Rider (actually a demon bound to Johnny's soul, but why quibble) is a CGI marvel of chains, flames, and a demonic motorcycle that defies physics.  The Four Horsemen have been replaced with three elemental demons (Gressil, Wallow, and Abigor) instead, who are really just special effects rather than actual characters.What's interesting about Ghost Rider is that the film takes a leather-wearing bike-riding demon to its logical conclusion, complete with SWAT teams and a shootout in the middle of the city.  Then it shifts to a supernatural battle with the demon family, interspersed with Johnny Blaze's comedic struggles with his nightlife.  Occasionally, Ghost Rider does that thing that drove me crazy about the Spawn movie - random shots that suddenly appear in the middle of the film, disrupting the flow, just to show a cool shot.  In this case, it's the two Ghost Riders (modern and western) riding side-by-side to Ghost Riders in the Sky.  Fortunately, it's cool enough to watch that I forgave the director (Mark Steven Johnson).Cage handles most of the heavy lifting.  Next to cage, Mendez just can't keep up.  The rest of the crew are interesting, but it's the special effects that really make the film. Unlike the Hulk, the CGI effects are flawless.Overall, Ghost Rider was a lot more enjoyable than I expected. If you can get on board with the idea of a demonic biker of vengeance working as a bounty hunter for the devil, you won't be disappointed.",4,Ghost With the Most,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,3485,"['surface', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'cool', 'concept', 'mean', 'biker', 'flaming', 'skull', 'same', 'skull', 'lot', 'bikers', 'belt', 'buckles', 'How', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'thing', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'cool', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'fleshed', 'just', 'iconic', 'burning', 'skull', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'weird.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'modern', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'never', 'knew', 'how', 'wacky', 'background', 'really', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'Apocalypse', 'demons', 'hell', 'Surprisingly', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'movie', 'taps', 'weirdness', 'even', 'revel', 'it.Johnny', 'Blaze', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'deal', 'devil', 'Mephistopheles', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'original', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'exchange', 'saving', 'father', 'cancer', 'Blaze', 'soul', 'Mephisto', 'property', 'course', 'deal', 'sour', 'Blaze', 'discovers', 'interesting', 'quirk', 'contract', 'Blaze', 'soul', 'spoken', 'nigh', 'indestructible', 'trait', 'particularly', 'useful', 'Blaze', 'career', 'daredevil', 'Eventually', 'Mephisto', 'calling', 'debt', 'doozy', 'Mephisto', 'son', 'Blackheart', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'attempting', 'usurp', 'father', 'absorbing', 'thousand', 'souls', 'when', 'Blaze', 'actually', 'flames', 'skin', 'melts', 'walking', 'skeleton', 'known', 'Ghost', 'Rider.The', 'plot', 'reminiscent', 'Blade', 'bad', 'guy', 'rebelling', 'destiny', 'filled', 'grand', 'plan', 'basically', ""'ll"", 'do', 'everything', 'other', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', 'only', 'ten', 'thousand', 'times', 'bigger', 'Blackheart', 'case', 'town', 'sold', 'collective', 'souls', 'devil', 'contract', 'Blackheart', 'can', 'collect', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'help', 'take', 'world', 'MUAAHAHAHAHAH.Ahem', 'Anyway', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'Roxanne', 'Simpson', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'who', 'can', 'rock', 'dress', 'nobody', 'business', 'former', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Caretaker', 'Same', 'Elliott', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'window', 'dressing', 'really', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'strut', 'stuff', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'actually', 'demon', 'bound', 'Johnny', 'soul', 'why', 'quibble', 'CGI', 'marvel', 'chains', 'flames', 'demonic', 'motorcycle', 'physics', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'three', 'elemental', 'demons', 'Gressil', 'Wallow', 'Abigor', 'instead', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'actual', 'characters.What', 'interesting', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'film', 'leather-wearing', 'bike-riding', 'demon', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'complete', 'SWAT', 'teams', 'shootout', 'middle', 'city', 'Then', 'supernatural', 'battle', 'demon', 'family', 'interspersed', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'comedic', 'struggles', 'nightlife', 'Occasionally', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'thing', 'drove', 'crazy', 'Spawn', 'movie', 'random', 'shots', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'middle', 'film', 'disrupting', 'flow', 'just', 'show', 'cool', 'shot', 'case', 'two', 'Ghost', 'Riders', 'modern', 'western', 'riding', 'side-by-side', 'Ghost', 'Riders', 'Sky', 'Fortunately', 'cool', 'enough', 'watch', 'forgave', 'director', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', '.Cage', 'most', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'Next', 'cage', 'Mendez', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'rest', 'crew', 'are', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'Hulk', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'flawless.Overall', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'expected', 'can', 'get', 'board', 'idea', 'demonic', 'biker', 'vengeance', 'working', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'devil', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

1065684,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000OVLBEO,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[3, 4]","Superhero films are usually cool. Marvel's done pretty good - ""Spiderman"" dropped jaws, of course, and I thought even ""Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"" had some merits. ""Ghost Rider"" has some, too, but not quite enough to compensate for the rest of its limp-hanging nonsense.While I admit to not ever having read the comic and that this undoubtedly excludes the 'fan factor' that might influence my perception (and rating) of the movie, ""Ghost Rider"" simply isn't a very good film, from beginning to end.Two features of the film serve as its assets - the Ghost Rider graphics and action, and, to a lesser extent, Nicholas Cage in his Johnny Blaze persona: the silver screen embodiment of the skull-headed bounty hunter on his flaming bike is nifty, and Cage actually being convincing as a southern motorcycle stuntdevil. That's about it.The rest of the cast? - doesn't matter who plays the characters, for anybody's hardly given the screentime to grow on you.The storyline? - didn't I see it ten years ago in ""Spawn?""The acting? - Peter Fonda is Christensen-like atrocious as Mephistopoles (aka Mephisto, aka the devil).If you can get over those aspects, you should be alright. True to its source, the film plays out like a comic book - choppity-chop, from scene to scene, with bad placement of flashbacks here and there, in-between a convoluted story of love, sacrifice, and supernatural action (the last part will test your brain - why can Blaze suddenly turn into the Ghost Rider in the morning, in the nick of time, after it's been made clear that he can only transform at night?).Whether or not the film prides itself on being smart or dumb is the real questions - when not focusing on the story of hero-sacrificing-romance, it's all into contracts and soul-stealing and whether or not souls make you stronger... Eventually, I began to wonder whether the film was produced by two different directors, who operated in turns.In the end, I was just glad that it was over - ""Ghost Rider"" has a cool premise, and the least it deserved was to be a mindless, mildly-successfull blockbuster...all it is, though, is a mindless toiletbuster, that Nicholas Cage will probably come to regret performing in.",2,Underdone...Superhero Film?,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,2188,"['Superhero', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'cool', 'Marvel', 'done', 'pretty', 'good', 'Spiderman', 'dropped', 'jaws', 'course', 'thought', 'even', 'Hulk', 'Daredevil', 'had', 'merits', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'too', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'compensate', 'rest', 'limp-hanging', 'nonsense.While', 'admit', 'not', 'ever', 'having', 'read', 'comic', 'undoubtedly', ""'fan"", 'factor', 'might', 'influence', 'perception', 'rating', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'film', 'beginning', 'end.Two', 'features', 'film', 'serve', 'assets', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'graphics', 'action', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'persona', 'silver', 'screen', 'embodiment', 'skull-headed', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'flaming', 'bike', 'nifty', 'Cage', 'actually', 'being', 'convincing', 'southern', 'motorcycle', 'stuntdevil', 'it.The', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'characters', 'anybody', 'hardly', 'given', 'screentime', 'grow', 'you.The', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Spawn', 'acting', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Christensen-like', 'atrocious', 'Mephistopoles', 'aka', 'Mephisto', 'devil', 'can', 'get', 'aspects', 'should', 'be', 'alright', 'True', 'source', 'film', 'out', 'comic', 'book', 'choppity-chop', 'scene', 'scene', 'bad', 'placement', 'flashbacks', 'here', 'there', 'in-between', 'convoluted', 'story', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'supernatural', 'action', 'last', 'part', 'will', 'test', 'brain', 'why', 'can', 'Blaze', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'morning', 'nick', 'time', 'been', 'made', 'clear', 'can', 'only', 'transform', 'night', '.Whether', 'not', 'film', 'being', 'smart', 'dumb', 'real', 'questions', 'when', 'not', 'focusing', 'story', 'hero-sacrificing-romance', 'contracts', 'soul-stealing', 'not', 'souls', 'make', 'stronger', 'Eventually', 'began', 'wonder', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'two', 'different', 'directors', 'who', 'operated', 'turns.In', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'glad', 'was', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'cool', 'premise', 'least', 'deserved', 'was', 'be', 'mindless', 'mildly-successfull', 'blockbuster', 'though', 'mindless', 'toiletbuster', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'will', 'probably', 'come', 'regret', 'performing']",N/A

1065686,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000OVLBEO,Mike Zimmerman,"[6, 12]","After nearly losing his father Barton Blaze (Brian Cullen) to a bout of cancer, young Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) sold his soul to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to help erradicate it. However, Johnny's happy times came to an end when Barton was fatally injured during a motorcycle stunt show. To make matters worse, Johnny had to split from his girlfriend Roxanne (Raquel Alessi). Flash forward a few years later to an older Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage), who is an international stuntman sensation. His girlfriend (Eva Mendes) returns to his life, now a news reporter, as well as Mephistopheles, who offers to release Johnny's soul if Johnny becomes the fabled, fiery Ghost Rider, a supernatural agent of vengeance and justice. Mephistopheles charges Johnny with defeating the despicable Blackheart (Wes Bentley), Mephistopheles's nemesis and son, who plans to displace his father and create a new hell even more terrible than the old one.""Ghost Rider"" marks the return to comic book movies for director Mark Steven Johsnon, who helmed 2003's ""Daredevil"". Johnson had a hit with that film, which made Colin Farrell a must-watch star of that year, while sadly disrespecting Ben Affleck's thespian skills. Still, the director used the comic books as inspiration to the film and packed it with tight martial arts action that I dare anyone to dismiss.""Rider"" is a step back, however. It wants to be this cheesy fun action ride a la ""Blade"" II that has Nicolas Cage having the time of his life (it doesn't even hurt that, in real life, Cage is a comic book buff). Okay, pathos would be good, considering that this IS a movie based on a comic book. But Johnson seems to compromise things with a minimally developed love story, superhero movie cliches, a villain that would make ""Super Mario Bros."" villain Bowser look like the Green Goblin, and overwhelming religious tones (I'm a firm believer in God, don't get me wrong, but more on this later). It's a good movie, nevertheless, but not enjoyable enough to be a guilty pleasure or another worthy superhero movie to join the ranks of Spider-Man or Superman Returns.The movie starts out comfortably enough. Johnson gets the story going by detailing the past of how Johnny Blaze became the Ghost Rider, even if it doesn't stress the father-son relationship. As the movie kicks in to the present time, it really kicks in as Cage jumps a long line of cars to the tune of Ozzy Osbourne's ""Crazy Train"". Call me crazy, but it had me in goosebumps. It didn't hurt that supporting player Donal Logue offers some comic relief as Johnny's teammate and friend Mack. In scenes like this, Johnson feels comfortable enough to let these scenes play out, and it's pretty good.What sets this tone off balance is how dead serious the movie becomes later. Save for a couple humorous lines, Johnson once again relies on a heavy amount of religious undertones. While I'm not atheist, and did not read any ""Ghost Rider"" comic books, I felt that the scenes at the cemetary with Sam Elliott's caretaker character threw the movie's flamboyant fun factor off balance and eventually becoming a morose guilt trip than an adrenaline-fueled guilty pleasure. Of course, comic book movies can have pathos, but at least they should be, I don't know, fun.Then there is the cliches of this genre: hero with a chip on his shoulder, a love interest that needs to be rescued (this isn't something Johnson did in ""Daredevil"" when he had Jennifer Garner stand firm alongside - and often outact - Ben Affleck), a soundtrack that sledgehammers the fact to audiences that this is a movie about Hell (along with heavy metal guitar riffs), and an over-the-top villain (haven't we learned anything after Alfred Molina's jokey, but poignant line readings as Dr. Octopus in ""Spider-Man 2""?). Johnson does have fun with a few of these cliches, but the other parts are stale and don't have much effect on audiences.At least we've got Nic Cage, right? A fan of Ghost Rider in real life, the actor relishes the universe he is in. While at times he delivers his lines in a monotone voice, and has some awfully cheesy facial expressions (watch as he holds a gun before battling Blackheart), Cage walks the fine line between a good time and seriousness. It's when he turns into the Ghost Rider that he delivers the worst puns since ""Batman & Robin"". Nevertheless, it's not as bad as people say.I just wished the rest of the cast was on the same page. Curiously, Johnson has Eva Mendes dressed very sexy with her chest almost exposed, meaning that despite an awful performance, she'll at least turn a few heads with her sexy body. The truth of the matter is Mendes is NOT Jessica Simpson. Co-starring in some riotously funny comedies (""All About the Benjamins"", ""Hitch"", and ""Stuck on You""), Mendes should put away cynical doubts that she'll be wasted in a cast lead by powerhouse Cage, and deliver the same charming performance that she always does. Sadly, her performance here is the opposite. It's not anywhere near Katie Holmes cringe-worthy cuteness in ""Batman Begins"", but the potential is not taken advantage of.The rest of the cast is underused, especially Wes Bentley, who is about as threatening as a Nintendo baddie instead of the spawn of Satan. And other respectable talent like Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott look like they don't know where they are.Rider is not what I call a bad film. But it seems like Johnson is on auto-pilot here, relying on large amounts of CGI to mask up the wafer-thin plot and performances. At least in ""The Punisher"" they didn't use special effects at all, even if the movie was a bit of a drag. When Nicolas Cage delivers the single good performance, and Eva Mendes and ""flat performance"" are in one sentence, you know something is wrong. What could've been a grand-ol' time at the movies becomes a a guilt trip. Let's hope all involve come out of this with their respectable dignities.",2,"""I'm the only one who can walk in both worlds.

The only thing I knew was that he looked pretty cool and I liked his chopper.Johnny Blaze, (Cage), sells his soul to the devil in return for his father's health. Satan being Satan interprets the deal extremely literally and does what he does best: shafts Blaze, (both of them). Johnny becomes a famous stunt rider and has to answer the call to become the Devil's Ghostrider, a sort of contract-bound bounty hunter.The premise is very good and the whole anti-hero thing works well, although unlike the ""Spiderman"" movies, the whole characterisation was not explored so deeply in this movie. The story itself is relatively predictable, which also detracts a little from the movie itself. It can be hoped that these will develop in later installments, (if they are forthcoming), as they did with ""Spiderman"". This would make Ghostrider a very cool superhero.The special effects are excellent, as one would expect from such a movie, and they alone make the movie worth seeing. The special features of this package of the DVD are also in depth and relatively interesting. I particularly liked the history documentary about the comic books, which was a nice filler for one who has never heard of them before.Overall, this is pretty good package and one that I would recommend with some reservations.

""Why is this character so popular"" ?The end result ?Bad box office returns and the quick kill of a franchise before it can get started.Ghost Rider STARTED right on track, but once Cage entered and started his one-liner ""Comedy Central"" cracks and quirky sarcasm, the movie eroded quickly.Then try and forget the inconsistencies in story logic or even why an evil spawn with the power of Satan himself is affected by shotgun bullets, etc...The writers seemed to confuse Ghost Rider with the Hulk also........... Ghost Rider (original comic series) was articulate and spoke like a demon with long sermon like preachings when inflicting his wrath............. this movie version of Ghost Rider grunts and utters Hulk-like sentences like........

I have never seen the comic book Ghost Rider so I have no basis to compare, but I thought this movie was okay as an action movie by itself.  It moved at a good pace and the special effects were nice.  Nicholas Cage played a very low keyed hero who didn't want anyone messing with the Carpenters.  There were nice touches.  Sam Elliot was...well, he was Sam Elliot, how could you not like him?  Peter Fonda was pretty good and I'm not a Peter Fonda fan at all.  Eva Mendes as his ex-girlfriend had potential, but to be honest I just don't think she's a very good actress.  She was weak in this film and annoying in ""Hitch"".  Those are the only two films I can think of to form an opinion.  Also, I know it's a comic book adaptation but for goodness sake, can't she find a blouse that fits?  You know, one that can actually button all the way up?  Anyway, this is a film you can enjoy if you don't want a lot of depth (sounds like me), you like motorcycles, (Like I do), and if you're just looking for some action that keeps moving (like me).  Wow, this sounds like the perfect movie for me.  I wonder why it didn't get 5 stars.  Here's some reasons:  1. Eva Mendes.  2. Lack of suspense. 3. A reason to be going through all this. 4.

Avid comic fan Nicolas Cage plays Johnny Blaze, a stunt biker who years before had struck a deal with the devil Mephisto (Peter Fonda) to save the life of his cancer stricken father, and all he had to give up was his soul.  Naturally, no one ever gets away from making a deal with the devil, and Blaze pays the price for his deal when Mephisto's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) comes with apocalyptic intentions.  Chances are, you already know the rest of the story from this point forward, so I won't waste anymore time in that department.  What makes Ghost Rider enjoyable is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and Cage is enjoyably goofy (if slightly annoying) as Johnny Blaze (who personally I always thought was a role tailor made for Kurt Russell, but hey, what do I know?).  Sam Elliot is on board as well as the Caretaker, who is pitch perfect casting, with the only weak points being the overacting Bentley as Blackheart, and Eva Mendes as Blaze's love interest Roxanne.  Mark Steven Johnson, who brought Daredevil to the screen in 2003, fares much better with the material here, and the rampant CGI effects are mostly well done to boot.

I waited for this movie to get made for years- through all the delays. Now that it has been made I am not disappointed. I thought that this was a very good job of writing, acting, casting, and special effects.The first thing you have to realize is that this is a morality play. The Rider is the Spirit of Vengeance. He instantly knows the guilty from the innocent. His greatest weapon is his ability to make criminals feel their victims pain through his ""penance stare."" He is supposed to be disturbing, upsetting, frightening. If you have a problem with paying for your crimes then you are going to have a problem with the Rider...I especially liked the tribute to the original western Ghost Rider (excellently played by Sam Elliot) and his tie in to the mythos of the Johnny Blaze incarnation. It was so appropriate to use the old ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" theme here for it was the original inspiration for the character.I wouldn't hesitate to allow children to watch this, but I would watch with them and explain it. Blaze made a deal with the devil, but he did it for unselfish, sacrificial reasons. And while the devil got his soul, he didn't get his spirit. The Ghost Rider is darkness in the service of light. He willed himself from the devil's bounty hunter to his greatest nemesis on earth. He owned his curse and turned the devil's power against him.

Let's start with the writer and director, Mark Steven Johnson. He also made Daredevil which is surprising because that was actually a good movie if you saw the director's cut version. But no amount of reediting can save Ghost Rider.Nicolas Cage is responsible for creating a character that is part Elvis part idiot. Johnny Blaze starts out the movie being played by Matt Long. And that was actually the best part of the movie because he was going a great job with the character. Once you bring in Nicolas Cage, it all falls apart. This guy takes cheesy dialog and finds ways of making it ten times worse. And he can't pull off that wig he's wearing either. I will give him credit for getting his body in shape though. I'm sure he worked in his contract where he gets to appear shirtless. But that was also one of the most painful scenes in the movie as Cage is making goofy faces at his mirror.Oh, and we're supposed to believe that Matt Long grows up to be Nicolas Cage? That's an insult to Matt Long who...isn't ugly.Now on to Wes Bently who played Blackheart. This guy couldn't act to save his life. Bently can sleep at night knowing he played the lamest villain ever in a super hero movie. And I'm counting Sharon Stone who played Brick Girl in Catwoman. There was only one way Ghost Rider could defeat this guy...and he LETS him!So Ghost Rider is a super hero movie, right? An action movie? Where was the action? I'll spoil the movie right now. Ghost Rider defeats his enemies by saying ""Look into my eyes"" and then they burn up. That's it. He looks at them. Wow! Cool huh? There are a group of bad guys he has to defeat. None are any challenge AT ALL to him! All he does is look at them! Oh..and one time he twirled his chain.The special effects were, at times, pretty cool.

But I think one could assume that this was a good comic/movie rendering, a simple plot without being old and recycled. The Mephistopheles character seeks out and tricks the hero, a daredevil motorcyclist from the carnival named Johnny Blaze, and he is subsequently sent to fight against other rival ""baddies"" of the underworld in the service of the Bug Guy. So in a sense he becomes the devil's slave even in a fight against evil.The effects are great. The transformation of the motor-cycle and the hero's head into a burning skull are very convincing. Also noteworthy is the effect whereby he can use his power to cause a human-being to come face to face with all the evil things he has done in his life. The action is somewhat over the top, but mostly in the zone for a super-natural thriller. Johnny is invincible when he is the Ghost Rider, of course, and fighting against virtually indestructible foes will cause major damage to the landscape.Casting was superb. Cage was a great pick for the Johnny Blaze, the understated soft-spoken daredevil. The love story aspect is a little flat, hence the 4-stars. Although both women playing Johnny's girl-friend are picture-perfect as ideal comic book babes, Eva Mendes isn't given much in the way of a script which is the main reason her character loses in the depth department. So it's no Spiderman II story-wise. Sam Elliot is tremendously fun to watch if you like him because he is basically playing Sam Elliot; he's pretty much reprising his last 6 or so tough guy cowboy roles, which he always does masterfully.",4,Worth Seeing for Comic Fans,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,1610,"['clarify', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'exact', 'comic', 'think', 'one', 'could', 'assume', 'was', 'good', 'comic/movie', 'rendering', 'simple', 'plot', 'being', 'old', 'recycled', 'Mephistopheles', 'character', 'out', 'tricks', 'hero', 'daredevil', 'motorcyclist', 'carnival', 'named', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'subsequently', 'sent', 'fight', 'other', 'rival', 'baddies', 'underworld', 'service', 'Bug', 'Guy', 'So', 'sense', 'devil', 'slave', 'even', 'fight', 'evil.The', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'transformation', 'motor-cycle', 'hero', 'head', 'burning', 'skull', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'effect', 'can', 'use', 'power', 'cause', 'human-being', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'evil', 'things', 'done', 'life', 'action', 'somewhat', 'top', 'mostly', 'zone', 'super-natural', 'thriller', 'Johnny', 'invincible', 'when', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'course', 'fighting', 'virtually', 'indestructible', 'foes', 'will', 'cause', 'major', 'damage', 'landscape.Casting', 'was', 'superb', 'Cage', 'was', 'great', 'pick', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'understated', 'soft-spoken', 'daredevil', 'love', 'story', 'aspect', 'little', 'flat', 'hence', '4-stars', 'women', 'playing', 'Johnny', 'girl-friend', 'are', 'picture-perfect', 'ideal', 'comic', 'book', 'babes', 'Eva', 'Mendes', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'way', 'script', 'main', 'reason', 'character', 'depth', 'department', 'Spiderman', 'II', 'story-wise', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'tremendously', 'fun', 'watch', 'like', 'basically', 'playing', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'pretty', 'much', 'reprising', 'last', '6', 'so', 'tough', 'guy', 'cowboy', 'roles', 'always', 'masterfully']",N/A

The whole concept behind the film is that the Devil needs someone to go trace down his son and send him back to hell.  It seems like a waste to spend an entire movie on a run away child plot.  That is not to mention that the film's concept of the Devil is so far removed from the biblical concept of the Devil that one is left wondering why the filmmakers did not give the guy a different name.  The plot doesn't get interesting until the end when it is declared that the Ghost Rider is going to use his power for good, but by then the movie is over.  Viewers are left with some loose ends, such as why the old man bothered to ride with the new Ghost Rider, since he really did nothing once he got there.

I have to commend the advertising team, though, because they really sold me on the movie, and I went to see it despite the horrid reviews.The movie ended up making $$$M in the US alone (according to Yahoo! Movies), so I'm obviously not the only person who went into the theatre expecting the movie to live up to its previews.The movie started of strong; gripping opening credits and score. From there on out, it went straight to average. And I mean AVERAGE. It's almost as though they made an extraordinary effort to make sure that this movie would be as un-memorable as possible. Every time there's a scene that excites you about what's to come (the arrival of the three elemental bad guys was quite sweet), there's a reciprocating let down (I won't give away what happens, but let's just say that their encounters with Ghost Rider were less than impressive).But there's great special effects, right? Hhhmmmm, yes and no. What was in the previews was pretty awesome, and all that stuff is in the movie, but most of the CGI looks half done, as though they ran out money half-way through post production.I don't think anyone was really expecting a great plot, and I certainly wasn't, so the predictability of the film isn't one of my complaints, but the dialogue did suffer from a certain amount of cliche-itis.So the bottom line: For what it is, it's not bad.

Much like the character in the film, Nicholas Cage seems dead in his performance.  Though he's nowhere near as bad as Evan Mendes, who barely acted her way out of the Will Smith romcom, Hitch. There is one good actor in this movie - Sam Elliot.  But he's a born cowboy, and his character isn't too far from that role.This film celebrates the cliche ridden dialogue of built in blockbusters.  It also has some scenes that scream ""bad blockbuster!,"" notably a scene where Eva Mendes' character is chased down by Johnny Blaze to ask for a date.  It's silly, and looks more like it belongs in the aforementioned Hitch, then this movie.The film actually does a credible job of building the tragic hero out of Johnny Blaze, but I think part of it has to do with Nicholas Cage's natural persona.  The Ghost Rider character seems silly instead of terrifying, and some of the other characters' reactions to Ghost Rider are questionable.  And while the overall special effects of Ghost rider look good, he just doesn't translate well the big screen.But the film overall seems like a throwback to some of these bad excessive blockbusters.  But it's got a comic book sensibility that's been lost in comic book films - the cheesy dialogue, unbelievable action sequences, and well enough room for a continuation.

1065724,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000OVLBEO,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Ghost Rider(released Feb/07) is yet another comic book incarnation of a character brought to the big screen.This one stars Peter Fonda,Nicholas Cage and Sam Elliot,and the results are a mixed bag.The plot and back story can be a little too stop and go for my tastes,while the movie itself only comes to life when the action starts in and the S/FX range free.The movie opens as Sam Elliot narrates the legend of the Ghost Rider.It seems one Carter Slade(Elliot),once a cowboy now doing the Devil's bidding(Fonda),was under orders to retrieve and deliver a contract which contained about 1000 souls.Slade,figuring this was too much power even for the Devil himself,fled with the contract and hid it.Fast forward a hundred or so years and a young 17 year old Johnny Blaze is in a motorcycle show with his dad.However when he finds out his dad is dying of cancer,the Devil steps in to offer a cure for his dad,in exchange for Johnny's soul.Tricked,Johnny inadvertently signs the pact and his father is cured.However the following day just as Johnny is about to elope with his girlfriend his father is killed during his show.The Devil reappears telling Johnny to forget his life as he knows it and that he now owns him,and will return for him when he so wishes.Fast forward once more and Johnny is now an older professional motorcycle thrill rider,doing the most spectacular stunts the world has ever seen.He has a team of workers that travel the country with his show,but he has been alone since his dad's demise and remains a solitary figure.Johnny continues not only to push his limits but looks for a sign that one day may turn his life around for the better.That sign comes one day in the form of the girl he stood up the day his father died.She is now a reporter who asks and gets an interview with the reclusive motorcyclist.From this time on his attitude starts to change but as things would have it the Devil comes a-calling,and he is in need of his property.It seems the Devil's own son is bent on finding the lost soul pact and kicking his father off the evil throne.The Devil recruits Johnny to stop him and enhances his abilities by turning him into a Ghost Rider,replete with jacked up bike and leather accessories,all to go with the flaming skull Johnny sports whenever evil is present.In a lonely cemetery after his first nights ride,he meets the caretaker there.He seems to know more about Johnny and his alter ego than he should.Several nights pass and Johnny encounters the Devil's son and his minions.One by one he slowly takes them out.One day the caretaker reveals that he is THE Carter Slade and he gives Johnny the pact the Devil is searching for.Together they ride to the original town where the souls were collected.Slade leaves Johnny,telling him to keep to the shadows,as he disappears.Johnny indeed confronts the Devil's son,known as Blackheart and after obtaining the pact,unleashes the 1000 souls which pour relentlessly into his body.What might have been an advantage for Blackheart turns out,in the end,to work in Johnny's favour.Johnny had a Pennance Stare with which he neutralized enemies previously.He tried it once on Blackheart previously to no avail,as he did not have a soul.Now filled with 1000 of them Johnny tries it again and it succeeds.Johnny is reunited with his love and the Devil reappears.He tells Johnny that there is no longer any need to keep his powers as he has fulfilled his contract with him.Johnny however decides to keep his powers,telling the Devil that anywhere there are injustices to be righted and innocent blood spilled,in his fathers name he will be there to right it.The Devil is beyond mad and disappears.Peter Fonda makes a good Devil here but I don't think it was quite good enough.He just didn't have that extra oomph,like Peter Stormare had in Constantine,playing the same part.Cage is,well Cage,and does a good job in his role as J.Blaze.Sam Elliot does a very good job as Carter Slade and it is easy to see why he has played so many cowboys in films in recent years;he is just a natural at it.That easy going drawl goes down like a good swig of southern iced tea on a sweltering day!Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its' original a/r of 2:40:1.This is a two disc edition.The first contains some rare footage and numerous commentaries.The second disc contains three features on the making of the film,the animatics of the film and a featurette on 40 years of comic Ghost Rider.More than enough to satisfy your curiosity about the film and its roots.In conclusion an entertaining romp with a generally good cast and excellent special effects.It could have garnered more stars from me,but the movie only really gets going once the action starts and can be slightly slow going between times.3 1/2-4 stars.",3,Ghost Rider-The Devil's bounty hunter,1328140800,"02 2,

1065732,A2QAUMR0V33GC9,B000OVLBEO,"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic""","[8, 13]","Rating this film is hard.  On the one hand, I think the ""professional"" critics are usually way too hard on what are to be considered ""popcorn"" movies.  They expect that every film must have a ""deep"" meaning, ""classic"" actor, ""great"" director, or a ""serious"" plot/theme to be a good movie.  The rest are relegated to the garbage bin, particularly when they deal with what are usually considered ""juvenile"" means, like comic books.  Forget one of the best ""serious"" dramas in recent years, ""Road To Peridition,"" was based on a graphic novel.  Also forget critic favorite Robert Rodriguez did something truly special with ""Sin City,"" another comics-based film.  The truth is that ""real"" critics will always tend to look down their collective snout on anything pop-cultured related, forgetting that the first criterium for fiction films is the ability to entertain.On the other hand, when one has seen many action and comic-based films, we do have an expectation for new things.  A different view of what we've seen before.  ""Die Hard"" will always be a classic ""popcorn"" actioner because it really opened the door for over-the-top theatrics where you didn't expect to see them, or hadn't seen them before (namely in the confines of a skyscraper office building).  If you've seen it before, many many times before, you can get bored if there isn't a new twist on the theme.Which brings us to ""Ghost Rider"" itself.  Mark Steven Johnson did what I thought to be a bang-up job on ""Daredevil,"" only to get slammed by everyone.  Which was why I was so looking forward to this.  The character is a ""B"" level one from Marvel canon, but what the heck, ""Blade"" was too, and look how they ""cooled"" HIM up.  And, for all the changes Johnson made on the character's background, he still is the Ghost Rider.  CGI now makes it possible to make a truly believable Ghost Rider image work, and work it does!  The antagonists, Peter Fonda's Metasopheles and (I can't remember the actor's name, sadly) Blackheart, are truly first rate, right down to Blackheart's henchmen.But, and for all this, it's still very...mediocre.  Nicholas Cage does an adiquate job with John Blaze.  However, we've seen better from him in a lot of movies.  I guess it's kind of hard for a name actor to play second fiddle to a special effect.  I really get no feeling of chemistry from him and Eva Mendes, which is a shame because she is VERY attractive and good at playing tough, yet vulnerable.  I like Sam Eliot, and he plays a very valuable role in the film (performing to his high expectations, as always).  And yet, and yet.....""Ghost Rider"" does what it sets out to do.

His powers aren't really interesting as he only has his chain and bike and his eye stare. But later he has a shotgun.

Ghost Rider doesn't feel the pain or can get injured too bad, but as Johnny he could die from some injuries. So, he is all beat up in the day and is healing mostly from the fights during this time.That's all I really liked about the movie.

There are good actions sequences and the special effects are well done but they aren't enough to keep the moving from slowing down in parts. As for the acting, Nicolas Cage is pretty wooden and Eva Mendes does little more than show off her cleavage.

The movie is continual frightening imagery and I would warn parents of pre-teens to have a look yourself beforehand. From one parent to another it is something to consider.Secondly, during the special features documentary there is a part where the costume designer describes how she made risky back-room deals in Thailand in order to procure rare sea creature skins for the costumes including shark and sting-ray. I found her giddy attitude about making these illegal and rather unnecessary purchases to be wildly inappropriate. Her Hollywood mentality puts her frighteningly out-of-touch with the criminal and immoral world of animal trade. She acted like a teenager who'd stolen a pair of flip-flops from Wal-Mart instead of an adult who enabled the slaughter of animals for their skin, especially when you consider that no one would've known or cared what the costumes were made of outside of her small cadre of colleagues and that avoiding animal skin by using other materials would've been easy and more cost-effective.

The effects are fun and the story moves along at a nice pace, but the acting is rather pedestrian although I always enjoy seeing Eva Mendez, who seems to have a lot of trouble buttoning her shirts in any film she's in, and Nick Cage who gives us another of his quirky, ""I know this is stupid stuff but I'm having fun"", performances.  It's also nice to see Peter Fonda (Easy Rider) who is nicely sinister here and Sam Elliot (The LegacyandHulk) who is always good to see.  Sam has always had a great narrative voice and his world-weary voice and appearance works very well in this particular film. Some may remember him from the days when he and Tom Selleck,Magnum, P.I., co-stared in a number of memorable TV-Westerns (Louis L'Amour's The Sacketts) together back in the 80's.Although no one does any memorable acting here, they do pull off this lightweight entertainment effectively enough.  Relative newcomer Raquel Alessi who plays Eva Mendez's character in her youth is innocently charming and believable.  Expect to see more of her in the future.Just as the acting is nothing special in this film, I also found that this film doesn't really have any great memorable moments that stand out.

After about 10 minutes, I looked at my son and asked him if he thought it was stupid and completely unlike the first one.  He agreed.  The Ghost Rider transformation was inconsistent with the first movie.  The performances were lame and out of character.  But most of all, the 3D effects....sucked.  There were only 2 moments in the movie that the 3D caught my attention, and one of them was near the end when some ashes fluttered down.  My son and I agreed that we had wasted 90 minutes of our life, but we watched the included documentary nonetheless, trying to justify some of the cost of the disc.  The director explained how filming in 3D is too expensive, but due to the magic of computers, you can film in 2D, convert it in post, and have equally stunning effects.

Other than that this movie was a snorefest.  First off, Nicolas Cage is so ugly and dopey looking, aside from some parts where he was suppose to be dopey he came off really bad and just the wrong person for the role.  Satan is a loser who seem to give powers to people yet is too weak to stop them once they decide to run off with them.  So he throws hissy fits and walk around like he's actually doing something.  Satan's son is an even bigger loser than his father. Seriously, who gives a &$%@# if they are having a family quarrel over some scroll?  They ever really set up how important it is to the story.  Not to mention that neither Satan's son nor the other demon punk band members who were hanging with him were any kind of a real threat.  He just defeated them all so easily.  Then we have the love interest.  But why is she a love interest?  She pines over a guy who ditches her then stands her up.  What reason does she have to form any kind of attachment to this wet noodle, dopey looking man.Anyone want to know what Ghost Rider is all about, here it is;  Boy sells his soul accidently to the devil cause he finds out his father has cancer, the cancer is cured then his father dies in a firey accident.  Boy pouts and ditches his girlfriend as he rides off to become a dopey looking man who does stunts like his father, Satan's son and the brat pack gang show up and decide they want some scroll Satan was too slow to get from a old guy on horseback.  Since Satan is too much of a loser to put his retard son in his place he turns dopey man into a Ghost rider, suddenly dopey guy is satisfied with being turned into a skeleton with fire shooting out of its head (although that skeleton look WAY better than dopey looking Nicolas Cage, I was actually disappointed when he kept going back to his regular self), the police and everyone he comes in contact with seem to think it's normal to chase around a skeleton that's on fire.  Anyway, dopey man seeks help from the old man on horseback who took the scroll. For some reason, although he's been guarding it for years he has no problems handing it over to dopey man.  Then the producers add in a scene of the motorcyle Ghost rider and the horseback Ghost rider riding side-by-side, old and new, past and present....then horseback Ghost rider leaves cause the scene was over.  Seriously, horseback rider's departing words might as well had been; ""That was a cool shot, now I should go back to my trailer.""So stupid Satan's son, who is so happy Ghost rider's soul repentance couldn't work on him because he has no soul, decides that he's going to get thousands of souls put into his body.  Because it's so smart to put a bunch of souls into your body to fight a guy who can burn souls.

1065761,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000OVLBEO,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 4]","I'll be honest. I had never even heard of the character ""Ghost Rider"" until I read about the film being made. I will be unable to tell you how closely this film follows the story of this character, as set forth by Marvel Comics. I can tell you whether the film works or not.It does and it doesn't. There are a number of interesting ideas and themes in ""Ghost Rider"", but there are an equal number of things that don't work. Ultimately, it is a wash.Young Johnny Blaze learns his father, a stunt motorcyclist who is teaching him the tricks of the trade, has cancer and a strange man (Peter Fonda) appears offering to save the young man's dad. All Mephistopheles wants in return is Blaze's soul. Blaze doesn't quite believe the man, but signs anyway. Dad does get better, but events happen and Blaze rides off into the sunset, leaving his girlfriend, Roxanne behind. Years later, the adult Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) travels around the country completing one stunt more elaborate than the next, becoming famous in the process. Eventually, Mephistopheles comes to collect on the contract. If Blaze can banish Blackheart (Wes Bentley, ""American Beauty"") to hell, the devil will tear up the contract and Johnny can have his soul back. Roxanne (Eva Mendes) returns to town, a television reporter working her way through the ranks. Unwilling to help the devil, Johnny finds he transforms, at night and in the presence of evil, into Ghost Rider, a motorcycle riding skeleton engulfed in flame who rides a motorcycle covered in fire. Eventually, Blackheart realizes he has a formidable foe in Ghost Rider and decides to use Roxanne as bait.The film begins with a voice over by Sam Elliot, recounting an old legend about a small village in Mexico the devil wanted to claim. He sent his bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider, a cowboy on a horse, to claim the contract for their souls, but the Ghost Rider realized how powerful this document was and never turned it over. Sam Elliot's gravely voice does two things immediately; it telegraphs that this film will be more of a fable, maybe even a tall tale (remember his voice over during the Coen Brothers' ""Big Lebowski""?) and it also points to a definite Western influence to the story. When the story moves to present day, much of it takes place in Dallas and many small influences of Texas and Southwest design pop up here and there. In this way, they are making Johnny Blaze and Ghost Rider a sort of modern day cowboy.These elements add a lot of interest to the story, taking it beyond a normal comic book superhero.There is a lot of humor throughout the story and much of this is presented in a tongue and cheek manner. This doesn't exactly work, because it makes Cage seem even more jokey and unbelievable than he already is. These films are much better when they take the characters and their action seriously. Yes, I realize we are talking about a man who becomes a motorcycle riding skeleton who battles the devil's son. But if the characters aren't taking the story seriously, how is the viewer supposed to do this? If the characters take the action seriously, the viewer will believe the story, no matter how outlandish. The ""Spider Man"" films are a prime example of this. At one point, both Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes say a little quip and then stare at the camera, punctuating the joke, much like a drummer backing up a stand-up comedian. In most superhero films, these quips are played serious and elicit more laughter because of this, because they are unexpected.Nicholas Cage has never been the most subtle actor. Given the opportunity, he frequently veers into overacting, chewing the scenery and mugging furiously for the camera. When he makes a quip, or steals a glance at the camera doing a virtual wink wink, the character becomes jokey. At one point, Cage stares at the heavens and starts screaming, as he transforms into Ghost Rider, grimacing, mugging furiously for the camera, reminding us that we are watching a comic book character.In many ways, this film reminded me of the old ""Doc Savage"" film starring Ron Ely and the more I think about, the more the two films resemble each other. While ""Ghost Rider"" is nowhere near as bad as ""Doc Savage"", the two films are played for laughs, with the lead actors doing some serious scenery chewing. Both films have a pervasive wink wink nudge nudge feel about them. But Cage is a better actor and helps the character retain any seriousness, any gravitas he may have. It isn't much, but it helps make this film a little better.Eva Mendes plays Roxanne, Blaze's long unrequited love. When she returns as an adult and has a chance meeting with the new Stunt show star, she finds he hasn't changed much. At one point, Blaze confides in her and tells her what is going on. She is barely able to conceal her smirk and clearly doesn't believe him. Her character ultimately serves little purpose other than to be the damsel in distress.Peter Fonda plays Mephistopheles and does an interesting job of bringing the devil to life. For much of the film, he is quiet, using his words to provide the threats, speaking in soft tones. But during the moments when he is trying to be really scary, his voice changes little, making the performance more flat than scary.Wes Bentley returns to the big screen playing Blackheart, the devil's son, who wants to take over dear old dad's territory. After he made a splash in ""American Beauty"", he made a couple of films including the poorly received ""The Four Feathers"" and then dropped from the radar for a while. He has since made some films, none of which I have ever heard of, so this could be considered his big screen return, his first high profile film in a while. His role is interesting, but it almost seems to be done in shorthand; we certainly get the sense he is menacing, but really don't understand why he wants to take over for dear old Dad. Why is there so much hatred between them? I understand we are talking about the Devil and his son, but the Devil seems genuinely perplexed by his son's attitude. When he learns of Ghost Rider, he has to get rid of his new foe and they battle in spectacular fashion.Another thing that helps many `super hero' films become memorable is that we actually believe the actors are playing real characters. How do they achieve this? We actually see their faces, believe they are in danger. In ""Ghost Rider"", many of the scenes are created largely, maybe completely, with CGI (computer generated animation). While this helps the filmmakers create scenes they would never be able to do normally, it also provides a disconnect with the audience. Because we are basically watching cartoons, because we are watching an animated Ghost Rider ride up the side of a building on his motorcycle of fire, we lose the connection with the actors and the story. The ""Spiderman"" films have a similar problem; when Spiderman swings through the air on his web, we realize this is accomplished through CGI and begin to disconnect, but these sequences are brief and the animated Spiderman is very close in appearance to Tobey Maguire in the live action scenes, so we feel more of a bond to his character.""Ghost Rider"" is written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, who was behind ""Daredevil"", which I really liked, and ""Elektra"", which I never saw. He seems to be making a career of bringing comic book heroes to the big screen. In ""Ghost Rider"", he makes the material jokier and less believable, more like a Saturday afternoon serial. Perhaps that was the feeling he was going for, but it doesn't completely work.There are some elements, some ideas at work in ""Ghost Rider"", enough to warrant a DVD rental or low priced matinee. Beyond that, you should be a big fan of the material to pay full price. If you aren't, you will probably be disappointed.",3,"Ghost Rider - Good, but...",1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,7811,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'character', 'Ghost',

1065769,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000OVLBEO,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 6]","Nicholas Cage is Johnny Blade, stunt motorbike rider by profession. At night he turns `Ghost Rider' who has a burning skull, and rides a huge burning bike. Marvel's comic book character who signed a contract with the devil (played by Peter Fonda, nod to his ""Easy Rider"" role) comes with delightfully histrionic acting from wide-eyed Cage and corny one-liners and silly puns (including reference to `bonehead'). You may smile or just groan, but I loved the film for the silliness that I believe is intentional.I used the word `silliness' in a positive way. Obviously ""Ghost Rider"" is not trying to be `Spider-man"" and its sequel, another film franchise based on Marvel comic with which many people would compare this film. I like Sam Raimi's films, but if you feel they are getting a bit too serious these days, maybe -- just maybe -- you like this film. Nicholas Cage's over-the-top performance as likeable Johnny Blade in modern Western film mood is fun for me and he is clearly enjoying playing this role while some may say his is plain bad acting.I don't mean to say ""Ghost Rider"" is a great film. The film is mostly fun, but it rarely gets emotionally involving. The romantic part of the story is weak and the pace is sometimes rushed and most supports are unmemorable. Wes Bentley's Blackheart and his minions are not strong and menacing enough to generate the really thrilling battle scenes. Eva Mendes appears as Johnny Blade's love interest, TV reporter holding a microphone before the camera, but she is not required to do more than that.The film turned better than I expected and I actually enjoyed watching the film for what it is - exaggerated styles and acting with lots of special effects, thinking at the same time, however, a better writer and director would have made it more enjoyable.",3,"Not the Greatest Comic Book Adaptation, Not the Worst Either",1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,1804,"['Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Johnny', 'Blade', 'stunt', 'motorbike', 'rider', 'profession', 'night', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'who', 'burning', 'skull', 'huge', 'burning', 'bike', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'who', 'signed', 'contract', 'devil', 'played', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'nod', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'role', 'delightfully', 'histrionic', 'acting', 'wide-eyed', 'Cage', 'corny', 'one-liners', 'silly', 'puns', 'including', 'reference', 'bonehead', 'may', 'smile', 'just', 'groan', 'loved', 'film', 'silliness', 'believe', 'intentional.I', 'used', 'word', 'silliness', 'positive', 'way', 'Obviously', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'Spider-man', 'sequel', 'film', 'franchise', 'based', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'compare', 'film', 'like', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'films', 'feel', 'are', 'getting', 'bit', 'too', 'serious', 'days', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'film', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'likeable', 'Johnny', 'Blade', 'modern', 'Western', 'film', 'mood', 'fun', 'clearly', 'enjoying', 'playing', 'role', 'may', 'say', 'plain', 'bad', 'acting.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'mostly', 'fun', 'rarely', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'romantic', 'part', 'story', 'weak', 'pace', 'sometimes', 'rushed', 'most', 'supports', 'are', 'unmemorable', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Blackheart', 'minions', 'are', 'not', 'strong', 'menacing', 'enough', 'generate', 'really', 'thrilling', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Johnny', 'Blade', 'love', 'interest', 'TV', 'reporter', 'holding', 'microphone', 'camera', 'not', 'required', 'do', 'more', 'that.The', 'film', 'turned', 'better', 'expected', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'what', 'exaggerated', 'styles', 'acting', 'lots', 'special', 'effects', 'thinking', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'better', 'writer', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'enjoyable']",N/A
1065770,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000OVLBEO,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 7]","When I was younger I read some comic books, but I was never a fan of GHOST RIDER.  Sure the guy looked cool, but it didn't make any sense to me that a person could sell their soul to save a person they loved and then receive demonic powers that they would use to thwart the demon who had given the powers to them.  The idea still doesn't make any sense to me, but after having seen GHOST RIDER I have a better understanding about the character and his motivations.In the mythos that the film sets up, every generation has a Ghost Rider, a person who is given incredibly powers from the devil (well, not really, he's not Satan but is instead Mephistopheles) to use to do his dirty work in exchange for some great gift.  The film begins with the voice of The Caretaker (Sam Elliot) telling a story about a Ghost Rider from long ago who when it came time to pay the devil out ran the demon and made it to safety.  This opening segment seems quaint, but it actually ties into the story later on.  The story then fast forwards several years where we meet a younger Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) and his father Barton (Brett Cullen).  The Blazes are motorcycle stuntmen who mainly perform at a stationary carnival.  They are a good team and Barton loves his son.  However, Barton is dying of cancer and hides this from Johnny.  Johnny discovers the secret and finds himself torn.  He knows how much his father is sacrificing for him.  That's when a mysterious man arrives and offers to heal Johnny's father, but the price is his soul.  Before Johnny even realizes what has happened his blood has signed the deed and he finds himself the servant of a demon, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda).  Needless to say, the event changes Johnny's life.  He leaves behind the girl he was going to marry, Roxanne (Raquel Alessi) and sets out to make a new life.  Years later Mephistopheles' own son threatens to overthrow the demon and take his place as second-in-command of Hell.  So, Mephistopheles summons Johnny (now played by Nicholas Cage) away from his reunion with Roxanne (now played by Eva Mendes), transforms him into the Ghost Rider, and commands him to send his errant son and his friends back to Hell.The special effects in GHOST RIDER are pretty amazing.  The director, Martin Steven Johnson, and other filmmakers did an excellent job of creating the character of Ghost Rider.  The burning skull on wheels that's the devil's bounty hunter appears realistic.  I enjoy watching Sam Elliot in films and having him portray The Caretaker was an excellent idea.  Eva Mendes doesn't get to do much on screen other than look pretty, but she is one of the most attractive women in Hollywood (she has real curves) and makes any film more bearable to watch.  As for Nicholas Cage, he's not as good as Johnny Depp (the man originally slated for the title role), but Cage is a good actor and a huge fan of the comic book.  Despite having a hair piece that took three hours a day to set in play, he does justice to the character.  The film also does a good job at introducing people to the character of the audience.However, great actors and amazing special effects are not enough to make a movie like GHOST RIDER good.  The most important thing in any movie is to have a good story.  The general plot of GHOST RIDER is not a very good story.  It has a good introduction and opening sequence, but quickly moves downhill from there.  For instance, it's never made clear exactly why the contract Mephistopheles wants is so important.  The contract is supposed to contain untold evil that will bring a new Hell to Earth, but it's never made clear why--even when the characters explain what is happening, it makes no sense.Part of that might be because the story doesn't do a very good job of sticking to the rules of the universe it sets up.  For instance, The Caretaker tells Johnny that he should stay with him because demons can't stand on holy ground.  A few scenes we find Blackheart (Mephistopheles' son) and his demon buddies in a church harassing and torturing a priest.  In comic books inconsistencies like this happen quite often because there are different writers with different agendas each creating the same character.  This has gotten better in recent years as the comic book industry has attempted to create a better consistency to attract new readers without offending older ones, but it still happens.  In the comic book industry, such a thing is acceptable, but when it happens in a movie it's an example of shoddy writing and filmmaking.  Films based off a comic book can't be exactly like the works they are based on because they are two completely different mediums.In addition to the lack of an exciting story and poor writing, the character development is pretty bad.  The best comic book movies, such as the SPIDER MAN films or BATMAN BEGINS or even the original SUPERMAN don't just rely upon a good story, fine actors, and special effects.  They also do a thorough job of developing the central characters.  GHOST RIDER doesn't do that.  We get to know Johnny Blaze fairly well and The Caretaker, but that's about all.  Take Roxanne for instance.  We have no idea why she loves Johnny are why over a decade after he left her behind she still cares for him.  Eva Mendes is not only a beautiful actress, but she's also talented, but she isn't allowed to display her talents in GHOST RIDER.  Instead she just gets to play a cardboard damsel in distress.Overall, GHOST RIDER is just an average movie.  It has a lot of special effects, some great actors, and a great central character, but in the end it doesn't even ride high enough to travel into the sunset.  Fans of the Ghost Rider comic book might enjoy the film.  I'd also recommend seeing it if you are a fan of Sam Elliot, Nicholas Cage, or Eva Mendes, as well as someone looking to consume a piece of mindless eye candy with some action.",3,"""Look into my eyes

Ghost Rider is a, how do you say it, demon from hell! The studios stepped in, and along with Mark Steven Johnson butchered that notion. Notice that Goyer only gets a production credit.I used to believe that the reason this was delayed so long was because of the effects. That's a lie, it was delayed due to the fact they had to scrape the original vision and start from scratch.Johnny Blaze is a wuss who drinks jelly beans from a martini glass.

I'm tired of the EMO villians popping up in comic book films.The visual effects rocked, they nailed the penance stare...The biggest gripe, and I wonder why it hasn't been brought up was the ending that was pretty much frame by frame the original Blade ending.When the souls enter Blackheart looks just like when the souls. enter Deacon Frost.

I simply went to see Ghost Rider for the thrill and excitments. It did give all that, and I enjoyed very much for that reason, but the story and characters are not very interesting and the love plot between Nic and Eva Mendes is even more low-key. I just think she's so wasted in a boring character without much depth. I have a feeling that Nic's ghost rider character is performed by stunt doubles since we don't even see his real face. Those scenes with the ghost rider are the real money shots. Nic was good with what he had to work with, nothing challenging for a heavy weight Oscar winner like him. Out of surprise, I was quite delighted to see Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot in support. They were both pretty scene-stealing. Fonda was exceptionally more outstanding playing the devil. He doesn't look evil, but his expressions and performances are. I also thought Wes Bentley was good as the villian. I almost had the chance to meet him recently on an indie Hank and Mike, but he dropped out and got replaced by Chris Klein.

It is in the same vein as CONSTANTINE and HELLBOY that deals with supernatural fantasy. The movie incarnation of Ghost Rider, however, feels like a hybrid of the Johnny Blaze(who uses Hellfire as his primary weapon) in the 70's and Dan Ketch(magical chain/penance stare)in the  90's.John Blaze is a stunt motorcycle rider, who decades ago sold his soul to Mephisto(incarnation of Satan), to save his dad from cancer. As with anyone who deals with evil, the deal has a hidden catch, his dad dies in an accident anyway and Blaze finds out that he is unable to die until Mephisto decides it is his time. It makes Blaze a phenomenal stunt rider but it also makes him empty.Soon enough, Blackheart wants to de-throne Mephisto by seeking an ancient scroll with the names of the damned to grow an army. Mephisto enlists Blaze's aid by transforming him(against his will) into the ""Spirit of Vengeance"", Ghost Rider to stop Blackheart.Sam Elliot(steals the show) as the ""caretaker"" is a character from Ketch's 90's  incarnation, Eva Mendes as Roxanne, who plays Blaze's love interest.About the extended edition:Don't go for the slightly longer un-rated cut for hope of more violence. Pretty much everything that has been restored in this version of the movie is characterization bits, which is not a minus because it does flesh out the central players a little more, but it's doubtful that any of this material was cut at the request of the MPAA, rather, it was likely deleted for pacing reasons.The film's EFX is well-executed and follows a darker tone like DAREDEVIL and Underworld. Although I have to say this film mostly follows the 1970 incarnation with its cartoonish sly humor. The 1980-1990's version of GR had a more serious and darker mood.PICTURE: 2.40 ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN. The PQ is phenomenal, colors extremely vibrant.

Sound is very powerful.Extras:DISC 1:  Commentary by director M.S. Johnson w/ visual effects Steven Mack, another commentary by the producer is also here. Trailers are also here.DISC 2:Documentary called Spirit Of Vengeance: The Making Of Ghost Rider which clocks in at just under 82 minutes. The first two parts cover the origin of the film and its production while the third part details post production work.Up next is Sin And Salvation which is a really interesting look at the comic book history of the title character, one section a piece dedicated to 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000's by way of some interesting interviews with the various artists and writers who have worked on the different incarnations of the Marvel Comics that the film was based on.To close it out, Sony added some cool animatics and more supplements.GHOST RIDER is not as bad as people think. It is a fun ride, a decent (if brainless) action movie geared towards fans of the comic genre.

1065783,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000OVLBEO,Wuchak,"[38, 40]","I personally feel that the numerous superhero films that have been popping up since ""X-Men"" came out in 2000 are all of about the same quality. Yeah, everyone has their personal favorites (mine is ""Daredevil: The Director's Cut"") but, generally speaking, they're all decent cinematic versions of the comic heroes.Mark Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Rider"" (2007) combines Faust and Spider-Man and mixes in elements of all the variations of the Ghost Rider comics up to the present, including the 50's Western hero, but it's main inspiration is the 70s-80s comic featuring Johnny Blaze as the protagonist.What makes Ghost Rider appealing? Well, the only thing cooler than a guy in black leather and chains driving a Harley is a flaming skeleton in black leather and chains driving a supernatural flaming Harley. That pretty much explains it.THE PLOT: Johnny Blaze and his father make a living as Evel Knieval-like stunt riders in a carnival. When Johnny's dad is diagnosed with cancer he is mislead into making a deal with the devil. His father is healed of the cancer but Satan makes sure he dies in a stunt accident. Johnny ultimately discovers that, because of his foolish deal, he is cursed to become the nigh-invincible Ghost Rider -- a supernatural flaming skeleton -- whenever he comes face to face with evil. Satan then enlists him as his ""bounty hunter"" to capture his prodigal son, Blackheart, who naturally hates his father and is intent on getting the ""contract of San Vengaza"" for the purpose of starting some kind of hell on earth. Ultimately Johnny must make a decision about what to do with his powers -- give 'em back to Satan or use 'em to fight evil.Some criticize Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze because Blaze is supposed to be about 30 years old, while Cage was around 41 during filming. Yeah, someone like James Franco would have been better for the role, especially since Franco looks exactly like Mike Ploog's version of Blaze, but Cage does a fine, likable job. Besides, I know guys 25 years old that look older than Cage does in the film. In fact, you'll see that Cage is in incredible shape for a man in his early forties. As for Eva Mendes, who plays Johnny's girlfriend Roxanne, she's ten years younger than Cage and is both voluptuous and adequate in the role, not to mention highly likable.Some criticize the film as too serious, others as too goofy, but the fact is that ""Ghost Rider"" has the same general tone as all the other superhero flicks released since 2000. It's a serious story for the most part, although completely unbelievable due to the subject matter, with some humor thrown in for good measure. In other words, it's neither deathly serious nor a campy goof-fest; it rides the line between these two extremes.If all you want out of ""Ghost Rider"" is an entertaining supernatural superhero flick ""Ghost Rider"" delivers and is worth renting or owning for that purpose. But thankfully the film delivers on a deeper level as well. Allow me to throw out to you a smattering of the many noteworthy or fascinating aspects of the film:-- Note that Johnny is mislead into ""selling his soul"" to the devil and has to face the negative consequences of his decision. Few people will literally ""sell their soul"" to Satan as shown in the story but we can all relate to the struggle with the evil that exists within our own hearts. If or when we decide to live according to the inclinations of our lower, destructive, selfish nature are we not, in a sense, ""selling our soul"" to the devil? (regardless of whether we view the devil as a literal spiritual being or merely as a symbol of potential human evil). Whenever we choose to live according to this lower nature will we not automatically perform evil and, in that sense, fulfill the devil's will? (ditto).-- Peter Fonda as Satan is perfect and entertaining, as is Sam Elliott as the old Westerner.-- Love is a strong theme in the story. Johnny ""sells his soul"" for love of his father. He didn't do it for greed or some other carnal purpose. This is agape love, self-sacrificial love, love in it's highest and purest form. This puts Johnny on God's side (as Elliott's character observes in the film) and makes him a serious threat to the devil's purposes on earth.-- We also witness Blaze's great love for Roxanne and vice versa, as well as Mack's love for Johnny, etc.-- This is brilliantly contrasted by the total absence of love in Satan's kingdom. The devil hates his son and vice versa. This is a fitting depiction because God is described as love in the Bible; and since Satan has chosen to separate from God and be His enemy, he has naturally separated himself from love and become love's enemy. Hate in all its ugly manifestations is therefore the essence of the devil's kingdom and relationships.-- When Blaze first turns into the Ghost Rider and goes for a ride in his flame cycle he causes great havok wherever he goes. You'll note that this is much toned down in his later excursions as Ghost Rider. The explanation? Johnny simply didn't know how to control the supernatural hellfire and ""spirit of vengeance"" during his initial conversion.-- Although it's supposed to be amusing, it makes sense that Johnny would listen to The Carpenters in his down time. Blaze's daredevil lifestyle and his problems with the Ghost Rider curse would understandably cause him a great deal of stress. Listening to Karen's ultra-soothing voice would be a great pacifier.-- There's a great scene of Ghost Rider riding off the top of a skyscrapper, whipping his chain in exulting fury, and then riding full blast down the building smashing into the pavement below as police and onlookers observe in total disbelief.-- In the comics Blackheart was the only comic character that ever sent literal chills down my spine (in Ann Nocenti's Daredevil). I didn't get this feeling from Wes Bentley's portrayal in the film, although there's a hint of that. Regardless, Bentley does a fine job in the role. And Blackheart's total ugly wickedness is certainly revealed or demonstrated here and there.-- There's a great musical interlude featuring the Ghost Rider and the Caretaker (Elliott) riding through the night desert for hundreds of miles to San Vengaza. Fittingly, the song is a modern hard rock version of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" (I love that song! Who doesn't?)-- I saw the theatrical version when it first came out on DVD and recently purchased the director's cut, which adds approximately 10 minutes of extra footage for a total of about 2 hours runtime. Unlike ""Daredevil,"" where the director's cut transformed a mediocre flick into a great one, the extra footage for ""Ghost Rider"" doesn't make or break the story. In fact, I can't really tell what the extra footage is. It's mostly just extended dialogue, I guess. So, if you don't feel like shelling out the extra cash for the director's cut, you're not missing all that much, if anything the extra footage just slows the film down (but I prefer it).-- The picture was filmed in Victoria, Australia, and the city of Melbourne.-- The Ghost Rider himself (itself?) is a triumph of special effects. Needless to say, the film is enjoyable just to look at.-- On the extra features disk (director's cut only) there's a great 4-part documentary called ""Sin and Salvation"" on each of the comics incarnations of Ghost Rider up to the present, which runs approximately 45 minutes. It features such comics notables as Roy Thomas, Mike Ploog, J.M. DeMatteis, Howard Mackie and many more.If anything I've mentioned here trips your trigger be sure to check out ""Ghost Rider.""",4,"""You can't live in fear""",1198886400,"12 29,

1065784,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,B000OVLBEO,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[1, 2]","GHOST RIDER has some interesting ideas but ultimately fails in many aspects.  The plot simply is set up to go from ""Point A"" to ""Point B"" to move the story along with no twists to storyline or character development. Again, director Mark Steven Johnson creates another shallow relationship as he had done in his other comic book film adaption, DAREDEVIL (Matt Murdock & Elecktra). This time it is between characters Johnny Blaze & Roxanne Simpson (Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes respectively). The CGI effects of the title character are terrific and it actually doesn't overtake the film which might not be a good thing because somehow the moviegoer is wanting more action with the Ghost Rider. Nick Cage seems to be phoning in his performance and channeling in variations from his past action movies (i.e. THE ROCK, CON AIR, & NATIONAL TREASURE). Eva Mendes simply cannot act and is terribly miscast as Roxanne Simpson. One would guess that since her character is somewhat of a reporter that she is a variation of a 'Lois Lane' to the title character and it ultimately falls short...big time. In a bit of inspired casting, Peter Fonda is cast as Mephistopheles, the demon who gives the Ghost Rider his persona, powers (and demon motorcycle chopper). Also, another bit of inspired casting is of Sam Elliott as Carter Slade who is a Ghost Rider from the old west who rides a demon horse. The best part of the movie is when the modern day Ghost Rider and the old west Ghost Rider are side by side going through the desert at night.  The rest of the film is not interesting with the plot of Mephistopheles' demon son wanting to take over his Dad's reign of terror and the Ghost Rider must stop him. This is a tired and cliched plot. Overall, another failed comic book movie adaption with tired plot devices and an uninteresting relationship of the comicbook character and the would-be girlfriend.",2,Goin Down the Highway...Lookin for Adventure ..With a Flaming Skull!,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,1890,"['GHOST', 'RIDER', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'ultimately', 'many', 'aspects', 'plot', 'simply', 'set', 'up', 'go', 'Point', 'Point', 'B', 'move', 'story', 'twists', 'storyline', 'character', 'development', 'Again', 'director', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'shallow', 'relationship', 'had', 'done', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'adaption', 'DAREDEVIL', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'Elecktra', 'time', 'characters', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'Roxanne', 'Simpson', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'respectively', 'CGI', 'effects', 'title', 'character', 'are', 'terrific', 'actually', ""n't"", 'overtake', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'moviegoer', 'wanting', 'more', 'action', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'be', 'phoning', 'performance', 'channeling', 'variations', 'past', 'action', 'movies', 'i.e', 'ROCK', 'CON', 'AIR', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'terribly', 'miscast', 'Roxanne', 'Simpson', 'One', 'would', 'guess', 'character', 'somewhat', 'reporter', 'variation', ""'Lois"", 'Lane', 'title', 'character', 'ultimately', 'short', 'big', 'time', 'bit', 'inspired', 'casting', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'cast', 'Mephistopheles', 'demon', 'who', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'persona', 'powers', 'demon', 'motorcycle', 'chopper', 'Also', 'bit', 'inspired', 'casting', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Carter', 'Slade', 'who', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'old', 'west', 'who', 'demon', 'horse', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'modern', 'day', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'old', 'west', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'are', 'side', 'side', 'going', 'desert', 'night', 'rest', 'film', 'not', 'interesting', 'plot', 'Mephistopheles', 'demon', 'son', 'wanting', 'take', 'over', 'Dad', 'reign', 'terror', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'must', 'stop', 'tired', 'cliched', 'plot', 'Overall', 'failed', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'adaption', 'tired', 'plot', 'devices', 'uninteresting', 'relationship', 'comicbook', 'character', 'would-be', 'girlfriend']",N/A
