It attempts to capture what life in the studio is like for Pearl Jam, and I can only assume that they did a good job.  However, if you're expecting great insight into certain members of the bands personality look elsewhere.  The bulk of this film is the band practicing with a few interviews.  Naturally though the music is incredible and the sound quality is quite good.Great Job Pearl Jam!",4,The Theory Works,1031616000,"09 10, 2002",2002,431,"['was', 'truly', 'impressed', 'video', 'capture', 'what', 'life', 'studio', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'However', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'great', 'insight', 'certain', 'members', 'bands', 'personality', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'bulk', 'film', 'band', 'practicing', 'few', 'interviews', 'Naturally', 'music', 'incredible', 'sound', 'quality', 'quite', 'good.Great', 'Job', 'Pearl', 'Jam']",N/A

There's no videos or any talk of videos, what this film is however, is a glimpse into what the members of PJ think of the songs off of the Yield release. Yield is one of my favorite CDs by Pearl Jam so to hear each song at least partially performed is gratifying enough. Hearing each member talk about the songs is something that I like about this DVD, I also like the fact that it's not just Ed talking, if anything Mike, Stone, and Jeff get more camera time. To know there's no real power struggle going on is a good pick-me-up. The sound quality is as if you're simply listening to the CD and Ed nails every lyric. To hear every song off Yield played was good because most of my favorites aren't songs I've ever heard PJ play live. Take No Way for instance, they don't play this song very much at all so to hear even the part of it they do play is good enough for me. Same goes for Brain Of J. Two of the songs played best were All Those Yesterdays and Given To Fly but those songs are always played with such emotion that it's hard to screw them up. I really like the way the band describes Given To Fly, I feel it gives the song that much more meaning. In Hiding has an interesting backstory to it and is played in full much to my delight. In Hiding is one of those songs that doesn't really take off till the chorus, so I'm glad they did the song justice and played it in it's entirety.If you're expecting some stellar live footage, don't count on it, Pearl Jam is playing the songs in a studio. If you're expecting to hear some landmark songs that they've made over the years, don't count on it, Pearl Jam only plays the songs from Yield. If you're a fan of PJ then you're sure to see the beauty in this extremely minimal release. And if you like Yield, then you're bound to love it. I was surprised with what I was given with this DVD but by no means I disappointed.

PJ ducking exposure all these years and not much media coverage about them, it was a pleasant surprise when they annouced this video release along with their album, yield.  being that i was sorta tired of all the unofficial bootleg videos, i wanted something professionally shot, something with a clear view of the band.  and we got that and more.  this video gave us fans much insight into the recording of yield, jampacked with interviews from the 4 members and the beloved jack irons.why not five stars? well, if you are comparing it to other music dvds out there, then by far, this is a five-star product.  if you are comparing this to other pj dvds, then it falls a bit short.  this dvd contains no extras and runs less than an hour.",4,4.5 stars.  1st official video release,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,989,"['who', 'am', 'i', 'kidding', ""'re"", 'PJ', 'fan', 'already', 'have', 'album', ""'re"", 'not', 'what', 'say', 'review', 'aint', 'going', 'change', 'thing.for', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'well', 'i', 'was', 'just', 'rest', 'when', 'i', 'heard', 'release', 'outright', 'giddy', 'PJ', 'ducking', 'exposure', 'years', 'not', 'much', 'media', 'coverage', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'when', 'annouced', 'video', 'release', 'album', 'yield', 'being', 'i', 'was', 'sorta', 'tired', 'unofficial', 'bootleg', 'videos', 'i', 'wanted', 'something', 'professionally', 'shot', 'something', 'clear', 'view', 'band', 'got', 'more', 'video', 'gave', 'fans', 'much', 'insight', 'recording', 'yield', 'jampacked', 'interviews', '4', 'members', 'beloved', 'jack', 'irons.why', 'not', 'five', 'stars', 'well', 'are', 'comparing', 'other', 'music', 'there', 'then', 'far', 'five-star', 'product', 'are', 'comparing', 'other', 'pj', 'dvds', 'then', 'bit', 'short', 'dvd', 'extras', 'less', 'hour']",N/A

The members of the  band speak individually about the songs' inceptions, life in the studio,  life as a member of Pearl Jam, how things were and how they are.  It's like  getting to spend an hour or so just hanging out with the guys.I am a  musician, trying to get my own band started, and personally I found  watching this to be inspirational to my causes.  Everytime I watch it I get  this urge to jump up, go take out a loan so I can buy up some studio time  and just do it.Surprisingly, at no time does Vedder take center stage  here.  Equal time is spent focusing on all five of them.  My favorite  insights arfe those given by bassist Jeff Ament about the intensity of  playing music that you know is better than anything you've ever done  before, and about the psychological power of music.It's not the typical  let's-watch-the-band-get-drunk-backstage video.

The performance sections sound great, and nearly every song on the album is performed (at least in part).Yield is my favorite album so seeing the creative process behind it is very cool.  Input from each member is represented fairly equally, and you can see a kind of ""rebirth"" happening during the making of that album.Before ""Pearl Jam Twenty"" was released, this was really the only footage of its kind showing the creative process within the band, but for me this video has a uniquely intimate feel, as if you were in the studio with them rather than just seeing footage of the band recording.

Although only about 45 minutes long, it's a real eye-opener for the fan to see what all goes into making an album. This is ""behind the scenes"" of their 5th studio album (and one of their BEST), ""Yield"". This album is easily one of my personal favorites, so I really got a lot out of this. Very insightful, with band members discussing how the songs were created, their relationships with eachother, life in general, etc. It is over all real interesting, and a pleasure to see and hear the first attempts of favorite songs from the album. It also features Jack Irons as the drummer, who would be later replaced by Matt Cameron. I WISH they did a video like this for ALL of their albums- it's that GOOD! If you consider yourself a true fan, you will really enjoy this. But if you're just a casual fan and don't know all their songs and don't really care, this may not be for you. Also keep in mind it is NOT a concert video- it's merely a DOCUMENTARY of the making of ""Yield"". If you want a concert DVD, I HIGHLY suggest ""Touring Band 2000"" or ""Live At The Garden"". Both are extremely entertaining (see my reviews on them).

And in that everyday-ness we are surprised to find that they come off as everyday people, albeit immensely talented rage rockers at that, but we are brought into the ?ordinary? of an ?extraordinary? band.What's truly great in the interspersed nature of band interviews, improvs you don't hear on the record, versions of the songs in their early stages (also not on the record), and the pure love for music and creativity that comes across.  PJ's best drummer to date (and their has been a few) Jack Irons soaks his arm in a vat of ice as he recoups to once again spread rhythmic intricacies across the skins.  Eddie and Stone Gossard go back and forth about who does the e-bow in &quot;Wishlist&quot; and meanwhile we as viewers and fans have a window to the inception of songs.  It is truly an irreplaceable experience.This DVD shows the band at their peak.
