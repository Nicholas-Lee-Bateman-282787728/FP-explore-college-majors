I watched all episodes from Season 1 in a few day; this is a pretty good show.  The show has a pretty clever concept--a small time crook named Earl (Jason Lee) is almost killed after he wins $100,000 from an instant lottery ticket.  He believes that Karma is punishing him for all the bad things he's done.  Therefore, he makes a list of all the people he has wronged in his life and tries to make it up to them one-by-one (or one episode at a time).The show has great writing and a very good ensemble cast--highlighted by Jaime Pressly's dead-on performance as Earl's ex-wife.  What makes the show really great is that it doesn't make fun of it characters.  My Name is Earl could get many easy jokes out of the subject matter--lower class, uneducated rural folk--but instead it develops the characters.  And the actors play it straight--they never wink at the camera; therefore, they form well-founded characters and not just chariactures.The show features several recognizable faces in cameos including Dax Shepard, Giovanni Ribisi (hilarious in 2 episodes), Missi Pyle, Timothy Stack, Johnny Galecki, Beau Bridges, Jon Favreau, Adam Goldberg, Samm Levine, Christine Taylor, Malcolm David Kelley, Juliette Lewis, Clint Howard, Mike O'Malley, Max Perlich, and Lin Shaye.

999034,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B000G6BL88,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[3, 3]","I tend to be skeptical of all hype, whether about sports figures or commercial products or film reviews, but particularly about ""critically acclaimed"" TV series (comedies especially, since I am admittedly not an easy laugh).  Most of these so-called ""original"" and ""brilliant"" shows are almost invariably formulaic, predictable, unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting mediocrity that are predictably shilled by a largely conformist and toadying group of ""entertainment critics"" who often pander to the networks' program marketing and who themselves probably have never actually written a script, (and for the most part don't have a clue what is in fact good), but strive to maintain their credentials by raving about the ""right"" shows in a scarcely veiled act of symbiosis between the networks and the mainstream outlets where these critics/shills ply their dubious trade.  Far too often, something unique or original or unorthodox meets with disdain or indifference, while meritless offal is undeservedly touted.  But once in a while, there is a program that critics and audiences (not just the really stupid ones that watch ""reality"" shows) all can laud.  MY NAME IS EARL is one such show.I first saw this show inadvertently, on the big TV screens at the gym.  I started laughing out loud within just a few minutes.  This influenced me to watch more episodes, which in turn convinced the Mrs. and myself to buy the first season, which we missed in its original broadcast.  After having seen each episode of the first season, I don't think there is a bad or weak one in the whole series, although there are some that do stand out as favorites.For those few who might not be familiar with the show, it's about an inveterate ne'er-do-well named Earl Hickey (Jason Lee) who continues his life of petty theft and mayhem until one day winning a big prize from a scratch-off lotto ticket, which he loses moments later in a bizarre accident.  While in the hospital, Earl comes to the conclusion that his poor quality of life - in particular his painful loss of fortune - is a result of karmic forces aligned against him.  To regain some measure of good fortune, he begins a determined quest to live a better life and to try and right some of the wrongs he has done.  No sooner does he begin this quest than his winning ticket is miraculously returned to him by the providential wind, thereby providing the funds for his mission.The show's premise is both creative and interesting, in addition to being very well-written.  The stories are an imaginative foray into different subplots which cleverly ties the various elements together in an ending which is not only satisfying, but also adroit.The biggest pleasant surprise is the wonderful effectiveness of the cast.  I was not an especially big fan of Jason Lee (I don't like Kevin Smith films), but he is so good in the lead role (capturing the clumsy but earnest intentions and hamheaded determination of the character), that it is difficult to imagine anybody else being able to play that role with any comparable skill.  The other biggest surprise was Jaime Pressly, whose acting career has largely consisted of straight-to-video or late-night cable low budget B- movies.  Though she had been making the transition towards comedies, she excels in her role of Joy (Earl's ex-wife and occasional nemesis).  She has really hit the mark in terms of her comic timing, delivery, and expressions.  The rest of the main cast includes Ethan Suplee, a capable journeyman character actor with a surprisingly long and diverse resume' of roles, plays Earl's simple but mostly good-natured brother Randy; Eddie Steeples plays Darnell (aka Crabman), Joy's laid-back new husband (she divorced Earl while he was in traction in the hospital) who Earl still remains friends with; the scorching hot Nadine Velasquez (yummy!) plays Catalina, the paradoxically worldly yet naive (and highly sexy) maid who works at the rundown motel where Earl and Randy live.  Also, she's really attractive.  Add to this a wealth of talented and familiar guest appearances and you have the right crew for this remarkable vessel.The show works for a variety of reasons, and all factors not only work well but exceptionally so.  Of all the different types of entertainment viewing options (films and/or TV), comedies are usually first preference, although again I tend to be a tough audience.  In addition to the laugh-out-loud humor, it is very satisfying to see a show about someone trying to redeem himself and help others WITHOUT ALL THE SANCTIMONY AND SELF-ADULATION that other programs with less merit would purport to have.  It has become a staple of entertainment for our family, and countless others.  The only thing I enjoy more than watching the episodes are watching them with family and friends and seeing the enjoyment they also have in watching it.  There is no show (or anything for that matter) that everyone will like, but I am confident that this show will be received favorably by those looking for great humor, good writing, engaging stories, likable (if somewhat dysfunctional) characters, and a positive message.",5,Original and well-crafted series that is genuinely funny,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,5149,"['tend', 'be', 'skeptical',

999035,A1X93ES4DITTWK,B000G6BL88,Blueberry Muffin,"[9, 210]","I used to watch this show every week for two months until I got fed up with it. That's right; I got fed up, I didn't get bored. Earl is this redneck who wins some money and tries to make up for what he did wrong in the past to other people. Earl writes out a mile long list of all the things he's done and he won't rest until he's made up for it. So he actually comes across as being pushy and self-centered in order to get this accomplished instead of being just being humble, offering a simple apology, and moving on with his life. Anyway, Earl was married to this skank named Joy and they had a son together. They got divorced after their second son had came out- surprise! - Black. Joy had cheated on Earl with Darnell aka Crabman, a Black man who worked at some restaurant and it was his son. The kid was always running around unkempt with this lumpy, dry afro that had the potential of being a fire hazard. So Joy and Earl get a divorce and Joy ends up marrying Darnell. Even though Joy and Darnell are married, Earl, for some reason, feels he has the right to just barge into their home any time he wants and still sleep around with Joy. Don't let me get started on the episode when Joy's parents come over for Christmas and they didn't know she had married Darnell. That was the last straw for me. Basically, Darnell was disrespected and just treated as a door mat in the entire show. The times when he does show any anger don't last long because he seems so easy to pacify. I don't understand what the point of having him on the show was if Earl and Joy were still going to be involved. Besides that, the acting on the show was very amateurish and extremely dry. Very emotionless. This show has the potential of leaving you brain dead if you watch it for too long.

999038,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B000G6BL88,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[8, 11]","Earl was an instant hit in our household. He reminded us just a little of stereotyped trailer trash like ""Joe Dirt"", but there was much more to Earl. His brother Randy certainly brings a funny cute and dumb dimension to the show as well, not to mention his gorgoeus and vicious ex-wife Joy and her new honest and intelligent employed black husband Darnell referred to as ""Crabman"". Now when you consider some of these people are suppose to portray poor white trash, the off color jokes amuse everyone. After all when Archie Bunker was on, he didn't just amuse white people. Every episode is a delight with Earl trying to undo the wrongs he did before he was hit by a car and lost his lotto ticket right after he won the lotto. His take on Kharma may be a little off kilter, but his intentions are good. Imagine someone you may know that doesn't want to work and that may even go to the extent of stealing things. Now imagine they have a life turning event that causes him or her to make a numbered list of every wrong thing they have ever done, and then set about making up to those they hurt. That is a show in itself, but the comedy is amazing.I am impresed with the writers for this series because they have truly made every episode a gem. Each episode reminds me of a short comedy movie. One example is when Earl tries to make up for someone that ended up in jail instead of him. He promises to bring the paper, fresh donuts, and a grandmother to him at prison. Now of course he can't just buy the newspaper, he has to get it from the prisoners uncle which is in a wheelchair that must be wheeled down several flights of stairs to the mailbox to get the paper and of course he has to go to the restroom half way down, and that isn't all the complications. Add to that he must avoid the one-legged ex-girlfriend at the name brand donut shop that he has to get a dozen donuts, the grandmother has to have eye-drops she doesn't want every ten minutes, and of course there are limited visiting hours at the prison. You probably begin to get the picture of how hard it is for Earl to do the right thing sometimes. The music is outstanding. The other night the episode had Joy running from a female Bounty Hunter. The scene where Joy and the Bounty Hunter face off and the music went from ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" to ""Everybody is Kung Fu Fighting"" was hysterical.

That ""My Name is Earl"" manages to accomplish this feat is nothing short of amazing.Consider the premise: deeply flawed man decides to go straight and turn his life around. He's not ordered to by the courts, his family isn't after him to do it, and he's skating through life well enough to be mostly content. No, he just up and decides to do it one day in a pain-killer induced haze after losing a $100,000 lottery ticket (he thinks karma, as explained by Carson Daily, caused him to lose it). This is somewhat similar to my own life when, after having my wisdom teeth pulled, I spent two days recovering from the anasthetic and made up my mind to change high schools for my second senior year (don't ask). Like Earl's choice, mine turned out to be a pretty good one!His mind made up to get a better life, Earl makes up a list, checks it twice, and sets out to go from naughty to nice (forgive me). The entire series then centers around his efforts to make up to the people he's wronged. This might include, as it does in the first episode, something fairly shallow (""I gotta get him laid!""), to something more deep, like trying to recover an old car he'd told his father was destroyed. The results of that effort end with one of the more touching episodes in the series.This first season contains many great episodes. It's the best so far, thoughMy Name Is Earl - Season 2is just about as good. The third season... well, the first two were great, and hopefully season four will rock!This DVD set includes all the episodes of the first season, some deleted scenes, plenty of commentary and a wonderful ""Mirror Universe"" episode of the show with special guest stars Brian and Stewie Griffin!If you haven't caught an episode of the show yet, please do. It's worth seeing, and buying on DVD. For a series like this, there's so many, many ways this series could've ended badly, but thanks in large part to an excellent cast and some very tight writting it's far better than it should be. I love the fact that so many of the supporting characters return through out the season (Patty the Daytime Hooker is one of my favorites), and that we get to see some of the long-term consequences of Earl's actions. I like that about the show. It gives it some nice continuity lacking in most sitcoms.Besides, where else will you have someone ask a woman about her mother and have her say, ""Oh, my mother is dead."" Then when offered condolences she just shrugs and says, ""It was her or me.""Classic. :)",5,"No, my name isn't Earl, but after this show, I kind of wish it was!",1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,2709,"['know', ""n't"", 'too', 'often', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'end', 'nearly', 'episode', 'leave', 'sitting', 'there', 'stupid', 'grin', 'face', 'sense', 'humanity', 'general', 'better', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lead', 'believe', 'Name', 'Earl', 'accomplish', 'feat', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing.Consider', 'premise', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'man', 'decides', 'go', 'straight', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'not', 'ordered', 'courts', 'family', ""n't"", 'do', 'skating', 'life', 'well', 'enough', 'be', 'mostly', 'content', 'No', 'just', 'up', 'decides', 'do', 'one', 'day', 'pain-killer', 'induced', 'haze', 'losing', '100,000', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'karma', 'explained', 'Carson', 'Daily', 'caused', 'lose', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'own', 'life', 'when', 'having', 'wisdom', 'teeth', 'pulled', 'spent', 'two', 'days', 'recovering', 'anasthetic', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'change', 'high', 'schools', 'second', 'senior', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Earl', 'choice', 'mine', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'mind', 'made', 'up', 'get', 'better', 'life', 'Earl', 'up', 'list', 'twice', 'out', 'go', 'naughty', 'nice', 'forgive', 'entire', 'series', 'then', 'efforts', 'make', 'up', 'people', 'wronged', 'might', 'include', 'first', 'episode', 'something', 'fairly', 'shallow', 'got', 'ta', 'get', 'laid', 'something', 'more', 'deep', 'trying', 'recover', 'old', 'car', ""'d"", 'told', 'father', 'was', 'destroyed', 'results', 'effort', 'end', 'one', 'more', 'touching', 'episodes', 'series.This', 'first', 'season', 'many', 'great', 'episodes', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'thoughMy', 'Name', 'Earl', 'Season', '2is', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'third', 'season', 'well', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'great', 'hopefully', 'season', 'four', 'will', 'rock', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'plenty', 'commentary', 'wonderful', 'Mirror', 'Universe', 'episode', 'show', 'special', 'guest', 'stars', 'Brian', 'Stewie', 'Griffin', 'have', ""n't"", 'caught', 'episode', 'show', 'yet', 'please', 'do', 'worth', 'seeing', 'buying', 'DVD', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'many', 'ways', 'series', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'badly', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'excellent', 'cast', 'very', 'tight', 'writting', 'far', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'love', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'return', 'season', 'Patty', 'Daytime', 'Hooker', 'one', 'favorites', 'get', 'see', 'long-term', 'consequences', 'Earl', 'actions', 'show', 'nice', 'continuity', 'lacking', 'most', 'sitcoms.Besides', 'where', 'else', 'will', 'have', 'someone', 'ask', 'woman', 'mother', 'have', 'say', 'Oh', 'mother', 'dead', 'Then', 'when', 'offered', 'condolences', 'just', 'shrugs', 'was', 'me.', 'Classic']",N/A
999042,A4WEZJOIZIV4U,B000G6BL88,"Chuck Bittner ""Disabled comedian & gamer!""","[0, 0]",So I have to tell you my name is Earl is one my favorite TV shows of all times I'm now watching seasons 1 and 2 for the 2nd time and Earl's brother Randy just says some of the funniest things I've ever heard when he mixes up what a word means or he desires to lick the blue powder from Earl's because he loves the blue is just comic gold.If you don't know the show's premise it revolves around Earl and his struggle to appease karma and be a better person. In each episode he goes after one person on this master list is written down that include many of the things he did that he is not proud of when he was a child and young adult and grown man. And each episode you will find follows the same sort of premise and pattern. Not to the shows fault sometimes it gets old and repetitive but I think the characters especially Randy and Crab Man add to the funny humor of Earl and it seriously just can consistently be enjoyable.One thing I realized is this show really raised the bar for camo appearances by older actors & actresses.  It really is fun to even see future stars make their appearances (Chlo Grace Moretz).  I think it adds to the comedy of it.Now I didn't really like seasons 3 and 4 from what I remember watching them 3 years ago so this is my 2nd watch through and I will update this at my feelings change but I felt in the past the repetition just got old but seasons 1 and 2 are just epic awesome television. And one thing I like about the show is it doesn't force Karma down your throat in a preachy way as many of the other characters don't accept the karma but still enjoy helping Earl in his quest to be a better person. This showed just works.  And that is why I gave it 5 stars even if I didn't totally love the final seasons.Another thing is the after show - bed room conversations are soooo funny I don't laugh out loud at comedy much but these have me rolling on the floor laughing out loud... for real.I hope you enjoy it and either watching it free streaming because I have Amazon prime and if you're going to purchase it I say just purchase Amazon prime for $80 a year at my $.02,5,"Hi Crab Man, I love this show - Randy is pure comic gold!

He plays a low life who turns his life around after getting hit by a car. He believes nothing good will happen in his life unless he helps out people he was mean to in the past. So he carries around a list and crosses off names after he helps out that person. Jason Lee is brilliant and always funny as is Ethan Suplee as his big childlike brother Randy. He deserves some sort of nomination for his work on the show as well.Jaime Pressly is good also as Earl's ex wife who had him sign divorve papers in his hospital bed after he was hit by a car. She wants everything he has and soon finds out he won the lottery before he was hit by a car. So of course she wants his money after she already took his trailer home and everything else of his. My favorite episode is when she realizes she has him on tape saying he'd give her everything if he died. So of course she buys a bunch of weapons to go kill him which leads to some brilliantly funny scenes.The show also offers great appearances by people like Giovanni Ribisi. Ribisi plays Earl's redneck friend who just got out of jail. He trys following Earl's footsteps with Karma for about 5 seconds before he goes back to stealing. He's really funny and makes you wish he'd just become a regular already! He fits in perfectly with the show and makes it even more great fun than it already is.I'm also a fan of the under-rated Timothy Olyphant (Go, Deadwood) and he makes a pretty funny appearence too. He plays a sleazy car racer who thinks he's cool because he had sex with 4 girls when he's in his 30's. When Earl sees him again when he's older he now brags that he now had sex with 5 girls lol. Juliet Lewiss (Natural Born Killers, From Dusk to Dawn) also has a funny appearance as a bounty hunter who wants revenge on Earl's ex wife for knocking out her teeth. It's hard to explain the show. It has it's scenes of low class stuff but it manages to make low class ....charming since Earl himself is both low class and charming. It also shows that the world would be a better place if people had a list and tried to make things up to people they hurt in the past.",5,If you're not watching it......start!,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,2207,"['Name', 'Earl', 'brilliant', 'always', 'fun', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Dogma', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'low', 'life', 'who', 'life', 'getting', 'hit', 'car', 'nothing', 'good', 'will', 'happen', 'life', 'out', 'people', 'was', 'mean', 'past', 'list', 'off', 'names', 'out', 'person', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'brilliant', 'always', 'funny', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'big', 'childlike', 'brother', 'Randy', 'sort', 'nomination', 'work', 'show', 'well.Jaime', 'Pressly', 'good', 'also', 'Earl', 'ex', 'wife', 'who', 'had', 'sign', 'divorve', 'papers', 'hospital', 'bed', 'was', 'hit', 'car', 'everything', 'soon', 'out', 'won', 'lottery', 'was', 'hit', 'car', 'So', 'course', 'money', 'already', 'took', 'trailer', 'home', 'everything', 'else', 'favorite', 'episode', 'when', 'tape', 'saying', ""'d"", 'give', 'everything', 'died', 'So', 'course', 'bunch', 'weapons', 'go', 'kill', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'scenes.The', 'show', 'also', 'great', 'appearances', 'people', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Ribisi', 'Earl', 'redneck', 'friend', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'jail', 'trys', 'following', 'Earl', 'footsteps', 'Karma', 'about', '5', 'seconds', 'back', 'stealing', 'really', 'funny', 'wish', ""'d"", 'just', 'become', 'regular', 'already', 'perfectly', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'great', 'fun', 'already', ""'m"", 'also', 'fan', 'under-rated', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Go', 'Deadwood', 'pretty', 'funny', 'appearence', 'too', 'sleazy', 'car', 'racer', 'who', 'cool', 'had', 'sex', '4', 'girls', 'when', '30', 'When', 'Earl', 'again', 'when', 'older', 'now', 'now', 'had', 'sex', '5', 'girls', 'lol', 'Juliet', 'Lewiss', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'From', 'Dusk', 'Dawn', 'also', 'funny', 'appearance', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'who', 'revenge', 'Earl', 'ex', 'wife', 'knocking', 'out', 'teeth', 'hard', 'explain', 'show', 'scenes', 'low', 'class', 'stuff', 'make', 'low', 'class', '.charming', 'Earl', 'low', 'class', 'charming', 'also', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'people', 'had', 'list', 'tried', 'make', 'things', 'people', 'hurt', 'past']",N/A

999054,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000G6BL88,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[4, 4]","It is doubtful that very many people in this world have been influenced by the words of Carson Daly. However, there is at least one person, and his name is Earl Hickey.Each fall I find myself conflicted about new shows for a variety of reasons. Should I get attached if it is going to get cancelled? Do I have time for another television show? Or do I like the idea of this show? So I limit myself to only two new shows each season. In the fall of 2005, one of those shows was My Name is Earl. The buzz surrounding this show was amazing and I felt that if I didn't watch, I was going to be missing out on something.And I was right. Earl is one of those shows that helps me to believe in the good in people, if only for 22 minutes at a time.Earl Hickey (Jason Lee) is one of those guys who you might call sketchy. With his ragged clothes and big moustache, he may be the typical ideal of a redneck. He has lived his life without much regard for others and never really thought about it that much. That is, until he bought a 100,000 dollar scratch ticket. Celebrating the win, he is hit by a car and ends up in the hospital, where he tunes in to hear Carson Daly talking about karma and he decides to change his life.Earl makes up a list of everything he has done wrong and sets out to make things right, one list item at a time. This is the premise for the show and it really works. Each episode sees Earl focusing on one thing on his list. Items get added as he goes along, and occasionally he'll take care of a couple in one episode. But with a list of more than 250 things, the show has a solid base to work with. And when he starts doing things on the list, the ticket ends up back in his hands, reinforcing his belief in karma.Along for the ride with Earl is his simple brother Randy (Ethan Suplee). Randy's simple mind and uncluttered thinking make for some great comedy. It is obvious the two brothers care about each other a lot, though they do have their differences.The brothers rent a motel room and befriend the hotel maid Catalina (Nadine Velazquez), a beautiful illegal immigrant who immediately steals Randy's attention. She helps the brothers out on occasion as they try to make right all the things that Earl has done wrong in his life.Stealing the show, however, is Earl's ex-wife Joy, played to perfection by the beautiful Jaime Pressly. If you were thinking of a ""queen of the trailer park"" type, Joy would be it and Pressly has her nailed. It seems Earl met Joy while he was drunk and didn't notice she was pregnant. Then, a few years later Joy had another baby, but he was black. So with two kids that weren't his own, Earl wasn't living the great life. Joy divorces Earl in the pilot to be with her black baby's real father, Darnell Turner (Eddie Steeples), a waiter at the gang's hangout, the Crab Shack, thus earning him the nickname Crabman. These two characters are really great together and Joy's quest to get her hands on Earl's newfound money and Crabman's desire to remain friends with Earl play off each other really well.The season tracks Earl through the ups and downs as he confronts people from his past, including the one-legged woman he stole a car from, Donnie Jones, who he sent to jail, Kenny James, a boy he picked on as a kid, his father Carl (guest star Beau Bridges) whom he lost an election, and a jilted-ex turned bounty hunter, played wonderfully by guest star Juliette Lewis. As the season goes along viewers learn a lot about Earl and just where he comes from and how he became who he is.This DVD set was well done, with a number of commentaries. Each of the main characters does at least one, while Jason Lee and Ethan Suplee each chip in on a number. Creator Greg Garcia and director Mark Buckland also sit in on most of the commentaries. There is a great gag reel and a behind the scenes featurette. Perhaps the best extra is the ""lost pilot"" called Bad Karma. Instead of listening to Carson Daly, Earl listens to Stewie Griffin and makes a list of people who screwed him over and sets out to do the same to them. This was pretty funny because it showed a side of the characters that you never saw on the real show.This was a great set of one of the best comedies on television now. For those who have never seen the show, if you want to see a comedy about someone trying to change for the better, you can't do much better than My Name is Earl.",5,Do you believe in Karma?,1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,4396,"['doubtful', 'very', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'words', 'Carson', 'Daly', 'However', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'name', 'Earl', 'Hickey.Each', 'fall', 'find', 'conflicted', 'new', 'shows', 'variety', 'reasons', 'Should', 'get', 'attached', 'going', 'get', 'cancelled', 'Do', 'have', 'time', 'television', 'show', 'do', 'idea', 'show', 'So', 'limit', 'only', 'two', 'new', 'shows', 'season', 'fall', '2005', 'one', 'shows', 'was', 'Name', 'Earl', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'show', 'was', 'amazing', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'something.And', 'was', 'right', 'Earl', 'one', 'shows', 'believe', 'good', 'people', 'only', '22', 'minutes', 'time.Earl', 'Hickey', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'might', 'call', 'sketchy', 'ragged', 'clothes', 'big', 'moustache', 'may', 'be', 'typical', 'ideal', 'redneck', 'lived', 'life', 'much', 'regard', 'others', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'much', 'bought', '100,000', 'dollar', 'scratch', 'ticket', 'Celebrating', 'win', 'hit', 'car', 'up', 'hospital', 'where', 'hear', 'Carson', 'Daly', 'talking', 'karma', 'change', 'life.Earl', 'up', 'list', 'everything', 'done', 'wrong', 'out', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'one', 'list', 'item', 'time', 'premise', 'show', 'really', 'episode', 'Earl', 'focusing', 'one', 'thing', 'list', 'Items', 'get', 'added', 'along', 'occasionally', ""'ll"", 'take', 'care', 'couple', 'one', 'episode', 'list', 'more', '250', 'things', 'show', 'solid', 'base', 'work', 'when', 'doing', 'things', 'list', 'ticket', 'up', 'back', 'hands', 'reinforcing', 'belief', 'karma.Along', 'ride', 'Earl', 'simple', 'brother', 'Randy', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'Randy', 'simple', 'mind', 'uncluttered', 'thinking', 'make', 'great', 'comedy', 'obvious', 'two', 'brothers', 'care', 'other', 'lot', 'do', 'have', 'differences.The', 'brothers', 'rent', 'motel', 'room', 'befriend', 'hotel', 'maid', 'Catalina', 'Nadine', 'Velazquez', 'beautiful', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'who', 'immediately', 'Randy', 'attention', 'brothers', 'out', 'occasion', 'try', 'make', 'right', 'things', 'Earl', 'done', 'wrong', 'life.Stealing', 'show', 'however', 'Earl', 'ex-wife', 'Joy', 'played', 'perfection', 'beautiful', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'were', 'thinking', 'queen', 'trailer', 'park', 'type', 'Joy', 'would', 'be', 'Pressly', 'nailed', 'Earl', 'met', 'Joy', 'was', 'drunk', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Then', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Joy', 'had', 'baby', 'was', 'black', 'So', 'two', 'kids', 'were', ""n't"", 'own', 'Earl', 'was', ""n't"", 'living', 'great', 'life', 'Joy', 'Earl', 'pilot', 'be', 'black', 'baby', 'real', 'father', 'Darnell', 'Turner', 'Eddie', 'Steeples', 'waiter', 'gang', 'hangout', 'Crab', 'Shack', 'thus', 'earning', 'nickname', 'Crabman', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'together', 'Joy', 'quest', 'get', 'hands', 'Earl', 'newfound', 'money', 'Crabman', 'desire', 'remain', 'friends', 'Earl', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'really', 'well.The', 'season', 'tracks', 'Earl', 'ups', 'downs', 'people', 'past', 'including', 'one-legged', 'woman', 'stole', 'car', 'Donnie', 'Jones', 'who', 'sent', 'jail', 'Kenny', 'James', 'boy', 'picked', 'kid', 'father', 'Carl', 'guest', 'star', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'whom', 'lost', 'election', 'jilted-ex', 'turned', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'guest', 'star', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'season', 'viewers', 'learn', 'lot', 'Earl', 'just', 'where', 'how', 'became', 'who', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'number', 'commentaries', 'main', 'characters', 'least', 'one', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'chip', 'number', 'Creator', 'Greg', 'Garcia', 'director', 'Mark', 'Buckland', 'also', 'sit', 'most', 'commentaries', 'great', 'gag', 'reel', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'extra', 'lost', 'pilot', 'called', 'Bad', 'Karma', 'Instead', 'listening', 'Carson', 'Daly', 'Earl', 'Stewie', 'Griffin', 'list', 'people', 'who', 'screwed', 'sets', 'out', 'do', 'same', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'showed', 'side', 'characters', 'never', 'saw', 'real', 'show.This', 'was', 'great', 'set', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'television', 'now', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'want', 'see', 'comedy', 'someone', 'trying', 'change', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'Name', 'Earl']",N/A

I mean, in one episode, Earl even wants to pay his TAXES!!! What sane person wants to do that? He believes he owes the gov't a certain amount, and when they don't take his money, he tries pay them back by picking up trash with prisoners (and gets taken to prison), finally breaking the law by getting stuck in a water tower with Randy. The police have to rescue them, which costs a lot in fines and rescue work - but Earl can relax now that they're ""even.""One of my favorite episodes is when Earl tried to give Joy a better wedding to make up for the first (""Ruined Joy's Wedding"" on his list). Darnell aka ""Crab Man"" has to go to the park to reserve the shady spot, Joy and Crab Man are registered at the liquor store (not a bad idea though), and the cake is made of Twinkies, other Tastykake desserts like cupcakes, and donuts too, I think. Also liked ""Stole a Police Badge"" (Earl and Randy got away with Everything, along with getting free food) and ""Stole Beer from a Golfer."" In the golf one, Earl and Randy fixed games to get free beer at the country club (the high scorer would buy everyone beer when he won). With that incentive, the brothers ran around the golf course to put the ball right in the hole, hiding in the shrubbery before the golfer had walked over.Jason Lee is an intelligent actor - his mannerisms and accents seem authentic to his environment. While I'll always remember Ethan Supplee (Randy) as that bully who hung out with some other thugs in the hallway (by the payphone) on ""Boy Meets World,"" now I think of him more as the dim-witted Randy. It's such a stronger role, of course.Ever since the departure of ""Roseanne,"" ""Drew Carey,"" and a tiny number of similar shows, there's been very few shows about the working class (and/or rednecks, as in the case of ""Earl""). Thank God for ""My Name is Earl."" After all, we need diversity on tv.

Now that we finally have this show in Australia, I'm absolutely impressed and stoked.  I've loved Jason Lee since Heartbreakers and Enemy Of The State and Jersey Girl to name a few, but this is possibly his best role whether in movies or tv.In the first episode, you see Earl buy a lottery ticket, win and then get hit by a car.  His ticket goes flying in the air out of his reach.  While recovering in hospital, he sees a show about Karma and figures that it's trying to tell him something.  He creates a list of all the bad he's done to people and just in general, and sets out to make amends.  It has hillarious results.

While in hospital he has a revelation and decides to make a ""karma list"" - a list of everything he has done wrong and all of the people that he has wronged and decides to set about making up to these people and crossing them off his list. He crosses his first bad deed off the list during the episode and finds his winning lottery ticket again. Seeing this as a mesage from karma he decided to spend his winnings on crossing all the bad deeds off his list, with the help of his brother, Randy and often his ex-wife Joy and her new husband Darnell (AKA Crabman).This is a brilliant series, every episode is hillarious, clever and has a good message about how you should treat others.

Suffice to say that I really enjoy the show a LOT, so I'll focus my comments on what the DVD offers.Audio Commentary exists only on a few episodes: ""Pilot"", ""Teacher Earl"", ""Joy's Wedding"", ""O Karma, Where Art Thou"", ""Dad's Car"" (featuring the mothers of the cast members), & ""Number One"" (the season finale). The commentary is good, informative, and even funny at times, though nothing too special.Deleted Scenes: Either this is one of the most tightly produced series in TV history or they just didn't include that many deleted scenes (I'm leaning towards the latter).  Only a few are included and we can see why they were either cut down or not included.  Still, for fans out there what few deleted scenes they included are nice.""Making Things Right: Behind the Scenes of My Name Is Earl"" is a very well made documentary detailing the origin of the series along with the casting and other interesting stories.  As hard as I found it to believe, the series is based on an actual person (with a few details added).""Karma is a Funny Thing: Blooper Reel"" is pretty much standard stuff of the cast cracking up. But it does show just how fun it must be to work on the set.""Bad Karma"": This one, a fifteen minute or so ""lost Pilot"" episode made specifically for the DVD is absolutely hilarious and a must have for all ""Earl"" fans out there.  Hosted by a clean shaven Jason Lee, I was laughing hard from the first minute as the episode plays out like a wonderful ""what if""...as in ""What if Earl got his inspiration from a source other than Carson Daly?""

I have been following Lee's career from the start back in 'Mallrats' and 'Chasing Amy' and have been very impressed with his acting over the years, especially considering his professional skateboarding background. Sure he has made some duds along the way but who hasn't?... It is now good to see he has made the move on to TV and what a relief. This is the only show I watch on tv anymore and now I own the series on DVD i can watch it whenever I want. It is genuienely funny and absent of the canned laughter which gets over-bearing on American sitcoms these days. It is refreshing to know script writers can come up with funny and original scripts these days and keep an audience enetrtained for a full 23 minutes.Lee is the star of the show obviously, but he is backed up by a brilliant supporting cast. Ethan Suplee is outstanding as Randy, about 100 pounds lighter in this role, Suplee has amazed critics and fans alike as Earl's dimwitted brother, also adding an on screen chemistry with Jason Lee which is evident for all to see. Eddie Steeples is hillarious as Darnell, but I was actually most impressed by Jaime Pressly. I had never been a fan of hers but she is actually quite good, and funny, as Earl's ex-wife joy. Throw in newcomer Nadine Velazquez, (a J-Lo lookalike) and you have a very good cast.Season one also features some very memorable guest appearences by the like of Giovanni Ribisi, Blake Clark, Jonny Galecki, Brett Butler, Missi Pyle, Jon Favreau and more.....

999082,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000G6BL88,Robert Moore,"[14, 19]","Along with EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS, Jason Lee's MY NAME IS EARL emerged as the finest new comedy of this past season.  The premise was simple:  a perpetual and hapless petty criminal wins the lottery but while celebrating gets hit by a car, causing him to lose the lottery ticket.  While in the hospital he sees Carson Daly on TV talking about his philosophy of life, which he describes as karma, i.e. what goes around comes around.  Earl comes to the sudden realization that the reason his life sucks is that he has spent his life doing nothing but sucky things to others.  He resolves to make up for every bad thing he has ever done by compiling a list of everything he has ever done to hurt someone else and then making amends in each instance.  When he finds the lost lottery ticket upon his discharge, he sees this as a sign that he is supposed to use that money to finance his quest.  As he puts it each week, ""I'm just trying to be a better person.""I have to confess that I often found Jason Lee irritating in most of his movie roles, especially his Kevin Smith films, though he was very fine in ALMOST FAMOUS as the lead singer for the band.  Here he essentially recreates Nicholas Cage's character H.I. McDunnough from RAISING ARIZONA.  They not only engage in the same kinds of petty thievery, they even resemble one another, and Lee affects the same kind of dumb, lopsided deer-in-the-headlights look of stupefaction that Cage perfected in that great film.  But this isn't just mere imitation; Lee really makes the role his own and manages to imbue his utterly stupid character with a kind of genuine goodhearted nobility.  For the show to work at all, Lee has to excel as Earl Hickey, and excel he does.  Lee's Earl is clearly the central character and he does a great job of carrying the show, but he is assisted by an able though relatively small supporting cast.  As good as Lee is as Earl, Jaime Pressly steals just about every episode as Earl's vile ex-wife Joy.  An amazing beauty and real life former beauty queen, Pressly manages to come across as pure white trash (look, I'm the scion of several generations of white trash, so I know whereof I talk--you know the folks Jeff Foxworthy always jokes about?  Well, those are my people.), albeit trash trapped in a stunning body.  Her character could have been insufferable had they kept her the same ruthless plotter that she was in the earliest episodes, but as the season goes along they give her more and more depth, so that you come to learn that a lot of her harsh exterior covers genuine vulnerabilities.  Ethan Suplee, another Kevin Smith alumni, plays Earl's brother Randy, one of the world's true innocents.  Though Earl is not the sharpest tack in the box, he is Einstein compared to his brother Randy, but while Earl is truly trying to be a better person, Randy has always been one, even when he was assisting Earl in petty thievery.  His problem is that he simply doesn't know any better.  He is a very dim person with an extremely good heart.  Much the same can be said for Joy's husband Darnell, whom Earl inexplicably calls Crab Man.  Darnell is played by Eddie Steeples, who became a familiar face immediately before the show hit the air playing an office clerk in love with his rubber band ball in a series of Office Max commercials (he graced the cover of the 2005 Office Max catalog).  Earl and Randy live in a seedy motor inn, where they have befriended the Mexican maid Catalina, played by the gorgeous Nadine Velazquez.  So far her character has disappointed me.  I'm not disappointed with the actress, but with the writers for not finding a better way of integrating her into the show.  Few shows success by keeping the focus on just the main three or four characters and I suspect that for the show to develop--and it definitely will need to develop to stay a top show--they will need to do more with Catalina in the future.  The cast is rounded out by a few performers who have made repeated guest appearances, including Giovanni Ribisi as a fellow crook, Beau Bridges as Earl and Randy's dad, Tracy Ashton as a one-legged girl Earl wronged (and who he has a huge amount of trouble trying to make amends), and Max Perlich.I really enjoyed Season One, but I have some worries about where the show goes in the future.  Each episode is structured around Earl getting to take one thing off the list each week.  While this provides an easy framework to introduce each week's story, it could easily become a limiting premise.  To succeed in the long run they are going to have to transcend this premise to become much more than a show about crossing someone else off Earl's list each week.  Towards the end of the season they started showing signs that they were going to start breaking out of this framework to some degree.  My other fear for the show is that while the characters are all a lot of fun, they might all be a tad too inherently two-dimensional to carry a series over several seasons.  In other words, I fear that the show while a lot of fun in the short run might get old quick.  They are going to have to give the characters a lot more depth in the future, which might be hard given how fundamentally dumb all the main characters are, excepting only Catalina, who has been underutilized so far.  Thanks to shows like ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT and SCRUBS and THE OFFICE, the bar has been raised for comedies on TV.  Fifteen years ago the show would have been able to just go on as it is, but shows like those just mentioned challenge shows to develop and expand.  My gut tells me that the show will be up to the challenge.But fears for the future aside, this was in its first season a truly funny show with a genuinely unique set of characters.  I'm definitely looking forward to see what they are able to do with the show in its second season.",5,One man's effort to be a better person,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,5838,"['EVERYBODY', 'HATES',

I thought it look like it could have some clever moments to the show, but with Jason Lee at the helm it could just as easily bomb.  But it was given a good time slot (right before the Office, one of only three shows on TV I like) and so when the pilot aired and decided to give it a shot.  And I was blown away at how good the writing, acting, and directing were.  And to boot it was as funny as the Office, but in 180 degree turn.  Jason Lee's performance of Earl, a regular guy who's had some problems but is trying to turn his life around, is simply perfect.  He seems genuine and you can relate to the character, even if you've never stolen anything in your life.  So rarely in Hollywood do you get a message that doing good things for others brings good things.  Although it does it in weird and strange ways.  (Otherwise it wouldn't be a comedy)  Earl has just won and lost one hundred thousand dollars and ends up getting hit by a car.  While in the Hospital, he writes down a list of every bad thing he has done in his life and vows to fix every one.  Earl ends up getting the money back, but decides to use it for his list with the help of his brother. Earl's brother Randy played by Ethan Suplee is the bright star of the show.  He has a loyalty to his brother that is also so rarely shown.  While he is a bit dim-witted and doesn't always understand why they are doing the things they do, he's stands by Earl no matter what.  And gets into funny situations himself that are almost funnier than the main story.  Earl's ex-wife, Joy and her new husband, Darnell, or Crabman as Earl calls him, lend some create supporting work as the trailer trash family who long for something better, and try, but never quite succeed simply because Joy's attitude is not where it should be.  And even though they're not married anymore, Earl holds no grudges and helps whenever he can.  (Again not something you often see in Hollywood) Catalina, the fiesty illegal immigrant who works at the motel Earl and Randy live in rounds out the cast.  With a strange combination of sweetness and toughness she does all she can to help Earl in his quest to better his life.  My Name is Earl's first season was awesome and if the writing can stay snappy, fresh and original, then this show should be around for six to seven seasons.  I hope it does.

Ward,"[2, 2]","In the wake of dozens of awful television shows flooding the networks these days, it is refreshing to see a show come along which is actually funny. My Name is Earl is original and entertaining. Jason Lee is a terrific comedic actor as he plays a mischievous criminal turned good guy correcting his years of unkind and bad behavior. The supporting cast are also funny, especially Jamie Pressly as Earl's wise-cracking ex-wife Joy. The humor is slightly offbeat and even a little tasteless at times, but nothing overdone as you laugh away following the adventures of Earl and his loveable misfits as they assist him in his quest to do good by the law of karma.",5,A Good Karma Sitcom,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,659,"['wake', 'dozens', 'awful', 'television', 'shows', 'flooding', 'networks', 'days', 'refreshing', 'see', 'show', 'come', 'actually', 'funny', 'Name', 'Earl', 'original', 'entertaining', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'terrific', 'comedic', 'actor', 'mischievous', 'criminal', 'turned', 'good', 'guy', 'correcting', 'years', 'unkind', 'bad', 'behavior', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'funny', 'especially', 'Jamie', 'Pressly', 'Earl', 'wise-cracking', 'ex-wife', 'Joy', 'humor', 'slightly', 'offbeat', 'even', 'little', 'tasteless', 'times', 'nothing', 'overdone', 'laugh', 'away', 'following', 'adventures', 'Earl', 'loveable', 'misfits', 'assist', 'quest', 'do', 'good', 'law', 'karma']",N/A

I don't watch much network TV but I was intrigued by the commercial so I tuned in and got hooked.Jason Lee plays Earl Hickey. Earl was supposed to be named Carl but someone makes curly ""C's"" so the person who filled out the birth certificate thought his name was Earl.Earl was a troublemaker along with his younger brother Randy. He bought a winning lottery ticket and was immediately hit by a car. While in the hospital he heard about ""karma"", something he believes Carson Daly invented. After leaving the hospital he found the lottery ticket. He moved into a hotel with Randy and decided he was going to start making right all of the things he had done wrong.

The following paragraph summarizes the basic plot of the show. I talk about how the show looks on DVD in the second paragraph and extras in the third. You might want to skip to whichever one interests you the most. By the way the DVD set does have an exclusive episode to DVD kind of an alternate-world version of the pilot.As Earl (Jason Lee) discovers instant karma it might not hit you in the head but hit you with a car because after all karma is a two way street and the result is that Earl tries to fix all the wrongs he's done in his petty thieving amoral life with a list of the bad things he's done and who he has done them to. When he wins the lottery that allows him to try and make good it's just that the people he's wronged don't want to see Earl again. A very funny show that manages to be both witty but allow Earl to retain some of his dignity ""My Name is Earl"" became a surprise hit for NBC demonstrating that the network had a group of comedy winners after a fallow period.""Earl"" doesn't look scruffy in this very nice transfer to DVD. We get all 24 first season episodes on four dual layered DVDs. Audio is presented in 5.1 but the show really would have sounded just as good in 2.0 since this is comedy (although there are some for what of a better phrase action sequences that do benefit from the 5.1 mix). An exceptional presentation from Fox makes this a must own for fans of the series.For those interested in extras we get the following ones all of which are very good: We get the exclusive episode ""Misadventures: Bad Karma"" a sort of alternate world look at Earl and a list that he makes of everybody who ever screwed him over and what he's going to do about it. We also get both episode commentaries on the following episodes: ""Pilot"" features creator/writer/producer Greg Garcia, director Marc Buckland, producer/star Jason Lee and actor Ethan Suplee in an amusing discussion about the making of the show that also features plenty of tidbits. ""Teacher Earl"" features Garcia, Lee, Suplee and guest star Giovanni Ribisi. ""White Lie Christmas"" features Garcia, producer Tim Stack and actors Jaime Pressly and Nadine Velazquez. ""O Karma Where Art Thou"" features producer/actor Lee, creator Garcia, actor Ethan Suplee and guest star Jon Favreau. """"Dad's Car"" has a fun group on the commentary track including commentary by the moms of Garcia, director Buckland, Lee and Suplee.  Finally the last episode of the season ""Number One"" features the same crew as the pilot.""Karma is a Funny Thing"" features bloopers, ""Making Things Right"" provides us with a fun behind-the-scenes look at the production of the show. We also get deleted scenes for the show.Target stores feature an exclusive disc that runs about twenty minutes with three additional features. The first compares the table read (the first read through of a script) to final scenes and a brief interview with creator Garcia while he's driving his Earl like car. We also get ""The Great Race"" a behind-the-scenes short featurette that takes us into the production of the race where Earl races by having his brother push his car and the car of a competitor. Finally we get ""Karma Strikes Again"" which combines brief interview snippets with bloopers not included in the other blooper reel in an odd but endearing combination.Best Buy features a flannel shirt and a bonus soundtrack disc with music from the film some of which are exclusive to the disc. Which one you should get depends on which bonus features matter to you.A terrific funny show that like ""The Office"" deserves to be ranked among the best sitcoms on TV ""My Name is Earl"" comes with its own list that will do right by viewers and buyers of this set.
