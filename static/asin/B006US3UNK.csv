The two female leads were the only ones who appear to know how to deliver a line, even as bad as it is sometimes. And to give Tom Skerritt what amounts to top billing for his less than 10 minutes on screen is an obvious ploy to attract viewers, which it did for me.

1520119,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B006US3UNK,mk,"[0, 0]","This film, cowritten by the star, Jay Pickett, tells a story of a man seeking to heal his tragic past.  For the most part, it engrosses the viewer and offers realistic situations, good acting, and great countryside.Jay Pickett released from 8 years of imprisonment returns home to a town that doesn't want him, an ex-wife with unexpected news, an ex-lover, and his widowed mother who's just getting along.  He has his girl problems, and it is his fault.A changed man, he struggles to do what's right, but there are no easy answers, and he stews in his quilt and loss of self-worth.All the actors do a fine job.  Tom Skerritt has more of a cameo, but it's an important one.  The story teeters dangerously close to melodrama, but doesn't quite reach it.  The moral of the story of love, integrity, and making amends is quite good and meaningful.  Dealing with the consequences of one's actions makes for a relatable condition that we all have had to face to some degree in our lives.Overall, a good flick, but not kid friendly: very adult themes with alcohol, adultery, death, some language, and implied sexual situations.",4,"Engaging Drama, Beautiful Scenery",1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,1120,"['film', 'cowritten', 'star', 'Jay', 'Pickett', 'story', 'man', 'seeking', 'heal', 'tragic', 'past', 'most', 'part', 'viewer', 'realistic', 'situations', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'countryside.Jay', 'Pickett', 'released', '8', 'years', 'imprisonment', 'returns', 'home', 'town', ""n't"", 'want', 'ex-wife', 'unexpected', 'news', 'ex-lover', 'widowed', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'getting', 'along', 'girl', 'problems', 'fault.A', 'changed', 'man', 'do', 'what', ""'s"", 'right', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'quilt', 'loss', 'self-worth.All', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'more', 'cameo', 'important', 'one', 'story', 'teeters', 'dangerously', 'close', 'melodrama', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'moral', 'story', 'love', 'integrity', 'making', 'amends', 'quite', 'good', 'meaningful', 'Dealing', 'consequences', 'one', 'actions', 'relatable', 'condition', 'have', 'had', 'face', 'degree', 'lives.Overall', 'good', 'flick', 'not', 'kid', 'friendly', 'very', 'themes', 'alcohol', 'adultery', 'death', 'language', 'implied', 'sexual', 'situations']",Soda Springs
1520120,A1N9QERVTIUA9,B006US3UNK,"Patrick Ricketts ""Videovews.org""","[7, 7]","""Soda Springs"" is a Western/Drama about a man looking for redemption and just wanting the chance to proof he can belong again. Right from the start of the film I knew I was in for something special, Eden was a character I immediately attached myself to and no matter what happened in the past I wanted the best for him going forward so I was engaged and set to see it through. Eden isn't the only character in the film that you take notice of right away, every character is well-written and realistic and when you combine that with a terrific story, beautiful landscapes and amazing music you got your self a gem and ""Soda Springs"" is just that, it's a dramatic triumph. The film tears at your emotions, from happy to sad the film draws you in and never lets up.There's a lot going on in Eden's life after he returns but to talk too much about the details would only ruin the film for those waiting to see it. This is one of those stories that reminds us why we fell in love with cinema in the first place, sadly you don't get to see many films like ""Soda Springs"" anymore so when one does show up it's not only a surprise but a joy as well.The entire cast did a terrific job, Jay Pickett is incredible was Eden and Tom Skerritt gives a powerful performance as his father in a limited role. I can go right through the cast but instead I will just say everyone is fantastic in their roles. If you like a good drama then I highly recommend picking up one of the best films I have seen so far this year, I am confident it will find a huge audience on DVD with strong word of mouth.Do yourself a favor and make sure you pick this up, you are going to be glad you did. Let me finish by saying Director, Michael Feifer has a talent for telling a good story, my hat goes off to him and I look forward to seeing what he has coming out next.",5,Highly Enjoyable,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,1832,"['Soda', 'Springs', 'Western/Drama', 'man', 'looking', 'redemption', 'just', 'wanting', 'chance', 'proof', 'can', 'belong', 'again', 'Right', 'start', 'film', 'knew', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'Eden', 'was', 'character', 'immediately', 'attached', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'wanted', 'best', 'going', 'forward', 'so', 'was', 'engaged', 'set', 'see', 'Eden', ""n't"", 'only', 'character', 'film', 'take', 'notice', 'right', 'away', 'character', 'well-written', 'realistic', 'when', 'combine', 'terrific', 'story', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'amazing', 'music', 'got', 'self', 'gem', 'Soda', 'Springs', 'just', 'dramatic', 'triumph', 'film', 'tears', 'emotions', 'happy', 'sad', 'film', 'draws', 'never', 'lot', 'going', 'Eden', 'life', 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'details', 'would', 'only', 'ruin', 'film', 'waiting', 'see', 'one', 'stories', 'why', 'fell', 'love', 'cinema', 'first', 'place', 'sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'many', 'films', 'Soda', 'Springs', 'anymore', 'so', 'when', 'one', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'surprise', 'joy', 'well.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'Jay', 'Pickett', 'incredible', 'was', 'Eden', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'powerful', 'performance', 'father', 'limited', 'role', 'can', 'go', 'right', 'cast', 'instead', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'everyone', 'fantastic', 'roles', 'like', 'good', 'drama', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'am', 'confident', 'will', 'find', 'huge', 'audience', 'DVD', 'strong', 'word', 'mouth.Do', 'favor', 'make', 'sure', 'pick', 'up', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'Let', 'finish', 'saying', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Feifer', 'talent', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'hat', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'coming', 'out', 'next']",Soda Springs

My husband loved it, and made me play it over and over again before he died.  It is a man's movie, but it has romance and mystery for women to enjoy.It's about a man who has been in prison for 10 years over a crime that he is unable to forgive himself for.  The town is more than happy to oblige him on that feeling, as well.  How he digs himself out of his own depression and makes a way to go on with his life, is the driving plot of the movie.

He is surprised at his release as is everyone else. Apparently in Oregon they release prisoners at random. He returns home to a mother (Patty McCormack) that still loves him, but a community that has some people who wish Eden would rot in prison.Eden (symbolic for new beginning) keeps his prison Bible, but this is not really a ""faith based"" film. He has memories of that fateful night, playing at the local honky-tonk and cheating on his wife Pam (Miranda Frigon). Pam gets even by not visiting Eden in prison and marrying Larry (Michael Bowen) the town's biggest A-Hole.Larry controls the sheriff (Duane Stephens) and doesn't like Eden hanging around, partly because he uses annoying phrases such as ""it is what it is."" Shelly (Victoria Pratt) the pretty blond who owns the feed store, needs some help. It normally isn't hard to figure out where this drama is headed as Jay Pickett subs for Patrick Swayze. I was pleasantly surprised by the twists the film takes in this unlikely drama about redemption.4 stars for fans of ""Lifetime"" style films.No f-bombs, but some adult language (S-word, P-word, AH-word, SOB), implied sex, no nudity (girl in bra-Whitnie Mauney) Brief appearances by Tom Skerritt as the dad.",4,STOP OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT!,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,1318,"['film', 'slow', 'moving', 'Eden', 'Jackson', 'Jay', 'Pickett', 'spent', '8', 'years', 'prison', 'vehicular', 'homicide', 'surprised', 'release', 'everyone', 'else', 'Apparently', 'Oregon', 'release', 'prisoners', 'random', 'home', 'mother', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'still', 'community', 'people', 'who', 'wish', 'Eden', 'would', 'rot', 'prison.Eden', 'symbolic', 'new', 'beginning', 'prison', 'Bible', 'not', 'really', 'faith', 'based', 'film', 'memories', 'fateful', 'night', 'playing', 'local', 'honky-tonk', 'cheating', 'wife', 'Pam', 'Miranda', 'Frigon', 'Pam', 'even', 'not', 'visiting', 'Eden', 'prison', 'marrying', 'Larry', 'Michael', 'Bowen', 'town', 'biggest', 'A-Hole.Larry', 'sheriff', 'Duane', 'Stephens', ""n't"", 'like', 'Eden', 'hanging', 'around', 'partly', 'annoying', 'phrases', 'such', 'what', 'Shelly', 'Victoria', 'Pratt', 'pretty', 'blond', 'who', 'feed', 'store', 'help', 'normally', ""n't"", 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'drama', 'headed', 'Jay', 'Pickett', 'subs', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'twists', 'film', 'unlikely', 'drama', 'redemption.4', 'stars', 'fans', 'Lifetime', 'style', 'films.No', 'f-bombs', 'adult', 'language', 'S-word', 'P-word', 'AH-word', 'SOB', 'implied', 'sex', 'nudity', 'girl', 'bra-Whitnie', 'Mauney', 'Brief', 'appearances', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'dad']",Soda Springs

Eight years after a terrible accident affected a small Idaho town the man responsible returns to start his life over. Almost instantly the town begins to treat him as an outcast and refuses to accept him back to the community. Slowly he begins to win his ex over and secrets start to come out that change the town forever. I have seen a few movies like this (I can't remember the names of them) but it has the feel of a movie like ""Pure Country"". An exiled resident returns to face his past and meets resistance. You have all seen that movie before so you won't be surprised. This movie is pretty cheesy but it is actually not bad and does have a twist at the end that isn't totally predictable but not unexpected. Without trying to spoil the movie I will let you know that Tom Skerritt is in the movie for about 2 minutes, so if that's why your renting it be warned. Overall, not really a whole lot to say about this movie. Cheesy but an OK movie that many will like. I give it a B.",3,It felt like I've seen this movie many times but I still liked it.
