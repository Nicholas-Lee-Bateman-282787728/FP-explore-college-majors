1434980,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B004ZQJ5FQ,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[4, 4]",This is a great Shaun the Sheep DVD as it contains seven episodes full of mischievous fun!  If you have never seen Shaun the Sheep before it is claymation which I like because it is a break from the regular animated cartoons we watch all day long.  This DVD is also something the whole family can enjoy and appreciate.  My boys love the characters and how they get into trouble and my husband and I appreciate the simpleness yet funny story lines!  It is also nice because the characters don't talk (they do make sounds though) so there is no singing or words to pay attention to.  I pop this DVD in and my boys watch it and ask for me over and over!  The sheep all think they are sneaky and can get away with everything but they do make mistakes and work together!,4,Classic Shaun the Sheep fun!,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,765,"['great', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'DVD', 'seven', 'episodes', 'full', 'mischievous', 'fun', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'claymation', 'like', 'break', 'regular', 'animated', 'cartoons', 'watch', 'day', 'long', 'DVD', 'also', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'boys', 'love', 'characters', 'how', 'get', 'trouble', 'husband', 'appreciate', 'simpleness', 'yet', 'funny', 'story', 'lines', 'also', 'nice', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'do', 'make', 'sounds', 'so', 'singing', 'words', 'pay', 'attention', 'pop', 'DVD', 'boys', 'watch', 'ask', 'sheep', 'think', 'are', 'sneaky', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'everything', 'do', 'make', 'mistakes', 'work', 'together']",Shaun the Sheep: Animal Antics
