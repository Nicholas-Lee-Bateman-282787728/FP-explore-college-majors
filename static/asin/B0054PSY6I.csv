The plot was pretty original too. I love the idea of the employee killing off her bosses. The finale is a bit deus ex machina and the scene itself has almost no lighting, but other than that the film has a good mix of comedy and creepiness throughout.",4,Great dark comedy,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,378,"['good', 'example', 'potential', 'dark', 'black', 'comedy', 'actually', 'funny', 'also', 'really', 'twisted', 'moments', 'plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'original', 'too', 'love', 'idea', 'employee', 'killing', 'off', 'bosses', 'finale', 'bit', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'scene', 'almost', 'lighting', 'other', 'film', 'good', 'mix', 'comedy', 'creepiness']",Miss Nobody
1441981,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0054PSY6I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Nobody enjoys a light and frothy comedy about murderous machinations more than I do. And ""Miss Nobody"" is a particularly bubbly addition to the genre. It is about the lightest and breeziest black comedy that you're likely to encounter. And yet, while I enjoyed the film to a large degree, I just wish it contained a few more surprises. Set in the corporate world, the plucky heroine (Leslie Bibb) advances through the ranks through the most unorthodox and unpleasant of means. While her exploits might be fun and amusing, you can't help but feel that you've seen this all before. Not nearly edgy or original enough, though, I'll still recommend the film for fans of the genre for one big reason. Leslie Bibb gives a winning comedic performance that oftentimes seems fresher than the material she's given. Bibb has been kicking around for quite a few years, it's time she got a chance to shine (she takes an executive producer credit here as well).Bibb starts out as a secretary of a major pharmaceutical company. When a junior executive position opens up, she takes a gamble and is awarded the promotion. Before she has a chance to settle in, though, her new post is overtaken by an outside candidate (Brandon Routh) and she is demoted to his assistant. Making the best of the situation, she still sees Routh as a possible romantic interest--but a late night encounter ends in disaster. She is belatedly awarded the original promotion and finds herself entrenched in corporate politics and exceedingly bad behavior. And sometimes you have to get a little blood on your hands to move ahead! To complicate matters, a detective (Adam Goldberg) moves into her mom's boarding housen and her double life risks being exposed by this intriguing new suitor.Everyone here throws themselves into broad comedic performances. Kathy Baker, Viveca Fox, Missi Pyle, David Anthony Higgins and Geoffrey Lewis inhabit other major roles and acquit themselves well. But again, this is Bibb's show first and foremost. She maintains a pleasing aloofness and sweetness amidst the increasing silliness. Everything is brisk and entertaining without breaking much new ground. At times, I wished the picture had taken a harder edge.  With the narrative being so lightweight, the film seems a bit inconsequential. Still enjoyable, if not particularly memorable. About 3 1/2 stars for me, I'll round out due to the charming lead performance.

1441982,AX9C10JD538D9,B0054PSY6I,Liviania,"[1, 2]","Leslie Bibb plays Sarah Jane McKinney, a paper-pushing secretary with a terrible haircut.  When she accidentally kills her boss (Brandon Routh), she finds herself zooming up the corporate ladder.  But if she wants to stay on top she's going to have to kill again.  And again.Despite the premise, Miss Nobody is a frothy confection of a film.  Rarely has murder seemed so light-hearted.  There are a few sequences that veer into satire, but those bits remain quick and shallow.  While I say this, I must admit that there is a delightfully nasty twist at the end.Many parts of Miss Nobody are predictable.  Of course there's a cop boarding in Sarah Jane's house.  Of course they fall in love.  Of course he's assigned the case.  Of course someone knows what Sarah Jane did.  Of course the person tormenting her is pretty obvious.  But Miss Nobody doesn't really intend to surprise you.  It just wants you to laugh.  And I did.The casting is terrific.  I'm always happy to see Missi Pyle (Josie and the Pussycats) and a little bit of Vivica A. Fox (Ugly Betty) never goes amiss.  Bibb may be a blonde bombshell, but she plays mousy and browbeaten pretty well.  It's entertaining to see her body language change as she grows more confident through romance and murder.I don't think I'm going to go out a buy a copy of Miss Nobody - I saw it on satellite - , but I enjoyed finding and watching it.",4,Frothy black comedy,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1391,"['Leslie', 'Bibb', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'McKinney', 'paper-pushing', 'secretary', 'terrible', 'haircut', 'When', 'accidentally', 'boss', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'zooming', 'up', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'stay', 'top', 'going', 'have', 'kill', 'again', 'again.Despite', 'premise', 'Miss', 'Nobody', 'frothy', 'confection', 'film', 'Rarely', 'murder', 'seemed', 'so', 'light-hearted', 'are', 'few', 'sequences', 'veer', 'satire', 'bits', 'remain', 'quick', 'shallow', 'say', 'must', 'admit', 'delightfully', 'nasty', 'twist', 'end.Many', 'parts', 'Miss', 'Nobody', 'are', 'predictable', 'course', 'cop', 'boarding', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'house', 'course', 'fall', 'love', 'course', 'assigned', 'case', 'course', 'someone', 'what', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'did', 'course', 'person', 'tormenting', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Miss', 'Nobody', ""n't"", 'really', 'intend', 'surprise', 'just', 'laugh', 'did.The', 'casting', 'terrific', ""'m"", 'always', 'happy', 'see', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'little', 'bit', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'never', 'amiss', 'Bibb', 'may', 'be', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'mousy', 'browbeaten', 'pretty', 'well', 'entertaining', 'see', 'body', 'language', 'change', 'more', 'confident', 'romance', 'murder.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'copy', 'Miss', 'Nobody', 'saw', 'satellite', 'enjoyed', 'finding', 'watching']",Miss Nobody

She comes off as playing a sexy character but still somewhat awkward at the same time, and she makes it work. The only thing I really ""disliked"" about the movie was the apparently rampant amount of perverts and sexual harrassment at her work, and how everyone was in on some big secret plot.
