I don't need to go into details about the show 'cause other reviewers pretty much covered all the bases; however, there is some tension from others about the price offered. I personally was guided by a couple of reviewers towards DisneyStore.com and the most I paid was $26.40 tax included, at least with ""my"" state tax. But I was tempted to pay the outlandish price, only because had no previous experience dealing with Disney online. But in the spirit of understanding I believe, but could be wrong, that the sellers on Amazon could have only procured their new copies from the same source I did. And how can a business profit if they don't aim higher than what they paid. That aside, if the Amazon sellers soon become the only source for whatever reason than the price will really jump so choose wisely and quickly.

I loved it in my youth and I still love it now. It was a long time waiting for this final installment of the proper series (there was a 3rd season dubbed &#34;The Goliath Chronicles,&#34; but creator Greg Weisman has disowned those episodes.)Firstly it should be noted that these are the episodes only and that's in. There are no special features of any kind. No commentaries, no behind the scenes featurettes, no intros to the episodes, not even animated menus. But given how long fans had to wait for this, most will be plenty pleased with the episodes on their own.The quality of the voice acting, animation and story telling remains intact from the earlier installments. Personally though this is not my favorite block of episodes. Beginning with the &#34;world tour,&#34; much of this collection is about opening up the world of Gargoyles and making it bigger. For me it did that a little too well. The world becomes so big that it makes the gargoyles themselves seem smaller and somehow a little less important or significant versus how it felt in earlier episodes. This is really just a personal preference for the more contained episodes of the first season and first have of Season 2.

1161974,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00198X0YA,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[5, 5]","With no warning and zero fanfare, it would appear that the second half of Gargoyles: Season Two has finally been released on DVD. Hallelujah! Encompassing fifty-two episodes in all,the first half of season twowas released way back in 2005, though its relatively low sales meant that Disney was in no hurry to reward desperate fans with the next half (at least that was their excuse).During its run back in the nineties, ""Gargoyles"" picked up a strong cult following, with viewers attracted to its dark tone, complex story-arcs, three-dimensional characters and strong grasp of continuity. Combining everything from Shakespearean characters to Machiavellian billionaires to Arthurian legend, ""Gargoyles"" was consistently surprising in its depth of plot and maturity of themes.The gist of the premise is that sentient, vaguely humanoid creatures known as gargoyles once lived alongside humans in the distant past. One such clan, which protected a castle in Scotland, were betrayed by the humans they had sworn to protect and frozen in stone by a magic spell. A thousand years later they are reawakened in modern-day New York, bewildered by the new technology and unsure who to trust.Their leader Goliath befriends detective Elisa Maza, who becomes the clan's secret liaison with the outside world, encouraging them to protect the city from its foes. And foes there are plenty, from the rouge gargoyle Demona who plots to eradicate all of humankind, to the billionaire entrepreneur David Xanatos, unceasing in his attempts to accumulate more power and exploit the gargoyles to his own ends.These episodes begin halfway through what fans have nicknamed the ""Avalon World Tour"", in which Goliath, Elisa, Bronx and Goliath's newfound daughter Angela depart the mystical isle of Avalon only to find that the sentient island has other plans for them (this was well beforeLOST, mind you). Instead of returning home to Manhattan, the four of them are transported to various locations around the world, awakening heroes and defending innocents from various threats, collecting hints along the way that a mysterious event known as the Gathering is scheduled to occur on Avalon at some point in the near future.It includes some of my favourite episodes, such as ""The Hound of Ulster"" and ""The Mark of the Panther"", set in Ireland and Nigeria respectively, both with stunning animation and creative use of each country's folklore. As the Avalon World Tour winds up, we're treated to ""Ill Met By Moonlight"" in which Lord Oberon and Queen Titania return to their mystical island to demand the removal of the humans and gargoyles that dwell there. In a bid to allow the clan to stay, Goliath challenges Oberon to a duel across the island's terrain - but they may have unexpected help from his queen.Later, the two-part episode ""The Gathering"" deals with a surprising twist in the Xanatos family. With the birth of his young son, David Xanatos calls on the help of the gargoyles to keep his family safe from the unexpected interest of Lord Oberon. These episodes contain not one but *two* dramatic reveals of characters that have gone about in elaborate disguises and under false identities for some time, providing pay-off to hints and foreshadowing that stretch back as far as the inception of the show.Finally, the magnificent three-part ""Hunter's Moon"" returns to what is perhaps the show's most tragic plot-line: the animosity between gargoyles and humans, as encapsulated in the vendetta that exists between Demona and the Hunters, a family of warriors that devote their lives to hunting her down. With his loved ones caught in the crossfire, Goliath is first desperate to stop the fighting, before he himself is struck with the desire for vengeance. It's beautiful storytelling, with a devastating line delivered at its climax (""what have I... what have *they* done?!"") that will sent long-time viewers into spasms of delight at how poignantly it echoes an identical line said by a completely different character in frighteningly similar circumstances much earlier in the show's run. Like I said, these writers had an impeccable grasp of continuity.Regarding the DVD itself, there is little in the way of extras. The last DVD set contained several fun extras, including introductions to each episode by co-creator Greg Weisman (who still runs a blog that allows fans to ask him questions about the show) though here it's simply the episodes with no extra frills. It's disappointing, but hardly surprising - and after this long, I'm just happy to finally have them on DVD.As it stands, there's still one more season of ""Gargoyles"" to be released after this, though it's considered discontinuity by fans due to its fall in quality and the departure of co-creator Greg Weisman (in his comic book series he ignores all but the first episode of season three and strikes out on his own). So for all intents and purposes, my ""Gargoyles"" DVD collection is complete. It feels great to finally have the whole set - and I can't wait until my nephew is old enough for me to share it with him.Beautiful animation, complex story-lines, lovable characters and talented voice-acting - this is everything I love to watch on television.",5,"""We Are Defenders of the Night...We Are Gargoyles...""",1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,5207,"['warning', 'zero', 'fanfare',
