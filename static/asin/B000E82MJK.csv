Some computer DVD drives can also get around the regional encoding. That said, it's an OK transfer, a little on the choppy side. I don't think anything is really missing except the last two seconds of a scene where Laughton and Zasu Pitts discuss their common fondness for cooking and goldfish. There just seem to be a couple of instances where a scene jumped to the next when it probably should have faded to the next. No big deal. Also, they have removed the nice old Paramount logo from the opening and closing shots.

970138,A6NMUODCMVGS7,B000E82MJK,"A. Gregory ""Andrew Gregory""","[0, 0]","Ruggles of Red Gap is as fresh today as in 1935. A solid example of &#34;Depression Comedy,&#34; a genre that includes such films as My Man Godfrey, but often overlooked. The plot is not set in the 1930's; instead, the story takes place in 1912. However, the message of the film--that in the United States anyone can succeed in spite of their former lives--was/is a reminder to one and all that this aspect of our nation's gifts still exists. By no means is this a smug or pretentious effort. In Leo McCarey's hands, as the film would say of the United States, all things are possible. The high comedy of the picture stems from the interplay of Egbert Froud and his social climbing nouveau  riche wife Effie. Zazu Pitts and Charles Laughton (the former butler Ruggles) also provide gentler comedy than Egbert and Effie, but all characters are endearing and unforgettable. The scene in which Ruggles recites Lincoln's Gettysburg Address could have stopped the film cold in its tracks, but Laughton's eloquent delivery provides the pivotal scene in which the on-screen audience (and the viewing audience) are moved and enriched. At every level, this short film inspires and entertains. Like a George Bernard Shaw play, this is a comedy of ideas.

DeMille told an introductory story about how Charles Laughton before acting worked in the hotel trade and was more interested in the characters that roomed in such establishments than making a pound. Laughton must have learned much for whether he playing understated or over the top roles he had the audience's complete attention. This is the best example of the former for which viewers can be grateful for Laughton makes completely realistic the change that comes about this valet to and earl when he is exposed to American values. Laughton's recitation of The Gettysburg Address is one of those moments in film when the world seems to stand still. That scene was actually the brainchild of director Leo McCarey; it was not in the original Harry Leon Wilson novel or any of the stage and silent screen versions of &#34;Ruggles&#34; before 1935. Also not in the novel but in the movie is the presence of Ma Pettingill, Egbert Floud's supportive mother in law.

A person of importance, however small. A man whose decisions and whose future are in his own hands.""Rarely revived and never on UK TV, Leo McCarey's 1935 version of Ruggles of Red Gap was the third to reach the screen in just 17 years, but it's hard to imagine the other versions topping it. It's not a particularly credible plot, with Charlie Ruggles (not actually playing Ruggles despite the film literally having his name on it) `winning' Charles Laughton's reserved and soft-spoken gentleman's gentleman from Roland Young's vaguely lubricated English aristocrat and taking him out West with him, where his socially ambitious wife Mary Boland hopes he'll have a civilising effect on his wardrobe and manners. Naturally the opposite is the case, with the initially quietly horrified Ruggles the butler finding the Land of Opportunity - and widow Zasu Pitts - much to his liking...The comic misunderstandings and mistaken identity shenanigans are pretty much standard issue and the comedy generally more restrained and understated than expected, yet it's such a charming and delightfully good-natured film it's practically impossible not to embrace it. Ruggles the actor has the down home commonsense speak-yer-mind nature to carry off a part that could potentially be irritating thoroughly likeably, while Laughton's quiet, buttoned down performance is a marvel of understated depth, doing so little yet revealing so much. At heart there's not much to the film, but thanks to the increasingly overlooked Leo McCarey's wonderfully restrained direction it's a very pleasing mixture of the accessible sophistication of Ernst Lubitsch and a rather more unfussy take on the populism of Frank Capra that hits all the right spots without hitting the audience over the head in the process.Eureka's UK Region B-locked Blu-ray and DVD combo does the film justice with a very decent transfer, no fewer than three separate radio adaptations with Ruggles and Laughton, and audio recording of Laughton reciting the Gettysburg Address as per one of the film's most popular scenes (one that would get the film banned in Nazi Germany where the government didn't want any of that created equal guff polluting Aryan minds), and a booklet. There's also an interesting 17-minute interview with Laughton's biographer Simon Callow, who draws interesting parallels with the way the actor's own background in the family's hotel business (where Osbert Sitwell described him as looking ""like an actor playing a waiter"") and hatred of the British class system influenced both his approach to the film and his decision to take American citizenship.",4,An Englishman abroad,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,2756,"['father', 'was', 'gentleman', 'gentleman', 'father', 'heritage', 'service', 'miraculously', 'man', 'person', 'importance', 'however', 'small', 'man', 'decisions', 'future', 'are', 'own', 'hands', 'Rarely', 'revived', 'never', 'UK', 'TV', 'Leo', 'McCarey', '1935', 'version', 'Ruggles', 'Red', 'Gap', 'was', 'third', 'reach', 'screen', 'just', '17', 'years', 'hard', 'imagine', 'other', 'versions', 'topping', 'not', 'particularly', 'credible', 'plot', 'Charlie', 'Ruggles', 'not', 'actually', 'playing', 'Ruggles', 'film', 'literally', 'having', 'name', 'winning', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'reserved', 'soft-spoken', 'gentleman', 'gentleman', 'Roland', 'Young', 'vaguely', 'lubricated', 'English', 'aristocrat', 'taking', 'out', 'West', 'where', 'socially', 'ambitious', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Boland', ""'ll"", 'have', 'civilising', 'effect', 'wardrobe', 'manners', 'Naturally', 'opposite', 'case', 'initially', 'quietly', 'horrified', 'Ruggles', 'butler', 'finding', 'Land', 'Opportunity', 'widow', 'Zasu', 'Pitts', 'much', 'liking', 'comic', 'misunderstandings', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'shenanigans', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'issue', 'comedy', 'generally', 'more', 'restrained', 'understated', 'expected', 'such', 'charming', 'delightfully', 'good-natured', 'film', 'practically', 'impossible', 'not', 'embrace', 'actor', 'down', 'home', 'commonsense', 'speak-yer-mind', 'nature', 'carry', 'off', 'part', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'irritating', 'thoroughly', 'likeably', 'Laughton', 'quiet', 'buttoned', 'down', 'performance', 'marvel', 'understated', 'depth', 'doing', 'so', 'little', 'yet', 'revealing', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'not', 'much', 'film', 'thanks', 'increasingly', 'overlooked', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'wonderfully', 'restrained', 'direction', 'very', 'pleasing', 'mixture', 'accessible', 'sophistication', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'rather', 'more', 'unfussy', 'take', 'populism', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'right', 'spots', 'hitting', 'audience', 'head', 'process.Eureka', 'UK', 'Region', 'B-locked', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'combo', 'film', 'justice', 'very', 'decent', 'transfer', 'fewer', 'three', 'separate', 'radio', 'adaptations', 'Ruggles', 'Laughton', 'audio', 'recording', 'Laughton', 'reciting', 'Gettysburg', 'Address', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'popular', 'scenes', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'film', 'banned', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'where', 'government', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'created', 'equal', 'guff', 'polluting', 'Aryan', 'minds', 'booklet', 'also', 'interesting', '17-minute', 'interview', 'Laughton', 'biographer', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'who', 'interesting', 'parallels', 'way', 'actor', 'own', 'background', 'family', 'hotel', 'business', 'where', 'Osbert', 'Sitwell', 'described', 'looking', 'actor', 'playing', 'waiter', 'hatred', 'British', 'class', 'system', 'influenced', 'approach', 'film', 'decision', 'take', 'American', 'citizenship']",N/A

Having overseen the best Laurel and Hardy shorts (where the dictionary definition of the ""slow burn"" is perfectly illustrated), he went on to direct Harold Lloyd in his best talkie (THE MILKY WAY)  and the Marx Brothers in their best and most subversive film, DUCK SOUP.  Although, at first blush, RUGGLES OF RED GAP is a picture of unmitigated American chauvinism, it is, on subsequent viewings, a film with undertones at least as subversive as that of DUCK SOUP.The plot is simple: in 1908, an English valet, Ruggles (Charles Laughton) is the stake in an ill-advised poker game between his master, a down-at-heels Earl, becoming the servant of a cartoonishly vulgar American (Charles Ruggles) from Red Gap, Washington.  In America, Ruggles becomes, through inaccurate press reportage, ""a personage,"" and for the first time in his life he realizes he is not merely ""a gentleman's gentleman,"" but an actual man, able to ""stand on his own two feet.""  Along the way, a burgeoning class system within America's nouveau riche is exposed, along with the ignorance most Americans carry with regard to the founding principles that made their nation a great democracy in the first place.What is so enjoyable about this movie is watching the gradations of Laughton's performance as he slowly accepts the process of democratization.  Laughton, as Marmaduke Ruggles, elevates the ""slow burn""--in which the audience is in on a cataclysmic piece of news, and is eagerly anticipating the comic reaction--to Tantric longevity in his priceless facial reactions to his changing environment.  Mary Boland, as Effie Floud, provides some of the most hilarious Franglais this side of Punch Magazine, and Roland Young, as the Earl, mutters some of the most delicious innuendo ever heard during the years of the Hays Production Code.This Region 5 (Taiwan) DVD is currently the only available form available in a digital format.
