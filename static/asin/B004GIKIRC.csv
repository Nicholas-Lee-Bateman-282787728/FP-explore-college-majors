1406957,A57JWK56OUKLZ,B004GIKIRC,Amber,"[4, 6]","I watched the first season of Sister Wives which was full of all the drama of a new wife coming in, so yes, that season may have had more action than this one, but lack of action doesn't make this one any less interesting. There is something about watching a lifestyle so very different than most, that keeps a viewer captivated. This season is more about day to day life, though it does include the threat of the authorities since the Browns ""came out"". My biggest complaint, I guess, is that all of us non-polygamist have no idea what plural marriage is supposed to achieve. Kody and his wives talk about ""the faith"", but that's simply how it's addressed and never delved into. I think there are probably a lot of viewers out there like me that would like to know a little more. One of the wives, Janelle, talked her mom into polygamy years ago, and she married Kody's dad, so she is a sister wife to Kody's mom. Big question: WHY? Other than that,  interesting show!",4,What can I say?

1406960,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B004GIKIRC,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[17, 25]","Somehow I never expected to be bored witless by a reality show about a polygamous family. But sadly, that is exactly what happened in ""Sister Wives Season 2 - Volume 1,"" which is basically all about the Brown family ""coming out"" as polygamists, and their day-to-day lives. Sadly, without the tension of a forthcoming new wife, their day-to-day life is devastatingly boring -- we have an entire episode devoted to a COLONOSCOPY.The season opens with Kody, Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn all going to New York, and officially coming out as polygamists on a news show. Unsurprisingly, having a reality show about polygamy attracts the paparazzi, who start lurking around their home and watching their kids.And even though it's common knowledge that polygamy is illegal, and they have mentioned many times how they had to ""hide"" it in the past, they are simply SHOCKED when the state starts investigating them because they revealed it ON TV! I can't tell whether the Browns are depicting themselves as naive or stupid, because it honestly sounds like they're going for both. Yes, polygamy is illegal, you knew that, so why is it shocking when the government investigates you?While all this is going on, the Browns also continue their everyday life, and take a vacation to Montana, where Kody's family owns a ranch. After some car woes, they make it there in time to deal with horses, cookouts, and painting. We also encounter Kody's father, who is also a polygamist: he's married to Kody's mom... AND Janelle's mom. Wow. So Kody is his own stepbrother-in-law. Ew.Unfortunately, the rest of the half-season isn't NEARLY as interesting. Janelle and Kody go on a private camping trip while Robyn whines about finances, the family goes trick-or-treating and selects Halloween pumpkins, some of the family heads to Vegas for some fun, the Browns throw a dinner party for some of their non-polygamous friends, and Meri goes in for a colonoscopy to check for polyps.One of the main reasons people tuned in to the first season of ""Sister Wives"" was because of the underlying tension in the five-way relationship. That tension is completely gone now. Instead the Browns whine occasionally about how the Mean Ol' State is investigating them, and how the paparazzi are following them. Apparently they thought that a REALITY SHOW about polygamy would attract ratings, but no other attention.And honestly, it's boring. Really boring. The Browns may have a happy, normal day-to-day life, but ""happy"" and ""normal"" do not equal good television -- it's like watching somebody's home movies that somehow ended up on TV. Face-painting, buying in bulk, setting up tents and getting colonoscopies are not exactly the stuff of riveting television, and that is all basically ALL this half-season is about.And while Robyn informs us that polygamy ""isn't all about child brides,"" I was left wishing that the Browns would actually address that real-life problem. It would be more interesting than watching Kody spray-paint his hair.As for the family itself, Kody is still a rather spoiled child-man who doesn't seem to realize how tight the family finances are. Robyn is still neurotic and weepy, while Janelle, Christine and Meri form the actual center of the family. But the occasional touching moment -- such as the adults contemplating how Meri's almost-grown daughter would be cared for if she died -- really doesn't overcome the boredom.Apparently Discovery thinks that polygamists doing ANYTHING makes for riveting TV, and the result is ""Sister Wives Season 2 - Volume 1.""

1406967,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004GIKIRC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 12]","In a bold programming stroke, TLC flouted convention and dropped ""Sister Wives"" onto its 2010 TV schedule. A reality TV show in which the subject matter is considered both taboo and illegal is a daring bit of maneuvering that might have garnered TLC more press than actual viewers though. In truth, I don't watch many of these types of reality show--but I suspect people tune in because they identify with the participants or because the antics are so outrageous, they can't wait to see what happens next. As an avid fan of ""Big Love"" (who despite a rocky last season is TV's most consistently underrated drama) and Brady Udall's ""The Lonely Polygamist"" (one of my top five books of 2010), I threw caution to the wind with ""Sister Wives."" It might be interesting to note, at this juncture, that this TV show did open up a Utah legal investigation into the Kody Brown clan and they have subsequently relocated to an unspecified domicile in Nevada. Such is the price of fame and publicity to launch Season Two!I suppose the primary goal of ""Sister Wives"" is to show that polygamists lead lives much like you or I. The show is structured around Kody Brown and his three families that live under one roof. However, much of the season's dramatic arc comes from Kody courting and marrying a fourth wife. While I found the whole situation slightly distasteful and I didn't particularly like Kody, I'm going to be very politically correct and try to evaluate the merits of the show on their own rights. However, if you don't care for Kody or his wives, let's just say that there are really no more merits. What is lacking from ""Sister Wives"" is any sort of narrative drive--nothing ever really happens. Heck, if the wedding wasn't part of the deal, I fear we would have been hopelessly stranded in inertia. The interchangeable interview scenes are so incredibly repetitive--we get it already! So intent on being absolutely normal and palatable to a mass audience, the show loses any sense of real life.The most real moments in ""Sister Wives"" come from Wife #2 Janelle and Wife #3 Christine. Wife #1 Meri has a lot going on in her thoughts, but is fairly careful about what she allows to make it onto TV. Wife #4 Robyn is sweet enough in a brainwashed kind of way. Christine is easily the most opinionated of the wives. She has structured this existence to her specifications (she only wanted to be a third wife), so an introduction of a new sister wife does elicit some hostility and jealousy--however rationalized these emotions are in interview segments. And then we've got Janelle, who works full time outside of the home, and misses out on many reindeer games. What is fascinating about Janelle's home is that her teenage son is left to raise her brood of kids. All the women proclaim how they are mothers to all the children, it just struck me as oddly cruel to have this boy sacrifice his youth when so many ""parents"" were present.Ultimately, though, whether you like Kody and clan or not--the show suffers in lack of real content. I came in with a high degree of curiosity, but any episode is pretty interchangeable to any other episode. If they all insist they're happy--that's fine, I'll believe them. But how many times do I have to be told that in the course of the 7 episodes (and a Honeymoon special)? I may be completely wrong and you may love the Brown family, I just found it too mundane to qualify for entertainment. My suggestion would be to watch one episode elsewhere before investing in the DVD season! That way you know how much further you'd like to go with ""Sister Wives.""

The only flaw I see is the repeating of so much of the same material over and over again.  Several scenes are replayed way too frequently.  But, not bad over all.",3,Interesting to see how plural marriage works,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,296,"['have', 'always', 'wondered', 'how', 'wives', 'feel', 'plural', 'marriage', 'series', 'be', 'honest', 'open', 'delving', 'too', 'deep', 'only', 'flaw', 'see', 'repeating', 'so', 'much', 'same', 'material', 'over', 'again', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'replayed', 'way', 'too', 'frequently', 'not', 'bad']",N/A

Actually I had seen most of the episodes when they were first aired on TLC but watched it again to try to unravel the mystery:  how three - now four - women could stand being around and love a man who loved other women.  Kody says at the beginning, &#34;Love should be multiplied, not divided&#34;.  Interesting quote from a man who divides his love amongst four women because let's face it, Kody:  there's only so much of you to go around and every one of your wives wants to spend more time with you.  You're basically a sperm donor and the women whom you impregnate end up raising the children.  Your entire focus is on your wives and at least from what one can tell from the series, you engage little with your own children.  I love it when Madison, Janelle's daughter, says she'd scratch out the eyes of another woman who wanted to marry her husband.  Way to go, Madison!  But season 2 is a lot about migration as the Browns eventually head for Vegas.  I still to this day don't understand why the Browns went public but they did so consequences ensue.  It's like they forgot bigamy was outlawed in Utah.  I did give it four stars because I like the women.  They irritate me with their rationalizations about this 'lifestyle' but one can see that they (especially Janelle) are bright, intelligent, lovable women who are very good moms and just plain good people.",4,Polygamy at its best,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,1414,"['Now', 'how', 'world', 'would', 'ever', 'know', 'Actually', 'had', 'seen', 'most', 'episodes', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'aired', 'TLC', 'watched', 'again', 'try', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'how', 'three', 'now', 'four', 'women', 'could', 'stand', 'being', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'other', 'women', 'Kody', 'beginning', '34', 'Love', 'should', 'be', 'multiplied', 'not', 'divided', '34', 'Interesting', 'quote', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'amongst', 'four', 'women', 'let', 'face', 'Kody', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'go', 'around', 'one', 'wives', 'spend', 'more', 'time', ""'re"", 'basically', 'sperm', 'donor', 'women', 'whom', 'impregnate', 'end', 'up', 'raising', 'children', 'entire', 'focus', 'wives', 'least', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'series', 'engage', 'little', 'own', 'children', 'love', 'when', 'Madison', 'Janelle', 'daughter', ""'d"", 'scratch', 'out', 'eyes', 'woman', 'who', 'wanted', 'marry', 'husband', 'Way', 'go', 'Madison', 'season', '2', 'lot', 'about', 'migration', 'Browns', 'eventually', 'head', 'Vegas', 'still', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Browns', 'went', 'public', 'did', 'so', 'consequences', 'ensue', 'forgot', 'bigamy', 'was', 'outlawed', 'Utah', 'did', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'like', 'women', 'irritate', 'rationalizations', ""'lifestyle"", 'one', 'can', 'see', 'especially', 'Janelle', 'are', 'bright', 'intelligent', 'lovable', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'moms', 'just', 'plain', 'good', 'people']",N/A
