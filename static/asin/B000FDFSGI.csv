988488,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FDFSGI,A Customer,"[9, 12]","The oddly titled Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School is indeed a strange film which sometimes works and at other times doesn't. The film has an old fashioned sensibility, which is nice, but it also suffers from an overstuffed narrative featuring three different time frames. Not only do the events occur non-simultaneously, they also transpire at different paces, and the overall effect is a bit at odds with what the movie is trying to say.The film, however, is largely entertaining, probably because director Randall Miller has managed to bring together a fine ensemble cast of top-notch actors to see his story through. Part fairy tale and part homage to the innocence of youth, the Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School revolves around the character of Frank Keane (Robert Carlyle), a working class baker, and a lost soul going through life on automatic pilot.Frank is consumed by his wife's unexplained suicide; his closet is still full of her clothes, and he greets her ashes every morning, and attends meetings for men who have also lost their wives and are finding it hard to cope.  Life is pretty awful at the moment, until one day on a delivery he stops beside a car accident. The man inside, Steve Mills (John Goodman), is crushed behind the wheel. To keep him alive, the normally shy Frank gets him to talk about his life.Apparently Steve was on his way to a rendezvous with Lisa, his childhood girlfriend, whom he hasn't seen in 40 years but has sworn to meet at the titular school, where they first met as kids, on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium. As Frank frantically tries to keep Steve alive, the story jumps to Steve's childhood, where he first went to the school and actually met Lisa.Meanwhile, Steve is desperate for Frank to keep his appointment for him and asks him to go to the school to meet his girlfriend Lisa in his place, and because Frank is such a nice guy he does just this. He can't find her, but he stays for class anyway and the magic of dance as dispensed by Marienne Hotchkiss (Mary Steenburgen), starts to take effect. With her mother Marylyn long dead, Marienne runs the class with a type of authoritarian glamour.Frank eventually falls under the spell of dance releasing his deepest hidden feelings and coloring his life magenta. With the help of Meredith (Marisa Tomei) he's able to move on from his dead wife and hopefully find new love. There's no doubt that Marylyn Hotchkiss is entertaining for most of it's length, but it's also strange and off-beat and often verges on archness, as though it's trying too hard to press the point about moving on from one's disappointments.There's also very little actual instruction at the dance studio, and it's as though Marienne is more concerned with getting her students to connect and learn the delicate art of manners - I guess that's the point. I'm also not sure whether Robert Carlyle was the right choice to play Frank. Carlyle is clearly a talented actor and continues to display both range and presence, but in this case it probably would have been more effective to have an American actor playing the part.Whatever the case, the supporting players are well cast including Donnie Wahlberg Ernie Hudson, Miguel Sandoval, David Paymer, Sean Astin, Sonia Braga, Adam Arkin, and a short appearance by Camryn Manheim. Naturally, there are some bumps on the road to love and learning to move on, but for the most part the movie is pretty predicable and is laden with a heavy dose of syrup. Most viewers will want to see it through, just to find out what happened to Lisa.

The name absolutely shrieks out the warning, ""CHICK FLICK!"" If you're like me and thought that, you'd be wrong.This is an insightful tale of personal choices and how the choices we make effect the path we travel in life. Frank Keane (Robert Carlyle), recently widowed, is driving his bakery truck along a deserted stretch of highway when he comes upon the scene of a horrible accident. He calls 911 and is told to keep the injured motorist talking until they arrive. The name of the injured driver is Steve Mills (John Goodman) who was rushing to an important appointment made thirty-five years ago with his grammar school sweetheart. They had both vowed to meet on the 5th day of the 5th month of the new millenium at Marilyn Hotchkiss' Charm School. When Steve finally realizes he'll never be able to keep his promise he asks Frank to keep the appointment for him. Frank honors Steve's last request and in doing so changes the course of his life forever.On the outside we discover a sweet, nostalgic, disarming film, funny at times, poignant and bittersweet at others. However on a deeper level we discover the storyline serves as a metaphor of spiritual awakening. The ballroom is the world and the coming together to dance is how one chooses or refuses to embrace life. As Miss Hotchkiss says, ""Dance is a very powerful drug.""The cast is terrific, especially Robert Carlyle, Marisa Tomei, Donnie Wahlberg and John Goodman.OK, maybe it's kind of a chick flick.

However, the movie (for me) was just okay - slow and odd. The trailer on IMDB.com made it seem livelier then what it really is. If you still want to see this movie after reading the reviews on Amazon, rent it or wait until it hits $5.00. I made it through the 103 minutes by walking on my treadmill, but I won't ever watch it again, so it will go in my give-away pile. I don't know if the DVD has any extras because I was too bored to look once the movie ended. This DVD was bought on Amazon for $7.05, from 'One Stop Media Shop' and was suppose to be new. It did play all the way through without a problem, however, I don't believe it was actually 'new' - the disc was too smudged to be new and the case had been resealed with shrink-wrapped.

988495,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000FDFSGI,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 13]","Writer-director Randall Miller tries far too hard to make a multi-layered film about spiritual reawakening that he defaults into either formula or incoherence to move his low-budget movie along. With its unwieldy title signaling its contrivance, the 2006 dramedy, co-written by Miller and his wife Jody Savin, is an oddly unsatisfying film that attempts to track three different timelines through jumpy edits and differing film stock. Filmed in irritating bleached tones, the first storyline focuses on Frank Keane, an Irishman who moved his family's baking business to California. Shell-shocked from his wife's recent suicide, he comes upon a road accident which has left the driver badly hurt and pinned inside his car. The victim is Steve Mills, an overweight, seemingly gregarious man who was rushing to meet Linda, his childhood crush from forty years earlier, in the place where they last saw each other.This kick-starts the second storyline, which flashes back to Steve's pre-adolescence when he accidentally gave Linda a black eye during a rough game of British Bulldog. With heavy echoes of ""The Wonder Years"", this portion of the movie is actually footage from Miller's 1990 short with the same title. It shows Steve and Linda first dancing at the Marilyn Hotchkiss ballroom. With Steve sharing his memories with Frank and Frank attempting to keep Steve conscious on the way to the hospital, we are given the third storyline which takes place again in the Marilyn Hotchkiss ballroom, this time in the present day. This time, in Steve's place, Frank shows up for dance class trying to find the now adult Linda amid a gallery of eccentric characters learning to dance under the tutelage of the late Marilyn's daughter, Marienne. Even more characters are introduced by way of Frank's therapy support group of recently widowed men.The cumulative result is a hodgepodge of artificial moments that feed into Miller's overriding theme of getting on with one's life in spite of the barriers one faces. For such a potentially strong ensemble, the performances are variable though mainly because most of the actors are not given enough screen time to flesh out their stereotypical characters. With his mangy-looking hair and sad eyes, Robert Carlyle does well enough as Frank, though his zombie-like behavior at the outset is enough to unsettle anyone. John Goodman plays Steve as the accident victim, though the combination of his bulky, uncomfortable-looking frame and his wheezing delivery is hard to watch for an extended period. Marisa Tomei affectingly portrays Frank's new love interest, Meredith, who holds a secret and has an intractable link to her constant dance partner, Randall, played convincingly by Donnie Wahlberg as an egocentric bully who feels he owns the dance floor.Others are simply wasted in smaller roles - an affected Mary Steenburgen as the prim Marienne who demands order and courtesy in her late mother's dance hall; Sonia Braga as a flirtatious dancer; and as members of Frank's support group, Sean Astin, Adam Arkin, David Paymer and Ernie Hudson. The ending contains something of a twist, and Camryn Manheim and Danny DeVito show up late in the film in intriguing cameos. But by that point, it all comes too late due to the overlapping storylines and sluggish pacing. The DVD has rather perfunctory commentary from Miller, Savin and actor Elden Hensen, who plays both Frank's bakery co-worker in the modern sequences and Sam in the vintage flashbacks filmed in 1990 when he was thirteen. The other significant extra is the original 1990 short with William Hurt providing the memory flashback voiceover as the adult Sam. The package strangely does not make clear that this is the inspiration for the later film, so it seems like a patched-together version of the flashback scenes.",2,An Unfortunate Title for an Unfortunate Film Ostensibly About Spiritual Reawakening,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,3811,"['Writer-director', 'Randall', 'Miller', 'far', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'multi-layered', 'film', 'spiritual', 'reawakening', 'formula', 'incoherence', 'move', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'unwieldy', 'title', 'signaling', 'contrivance', '2006', 'dramedy', 'co-written', 'Miller', 'wife', 'Jody', 'Savin', 'oddly', 'unsatisfying', 'film', 'track', 'three', 'different', 'timelines', 'jumpy', 'edits', 'differing', 'film', 'stock', 'Filmed', 'irritating', 'bleached', 'tones', 'first', 'storyline', 'Frank', 'Keane', 'Irishman', 'who', 'moved', 'family', 'baking', 'business', 'California', 'Shell-shocked', 'wife', 'recent', 'suicide', 'road', 'accident', 'left', 'driver', 'badly', 'hurt', 'pinned', 'car', 'victim', 'Steve', 'Mills', 'overweight', 'seemingly', 'gregarious', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'rushing', 'meet', 'Linda', 'childhood', 'crush', 'forty', 'years', 'earlier', 'place', 'where', 'last', 'saw', 'other.This', 'second', 'storyline', 'back', 'Steve', 'pre-adolescence', 'when', 'accidentally', 'gave', 'Linda', 'black', 'eye', 'rough', 'game', 'British', 'Bulldog', 'heavy', 'echoes', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'portion', 'movie', 'actually', 'footage', 'Miller', '1990', 'short', 'same', 'title', 'Steve', 'Linda', 'first', 'dancing', 'Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'ballroom', 'Steve', 'sharing', 'memories', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'attempting', 'keep', 'Steve', 'conscious', 'way', 'hospital', 'are', 'given', 'third', 'storyline', 'place', 'again', 'Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'ballroom', 'time', 'present', 'day', 'time', 'Steve', 'place', 'Frank', 'up', 'dance', 'class', 'trying', 'find', 'now', 'Linda', 'gallery', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'learning', 'dance', 'tutelage', 'late', 'Marilyn', 'daughter', 'Marienne', 'Even', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'way', 'Frank', 'therapy', 'support', 'group', 'recently', 'widowed', 'men.The', 'cumulative', 'result', 'hodgepodge', 'artificial', 'moments', 'feed', 'Miller', 'overriding', 'theme', 'getting', 'one', 'life', 'spite', 'barriers', 'one', 'such', 'potentially', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'performances', 'are', 'variable', 'mainly', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'mangy-looking', 'hair', 'sad', 'eyes', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'well', 'enough', 'Frank', 'zombie-like', 'behavior', 'outset', 'enough', 'unsettle', 'anyone', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Steve', 'accident', 'victim', 'combination', 'bulky', 'uncomfortable-looking', 'frame', 'wheezing', 'delivery', 'hard', 'watch', 'extended', 'period', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'affectingly', 'Frank', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Meredith', 'who', 'secret', 'intractable', 'link', 'constant', 'dance', 'partner', 'Randall', 'played', 'convincingly', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'egocentric', 'bully', 'who', 'dance', 'floor.Others', 'are', 'simply', 'wasted', 'smaller', 'roles', 'affected', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'prim', 'Marienne', 'who', 'order', 'courtesy', 'late', 'mother', 'dance', 'hall', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'flirtatious', 'dancer', 'members', 'Frank', 'support', 'group', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'David', 'Paymer', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'ending', 'contains', 'something', 'twist', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'show', 'up', 'late', 'film', 'intriguing', 'cameos', 'point', 'too', 'late', 'due', 'overlapping', 'storylines', 'sluggish', 'pacing', 'DVD', 'rather', 'perfunctory', 'commentary', 'Miller', 'Savin', 'actor', 'Elden', 'Hensen', 'who', 'Frank', 'bakery', 'co-worker', 'modern', 'sequences', 'Sam', 'vintage', 'flashbacks', 'filmed', '1990', 'when', 'was', 'thirteen', 'other', 'significant', 'extra', 'original', '1990', 'short', 'William', 'Hurt', 'providing', 'memory', 'flashback', 'voiceover', 'adult', 'Sam', 'package', 'strangely', 'not', 'make', 'clear', 'inspiration', 'later', 'film', 'patched-together', 'version', 'flashback', 'scenes']",N/A

988500,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FDFSGI,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Whatever the impetus for writer/director Randall Miller to recreate his 1990 film on the same subject, this little low budget film has the sense of commitment and love on the part of everyone associated with it.  Be warned that this is a hanky film and that if you don't have a tolerance (or a fondness) for tearjerkers, then best avoid this one.  But for those who enjoy a look at the changes that loss and discovery and love can impact a disparate group of characters' lives, this is a sweet little movie.The basic premise is how caring for others can positively affect one's own worldview.  Frank Keane (Robert Carlyle) is a baker in a family shop, a quiet man who is trying to recover from his wife's unexplained suicide and for consolation he is in group therapy with other grieving men (David Paymer is the leader of a group that includes Sean Astin, Adam Arkin, Ernie Hudson, Miguel Sandoval).  On a routine delivery run, Frank witness a car crash in which Steve Mills (John Goodman) is critically injured.  Feeling helpless, Frank calls the paramedics who respond and tell him to keep Steve talking.  And talk Steve does, pleading with Frank to go to a ballroom dance session to which he promised a young girl he would attend 40 years ago when a child.  Frank does attend Marilyn Hotchkiss (Patricia Fraser) Ballroom Dancing and Charm School, feels out of place at first, but gradually warms to the message of now-owner Marienne Hotchkiss (Mary Steenburgen), meets an abused Meredith (Marisa Tomei), her abuser Randall Ipswich (Donnie Wahlberg), and fellow dancers including Sonja Braga et al.  Through the miracle of dance (and through a lot of flashbacks from car accident to Steve's childhood, etc) conflicts resolve.  The ending is cluttered by events unnecessary to the story but seemingly inserted to make use of the talents of Danny DeVito and Camryn Manheim.  But by the time this fluff is added we have already been enchanted with the bumpy road tale and can forgive about anything.This little unpretentious movie has an endearing style and is populated with some superb actors who seem committed to the project.  Many of the 'little things' (Hotchkiss' gradual variation in costume, the DJ ""Freeway"" (uncredited), and the quality of outside vs interior photography) come to mind in retrospect and make the memory of this evening of borderline saccharine story even more of a treasure.

Sonja Braga, Danny Devito play minor roles but significant, nonetheless.All characters are well rounded and integral in the entire ""choreography"" of the story.  The script never falters.

The plot and subplots are weaved so meticulously together that the actors are really allowed to bring these characters to life.  You can clearly witness their transformation without huge monologues and grand announcements.This film is  refreshing for its lack of contriteness, action scenes and gratuitous flashes of skin.

It seems real enough that they feel like it is talking directly to them personally, and yet it is unreal enough to create in them a wide range of intense emotional reactions within a relatively short time. The vast majority of reviews here prove that the formula works like a charm for a lot of people. If you are one of them, you will love this movie as much as those reviewers did.

To me it rings as false as a three dollar bill. The culprit is the screenplay, which goes for the emotional jugular in every scene, making every word, every action by every actor so fraught with emotion that I begin to feel suffocated. The result for me is an experience that is neither believable - at all - nor moving in any positive or pleasurable way. It leaves me feeling manipulated and cheated. A lot of great acting talent was squandered on this tripe.I do not mean to offend those who love this movie but to caution those who - like me - do not react well to emotional manipulation.

Wow. A tragic story of characters who ache and struggle and dream, it nearly broke my heart with the melancholy hopefulness. There are moments of sheer joy and humor which keep the film from becoming unbearable. John Goodman excels in this piece, but I can't stop there. Each character is three dimensional, no matter how small the role.The general storyline involves Frank who is shuffling through life under a huge black cloud of depression. He witnesses a tragic accident and because he is human, he does the noble thing by stopping and staying with the lone occupant of the car while waiting for help. A story is told and unfolds throughout the entire movie. A story that is haunting and achingly beautiful.

Keane goes to the Charm School to meet the girl that Mills had promised to meet. Once he arrives there, Keane is introduced to the ""lonely hearts"" of the Ballroom Dancing set.But as dance once unlocked the world of sexual awakening, now too does the ""powerful drug"" of the merengue, the Lindy Hop and the box-step reopen long closed doors to life and love.This film could still use a little more polish in the blending seamlessly of the two narratives,but for that fault only, this is a beautifully rendered look at how people allow innocence to slip away and to let ""guilt,a worthless emotion"" to take its place.There is a world of things to think about in this sweet piece of a film that is full of sincerity and honest emotion.The DVD contains both the widescreen and standard screen presentation, as well as a marvelous commentary AND the original 1990 short film.This is a film that is highly original and gets all the more ""charming"" each time you step up to the line and extend your hand and utter, ""May I have this dance?.4 and 15/16 stars****+",4,"THERAPYDANCE: ""He thinks he's Michael Flatley!""",1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,3610,"['Dance', 'very', 'powerful', 'drug', 'Miss', 'Marienne', 'Hotchkiss', 'embraced', 'can', 'exorcise', 'demos', 'access', 'deep-seated', 'emotion', 'color', 'life', 'joyous', 'shades', 'brilliant', 'magenta', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'Miss', 'Hotchkiss', 'one', 'must', 'shoulder', 'challenges', 'intrepid', 'countenance', 'one', 'reap', 'rewards.Are', 'MISS', 'HOTCHKISS', 'BALLROOM', 'DANCING', 'AND', 'CHARM', 'SCHOOL', 'most', 'unusual', 'look', 'guilt', 'worthless', 'emotion', 'breaking', 'free', 'perceived', 'nostalgic', 'memories', 'past', 'order', 'move', 'forward', 'life.For', 'many', 'life', 'stops', 'when', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'regret', 'when', 'choose', 'left', 'path', 'instead', 'right', 'path', 'may', 'lead', 'years', 'emptiness', 'loneliness', 'regret', 'where', 'fail', 'connect', 'human', 'being.For', 'folks', 'unconventional', 'look', 'locked', 'away', 'emotion', 'life', 'chance', 'start', 'anew', 'learned-by-wrote', 'introduction', 'May', 'have', 'dance', 'Miss', 'appropriate', 'response', ""'d"", 'be', 'enchanted', 'Sir', '.MARILYN', 'HOTCHKISS', 'charming', 'heart-wrenching', 'look', '1960', 'charm', 'school', 'was', 'teach', 'children', 'first', 'proper', 'introduction', 'world', 'etiquette', 'social', 'interaction.What', 'particularly', 'unique', 'present', '2006', 'arthouse', 'release', 'expanded', 'version', '1990', 'short', 'film', 'same', 'original', 'short', 'focused', 'pre-pubescent', 'look', 'girl/boy-love/hate', 'angst', 'present', 'rendering', 'adult', 'situation', 'same', 'angst', '40', 'years', 'later.Largely', 'accomplished', 'great', 'success', 'actors', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Marissa', 'Tomei', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'bring', 'life', 'fortysomething', 'crowd', 'who', 'just', 'children', 'needed', 'Miss', 'Hotchkiss', 'initial', 'prodding', 'life', 'love', 'so', 'middle-agers', 'stuck', 'crossroads', 'regret', 'emptiness', 'still', 'need', 'first', 'introduction', 'May', 'have', 'Yes', 'would', '.The', 'new', 'story', 'built', 'collision', 'Frank', 'Keane', 'widowed', 'son', 'son', 'son', 'baker', 'Carlyle', 'THE', 'FULL', 'MONTY', 'enroute', 'delivering', 'bread.Keane', 'become', 'regret-filled', 'shadow', 'himself.Meeting', 'Steve', 'Mills', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'nearly', 'cut', 'two', 'single', 'car', 'wreck', 'Keane', 'must', 'keep', 'Mills', 'going', 'shock', 'keeping', 'talking.Mills', 'was', 'way', 'keep', 'standing', '40-year', 'appointment', 'Miss', 'Hotchkiss', 'Charm', 'School', 'so', 'story', 'past', 'original', '1990', 'short', 'great', 'lasting', 'implications', 'Keane', 'life.Through', 'encounter', 'Keane', 'Charm', 'School', 'meet', 'girl', 'Mills', 'had', 'promised', 'meet', 'Once', 'there', 'Keane', 'introduced', 'lonely', 'hearts', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'set.But', 'dance', 'once', 'unlocked', 'world', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'now', 'too', 'powerful', 'drug', 'merengue', 'Lindy', 'Hop', 'box-step', 'reopen', 'long', 'closed', 'doors', 'life', 'love.This', 'film', 'could', 'still', 'use', 'little', 'more', 'polish', 'blending', 'seamlessly', 'two', 'narratives', 'fault', 'only', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'look', 'how', 'people', 'allow', 'innocence', 'slip', 'away', 'let', 'guilt', 'worthless', 'emotion', 'take', 'place.There', 'world', 'things', 'think', 'sweet', 'piece', 'film', 'full', 'sincerity', 'honest', 'emotion.The', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'standard', 'screen', 'presentation', 'as', 'well', 'marvelous', 'commentary', 'original', '1990', 'short', 'film.This', 'film', 'highly', 'original', 'more', 'charming', 'time', 'step', 'up', 'line', 'extend', 'hand', 'utter', 'May', 'have', 'dance', '.4', '15/16', 'stars****+']",N/A

988509,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FDFSGI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","In 1990, after having directed the ""Melissa and Men"" episode of ""thirtysomething,"" Randall Miller wrote and directed a 30-minute film entitled ""Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School.""  Narrated by William Hurt as the adult Steve Mills, it tells the story of when he was a kid (played by Elden Henson) and was forced by his mother to take lessons in ballroom dancing (and charm) from Marilyn Hotchiss (Patricia Fraser).  The Friday night event is complicated by the fact that during a game of British Bulldog, Steve's elbow connected with the eye of young Lisa Gober (Kelley Parker).  Steve wants to be cool, just like his friend Kenny Dulin (Joshua Horowitz), but he also wants to apologize to Lisa because he is clearly growing up and you know what that means.  The entire short film version of the original ""Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School"" is included on this DVD, as a bonus feature to the main film, Miller's 2005 film of the same name.I do not recommend that you watch the original before this new version, but I would not dissuade you from doing so either.  It is just that there have been many times in recent years that I have seen a short film turned by the director into a longer film.  But this is the first time I have seen a director incorporate most of his original film into a longer version, which does not seek to retell the story, but to use it as a look at the past that sets up the events of the present.  Steve Mills has grown up and is now played by John Goodman, who also assumes the film's narrator duties.  After passing a bakery truck driven by Frank Keane (Robert Carlyle) on a mountain highway, Mills has a car accident.  Keane stops to help and having been told by the 911 dispatcher to keep Mills talking, begins to learn of the events of the past.Keane learns something else.  Mills is on his way to an appointment of long standing with Lisa Gober.  In point of fact a reunion to take place no matter what on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium.  Because of the circumstances, Mills asks Keane to keep the appointment for him.  So Frank arrives at the right place, where ""Thursday Nights with Marilyn Hotchkiss"" are now hosted (with our permission and by the grace of God) by her daughter Marienne (Mary Steenburgen).  Now all he has to do is meet Lisa and tell her what has happened.  But of course Frank gets much more than he bargained for when he steps out on the dance floor with Marienne for a try at the Lindy Hop.The story proceeds with parallel narratives.  In the present, Frank alternates attending Thursday night dance lessons with his weekly group therapy sessions with Rafael Horowitz (David Paymer) for men whose wives have died.  The group includes characters played by Adam Arkin, Sean Austin, Ernie Hudson and Miguel Sandoval.  At the dances you will see Sonia Braga blowing kisses and Donnie Wahlberg as Randall Ipswitch, the group's self-proclaimed Lord of the Dance (although he is not even Irish), but it is shy Meredith Morrison (Marisa Tomei), whose black eye reminds Frank of the Lisa he has yet to meet that catches his eye and perhaps captures his heart (There are other familiar faces to show up as well, but that would give away a bit too much of the end game of this film).The idea of using his original film is this way scores point with me for Miller, and therefore I am willing to forgive the uneasy tension between the running joke that every time Mills seems to flatline in the ambulance, Frank's next question revives him (the instruction was to keep Mills talking until the paramedics arrive, at which point talking might become a bad thing), and the poignancy that he is trying to create with Frank with regards to both Meredith and the search for Lisa.  This is am ambitious effort and ultimately the problem with the film is that in working in most, but not all, of his original short film, Miller sacrifices time and scenes that could have been devoted to the characters in the present.  Consequently, we are forced to connect some of the emotional dots to complete the picture.  I am more willing to do so than some, and hopefully you will be as well.",4,A Good Samiritan tries to keep an appointment for another at Thursday Nights with Marilyn Hotchkiss,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,4194,"['1990', 'having', 'directed', 'Melissa', 'Men', 'episode', 'thirtysomething', 'Randall', 'Miller', 'wrote', 'directed', '30-minute', 'film', 'entitled', 'Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'Charm', 'School', 'Narrated', 'William', 'Hurt', 'adult', 'Steve', 'Mills', 'story', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'played', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'was', 'forced', 'mother', 'take', 'lessons', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'charm', 'Marilyn', 'Hotchiss', 'Patricia', 'Fraser', 'Friday', 'night', 'event', 'complicated', 'fact', 'game', 'British', 'Bulldog', 'Steve', 'elbow', 'connected', 'eye', 'young', 'Lisa', 'Gober', 'Kelley', 'Parker', 'Steve', 'be', 'cool', 'just', 'friend', 'Kenny', 'Dulin', 'Joshua', 'Horowitz', 'also', 'apologize', 'Lisa', 'clearly', 'growing', 'up', 'know', 'what', 'entire', 'short', 'film', 'version', 'original', 'Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'Charm', 'School', 'included', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'feature', 'main', 'film', 'Miller', '2005', 'film', 'same', 'name.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'watch', 'original', 'new', 'version', 'would', 'not', 'dissuade', 'doing', 'so', 'either', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'times', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'short', 'film', 'turned', 'director', 'longer', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'director', 'incorporate', 'most', 'original', 'film', 'longer', 'version', 'not', 'seek', 'retell', 'story', 'use', 'look', 'past', 'up', 'events', 'present', 'Steve', 'Mills', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'narrator', 'duties', 'passing', 'bakery', 'truck', 'driven', 'Frank', 'Keane', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'mountain', 'highway', 'Mills', 'car', 'accident', 'Keane', 'help', 'having', 'been', 'told', '911', 'dispatcher', 'keep', 'Mills', 'talking', 'learn', 'events', 'past.Keane', 'something', 'else', 'Mills', 'way', 'appointment', 'long', 'standing', 'Lisa', 'Gober', 'point', 'fact', 'reunion', 'take', 'place', 'matter', 'what', 'fifth', 'day', 'fifth', 'month', 'fifth', 'year', 'new', 'millennium', 'circumstances', 'Mills', 'Keane', 'keep', 'appointment', 'So', 'Frank', 'right', 'place', 'where', 'Thursday', 'Nights', 'Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'are', 'now', 'hosted', 'permission', 'grace', 'God', 'daughter', 'Marienne', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Now', 'do', 'meet', 'Lisa', 'tell', 'happened', 'course', 'Frank', 'much', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'out', 'dance', 'floor', 'Marienne', 'try', 'Lindy', 'Hop.The', 'story', 'proceeds', 'parallel', 'narratives', 'present', 'Frank', 'attending', 'Thursday', 'night', 'dance', 'lessons', 'weekly', 'group', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'Rafael', 'Horowitz', 'David', 'Paymer', 'men', 'wives', 'have', 'died', 'group', 'characters', 'played', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'Sean', 'Austin', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Miguel', 'Sandoval', 'dances', 'will', 'see', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'blowing', 'kisses', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Randall', 'Ipswitch', 'group', 'self-proclaimed', 'Lord', 'Dance', 'not', 'even', 'Irish', 'shy', 'Meredith', 'Morrison', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'black', 'eye', 'Frank', 'Lisa', 'yet', 'meet', 'eye', 'perhaps', 'heart', 'are', 'other', 'familiar', 'show', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'game', 'film', 'idea', 'using', 'original', 'film', 'way', 'point', 'Miller', 'therefore', 'am', 'willing', 'forgive', 'uneasy', 'tension', 'running', 'joke', 'time', 'Mills', 'flatline', 'ambulance', 'Frank', 'next', 'question', 'instruction', 'was', 'keep', 'Mills', 'talking', 'paramedics', 'arrive', 'point', 'talking', 'might', 'become', 'bad', 'thing', 'poignancy', 'trying', 'create', 'Frank', 'regards', 'Meredith', 'search', 'Lisa', 'am', 'ambitious', 'effort', 'ultimately', 'problem', 'film', 'working', 'most', 'not', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'Miller', 'time', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'characters', 'present', 'Consequently', 'are', 'forced', 'connect', 'emotional', 'dots', 'complete', 'picture', 'am', 'more', 'willing', 'do', 'so', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'well']",N/A

What a great cast... and hey look, Donnie Wahlberg is in it, too. Ok, that is unfair; he did a great job. They all did a great job.With a cast like that, especially in an independent film I typically assume that the big names will be cameos. Someone manages to get John Goodman to make an appearance in your movie because Goodman owes a favor to one of the guys your uncle plays poker with or something ridiculous like that. So he comes in as the mayor of the town or some tiny bit part like that shakes some hands and is never seen nor heard from again. That is not the case in Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School.I know the name alone is enough to turn you away from the film. I mean, Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School, what a stupid title. What on Earth could that be about other than some charm school for little girls? I urge you to look beyond the title and investigate further.You will find a touching story about love and life after death (not life after one's own death, but how one must go on after someone else's death). You may smile and chuckle a little, but this is not a comedy. If it has been a while since you last saw a good drama, or even if it was last night, give Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School a try.I am a big fan of Robert Carlyle. Everyone knows him from The Full Monty, but I have enjoyed his work in other roles as well. Some of my favorite Robert Carlyle performances are The Beach, Plunkett & Macleane, and The 51st State (A/K/A Formula 51). Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School joins them in that list. He plays a first generation immigrant who brings his family's bread business to the US. His wife has passed away and now he struggles each day without her. He is a man who wants to be left alone with his own problems when he is first to arrive after a terrible accident. You can feel how awkward it is for him to find himself in the situation to follow.John Goodman, who I expected to have one scene in the film, really impressed me. He is in the movie start to finish and stretches artistic muscles I never knew he had. He has been solid in everything I have seen him do up to this point, but I have never seen him do anything like this. He really did a great job.The story may be a little far-fetched for some. And one or two of you may call it ""hokey,"" but I liked it a lot. It hasn't taken over the role of my favorite movie, and despite what the synopsis says on the back of the DVD, I probably will not add it to my collection. Please do not let that deter you from giving it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School; I think you'll be entertained if nothing else.

Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[12, 13]","""Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School,"" a 2005 Sundance Festival entry now available on DVD, is one of those independent films that make you wonder why you might ever waste even another five minutes on the drek the major studios put out these days.Several stories are perfectly wrapped into this quiet, unassuming film, and, while each is inviting and engaging in its own right, together they form an exquisite package that charms and captivates, yet always maintains an underlying innocence and wit.""Steve,"" played masterfully by John Goodman, is a man on a mission, hell-bent to make it to an appointment he made with his childhood sweetheart 40 years ago.  With the innocence of first love, they had promised to meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium, and, moreover, to meet at the same dance school where they had once learned to waltz across the gulf that inescapably separates the genders.  Sadly, when he is injured enroute in a traffic accident, it looks as though Steve might not make that appointment after all.  But a passing Good Samaritan, played with understated perfection by Robert Carlyle, promises to fulfill Steve's mission, and so opens the rest of the film.In keeping his promise, Mr. Carlyle's ""Frank,"" a man with more than his own share of regrets, stumbles into a world of which he never dreamt, and possibilities he never suspected.  And through his influence, in turn, a dozen other lives are similarly changed for the better.The all-star cast, which in addition to Goodman and Carlyle includes Marisa Tomei, Donnie Wahlberg,  Camryn Manheim, Ernie Hudson, Mary Steenburgen,  Sean Astin, David Paymer, Adam Arkin, and Danny DeVito, is perfect. Little more need be said.There are those who will dismiss this rare gem as either a chick flick or ""just another dance movie.""  It is neither.  Rather, it is a quiet surprise that inspires without contrivance, entertains effortlessly, and tells a number of stories worth remembering.  It is not to be missed.",5,Simply Marvelous,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,2033,"['Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'Charm', 'School', '2005', 'Sundance', 'Festival', 'entry', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'one', 'independent', 'films', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'might', 'ever', 'waste', 'even', 'five', 'minutes', 'drek', 'major', 'studios', 'put', 'out', 'days.Several', 'stories', 'are', 'perfectly', 'wrapped', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'film', 'inviting', 'engaging', 'own', 'right', 'together', 'form', 'exquisite', 'package', 'charms', 'captivates', 'yet', 'always', 'underlying', 'innocence', 'wit', 'Steve', 'played', 'masterfully', 'John', 'Goodman', 'man', 'mission', 'hell-bent', 'make', 'appointment', 'made', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'innocence', 'first', 'love', 'had', 'promised', 'meet', 'fifth', 'day', 'fifth', 'month', 'fifth', 'year', 'new', 'millennium', 'moreover', 'meet', 'same', 'dance', 'school', 'where', 'had', 'once', 'learned', 'waltz', 'gulf', 'inescapably', 'genders', 'Sadly', 'when', 'injured', 'enroute', 'traffic', 'accident', 'Steve', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'appointment', 'passing', 'Good', 'Samaritan', 'played', 'understated', 'perfection', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'fulfill', 'Steve', 'mission', 'so', 'rest', 'film.In', 'keeping', 'promise', 'Mr.', 'Carlyle', 'Frank', 'man', 'more', 'own', 'share', 'regrets', 'stumbles', 'world', 'never', 'dreamt', 'possibilities', 'never', 'suspected', 'influence', 'turn', 'dozen', 'other', 'lives', 'are', 'similarly', 'changed', 'better.The', 'all-star', 'cast', 'addition', 'Goodman', 'Carlyle', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'David', 'Paymer', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'perfect', 'Little', 'more', 'need', 'be', 'said.There', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'dismiss', 'rare', 'gem', 'chick', 'flick', 'just', 'dance', 'movie', 'neither', 'Rather', 'quiet', 'surprise', 'contrivance', 'effortlessly', 'number', 'stories', 'remembering', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

988522,A1CUOJ9ZMOWD29,B000FDFSGI,Tassie Ted,"[8, 8]","This DVD's been released for a couple of years. It's already been competently pr&eacute;cised by other reviewers. Overwhelmingly, they seem to admire it - as do I. Rather than cover already familiar ground, I'd prefer to take issue with several misplaced criticisms:1) The ""off-putting"" title: Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm SchoolAnyone claiming the title is ""off-putting"" needs to cultivate more curiosity in picking their DVDs. That's not to mention recognizing the potential for good-natured satire which abounds in this movie.Ballroom Dancing and Charm School conventions ARE stilted and pretentious. Young people dread and deride them but (true to the film) they still sign up.Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School's mediocrity and artificial conventions are hilariously but nevertheless sensitively spoofed. It's wry humor never descends to slapstick.The subtle parallels between ""British Bulldog"" and the sexes retreating behind the Blue and Pink lines on either side of the hall were a real hoot.Another delight was Marienne acknowledging her late mother at the beginning of each session, not to mention Frank Keane enrolling his friends from the ""Dead Wives'Club"" (if I heard correctly). This group was seriously under performing in terms of bereavement healing. Again, one suspects a gentle commentary on group therapy per se.  .As children, teenagers and adults, many of us have been to Dance Academies and their ilk. I met my wife at one. This movie cleverly interweaves the comedy with the drama and the positive, socializing and therapeutic processes which can emerge. As young adults, one of the best ones in our area was run by the North Sydney Police Boys' Club.The DVD's title actually attracted my interest. As soon as I checked it wasn't a blood fest, I was hooked.2) Marienne Hotchkiss can't dance properly, etc:Surely, this was the point. Experts making this criticism flaunt erudition at the expense of recognizing the reality of their local Dances.3) Unnecessarily cluttered ending:One couldn't disagree more. Just when viewers thought they were on top of it all and heading towards a Hollywood ""walking off into the sunset"" finale, a lovely little cameo emerges. It throws one of the main protagonists into an intriguing and completely different context. It was a clever and unexpected touch.  The contrast with Steve's boyhood promise mischievously puts ""Charm Schooling"" under re-examination as the movie concludes.4) The flashbacks were confusing:What was the alternative? One of the movie's important strengths was an insightful ability to both parallel and contrast the many adult characters with their formative past.Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School is a gem. It's wry, quirky and insightful. It's original and memorable. If there's any weakness it's the slightly surreal introduction of Robert Carlyle as Frank Keane, the romantic lead. For the first few minutes I thought I'd picked a dud. This was partly due to the cinematography but the story quickly got on track especially when the viewer was spared the detail another spectacular car crash. Any movie where the car crash takes place out of sight, is OK by me, especially when it's a Volvo.",4,They didn't actually see the car crash,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,3223,"['DVD', 'been', 'released', 'couple', 'years', 'already', 'been', 'competently', 'pr', 'eacute', 'cised', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Overwhelmingly', 'seem', 'admire', 'do', 'Rather', 'cover', 'already', 'familiar', 'ground', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'take', 'issue', 'several', 'misplaced', 'criticisms:1', 'off-putting', 'title', 'Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'Charm', 'SchoolAnyone', 'claiming', 'title', 'off-putting', 'needs', 'cultivate', 'more', 'curiosity', 'picking', 'DVDs', 'not', 'mention', 'recognizing', 'potential', 'good-natured', 'satire', 'movie.Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'Charm', 'School', 'conventions', 'ARE', 'stilted', 'pretentious', 'Young', 'people', 'dread', 'deride', 'true', 'film', 'still', 'sign', 'up.Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'Charm', 'School', 'mediocrity', 'artificial', 'conventions', 'are', 'hilariously', 'nevertheless', 'sensitively', 'spoofed', 'wry', 'humor', 'never', 'slapstick.The', 'subtle', 'parallels', 'British', 'Bulldog', 'sexes', 'retreating', 'Blue', 'Pink', 'lines', 'side', 'hall', 'were', 'real', 'hoot.Another', 'delight', 'was', 'Marienne', 'acknowledging', 'late', 'mother', 'beginning', 'session', 'not', 'mention', 'Frank', 'Keane', 'enrolling', 'friends', 'Dead', ""Wives'Club"", 'heard', 'correctly', 'group', 'was', 'seriously', 'performing', 'terms', 'bereavement', 'healing', 'Again', 'one', 'gentle', 'commentary', 'group', 'therapy', 'se', '.As', 'children', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'Dance', 'Academies', 'ilk', 'met', 'wife', 'one', 'movie', 'cleverly', 'comedy', 'drama', 'positive', 'socializing', 'therapeutic', 'processes', 'can', 'emerge', 'young', 'adults', 'one', 'best', 'ones', 'area', 'was', 'run', 'North', 'Sydney', 'Police', 'Boys', 'Club.The', 'DVD', 'title', 'actually', 'attracted', 'interest', 'As', 'soon', 'checked', 'was', ""n't"", 'blood', 'fest', 'was', 'hooked.2', 'Marienne', 'Hotchkiss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'properly', 'etc', 'Surely', 'was', 'point', 'Experts', 'making', 'criticism', 'flaunt', 'erudition', 'expense', 'recognizing', 'reality', 'local', 'Dances.3', 'Unnecessarily', 'cluttered', 'ending', 'One', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'Just', 'when', 'viewers', 'thought', 'were', 'top', 'heading', 'towards', 'Hollywood', 'walking', 'off', 'sunset', 'finale', 'lovely', 'little', 'cameo', 'emerges', 'one', 'main', 'protagonists', 'intriguing', 'completely', 'different', 'context', 'was', 'clever', 'unexpected', 'touch', 'contrast', 'Steve', 'boyhood', 'promise', 'mischievously', 'Charm', 'Schooling', 're-examination', 'movie', 'concludes.4', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'confusing', 'What', 'was', 'alternative', 'One', 'movie', 'important', 'strengths', 'was', 'insightful', 'ability', 'parallel', 'contrast', 'many', 'adult', 'characters', 'formative', 'past.Marilyn', 'Hotchkiss', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'Charm', 'School', 'gem', 'wry', 'quirky', 'insightful', 'original', 'memorable', 'weakness', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'introduction', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Frank', 'Keane', 'romantic', 'lead', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'thought', ""'d"", 'picked', 'dud', 'was', 'partly', 'due', 'cinematography', 'story', 'quickly', 'got', 'track', 'especially', 'when', 'viewer', 'was', 'spared', 'detail', 'spectacular', 'car', 'crash', 'movie', 'where', 'car', 'crash', 'place', 'sight', 'OK', 'especially', 'when', 'Volvo']",N/A
