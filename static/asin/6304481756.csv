Her character, of which a viewer will never know her first name, is vulnerable and pretty, especially in her evening gown. No wonder that the journalist colleague (played by Robert Williams) has hard time after snubbing her for a rich platinum blonde. The great bit of nostalgia stems from the fact that Williams died later that year the movie was completed and Jean Harlow (the platinum blonde) died a few years later. Otherwise, it is a surprisingly fresh and lovable comedy (although you shouldn't expect too much), with somehow familiar music and a merit to the name of Frank Capra, who went on to become one of the greatest director Hollywood has ever produced.",4,"Now Nostalgic, But Still Surprisingly Fresh (3.5 stars)",1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,791,"['Just', '18-year-old', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'off', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'actress', 'now', 'three-quarters-of-century', 'old', 'comedy', 'character', 'viewer', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'first', 'name', 'vulnerable', 'pretty', 'especially', 'evening', 'gown', 'wonder', 'journalist', 'colleague', 'played', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'hard', 'time', 'snubbing', 'rich', 'platinum', 'blonde', 'great', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'stems', 'fact', 'Williams', 'died', 'later', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'completed', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'platinum', 'blonde', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Otherwise', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', 'lovable', 'comedy', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'somehow', 'familiar', 'music', 'merit', 'name', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'director', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'produced']",Platinum Blonde VHS

But this one is Frank Capra, and frankly I expect more from him. In 1931, I suspect he was pretty new to the film industry. I'll have to look that up.Ann Schuyler (Jean Harlow) is a rich girl who flirts with reporter Stew Smith (Robert Williams, which is a name I don't think I've heard before) in order to try to persuade him not to print a scandalous story about her brother and a Ziegfeld girl. He prints it anyway, but manages to steal the blackmail letters from the girl while interviewing her, and brings them to Ann. A romance commences where it is pretty obvious she's interested in him mostly because her mother hates him.In fact, she marries him for that reason. But her idea is to make a gentleman out of him, and sweet-talks him into moving in with her mother in their huge mansion and basically becoming what his buddies refer to as a bird in a gilded cage.Only one buddy is really against the match: Gallagher, his best pal. Gallagher is played by Loretta Young, but somehow Smith neglected to mention to his wife that his buddy Gallagher is female. Imagine that.From this point, I suspect you could write the script yourself.

The man simply puts on an acting clinic here. I wonder if young aspiring actors are ever shown this film and told to study Williams? If is wasn't for this film, I assume nobody would ever know about this guy.Anyway, the movie is really dated but its interesting thanks to some great dialog, mainly, once again, by Williams. Jean Harlow gets the billing but a young Loretta Young has the real beauty and charm here. Too bad her role was so minor and bland. She looked absolutely gorgeous.The storyline is one of Hollywood's favorite themes: the average Joe beating up on the snobby rich people. Harlow's ""mother"" in here (Louise Closser Hale) plays that snob role perfectly.Even though I gave it only three stars, there are lots of laughs in this film and it was a lot better than I thought it would be.

425059,A1RWOUO0CNS1D6,6304481756,Dennis Lee Cleven,"[7, 9]","I enjoy this Frank Capra film very much and it deserves to be on DVD. Robert Williams is the real star of the film and he was a brilliant actor who died shortly after this film was made. His death was due to appendicitis. He would have gone onto stardom being a quick comic actor. I cannot see how anyone can find this film dull! The script and the pacing are superb. Capra put the newcomer Jean Harlow at ease and the result is a fine performance from the twenty year old actress. It is the best performance she gave prior to her contract with MGM in 1932. Capra toned down her make-up and let her real beauty shine through. Jean Harlow proved that she had a knack for comedy and appears very comfortable with Robert Williams. Harlow is marvelous as is the even younger Loretta Young who was a mere eighteen year old. Harlow and Young balance the film out superbly. It is not a competition between them but a challenge for Rober Williams to realise who he really loves. Jean as Ann Schuyler sees him as a project to make him into an upper class gentleman. Loretta Young pines for him and loves him as the down-to-earth reporter Stew Smith. The film works on all levels and I highly recommend it. Robert Williams, Jean Harlow and Loretta Young are all superb and aided by great direction, a tight script, superb sets, and a marvelous supporting cast. This may not be ""It Happened One Night"" or ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but it is a film that shows that Capra was a marvelous director with a unique style that is his alone. One can tell a Capra film and it is evident in ""Platinum Blonde"". The title wasn't his choice--he wanted to call it ""Gallgher"" but Columbia was cashing in on the Harlow popularity. Whatever the title, Jean Harlow deserves credit for proving that she was already a fine actress while working with the right director. I recommend this film highly.

425061,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6304481756,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[8, 14]","PLATINUM BLONDE is an early Frank Capra-directed effort concerning common-man reporter Robert Williams who ignores an obvious love match with co-worker Loretta Young in favor of marriage with high-society socialite Jean Harlow.  Although often cited as an early example of the screwball comedy genre Capra helped create with such films as IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, the script is very dated, and from a modern standpoint it creaks in almost every scene.Although not often noted for her acting skills, Loretta Young gives a very fine performance here in the role of Gallagher, an attractive but working class reporter who can hold her own with the boys while maintaining her femininity.  The often praised but little known Robert Williams gives an equally pleasant, enjoyable performance, albeit one less successful than Young's in the face of passing time.  But Jean Harlow is seriously miscast in the role of manipulative socialite Anne Schuyler, who is first attracted to Williams by his working-class attitudes and who then seeks to erradicate them after their marriage.The film is perhaps most interesting to Harlow fans, for it shows Harlow before Hollywood discovered how to best display both her talents and her beauty.  Harlow's talent did extend to light drama, but she would be most at home in wise-cracking, sassy comedy, and she is clearly out of her element in this particular role; her physical appearance is also quite unlike the Harlow iconography expertly developed by MGM, and she looks rather like a white-blonde version of Kay Francis--but unfortunately without any of that actress' sparkle.  It is a very wooden performance that seriously undercuts the success of the film, and one wishes that Young and Harlow had been cast in each other's roles.Harlow fans will enjoy seeing Harlow &quot;before she was Harlow,&quot; and those interested in the evolution of Frank Capra's work or in the development of the screwball comedy genre will find the film of considerable interest.  Others, however, should stay away: the film has more historic interest than entertainment value, and more casual viewers would do better to select later films--such as Young's THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER, Capra's MR.

425063,A3RUMI4Y58S59,6304481756,Heaven's Hound,"[1, 2]","Originally ""Platinum Blond"" was named ""Gallagher"" after the character played by Loretta Young, who also had top billing.  But when the studio realized they had a mega star in Harlow, Young was demoted, only by title not billing.  At the time Young was a bigger star than Harlow.  From all reports Young and Harlow got along famously, no diva quarrels on set, for both were down-to-earth actors.  Harlow is definitely sexy in the movie, but she is terribly miscast and her acting leaves much to be desired.  Young is quite good as Gallagher; her acting was always unappreciated for her luminous beauty always seemed to get in the way.  No about it, the true beauty in this film is Young.  In every frame she's in, she steals the scene, not because of her acting, but she intuitively knows the power of her beauty.  Just watch her, there's a stillness about her that is remarkable, a kind of minimalist acting that is astounding in that you eye naturally goes to her.  It's sad that Harlow died only two years after making this film.  Young, however, went on to have a glorious, legendary Hollywood career, culminating in her winning the Academy Award for her role in ""The Farmer's Daughter.""  She later had the courage to take on TV, and there was no bigger star on TV, except for Lucille Ball.  Who can ever forget Young swirling through the door every week in a designer gown by Jean Louis, her future husband, by the way. I'm glad to see that because of the new book, ""The Star Machine,"" Young's career is now being reevaluated.  She indeed made some fine films.  And she is a better actress than critics have give her credit for.  As for her beauty:  she is one of the most beautiful women to grace the silver screen.  The camera loved her face.  The photographer Hurrell captured her beauty in many portraits, but the one I favor is the cover of ""The Star Machine"":  she and Tyrone Power together.  Classic Hollywood photography.  It's Capra's first film, and it's a very good one.  For Young and Harlow fans it's a must see.",4,Loretta Young has top billing in Platinum Blond.

Loretta Young, as Gallagher, however, looks & is much better. She's cute as one of the guys, the only female reporter in the press room of a major newspaper. Only when she shows up to cover a society soiree in a backless evening gown do we see how beautiful & well put together she really is. Not one of the boys. Her co-worker, Stew, played by Robert Williams is too stupid to see that she is in love with him. He sees her merely as his good bud. He become infatuated with Anne, (Harlow) a rich girl diletante, & she with him & his working class background. They marry she immediately sets out to change him. He moves in with her & her family.

The studio obviously wanted to showcase Jean Harlow to sell the picture. She's a second lead as Ann Schuyler, a wealthy society girl who marries a coarse newspaper reporter, Stew (Robert Williams) and tries to refine him. But, in as obvious a plot line as you can throw to an audience, his heart belongs to Gallagher (Loretta Young) his co-worker at the paper. The studio wanted to please Depression era audiences so the rich are portrayed as stuffy bores and the ""poor"" (Williams) are portrayed as scrappers who punch people in the face when they get mad and feel it's justified. I disagree that Williams gave a good performance. ""Stew"" (an apt a name as any) came off as sarcastic and unlikeable. The Schuyler family was justifiably appalled at him. Ann liked him though and tried to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. But he ends up feeling stifled and going ballistic. He wants to write. Williams showed none of the humaness that made Cagney or Gable so good at these kind of parts. His character was way too arrogant and cocky.  His performance is badly dated and chauvinistic (especially in his dealings with Gallagher). But what I enjoyed about the film was the luminous presences of two future stars---Jean Harlow and Loretta Young. Both were excellent. Harlow had a thankless role as Ann but she was fabulous in gowns and quite braless. She was more sympathetic than the film would have you think. She didn't deserve the treatment she got from Stew. Young was SO young and so pretty and very good as Gallagher. She certainly didn't deserve Stew either. But that was the studio's approach to pleasing the masses back then. I can't recommend this as a good film because of Williams. But, as a relic of times gone by---it's certainly worth a look or two for Harlow and Young and for that fabulous Schuyler house with those immense diamond shaped tile floors and gorgeous staircase that Harlow goes up and down in those gowns and chandelier earrings.

This screwball comedy directed by Frank Capra gave top billing to Loretta Young and Jean Harlow, both of whom were on the fast track to superstardom.  Williams steals the show with many scenes of one who could charm the audience with his tough guy approach that would later catch on with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy.  Stew Smith (Williams) is a hard-nosed reporter whose specialty is delivering the scoop that others couldn't.  He is assigned to cover a major scandal over a breach of promise suit with rich snobgirl Anne Schyler (Harlow). Smith meets Schyler and sparks fly. Naturally her family is aghast at the prospect of a working class stiff as an in-law.  Williams has a co-worker Gallagher (Young) who loves him madly but he can't see her as anyone but one of the boys.  Part of the comedy is that a beautiful woman like Gallagher (Young was 18 at the time) could possibly ever be taken as such.  The rest of the humor lies in Smith as a fish out of water.  When the Poor Man marries the Rich Girl, the Rich girl naturally assumes that the Poor Man will be more than happy to move from his dumpy apartment into her ritzy mansion while the Poor Man feels the same only in reverse. Director Capra uses the Schyler family as a cinematic straw man.  With the possible exception of the butler and the son, everyone else in the Schyler clan is snooty, arrogant, and totally clueless in their collective belief that everybody has a price.  Before Smith marries Anne, she tries to buy him off with a bribe of five thousand dollars to kill a story that would reflect unfavorably on her family.  After their marriage goes predictably sour, she tries to buy him off again, this time with a big alimony that he manfully rejects. Harlow plays Anne as a woman who is so thoroughly entrenched in her family's arrogance that when she falls in love with Stew, that love cannot withstand her social prejudices.  Some of the scenes that highlight these differences are not of the screwball type. In one revealing scene, Stew tries to tell her that he invited his hard-drinking friends to visit him in his new home.  Anne can't stand them and retorts, ""Your home?""  Capra ensures that all of a Depression-afflicted America could look at the Schylers as social buffoons, totally unworthy of their riches and hence a legitimate target for ridicule. Williams is the true star and Young is effective in her role as one who loves a man who loves another woman.  The inner tragedy is that Robert Williams died of a burst appendix just a few days after PLATINUM BLONDE was released in October 1931. He is justly remembered as a star in the making who was not permited to grow into more roles like this one.",4,An Eagle In A Gilded Cage,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,2767,"['Almost', 'one', 'today', 'male', 'star', 'PLATINUM', 'BLONDE', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'gave', 'top', 'billing', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'whom', 'were', 'fast', 'track', 'superstardom', 'Williams', 'show', 'many', 'scenes', 'one', 'who', 'could', 'charm', 'audience', 'tough', 'guy', 'approach', 'would', 'later', 'catch', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Stew', 'Smith', 'Williams', 'hard-nosed', 'reporter', 'specialty', 'delivering', 'scoop', 'others', 'could', ""n't"", 'assigned', 'cover', 'major', 'scandal', 'breach', 'promise', 'suit', 'rich', 'snobgirl', 'Anne', 'Schyler', 'Harlow', 'Smith', 'Schyler', 'sparks', 'fly', 'Naturally', 'family', 'aghast', 'prospect', 'working', 'class', 'stiff', 'in-law', 'Williams', 'co-worker', 'Gallagher', 'Young', 'who', 'madly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'one', 'boys', 'Part', 'comedy', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Gallagher', 'Young', 'was', '18', 'time', 'could', 'possibly', 'ever', 'be', 'taken', 'such', 'rest', 'humor', 'Smith', 'fish', 'water', 'When', 'Poor', 'Man', 'Rich', 'Girl', 'Rich', 'girl', 'naturally', 'Poor', 'Man', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'happy', 'move', 'dumpy', 'apartment', 'ritzy', 'mansion', 'Poor', 'Man', 'same', 'only', 'reverse', 'Director', 'Capra', 'Schyler', 'family', 'cinematic', 'straw', 'man', 'possible', 'exception', 'butler', 'son', 'everyone', 'else', 'Schyler', 'clan', 'snooty', 'arrogant', 'totally', 'clueless', 'collective', 'belief', 'everybody', 'price', 'Smith', 'marries', 'Anne', 'buy', 'off', 'bribe', 'five', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'kill', 'story', 'would', 'reflect', 'unfavorably', 'family', 'marriage', 'predictably', 'sour', 'buy', 'off', 'again', 'time', 'big', 'alimony', 'manfully', 'Harlow', 'Anne', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'entrenched', 'family', 'arrogance', 'when', 'love', 'Stew', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'withstand', 'social', 'prejudices', 'scenes', 'highlight', 'differences', 'are', 'not', 'screwball', 'type', 'one', 'revealing', 'scene', 'Stew', 'tell', 'invited', 'hard-drinking', 'friends', 'visit', 'new', 'home', 'Anne', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'retorts', 'home', 'Capra', 'Depression-afflicted', 'America', 'could', 'look', 'Schylers', 'social', 'buffoons', 'totally', 'unworthy', 'riches', 'hence', 'legitimate', 'target', 'ridicule', 'Williams', 'true', 'star', 'Young', 'effective', 'role', 'one', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'woman', 'inner', 'tragedy', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'died', 'burst', 'appendix', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'PLATINUM', 'BLONDE', 'was', 'released', 'October', '1931', 'justly', 'remembered', 'star', 'making', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'permited', 'grow', 'more', 'roles', 'one']",Platinum Blonde VHS
425071,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6304481756,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[6, 7]","Platinum Blonde remains a fine example of an early screwball comedy about very different people trying to coexist with each under stressful situations with plenty of silly lines and good laughs on the side. The script is certainly not the best you'll ever find but the actors do a superlative job with what they are given. The direction by Frank Capra reflects forethought and the camera angles help dramatize scenes in the movie as the plot unfolds.The story starts with newspaper reporter Stew Smith, played by the very talented Robert Williams, going to get a story on a rich society scandal. He gets it; but he also gets the heart of the daughter of the wealthy Schuyler family, Anne, played by the beautiful Jean Harlow. Stew and Anne become romantically involved and the problems begin right along with the romance. Stew comes from a working class background and he wants to support his wife; but Anne has very different plans for him. This constant tug of war for control of their relationship dominates the rest of the movie plot.In addition, look for Loretta Young playing Gallagher. Gallagher and Stew are friends; but to make matters even more complicated Gallagher wants more from Stew than friendship. Anne's mother and the family attorney spice up the plot even further with their histrionics about the tragedy of Anne's ""funeral"" relationship with Stew. Wow!Will Anne and Stew stay together? Will Anne's family ultimately accept and love Stew as one of their own? Will Stew become ""a bird in a gilded cage? ""How will Gallagher fit into this plot? No spoilers here, folks: you'll have to watch the movie to find out the answers to these questions!  SMILEThe cinematography impressed me; in 1931 it was still difficult for pictures to be shot without the camera staying still because microphones could not yet be moved about above the cameras. Nevertheless, in Platinum Blonde Capra manages to get both the cameras and the microphones moving as the actors move about the set. Excellent! The sound wobbles at times but this is to be expected from an older movie like this one.I agree with the reviewers who write that somehow the title of this movie, Platinum Blonde, gives you the sense that Jean Harlow is the big star--but she doesn't quite get that honor when the credits roll. In fact, she gets second billing below Loretta Young! I agree with others who believe that the movie studio was indeed trying to play up the fact that Jean Harlow was in the movie.The DVD comes with few extras; you merely get a couple of movie trailers. That irks me but in those days excess footage was not necessarily kept.What a tragedy that poor Robert Williams died so soon after this picture was finished. He would have been a huge star had he lived longerOverall, Platinum Blonde is a cross between a serious story and a purely comedic romp through relationships that become challenged when two people from very different backgrounds try to stay in love. Jean Harlow fans will treasure this movie; she never looked lovelier and her very convincing acting shines all the way through the picture. Fans of older movie classics will also enjoy watching Platinum Blonde.",5,Cinderella Man and The Platinum Blonde,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,3166,"['Platinum', 'Blonde', 'fine', 'example', 'early', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'trying', 'coexist', 'stressful', 'situations', 'plenty', 'silly', 'lines', 'good', 'laughs', 'side', 'script', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'find', 'actors', 'do', 'superlative', 'job', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'direction', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'forethought', 'camera', 'help', 'dramatize', 'scenes', 'movie', 'plot', 'unfolds.The', 'story', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Stew', 'Smith', 'played', 'very', 'talented', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'going', 'get', 'story', 'rich', 'society', 'scandal', 'also', 'heart', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'Schuyler', 'family', 'Anne', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'Stew', 'Anne', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'problems', 'begin', 'right', 'romance', 'Stew', 'working', 'class', 'background', 'support', 'wife', 'Anne', 'very', 'different', 'plans', 'constant', 'tug', 'war', 'control', 'relationship', 'rest', 'movie', 'plot.In', 'addition', 'look', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'playing', 'Gallagher', 'Gallagher', 'Stew', 'are', 'friends', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'Gallagher', 'more', 'Stew', 'friendship', 'Anne', 'mother', 'family', 'attorney', 'spice', 'plot', 'even', 'further', 'histrionics', 'tragedy', 'Anne', 'funeral', 'relationship', 'Stew', 'Wow', 'Will', 'Anne', 'Stew', 'stay', 'together', 'Will', 'Anne', 'family', 'ultimately', 'accept', 'love', 'Stew', 'one', 'own', 'Will', 'Stew', 'become', 'bird', 'gilded', 'cage', 'How', 'will', 'Gallagher', 'fit', 'plot', 'No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'questions', 'SMILEThe', 'cinematography', 'impressed', '1931', 'was', 'still', 'difficult', 'pictures', 'be', 'shot', 'camera', 'staying', 'still', 'microphones', 'could', 'not', 'yet', 'be', 'moved', 'about', 'cameras', 'Nevertheless', 'Platinum', 'Blonde', 'Capra', 'get', 'cameras', 'microphones', 'moving', 'actors', 'move', 'set', 'Excellent', 'sound', 'times', 'be', 'expected', 'older', 'movie', 'one.I', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'write', 'somehow', 'title', 'movie', 'Platinum', 'Blonde', 'sense', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'big', 'star', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'honor', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'fact', 'second', 'billing', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'agree', 'others', 'who', 'believe', 'movie', 'studio', 'was', 'indeed', 'trying', 'play', 'up', 'fact', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'was', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'merely', 'get', 'couple', 'movie', 'trailers', 'days', 'excess', 'footage', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'kept.What', 'tragedy', 'poor', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'died', 'so', 'soon', 'picture', 'was', 'finished', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'star', 'had', 'lived', 'longerOverall', 'Platinum', 'Blonde', 'cross', 'serious', 'story', 'purely', 'comedic', 'romp', 'relationships', 'become', 'challenged', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'try', 'stay', 'love', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'fans', 'will', 'treasure', 'movie', 'never', 'looked', 'lovelier', 'very', 'convincing', 'acting', 'shines', 'way', 'picture', 'Fans', 'older', 'movie', 'classics', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Platinum', 'Blonde']",Platinum Blonde VHS

Nevertheless this movie is played out to the desire of Columbia studios to promote Jean Harlow. No one ever complains about the casting, but the theme of the movie, set in depression era (1931) is lame. Jean Harlow plays the only daughter of upper-class socialite, Ann Schuyler who marries a shrewd newspaper reporter Stew (Robert Williams), and then tries to control his life in the confinements of her palatial home as a house husband, but without success. He invites his friends to his home to party, and his female friend Gallagher (Loretta Young) with whom he collaborates to write a play. At the end, Ann and Stew get separated and he later marries Gallagher. This is somewhat an unrealistic story, and a very strange way to poke at the wealthy for the ills of depression era. However Jean Harlow is stunning and offers a great performance as a spoiled wealthy girl. Loretta Young, one of her performances early in the career, is sweet and adorable as she always is. The untimely and sad deaths of Jean Harlow (at the age of 26) due to Influenza and kidney failure, and Robert Williams due to Peritonitis (died three days after the release of the movie) leaves this movie as a tribute to the work of these young artists.1.It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition)2.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington",3,A Senseless Jibe; but Jean Harlow is beautiful and Loretta Young is adorable,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1452,"['not', 'best', 'work', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'who', 'known', 'one', 'greatest', 'classics', 'ever', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'desire', 'Columbia', 'studios', 'promote', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'one', 'ever', 'casting', 'theme', 'movie', 'set', 'depression', 'era', '1931', 'lame', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'only', 'daughter', 'upper-class', 'socialite', 'Ann', 'Schuyler', 'who', 'shrewd', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Stew', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'then', 'control', 'life', 'confinements', 'palatial', 'home', 'house', 'husband', 'success', 'friends', 'home', 'party', 'female', 'friend', 'Gallagher', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'whom', 'write', 'play', 'end', 'Ann', 'Stew', 'get', 'separated', 'later', 'Gallagher', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'story', 'very', 'strange', 'way', 'poke', 'wealthy', 'ills', 'depression', 'era', 'However', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'stunning', 'great', 'performance', 'spoiled', 'wealthy', 'girl', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'one', 'performances', 'early', 'career', 'sweet', 'adorable', 'always', 'untimely', 'sad', 'deaths', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'age', '26', 'due', 'Influenza', 'kidney', 'failure', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'due', 'Peritonitis', 'died', 'three', 'days', 'release', 'movie', 'movie', 'tribute', 'work', 'young', 'artists.1.It', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '60th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', '2.Mr', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington']",Platinum Blonde VHS

He's so clever, he gets them to admit to a story against their will, but in the process is captured by the eye of beautiful daugher Anne (Jean Harlow). Although he scoops them, he also helps them out of the mess and makes his way into the family by eloping with Anne. This hurts his pal Gallagher (Loretta Young) who has loved him for years, but he's in his own world. He doesn't quite realize what he's getting himself into as a poor man wedding a rich family. Cracks from his friends ensue and day by day his wife does all that she can to change him.Unfortunately, people have high expectations for this film, and it doesn't necessarily measure up. First of all, this is not typical Capra. There are not heartfelt messages of hope at the end. The characters do not signify what the average man strives to be or the pitfalls he faces. Secondly, Harlow does not play a seductress here; in fact, she's quite classy. Last, Williams is an unknown, and alongside an all star cast, he's the leading man. This can be startling because we have never seen him before and are therefore less likely to like him right off. The first time I saw this film, I was incredibly disappointed and what upset me even more was that this was Harlow's first DVD release. Although the title became her nickname, this is an awful way to experience typical Harlow, but it is a wonderful way for fans to see her in a new light.If you can find a way to judge this film not based on expectations but on its own merits, you'll find it to be quite enjoyable. Each player is fantastic, namely Williams whose naturalness and easy humor makes the film breezy and fun to watch. Harlow is regal and intelligent, not the least bit green despite this being one of her first big films (before the eyebrow makeover). Young is fresh and exciting, quite thin, but absolutely gorgeous.",4,Give it a Few Tries,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,2019,"['Platinum', 'Blonde', 'story', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'one', 'best', 'job', 'investigate', 'scandal', 'one', 'best', 'known', 'families', 'Schuylers', 'so', 'clever', 'admit', 'story', 'will', 'process', 'captured', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'daugher', 'Anne', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'also', 'mess', 'way', 'family', 'eloping', 'Anne', 'pal', 'Gallagher', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'who', 'loved', 'years', 'own', 'world', ""n't"", 'quite', 'realize', 'what', 'getting', 'poor', 'man', 'wedding', 'rich', 'family', 'Cracks', 'friends', 'ensue', 'day', 'day', 'wife', 'can', 'change', 'him.Unfortunately', 'people', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'measure', 'up', 'First', 'all', 'not', 'typical', 'Capra', 'are', 'not', 'heartfelt', 'messages', 'hope', 'end', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'signify', 'what', 'average', 'man', 'be', 'pitfalls', 'Secondly', 'Harlow', 'not', 'play', 'seductress', 'here', 'fact', 'quite', 'classy', 'Last', 'Williams', 'unknown', 'star', 'cast', 'leading', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'startling', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'are', 'therefore', 'less', 'likely', 'like', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'incredibly', 'disappointed', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'was', 'Harlow', 'first', 'DVD', 'release', 'title', 'became', 'nickname', 'awful', 'way', 'experience', 'typical', 'Harlow', 'wonderful', 'way', 'fans', 'see', 'new', 'light.If', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'judge', 'film', 'not', 'based', 'expectations', 'own', 'merits', ""'ll"", 'find', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'player', 'fantastic', 'namely', 'Williams', 'naturalness', 'easy', 'humor', 'film', 'breezy', 'fun', 'watch', 'Harlow', 'regal', 'intelligent', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'green', 'being', 'one', 'first', 'big', 'films', 'eyebrow', 'makeover', 'Young', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'quite', 'thin', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous']",Platinum Blonde VHS

This film plowed newer ground, even while it reinforced (with Loretta Young's performance) the career-girl myth.  Rather than simply break a man's heart and betray him with another, Harlow's emasculation of her ace-reporter husband challenged not his sexuality, but his role as an independent provider.  Socialite Harlow views his livlihood and his playwrighting aspirations both as an inconvenience and a blight on leisure-class dilettantism.  Indefatigable and insensitive shrew that she is, she strips him of all that has been essential to he self-definition; insisting on setting up house in her parent's mansion, she insults his friends and belittles his work.  The forgotten Robert Williams is easily the best thing about this film; his performance still shines with a natural virility uncommon in early talkies.  Tragically, he died soon after this film was made.",3,ODE TO ROBERT WILLIAMS,1006128000,"11 19, 2001",2001,1062,"['PLATINUM', 'BLONDE', 'early', 'Capra', 'comedy', 'heavy-handed', 'showed', 'glints', 'director', 'knack', 'outrageous', 'situations', 'cast', 'Harlow', 'improbable', 'role', 'hoi-polloi', 'socialite', 'film', 'plowed', 'newer', 'ground', 'even', 'reinforced', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'performance', 'career-girl', 'myth', 'Rather', 'simply', 'break', 'man', 'heart', 'betray', 'Harlow', 'emasculation', 'ace-reporter', 'husband', 'challenged', 'not', 'sexuality', 'role', 'independent', 'provider', 'Socialite', 'Harlow', 'livlihood', 'playwrighting', 'aspirations', 'inconvenience', 'blight', 'leisure-class', 'dilettantism', 'Indefatigable', 'insensitive', 'shrew', 'strips', 'been', 'essential', 'self-definition', 'insisting', 'setting', 'up', 'house', 'parent', 'mansion', 'insults', 'friends', 'belittles', 'work', 'forgotten', 'Robert', 'Williams', 'easily', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'performance', 'still', 'natural', 'virility', 'uncommon', 'early', 'talkies', 'Tragically', 'died', 'soon', 'film', 'was', 'made']",Platinum Blonde VHS
