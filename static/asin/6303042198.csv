Considering how long ago it was made, and taking it in the context of the '20's, it was quite terrifying. You could see the influence of German Expressionism on Hitchcock, and you could see all of Hitch's later themes fully developed. As an introduction to Hitchcock it was perfect. And then Nitin Sawhney's new soundtrack was very entertaining and made an excellent and clever counterpoint to the image. The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because nothing can be perfect... though this comes close.",4,Surprisingly contemporary and entertaining,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,554,"['loved', 'Ivor', 'Novello', 'was', 'revelation', 'Considering', 'how', 'long', 'was', 'made', 'taking', 'context', ""'20"", 'was', 'quite', 'terrifying', 'could', 'see', 'influence', 'German', 'Expressionism', 'Hitchcock', 'could', 'see', 'Hitch', 'later', 'themes', 'fully', 'developed', 'introduction', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'perfect', 'then', 'Nitin', 'Sawhney', 'new', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'made', 'excellent', 'clever', 'counterpoint', 'image', 'only', 'reason', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', '5', 'stars', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'perfect', 'close']",The Lodger VHS
352381,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,6303042198,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[20, 20]","This excellent DVD release is well overdue because ""The Lodger"" is an essential and important film in the Alfred Hitchcock repertoire, being the first film to feature all the famous Hitchcock trademarks.  Not only was it revolutionary new genre back in the mid 1920s, but it remains an outstanding silent film to this day, and is a shining example of how effective, dramatic and poignant a well-made silent film can be.  Without the medium of sound, silent film directors became very creative in the use of visual effects, and ""The Lodger"" boasts some excellent examples.  These were most probably inspired by German Expressionism, to which Hitchcock was exposed early in his career, and from which he took their effective use of light and shadow, unusual camera angles and visually expressive style to make good use in his own productions.  The shadowy look and solemn mood of typical German Expressionist films suit the theme of this Hitchcock thriller perfectly because it is based on the ever-popular story of Jack the Ripper.  On foggy Tuesday nights in London, young blonde girls are murdered by someone calling himself `The Avenger', and when a mysterious stranger arrives at a house looking for accommodation, the family begins to suspect their unusual lodger of being the killer.  Suspense and drama escalate in true Hitchcock fashion as the viewer wonders if he really could be the killer, and if so, what danger awaits the daughter of the family who is falling in love with the mysterious stranger.More than just a typical Hitchcock thriller, ""The Lodger"" boasts all the best features of finest silent cinema, and it was the turning point in Hitchcock's career, being acclaimed as the greatest British film made up to that date in 1926.  Very good picture quality throughout is accentuated by perfect musical accompaniment to create the right mood, with even a choice of two different scores.  The many bonus features on this DVD add to the viewer's understanding of the film and of Hitchcock himself, with a 20-minute documentary focussing on ""The Lodger"" as well as interviews with Hitchcock, an audio commentary to the film and other exciting and unusual items.  Needless to say, this is an essential addition to any Hitchcock collection, but should not be overlooked by the general cinema enthusiast because silent films represent the foundation of modern cinema, and reveal the roots and early development of motion picture, as well as the various pioneers of the industry, Hitchcock being one of them.",5,Much more than a great Hitchcock thriller!,1235088000,"02 20, 2009",2009,2518,"['excellent', 'DVD', 'release', 'well', 'overdue', 'Lodger', 'essential', 'important', 'film', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'repertoire', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'feature', 'famous', 'Hitchcock', 'trademarks', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'new', 'genre', 'back', 'mid', '1920s', 'outstanding', 'silent', 'film', 'day', 'shining', 'example', 'how', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'poignant', 'well-made', 'silent', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'medium', 'sound', 'silent', 'film', 'directors', 'became', 'very', 'creative', 'use', 'visual', 'effects', 'Lodger', 'excellent', 'examples', 'were', 'most', 'probably', 'inspired', 'German', 'Expressionism', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'exposed', 'early', 'career', 'took', 'effective', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'unusual', 'camera', 'angles', 'visually', 'expressive', 'style', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'own', 'productions', 'shadowy', 'look', 'solemn', 'mood', 'typical', 'German', 'Expressionist', 'films', 'suit', 'theme', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'perfectly', 'based', 'ever-popular', 'story', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'foggy', 'Tuesday', 'nights', 'London', 'young', 'blonde', 'girls', 'are', 'murdered', 'someone', 'calling', 'Avenger', 'when', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'house', 'looking', 'accommodation', 'family', 'suspect', 'unusual', 'lodger', 'being', 'killer', 'Suspense', 'drama', 'escalate', 'true', 'Hitchcock', 'fashion', 'viewer', 'wonders', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'killer', 'so', 'what', 'danger', 'daughter', 'family', 'who', 'falling', 'love', 'mysterious', 'stranger.More', 'just', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'Lodger', 'best', 'features', 'finest', 'silent', 'cinema', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'Hitchcock', 'career', 'being', 'acclaimed', 'greatest', 'British', 'film', 'made', 'up', 'date', '1926', 'Very', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'accentuated', 'perfect', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'create', 'right', 'mood', 'even', 'choice', 'two', 'different', 'scores', 'many', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'add', 'viewer', 'understanding', 'film', 'Hitchcock', '20-minute', 'documentary', 'focussing', 'Lodger', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'Hitchcock', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'other', 'exciting', 'unusual', 'items', 'Needless', 'say', 'essential', 'addition', 'Hitchcock', 'collection', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'general', 'cinema', 'enthusiast', 'silent', 'films', 'represent', 'foundation', 'modern', 'cinema', 'reveal', 'roots', 'early', 'development', 'motion', 'picture', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'pioneers', 'industry', 'Hitchcock', 'being', 'one']",The Lodger VHS

E Jackson,"[0, 6]","The Lodger WOULD have been a terrific movie because it definitely has twists, turns, surprises, a few moments of above average suspense...but then we have to consider that the actual storyline was distractingly mediocre.The storyline is about trying to solve the mystery over who exactly is the modern day Jack the Ripper among a select group of people.Without spoiling what happens at the end, the storyline constantly jumps back and forth between the husband and a man living in their spare room (outside behind the house).  You're constantly guessing which one of the two is the actual Jack the Ripper going around killing innocent women on the streets late at night.However, what severely hurts the plotline is that it focuses more on the detective/police side of the storyline, and less on the actual suspense and killings (which are just tossed to the side without giving the violent segments much attention, if at all).I personally would have preferred a violent version of Jack the Ripper because every interpretation that I've seen NEVER focuses on the muderous/violent side of the killer, and it's a shame.  However, that's just personal preference- I suppose the movie writers never intended to focus on the murderous side of Jack the Ripper and wanted to keep things authentic concerning the myths and legends.Other than that, it's an alright film, though geez... Simon Baker had to play a major role in this film, seriously?  I like the guy but he's not someone who should be playing in a supposed suspense.",3,weak storyline leading to satisfying conclusion,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,1520,"['Lodger', 'WOULD', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'movie', 'definitely', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprises', 'few', 'moments', 'above', 'average', 'suspense', 'then', 'have', 'consider', 'actual', 'storyline', 'was', 'distractingly', 'mediocre.The', 'storyline', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'who', 'exactly', 'modern', 'day', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'select', 'group', 'people.Without', 'spoiling', 'what', 'end', 'storyline', 'constantly', 'back', 'forth', 'husband', 'man', 'living', 'spare', 'room', 'house', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'guessing', 'one', 'two', 'actual', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'going', 'killing', 'innocent', 'women', 'streets', 'late', 'night.However', 'what', 'severely', 'plotline', 'more', 'detective/police', 'side', 'storyline', 'less', 'actual', 'suspense', 'killings', 'are', 'just', 'tossed', 'side', 'giving', 'violent', 'segments', 'much', 'attention', '.I', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'violent', 'version', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'interpretation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'NEVER', 'muderous/violent', 'side', 'killer', 'shame', 'However', 'just', 'personal', 'preference-', 'suppose', 'movie', 'writers', 'never', 'intended', 'focus', 'murderous', 'side', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'wanted', 'keep', 'things', 'authentic', 'concerning', 'myths', 'legends.Other', 'alright', 'film', 'geez', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'had', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'seriously', 'guy', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'playing', 'supposed', 'suspense']",The Lodger VHS
352383,A3TYZ9IA0O4HI6,6303042198,Benjamin O. Simmons,"[1, 1]","Title: The LodgerRelease Date: 1926Running time: 89 minutes (Brentwood DVD edition)Directed by: Alfred HitchcockStarring: Ivor Novello as Jonathan Drew (The Lodger)June Tripp as Daisy BuntingMalcolm Keen as Detective Joe ChandlerMarie Ault as Mrs. BuntingArthur Chesney as Mr. BuntingLandmark silent feature by Hitchcock; considered by the director and many film buffs to be first example of the ""Hitchcock style"" of film making.  The movie is a mystery/suspense film based on a novel by Mrs. Belloc Lowndes which was inspired by the murders of Jack The Ripper.  The story details the fear and paranoia created by a series of murders of young blonde-haired women in London by a killer known as ""The Avenger"".  The killer strikes on Tuesday nights and leaves a calling card (literaly) in the shape of a triangle with ""The Avenger"" written on it atop his victims bodies.The movie opens with the killing of The Avenger's seventh victim and the immediate reaction to it as the news spreads across London.  On the same night of the murder, a mysterious man appears at the front door of a home owned by the Bunting's, an elderly couple with an attractive blonde-haired daughter named Daisy.  The man rents a room from the family and soon moves in upstairs.  Daisy is smitten by the new lodger (played by London stage star/composer/playwrite Novello in an effectively creepy performance)which leads to a jealous reaction by Det. Joe Chandler, who himself desires to be with Daisy.  Chandler soon finds himself assigned to the Avenger case, and through a series of events, comes to believe that the new lodger is in fact the murderer.  Daisy's parents, particularly her mother (played by Ault in a good performance), also begin to believe that the man may be the killer.  The movie builds to an exciting climax involving an enraged mob which leads to the resolution of the story.  It is interesting that Hitchcock preferred to leave the ending up in the air, making the viewer decide whether the lodger was in fact The Avenger, but due to Novello's intense popularity with the English public, he was forced to resolve the film--with an ending that deffered from the novel's--in a way that would please the audience.The movie features many things that would later become trademarks of Hitchcock's films.  For instance the subject matter (a wrongly accused person being hounded by society), the camera techniques (including the way in which he shows the lodger pacing in his room above the Bunting's living area by showing the chandelier swaying back and forth on the ceiling while overlapping the image with a shot of Novello walking back and forth that was filmed from below through a specially designed plate-glass floor), the prevalence of blonde actresses in the movie, and the first on-screen appearance of the director (He appears in two scenes.  The first is in a newsroom scene early in the picture and the second is during the climatic mob scene when he can be seen leaning against the railing as the lodger is rescued).  The scene where Daisy is taking a bath while Novello is at the bathroom door also brings to mind Hitchcock's shower scene from Psycho.  Perhaps the most famous scene in this film occurs 15 minutes into the movie when Novello makes his first appearance.  The image of him emerging from the London fog as Mrs. Bunting opens the front door makes one's spine tingle.  It's ironic that the production company that made the film refused to release it for several months because they thought it was a terrible movie.  They forced Hitchcock to redo a couple of the scenes and then released it to the public.  The movie became an instant hit and was heralded as one of the greatest British films ever released up to that time.  The movie also made an instant star out of Hitchcock, who would make six more silent films before returning to the suspense genre with his first talkie, ""Blackmail"" in 1929.Overall this was a very enjoyable movie which should be a part of any serious movie buff's collection.  The version that I saw was a low priced DVD by Brentwood Productions.  The overall quality was decent, but the transfer was jumpy and overexposed in places.  Still it was very watchable.  Hopefully one day soon the movie will be fully restored and released on DVD with extras included.",4,The Lodger (1926),1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,4303,"['Title', 'LodgerRelease', 'Date', '1926Running', 'time', '89', 'minutes', 'Brentwood', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Directed', 'Alfred', 'HitchcockStarring', 'Ivor', 'Novello', 'Jonathan', 'Drew', 'Lodger', 'June', 'Tripp', 'Daisy', 'BuntingMalcolm', 'Keen', 'Detective', 'Joe', 'ChandlerMarie', 'Ault', 'Mrs.', 'BuntingArthur', 'Chesney', 'Mr.', 'BuntingLandmark', 'silent', 'feature', 'Hitchcock', 'considered', 'director', 'many', 'film', 'buffs', 'be', 'first', 'example', 'Hitchcock', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'movie', 'mystery/suspense', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Mrs.', 'Belloc', 'Lowndes', 'was', 'inspired', 'murders', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'story', 'details', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'created', 'series', 'murders', 'young', 'blonde-haired', 'women', 'London', 'killer', 'known', 'Avenger', 'killer', 'strikes', 'Tuesday', 'nights', 'calling', 'card', 'literaly', 'shape', 'triangle', 'Avenger', 'written', 'atop', 'victims', 'bodies.The', 'movie', 'killing', 'Avenger', 'seventh', 'victim', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'news', 'London', 'same', 'night', 'murder', 'mysterious', 'man', 'front', 'door', 'home', 'owned', 'Bunting', 'elderly', 'couple', 'attractive', 'blonde-haired', 'daughter', 'named', 'Daisy', 'man', 'room', 'family', 'soon', 'moves', 'upstairs', 'Daisy', 'smitten', 'new', 'lodger', 'played', 'London', 'stage', 'star/composer/playwrite', 'Novello', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'performance', 'jealous', 'reaction', 'Det', 'Joe', 'Chandler', 'who', 'be', 'Daisy', 'Chandler', 'soon', 'assigned', 'Avenger', 'case', 'series', 'events', 'believe', 'new', 'lodger', 'fact', 'murderer', 'Daisy', 'parents', 'particularly', 'mother', 'played', 'Ault', 'good', 'performance', 'also', 'begin', 'believe', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'killer', 'movie', 'exciting', 'climax', 'involving', 'enraged', 'mob', 'resolution', 'story', 'interesting', 'Hitchcock', 'preferred', 'leave', 'ending', 'up', 'air', 'making', 'viewer', 'lodger', 'was', 'fact', 'Avenger', 'due', 'Novello', 'intense', 'popularity', 'English', 'public', 'was', 'forced', 'resolve', 'film', 'ending', 'deffered', 'novel', 'way', 'would', 'please', 'audience.The', 'movie', 'many', 'things', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'trademarks', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'instance', 'subject', 'matter', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'person', 'being', 'hounded', 'society', 'camera', 'techniques', 'including', 'way', 'lodger', 'pacing', 'room', 'Bunting', 'living', 'area', 'showing', 'chandelier', 'swaying', 'back', 'forth', 'ceiling', 'overlapping', 'image', 'shot', 'Novello', 'walking', 'back', 'forth', 'was', 'filmed', 'specially', 'designed', 'plate-glass', 'floor', 'prevalence', 'blonde', 'actresses', 'movie', 'first', 'on-screen', 'appearance', 'director', 'two', 'scenes', 'first', 'newsroom', 'scene', 'early', 'picture', 'second', 'climatic', 'mob', 'scene', 'when', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'leaning', 'railing', 'lodger', 'rescued', 'scene', 'where', 'Daisy', 'taking', 'bath', 'Novello', 'bathroom', 'door', 'also', 'mind', 'Hitchcock', 'shower', 'scene', 'Psycho', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'scene', 'film', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'Novello', 'first', 'appearance', 'image', 'emerging', 'London', 'fog', 'Mrs.', 'Bunting', 'front', 'door', 'one', 'spine', 'tingle', 'ironic', 'production', 'company', 'made', 'film', 'refused', 'release', 'several', 'months', 'thought', 'was', 'terrible', 'movie', 'forced', 'Hitchcock', 'redo', 'couple', 'scenes', 'then', 'released', 'public', 'movie', 'became', 'instant', 'hit', 'was', 'heralded', 'one', 'greatest', 'British', 'films', 'ever', 'released', 'up', 'time', 'movie', 'also', 'made', 'instant', 'star', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'six', 'more', 'silent', 'films', 'returning', 'suspense', 'genre', 'first', 'talkie', 'Blackmail', '1929.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'serious', 'movie', 'buff', 'collection', 'version', 'saw', 'was', 'low', 'priced', 'DVD', 'Brentwood', 'Productions', 'overall', 'quality', 'was', 'decent', 'transfer', 'was', 'jumpy', 'overexposed', 'places', 'Still', 'was', 'very', 'watchable', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'soon', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'fully', 'restored', 'released', 'DVD', 'extras', 'included']",The Lodger VHS

It turns out that it has several including a very excellent commentary track by a film historian quite familiar with Hitchcock's work.Story synopsis: A serial killer is seeking blonde girls as his victims in London. A strange lodger moves into a rented room. The man goes out on foggy nights, keeps a photo of an unidentified blonde girl in his room, and flirts with the landlady's daughter, Daisy, who just happens to be blonde. Daisy's boyfriend is a police detective, and jealousy arouses his suspicion more than it might normally be stirred.

Numerous customers tried several sets only to see some problems in all of the sets and finally just give up and demand a refund. This disc was one of the four particularly ""troubled discs"" in this set, so you should approach with caution, although my disc has arrived and played trouble-free.One theory about the problems is the tight wrapping on the packaging in the big Hitchcock set is warping discs and causing them to freeze, make horrendous grinding noises, or just not play at all.

352385,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,6303042198,Chip Kaufmann,"[2, 2]","THE LODGER was Alfred Hitchcock's first big success and set the pattern for many of his future films. It also marks the first of his cameo appearances (there are two). Up until now, at least in the U.S., there have been no decent copies of THE LODGER available to see. It has been lovingly restored for this edition perhaps TOO lovingly as, in my opinion, this version has a few minor problems even though it's likely to be the best version available for many years to come.Having spent his formative film years in Germany at UFA studios, Hitchcock wanted to use German Expressionistic techniques in his first mystery thriller. The title cards resemble THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI while the look of the film owes much to Fritz Lang especially his DR MABUSE movies. This restoration bathes the film in yellow and blue tints typical of the silent era but they appear a trifle oversaturated. The speed transfer seems unnaturally slow in places giving THE LODGER the look of a fever dream. This may have been Hitch's intentions but I don't think so. It looks more as if the film speed has been overcorrected much like Milestone's release of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA from a few years back.A key component to silent film enjoyment is the background music score and here this PREMIERE COLLECTION edition got it right. The cheap public domain copies of THE LODGER which have been around for years have cheap public domain music to go along with them. This restored edition gives you two recent scores to choose from, a 1997 one by Paul Zaza and a 1999 one by Ashley Irwin. Both are very good and set the mood nicely. Most reviewers seem to prefer the Irwin score but I like the one by Zaza which incorporates familiar classical and popular tunes better.",4,A New Restoration Of Hitchcock's First Big Success.,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,1740,"['LODGER', 'was', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'first', 'big', 'success', 'set', 'pattern', 'many', 'future', 'films', 'also', 'first', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'are', 'two', 'now', 'least', 'U.S.', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'copies', 'THE', 'LODGER', 'available', 'see', 'been', 'lovingly', 'restored', 'edition', 'perhaps', 'TOO', 'lovingly', 'opinion', 'version', 'few', 'minor', 'problems', 'even', 'likely', 'be', 'best', 'version', 'available', 'many', 'years', 'come.Having', 'spent', 'formative', 'film', 'years', 'Germany', 'UFA', 'studios', 'Hitchcock', 'wanted', 'use', 'German', 'Expressionistic', 'techniques', 'first', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'title', 'cards', 'resemble', 'CABINET', 'OF', 'DR', 'CALIGARI', 'look', 'film', 'owes', 'much', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'especially', 'DR', 'MABUSE', 'movies', 'restoration', 'film', 'yellow', 'blue', 'tints', 'typical', 'silent', 'era', 'appear', 'trifle', 'oversaturated', 'speed', 'transfer', 'unnaturally', 'slow', 'places', 'giving', 'THE', 'LODGER', 'look', 'fever', 'dream', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Hitch', 'intentions', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'more', 'film', 'speed', 'been', 'overcorrected', 'much', 'Milestone', 'release', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'few', 'years', 'back.A', 'key', 'component', 'silent', 'film', 'enjoyment', 'background', 'music', 'score', 'here', 'PREMIERE', 'COLLECTION', 'edition', 'got', 'right', 'cheap', 'public', 'domain', 'copies', 'THE', 'LODGER', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'have', 'cheap', 'public', 'domain', 'music', 'go', 'along', 'restored', 'edition', 'two', 'recent', 'scores', 'choose', '1997', 'one', 'Paul', 'Zaza', '1999', 'one', 'Ashley', 'Irwin', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'set', 'mood', 'nicely', 'Most', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'prefer', 'Irwin', 'score', 'like', 'one', 'Zaza', 'familiar', 'classical', 'popular', 'tunes', 'better']",The Lodger VHS
352386,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303042198,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 7]","I am a relative newcomer to silent films, so I can not pontificate on all of the nuances and wonderful subtleties The Lodger surely showcases.  I can say that I enjoyed this film very much; the story retained its vigor throughout, and some of my preconceived notions regarding the conclusion were proven quite wrong.  The Lodger bears the unmistakable influence of the Jack the Ripper murders.  A number of fair-haired young ladies have been murdered on successive Tuesday nights in London, and the police basically have no clue as to the killer's identity.  On the heels of the sixth murder, a stranger comes seeking a room at the lodging house of an elderly couple.  The woman is put ill at ease immediately, and who could blame her?  The mysterious lodger makes his appearance standing at the door with a scarf covering the lower part of his face, looking amazingly just like Bela Lugosi would look several years later when he made his grand entrance in Dracula.  He's a little strange, taking down all the pictures of fair-haired girls in his room, but the kindly old woman's suspicions are raised significantly when she witnesses her strange boarder sneaking out for a half hour on the next Tuesday night, returning just after a fresh murder had been committed down the street.  The couple worries about their daughter Daisy, who has taken a definite shine to the strange young man (to the chagrin of her traditional suitor, who happens to be a detective assigned to the serial killer hunt).  Determined to keep Daisy away from possible danger, her parents nevertheless manage to let her go out with the lodger the next Tuesday night, and this serves as the setup for the culminating scenes wherein Daisy's long-time suitor/detective accuses the stranger of being the wanted serial killer known as The Avenger.It is something of a strange experience to watch a silent movie.  I always wonder what the actors are actually saying; they talk up a storm, yet we are shown only scattered fragments of their conversations.  The actors all play their roles to great excess, seemingly overemphasizing their expressions to help make up for the lack of actual dialogue.  Sometimes their faces are completely bleached out as the quality of the picture varies.  Frankly, I had not even thought about Alfred Hitchcock having made silent movies early in his career, but The Lodger, his third silent film (although Hitchcock essentially chose not to count the first two), displays the genius Hitchcock would become famous for.  There are several scenes that seemed quite impressive for a film made in 1926: early on, there is an interesting montage of faces blending from one to another; in one scene, the camera pans up and we see the ceiling disappear to show us the pacing strides of the lodger up above; and toward the end we witness a series of images pan across the ground as a character looks down in deep thought.I was quite impressed by The Lodger.  The basic story is clearly delineated despite the lack of dialogue, the direction is masterful, and the ending is in no way anticlimactic.  I admit I sometimes found myself making up dialogue for the actors and actresses, but by the midway point I was so absorbed in the story that I forgot about it being a silent movie and just sat back and let myself become absorbed in the growing drama.

352387,A366S12KCZ280V,6303042198,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","In his long career ""The Lodger"" was only the third movie to ever be directed by Alfred Hitchcock. But it is the first of what would become a long line of suspense films Hitchcock made in that long career. Hitchcock would go on to be called the Master of Suspense. Not surprising when you look at the list of movies to his credit. From ""The 39 Steps"" to ""Notorious"" to ""Strangers On A Train"" to ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" to ""Rear Window"" to ""North By Northwest"" and on and on it is easy to see why he was considered the master of that genre of film.""The Lodger"" was the first made in that long line. Filmed in 1927 it was a silent film. Many people forget that Hitchcock started his career as a movie director during the silent era. While this may have been only the third film he directed with ""The Lodger"" you can start to see the genius as a story teller Hitchcock was. That is not to say this would rank as one of the best films he made but the movie, that Hitchcock considered his first real movie, would help display what kind of director Hitchcock was destine to become. This is a story that will keep you in suspense and anticipating what is going to happen next with a surprise ending that you won't see coming.For anyone who is a fan of Hitchcock this is a must see. Especially if you have never seen any of his films from the silent era. Of course when you watch make sure to be on the lookout for Hitch. He in fact makes a couple of brief appearances in the movie. Just remember he will look younger and a few pounds lighter as you search for him. In fact I would recommend if you are interested in seeing some of his other silent films to get the DVD box set ""Alfred Hitchcock: The Legend Begins"". You can read my review on that here on Amazon. Instead of paying over $20 to get a copy of just ""The Lodger"" for as little as about $5 you can get ""The Legend Begins"" which includes not only ""The Lodger"" but 19 other movies, including a couple of other Hitchcock's silent films, in the set.

352388,ADQU6C7DE6VD2,6303042198,J. Faulk,"[6, 8]","You've probably seen The Lodger as a tired old black and white print. So glory be: Here's the refurbished print with sepia, blue, and rose tints restored and a music score (by Ashley Irwin, 1999) that powerfully supports the drama. At last you can really enjoy this landmark film, which is just one good idea after another.The Supplements are worthwhile, but mostly boil down to Hitchcock's biography, even ""The Making of..."" featurette. There's only about a half-dozen anecdotes about making the film that have accumulated over the years. A half-hour radio dramatization of The Lodger is included, with Herbert Marshall as narrator and lodger, characterized as a religious fanatic; before it can be concluded, ""Hitchcock"" interrupts Mr. Marshall so there is no resolution.Let's probe our four principals a bit. The mother Marie Ault had just done two popular ""Rat"" pictures with Ivor Novello, so this casting was a lure to bring British audiences to The Lodger. She and father Arthur Chesney enjoyed long movie and tv careers. In spite of his smooth pate, Chesney should remind you of his brother, Edmund Gwynne. Detective Malcolm Keene also appeared many times on movie and tv screens. The daughter June made only a few films, probably by her choice. Online I do find one photo of her as a dancer, likely a solo dancer as suggested by her solo name.Ivor Novello was already a matinee idol when he made The Lodger. That's why the original novel (The Lodger) and the stage play (Who Is He?) were modified to make the protagonist sympathetic. Ivor's films span 1919-1934. In the 1930s and 40s he wrote and starred in elaborate musicals in the West End, generally of Ruritanian flavor. To be noted, his beautiful singing voice deserted him at puberty, so in the musicals he was Prince Charming while the ladies vocalized. In his movie period Ivor had a brief stint at MGM, but the execs found him to be, well, not quite Kosher--well, to be blunt, GAY. So they squirreled him away to write the script for Tarzan the Ape Man. Remember ""Me Tarzan, you Jane""? Well, Ivor wrote that, and was left so parched he went back to England for his cup of tea. In 1951, after curtain calls, he went up to his flat above the theater, suffered a coronary seizure, and died. His buddy had to rush to Ivor's country home to burn papers and photos to spare Ivor & Friends ruinous embarrassment.So come on, You there, join the Lodger in his sepia digs, two spacious rooms, tea and bread and butter, and hum ""We'll Gather Lilacs"" while Ivor princes about. Trust me, he wouldn't hurt a fly.",5,"Hey Lodger!  Come down and visit me sometime.

352389,A2N1GYD8Y22WG8,6303042198,"J. Schmidt ""Classics Caper""","[2, 2]","Fortunately for all Hitchcock and silent film fans, MGM has released this cinematic achievement on DVD. This newly restored version looks great considering its age, and the minor film flicker and dots on the screen are not distracting from the movie at all. Most everyone already knows the story, basically Hitchcock has taken the Jack the Ripper story and played around with it to create this suspenseful movie about a mysterious lodger who is suspected by his landlords of being an infamous London serial killer. The film is classic Hitchcock, loaded with intrigue and wonderful camera shots.The DVD itself is excellent as well. There is some juicy extras including a featurette on the making of the movie, Hitchcock audio interviews, and a 1940 radio play directed by Hitch himself. Another much appreciated extra is the two soundtracks to choose from. I would definitely go with the more classic and fitting 1999 score by Ashley Irwin. While the 1997 score by Paul Zaza is eerie in parts, it overall does not mesh with this 1926 film which benefits from the ""older"" sound of the dramatic 1999 Irwin score. Another interesting thing to note is that while Amazon lists the runtime as 83mins, this DVD has the uncut 100min version. In addition, the DVD includes a nice insert which gives a little bit of a backstory and includes a scene index. The DVD packaging and design is very appealing along with the rest of the Hitchcock films released by the Fox/MGM team. Also, unlike the discs from the Hitchcock Premiere Collection box set, none of these individually released discs seem to be defective.All in all, i would recommend this great DVD to any Hitchcock fans or silent film lovers. While people who don't fall those two categories might still enjoy it, its hard to recommend it to everyone during this modern age of 3D visuals and booming sound effects. This DVD definitely will have you hearkening back to an older era of silence and shadows.

352390,A3HZRFQUGWOYAP,6303042198,Knoll360,"[0, 4]","Based off of the 1913 novel The Lodger by Marie Belloc Lowndes, here is a silent film with some positives but also a lot of negatives. The movie is about a serial killer in London who murders blond women and leaves a calling card. The killer goes by the name of ""The Avenger"". Jonathan Drew is renting out a room but seems incredibly strange so the family living in the house starts to wonder whether or not he is the killer. Without spoiling the ending I'll say that not very much really happens throughout the story until the last fifteen minutes which really makes the film drag on. In addition the film was originally going to have an ambiguous ending where it was never revealed whether or not Jonathan is innocent and I really wish that the film would have used the original ending.The acting is mediocre with Ivor Novello as Jonathan (the lodger) who seems really wooden in his portrayal. June Tripp seems to just smile a lot without using any acting skills in her portrayal of Daisy Bunting, the lodger's love interest in the film. Malcolm Keen on the other hand seems to do a good job as police officer Joe Chandler but he isn't great enough to be a standout. The best actors in the film are Marie Ault and Arthur Chesney as the landlords and they honestly do a great job even if it isn't spectacular.For special effects there are very many noteworthy ones. There is a shot where you can see the bottom of Jonathan's shoes as he walks upstairs and the camera looks up through the ceiling but it still isn't that amazing. The musical score seems out of place and repeats far too often without enough variety.So overall this film is worth watching if you are really interested in Alfred Hitchcock or the novel but otherwise this film isn't worth your time. It is truly a mediocre film and shows that Alfred Hitchcock had to work his way up to his later legendary status as a director for films such as Psycho (1960) or The Birds (1963).Score: 6/10",3,The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927),1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1954,"['Based', '1913', 'Lodger', 'Marie', 'Belloc', 'Lowndes', 'here', 'silent', 'film', 'positives', 'also', 'lot', 'negatives', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'London', 'who', 'blond', 'women', 'calling', 'card', 'killer', 'name', 'Avenger', 'Jonathan', 'Drew', 'renting', 'out', 'room', 'incredibly', 'strange', 'family', 'living', 'house', 'wonder', 'not', 'killer', 'spoiling', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'say', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'really', 'story', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'really', 'film', 'drag', 'addition', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'have', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'where', 'was', 'never', 'revealed', 'not', 'Jonathan', 'innocent', 'really', 'wish', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'original', 'ending.The', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'Ivor', 'Novello', 'Jonathan', 'lodger', 'who', 'really', 'wooden', 'portrayal', 'June', 'Tripp', 'just', 'smile', 'lot', 'using', 'acting', 'skills', 'portrayal', 'Daisy', 'Bunting', 'lodger', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'Malcolm', 'Keen', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'police', 'officer', 'Joe', 'Chandler', ""n't"", 'great', 'enough', 'be', 'standout', 'best', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'Marie', 'Ault', 'Arthur', 'Chesney', 'landlords', 'honestly', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'even', ""n't"", 'spectacular.For', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'many', 'noteworthy', 'ones', 'shot', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'bottom', 'Jonathan', 'shoes', 'upstairs', 'camera', 'up', 'ceiling', 'still', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'musical', 'score', 'place', 'repeats', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'enough', 'variety.So', 'overall', 'film', 'watching', 'are', 'really', 'interested', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'novel', 'otherwise', 'film', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'truly', 'mediocre', 'film', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'work', 'way', 'later', 'legendary', 'status', 'director', 'films', 'such', 'Psycho', '1960', 'Birds', '1963', '.Score', '6/10']",The Lodger VHS

From what I've read, the disks in the Premiere box set are very likely to be defective but that hasn't been the case with either of the two single titles from the collection that I own (the other being Sabotage). If you can snag a copy at a reasonable price (or want to try your luck with the collection), you're in for a treat.Although the third film that Hitchcock actually directed on his own, The Lodger is the first true ""Hitchcock film."" The American-trained Hitchcock not only directed his first film in Germany but was lucky enough to have worked there as well as an assistant director where he'd been able to observe F.W. Murnau at work. German expressionism's profound influence on the young Hitchcock is very evident in this tense, atmospheric film, the like of which had never been seen in British cinema. It was immediately recognized for the masterpiece it was and it's no less so when viewed today.Rather than synopsize The Lodger--which has already been done to death here--I'd like to elaborate on why this release is a must-have for not only Hitchcock fans but anyone who cares deeply about cinema. Of paramount importance is the restoration of the film itself. This is, quite simply, beautiful work. The print is as gorgeous as it comes for a title of this age. It manages to be clean and sharp without the extreme black boosting that renders darker detail virtually invisible, the integrity of the tinting has been maintained, and of course, scratches, dirt, and tears and warping have been corrected as much as possible without sanitizing the print's character. It is, in fact, so gorgeous and its presentation so compelling that one can't not watch it. Those who claim not to ""get"" silents, take note!The Lodger is packed with extras, rendering it terrific value (at list). I haven't bothered with the commentary but I have watched the film with both included soundtracks. The older one by Paul Zaza is excellent but the newer one by Ashley Irwin fits The Lodger like a glove and is the one I prefer. In addition, there's a restoration comparison, a still gallery, snippets of two audio interviews--one with Bogdanovich, one with Truffaut (both fascinating)--that specifically cover The Lodger, a very interesting featurette on the making of The Lodger, a 1940 radio play of The Lodger directed by Hitchcock (radio plays of popular films were very much the norm during the Golden Age of Cinema and utilized top talent), and a very cute featurette involving one of Hitchcock's granddaughters that was included as an extra with another Hitchcock title (possibly North by Northwest). Everything I've watched/listened to has been worthwhile.I can't recommend this release highly enough. I doubt Fox will re-release it in this format so grab it if you can.

352394,A1C58YXM2A30CY,6303042198,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[3, 3]","First off, the DVD made by MGM, The Lodger, The Story of the London Fog, is an amazingly great package they put together.Not only is this great silent picture meticulously restored, but you get two different scores to choose from, a funny story from Hitchcock's granddaughter Mary Stone, a Making Of featurette, two interviews with Hitchcock done in the early Sixties, commentary by film historian Patrick McGillian, and a 1940 radio show also directed by Hitchcock.OK, so I hear all the hype: the first Hitchcockian thriller, the best film to come out of Britain at that time, first rate, must see, etc.  Is it true?In watching the film, the first thing you note is the German Expressionist film artistry that Hitchcock picked up from his time in Germany during the time of F.W. Mirnau and other great silent directors of the time.  Their experimentation with light, tinting and shadow are evident.Hitchcock created his own brand though, can't accuse him of being a copycat!Briefly, the film starts out with a screaming woman with light-colored hair as she's being strangled, her hair all aglow.  On the side, we see a marquee ""To-Night Golden Curls.""  Prophetic.The Avenger is a serial killer loose in London.  The police are ineffective as this murderer kills any blondes he sees.  It gets so worried women purposely wear dark curls under their hats so they won't be mistaken for blondes!  ""No peroxide for me!"" one woman quips.The Avenger though as bad a mass murderer can be, is secondary to the character of the Lodger, played by British silent film star Ivor Novello, and his budding relationship with Daisy, who is unfortunately blonde, and who unfortunately for her police detective fianc&eacute;, is falling for the Lodger.The Lodger is not really given a name, which I thought was interesting.  The suspense builds as the landlady and then the ex-boyfriend police detective, Joe, begin to suspect that the Lodger is in fact the Avenger.  More and more clues are led up to a search warrant and the emptying of a mysterious satchel, the same kind of satchel that witnesses had said belonged to the Avenger.Inside, we view a map with little triangles all over it (where murders were committed) and newspaper clippings of the Avenger's bloody trail.  And a portrait!  ""Your first victim, eh?"" snarls Joe!Uh oh, doesn't look good for our man.  Daisy adores him and can't see the Lodger being any kind of murderer.  Is Daisy naive or is she about to be plucked?The artistry of the film is amazing.  The swinging ceiling lamp suggests pacing back and forth by the Lodger in his room.  We seem to see through the ceiling to see his nervous pacing.In fact, Hitchcock had a large six foot square thick pane of glass used to shoot through to the pacing young man, then super-imposed the glass image with the ceiling image.Suspense-building, such as the white hand that is slowly going down the staircase, as the Lodger is making a mysterious exit from the lodge to some unknown destination or errand.  The number on the lodge door:  13, naturally!History:Seeing the ""making of"" featurette was very educational.  You hear Hitchcock's own words about his German influence, and how the studios did not want their prize boy being accused of murder.  He states that he found the same with Cary Grant in ""Suspicion.""  No one wanted Cary to actually be the murderer.Despite the ""star system"" crimping his style, Hitchcock conveys all the mystery and suspense in this great silent picture, tints and all, Hitchcock's trademark personal cameos and the now-familiar themes of suspicion and mistaken identity are all here.Highly recommended.PS:  I also have the Laser Light DVD version.  That one is not restored and is difficult to see.
