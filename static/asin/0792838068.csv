Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are extraordinary in Leaving Las Vegas. Cage received an Oscar and Shue got a much-derserved nomination for best actress. I have always admired and liked Shue, she is a real and talented actress, she is good in every role even if it is a crummy movie. Cage's performance just blew me away, I knew he could act in Peggy Sue got Married but this is best and most appreciated role. They have amazing chemistry, they are electrfying together. Director Mike Figgis did a wonderful job, the opening credits and the musical score are fantastic. Leaving Las Vegas can be hard to watch but this is real and important film. One of my favorite dramas of all-time.

139803,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0792838068,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 8]","To me, this is one of the best romantic films that you can get your hands on.  If you are interested in seeing a pure love, one that is not focused purely on sex, but instead emotional and mental connectiveness, then this is the film for you.  While others will argue that this is not the best date film, I would beg to differ. Leaving Las Vegas would be a perfect choice for a first date film over anything that Meg Ryan or the recycle bin of Hollywood has to offer.  It is a gripping story of realistic love, and the dramatic consequences of giving your heart to someone.  It is about dreams, companionship, and the hurdles of everyday romance.  This is a film that proves that the darker underbelly of our society still has a shimmering light of hope and love.  Director Mike Figgis has done an outstanding job of giving these two rich characters the right elements to build upon the ""classic"" love-story moments, while giving it a flavor uniquely his own. Figgis' mixture of gritty Vegas with the beautiful jazz sounds really created the ambiance of love and pushed these two ugly ducklings closer towards their transformation into love. I think that is what really captured me on this film, was that it was similar to the love stories that Hollywood continually releases, except it gave us two tragic characters instead of these bubbly, money isn't everything, characters that seem to be repetitive cogs in the Hollywood machine.Let me explain this further.  When you think of a love story, what are the elements that you consider?  You have a guy and a girl (normally), they have this coincidental moment where they find their common bond, they are held back by either an internal or external dilemma, there is a factor of insecurity, and finally the dramatic ending where the two rush together at a predisclosed location (normally an airport).  Does that sound familiar in any way?  These are all elements that you can find in LLV.  I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and for some odd reason it was this viewing that it just seemed to click for me.  This is the perfect American love story told with a darker tone.  While most will see this as nothing more than the story of a drunk trying to kill himself and a graphic scenes with a prostitute, I saw it as the classic story of love.  All the elements are present.  Ben and Sera coincidentally meet one night, both seeking companionship and without the pressures of sex, they immediately form this bond that will never be broken.  Through Ben's drunkenness, he remembers her and continually wants to see her.  They both have internal factors that hold them back, Sera's is prostitution while Ben's is his drinking.  Even through there are these factors, they still find themselves together.  That feeling of insecurity is even there when Sera arrives home one night to find Ben with someone else.  It all seems to fit.  Then there is the amazing ending that will either have you in rapture or in awe.  These two are in love, and it isn't this bubbly love between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, it is truths of America finding the dream of compassion.The only unnecessary moments that I felt could have been fine-tuned were those involving Julian Sans.  I just couldn't capture his character.  I needed a bit more back-story or perhaps more interactions between him and Sera.  Something was missing that distracted from the scenes that they shared.  Outside of this one element, the rest of the film was purely flawless and even at times carnal.  For example, when Sera has the opportunity to be on her own, she chooses to forego her independence and be with Ben.  Shue and Figgis both demonstrate that perhaps Sera is not in love with Ben, but instead the concept of a man wanting to be with her because of who she is.  It is obvious that Sera seeks companionship, and probably has never had it all her life, when suddenly Ben struts into the picture.  This may explain why she continues to work when she doesn't have to.  She is used to the job, she thrives for the intensity, and perhaps uses it to fall deeper in love with Ben.  Figgis doesn't come out and give you a reason why Sera continues along her path, but instead leaves it up to your imagination and enjoyment.  Leaving Las Vegas felt like a combination Breaking the Waves, Love Liza, and All the Real Girls.  This is a love story with so many different human elements coming to you at once that the average viewer would probably ignore the signs and see this as a depressing film.  While it isn't the lightest film of the ages, it does prove that ""Love is a very splendid thing"".I cannot end this review without at least mentioning the amazing acting done by both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue.  The chemistry between them is rare in Hollywood.  I felt that these two really made this film and were just not placed in their roles to sell tickets.  Cage really felt comfortable and understood his character while Shue fit perfectly with her secrets and heart.  It is obvious why Cage won the Oscar for his role in this film, and while I am sure we will never see him take a role like this again (thanks to summer blockbusters), it was good to see him take a role that really redefined the romance genre.  The same goes for Shue.  While she hasn't really made another film like this one in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.Overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"Or, is killing myself a way of drinking?",1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,5549,"['one', 'best',

139806,A1GOI8745FGIDN,0792838068,"""an_avid_book_reviewer""","[2, 4]","I found this movie both funny and sad. I laughed at what a drunken [fool] the guy makes out of himself in public and at first I also found some humor in how much he drinks. He drinks in the shower, in the car, in the morning, at night, fills a whole shopping cart full of liquor, etc. But as the movie progresses, showing how serious his problem is, it's not funny anymore.So Ben the drunk has had his wife leave him already because of his drinking and now he gets fired. These loses in his life were probably both a factor in his continuing downward spiral and also a symptom of a greater problem. What exactly, his problem is, we never really find out. So he decides to go to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. There, he meets and develops a close relationship with a prostitute Sera.It was interesting how the two maintained a fairly strong relationship despite his insane drinking and the way she makes a living. She, by the way, moved to Vegas because there's more money there for prostitutes. We see sad scenes of her getttin abused physically and sexually in her job, so we understand that she too, while better off than him, is not living a happy life either. I felt bad for her especially in that scene where she is basically gang raped in a hotel room. Her job is risky enough, going into a room with an unknown man for sex. I felt she shouldn't have gone into one with several men there, and should always carry on her some type of weapon like a gun or even just brass knuckles-- anything. But, for 200 bucks an hour untaxed at a self-chosen job, she doesn't have the right to complain.They call it love, and if it was, then it was love at first sight. Right from the beginning she treated him differently than her usual customer and she even spent the night at his motel, which she soon pulls him from, enjoining him to live with her.Their relationship is based upon unconditional love; they accept one another as they are without even asking them to change. Ben even told her early on that she must never ask him to stop drinking. She does tearfully beg him to see a doctor, citing that this is the one and only thing she asks of him, which he won't do. He eventually drinks himself to death and the movie is slightly narrated by her comments to a therapist about the relationship. I kept hoping that since they love each other, she will try to help him and he will try to stop drinking since she gives him something to live for and he wouldn't want to hurt her. I kept hoping that they would ""leave las vegas"", that place that seems to both degenerate people and attract degenerates according to the movie, and they would live a happy life as a couple Apparently, his alcoholism was stronger than his love for her. While many people in her position would have tried stopping him from committing suicide, she was unselfish. She needed him desperately, out of loneliness and despair, yet she let him have his own choice. Of course the high difficulty if not impossibility of stopping him probably influenced her indifference of action. He was determined on his course. It's just so sad, all that happened to her and especially him. And more than that, it's sad to what happened to them as a couple. They seemed to have something special between them, but it would not last.",4,"Making viewers laugh some, but cry more.",1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,3287,"['found', 'movie', 'funny', 'sad', 'laughed', 'what', 'drunken', '[', 'fool', ']', 'guy', 'public', 'first', 'also', 'found', 'humor', 'how', 'much', 'shower', 'car', 'morning', 'night', 'whole', 'shopping', 'cart', 'full', 'liquor', 'etc', 'movie', 'showing', 'how', 'serious', 'problem', 'not', 'funny', 'anymore.So', 'Ben', 'drunk', 'had', 'wife', 'leave', 'already', 'drinking', 'now', 'fired', 'loses', 'life', 'were', 'probably', 'factor', 'continuing', 'downward', 'spiral', 'also', 'symptom', 'greater', 'problem', 'What', 'exactly', 'problem', 'never', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'So', 'go', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'drink', 'death', 'close', 'relationship', 'prostitute', 'Sera.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'how', 'two', 'maintained', 'fairly', 'strong', 'relationship', 'insane', 'drinking', 'way', 'living', 'way', 'moved', 'Vegas', 'more', 'money', 'there', 'prostitutes', 'see', 'sad', 'scenes', 'getttin', 'abused', 'physically', 'sexually', 'job', 'understand', 'too', 'better', 'not', 'living', 'happy', 'life', 'felt', 'bad', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'basically', 'gang', 'raped', 'hotel', 'room', 'job', 'risky', 'enough', 'going', 'room', 'unknown', 'man', 'sex', 'felt', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'one', 'several', 'men', 'there', 'should', 'always', 'carry', 'type', 'weapon', 'gun', 'even', 'just', 'brass', 'knuckles', 'anything', '200', 'bucks', 'hour', 'untaxed', 'self-chosen', 'job', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'complain.They', 'call', 'love', 'was', 'then', 'was', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Right', 'beginning', 'treated', 'differently', 'usual', 'customer', 'even', 'spent', 'night', 'motel', 'soon', 'enjoining', 'live', 'her.Their', 'relationship', 'based', 'unconditional', 'love', 'accept', 'one', 'are', 'even', 'asking', 'change', 'Ben', 'even', 'told', 'early', 'must', 'never', 'ask', 'stop', 'drinking', 'tearfully', 'beg', 'see', 'doctor', 'citing', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'eventually', 'death', 'movie', 'slightly', 'narrated', 'comments', 'therapist', 'relationship', 'kept', 'hoping', 'love', 'other', 'will', 'try', 'help', 'will', 'try', 'stop', 'drinking', 'something', 'live', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'kept', 'hoping', 'would', 'leave', 'las', 'vegas', 'place', 'degenerate', 'people', 'attract', 'degenerates', 'according', 'movie', 'would', 'live', 'happy', 'life', 'couple', 'Apparently', 'alcoholism', 'was', 'stronger', 'love', 'many', 'people', 'position', 'would', 'have', 'tried', 'stopping', 'committing', 'suicide', 'was', 'unselfish', 'needed', 'desperately', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'yet', 'let', 'have', 'own', 'choice', 'course', 'high', 'difficulty', 'not', 'impossibility', 'stopping', 'probably', 'influenced', 'indifference', 'action', 'was', 'determined', 'course', 'just', 'so', 'sad', 'happened', 'especially', 'more', 'sad', 'what', 'happened', 'couple', 'seemed', 'have', 'something', 'special', 'would', 'not', 'last']",N/A
139807,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792838068,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I just want to say this right off the bat; I honestly think that 1995 has seriously got to be one of the greatest years of film in recent history.  There are just so many cinematic gems to be found within that particular year, and `Leaving Las Vegas' is truly one of them.  I will admit that I was skeptical at first.  I am not a fan of Nicholas Cage, not in the least.  He is a very mannered, `actorly' type of an actor; you know the type that always appears to be acting.  I prefer my actors to sink into the rawness of their roles.  Look at Crowe for instance, a chameleon type actor who never seems to be acting as much as he is simply `being'.  That, and it also seems very hard for Cage to emote any fluctuation in emotion; he just comes off one note.  I adored him in `Matchstick Men', a film that embellished his mannerisms and made them work to his advantage; and I loved him in `Adaptation', a performance that he openly attests to his going contrary to everything he's build his acting career on.  In other words, he played the character as if he was a different actor, and it worked beautifully.Those two stellar performances aside and Nicholas Cage is a mediocre at best actor in my eyes.  So you can understand why watching yet another Cage film was not really that appealing to me.Well, I'll just say that I am extremely glad that I decided to give it a go.`Leaving Las Vegas' is responsible, not only for Cage's finest performance, but is honestly his finest film; ever.  Yes, it is bleak and depressing and ultimately heartbreaking, but it is so emotionally connected without being overly sappy and or too heavy handed.As a quick side point, that is another wonderful thing about the films of 1995; they are truly effecting without being spoonfuls of sympathy.  Films like `Leaving Las Vegas' and the overwhelmingly fantastic `Dead Man Walking' are able to crawl inside the viewer and grab hold of their beating heart with a realness and rawness that reflects real life and not Hollywood's overly saccharine fabrication of it.Anyways; back to the film.  `Leaving Las Vegas' centers on a relationship that forms between as alcoholic mess of a man named Ben and a `hooker with a heart' named Sera.  Ben has lost everything to his drinking, or is it that he starting drinking because he lost everything...either way, he has nothing except the bottle and so he decides to cash out all his savings and put himself up in Vegas to drink himself to death.  The end looks gloomy and bitter for Ben, but he winds up meeting Sera and things start to change for him.  Sera is tired and lonely and just needs someone to talk to, and when Ben pays her to just sit and talk she realizes that she needs him as much as he needs her.  He tells her his plan and warns her not to try and ask him to change, that he will never stop drinking, and she allows herself to comply because she needs to be with him, but as they come closer with one another her love for Ben starts to tear away at her commitment to him.It feels weird for me to say this, but the strongest facet of this film is the acting.  Cage embodies Ben with such rawness and accuracy.  I remember when I watched Meg Ryan devour her character in `When a Man Loves a Woman'; how she really soaked up her characters addiction.  That is what Cage does here.  His shakes and stutters and tantrums are so real, so believable and ultimately so heart wrenching.  As good (or even great) as Cage is, Elizabeth Shue is a revelation.Another quick side point about 1995 in general; it was truly an astonishing year for leaving ladies.  The entire Oscar shortlist is beyond compare when stacked up against their usual picks for each and every performance nominated is worthy, even if I would replace one or two.  Shue, Sarandon, Streep, Thompson, Stone...all of them are flawless and deserving of an Oscar (especially Shue and Sarandon) but there was Kidman in `To Die For' and even Silverstone in `Clueless' (such a fantastic comedic performance).  I mean really, 1995 is above and beyond stellar.Sorry bout that.  Back to the film, or more importantly, back to Shue.  Elizabeth Shue is not my favorite actress either.  She is decent, but hardly ever mind blowing.  I think that is what makes her performance all the more unbelievable good.  As Sera, Shue captures the fading light in her eyes that starts to shine brighter when she finds Ben.  In Ben she sees someone that needs her, and I mean really needs her.  She is used to having men `need' her in ways that degrade her, but Ben truly `needs' her and that truth fleshes out the real woman that is Sera.  Her performance is a true `tour-de-force' if I ever saw one and unbelievable moving and touching.In its final frames `Leaving Las Vegas' attacks the viewer and strips them so-to-speak of everything they have inside.  The film is a tragic yet beautifully accurate representation of the disease that is alcoholism and the effect it has on a human spirit.  Contrary to `When a Man Loves a Woman'; a film that sported a fabulous performance yet fell into the trap of Hollywood induced clich&eacute;s, `Leaving Las Vegas' allows the bleak realities of human tragedy to ring true, and the effect it a much further reaching and effecting film.  In the end, Ben finally leaves Las Vegas, but Las Vegas will never leave us.",5,"It may go down smooth, but it burns when it hits your heart...",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,5324,"['just', 'want',

As human beings, we consistently put the highest premium on our being alive. Experiencing the intensity of a despondent Nicolas Cage committed to taking his life by drinking himself to death, can trigger off a question as to what can prepare someone for such an act of self-destruction. Intriguingly enough we get no clear answers though there is a clear hint as to it might have been a profound sense of loss or failure.Singular focus on the moribund obsessions of Cage would be gross injustice to the incredibly touching love and empathy that he shares with the lead female protagonist - Elisabeth Shue - who plays a hooker's role with levels of dexterity rarely attained. There is a very deep understanding and mutual acceptance between the two lead characters that is in many ways the true highlight of this movie. Interestingly, we see no reasons for this to exist but such is the articulacy of characterization that not even for a second does one find this profound relationship unrealistic.'Leaving Las Vegas' is an iconoclastic love story whose control over the audience is fascinating. Such is the brilliance of the performances that you feel a lump in your heart by the end of the movie - and this lump transcends into the depths of your being - to stay there and to remind you that unconditional love exists and so does the capability to invite your own death to walk up to you - gradually and consistently. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a movie that would haunt you for its portrayal of love intertwined with morbid realities of life.",5,A Lump of Gloom,1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,1682,"['Watching', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'can', 'be', 'experience', 'gloomy', 'sadness', 'interiors', 'existence', 'immersed', 'human', 'beings', 'consistently', 'put', 'highest', 'premium', 'being', 'alive', 'Experiencing', 'intensity', 'despondent', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'committed', 'taking', 'life', 'drinking', 'death', 'can', 'trigger', 'off', 'question', 'what', 'can', 'prepare', 'someone', 'act', 'self-destruction', 'Intriguingly', 'get', 'clear', 'answers', 'clear', 'hint', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'profound', 'sense', 'loss', 'failure.Singular', 'focus', 'moribund', 'obsessions', 'Cage', 'would', 'be', 'gross', 'injustice', 'incredibly', 'touching', 'love', 'empathy', 'shares', 'lead', 'female', 'protagonist', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'who', 'hooker', 'role', 'levels', 'dexterity', 'rarely', 'attained', 'very', 'deep', 'understanding', 'mutual', 'acceptance', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'many', 'ways', 'true', 'highlight', 'movie', 'Interestingly', 'see', 'reasons', 'exist', 'such', 'articulacy', 'characterization', 'not', 'even', 'second', 'one', 'find', 'profound', 'relationship', 'unrealistic', ""'Leaving"", 'Las', 'Vegas', 'iconoclastic', 'love', 'story', 'control', 'audience', 'fascinating', 'Such', 'brilliance', 'performances', 'feel', 'lump', 'heart', 'end', 'movie', 'lump', 'depths', 'being', 'stay', 'there', 'remind', 'unconditional', 'love', 'exists', 'so', 'capability', 'invite', 'own', 'death', 'walk', 'up', 'gradually', 'consistently', ""'Leaving"", 'Las', 'Vegas', 'movie', 'would', 'haunt', 'portrayal', 'love', 'intertwined', 'morbid', 'realities', 'life']",N/A

He meets a prostitute with her own problems and the two make a human connection at the absolute lowest points of their lives.Told with unflinching, often brutal, honesty, these two people are revealed in the courageous performances by Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. Cage and Shue have nailed their parts through the heart and the guts. He is, somewhere under it all, a good man, unable and unwilling to stop his self-destruction. Cage has this guy down, an alcoholic so far gone in his addiction that he can't stop drinking some form of alcohol for more than minutes. Shue matches his performance all the way as a pretty woman who has taken her own self-destructive slide for reasons we don't know. What we see of her work puts the lie to the Hollywood ""happy-go-lucky hooker"" once and for all, showing the danger and degradation in the life. She is abused when she has a pimp, but is in more dangerous territory without one.This is not a film for the faint-hearted, or those who see film as only ""entertainment"". This is tough stuff, so if all you want is to be made happy, save your money and skip this one. For others, like myself, you will find a film that doesn't ""look away"" at the ugliness, but somehow finds the humanity and the sad, lost worth of these people beneath it. These two see something in each other, discover a final caring they had buried beneath the hard bark and numbness of addiction and emotionless sex.No happy ending, either folks. Cage disintegrates before our eyes, and Shue has found feelings within her hard shell, but will it transform her? We can hope, but we don't know.Brilliantly acted and directed, both leads were nominated and Cage won the Academy Award. Shue was equally deserving. Mike Figgis was true to the material and made an exceptionally honest film, capturing the cold glitter of Las Vegas and providing a haunting score. I found Sting's ""My One and Only Love"" especially effecting in this context.I found this film devastating when I originally saw it. The scenes of Cage drunk and embarrassing himself in public were harsh and true. When he gets his stated dream of Shue pouring liquor down her [chest] for him by the pool, in the next instant he falls through the glass table ruining everything. He moves relentlessly to a touching but starkly unglamorous end. Shue's rape is brutal and the callousness she receives afterward is chilling. This film never flinches, and for that, many will dislike it. Seeing the DVD now, has reminded me again of the power of its honesty.Ultimately, a story of the loneliness of the human soul and the need to make some kind of contact with another human being, this searing, sad and knowing drama is well worthwhile for many reasons, if you've a mind for a different story, a strange kind of love story if you will.

For their absolutely mediocre performances, Nicolas Cage won it, and Elisabeth Shue got nominated. Somehow, there must be a link between alcohol/sex and the members of the Academy. Let me tell you: anyone can play a drunk, and it takes no talent to pull it off. And anyone can play a hooker, and it takes no talent to pull it off.

139814,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,0792838068,Barry C. Chow,"[38, 71]","I've never before followed up an Amazon review with a postscript, but the more provocative comments being made on this site promoting this pretentious piece of twaddle simply demand a reply.A lot has been said about this film being an exploration of suffering; total commitment; selfless love; redemption earned through unreserved devotion; two moths drawn to the flame, doomed to suffering or death, but finding solace--even nobility--in their unconditional love for each other.Along with this is the oblique implication that anyone who can't feel empathy for two such tragic figures is either a brute, a cad or a cynic.It is with this last charge that all self-respecting dissidents should take issue.If ""Leaving Las Vegas"" were really about the aforementioned qualities, I wouldn't object to it with nearly the intensity that I feel. But this film is not about such qualities. Or rather, it hijacks such qualities to mask a viewpoint that is ultimately ignoble and hypocritical. In short, it is a con, replete with all the tricks and sleights of hand that Hollywood has used over the years to mislead and manipulate.This film is about two Beautiful People play-acting at being a drunk and a prostitute. The man self-destructs not for any understandable or even discernable reason, but because it is demanded by the plot. The woman prostitutes herself not because her life has skidded to rock bottom, but because prostitution is an old dodge that Hollywood can always rely on to provoke prurience.I defy the film's apologists to deny any of this.If this film was really as high-minded and spiritual as its defenders claim, then it should assume this challenge: replace Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue with two ugly actors. Make them fat and wrinkled with bad teeth and dirty unkempt hair. The drunk would possess none of his boyish charm, but would behave loutishly and incoherently while drunk, and continually beat the woman. The prostitute would be incapable of words longer than two syllables, and would be habitually spaced out on crack. Let's see if ""unconditional love"" and ""total commitment"" will rise above authentic real-life obstacles that truly test such starry-eyed notions. If the film garners the same reviews after such a dose of reality, then detractors like I will concede its high-mindedness and spirituality.But this film is not high-minded. It is not spiritual. It RELIES on the physical attractiveness, the charisma and the absurdly erudite conduct of its two stars to hook us. We witness not the tragedy of two spent and broken souls, but the machinations of the Hollywood glam factory reinventing two of its most Beautiful People into make-believe losers. We are supposed to go along with this hypocritical charade and feel sorry for... whom? Who is it we feel sorry for? Is it for the real Bens and Seras of the world? Or is it for the dashing Nicholas Cage and the gorgeous Elizabeth Shue?This film is more than simply bad. I resent it because it whitewashes despair. It trivializes tragedy. It turns suffering, grief and death from an agonizing spiritual journey into a soft-porn fairy-tale of perfect teeth, perfect looks and perfect tans. I resent it because it demands my empathy for unworthy reasons. And when it fails on its merits, it has the gall to try milking my tears with overt manipulation and some of the tawdriest tricks in the book (Sera's parting gift to Ben is the act of love on his deathbed--giving a whole new meaning to ""Angel"").I won't claim that this movie won't appeal to its target audience. All of the breathless reviews on this site prove otherwise. But those who wonder why its detractors dislike it so much should consider that our rejection stems not from lack of perception or feeling, but rather, from an abundance of those very qualities.",1,We Deserve Better,1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,3801,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'before', 'followed', 'up', 'Amazon', 'review', 'postscript', 'more', 'provocative', 'comments', 'being', 'made', 'site', 'promoting', 'pretentious', 'piece', 'twaddle', 'simply', 'demand', 'reply.A', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'being', 'exploration', 'suffering', 'total', 'commitment', 'love', 'redemption', 'earned', 'unreserved', 'devotion', 'two', 'moths', 'drawn', 'flame', 'doomed', 'suffering', 'death', 'finding', 'solace', 'even', 'nobility', 'unconditional', 'love', 'other.Along', 'oblique', 'implication', 'anyone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'empathy', 'two', 'such', 'tragic', 'figures', 'brute', 'cad', 'cynic.It', 'last', 'charge', 'self-respecting', 'dissidents', 'should', 'take', 'issue.If', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'were', 'really', 'aforementioned', 'qualities', 'would', ""n't"", 'object', 'nearly', 'intensity', 'feel', 'film', 'not', 'such', 'qualities', 'rather', 'such', 'qualities', 'mask', 'viewpoint', 'ultimately', 'ignoble', 'hypocritical', 'short', 'con', 'replete', 'tricks', 'sleights', 'hand', 'Hollywood', 'used', 'years', 'mislead', 'manipulate.This', 'film', 'two', 'Beautiful', 'People', 'play-acting', 'being', 'drunk', 'prostitute', 'man', 'not', 'understandable', 'even', 'discernable', 'reason', 'demanded', 'plot', 'woman', 'not', 'life', 'skidded', 'rock', 'bottom', 'prostitution', 'old', 'dodge', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'always', 'rely', 'provoke', 'prurience.I', 'film', 'apologists', 'deny', 'this.If', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'high-minded', 'spiritual', 'defenders', 'claim', 'then', 'should', 'assume', 'challenge', 'replace', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'two', 'ugly', 'actors', 'Make', 'fat', 'wrinkled', 'bad', 'teeth', 'dirty', 'unkempt', 'hair', 'drunk', 'would', 'possess', 'none', 'boyish', 'charm', 'would', 'behave', 'loutishly', 'incoherently', 'drunk', 'continually', 'beat', 'woman', 'prostitute', 'would', 'be', 'incapable', 'words', 'longer', 'two', 'syllables', 'would', 'be', 'habitually', 'spaced', 'out', 'crack', 'Let', 'see', 'unconditional', 'love', 'total', 'commitment', 'will', 'rise', 'authentic', 'real-life', 'obstacles', 'truly', 'test', 'such', 'starry-eyed', 'notions', 'film', 'same', 'reviews', 'dose', 'reality', 'then', 'detractors', 'will', 'concede', 'high-mindedness', 'spirituality.But', 'film', 'not', 'high-minded', 'not', 'spiritual', 'RELIES', 'physical', 'attractiveness', 'charisma', 'absurdly', 'erudite', 'conduct', 'two', 'stars', 'hook', 'witness', 'not', 'tragedy', 'two', 'spent', 'broken', 'souls', 'machinations', 'Hollywood', 'glam', 'factory', 'reinventing', 'two', 'most', 'Beautiful', 'People', 'make-believe', 'losers', 'are', 'supposed', 'go', 'along', 'hypocritical', 'charade', 'feel', 'sorry', 'whom', 'Who', 'feel', 'sorry', 'real', 'Bens', 'Seras', 'world', 'dashing', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'gorgeous', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'film', 'more', 'simply', 'bad', 'resent', 'despair', 'tragedy', 'suffering', 'grief', 'death', 'agonizing', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'soft-porn', 'fairy-tale', 'perfect', 'teeth', 'perfect', 'looks', 'perfect', 'tans', 'resent', 'empathy', 'unworthy', 'reasons', 'when', 'merits', 'gall', 'try', 'milking', 'tears', 'overt', 'manipulation', 'tawdriest', 'tricks', 'book', 'Sera', 'parting', 'gift', 'Ben', 'act', 'love', 'deathbed', 'giving', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'Angel', '.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'claim', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'target', 'audience', 'breathless', 'reviews', 'site', 'prove', 'otherwise', 'who', 'wonder', 'why', 'detractors', 'dislike', 'so', 'much', 'should', 'consider', 'rejection', 'not', 'lack', 'perception', 'feeling', 'rather', 'abundance', 'very', 'qualities']",N/A

He decides to take his severance check and buy tons of alcohol in order to drink himself to death in a Las Vegas motel room. He meets Sera (Elizabeth Shue), a prostitute that he picks up along the way, and they develop a love affair in the process. Sera's love for Ben is reflected in the way she lets him complete his goal. He wants death and no rehabilitation. As a result, she sacrifices herself in prostitution in order to make ends meet and raise money for Ben's booze habit. In the process, Sera meets some terrible experiences, which makes her character more interesting.DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES and THE LOST WEEKEND may have an edge on this movie because they have characters that grow and develop over a long period of time. There is not much that we know about Ben or Sera. All we see are his momments of drunkeness and Sera's trying to cope with it. There is very little room for character development in this movie, and the end result is a depressing atmosphere.Pros: ActingCons: ScreenplayScore: 74 (out of 100)",4,"Good movie, but not a great film score: 74 (out of 100)",1013817600,"02 16, 2002",2002,1111,"['Nicholas', 'Cage', 'character', 'Ben', 'Sanderson', 'apparently', 'lost', 'wife', 'family', 'job', 'take', 'severance', 'check', 'buy', 'tons', 'alcohol', 'order', 'drink', 'death', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'motel', 'room', 'Sera', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'prostitute', 'up', 'way', 'develop', 'love', 'affair', 'process', 'Sera', 'love', 'Ben', 'reflected', 'way', 'complete', 'goal', 'death', 'rehabilitation', 'result', 'prostitution', 'order', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'raise', 'money', 'Ben', 'booze', 'habit', 'process', 'Sera', 'terrible', 'experiences', 'character', 'more', 'interesting.DAYS', 'OF', 'WINE', 'AND', 'ROSES', 'THE', 'LOST', 'WEEKEND', 'may', 'have', 'edge', 'movie', 'have', 'characters', 'grow', 'develop', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'know', 'Ben', 'Sera', 'see', 'are', 'momments', 'drunkeness', 'Sera', 'trying', 'cope', 'very', 'little', 'room', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'end', 'result', 'depressing', 'atmosphere.Pros', 'ActingCons', 'ScreenplayScore', '74', '100']",N/A

139817,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0792838068,Bobby Underwood,"[7, 9]","Mike Figgis brought this touching ode to the night to the screen, imbuing it with the transient and tragic nature of those seduced and then swallowed up by it. The director of Stormy Monday perfectly captures the sad yet often poetic beauty found in the shared loneliness of the night two souls in despair can find.On the surface it is a simple story of a man drinking himself to death and a prostitute on the streets of Las Vegas. But it is really a story of love and loss with a foreign film atmosphere and quality, giving it that rare depth where the film becomes more than the sum of its parts.Nicholas Cage gives a haunting performance as Ben Sanderson, a man who has lost everything and come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. On his way down he meets a prostitute named Sera and in their spiraling despair they discover love. One of the most poignant moments in the film comes when Cage is on the streets of Las Vegas seeking human contact and can't remember whether he lost everything because of his drinking or started drinking because he lost everything. Cage's performance rings absolutely true and deservedly won him the Oscar. He shows with great tenderness the sad realism of being an alcoholic.Matching Cage scene for scene is Elizabeth Shue in a brilliantly realized role that should have won an Oscar. As this lonely and isolated working girl begins to care about Ben she discovers she is not dead inside, like some, and can still love. But when Ben finally pushes her away in order to save her, she realizes that if she lets him, she may very well lose this power to love and her connection to being human. Going back, however, may be more than her heart can bare.Figgis has made a mesmerizing film of almost overwhelming sadness. This is not a `feel good' movie by any stretch of the imagination. There is both truth and poetry here though for those who know this life. Ben and Sera are like two roses; one withering at the onset of its last winter and the other finding an unexpected bud on a long dormant vine.An incredible sountrack with artist like Michael MacDonald and Sting is used to set the tone for this wonderful but difficult to watch film. Anyone who has ever been devastated by a loss and known a Sera or a Ben, or a combination of both in one, will be moved by this heartbreaking journey into loneliness and despair. Though brilliant, its appeal may be limited and it is easy to understand why some are not as enthusiastic about it.But for those who have ever seen or experienced a glimmer of this side of life and been shown the comforting tenderness of love on the way down, the final moments of this film will be almost painful to watch and deeply affecting. Figgis has made a masterpiece for all those who have walked away before the night swallowed them up completely and they were lost forever.",5,A Dance of Despair in the Night,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2839,"['Mike', 'Figgis', 'brought', 'touching', 'ode', 'night', 'screen', 'imbuing', 'transient', 'tragic', 'nature', 'seduced', 'then', 'swallowed', 'up', 'director', 'Stormy', 'Monday', 'perfectly', 'sad', 'yet', 'often', 'poetic', 'beauty', 'found', 'shared', 'loneliness', 'night', 'two', 'souls', 'despair', 'can', 'find.On', 'surface', 'simple', 'story', 'man', 'drinking', 'death', 'prostitute', 'streets', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'really', 'story', 'love', 'loss', 'foreign', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'quality', 'giving', 'depth', 'where', 'film', 'more', 'sum', 'parts.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'haunting', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Sanderson', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'come', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'drink', 'death', 'way', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Sera', 'spiraling', 'despair', 'discover', 'love', 'One', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'Cage', 'streets', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'seeking', 'human', 'contact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'lost', 'everything', 'drinking', 'started', 'drinking', 'lost', 'everything', 'Cage', 'performance', 'rings', 'absolutely', 'true', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'great', 'tenderness', 'sad', 'realism', 'being', 'alcoholic.Matching', 'Cage', 'scene', 'scene', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'brilliantly', 'realized', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'lonely', 'isolated', 'working', 'girl', 'care', 'Ben', 'not', 'dead', 'inside', 'can', 'still', 'love', 'when', 'Ben', 'finally', 'away', 'order', 'save', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'lose', 'power', 'love', 'connection', 'being', 'human', 'Going', 'back', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'heart', 'can', 'bare.Figgis', 'made', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'almost', 'overwhelming', 'sadness', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'truth', 'poetry', 'here', 'who', 'know', 'life', 'Ben', 'Sera', 'are', 'two', 'roses', 'one', 'withering', 'onset', 'last', 'winter', 'other', 'finding', 'unexpected', 'bud', 'long', 'dormant', 'vine.An', 'incredible', 'sountrack', 'artist', 'Michael', 'MacDonald', 'Sting', 'used', 'set', 'tone', 'wonderful', 'difficult', 'watch', 'film', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'devastated', 'loss', 'known', 'Sera', 'Ben', 'combination', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'heartbreaking', 'journey', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'Though', 'brilliant', 'appeal', 'may', 'be', 'limited', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'are', 'not', 'enthusiastic', 'it.But', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'experienced', 'glimmer', 'side', 'life', 'been', 'shown', 'comforting', 'tenderness', 'love', 'way', 'down', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'Figgis', 'made', 'masterpiece', 'who', 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'night', 'swallowed', 'up', 'completely', 'were', 'lost', 'forever']",N/A

While it is hard to argue that the performances of stars Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue are not first rate, unfortunately they serve a plot which is misogynistic, exceddingly unpleasent and utterly pointless.  Don't get me wrong, there have been some excellent movies that have portrayed destruction through drugs and alcohol.  &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; and &quot;The Boost&quot; are two examples that immediately come to mind.  But &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; not only glamorizes Cage's self-determined destruction through alcohol, but manages to thoroughly degrade Shue's character at the same time.  There is one scene for example , in which Shue is gang raped in a hotel room, that is completely gratutitous.  It doesn't advance the plot and seems to serve no purpose other than showing the filmaker's contempt for her character.  The relationship between the two of them has some tender moments, but ultimately come to no apparent point.Going to the movies ought to be an enjoyable experience, or failing that, it at least ought to be enlightening.  &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; is neither.

However, I feel compelled to point out one thing about this film that seems to have been overlooked by other reviewers.One reviewer writes that this is an excellent example of unconditional love.  Uh, 'scuse me?  Can you say ""enabler""?  Elizabeth Shue's character, a high-priced call girl, meets a drunk who's so wasted that he can't perform, spends the night in his arms listening to his drunken ponderings, physically suffers for this at the hands of her pimp, meets the drunk again and agrees to his demand that ""You can never tell me to stop drinking"" as a condition for a more serious relationship, and it's unconditional love?  For heaven's sakes, if you LOVE someone you want them WELL, not overtly suicidal.  Her spectacularly warped maternal instincts in this regard are not at all touching, just sad.  She even buys him a flask as a gift!But I guess that's part of the film's unique universe.  These characters are completely lost, cowardly, and sad.  He wants her to quit hooking, too, but since she can't tell him to quit drinking he certainly can't approach her with his misgivings either.  Give the film credit for showing each of them grappling with this, but in the end they wimpishly stick to their agreement to allow themselves to wallow in their pathetic circumstances.  Real love has enough muscle to fight over such things; this pale excuse for love is, perhaps, all these lost souls can muster up.Needless to say, this is not a film for those who must have a happy ending.  While Cage's performance in and of itself was indeed Oscar worthy, the movie overall leaves a bad taste in your mouth like a healthy puke after a three-day bender.  It's fascinating to watch and scream at the characters to grow up and do something about their doomed lot in life, but only once.

The story is about an alcoholic who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death, and while there he forges a strong relationship with a prostitute. Nicolas Cage won the Oscar for this role, and he really deserved it. Sometimes he makes you laugh with his drunken antics, but often times you absolutely cringe. His drunken attempts at picking up women in bars are really pathetic. The woman reel away from the stench of his breath, and you can almost smell it yourself.Ben Sanderson: I don't know if my wife left me because of my drinking or I started drinking 'cause my wife left me.Elisabeth Shue also turns in the role of a lifetime. She has her own esteem issues, to be sure. At one point, she admits that she is only using him. Ben and Sera have an intense relationship where the only rules are, no matter what, Sera can't ask Ben to stop drinking. She knows he is trying to kill himself, but she has to accept that. She buys him clothes and lets him move in with her. She tries to feed him plain rice, but throughout the film, he never eats anything. Apparently a symptom of acute alcoholism, in the advance stages they can't keep any food down. When she prepares him plain rice, a bland dish that she hopes he can handle, he only eats an ice cube with his chopsticks.Sera: Don't you like me, Ben?Ben Sanderson: Sera... what you don't understand is - no, see, no. You can never, never ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?Sera: I do. I really do.Cage doesn't hold back one bit, and takes his character over the edge of the abyss. At one point he watches a stripper and chugs a pint of liquor. The raunchy jazz on the soundtrack seems to imply that he is playing a strange reverse solo on his bottle. The shock of so much alcohol to his system makes the sound drop away. He is in his own world, like a near death experience where he is crawling towards the light...Sera: How do you feel?Ben Sanderson: Like the kling klang king of the rim ram room.Shue for some reason really impressed me the most when she was embarrassed and shamed by Ben's drunken antics. In one mishap he falls smack down on a glass table while lounging by a pool in a desert motel.Ben Sanderson: Look at me... I'm a prickly pear.When the innkeeper lady comes out to sweep up the glass she thinks she can charm her way out of it, but is told to go to her room, and in the morning, to check out and never return. Not quite as drunk as Ben, she is still capable of shame. She can also be hurt by him, as when she goes out working, and Ben gambles and takes a hooker back to her room. The look on her face when she returns is so poignant.Sera: What's up?Ben Sanderson: I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you've a boyfriend, or a girlfriend, but I thought maybe we could get some dinner.You have two extremely powerful performances here, Cage and Shue, or rather Ben and Sera, are two messed up people, but this is also a tender love story. There is a lot of great jazz on the soundtrack, like for instance Sting does the ballads Angel Eyes and My One and Only Love. The former was a favorite of Ella Fitzgerald, while the latter was featured on the Coltrane and Johnny Hartman collaboration. The music is at times cheesy, but intentionally so. Perfect for the Las Vegas casino vibe. Other times sophisticated, funky, or even almost angelic in some of the later scenes of transcendence. Director Mike Figgis is a musician, and he also composed the score, as well as playing keyboards and trumpet on it. Not only that, he pulls a Hitchcock with a cameo, playing a mobster who passes Ben in the hallway, perhaps on his way to execute Sera's pimp. He is really a renaissance man, that Mike Figgis. In at least two scenes taxis are shown with an advertisement on the roof hoarding depicting a brand called ""Red Mullet"" - the name of director Mike Figgis's production company and it's his face in the ad.Sera: Is drinking a way of killing yourself?Ben Sanderson: Or, is killing myself a way of drinking?John O'Brien, the writer, perhaps didn't actually do all the things that Ben, the character in his book did, but he did commit suicide about two weeks after the film began production. Director Mike Figgis contemplated abandoning the project, but decided the film would make a good memorial for O'Brien. Did he drink himself to death? Perhaps it is just morbid curiosity on my part, but apart from how much of John O'Brien may or may not be in his character Ben, it is a very compelling narrative. O'Brien's prose has been compared to Charles Bukowski or Larry Brown.Sera: That's nice talk, Ben - keep drinking. Between the 101-proof breath and the occasional bits of drool, some interesting words come out.I haven't read the book, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the book was much better than the film. However, the film was good enough to win several Oscars and nominations, in spite of the ugly subject matter. It told the story very well in cinematic terms. There are lots of beautiful shots; the neon lights of Vegas never looked prettier. There is a shot filmed underwater where Ben drinks from a bottle of beer even though he is submerged. The best shower scenes since Psycho, where Ben and Sera both are trying to cleanse themselves from some gut wrenching scene of defilement. Ben even showers with not one but two bottles of liquor.Sera: So why are you a drunk?Ben Sanderson: Why am I a drunk? Is that really what you wanna ask me?Sera: Yes.Ben Sanderson: Well, then, this is our first date, or our last. Until now I wasn't sure it was either.Does it glorify alcoholism? I don't really think it does that at all. It is really horrendous and the downward spiral a pathetic tragedy. If anything is glorified, it is the spirit and love of the two main characters in spite of some serious character flaws.Ben Sanderson: I came here to drink myself to death.Sera: How long will it take you?Ben Sanderson: I'd say about three to four weeks.SELECTED FILMS AND ROLES OF NICOLAS CAGEGhost Rider (Widescreen Edition)(2007) ....

Played by Nicolas Cage and Elizebeth Shue respectively, their characters are always authentic and are often rounded with heartwrenching emotion. I think, in fact, one can make a good case that there hasn't been a movie with as great a male and female combo lead performances since. Cage won the Oscar for it, and I think so should have Shue. We see Ben between outright drunkeness and his semi-drunkeness where he expreses his love and care for Sera the only way he can. We see Sera care for Ben and worry about him, and trully love him despite his erratic behavior and perhaps also because of it. There are sequences between the two so good that I dare not begin to describe them.This film is more or less a remake of the classic Midnight Cowboy, with the added romantic edge. Some call this film really depressing. While it isn't a happy film, it's really not one that's much of a downer either. There are hard scenes to take, but there are also great uplifting scenes, and nothing that happens in the end is really all that shocking. The movie is not flawless. Las Vegas isn't perfectly depicted, and there are a few too many outside characters that try to add to the shame of Ben and Sera.

139826,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,0792838068,C McGhee,"[2, 4]","Leaving Las Vegas is a hard core hark back to the old Film Noir genre. Set to deal with the dark & seamy side of living it does just that & adds terrific performances by Elizabeth Shue & Nicholas Cage.Cage plays a movie exec that has reached his limit as a hard drinking alcoholic. Here's a question, who manipulates people more the movie exec or the alcoholic? Maybe the one is training for the other.Shue plays a been everywhere done everything whore who wakes up & realizes she's alone not just at night but every minute of everyday. This is where I part from the normal story synopsis which claims they fall in love. Yeah right. These are two people totally absorbed in themselves who have unique & hard to fill needs in their lives. Cage wants someone to hold his hand while he drinks himself to death without nagging him about it. Shue wants something to come home to besides mouth wash for her paste filled teeth. Although she can easily swing both ways her preference turns out to be hetero. I'm sure lots of men have fantasized about living & loving with a whore. I'm just as certain men almost all know it won't work like you think. Shue needs a guy with an askew view.Enter the above two, into each others lives. Now our whore who has capably manipulated men into giving her what she wants for years stumbles on? No finds, the biggest loser she can have contact with & surprise? No entices, him with what he is so desperately looking for, a hand & body to hold while dying. Cage on the other hand wants to find a girl to ease his passing & looks in the Las Vegas Sunday School Social Register? No checks out, the whores available. He gives chase to the one that responds in the most positive manner.The only love here is self love. The only reason this works is because it is obvious that we're looking at a short term relationship. In the end Cage is dead, as he wanted to be. Shue is still alive & has had this marvelous experience of not coming home to just mouth wash. That means Shue used Cage to combat her terrible loneliness, without the long term commitment she did not have any use or desire for. Whereas Cage used Shue to keep himself from falling totally into self-loathing since he had this one human who would hold his hand till death. They both attain what they want by their own devices.The truly stellar performances turned in by Cage & Shue are what make this story go even more than the story which is top-notch itself. The movie could have so easily turned into just a vile look at what humanity is capable of but the performances keep it alive & moving.So often we forget the failures & half truths we have in our own lives & if you're one of those moviegoers that only go to the show to be uplifted & refreshed you should avoid this at all costs. I give Cage's portrayal as an end of the road alcoholic 5 stars. Shue gets 6 stars as the whore. I sometimes feel that people think anyone could play a convincing whore. I don't think that. 6 stars.NOW for contentions, which are small. I was actually PO'ed that they used the Bugs Bunny roadrunner type of highway travel when Cage went to Vegas. It did not belong anywhere in this movie! I would have preferred to have fewer close-ups on human heads that left no sense of framing to the shot. This is a completely amateur mistake in photography or filming. It was used far, far too much.If you like old film noir: SEE THIS ONEStory, writing & acting 5 stars.Directing & filming minus 1/2 star.

Sanderman,"[3, 4]","LEAVING LAS VEGAS is a truly heartbreaking story about a man, determined to drink himself to death, and the hooker who falls in love with him.  But in case you were thinking it: this ain't no PRETTY WOMAN.  Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue both bring a heavy dose of reality to their respective roles.  Cage oscillates between our sympathy and disgust, refusing to falsely breathe pity into the role.  One of the things that is great about the film is that it flips the plot and moral cards on us.  Normally in a film like this, the ""Prince Charming"" who saves the princess from her life of whoring is lifted up as the moral superior, brining life and love into the life of a hooker.  But in LEAVING LAS VEGAS, the hooker becomes the moral exemplar, breathing life and love into the broken life of an alcoholic.  It is a wonderful reversal and I was happy to see it.One of the questions I kept asking myself was: Why is Cage a drunk?  We get some insights into his condition: his wife leaving him and a failed job.  I would have appreciated a bit more back story.  It is interesting to see the degeneration of man, painful as it is, but it would have been more interesting if we had had more understanding of the events that had led to his demise.  Of course, in the end, the backstory does not really matter.  LEAVING LAS VEGAS is not a film about tidying up loose ends.  It is a film that takes us into the depths of despair and then, rather than rescuing us by a Hollywood ending, drops us in the grave and buries us alive.The film score is perfect for the movie.  The jazz music lends the film the romance and sadness that it needs.  Yet, unlike many reviewers, I would not call this a love story.  The ""love"" that is here is so muddled by the need of these two persons that it becomes transformed into something else.  It is about two people at the end of their rope, with one dollar in their pocket.  Instead of trying to save the dollar and start over, they decide to spend it and see what happens.  The rest, as they say, is history.LEAVING LAS VEGAS is a beautiful film that deserves to be in everyone's library.

He recently was fired from his job, and now he relocates to Las Vegas to ""drink himself to death"".  Meanwhile, he meets Sera, a prostitute equally emotionally dying.  The moment they begin dating, their relationship moves faster than the average couple.  Their chemistry and mutual acceptance proves that they are destined for each other.Its plot contains heavy depth that keeps the emotional stance intact.  The unique storyline of two people on the verge of death who fall in love makes this film like no other.  This love affair combines passion and darkness that few have made fit together so well.  As the characters fall deeper into their suicidal spiral, the drama continually builds leading to a powerful climax.  The characters' painful pasts gives the film events a more powerful theme.  Such themes offer a more new meaning to Las Vegas.Nicolas Cage (Ben) and Elisabeth Shue (Sera) are the top performers of this film.  Neither actor had performed in a dark-themed film before.  However, their chemistry between one another and the film proves great.  This would propel their careers to greater levels.  Cage, in his Oscar-winning performance, gives new meaning to the term alcoholic.  His character's witty, charming, and aggressive personality combine well.  His performance proved highly difficult considering Ben was drunk through 99% of the film.  Shue's powerful Oscar-nominated performance (which she should have won) is the breakthrough performance of the year and of her career.  Sera's emotional stance offers new depth territory to the film.  Her deep emotional pain, loneliness, and hardships express themselves in great levels.  Shue mastered acting out many difficult issues and events (rape, assault, harassment, endangerment, and more), which makes this much more amazing.""Leaving Las Vegas"" is a great film for any hardcore drama fan.  This will surely keep audiences interested for a long time.  Those interested in this film must watch it a few times to fully understand the deep crutial details.",5,The Gloomy Side of Las Vegas,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,2334,"['Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'starring', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'great', 'hardcore', 'dram-packed', 'film', 'released', '1995', 'received', 'four', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'film', 'lives', 'Ben', 'Sera', 'Ben', 'wife', 'son', 'left', 'severe', 'drinking', 'habit', 'recently', 'was', 'fired', 'job', 'now', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'drink', 'death', 'Meanwhile', 'Sera', 'prostitute', 'equally', 'emotionally', 'dying', 'moment', 'begin', 'dating', 'relationship', 'faster', 'average', 'couple', 'chemistry', 'mutual', 'acceptance', 'proves', 'are', 'destined', 'other.Its', 'plot', 'heavy', 'depth', 'emotional', 'stance', 'intact', 'unique', 'storyline', 'two', 'people', 'verge', 'death', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'film', 'other', 'love', 'affair', 'combines', 'passion', 'darkness', 'few', 'have', 'made', 'fit', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'characters', 'fall', 'deeper', 'suicidal', 'spiral', 'drama', 'continually', 'leading', 'powerful', 'climax', 'characters', 'painful', 'pasts', 'film', 'events', 'more', 'powerful', 'theme', 'Such', 'themes', 'offer', 'more', 'new', 'meaning', 'Las', 'Vegas.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Ben', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Sera', 'are', 'top', 'performers', 'film', 'actor', 'had', 'performed', 'dark-themed', 'film', 'However', 'chemistry', 'one', 'film', 'great', 'would', 'propel', 'careers', 'greater', 'levels', 'Cage', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'alcoholic', 'character', 'witty', 'charming', 'aggressive', 'personality', 'combine', 'well', 'performance', 'proved', 'highly', 'difficult', 'considering', 'Ben', 'was', 'drunk', '99', '%', 'film', 'Shue', 'powerful', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'year', 'career', 'Sera', 'emotional', 'stance', 'new', 'depth', 'territory', 'film', 'deep', 'emotional', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'hardships', 'express', 'great', 'levels', 'Shue', 'mastered', 'acting', 'out', 'many', 'difficult', 'issues', 'events', 'rape', 'assault', 'harassment', 'endangerment', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'amazing', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'great', 'film', 'hardcore', 'drama', 'fan', 'will', 'surely', 'keep', 'audiences', 'interested', 'long', 'time', 'interested', 'film', 'must', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'fully', 'understand', 'deep', 'crutial', 'details']",N/A

Ben, a suicidal alcoholic, and Sera, a prostitute, are the kind of people that the rest of the world likes to sweep under the rug.

I didn't watch it up until about a couple of years ago. Mainly because I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan. But this is undeniably one of the greatest performances of the 1990's. Elisabeth Shue also turns in a raving performance, as a Vegas call girl. Ben (Cage in his Oscar-winning role) is a movie executive whose also a hopeless alcoholic. After losing his job and family, Ben sets off to Las Vegas with his severance pay, to drink himself to death. Along the way he meets a beautiful call girl by the name of Sera (Shue in her Oscar-nominated role) and soon after they fall for each other. Neither one of them is ever tearing the other down for their problems and seem to find peace with one another. This movie works on many levels. The main one is the love story -- that's anything but conventional. The other is the alcohol. We watch Ben kill himself slowly with massive ammounts of alcohol-- at some point, wishing he would just say no. The same for Sera, who is a genuine character you care about, you just want her to say no. I'm hoping MGM will release a nice little 2-Disc set for this movie. Some extras would be nice -- especially some deleted scenes and maybe some behind-the-scenes. The DVD -- both sound and video wise -- is excellent, it just lacks special features. All in all, the movie is one of the best of 1995 -- considering that it was up against such greats as Braveheart and Dead Man Walking.Leaving Las Vegas was nominated for 4 Academy Awards including:Actor In A Leading Role -- Nicolas Cage {&quot;Ben&quot;}Actress In A Leading Role -- Elisabeth Shue {&quot;Sera&quot;}Directing -- Mike FiggisBest Adapted Screenplay -- Mike Figgis",5,Cage &amp; Shue give the performances of their careers...,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,1756,"['Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', '1995', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'release', 'was', 'praised', 'what', 'powerful', 'film', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'up', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Mainly', ""'m"", 'not', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'fan', 'undeniably', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', '1990', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'also', 'raving', 'performance', 'Vegas', 'call', 'girl', 'Ben', 'Cage', 'Oscar-winning', 'role', 'movie', 'executive', 'also', 'hopeless', 'alcoholic', 'losing', 'job', 'family', 'Ben', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'severance', 'pay', 'drink', 'death', 'way', 'beautiful', 'call', 'girl', 'name', 'Sera', 'Shue', 'Oscar-nominated', 'role', 'soon', 'fall', 'other', 'one', 'ever', 'tearing', 'other', 'down', 'problems', 'seem', 'find', 'peace', 'one', 'movie', 'many', 'levels', 'main', 'one', 'love', 'story', 'anything', 'conventional', 'other', 'alcohol', 'watch', 'Ben', 'kill', 'slowly', 'massive', 'ammounts', 'alcohol', 'point', 'wishing', 'would', 'just', 'say', 'no', 'same', 'Sera', 'who', 'genuine', 'character', 'care', 'just', 'want', 'say', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'MGM', 'will', 'release', 'nice', 'little', '2-Disc', 'set', 'movie', 'extras', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'especially', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'maybe', 'behind-the-scenes', 'DVD', 'sound', 'video', 'wise', 'excellent', 'just', 'special', 'features', 'movie', 'one', 'best', '1995', 'considering', 'was', 'up', 'such', 'greats', 'Braveheart', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking.Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'was', 'nominated', '4', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Actor', 'A', 'Leading', 'Role', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'quot', 'Ben', 'quot', 'Actress', 'A', 'Leading', 'Role', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'quot', 'Sera', 'quot', 'Directing', 'Mike', 'FiggisBest', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Mike', 'Figgis']",N/A

Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[1, 6]","Hollywood cannot portray recovery from what ails Nicholas Cage in this film, for recovery is not a matter of images.  The 1948 film The Lost Weekend was marred by the need for a happy ending, which is the imaging of redemption.We may contrast this film with 28 Days, a movie about &quot;recovery&quot; starring Sandra Bullock.  Leaving Las Vegas, and 28 Days, have the same male-female polarity as A Civil Action (a 1997 film, starring John Travolta, about a failed environmental lawsuit) and Erin Brockovich; for Erin Brockovich, in order to provide a believable happy ending in a society in which the most recent Presidential election had to be decided by a quiet coup d'etat, had to individualize struggle, and make it into a game show.  A Civil Action portrayed the truth of the plaintiff's bar as modal total loss, with occasional wins reversed on appeal making the news.This is a male-female polarity because both 28 Days and Erin Brockovich use a triumphalist-feminist narrative which images and personalizes evil in the form of men, and unrealistically portray women as able, courtesy of misunderstood, vernacular feminism, to get to the required happy ending.  Their &quot;win&quot;, however, is a zero-sum game.  Brockovich claws her way to the top of a bogus revolution by dissing African-Americans and fat people (the latter in a snide plug for a Southern maker of near-inedible donuts that was probably connected with an IPO for Krispy Kreme that happened shortly after the film's release.)  In the irredemiably lower-middle-class economy of 28 Days, Sandra's Aussie boyfriend has to personalize clueless evil.Leaving Las Vegas portrays in a mature way the consequences on relationships of the commodity system: for in the pressure of commodities as represented by Las Vegas causes relationships to use sado-masochistic mechanisms.In the Las Vegas portrayed, &quot;winning&quot; has become a floating signifier which is detached from any sense of desert (as in deserving to win, by making a contribution to a society which has disappeared from the ontology of the individual.)  As a screenwriter, Cage portrays the plight of the real contributor to other people's success whose own success or failure is too unimportant from the standpoint of capital NOT to become a detached screen &quot;credit&quot; with no relation to reality.Cage decides to drink himself to death and Liz Shue invites herself along for the ride.

139840,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,0792838068,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[5, 8]","I guess you can't be all things to all people, and this movie is a good example.  With all the good things that have been said about it, there are still a lot of people who really hate it.  To each their own, I guess.First, about Las Vegas itself.  I do know that when we lived in Illinois, my wife and I must have watched the film fifteen times together.  We now live in Las Vegas, where we are raising four children.  No, the film did not make the decision for us to move, but I'll admit we were mesmerized by the town's portrayal that you don't see in tourist brochures, and between us, we had been tourists as least a dozen times.  While Las Vegas has plenty of openings for Boulevard of Broken Dreams, as any large city does, it's still a rollicking fun town to live in. The movie only portrays what two people made of it.The biggest reason people trash seem to trash the movie seems to be that it is a depressing downer.  I guess I can't argue with that statement.  However, my personal definition of art is portraying human emotion differently (within reason) or better than it's been done before.  Since this film covers human emotion big time, and wrings you out like a dishrag by the time it's over, I would classify it as art, and very good art.To the accusation that the two characters are two glamorous, I don't agree, and even if they are, so what?  Tragedies are supposed to be great dramas (i.e, Hamlet, Romeo & Juliet), and we have a whopper here with a guy who had an incredibly good job and a family, and lost it all.  No, we don't see him puking all over the place, as his condition would suggest, but he does describe exactly those symptoms.  As for Elizabeth Shue being too good-looking for the role, trust me, she's not.  While she might be an above-average looking streetwalker, she's run-of-the-mill compared to the absolute knockouts that ply their trade in this town.  This is not to say she's not beautiful, but she does dress down for the role.The rape scene was brutal, but I don't think it was gratuitous.  First, it showed the dangers that streetwalkers have to face.  Her pimp might have been a jerk, be he did at least in part seem to get her some good gigs with relatively civilized people (i.e., her opening scene).  As far as the rape situation goes, this was at a point in the movie where she was fast spiraling downhill.  After giving Ben more than enough leeway, he betrays her bigtime, and she throws him out.  She has just lost something she was very attached to, and this caused a huge depression that resulted in a very careless move.  The movie shows how she pays the price for this carelessness, and thus the downward spiral.I also don't think Elizabeth Shue's nude scene is gratuitous.  In fact, it's one of the most brilliant scenes ever shot that uses nudity.  To this point in the movie, they've been friends, but no banging, much to her dismay.  Liquor is much too important to him.  So when they are at a getaway resort, she sees that he even needs to take a bottle with him while swimming underwater at the pool.  She comes up with the brilliant idea that maybe if she becomes the booze herself, he will finally get the idea.  The idea works.  The fact that it also ends tragically is the the destiny of the story.Based on what both lead actors have done before and since, this film will probably be considered the high-water mark of both of their careers.

139842,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0792838068,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[9, 14]","Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage) is a raging alcoholic.  When he is fired from his job, he moves to Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death.  Upon his arrival he meets an attractive prostitute named Sera (Elizabeth Shue) and the two strike up a quasi-romance in which he agrees not to condemn her profession and she agrees not to interfer with his determination to kill himself with alcohol.  It is, many critics and fans say, a story of unconditional love.  It is also one of the most profoundly overrated films to emerge from 1990s Hollywood.The primary problem with LEAVING LAS VEGAS is the implausibility of its characters.  There have been, no doubt, men determined to literally drink themselves to death--but the fact remains that men in such an advanced stage of alcoholism aren't loveable, much less reasonably good looking, much less capable of the thought processes depicted here.  There have been, no doubt, hookers with hearts of gold--but those who operate at the level of Sera are seldom memorable beauties and tend to be drug addicted, mentally ill, and often both.  And it is very obvious that not a person involved with the film has the faintest idea of what a flop-house hotel is actually like.Having established these characters, the film proceeds to follow them to a bitter end that I found not in least moving because I never believed them in the first place.  This is not to say that Cage and Shue give bad performances--they are actually remarkably good in their roles.  It's just that the whole film, which touts itself as a hard slice of reality, is so unrealistic that Disney's LITTLE MERMAID looks like a documentary in comparison.

139845,A5DXP7QPGR5A0,0792838068,Gianmarco Manzione,"[5, 9]","I feel compelled to answer the naive misinformation of the acerbic review below by Mr. Chow, whose simplistic dismissal of this movie demonstrates that it is not ""we"" who deserve better filmmaking, but Hollywood who deserves a better audience. His demands to have everything laid out for him by an obvious script that stifles the audience's ability to participate in the making of meaning - coming to our own conclusions about the film's probing psychological implications, for instance -- are why movies as genuinely moving as this one become rarer by the year. They are the reason why Hollywood now consistently delivers whole seasons worth of teeny bopper nonsense that makes hundreds of millions of dollars. If the reasons for Ben's self-destruction must be ""understandable"" and ""discernible"" (how boring), why does it not suffice that Ben was fired, lost his wife and went broke within a short period of time? As he himself says in the movie: ""did I start drinking because my wife left me, or did my wife leave me because I started drinking?"" Nonetheless, alcohol addiction is a condition that is almost always the result of a pre-existing depressive temperament for which there is often no ""discernible"" explanation. If we lived in a world rife with such easy answers as those demanded by this film's detractors, mental disorders and chemical addictions would be a lot easier to overcome than they are. The presumption is also made that prostitutes only decide to resort to that trade when they ""hit rock bottom,"" when in fact many studies confirm that the vast majority of prostitutes suffer from a tremendous and defeating dependency complex in which their frail self-esteem encourages them to pursue abusive relationships that validate their illogical feeling of uselessness. This has nothing to do with external or financial circumstances and everything to do with psychology, an area in which, once again, people thirsting for a one-dimensional human reality will be disappointed. Additionally, I am confounded by the suggestion that Ben and Sera's erudition is at all ""absurd."" Ben -- for those of us who were actually paying attention when watching this movie - reads screenplays for a living. If the possibility that people who read 50 screenplays a week can articulate themselves seems like an absurd one to modern audiences, the problem is with the audience, not the movie. If anything is absurd, it is the assertion that this film is about ""unconditional love"" or ""total commitment."" Ben's love is neither selfless nor unconditional, for he never reciprocates even in the mildest way and repeatedly threatens to bolt when Sera's affection threatens his dependence on alcohol. As for Sera, she herself admits that she is ""just using"" Ben. Sera, whose behavior throughout the film manifests classic symptoms of the self-loathing and dependent personality that characterizes the vast majority of prostitutes, is more truthful in this statement than in most other things she says throughout the movie. Lastly, the suggestion that this film would have resonated in an entirely different way had the characters been ""ugly,"" ""fat"" or ""wrinkled"" is patently false.  Am I the only one who recalls the great film ""Iron Weed,"" in which two filthy, baggy-skinned homeless people with bad teeth cling to one another in a union of unrelenting but feisty devotion? The very virtues Mr. Chow mistakenly ascribes to ""Leaving Las Vegas"" -- ""selflessness,"" redemptive ""devotion,"" ""unconditional love"" -- all come across powerfully and memorably in that story of an ""ugly"" and ""wrinkled"" couple. The only thing that ""provokes prurience"" here are the attacks hurled at this film for its refusal to yield easy and quickly digested answers, like the kind of poetry Donald Hall calls ""easy listenin'.""",4,Hollywood Deserves Better,1099267200,"11 1, 2004",2004,3794,"['feel', 'compelled', 'answer', 'naive', 'misinformation', 'acerbic', 'review', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'simplistic', 'dismissal', 'movie', 'not', 'who', 'deserve', 'better', 'filmmaking', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'better', 'audience', 'demands', 'have', 'everything', 'laid', 'out', 'obvious', 'script', 'audience', 'ability', 'participate', 'making', 'meaning', 'coming', 'own', 'conclusions', 'film', 'probing', 'psychological', 'implications', 'instance', 'are', 'why', 'movies', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'one', 'become', 'rarer', 'year', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'consistently', 'whole', 'seasons', 'teeny', 'bopper', 'nonsense', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'reasons', 'Ben', 'self-destruction', 'must', 'be', 'understandable', 'discernible', 'how', 'boring', 'why', 'not', 'suffice', 'Ben', 'was', 'fired', 'lost', 'wife', 'went', 'broke', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'movie', 'did', 'start', 'drinking', 'wife', 'left', 'did', 'wife', 'leave', 'started', 'drinking', 'Nonetheless', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'condition', 'almost', 'always', 'result', 'pre-existing', 'depressive', 'temperament', 'often', 'discernible', 'explanation', 'lived', 'world', 'rife', 'such', 'easy', 'answers', 'demanded', 'film', 'detractors', 'mental', 'disorders', 'chemical', 'addictions', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'easier', 'overcome', 'are', 'presumption', 'also', 'made', 'only', 'decide', 'resort', 'trade', 'when', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'when', 'fact', 'many', 'studies', 'confirm', 'vast', 'majority', 'prostitutes', 'suffer', 'tremendous', 'defeating', 'dependency', 'complex', 'frail', 'self-esteem', 'pursue', 'abusive', 'relationships', 'validate', 'illogical', 'feeling', 'uselessness', 'nothing', 'do', 'external', 'financial', 'circumstances', 'everything', 'do', 'psychology', 'area', 'once', 'again', 'people', 'thirsting', 'one-dimensional', 'human', 'reality', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Additionally', 'am', 'confounded', 'suggestion', 'Ben', 'Sera', 'erudition', 'absurd', 'Ben', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'paying', 'attention', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'reads', 'screenplays', 'living', 'possibility', 'people', 'who', 'read', '50', 'screenplays', 'week', 'can', 'articulate', 'absurd', 'one', 'modern', 'audiences', 'problem', 'audience', 'not', 'movie', 'anything', 'absurd', 'assertion', 'film', 'unconditional', 'love', 'total', 'commitment', 'Ben', 'love', 'selfless', 'unconditional', 'never', 'even', 'mildest', 'way', 'repeatedly', 'bolt', 'when', 'Sera', 'affection', 'dependence', 'alcohol', 'Sera', 'just', 'using', 'Ben', 'Sera', 'behavior', 'film', 'manifests', 'classic', 'symptoms', 'self-loathing', 'dependent', 'personality', 'vast', 'majority', 'prostitutes', 'more', 'truthful', 'statement', 'most', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'Lastly', 'suggestion', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'resonated', 'entirely', 'different', 'way', 'had', 'characters', 'been', 'ugly', 'fat', 'wrinkled', 'patently', 'false', 'Am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'great', 'film', 'Iron', 'Weed', 'two', 'filthy', 'baggy-skinned', 'homeless', 'people', 'bad', 'teeth', 'cling', 'one', 'union', 'unrelenting', 'feisty', 'devotion', 'very', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'mistakenly', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'selflessness', 'redemptive', 'devotion', 'unconditional', 'love', 'come', 'powerfully', 'memorably', 'story', 'ugly', 'wrinkled', 'couple', 'only', 'thing', 'provokes', 'prurience', 'here', 'are', 'attacks', 'hurled', 'film', 'refusal', 'yield', 'easy', 'quickly', 'digested', 'answers', 'kind', 'poetry', 'Donald', 'Hall', 'easy', 'listenin']",N/A

This film just painted such a vivid picture of a man who totally drinks himself away and the prostitute who fell in love with him. This was a very daring and original film. I would not recommend that any children should see it.

Personally the acting by Elizabeth Shue is good I think Nicholas Cage's role was very overrated. I don't see how you could honestly say that playing an alcoholic is very difficult. Majority of the movie he is either drunk or passed out. The most ridiculous part is that he won an oscar! Sad but true. Basically Nicholas Cage's life comes crashing down on him as his wife and kids dis-own him, on top of that he loses his job. As a result, Nicholas Cage Wants to escape from his L.A. life by going to Las vegas to ""drink himself to death."" On his way to Vegas he meets a prostitute, Elizabeth Shue who leads a sad life and is very lonely. Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue both have serious problems but they some how get around that and start to have feelings for each other. They both realize that they have serious issues but they don't care to mention any of that to each other. They respect each others life styles. In general Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue play very weak characters, I mean I think there are other people in the world who have had worse problems in their life and turned it around. Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue pretty much give up on life. Elizabeth Shue never quits selling her body, and Nicholas Cage never quits ""Drinking himself to Death."" Like I said I liked Elizabeth Shue's acting and the story line was somewhat decent. I wouldn't call the movie terrible. I just don't see how HollyWood could blow up and hype such a movie, not to mention Nicholas Cage winning an oscar, if anything it should of went to Elizabeth Shue even though she was nominated. Im no actor, but I can assure you fans of this movie or even people that hate this movie that I could of easily played a guy who passes out most of the movie and act incredibly stupid. That is what Nicholas Cage does pretty much the whole movie, he doesn't really portray any real quality acting.

Not because it is a bad film but because of the material with which it deals and the strength of the portrayal of that material.Nicolas Cage plays Ben, a man who is on the  way down and who knows it. He loses his family and his job and the only  thing that he has left is drinking. Finally, destroying everything that  remains of his old life, he takes his severance pay and sets off for Las  Vegas with the simple intention of drinking himself to death.There he  has a chance encounter with prostitute Sera (Elisabeth Shue) and they are  drawn together. All that Ben needs is a person who will not reject him  because he is a drunk and who will not try to get him off the bottle. Sera  needs Ben too. She needs a man who wants her for more than just sex or the  money that it makes.Oddly, for a relationship involving a prostitute,  sex hardly enters into things. The reason is simple. Alcohol is deadening  Ben to the extent that he is not sexually interested in Sera. This is the  one thing that strains their relationship. Ben never asks Sera to stop  working but he makes sure that she knows that he does not like it. Sera  cannot understand how Ben can want to be with her but not want her  sexually.Finally, Sera realises something about Ben. When he told her  that he intended to drink hiumself to death, he was being more serious than  with anything else. She asks him to seek help. This precipitates a string  of events that breaks them up but they are reunited for a tragic finale in  which both finally get what they wanted.Cage puts in a truely  outstanding performance as Ben. Watching him gave me the same feelings that  I have had when watching a friend get too drunk, too often. He really is  totally convincing. Shue is good but her performance is overshadowed by  Cage.The final reason that the film is so compelling is the source  material. The film is based on a book by John O'Brien who killed himself as  filming began. Director, Mike Figgis finished the film as a tribute and  O'Brien's father is reported to have described the story as his son's  suicide note.",5,"Powerful, compelling and painful",964828800,"07 29, 2000",2000,2123,"['found', 'film', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'Not', 'bad', 'film', 'material', 'strength', 'portrayal', 'material.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Ben', 'man', 'who', 'way', 'down', 'who', 'family', 'job', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'drinking', 'Finally', 'destroying', 'everything', 'old', 'life', 'severance', 'pay', 'sets', 'off', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'simple', 'intention', 'drinking', 'death.There', 'chance', 'encounter', 'prostitute', 'Sera', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'Ben', 'person', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'reject', 'drunk', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'try', 'get', 'off', 'bottle', 'Sera', 'Ben', 'too', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'just', 'sex', 'money', 'makes.Oddly', 'relationship', 'involving', 'prostitute', 'sex', 'hardly', 'things', 'reason', 'simple', 'Alcohol', 'deadening', 'Ben', 'extent', 'not', 'sexually', 'interested', 'Sera', 'one', 'thing', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'never', 'Sera', 'stop', 'working', 'sure', 'not', 'Sera', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'Ben', 'can', 'want', 'be', 'not', 'want', 'sexually.Finally', 'Sera', 'something', 'Ben', 'When', 'told', 'intended', 'drink', 'death', 'was', 'being', 'more', 'serious', 'anything', 'else', 'seek', 'help', 'string', 'events', 'up', 'are', 'reunited', 'tragic', 'finale', 'finally', 'get', 'what', 'wanted.Cage', 'puts', 'truely', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Watching', 'gave', 'same', 'feelings', 'have', 'had', 'when', 'watching', 'friend', 'get', 'too', 'drunk', 'too', 'often', 'really', 'totally', 'convincing', 'Shue', 'good', 'performance', 'overshadowed', 'Cage.The', 'final', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'compelling', 'source', 'material', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'John', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'killed', 'filming', 'began', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'finished', 'film', 'tribute', ""O'Brien"", 'father', 'reported', 'have', 'described', 'story', 'son', 'suicide', 'note']",N/A

It confirms what I have always thought: no matter what, the bottom line is that a human being is essentially love, and life revolves around it. Its presence or its absence dictates pragmatic success or self destruction.Ben's mind boggling drinking may seem too excessive, a expressway to death, but there is so much you can fit into a movie. The core here, in my opinion, resides in the fact that we can - voluntarily, control whether we survive drinking or not. Cage's interpretation is real, yet giving him an Oscar for that remains questionable.Sera's performance as a hooker brought - once again, yet with an astonishing evidence - that prostitution may not be reserved to poor girls and/or uncultured souls. Sue's acting is a masterpiece of profound conflict between business at any cost (the executive at the bar counter and the rape from the football players)and the real, love thirsty and sensitive Sera.He is not a hopeless drunk, She is not a cold blooded hooker. None of them are victims. But both are in desperation to find a way to justify why they are alive. The drunk and the Hooker are not alive, they simply exist!And finding themselves provided means to stop and come back, love as the basis of such painful, yet possibe and desirable recover.I cannot judge why the movie ended with her acceptance of his way of being, as I respect the author's and the director's choice. But as a message (and all real movies should convey one), it would be healing to see, even without an happy-end, that those disturbed beings could return to Life through Love.Elisabeth Sue deserved an Oscar for her amazing, beautiful, sensible and shattering interpretation.For the rest, music supported the movie being a breath holding experience from the beginning to the end.

This is a warm one, a film full of overwhelming admirible quality. It is a drama with the tension of a horror film. It is a comedy with the hilarity of any Police Academy number ever made. It is a weepie with soul but still suitable for men. It is class.This film stars an actor who within his career was defined to no brainers like Con Air and The Rock but no doubt about it this film is an exception, in this he is excellent as the alcholic Ben Sanderson, who after being fired he decides to go to Viva Las Vegas to drink himself to death - Lovely... This actor is teamed up with Elisabeth Shue who also excels herself, she is the prostitute who decides to find love in the mild-mannered alcholic. She is perfect for the role as Sera, and after mishap after mishap after mishap, even one where she is raped by a gang of 'college jocks' (anal intercourse involved - yep that's how bad this film can be) she still tries to find her man. Yet the ending is sad as the actor dies and it therefore ends, it is quite unpredictable, you'd probably hope for him to go and beat the crap out the rapists. It is original therefore making it even more interesting. Oh.. and if you haven't figured it out by now the actor is Nicholas Cage and he proves in this film that he can act properly, he deserved his best actor oscar I think although he did have competiton from The Usual Suspects so I suppose he was lucky. But even with this competiton it deserves a five star for its superb acting, soundtrack (by sting) and for its simply manificent presence on screen.

Made in the mid-90s, it is very much of its time, but you could believe that if you went to Vegas today you would find a Sera and a Ben in terms of life trajectory.Sera: Is drinking a way of killing yourself?Ben: Or, is killing myself a way of drinking?Shue's Sera is not a hooker with a heart of gold but a woman who happens to be a sex worker, and we can imagine that the damage that is a part of her predates her profession.  Cage's Ben is a fantastic piece of work.  We meet these two after the period in their lives where they believed they could change.  That is what makes this movie special.  It does not seek to change its characters, yet is not falsely sentimental.  Even when the characters go through the motions of sentimentality, and sincerely so, the stark truth is always in the room e.g. as Sera sheepishly prepares a meal of vegetables and plain rice, Ben zombie walks into the kitchen to the fridge and walks out clutching two! bottles of vodka to his chest that he chugs in the shower.  Later, with the DTs subsided, he calmly comes back into the kitchen and sits down, and, with a smile on his face, says he's ready for his rice.This film isn't about hedonism.

There are no attempts to coat alcohlism with a romantic sheen or to romanticize it. Addiction needs no Hollywood script writers to provide drama, the affliction comes replete with it by nature.The success of this story may lie in its simplicity. Nicholas Cage plays a man who has seen the end of his rope slip through his fingers. His decision to drink his way to a swift oblivion is strangely understandable, though grim to watch. Though it is a little difficult to accept Elisabeth Shue as a seasoned hooker, Cage nails the role of a deadend drunk driving to his doom without a flicker of brake lights.""Leaving Las Vegas"" should be placed high on the list of the greatest booze movies of all time, joining ""The Lost Weekend"" and ""The Days of Wine and Roses"" as the kind of stark realism that might leave you with a hangover.",5,"So stark, it might cause liver damage",1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,1016,"['Few', 'movies', 'will', 'leave', 'deeper', 'sense', 'gloom', 'one', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'not', 'try', 'reinvent', 'addiction', 'movie', 'just', 'fresh', 'slant', 'very', 'old', 'problem', 'are', 'attempts', 'coat', 'alcohlism', 'romantic', 'sheen', 'romanticize', 'Addiction', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'writers', 'provide', 'drama', 'affliction', 'replete', 'nature.The', 'success', 'story', 'may', 'lie', 'simplicity', 'Cage', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'end', 'rope', 'slip', 'fingers', 'decision', 'drink', 'way', 'swift', 'oblivion', 'strangely', 'understandable', 'though', 'grim', 'watch', 'little', 'difficult', 'accept', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'seasoned', 'hooker', 'Cage', 'role', 'deadend', 'drunk', 'driving', 'doom', 'flicker', 'brake', 'lights', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'should', 'be', 'placed', 'high', 'list', 'greatest', 'booze', 'movies', 'time', 'joining', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'kind', 'stark', 'realism', 'might', 'leave', 'hangover']",N/A

It portrays a dead-on picture of alcoholism and what exactly one goes through when they've hit rock bottom.  As tragic as it is, this is a very beautiful and well-done film that keeps your attention to the bitter end.Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage) is an alcoholic who has nothing left to live for but the very booze that seems to be the only happiness he can find.  His friends want nothing to do with him and women are disgusted by him.  After being let go from his job, Ben burns all of his possessions and moves to Las Vegas, where his only plan is to drink himself to death.  In a short amount of time he meets Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a lonely hooker who has been through it all.  An unexpected bond is formed between the two and love falls upon them that can only end in tragedy.Boy, was this a hard movie to watch, but it was so well-done and executed.  You are able to sympathize with both Ben and Sera, despite the paths they have chosen.  Nicholas Cage was amazing and brilliant.  No wonder why he won an Academy Award for his performance.  You really buy into the fact that he is this sad character who wants nothing more but to destroy himself by the only thing that can bring him some sense of false happiness.  Shue is also terrific in her role and should be applauded as well.  The two are explosive as a team and can really bring the house down.The DVD is fair; nothing too special.  You can have your choice of either watching the movie in widescreen or full screen.  The picture for the most part looks good; not the best, but good.  The main special feature this DVD offers is a trailer for the film and a bonus secret page.  It would be nice if they decided to re-release this in a more superior version.""Leaving Las Vegas"" is drama at its best.  It's heartbreaking, but at the same time is satisfying.  It's emotionally charged from start to finish.  The writing is poetic, the acting is electric, and the directing is fantastic.  Be warned, this is not a ""feel-good"" movie.

Shue just seems detached. See, the problem with all these so-called actors, is that I can actually see them acting. The plot is also riduculous.

first moments , we are encountered with two completely separated charachters , (Nicholas Cage) a complete day/night drunk , never wakes of his booze , he is slowly descending to the edge , with suspecious friendships , shattered memories and irritating behaviour , he is faced with the losing of his job due to his Unresponible acts , on the other hand we meet  (Elisabeth Shue) a hooker lives in Las Vegas , we take a glimpse of one of her THREESOME encounter , and we see her talks to someone after that who isn't obvious on the screen , but we take the impression that she are talking with a shrink .Returns to  , aftetr he got fired he decides to end his life by living on the edge till the end , he chooses Las Vegas as the spot to achieve his goals , and we see him trashing every thing he owns , and getting ready to leave , after reaching Las Vegas he sudddenly encounters  and a strange relationship grows from here ,  he offers her five hundred dollars just to spend the night with him , and he didn't mean it in the SEXUAL way , he just wanted her to be beside him , and things started to develop.You may think that the movie is trying to explain why such people would go on boozing till they destroy themselves , but actually the movie doesn't offer explainations of any kind , it plays like a portrait of personal experience , we see  keeps destroying himself by indulging more and more in the booze , even  tries to get him out of it by many ways without any success , he is presisting on destroying himself with all the methods , in one scene he is faced with a question regarding why he is insisting on doing what he is doing , he answers blankly that he is just doing it , so that proves the personal experience theory , no explainations are offered here .Mike Figgs's direction focused mainly on the disturbing and shocking elements of the storyline , which were actually various during the movie , the dark concept of the story applied to every single scene in the movie  , but he definitely got help from the cast members , including the briliant performance from Nicholas Cage , who actually gave the movie extra atristic weight , also Elisabeth Shue which too a very hard and controversial role , she played her role easily and suceeded in portraying a real image of such real life character .Another elements helped the movie , like the excellent soundrtack which came very suitable for the atmosphere of the movie , the cinematography wandered freely with some strange locations , on the other hand there are other things prohibited this mvie from getting a higher score , including the lack of motivation for some characters , for example till the end of the movie you dont't know why  is doing all of that to himself , why he throws all those things he own away , and departs his city to leave , also the theme of a hooker who meets a man who changes her life for better is not an unique theme , it has beeen presented many times before .but as we agreed on the personal expereience approach you will leave this movie with some kind of shocked sadness , and trust me , the performance of Nicholas Cage will be clinged in your memory for a long time .",4,Burning

139885,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,0792838068,P Magnum,"[9, 13]","1995's Leaving Las Vegas is a dark, fatalistic film that unlike most Hollywood films, does not offer redemption at the end.  Nicholas Cage stars in yet another edgy role as Ben Sanderson.  As the film begins, we find that Ben has lost his reason to live as his career in Hollywood and his family have been taken away from him.  He has vowed to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death.  One very powerful early scene, finds Ben downing a whole pint of booze in one shot at a bar and sinking into a hallucinogenic state.  The scene is filmed in a hazy blurriness that captures the moment perfectly.  Upon arriving in Vegas, Ben runs across a hooker, Sera, played by Elisabeth Shue.  They connect with one another and soon Sera finds herself becoming attached to Ben.  Ben offers no promises and demands that the one thing she never asks him to do is stop drinking.  Sera grudgingly accepts this condition and they enter into a relationship that is based on a mutual neediness that only desperate people have.  Director Mike Figgis does not allow the characters to change.  Ben remains a drunk throughout the film and he fulfills his destiny and Sera never gives up her profession.  Mr. Cage & Ms. Shue are brilliant in their roles and both garnered much acclaim.  But as great as Ms. Shue is, this is Mr. Cage's film all the way.  He is a commanding presence on screen and gives one the best acting performances in the last twenty years.  For his troubles, he won the 1995 Best Actor Oscar.  Ms. Shue was nominated for Best Actress and Mr. Figgis gained two nominations, one for Best Director and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay.  This film was a surprise and so far an anomaly for Mr. Figgis.  He showed nothing in his prior films to suggest he could pull off a film like Leaving Las Vegas and none of his subsequent films have built upon or matched this film's excellence.",5,One Drink Over The Line,1046908800,"03 6, 2003",2003,1883,"['1995', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'dark', 'fatalistic', 'film', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'not', 'offer', 'redemption', 'end', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'stars', 'yet', 'edgy', 'role', 'Ben', 'Sanderson', 'film', 'find', 'Ben', 'lost', 'reason', 'live', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'family', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'away', 'vowed', 'move', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'drink', 'death', 'One', 'very', 'powerful', 'early', 'scene', 'Ben', 'downing', 'whole', 'pint', 'booze', 'one', 'shot', 'bar', 'sinking', 'hallucinogenic', 'state', 'scene', 'filmed', 'hazy', 'blurriness', 'moment', 'perfectly', 'arriving', 'Vegas', 'Ben', 'hooker', 'Sera', 'played', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'connect', 'one', 'soon', 'Sera', 'becoming', 'attached', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'promises', 'demands', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'do', 'stop', 'drinking', 'Sera', 'grudgingly', 'condition', 'enter', 'relationship', 'based', 'mutual', 'neediness', 'only', 'desperate', 'people', 'have', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'not', 'allow', 'characters', 'change', 'Ben', 'drunk', 'film', 'destiny', 'Sera', 'never', 'up', 'profession', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'Ms.', 'Shue', 'are', 'brilliant', 'roles', 'garnered', 'much', 'acclaim', 'as', 'great', 'Ms.', 'Shue', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'film', 'way', 'commanding', 'presence', 'screen', 'one', 'best', 'acting', 'performances', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'troubles', 'won', '1995', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Ms.', 'Shue', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Mr.', 'Figgis', 'gained', 'two', 'nominations', 'one', 'Best', 'Director', 'other', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'film', 'was', 'surprise', 'so', 'far', 'anomaly', 'Mr.', 'Figgis', 'showed', 'nothing', 'prior', 'films', 'suggest', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'film', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'none', 'subsequent', 'films', 'have', 'built', 'matched', 'film', 'excellence']",N/A

It had a tremendously melancholic effect on me for days. I imagine that many people who enjoyed the movie could somehow relate to it, even if in an abstract way. Nick Cage's portrayal of Ben, a man who has hit rock bottom and has lost his will to live, is incredibly powerful and moving; and so is Elisabeth Shue's portrayal of Sera.After having lost all control to his alcohol addiction, Ben's life starts to spiral downhill once he loses his family, and subsequently, his job. Ben decides to take a trip to Vegas, but not before taking everything he owns and burning it (a sign that he will not be returning). He goes to Vegas with nothing but the clothes on his back, a huge stockpile of booze, just enough money for a room at the Whole Year Inn (which he reads as ""The Hole You're In""), and enough booze to binge on until he dies.Along the way he meets Sera, a prostitute, and seems to feel a personal connection with her. They do not hit-it-off immediately, but the two connect later during their time together. Their bond becomes passionately deep and Sera gets attached to Ben emotionally. Ironically, Ben is smitten with Sera, and he knows he could start a new life and love with Sera, were it not for the fate he has indomitably accepted.Although most people would judge and condemn a man like Ben in real life, I was very sympathetic to the character and his pain. I also felt Sera's humanity pierce through the cold wall she puts up as a defense mechanism. Ben has touched her in a way that no one has, and though at first she accepts Ben's death wish as a condition for their new ""relationship,"" Sera becomes conflicted about losing Ben--creating a distraction that Ben had not intended on.This is a great movie with excellent performances from both its stars. Just don't expect to walk away feeling hopeful or happy; because as it is in reality, life does not always have a happy ending, and this movie is a depiction of that reality.",5,A Beautiful Tragedy,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,2034,"['saw', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'theatre', 'bought', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'video', 'had', 'tremendously', 'melancholic', 'effect', 'days', 'imagine', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'could', 'somehow', 'relate', 'even', 'abstract', 'way', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'portrayal', 'Ben', 'man', 'who', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'lost', 'will', 'live', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'moving', 'so', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'portrayal', 'Sera.After', 'having', 'lost', 'control', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'Ben', 'life', 'spiral', 'downhill', 'once', 'family', 'subsequently', 'job', 'Ben', 'take', 'trip', 'Vegas', 'not', 'taking', 'everything', 'burning', 'sign', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'Vegas', 'nothing', 'clothes', 'back', 'huge', 'stockpile', 'booze', 'just', 'enough', 'money', 'room', 'Whole', 'Year', 'Inn', 'Hole', ""'re"", 'enough', 'booze', 'binge', 'dies.Along', 'way', 'Sera', 'prostitute', 'feel', 'personal', 'connection', 'do', 'not', 'hit-it-off', 'immediately', 'two', 'connect', 'later', 'time', 'together', 'bond', 'passionately', 'deep', 'Sera', 'attached', 'Ben', 'emotionally', 'Ironically', 'Ben', 'smitten', 'Sera', 'could', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'love', 'Sera', 'were', 'not', 'fate', 'indomitably', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'judge', 'condemn', 'man', 'Ben', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'pain', 'also', 'felt', 'Sera', 'humanity', 'pierce', 'cold', 'wall', 'up', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'Ben', 'touched', 'way', 'one', 'first', 'Ben', 'death', 'wish', 'condition', 'new', 'relationship', 'Sera', 'conflicted', 'losing', 'Ben', 'creating', 'distraction', 'Ben', 'had', 'not', 'intended', 'on.This', 'great', 'movie', 'excellent', 'performances', 'stars', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'hopeful', 'happy', 'reality', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie', 'depiction', 'reality']",N/A

They take some decent actors and make them live out a miserable life for your entertainment. Did I say entertainment? Oh! Roger Ebert thought it was the best film of 1995. Well, it was the Clinton years, those merry days when Hollywood perverts could indulge their fantasy without interference from pesky terrorists. Out of sight, out of mind.Drama is not comedy after all. Some of the best works of art are all about suffering.  King Lear ain't no comedy, but we care about the foolish old coot who denies his most virtuous daughter leading to the collapse of his kingdom. Nick Cage isn't Lear.  No, there's no nobility, just a drunk with occasional hysteria and his Las Vegas working girl. She's not exactly Ophelia either. Together they have love in a barren desert. Monica Lewinski, where are you? Are you kidding? This must be that Hollywood producer love. Personally, if I wanted to see nudity and adult activities, then there's the work of Tracy Lords, so why would I pay to see a silly whiskey on-the-chest scene. Oh, I got so turned on.There are great dramas in the 1950's about alcoholics. The audiences were entertained and possibly illuminated. Usually they were written by Tennessee Williams and played with finesse by Paul Newman. We saw their struggle and pitied their battle with booze. Sometimes they recovered. In Days of Wine and Roses, Jack Lemmon does and his screen wife, Lee Remick doesn't.

Tormented alcoholic Ben (Nicholas Cage) leaves his home and family to drink himself to death in Las Vegas.

Nicolas Cage plays Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic who has just lost his family and his job. He takes his severance paycheck, and drives out to Las Vegas to drink himself to death.

139905,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,0792838068,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 4]","Leaving Las Vegas was released in 1995, which was many moons ago.  I can recall seeing the 10:00pm showing with two of my friends.  We decided we wanted to go to the movies and out of the choices at the theater in question, we went to see Leaving Las Vegas.  I recall it being very cold outside that night, the weather that evening would later play a part in our souls.Once the movie was over, the three of us were speechless.  Some good adjectives to describe our mood after witnessing Leaving Las Vegas, morose, forlorn, detached and just plain sad.  The only thing to lift our spirits was a middle of the night visit to Denny's for some greasy food.Now I haven't seen this movie since 1995, until the other night.  I watched it with the approach that the movie might not seem quite as sullen as it did oh so many years ago.  However, the motion picture was still deep and dejecting.As for the movie itself, Leaving Las Vegas is wonderful piece of cinema.  A dark and depressing drama, that at times haunts the viewer, but nevertheless a remarkable movie.  As for the acting, well it is top notch.  This is the last great movie Nicolas Cage has made; except maybe Face Off, some of his recent roles are real laughing stocks, i.e. Next, Gone in Sixty Seconds and Ghost Rider.  Elizabeth Shue's acting was also very good, a big leap from Adventures in Babysitting, Cocktail and The Karate Kid.  I also enjoyed Julian ""Warlock"" Sands as the Latvian pimp, and why Richard Lewis was in this movie puzzles me as much as who's the inspiration for the Mona Lisa.Now this movie does have its flaws.  I find it interesting that Shue's character was ravishing, sophisticated, unpolluted, insightful and moral, for a prostitute.  (If you can show me a call girl with those traits, then every red cent I earn will go towards the institute that is prostitution, and Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman doesn't count.)  The events that transpire to Shue in the film, along with her relationship with Cage's character, and her reminiscing with the ""unnamed"" individual through out the film, screams Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  However, I have never seen an individual with PTSD be as pseudo-jovial as Shue's character is in this movie.  Therefore, if you are looking for restitution of the human condition, this might or might not be the movie for you.  Though if you want to see Nick Cage drinking his soul out and Liz Shue, a call girl with a heart. Then this absolutely is the movie for you.I did find an interesting conduit with this movie; it is the unofficial sequel to City of Angels. It might sound silly, but watch City of Angels and follow Nicolas Cage's character in that movie until the end credits.  Once City of Angels is over; it seems pretty easy for Cage's character to continue into Leaving Las Vegas.  Without giving too much information about either movie, Cage's characters can blend into one and other. The key to this trick is too look at the obvious dichotomy among characters when watching both movies. I guarantee you will get it.  So if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon, watch City of Angels and then Leaving Las Vegas.  You might be disappointed, but not surprised.Here is another interesting tidbit; Elizabeth Shue's character in Leaving Las Vegas is Sara with an E. Therefore the name is Sera.  In The Karate Kid her name is Ally with an I.  Therefore the name is Ali.  Now is it just me or does that seem just a little too convenient?I digress to that cold night in 1995, when the mood of the chilly weather suited the deflated spirits of my friends and I, after we left the theater.  It almost appeared that the movie produced the cold and aloof temperature outside that night.  Who knows, maybe it really wasn't that frosty out, but our composure after watching this emotional roller coaster made it seem colder that it actually was.  Which is the feeling Leaving Las Vegas left for three young men that night.  It made us dismal and somber, with the only fix being greasy food.  Just as Nicolas Cage's character only fix towards his gloomy and tragic life was alcohol.Told you the temperature had a frame of reference.",4,No Viva When You Leave Las Vegas,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,4156,"['Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'was', 'released', '1995', 'was', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'can', 'recall', 'seeing', '10:00pm', 'showing', 'two', 'friends', 'decided', 'wanted', 'go', 'movies', 'choices', 'theater', 'question', 'went', 'see', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'recall', 'being', 'very', 'cold', 'night', 'weather', 'evening', 'would', 'later', 'play', 'part', 'souls.Once', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'three', 'were', 'speechless', 'good', 'adjectives', 'describe', 'mood', 'witnessing', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'morose', 'forlorn', 'detached', 'just', 'plain', 'sad', 'only', 'thing', 'lift', 'spirits', 'was', 'middle', 'night', 'visit', 'Denny', 'greasy', 'food.Now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', '1995', 'other', 'night', 'watched', 'approach', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'seem', 'quite', 'as', 'sullen', 'did', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'However', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'still', 'deep', 'dejecting.As', 'movie', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'cinema', 'dark', 'depressing', 'drama', 'times', 'haunts', 'viewer', 'nevertheless', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'acting', 'well', 'top', 'notch', 'last', 'great', 'movie', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'made', 'maybe', 'Face', 'Off', 'recent', 'roles', 'are', 'real', 'laughing', 'stocks', 'i.e', 'Next', 'Gone', 'Sixty', 'Seconds', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'big', 'leap', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'Cocktail', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Julian', 'Warlock', 'Latvian', 'pimp', 'why', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'was', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'who', 'inspiration', 'Mona', 'Lisa.Now', 'movie', 'have', 'flaws', 'find', 'interesting', 'Shue', 'character', 'was', 'ravishing', 'sophisticated', 'unpolluted', 'insightful', 'moral', 'prostitute', 'can', 'show', 'call', 'girl', 'traits', 'then', 'red', 'cent', 'earn', 'will', 'go', 'institute', 'prostitution', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Pretty', 'Woman', ""n't"", 'count', 'events', 'transpire', 'Shue', 'film', 'relationship', 'Cage', 'character', 'reminiscing', 'unnamed', 'individual', 'film', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'However', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'individual', 'PTSD', 'be', 'as', 'pseudo-jovial', 'Shue', 'character', 'movie', 'Therefore', 'are', 'looking', 'restitution', 'human', 'condition', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'drinking', 'soul', 'Liz', 'Shue', 'call', 'girl', 'heart', 'Then', 'absolutely', 'movie', 'you.I', 'did', 'find', 'interesting', 'conduit', 'movie', 'unofficial', 'sequel', 'City', 'Angels', 'might', 'sound', 'silly', 'watch', 'City', 'Angels', 'follow', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'character', 'movie', 'end', 'credits', 'Once', 'City', 'Angels', 'pretty', 'easy', 'Cage', 'character', 'continue', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'movie', 'Cage', 'characters', 'can', 'blend', 'one', 'other', 'key', 'trick', 'too', 'look', 'obvious', 'dichotomy', 'characters', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'guarantee', 'will', 'get', 'So', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'watch', 'City', 'Angels', 'then', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'surprised.Here', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'character', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Sara', 'E.', 'Therefore', 'name', 'Sera', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'name', 'Ally', 'name', 'Ali', 'Now', 'just', 'seem', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'convenient', 'digress', 'cold', 'night', '1995', 'when', 'mood', 'chilly', 'weather', 'suited', 'deflated', 'spirits', 'friends', 'left', 'theater', 'almost', 'appeared', 'movie', 'produced', 'cold', 'aloof', 'temperature', 'night', 'Who', 'maybe', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'frosty', 'out', 'composure', 'watching', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'made', 'seem', 'colder', 'actually', 'was', 'Which', 'feeling', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'left', 'three', 'young', 'men', 'night', 'made', 'dismal', 'somber', 'only', 'fix', 'being', 'greasy', 'food', 'Just', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'character', 'only', 'fix', 'towards', 'gloomy', 'tragic', 'life', 'was', 'alcohol.Told', 'temperature', 'had', 'frame', 'reference']",N/A

Metophorically speaking, it's like coming out of a club at closing time, the bright lights come on and your true self is exposed. This movie captures the nature and mentality of an alcoholic. It's not depressing, it's a reality that has been confronted and candidly projected on film, and skillfully acted out by Nicholas Cage.  He captured the essence of an alcoholic and brought to life the struggle of a lost soul who has given up on life.  Elisabeth Shue also does an admiral job playing his love interest.  They both shined in this film, and I'm happy Nicholas won the oscar.",5,Last Call,932774400,"07 24, 1999",1999,650,"['Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'work', 'art', 'one', 'favourite', 'films', 'Metophorically', 'speaking', 'coming', 'out', 'club', 'closing', 'time', 'bright', 'lights', 'come', 'true', 'self', 'exposed', 'movie', 'nature', 'mentality', 'alcoholic', 'not', 'depressing', 'reality', 'been', 'confronted', 'candidly', 'projected', 'film', 'skillfully', 'acted', 'out', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'captured', 'essence', 'alcoholic', 'brought', 'life', 'struggle', 'lost', 'soul', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'life', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'also', 'admiral', 'job', 'playing', 'love', 'interest', 'shined', 'film', ""'m"", 'happy', 'Nicholas', 'won', 'oscar']",N/A

139908,A3MF788QKIS0L4,0792838068,"W. K. Gray ""cretinous layabout""","[0, 0]","Well done movie with an especially engaging performance by Elizabeth Shue. The script painted itself into a corner, in that any outcome more optimistic than the one we got would have been contrived, a happy ending for the sake of a happy ending. Nicholas Cage's character was expressly trying to drink himself to death. Once that gauntlet is thrown, the plot is kinda married to that outcome. Certainly the love of a good hooker is an item in the plus column, but not enough to lift a fella out of ""the hole you're in,"" unless you're making ""Pretty Woman."" This is a nicely executed picture of a pocket of spiritual and emotional pus, but it's a god-awful view, and not much to be done about it.Which leads me to this - there are certain stories (The Doors, Wired, and now Leaving Las Vegas) in which the lead characters display precious little in the way of redeeming qualities, seem hell-bent on destroying themselves, and leave the viewer (me,certainly) wondering why we're supposed to care. None of the characters I've mentioned had it that bad; in fact, they all had kind of plum lives and, had they not thrown it away with both hands, could have retired happy and rich. I might have mustered more sympathy had they not been so resolutely not-likeable.All that aside, this is a well-acted and well-wrought film that achieves an elegiac tone, one that stays with you for a while. I don't see how any person could watch this movie and not take a long, hard look at his own foibles, and certainly not without rueing any part of his or her personality that isn't life affirming, and maybe THAT'S the point.",4,so die already,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,1607,"['Well', 'done', 'movie', 'especially', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'script', 'painted', 'corner', 'outcome', 'more', 'optimistic', 'one', 'got', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'contrived', 'happy', 'ending', 'sake', 'happy', 'ending', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'character', 'was', 'expressly', 'trying', 'drink', 'death', 'gauntlet', 'thrown', 'plot', 'kinda', 'married', 'outcome', 'Certainly', 'love', 'good', 'hooker', 'item', 'plus', 'column', 'not', 'enough', 'lift', 'fella', 'hole', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'making', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'nicely', 'executed', 'picture', 'pocket', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'pus', 'god-awful', 'view', 'not', 'much', 'be', 'done', 'it.Which', 'leads', 'are', 'certain', 'stories', 'Doors', 'Wired', 'now', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'lead', 'characters', 'display', 'precious', 'little', 'way', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'seem', 'hell-bent', 'destroying', 'leave', 'viewer', 'certainly', 'wondering', 'why', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'care', 'None', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'had', 'bad', 'fact', 'had', 'kind', 'plum', 'lives', 'had', 'not', 'away', 'hands', 'could', 'have', 'retired', 'happy', 'rich', 'might', 'have', 'mustered', 'more', 'sympathy', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'resolutely', 'not-likeable.All', 'aside', 'well-acted', 'well-wrought', 'film', 'elegiac', 'tone', 'one', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'person', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'hard', 'look', 'own', 'foibles', 'certainly', 'not', 'rueing', 'part', 'personality', ""n't"", 'life', 'affirming', 'maybe', 'THAT', 'point']",N/A
