So I missed a whole decade of TV and am only catching up now.  Seasons one and two of Third Rock was a blind buy for me, and I was blown away by it. Being a fan of British comedy, I enjoyed the refreshingly non-American off the wall comedy. Lithgow is brilliant. Season two ended with a bang and a larger budget than usual. So I was looking forward to Season three. I'm only a third of the way through, and I am disappointed.First, what was the point of doing the big-budgeted, one hour season ending of year two if they were going to resolve the whole story in less than two minutes at the opening of season three? That made no sense.Second, I was able to swallow my EXTREME dislike of Rosanne and watch the two part season opener. Again, what was the point? Why break up the romance of Dick and Mary in such an uncomfortable (and implausible) way? I can only imagine the writers were going down the 'Cheers' path (romances breaking up and resolving multiple times) which has been done ad nauseam over and over again in American sitcoms.'Scardy Dick' was one of the worst episodes yet. Dick has gone from child-like to whiney.I can only hope the rest of the season improves, and I am looking forward to the John Cleese two-parter.I give it three stars ONLY because of the brilliance of John Lithgow and the other cast members who are able to overcome substandard stories.",3,Season three is a bit of a letdown.,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,1451,"['jobs', 'children', 'rarely', 'got', 'watch', 'prime-time', 'TV', '1990s', 'So', 'missed', 'whole', 'decade', 'TV', 'am', 'only', 'catching', 'up', 'now', 'Seasons', 'one', 'two', 'Third', 'Rock', 'was', 'blind', 'buy', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Being', 'fan', 'British', 'comedy', 'enjoyed', 'refreshingly', 'non-American', 'wall', 'comedy', 'Lithgow', 'brilliant', 'Season', 'two', 'ended', 'bang', 'larger', 'budget', 'usual', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Season', 'three', ""'m"", 'only', 'third', 'way', 'am', 'disappointed.First', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'doing', 'big-budgeted', 'one', 'hour', 'season', 'ending', 'year', 'two', 'were', 'going', 'resolve', 'whole', 'story', 'less', 'two', 'minutes', 'opening', 'season', 'three', 'made', 'sense.Second', 'was', 'able', 'swallow', 'EXTREME', 'dislike', 'Rosanne', 'watch', 'two', 'part', 'season', 'opener', 'Again', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'Why', 'break', 'up', 'romance', 'Dick', 'Mary', 'such', 'uncomfortable', 'implausible', 'way', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'writers', 'were', 'going', ""'Cheers"", 'path', 'romances', 'breaking', 'up', 'resolving', 'multiple', 'times', 'been', 'done', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'over', 'again', 'American', 'sitcoms', 'Dick', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'episodes', 'yet', 'Dick', 'gone', 'child-like', 'whiney.I', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'rest', 'season', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'John', 'Cleese', 'two-parter.I', 'give', 'three', 'ONLY', 'brilliance', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'overcome', 'substandard', 'stories']",3rd Rock from the Sun: Season 3

958006,A3EI013D39PC1T,B000CEXF6A,"M. Hummel ""mh1957""","[17, 18]","Seasons 1 and 2 were a blast, filled with great ensemble fun fueled by the sheer wackiness of the premise wherein four aliens are discovering everything from kleenex and sushi to what it means to be a man, a woman, a teenager.  A big mistake that set Season 3 off on the wrong foot was the inexplicable decision to break up all of the major relationships of the show--Dick and Mary, Tommy and August, Sally and Don--within the first few weeks of the season.The show was always madcap, but it also had a sensitivity and sweetness that are missing while the characters snipe at each other as a result of their various breakups.  Tommy and August were so precociously funny, Sally and Don were straight out of film noir, and Dick and Mary were sweet and crazily witty.  Because of the breakup of Dick and Mary, the show's center is now off-kilter.  Jane Curtin has much less to do in this season, now that her character has separated from Dick.I can guess why they engineered these breakups.  They feared they'd written themselves into a corner.  But if you're going to break up Dick and Mary, the main focus of much of the show, you should use that breakup wisely.  I most certainly would have had Dick pining for Mary even while he tries to go out with other women.  And the two parter where Roseanne shows up as Dick's assigned alien spouse just didn't work for me--the whole breakup seems artificial, and much of the humor in this season seems forced.  Again, if you're gonna break them all up, you'd better have something good to fill the void, and they don't.Individual episodes are still good, but some seem so forced--Scaredy Dick is the worst episode in the first three seasons, contrived and seemingly slapped together.  I could see Mrs. Dubcek coming out of that basement the second I heard the first ""ghostly"" moan.  I found myself saying ""this is so sitcommy.""I would also guess that a new production and/or writing team took over this season, because so much here is just flat or not fully imagined.  The show had depth AND wit, and now it just has wit, without polish which is not always enough.Still, I give it three stars because of the wonderful, wonderful cast, even if the plots and scripts aren't always up to their talent level.",3,A Big Drop Off In Quality From Seasons 1 and 2,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,2247,"['Seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'blast', 'filled', 'great', 'ensemble', 'fun', 'fueled', 'sheer', 'wackiness', 'premise', 'wherein', 'four', 'aliens', 'are', 'discovering', 'everything', 'kleenex', 'sushi', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'woman', 'teenager', 'big', 'mistake', 'set', 'Season', '3', 'wrong', 'foot', 'was', 'inexplicable', 'decision', 'break', 'up', 'major', 'relationships', 'show', 'Dick', 'Mary', 'Tommy', 'August', 'Sally', 'Don', 'first', 'few', 'weeks', 'season.The', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'madcap', 'also', 'had', 'sensitivity', 'sweetness', 'are', 'missing', 'characters', 'snipe', 'other', 'result', 'various', 'breakups', 'Tommy', 'August', 'were', 'so', 'precociously', 'funny', 'Sally', 'Don', 'were', 'straight', 'film', 'noir', 'Dick', 'Mary', 'were', 'sweet', 'crazily', 'witty', 'breakup', 'Dick', 'Mary', 'show', 'center', 'now', 'off-kilter', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'much', 'less', 'do', 'season', 'now', 'character', 'separated', 'Dick.I', 'can', 'guess', 'why', 'engineered', 'breakups', 'feared', ""'d"", 'written', 'corner', ""'re"", 'going', 'break', 'up', 'Dick', 'Mary', 'main', 'focus', 'much', 'show', 'should', 'use', 'breakup', 'wisely', 'most', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Dick', 'pining', 'Mary', 'even', 'go', 'out', 'other', 'women', 'two', 'parter', 'where', 'Roseanne', 'up', 'Dick', 'assigned', 'alien', 'spouse', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'whole', 'breakup', 'artificial', 'much', 'humor', 'season', 'forced', 'Again', ""'re"", 'gon', 'break', 'up', ""'d"", 'better', 'have', 'something', 'good', 'fill', 'void', ""don't.Individual"", 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'seem', 'so', 'forced', 'Scaredy', 'Dick', 'worst', 'episode', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'contrived', 'seemingly', 'slapped', 'together', 'could', 'see', 'Mrs.', 'Dubcek', 'coming', 'out', 'basement', 'second', 'heard', 'first', 'ghostly', 'moan', 'found', 'saying', 'so', 'sitcommy', 'would', 'also', 'guess', 'new', 'production', 'and/or', 'writing', 'team', 'took', 'over', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'just', 'flat', 'not', 'fully', 'imagined', 'show', 'had', 'depth', 'AND', 'wit', 'now', 'just', 'wit', 'polish', 'not', 'always', 'enough.Still', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'even', 'plots', 'scripts', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'up', 'talent', 'level']",3rd Rock from the Sun: Season 3
