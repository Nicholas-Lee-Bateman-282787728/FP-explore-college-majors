Two major characters -mother's and Eleonor's acting is not that great. Music is not very inspiring and not much of it either, and because of that movie in general feels quite dry to me. Not even one song...I think music is extremely important in creating movie's mood.Positives - beautiful scenery and costumes. I loved little Margaret and Marianne -almost more than in 1995 version.As far as dvd meant to UK region -it is less expensive, so I bought that version -you can play it on your computer, but keep in mind, that computer can reset region just 4 times totally(at least my hp computer), so if you want to watch it many times between region 1 dvds, then you'll have to buy multiregion dvd player.",3,Not nearly as good as 1995 version,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,819,"['nice', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'seen', '1995', 'version', 'might', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'What', 'lacking', 'Two', 'major', 'characters', '-mother', 'Eleonor', 'acting', 'not', 'great', 'Music', 'not', 'very', 'inspiring', 'not', 'much', 'movie', 'general', 'feels', 'quite', 'dry', 'Not', 'even', 'one', 'song', 'think', 'music', 'extremely', 'important', 'creating', 'movie', 'mood.Positives', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'loved', 'little', 'Margaret', 'Marianne', '-almost', 'more', '1995', 'version.As', 'far', 'dvd', 'meant', 'UK', 'region', '-it', 'less', 'expensive', 'bought', 'version', '-you', 'can', 'play', 'computer', 'keep', 'mind', 'computer', 'can', 'reset', 'region', 'just', '4', 'times', 'totally', 'least', 'hp', 'computer', 'so', 'want', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'region', '1', 'dvds', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'buy', 'multiregion', 'dvd', 'player']",N/A
1124808,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B001061UPM,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","A solid adaptation that didn't quite match up to the Ang Lee and Emma Thompson film.That had more energy, pace, intensity and humor. This is more lyrical and gentle, whichworks almost as well... for a while.I actually loved the first two hours, but the last hour didn't work as well for me, perhapsbecause of the different overall tone. The climax felt more soap opera-ish, andalso more uneven, with the slightly jarring attempts at humorous over the top characterizationsclashing with the more subtle feel of the piece. The acting is generally excellent, but there weretimes when performers didn't quite seem to all be in the same film.Worth seeing if you are an Austen fan, but if you only need one film version to be happy, I'dget the Lee feature first.",4,"Quite good, if not quite a match for the Ang Lee version",1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,756,"['solid', 'adaptation', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'up', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'had', 'more', 'energy', 'pace', 'intensity', 'humor', 'more', 'lyrical', 'gentle', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'while.I', 'actually', 'loved', 'first', 'two', 'hours', 'last', 'hour', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'perhapsbecause', 'different', 'overall', 'tone', 'climax', 'felt', 'more', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'andalso', 'more', 'uneven', 'slightly', 'jarring', 'attempts', 'humorous', 'top', 'characterizationsclashing', 'more', 'subtle', 'feel', 'piece', 'acting', 'generally', 'excellent', 'there', 'when', 'performers', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'film.Worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'Austen', 'fan', 'only', 'need', 'one', 'film', 'version', 'be', 'happy', ""I'dget"", 'Lee', 'feature', 'first']",N/A

Elinore is right in step with her character in the book, Dan Stevens (currently enjoying Downton Abbey fame) is wonderful as Edward and Marianne is much less abrasive than another actress who had played her in another version. The chemistries between the players are quite tangible. My favorite in this series is the Colonel; he is deeply emotional but does not wear it on his sleeve.I also like that the men are shown doing more than drinking tea! I recommend this to anyone liking Jane Austin period dramas.My only complaint is I have to watch this DVD on my laptop because it is an English version and it doesn't play on my TV due to my American DVD player. I'm still happy I bought it.",4,Very nicely done vesion of Sense & Sensibility,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,800,"['watch', 'lot', 'British', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'adaptation', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Elinore', 'right', 'step', 'character', 'book', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'currently', 'enjoying', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'fame', 'wonderful', 'Edward', 'Marianne', 'much', 'less', 'abrasive', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'version', 'chemistries', 'players', 'are', 'quite', 'tangible', 'favorite', 'series', 'Colonel', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'not', 'wear', 'sleeve.I', 'also', 'men', 'are', 'shown', 'doing', 'more', 'drinking', 'tea', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'liking', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'period', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'watch', 'DVD', 'laptop', 'English', 'version', ""n't"", 'play', 'TV', 'due', 'American', 'DVD', 'player', ""'m"", 'still', 'happy', 'bought']",N/A
