This program won many Emmey's, Asner himself picking up two for outstanding actor. It also won many other awards. I like the cast, and it is good to see Asner making an honest living after that run on The Fbi. The picture quality is good, but it is streaming. You can't buy this any other way, this the only way to see it. If your not sure, try an episode, I don't think you can go wrong.",5,I'm so glad I ordered this!,1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,594,"['really', 'fun', 'show', 'watch', 'many', 'topics', 'many', 'funny', 'lines.It', 'retro', 'tv', 'late', '70', 'being', 'spin-off', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'program', 'won', 'many', 'Emmey', 'Asner', 'picking', 'up', 'two', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'also', 'won', 'many', 'other', 'awards', 'cast', 'good', 'see', 'Asner', 'making', 'honest', 'living', 'run', 'Fbi', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'streaming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'other', 'way', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'not', 'sure', 'try', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'go', 'wrong']",N/A

His days in television behind him, Lou moves to Los Angeles and interviews for the position of city editor for the Los Angeles Tribune. The interviewer is his old friend Charlie Hume but Lou must also be accepted by Margaret Pynchon, majority owner of the paper. Margaret is a bit eccentric, but she is newspaper to the core.Lou is hired and he immediately works to improve the quality, including injecting new life into a senior reporter. While the premiere episode must take the extra time needed to introduce the primary characters, it is easy to see why this show was so popular and the winner of multiple Emmys. All of the main characters have their quirks and there are clashes between the reporters, yet at the end, as Lou says, ""We are a newspaper after all."" One can look ahead and see a lot of potential when Margaret Pynchon stops and asks Lou if he needs a lift. You expect the two of them to reach an understanding and you are surprised when Lou asks her, ""Isn't it out of your way?"" and her response is to say, ""Yes it is"" and she drives off leaving Lou at the bus stop. An odd, yet suitable ending to what is an opening statement.",5,"From this initial episode, you can see why the show won multiple Emmys",1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,1284,"['was', 'big', 'fan', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'popped', 'tape', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'Lou', 'Grant', 'spinoff', 'days', 'television', 'Lou', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'interviews', 'position', 'city', 'editor', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Tribune', 'interviewer', 'old', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'Hume', 'Lou', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'accepted', 'Margaret', 'Pynchon', 'majority', 'owner', 'paper', 'Margaret', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'newspaper', 'core.Lou', 'hired', 'immediately', 'improve', 'quality', 'including', 'injecting', 'new', 'life', 'senior', 'reporter', 'premiere', 'episode', 'must', 'take', 'extra', 'time', 'needed', 'introduce', 'primary', 'characters', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'winner', 'multiple', 'Emmys', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'quirks', 'are', 'clashes', 'reporters', 'yet', 'end', 'Lou', 'are', 'newspaper', 'One', 'can', 'look', 'ahead', 'see', 'lot', 'potential', 'when', 'Margaret', 'Pynchon', 'stops', 'asks', 'Lou', 'lift', 'expect', 'two', 'reach', 'understanding', 'are', 'surprised', 'when', 'Lou', ""n't"", 'way', 'response', 'say', 'Yes', 'leaving', 'Lou', 'bus', 'stop', 'odd', 'yet', 'suitable', 'ending', 'what', 'opening', 'statement']",N/A

Not only did it provide some fine acting (Ed Asner and Nancy Marshand), the storylines were always interesting and provocative.

Typical of Lou Grant, I couldn't stop until the episode finished. I love this show, and this episode is as good as any others I have seen.The description given in the synopsis is accurate: a young man takes Tribune reporters hostage in order to help clear his brother's name. It gets into the relations formed by the hostages and the hostage taker (terrorist is not quite the right word).The program is from a time when newspapers ruled the news media (alas, the influence of newspapers has declined to a point where too many people get their news from questionable sources), and it is  a fun flashback to an era when cities were defined by the quality of their newspapers. I always thought the Tribune was like the Herald Examiner competing against the Los Angeles Times, but I digress ...
