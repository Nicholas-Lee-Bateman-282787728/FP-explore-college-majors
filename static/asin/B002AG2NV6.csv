1258133,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B002AG2NV6,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[3, 7]","This sugary musical tells the story of a Parisian music hall in 1936. The place is failing, threatened by a ruthless landlord who  makes common cause with fascists and an anti-Semitic political party. A rag-tag band of workers, led by Pigoli, the man who raises and lowers the curtain over the stage, form a cooperative to save the theater. Their potential savior arrives in the shape of Douce, a hauntingly beautiful young woman who has unexpected talent as a singer and who falls in love with the communist who operates the lights in the theater.She's played by the lovely young Nora Arnezadar in her movie debut. A featurette also included in the DVD tells how Arenzadar was discovered at an audition and adds a ""Star Is Born"" commentary to the movie. She is indeed by far the best thing in the movie, apart from the music which is great.There are a couple of side plots about how Pigoli's wife abandons him and takes away his beloved son, Jo-Jo, who is learning the accordian. This movie works hard to move the viewer's tear glands, never missing a chance to go for the cheap, emotional effect. The musical interlude toward the end of the movie is charming. The songs are oh-so-Parisian and very evocative.But this movie flirts with something bigger. It continually alludes to the political situation, with the socialist government of Leon Blum battling strikes, the menacing presence of Hitler just across the border and the growth of ultra-right racism in Paris itself. Yet the movie ultimately dodges and ducks all these questions. We know that the Germans will soon occupy Paris and we want to know what happened to the protagonists. But the movie doesn't tell us. We see Pigoli released from prison in 1945 and we know that Jo-Jo grows up to be a star -- but we don't know what happens to Douce and her lover.This movie is quite enjoyable -- but ultimately soft and saccharin.",3,Nice music but the movie dodges tough issues,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,1885,"['sugary', 'musical', 'tells', 'story', 'Parisian', 'music', 'hall', '1936', 'place', 'failing', 'threatened', 'ruthless', 'landlord', 'who', 'common', 'cause', 'fascists', 'anti-Semitic', 'political', 'party', 'rag-tag', 'band', 'workers', 'led', 'Pigoli', 'man', 'who', 'curtain', 'stage', 'form', 'cooperative', 'save', 'theater', 'potential', 'savior', 'arrives', 'shape', 'Douce', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'unexpected', 'talent', 'singer', 'who', 'love', 'communist', 'who', 'lights', 'theater.She', 'played', 'lovely', 'young', 'Nora', 'Arnezadar', 'movie', 'debut', 'featurette', 'also', 'included', 'DVD', 'how', 'Arenzadar', 'was', 'discovered', 'audition', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', 'commentary', 'movie', 'indeed', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'apart', 'music', 'are', 'couple', 'side', 'plots', 'how', 'Pigoli', 'wife', 'abandons', 'away', 'beloved', 'son', 'Jo-Jo', 'who', 'learning', 'accordian', 'movie', 'hard', 'move', 'viewer', 'tear', 'glands', 'never', 'missing', 'chance', 'go', 'cheap', 'emotional', 'effect', 'musical', 'interlude', 'end', 'movie', 'charming', 'songs', 'are', 'oh-so-Parisian', 'very', 'evocative.But', 'movie', 'something', 'bigger', 'continually', 'political', 'situation', 'socialist', 'government', 'Leon', 'Blum', 'battling', 'strikes', 'menacing', 'presence', 'Hitler', 'just', 'border', 'growth', 'ultra-right', 'racism', 'Paris', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'questions', 'know', 'Germans', 'will', 'soon', 'occupy', 'Paris', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'protagonists', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'see', 'Pigoli', 'released', 'prison', '1945', 'know', 'Jo-Jo', 'up', 'be', 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Douce', 'lover.This', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'ultimately', 'soft', 'saccharin']",N/A
1258134,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002AG2NV6,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[16, 19]","The musical film from France that has received critical acclaim worldwide.""Paris 36"" (Faubourg 36) is a wonderful and enchanting film directed and written by Christophe Barratier (Producer of ""Winged Migration"" and ""As Life Goes By"").  The film is co-written by Julien Rappeneau (""Have Mercy on Us All"" and ""A Ticket to Space"") and Pierre Phillippe (""We Forget Everything!"" and ""A Rare Bird"").  Joining Christophe with the film is cinematographer Tom Stern (""Gran Torino"", ""Changeling"", ""Things We Lost in the Fire"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"") and composer Reinhardt Wagner (""Don't Worry, Be Happy"", ""Towards Zero"" etc.).The film would feature an outstanding soundtrack but also would introduce the world to a new star named Nora Arnezeder who can act and sing and just shines along with her castmates in this irresistible film.""Paris 36"" begins in the Paris suburb, Faubourg in 1936.  A man named Pigoil (Gerard Jugnot) is being questioned by the police for something tragic that had happen that night.  Pigoil then begins his story.Pigoil is the stage manager for the theater known as Chansonia.  His life was thought to be OK while working with hard in the theater with lighting operator Milou (Clovis Cornillac) and performer/worker Jacky (Kad Merad) until his wife became unfaithful (with several men) and has left him. Also, the fascist and ruthless businessman Galapiat (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu) wants his payment for the theater but the owner of the theater is not making enough money to pay right away.  As the actors at the Chansonia try to celebrate New Year's Eve, the owner of the Chansonia knowing that he doesn't have the money to keep the theater afloat, commits suicide.Fast forward four months later, Pigoil is left to take care of his son Jojo (Maxence Perrin) after his wife has run out on him with another man and to make things worse, France is in political turmoil and people are broke and all hell has broken lose.  The Chansonia has been bought and shut down by Galapiat and everyone seems to be unemployed and Milou seems to have joined the Red Army.  But things continue to get worse with Pigoil when his son is caught peddling on the street with his friend (playing the accordion for money) and ends up losing his son, who now moves in with his mother.Pigoil has hit bottom.  With nothing to lose, he approaches his former staff to occupy and re-open the Chansonia and through hiring new talent, finding a way to keep the theater open but also for people to get paid.  Immediately, all the former workers at the theater decide to help Pigoil, including Jacky and Milou and they work hard to restore the theater, hire new talent and hopes to get a loan to keep the theater afloat.Meanwhile, Douce (Nora Arnezeder) comes to Faubourg in search of the former owner of the Chansonia.  She meets up with Galapiat who starts to fance the beautiful young woman who is trying to start her singing career.  He then has her audition at the Chansonia.  Of course, because it's a woman sent by Galapiat, the three men - Pigoil, Jacky and Milou are a bit standoffish of hiring her.  But Douce is not only beautiful but she has a wonderful voice and body that Pigoil knows will attract the audience.The story of ""Paris 36"" starts to focus on these characters as Pigoil tries to restart the Chansonia but missing his son so much, he does what he can to contact him to no avail.  Jacky wants to become a theater star but his comedy is quite terrible but he is hired by Galapiat to relay any information about Douce and what is going on with the Chansonia (and thus betraying his comrades) while Milou shows disdain towards Douce because of her association with Galapiat, but for Douce...she thinks that Milou behaves that way towards her because he is attracted to her.The show must go on to bring the Chansonia back but will the talent be enough for the audience to come daily and pay?  Will Pigoil succeed in bringing the theater back to becoming financially successful but most of all, getting in touch with his son?  Will Jacky's comrades find out that he's spying on them?  What of Milou and Douce?Needless to say that this is only a summary of just a small part of ""Paris 36"".  There is more to the story of these individuals but also the magic of their performances which the company must go through imaginable rough spots before success but for that success, why is Pigoil being questioned by the police at the beginning of the film?  What tragedy awaits for any of these individuals?VIDEO & AUDIO:I was quite impressed by the look of ""Paris 36"".  The film is presented in 2:40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and this suburb captures the city around the Chansonia.  Everything looks so real but you often wonder if its a real studio set, CG-based or what?  There is a lot of grit and grime on the buildings, details from the handwritten letters on the buildings. I thought that a lot of the film (around the Chansonia) was shot in Paris and had utilization of CG but what was more surprising was to find out that a village was actually created in an open field (there is a wonderful featurette that goes into detail about this).  Very impressive.This is one of the films that I really wish would get a Blu-ray release because there are so many details within the buildings and interiors, especially the vibrant colors that would benefit from High Definition but for the DVD, picture quality is fine.  One scene includes a wonderful Busby Berkeley style of performance that is just vibrant and beautiful to watch.  For France, this type of filmmaking is rare to see but Christophe Barratier and Tom Stern capture the look and beauty of the theater performances quite extraordinarily well.  This is a beautiful film to watch!As for the audio, the film is presented in French 5.1 (Dolby Digital) and for the most part, the film is driven by its dialogue and music.  Once Nora Arnezeder took the stage, just hearing her vocals just captured my attention.  And from that point, her character brings life into the other characters and the music turns from campy and humorous to a wonderful and beautiful music.  Suffice to say, immediately after watching this film, I started looking for the movie soundtrack.  That is how much I loved the music of this film.As for the subtitles, optional English subtitles are provided.SPECIAL FEATURES:""PARIS 36"" comes with the following special features:* Commentary with Writer/Director Christophe Barratier and Actress Nora Arnezeder - A very informative commentary by director Christophe Barratier and actress Nora Arnezeder.  Christophe sets up the scenes quite nicely and explains in detail of what he wanted to accomplish, how he wanted Clint Eastwood's director Tom Stern to be the cinematographer of the film because of his knowledge of lighting and working with the various talent and what he wanted to bring out in a new/unknown actress Nora Arnezeder.  Nora talks about certain scenes that were quite scary for her (she had to sing in front of a live audience) but for the most part excited and how badly she wanted this role.  The commentary is in English and both are understandable.  Optional English subtitles are included.* Nora Arnezeder: The Young Revelation's Beautiful Adventure - (10:16) This film introduced the world to Nora Arnezeder and this featurette shows how she was cast on the first day and how she had to undergo training for choreography, the filming of her vocal scenes and recording the soundtrack and much more.  A beautiful featurette!* Paris 36: Interview with the actors - (30:45) This section features interviews with the main talent of ""Paris 36'.  About their characters and being part of the film.* The Film Locations: Thomas Lautner's Making Of - (25:10) This is a very impressive featurette showing how the suburb of Faubourg was planned, executed and built in an empty lot.  A village was created and then after filming, the village was then torn down.  It's just impressive of how much went into the planning and building of the theater and its surrounding buildings and capturing that look and feel of 1930's-1940's France.* Deleted Scenes - A total of 14 deleted scenes.* Trailer - (2:30) The original theatrical trailer for the film.JUDGMENT CALL:I absolutely loved ""Paris 36"".After watching this film, I wanted the soundtrack and I wanted to know more about the talent and also know who this actress Nora Arnezeder was.  Needless to say, this film was beautiful to watch.  At first, finding out this film was about the political and economic turmoil of the 1930's, I was wondering if it would be similar to the 1980 Francois Truffaut film ""Le Dernier Metro"" (The Last Metro).But this film is a hybrid film that it manages to feature a romantic drama and a musical all in one.  Unlike ""The Last Metro"" in which the political turmoil and German invasion was a big part of the film, ""Paris 36"" captured the initial feeling of division amongst the French but focus on the primary characters who wanted the show to go on and despite not making any money at first, really believed in their theater and their hopes and dreams in making sure that they give the best performance they can but overcoming difficult challenges during the darkest era for the people in France.The pacing of the film is wonderful and as challenging as I can imagine of balancing the dramatic segments of the film with its musical segments, everything works from beginning to end.I know that I'm gushing about the film and how beautiful, how well-produced and well-acted the film is but if I had to find one nitpicky situation, it's how the film ends with one ending.  As the film does focus on a variety of characters, you wonder what happens to each of the characters at the end.  And I was hoping for that.  But director Christophe Barratier does explain in the commentary that scenes were shot for the other characters but during the testing with the additional scenes with the audience, French viewers felt it was too heavy and thus he limited it to one subtle ending.  Overall, the ending does work quite fine and so, for those who wonder what happens to other characters, it's definitely worth listening to the commentary.""PARIS 36"" is such a wonderful film, even though many of us who do not understand French may not understand what the lyrics of the songs are about, it's no different from listening to opera or international music.  You can hear the passion in the vocals and the music does reach your soul.  It's that effective, it's that addictive and most of all, the whole entire film is just irresistible!""PARIS 36"" is highly recommended!",5,I have one word to describe this film....

1258135,A1ENC0ALMHVBU,B002AG2NV6,"D. HupFons ""Hup234""","[12, 12]","NOTE: This is a niche movie that will appeal mostly to those who enjoy an ensemble cast of lesser known actors & actresses, as well as those who are fans of vaudeville shows (popular mostly in the early part of the 20th century).  It's a musical drama with more pathos than comedy, but it has its humorous moments & a romantic subplot to lighten the more serious plot elements.What I liked the most about it is the human drama of a separated father and young son, played by Gerard Jugnot & Maxence Perrin, respectively. It is the main dramatic subplot that gives additional emotional depth to the main plot -- the life, death, & ""resurrection"" of the local music hall, known as CHANSONIA, located in the Faubourg suburb of Paris.Incidentally Jugnot & Perrin appeared together in LES CHORISTES (also directed by Christophe Barratier), with Jugnot in the role of the music teacher & Perrin one of his young music students.  Kad Merad, who plays the role of Jacky the aspiring stage performer in this film also performed with Jugnot & Perrin in LES CHORISTES.  These 3 plus Clovis Cornillac, who plays the role of lighting technician and social activist form the nucleus of those who work long hours to produce and perform for the locals at CHANSONIA during pre-World War II France.There's plenty to enjoy in this little known production, and one of the brightest surprises is the debut screen performance of young Nora Arnezeder.  Arguably, she steals the show; she seems a natural for the big screen, with a joie de vivre that is infectious and an expressive face that accentuates the beauty and appeal of her pretty face.If you're looking for a film that will take you back to an earlier time when music halls were the main entertainment for the middle and lower classes, this is one to see.",4,Paris 36 -- Oolala!!!,1250294400,"08 15, 2009",2009,1791,"['NOTE', 'niche', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'who', 'enjoy', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'actresses', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'vaudeville', 'shows', 'popular', 'mostly', 'early', 'part', '20th', 'century', 'musical', 'drama', 'more', 'pathos', 'comedy', 'humorous', 'moments', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'lighten', 'more', 'serious', 'plot', 'liked', 'most', 'human', 'drama', 'separated', 'father', 'young', 'son', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Jugnot', 'Maxence', 'Perrin', 'respectively', 'main', 'dramatic', 'subplot', 'additional', 'emotional', 'depth', 'main', 'plot', 'life', 'death', 'resurrection', 'local', 'music', 'hall', 'known', 'CHANSONIA', 'located', 'Faubourg', 'suburb', 'Paris.Incidentally', 'Jugnot', 'Perrin', 'appeared', 'together', 'LES', 'CHORISTES', 'also', 'directed', 'Christophe', 'Barratier', 'Jugnot', 'role', 'music', 'teacher', 'Perrin', 'one', 'young', 'music', 'students', 'Kad', 'Merad', 'who', 'role', 'Jacky', 'aspiring', 'stage', 'performer', 'film', 'also', 'performed', 'Jugnot', 'Perrin', 'LES', 'CHORISTES', '3', 'Clovis', 'Cornillac', 'who', 'role', 'lighting', 'technician', 'social', 'activist', 'form', 'nucleus', 'who', 'work', 'long', 'hours', 'produce', 'perform', 'locals', 'CHANSONIA', 'pre-World', 'War', 'II', 'France.There', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'little', 'known', 'production', 'one', 'brightest', 'surprises', 'debut', 'screen', 'performance', 'young', 'Nora', 'Arnezeder', 'Arguably', 'show', 'natural', 'big', 'screen', 'joie', 'vivre', 'infectious', 'expressive', 'face', 'beauty', 'appeal', 'pretty', 'face.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'earlier', 'time', 'when', 'music', 'halls', 'were', 'main', 'entertainment', 'middle', 'lower', 'classes', 'one', 'see']",N/A

1258137,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002AG2NV6,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","PARIS 36 is a deliciously entertaining blend of history (WW II and the French reaction to the Nazis), of cabarets, French vaudeville, and the fracturing of families that occurred during times of stress - all costumed in a period piece that revives the year 1936 in Paris with gentle humor and sensitivity.  It is as refreshing as anything to come on the screen in a long time.  Writer/director Christophe Barratier (with Pierre Philippe adding the dialogue) serve up this confection with underscored aplomb and the result is delectable!1936, and the streets of Paris are being decimated by the recession/depression of the times: workers are revolting (lead by the handsome young Milou - Clovis Cornillac), the small time theaters such as the Chansonia under the loving direction of Pigoil (G&eacute;rard Jugnot) are on hard times, and the 'big bosses' of the times are finding ways to take over small businesses.  To make things worse, Pigoil's wife runs off with an entertainer, leaving Pigoil to survive unemployment with his beloved son - that son is soon reluctantly moved away to join his prosperous mother and new 'caretaker'.  Into this sad turn of events comes a naive but wondrously winsome lass named Douce (Nora Arnezeder) who takes part in the revitalization of the Chansonia, supplying the meager audience with her growing talent while urging the public to applaud for a a loser of a nice guy performer - Jacky (Kad Merad).  A little star is born. Somehow it all comes together despite innumerable setbacks, and in the end the people own their hearts and regain their pride.It is a simple story, but told with a glow of Parisian bloom that dissipates the gloom of the times and creates a moment of nostalgia well worth remembering.

1258139,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B002AG2NV6,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","Several days after watching this movie, I finally decided that I was not entirely satisfied with what I had watched. I wanted more, and there is a large gap that is missing.  Read on...One of the types of movies I enjoy are ones set in pre-WWII (interwar) Europe: the rise of Fascism and its ""mirror,"" Communism. The movie is simply TWO stories: One about a Faubourg (Paris) ""vaudeville"" theatre attempting to stay afloat just before the breakout of war (Faubourg is basically a microcosm symbolizing the whole of Europe in the movie). The movie is also about a man and his love for/relationship with his son, who is legally taken back by his philandering wife who had run off, leaving the man to raise his son.The movie plays like the theatric cut (not the scene-added director's cut) of ""Cinema Paradiso."" In this regard, I found it unsatisfying. The film makers omit the entire years of the opening of WWII and the problems in wartime Paris. Whether any of these characters would have survived during the Vichy/Nazi era is questionable (and I believe the answer would definitely be ""NO,"" especially the communist). It's simply contrived ""feel good"" storytelling with no regards to history or the reality of the time. I really don't believe it is supposed to be merely a comedy, and the movie feels like propagandic, history-rewritten nonsense: I would even say Pacifist. I know many viewers are not looking for history or politics to be part of a movie, but to eliminate history is problematic, in my opinion.The great ""Busby Berkeley""-like number in the middle of the movie is contrived and out of place (in my opinion, even though it is extremely well-done. It owes more to ""Singin' in the Rain"" and those ""feel good"" Hollywood musicals of lore than to theatre. It's way too silly and unrealistic to be in this movie, one that puts so much effort into CGI effects to show interwar Paris - and those effects are excellent! I wasn't sure which way the movie was supposed to go. It's mostly a drama (really, 2 dramas), but also comedic (the French are great storytellers when they put comedy and drama together, but it doesn't quite work with this movie). However, it's not true to the time and setting. Could anyone imagine this movie set in Berlin?To give credit, it's not a horrible movie. It's entertaining and moving, especially the story of a son and father. I would like to have seen more of a conclusion at the end, and there is no reason not to have one. Some effort was put into the making of the movie. It is flawed, and, personally, by taking out the years of 1937-46, it is poor judgment. By simply noting that the father was in jail and, therefore, it is excusable is buying into the DeGaullian storytelling.  You just can't discount those years as having an effect on the French, especially Parisians and, especially, on what is given by the film makers to be a microcosm of European people. It comes across as DeGaullian storytelling. If the film makers put 30-40 more minutes into the movie (set during the deleted time), I would have been more satisfied.

1258143,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002AG2NV6,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","""Paris 36"" (""Faubourg 36"") is the second feature film of Christophe Barratier. As in his previous film, critically acclaimed ""The Chorus"" that was a huge hit in France in 2004, music plays a significant role in ""Paris 36"" and the soundtrack music is gorgeous. However, as to its storytelling, ""Paris 36"" is a tad disappointing overall.As its title suggests, the film is set in and around 1936, the era of economic hardship and political unrest. Pigoil (G&eacute;rard Jugnot, who played the music teacher in ""The Chorus"") is a dedicated veteran worker at the Chansonia, an old theater in Paris suburb, which has to be closed because of financial difficulties. Pigoil, now unemployed, also loses custody of his only son to his wife who has just left him for another man. But because of one incident at the now-closed theater, Pigoil and his friends including hot-tempered stage technician Milou (Clovis Cornillac) and good-natured but incredibly unfunny entertainer Jacky (Kad Merad) decide to revive their beloved theater.""Paris 36"" sometimes makes me feel like watching classic movies. The gorgeous production designs are something you rarely see in these days (the set was constructed in studio in Prague). The photography (by Tom Stern, ""Changeling"") is moody and elegant. With meticulous visual details that conjure up a period, and great numbers that you would be humming after leaving the theater, ""Paris 36"" is always nice to watch and hear.What ""Paris 36"" doesn't have is a good script. Personally I don't dislike its old-fashioned melodramatic stories, but the overwrought script suffers from too many familiar narrative devices and (mostly flat) characters. The film employs multiple narrative threads - about Pigoil and his accordion-playing son Jojo, Milou and his romance with the theater's new singer Douce (Nora Arnezeder), etc. - but each subplot resolves too quickly, and doesn't allow us to know these characters enough.I liked ""The Chorus"" and I still remember its last scene which was truly moving. I can tell you the last scene of ""Paris 36"" is touching, almost equally. Again I say, the music is wonderful in ""Paris 36.""
