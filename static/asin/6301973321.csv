284405,A1BXPI18MLL5OV,6301973321,"Alexandra Fox ""opera connoisseur""","[0, 0]","This is how it is. The movie is flawless with its filming-the way the shots are posed. The artistic essence of it is great-the letter opener, chime sounds in Asian curio shop, silence and then shots for the shooting, etc. The music is wonderful-the brilliant Max Steiner of course!!!Bette is brilliant as ever!! She makes a believing crafty but innocent character.  She has an art for being able to act so innocent and naive but letting the audience in on her true nature as the sinister character.The Howard Joyce character is good too. Like the Davis character in the way that he seems to be just observant but also all too knowing. He is the wiser, seeming to know all along of Leslie's lies.Herbert Marshall is so annoying. I have never particularly liked him as an actor but they give him the ignorant husband role in this movie. He has an annoying voice, is kind of homely, and simply puts forth an ugh when you see him act. No offense! But he is very good in the role. He makes it very believable.My last comment is Gale Sondergaard. She is impeccable as the Eurasian wife. She gives you chills and has a haunting sort of presence. It is true art in the scene where she and Bette come face-to-face and stare at one another. Bette still plays the innocent but strong character, while she stares Bette down icily. The music plays as Gale and an Asian man exchange hushed quick words in Chinese.SPOILER: The last two scenes are the best. Bette is at the party after she has been found innocent of murder. She is estranged with husband. Herbert tries to mend the relationship. She says she doesn't love him anymore. He leaves. She goes out into the garden to the shed. Gale and the Asian man are waiting. They take a knife-letter opener that was in front of her door and disappeared-and stab her. Dawn comes up. The camera shoots in to the lace knitting Bette had been working on. It flutters in the wind. It is a symbol of her being free of worry-because earlier Bette had stated that she knits because she needs to calm her nerves.The letter is what you call a true classic and artistic and tastefully made film-but somehow it lacks in the storyline.

284406,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301973321,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","Not every black and white film is a noir and not every crime noir has a femme fatale although in both cases many are. Nor are all films based on the work of world literature figures like Somerset Maugham (although his reputation has been eclipsed somewhat since his 1920s-1930s heyday when he produced classics like The Razor's Edge and Of Human Bondage). But the film under review, The Letter, is all of them, kind of. Sure the black and white crime noir is present although with a more than usual amount of melodramatic moments, and as noted so is the world literature authorship.The real question is the femme fatale aspect. Now Bette Davis was an extremely fine actress during her 1940s and 1950s heyday (and earlier as well in such beauties as The Petrified Forest) but she never struck me as a femme fatale like Lana Turner, Lauren Bacall and Rita Hayworth. You know leaving the guys gasping for breath, and asking for more. No question in this role as the put-upon and isolated wife of a manager of a rubber plantation in pre-war (pre-World War II war to be precise) in colonial British Malaysia scorned by a wayward lover she matches any femme fatale with a quick, too quick, trigger finger when things don't go her way. She certainly could use her wiles, feminine or otherwise, to get out from under the law, British colonial style. And she was just psycho enough to stand one's hair on edge.  But a lot of her actions (and frankly Davis' performance) are just too mawkish to root for.Maybe a little sketch of the plot will illustrate the point. As the film opens Ms. Davis is firing away with that old root-a-toot-toot like crazy at that scornful lover (Hammond by name) mentioned above. No question she is a classic murder one case, and let's just wrap it up and ship her off to some English prison. Right. But she has a story; a fantastic story on its face about a known intruder making sexual advances to her while her husband is away. Moreover this is the 1930s colonial outback of the Empire and Bette is the proper wife of a stand-up rubber plantation manager (played by Herbert Marshall).Needless to say, outback or not, murder is murder and the wheels of justice must grind along. A mere formality if her story holds up, a quick trial and she will be free. Except a certain letter, and hence the title of the piece, shows up in mid-plot from her to the intruder. Seems they were lovers, that she had been scorned, and that moreover he had picked up an inconvenient wife, a Eurasian wife to boot. Said letter was in possession of the wife who had her own ax to grind after Bette put six in her husband. A deal between Bette's compromised lawyer and the wife suppressed this piece of key evidence that would convict Bette.Bette thereafter was acquitted. Legally acquitted. But you know how those Eurasian women are. That was not to be the end of it.  Naturally between a woman scorned and a woman bereft of her companion-lover something has to give. And instead of getting the hell out of town on the first boat, canoe or raft like any real femme fatale our Bette just steps into her fatal fate.

284407,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301973321,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","From the opening gunshots to the final, shocking conclusion, `The Letter' is a stunning and provocative film that never lets the audience out of suspense.  With beautifully crafted performances and a stunning script that plays with the audience in more ways than one, this film is one of the best from the 40's, and maybe even one of the best ever.Draped in crisp black and white, `The Letter' opens with a bang, literally, as Bette Davis's character, Leslie, comes barreling out of her front door firing round after round at a man she would later claim attacked her.  On a rubber plantation in Malaysia, Leslie and her husband Robert wait while Howard Joyce (Leslie's lawyer) develops a solid case of self-defense.The only problem is that not even Howard is convinced of Leslie's innocence.The film (running only about 95 minutes) runs at a nice pace, never losing steam or meandering at all, and yet it still manages to flesh out the characters very well.  This is due to some amazing performances.  Anyone who knows me knows that I worship Bette Davis and consider her, quite frankly, the greatest actress of all time.  Her performance here is certainly one of her finest creations.  With a slick control of her own sensuality, and her commanding presence (she is the true definition of a strong woman) Davis flows in and out of each scene with bravado and precision.  Her emotional collapse towards the films end (when her big secret is revealed) is a stunning piece of work.  She is not alone here though, for the entire cast really supports her.  James Stephenson is beautifully conflicted as Howard Joyce, and Herbert Marshall (he reminds me of a young Russell Crowe, more for his features than his acting style) is beautifully restrained as Leslie's doting husband Robert.  A true standout here is Gale Sondergaard, who just sizzles with barely a word as the deceased's scorned widow.Her eyes are so piercing.A true stunner of a film, `The Letter' is daring, sensuous and controversial (that final shot) and I love it for all those reasons.Don't miss this film!",5,"Breathtaking, each and every time...",1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,2069,"['opening', 'gunshots', 'final', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'Letter', 'stunning', 'provocative', 'film', 'never', 'audience', 'suspense', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'performances', 'stunning', 'script', 'audience', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'film', 'one', 'best', '40', 'maybe', 'even', 'one', 'best', 'ever.Draped', 'crisp', 'black', 'white', 'Letter', 'opens', 'bang', 'literally', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'character', 'Leslie', 'barreling', 'front', 'door', 'firing', 'round', 'round', 'man', 'would', 'later', 'claim', 'attacked', 'rubber', 'plantation', 'Malaysia', 'Leslie', 'husband', 'Robert', 'wait', 'Howard', 'Joyce', 'Leslie', 'lawyer', 'solid', 'case', 'self-defense.The', 'only', 'problem', 'not', 'even', 'Howard', 'convinced', 'Leslie', 'innocence.The', 'film', 'running', 'only', '95', 'minutes', 'nice', 'pace', 'never', 'losing', 'steam', 'meandering', 'yet', 'still', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'due', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Anyone', 'who', 'worship', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'consider', 'quite', 'frankly', 'greatest', 'actress', 'time', 'performance', 'here', 'certainly', 'one', 'finest', 'creations', 'slick', 'control', 'own', 'sensuality', 'commanding', 'presence', 'true', 'definition', 'strong', 'woman', 'Davis', 'scene', 'bravado', 'precision', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'films', 'end', 'when', 'big', 'secret', 'revealed', 'stunning', 'piece', 'work', 'not', 'alone', 'here', 'entire', 'cast', 'really', 'James', 'Stephenson', 'beautifully', 'conflicted', 'Howard', 'Joyce', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'young', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'more', 'features', 'acting', 'style', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'Leslie', 'doting', 'husband', 'Robert', 'A', 'true', 'standout', 'here', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'who', 'just', 'sizzles', 'barely', 'word', 'deceased', 'scorned', 'widow.Her', 'eyes', 'are', 'so', 'piercing.A', 'true', 'stunner', 'film', 'Letter', 'daring', 'sensuous', 'controversial', 'final', 'shot', 'love', 'reasons.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film']",N/A

The black and white format gives the film the mystique and the photography is wonderful.  The lighting is superb throughout the film.  The story line is difficult to imagine, but she pulls it off.  When she says, ""Is it because I'm evil?"" you find it difficult to accept.  The widow of the man she murdered is chilling.  When she is on the screen you forget about Ms. Davis and everyone else in the frame.  No doubt this happened somewhere in Malaysia at one time.  I watched it again last night and the chills are still there after all these years.  It is difficult to accept Ms. Davis was born 100 years ago.  Her work is as fresh as yesterday.  She was in her early 30's when she made this.  She could not have fantasized in her wildest dreams what was in store for her in the future.  Awards, heartbreak, illness.

The movie opens with Davis emptying a revolver into the belly of a man (David Newell) - an old friend she claims tried to make advances on her (her husband was away at the time).Soon, though, a letter written by Davis to Newell surfaces which discredits her self-defense plea. Her lawyer (played superbly by James Stevenson), against his better judgment, buys the letter, now in the hands of Newell's widow, for $10,000. Davis is acquited at her trial, but the truth of the letter comes out to her husband (Herbert Marshall), who is willing to forgive her if she'll tell him that she loves him. Davis can't (Newell had been her lover for years). In a very disappointing and anti-climactic ending, Newell's widow stabs Davis with a knife.The movie is excellent all the way up to that final bad scene, with top-notch acting matching a superb script by Howard Koch.

284413,A3EERJGK0VGUM7,6301973321,ChrisWN,"[8, 10]","I won't comment on the film itself, since at this point you've probably read some of the reviews or you could go to imdb to read about the film itself.As for the DVD itself, I must say it is rather disappointing, since it came in the Bette Davis box set with 4 others that didn't have the annoying things that are on this disc.  I will second the complaint(s) about the trailer. Upon inserting the dvd, I got a widescreen (letterboxed) trailer in color for a recent release which was significantly louder than the soundtrack for the film. I was able to stop it and go to the menu, but it does seem that someone did not take as much care in putting together this release as they did for the others. There was also a big hair in the top portion of the screen for a good 3 minutes or so (which seems more oversight than film damage), though otherwise the print looked excellent.  Another annoyance was that during the opening & closing credits the film is presented in letter boxed format, even though it's full frame. Then when the action begins the frame fills to the top of the screen.  This is really distracting & quite annoyed me at first since I had thought they letterboxed a full frame film. The sound quality is also a mixed bag. Midway through the film, particularly in the scene where Bette  & the lawyer visit the ""pawn shop"" the dialogue is inaudible.

284414,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6301973321,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","As the film begins the camera pans over a drowsy, oppressive, tropical night on a rubber plantation on the Malay Peninsula, past the building where the workers are billeted, coming to rest on a white cockatoo silhouetted against a brightly lit bungalow.  BANG! A gun report breaks the stillness, the bird takes flight, the door of the house is flung open and a man staggers out onto the veranda, pursued by a woman in a long flowing robe holding a revolver, which she again shoots at him.  The man grabs futilely at the banister; another bullet pierces his back and pitches him forward down the steps.  He lies sprawled awkwardly facedown on the ground while the expressionless woman continues firing at his still body until the click tells her all the chambers are empty, then the gun drops out of her hand.  And so begins the second and best film adaption of W. Somerset Maugham's melodrama ""The Letter"" brilliantly directed by William Wyler and starring Bette Davis as Leslie Crosbie in one of her most atypical and powerful portrayals.As Leslie tells the story, she shot the man, Geoff Hammond (David Newell), a friend of her husband Robert (Herbert Marshall) and she because he tried to rape her and she was defending her honor.  There is no reason to doubt her; up to now her character has been beyond reproach, she is the perfect Englishwoman and planter's wife, proper, well bred, intelligent and self-assured.  The young magistrate John Withers (Bruce Lester) summoned to the crime scene is awed with admiration at Leslie's courage and her lucid, dispassionate recital of the facts of the murder.  As initially is their friend, barrister Howard Joyce (James Stephenson), who has been summoned by Robert as legal counsel.  However, Joyce seems to have a shred of doubt, after viewing the body, he tells Leslie that some of the shots had to have been made after Hammond was on the ground, but Leslie explains it away.  Although she is confined to jail in Singapore prior to the trial, it is a mere legal formality and everyone treats her as a favored guest rather than a prisoner.  Public opinion in the British colony is definitely on her side, particularly after it is revealed Hammond had a Eurasian wife and secretly owned a gambling house.  Everyone including Joyce is certain she will be acquitted, until his unctuous law clerk Ong Chi Seng (Sen Yung) reveals the existence of a very incriminating letter written the night of the murder from Leslie to Hammond telling him she has to see him, her husband will be away for the night, and she won't answer for the consequences if Hammond doesn't come. Hammond's widow has it, and will sell it for $10,000.  It's imperative that the letter is obtained if Leslie is to be declared innocent.No other director mined the gold out of Bette Davis' performances the way William Wyler could.  Leslie Crosbie stands as one of her finest achievements right up there with Judith Traherne in ""Dark Victory"" and Margo Channing in ""All About Eve"".  The Davis' flamboyance is muted, her Leslie is coolly self-possessed, so that her few flare ups of passion come almost as a shock.  Seemingly serene on the surface, Davis ably suggests there are hot springs of emotion seething underneath, she is hypnotically drawn to the full moon, it seems to cast a spell on her, she is literally moonstruck.  She is a superb lace maker, but doesn't do it for the joy of the delicate beauty she creates, but rather as an outlet to sooth herself, something that will demand all her power of concentration.  Leslie wears a mask and little by little Davis' deftly reveals the true character as the inconsistencies spill out.  This is a subtle and beautifully drawn characterization, a woman neither black nor white in her character, but colored in shades of gray.  For the third year in a row, Davis got a Best Actress Oscar nomination, but unjustly lost the prize to Ginger Rogers in the sappy ""Kitty Foyle.""James Stephenson is equally fine as Howard Joyce, particularly in the final courtroom summation for the jury, when you can see how much his conscience is torturing him.  He was deservedly tapped with a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  As Robert Crosbie, Herbert Marshall brings a sad dignity to this bewildered husband who finds he truly didn't know his wife at all.  A minor flaw in the film is Gale Sondergaard as Mrs. Hammond, a sinister, grotesque Dragon Lady, baleful, menacing and noticeably older than Leslie.  It stretches the imagination to accept that Hammond would prefer her to the younger and more attractive Leslie, unless of course she excelled in the bedroom, but she doesn't seem like she would have or give much joy between the sheets!  Still the scene is memorable where Leslie and Mrs. Hammond meet to exchange the letter, Leslie in a long white full skirted dinner dress cloaked in a elegant white lace shawl of her own creation that veils her head reminds me of a statue of a Spanish Madonna while Mrs. Hammond reptilian in a tight, shiny, armorial gown resembles a cobra ready to strike.  In the television remake in 1982 with Lee Remick playing Leslie, Mrs. Hammond was younger and better looking, which made more  sense of the story. In lesser roles Sen Young as Joyce's law clerk Ong Chi Sing is an insufferably obsequious Asian Uriah Heep, and Frieda Inescourt properly complacent as Joyce's sleek wife Dorothy.This could have been a potboiler; instead under William Wyler's sure guidance and direction, a superior, engrossing melodrama emerges.  He keeps a taut line on the proceedings; from the beginning there is an ominous, disquieting atmostphere as the credits roll with Max Steiner's moody, full-blown musical themes adding immeasurably to the suspense, as does the stark black and white photography of Tony Gaudio.  There is a rising line of tension that doesn't give up straight to the end.  An excellent example of this in a critical scene is the tinkling of glass wind chimes in the breeze, what ordinarily would be a pleasant, lightly musical sound here has a dissonant, ragged, foreboding note of impending danger.  And I'd like to give a final bravo to Howard Koch who skillfully adapted and improved on the original Maugham play, with not a superfluous word or action.About the extras, besides the trailer, there is an alternative ending; the only difference between it and the final film is that a key scene of Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall was unwisely eliminated.  Thankfully it was restored, the film would not have been as strong without it.  There are also two radio adaptations, both starring Bette Davis; the first version also has James Stephenson and Herbert Marshall.  Frankly, I just listened to the first few minutes of that one, it sounded quite similar to the film, I saw no point in listening to the rest, when you can view the original which is of higher rank in every way.",5,"""Be flippant about your own crimes if you want to but don't be flippant about mine!""",1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,6873,"['film', 'camera', 'over', 'drowsy', 'oppressive',

She claims that she was fighting off his sexual advances.Family friend and attorney Howard Joyce played with aplomb by James Stephenson considers Davis' defense a slam dunk until he becomes aware of some incriminating evidence.  A letter penned by Davis turns up.  In it she invites Hammond the man she killed to the plantation in her husband's absence.

Lawyer, Stephenson becomes compelled to procure the letter to quash it as evidence against his client.As written into the Hollywood code in the 40's. all does not end well for the notorious Davis.

284416,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,6301973321,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[2, 2]","From Warner Brothers 1940 comes Bette Davis in one of her best roles. She portrays Leslie Crosby, an unfaithful wife who murders her lover Geoff Hammond in a rage and then concocts a scenario in which she portrays herself as a woman defending her honor during a sexual attack or as her character puts it ""he tried to make love to me"".  Of course, no one really doubts that Leslie is defending her honor, least of all her husband Robert (played by ever trusting and protective Herbert Marshall). Set in Singapore amid steaming jungle, sinister natives, and a seemingly hostile environment, the fact remains that a man has died and Leslie must be tried for murder. Family friend and barrister Howard Joyce (James Stephenson) agrees to defend her though he is a bit suspicious regarding the circumstances. As the case progresses, some highly incriminating letters are are copied and sent R that were written by Leslie to Geoff that make it apparent that Leslie wasn't spurning his advances and was busy making one moves of her own as she attempts to keep the flame burning. However, for the right price(and there always is a price in this movie), the letters can be purchased and an acquittal can be achieved. Unfortunately for Leslie, Robert controls the purse strings and authorizes the purchase of the letters without really knowing their contents. What ensues is a dramatic trial, a cuckholded husband naively  fawning over his faithless wife, and a conflicted attorney who has violated his professional ethics rather than hanging Leslie out to dry.On top of all this, it turns of that Geoff Hammond had a Eurasian wife (played by the ever frightening Gale Sondegaard) who is the mastermind behind the blackmail scheme but has no intention of letting that strumpet Leslie off the hook.Based on a 1927 play of the same name by Somerset  Maugham, the original story translates well to the screen. Directed by William Wyler with a screenplay by Howard Koch this is a tense drama that rises above melodrama. The overall effect foreshadows the cinema noir style that was so popular during that decade.While all the acting is quite good, this ends up being Davis' show as she manages a huge range of emotions without ever really coming across as sympathetic.",5,Bette At Her Unrepentant Best,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2253,"['Warner', 'Brothers', '1940', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'Leslie', 'Crosby', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'who', 'lover', 'Geoff', 'Hammond', 'rage', 'then', 'scenario', 'woman', 'defending', 'honor', 'sexual', 'attack', 'character', 'tried', 'make', 'love', 'course', 'one', 'really', 'Leslie', 'defending', 'honor', 'least', 'husband', 'Robert', 'played', 'ever', 'trusting', 'protective', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'Set', 'Singapore', 'steaming', 'jungle', 'sinister', 'natives', 'seemingly', 'hostile', 'environment', 'fact', 'man', 'died', 'Leslie', 'must', 'be', 'tried', 'murder', 'Family', 'friend', 'barrister', 'Howard', 'Joyce', 'James', 'Stephenson', 'defend', 'bit', 'suspicious', 'regarding', 'circumstances', 'case', 'highly', 'incriminating', 'letters', 'are', 'are', 'copied', 'sent', 'R', 'were', 'written', 'Leslie', 'Geoff', 'make', 'apparent', 'Leslie', 'was', ""n't"", 'spurning', 'advances', 'was', 'busy', 'making', 'one', 'moves', 'own', 'keep', 'flame', 'burning', 'However', 'right', 'price', 'always', 'price', 'movie', 'letters', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'acquittal', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'Unfortunately', 'Leslie', 'Robert', 'purse', 'strings', 'purchase', 'letters', 'really', 'knowing', 'contents', 'What', 'dramatic', 'trial', 'cuckholded', 'husband', 'naively', 'fawning', 'faithless', 'wife', 'conflicted', 'attorney', 'who', 'violated', 'professional', 'ethics', 'rather', 'hanging', 'Leslie', 'dry.On', 'top', 'Geoff', 'Hammond', 'had', 'Eurasian', 'wife', 'played', 'ever', 'frightening', 'Gale', 'Sondegaard', 'who', 'mastermind', 'blackmail', 'scheme', 'intention', 'letting', 'strumpet', 'Leslie', 'hook.Based', '1927', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'original', 'story', 'translates', 'well', 'screen', 'Directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'screenplay', 'Howard', 'Koch', 'tense', 'drama', 'melodrama', 'overall', 'effect', 'cinema', 'noir', 'style', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'decade.While', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'up', 'being', 'Davis', 'show', 'huge', 'range', 'emotions', 'ever', 'really', 'coming', 'sympathetic']",N/A

284419,A2Y5P2A327LMST,6301973321,C. Travis,"[0, 0]","The Letter (1940) is considered a classic melodramatic film noir of adultery and murder, except that it is lacking two important elements of film noir, a voice over and flashbacks. It does have the requisite evil woman who kills her lover, then goes on trial and says that the man tried to rape her. The letter received seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Actress (Betty Davis) and Best Director (William Wyler). An early version of the same movie was made in 1929 staring Jeanne Eagels, who was also nominated for Best Actress. The Wyler version is the much better of the two movies.If you want to see what outstanding direction and screenwriting can do for a movie, it is recommended that you watch the 1929 version first, which is a jewel in itself.  1929 version stars stage actress Jeanne Eagels, in her only surviving talkie performance, (Eagels was a heroin addict and died later that same year). Eagles plays the role as someone who has degenerated and is possible going insane. Davis plays the role as a strictly calculating and deliciously evil woman who knows exactly what she is doing. Seeing one version will not affect your enjoyment of the other version since, while the story is the same in both, the sequence of events is entirely different (this is where the superior direction and screenwriting come in). I thoroughly enjoyed both versions, but believe the Wyler 1940 version is the best telling of the story.

We never see who she loved, but we can guess at someone worth six bullets, and much much more.  The camera enunciates her path toward destruction with tragic intensity, as the film balances between film noir and symbolic drama, between crime and love, as noone has filmed it or acted it before.The opening and the conclusion are remarkable for effects in lighting that  Akira Kurasawa watched in this film, and others too, Lang and John Huston.

284425,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6301973321,Douglas M,"[5, 9]","Times have changed and ""The Letter"", based on a short story and play by W Somerset Maugham, suffers in 2005 from its stagebound roots. The film focuses on dialogue and atmosphere with little action. The modern equivalent would be English TV series such as ""The Forsyte Saga"" or ""Pride and Prejudice"".The plot involves the deception of an unfaithful wife who kills her lover, stands trial but is pronounced innocent of murder but only because an incriminating letter is suppressed. The resolution of the film is compromised from the play by the constraints of the Production Code but it is still harrowing. The film accurately captures the atmosphere and location of Maugham's short story, the narrow and provincial world of the English in Malaya.William Wyler's direction is very tight. His skill with the actors, the sets, establishing a mood etc is outstanding but every moment feels as if it was drawn up with a slide rule. The same applies to Bette Davis's legendary performance as the hypocritical Leslie Crosbie. Davis is riveting but as precise as her diction. Every move she makes feels as if it was carefully choreographed. She is like a coiled spring, ready to explode. Of course, this reflects the knots of her web of deceit hidden beneath the controlled exterior, but at all times, you are aware of ""great acting"". James Stephenson plays her lawyer and his performance is as good as Davis's. Their scenes together are the best in the film as you sit on the edge of your seat watching them play cat and mouse. Stephenson nearly walked off the set from the pressure brought by Wyler but Davis urged him to hang in there because of the great performance Wyler would get and she was right. Herbert Marshall plays Davis's husband very well too. His realisation that he does not know the woman with whom he has been sharing his life is moving. Gail Sondergaard plays the murdered man's Eurasian wife and creates a menacing figure with almost no dialogue.The DVD print is excellent and the package contains an alternate ending which eliminates the fireworks of the released ending but in someways offers a more subtle resolution - interesting to see. One of the fascinations of seeing these alternate scenes is you get an unusual insight into the thought process of the director. The radio transcripts are a waste of time. The plot is compressed and the actors rush through the scripts without any of the pregnant pauses which are so important in the film. Also, why listen to a second rate condensed version of the script when you can watch the real thing?Trivia Note - Cecil Kellaway gets billing, but he is barely in the film.

284427,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6301973321,"""flickjunkie""","[8, 9]","In ""The Letter"" William Wyler takes a predictable plot and turns it into a brilliant film with the help of one of the grande dames of film.  For hell hath no fury like Bette Davis with a revolver in her hand.The film opens with Leslie Crosby (Bette Davis) emptying her revolver into a man on her front porch, shooting him twice after he hits the ground.  She tells the police she was defending herself against his sexual assault.  She seems to be headed for an easy acquittal until (surprise) an incriminating letter surfaces that suggests that she summoned the victim to her house with the clear intention of murdering him.Can the evidence be suppressed?  Will she be acquitted?  Was she really in love with the victim?  The answers to these questions are obvious to all but the most nave viewer.  Yet, despite the transparency of the plot, this film works for two reasons: Bette Davis and William Wyler.Bette Davis is arguably among the best actresses of all time.  She was originally signed by Universal Studios, who dropped her because she didn't have the looks to be a movie star.  Still, Warner Brothers decided to take a chance on her in 1932, signing her to a seven-year contract that would produce two Oscars.  She was nominated for best actress eleven times, winning twice (""Dangerous"", 1936 and ""Jezebel"" 1939).  She was nominated five straight years from 1939 to 1943.  This performance was in the middle of that run.  It is classic Bette Davis, utterly in command of every scene.  Her portrayal of Leslie is superb, a duplicitous and cunning woman who could manipulate any man to do her bidding.  It took another woman to humble her.  This is Davis in her prime and it is awesome to see her at work.  She could make a dog food commercial exciting to watch.What Davis was to acting William Wyler was to directing.  (The two shared more than a professional relationship, and it was widely rumored at that time that they were romantically involved.)  Wyler was nominated for best director twelve times winning three (""Mrs. Miniver"", 1942; ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", 1943; ""Ben Hur"", 1960).  Like Davis, he was also nominated for this film.  Wyler's camerawork here is fantastic.  In black and white films, lighting is critical, because the director doesn't have the luxury of relying on color to dramatize the images.  Aided by veteran cinematographer Tony Gaudio, Wyler's use of lighting and shadows in this film is brilliant.  It could serve as a primer for dramatic black and white cinematography.  Gaudio was also nominated for an Oscar for this film, one of his six nominations in a forty-year career.This film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture, but it was shut out.  Despite a predictable story, I rated it a 9/10 on the strength of the acting, directing and cinematography.  It is an excellent opportunity to see Bette Davis during her glory years in one of her many outstanding performances.",5,"Bette Davis and William Wyler, a winning combination",989366400,"05 9, 2001",2001,2942,"['Letter', 'William', 'Wyler', 'predictable', 'plot', 'brilliant', 'film', 'help', 'one', 'grande', 'dames', 'film', 'hell', 'hath', 'fury', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'revolver', 'hand.The', 'film', 'Leslie', 'Crosby', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'emptying', 'revolver', 'man', 'front', 'porch', 'shooting', 'twice', 'ground', 'police', 'was', 'defending', 'sexual', 'assault', 'be', 'headed', 'easy', 'acquittal', 'surprise', 'incriminating', 'letter', 'surfaces', 'summoned', 'victim', 'house', 'clear', 'intention', 'murdering', 'evidence', 'be', 'suppressed', 'Will', 'be', 'acquitted', 'Was', 'really', 'love', 'victim', 'answers', 'questions', 'are', 'obvious', 'most', 'nave', 'viewer', 'transparency', 'plot', 'film', 'two', 'reasons', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'William', 'Wyler.Bette', 'Davis', 'arguably', 'best', 'actresses', 'time', 'was', 'originally', 'signed', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'who', 'dropped', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'looks', 'be', 'movie', 'star', 'Still', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', '1932', 'signing', 'seven-year', 'contract', 'would', 'produce', 'two', 'Oscars', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'actress', 'eleven', 'times', 'winning', 'twice', 'Dangerous', '1936', 'Jezebel', '1939', 'was', 'nominated', 'five', 'straight', 'years', '1939', '1943', 'performance', 'was', 'middle', 'run', 'classic', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'utterly', 'command', 'scene', 'portrayal', 'Leslie', 'superb', 'duplicitous', 'cunning', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'manipulate', 'man', 'do', 'bidding', 'took', 'woman', 'humble', 'Davis', 'prime', 'awesome', 'see', 'work', 'could', 'make', 'dog', 'food', 'commercial', 'exciting', 'watch.What', 'Davis', 'was', 'acting', 'William', 'Wyler', 'was', 'directing', 'two', 'shared', 'more', 'professional', 'relationship', 'was', 'widely', 'rumored', 'time', 'were', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Wyler', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'director', 'twelve', 'times', 'winning', 'three', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', '1942', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', '1943', 'Ben', 'Hur', '1960', 'Davis', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'film', 'Wyler', 'camerawork', 'here', 'fantastic', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'lighting', 'critical', 'director', ""n't"", 'have', 'luxury', 'relying', 'color', 'dramatize', 'images', 'Aided', 'veteran', 'cinematographer', 'Tony', 'Gaudio', 'Wyler', 'use', 'lighting', 'film', 'brilliant', 'could', 'serve', 'primer', 'dramatic', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'Gaudio', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'film', 'one', 'six', 'nominations', 'forty-year', 'career.This', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'seven', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'best', 'picture', 'was', 'shut', 'out', 'predictable', 'story', 'rated', '9/10', 'strength', 'acting', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'glory', 'years', 'one', 'many', 'outstanding', 'performances']",N/A
284428,A1LOHE2PS10G1G,6301973321,Frank,"[2, 5]","I showed this 1940 film after the 1929 version directed by Jean de Limur from an adaptation by Garrett Fort - in order to compare the acclaimed Bette Davis film with the older version, which I remembered for its wonderfully evocative scene of the bar/brothel where Leslie had to go to retrieve her letter from ""the Chinese woman."" The later film, handicapped by the Code, paled with the comparison, and I had to watch it a second time in order to see why Bette Davis, like Jeanne Eagels before her, was nominated for an Oscar.I much prefer the flawed, but gutsy and passionate 1929 film to the flawed 1940 film, which to me is a bit too much of a caricature of British propriety. Compared with Jeanne Eagels, who played Leslie in 1929, Bette Davis had a very different concept of the role - overly moralistic yet structured. The major problems with the 1940 version were compromises in the storyline, which prudishly toned down the sexual passions that were central to the motivational dynamics of the story, and failed to grasp the cultural contrasts between East and West in colonial Singapore, which created much of the mystery and atmosphere in the 1929 adaptation.The most memorable setting from the 1929 film, which motivated me to revisit it, was developed thoroughly, but gradually enough that it wasn't immediately clear that the place was a bordello.  There was a snake fight, awkwardly inserted into the print that I viewed on DVD, and not what I recalled from seeing the film at a theatre in 1975.  By contrast, the Chinese mistress of Maughan's story became the ""Chinese wife"" of Leslie's lover in the 1940 screenplay, which resulted in a number of illogical distortions and implausible scenes.  This climactic scene in the bordello in the 1929 film has humor and pathos, and is a sufficient victory of the Chinese woman, whereas the parallel scene in the 1940 bowdlerization shows Leslie, protected by her men, gracefully recovering from a somewhat minor slight, which in no way compares with the thorough humiliation that she receives in the bordello in the 1929 version.An actress can approach a role such as this by displaying extreme self-possession through most of the part, in order to heighten the momemt when she loses it.  This is the key to Davis's concept.  She is most interesting in the scene where she learns that the incriminating letter is being used to blackmail her, but to me, far too blithely unconcerned during most of the film.  I also found her unconvincing as a ""dutiful wife"" since her devotion was too dispassionate, which created the impression that even her husband could not have felt too badly about her unfaithfulness, and thus decreased the dramatic potential. Eagels in the early scenes fawned on her husband, in a way that a long-time adultress might be expected to do, so that we could believe that she held her husband's love by her devious wiles. Later, when husband and wife seemed to create their own ""No Exit"" future of mutual contempt, Eagels was well over-the-top in her declaration of passion for the man she killed.  The film ended abruptly and awkwardly at that point, when it should have spent a few more minutes to show the reactions of husband and wife to this conflict that would change their lives dramatically.  While some of the same words were spoken in the 1940 version, Davis was overly controlled. Herbert Marshall as her husband, however, played his role to perfection throughout the film, clearly presenting emotions appropriate to the arc of the plot.  Even when he was listening to other players, he inhabited his role with great assurance.  After this secondary climax, which ended the 1929 film, the 1940 screenplay tacked on an inappropriate sequence, apparently to satisfy the Code and Davis's moral guidelines for stories.  I won't spoil it, but shall maintain my comment that a short follow-up to the secondary climax of the 1929 screenplay would make that a rather satisfying adaptation, faithful to the nature of Maughan's story.The pairing of these two films makes a rather interesting study in adaptation, which goes well beyond these remarks, which are too brief to cover other major plot changes in the later film.  For historians, the comparison provides insight into the alterations in middle class mores that took place between the beginning of the Great Depression and the beginning of World War II.  It is rather amazing to see how differently two accomplished actresses can approach the same character.  In the treatment of the screenplay, it is also interesting to see how the second writer, Howard Koch, chose to expand the role of the lawyer - even to the point of having him reject a sexual overture from Leslie.  His moral dilemma - over suborning evidence - was given great prominence in the 1940 screenplay, but treated with less concern in the 1929 adaptation.  This is part of the emphasis on moral judgement that is a major difference between the two eras. Thus, I recommend both films to those who are interested, as I am, in the art of crafting screenplays, and also to those who study the history of American society.",3,Excellent but over-rated acting;

Many praises have gone deservedly to the cast and to the director, but certainly the cinematography and the sound contribute significantly to the success of the film. Without any special computer effects,  the camera makes the viewer feel the stifling heat of pre-war British Maylay and perceive the ambiguous emotions of the characters, cast into patterned shadow as the white-hot moon penetrates the bamboo blinds. When the barrister (James Stephenson) takes Leslie (Bette Davis) to purchase the incriminating letter from the malevolent widow (Gail Sondergaard), the uncanny wind-bells seem to have been conjured up from the opium pipe that is being smoked by one of the blackmailers.Actually, I prefer the alternative ending, which is less melodramatic.

Based on Somerset Maugham's story, THE LETTER relates the murder of a rubber-plantation owner (Herbert Marshall) in Malaya by his wife (Bette Davis).  It is interesting how Davis approaches this part. She gives a brilliant study of a cold yet proper woman who intoxicates her society friends and authorities through a pretense of female sexual virtue. She deliriously illustrates the passion of a woman who would kill a man for attempting to leave her and in doing so entices the audience on her behalf. Davis is so brilliant at conveying such a cold woman who my in effect really need the warmth and passion of a desperate soul, that even she may not realize her actions are a desperate attempt to realize her own desires. Is her behavior a pretense or not? This was very erotic stuff for its time. This film was nominated for 8 Academy Awards. Carl Jules Weyl's Art Designs combined with Tony Gaudio's Cinematography made a very provocative setting for the images. However the only fault I found with this film was Max Steiner's score.

NEVER!!!) in this intriguing drama of a woman who may or may not be telling the truth about a murder. William Wyler (who had directed Bette Davis two years earlier in Jezebel, which won her an Academy Award, and had just directed Wuthering Heights starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon the previous year) directs this superb adaptation of the play (which I've not seen). Ms. Davis is simply incredible as Leslie, the woman at the center of a homicide investigation who claims to be the victim of unwanted advances. The camera work is absolutely brilliant, particularly in a scene where Leslie is telling her husband and lawyer about the events that led up to the death at the beginning; the camera goes to the drawer and then slowly tracks out to the porch all while Leslie is explaining what happened off-screen. But you simply have to see it to believe it. The music by Max Steiner (who of course had scored Gone With The Wind the previous year, and won an Oscar for it) is appropriately sinister and somber. One final note: Gale Sondergaard, the original choice for the Wicked Witch in The Wizard Of Oz, appears in a small, but crucial role. She is also magnificent, her facial expressions conveying more than mere words on paper can adequately express. View this film.

Michael Click,"[10, 11]","Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: ***1/2  Extras: *****""The Letter"" is one of Bette Davis' finest films from her heyday at Warner Brothers, a sharply written, sumptuously produced, brilliantly directed, hauntingly scored, and exquisitely photographed melodrama that provided the actress with yet another acting plum.  Indeed, Davis enters the film with a Bang! - six of them, in fact, as she dramatically empties a revolver into the body of a man outside her Malayan bungalow.  Claiming that her victim was attempting to force his unwelcome attentions on her, the plucky Davis appears to have provided her attorney with an open-and-shut case of murder in self-defense ... until it becomes known that there exists a certain letter written to the victim, by Davis, on the day of the murder.  Is there more to the story that Davis isn't telling?Davis' Oscar-nominated performance is nothing short of a tour-de-force; she's mesmerizingly restrained throughout, and completely in control of every scene.  Herbert Marshall effectively underplays the role of her loyal, supportive husband, and James Stephenson (also an Oscar nominee) is marvelous as Davis' astute lawyer.  Oustanding work is also offered by Gale Sondergaard as the stoic widow of Davis' victim; aside from a few short sentences spoken in a foreign tongue, the actress delivers her entire performance through a series of beautifully rendered facial expressions.  Her scenes with Davis are among the film's most highly dramatic and crackle with intensity.The DVD transfer of ""The Letter"" is of generally commendable quality, marred only by some excessive graininess during one scene involving a sequence of close-ups, and a few seconds of distortion that caused a thin blue line of light to appear at the bottom of the picture.  The discs extras include two different radio adaptations of the story, both starring Davis and Marshall; the Original Theatrical Trailer; and most interesting of all, an alternate ending sequence that omits a crucial scene between Davis and Marshall ... including Davis' most famous line in the entire script!  (Here's tangible proof of how important editing is to the filmmaking process.)  Overall, ""The Letter"" is a bona fide classic, and a sterling example of the studio system at its best.

Then a letter in her own hand to the man she shot emerges. As best it is ambigous. At worst it indicates they were long time lovers. He is also married & was at her home that night to break it off. Everything she has said up to this point was a lie. Her husband spends his last cent & her lawyer who also has a crush on her do their best to supress the letter.

After four hours of non-stop video games and blaring rap music I had enough. Tired and with a headache, I was ready to put my feet up and soak in some good old fashion entertainment. Luckily, I had the antidote in a recently acquired DVD of the 1940 William Wyler drama/thriller ""The Letter"".This is just the movie to take you away from everything and just suck you in. The film takes place in the exotic Far East of a colonial Singapore rubber tree plantation. In the opening (and best) scene of the movie, we watch as Leslie Crosbie (a brilliant Bette Davis) calmly walks out on her front porch and grimly shoots a man dead as he attempts to flee. In the short aftermath she explains in precise detail to her husband (Herbert Marshall) and the authorities, that she was forced to kill family friend, Geoffrey Hammond, after he tried to sexually attack her. Even though there is dead body lying there with six bullets in it, everyone seems to automatically take Leslie at her word. That is until defense lawyer, Howard Joyce (James Stephenson) starts finding inconsistancies in her story. With each inconsistancy, new facts are revealed, which Leslie tries to explain and rationalize. Things finally come to a head, when an incrimating letter appears, which could possibly doom this murderous woman. We watch how this 'Femme Fatale' with a steely coldness and conviction, will say and do anything to save her own skin. Even if it means hurting everyone around her. When they came up with the saying ""they don't make 'em like they use to"", they must have been thinking of this movie. William Wyler's direction is marvelous. He just gets your attention from that very first riveting, classic shot all the way to the movie's climatic ending. The film features great performances from a wonderful cast. Bette Davis really is just amazing in this villainous role.  Bette plays a woman who is (over) acting out the role of a victim for all the other characters to see. But the viewer understands how subtley, with each roll of those big beautiful eyes, with each furrowed brow and with the tight shots of those nervous, delicate hands, that this is a woman who is constantly scheming and coniving to get her way. Its just an astonishing performance. The supporting cast does an admirable job. Herbert Marshall is very good as the weak, cuckholded, husband. The scene where he finally reads the infamously, incrimating letter is just priceless. He just shows all his emotions in his face. James Stephenson is also very good as the lawyer, who unravels all of Bette Davis' lies and  eventually compromises his own pricinples. Finally, mention should be made for a spellbinding performance from Gale Sondergaard as the mudered man's, Eurasian wife. The character she plays appears mysterious and Sphinx-like. She rarely speaks, yet is a totally commanding presence in every scene she's in. Sondergaard is so good in the role, she actually steals away her big scene with Bette Davis! Now, that takes some doing! Everything seems to work in this movie to create a forboding mood. From Max Steiner's bewitching score to the beautiful, yet eerie, B&W cinematography.

The workers appear to be sleeping peacefully in hammocks drifting in the breeze. Suddenly, the absolute stillness of the night is rendered by gunfire. A man runs out of the main house, and hot on his heels is Leslie Crosbie, mistress of the plantation, emptying her gun into this unfortunate fellow.Leslie Crosbie, cooly played by Bette Davis, has the hired help send for her husband, played by the wonderful Herbert Marshall, who is working. He arrives home, as does the family attorney, marvelously played by the underrated James Stephenson. She tells them what happened. It is essentially a story of self defense in which she fired the gun at the now dead man, who turned out to be a friend of her husband, in order to ward off his unwanted and unexpected sexual advances.She is arrested, though it is taken for granted that she will be acquitted at trial. All is going smoothly, until a letter in Leslie's hand to the deceased surfaces. Its contents call into serious question Leslie's account of what happend that fateful evening. Unfortunately, the letter is in hands of the mysterious Eurasian widow of the dead man. She will, however, sell the letter to Leslie. The attorney initially balks at buying the letter, as it is an act that could result in his disbarment. He ultimately caves out of friendship for Leslie's husband and acquiesces to the unusual arrangement demanded by the widow for its return, in addition to the monetary sum demanded, a sum that will leave Leslie's husband flat broke.The letter is ultimately turned over to Leslie. It is never presented at trial, and Leslie's account of that fateful evening is uncontroverted. Leslie is, of course, acquitted. She returns home with her husband, who, despite having realized that his wife had been unfaithful to him and had loved another, is willing to make a go of their relationship, because he still loves her. Leslie, however, is still enamored of the lover she killed.Gail Sondegaard is unnerving as the Eurasian widow. She appears throughout the film and never utters one word. Yet, her seemingly sinister presence bespeaks volumes. The ending of the film is very Hollywood, but brings the film full circle.

In superb form, Leslie Crosbie (Davis), the wife of the plantation owner portrays an accused murderer on trial for her life after shooting an intruder who made unwanted advances while her husband (Herbert Marshall) was away on business. Covering up a secret long tem affair with her victim, Leslie claims self-defense, managing to fool her social circle, remaining distant throughout the trial, fans spinning away the oppressive heat of the courtroom. Her attorney (James Stephenson) has mounted a simple defense. All goes well until the appearance of an incriminating letter, held by the Eurasian woman Leslie's lover rejected her for, an exotic and unforgiving creature who has been induced to sell the letter to Leslie and her attorney for an exorbitant amount.Skillfully feigning innocence until confronted with the proof of her extra-marital affair, Leslie attempts to manipulate the emotions of her attorney, but to no avail, her fainting spells and huge pleading eyes an insufficient deterrent in his justified outrage. Appealing to his loyalty and respect for her husband, Leslie encourages her lawyer to purchase the letter that will surely damn her in the jury's eyes, knowing that this is a felonious offense and he can be disbarred should his involvement be discovered. Ever the pragmatist, Leslie is willing to save her own life at the expense of her lawyer's integrity and her husband's honor. There is one caveat to the sale: Leslie must accompany the attorney to Chinatown to face the woman in order to affect the exchange, terms Leslie accepts. Released to the care of the lawyer, Leslie arrives in Chinatown under the cover of night, passing through the crowded streets unnoticed. At the time of the exchange, the woman is imperious, demanding that Leslie approach to receive the letter, which she drops at the perfidious woman's feet, hatred seething in her eyes.Leslie is found not guilty but undone by her own refusal to deny the passion that caused the death of her lover. Unable to lie to her husband, who must be told of the money taken from his account, Leslie faces his hurt with equanimity, knowing he will forgive her any deed. Indeed, he is willing; it is Leslie who cannot deny her lover, who is still tormented by the rejection that brought about her crime of passion. Distraught, she wanders into the night garden of their estate, stepping just outside the gates, where she is confronted by the silent Eurasian woman and her companion. In the background, strains of music pierce the air, the celebration party in full swing. The Letter (1940) is a perfect vehicle for Davis, her dramatic flair never more evident than when in danger of exposure, manipulating those around her in the name of expedience. From the stark opening scene, Davis is the focus of attention and deservedly so. The film nominated for a number of Oscars, William Wyler showcases Davis' considerable talents in a drama of love and betrayal, as one woman's ungovernable passion taints not only her life but those around her, only to fall victim to her own demons, vintage Davis at her most magnificent, still powerful seventy years later.

Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis) had written the letter to the man demanding him to come over the day of his death. Now, with the help of a guilt ridden attorney (James Stephenson), she must retrieve the letter before it lands in the hands of the prosecutors. Directed by William Wyler, ""The Letter"" stands as one of Davis' most powerful films. Not only is she magnificent, but the film itself seethes with tension and sultry atmosphere. The plantation scenes are meticulously done with some shadows being painted on the ground (at Wyler's insistence) for more eerie moonlit shots. The moon plays a large role in ""The Letter"",  sort of as a governing body over the fates of certain characters.  A hint of Asian mysticism runs throughout as well implying that one cannot escape one's fate...especially if it involves retribution. Herbert Marshall (also with Davis in ""The Little Foxes"" again directed by Wyler) is excellent as the husband and plantation owner brought to ruin by ""the letter"". Warner's has done a fine job in presenting the film (based on W.Somerset Maugham's story) on DVD with good extras including an alternate ending that's more morbid. I couldn't decide which one I liked best. But it's Davis that you're watching here...constantly knitting to conceal her sexual frustration.

284451,A152C8GYY25HAH,6301973321,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","In some ways, ""The Letter"" has dated in the sixty plus years since it was released. The idea of the benefiting third world or non-Western countries by colonizing them has been replaced by the idea of globalizing them. Women are no longer viewed as being ultimately dependent on men. The old movie code that required all criminals to pay for their crimes is long gone. But while natural changes in social attitudes may make ""The Letter"" look somewhat quaint, it remains a classic. Much of the dramatic power remains intact, and it's extremely well directed, edited, photographed and directed. [Bette Davis made 3 films with director William Wyler and 11 with cinematographer Tony Guadio. All three were nominated for Oscars for this film.]Unlike most movie thrillers of its day, ""The Letter"" does not start quietly, then build to some shocking event. A few moments are spent establishing the fact that we are on a rubber plantation in Singapore. It is night. We see the full moon. The camera pans to native workers asleep in their hammocks. It moves on to the exterior of a house. Suddenly, a shot rings out. A man stumbles out onto the veranda and tumbles to the ground. He is followed by an obviously enraged woman, Leslie Crosbie [Davis], who pumps five more shots into him. The rest of the movie tells the story of how the killing came to be, how justice can be manipulated, and how people are often not what they appear to be.Here, Bette Davis gives one of her best performances. She was such a great actress that I suspect some of the reasons many people came to dislike her were that they could not separate the performer from some of the characters she played. She gives Leslie Crosbie a depth and range of emotions that does not exist in the screenplay. Herbert Marshall was the perfect choice to play her husband, a fumbling but sincere romantic who can only see the things he loves about his wife. As the Chinese wife of the man Leslie kills, Gale Sondergaard plays her as someone both Leslie and the audience should rightfully fear. She does this splendidly with virtually no dialog [none in English].Highly recommended.",5,Excellent Bette Davis vehicle,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,2131,"['ways', 'Letter', 'dated', 'sixty', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'idea', 'benefiting', 'third', 'world', 'non-Western', 'countries', 'colonizing', 'been', 'replaced', 'idea', 'globalizing', 'Women', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'viewed', 'being', 'ultimately', 'dependent', 'men', 'old', 'movie', 'code', 'required', 'criminals', 'pay', 'crimes', 'long', 'gone', 'natural', 'changes', 'social', 'attitudes', 'may', 'make', 'Letter', 'look', 'somewhat', 'quaint', 'classic', 'Much', 'dramatic', 'power', 'intact', 'extremely', 'well', 'directed', 'edited', 'photographed', 'directed', '[', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'made', '3', 'films', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', '11', 'cinematographer', 'Tony', 'Guadio', 'three', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'film', 'most', 'movie', 'thrillers', 'day', 'Letter', 'not', 'start', 'quietly', 'then', 'build', 'shocking', 'event', 'few', 'moments', 'are', 'spent', 'establishing', 'fact', 'are', 'rubber', 'plantation', 'Singapore', 'night', 'see', 'full', 'moon', 'camera', 'native', 'workers', 'asleep', 'hammocks', 'exterior', 'house', 'Suddenly', 'shot', 'out', 'man', 'out', 'veranda', 'tumbles', 'ground', 'followed', 'obviously', 'enraged', 'woman', 'Leslie', 'Crosbie', '[', 'Davis', ']', 'who', 'pumps', 'five', 'more', 'shots', 'rest', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'killing', 'came', 'be', 'how', 'justice', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'what', 'appear', 'be.Here', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'suspect', 'reasons', 'many', 'people', 'came', 'dislike', 'were', 'could', 'not', 'separate', 'performer', 'characters', 'played', 'Leslie', 'Crosbie', 'depth', 'range', 'emotions', 'not', 'exist', 'screenplay', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'husband', 'fumbling', 'sincere', 'romantic', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'things', 'wife', 'Chinese', 'wife', 'man', 'Leslie', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'someone', 'Leslie', 'audience', 'should', 'rightfully', 'fear', 'splendidly', 'virtually', 'dialog', 'none', 'English', ']', '.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
284452,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,6301973321,Mcgivern Owen L,"[1, 1]","""The Letter"" is set in pre-WW2 British Malaya.  In the opening scenes, Bette Davis kills a man and smartly, smoothly claims self-defense.  Why the demised, a family acquaintance, would ""make advances"" to BD is left unexplained.  BD appears in the clear; a family friend and connected attorney, James Stephenson, will defend her. The local Law shows no urge to investigate.  And then?  And then the plot thickens with a slight complication!  It seems BD had written the dead guy a love letter. They had had an affair. He was visiting to tell her he was marrying another woman. Davis' response was to off the poor guy! The plot thickens more when Stephenson, a highly principled barrister, receives a mysteriously Asian offer to ransom the letter. Clearly against his conscience, Stephenson buys and buries the lethal message.  The seller is not revealed here, but his/her identity thickens the suspense.  Davis is cleared at her murder trial but the viewer will realize that her problems are far from done. What happens? A good review will not reveal resolutions. The curious will just have to watch for themselves but will be happy they did.  ""The Letter"" is boosted by a wonderful musical score and sharp black and white photography- a vanished art.  Those shots of the lurking moon are positively eerie.  High honors go to Stephenson as the reluctant lawyer and Gale Sondergard as the wife of the deceased. Her contempt for Davis is so visceral it burns through the screen. This reviewer is not a big BD fan but she is perfectly cast here. Other reviewers have credited 7 Academy nominations to ""The Letter"" but Tom O'Neil's encyclopedic ""Movie Awards"" lists 4: Best Picture, Director (William Wyler), Actress (Davis) and Supporting Actor (Stephenson). None won a 1940 statuette. Winners were ""Rebecca"", John Ford for ""The Grapes of Wrath"", Ginger Rogers for ""Kitty Foyle"" and ""Walter Brennan for ""The Westerner"".  Bob Hope won a Special Award that year-they should have given one to that moon! ""The Letter"" is a classic, so smoothly done that the movie outshines the cast. In closing amazoners can be assured there are far more sub-plots, suspense, and mystery in ""The Letter"" than outlined here. The air of intrigue is maintained until the very fadeout. The sudden, slamming of the door resolution will remind viewers that ""The Letter"", for all its' other virtues, is also solid film noir in every detail. A final helpful hint: This viewer watched ""The Letter"" over 3 sittings. New viewers are urged to allocate the time to see it in one. Doing so will bring the full impact of those nocturnal scenes as the moon dances and the fates spin their web around the cast.",5,With That Hide and Seek Moon !,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,2669,"['Letter', 'set', 'pre-WW2', 'British', 'Malaya', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'man', 'smartly', 'smoothly', 'self-defense', 'Why', 'demised', 'family', 'acquaintance', 'would', 'make', 'advances', 'BD', 'left', 'unexplained', 'BD', 'clear', 'family', 'friend', 'connected', 'attorney', 'James', 'Stephenson', 'will', 'defend', 'local', 'Law', 'urge', 'investigate', 'then', 'then', 'plot', 'slight', 'complication', 'BD', 'had', 'written', 'dead', 'guy', 'love', 'letter', 'had', 'had', 'affair', 'was', 'visiting', 'tell', 'was', 'marrying', 'woman', 'Davis', 'response', 'was', 'poor', 'guy', 'plot', 'more', 'when', 'Stephenson', 'highly', 'principled', 'barrister', 'mysteriously', 'Asian', 'offer', 'ransom', 'letter', 'Clearly', 'conscience', 'Stephenson', 'lethal', 'message', 'seller', 'not', 'revealed', 'here', 'identity', 'suspense', 'Davis', 'cleared', 'murder', 'trial', 'viewer', 'will', 'realize', 'problems', 'are', 'far', 'done', 'What', 'good', 'review', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'resolutions', 'curious', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'did', 'Letter', 'boosted', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'score', 'sharp', 'black', 'white', 'photography-', 'vanished', 'art', 'shots', 'lurking', 'moon', 'are', 'positively', 'eerie', 'High', 'honors', 'go', 'Stephenson', 'reluctant', 'lawyer', 'Gale', 'Sondergard', 'wife', 'deceased', 'contempt', 'Davis', 'so', 'visceral', 'screen', 'reviewer', 'not', 'big', 'BD', 'fan', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'here', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'credited', '7', 'Academy', 'nominations', 'Letter', 'Tom', ""O'Neil"", 'encyclopedic', 'Movie', 'Awards', '4', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Actress', 'Davis', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Stephenson', 'None', 'won', '1940', 'statuette', 'Winners', 'were', 'Rebecca', 'John', 'Ford', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Kitty', 'Foyle', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Westerner', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'won', 'Special', 'Award', 'year-they', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'one', 'moon', 'Letter', 'classic', 'so', 'smoothly', 'done', 'movie', 'cast', 'closing', 'amazoners', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'sub-plots', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'Letter', 'outlined', 'here', 'air', 'intrigue', 'maintained', 'very', 'fadeout', 'sudden', 'slamming', 'door', 'resolution', 'will', 'remind', 'viewers', 'Letter', 'other', 'virtues', 'also', 'solid', 'film', 'noir', 'detail', 'final', 'helpful', 'hint', 'viewer', 'watched', 'Letter', '3', 'sittings', 'New', 'viewers', 'are', 'urged', 'allocate', 'time', 'see', 'one', 'Doing', 'so', 'will', 'bring', 'full', 'impact', 'nocturnal', 'scenes', 'moon', 'dances', 'fates', 'spin', 'web', 'cast']",N/A

James Stephenson, as Davis's lawyer,  earned an Oscar Nomination for his understated performance, and Herbert  Marshall plays her unwitting husband.  Gale Sondergaard also vamps it up as  the vengeful Oriental wife of the man Davis has killed (she doesn't speak  much, but MAN, is she intimidating).  Davis, as usual, upstages everybody  without even trying, and she earned her fourth academy award nomination for  this performance (she lost to Ginger Rogers for &quot;Kitty Foyle,&quot; a  movie not even worthy to be compared to this one), and the film scored 6  other nominations including Best Picture.  For an older Hollywood film, I  find it fascinating to examine some of the psychological elements at play  throughout - an example being Davis's knitting, a sign both of sexual  frustration and of deceit in literature (both appropriate to the fallen  woman type she plays).

284458,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6301973321,Nix Pix,"[0, 0]","Once you've seen the opening moments of William Wyler's superb ""The Letter"" you aren't apt to forget what great Hollywood film making is all about for a very, VERY long time. Bette Davis stars in this potent, diabolically delicious melodrama as Leslie Crosbie; the unscrupulous wife of a Malaysian rubber plantation owner. After packing six slugs into a man exiting her boudoir...not her husband...Leslie embarks on a deeply disturbing odyssey to vindicate her murder. To this end, Leslie is ably aided by the naivet&eacute; of her husband, Robert (Herbert Marshall) and by her popular following of fair weather friends, helmed by Mrs. Hammond (Gale Sondergaard).The play by Somerset Maugham on which the film is based must have seemed like old hat to Davis. For there can be no other reason why she's so cleverly fiendish and stylishly sinister as Leslie. But then all is not to be realized in sweet escapism when a letter surfaces that could blow the whole truth wide open and send Leslie to prison for life. Superbly crafted with the fine animal instincts of a jungle cat at every turn, ""The Letter"" was nominated for seven Oscars, including best picture but won not a single statuette. Wyler's impeccable direction, and Davis's mesmerizing and unsympathetic performance are what transform this standard melodrama into movie art!Unfortunately all is not well with the transfer from Warner Brothers. Seemingly contrasting a bit on the overly dark side, fine details are generally lost in the deep and foreboding blackness. Yes, most of the picture was designed to have a very dark image, but contrast and tonality in the gray scale here are what seem to be lacking over all throughout this black and white image. Also, the image is not very stable. Long shots tend to be a bit blurry and out of focus. There's also an annoying amount of edge enhancement on the horizontal slats of the bamboo blinds that figure into the mood of the piece throughout the film - making certain scenes seem unnecessarily harshly contrasted. Age related artifacts crop up now and then. Film grain becomes obtrusive and dense at moments, and practically non-existent at other moments. The audio is mono and overall nicely balanced.

Bette Davis stars in this potent, diabolically delicious melodrama as Leslie Crosbie; the unscrupulous wife of a Malaysian rubber plantation owner. After packing six slugs into a man exiting her boudoir...not her husband...Leslie embarks on a deeply disturbing odyssey to vindicate her murder. Hmmm....vengeful Eurasian, Mrs. Hammond (Gale Sondergaard)will have something to say about that. To this morbid end of tragic curiosity, Leslie is ably aided by the naivet&eacute; of her husband, Robert(Herbert Marshall). But then there's the letter; a bit of forgotten business that threatens to unravel all of Leslie's well laid plans and lay bare her genuine passion for the man that she's killed.The play by Somerset Maugham on which the film is based must have seemed like old hat to Davis. For there can be no other reason why she's so cleverly fiendish and stylishly sinister as Leslie. But then all is not to be realized in sweet escapism when a letter surfaces that could blow the whole truth wide open and send Leslie to prison for life. Superbly crafted with the fine animal instincts of a jungle cat at every turn, &quot;The Letter&quot; was nominated for seven Oscars, including best picture but won not a single statuette. Wyler's impeccable direction, and Davis's mesmerizing and unsympathetic performance are what transform this standard melodrama into movie art!Unfortunately all is not well with the transfer from Warner Brothers. Yes, most of the picture was designed to have a very dark image, but contrast and tonality in the gray scale here are what seem to be lacking throughout this black and white presentation.Long shots tend to be a bit blurry. There's also some edge enhancement on the horizontal slats of the bamboo blinds that figure into the mood of the piece throughout the film - making certain scenes seem unnecessarily harsh. Age related artifacts crop up now and then. Film grain becomes obtrusive in spots. The audio is mono and overall nicely balanced. Occasionally dialogue is somewhat muffled. Extras include a fascinating alternative ending only recently discovered as well as 2 audio bonuses and the film's original theatrical trailer. &quot;The Letter&quot; comes highly recommended as a melodrama par excellence from a studio, director and a star who definitely understood the subtly of the art.",4,"Moody, Taut and Sultry: Bette Davis Scores Big",1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,2518,"['Once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'opening', 'moments', 'William', 'Wyler', 'superb', 'quot', 'Letter', 'quot', 'are', ""n't"", 'apt', 'forget', 'what', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'making', 'very', 'VERY', 'long', 'time', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'potent', 'diabolically', 'delicious', 'melodrama', 'Leslie', 'Crosbie', 'unscrupulous', 'wife', 'Malaysian', 'rubber', 'plantation', 'owner', 'packing', 'six', 'slugs', 'man', 'exiting', 'boudoir', 'not', 'husband', 'Leslie', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'odyssey', 'vindicate', 'murder', 'Hmmm', '.vengeful', 'Eurasian', 'Mrs.', 'Hammond', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'will', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'morbid', 'end', 'tragic', 'curiosity', 'Leslie', 'ably', 'aided', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'then', 'letter', 'bit', 'forgotten', 'business', 'unravel', 'Leslie', 'well', 'laid', 'plans', 'lay', 'bare', 'genuine', 'passion', 'man', 'killed.The', 'play', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'film', 'based', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'old', 'hat', 'Davis', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'cleverly', 'fiendish', 'stylishly', 'sinister', 'Leslie', 'then', 'not', 'be', 'realized', 'sweet', 'escapism', 'when', 'letter', 'could', 'blow', 'whole', 'truth', 'wide', 'open', 'send', 'Leslie', 'prison', 'life', 'Superbly', 'crafted', 'fine', 'animal', 'instincts', 'jungle', 'cat', 'turn', 'quot', 'Letter', 'quot', 'was', 'nominated', 'seven', 'Oscars', 'including', 'best', 'picture', 'won', 'not', 'single', 'statuette', 'Wyler', 'impeccable', 'direction', 'Davis', 'mesmerizing', 'unsympathetic', 'performance', 'are', 'what', 'standard', 'melodrama', 'movie', 'art', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'well', 'transfer', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Yes', 'most', 'picture', 'was', 'designed', 'have', 'very', 'dark', 'image', 'contrast', 'tonality', 'gray', 'scale', 'here', 'are', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'lacking', 'black', 'white', 'presentation.Long', 'shots', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'blurry', 'also', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'horizontal', 'slats', 'bamboo', 'figure', 'mood', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'certain', 'scenes', 'seem', 'unnecessarily', 'harsh', 'Age', 'related', 'artifacts', 'crop', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'Film', 'grain', 'becomes', 'obtrusive', 'spots', 'audio', 'mono', 'overall', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'Occasionally', 'dialogue', 'somewhat', 'muffled', 'Extras', 'include', 'fascinating', 'alternative', 'ending', 'only', 'recently', 'discovered', 'as', 'well', '2', 'audio', 'bonuses', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'quot', 'Letter', 'quot', 'highly', 'recommended', 'melodrama', 'par', 'excellence', 'studio', 'director', 'star', 'who', 'definitely', 'understood', 'subtly', 'art']",N/A

Hers (and Garbo's) are the names one mentions first when great acting is discussed. The 30's and early 40's are Bette Davis' golden era. Her method of acting is of the highest order that even today, with the exception of Meryl Streep, her performances are considered the best ever captured on screen. The intensity of her acting could burn her at the stake.This film always makes it to the top films of the century. It is Davis' film all the way, from the moment she made her grand entrance shooting Newell ,down to her  pulsating eyes revealing  pent-up frustration and anger as a lover who was burned. Davis' performance is simply superb, a must-see for those who want to analyse the craft of professional acting. Davis is the consummate actress.Even her English accent is flawless (something she has mastered/mustered on ""On Human Bondage""). This film is almost 70 years old but doesn't date a bit. It is marvelously directed with a breathneck pace, but ultimately satisfying.Key scenes for Davis fans and non-fans alike; Lesley fainting when the letter was read to her by her lawyer, dropping to her knees to the Eurasian widow ...and lastly, her immortal lines she uttered to her husband: ""with all my heart I still love the man I killed!.""

284462,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,6301973321,Phillip Oliver,"[77, 77]","This is an excellent adaptation of Somerset Maugham's play about the wife of a Malaysian plantation owner who kills her lover and claims it was self defense. However, there exists an incriminating letter...The role of Leslie Crosbie was previously performed on stage by Katherine Cornell and Gladys Cooper and filmed in 1929 with Jeanne Eagles. Davis gives one of her greatest performances in a carefully nuanced orchestration of pent-up sexual frustration. Equally good is Herbert Marshall as her suffering husband and James Stephenson as the lawyer who reluctantly defends her. Tragically, Stephenson would die of a heart attack the following year at the age of 52. Both Stephenson and Davis would receive Oscar nominations for their work here.Another unforgettable performance comes from Gale Sondergaard who plays the Eurasian wife of the victim and possessor of the incriminating document. Her chalky face and garish jewelry will give you up the creeps as will the looks of death she gives to Davis. She has very few lines (and they are in Mandarin) but what an entrance she makes! The confrontation scene between Davis and Sondergaard, eerily played with no music aside from wind chimes, has to be one of most tense and memorable scenes ever filmed. Speaking of music, the score by Max Steiner is one of his best.Other great elements of ""The Letter"" are the atmospheric photography and sets which perfectelly set the mood of the hot and humid nights on a rubber plantation and the ever present full moon, appearing and disappearing behind clouds and casting shadows (and an accusing glance) on the face of the guilty heroine.The dvd looks great (on a 36"" tv at least) with the wonderful black and white photography sharpy rendered and no notices of nicks or scratches. An alternate ending is featured which basically excerpts a scene in which Davis tells Marshall that she still loves the man she killed. Davis did not want the scene included because she felt that her character could not be so callous to her husband! Director William Wyler wisely included it! Two radio versions (in 1941 and 1944) are also included with both Davis and Marshall reprising their roles.

When we finally get a close-up, I realize the year the movie was probably made. My mother wore that exact hairstyle in the years 39-41, as is evidenced by many family photographs.  I am in love with the exotic cinematography of this film. Again there are blades of light coming through louvres and casting upon faces and mysterious forms. I am also delighted by the tinkling of wind chimes and the moody soundtrack, sometimes big band-y and sometimes oriental in theme. Our ""totally innocent Bette"" has surprises laying beneath the surface and she releases these gradually, dramatically and beautifully. ""What charge would that be?"" She asks her attorney casually. He drops the bomb: ""Murder."" It would have all turned out okay if she had not found it necessary to empty the entire gun. That would tend to raise some questions about self-defense vs. anger and jealosy as a motive.  The answer to all the puzzles is in ""the letter."" Gale Sondergaard is perfect as the wronged woman. Even though she is the wronged one, she personifies evil so well onscreen. What other gems has she done this in? (I believe Homicidal was one but there are many more) As sad as it is, and as desperate as she is for revenge, she has the where-with-all to get the money, too. She sees to it that Miss Priss will not interfere in another marriage. There have been many adaptations of Wm. Somerset Maugham's great story, ""The Letter,"" but this is probably the best.

When the letter is purchased from the victim's wife and kept out of the trial, things do not improve for Davis and her husband Herbert Marshall.This entangling drama was nominated for seven Academy Awards including best Picture and Best Actress.

It was not one of his best works, but like all his writings, it had the solid craftmanship that makes for good theatre. In it, Katherine Cornell gave a memorable performance of the cool-witted wife of a rubber plantation manager who, obsessed with passion, kills her lover, concocts an audacious defence, finds herself inextricably tangled in her own web of lies. In 1929, Paramount made a movie of THE LETTER with Herbert Marshall in a small role and the near-legendary Jeanne Eagels in the lead. Eagels acted intensely in the role, and the film was noteworthy despite the limitations of the early talking picture. Although its talk seems sometimes stilted and its plot a trifle too contrived, Warners rivived the basically engrossing and powerful tale in 1940, and it was considered one of the years' best films. As Leslie Crosbie, Davis gives a fascinating performance which critic Pauline Kael branded as ""very likely the best example of female sexual hypocrisy on film"". This filmization of the famed novel by W. Somerset Maugham is given sterling treatment by a stellar cast and expertly detailed direction by William Wyler, whose hand is patent throughout. As Leslie Crosbie, Davis is cool and calculating while James Stephenson is splendid as Horward Joyce. The great Gale Sondergaard is most effective as the vengeful Eurasian Mrs. Hammond, and her performance was taken quite seriously by the movie-going public in 1940. Legend has it that Davis secretly idolised the legendary twenties stage actress Jeanne Eagels and repeatedly watched her 1929 early talkie version of  THE LETTER - which she managed to have privately screened - today, many believe Davis's version of Leslie Crosbie to be one of her finest performances.",5,BRILLIANT ACTING,958694400,"05 19, 2000",2000,1842,"['1928', 'when', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'was', 'already', 'world', 'literary', 'figure', 'play', 'THE', 'LETTER', 'opened', 'Broadway', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'works', 'writings', 'had', 'solid', 'craftmanship', 'good', 'theatre', 'Katherine', 'Cornell', 'gave', 'memorable', 'performance', 'cool-witted', 'wife', 'rubber', 'plantation', 'manager', 'who', 'obsessed', 'passion', 'lover', 'audacious', 'defence', 'inextricably', 'tangled', 'own', 'web', 'lies', '1929', 'Paramount', 'made', 'movie', 'THE', 'LETTER', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'small', 'role', 'near-legendary', 'Jeanne', 'Eagels', 'lead', 'Eagels', 'acted', 'intensely', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'noteworthy', 'limitations', 'early', 'talking', 'picture', 'talk', 'sometimes', 'stilted', 'plot', 'trifle', 'too', 'contrived', 'Warners', 'rivived', 'basically', 'engrossing', 'powerful', 'tale', '1940', 'was', 'considered', 'one', 'years', 'best', 'films', 'Leslie', 'Crosbie', 'Davis', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'critic', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'branded', 'very', 'likely', 'best', 'example', 'female', 'sexual', 'hypocrisy', 'film', 'filmization', 'famed', 'novel', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'given', 'sterling', 'treatment', 'stellar', 'cast', 'expertly', 'detailed', 'direction', 'William', 'Wyler', 'hand', 'patent', 'Leslie', 'Crosbie', 'Davis', 'cool', 'calculating', 'James', 'Stephenson', 'splendid', 'Horward', 'Joyce', 'great', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'most', 'effective', 'vengeful', 'Eurasian', 'Mrs.', 'Hammond', 'performance', 'was', 'taken', 'quite', 'seriously', 'movie-going', 'public', '1940', 'Legend', 'Davis', 'secretly', 'idolised', 'legendary', 'twenties', 'stage', 'actress', 'Jeanne', 'Eagels', 'repeatedly', 'watched', '1929', 'early', 'talkie', 'version', 'THE', 'LETTER', 'managed', 'have', 'privately', 'screened', 'today', 'many', 'believe', 'Davis', 'version', 'Leslie', 'Crosbie', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'performances']",N/A

Made in 1940, the movie shows attitudes that have changed greatly in western society since that picture was made - the contempt people have for Gayle Sondergaard's character is a question in point - anAsian woman who marries an Englishman, was something that was too too terrible to be countenanced ! (Especially when the man involved prefers Sondergaard to Davis)The moon and fabulous sunsets were used to great effect during the picture, as in the opening scene where Bette Davis is seen chasing a male figure down a flight of steps, firing her gun into his back as she does so.She sends a servant to get her husband from his plantation, and tells him that the man she shot was an intruder who tried to rape her. Of course her story is believed without question - the wife of a plantation owner is not without status among the British comminity in Malaya.All goes well until a letter purporting to be a love letter from Davis to her ex-lover,pleading with him to come and see her at the house - her husband will be away etc really sets the cat amongst the pigeons.Family friend and well regarded solicitor (played magnificently by Howard Joyce) is appalled at his clients duplicity and they go through a sham of a court case where by any mention of the letter is with held - to ensure Davis doesn't face a death penality.Gayle Sondergaard is the vengeful wife who makes Davis and her solicitor come to the seedy China town area so she and Davis can meet face to face. Unbeknowns to Herbert Marshall, who plays the decent trusting husband (as he did so memorably with Davis in The Little Foxes) the money used to buy back the letter was $10,000 - all he had in the bank.The meeting of the two women with Davis wearing a beautiful white lace shawl, and Sondergaard in a Chinese outfit, clinging as it does to show all her curves was well directed acted and photographed.The two Chinese present enjoy watching Davis forced to ask for the letter and hand over the money. It is a scene that crackles with irony, hatred, and a sense of justice having been done.Davis is - as she was in Jezebel,another Wyler picture - perfect in the Letter,selfish,self centred, mannered, under playing her character perfectly as a  a woman who commits adultery, murder, and lies to those who trusted her, leaving in her wake a husband hearbroken and in debt, their close friend and lawyer in grave danger of being disbarred from practising the law, and her lover murdered in a deliberate act of cold blood.The fascination I felt in watching The Letter was seeing Miss Davis' character gradually being trapped - like a fly to a spider's web.She gets her come uppance of course, but I almost felt sorry for her just the same.Gayle Sondergaard was an actress who was targetted by the house of Un-American activites, and her career was effectively halted. It was good to see her playing such an effective role.The Letter is dated in its mannerisms and views, but it is still very much worth the having, the watching and the owning of.",5,Bette Davis At Her Best,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,3163,"['reason', 'films', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'made', 'guiding', 'hand', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'represent', 'best', 'work', 'Letter', 'exception', 'Made', '1940', 'movie', 'attitudes', 'have', 'changed', 'greatly', 'western', 'society', 'picture', 'was', 'made', 'contempt', 'people', 'have', 'Gayle', 'Sondergaard', 'character', 'question', 'point', 'anAsian', 'woman', 'who', 'Englishman', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'too', 'too', 'terrible', 'be', 'countenanced', 'Especially', 'when', 'man', 'involved', 'prefers', 'Sondergaard', 'Davis', 'moon', 'fabulous', 'sunsets', 'were', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'picture', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'seen', 'chasing', 'male', 'figure', 'down', 'flight', 'steps', 'firing', 'gun', 'back', 'so.She', 'servant', 'get', 'husband', 'plantation', 'man', 'shot', 'was', 'intruder', 'who', 'tried', 'rape', 'course', 'story', 'believed', 'question', 'wife', 'plantation', 'owner', 'not', 'status', 'British', 'comminity', 'Malaya.All', 'well', 'letter', 'purporting', 'be', 'love', 'letter', 'Davis', 'ex-lover', 'pleading', 'come', 'see', 'house', 'husband', 'will', 'be', 'away', 'etc', 'really', 'cat', 'pigeons.Family', 'friend', 'well', 'regarded', 'solicitor', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Howard', 'Joyce', 'appalled', 'clients', 'duplicity', 'go', 'sham', 'court', 'case', 'where', 'mention', 'letter', 'held', 'ensure', 'Davis', ""n't"", 'face', 'death', 'penality.Gayle', 'Sondergaard', 'vengeful', 'wife', 'who', 'Davis', 'solicitor', 'come', 'seedy', 'China', 'town', 'area', 'Davis', 'can', 'meet', 'face', 'face', 'Unbeknowns', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'who', 'decent', 'trusting', 'husband', 'did', 'so', 'memorably', 'Davis', 'Little', 'Foxes', 'money', 'used', 'buy', 'back', 'letter', 'was', '10,000', 'all', 'had', 'bank.The', 'meeting', 'two', 'women', 'Davis', 'wearing', 'beautiful', 'white', 'lace', 'shawl', 'Sondergaard', 'Chinese', 'outfit', 'clinging', 'show', 'curves', 'was', 'well', 'directed', 'acted', 'photographed.The', 'two', 'Chinese', 'present', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Davis', 'forced', 'ask', 'letter', 'hand', 'money', 'scene', 'irony', 'hatred', 'sense', 'justice', 'having', 'been', 'done.Davis', 'was', 'Jezebel', 'Wyler', 'picture', 'perfect', 'Letter', 'selfish', 'self', 'centred', 'mannered', 'playing', 'character', 'perfectly', 'woman', 'who', 'adultery', 'murder', 'who', 'trusted', 'leaving', 'wake', 'husband', 'hearbroken', 'debt', 'close', 'friend', 'lawyer', 'grave', 'danger', 'being', 'disbarred', 'practising', 'law', 'lover', 'murdered', 'deliberate', 'act', 'cold', 'blood.The', 'fascination', 'felt', 'watching', 'Letter', 'was', 'seeing', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'character', 'gradually', 'being', 'trapped', 'fly', 'spider', 'web.She', 'come', 'uppance', 'course', 'almost', 'felt', 'sorry', 'just', 'same.Gayle', 'Sondergaard', 'was', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'targetted', 'house', 'Un-American', 'activites', 'career', 'was', 'effectively', 'halted', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'playing', 'such', 'effective', 'role.The', 'Letter', 'dated', 'mannerisms', 'views', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'having', 'watching', 'owning']",N/A

Bette Davis is truly marvelous as the cold, calculating, scheming wife of a more or less milquetoast husband, well played by Herbert Marshall. I also agree that James Stephenson was very underrated as an actor, and he competently portrayed the honest, incorruptible lawyer who later becomes somewhat self-loathing (after he allowed himself to be guilted into tampering with the state's case by burying evidence in the form of an incriminating letter which would surely have put Leslie Crosbie away for a long time). In fact, it is to this very letter that I allude when I refer to an obvious plot hole in the story.It is apparent that Howard Joyce is not only an honest defense lawyer (talk about a dead breed!), but is also a very smart one, however after the trial, when he and Leslie are talking alone, she asks him at one point where the letter is. He tells her it's in his pocket. Wait a minute.. time out! You mean to tell me that this brilliant attorney, after buying back the letter from the murdered man's widow for $10,000, thus suppressing vital evidence, not to mention seriously jeopardizing his career, is STUPID enough to actually KEEP the damn thing?? Wouldn't it have served his client's best interests, not to mention save himself from disbarment, to have burned it? What would have happened if, during the trial, the widow had decided to double-cross the defense and tell the court about the letter? As long as it still existed, there was a chance it would be discovered and used against Leslie. If Joyce had simply burned it, even the best attempts of the widow to expose the defense's treachery would have been in vain.Then later, when Leslie's hubby began getting suspicious about the actual contents of the letter (which he had been told was fairly innocuous), this idiot of a lawyer, whom we have been led to believe is willing to spare his friend's feelings at all costs, SHOWS HIM THE DAMNED THING! If you were truly a great friend to someone, and you had a letter in your pocket that you knew would cause grave damage to him, wouldn't you tell the guy that the letter had been burned, or some such thing? No! This genius shows his friend the letter, which ultimately destroyed him! I couldn't believe it!Anyway, those very obvious deviations in character aside, I thought the movie was very entertaining and went by very quickly for me, although I also thought the ending a bit contrived and unsatisfactory.
