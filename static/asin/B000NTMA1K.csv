1060317,AIZO3C0MDZ88A,B000NTMA1K,A. Alger,"[4, 4]","I have to disagree with some other reviewers who think this movie is to gruesome or mature for preschoolers.  Me and my daughter have watched this movie several times over the past 3 years and love the movie.  It teaches that no matter how impossible a task as long as you work together and don't give up you can accomplish anything. Just like people shield their children from bambi cause his mom dies.  Thats your choice.  But to bash a movie because it's more of a serious story than your child can handle doesn't mean other children can't handle it.  It's a great story, a great theme and a great moral lesson of never giving up.  I for one think calling the movie gruesome due to a fire or grandma getting sick is a little overkill.",5,One of the best Franklin Movies.,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,737,"['have', 'disagree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'think', 'movie', 'gruesome', 'mature', 'preschoolers', 'Me', 'daughter', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'past', '3', 'years', 'love', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'impossible', 'task', 'as', 'long', 'work', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'can', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'Just', 'people', 'shield', 'children', 'bambi', 'cause', 'mom', 'dies', 'Thats', 'choice', 'bash', 'movie', 'more', 'serious', 'story', 'child', 'can', 'handle', ""n't"", 'mean', 'other', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'theme', 'great', 'moral', 'lesson', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'one', 'think', 'calling', 'movie', 'gruesome', 'due', 'fire', 'grandma', 'getting', 'sick', 'little', 'overkill']",Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure

We have done a lot of talking about her being gone...when she brings it up to me. It is a shame that other parents cannot use this film as a teaching moment...maybe they have a hard time with death. I understand that it was unexpected from a Franklin show, but use these moment to teach not run away from life's uncertainty. Teach them that life is precious!",5,Excellent and well done!

Only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because there is a scene that includes fire and the loss of life which I fast forward because my kids are sensitive and don't like to see it.,4,Another hit with the family,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,250,"['Once', 'again', 'Franklin', 'adventure', 'friends', 'teaching', 'life', 'lessons', 'Only', 'gave', '4', '5', 'stars', 'scene', 'fire', 'loss', 'life', 'fast', 'forward', 'kids', 'are', 'sensitive', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'see']",Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure
