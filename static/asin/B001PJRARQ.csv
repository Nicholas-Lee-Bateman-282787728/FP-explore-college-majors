What a wonderful example of the partnership between mushers and their dogs. Those dogs love to run and their human partners care as lovingly for them as they would their own children. They are truly a team. The drama of such a grueling race is intoxicating to watch. The rivalry of world class mushers Lance Mackey and Jeff King will pull you in. You will cheer for DeeDee Jonrowe, a breast cancer survivor with an iron will and a passion for the Iditarod. The father/son relationship between Martin Buser and his youngest son Rohn as he races his first Iditarod is heartwarming. This is exceptional television. Truly. I wish that Discovery would film the Iditarod every year. Sadly the race does not get the international Sports world media attention it deserves. Since first seeing this series it has become an annual thing for me to watch the series before Iditarod madness begins in March!! Almost all of the featured mushers in this series are already on the roster for Iditarod 2013. Watch it.

1227006,A1UMSB7LAW0RIR,B001PJRARQ,"mom2twoboys ""Writer, Reader & Mage""","[5, 5]","The only bad thing about this is that it's short. I wish it had been ten episodes!My husband and I watched this together, spread out over three nights. When we watched the first episode we both thought, ""Huh, oddly interesting, I guess we should continue?"" so we did.  Well, then we each picked our favorite musher and it got way more interesting. I tell you, if you love racing, you are going to looooove this. Actually, I don't watch racing, but this has the same draws. You learn the background of each racer. You learn a bit about their dogs, the way they train, the food they give them and why.  You get to hear about the mental toll this race takes on them and what they do to come in ahead of the others.It's exciting, it's real, it's got dogs, Alaska and competition in snow! With sleds! What else could you want??!The series starts right off, not much prep, but the preparations are gone into throughout the series.  The racers experience weather issues, dog injuries, dumping their sleds on this crazy turn/drop. The only thing missing is I'd like even more background about the racers, their families, and to see more issues, like the mental toll and the financial costs etc.  I'm surprised the winner only gets $69k and a truck..and a buckle. These folks really put their whole lives into their dogs and the Iditarod. To be sure, it really is the toughest race on earth.I'd recommend this for any age. There is no s*x or violence. Everyone loves their dogs, so no issues there. It might even make your kids love their dogs even more! There is a little cursing, but overall I think this would be a super fun series for the whole family to watch together!!",5,"Entertaining, educational, even addictive!",1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,1666,"['only', 'bad', 'thing', 'short', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'ten', 'husband', 'watched', 'together', 'spread', 'out', 'three', 'nights', 'When', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'thought', 'Huh', 'oddly', 'interesting', 'guess', 'should', 'continue', 'did', 'Well', 'then', 'picked', 'favorite', 'musher', 'got', 'way', 'more', 'interesting', 'tell', 'love', 'racing', 'are', 'going', 'looooove', 'Actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'racing', 'same', 'draws', 'learn', 'background', 'racer', 'learn', 'bit', 'dogs', 'way', 'train', 'food', 'give', 'why', 'get', 'hear', 'mental', 'toll', 'race', 'what', 'do', 'come', 'ahead', 'others.It', 'exciting', 'real', 'got', 'dogs', 'Alaska', 'competition', 'snow', 'sleds', 'What', 'else', 'could', 'want', 'series', 'right', 'off', 'not', 'much', 'prep', 'preparations', 'are', 'gone', 'series', 'racers', 'experience', 'weather', 'issues', 'dog', 'injuries', 'dumping', 'sleds', 'crazy', 'turn/drop', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', ""'d"", 'like', 'even', 'more', 'background', 'racers', 'families', 'see', 'more', 'issues', 'mental', 'toll', 'financial', 'costs', 'etc', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'winner', 'only', '69k', 'truck..and', 'buckle', 'folks', 'really', 'put', 'whole', 'lives', 'dogs', 'Iditarod', 'be', 'sure', 'really', 'toughest', 'race', 'earth.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'age', 's*x', 'violence', 'Everyone', 'dogs', 'issues', 'there', 'might', 'even', 'make', 'kids', 'love', 'dogs', 'even', 'more', 'little', 'cursing', 'overall', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'super', 'fun', 'series', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'together']",Iditarod: Toughest Race on Earth

1227009,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B001PJRARQ,Scott FS,"[1, 2]","I've had a passing interest in the race after reading about how it got started.  I was perusing material and chanced upon this, so I ordered it.I asked my wife if she wanted to watch it with me, she said it sounded boring, so she passed.  I started watching it, and lo and behold, my wife walked by, and sat on the floor just to watch a few minutes.  She got hooked, and we watched the whole thing together.This is a big production.  The filmmakers use night-vision, sled cams, dog cams, and helmet cams.  They also use helicopters, trucks, and other dog teams to get the shots they want.2008 was marked by a very close race, and the contest wasn't decided until the last hours of the race.  The tension throughout was palpable.  There are many interviews, stories about the dogs, and examinations of snow, equipment, food, and tactics.This is a very enjoyable program that will hold your interest throughout.  I wish they had examined more of these races; I enjoyed it enough to want to see more.
