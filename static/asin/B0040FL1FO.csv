1379167,A31P7QU36HM93H,B0040FL1FO,happy singer,"[2, 3]",I was a little disappointed in the harmony of the group on this DVD.  I enjoy Ernie Haase and Signature Sound very much.  Their music always lifts my spirits.  With Ryan Seaton leaving the group the close harmony was just not there.  You could hear individual voices which made it seem like they were trying to out sing each other.  I enjoy their music very much but miss the close harmony that is on their earlier DVD's,3,Tribute to the Cathedral Quartet,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,420,"['was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'harmony', 'group', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'Ernie', 'Haase', 'Signature', 'Sound', 'very', 'much', 'music', 'always', 'lifts', 'spirits', 'Ryan', 'Seaton', 'leaving', 'group', 'close', 'harmony', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'could', 'hear', 'individual', 'voices', 'made', 'seem', 'were', 'trying', 'sing', 'other', 'enjoy', 'music', 'very', 'much', 'miss', 'close', 'harmony', 'earlier', 'DVD']",N/A

The production quality of both the performance and the DVD is fantastic and it is a very fitting tribute to the Cathedrals with whom Ernie performed before they disbanded. I would sum it up by saying that it is a tribute to a great quartet by a great quartet. The baton has been passed. This is the 1st DVD that has the new member Devin McGlamery (who replaced Ryan Seaton). A different voice, and a wonderful addition. If you like good gospel music, then you won't be disappointed by this DVD.Having seen Ernie Haase's concerts and having seen their most recent which features much of the music on this DVD, I would say that this is a fantastic memento of his concert experience.You can tell that for these performers (and crew) that this is a labor of love and they are first and foremost ministers who use music to spread the message. That they are also very entertaining is a nice plus.  If you get a chance to see these gentlemen in person while on tour, do so.  You would be in for a spirit filled evening.  You can't help but feel better after one of their concerts.This is one of the best that the Gaither Series of videos has to offer (and that is saying quite a lot).",5,excellent performance,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,1310,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'Ernie', 'Haase', 'Signature', 'Sound', 'great', 'DVD', 'would', 'rate', 'as', 'good', 'Together', 'DVD', 'was', 'production', 'quality', 'performance', 'DVD', 'fantastic', 'very', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'Cathedrals', 'whom', 'Ernie', 'performed', 'disbanded', 'would', 'sum', 'up', 'saying', 'tribute', 'great', 'quartet', 'great', 'quartet', 'baton', 'been', 'passed', '1st', 'DVD', 'new', 'member', 'Devin', 'McGlamery', 'who', 'replaced', 'Ryan', 'Seaton', 'different', 'voice', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'like', 'good', 'gospel', 'music', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD.Having', 'seen', 'Ernie', 'Haase', 'concerts', 'having', 'seen', 'most', 'recent', 'much', 'music', 'DVD', 'would', 'say', 'fantastic', 'memento', 'concert', 'experience.You', 'can', 'tell', 'performers', 'crew', 'labor', 'love', 'are', 'first', 'foremost', 'ministers', 'who', 'use', 'music', 'spread', 'message', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'entertaining', 'nice', 'plus', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'gentlemen', 'person', 'tour', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'spirit', 'filled', 'evening', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'better', 'one', 'concerts.This', 'one', 'best', 'Gaither', 'Series', 'videos', 'offer', 'saying', 'quite', 'lot']",N/A

I was dubious about the new guy, but he holds his own, and is a delightful addition to the group, (even though I still morn the loss of Ryan Seaton; hope he comes back). I did attend a concert -after having purchased the DVD, and had the privilege of meeting Devin. He is precious, just so down to earth and heavenly bound.  I really enjoyed meeting the whole experience. There is now a new bass singer, good singer, and I missed Tim. I want them all to stay!![FYI: Doug sung a solo at the concert,and it was really good. I wish it was on this recording.]There are some really touching moments on this DVD, and also some humorous ones.

I wondered if Signature Sound would give a true tribute to the Cathedrals in the style of the Cathedrals or in the style that they have perfected.  To my delight Ernie Haase & Signature Sound dressed in suit & ties gave a Tribute to Glan Payne & George Younce that would have made them proud.The songs (listed on this page) were sung in the Cathedral style with just a few differences to make it Signature's own.  A highlight was Squire Parsons joining the group to sing Beulah Land.Ernie Haase showed the range of his tenor voice on some of the songs such as ""Oh What a Savior.  Glen Payne & George Younce showed up.  I saw Glen's wife in the audience with tears in her eyes.This is almost a 2 hour dvd and was 2 years in the making.  I understand it is No. 1 on all the charts including Billboard as the time of this writing.  It should be.
