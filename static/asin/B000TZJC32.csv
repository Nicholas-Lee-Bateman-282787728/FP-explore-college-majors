1092983,A3E3VGOWHL4OPR,B000TZJC32,Chris L,"[4, 4]","The Tales from the Cryptkeeper was a Saturday morning cartoon, yes you read that right. The stories were great and sometimes scary. I was always excited to watch this show every saturday morning when it came out. The stories range from scary haunted houses to mummys chasing after you. Any kid who has had the pleasure of growing up in a household with parents who have taught them to watch scary movies at a young age, will surely enjoy this one. This is a show that helped bring in a new breed of television shows.This show helped inspire the creation of the HBO show, ""Tales from the Crypt."" A show that for anyone who loves a good terror now and then will enjoy. This show combined the effects of cartoon and horror at just the right pace. I always wanted more terror and gore but since it was a kids show, I had to make due. Other than that it has been great to watch it again and relive the memories of waking up early to watch great saturday morning programming.For any great parent who enjoys teaching their kids great things, this is one they should introduce their children too. Every kid will enjoy the stories and for those kids that really get into them, you parents can show them where they got the true inspiration, the EC archives. Those are great comics to read just for the scary stories.I do hope this review does help a couple of parents decide on buying this DVD set for their kids because the shows today are just so watered down, it's no wonder they spend all their time on their tablets now. Shows like this will bring them back to watching TV again.",4,One of those great shows every kid should watch,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,1574,"['Tales', 'Cryptkeeper', 'was', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'yes', 'read', 'right', 'stories', 'were', 'great', 'sometimes', 'scary', 'was', 'always', 'excited', 'watch', 'show', 'saturday', 'morning', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'stories', 'range', 'scary', 'haunted', 'houses', 'mummys', 'chasing', 'kid', 'who', 'had', 'pleasure', 'growing', 'up', 'household', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'taught', 'watch', 'scary', 'movies', 'young', 'age', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'one', 'show', 'helped', 'bring', 'new', 'breed', 'television', 'shows.This', 'show', 'helped', 'inspire', 'creation', 'HBO', 'show', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'terror', 'now', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'combined', 'effects', 'cartoon', 'horror', 'just', 'right', 'pace', 'always', 'wanted', 'more', 'terror', 'gore', 'was', 'kids', 'show', 'had', 'make', 'due', 'Other', 'been', 'great', 'watch', 'again', 'relive', 'memories', 'waking', 'up', 'early', 'watch', 'great', 'saturday', 'morning', 'programming.For', 'great', 'parent', 'who', 'teaching', 'kids', 'great', 'things', 'one', 'should', 'introduce', 'children', 'too', 'kid', 'will', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'kids', 'really', 'get', 'parents', 'can', 'show', 'where', 'got', 'true', 'inspiration', 'EC', 'archives', 'are', 'great', 'comics', 'read', 'just', 'scary', 'stories.I', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'help', 'couple', 'parents', 'decide', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'kids', 'shows', 'today', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'watered', 'down', 'wonder', 'spend', 'time', 'tablets', 'now', 'Shows', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'watching', 'TV', 'again']",Tales From The Cryptkeeper: Pleasant Screams - The Complete First Season (Old Version)

1092989,A1AST89AHN17O7,B000TZJC32,Omnes,"[1, 1]","It was when I was twelve years old that I uncovered this new series they were passing on television. A children-version of the adult and graphic Tales from The Crypt, it featured the perfect John Kassir as the cryptkeeper, and invovled people from the original HBO production team like executive producer Robert Zemeckis. Though this time, this children series would be in animation, a Nelvana production, and would be monitored by psychological experts to make sure that there was nothing traumatising out of those stories. Which I personnally think is ridiculous since there are more violent and inhumane content shown in daytime tabloid talk shows, also known as ""Ambush TV"", (ie: Jenny Jones, Jerry Springer, Maury Povich, Montel Williams, etc.) and more innuendos in soap operas (ie: Days of our lives, Bold and Beautiful) than what children watch during afternoon or saturday morning TV, or read in fairy tales or in books.For this series, we have fourteen stories (two in one episode) that involve ordinary people fighting off or encountering a supernatural creature or environment, from which they grow up and learn life values. Though at times, the story's morale is quoted out loud by the cryptkeeper or by the characters. As if to make sure that we got the concept of the story, which wasn't necessary since by watching the story and seeing the charcters evolve, we can identify the message of the story by ourselves. Which was what the original Tales form the Crypt series did, although through heavy dark humour or macabre irony, from which the cryptkeeper would pinpoint out and laugh it off in his cruel laughter. Of my favorite stories, the ones I loved were ""Gone Fishin"", with an ending much closer to the original series than the other stories, ""the Sleeping Beauty"", ""Gorilla's Paw"", ""This wraps it up"", and ""A little body of work"".In its production values, the series offers background and character designs very close to what the comic books offered. However, the animation has many bloopers and mistakes such as characters layers passing over or through elements when it shouldn't be, perspective mistakes, drawing mistakes, camera bloopers, coloring bloopers on characters, etc. In the end, some of the animation bloopers made it difficult for me to appreciate what some of the stories had to offer. Not only that, I wish that they could have also put the French dubbing on this disc like they did for Redwall for, like Redwall, that dubbing offered excellent performances from the actors. And even though they sometimes modified or enhanced some of the dialogues which might stand out as bland, they gave richer layers to the storylines and better dialogues which stayed in the context of the story.Nevertheless, I have to thank this series for if it hadn't been for ""Tales from the Cryptkeeper"", I wouldn't have found out about the original series on HBO or the original comic books that caused such a controversy in the fifties.In the end, this series allowed me to recollect pleasant memories from my childhood.",4,Pleasant memories from childhood coming back to me,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,3039,"['was', 'when', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'uncovered', 'new', 'series', 'were', 'passing', 'television', 'children-version', 'adult', 'graphic', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'featured', 'perfect', 'John', 'Kassir', 'cryptkeeper', 'invovled', 'people', 'original', 'HBO', 'production', 'team', 'executive', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'time', 'children', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'animation', 'Nelvana', 'production', 'would', 'be', 'monitored', 'psychological', 'experts', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'nothing', 'traumatising', 'stories', 'Which', 'personnally', 'think', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'more', 'violent', 'inhumane', 'content', 'shown', 'daytime', 'tabloid', 'talk', 'shows', 'also', 'known', 'Ambush', 'TV', 'ie', 'Jenny', 'Jones', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'Maury', 'Povich', 'Montel', 'Williams', 'etc', 'more', 'innuendos', 'soap', 'operas', 'ie', 'Days', 'lives', 'Bold', 'Beautiful', 'what', 'children', 'watch', 'afternoon', 'saturday', 'morning', 'TV', 'read', 'fairy', 'tales', 'books.For', 'series', 'have', 'fourteen', 'stories', 'two', 'one', 'episode', 'involve', 'ordinary', 'people', 'fighting', 'off', 'encountering', 'supernatural', 'creature', 'environment', 'grow', 'up', 'learn', 'life', 'values', 'Though', 'times', 'story', 'morale', 'quoted', 'out', 'loud', 'cryptkeeper', 'characters', 'make', 'sure', 'got', 'concept', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'watching', 'story', 'seeing', 'charcters', 'evolve', 'can', 'identify', 'message', 'story', 'ourselves', 'Which', 'was', 'what', 'original', 'Tales', 'form', 'Crypt', 'series', 'did', 'heavy', 'dark', 'humour', 'macabre', 'irony', 'cryptkeeper', 'would', 'pinpoint', 'out', 'off', 'cruel', 'laughter', 'favorite', 'stories', 'ones', 'loved', 'were', 'Gone', 'Fishin', 'ending', 'much', 'closer', 'original', 'series', 'other', 'stories', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Gorilla', 'Paw', 'up', 'little', 'body', 'work', 'production', 'values', 'series', 'character', 'designs', 'very', 'close', 'what', 'comic', 'books', 'offered', 'However', 'animation', 'many', 'bloopers', 'mistakes', 'such', 'characters', 'layers', 'passing', 'elements', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'perspective', 'mistakes', 'drawing', 'mistakes', 'camera', 'bloopers', 'coloring', 'bloopers', 'characters', 'etc', 'end', 'animation', 'bloopers', 'made', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'what', 'stories', 'had', 'offer', 'Not', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'put', 'French', 'dubbing', 'disc', 'did', 'Redwall', 'Redwall', 'dubbing', 'offered', 'excellent', 'performances', 'actors', 'even', 'sometimes', 'modified', 'enhanced', 'dialogues', 'might', 'stand', 'out', 'bland', 'gave', 'richer', 'layers', 'storylines', 'better', 'dialogues', 'stayed', 'context', 'story.Nevertheless', 'have', 'thank', 'series', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Tales', 'Cryptkeeper', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'out', 'original', 'series', 'HBO', 'original', 'comic', 'books', 'caused', 'controversy', 'fifties.In', 'end', 'series', 'allowed', 'recollect', 'pleasant', 'memories', 'childhood']",Tales From The Cryptkeeper: Pleasant Screams - The Complete First Season (Old Version)

This set is great, whether you're a fan of the live action series or a kid who likes somewhat creepy cartoons. However, this was quite different from the actual HBO series. They did for the most part keep the music and John Kassir once again does the cryptkeeper's voice. The cryptkeeper gets a lot of screen time and makes cameo appearances in many of the episodes. All of the Universal Studios monsters make appearances as well even if they don't refer to them as Frankenstein, et al. Every story involves kids as the main characters getting in trouble with monsters or haunted houses so yes, the stories are a bit cheezy, but still fun. As an old comics fan, they remind me of DC's House of Secrets comic books of the 70's and 80's more than HBO's Tales From The Crypt.
