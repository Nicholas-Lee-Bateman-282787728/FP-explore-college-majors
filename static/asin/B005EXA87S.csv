Such animation is far superior to many of the animated series today.  The reason I give this release Four Stars and not Five Stars is because the restored video quality is good and not great as expected.  The colour saturation is somewhat muted in many of the episodes and there are significantly numerous scratches and other degraded film artifacts such as dark and bright splotches in many scenes.  Nevertheless, this is apparently the best quality  currently available.  Considering these episodes are 44 years old I suppose one should consider it fortunate to have at least good quality DVD episodes.",4,Mighty Mightor - Good But Not Great Quality,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,685,"['Mighty', 'Mightor', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'cartoons', '1967', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'Such', 'animation', 'far', 'superior', 'many', 'animated', 'series', 'today', 'reason', 'give', 'release', 'Four', 'Stars', 'not', 'Five', 'Stars', 'restored', 'video', 'quality', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'expected', 'colour', 'saturation', 'somewhat', 'muted', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'significantly', 'numerous', 'scratches', 'other', 'degraded', 'film', 'artifacts', 'such', 'dark', 'bright', 'splotches', 'many', 'scenes', 'Nevertheless', 'apparently', 'best', 'quality', 'currently', 'available', 'Considering', 'episodes', 'are', '44', 'years', 'old', 'suppose', 'one', 'should', 'consider', 'fortunate', 'have', 'least', 'good', 'quality', 'DVD', 'episodes']",Moby Dick And The Mighty Mightor: Complete Series

1457208,A36NUDST4Y5JBA,B005EXA87S,"D. S. HARDEN ""a movie fan""","[28, 30]","First, an historical note.In 1967, Moby Dick & The Mighty Mightor came on Saturday Mornings in Los Angeles (Channel ""4""). It was another entry from the (then) mighty Hanna-Barbera Studios, which, from 1966-1968, absolutely ruled Saturdays on all three major affliates in town:1. KNXT-TV (Columbia Broadcasting System(CBS) - Channel ""2"")2. KNBC-TV (National Broadcasting System(NBC) - Channel ""4"")3. KABC-TV (American Broadcasting System(ABC) - Channel ""7"")With that out of the way, I'll break this review into two sections:1. Moby Dick - A super whale who finds, befriends and watches over two children while they search for their father who was lost at sea during an scientific expedition. This half of the show details their adventures. Personally, it was just ""ok"" If standing on its own, it would garner at best, 3 stars.2. Mighty Mightor - The story of a young cave dweller (named ""Tor"") who saves an old Hermit being threatened by a menacing T-Rex type of creature. The Hermit, being grateful, bestows upon Tor a mystical club that possesses great power. To invoke this power, Tor only needs to raise the club above his head and say, ""Migh-Tor"" and he is instantly transformed into a being of great strength and power.This is where the fun begins.As a side ""benefit"", his pet dinosaur (""Tag"" - as in ""Guten Tag"" - german for ""Good Day""), is changed into a Fire-breathing Flying Dragon. What used to crack me up was the narrator saying ""transferred"" instead of ""transformed"" when it came to Tag. But, I digress...What amazed me about the cartoon was the level that Mightor dealt with the bad guys he encountered. There was nothing nice about those times, Tor's village was a peaceful place to live, and Mightor meant to keep it that way, using and (and every) means at his disposal.Violence? Oh, yes! Living in that hostile environment, Mightor had to deal with some very savage groups determined to attack, over-run and/or conquer his home. To attack his village was to be totally defeated/destroyed. Personally, even as an 8 year old, my view at that time was, ""That's what they get! They should've left Tor's village alone!""But there was one, ""complication"".Tor's alter ego (Mightor) was one big secret.He even had a girl that he liked (if nothing else, he had good taste!). But in this girl's eyes, he wasn't much more than a boy (and a scary one at that), so, Tor already had two strikes against him in the romance departmentAnd, ahem, she kinda had a ""thing"" for Mightor.And, she had a younger brother (""Little Rock"") who did nothing but get in trouble trying to be a ""Mightor wanna-be"".Watch the cartoons, and you'll see what I mean!One of my most favorite cartoons in the mid-to-late 60's!I rate Mighty Mightor: 5 stars!P.S.: One of my favorite Space Ghost episodes is where Space Ghost briefly meets Mightor. I figured that space ghost is anywhere from 6'1 to 6'5, but, standing next to Mightor, he looked like a kid - as Space Ghost just came to Mightor's shoulder. That made Mightor stand somewhere around 7'1 to 7'5 - I mean he was at least TWICE Space Ghost's size! This 8-year-old was blown away by that comparison. But, you'll have to get the Space Ghost Series (or find/watch it on Youtube) to see it! Don't worry, Space Ghost, too is worth the money!!

1457209,A121660P9WJSER,B005EXA87S,"Hose Nose ""B-film buff""","[1, 1]","I bought this for Mightor only.  I find the Moby Dick episodes pretty lame, but then Mightor himself isn't all that awesome, either. Interesting to me mainly for the sharp comparisons to the later Filmation He-Man series. An interesting piece of animation history but both shows are pretty much assembly line, by-the-numbers filler that Hanna-Barbera studios cranked out by the TON back in the 60's & 70's. For me, the charm of Mightor, aside from the He-Man similarities, are the character designs by Alex Toth. Mightor basically comes across a lot like Space Ghost in a loin cloth, but given that they're both created by the same artist who was stuck working on a tight timetable with a limited H-B budget, it's really no surprise.Episodes look pretty good considering their age and the fact that this release is an M.O.D. (Manufactured-on-demand) DVD-r release from Warner Bros.' Archives division.  That means no remastering, no restoration and zero extras, like 99% of their MOD stuff.

1457216,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B005EXA87S,Theo,"[2, 2]","The Hanna Barberra cartoons of this vintage were extremely simply done by today's standards. Hanna Barberra were pioneers in what was called ""limited animation"", which basically meant making a show for less money by putting in fewer moving parts. I can't help but think of a joke left by another reviewer: that their motto as a company was always ""DON'T NOBODY MOVE""!!!I also can't help but think of a line spoken by Zorak in the 1990's adult cartoon ""Space Ghost Coast to Coast"". To wit: ""Each time I move my arm it costs the Cartoon Network forty-two bucks""!But provided you take these shows as what they are, they can still be very entertaining, particularly for those of us who grew up with them. True, many (perhaps most) will be attracted primarily by nostalgia or camp value. And all of these shows most certainly have plenty of both. But... once again, provided you take them as what they are, they still work quite well as straightforward adventures too.A whole bunch of Hanna Barberra's adventure cartoons of this era have recently been released on Amazon as ""on demand"" DVDs. I personally have found that now that I'm an adult, with each of these shows a little goes a long way. I wouldn't want to watch any one of them for more than a single episode as a stretch. However, I have found that it is fun to have a bunch of different ones on hand, and switch regularly between them. An episode of Mighty Mightor here, and episode of Birdman there, add a sprinkling of Space Ghost...And Saturday Morning has returned!Oh, and grown up fans like me who also enjoy the Adult Swim lineup may be interested to note that the ""Marduk"" used in the Stimutacs episode of Sealab 2021 also makes his first appearance in this show!So far as the quality of the DVD release goes, it's a mixed bag. The first and most important thing to say is that the video and sound quality is as good as you could reasonably hope for in a show of this vintage. However, some other aspects are pretty slap-dash. There are no extras, and I've noticed at least two episodes have had all their titles switched in the menu (""episodes"" in the larger sense, meaning a group of three stories that would be screened together in a half hour block). They even got Mightor's love interest's hair color wrong on the cover!But provided you can live with such minor quibbles, and provided you don't ask too much of these shows, even as a grown-up you may still find them a lot of fun.Theo.",4,A Lot of Fun!,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2452,"['Hanna', 'Barberra', 'cartoons', 'vintage', 'were', 'extremely', 'simply', 'done', 'today', 'standards', 'Hanna', 'Barberra', 'were', 'pioneers', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'limited', 'animation', 'basically', 'meant', 'making', 'show', 'less', 'money', 'putting', 'fewer', 'moving', 'parts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'joke', 'left', 'reviewer', 'motto', 'company', 'was', 'always', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'NOBODY', 'MOVE', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'line', 'spoken', 'Zorak', '1990', 'adult', 'cartoon', 'Space', 'Ghost', 'Coast', 'Coast', 'wit', 'time', 'move', 'arm', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'forty-two', 'bucks', 'provided', 'take', 'shows', 'what', 'are', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'particularly', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'True', 'many', 'perhaps', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'attracted', 'primarily', 'nostalgia', 'camp', 'value', 'shows', 'most', 'certainly', 'have', 'plenty', 'once', 'again', 'provided', 'take', 'what', 'are', 'still', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'straightforward', 'too.A', 'whole', 'bunch', 'Hanna', 'Barberra', 'adventure', 'cartoons', 'era', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'Amazon', 'demand', 'DVDs', 'personally', 'have', 'found', 'now', ""'m"", 'adult', 'shows', 'little', 'long', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'single', 'episode', 'stretch', 'However', 'have', 'found', 'fun', 'have', 'bunch', 'different', 'ones', 'hand', 'switch', 'regularly', 'episode', 'Mighty', 'Mightor', 'here', 'episode', 'Birdman', 'add', 'sprinkling', 'Space', 'Ghost', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'returned', 'Oh', 'grown', 'up', 'fans', 'who', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'lineup', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'note', 'Marduk', 'used', 'Stimutacs', 'episode', 'Sealab', '2021', 'also', 'first', 'appearance', 'show', 'So', 'far', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'mixed', 'bag', 'first', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'say', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'reasonably', 'hope', 'show', 'vintage', 'However', 'other', 'aspects', 'are', 'pretty', 'slap-dash', 'are', 'extras', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'least', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'had', 'titles', 'switched', 'menu', 'episodes', 'larger', 'sense', 'meaning', 'group', 'three', 'stories', 'would', 'be', 'screened', 'together', 'half', 'hour', 'block', 'even', 'got', 'Mightor', 'love', 'interest', 'hair', 'color', 'wrong', 'cover', 'provided', 'can', 'live', 'such', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'provided', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'too', 'much', 'shows', 'even', 'grown-up', 'may', 'still', 'find', 'lot', 'fun.Theo']",Moby Dick And The Mighty Mightor: Complete Series
