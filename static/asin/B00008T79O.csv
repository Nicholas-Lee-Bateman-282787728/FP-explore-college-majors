747350,A1LDMDMUBJSUN4,B00008T79O,Bruce E. Munck,"[6, 8]","While this isn't one of the really great horror movies it certainly is good entertainment. I liked it enough that I recorded it from tv onto a vhs tape the last time I saw it (some 20-25 years ago). One added benefit to getting it from broadcast television is the inclusion of some classic commercials from the time including one by the 'California Raisins' and a potato chip commercial starring Justin Wilson. The premise of a bulldozer running amok and trying to kill people may sound squirrelly at first, but it really works in the movie. The movements of the blade almost convince you the machine is thinking and planning its moves. One last note of interest: this flick doesn't use cgi, it doesn't use 'claymation(tm)', it doesn't use anything other than actors and real machinery! The director did a bang-up job of creating an atmosphere of believability. If you can find this hidden gem, buy it.Note: Not related to this movie. In the mid-1070's I saw a flick about a black Camaro that chased some guys down after they caused it to run off the road. The owner of the Camaro was a girl who picked up a keychain with a troll on it from a flea market before the wreck, then ended up in the hospital as a result of the wreck. The keychain was still in the ignition and the troll commandeered the car and began seeking revenge. It was a lot like ""The Car"" in that nobody was driving the Camaro. I don't remember the name of the movie but am hoping somebody else will. Any replies will be appreciated.Update 11-7-13Thanks to some replies I found ""Crash!"", the movie I was searching for. Unfortunately, the transfer was horrible and much of the flick was difficult to watch. Maybe someday it will receive a decent treatment and release. Also, I bought the DVD release of ""KillDozer"" and just watched it last week. The transfer was adequate but not spectacular; a result, I suppose, of this being a made-for-tv movie with a limited market appeal. Still spooky the way they made that dozer blade move. My wife was unimpressed with the idea of a murdering machine, so I won't even try getting her to watch the Camaro going on a rampage - lol.

Steinmetz ""dwsteinme""","[0, 0]","As so many others have pointed out, buying this film was nothing more than an attempt to re-live a guilty pleasure from my childhood. In the early to mid-seventies, unless you had lots of disposable income to frequent the theater or drive-in (we didn't), the other option for movie entertainment were the made-for-TV offerings from the 'Big Three' (CBS, NBC, ABC).Movies like 'Killdozer' were far from the best, but still a few steps ahead of the worst. The plot involves a D-9 bulldozer being possessed by an alien intelligence. It then goes on a killing spree. The dozer used appears to be Caterpillar's classic D-9G, complete with its rear-mounted 'ripper', it had a menacing appearance even without the alien. No explanation is ever given or even suggested for the machine going after the construction crew. The premise, at face value, just seems so ludicrous that you'd think it could NEVER work. How slow or stupid do you have to be to NOT be able to avoid a lumbering bulldozer? And yet, it was the idea that was frightening...that an other-worldly intelligence would possess a soulless machine and turn it into a methodical, cold-blooded, albeit slow-moving killer.Faults? By the dozens. Why does the machine never run out of fuel? Why does the African island look more like a location on the West Coast of the US? Why can't the guys ever hear this bulldozer coming? Is it because Clint Walker keeps shouting &#34;Let's get out of here!&#34; at the top his lungs? And yet, for all its faults, the movie is still a hoot to watch. 'Independence Day' had holes in its plot as well, and that film received far more accolades than 'Killdozer' ever will. But director Jerry London, having nothing more that a handful of decent actors and some second-hand construction equipment, gave us a film that continues to inspire viewers today.",4,"What's worse than a bulldozer?

Killdozer was great fun at the time, but simply does not hold up as well as the latter three, and a number of others from that era. The casting and acting are only okay by comparison, and the writing is not as solid. Relatedly, while the other movies I mentioned have a reasonable degree of character development (especially Night Stalker), Killdozer lacks in this regard too. Nor does Killdozer develop suspense as successfully as the others. Don't get me wrong: if you are a 70s TV horror/scifi aficionado, or saw it as a kid and are waxing nostalgic, you should see this movie.

As far as I'm concerned, it's held up fairly well in the intervening years.  The script is taken from a 1944 novella by Theodore Sturgeon.  The plot isn't complicated; a few men are working on a small isolated island when something from outer space crashes on the beach.  While using a bulldozer to remove this bit of space debris, a man is killed and the bulldozer becomes possessed with an alien presence.  From that point on, it's strictly run for your life.What I particularly like about this movie is the way they managed to make each man a solid character, the danger quite real, and the killdozer a force to be reckoned with.A solid piece of entertainment.

The color is strong, perhaps a bit too over saturated, but this is preferable to being faded looking.  On smaller televisions this will likely look very good.  On larger screens the seams begin to show.

(Crash!) I was around seven years old when I went to see the film and it sort of spooked me out. It's odd though how old movies from one's past suddenly starts to haunt them many years later.You remembered much more about the plot than I did! Whenever I tried to think about the darn thing it was like trying to remember something through a foggy dream. I recalled a speeding car, powered by a mad woman with glowing eyes. (sort of like the witch in the Linda Blair movie, Summer of Fear). Also, important question; did she walk around a big flea market at the beginning of the movie? It looked like it was on the grounds of a drive-in parking lot. Does this sound familiar to you? Let me know please. Like I said, it's like a blurry dream with only snippets of moments.I'm the only horror movie fan in my family so none of them remember anything that they took me see when I was a kid. But I remember,clear as day,them taking me.(my uncle took me to see Crash! and 'Day of the Animals' but doesn't remember)  My dad took me too see 'Food of the Gods' and fell asleep, so, I'll let him pass on that. But he does remember, a little bit, when taking me to see 'The Car'. I can sit for hours and tell my mom when, and where she took me to see films like, 'Deep Red' 'Eyeball' 'Shadow of the Hawk' and 'Lipstick'...(all at the drive-in. She thinks I'm making the films up. It kinda sucks. Kinda hurts, because being an only child, leaves me with very few resources to hunt down really old flickS that I experienced and forgotten the title. And, there's not many. There's about two or three that I encountered that still haunt me till this day that I can't figure out. One,a backwoods monster movie on late nite tv......another,a sci-fi/end of the world b-film at the theater, both sometime in the 70's. Are you any good with old b-films? I only ask because you remember Crash! And, that's as rare as a film one can get.Anyway, I sidetracked, sorry. Finally, after a few years of searching on the internet, I found clips of the movie on Youtube. Also, if you don't already own it, Crash! is ready to buy on the site I-Offer. How the copy looks, I don't know. But, I think I will finally take a gamble (now that your remark on the film has rekindled the fire) and buy the darn thing.Thanks for bringing back those weird, distant memories of a screaming woman and a killer car. Movies sure are spellbinding at times. Especially when one is young. That's why I love em'!  Thanx for reading- Kevin Brian- hope to hear back from you.Ps- This review is actually a response to the guy who mentioned the movie Crash! in his Killdozer review. But if anyone else out there is good with remembering old horror films, especially of the late-night to rare, variety, let me know. I truly would hate to leave this world without ever knowing the name of the films I mentioned above. I could really use your help. Thank- Kevin",3,Crash!

On a tiny island isolated from civilization a small construction crew is working on a job site. If that wasn't enough to depress them, a meteorite crashes to earth and an evil alien being possesses their bulldozer, transforming it into Killdozer, complete with glowing headlights for eyes! The special effects are cheesy and the script is quite contrived, but despite its ridiculousness I liked this in a hokey movie way. I was particularly entranced with the scene where the bulldozer collided with the meteorite and absolutely loved when the sentient dozer destroyed the radio, the only link to the outside world for the embattled and rapidly decimated crew. At every turn Killdozer proves its intellect and vengeful spirit is superior to the humans...they plan to blow it up, it destroys their camp, etc., but humans are a stubborn lot and have one last trick up their sleeve. I am particularly grateful for the bulldozer versus steam shovel duel, which gave me a good laugh while furthering the plot immensely.The script is quite melodramatic, especially given the loopy premise of the film, but the cast (headed up by Clint Walker, Robert Urich, and Carl Betz) is good and the acting is better than you'd expect. It's true that ""Killdozer"" is not a conventional classic, but for the genre and the budget it's a better movie (and certainly a more entertaining one) than most people would suspect, with only the special effects and an occasionally over-the-top screenplay as detractors.

What happens in this movie doesn't happen quickly and can be seen for the most part a mile off, even as the men can usually see (and hear) the possessed bulldozer from afar.  Still, this macabre piece of equipment (genuinely threatening in its own right) manages to surprise the workers from time to time, gaining an unexpected upper hand.  The tension in the movie is allowed to build slowly with a foreman who has battled the bottle and is under constant suspicion from his underlings.  Still, once enough dudes die the evidence of the killing machine is filled in all and it is a fight for survival against long, if not slow, odds.This old made-for-TV movie doesn't contain the types of chills that one normally associates with horror movies; it takes its unnerving attitude from the feel of a good Twilight Zone episode (reality has been tweaked just a bit and all one can do is survive it) and one of the great things about it is that it doesn't bother trying to explain the phenomena.
