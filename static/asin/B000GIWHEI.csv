1004651,A311Z9223A52RW,B000GIWHEI,"Ayesha ""Kathy""","[22, 22]","When I saw this DVD at my local Cracker Barrel, I hesitated to purchase it - but only briefly.  I can still remember laughing until I cried when I watched this show as a child and I'm happy to say that decades later, I laugh just as I hard when I pop this baby into my DVD player.  In fact, I've watched it a couple of times and I'm STILL laughing!Only Alan Funt perfected the art of granting us the opportunity to ""watch people being themselves"".  He did this by placing people in various, unexpected situations that were either comical, crazy, or even at times ""Twilight Zone-ish"".  The comedy results as we watch the unsuspecting performers as they react to their respective situations.  Some of my personal favorites:  the talking horse; the motorless vehicle; the stenographer; the talking mailbox; the sideways elevator; and a host of other snippets that had me laughing so hard my sides ached.For those of you who may not be familiar with Candid Camera, this isn't just another one of ""America's Funniest Home Videos"".  There are no scenes of motorcycle or three-wheeler wipe-outs, no one falls 8 or 10 feet off a stage or anything else, and you won't see anyone puking on screen, either.  Candid Camera is fresh, innovative, funny, and wonderfully lacking in anything that could be deemed offensive or disgusting.Another unique addition to this DVD is several interviews with young children.  ""Out of the Mouths of Babes"" is never without its charm - and with Alan Funt as the interviewer, it's even more endearing.  I'm sure that this DVD will keep me laughing for years to come.",5,"The Best ""Reality"" TV Out There",1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,1588,"['When', 'saw', 'DVD', 'local', 'Cracker', 'Barrel', 'hesitated', 'purchase', 'only', 'briefly', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'laughing', 'cried', 'when', 'watched', 'show', 'child', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'decades', 'later', 'laugh', 'just', 'hard', 'when', 'pop', 'baby', 'DVD', 'player', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'couple', 'times', ""'m"", 'STILL', 'laughing', 'Only', 'Alan', 'Funt', 'perfected', 'art', 'granting', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'people', 'being', 'did', 'placing', 'people', 'various', 'unexpected', 'situations', 'were', 'comical', 'crazy', 'even', 'times', 'Twilight', 'Zone-ish', 'comedy', 'results', 'watch', 'unsuspecting', 'performers', 'react', 'respective', 'situations', 'personal', 'favorites', 'talking', 'horse', 'motorless', 'vehicle', 'stenographer', 'talking', 'mailbox', 'sideways', 'elevator', 'host', 'other', 'snippets', 'had', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'sides', 'ached.For', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'Candid', 'Camera', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'America', 'Funniest', 'Home', 'Videos', 'are', 'scenes', 'motorcycle', 'three-wheeler', 'wipe-outs', 'one', '8', '10', 'feet', 'stage', 'anything', 'else', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'puking', 'screen', 'either', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'fresh', 'innovative', 'funny', 'wonderfully', 'lacking', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'deemed', 'offensive', 'unique', 'addition', 'DVD', 'several', 'interviews', 'young', 'children', 'Mouths', 'Babes', 'never', 'charm', 'Alan', 'Funt', 'interviewer', 'even', 'more', 'endearing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'DVD', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'years', 'come']",Candid Camera: Greatest Moments

This particular DVD is absolutely hilarious and we found ourselves laughing often at the antics. However, the Lord's name in vain is used several times throughout the DVD, which is sad.
