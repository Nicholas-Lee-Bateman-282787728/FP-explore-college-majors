1563350,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B008JFUQ16,Ace Reader,"[7, 26]","I was sadly disappointed by this second effort by production company Illumination Entertainment of ""Despicable Me 2"". They are also responsible for the release of the thoroughly entertaining ""Despicable Me"" (their first release), in 2010. It does appears to be a huge hit with young children and their parents which surprises me. I myself did not enjoy it as much as they did. True my children are all grown up and I'm older then these parents I witnessed belly-laughing with their kids over ex-mastermind villain Gru and his silly yellow minions antics, but I know a good story when I see one and this story was average, slow, and boring. It did not engage me or have the spark and snap that I was looking forward to and have found this year in other recent animated films.I just watched Disney~Pixar's ""Monster's University"" and I loved it so much I gave it (5 stars) rating in my review, and I do plan on seeing it again before it leaves the theaters. If you do choose to see this film, you should then go see ""Monster's University"" to compare story lines, laughs, and entertainment value. Disney~Pixar wins, and Blue Sky Studios ""Epic"" is better as well.This sequel's story line is about ex-mastermind villain Gru voiced again by the talented funny man Steve Carell as the happy father of three little girls he adopted in the first film ""Despicable Me"". A new super-villain has made himself known to Anti-Villain League by stealing a new scientifically developed substance that when injected into living things changes them into hungry purple monsters. Anti-Villain League has discovered traces of this substance to a nearby mall. Gru and League teem member agent Lucy Wilde (voiced by Kristen Wiig known for being a cast member of ""Saturday Night Live"" from 2005-2006), work undercover together in this mall to discover who this new super criminal is and stop him. A cute highlight in this film is Agent Lucy Wilde's ""James Bond-like"" car that turns into a submarine just like the one used in 1977 ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". Well done!So ""Despicable Me"" is much better then ""Despicable Me 2"". At times ""Despicable Me 2"" is funny and cute, but not enough for me. I would not want to see this one again. I only recommend ""Despicable Me 2"" to parents and their children who enjoyed the first one. The rest of you go see ""Monster's University"". It's better. Enjoy!Release Date: 3 July 2013Running Time: 98 minutesRating: PG for rude humor and mild action.American/Comedy/Crime/FamilyGrade: CP.S.

We hadn't planned on seeing it this weekend but we were running early at the multiplex and the next showing of MONSTERS U was full.  Neither of us had seen D.M. 2's predecessor but it didn't matter once we caught onto the fact that the Minions are kind of like Gremlins or Ewoks except they have very little hair, there are tons of them, some have only one eye, and all of them love to go into costume.  The plot has superspy overtones, as the formerly despicable main character Gru (voice of Steve Carrell) is shanghai'd by the international Anti-Villain League to find out who is about to enslave the world (the likely culprits have been winnowed down to the proprietors of the stores at the local shopping mall).  Lucy, a way over-the-top near-novice girl spy (Kristen Wiig) joins our hero and at the beginning there is no love lost between them . . .  but things develop.  So what you have is basically a super-high-energy 98-minute animated feature that's part spy caper, part screwball comedy, part teen romance (Miranda Cosgrove returns as the eldest daughter), capped with the Minions singing a spirited version of the Village People's ""Y.M.C.A."" in Minion-ese.  Benjamin Bratt as a macho restaurateur and Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario add to the fun.  Rated PG, though I'm not sure why except there's some comic SPLAT-ing going on, and the Minions apparently think the word ""bottom"" is naughty.  (One whispers the word to another, they both titter; then the children in the audience titter, followed by the adults.  It's just that kind of movie.)

1563396,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008JFUQ16,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","I'm not ashamed to say that `Despicable Me' was one of my favorite movies of 2010.  Granted, the year itself was not a very great one, with only a handful of truly amazing films being made (`The Social Network', `Blue Valentine' and `Toy Story 3' being the best of them), but even still, `Despicable Me' is a respectable and entertaining film that made something unique, charming and completely original out of a genre that has had its fair share of redundancies.  While it seemed to be all over the place at times, it was truly a breath of fresh air.I was excited for `Despicable Me 2'; really excited.  Like I said, I really liked the first one and so the idea of Gru and his newfound family coming back for another adventure had me anticipating something special.I can't say that `Despicable Me 2' is anything new or fresh when you consider where the plot is going (far more generic and predictable than the first film), but these characters are so joyous that one can't help but fall in love with their whole troop.  The kids are hilarious, especially young Agnes, and the inclusion of Lucy is great, especially since both Wiig and Carell have great comedic chemistry here.The plot follows newly `straight-laced' Gru as he is pulled into the dangerous world of espionage by the Anti-Villain League.  They need Gru to use his master bad-guy skills to help capture a real bad-guy who has stolen a mutation serum.  Gru is hesitant, but his current profession (he's making jams and jellies in his basement laboratory) isn't working out so good for him, so he decides to give it a go.  He's paired up with hyperactive and completely star-struck Lucy (she loved Gru's work as a villain) and together they scope out the mall looking for the bad guy.  Gru has his hunches, but it becomes clear that those hunches are clouded with personal feelings when his eldest daughter Margo falls for the charming young son of the man Gru thinks is the real baddie.The usual lovelorn antics occur with the parent despising the idea of his daughter seeking out a love interest.  Daughter's heart gets broken, father mends the tears, father hides from love, father falls in love, everyone is happy.  It isn't really the story that makes this film work, but the way that it is crafted.  There is just so much to love here.  The dialog is sharp, the character development is heartwarming, the criminal activity is comical and the minions are hysterical (yes, I'm one of those people who laugh at everything they do).This was a great family film, one that was bursting at every seam with something to enjoy.  It's not as good as the film one, but it's make good on the promise and actually delivers a sequel that is on par with what we were originally presented with.I give this an A-, and hope to GOD that it winds up on Oscar's ballot over the likes of `Epic'.  This is honestly the best animated film I've seen this year (yes, better than `Monster's University') and I really would love to see it recognized, especially since the first one was denied despite being better than two of Oscar's nominees that year.",5,"Dripping with 'funny', this sequel makes me happy!",1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,3093,"[""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'say', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', '2010', 'Granted', 'year', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'great', 'one', 'only', 'handful', 'truly', 'amazing', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'Social', 'Network', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'being', 'best', 'even', 'still', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'respectable', 'entertaining', 'film', 'made', 'something', 'unique', 'charming', 'completely', 'original', 'genre', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'redundancies', 'seemed', 'be', 'place', 'times', 'was', 'truly', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.I', 'was', 'excited', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'really', 'excited', 'said', 'really', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'so', 'idea', 'Gru', 'newfound', 'family', 'coming', 'back', 'adventure', 'had', 'anticipating', 'something', 'special.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'anything', 'new', 'fresh', 'when', 'consider', 'where', 'plot', 'going', 'far', 'more', 'generic', 'predictable', 'first', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'joyous', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'whole', 'troop', 'kids', 'are', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'young', 'Agnes', 'inclusion', 'Lucy', 'great', 'especially', 'Wiig', 'Carell', 'have', 'great', 'comedic', 'chemistry', 'here.The', 'plot', 'newly', 'straight-laced', 'Gru', 'pulled', 'dangerous', 'world', 'espionage', 'Anti-Villain', 'League', 'need', 'Gru', 'use', 'master', 'bad-guy', 'skills', 'help', 'capture', 'real', 'bad-guy', 'who', 'stolen', 'mutation', 'serum', 'Gru', 'hesitant', 'current', 'profession', 'making', 'jams', 'jellies', 'basement', 'laboratory', ""n't"", 'working', 'out', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'give', 'go', 'paired', 'up', 'hyperactive', 'completely', 'star-struck', 'Lucy', 'loved', 'Gru', 'work', 'villain', 'together', 'scope', 'out', 'mall', 'looking', 'bad', 'guy', 'Gru', 'hunches', 'clear', 'hunches', 'are', 'clouded', 'personal', 'feelings', 'when', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Margo', 'charming', 'young', 'son', 'man', 'Gru', 'real', 'baddie.The', 'usual', 'lovelorn', 'antics', 'occur', 'parent', 'despising', 'idea', 'daughter', 'seeking', 'out', 'love', 'interest', 'Daughter', 'heart', 'broken', 'father', 'tears', 'father', 'love', 'father', 'falls', 'love', 'everyone', 'happy', ""n't"", 'really', 'story', 'film', 'work', 'way', 'crafted', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'here', 'dialog', 'sharp', 'character', 'development', 'heartwarming', 'criminal', 'activity', 'comical', 'minions', 'are', 'hysterical', 'yes', ""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'laugh', 'everything', 'do', '.This', 'was', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'bursting', 'seam', 'something', 'enjoy', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'make', 'good', 'promise', 'actually', 'sequel', 'par', 'what', 'were', 'originally', 'presented', 'with.I', 'give', 'A-', 'hope', 'GOD', 'up', 'Oscar', 'ballot', 'likes', 'Epic', 'honestly', 'best', 'animated', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'yes', 'better', 'Monster', 'University', 'really', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'recognized', 'especially', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'denied', 'being', 'better', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'year']",N/A

They are easily the funniest characters in any children's film, like, EVER. Their antics never, ever fail to amuse, and I see a bright, banana-filled future for them. Gut-bursting moments include one minion's ill-fated attempt at making jam, and Gru's immature fire brigade (&#34;BEE-DO, BEE-DO!&#34;).So it's a pity then, that the majority of the film is given to Gru's (Steve Carell) stale and rather bland relationship with his girls - Agnes, Whatever, and Blah Blah, or something, some rather dull spy work, and a very unthreatening and uninteresting villain's plot. Let's talk a bit about the villain. In a movie where pretty much ALL your characters are villains, or people operating deep in the shades of grey...you really need a strong antagonist. Despicable Me had that strong antagonist in Vector - a hilarious, nerdy, comically ineffective but dastardly bad guy. Despicable Me TWO has the rather unthreatening and unfunny Eduardo.Really Dreamworks? It thought you learned your lesson. The only reason we forked out close to a billion dollars to see DESPICABLE ME 2 was for minions - those little yellow bundles of instant comedy.When you see past the hilarity of stylized slapstick, you find a film that is clich&eacute;d, rather bland, and trying way too hard. A sizable disappointment, which is not to say unfunny. I tremendously enjoyed watching Despicable Me 2, and was heaving with laughter half the time. It just could have been so much better.

This movie (and Despicable Me) are two that I never grow tired of having on because not only are they good fun but they somehow manage to keep things fresh and entertaining even after you've seen them two dozen times.This movie takes place not long after the first, Gru has given up his criminal endeavors and is focusing on raising his three daughters and crafting a ""delicious"" line of jams and jellies.  The tranquil life of parenthood proves elusive however as another villain has recently stolen a secret formula which can create mindless, indestructible super baddies.  Helping Gru, aside from his trusty minions (who are hilarious as ever) is Penny, a wonderful sidekick and potential love interest on the hunt through the local mall to find out who isn't really who they seem to be.Thankfully, there is a lot going on in this picture that not only keeps kiddos entertained, but it also has some great material for parents.  I would classify this as super safe family entertainment.

Gru has gone straight and is busy single-parenting his three adorable adopted little girls Margo, Agnes, and Edith while dodging the neighborhood matchmaker.  He and Dr. Nefario, another former super villain, are partners in a not-very-successful jam and jelly enterprise.  But life has some surprises in store for Gru, beginning with his kidnapping from Agnes' birthday party by the secret agent Lucy Wilde, in a sequence that would have done credit to any recent James Bond movie.The Anti-Villain League or AVL wants Gru's help in locating another super villain, the one who made off with an entire Arctic research station and a secret formula that turns people into monsters.  AVL suspects the villain may be hiding out in a large mall.  The mismatched Gru and Agent Lucy are assigned to the case, which has them checking out suspects, including a salsa restaurant owner and a wig seller.  To go further would be to impose order on a plot that is intentionally chaotic and over the top.  Suffice it to say that in the end, the world will be saved, Gru will conquer his fears about dating women, and the girls will have a new mother.The animation is even better than last time. Much more screen time is given to the antics of the minions, who have developed distinct personalities.

They have to somehow extend the premise of the original movie to new areas while still hitting all the notes that the audience liked from that first one. Two goals that head in different directions. Despicable Me 2 largely manages the task though.It is a little less focussed than the first move as it tries to give all the characters something to do while simultaneously introducing the new plot. But once it gets all the plates spinning it keeps things going nicely and pulls everything together for the end.It's also a movie that's very aware of its dual audience. So we have fart jokes and people giggling about the word bottom, but we also get pop culture references and nods to old Bond movies amongst other things.The voice cast remains strong with Steve Carrell and Kristen Wiig doing a great job anchoring the movie. Wiig's character Lucy is in many ways the key element here as the plot takes the next obvious step of trying to add a mother figure to the family that Gru acquired in the first film. Again we're not really lighting the world on fire with originality but it's all done with polish and flair.And then of course there are the minions. In many ways the star of the Despicable Me franchise, and clearly the producers know it. The minions get more time to be cartoony and silly this time round. A lot of it doesn't exactly add to the plot, but it had my 8 year olds laughing hysterically. So mission accomplished right?All round a great family film.

1563643,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUQ16,FNDNreview,"[3, 5]","In the summer of 2010, Illumination Entertainment's animated flick, Despicable Me, decimated the box office, earning $543 million - not to mention garnering praise from fans and critics alike.  A family-friendly film, Despicable Me follows Gru, an evil super villain, as he adopts three girls with hopes of using them to one-up a rival super villain.  Instead, he falls into the role of devoted father, giving up on his evil ways.  Most notably, the film also introduces the Minions - Gru's short, yellow workers that speak gibberish and often find themselves engaging in an endless amount of comical hijinks.  Now, Gru and his Minions are back, along with Agnes, Edith, and Margo in the animated sequel, Despicable Me 2.Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud return to direct Despicable Me 2, which once again stars Steve Carrell as Gru - a now retired super-villain that's attempting to create his own brand of jelly.  At the same time, a mysterious villain has stolen a chemical recipe that can turn living things into indestructible purple killing machines.  Desperate to stop the mysterious villain, the Anti-Villain League (AVL) enlists Gru's help, pairing him with an AVL agent, Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg), to track down the villain and stop them before they unleash the recipe on the world.  The voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaaier, Elsie Fisher, Ken Jeong, Russell Brand, and Benjamin Bratt also star in supporting roles.To be honest, I found Despicable Me to be so light-heartedly entertaining and enjoyable that's it's easily at the top of my animated feature list (just so you know that I'm being biased here).  With that being said, Despicable Me 2 has been one of my must-see movies all summer long...and it didn't disappoint me one bit.  As an easy target for slap-stick comedy (and I'll give you one guess who my favorite comedy trio is), the Minions are good for wholesome unadulterated laughter.  As usual, their antics and gibberish talk will have you laughing to the limit - but only if you're interested in that sort of thing.  It's easy to imagine Despicable Me being everyone's favorite animated feature, or quite honestly the animated film you'll never want to see again.  Just because The Three Stooges brand of humor is my thing doesn't mean it's going to agree with everyone's style of humor.  In fact, it's pretty easy to imagine someone describing a film of this nature as being ""dumb"" or ""pointless.""  However, if that's how you felt about the first film, I couldn't disagree with you more.While the first film focused more on the girls and their quest to find a home to call their own (and a father to care for them), Despicable Me 2 focuses much more on the Minions.  In fact, at a short 90 minutes or so, it almost feels like the girls are absent from the film entirely.  Speaking of a reduced role, Russell Brand's character, Dr. Nefariou (although important to the film's climax) is also absent for the majority of the film.  However, that's not to say the film isn't without enjoyable characters.  Between the Minions and the plump villain in question, Eduardo Perez (originally voiced by Al Pacino, but changed to Benjamin Bratt just months before the film's release date), there's no shortage of memorable moments.  At the same time, there's love in the air throughout the film with the introduction of the ambitious Lucky Wilde, who (if you couldn't tell from the film's trailer) has a pretty memorable first meeting with Gru.There's not a whole lot to say about this film that wasn't said about the first film.  It's a family-friendly flick that absolutely anyone can enjoy.  The animation is sharp, colorful, and pristine.  Plus, the characters will have you giggling virtually nonstop.  While I'm admittedly not a huge Steve Carrell fan, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Gru - so with that being said, this is the one exception where I would be writing someone a letter on Mr. Carrell's behalf if for some reason he was ever replaced.  Regardless, the characters are clearly catching on in popularity - especially the Minions who will be getting a movie of their own, called Minions (hitting theaters in December 2014).  And, as long as the plot is solid (which it is) and the Minions are funny (which they are), Illumination Entertainment can keep punching out as many Despicable Me films as they want.P.S. - Make sure to stay through the credits.  The Minions will be taking auditions for their new film next year.Grade:  B+FNDNreview.com",4,Gru and the Minions are back and better than ever...,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,4502,"['summer', '2010', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'animated', 'flick', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'decimated', 'box', 'office', 'earning', '543', 'million', 'not', 'mention', 'garnering', 'praise', 'fans', 'critics', 'alike', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'Gru', 'evil', 'super', 'villain', 'three', 'girls', 'hopes', 'using', 'one-up', 'rival', 'super', 'villain', 'Instead', 'role', 'devoted', 'father', 'giving', 'up', 'evil', 'ways', 'Most', 'notably', 'film', 'also', 'Minions', 'Gru', 'short', 'yellow', 'workers', 'speak', 'gibberish', 'often', 'find', 'engaging', 'endless', 'amount', 'comical', 'hijinks', 'Now', 'Gru', 'Minions', 'are', 'back', 'Agnes', 'Edith', 'Margo', 'animated', 'sequel', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2.Directors', 'Pierre', 'Coffin', 'Chris', 'Renaud', 'return', 'direct', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'once', 'again', 'stars', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Gru', 'now', 'retired', 'super-villain', 'attempting', 'create', 'own', 'brand', 'jelly', 'same', 'time', 'mysterious', 'villain', 'stolen', 'chemical', 'recipe', 'can', 'turn', 'living', 'things', 'indestructible', 'purple', 'killing', 'machines', 'Desperate', 'stop', 'mysterious', 'villain', 'Anti-Villain', 'League', 'AVL', 'Gru', 'help', 'pairing', 'AVL', 'agent', 'Lucy', 'Wilde', 'Kristen', 'Wigg', 'track', 'down', 'villain', 'stop', 'unleash', 'recipe', 'world', 'voices', 'Miranda', 'Cosgrove', 'Dana', 'Gaaier', 'Elsie', 'Fisher', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.To', 'be', 'honest', 'found', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'be', 'so', 'light-heartedly', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'easily', 'top', 'animated', 'feature', 'list', 'just', 'so', 'know', ""'m"", 'being', 'biased', 'here', 'being', 'said', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'been', 'one', 'must-see', 'movies', 'summer', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'one', 'bit', 'easy', 'target', 'slap-stick', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'give', 'one', 'guess', 'who', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'trio', 'Minions', 'are', 'good', 'wholesome', 'unadulterated', 'laughter', 'usual', 'antics', 'gibberish', 'talk', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'limit', 'only', ""'re"", 'interested', 'sort', 'thing', 'easy', 'imagine', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'being', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'animated', 'feature', 'quite', 'honestly', 'animated', 'film', ""'ll"", 'never', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'Just', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'brand', 'humor', 'thing', ""n't"", 'mean', 'going', 'agree', 'everyone', 'style', 'humor', 'fact', 'pretty', 'easy', 'imagine', 'someone', 'describing', 'film', 'nature', 'being', 'dumb', 'pointless', 'However', 'how', 'felt', 'first', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more.While', 'first', 'film', 'focused', 'more', 'girls', 'quest', 'find', 'home', 'call', 'own', 'father', 'care', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'focuses', 'much', 'more', 'Minions', 'fact', 'short', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'almost', 'feels', 'girls', 'are', 'absent', 'film', 'entirely', 'Speaking', 'reduced', 'role', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Nefariou', 'important', 'film', 'climax', 'also', 'absent', 'majority', 'film', 'However', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'Minions', 'plump', 'villain', 'question', 'Eduardo', 'Perez', 'originally', 'voiced', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'changed', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'just', 'months', 'film', 'release', 'date', 'shortage', 'memorable', 'moments', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'air', 'film', 'introduction', 'ambitious', 'Lucky', 'Wilde', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'film', 'trailer', 'pretty', 'memorable', 'first', 'meeting', 'Gru.There', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'say', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'said', 'first', 'film', 'family-friendly', 'flick', 'absolutely', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'animation', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'pristine', 'characters', 'will', 'have', 'giggling', 'virtually', 'nonstop', ""'m"", 'admittedly', 'not', 'huge', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'fan', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'Gru', 'so', 'being', 'said', 'one', 'exception', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'writing', 'someone', 'letter', 'Mr.', 'Carrell', 'behalf', 'reason', 'was', 'ever', 'replaced', 'Regardless', 'characters', 'are', 'clearly', 'catching', 'popularity', 'especially', 'Minions', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'movie', 'own', 'called', 'Minions', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'December', '2014', 'as', 'long', 'plot', 'solid', 'Minions', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'can', 'keep', 'punching', 'out', 'many', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'films', 'want.P.S', 'Make', 'sure', 'stay', 'credits', 'Minions', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'auditions', 'new', 'film', 'next', 'year.Grade', 'B+FNDNreview.com']",N/A

Parenting is no less sticky, and the fact that Gru will go to any length to ensure the happiness of his adopted girls Agnes, Edith, and Margo is evident by the elaborate birthday party he's throwing for Agnes that includes a live unicorn and a princess named Gruzinkerbell. Anti-Villain League operative Lucy Wild (Kristen Wiig) kidnaps Gru after the party, using an arsenal of spy gadgetry that would make James Bond jealous, and the agency solicits his help in apprehending a criminal who's made an entire secret lab disappear from the Arctic Circle and stolen a dangerous transmutation formula.The lure of excitement tempts Gru, and he and Lucy set up an undercover operation in a bakery in Paradise Mall, the minions start cranking out cupcakes, and Gru and Lucy begin investigating their fellow business owners. Meanwhile, Agnes pines for a mother, Margo finds her first boyfriend, Dr. Nefario takes a more exciting job, a slew of minions go missing, and Gru staunchly refuses to enter the dating scene. Little does Gru know that his whole life is about to change once again. The minions and their antics are quite funny in this second film, and, for the 10-and-under crowd, they completely steal the show.My Review:Ever since the minion craze has hit the digital air waves my children have been hooked. And the second movie in the series is just as great as the first if not better. My favorite part was the Agnes' birthday party scene when the fairy princess didn't show up to entertain the party guests. Then what Gru does next was so incredibly sweet and Agnes' response to it was priceless. This movie is sure to make you laugh and shed a tear or two.Gru is suddenly thrust back out into the work force, his former career that he had recently left to raise his precious daughters. The reason being is that El Macho,the evil genius behind the newest rush to take over the world is on the loose and has some dirty tricks up his sleeve. So the Anti-Villain League recruit Gru to capture this guy and save the world. The pull of trying to keep the world safe, a world that also holds his precious daughters makes it very hard for Gru not to want to take care of this evil villain.

Back in 2010, this was definitely the case, with movies like Alpha & Omega, Shrek Forever, Megamind, Guardians, etc. hitting the theater (aside from the must see movies, like Toy Story 3).  That summer, we decided to put some of our chips on Despicable Me, thanks to Steve Carell voicing the main character, Gru, and the little yellow Minions that we saw in the trailer.Who knew that the Minions would be so damn funny?Needless to say, Despicable Me was a huge hit, mostly on the strength of the heart of the story and the antics of the Minions.  Shortly after it's release, it was announced that there would be a sequel.  Excitement.  This followed with some teasers, a trailer, and finally, this weekend, it's here.Despicable Me 2 takes a different direction from the first, showing Gru as a caring family man.  This time, he's recruited to help take on a new villain named Big Macho.  There aren't many surprises coming from the story here.  It's quite predicable and doesn't surprise on any beat.  The voice work is serviceable, with Carell delivering and Wiig...hanging in there.  However...is it funny?  Heck yeah it is.  The Minions DELIVER.  There are several gags which I won't spoil, but they are arguably more funny than they were in the first one.  Several scenes had us (and the entire theater) laughing out loud, including one guy who laughed the loudest that I've ever heard in a theater (honestly, it made the movie even funnier).Bottom line...the kids will love it, and you'll probably love it too.  After the movie, it's teased that there will be a Minion movie (not a surprise, already announced), and I simply cannot wait for that.  The Minions are turning Despicable Me into one of the funniest animated franchises of all time.Final Score: 5/5",5,Despicable Me 2 - Delivering on all fronts.,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,1876,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'animated', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'now', 'tough', 'pick', 'where', 'put', 'money', 'Back', '2010', 'was', 'definitely', 'case', 'movies', 'Alpha', 'Omega', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'Megamind', 'Guardians', 'etc', 'hitting', 'theater', 'aside', 'must', 'see', 'movies', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'summer', 'decided', 'put', 'chips', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'thanks', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'voicing', 'main', 'character', 'Gru', 'little', 'yellow', 'Minions', 'saw', 'trailer.Who', 'knew', 'Minions', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'damn', 'funny', 'Needless', 'say', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'mostly', 'strength', 'heart', 'story', 'antics', 'Minions', 'Shortly', 'release', 'was', 'announced', 'would', 'be', 'sequel', 'Excitement', 'followed', 'teasers', 'trailer', 'finally', 'weekend', 'here.Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'different', 'direction', 'first', 'showing', 'Gru', 'caring', 'family', 'man', 'time', 'recruited', 'help', 'take', 'new', 'villain', 'named', 'Big', 'Macho', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'surprises', 'coming', 'story', 'here', 'quite', 'predicable', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'beat', 'voice', 'work', 'serviceable', 'Carell', 'delivering', 'Wiig', 'hanging', 'there', 'However', 'funny', 'Heck', 'yeah', 'Minions', 'DELIVER', 'are', 'several', 'gags', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'are', 'arguably', 'more', 'funny', 'were', 'first', 'one', 'Several', 'scenes', 'had', 'entire', 'theater', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'including', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'laughed', 'loudest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'theater', 'honestly', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'funnier', '.Bottom', 'line', 'kids', 'will', 'love', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'too', 'movie', 'teased', 'will', 'be', 'Minion', 'movie', 'not', 'surprise', 'already', 'announced', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'Minions', 'are', 'turning', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'one', 'funniest', 'animated', 'franchises', 'time.Final', 'Score', '5/5']",N/A

They had nothing to say.  So this is about 90 minutes of minions, minions and more minions- oh, and two lame romances I can't imagine either the kids watching the movie or the parents who accompanied them could give a damn about.I knew I was in for a LONG 90 minutes when I realized that the fart gun- a harmless, three-second gag in the first film, was going to be shown as a freaking institution in the second.  ""20-fart salute?""  Um, the gun was made by ACCIDENT in the first film.  Dr. Nefario said ""ok, I wondered why anyone would have any use for this...""  There are TWENTY in the second film?  And it's used TWICE? Wasn't funny ONCE!Then the romance storylines.  Groan.  Nobody cares if Gru finds a wife (including Gru.)  NOBODY cares if the oldest girl finds a boyfriend.  I'm grateful that the opportunity for product placement when we find she's texting someone was passed by at least.  The girl Gru falls for is annoying as hell, and a really good reason not to see Despicable Me 3, if the rest of this mess wasn't enough already.Finally, I was really annoyed at the dropped plot point concerning the villain's kid.  The villain has a young son- yet he's willing to commit murder and transform thousands of minions- and HIMSELF- into a rampaging, homicidal beast...umm, if he does this, who is going to take care of the kid?  We kind of needed to see some resolution here- if the villain is now captured and facing prison, what becomes of his son?Anyway, this film was a chore to sit through, so unlike the first film, which was a pleasure I've gone back to several times.

Part of  ""Despicable Me 2's"" (hereafter DM2) success are its inspired plot borrowings such as ""The Incredibles"", the Bond movie series, ""Lilo and Stitch"" and even ""Cars 2"" to embroil everyone's favorite Uncle Fester/Dr. Evil hybrid ex-supervillian Gru (Steve Carell) in a world dominance plot using cute beasties turned into purple, fanged wrecking balls.Another part of its success is the gradual revelation of Gru's more positive qualities such as his growing, more tolerant, and sometimes excessive compassion towards his adoptive children Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), the eldest and a budding teenager, tomboyish middle child Edith (Dana Gaier), and button-cute unicorn fanatic Agnes (Elsie Fisher), the youngest.  We also must not forget the winning, prepossessing debut of  resourceful Anti-Villain League agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig, using her Lola Bunny voice from ""The Looney Tunes Show"") who recruits the somewhat reluctant Gru to go uncover with her at a mall bakery to uncover which of the mall proprietors is behind the purple mutant plot.  The flabby but suave and mysterious Eduardo Perez/El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), the mall Mexican restaurant owner with an alluring son (Mois&eacute;s Arias) involved with Margo, also keeps the proceedings hopping.  All of the aforementioned stuff, in my opinion, works as smart, coherent entertainment.But what powers and keeps this bullet train together is one of the most insidiously and surprisingly endearing creations of any movie - the little old Minions.  These slyly captivating characters prove the old adage that introducing lots of cute, fun, silly, little people in a movie is a surefire, lucrative way to lure people to an animated film. Characters such as the Smurfs, Pokemon, and the 627 experiments from ""Lilo and Stitch"" have certainly proven that.  They can easily capture young children's interest.But unlike the Smurfs, etc., Minions have crossover appeal to parents as well.  Sure they babble childishly and otherwise act like overstimulated, quarrelsome brats.  But the Minions are also industrious, satirical and hip assistants with some adult sensibilities, always eager to help Gru with his radically new espionage job, parenting, and love life predicaments.  These Twinkie-shaped, blue over-all wearing dynamos keep DM2's pace from ever flagging.This is not to say that the Minions completely detract from the main storyline.  I think we want to see Gru surmount childhood disappointments, his uncertainties and his sinister past to be a good do-gooder, better parent, and perhaps a suitable match for Lucy.  But DM2 wouldn't be quite the same without the Minions serving as Greek chorus, comedy relief, and (mostly) trustworthy Gru sidekicks AND foster children.  No wonder Illumination Entertainment plans an exclusive feature for them.

1563802,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B008JFUQ16,Josh,"[19, 24]","As stated in my earlier review for Despicable Me, this movie was on my 2013 must watch list. So after its near 3 week highly successful run, here is my review for: Despicable Me 2.Despicable Me 2 brings back Steve Carrell as everyone's favorite bad guy, Gru. Also returning are Miranda Cosgrove as Margo, Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario, and Elsie Fisher and Dana Gaier as Agnes and Edith. Newcomers to the movie include Benjamin Bratt as Eduardo, Moises Arias as Antonio, Steve Coogan as Mr Silas Ramsbottom, and although she played a minor role in the first film, Kristen Wigg portrays the lady with the lipstick, Lucy Wilde. The cast did an excellent job.The story line is highly enjoyable, not quite as charming as the first film in my opinion but still very enjoyable. There is the right amount of humor, the animation is well put together, and the minions (as always), are at it again.My complaint that it is not as memorable as the first is easily overlooked Thanks to Despicable Me 2 being so smart. It has the smarts, the fun, and still has the heart that made us fall in love with the original movie. I have a feeling that a 3rd sequel will be made in due time; while in the meantime, the minions themselves will be getting a movie all on their own in July of 2015. To close out my review If you have not seen this movie, What are you waiting for? GO SEE Despicable Me 2!

1563808,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B008JFUQ16,judy,"[3, 4]","The minions are back for the 2nd time! I remember seeing Despicable Me in theaters, back in July 2010. That was a long time ago. I have to admit I was a little disappointed by the film when I first watched the trailers, cause I felt that they were gonna over use the minions and spend less time on the human characters, including Gru.  They didn't which surprised me but I was happy that they didn't over use them.  The minions.  I love em, they cranked out a few of the jokes, and while the jokes don't come out as many as you would wish this film still gives out a few decent  jokes.  I've only seen 3 animated films of this year out of 5 that have been released, and this is by far my favorite.  Also I tip my hat off to the trailer creators who  gave us minions, and no story, which  helped keep what would happen in the movie a  mystery, even though  I was angry at not seeing any footage from the film till March 2013, I was still happy.  Let's start with what's wrong with this film which includes the jokes, plot, and villain.  The jokes as I explained earlier don't come flying out and we only get a few at a time, which is but a miner issue to note. I still found the film funny in the most parts.  The plot has got to be the weak spot in the film.  The plots simple, too simple to follow. I get that this is a children's movie but please why not make it a little trickier to follow, because I started to get bored by the overly simple plot that barely grabbed my father's attention who attended the movies with me.  The major issue is the villain.  The voice acting for the villain is excellent and the character himself, it's just they didn't make him a very good villain.  I have to say this is a weaker villain than from the previous movie, believe it or not.  If they showed more of his scary and macho ness, he would make for a less tamed villain, but he's not and it really makes his character kiddie appropriate. It's really disappointing because he seems pretty cool with the shark and the grenade but not after that short 5 minutes. Well after that short bad moments let's get on with the many good things with this film, which includes the  voice cast, animation, characters, minions, music, script,  switch of voice actors.  The voice cast is excellent! Steve Carrel truly knows what he's doing as Gru, and his voice acting is excellent! Kristen Wiig who was excellent in the first film as Mrs. Hattie, is back and bubbly as Lucy Wilde. She was excellent. Ken Jeung and Russell Brand are excellent too.  The big additions to the cast include Steve Coogan as Silas Ramsbottom, whose voice is  very convincing and excellent and finally the best of the newbie's and the second best of the cast behind Steve Carrel, is Benjamin Bratt as the  incredibly tame villain, Eduardo/El Macho.  Originally Al Pacino was cast as the voice of the character and had recorded all of his lines and animation for the character was already complete too, he stepped out because of creative differences on how the character should go.  I was upset at first due to being a fan of Pacino, and I still am, but I have got to say congratulations to Benjamin who was able to easily voice the character and his hard work as he had a week or two I believe too record his lines because the movie was going to be released in two months. Bratt did an excellent job as the character and I couldn't think of anyone who could have done it any better.  Top notch voice work from him.  The animation is excellent!  I loved the  animation done on the mall and characters; while cartoony it's excellent and sharp.  A beautifully film to watch, while he Monsters University film I felt had better animation this comes close to it! And better yet they used less money to create the excellent animation costing the most amount of money Illumination has ever spent on making an animated film which is 76-79 million that's not bad.  The characters are great! Lucy Wilde is funny and yet annoying at times a heartwarming character that I truly enjoyed watching. Floyd Eaggleson is also funny. The little wig making Chinese man is besides excellently voiced, is excellently funny and while his role is small, he is still one of my favorites.  I've already talked about the minions, but I think another word or too will do it. I think the minions are perfect; they are funny and my favorites.  The music is while not as memorable as the first films soundtrack is still excellent! You have to love the ""Despicable Me"" song.  I loved it! I was fairly disappointed that this film didn't include the song from the trailers, which played while Lucy kidnapped Gru.  But oh well you know, it's just to catch people attention.  The script includes loads of excellent dialogue that we get from El Macho and others.  A few clever one liners and things like that, some dialogue that mimics other things and stuff.  Now I already talked about this but I have decided that all of Benjamin Bratt's hard work deserves more recognizing and praise as he truly was excellent.  He worked hard to match the mouth movements for the animated character and matched it perfectly! An excellent cast member.  All an All Despicable Me 2, is not better than the first film and is more tame, and less enjoyable for adult audiences then the first film but still manages to  contain the magic with an excellent voice cast,  excellent colorful characters and those  loveably funny minions. B+P.S we will see in December 2014 a spin off featuring the Minions solely. I'm not interested but we'll see. Are too many minions, too much? We'll know in December 2014.  Expect another Despicable Me movie because of the excellent  box office performance as well.",4,Not better as first film but  still contains  an excellent voice cast and colorful characters and more

1563831,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B008JFUQ16,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","While not my favorite animated movie of all time, I did enjoy the first ""Despicable Me"" movie.  It was fun seeing a story from a more villainous character's point of view, and the film was just flat-out funny and even adorable.  But I was wary upon learning that a sequel was in the works -- too often movie sequels just can't live up to their predecessors.  And when I learned that the second movie would feature a female lead and possible love interest for Gru, I was even more skeptical.  Did we need a forced romantic subplot, and does every hero need to be paired up anymore?I'm happy to say that ""Despicable Me 2"" is just as good as the first film.  While not without its problems, it's still a fun and cute romp, and to my delight the female lead doesn't detract from the movie.""Despicable Me 2"" picks up where the first movie left off -- Gru has mostly abandoned his villainous ways and is devoting himself to being a father to Margo, Edith, and Agnes, the three orphans he adopted in the first movie, as well as start a jelly-making company.  His plans get derailed when the Anti-Villain League tracks him down, and he finds himself a reluctant recruit for their cause to track down whoever stole a dangerous serum that can turn creatures into psychotic monsters.  Along the way Gru teams up with Lucy Wilde, a goofy and spirited AVL agent with her own slew of funky gadgets.  While the girls try to nudge the two of them together and a pushy neighbor tries to get Gru to date, nastier things are underfoot -- Gru's minions are disappearing, and a former supervillain named El Macho may be resurfacing...The plot of this movie is a little choppy, and not as focused as the first film.  It tries to juggle multiple plots at once -- Gru and Lucy's developing relationship, the search for the missing serum, the missing minions, Margo falling for a boy, Dr. Nefario's retirement, etc.  It can make for a slightly confusing viewing experience, especially for young children.  But unlike the first film, which left several loose ends hanging, this one ties its multiple plots up fairly neatly at the end, which should satisfy older viewers.The animation in this film is stylized and slick, not quite up to Pixar or Dreamwork's standards but still very fun to look at.  It doesn't settle for a generic bland look for its human characters, and isn't afraid to show its characters warts and all.  Characters get large noses, huge chins, and other features that tend to be exaggerated for comic effect but somehow work with the film's style.My biggest worry about this film -- Lucy Wilde -- turned out to be unfounded.  Rather than being a brainless love interest or a stereotypical action girl, Lucy is her own character, and a good one to boot.  She can still kick butt and hold her own in a fight, but she's still something of a dork and has a goofy sense of humor.  After seeing so many ""strong action girls"" in movies who tend to all be the same generic ""stoic badass with a troubled past"" types, it's nice and refreshing to see one that actually has a personality beyond that.The returning characters continue to be a delightful bunch as well.  Gru, despite being mostly reformed, is still something of a snarker, and keeps his death traps and tendency to be jerkish despite being the hero this time around.  Dr. Nefario longs for the good old days when they were wicked, but still proves to be a decent guy.  The girls remain cute with a bit of a cynical/ghoulish streak, and the minions are hilarious as always.  The new characters seem to be mostly stereotypes, sadly -- El Macho is especially embarrassing if you're Hispanic -- but Lucy's presence mostly makes up for this.While not as brilliant as ""Frozen,"" ""Despicable Me 2"" is still a fun and adorable movie, great for all ages (though very young children might be frightened by a few scenes).

There are some very sweet moments in the movie when former bad guy is tucking in his daughters...the moments that really tug at a parent's heart.

Directors Pierre Coffin (Despicable Me, Minions) and Chris Renaud (Despicable Me, The Lorax) did a wonderful job of keeping a strong family based story and more than relatable characters at the forefront of the film. Ken Daurio (Despicable Me The Lorax) and Cinco Paul (Despicable Me, The Lorax) also came back as the original writers to write this really heartfelt screenplay where the story is a about a new father, his ambition to contribute to society and an unexpected twist, how he, the once evil genius of the world, could ever love or be loved.Gru is reprised by amazing Stave Carrell (The Office, 40 Year Old Virgin) again and is recruited by the Ant-Villain League (AVL) to help thwart the new mysterious criminal mastermind trying to take over the world. Kristin Wiig (Bridesmaids, How To train Your Dragon) plays Lucy who is the AVL's leading agent chosen to recruit Gru into their cause. What ensues is nothing short of two fishes out of water who are completly opposites of each other learning that they actually complement each other more then they disagree with each other. Their humor is abundant and their relationships, for an animated feature, is truly genuine.Now I can't forget the wonderful performances of the three children Gru has adopted from the first film. Elsie Kate Fisher (Raising Hope, Mike & Molly) plays Agnes, the adorable, curious, extremely sharp and most direct 5 year old you'll ever meet. Her older sisters Edith played by Dana Gainer (30 Rock, Home Makeover) and Margo played by Miranda Cosgrove (The Good Wife, iCarly) seems to be great supportive sisters and surprise, Margo being the oldest, begins to notice boys. Added with everything else, Gru has his hands full, non-stop, throughout the film!Gru's number one assistant is back voiced cleverly by Russell Brand (Get Him To The Greek, Arthur) and he has another agenda that also confuses Gru into doing what is right. Now let's add some villains - or some you think are good guys - wink, wink - Benjamin Bratt (Miss Congeniality, Law & Order) plays Eduardo (and his alias) with such witty dialogue in his Mexican accent, you'll be swooned into his charms as well. Steve Coogan (Around The World In 8- Days, Tropic Thunder) plays the head of the AVL and gives Gru more than enough reasons to help them out although the Minions seem to make fun of him all the time.Now I am saving the best for last. The Minions are back! Wow, they are funny, clever, dumb-witted, strange, hysterical, bizarre and I could not see a movie without them right next to Gru at his side (top, bottom, left, right, etc.). You'll laugh at their quirkiness and be charmed by their dedication to their boss and his kids. There are hundreds of them this time and they all have their own personalities, specialties and quirks that will make you smile every time one is on screen. Oh, don't leave at the end of the movie during the credits, they have more to offer - keep watching (if you like to laugh that is)!Just a pure fun family film and quite a treat to know the sequel is just as good and in some place better, than the original. The adults will have fun with this one and Gru, the girls and the Minions will keep the kids rolling in their seats.

We put the blu-ray in the PS3 to watch it and were highly disappointed to find out that the blu-ray didn't work. We switched it out with the DVD and enjoyed the movie. Two days later I took back the set and they replaced the movie for us. Came home to find that they blu-ray started just fine; however the next day we had the same problem as we did with the first blu-ray. I did some research online to see if anyone else was having this issue. Three days later people had started posting about the problem. Apparently, there are new blu-ray discs that have an issue being read in the PS3 (Fast & Furious 6 being another one). Someone suggested a work around to the problem so we tried it and it worked: When you put your blu-ray in and start it, you need to tell it no when it asks if you want to connect to the internet. (If your system is already set-up to auto-confirm turning on the internet you will need to go to the blu-ray internet settings on your PS3 and change it so you have to verify it, then each time you watch a blu-ray disk you will have the option to disable the internet or not). I really hope that this is helpful to someone else since it was highly frustrating for us to not be able to play our movie.",4,Funny movie for the whole family,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,1642,"['husband', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'right', 'along', 'children', 'age', '4yrs', 'age', '20', 'months', 'storyline', 'cute', 'think', 'what', 'most', 'fun', 'already', 'love', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'met', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'kids', 'interact', 'movie', 'children', 'LOVE', 'soundtrack', 'movie.Gramma', 'bought', 'movie', 'kids', 'Walmart', 'put', 'blu-ray', 'PS3', 'watch', 'were', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'find', 'out', 'blu-ray', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'switched', 'out', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Two', 'days', 'later', 'took', 'back', 'set', 'replaced', 'movie', 'Came', 'home', 'find', 'blu-ray', 'started', 'just', 'fine', 'however', 'next', 'day', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'did', 'first', 'blu-ray', 'did', 'research', 'online', 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'having', 'issue', 'Three', 'days', 'later', 'people', 'had', 'started', 'posting', 'problem', 'Apparently', 'are', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'discs', 'have', 'issue', 'being', 'read', 'PS3', 'Fast', 'Furious', '6', 'being', 'one', 'Someone', 'suggested', 'work', 'around', 'problem', 'tried', 'worked', 'When', 'put', 'blu-ray', 'start', 'need', 'tell', 'when', 'want', 'connect', 'internet', 'system', 'already', 'set-up', 'auto-confirm', 'turning', 'internet', 'will', 'need', 'go', 'blu-ray', 'internet', 'settings', 'PS3', 'change', 'so', 'have', 'verify', 'then', 'time', 'watch', 'blu-ray', 'disk', 'will', 'have', 'option', 'disable', 'internet', 'not', 'really', 'hope', 'helpful', 'someone', 'else', 'was', 'highly', 'frustrating', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'movie']",N/A

1563889,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B008JFUQ16,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[205, 243]","I loved this movie and both my daughters loved it even more. It is AS GOOD as the first part, therefore this review follows the main lines of my review of the first ""Despicable me"". This review contains very limited SPOILERS.1. Hilarity - Exactly as the first film, this sequel is HILARIOUS! There is hardly any 15 seconds in this movie that would not contain a really good gag, children or/and adult oriented. Whoever wrote the scenario was a genius!2. Despicability - in this film Gru is a little bit different from what he was in the first part. He is no more so grumpy, mean, petty and permanently aggravated - he certainly smiles more and all his attitude softened. He remains however exactly as insecure as in the first film. That being said, there are moments in this film when the old Gru resurfaces, when his heart is broken or when somebody REALLY upsets him. His geriatric sidekick and only friend (well, kind of) doctor Nefario didn't take all this change easily and he has some trouble to adapt his evil laboratory to new tasks of producing jam and jelly... Gru's murderous (and toxic) dog/rat/wolverine/skunk like pet on another hand felt completely under the spell of the girls - but still gives a great show! The two ""bad guys"" are also excellent - which is a real achievement, considering that one of them belongs to species usually not associated with evil villainy...)))3. Girl power - as in the previous film, I believe that any parent of little girls will fall immediately in love with Margo, Edith and Agnes, the three little orphaned sisters Gru adopted in the first part. Those seemingly defenseless creatures took him since under the sweet and soft but in the same time surprisingly totalitarian control little girls exercise over their fathers, adoptive or not...))) Agnes, the youngest of the three (I think she is 5) is still particularly sweet - if only she was real I would adopt her on the spot and spoil her silly all the rest of my life! Tomboyish Edith, aged around 8, still wears permanently her pink hat which seems to comfort her, but as you will see, she certainly recovered from her previous traumas...))) Margo, the oldest one, is now a young teenager (she is about 13 I think) and starts already to think about boys, something which TERMINALLY freaks Gru out - and I can relate here! Honest, if you already are a parent of a little girl, you WILL LOVE this movie. And if you do not have yet a young daughter, get one!4. As in previous film, as far as reasons to watch this movie go, even the girls must cede the first place to the minions! The totally devoted, fearless and highly professional and in the same time impossibly immature and conflicted army of Gru minions is THE greatest treasure of this movie. In this film there is even more minions and believe me - they pack incredible fun! I am very impatient to see their own film (which I believe will be released in 2014).5. Agent Lucy Wilde, a young rising star in the Anti Villain League, is a new element and a new delight added to this film and her character is a great success. Well trained in martial arts and using some extremely cool gadgets, she is also a mixture of perfect lady and a tomboyish, contagiously enthusiastic adventurer, still lacking a little bit of experience and therefore prone to attack first and ask questions later...))) And she is also cute, which certainly doesn't hurt.I purposefully omitted in this review some of the characters and did not hint at most of the gags and scenes, to avoid big spoilers and keep things short.To conclude, this is a TREASURE OF A MOVIE. A thing to see in cinema, then buy on DVD, watch, keep and re-watch on regular basis. And I ABSOLUTELY hope for A SECOND SEQUEL!PS.

This sequel holds up better than typical sequels of other films, thanks to crisp animation and good voice acting.

Overall, if you liked the first movie, the second one shouldn't disappoint.The extra short-films (three of them) are definitely short, but fun. It's nice they they gave these three new directors their chance to create a short using cherished characters from the movies. All three are fun, if not predictable, but you just can't turn away when minions are doing their simple things.We only watched the blu-ray disc and it was sonically fantastic in surround.

1563927,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B008JFUQ16,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[18, 31]","""Despicable Me"" was about fatherhood, in which archvillain Gru (Steve Carell) discovers there's more to life than stealing the moon, like adopting three adorable moppets: eldest Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) who is just discovering boys,  ninja-in-training Edith (Dana Gaier) and unicorn-obsessed Agnes (Elsie Fisher). ""Despicable Me 2"" is about Gru completing the standard family unit by finding a mate. This is an entertaining sequel that fails to surpass the original, at least due in part to this single plot point -- the villains, the gadgets, and the minions are all ancillary to the object of Gru's romance, Anti-Villain League (AVL) agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).Lucy's the best thing about the film.  The animators have captured every comic tic of Wiig, who infuses Lucy with a manic competence.  Where Gru is an outdated villain who hasn't kept up with the times, Lucy is a product of a new era of empowered women who kicks open doors in heels and a skirt. This is embodied by their first encounter (played repeatedly in the trailers) where Gru loudly announces his intention to attack (""Freeze ray!"") his presumed foe by whipping out a clunky weapon; in response, Lucy pulls out a lipstick Taser and easily incapacitates Gru and then announces with a flourish: ""LIPSTICK TASER!""Lucy recruits Gru into the AVL to stop a villain who has stolen mutagen PX-41, which turns living things into purple killing machines. He's hiding out in the Paradise Mall, so it's up to Gru and Lucy to go undercover as partners at an ice cream shop to catch the villain and find the mutagen.  The plot is surprisingly similar to ""Chuck.""The first twenty minutes --- where Lucy recruits Gru into the AVL, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) quits for another employer, the girls work to bring Lucy and Gru together, and the minions go missing -- are the best part. The minions are actually integral to the plot here in a way that's not entirely kid-friendly, and though ""Despicable Me 2"" works hard to defang them, the film makes it clear that monsters infected by the mutagen will eat little girls.That's ""Despicable Me 2""'s main flaw, and it's a big one.  The bad guy, a has-been coming out of retirement, doesn't seem well-suited to the villainous plan.  The surprise twist as to Dr. Nefario's employer isn't a twist at all, and the entire film pivots on his change of heart.SPOILER ME TOO: Or to put it another way, neither Lucy nor Gru actually does anything of substance here, it's all Dr. Nefario, who apparently didn't understand that making purple monsters that will eat the world means it will eat ""his family"" too. If anything, Nefario should have more affection for the minions than for the girls, as his relationship with the girls is never developed on screen between both films.  More galling is that super-competent Lucy is relegated to a damsel in distress, capable of taking on Gru but ushered off screen onto a rocket without even throwing a punch.Kids won't care about this of course.  ""Despicable Me 2""'s formula has always been adult themes hidden behind a teeming mass of yellow minions to keep the kiddies entertained, and they are in full force here.

My sister (her mom) asked if she should see it, and I think that there is indeed one part that she might be afraid of (big purple monster). But that's only because it looked like one of the monsters from Monsters, Inc., which Evan got scared of. But, there was a 2 1/2 y.o. boy who loved the movie who also loved Monsters, Inc. So to each kid there own. I'd probably see this again on the cable or something. Sis is still debating if she wants to take Evan because that girl looovvvveessss the Minions. I think she'll like the Minion movie more probably.Funny thing is that our theater was having problems with the sound and stopped the movie in the middle of the show. The theater staff explained the pause - but no one seemed to understand what the problem was. Turned out there was a heart beat sound throughout the movie.

1563978,A84FLVDK2R5JF,B008JFUQ16,"Nathan M. Rose ""Movie Guy from FlickDirect""","[1, 2]","That 2010&#8217;s &#8220;Despicable Me&#8221; turned out to be an enormous hit is a bit of a surprise. Perfectly pleasant but also unremarkable, the feature scratched a certain audience itch at the time, striking a distinct cartoon blow while introducing the world to the hyperactive comedy antics of the minions -- those miniature yellow slapstick machines that eventually made Universal Pictures a mint in merchandise sales. Well, the minions are back, along with Gru and his adoptive children, with &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; perfectly content to replicate humor and spectacle for its adoring audience. However, with the lead character now playing for the good guys, certain changes have been made to the freshly-minted franchise, a few ideas that keep this sequel entertaining but never remarkable.Now a domesticated man living with his three daughters, Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher), former supervillian Gru (Steve Carell) is content to be a dad, organizing birthday parties and perfecting a line of jellies and jams with help from his loyal minions and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand). When a secret serum containing the power to make monsters out of anyone is stolen from a lab, the Anti-Villain League requests Gru&#8217;s help with retrieval, paring up the hopelessly single man with Lucy (Kristen Wiig), a flighty but fierce agent. Sent undercover into a mall to spy on dubious shopkeepers who might be hiding the serum, Gru and Lucy bond over their shared love of gadgets and interest in the evildoing of others. Their top suspect is Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt), a Mexican restaurateur who reminds Gru of El Macho, a once potent bad guy bent on destruction. As minions are pinched, Margo falls in love with Eduardo&#8217;s son Antonio (Moises Arias), and Dr. Nefario quits the fruit preserve game, Gru is left to save the world, which isn&#8217;t nearly as frightening as being honest with his feelings for Lucy.Inoffensive yet undercooked, &#8220;Despicable Me&#8221; took its time revealing a personality and storytelling drive, though its interest in CG-animated silly business was refreshing, rarely halting the antics to adhere to emotional bullet points the competition is often slavish to. The sequel continues the misadventures of Gru, who&#8217;s now a family man seen dressing up as a fairy princess for Agnes&#8217;s delight, also turning his cavernous lair into a food factory with hopes to erase his supervillain past for good, much to the concern of Dr. Nefario, who&#8217;s looking for more of a challenge. The next logical step for Gru&#8217;s dramatic progression is one of heroism, and the opportunity arrives with the Anti-Villain League invitation, offering the once malevolent man a shot as toppling evil for a change, which happens to be housed in a domed mall filled with cutesy shop names and lively tenants. Suddenly, Gru&#8217;s a secret agent, with Lucy his partner and a few minions along for support. &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; doesn&#8217;t cough up a radical plot, but it&#8217;s passable, making distinct moves to inch away from the original&#8217;s satiric narrative interests.The mall subplot is a letdown, with the script initially promising an expansive space teeming with suspicious types, allowing Gru and Lucy to pore through tenant behavior. Instead of many, we meet two: Eduardo and wigmaker Floyd (Ken Jeong), and it&#8217;s clear from the outset who&#8217;s the actual guilty party. Even for a family film, the mystery isn&#8217;t very mysterious, a deflating realization that keeps &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; from trouncing its predecessor in the tomfoolery department, missing a chance to expand the suspect list and widen the potential for humor. However, actual jokes aren&#8217;t exactly a priority for directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, who stuff the effort with bathroom humor, including the use of a &#8220;fart gun&#8221; to score cheap laughs. &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; is rarely laugh out loud funny, but neither was the original, always falling frustratingly short of a rollicking good time.Welcome here are the voice actors, who once again topple expectations for lazy reads by delivering oddball characters and flighty emphasis. Carell is wonderful as Gru, managing his habitual silliness through the glue of a thick accent, which often accentuates the hilarity of his groans and growls. Wiig is a terrific addition to the cast (she actually had a small role in the original picture), matching her co-star with her own spastic behaviors, gifted some vocal honey to balance out the cartoon push of Carell&#8217;s characterization. The film&#8217;s best scenes feature Gru and Lucy&#8217;s developing attraction, with rubbery animation keeping up with the inspired performances, creating a likable pair that naturally feeds into the sequel&#8217;s obsession with the ex-supervillain&#8217;s disastrous love life.&#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; also sees the return of the popular minions, who blast the screen with gibberish and pratfalls, giggling at fart noises and serve up obscure pop culture references (because kids today can&#8217;t get enough Carmen Miranda and &#8220;Love Boat&#8221; jokes?). They even participate in a few musical numbers to make themselves useful. With their own movie on the way for 2014, it seems strange for &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; to be so minion-minded, but it&#8217;s hard to discount the popularity of the squealing creatures, who once again light up the screen with their goggle-eyed wackiness.Visually &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; does more than what the film itself can offer with an AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 2.40:1. A powerful blend of colors assault the senses here, as there is no contrast noise and very little breakdown. Blacks are deep and rich, while brighter colors practically sparkle on the screen. And with an incredibly forceful DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix to announce itself, you barely feel like you&#8217;re sitting at home while watching a DVD instead of at the theater. While it&#8217;s no big screen blockbuster, &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; does well for what it offers. No source noise and solid punch from the rear speakers make you feel every ray gun blast and child&#8217;s giggle.There&#8217;s more than just a missing serum for Gru to combat in &#8220;Despicable Me 2.&#8221; With Margo going boy crazy, he&#8217;s also put into a particularly painful parenthood position, developing the domestic interests of the script. However, big action eventually takes over in the final act, with furious jelly-gun combat supplying visual invention and a refreshing scale to the adventure, inching the sequel past the original in terms of eye candy and climactic creativity. It&#8217;s not much of an improvement, but &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; capably delivers the goods with minimal strain. A solid visual and audio presentation on Blu-ray with some fun special features make for a decent package and certainly worthy entertainment for the kids this holiday season.",4,&#8220;Despicable Me

In Despicable Me 2, Gru, now a devoted dad, has reformed and is attempting to start a legitimate business. He's turned his lab into a high-tech kitchen for making jellies and jams. Too bad nobody, including the Minions, likes the stuff they're making. His longtime sidekick, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), grows restless--as restless as a hard-of-hearing geezer mad scientist can possibly be--and decides to leave Gru's lab and go back to evildoing with another supervillain. Gru reluctantly says goodbye to his soon-to-be-former accomplice and the Minions give Nefario a twenty-one fart gun salute (yep,I said fart gun--it wasn't a typo).When the Minions start to disappear, Gru doesn't notice--at first. He's busy deflecting the matchmaking attempts of an annoying neighbor and his own daughters. The youngest, Agnes, struggles with her role in a Mothers Day pageant at her school, feeling the lack of a mother of her own. Gru is also concerned that eldest daughter Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), now a teenager, has discovered boys.Enter Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig, who provided the voice of snarky orphanage director Miss Hattie in the original film), an agent for the Anti-Villains League, who kidnaps Gru and Minions Stuart and Dave and takes them to AVL headquarters, where AVL Director Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) tries to recruit Gru to help find a supervillain who possesses a dangerous formula that turns anyone injected with it into an unstoppable purple killing machine. He and Lucy end up partners, but at first they can't get along, and every attempt they make to find the supervillain ends badly...starting with a restaurant break-in, during which they run afoul of a chicken (sorry, I couldn't resist).When little Agnes declares that Gru loves Lucy, Gru not only denies it, he insists he doesn't even like Lucy. Typical male...denying his feelings right up to the moment he says ""I do!""The AVL thinks they've found their man when wigmaker Floyd (Ken Jeong) is arrested. Gru is dismissed in spite of his insistence that restaurateur Eduardo (voiced by Benjamin Bratt) is the real culprit...and with Nefario's help is turning the Minions into monsters. By the time his suspicions are proven correct, Lucy is on a flight to Australia and her next assignment.Will Lucy return? Does Nefario's conscience get the better of him? Do Gru and Lucy have a future together? Will Margo, Edith and Agnes finally get a mom? And what of the Minions?

1564005,AHF97M45JFCB,B008JFUQ16,ONENEO,"[20, 25]","The summer of 2013 will likely be remembered as a period of sequels for the computer generated animated feature film segment.  Sure there are some original pieces sliding into the fray (Epic & Turbo for example) but the lion's share of the media attention falls squarely on Pixar's Monsters University, Universal Pictures'/ Illumination's Despicable Me 2 and already the trailers are beginning to circulate for Disney's third entry into the Cars universe: Planes.Depending on who you are, the animated sequel thing can work- look at the Toy Stories and Shreks, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascars, and so on.  That said, it didn't come as too much of a surprise when rumors started circulating a couple of years back that 2010's surprise breakaway hit about a villain turned good guy would be getting a direct sequel as well as a spin-off film featuring the minions a year after that.That brings us to the sequel itself- Despicable Me 2 does away with fancy tag lines and usual sequel fluffery and drops its viewer quickly into a brief reprise of Gru's life as a former supervillain turned domestic daddy caring for three orphan girls.  This time around we learn that his vast resources, technology and manpower (or Minion power as the case may be) are devoted to the business of producing a line of jellies and jams.It doesn't take long for Gru's simple life of parenthood/ Smuckers wannabeism to come to a halt when Lucy Wilde, an agent representing the Anti-Villain League (AVL) abducts the baldheaded mastermind and takes him to a top secret meeting to plead for his assistance in solving a caper involving the disappearance of an Arctic laboratory responsible for the chemical agent PX-41.  PX-41 is dangerous because of its ability to transform mammals injected with it into indestructible purple, wild-haired killing machines.Intel leads the search into a local mall of all places, where a storeowner is suspected of harboring the precious chemical.  Posing as operators of a food court bakery, Gru and Lucy are assigned the task of figuring out who is behind the lab's disappearance before they have an opportunity to unleash the dreaded PX-41 on the world.Sure it isn't much of an extraordinarily rich plot, but it is serviceable enough to set up some genuinely funny moments and visually rich action sequences.  It's all but impossible not to find enjoyment in Steve Carell's zany delivery as Gru; especially with a script that seems to hone in perfectly on all of the nuances that make the character tick.Love em or loathe em, the yellow gibberish-spewing Minions are back with a vengeance and lend some comical moments in a variety of disciplines from light potty humor to all out slap stick to complex visual gags the likes of which wouldn't be uncommon in an old Loony Tunes episode.  There is little doubt Illumination realizes they have struck a chord in the world's collective psyche with these guys and plan to milk the gimmick for all its worth.Fortunately even the Minion overload doesn't take much away from the overall entertainment value of the experience- the fact of the matter is there is something to laugh with, about or at going on in nearly every single scene of the film.  Some of the gags are more in-your-face than others of course (which is sort expected in a piece that targets everyone from young children to the most cynical of adults) but certainly multiple viewings reveal layers of comedic charm one would expect from studios as refined and experienced as say Pixar or DreamWorks.Perhaps the most notable element of the viewing experience comes from a quality that's difficult to pinpoint but unmistakable just the same: the film resonates with the same goofy, almost sublime charm that made the first one so successful.  Unlike something from Pixar that would try to awe you with cleverness or say DreamWorks where each sequence feels like it was refined a million times over in boardroom, Despicable Me 2 never feels like it's working too hard to woo its viewer.  The vivid, unbelievably rich visuals make it nearly impossible to look away while the characters simply do what they do.  In the end you find yourself laughing at Gru's dialog, the Minions' antics, Dr. Nefario's combination of brilliance and geriatrics, a new ""very macho"" villain, the unique gadgets (after all, what other movie can boast containing a 21 fart-gun salute?) or some combination of the above.In the event that you haven't been keeping up on such things, Illumination Entertainment has been the modern day incarnation of the King Midas myth.  Beginning with the first Despicable Me and extending through Dr. Suess' The Lorax and now with this sequel that in under a week has managed to bring in more than quadruple it's $76-million dollar budget, it can truly be said everything these guys touch has turned to gold.  Well not really gold so much as yellow- with goggles and blue suspenders.",4,Despicably Entertaining in the Summer of Animated Sequels,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,4901,"['summer', '2013', 'will',

1564047,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B008JFUQ16,Ranny Levy,"[5, 8]","I think this film is a very cute sequel to ""Despicable Me"" and good news, the minions are in it even more. The 3D animation is wonderful in this movie and the designs and colors are very fun visually. I can tell the creators of this film paid attention to what audiences enjoyed most out of the first movie and that is what influenced a lot of ""Despicable Me 2."" I think all of the voice actors suited their characters perfectly. This film brings back the familiar voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Steve Carell and Russell Brand, while also adding in newer characters such as Lucy voiced by Kristen Wiig, Antonio voiced by Moises Arias and many others.My favorite character is actually all of the minions. I loved them all so much in the first ""Despicable Me"" and I think it was a great decision to include them for in the sequel. Their banter is so funny, even though I can't understand their gibberish, their motions tell the story of what they're trying to communicate. I think the way they work together and fight is very comical and all of their interactions are very funny. The minions really are the perfect side kicks to Gru since he is so wacky.My favorite scene would probably be when Gru finds out that Margo is on a date. He freaks out so much and goes running around the mall trying to stop the two of them from being alone. It's really funny and although it is a bit over exaggerated, it still shows what all fathers go through when their daughters start showing an interest in dating. I also think it's funny how Margo's sisters react to her new romantic interests. Edith, being a total tomboy, thinks that it is disgusting for her sister to go on a date with a boy. Agnes on the other handthinks it's the cutest thing and immediately starts saying that they are in love, which only worries Gru even more. The entire scene is filled with very funny, memorable dialog and interactions between the main characters and is definitely a scene that stands out for me.I recommend this film for ages 6+ and anyone who enjoyed ""Despicable Me"" will absolutely love ""Despicable Me 2."" I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has the perfect mix of humor for children and adults so it makes for an  enjoyable experience for all.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D.

Luckily, all my fears were put to rest, since I found a movie that is funny, has a bunch of other elements incorporated in the story, and leaves you feeling good. In the first movie, the conversion of Gru from villain to good guy was the focus of the plot. The challenge now was to determine how to carry the story forward.I have to give high marks for the ideas used to create the plot in this one. Gru is dealing with going from being a villain to making jelly and jam. In this setting, a villain is developing some scary threats and he is offered an opportunity to help the good guys. When you add elements of romance to this story, and some fascinating characters, the stage is set for a truly fun film.There are other aspects that make this movie great. I loved the fact that the minions get a more prominent role here. These guys are fantastic! The addition of Lucy, an employee of the anti-villain league that rocks Gru's world, is a welcome one. Kristen Wiig does an outstanding job with the voice acting, matching up well with the great Steve Carell.Overall this is an enjoyable movie for the whole family.

1564141,A26MJME9IBNETY,B008JFUQ16,StrangePegs,"[3, 4]","2010 was a great year for animated movies: Toy Story 3 (which made me cry), Despicable Me (which made my wife cry (which is not to say that TS3 didn't make her cry, but it's much more impressive to make me cry at a movie than her)), and Megamind. So, although we really loved Despicable Me when we saw, it still got overshadowed by the other two. Meaning we own the other two, but I never bought Despicable Me despite the incredible voice work by Steve Carell. I feel bad about that, now.Which may seem kind of silly, to feel bad about not buying a DVD, but, really, we all, the whole family, loved Despicable Me. When it came out. But, see, the news of Despicable Me 2 didn't really do that much for me. It was kind of a shrug and ""oh, yeah, that's cool,"" but I wasn't dying to go see it or anything. I'm sure that's because we haven't watched it again since 2010, and I'd forgotten how good it was. My daughter, however, was dying to go see it. I'm pretty sure she wants minions of her own.So we went to see Despicable Me 2, and I'm pretty sure it's the best movie I've seen all summer. Okay, second best. Star Trek beats it but not by much. At any rate, it was so much better than Monsters University, which is its actual competition. Not only was Despicable more funny than Monsters, but it had all of the heart and soul that Monsters was lacking. And it made my wife cry.I don't actually have anything negative to say about the movie. The closest thing to a negative is that the plot is almost conventional, but, see, it's only almost conventional. The fact that there is an attempt to recruit Gru to the AVL (Anti-Villain League) at the beginning of the movie, because of his expertise as a former villain, puts things just off-kilter enough that you don't really know which direction the movie is going. And I won't tell you which, because that would just spoil it.And, I have to say, that scene where Gru is on the phone with the people who failed to send the Fairy Godmother to his adopted daughter's birthday party... well, that was classic. As a father, I've made those calls, and they had that bit down perfectly. All the way to the hanging up and... well, that, also, would be telling. But there are so many of  those moments incorporated into the movie that it made it great for kids and adults.The animation was terrific. The voice work from the actors was excellent. The minions were funnier then ever.Wait, now that I think about it, there is one issue with the movie. The title. Because Gru isn't so despicable anymore. I can't wait for a third one, and I'm gonna go have to make sure I pick up both of these movies, now.

Not that he has become dull or unfunny after his retirement. It is just that he has become, well, ordinary. Fortunately, the film itself is very entertaining thanks largely to the yellow-colored creatures Minions.Gru, who was like a cross between Mr. Bean and Dr. Evil in the original, still looks the same, but he is now a (basically) nice person and caring father of three daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes. A new adventure begins when Gru meets Lucy Wilde, an agent sent from a secret organization called Anti-Villain League or AVL.About half of the film follows their joint investigation into the case of a stolen chemical PX-41, substance that changes living things into purple people-eaters, and the romantic relationship between the ex-supervillian and an active-duty AVL operative. The idea is fine, though Gru of the sequel is rather a different person, more likable but less interesting than in the original.In spite of the weak storyline, however, the sequel works because of the horde of Minions and their funny antics, as well as the unique and colorful designs of animation.

Unfortunately, their bunny-based follow-up Hop (2011) was riddled with myxomatosis, whilst the environmentally-conscious The Lorax (2012) was an ecological disaster as far as critics were concerned. Thankfully, Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's Despicable Me 2 (2013) is a slick, inventive and thoroughly entertaining slice of animated nonsense that will enthral kids, amuse adults and rule at the box office.This time round, not-so-evil supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) is officially retired and spends his days caring for his beloved adopted kids and experimenting with jam recipes (naturally). His peaceful existence is shattered, however, when he is recruited by future love interest Lucy Wilde (Kirsten Wiig) and spy master Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) to join the infamous Anti-Villain League and track down the ringleader behind the heist of a mysterious serum. Gru's number one suspect is restaurant owner Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt), a dead ringer for his former partner in crime El Macho who was last seen riding a shark strapped with dynamite (how &agrave; la mode) into the gaping chasm of a volcano twenty years previously.Gru is one of the highlights of Carell's somewhat patchy career thus far, and although he's still very much the main character here, he's again outshone by his little yellow minions -who must be the stuff of merchandisers dreams. They are given a much more prominent role in the sequel, and whether it's their pastiche of Charles Ebbet's famous 'Lunch atop a Skyscraper' photograph or the inevitable Alien (1979) parody, practically every time they're on screen they inspire laughter. Wiig is fine as Wilde, though she does seems to be channelling Jennifer Aniston, whilst Bratt's Eduardo (who was to be voiced by Al Pacino) is a fun, if not very villainous villain.There is a ten-minute lull midway through this feisty sequel and the necessity of the film's 3D conversion is as debatable as ever (though the patented short minion film over the end credits remains impressive and proves that three dimensions can sometimes be better than two). Yet, despite a few dropped balls, Despicable Me 2 is silly but superlative family entertainment. With enough sugar in your system and an open mind, there's plenty on offer for both young and old.",3,Not a bad children's flick,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,2472,"['Despicable', 'Me', '2010', 'was', 'first', 'offering', 'Universal', 'Pictures', 'off-shoot', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'financial', 'success', 'proved', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'can', 'be', 'beaten', 'own', 'game', 'Unfortunately', 'bunny-based', 'follow-up', 'Hop', '2011', 'was', 'riddled', 'myxomatosis', 'whilst', 'environmentally-conscious', 'Lorax', '2012', 'was', 'ecological', 'disaster', 'as', 'far', 'critics', 'were', 'concerned', 'Thankfully', 'Pierre', 'Coffin', 'Chris', 'Renaud', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', '2013', 'slick', 'inventive', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'slice', 'animated', 'nonsense', 'will', 'enthral', 'kids', 'amuse', 'adults', 'rule', 'box', 'office.This', 'time', 'round', 'not-so-evil', 'supervillain', 'Gru', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'officially', 'retired', 'days', 'caring', 'beloved', 'adopted', 'kids', 'experimenting', 'jam', 'recipes', 'naturally', 'peaceful', 'existence', 'shattered', 'however', 'when', 'recruited', 'future', 'love', 'interest', 'Lucy', 'Wilde', 'Kirsten', 'Wiig', 'spy', 'master', 'Silas', 'Ramsbottom', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'join', 'infamous', 'Anti-Villain', 'League', 'track', 'down', 'ringleader', 'heist', 'mysterious', 'serum', 'Gru', 'number', 'one', 'suspect', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Eduardo', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'dead', 'ringer', 'former', 'partner', 'crime', 'El', 'Macho', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'riding', 'shark', 'strapped', 'dynamite', 'how', 'agrave', 'mode', 'gaping', 'chasm', 'volcano', 'twenty', 'years', 'one', 'highlights', 'Carell', 'somewhat', 'patchy', 'career', 'thus', 'far', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'again', 'outshone', 'little', 'yellow', 'minions', '-who', 'must', 'be', 'stuff', 'merchandisers', 'dreams', 'are', 'given', 'much', 'more', 'prominent', 'role', 'sequel', 'pastiche', 'Charles', 'Ebbet', 'famous', ""'Lunch"", 'Skyscraper', 'photograph', 'inevitable', 'Alien', '1979', 'parody', 'practically', 'time', ""'re"", 'screen', 'inspire', 'laughter', 'Wiig', 'fine', 'Wilde', 'be', 'channelling', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'whilst', 'Bratt', 'Eduardo', 'who', 'was', 'be', 'voiced', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'fun', 'not', 'very', 'villainous', 'villain.There', 'ten-minute', 'lull', 'midway', 'feisty', 'sequel', 'necessity', 'film', '3D', 'conversion', 'as', 'debatable', 'ever', 'patented', 'short', 'minion', 'film', 'end', 'credits', 'impressive', 'three', 'dimensions', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'better', 'two', 'few', 'dropped', 'balls', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'silly', 'superlative', 'family', 'entertainment', 'enough', 'sugar', 'system', 'open', 'mind', 'plenty', 'offer', 'young', 'old']",N/A

1564226,AP3B615GM191G,B008JFUQ16,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[14, 18]","The first ""Despicable Me"" effort introduced audiences to the goofy, rambunctious Minions as well as the relationship between villain-turned-good guy Gru and his three little girls.  The second movie plays to those same strengths and offers more Minion mayhem and more heartfelt moments.For a basic plot summary, ""Despicable Me 2"" sees Gru (voice of Steve Carell) recruited by secret agent Lucy (Kristin Wiig) to join the newly-formed Anti-Villain league.  Though at first nonplussed by the offer and content to be just ""Dad"" to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and sweet little Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher), Gru begins to feel the tug of adventure once again (as well as perhaps a bit of a romantic fling as well?!) and is quickly caught up in the world-saving game again.In terms of comedy and adventure, this movie provides it in spades!  It's amazing that it took this many years of human history to think up such hilarious characters as Minions, as they can make even the most sourpuss among us crack a smile (and have most of us rolling in the aisles!).  Their crazy antics are unrivaled in the history of animated feature films.There is also a nice little touch of emotion in the movie involving Gru finding a partner (or mother, as asked for by Agnes).  I actually wish the movie would have focused on this movie, as a more developed and focused emotional aspect could have easily vaulted it to five-star status.Overall, though, ""Despicable Me 2"" is fine comedic fare for anyone who enjoyed the original.  The girls might touch you, the Minions will have you laughing throughout, and Carell's Gru is such a crazy character that he is a joy to watch.  A fun film for the entire family.",4,Silly Fun (With A Little Emotion Thrown In),1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,1701,"['first', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'effort', 'introduced', 'audiences', 'goofy', 'rambunctious', 'Minions', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'villain-turned-good', 'guy', 'Gru', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'second', 'movie', 'plays', 'same', 'strengths', 'more', 'Minion', 'mayhem', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'moments.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'sees', 'Gru', 'voice', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'recruited', 'secret', 'agent', 'Lucy', 'Kristin', 'Wiig', 'join', 'newly-formed', 'Anti-Villain', 'league', 'Though', 'first', 'nonplussed', 'offer', 'content', 'be', 'just', 'Dad', 'Margo', 'Miranda', 'Cosgrove', 'Edith', 'Dana', 'Gaier', 'sweet', 'little', 'Agnes', 'Elsie', 'Kate', 'Fisher', 'Gru', 'feel', 'tug', 'adventure', 'once', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'romantic', 'fling', 'as', 'well', 'quickly', 'caught', 'up', 'world-saving', 'game', 'again.In', 'terms', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'movie', 'spades', 'amazing', 'took', 'many', 'years', 'human', 'history', 'think', 'up', 'such', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'Minions', 'can', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'sourpuss', 'crack', 'smile', 'have', 'most', 'rolling', 'aisles', 'crazy', 'antics', 'are', 'unrivaled', 'history', 'animated', 'feature', 'also', 'nice', 'little', 'touch', 'emotion', 'movie', 'involving', 'Gru', 'finding', 'partner', 'mother', 'asked', 'Agnes', 'actually', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'focused', 'movie', 'more', 'developed', 'focused', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'vaulted', 'five-star', 'status.Overall', 'though', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'fine', 'comedic', 'fare', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'girls', 'might', 'touch', 'Minions', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'Carell', 'Gru', 'such', 'crazy', 'character', 'joy', 'watch', 'fun', 'film', 'entire', 'family']",N/A
