I am so pleased that I took a chance on acquiring this DVD package. The attention to detail is fantastic and the performances by Jane Alexander and Edward Herrmann seem incredibly accurate from what I remember of old newsreel broadcasts. This is a `warts and all' profile of a married couple and family that may have been dysfunctional to some degree, however, they seemed to put America first and have become highly respected for their public service.

I bought it to watch again to remind myself what good TV was like and out of interest in American History. It pulled a lot of bits of information together and created a story line using the work of reports. It takes FDR past the polio and rehab all the way through to his death. Edward Herrmann was a good fit for the role and allowed the viewer to focus on the story not on the actor. It covered the sexual aspect of the marriage and presidency. It also showed the political situation  and the events of World War II but not in great detail. It was mainly covered from the perspective of ways they affected the marriage. There was very  little coverage of the Roosevelt family beyond Husband and Wife. There was very little action and less adventure but when the reader remembers that FDR was wheekchair bound it makes sense.

1055861,A27T7FAONDX6VI,B000ND91S6,"Chris ""Chris906""","[3, 3]","'Eleanor and Franklin' is a wonderful miniseries excellently acted by the principals Jane Alexander as Eleanor and Edward Hermann as FDR. 'The Early Years' is especially striking and uses wonderful on location photography of FDR's homes in Hyde Park, New York and Warm Springs, Georgia. The elliptical way the story is done in the first part is also well done. The funeral train of FDR is portrayed in a very historically accurate fashion and in flashbacks Eleanor remembers her tough childhood and her courtship by FDR.The story being based on Joseph Lash's Pulitzer Prize winning book 'Eleanor and Franklin' is told ,like the book, from Eleanor's perspective. I think the series does wonderfully in humanizing these larger than life characters. It handles the depiction of FDR's battle with Polio very well and in a moving fashion. Another performance of note is the late Ed Flanders excellent, funny portrayal of key FDR adviser Louis Howe. He really handles this juicy character role with aplomb in 'The Early Years'. In the 'The White House Years' this part is played by another actor and he is not quite as memorable as the Flanders portrait of Howe, who was such a key figure in both Roosevelt's life. Also worth mentioning is the evocative score by John Barry. The score sets the tone and mood of the story very well.The DVD has excellent picture and sound. The picture is really quite splendid for a TV miniseries from the '70s and the DVD has excellent color reproduction. There are also scene selections. The DVD does not contain any other extras which is a pity because I would have liked to have heard more from Jane Alexander and Edward Hermann on what is was like playing these amazing historical characters. Viewers left wanting more visual info are encouraged to obtain the DVD of the PBS American Experience episode on FDR from 1994.All viewers should try to visit some of the personal locations depicted in the miniseries if ever given the chance. Warm Springs, Georgia has the Little White House preserved and has a great museum. It is a must visit for any Presidential buff. Hyde Park, New York has the FDR presidential library and the big house preserved plus Eleanor's beloved residence Val-Kill and Campobello Island has excellently preserved the summer home the Roosevelts lived in for many years and is the house where Franklin had to suffer through his battle with the dreaded Polio disease. These places are amazing and make the real life stories come to life.I give the 'Eleanor and Franklin Double Feature' an emphatic A+Highly recommended!",5,Excellent Miniseries Double Feature!

The DVD's present the story of how these two strong individuals met and fell in love and how they survived a tumultous marriage.  This would be at a time when the world would face the greatest war in history.Eleanor & Franklin is a 1976-77 production and runs 6 hours.  The series was made for HBO at what must have cost a king's ransom.  Costumes, scenery, vintage cars, and all the rest--production values are at the highest level.  Yes, the Roosevelts were from the upper crust of American society and lived privileged lives.  But they sacrificed a lot for their country in its greatest hour of need as these dramatizations show so well.Casting is superb.  Jane Alexander plays Eleanor Roosevelt and Edward Hermann plays her cousin and later, husband, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR).  The outside jacket of the DVD set says the miniseries won 18 Emmys back in the 1970's.  After viewing it recently for the first time, I wonder how the series didn't win more.  It is a true masterpiece.In the early-1940's, Benito Mussolini is supposed to have scoffed at the idea of FDR leading the U. S. in a world war.  Mussolini ridiculed FDR as a paralytic who could never lead his country to victory.  Not long after, Mussolini and his criminal partner, Adolph Hitler, would eat those words.  FDR's knowledge of world history and past wars, his experience in the military and in government, and his courage and resolve in the face of evil were exactly what was needed.For all his flaws as a man, I shudder to think what might have happened had FDR not been U.

I will say the ABC Mini-series is well done and the acting is excellent.  Even if it varies a bit from history or leaves some things out, it is well worth seeing what the US was up against depression/post depression/ WWII.That said, I felt the story as told through Eleanor's eyes was slanted against Franklin and his deception around his mistress.  The movie seemed very focused on a betryed women who felt Franklin had given up Lucy Mercer.  It is the long drawn out process in the end that showed he had never given her up despite his promise to her and his mother.  So this is more a look at Elanor and how valiantly she became his legs and ran around the US and the world bringing Franklin's political message.  Again, from what I have read in the reviews this is not an accurate portrayal of either of them.  That is why I have purchased the DVD biographies of both Franklin and Elanor.  Somewhere inbetween lies the truth.Despite the fact it may not be historically accurate from the relationship side, it was beautifully played out from the ascent of Roosevelt through his wealthy family and how he got the US through the depression and WWII.  One of the most moving scenes in the film is when they are returning his body from Warm Springs AK to Washington.  Along the route the train took, it was lined with common people who came out to watch his train pass.  I especially felt when they passed a group of black people and they begin to sing, it told the whole story of what this man did for many who are or were underserved in this country.  Odd how he was born to such wealth and priviledge to be honored by simple people.

The direction by Daniel Petrie is first rate and the script and acting flawless.

1055876,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B000ND91S6,John D. Cofield,"[1, 1]","This fine set contains two excellent mini-series which were first shown in the 1970s.  Based on Joseph P. Lash's majestic dual biography, Eleanor and Franklin is a deeply moving portrayal of America's longest serving First Couple.The Early Years is the better of the two series.  It begins with FDR's death at Warm Springs in 1945 and portrays, in flashbacks through Eleanor's memories, their early lives.  Franklin was a spoiled mama's boy, while Eleanor was a shy girl raised by her strict grandmother after her parents' early deaths.  As distant cousins, Eleanor and Franklin met at family gatherings and knew each other only slightly until they reached adulthood.  Their marriage was a love match and their early years happy until Franklin had an affair with Eleanor's secretary.  The scenes depicting how the couple decided to stay together are highly poignant, as are the scenes showing Franklin falling ill with polio and at first giving way to depression, then with Eleanor's support becoming determined to resume an active life.The second series depicts the Roosevelts during their White House years.  By that time the couple had largely developed second lives, with FDR pinned down by work and paralysis and Eleanor constantly on the move overseeing New Deal projects and later the war effort.  At times the second series seems a bit jumpy and rushed as it tries to pack 12 years, a depression, and a world war into a bit more than two hours.  Nevertheless its an enjoyable and informative look at how the Roosevelts lived their lives, and the final scenes showing Eleanor confronting her old memories and hurts are very strong.",5,History At Its Most Personal,1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,1638,"['fine', 'set', 'contains', 'two', 'excellent', 'mini-series', 'were', 'first', 'shown', '1970s', 'Based', 'Joseph', 'P.', 'Lash', 'majestic', 'dual', 'biography', 'Eleanor', 'Franklin', 'deeply', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'America', 'longest', 'serving', 'First', 'Couple.The', 'Early', 'Years', 'better', 'two', 'series', 'FDR', 'death', 'Warm', 'Springs', '1945', 'portrays', 'flashbacks', 'Eleanor', 'memories', 'early', 'lives', 'Franklin', 'was', 'spoiled', 'mama', 'boy', 'Eleanor', 'was', 'shy', 'girl', 'raised', 'strict', 'grandmother', 'parents', 'early', 'deaths', 'distant', 'cousins', 'Eleanor', 'Franklin', 'met', 'family', 'gatherings', 'knew', 'other', 'only', 'slightly', 'reached', 'adulthood', 'marriage', 'was', 'love', 'match', 'early', 'years', 'happy', 'Franklin', 'had', 'affair', 'Eleanor', 'secretary', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'how', 'couple', 'decided', 'stay', 'together', 'are', 'highly', 'poignant', 'are', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Franklin', 'falling', 'ill', 'polio', 'first', 'giving', 'way', 'depression', 'then', 'Eleanor', 'support', 'becoming', 'determined', 'resume', 'active', 'life.The', 'second', 'series', 'Roosevelts', 'White', 'House', 'years', 'time', 'couple', 'had', 'largely', 'developed', 'second', 'lives', 'FDR', 'pinned', 'down', 'work', 'paralysis', 'Eleanor', 'constantly', 'move', 'overseeing', 'New', 'Deal', 'projects', 'later', 'war', 'effort', 'times', 'second', 'series', 'bit', 'jumpy', 'rushed', 'pack', '12', 'years', 'depression', 'world', 'war', 'bit', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'enjoyable', 'informative', 'look', 'how', 'Roosevelts', 'lived', 'lives', 'final', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Eleanor', 'confronting', 'old', 'memories', 'hurts', 'are', 'very', 'strong']",Eleanor and Franklin Double Feature: (The Early Years / The White House Years)

After their sixth Child, Eleanor told Franklin in no uncertain terms, that she was DONE with sex and she moved to a separate bedroom. She also informed her daughter, (who thereafter felt sorry for her dad) that sexual intercourse was a thing to be merely endured. However, when the frustrated FDR took a mistress ( Lucy Mercer) Eleanor supported by Sarah, FDR's mother forced him to give up her up or be disinherited. While this resulted in the greatest president in our history, it was at his great personal expense.Nor did FDR in real life, express the short-tempered anger toward Eleanor which the movie displayed, even though Eleanor constantly badgered him for her pet projects (though sometimes those projects represented good causes) even though he was stressed out with the war and the depression.Roosevelt was exceptionally tolerant for the woman who bore him six children and cared for him in his decades of paralysis and struggles ad FDR was ever the jolly host, though on rare occasion they did spat, he showed her exceptional patience even building a cottage for her and her female friend on his estate.I suggest instead of buying this pair of DVD's, one read the two books, FDR, by Jean Edward Smith and Traitor to His Class, by HW Brands. Within those 1900 pages is the true story of their life together. One might add, FDR and Lucy: Lovers and Friends, by Resa Willis.

Jane Alexander and Edward Herrmann are unforgettable as the Roosevelts, and they are surrounded by an exceptional cast of fine character actors, including Ed Flanders, Rosemary Murphy, Mackenzie Phillips (in a superb turn as the teenage ER)and Linda Kelsey.  This is some of the best television of the 1970's, always involving and quite moving.  It is Jane Alexander, in her extraordinary tour de force as the adult ER, who proves with her work here that she was one of the finest, and most underrated actresses of her generation.  This is top-notch work that surely rivals any of the great big-screen leading roles of the decade.",5,A television landmark...at an incredible bargain price.,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,934,"['was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'landmark', 'television', 'movie', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'ABC', 'more', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'available', 'DVD', 'was', 'truly', 'surprised', 'low', 'price', 'set', 'not', 'only', 'ELEANOR', 'AND', 'FRANKLIN', 'follow-up', 'telefilm', 'ELEANOR', 'AND', 'FRANKLIN', 'THE', 'WHITE', 'HOUSE', 'YEARS', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'Roosevelts', 'are', 'surrounded', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'Rosemary', 'Murphy', 'Mackenzie', 'Phillips', 'superb', 'turn', 'teenage', 'ER', 'Linda', 'Kelsey', 'best', 'television', '1970', 'always', 'involving', 'quite', 'moving', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'extraordinary', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'adult', 'ER', 'who', 'work', 'here', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'most', 'underrated', 'actresses', 'generation', 'top-notch', 'work', 'surely', 'great', 'big-screen', 'leading', 'roles', 'decade']",Eleanor and Franklin Double Feature: (The Early Years / The White House Years)

A fresh viewing indicates they have not held up well.  Jane Alexander carries the show and did a masterful job of capturing the speech, diction and ""feel"" for Eleanor, but other than that....  The sets and costumes are tacky and garish, the use of color is overblown, and in every way it looks like a high school production.  The make up to ""age"" Eleanor for the confrontation with her daughter regarding Franklin's final indiscretions is horrid and third rate (compare to what was done with Cicely Tyson in ""Jane Pittman"").  The monologue of Anna to Eleanor at that point is dreadful whitewash.  Not to mention implausible.  For a woman nearing 40, Anna sounds as naive as a school girl and about looks like one.  The immobile helmet of hair didn't help.  It is additionally difficult to envision Eleanor being much upset about finding Lucy was present the day FDR died; any intimacy she and Franklin may have had was long gone by that time, as indicated by her refusal to resume a combined household, a request made by FDR in 1942.  She had moved on from him a long, long time ago by then.  This miniseries could have been much, much more and with a better script, better costumes and sets, and better direction would have been.

The story both written and told with so much sensitivity their love of history of the WW2 period shines through in every word.  I remember the series when it first aired in the 1970's and I saw the price.  I figured they butchered the movies or the transfer was aweful.  I was wrong on both counts.  The DVD transfer was beyond first rate.The run time for The Early Years is 204 Minutes.The run time for The White House Years is 156 Minutes.While there is no way to pardon FDR's love affair with his peice of fluff on the side, I understood the man.  FDR was wheelchair bound.  This young beautiful secretary was interested in him back when he was a scrapping virile able bodied man full of energy and hormones.  Nice as she was on the eyes, this scretary was no where near FDR's intellectual equal.  FDR especially after his cotracting polio needed the rich intellectual stimulation only a lady of quality like Eleanor could give.  FDR's love of Eleanor was sexual but it was vitally intellectual.  Eleanor was FDR's safe harbor and unfortunately he took her role for granted.The DVD shares all the raw emotions with you.  If shares good points and bad.  If offers insights into the country and world at these most trying of times.  This is one of the best DVD I sets have ever seen at this level of quality.  Generally everything HBO sells is overpriced but for the quality this DVD set is actually the best bargain I can remember going from HBO.
