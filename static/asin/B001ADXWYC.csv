1165563,A2CBN27MZORHJC,B001ADXWYC,"Amazon Customer ""Novice Reviewer""","[1, 1]","I've recently become interested in historical stories (books and movies/tv) set in London, from the Georgian Era through the 1920's. The tales of the ton is so fascinating! I thoroughly enjoyed this series. More than enjoyed really, I loved it! The acting is superb and after the first 30 minutes, the world of Louisa Trotter gripped me and I felt so involved in the story, the characters, their joys and their sadness. There are so many ups and downs and through it all, I was taken for an emotional and entertaining ride. I laughed and cried, sobbed! I will need an emotional break before I can watch this series again because after the last episode, I was distraught from missing my ""friends"" at the Bentinck Hotel. I know it's silly, but you know that feeling of sadness/depression one feels after going home from a long and wonderful vacation - that's how I felt at the end. Wonderful series! I wish there were more shows that focused on characters, people interaction, and good writing rather than all the mindless reality, sordid, and shock-value television that bombards (American) tv today.This series is so old that there's probably not too many who doesn't yet know what happened, but here's a ***Spoiler warning*** nonetheless.  I was incredibly happy to see in the middle of Series 2 that Louisa and Charlie were finally getting together and getting married..they deserved a happily ever after. THEN... Charlie dies!! OMG! I cannot tell you how devastated I was..shocked! Shattered! Did anyone else feel like this?? They were so close to their happy ending. Is this what really happened to Rosa Lewis? I certainly hope not because it was such a cruel fate. If it is fictional, I am not at all happy with the producers for not giving its audience a happy ending. His death is what makes it hard to re-watch the show because the whole time I was hopeful and waiting for their happily ever after. I cannot believe it didn't end that way.",5,True Masterpiece Indeed!,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,1947,"[""'ve"", 'recently', 'become', 'interested', 'historical', 'stories', 'books', 'movies/tv', 'set', 'London', 'Georgian', 'Era', '1920', 'tales', 'ton', 'so', 'fascinating', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'More', 'enjoyed', 'really', 'loved', 'acting', 'superb', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'world', 'Louisa', 'Trotter', 'gripped', 'felt', 'so', 'involved', 'story', 'characters', 'joys', 'sadness', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ups', 'downs', 'was', 'taken', 'emotional', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'laughed', 'cried', 'sobbed', 'will', 'need', 'emotional', 'break', 'can', 'watch', 'series', 'again', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'distraught', 'missing', 'friends', 'Bentinck', 'Hotel', 'know', 'silly', 'know', 'feeling', 'sadness/depression', 'one', 'feels', 'going', 'home', 'long', 'wonderful', 'vacation', 'how', 'felt', 'end', 'Wonderful', 'series', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'shows', 'focused', 'characters', 'people', 'interaction', 'good', 'writing', 'rather', 'mindless', 'reality', 'sordid', 'shock-value', 'television', 'bombards', 'American', 'tv', 'today.This', 'series', 'so', 'old', 'probably', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'here', '***Spoiler', 'warning***', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'incredibly', 'happy', 'see', 'middle', 'Series', '2', 'Louisa', 'Charlie', 'were', 'finally', 'getting', 'together', 'getting', 'married..they', 'deserved', 'happily', 'ever', 'THEN', 'Charlie', 'OMG', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'devastated', 'was..shocked', 'Shattered', 'Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'feel', 'were', 'so', 'close', 'happy', 'ending', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Rosa', 'Lewis', 'certainly', 'hope', 'not', 'was', 'such', 'cruel', 'fate', 'fictional', 'am', 'not', 'happy', 'producers', 'not', 'giving', 'audience', 'happy', 'ending', 'death', 'what', 'hard', 're-watch', 'show', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'hopeful', 'waiting', 'happily', 'ever', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'way']",The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection

Starting out as a humble kitchen servant she strives to become &#34;the best chef in London&#34; and succeeds. Her liaison with the future king takes a back seat to this story and he is rarely seen. The story focus's on the hotel she buys and the characters and staff that inhabit it. Usually the English sets are quite elaborate but that is not the case here.

1165569,A21OTH2LUE1NJ,B001ADXWYC,"Bruce Miller ""hyper2u""","[1, 1]","This is definitely one of the best British TV Series that I have viewed ! Acting is superb, story is well done, and the episodes are the perfect length. There are 31 hour long episodes in the complete series so it does take a bit of time to enjoy all of the stories. Fortunately, each episodes stands on its own and is not dependent on previous episodes in order to follow the self contained stories. In the way of very minor criticism, I wish that the series had sub titles. The dialogue is fast paced so perhaps it would have been difficult. The Cockney accent is hard to follow and I feel that I have lost a bit by not understanding all that is said. Nevertheless, the other British accents are very discernable and easy to follow. It does take a bit of getting used to and as the stories move on, I have become somewhat more comfortable in appreciating the dialogue. In particular, Louise Trotter, and Mr. Merriman are the most difficult to follow. The ""Major"" is an especially interesting character and I believe could be the subject of his own series. He is certainly a mystery man. Overall, the series fully merits the unusually high five star rating !Series 2 is even better (both series are in the complete set). The series follows up with events and activities of the player during WWI with many surprises. The cast of characters is able to skillfully deal with all of the many circumstances and situations which confront them and the usual humor, drama, and suspense is ever present in each of the episode. There are 31 episodes in the set; getting to the last episode is defintely worth going through all of the 31 episodes. I actually thought that series 2 was much better than series 1, perhaps because the actors had become more familiar with their roles or perhaps because having WWI as the background period made it much more dramatic and intense. Lotte emerges in the final episodes and adds a great deal to the stories.This was one of the BEST ! Don't miss it !",5,"Series 1 is Fantastic, Just started Series 2 !

She plays Louisa, an artist with food, and proves to be the queen (oops, Duchess) of society finery when it comes to providing the best possible hotel. It is her goal, her dream, and her zealous ambition.Along the way of creating this BBC drama/comedy series (PBS Masterpiece Theatre) she is joined in other cast members who also prove to be so likable and memorable that the entire cast becomes family. This similar thing happens in ""Monarch of the Glen"", also recommended. This story is a period from WWI through the 1920s. And along with the rest of the world, the Duchess of Duke Street ""roars"" through the 20's. With it you will experience every emotion imaginable, from love to hate, fear to peace, sadness to belly busting joy, laugh and cry at the same time.Besides Gemma Jones there are other top performances that will remain with you every time you again see the actors and actresses in other roles. Merriman (John Welsh) the butler, has an unforgettable manner, voice, and ability to be old but devilish. Starr (John Cater), the door man and his dog are as unforgettable and necessary as the lavishly designed sets for the production.CC is provided for those needing screen text. 31 episodes, shy of 27 hours, on 10 DVDs.

1165585,AJU9AJ2PMIG9E,B001ADXWYC,Jaci Cybul,"[1, 1]","I found this movie by accident. Gemma Jones stars as The Duchess of Duke Street. She is amazing in this role. I have watched it three times, which considering there are 31 episodes, must tell you how much I loved this movie!It's a story about a young woman who fights her way up in the work force by starting as a servant in various homes, to becoming the best cook in England! She learns to cook from a male French chef. He thinks only men make good chefs and women are useless in general, let alone becoming chefs. She takes all he dishes out and then some. He ends up having great respect for her and becomes quite fond of her.This teaches life lessons especially for girls as well as anyone who believes in themselves and won't let anyone or anything stand in her/their way.This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I bought it for my daughter because she fell in love with it too.There's romance, mystery, comedy, drama etc. Just buy it. You will not regret it. If I could meet Gemma Jones, It would be my honor to congratulate her on her best role ever. I have seen her in other movies and she can hold her own, but this one made her the star she is.

1165590,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,B001ADXWYC,Jody,"[6, 7]","Nobody did drama like the BBC in the 1970s.  Upstairs Downstairs, The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes (which is not and should be available on DVD), The Pallisers, Edward the King, and Lillie are the gold standards for TV drama. The Duchess of Duke Street is one of the best.Gemma Jones is superb as the hard-working, irascible and generous Louisa Trotter, whose single minded goal is to become the best cook in England and takes a job assisting the chef de cuisine at a great London house.  She refuses to be distracted by superfluities such as the French chef's insistance that women cannot cook, the unwelcome attentions of the son of the house, and an unfortunate marriage brought about by pressure from the Prince of Wales. Time and time again, Louisa turns bad luck into opportunity and succeeds through determination and hard work.Though Louisa faces devastating setbacks, she perserveres and creates an amazing and unconventional life surrounded by colorful characters and peppered with sparkling events and heartbreak.  From the beginning, she insists on being independent and is fiercely loyal to her friends.  This independence and loyalty as well as her cooking skills make for unforgettable stories within Louisa's story.  I sat down to watch DDS 1 and 2 over the holiday weekend for the first time since they originally aired on PBS, and it's just as fresh and wonderful as the first time I saw it. Gemma Jones' amazing Louisa effortlessly carries the two series, though she is supported by excellent actors and, as always, the BBC's costuming, sets and props are flawless.The story of Rosa Lewis, the real Louisa, is just as charming and colorful as told in The Duchess of Jermyn Street, which is well worth reading for fans of these two series. Edwardian society's excesses during the last days of the British Empire as well as its struggles to adjust to shifting conditions brought about by war and depression are of never ending fascination to me.  The Duchess of Duke Street is the perfect antidote for 21st century tedium, and if nothing else, watching Louisa create all her dishes from scratch makes one appreciate modern kitchen appliances!ETA:  WOO-HOO!!

1165592,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B001ADXWYC,John D. Cofield,"[3, 3]","The Duchess of Duke Street was a mini-series of 31 episodes in two seasons created during the Golden Age of British television production in the 1960s-1970s.  It is a dramatization based on the real life of the ""Queen of Cooks"" Rosa Lewis, whose Cavendish Hotel on Jermyn Street in London was known for decades as one of the finest establishments in Britain.This version begins with the young and ambitious Louisa Leyton, born into a lower class family who cherishes the seemingly hopeless desire to become a great cook.  The first series chronicles Louisa's adventures as she struggled to the top.  She started out as an assistant cook in a noble household, became ""friends"" with the future King Edward VII, made a disastrous marriage with a dimwitted butler, fell in love with the debonaire Viscount Haslemere, and eventually became chatelaine of the Bentinck Hotel on Duke Street. There she became well known for the homey atmosphere of her hotel, which catered to the most select clientele, and for the excellence of her cooking. The first series' episodes are fairly self-contained, usually featuring some misadventure of Louisa's such as her encounter with an investigative journalist or her feud with the ladies of a yachting club. There is also a continuing story line dealing with the love between Louisa and Lord Haslemere which resulted in the birth of a daughter.  The first series ends around the death of King Edward VII in 1910.The second series begins shortly thereafter, with several disconnected episodes leading into World War I.  The next five or six episodes deal with Louisa's wartime experiences and ably depict the privations and sadnesses of the period.  They are easily the best episodes of the second season.  The last few episodes showing Louisa and the Bentinck in the 1920s don't appeal to me as much, primarily because Louisa is so quintessentially Edwardian that she seems out of place in the Jazz Age.The Duchess of Duke Street features beautiful sets and costumes and fine acting by some of the best British talent of the time. Gemma Jones and Christopher Cazenove play Louisa and Charlie Haslemere, and there are many appearances by the likes of Anthony Andrews, Richard Vernon, Angharad Rees, and many more.  The episodes vary in quality, and I don't think the entire series ever reaches the heights of such sublime productions from the period as Upstairs, Downstairs or The Forsyte Saga, but The Duchess of Duke Street is entertaining and Louisa is always a lot of fun, so it's well worth watching.",5,An Edwardian Rags To Riches Story Par Excellence!,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,2535,"['Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', 'was', 'mini-series', '31', 'episodes', 'two', 'seasons', 'created', 'Golden', 'Age', 'British', 'television', 'production', '1960s-1970s', 'dramatization', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Queen', 'Cooks', 'Rosa', 'Lewis', 'Cavendish', 'Hotel', 'Jermyn', 'Street', 'London', 'was', 'known', 'decades', 'one', 'finest', 'establishments', 'Britain.This', 'version', 'young', 'ambitious', 'Louisa', 'Leyton', 'born', 'lower', 'class', 'family', 'who', 'seemingly', 'hopeless', 'desire', 'become', 'great', 'cook', 'first', 'series', 'Louisa', 'adventures', 'struggled', 'top', 'started', 'out', 'assistant', 'cook', 'noble', 'household', 'became', 'friends', 'future', 'King', 'Edward', 'VII', 'made', 'disastrous', 'marriage', 'dimwitted', 'butler', 'fell', 'love', 'debonaire', 'Viscount', 'Haslemere', 'eventually', 'became', 'chatelaine', 'Bentinck', 'Hotel', 'Duke', 'Street', 'became', 'well', 'known', 'homey', 'atmosphere', 'hotel', 'catered', 'most', 'select', 'clientele', 'excellence', 'cooking', 'first', 'series', 'episodes', 'are', 'fairly', 'self-contained', 'usually', 'featuring', 'misadventure', 'Louisa', 'such', 'encounter', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'feud', 'ladies', 'yachting', 'club', 'also', 'continuing', 'story', 'line', 'dealing', 'love', 'Louisa', 'Lord', 'Haslemere', 'resulted', 'birth', 'daughter', 'first', 'series', 'death', 'King', 'Edward', 'VII', '1910.The', 'second', 'series', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'several', 'disconnected', 'episodes', 'leading', 'World', 'War', 'next', 'five', 'six', 'episodes', 'deal', 'Louisa', 'wartime', 'experiences', 'ably', 'depict', 'privations', 'sadnesses', 'period', 'are', 'easily', 'best', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'showing', 'Louisa', 'Bentinck', '1920s', 'do', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'much', 'primarily', 'Louisa', 'so', 'quintessentially', 'Edwardian', 'place', 'Jazz', 'Age.The', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', 'features', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'costumes', 'fine', 'acting', 'best', 'British', 'talent', 'time', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Christopher', 'Cazenove', 'play', 'Louisa', 'Charlie', 'Haslemere', 'are', 'many', 'appearances', 'likes', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Richard', 'Vernon', 'Angharad', 'Rees', 'many', 'more', 'episodes', 'vary', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'entire', 'series', 'ever', 'heights', 'such', 'sublime', 'productions', 'period', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', 'entertaining', 'Louisa', 'always', 'lot', 'fun', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection

Nelson,"[67, 71]","We first rented this entire series through Netflix and when we finished the last DVD, we both were caught up in the feeling that we could stay in this time period and with these characters forever they were that engaging. The production is based upon a real life character who lived pretty much as this story unfolds. Which made it twice as compelling.So, when Amazon.com advertised that they were going to sell the DVD collection, I nailed it right away.  I will revisit Duke Street and the charming, engaging and outrageous Louisa Trotter, as played by the peerless Gemma Jones as the Duchess/Cook/Chatelaine, again and again. The entire casting is absolutely superior in the acting as is the story telling.

1165602,AG8U6F6226GBZ,B001ADXWYC,Lotte,"[1, 1]","I first had it on video, and a few years ago bought it on DVD because I liked the stories. BUT my big (and it is BIG) complaint was I couldn't understand much of the language.  The cockney, Welsh, etc. was so broad and so very fast, I missed most of the conversation.  We do have a very different sounding language unless the British characters speak more slowly and more distinctly which they do not so in very much of this series, therefore I missed most of the conversation, though I pretty much understood what was going on. I'm sorry subtitles weren't added as they are in most American films these days. Some British films don't need subtitles as the characters speak clearly and Americans can understand. Example: Helen Mirren in ""The Queen"" but in her series ""Prime Suspect"" most of the characters were impossible to understand, except for her and a couple of others.The ending disappointed me.  I waited for such a long time for Charley and Louisa to finally wed, and then Charley was written off.  As for Louisa's daughter, she had a very thin voice, and though she was a pretty good actress, doubt she could have become a professional singer.But there were so many good stories. The one I didn't care for, was the one with Star and his ex wife, but for the most part the stories were excellent and lots of fun, and I've watched it many times. Especially liked the way the clothes changed, and other modern conveniences came about in the hotel and the kitchen as the years went by.I would have liked to see more cooking by Louisa going from house to house, because she pretty much stopped after she left her job, and opened a hotel, but now and then she did it again.  Mostly her part was dealing with people in the hotel.Thought all the main characters were well done, and fit in perfectly with the Bentinck. One of my favorite chapters was when the newspapers tried to catch Louisa's hotel in some bad publicity, but it backfired when the Prince's picture was spotted on the wall of Louisa's office!  Another good chapter was when Charley got locked into a court trial over breaking an engagement to a dancer.  Of course he was never really engaged to the dancer, and the dancer lost the trial.Anyway, except for the language problem I enjoyed the series, though my husband didn't watch it as he couldn't understand the language.",5,Masterpiece theater,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,2341,"['first', 'had', 'video', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'DVD', 'liked', 'stories', 'BUT', 'big', 'BIG', 'complaint', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'much', 'language', 'cockney', 'Welsh', 'etc', 'was', 'so', 'broad', 'so', 'very', 'fast', 'missed', 'most', 'conversation', 'do', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'sounding', 'language', 'British', 'characters', 'speak', 'more', 'slowly', 'more', 'distinctly', 'do', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'series', 'missed', 'most', 'conversation', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'going', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'subtitles', 'were', ""n't"", 'added', 'are', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'days', 'British', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'subtitles', 'characters', 'speak', 'clearly', 'Americans', 'can', 'understand', 'Example', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'series', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'most', 'characters', 'were', 'impossible', 'understand', 'couple', 'others.The', 'ending', 'disappointed', 'waited', 'such', 'long', 'time', 'Charley', 'Louisa', 'finally', 'wed', 'then', 'Charley', 'was', 'written', 'off', 'Louisa', 'daughter', 'had', 'very', 'thin', 'voice', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'actress', 'doubt', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'professional', 'singer.But', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'stories', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'one', 'Star', 'ex', 'wife', 'most', 'part', 'stories', 'were', 'excellent', 'lots', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'Especially', 'liked', 'way', 'clothes', 'changed', 'other', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'came', 'about', 'hotel', 'kitchen', 'years', 'went', 'by.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'cooking', 'Louisa', 'going', 'house', 'house', 'pretty', 'much', 'stopped', 'left', 'job', 'opened', 'hotel', 'now', 'then', 'did', 'again', 'Mostly', 'part', 'was', 'dealing', 'people', 'hotel.Thought', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'Bentinck', 'One', 'favorite', 'chapters', 'was', 'when', 'newspapers', 'tried', 'catch', 'Louisa', 'hotel', 'bad', 'publicity', 'backfired', 'when', 'Prince', 'picture', 'was', 'spotted', 'wall', 'Louisa', 'office', 'good', 'chapter', 'was', 'when', 'Charley', 'got', 'locked', 'court', 'trial', 'breaking', 'engagement', 'dancer', 'course', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'engaged', 'dancer', 'dancer', 'lost', 'trial.Anyway', 'language', 'problem', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'language']",The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection

The detail of the furnishings and period clothing alone make it worth viewing.Gemma Jones who plays Mrs. Trotter, The Duchess of Duke Street, is good, to be sure, but we all have our favorite characters and mine is Merriman the butler played by John Welsh.  His understated manner and wit had me chuckling as I viewed each episode.  As in Upstairs Downstairs, though, there is one servant who is treated badly.  In UD, it was Ruby; in the DODS, it was Merriman.  Granted, some of it was good-natured teasing but much of it was not.  The disrespect that was shown to an octagenarian is disgraceful.Some of the episodes were difficult to watch especially during the WWI episodes; a lot of death and tragedy but then, that's war, isn't it?  I will say that the last 5 episodes took a turn that I didn't particularly care for but if I tell you what they are, it will spoil things for you.  I can say, however, that the character of Lottie is most disagreeable.  She has aspirations of becoming a professional singer and the woman who played her, Lalla Ward, *cannot* sing.  Her voice is weak, thin and trembly and I should think that they could've cast someone better for the part.  In my opinion, she dragged the series down but I still gave it a 5 star rating because she didn't enter the picture until close to the end.  Had she been introduced earlier, I may not have liked the series so much.I feel sad having come to the end and will definitely view this series again this winter during the cold, snowy months, sitting by the fire while sipping some English tea.

However, I assume for the sake of the bottom line, Acorn Media rarely includes English Subtitles.Another strange, obsessive occurrence is the constant drinking that must take place in almost every scene, especially after Louisa begins to run the hotel.  I don't mean that people are getting drunk....it's just that almost every scene seems to demand that activity.  I assume the writer/director believed this was a logical prop that would keep the actors' hands occupied.  I hate to ruin this for anyone, but just take the time to count the scenes in which they must have a drink in their hands.  There is one humorous occasion in which everyone in the room has a drink in their hands, and during the conversation someone makes an impressive point, at which one of the guests says, ""Well, I think that calls for a drink!""",2,You must be able to translate cockney dialect,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,1133,"['have', 'trouble', 'extreme', 'cockney', 'English', 'then', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'et.al', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'opinion', 'was', 'ever', 'TV', 'series', 'cried', 'out', 'Subtitles', 'However', 'assume', 'sake', 'bottom', 'line', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'rarely', 'English', 'Subtitles.Another', 'strange', 'obsessive', 'occurrence', 'constant', 'drinking', 'must', 'take', 'place', 'almost', 'scene', 'especially', 'Louisa', 'run', 'hotel', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'drunk', '.it', 'just', 'almost', 'scene', 'demand', 'activity', 'assume', 'writer/director', 'believed', 'was', 'logical', 'prop', 'would', 'keep', 'actors', 'hands', 'occupied', 'hate', 'ruin', 'anyone', 'just', 'take', 'time', 'count', 'scenes', 'must', 'have', 'drink', 'hands', 'one', 'humorous', 'occasion', 'everyone', 'room', 'drink', 'hands', 'conversation', 'someone', 'impressive', 'point', 'one', 'guests', 'Well', 'think', 'drink']",The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection

Geschke ""In search of History!!""","[10, 11]","Knowing the work of John Hawkesworth's Upstairs, Downstairs, I was intrigued in finding that from the golden age of Masterpiece Theater this beloved British miniseries entitled ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" was available on DVD.This miniseries consists of two series.  The first series consisted of 15 episodes and the second series had 16 episodes.Gemma Jones creates a role in which Louisa Trotter born to the servant class rises from a scullery maid to become a World Class Chef.  In time she learns the rules of high society from powerful men.  In all this she never loses her Cockney attitude or the Cockney accent.  This story is based on the true epics of Rosa Lewis who was a World Class Chef at London's venerable Cavendish Hotel.Louisa Trotter becomes the hostess and owner of Bentinik's.  During her reign before and during World War I through to the roaring 20's we find Louisa dealing with the trials and tribulations of her guests as well as her rather eclectic staff.  You will take comfort in the antics of the dear old Major as well as the dog Jack who greets the clientele at Bentinik's.In the course of the miniseries, we see Louisa's story including an affair with the Prince of Wales, an unhappy marriage and monetary problems.  Also along the way she has to deal with an out of wedlock birth and deal with the death of her one and only true love.Through thick and thin Louisa maintains the proper British stiff upper lip.

1165624,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B001ADXWYC,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[2, 3]","I love The Duchess Duke Street: Complete Collection.  For the price this series is on offer for right now this is an unqualified steal.  I watched this series last when I was in high school over twenty years ago and I never forgot it.  However I was just a wet behind the ears cub back then so much of the sexual overtones and interpersonal intrigues went right over my head.  Being autistic I was hardly a man of the world then or now.  I brought The Duchess Duke Street to relive my past joys. Funny that now I am an autistic man in my early fifties, I see and understand things in The Duchess Duke Street that I never understood before. I just liked the characters and settings in The Duchess Duke Street when I was young.  But 20 plus years hence I actually see new depths in Duchess Duke Street characters.  Some of the acting is not perfect but for the most part I think The Duchess Duke Street is pretty spot on for attempting to bring 1900's Edwardian England to life.  I love the old cars.  I love watching the culture make the switch from candles and oil lamps to Electricity.There was one story flaw I noted. This fictional Bentick Hotel was supposed to cater to the United Kingdom posh upper classes.  Why is their no elevator at the pupscale Bemtick surely Elisha Graves Otis and his invention of the safety elevator and founding of his Otis Elevator Company in 1853 did not escape notice in 1910 London.  Thomas Alva Edison's light bulb and Alexander Graham Bell's telephone did not escape notice and were used in the in The Duchess Duke Street's Bentick Hotel.  Yet the (Elevator) or Lift seems oddly absent at the Bentick.  I'm shocked at the absence of a lift; the series suggests the Bentick is a Hotel frequented by one's ""Betters"" of Early 1900's London society. You would think a posh Hotel would invest in an ""Lift"" for the safety and comfort of its older guests.  Watching all these old folk trudging up stairs and watching bell hops carrying heavy bags up stairs made the supposedly upscale Bentick Hotel rather ghetto.  The lack of an lift always reminded me I was watching a badly written TV drama. I'm a geek so when appropriate technology is incorrect or missing, I notice.  However one suspends belief when watching TV to allow one's self to be transported to a different place and time.  On the Main The Duchess Duke Street got most things right lift or no lift.  Still The Duchess Duke Street was well done.  I enjoyed the actors and felt they were generally awesome.Now the English accents were pretty darn good bordering on perfection which is why some in the United States have a hard time understanding what is being said. Fortunately I've watched British Comedy for ages so I grew up with the thick British accents and understand 99% of them with relative ease.  The hardest British Accents for US citizens to understand are Somerset, Yorkshire and Cockney because; the words melt together into a pool of sound like a song.  Some have trouble with thick Irish and Scottish accents as well, I can handle them all.  The only real dislike I have for this Duchess Duke Street Collection is that some of the transfers are really bad.  Not all but some transfers are faded, fuzzy, washed out and dark like someone did not care about quality at all.  Generally Acorn Studios does a pretty bad job of making transfers of its items.  However The Duchess Duke Street Collection is still very watchable.  Also it must be noted that in the The Duchess Duke Street series we are talking stock that is well over 20 years old and I can't expect Acorn to work miracles on old footage.  I am thankful that Acorn released The Duchess Duke Street even in this condition it is awesome to have in my collection.  I took one star off for the flaws noted herein.  The sound quality a slight hiss is evident in some areas so while not perfect sound quality is acceptable.  All that said, The Duchess Duke Street still gets four stars from me.  I am happy to have purchased The Duchess Duke Street it is fun to watch.  I enjoy the characters even the ones who are ripe stinkers morally speaking!",4,ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE SERIES.

It is a portrait of England during the time of Edward VII and how a lower class woman rose to the dubious position of hotel proprietor where she entertained distinguished guests. It is a look at the class separations of that age and the problems of a lower class woman falling in love with an upperclass man. I found this series captivating and I found myself rooting for the main character, Louisa, and her undying love for a vicount, and his undying love for her  and the barriers they faced in a society rigidly defined by class status. It is so realistic, and in places very sad as the story goes into World War I and some of the tragedies that the war caused.
