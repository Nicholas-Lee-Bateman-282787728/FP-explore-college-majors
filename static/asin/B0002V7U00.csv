Jane is a single successful woman, who isn't as much unhappy with her life, she just doesn't know how empty it is. On Christmas eve she gets in a car accident and wakes up to her husband asking if she is ok. Except she has no idea who this man is, and has no memory of her ""kids."" Freaked out, she goes about trying to get back to her life, but her apartment has someone else in it, her on and off boyfriend tells her he hasn't seen her in 10 years, and even her drivers license says she is married. With no place else to go she goes back to her *husband* and kids and does her best to adjust to her life. Ultimately she likes this life better than her single one.A couple of things that sets this apart from ""family man"". Jane is likable. Jane's husband, Sam, truly seems to love her and Jane's children both can act and make it appear that they love Jane also. Jane's new life comes with sacrifices but they are not so bad as that audience can't see the appeal.In the end she does got back to single life, but of course, gets to meet Sam and live the life she only previewed before.

Nancy McKeon plays a very sucessful, yet emotionally unsatisfied, corporate executive. She is the epitome of the ""21st century woman""- independent, powerful, beautiful apartment, expensive car- but is she really happy? Her empty relationship with a co-worker and dysfunctional family make it especially difficult to just plow through the holiday season without taking stock of what her life has become. Despite her outward success, the unspoken question in her mind is "" How did I get here?""The idea of a different life is put to the test when she has an accident and wakes up in an alternate reality as a wife, mother and pillar of her community. She also sees how her different life choices affect those around her. The alternate life does not come without its compromises (no expensive car or clothes in this version of life), but do the pros outweigh the cons? Are the benefits  of this ""new"" life enough to make her stay? Are the experiences in the alternate life fulfilling enough to make her want to jump ship and set her sights for a new shore?I won't answer that question. You'll have to see how it turns out for yourself.It is a great movie for anyone who has ever wondered ""what if"" or who has thought that ""the grass is always greener on the other side."" It is a story about finding your life's balance and knowing that, whatever you choose, does not come without its sacrifices.

The characters are decent, but sometimes a little to wholesome (particularly Sam, Jane's future husband). There really is never any climax to the movie, and it ends rather abruptly.

If, like me, you'd wondered what in heck happened to that tough, street-savvy tomboy from THE FACTS OF LIFE, well, Nancy McKeon, a.k.a. Jo Polniaczek, has been all this time churning out made-for-television movies.Her 2003 Lifetime movie, COMFORT & JOY, is an upside-down version of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. It's a gender-reversed riff onThe Family Man (Widescreen Collector's Edition)(2000). It predatesA Family Thanksgiving(2010), Daphne Zuniga's similarly-themed television film. These movies play on our proclivity to indulge in the ""What if?"" game. Should I place a Mild Plot Spoilers alert here? (I think I just did.) Jane Berry (Nancy McKeon), workaholic vice-president of a Connecticut advertising firm, sees Christmas Eve as just another work day. She's conned herself into believing her life is aces and oh-so-fulfilling. Never mind that her relationship with her glib boyfriend is sunk in inertia. (""How is Peter Pan?"" Jane's dad wryly enquires of her smug significant other.)On this Christmas Eve, see Jane Berry battle inclement weather while enroute to some festive work function. See her lose control of the wheel and her Jaguar careen into a street post. Jane wakes up to a flipped scenario. She's suddenly a housewife in the 'burbs with two kids and a stranger for a husband. So the question is, is this a time travel fantasy or a severely prolonged case of amnesia?It's not like Jane's old life never existed. It's just that she seems to have lost the past ten years. She marvels and is alarmed at the drastic shifts. This Jane she inhabits now is perceived as a pillar of the community, is content to be a stay-at-home mom, has relinquished the ambitions of a driven career woman, has long ago traded her Jag for an unsleek station wagon. I guess, somewhen in that interim, she took to heart another of her dad's sayings: ""Make more or desire less.""See Jane try to come to grips. Witness her periodic freak-outs and her children's bombarding her with questions like ""Mom, are you going nuts?"" and ""What's it like to go nuts?"" and ""Mom, are you still nuts?"" The one familiar thing is that her parents still exist in a nettled state of dysfunction. Is that Dixie Carter playing Jane's insufferably obnoxious - her fans would call her performance ""sassy"" - mom? Yes, it is.Somewhere along the way, Jane Berry - er, Jane Keller - does get a grip. She begins to enjoy her cute kids and appreciate her kind husband Sam (Steven Eckholdt). It's a plot development that surely won't stun any viewer. The only conundrum to keep you and me on tenterhooks is how will things resolve? And, oh yeah, is it time travel after all? Or a case of amnesia? COMFORT & JOY (Uggh, that title again) is a solid holiday movie, and Nancy McKeon is as watchable as ever. I'm calling it an above average 3.5 out of 5 stars. In today's ubiquitous social media, I only wish there were more water cooler talk whenever Nancy McKeon makes a movie.

This theme was probably handled most famously in the immortal ""It's a Wonderful Life"", where James Stewart's character of George Bailey had a unique opportunity to see what life would have been like for others if he had never lived. Lifetime's Christmas television movie ""Comfort and Joy"", explores a similiar theme where the main character Jane, a driven materialistic career woman played by Nancy McKeon, after enduring a car accident on Christmas Eve suddenly finds herself propelled 10 years into the future into a whole life she does not recognise and doesn't really at first want. All the confusion, anguish, and soul searching by Jane makes for both amusing and touching viewing and Nancy McKeon does wonderful work as the young women suddenly discovering she has a husband and two children and a whole new lifestyle she never imagined was possible or desirable. Ably supported by one of my favourite television actors in the talented Steven Eckholdt as Jane's equally confused husband Sam, this pair of telelvision veterans work beautifully together depicting a couple having to literally start from scratch again in building their relationship as the Christmas festivities fast approach.",4,Charming Christmas Tale With Supernatural Elements,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,1477,"['think', 'one', 'time', 'have', 'had', 'dream', 'nightmare', 'about', 'suddenly', 'finding', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'know', 'love', 'suddenly', 'dont', 'recognise', 'complete', 'strangers', 'know', 'love', 'have', 'absolutely', 'recollection', 'who', 'are', 'theme', 'was', 'probably', 'handled', 'most', 'famously', 'immortal', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'where', 'James', 'Stewart', 'character', 'George', 'Bailey', 'had', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'others', 'had', 'never', 'lived', 'Lifetime', 'Christmas', 'television', 'movie', 'Comfort', 'Joy', 'similiar', 'theme', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'Jane', 'driven', 'materialistic', 'career', 'woman', 'played', 'Nancy', 'McKeon', 'enduring', 'car', 'accident', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'suddenly', 'propelled', '10', 'years', 'future', 'whole', 'life', 'not', 'recognise', ""n't"", 'really', 'first', 'want', 'confusion', 'anguish', 'soul', 'searching', 'Jane', 'amusing', 'touching', 'viewing', 'Nancy', 'McKeon', 'wonderful', 'work', 'young', 'women', 'suddenly', 'discovering', 'husband', 'two', 'children', 'whole', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'never', 'imagined', 'was', 'possible', 'desirable', 'Ably', 'supported', 'one', 'favourite', 'television', 'actors', 'talented', 'Steven', 'Eckholdt', 'Jane', 'equally', 'confused', 'husband', 'Sam', 'pair', 'telelvision', 'veterans', 'work', 'beautifully', 'together', 'depicting', 'couple', 'having', 'literally', 'start', 'scratch', 'again', 'building', 'relationship', 'Christmas', 'festivities', 'fast', 'approach']",Comfort and Joy

As the film begins, McKeon is presented as a very successful career woman, who lives alone.  On her way home from the office, on Christmas eve, her car hits a patch of black ice and she swerves out of control, bumping her head in the process.  What follows is akin to the plot in ""The Family Man"" (although not as well done).  The man that rushes to her aid, claims to be her husband.  He ushers her into the house across the street, despite her arguments, where two solicitous children begin calling her ""mom.""  McKeon embarks on a journey to discover what is real and what is fantasy.

It teaches us that money, etc. aren't what's important in life.  The character that Nancy McKeon plays learns this by seeing into her potential future over the holidays.  It's similar to Nicholas Cage's &#34;Family Man&#34;, &#34;Mr. Destiny&#34;, Jennifer Love Hewitt's &#34;If Only&#34;, and other movies that allow the characters to see the &#34;what if&#34; scenarios of how their life may turn out or may have turned out if they would have taken a different path in life.",5,Great Movie For The Holidays!,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,604,"['love', 'movie', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'TV', 'finally', 'bought', 'perfect', 'movie', 'watch', 'holidays', 'money', 'etc', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'important', 'life', 'character', 'Nancy', 'McKeon', 'seeing', 'potential', 'future', 'holidays', 'similar', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', '34', 'Family', 'Man', '34', '34', 'Mr.', 'Destiny', '34', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', '34', 'Only', '34', 'other', 'movies', 'allow', 'characters', 'see', '34', 'what', '34', 'scenarios', 'how', 'life', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'may', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'different', 'path', 'life']",Comfort and Joy
