Speaking of singing and dancing, these are some of the worst songs that I've ever heard (The only exception is Tony Jay's musical number alongside Charlotte Rae). Plus, the plot seems to focus more on human characters rather than Tom and Jerry themselves. Why? Why would we care for these people when we're supposed to care more for the mouse and cat? And why didn't the creators of this film follow the original treatment of the classic Chuck Jones shorts? This could have been a great film if it was really done right.

684224,A1SN1URHER01NF,B00005UJ9X,James L. Farmer,"[11, 16]","This movie is really not all that bad....People really need to look upon the T&J; Movie and the original classic cartoons as two different things....I have all of the classic T&J;'s on Laserdisc (The versions that have not been re-edited for polical correctness reasons!). My 4 year old daughter and I watch them all of the time. Alot of people do not realise that the originals use to be played in movie theaters before a feature film and were made for adults. The originals were not geared towards kids.. But the Tom & Jerry Movie is.....And there is nothing wrong with that !After viewing the movie with my daughter, I found myself appreciating the movie for what it is. A KIDS FLICK! Critics of the movie also have to realise that it is a MOVIE and not a short 6 or 7 minute cartoon. So you need a story. And a story geared for kids. You cannot fill an entire movie with a bunch of chases that end with a pie in the face. That pond has been fished empty with the Tom & Jerry characters......As far as the movie itself, I thought that the animation was great, the music was great and the story was cute. Plus, on occasion there were glimpses of the classic T&J; antics incorperated into the film. I actually liked how they worked into the movie Tom and Jerry speaking for the first time. They both spoke at the same time and both of them looked at each other and said ""I didn't know you could talk"". I thought that was rather funny....There was also a scene in which Jerry frees a bunch of caged animals and Droopy slides out of one of the cages and says ""Hello all you happy people"". I thought that was a great touch for all of us older folks who watched both T&J; and Droopy.....The movie ended in true T&J; fashion with Tom trying to get Jerry in a mouse trap but Jerry (as always) gets the last laugh when Toms tail winds up in the trap...In closing, this is a cute movie for a new generation of kids. I highly recommend this movie for parents and their kids who want to watch something on a nice family Saturday evening. But for you college kids out there who like drinking a beer and watching the classic skits.....For get it....Try the Simpsons instead and remember that the Tom & Jerry Movie is a kids flick...And a darned good one....",4,Not That Bad - Cut It Some Slack.,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,2246,"['movie', 'really', 'not', 'bad', '.People', 'really', 'need', 'look', 'T', 'J', 'Movie', 'original', 'classic', 'cartoons', 'two', 'different', 'things', '.I', 'have', 'classic', 'T', 'J', 'Laserdisc', 'versions', 'have', 'not', 'been', 're-edited', 'polical', 'correctness', 'reasons', '4', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'watch', 'time', 'Alot', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'realise', 'originals', 'use', 'be', 'played', 'movie', 'theaters', 'feature', 'film', 'were', 'made', 'adults', 'originals', 'were', 'not', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids..', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'Movie', '..And', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'viewing', 'movie', 'daughter', 'found', 'appreciating', 'movie', 'what', 'KIDS', 'FLICK', 'Critics', 'movie', 'also', 'have', 'realise', 'MOVIE', 'not', 'short', '6', '7', 'minute', 'cartoon', 'need', 'story', 'story', 'geared', 'kids', 'can', 'not', 'fill', 'entire', 'movie', 'bunch', 'chases', 'end', 'pie', 'face', 'pond', 'been', 'fished', 'empty', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'characters', 'As', 'far', 'movie', 'thought', 'animation', 'was', 'great', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'was', 'cute', 'occasion', 'were', 'glimpses', 'classic', 'T', 'J', 'antics', 'incorperated', 'film', 'actually', 'liked', 'how', 'worked', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'speaking', 'first', 'time', 'spoke', 'same', 'time', 'looked', 'other', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'talk', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'funny', '.There', 'was', 'also', 'scene', 'Jerry', 'bunch', 'caged', 'animals', 'Droopy', 'one', 'cages', 'Hello', 'happy', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'touch', 'older', 'folks', 'who', 'watched', 'T', 'J', 'Droopy', '..The', 'movie', 'ended', 'true', 'T', 'J', 'fashion', 'Tom', 'trying', 'get', 'Jerry', 'mouse', 'trap', 'Jerry', 'always', 'last', 'laugh', 'when', 'Toms', 'tail', 'up', 'trap', 'closing', 'cute', 'movie', 'new', 'generation', 'kids', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'parents', 'kids', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'nice', 'family', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'college', 'kids', 'there', 'who', 'drinking', 'beer', 'watching', 'classic', 'skits', 'get', 'Simpsons', 'instead', 'remember', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'Movie', 'kids', 'flick', 'darned', 'good', 'one']",N/A
