I was sad to see the later episodes were not in the collections though and that I would have to wait for them to be released.  When I got word that they were in fact being remastered, I was exuberant.  The result is magnificent and just as great as I remember them as a kid.  The box set is well put together and not flimsy.  The video and audio mix is quality and much better than the original broadcasts as you might expect.

1502713,A3CA3RWZYJDWXE,B005SQRYJ6,BJ Fraser,"[1, 2]","I hadn't even heard about this version of the GI JOE TV series from 1989 until I was recently looking to buy the older Sunbow seasons of the show.  So I thought I might as well see what I was missing.  I have to say without the benefit of nostalgia like the Sunbow seasons, this season is pretty lame.What's interesting is that the show uses parts from three different series of the toys (19891-1991) plus includes some older characters like Cobra Commander, Destro, the Baroness, Zarana, and Lady Jaye (the female ones because apparently Hasbro didn't make many female characters after 1986).  It's especially interesting when over the course of the season you have two different Low Lights who look completely different.The first five episodes (Operation Dragonfire) focus mostly on the 1989 toys, primarily the Slaughter's Marauders and Python Patrol.  The plot makes little sense, as does the subplot of how Cobra Commander is regenerated to a man-like being after being turned into an actual cobra in 1987's GI JOE:  The Movie.  The subplot of Scoop being a double agent is more interesting and it's too bad him and Alley Viper never seem to meet again.  Worse than the cruder animation, cartoon sound effects, and nonsensical story is the mangled theme song for these episodes.  For some reason they change it to ""A Real INTERNATIONAL Hero"" even though the title graphic still says AMERICAN hero.The remaining 19 episodes introduce a new theme song that goes back to GI JOE being an American hero.  These episodes also eliminate the Slaughter's Marauders (unfortunately not Sgt. Slaughter himself) and Python Patrol.  For the most part the series uses the 1990 series of characters like Captain Gridiron, Ambush, and Pathfinder.  Near the end the Sky Patrol characters also are introduced.  But about halfway through the season some 1991 characters like Big Ben, Captain Krelov (Red Star), Heavy Duty, second Low Light, and General Hawk are added.  So if you were a kid at the time it might have been a little bewildering at the time to know which toys you were supposed to go buy.Anyway, most of the episodes aren't very memorable.  And as I said, without the benefit of nostalgia they aren't particularly enjoyable either.  I did find the last episode ""Stuck on You"" to be somewhat fun if only for Cobra Commander admitting he once had a girlfriend named Bernice, who must have been pretty hard up to go out with someone like him.Otherwise, unless you're reliving old memories, these aren't worth bothering with.That is all.",3,For Nostalgia Enthusiasts,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,2532,"['had', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'version', 'GI', 'JOE', 'TV', 'series', '1989', 'was', 'recently', 'looking', 'buy', 'older', 'Sunbow', 'seasons', 'show', 'thought', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'have', 'say', 'benefit', 'nostalgia', 'Sunbow', 'seasons', 'season', 'pretty', 'lame.What', 'interesting', 'show', 'parts', 'three', 'different', 'series', 'toys', '19891-1991', 'older', 'characters', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'Destro', 'Baroness', 'Zarana', 'Lady', 'Jaye', 'female', 'ones', 'because', 'apparently', 'Hasbro', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'female', 'characters', '1986', 'especially', 'interesting', 'when', 'course', 'season', 'have', 'two', 'different', 'Low', 'Lights', 'who', 'look', 'completely', 'different.The', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'Operation', 'Dragonfire', 'focus', 'mostly', '1989', 'toys', 'primarily', 'Slaughter', 'Marauders', 'Python', 'Patrol', 'plot', 'little', 'sense', 'subplot', 'how', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'regenerated', 'man-like', 'being', 'being', 'turned', 'actual', 'cobra', '1987', 'GI', 'JOE', 'Movie', 'subplot', 'Scoop', 'being', 'double', 'agent', 'more', 'interesting', 'too', 'bad', 'Alley', 'Viper', 'never', 'seem', 'meet', 'again', 'Worse', 'cruder', 'animation', 'cartoon', 'sound', 'effects', 'nonsensical', 'story', 'mangled', 'theme', 'song', 'episodes', 'reason', 'change', 'A', 'Real', 'INTERNATIONAL', 'Hero', 'even', 'title', 'graphic', 'still', 'AMERICAN', 'hero.The', 'remaining', '19', 'episodes', 'introduce', 'new', 'theme', 'song', 'back', 'GI', 'JOE', 'being', 'American', 'hero', 'episodes', 'also', 'eliminate', 'Slaughter', 'Marauders', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'Sgt', 'Slaughter', 'Python', 'Patrol', 'most', 'part', 'series', '1990', 'series', 'characters', 'Captain', 'Gridiron', 'Ambush', 'Pathfinder', 'end', 'Sky', 'Patrol', 'characters', 'also', 'are', 'introduced', 'halfway', 'season', '1991', 'characters', 'Big', 'Ben', 'Captain', 'Krelov', 'Red', 'Star', 'Heavy', 'Duty', 'second', 'Low', 'Light', 'General', 'Hawk', 'are', 'added', 'So', 'were', 'kid', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'bewildering', 'time', 'know', 'were', 'supposed', 'go', 'buy.Anyway', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable', 'said', 'benefit', 'nostalgia', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'enjoyable', 'did', 'find', 'last', 'episode', 'Stuck', 'be', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'only', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'admitting', 'once', 'had', 'girlfriend', 'named', 'Bernice', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'hard', 'go', 'out', 'someone', 'him.Otherwise', ""'re"", 'reliving', 'old', 'memories', 'are', ""n't"", 'worth', 'bothering', 'with.That']",G.I.

1502716,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005SQRYJ6,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 8]","""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"" is literally the classic animated series that became an iconic series for thousands of fans who loyally collected the many awesome merchandise from Hasbro and continues to be a popular toy line today.Although, the series was released in 1984, the series has spawned several of animated series, CG films, video games and in 2009, a live action film (with a second one planned for release in the summer of 2012).But like other children's action animated series, not many series tend to last long. For the original ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"", the first animated series would last from 1983-1986.But because Hasbro has been dedicated to their toy line up, and with new generation of children, in 1989, ""G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero"" was revived in 1989.  This time around, in order to cut production costs, Hasbro dropped Sunbow for DiC and due to budgetary issues, DiC would focus on the new characters during this time period.  A five episode mini-series titled ""Operation Dragonfire"" was released in 1989, and in 1990, a total of 19 episodes were created for the first season.And now, both the mini-series and the first season will be released on DVD for the first time courtesy of SHOUT! FACTORY in Jan. 2012.The first season would focus on Hawk as the G.I. Joe commander, Sgt. Slaughter as the head of G.I. Joe and Captain Grid-Iron as the field commander.  While the original cast of Duke, Snake Eyes and Scarlett were not seen in this season, focus was primarily on the newer character until season two which would eventually feature the return of Duke and also a more deeper storyline.  For Cobra, while Serpentor and Destro were seen as the two major leaders during the 1989The DiC release of ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"" would last from 1989-1992 and while fans have looked at the original '80s series as being superior, fans also look at the revival as important for the introduction of new characters to the toy lineup for both G.I. Joe and Cobra.  But perhaps the most significant change was Storm Shadow becoming a member of G.I. Joe (which was also reflected in the comic book series).Here is a brief spoiler-less summary of each episode of ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero - Series 2: Season 1':DISC 1:  OPERATION DRAGONFIREEPISODE 1 - Day 1 - Serpentor is now in control of the Dragonfire.  We are introduced to Scoop, a new member of G.I.

Joe - A Real American Hero"" is in full color, fullframe (1:33:1) and presented in Dolby Digital. Because the DiC series had not been released on DVD until 2012, for many people, the only quality that people had seen are terrible many generation recordings (bad faded colors) recorded from television back in 1990-1991.So, for many G.I. Joe fans, the release of ""G.I. JOE - A REAL AMERICAN HERO - SERIES 2: SEASON 1' is quite significant!  While there is obvious animated production differences between the '80s animated Sunbow series and the 1990 DiC animated series, while the animation was quite consistent with other animation of that era, there is a bit softness, some white specks and interlacing.  But this common to see for animated series from the '80s and '90s on DVD.With that being said, this is the best I have seen of the original 1990 animated series.As for audio, effects, dialogue and music are all clear and understandable.  I didn't notice any hissing, crackle or pops while listening to the soundtrack.SPECIAL FEATURES:""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero - Series 2: Season 1' comes with no special features.JUDGMENT CALL:For those of us who grew up collecting ""G.I. Joe"" toys and comic books, these animated series were a part of our childhood and for many Joe fans, these episodes are not only nostalgic but also have some sentimental meaning.While I grew up during the Sunbow series, when news came out that ""G.I. Joe"" was being revived in the '90s and this time by DiC, a lot of us who grew up in the '80s knew that this series would be targeted to a new generation of children, as many of us were now graduating high school or have become adults.I have to admit that by the '90s, despite my interest in G.I. Joe toys had dwindled as I was graduating high school and getting ready for college, I still managed to catch the series and even purchase a few of the toys.  No matter how bright the colors were or how many characters were introduced, that is the joy of being an eternal ""G.I. Joe"" fan and supporting the series and the releases.So, needless to say, I am quite biased when it comes to ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"".  No matter how childish or cheesy some of the stories were, if you had an imagination and if you grew up with the series and were excited about the introduction of new characters, then you can't help but be excited.  Especially when you hear that the DiC series were using newer characters.And while I am more biased to the '80s Sunbow series, during college, I did try to catch as many of the DiC animated series on television.  Granted, it was not the same G.I. Joe I grew up with.  Duke, Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Gung Ho, Shipwreck, and Flint were gone and this time it focused on General Hawk, WWF wrestler Sgt. Slaughter and a new generation of G.I. Joe leaders and soldiers.Which actually made sense to me at the time, as I was collecting the comic books and for anyone reading comic books, any superhero group or organization always had a change of characters and what better to tie into the toy line.So, watching the DiC animated series, it was rather interesting because you had Ambush, Pathfinder, Salvo, Sub-Zero, the Sky Patrol and so many new characters, my feeling at the time was that kids should be thrilled.Each character looked different, had different skills, various weaponry and attitude and Hasbro was quite innovative with the release of the toys. The animation encouraged us to enjoy them even further by establishing storylines that we could try to recreate. The series was the classic good vs. evil storyline and it's one thing to have these various members of G.I. Joe but the whole look of Cobra was just too cool to ignore.So, here we are with the DiC animated release of ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero - Series 2: Season 1'.  Many G.I. Joe fans may have missed the '90s series and the fact that the series was never released on DVD, many of us had no choice at the time but to watch terrible quality versions of the series that were recorded via VCR in the lowest quality.Of course, that was then...this is now.  SHOUT! FACTORY who released the Sunbow '80s animated series on DVD has now released the DiC animated series and quite frankly, this is the best looking and sounding version of the series on video to date.With the '90s series, while the characters, action and excitement was still there, the series also had to cater to children and thus, there were a lot of episodes that may leave older fans scratching their heads.  For me, I couldn't help but laugh because these lighthearted episodes also had it share of cheesy comedy.For example, in the episode ""The Nozone Conspiracy"", because Cobra is broke, they have to come up with ideas to make big money.  So, they create a spray known as ""Nozone"" and who do they find to help promote the product, Zarana in a swimsuit and the Dreadnoks.In another episode titled ""Granny Dearest"", Metal-Head's grandmother shows up.  And as he tries to create the impression that he is someone important within the Cobra ranks, she starts to become suspicious that her grandson is not working with good people.Another episode had polar bears associating with GI Joe members and even one curious polar bear getting involved in a mission.  It kind of made you wonder... were these writers smoking something at the time?Sure, these episodes may be a bit too lighthearted and kitschy for the older fans but I have always been positive towards this series because I knew that as I grew up with the '80s series, for the '90s, Hasbro was targeting a newer demographic of children.  It was the sign of the times...Granted, things have changed so much for ""G.I. Joe"" fans in the last decade, especially with the release of ""G.I. Joe: Resolute"" several years ago and fans now clamoring for a more darker series.  The animated series have become more edgier and darker and the targeted demographic are not so much the children but those who grew up with the '80s and '90s series who are still collecting ""G.I. Joe"" today.Also, one would also see a difference in production quality.  There was something about the original series that looked so good, while the DiC had less detail in my opinion.  While I did feel that the female characters were nicely drawn and the fact that there were so many characters featured in these episodes, while not necessarily inferior, it's just different styles of animation and also Hasbro did spend a lot on the production of the original '80 series.But for those of us who had the opportunity to grow up with these series, the DiC animated series would be important for many people in the introduction of many characters, many vehicles but also keeping ""G.I. Joe"" relevant for a new generation of collectors.As for the DVD release, you get the DiC mini-series from 1989 and all episodes of season one from 1990.  There are no special features (it would have been nice to see the toy commercials from the '90s included) but we do get the complete first season and the mini-series.  And for those who have watched the terrible quality versions that were sold on the Internet, finally the definitive version of the DiC ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"" has come out on DVD.And I'm looking forward to season 2, as the storyline becomes much more deeper and we see the return of a few of the classic G.I. Joe members.  Including a change with former Snake Eyes nemesis, Storm Shadow.Action-packed and fun! For those who grew up with ""G.I. Joe"" and are nostalgic for these classic '90s ""G.I. Joe"" episodes or for those who are new and want to see the evolution of ""G.I. Joe"", will definitely want to check out ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero - Series 2: Season 1'.",4,"Action-packed and fun!

JOE fan, this was a must have for me, specially having a lot of great memories from my childhood, what I did not remember was being not as good as the Original series, don't get me wrong, I love this series, one of the reasons being that I had most of the toy lineup for that series, but the story writing was not as good as the first series, it seems that they tried to hard to deliver punchlines where there were none. The Operation Dragon Fire mini series was a great start for this series, but I think they could have been better. None the less I love this series, a lot of great new characters, and old ones, but defenetly would have loved that they would have followed the vents of the Movie, so this is why I recommend it for true fans.YO JOE!!!!!!!",4,TRUE JOE FANS!!!!,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,774,"['Being', 'huge', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'fan', 'was', 'must', 'have', 'specially', 'having', 'lot', 'great', 'memories', 'childhood', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'was', 'being', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Original', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'series', 'one', 'reasons', 'being', 'had', 'most', 'toy', 'lineup', 'series', 'story', 'writing', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'series', 'tried', 'hard', 'deliver', 'punchlines', 'where', 'were', 'none', 'Operation', 'Dragon', 'Fire', 'mini', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'start', 'series', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'None', 'less', 'love', 'series', 'lot', 'great', 'new', 'characters', 'old', 'ones', 'defenetly', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'would', 'have', 'followed', 'vents', 'Movie', 'why', 'recommend', 'true', 'fans.YO', 'JOE']",G.I.

1502718,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B005SQRYJ6,Garrett Aja,"[34, 54]","Following the production of G.I. Joe: The Movie, Hasbro essentially severed all ties with Sunbow, who had produced a number of very popular cartoons based on their toys. G.I. Joe saw a number of episodes and the Movie re-packaged with Sgt. Slaughter-hosted wraparounds, The Transformers got a five-part finale (which was reduced to a very messy three-parter by the time production on it officially commenced), The Visionaries was never given a thought beyond its excellent 13-episode season, and Jem was probably the luckiest, as it got a single half hour to wrap up the series and the 65-episode order. And while the other shows drifted into the land of perpetual reruns, someone at DiC offered Hasbro the proverbial offer they couldn't refuse to revive G.I. Joe.Hasbro *really* should have refused that offer.While DiC was responsible for a lot of good and even great shows throughout the '80s, they had begun to earn their derisive nickname by 1989: Do It Cheap. Instead of working with high-quality outsourcing studios like Toei and TMS (as was the case at Sunbow, and in the early days of DiC), DiC was now using overseas studios even cheaper than AKOM, and it showed. The DiC G.I. Joe is no different, as episodes look far worse than any episode of the Sunbow series. The writing and voice acting also took a huge nose dive, as few of the Sunbow show's key writers came back, and Michael Charles Hill's proposed Season 3 storyline was completely discarded, which meant that Cobra Commander returned in less than 3 episodes that the rough ""half a season"" estimate in the proposal. Additionally, the decision was made by new story editor Doug Booth (a Sunbow writer himself) to ""dumb down"" the show, ignoring many existing characters, and even then writing for a younger audience. As for the cast, only Chris Latta (working as Chris Collins), Morgan Lofting (who left pretty early on in the series), Ed Gilbert as Hawk (who left after Season 1), and Bob Remus as Sgt. Slaughter returned. What's particularly galling in this regard is that Michael Bell was not brought back, even though he had the ""honor"" of teasing the new show in character as Duke during a G.I. Joe toy ad for the ""Battle Pay"" promotion in 1990.So, for reasons unclear (and contradictory to statements previously made by both Hasbro and Shout! Factory), we're getting the DiC G.I. Joe on DVD. Unlike the Sunbow show, there will be no foolish attempt to use the unfinished 35mm prints: Do It Cheap-era DiC was notorious for generating numerous re-takes, making a journey to the 35s highly unadvisable. The likely episode count will be as follows:""Operation: Dragonfire"" (1989 5-parter)""United We Stand""""Revenge of the Pharaohs""""Granny Dearest""""Victory at Volcania"" (two-parter)""The Nozone Conspiracy""""Pigskin Commandos""""Cold Shoulder""""Injustice and the Cobra Way""""General Confusion""""Night of the Creepers""""That's Entertainment""""I Found You... Evy""""An Officer and a Viperman""""D-Day at Alcatraz"" (two-parter)""The Mind Mangler""""BIOK""""Stuck on You""Beyond Operation: Dragonfire and a couple of episodes towards the end of the season, the Joes are populated mostly by new characters like Captain Grid-Iron, who was paired off with Lady Jaye. In fact, continuity is of such a low regard that the color of the laser fire has been swapped: the Joes now shoot blue lasers, and Cobra red. Perhaps most galling of all (of the episodes on this set, at any rate) is ""Injustice and the Cobra Way"", an episode that was probably was re-written heavily from a Flint Dille story idea at Sunbow, which attempts to clone Sunbow's famed slimy reporter, Hector Ramirez. But, in a series that sees Destro dumping the Baroness for Zarana (who later seems to get disgustingly close to Cobra Commander), Scarlett ignoring her duty (and a chance to meet the Queen of England) to *go shopping*, and Lt. Falcon re-imagined as a junkie, there are many, many low points to examine. And to think, the second season is where the DiC run gets especially horrible.",1,Inferior to the Sunbow series in every way,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,4000,"['Following', 'production', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Movie', 'Hasbro', 'essentially', 'severed', 'ties', 'Sunbow', 'who', 'had', 'produced', 'number', 'very', 'popular', 'cartoons', 'based', 'toys', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'saw', 'number', 'episodes', 'Movie', 're-packaged', 'Sgt', 'Slaughter-hosted', 'wraparounds', 'Transformers', 'got', 'five-part', 'finale', 'was', 'reduced', 'very', 'messy', 'three-parter', 'time', 'production', 'officially', 'commenced', 'Visionaries', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'thought', 'excellent', '13-episode', 'season', 'Jem', 'was', 'probably', 'luckiest', 'got', 'single', 'half', 'hour', 'wrap', 'up', 'series', '65-episode', 'order', 'other', 'shows', 'drifted', 'land', 'perpetual', 'reruns', 'someone', 'DiC', 'offered', 'Hasbro', 'proverbial', 'offer', 'could', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'revive', 'G.I', 'Joe.Hasbro', '*really*', 'should', 'have', 'refused', 'offer.While', 'DiC', 'was', 'responsible', 'lot', 'good', 'even', 'great', 'shows', ""'80s"", 'had', 'begun', 'earn', 'derisive', 'nickname', '1989', 'Do', 'Cheap', 'Instead', 'working', 'high-quality', 'outsourcing', 'studios', 'Toei', 'TMS', 'was', 'case', 'Sunbow', 'early', 'days', 'DiC', 'DiC', 'was', 'now', 'using', 'overseas', 'studios', 'even', 'cheaper', 'AKOM', 'showed', 'DiC', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'different', 'episodes', 'look', 'far', 'worse', 'episode', 'Sunbow', 'series', 'writing', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'took', 'huge', 'nose', 'dive', 'few', 'Sunbow', 'show', 'key', 'writers', 'came', 'back', 'Michael', 'Charles', 'Hill', 'proposed', 'Season', '3', 'storyline', 'was', 'completely', 'discarded', 'meant', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'returned', 'less', '3', 'episodes', 'rough', 'season', 'estimate', 'proposal', 'Additionally', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'new', 'story', 'editor', 'Doug', 'Booth', 'Sunbow', 'writer', 'dumb', 'down', 'show', 'ignoring', 'many', 'existing', 'characters', 'even', 'then', 'writing', 'younger', 'audience', 'cast', 'only', 'Chris', 'Latta', 'working', 'Chris', 'Collins', 'Morgan', 'Lofting', 'who', 'left', 'pretty', 'early', 'series', 'Ed', 'Gilbert', 'Hawk', 'who', 'left', 'Season', '1', 'Bob', 'Remus', 'Sgt', 'Slaughter', 'returned', 'What', 'particularly', 'galling', 'regard', 'Michael', 'Bell', 'was', 'not', 'brought', 'back', 'even', 'had', 'honor', 'teasing', 'new', 'show', 'character', 'Duke', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'toy', 'ad', 'Battle', 'Pay', 'promotion', '1990.So', 'reasons', 'unclear', 'contradictory', 'statements', 'previously', 'made', 'Hasbro', 'Shout', 'Factory', ""'re"", 'getting', 'DiC', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'DVD', 'Sunbow', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'foolish', 'attempt', 'use', 'unfinished', '35mm', 'prints', 'Do', 'Cheap-era', 'DiC', 'was', 'notorious', 'generating', 'numerous', 're-takes', 'making', 'journey', '35s', 'highly', 'unadvisable', 'likely', 'episode', 'count', 'will', 'be', 'Operation', 'Dragonfire', '1989', '5-parter', 'United', 'Stand', 'Revenge', 'Pharaohs', 'Granny', 'Dearest', 'Victory', 'Volcania', 'two-parter', 'Nozone', 'Conspiracy', 'Pigskin', 'Commandos', 'Cold', 'Shoulder', 'Injustice', 'Cobra', 'Way', 'General', 'Confusion', 'Night', 'Creepers', 'Entertainment', 'Found', 'Officer', 'Viperman', 'D-Day', 'Alcatraz', 'two-parter', 'Mind', 'Mangler', 'BIOK', 'Stuck', 'Operation', 'Dragonfire', 'couple', 'episodes', 'end', 'season', 'Joes', 'are', 'populated', 'mostly', 'new', 'characters', 'Captain', 'Grid-Iron', 'who', 'was', 'paired', 'off', 'Lady', 'Jaye', 'fact', 'continuity', 'such', 'low', 'regard', 'color', 'laser', 'fire', 'been', 'swapped', 'Joes', 'now', 'blue', 'lasers', 'Cobra', 'red', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'galling', 'episodes', 'set', 'rate', 'Injustice', 'Cobra', 'Way', 'episode', 'was', 'probably', 'was', 're-written', 'heavily', 'Flint', 'Dille', 'story', 'idea', 'Sunbow', 'clone', 'Sunbow', 'famed', 'slimy', 'reporter', 'Hector', 'Ramirez', 'series', 'Destro', 'dumping', 'Baroness', 'Zarana', 'who', 'later', 'get', 'disgustingly', 'close', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'Scarlett', 'ignoring', 'duty', 'chance', 'meet', 'Queen', 'England', '*go', 'shopping*', 'Lt.', 'Falcon', 're-imagined', 'junkie', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'low', 'points', 'examine', 'think', 'second', 'season', 'where', 'DiC', 'run', 'especially', 'horrible']",G.I.

1502719,A6S7BFWB40M6B,B005SQRYJ6,KAB,"[12, 15]","For starters, yes, this series is by far the inferior to the Sunbow series and should not be anyone's FIRST introduction into the battle between GI Joe and Cobra. Still, this stuff is great for completists and I thank Shout! Factory for allowing us to complete the series. Sgt. Slaughter, General Hawk, and Cobra Commander make their triumphant returns (including their voice actors) as do Destro, Baroness, and Zarana (along with Serpentor [sans the pathetic utterances of ""This I Command!""] for the duration of ""Operation Dragonfire""). This leaves plenty of room for a new batch of heroes and enemies to love (sometimes pronounced ""loathe."")However, DIC's taking over of the ""GI Joe"" project following the animated movie presented the downfall of two separate mainstays in 80s animation: one animated adventure, the other the animation company:-GI Joe, a ""REAL AMERICAN"" Hero was repronounced to ""INTERNATIONAL hero"" in the title tracks to ""Operation: Dragonfire."" (PC idiocy at its most obnoxious and in-your-face). Furthermore, Cobra is reduced to a ""ruthless"" enemy (and, later, what I swear sounds like ""worthless terrorist organization""). Anyone whose remotely familiar with the GI Joe story arc knows that they mean ""COBRA"" (even Destro's Iron Grenadiers and the now-absent Zartan's Dreadnoks worked beneath the banner of Cobra).-DIC Enterprises was responsible for such gems as ""Inspector Gadget,"" ""M.A.S.K."", ""Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors,"" and ""C.O.P.S"" throughout the 80s, thereby establishing themselves as a respectable animation studio. With ""GI Joe"" Series 2, DIC enterprises began what lots of fans of both the Joes and DIC animation seem to think is the company's long downfall.I digress. Messing with the theme song's lyrics over the duration of the iconic ""Operation Dragonfire"" mini-series is the least of this series' concerns. ""Operation: Dragonfire"" is, after all, the last time that a lot of the orginal Joes (Low Light, Stalker, Lady J, Sprit, Mutt, etc) saw a lot of screen time before making way for a batch of new recruits and casting the originals into oblivion or into the role of extras (Lady J and Low Light at least survive into the series post ""...Dragonfire"" and Duke is seen in background, nonspeaking roles all of the time until the ""Mind Mangler"" episode puts him in direct focus once more) Furthermore, the idea of the distinct factions of Vipers with distinct duties instead of the nameless, faceless Cobra troops of Sunbow-fame were a interesting  additions and, while I missed Snake-Eyes, Dusty, and Zartan and the Dreadnoks, the retread of GI Joe welcomed retreaded troops.Don't let my review turn you away. ""GI Joe"" is ""GI Joe"" in any form, this stuff is great for completists who are already familiar with the ORIGINAL GI Joe, and I applaud DIC enterprises for its attempt to pick up where Sunbow would have otherwise regrettably left off.

I think the best thing about this G I Joe series 2, is the the five-part-episode ""Operation Dragonfire"" This miniseries explains how Cobra Commander (voice by the late Chris Latta) returns as leader of Cobra. He is now half human/half snake and has a new body armored uniform!  Also Destro has a gold mask and a new body armor as well.  Meanwhile the G I Joe team has some new characters which are introduced throughout G I Joe series 2: season 1.  This is an gem if want the DIC's version of G I Joe.  The animation is not as good as  G I Joe:A Real American Hero Sunbow series but it is still good to watch and learn the events that happened after G I Joe : The Movie.

They are a little more stream lined and have more in the way of vehicles to sell in the way of toys. Some of the old guys are back, like Sgt. Slaughter and Duke, but the fun is still there.  I'd buy season two in a minute when it is released.  When I watched this I expected the quality to go way down.  The animation is different, however it's not the failure some of the reviews have indicated.  The small changes to some of the villians are a welcome one. The Cobra Commander and Destro are still around, so you know it will make for some interesting episodes.
