553418,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00004W21V,Brent Butler,"[2, 2]","My wife and I came across this show by accident years ago. We were on vacation, switching around the TV stations, and came across ""Vicar"" playing on a local PBS station in Orlando. We were there for two weeks, and we liked the first episode we saw so much that we made sure to tune in the second week also. We came home and looked for it on our local schedule, but as far as we know it has never been shown in our home area.So we happened to look for a DVD set and were delighted to find that all the seasons, specials, and follow-up specials were available. We bought them all.We haven't played these shows in a few years, and tonight I decided it was about time for a reprise. Season One of course shows how a female Vicar came to be assigned to the small village, and introduces the odd, amusing, and lovable village folk. Pay special attention in episode two, where a bible is introduced to the church in an old printing style where ""f"" is used for the letter ""s"". This comes into play near the end of the show. You'll also enjoy the bit at the end of each show where the Vicar tells her helper a joke. I won't say more but the comedy in those scenes extends far beyond the joke itself.Dawn French could not have been more personable and funny as the Vicar foisted upon a town with old fashioned values, or at least so they thought. She is convincing as a woman both committed to her church and community, and feeling the pull of a normal life at the same time.There are a few jokes in the series that you might not get unless you are both British and familiar with British pop culture from the years when ""Vicar"" was filmed. Despite missing out on those few jokes, there are plenty more to fill each episode with chuckles and outright laughter.Highly recommended.",5,You'll literally laugh 'til you cry,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,1768,"['wife', 'came', 'show', 'accident', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'vacation', 'switching', 'TV', 'stations', 'came', 'Vicar', 'playing', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'Orlando', 'were', 'there', 'two', 'weeks', 'liked', 'first', 'episode', 'saw', 'so', 'much', 'made', 'sure', 'tune', 'second', 'week', 'also', 'came', 'home', 'looked', 'local', 'schedule', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'never', 'been', 'shown', 'home', 'area.So', 'happened', 'look', 'DVD', 'set', 'were', 'delighted', 'find', 'seasons', 'specials', 'follow-up', 'specials', 'were', 'available', 'bought', 'all.We', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'shows', 'few', 'years', 'tonight', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'reprise', 'Season', 'One', 'course', 'how', 'female', 'Vicar', 'came', 'be', 'assigned', 'small', 'village', 'odd', 'amusing', 'lovable', 'village', 'folk', 'Pay', 'special', 'attention', 'episode', 'two', 'where', 'bible', 'introduced', 'church', 'old', 'printing', 'style', 'where', 'f', 'used', 'letter', 's', 'play', 'end', 'show', ""'ll"", 'also', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'end', 'show', 'where', 'Vicar', 'helper', 'joke', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'extends', 'far', 'joke', 'itself.Dawn', 'French', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'personable', 'funny', 'Vicar', 'foisted', 'town', 'old', 'fashioned', 'values', 'least', 'thought', 'convincing', 'woman', 'committed', 'church', 'community', 'feeling', 'pull', 'normal', 'life', 'same', 'are', 'few', 'jokes', 'series', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'are', 'British', 'familiar', 'British', 'pop', 'culture', 'years', 'when', 'Vicar', 'was', 'filmed', 'missing', 'out', 'few', 'jokes', 'are', 'plenty', 'more', 'fill', 'episode', 'chuckles', 'outright', 'laughter.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Join Dawn French &amp; Co. for six superb episodes of the BBC comedy hit written by Richard Curtis (FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL).Welcome to Dibley, filled with some perfectly-peculiar characters like Letitia Cropley (Liz Smith), Frank Pickle (John Bluthal), Jim Trott (Trevor Peacock) and Owen Newitt (Roger Lloyd Pack).  Governing Dibley with an iron fist and a sealed wallet is snooty David Horton (Gary Waldhorn) and his young dimwit son Hugo (James Fleet).  Last but not least is the truly-terrifying Alice Tinker (Emma Chambers), the resident verger of the church.&quot;Arrival&quot; - After the 102-year-old Reverend Pottle carks it, the town of Dibley awaits its new vicar for St. Barnabus Church.  When the totally-unexpected Reverend Geraldine Boadicea Granger (Dawn French) arrives in town, no-one is prepared for what is to follow.&quot;Songs of Praise&quot; - Geraldine discovers that the BBC wish to film an episode of 'Songs of Praise' at the local church.  There's only one problem:  there's no choir.  Whilst Gerry and Alice quickly arrange auditions for the prospective choir, the rest of the town quickly starts becoming stage-struck...&quot;Community Spirit&quot; - With the annual Autumn Fayre looming, Gerry decides to get some more publicity for the event by getting a big celebrity to open it.  An idea more easily said than actually achieved.  When Alice casually mentions she has a long-lost cousin called Reg Dwight, Gerry puts two and two together and thinks she is referring to Elton John...&quot;The Window and the Weather&quot; - A big storm, arguably the biggest the town has ever known, has destroyed the beautiful stained-glass window of the church.  While the jury's still out on what Biblical scene the window actually depicted, Gerry decides to canvas all the rich people she can for donations to get a replacement.&quot;Election&quot; - David Horton and Gerry find themselves competing in the local elections, and two guesses who everyone is voting for...&quot;Animals&quot; - Unwittingly, Gerry finds herself performing a mass for all the animals of the village.  When the national press gets wind of the event, Gerry starts thinking twice about her actions...If you love BBC comedy in the best sense of the word, you'll adore Dawn French and a superb cast in THE VICAR OF DIBLEY.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Most of the Church of England has accepted women's ordination by now, but I assume that the practice ruffled some feathers at first.And it becomes a source of comedy in &#34;The Vicar of Dibley - The Complete Series 1,&#34; where a quaint little village ends up with a bawdy, busty woman as their new cleric. While the character of David feels Flanderized at times, it's a genuinely funny little show that doesn't get too preachy with its religious content... although it's too nice and friendly to become an English &#34;Father Ted.&#34;When the ancient Reverend Pottle expires during services, the people of Dibley are given a brand-new vicar: Geraldine Granger (Dawn French), who is very much female (&#34;These are such a giveaway, aren't they?&#34;). This initially shocks the parish council -- especially stuffy and wealthy David Horton (Gary Waldhorn) -- but her friendly , jokey approach to her job quickly endears her to the locals.And she immediately has a bunch of problems to deal with, along with her dim-witted verger Alice (Emma Chambers) -- a BBC show about churches wants to film Gerry at work (as Alice struggles with a new Bible); a village festival that needs to be opened by a celebrity; a storm smashes a stained-glass window that they can't afford to replace; a political election that Gerry uses against David; and a controversial service to bless animals, which might wreck Gerry's reputation.Thankfully, &#34;The Vicar of Dibley&#34; spends relatively little time preaching about what religion should be, although it lays it heavy on the political cliches (David is super-conservative, rich, fusty, a golfer and doesn't care about common people -- in other words, he might as well be a cartoon). Honestly, the story would have been just as entertaining had she been a man -- a bouncy, irreverent breath of fresh air surrounded by kooky village eccentrics.About half of the comedy comes from Gerry and the hapless Alice, and the other half from the rest of the village council (consider Mrs Cropley, an elderly woman with strange cooking habits and a penchant for sex and nudity). Creator Richard Curtis and Paul Mayhew-Archer pepper it with lots of absurd situations and wacky, satirical dialogue (&#34;Stop writing, Frank! 'Can't' isn't in the Christian Vocabulary!&#34; &#34;Yes it is! You can't commit adultery, you can't steal...&#34; &#34;You can't even covet your neighbour's ass. Even if it is very alluring!&#34;).And amidst all the comedy, they manage to put in some heartwarming stuff, like the burgeoning romance between Alice and David's equally-dim son Hugo. And the conclusion to the whole stained-glass-window debacle is rather touching, as is the whole situation with the animal-blessings.One thing that hasn't aged well is the pop culture/sociopolitical references. As I was a young child in the early nineties, I was forced to google many of the the then-contemporary references just to figure out who they were talking about. It kind of kills the jokes.The central role was made for Dawn French, and it shows -- she steals every scene with robust fervor and sly irreverence, but you can see that Gerry is a genuinely kind and pleasant person. And she plays well opposite the various actors, especially Chambers as the dippy Alice (who never understands jokes, and goes into long rants about I Can't Believe It's Not Butter).

It has taken a year for me to get my hands on these latest two tapes and I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive: could that quality have been maintained? The grateful answer to that is an unqualified ""yes"". Unlike many series, this one has not taken a nosedive.Having said that, I have to point out that it is not exactly ""much of the same thing"". The differences are subtle (or I think they are), but very much in evidence. Formerly the characters who inhabit the magical, mad villiage of Dibley were eccentric (and that is a subtle understatement), but in these last four episodes (i.e. volumes five and six) they become more and more absurd. Is it at all likely, for example, that Alice might suddenly speak fluent Hebrew and indulge in a tirade about implied homosexual rape? Would even Owen seriously consider juggling with live babies? What about Frank's increased references to his own homosexuality? And as for Jim's outfit for one of the Kings in the Nativity ...These questions do not in the least take away from the hilarity of the series. Quite the contrary: they add an absurdist twist which induces the kind of hysterical laughter that forces one to stop the video for a while, just to calm down before the next onslaught. In so many ways these absurdities help to save the situation from becoming dull and predictable (although there are one or two really predictable jokes).A must for devoted fans, newcomers might prefer to watch the first four tapes before embarking on these latest ones.

The Brits seem to like sitcoms about religious figures.  ""Father Ted"" has a lot more slapstick than ""The Vicar of Dibley.""  Whereas both have the usual British irreverent humor, ""The Vicar of Dibley"" also includes more touching and reverent moments.  ""Father Ted"" is straight-up irreverent with the priest doing very little priest work.  Geraldine Granger (Dawn French) is actually seen conducting services and is portrayed as a very competent vicar although very progressive and not adverse to off-color remarks.  Father Ted, in contrast, seems to have little respect for his profession.  While ""Father Ted"" has more laugh-out-loud moments, ""The Vicar of Dibley"" also has its moments, but is not quite as in-your-face.  Actually most of the funniest lines are delivered by the straight man in the show--no nonsense, perennial party-pooper David Horton.  But even he is sometimes sentimentally touched by the Vicar's nontraditional ideas.  It also has running gags like the agricultural humor in the opening, the jokes between the Vicar and Alice after the credits, and Jim Trott's ""No, no no no no.""""Arrival""--The 102-year old Reverend Pottle dies at the end of a dry, boring sermon to a handful of parishioners.  The Chair of the Dibley Parish Council, David Horton, wants a replacement who is younger and will shape things up to his conservative tastes.  He is surprised to meet the new Vicar who is a self-described ""babe with a bobcat and a magnificent bosom"" who has more progressive ideas for the church.  Good episode, but the scene about taking notes on the council dragged a bit.""Songs of Praise""--St. Barnabas is chosen for the BBC religious program ""Songs of Praise.""  The opening council meeting is very funny in this one.  Both the Vicar and David fall for BBC employees.  It is kind of weird seeing the Vicar googly eyed over a man.  The collar she wears always makes me think of a priest, but she is a Protestant Vicar and can marry.  The ending to this episode is classic.  I also like David's line, ""Most of them [employees of the BBC] are so homosexual they make John Inman [Mr. Humphries from ""Are You Being Served?""] look like Jean-Claude Van Damme.""""Community Spirit""--The Vicar wants to bring in more money from the Autumn Fair and becomes starry eyed when she finds out Alice's cousin is Reg Dwight (aka Elton John).  Then she discovers he is just a bloke named Reg Dwight.  No worries, another celebrity saves the day.  Favorite line: ""If you do this, no matter what you do on earth: sex, drugs, ritual Satanism, I can get unto you the best seat in heaven.""""The Window and the Weather""--There's a storm sparking a dialogue at the council meeting about past great storms which dragged a bit until David popped in with a sarcastic quip.  The stained glass window, however, was not saved as it was smashed by a tree.  The Vicar tries to get the money for a replacement window from one of David's wealthy investor friends who looks quite a bit like Bryan Ferry (hubba, hubba).  The ending is quite touching.""Election""--The council meeting at the beginning of this episode with the note recorder reading in shorthand is hilarious.  David Horton is running as the incumbent for the district council but is out for his own interests (i.e. a golf course and travel) rather than the interests of the community (i.e. buses).  The Vicar is out to change that.""Animals""--The Vicar gets the idea to hold a sermon where animals are allowed in the church.  David believes she's finally lost it and tries to get her fired.  With the tabloids after her and her job on the line, the Vicar begins to have doubts herself.  I thought this storyline was a bit far fetched even for this show, especially when the skinhead arrives with the dog named Satan.  Still, it was handled well at the end and even David was impressed.",4,"""instead you got a babe with a bobcat and a magnificent bosom""--Vicar Geraldine Granger",1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,3914,"['watched', 'season', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', 'watching', 'Father', 'Ted', 'series', 'Brits', 'seem', 'like', 'sitcoms', 'religious', 'figures', 'Father', 'Ted', 'lot', 'more', 'slapstick', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', 'have', 'usual', 'British', 'irreverent', 'humor', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', 'also', 'more', 'touching', 'reverent', 'moments', 'Father', 'Ted', 'straight-up', 'irreverent', 'priest', 'doing', 'very', 'little', 'priest', 'work', 'Geraldine', 'Granger', 'Dawn', 'French', 'actually', 'seen', 'conducting', 'services', 'portrayed', 'very', 'competent', 'vicar', 'very', 'progressive', 'not', 'adverse', 'off-color', 'remarks', 'Father', 'Ted', 'contrast', 'have', 'little', 'respect', 'profession', 'Father', 'Ted', 'more', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', 'also', 'moments', 'not', 'quite', 'in-your-face', 'Actually', 'most', 'funniest', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'straight', 'man', 'show', 'nonsense', 'perennial', 'party-pooper', 'David', 'Horton', 'even', 'sometimes', 'sentimentally', 'touched', 'Vicar', 'nontraditional', 'ideas', 'also', 'running', 'gags', 'agricultural', 'humor', 'opening', 'jokes', 'Vicar', 'Alice', 'credits', 'Jim', 'Trott', 'No', 'Arrival', '102-year', 'old', 'Reverend', 'Pottle', 'end', 'dry', 'boring', 'sermon', 'handful', 'parishioners', 'Chair', 'Dibley', 'Parish', 'Council', 'David', 'Horton', 'replacement', 'who', 'younger', 'will', 'shape', 'things', 'up', 'conservative', 'tastes', 'surprised', 'meet', 'new', 'Vicar', 'who', 'self-described', 'babe', 'bobcat', 'magnificent', 'bosom', 'who', 'more', 'progressive', 'ideas', 'church', 'Good', 'episode', 'scene', 'taking', 'notes', 'council', 'dragged', 'bit', 'Songs', 'Praise', 'St.', 'Barnabas', 'chosen', 'BBC', 'religious', 'program', 'Songs', 'Praise', 'opening', 'council', 'meeting', 'very', 'funny', 'one', 'Vicar', 'David', 'fall', 'BBC', 'employees', 'kind', 'weird', 'seeing', 'Vicar', 'googly', 'eyed', 'man', 'collar', 'always', 'think', 'priest', 'Protestant', 'Vicar', 'can', 'marry', 'ending', 'episode', 'classic', 'also', 'like', 'David', 'line', 'Most', '[', 'employees', 'BBC', ']', 'are', 'so', 'homosexual', 'make', 'John', 'Inman', 'Mr.', 'Humphries', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', ']', 'look', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Community', 'Spirit', 'Vicar', 'bring', 'more', 'money', 'Autumn', 'Fair', 'starry', 'eyed', 'when', 'out', 'Alice', 'cousin', 'Reg', 'Dwight', 'aka', 'Elton', 'John', 'Then', 'just', 'bloke', 'named', 'Reg', 'Dwight', 'No', 'worries', 'celebrity', 'day', 'Favorite', 'line', 'do', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'earth', 'sex', 'drugs', 'ritual', 'Satanism', 'can', 'get', 'best', 'seat', 'heaven', 'Window', 'Weather', 'storm', 'sparking', 'dialogue', 'council', 'meeting', 'past', 'great', 'storms', 'dragged', 'bit', 'David', 'popped', 'sarcastic', 'quip', 'stained', 'glass', 'window', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'saved', 'was', 'smashed', 'tree', 'Vicar', 'tries', 'get', 'money', 'replacement', 'window', 'one', 'David', 'wealthy', 'investor', 'friends', 'who', 'quite', 'bit', 'Bryan', 'Ferry', 'hubba', 'hubba', 'ending', 'quite', 'touching', 'Election', 'council', 'meeting', 'beginning', 'episode', 'note', 'recorder', 'reading', 'shorthand', 'hilarious', 'David', 'Horton', 'running', 'incumbent', 'district', 'council', 'out', 'own', 'interests', 'i.e', 'golf', 'course', 'travel', 'rather', 'interests', 'community', 'i.e', 'buses', 'Vicar', 'out', 'change', 'Animals', 'Vicar', 'idea', 'hold', 'sermon', 'where', 'animals', 'are', 'allowed', 'church', 'David', 'finally', 'lost', 'get', 'fired', 'tabloids', 'job', 'line', 'Vicar', 'have', 'doubts', 'thought', 'storyline', 'was', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'even', 'show', 'especially', 'when', 'skinhead', 'dog', 'named', 'Satan', 'Still', 'was', 'handled', 'well', 'end', 'even', 'David', 'was', 'impressed']",N/A

Unfortunately, most are tired retreads of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" or O. Henry's ""Gift of the Magi"".Not so, VICAR OF DIBLEY.  Instead of going for these obviously derivative storylines, the ""Winter"" episode takes its cue from a much less comically rich source: the book of Matthew.  Somehow, this tape finds a way to tread between high Christian tradition and human foible--and still be very, very funny.  Like every episode of the series, there is humor to be found pretty much everywhere in the fine ensemble cast, but most is derived from the interaction of the long-suffering but gentle Vicar Geraldine and her confidently dimwitted gal pal, Alice.  Some of the humor here, too, will be familiar to anyone who's ever had to organize a church or school play using less-than-Oscar-winning actors.Wihout giving away the clever plot, it's fair to say that this episode works on at least two levels.  For the family looking for a new holiday story that is respectful of Christian tradition, yet emblematic of the modern Church of England/Episcopal Church, this is definitely your gig.  It's also a great buy for lovers of character-based British comedy, Christmas-themed or no.That being said, it should be noted that some more conservative Christians may well challenge the notion of female church leadership (even though it's a fact of life in the C of E), and will balk even more at the other episode on the tape, in which the Vicar enjoys, then regrets, a pre-marital affair.  Though there's really nothing on a sex or violence scale to offend in ""Winter"", some parents may wish to preview the tape before letting their children watch it.  Non-Christians may not want to expose their children to a story so obviously steeped in Christian tradition.Of course, from my perspective, there's nothing that children need to be shielded from here, especially in the Christmas episode.  The series is not afraid to make strong statements of faith, but it doesn't do so didactically.  impressively, Geraldine's humorous, but firm, defense of Christmas as ""the greatest story ever told&quot; is a fine example of how to live one's faith--whatever It might be--with joy.",5,Get this for Christmas,973382400,"11 5, 2000",2000,2275,"['When', 'Christmas', 'around', 'television', 'show', 'produce', 'holiday-themed', 'episode', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'are', 'tired', 'retreads', 'Dickens', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'O.', 'Henry', 'Gift', 'Magi', '.Not', 'so', 'VICAR', 'OF', 'DIBLEY', 'Instead', 'going', 'obviously', 'derivative', 'storylines', 'Winter', 'episode', 'cue', 'much', 'less', 'comically', 'rich', 'source', 'book', 'Matthew', 'Somehow', 'tape', 'way', 'tread', 'high', 'Christian', 'tradition', 'human', 'foible', 'still', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'episode', 'series', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'pretty', 'much', 'everywhere', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'most', 'derived', 'interaction', 'long-suffering', 'gentle', 'Vicar', 'Geraldine', 'confidently', 'dimwitted', 'gal', 'pal', 'Alice', 'humor', 'here', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'organize', 'church', 'school', 'play', 'using', 'less-than-Oscar-winning', 'giving', 'away', 'clever', 'plot', 'fair', 'say', 'episode', 'least', 'two', 'levels', 'family', 'looking', 'new', 'holiday', 'story', 'respectful', 'Christian', 'tradition', 'yet', 'emblematic', 'modern', 'Church', 'England/Episcopal', 'Church', 'definitely', 'gig', 'also', 'great', 'buy', 'lovers', 'character-based', 'British', 'comedy', 'Christmas-themed', 'being', 'said', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'more', 'conservative', 'Christians', 'may', 'well', 'challenge', 'notion', 'female', 'church', 'leadership', 'even', 'fact', 'life', 'C', 'E', 'will', 'balk', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'episode', 'tape', 'Vicar', 'then', 'pre-marital', 'affair', 'really', 'nothing', 'sex', 'violence', 'scale', 'offend', 'Winter', 'parents', 'may', 'wish', 'preview', 'tape', 'letting', 'children', 'watch', 'Non-Christians', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'expose', 'children', 'story', 'so', 'obviously', 'steeped', 'Christian', 'tradition.Of', 'course', 'perspective', 'nothing', 'children', 'need', 'be', 'shielded', 'here', 'especially', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'series', 'not', 'afraid', 'make', 'strong', 'statements', 'faith', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'didactically', 'impressively', 'Geraldine', 'humorous', 'firm', 'defense', 'Christmas', 'greatest', 'story', 'ever', 'told', 'quot', 'fine', 'example', 'how', 'live', 'one', 'faith', 'might', 'be', 'joy']",N/A

553487,A23IOPI0D1OG7V,B00004W21V,"WILLIE A YOUNG II ""willow""","[10, 12]","This is, quite possibly the greatest British Comedy Series ever produced.  Dawn French is nothing short of brilliant as Geraldine Granger and the wacky natives of Dibley are the perfect compliment to her level-headed, straight shooting and compassionate vicar. Of special note is Emma Thompson who is note perfect as the sweet but dimwitted Alice Tinker, and Roger Lloyd Pack as Owen (bugger!) the lonely, cynical and hysterical farmer! The rest of the cast is outstanding as well and have such fantastic comedic timing and rapport from episode 1 that they seem to have worked together for years prior to the series. Choosing a favorite episode is particularly difficult considering the top-notch quality of the show, EVERYTHING about &quot;The Vicar...&quot; works, from the writing, acting and lush direction, to the priceless interchange between Geraldine and Alice during the closing joke segments. I do have one favorite closing, you know the one when Geri tells her weekly joke to David Horton (the superb Gary Waldhorn) and he looks her in the eyes sincerely and says simply 'stay'. It's a beautiful, genuine moment that closes a classic episode in which Geri struggles with a decision to leave the village after marrying Alice and Hugo. All of this has been my roundabout way of saying, for great comedy, British or otherwise, &quot;The Vicar Of Dibley&quot; is the best you'll ever find.
