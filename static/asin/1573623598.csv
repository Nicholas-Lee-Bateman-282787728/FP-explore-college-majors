189350,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,1573623598,A customer,"[2, 2]","This might have been a straight to video movie.  I had never heard of it, and the DVD case certainly looks to be a video store attempt to hook you into a stinker (using a picture of Dermont Mulroney on it and listing him as a star on the cover is beyond a stretch for the cameo he has in the film). You could call this a B-movie though really only in the sense it is certainly not a big budget film. Its lack of money never detracts however, and other than that it is top notch in every way.  Also ignore the official ""Amazon Review"" and pay more attention to the others here.  This movie is quirky, fun, memorable, and poignant all at the same time. More importantly, it's almost 100% unique, a rarity to find for those who want something different but still accessible and entertaining.Besides John Turturro, the other actor in the movie who turns in a great performance and nearly steals the show is Sam Rockwell.  I was more familiar with him from a small role inIn the Soup, but his ""off the grid"" character, who lives in the woods in a sawed in half mobile home (lengthwise), eating tomatos from neighbor's gardens and selling stolen garden gnomes for junk food money becomes the life of the party. He is primarilly supposed to be a contrast to Turturro's straight laced character, but he easily moves beyond a supporting cast role and ends up in several of the movie's more memorable scenes.  From the moment Turturro's character offers him auto assistance on the side of the road and links their cars together, both literally and figuratively, the movie really takes off into an unchartered direction that is definitely worth the trip.I won't go into any spoilers here, but essentially it is a film about someone who has taken his life a little too seriously and finds out when he returns to a kitcshy old vacation town that he went to as a child that there is more to life than he thinks there is. He goes ""native"" enough that you wonder if he will ever go home, especially with Rockwell hiding his rental car keys and inventing other reasons for him to stay. With a strained marriage, a few young women including the charismatic Catherine Keener from movies such asOut of Sight [Blu-ray] also present him with challenges and opportunities for his personal growth. Will he learn what being part of a real family is all about?You'll easily like this film much better then the 10 other highly acclaimed movies you thought you were going to like this year and ended up disappointed in.",5,One of the funnest movies you've never heard of,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,2491,"['might', 'have', 'been', 'straight', 'video', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'DVD', 'case', 'certainly', 'be', 'video', 'store', 'attempt', 'hook', 'stinker', 'using', 'picture', 'Dermont', 'Mulroney', 'listing', 'star', 'cover', 'stretch', 'cameo', 'film', 'could', 'call', 'B-movie', 'really', 'only', 'sense', 'certainly', 'not', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'lack', 'money', 'never', 'however', 'other', 'top', 'notch', 'way', 'Also', 'ignore', 'official', 'Amazon', 'Review', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'others', 'here', 'movie', 'quirky', 'fun', 'memorable', 'poignant', 'same', 'time', 'More', 'importantly', 'almost', '100', '%', 'unique', 'rarity', 'find', 'who', 'want', 'something', 'different', 'still', 'accessible', 'John', 'Turturro', 'other', 'actor', 'movie', 'who', 'great', 'performance', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'was', 'more', 'familiar', 'small', 'role', 'inIn', 'Soup', 'grid', 'character', 'who', 'woods', 'sawed', 'half', 'mobile', 'home', 'lengthwise', 'eating', 'tomatos', 'neighbor', 'gardens', 'selling', 'stolen', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'junk', 'food', 'money', 'life', 'party', 'primarilly', 'supposed', 'be', 'contrast', 'Turturro', 'straight', 'laced', 'character', 'easily', 'supporting', 'cast', 'role', 'up', 'several', 'movie', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'moment', 'Turturro', 'character', 'auto', 'assistance', 'side', 'road', 'links', 'cars', 'together', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'movie', 'really', 'off', 'unchartered', 'direction', 'definitely', 'worth', 'trip.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'spoilers', 'here', 'essentially', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'taken', 'life', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'out', 'when', 'kitcshy', 'old', 'vacation', 'town', 'went', 'child', 'more', 'life', 'native', 'enough', 'wonder', 'will', 'ever', 'go', 'home', 'especially', 'Rockwell', 'hiding', 'rental', 'car', 'keys', 'inventing', 'other', 'reasons', 'stay', 'strained', 'marriage', 'few', 'young', 'women', 'including', 'charismatic', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'movies', 'such', 'Sight', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'also', 'present', 'challenges', 'opportunities', 'personal', 'growth', 'Will', 'learn', 'what', 'being', 'part', 'real', 'family', ""'ll"", 'easily', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'then', '10', 'other', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'movies', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'like', 'year', 'ended', 'up', 'disappointed']",N/A

189358,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,1573623598,darragh o'donoghue,"[7, 17]","'Box of Moonlight' is Tom DeCillo's attempt to infuse the American indie tradition with Shakespearean pastoral.  As in a Shakespeare comedy like 'A midsummer night's dream' or 'As you like it', a man representing nomrality (in this case electrical engineer Al Fountain, dubbed 'Mr. Clockwork' by his wife, who tortures his son with multiplication tables; who stops his worker's baseball games because there's still fifteen minutes left on the clock; who lets his life be ruled by clocks and dates; who utters aphorisms of a banality even Forrest Gump might balk at) enters a magical forest where the exact opposite of what he believes in reigns, allowing him to reassess his life and the assumptions it is built on.In this case, Al is helped by a figure, Buck/The Kid, who is more Puck than Prospero, a man who has dropped out of the 'grid', who symbolically appears at a 'blind spot' on the ooad just as Al is at his most exasperated.  This weekend away from normality takes place appropriately on a holiday, July 4, with all its connotations of independence.Buck's magic circle is a mixture of mad conspiracy theorist/extremist's den; one of those centres where tired businessmen recharge their batteries; and a typically American inflection on communism.  Buck hates the FBI, shoots at a target marked CIA, refuses to pay his taxes.  Far from offering a collective revolt, Buck indulges in petty thieving and police-baiting, helping himself, while the system remains unchanged.  He doesn't offer a genuine alternative lifetyle - he simply allows Al to bring out his better instincts - helping others, talking to others, taking risks, spending money.Unlike Shakespeare, this is the ultimate male fantasy.  Women exist, their pain is even acknowledged, but this is Al's refresher weekend, and everything centres on him.  I'm not sure yet whether this is deCillo's ironic prespective on his story, or his own blind spot.  What I am certain about is the clumsiness of his narrative method, his refusal to trust the intelligence of his audience.  for example, at one point, Al stops at a car-rental firm called 'Circle'.  We get it, Al's life and humanity has been reduced to a circular routine.  Just in case we missed it, the camera closes in on car keys with the label 'Circle' on them.  And, for the thickos at the back of the class, he stops on the firm's sign as Al drives off.  I'm not saying the idea of the circle - also referring to the magic circle Al find himself in, and his attempts to turn back the aging process - isn't important.  it's just - trust us!  You don't have to show Al literally playing with fire to suggest he's playing with fire!Visually, the film, in its preference for long shots and a muted green/grey colour spectrum, reminds me of Bob Rafelson's classic 'Five Easy Pieces', another film that begins on a building sight, and has its hero taking journeys in which he questions his ideas of 'home'.  In terms of quality and impact, however, the only real comparison is in the acting.  John Turturro gives another incredible performance, deceptively simple, unshowy: he is one of the few actors so recognisably human you could justifiably call him an Everyman.",2,"Fabulous lead performance, disappointing film.",1001635200,"09 28, 2001",2001,3189,"[""'Box"", 'Moonlight', 'Tom', 'DeCillo', 'attempt', 'infuse', 'American', 'indie', 'tradition', 'Shakespearean', 'pastoral', 'Shakespeare', 'comedy', 'midsummer', 'night', 'dream', 'man', 'representing', 'nomrality', 'case', 'electrical', 'engineer', 'Al', 'Fountain', 'dubbed', 'Clockwork', 'wife', 'who', 'son', 'multiplication', 'tables', 'who', 'worker', 'baseball', 'games', 'still', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'left', 'clock', 'who', 'life', 'be', 'ruled', 'clocks', 'dates', 'who', 'aphorisms', 'banality', 'even', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'might', 'balk', 'magical', 'forest', 'where', 'exact', 'opposite', 'what', 'reigns', 'allowing', 'reassess', 'life', 'assumptions', 'built', 'case', 'Al', 'helped', 'figure', 'Buck/The', 'Kid', 'who', 'more', 'Puck', 'Prospero', 'man', 'who', 'dropped', ""'grid"", 'who', 'symbolically', ""'blind"", 'spot', 'ooad', 'just', 'Al', 'most', 'exasperated', 'weekend', 'away', 'normality', 'place', 'appropriately', 'holiday', 'July', '4', 'connotations', 'independence.Buck', 'magic', 'circle', 'mixture', 'mad', 'conspiracy', 'theorist/extremist', 'den', 'one', 'centres', 'where', 'tired', 'businessmen', 'recharge', 'batteries', 'typically', 'American', 'inflection', 'communism', 'Buck', 'FBI', 'shoots', 'target', 'marked', 'CIA', 'pay', 'taxes', 'Far', 'offering', 'collective', 'revolt', 'Buck', 'petty', 'thieving', 'police-baiting', 'helping', 'system', 'unchanged', ""n't"", 'offer', 'genuine', 'alternative', 'lifetyle', 'simply', 'Al', 'bring', 'out', 'better', 'instincts', 'helping', 'others', 'talking', 'others', 'taking', 'risks', 'spending', 'money.Unlike', 'Shakespeare', 'ultimate', 'male', 'fantasy', 'Women', 'exist', 'pain', 'even', 'acknowledged', 'Al', 'refresher', 'weekend', 'everything', 'centres', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'yet', 'deCillo', 'ironic', 'prespective', 'story', 'own', 'blind', 'spot', 'What', 'am', 'certain', 'clumsiness', 'narrative', 'method', 'refusal', 'trust', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'Al', 'car-rental', 'firm', 'called', ""'Circle"", 'get', 'Al', 'life', 'humanity', 'been', 'reduced', 'circular', 'routine', 'Just', 'case', 'missed', 'camera', 'car', 'keys', 'label', ""'Circle"", 'thickos', 'back', 'class', 'firm', 'sign', 'Al', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'idea', 'circle', 'also', 'referring', 'magic', 'circle', 'Al', 'find', 'attempts', 'turn', 'back', 'aging', 'process', ""n't"", 'important', 'just', 'trust', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'show', 'Al', 'literally', 'playing', 'fire', 'suggest', 'playing', 'fire', 'Visually', 'film', 'preference', 'long', 'shots', 'muted', 'green/grey', 'colour', 'spectrum', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'classic', ""'Five"", 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'film', 'building', 'sight', 'hero', 'taking', 'journeys', 'questions', 'ideas', ""'home"", 'terms', 'quality', 'impact', 'however', 'only', 'real', 'comparison', 'acting', 'John', 'Turturro', 'incredible', 'performance', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'unshowy', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'so', 'recognisably', 'human', 'could', 'justifiably', 'call', 'Everyman']",N/A

He's generally considered an ""a--hole"" by the guys, but actually he's simply an insecure, middle-class business type who's supporting his conventional family in suburbia. He very much wants to be liked but has a job to do. He's much like you and me.The next morning he notices his first gray hair. This sets off internal alarm bells deep within his psyche. He realizes his life is passing him by. Is he really living? Time only moves forward, not backward.The job he's working on ends early, so Al decides to take his bonus money and do something unconventional for a change. He goes on a hunt for a boyhood amusement park in the middle of nowhere. From this search comes an unexpected meeting with ""The Kid"" (Sam Rockwell), a young man living off the grid in an abandoned trailer. The kid amazes Al. The kid is a free spirit, a good soul, who is utterly indifferent to the rules Al and society live by. He becomes a catalyst for Al to delve into himself and find what he's been missing for so many years.This movie is well acted and directed. It has the feel of a Coen brothers flick: unconventional, a bit mad, and highly entertaining. The ""locals"" also add a nice touch of realism. And John Turturro is perfectly cast as the uptight, out of touch, insecure Al who lends a helping hand, but finds he too is helped in more ways than he could ever imagine.Pick this one up.

Story is based on a  friendship between two people who come together with the trick of the  faith. Story is well told by the director and the camera.

189368,A1NF3VPMUFHRCC,1573623598,"Literary Lass ""neocat_08840""","[13, 20]","Al Fountain, as played by John Turturro, is the ultimate conformist: rigid in manner, square in wardrobe (pressed pants and button-down white shirt), and unable to blur the line between his middle-management status and his labor crew. Cocksure that he is a fount of wise epithets, he drives the backroads in his rental car barking out clever epigrams--actually middling self-help rules for success. Though he might fancy himself published in Bartlett's one day, his middle-brow musings are more Reader's Digest.On a dusty, unfamiliar road, Al very nearly collides with &quot;the Kid.&quot; As played by Sam Rockwell,this buckskin-clad fellow is part Johnny Appleseed, part Peter Pan, and part Al Fountain's own repressed inner child. Fountain scolds &quot;the Kid&quot; for having recklessly stopped his car in a blind spot, and then somehow finds himself accompanying &quot;the Kid&quot; back to his half-built modular home.From this eccentric &quot;meet cute&quot; scenario, Fountain and his new friend are attached at the hip. Al is taught to tear off his tie, unbutton his shirt, and, most disturbingly, loosen his morals. I enjoyed watching the give-and-take between Turturro and Rockwell. They're both acting their hearts out as a man without a clue and a man without a career, respectively. Each one lacks an essential personality trait--Fountain has no youth (ha,ha), no humor, no spontaneity. Buck, or &quot;the Kid,&quot; has no maturity, no daily ties, no stake in society. This is really an Indie cult variation on &quot;Freaky Friday.&quot; You just know that both of these guys are going to learn to walk in one another's shoes by the film's end.It's a fun, leisurely paced movie. The acting is precious, and Catherine Keener and Lisa Blount make brief appearances as two nubile and neurotic admirers of Buck and Al. The Keener character is particularly &quot;odd,&quot; her eccentricity nearly borders on being socially/emotionally disturbed. When she and Al Fountain do hook up to engage in one night of monkey business, the audience is meant to delight in Fountain's final liberation, his ultimate escape from clock-punching conservatism.However, Al's long-suffering wife and sad,little son have appeared throughout the film as supporting players, waiting back at home to get phone calls from their on-the-road breadwinner. What a shame that in order to escape the rat race, Al Fountain had to become a rat.Despite Turturro's and Keener's characters meeting against the backdrop of a July 4 cookout, there are no fireworks  between them. They don't have an immediate, hot, burning connection. It's as if Fountain has stumbled across a willing and ready accomplice, so he goes for it.Rather sad that one of the final memories of this film is the Al character cheating on his family and then heading home to join them--of course, he's supposedly a more joyful, more relaxed, more understanding guy. I guess that's the recipe for a long and happy marriage in director DiCillo's eyes: If a husband is feeling confined and misunderstood, take a week away from the homefront and find a cute chippie. You can face the battle-axe and the offspring with refreshed energy.I'm taking two stars away from this amiable, engaging film because it doesn't show Turturro embracing a newfound, better self. Instead, it showcases him as a new man with a secretive, unforgivable action. He doesn't go back to his family with just a box of moonlight; he returns with the beginning suitcase of emotional baggage.",3,It Pales Toward the End,1048723200,"03 27, 2003",2003,3507,"['Al', 'Fountain', 'played', 'John', 'Turturro', 'ultimate', 'conformist', 'rigid', 'manner', 'square', 'wardrobe', 'pressed', 'pants', 'button-down', 'white', 'shirt', 'unable', 'blur', 'line', 'middle-management', 'status', 'labor', 'crew', 'Cocksure', 'fount', 'wise', 'epithets', 'backroads', 'rental', 'car', 'barking', 'out', 'clever', 'epigrams', 'actually', 'middling', 'self-help', 'rules', 'success', 'might', 'fancy', 'published', 'Bartlett', 'one', 'day', 'middle-brow', 'musings', 'are', 'more', 'Reader', 'Digest.On', 'dusty', 'unfamiliar', 'road', 'Al', 'very', 'nearly', 'collides', 'quot', 'Kid.', 'quot', 'played', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'buckskin-clad', 'fellow', 'part', 'Johnny', 'Appleseed', 'part', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'part', 'Al', 'Fountain', 'own', 'repressed', 'inner', 'child', 'Fountain', 'scolds', 'quot', 'Kid', 'quot', 'having', 'recklessly', 'stopped', 'car', 'blind', 'spot', 'then', 'somehow', 'accompanying', 'quot', 'Kid', 'quot', 'back', 'half-built', 'modular', 'home.From', 'eccentric', 'quot', 'cute', 'quot', 'scenario', 'Fountain', 'new', 'friend', 'are', 'attached', 'hip', 'Al', 'taught', 'tear', 'off', 'tie', 'unbutton', 'shirt', 'most', 'disturbingly', 'loosen', 'morals', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'give-and-take', 'Turturro', 'Rockwell', ""'re"", 'acting', 'hearts', 'out', 'man', 'clue', 'man', 'career', 'respectively', 'one', 'essential', 'personality', 'trait', 'Fountain', 'youth', 'ha', 'ha', 'humor', 'spontaneity', 'Buck', 'quot', 'Kid', 'quot', 'maturity', 'daily', 'ties', 'stake', 'society', 'really', 'Indie', 'cult', 'variation', 'quot', 'Freaky', 'Friday.', 'quot', 'just', 'know', 'guys', 'are', 'going', 'learn', 'walk', 'one', 'shoes', 'film', 'end.It', 'fun', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'movie', 'acting', 'precious', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Lisa', 'Blount', 'make', 'brief', 'appearances', 'two', 'nubile', 'neurotic', 'admirers', 'Buck', 'Al', 'Keener', 'character', 'particularly', 'quot', 'quot', 'eccentricity', 'nearly', 'borders', 'being', 'socially/emotionally', 'disturbed', 'When', 'Al', 'Fountain', 'do', 'hook', 'up', 'engage', 'one', 'night', 'monkey', 'business', 'audience', 'meant', 'delight', 'Fountain', 'final', 'liberation', 'ultimate', 'escape', 'clock-punching', 'conservatism.However', 'Al', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'sad', 'little', 'son', 'have', 'appeared', 'film', 'supporting', 'players', 'waiting', 'back', 'home', 'get', 'phone', 'calls', 'on-the-road', 'breadwinner', 'What', 'shame', 'order', 'escape', 'rat', 'race', 'Al', 'Fountain', 'had', 'become', 'rat.Despite', 'Turturro', 'Keener', 'characters', 'meeting', 'backdrop', 'July', '4', 'cookout', 'are', 'fireworks', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'immediate', 'hot', 'burning', 'connection', 'Fountain', 'stumbled', 'willing', 'ready', 'accomplice', 'it.Rather', 'sad', 'one', 'final', 'memories', 'film', 'Al', 'character', 'cheating', 'family', 'then', 'heading', 'home', 'join', 'course', 'supposedly', 'more', 'joyful', 'more', 'relaxed', 'more', 'understanding', 'guy', 'guess', 'recipe', 'long', 'happy', 'marriage', 'director', 'DiCillo', 'eyes', 'husband', 'feeling', 'confined', 'misunderstood', 'take', 'week', 'away', 'homefront', 'find', 'cute', 'chippie', 'can', 'face', 'battle-axe', 'offspring', 'refreshed', 'energy.I', ""'m"", 'taking', 'two', 'stars', 'away', 'amiable', 'engaging', 'film', ""n't"", 'show', 'Turturro', 'embracing', 'newfound', 'better', 'self', 'Instead', 'new', 'man', 'secretive', 'unforgivable', 'action', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'family', 'just', 'box', 'moonlight', 'beginning', 'suitcase', 'emotional', 'baggage']",N/A

Immediately, we recognize who and what he is:  The Boss; obsessive and meticulous about the work, tenacious  in regard to detail.  At the same time, it  is obvious that he is sorely  lacking when it comes to his relationship with his crew. Not that he is a  bad guy; neither overbearing nor abusive with his employees, he is, in  fact, somewhat personable in his own way.  It's just that everything in his  vision is so clearly cut in black and white.  In the world of Al Fountain  there are absolutely no shades of gray.  This is further established when  he phones his wife and young son to check in and give her an update on the  job.  When he tells her that one of the guys has invited him to play poker  that night (much to the chagrin of the rest of the crew), she is ecstatic  and encourages him to go.  Clearly, she loves him, but knows how he is.  When he quizzes his son on his multiplication tables and the response is  unacceptable, flash cards are ordered.  When Dad gets home there will be  another quiz. In a brilliant metaphor, we see the flash cards as they are  perceived by the boy; they are huge, nearly as big as he is, Marley's  chains he must carry wherever he goes without respite.  When the job is  abruptly closed down, Al finds himself with some time to reflect on his  life, which he uncharacteristically embraces, prompted by an incident at  the poker game the previous evening.  At this point the story really  begins, and we follow Al on a drive through the country, which ultimately  becomes a journey of self-discovery.  Along the way he meets ""The Kid,""  (Sam Rockwell), a charismatic, though somewhat naive young man who lives  alone in the remnants of a trailer situated on a secluded parcel of land  far off the beaten path.  It is a lifestyle that Al, initially, simply  cannot comprehend.  When The Kid explains that he lives ""off the grid,"" it  is beyond anything Al can fathom.  In the end, this movie is a textured  tale of awareness and the importance of setting one's personal priorities.  Extremely well presented and acted, it is touching and poignant without the  unnecessary burden (in this case) of undue sentiment.  The supporting cast  includes Catherine Keener, Lisa Blount, Annie Corley and Dermot Mulroney.

189373,AWUUMER0F3WF4,1573623598,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","Al Fountain (John Turturro) is Mr. Every Day while losing his youth in a humdrum existence.  He is the ""electrical"" engineer, definitely stressing this point while his crew on the job pretty much despise him. Al stares at the clock on the wall, or at his watch all of the time bent on catching them being unproductive, and he eventually does. I guess this would be the high point of Al's overly structured and boring life, that is until he spies a gray hair hit his foot and then slip down the shower drain one morning.  Along with that single hair spiraling downward are his irresponsible boyhood days that no longer have a chance of coming back. He now leads a conventional life in a mutually felt stale marriage.  He doesn't seem to take any interest in his ignored wife, or could-care-less young son any longer.  He very much desires to be liked by the men who work for him, he neither fits in nor will he be, totally stuffy in his tight white collar.  I suppose, concerning Al, the blue collars just don't work well with him any longer.The job he has been working on suddenly ends, causing an inward panic in Al. He takes all of his bonus money from all his working and takes off to find the remote place in the country where life was actually fun in his childhood. A mysterious and laid back place, Splashy (actually named ""Splatchee"") Lake, where he was able to be a kid not all buttoned-up like now.  An amusement park type swimming place complete with a slide and sunny days.  This all sounds way too good to be true for Al now.  While driving toward the lake he just misses getting into an accident with a completely odd man whose car broke down in the middle of the road, a guy possessing many names but just goes by ""Kid"" (Sam Rockwell). He wears a replicated suit of Daniel Boone which he liked so well he just took it. Kid also steals Swedish garden gnomes and deer statues to sell, including many other eccentric things.  The things of Kid's outlandish and over-the-top life make Al's skin crawl at first; such as Kid stating that he is living totally ""Off of the grid"".Kid is a study in himself, an odd duck, but a completely loveable one in the same breath.  He lives in one half of a trailer that he purchased and that would be the lengthwise side.  You will be amazed at how his place is decorated.  From old Christmas lights to packages of Oreo-type cookies he smashes by the bagful for breakfast then eats with wooden spoons.  Deer statues stuck everywhere out on his land, along with anything that people would throw away, Kid turns into something useful.  He is a wild child/man that never seems to suffer from any unhappiness, especially upon meeting Al who is instant company for him.  The super uptight meets the free spirit becomes their interlude. And for some odd reason after another, Al just cannot seem to get out of there.  Maybe Kid will fill you in on that reason.The writer and director (Tom DiCillo) offers us one moonlit moment after another.  The absolutely gorgeous cinematography (Paul Ryan), along with these two phenomenal actors, show everyone what it means to truly be alive and how to be very aware and appreciative of our oftentimes unnoticed surroundings.  From Kid walking through a field eating red ripe tomatoes right off of the vine, to jumping into the lake without abandon, reservation, or his Daniel Boone duds, he always chooses to live in the moment.  We are treated to a movie that makes magic happen with each and every turn when Al finally lets down his guard.  A Box of Moonlight is just as it is titled, something that cannot necessarily be captured unless you allow your imagination to take more than a fleeting glimpse.",5,"""Hey - Don't Open That, The Moonlight Is Getting Out"" - Kid",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,3683,"['Al', 'Fountain', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Mr.', 'Every', 'Day', 'losing', 'youth', 'humdrum', 'existence', 'electrical', 'engineer', 'definitely', 'stressing', 'point', 'crew', 'job', 'pretty', 'much', 'despise', 'Al', 'clock', 'wall', 'watch', 'time', 'bent', 'catching', 'being', 'unproductive', 'eventually', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'high', 'point', 'Al', 'overly', 'structured', 'boring', 'life', 'gray', 'hair', 'hit', 'foot', 'then', 'slip', 'down', 'shower', 'drain', 'one', 'morning', 'single', 'hair', 'spiraling', 'downward', 'are', 'irresponsible', 'boyhood', 'days', 'longer', 'have', 'chance', 'coming', 'back', 'now', 'conventional', 'life', 'mutually', 'felt', 'stale', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'interest', 'ignored', 'wife', 'could-care-less', 'young', 'son', 'longer', 'very', 'much', 'desires', 'be', 'liked', 'men', 'who', 'work', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'stuffy', 'tight', 'white', 'collar', 'suppose', 'concerning', 'Al', 'blue', 'collars', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'longer.The', 'job', 'been', 'working', 'suddenly', 'ends', 'causing', 'inward', 'panic', 'Al', 'bonus', 'money', 'working', 'find', 'remote', 'place', 'country', 'where', 'life', 'was', 'actually', 'fun', 'childhood', 'mysterious', 'laid', 'back', 'place', 'Splashy', 'actually', 'named', 'Splatchee', 'Lake', 'where', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'kid', 'not', 'buttoned-up', 'now', 'amusement', 'park', 'type', 'swimming', 'place', 'complete', 'slide', 'sunny', 'days', 'way', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Al', 'now', 'driving', 'lake', 'just', 'getting', 'accident', 'completely', 'odd', 'man', 'car', 'broke', 'down', 'middle', 'road', 'guy', 'possessing', 'many', 'names', 'just', 'Kid', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'replicated', 'suit', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'liked', 'so', 'well', 'just', 'took', 'Kid', 'also', 'Swedish', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'deer', 'statues', 'sell', 'including', 'many', 'other', 'eccentric', 'things', 'things', 'Kid', 'outlandish', 'over-the-top', 'life', 'make', 'Al', 'skin', 'crawl', 'first', 'such', 'Kid', 'stating', 'living', 'totally', 'Off', 'grid', '.Kid', 'study', 'odd', 'duck', 'completely', 'loveable', 'one', 'same', 'breath', 'one', 'half', 'trailer', 'purchased', 'would', 'be', 'lengthwise', 'side', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'place', 'decorated', 'old', 'Christmas', 'lights', 'packages', 'Oreo-type', 'cookies', 'bagful', 'breakfast', 'then', 'wooden', 'spoons', 'Deer', 'stuck', 'everywhere', 'out', 'land', 'anything', 'people', 'would', 'throw', 'away', 'Kid', 'something', 'useful', 'wild', 'child/man', 'never', 'suffer', 'unhappiness', 'especially', 'meeting', 'Al', 'who', 'instant', 'company', 'super', 'uptight', 'meets', 'free', 'spirit', 'interlude', 'odd', 'reason', 'Al', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'Maybe', 'Kid', 'will', 'fill', 'reason.The', 'writer', 'director', 'Tom', 'DiCillo', 'one', 'moonlit', 'moment', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'Paul', 'Ryan', 'two', 'phenomenal', 'actors', 'show', 'everyone', 'what', 'truly', 'be', 'alive', 'how', 'be', 'very', 'aware', 'appreciative', 'oftentimes', 'unnoticed', 'surroundings', 'Kid', 'walking', 'field', 'eating', 'red', 'ripe', 'tomatoes', 'right', 'vine', 'jumping', 'lake', 'abandon', 'reservation', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'duds', 'always', 'live', 'moment', 'are', 'treated', 'movie', 'magic', 'happen', 'turn', 'when', 'Al', 'finally', 'down', 'guard', 'Box', 'Moonlight', 'just', 'titled', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'captured', 'allow', 'imagination', 'take', 'more', 'fleeting', 'glimpse']",N/A

It's supposed to be liberating, but Rockwell's Johnny Depp impression quickly outstays its welcome and you have to wonder about Tom DiCillo's notion of freedom (destroying other people's property, cheating on your wife, giving your unsupervised small child fireworks to play with).
