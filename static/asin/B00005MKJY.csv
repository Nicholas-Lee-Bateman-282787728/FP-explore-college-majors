665630,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005MKJY,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave - it's a great title for a movie, isn't it?  Unless you're just slapping that title on the final product and opening the film with a shot of somebody jumping up out of the ground in front of a fake Bruce Lee tombstone, knowing full well that this movie hasn't the first thing to do with Bruce Lee and that it's all just a scheme for making more money by exploiting the name of the legend.  Strangely enough, I don't even mind because I have some sort of obsession with Bruceploitation movies that compels me to watch and usually enjoy any of them I can get hold of.  I do have a problem with the plot summary that usually comes attached to this film, however.  I knew going in that the film had nothing to do with Bruce Lee, but those without such knowledge are told that Bruce comes back and fights the Black Angel of death in some sort of supernatural kung fu story.  Folks, this doesn't happen - no Bruce Lee, no graves, no Black Angel of death.  I can't even be sure of whom the star of this film is.  The actor is billed as Bruce K.L. Lea but is often referred to as Bruce Le; Bruce Le happens to be my favorite Bruce clone, but I can't make the actor in this film look like the Bruce Le I have come to know in other movies.I can't really list any good things about this film, yet for some reason I really enjoyed it.  Our hero Wong Han comes to America to see his old friend and fellow kung fu teacher, only to learn that the guy just committed suicide.  With no place to go, he bunks down in the school, only to be attacked by a great big axe-wielding black man; afterwards, he finds himself at the police station being berated for what he claims is self-defense.  A mystery man bails him out, only to ask Wong to help him find a certain young lady.  Wong refuses, but almost immediately he finds himself saving the girl in question from being raped; it turns out that she just happened to be his dead buddy's employee and only friend.  Deborah Chaplin plays Susan, and I have to say that the lady is just gorgeous and mesmerizing.  Wong's luck seems to be changing as Susan locks on to her new hero.  Of course, bad things are afoot.  Apparently, the Village People or a horrible facsimile thereof were involved in Wong's friend's demise, and these folks keep attacking and kidnapping Susan.  Naturally, Wong has to fight them and find out the truth behind his friend's death.  The plot jumps around like a cat walking on a bed of hot coals, but a surprise or two at the end does offer some proof that a plot of some sort actually did exist.  The ending is quite a downer, I must say.Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave is just weird.  Wong carries around his friend's box of ashes (which sports a big photo of the guy on front) around his neck all over town, for one thing.  The evil quintet of Village People wannabes is downright silly.  The fights aren't bad at all, in my opinion, and there are a good many of them, but the strange relationship between Wong and Susan attracted most of my attention.  Susan is thoroughly taken with Wong, basically locking on to him from the start; there seems to be a little romance on both sides eventually, but it sure isn't your typical kind of relationship.  The weirdest thing of all about this film, though, is the fact that I enjoyed it as much as I did given the fact that the acting is sub-par, the dubbing is awful, and the plot is exceedingly thin in places.",3,A strangely enjoyable film with a grossly misleading title,1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,3454,"['Bruce', 'Lee', 'Fights', 'Back', 'Grave', 'great', 'title', 'movie', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'just', 'slapping', 'title', 'final', 'product', 'opening', 'film', 'shot', 'somebody', 'jumping', 'up', 'ground', 'front', 'fake', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'tombstone', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'movie', ""n't"", 'first', 'thing', 'do', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'just', 'scheme', 'making', 'more', 'money', 'exploiting', 'name', 'legend', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'have', 'sort', 'obsession', 'Bruceploitation', 'movies', 'compels', 'watch', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'can', 'get', 'hold', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'plot', 'summary', 'usually', 'attached', 'film', 'however', 'knew', 'going', 'film', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'such', 'knowledge', 'are', 'told', 'Bruce', 'back', 'Black', 'Angel', 'death', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'kung', 'fu', 'story', 'Folks', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'graves', 'Black', 'Angel', 'death', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'sure', 'whom', 'star', 'film', 'actor', 'billed', 'Bruce', 'K.L', 'Lea', 'often', 'referred', 'Bruce', 'Le', 'Bruce', 'Le', 'be', 'favorite', 'Bruce', 'clone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'actor', 'film', 'look', 'Bruce', 'Le', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'other', 'movies.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'list', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'yet', 'reason', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'hero', 'Wong', 'Han', 'America', 'see', 'old', 'friend', 'fellow', 'kung', 'fu', 'teacher', 'only', 'learn', 'guy', 'just', 'committed', 'suicide', 'place', 'go', 'down', 'school', 'only', 'be', 'attacked', 'great', 'big', 'axe-wielding', 'black', 'man', 'afterwards', 'police', 'station', 'being', 'berated', 'what', 'self-defense', 'mystery', 'man', 'out', 'only', 'ask', 'Wong', 'help', 'find', 'certain', 'young', 'lady', 'Wong', 'refuses', 'almost', 'immediately', 'saving', 'girl', 'question', 'being', 'raped', 'out', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'dead', 'buddy', 'employee', 'only', 'friend', 'Deborah', 'Chaplin', 'Susan', 'have', 'say', 'lady', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'mesmerizing', 'Wong', 'luck', 'be', 'changing', 'Susan', 'new', 'hero', 'course', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'afoot', 'Apparently', 'Village', 'People', 'horrible', 'facsimile', 'thereof', 'were', 'involved', 'Wong', 'friend', 'demise', 'folks', 'keep', 'attacking', 'kidnapping', 'Susan', 'Naturally', 'Wong', 'fight', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'friend', 'death', 'plot', 'cat', 'walking', 'bed', 'hot', 'coals', 'surprise', 'two', 'end', 'offer', 'proof', 'plot', 'sort', 'actually', 'did', 'exist', 'ending', 'quite', 'downer', 'must', 'say.Bruce', 'Lee', 'Fights', 'Back', 'Grave', 'just', 'weird', 'Wong', 'friend', 'box', 'ashes', 'sports', 'big', 'photo', 'guy', 'front', 'neck', 'town', 'one', 'thing', 'evil', 'quintet', 'Village', 'People', 'wannabes', 'downright', 'silly', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'opinion', 'are', 'good', 'many', 'strange', 'relationship', 'Wong', 'Susan', 'attracted', 'most', 'attention', 'Susan', 'thoroughly', 'taken', 'Wong', 'basically', 'locking', 'start', 'there', 'be', 'little', 'romance', 'sides', 'eventually', 'sure', ""n't"", 'typical', 'kind', 'relationship', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'film', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'given', 'fact', 'acting', 'sub-par', 'dubbing', 'awful', 'plot', 'exceedingly', 'thin', 'places']",Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave

665637,A28FO9TRAR77PM,B00005MKJY,SeanLau99,"[1, 2]","I've had Bruce Lee Fights Back From The Grave collecting dust in my attic for several years and finally decided to give it a look. As a seventies child, I use to see great and crappy Kung-Fu films in Downtown Chicago all the time and I remember when this one was out but never saw it. I think I bought it from a Walgreens store for about $2.99 so I didn't waste that much money which is a good thing because this is one of the saddest Brucesploitation flicks ever. As stated in other reviews, this has nothing to do with Bruce Lee's life. Instead, we get Bruce K. Lea (He's actually Korean Martial Artist, Jun Chong) who is one of the sorriest excuses for a hero in motion picture history. Bruce Li and Bruce Le look like Superman and Batman compared to this goof. Basically, he bumbles his way through a lackluster investigation of a fellow Martial Arts instructor's death and gets a poor damsel who befriends him (Deb Chaplin, who still appears in low budget fare) in all kinds of trouble as well. In one scene, He gets her car stolen and watches a parade while she waits outside at night for him to pick her up. She's almost abducted by some creep before our goofy non-hero shows up. In fact, she's eventually snatched, beaten, and ends up paying the ultimate price because she took a liking to this doofus. Oh, and wait until you see the big twist at the end. On second thought, stay away unless you find this turkey in a dollar store. The Kung-Fu is decent but the fight scenes are too short for this type of film. On a positive note, a young Sho Kosugi appears in the best fight scene. Otherwise, this is a trainwreck from start to finish and a fine example of hack filmmakers looking for a quick payday while ripping off Martial Arts movie fans. Even without the slapped on Bruce Lee title, this one stinks. Do laundry or eat fast food for 85 minutes instead of wasting time here.
