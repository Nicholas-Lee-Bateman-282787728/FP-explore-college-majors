My three year old loves to watch his &#34;monkey george&#34; at least once a day. One episode, however, seems to frighten him. The episode where Huntley the dog gets caught and put into a dog pound scares him for some reason (maybe he identifies with Huntley a bit too much). Other than that, you can't beat this educational entertainment for the price.",5,Curious George never dissapoints,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,473,"['Curious', 'George', 'always', 'hit', 'house', 'video', 'compilation', 'Curious', 'George', 'Makes', 'New', 'Friends', 'exception', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'watch', '34', 'monkey', 'george', '34', 'least', 'once', 'day', 'One', 'episode', 'however', 'frighten', 'episode', 'where', 'Huntley', 'dog', 'caught', 'put', 'dog', 'pound', 'reason', 'maybe', 'Huntley', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'educational', 'entertainment', 'price']",N/A
