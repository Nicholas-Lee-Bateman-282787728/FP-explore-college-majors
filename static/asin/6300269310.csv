Elevated to classic status as a tale of alcohol's maddening grip on a marriage, it's two leads-Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick-deliver gut-wrenching, soul-crushing performances, the film is potent for it's exposure of addiction and it's harrowing imagery of the physical and emotional torment it renders.Immediate associations with The Lost Weekend and Leaving Las Vegas are legitimate. Though those two revolve around an individuals alcoholism as opposed to a couples, they do provide a gage of the evolving cinematic vision of addiction, and for their respective times were bold films. Both leads (Milland & Cage) also won Oscars. Lemmon and Remick were both nominated-he lost to Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch (To Kill a Mockingbird), she to Anne Bancroft's Annie Sullivan (The Miracle Worker).I would say too that Days of Wine and Roses succeeds as a tale of the everyman within the social structure, willing and able to climb the ladder, whose alcoholism may have preceeded his occupational necessity to drink, or may not have. Lost amidst the corporation he works for as a p.r. man his lack of definition and satisfaction, clarified by his having to procure (ala The Apartment) young women for his boss' parties, drives him as much into marriage as into alcoholism.Considering this came out in 1962, it must be regarded that a young woman, wholesome and kind, working as a secretary who transforms into a housewife who's parenting suffers for her rapt addiction to booze, who abandons and betrays those closest to her, was a striking and devastating vision.The ending to Days of Wine and Roses is not only bleak, haunting and quiet, it's poetic.",5,...4-5-3...4-3-5...3-5-4...,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,1776,"['witness', 'power', 'great', 'acting', 'understand', 'craft', 'depth', 'form', 'suggest', 'watching', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'Elevated', 'classic', 'status', 'tale', 'alcohol', 'maddening', 'grip', 'marriage', 'two', 'leads-Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Lee', 'Remick-deliver', 'gut-wrenching', 'soul-crushing', 'performances', 'film', 'potent', 'exposure', 'addiction', 'harrowing', 'imagery', 'physical', 'emotional', 'torment', 'renders.Immediate', 'associations', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'are', 'legitimate', 'two', 'revolve', 'individuals', 'alcoholism', 'opposed', 'couples', 'do', 'provide', 'gage', 'evolving', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'addiction', 'respective', 'times', 'were', 'bold', 'films', 'leads', 'Milland', 'Cage', 'also', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Lemmon', 'Remick', 'were', 'nominated-he', 'lost', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Annie', 'Sullivan', 'Miracle', 'Worker', '.I', 'would', 'say', 'too', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'tale', 'everyman', 'social', 'structure', 'willing', 'able', 'climb', 'ladder', 'alcoholism', 'may', 'have', 'preceeded', 'occupational', 'necessity', 'drink', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'Lost', 'corporation', 'p.r', 'man', 'lack', 'definition', 'satisfaction', 'clarified', 'having', 'procure', 'Apartment', 'young', 'women', 'boss', 'parties', 'as', 'much', 'marriage', 'alcoholism.Considering', 'came', 'out', '1962', 'must', 'be', 'regarded', 'young', 'woman', 'wholesome', 'kind', 'working', 'secretary', 'who', 'housewife', 'who', 'parenting', 'suffers', 'rapt', 'addiction', 'booze', 'who', 'abandons', 'betrays', 'closest', 'was', 'striking', 'devastating', 'vision.The', 'ending', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'not', 'only', 'bleak', 'haunting', 'quiet', 'poetic']",N/A

234324,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6300269310,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[8, 9]","THE DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES (1962) is a wonderful film, but this DVD is burdened with an unacceptable Director's Commentary.  This highly successful film was everything Blake Edwards, the director, could have wanted from it; or at least it is according to the many reviews and favorable critical comments I've read over the years.Fresh from the thunderous reception of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, Edwards wisely stuck with Henry Mancini as the movie's musical composer (and whose theme for the movie won Mancini his second Oscar in two years, following TIFFANY's).  For WINE AND ROSES, Edwards took his nearly legendary, trademark style--particularly the insouciant, almost breezy charm of the JFK years as represented in TIFFANY'S--and applied it to subject matter that is anything but screwball in nature:  alcoholism.A boozy, needy P.R. guy (Jack Lemmon) ""meets cute"" and befriends at work a humorous and intelligent, but slightly aloof executive secretary (Lee Remick).  In 1962, words like ""codependency,"" ""enabling"" and ""dysfunctional"" were not in most Americans' vocabulary but we can see them at work here...and at first they seem glamorous because of all the charm.  Lemmon's character grew up the child of itenerant entertainers, and his standards of achievement are largely superficial and visual.  He grew up ""Eatin' peanut butter,"" and wants his life to ""have class,"" whether it's a well-stacked ""doll"" in a cocktail bar, a high standard of living (and drinking), or rounding up a bunch of lovelies as ""entertainment"" for his firm's many clients.But after Lemmon's character meets Remick's, his values begin to change.  Remick's character got her integrity and stubborn faith in self-reliance from her Norwegian-American immigrant father (played with brilliant understatement by Charles Bickford) who, as a small businessman, cannot understand why large corporations need flacks like Lemmon to tint unfortunate events with a rosy hue.  Lemmon's character comes to view his P.R. procurements (correctly) as a kind of glorified pimping.  To get away from that and live a ""classy"" life he takes a lateral move within his firm . . . but is he simply copping out of a more demanding but satisfying career?  While Lemmon's life coping with alcoholism becomes a little easier--at least for a while--what happens to Remick is fatal.  He gets Remick, who ""can't stand the taste of alcohol,"" to drink with him by exploiting her favorite jones, chocolate.  Her first mixed drink is a Brandy Alexander, where the brandy is largely drowned out by Creme de Cacao.Soon, though, Remick likes her hard-stuff straight, and the film itself moves onto the hard realities of two alcoholics' lives.  Things gradually get less and less charming--and more and more on-point with the realities of full-blown alcoholism, until sanity arrives in the form of an Alcholics Anonymous sponsor, played passionately by Jack Klugman.  Lemmon's character accepts the then-novel AA conception of alcoholism as a type of disease, but for Remick cutting down on the drinking is ""just a matter of self-respect and will power.""  What will happen?DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES is an extraordinary film not only for its style and great acting, and the way the charming plot eases us into the nightmare of full-blown alcoholism, but also for its psychological insights.  Every time I see this movie I notice something new:  from the symbolism of the cockroaches that Lemmon tries to aerosol-bomb in his girlfriend's ""roach palace"" of an apartment (look how the middle-class neighbors react); to the fact that Lemmon, whose metaphor for a deprived and rootless upbringing is ""Eatin' peanut butter,"" tries to charm Remick with a box of peanut brittle!  (Didn't Freud say that a present says more about the giver than the recipient?)As such, DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES is an entirely different turn from the documentary-like, ""hard-hitting"" social-issue approach to alcoholism that started showing up in the films of the late Eisenhower period in the Fifties.  Edwards himself, in the film's commentary track, remarks that in the early Sixties people were just beginning to get used to the kind of metaphors carried by the ""roach palace"" sequence.  Unfortunately, that is one of the very few times the director's comments connect with what's going on up on the screen in any significant way.A few minutes into the commentary track, Blake Edwards wonders aloud if maybe he shouldn't have seen his movie fresh, so that he could better structure his comments about it.  I sure wish he had, because most of the rambling, unfocused remarks he makes about his movie are repetitious (""You've gotta remember I myself was an alcoholic then""), or trite (""That's the way it was back then . . . everybody drank""), or irrelevant if sympathetic (""The last time my wife [Julie Andrews] and I saw Lee [Remick] was in the hospital . . ."").  We do hear a little about acting styles, particularly the way Lemmon's comically nebishy persona was harnessed to lighten up a dead-serious theme, but we hear next-to-nothing about the technical aspects of how the film was made.So while THE DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES is a great movie, not a period piece but a charming bittersweet love story about a love that becomes besotten and horrible (yet not without the possibility of redemption), I feel I must downgrade my star-count from a five to a four because of unacceptable bells-and-whistles.  Simply plunking even primary talent like a director or star in front of a film and expecting instant insight is not the way to go for DVD's.  Sadly, this DVD has company; it's just among the worst of a field in which Audio Commentary's relevance, usefulness and anecdotal enjoyment are very catch-as-catch-can propositions.",4,"Edwards'

234326,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300269310,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 11]","I have not seen the original television film from which this was based, but I hear that it was not a comedy in the least.  Now, just because you cast Jack Lemmon doesn't mean you're automatically going to get a comedy, for he'd proven that he could at least attempt to tackle drama, but at this stage in his career he was much more suited for the comedic side of life.  That's why it is so surprising that a film this unsure of whom it really is falls on Lemmon to bring a sense of stability.  He actually manages, above anyone else in the cast, to deliver all that is required of him.  He's witty and funny when needed, charming when needed and dramatically sound when needed.He's the films shining moment.Sadly, in my personal opinion (which I see is very uncommon here), the rest of the film is a mess.  The rest of the performances are either awkward or just incomplete (or seemingly insincere) and the script is so `all over the place' that it's hard to decide just what kind of movie this really wants to be.  I had these same sentiments after watching Scorsese's `Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore', another film that couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama.  It's not that they can't be both, for there are many dramedies that work; black comedies that understand the balance needed between funny and serious.  The issue I have with this film is that it doesn't know how to mesh the two together properly.  It winds up feeling rather awkward, not knowing if we're supposed to laugh or cry and so we just become frustrated.The film tells the story of Joe Clay, a public relations man who enjoys a good stiff drink.  He falls in love and marries Kirsten Arnesen, a spunky young secretary who is not a fan of the drink.  She has an addictive personality though, and so once Clay introduces her to alcohol she is instantly hooked.  They soon realize that, while they can't seem to enjoy themselves sober, their lives are being wrecked by their addiction.  After loosing job after job Joe finds the courage to at least attempt sobering up, but Kirsten finds it increasingly difficult to even contemplate a sober lifestyle.I have a hard time thinking of the subject of addiction as anything less than horrifying, and so the films comedic undertones feel out of place to me.  I also felt that the film's script is rather manipulative in many areas, forcing us to take one viewpoint as apposed to presenting us with an honest portrait.Look at `Trainspotting', a film that centers on the grotesque side of addiction with the element of humor and yet it remains startling and brutally truthful; something I did not find in this film.If not for Lemmon I'd have to say that this was a waste of my time.  Lemmon is so good here.  He gets that balance I was talking about and he sells it rather well.  There is a scene where he is in a drunken rage trying to find a bottle of booze amidst a greenhouse full of potted plants and the scene is almost played out in a comical fashion, which appears almost campy at first, but he makes this switch towards the end of the scene that ties it all together and makes the humor work in an almost horrifying way.  Sadly, the rest of the cast couldn't pull that off.  I found Lee Remick very awkward throughout the entire film.  She couldn't get the comedy down and she fell flat and unrealistic in her dramatic scenes.  It's a shame, because I adored her in `Anatomy of a Murder' and was expecting her to just completely wow me here.  Charles Bickford was almost too serious for the film, so serious that he seemed out of place.  If the film had taken the tone it should have then his performance would have worked, but it just seemed a misfit for what Blake Edwards had going here.It is probably one of Lemmon's finest performances, which is sad because it may be one of his weaker films.The sad thing about the script is that it never really gets to the heart of the issue at hand.  It's a mere surface, no real depth to it.  Maybe it was the times, but it never really got down to the grit of addiction.

Edwards does not restrain himself in showing the utter destruction of life wrought by the bottle.Public relations agent Joe Clay played by Jack Lemmon is an alcoholic, spawned by the rigors of entertaining his clients.  He becomes enamored with the lovely Lee Remick playing secretary of one of his clients, Kirsten Arnesen.  Remick, a wholesome girl and teetotaler is wooed by Lemmon and they eventually marry.  As part of the arrangement Lemmon seduces her to alcohol and they both are now addicted.The resposibility of parenthood does not curb their ugly habit and their lives quickly spiral out of control.  Lemmon proceeds to lose job after job and they deteriorate into a sordid existence.  They make several aborted attempts for sobriety aided by Remicks nurturing father, landscaper Ellis Arnesen played passionately by craggy veteran actor Charles Bickford.Both Remick and Lemmon revert back to drinking with Lemmon winding up straight jacketed in a padded cell in a detox ward.Lemmon aided by Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor Jim Hungerford played by Jack Klugman finally is able to conquer his demons and remain sober.  Remick however at movies end is regretably not ready to follow the same path, foresaking both her marriage and child for the comfort of the bottle.Both Remick and Lemmon give stark and frighteningly realistic acting performances as the unfortunate Mr. & Mrs. Clay.

In 'The Days Of Wine And Roses', a film that repeats all the errors of its famous predecessor, Wilder's 'The Lost Weekend', the various factors that lead Jack Lemmon, and then his wife Lee Remick, to become alcoholics, are clearly illustrated.  He hates the humiliation and pressure of a job where 'public relations officer' is a synonym for 'pimp', and where he has to hustle and lie to market his boss.  He hates himself, and can't face his wife.  He has a social inferiority complex too - his parents were vaudeville performers, not the ideal background for an ambitious executive.  So he drinks.  Because he can't drink alone, he gets his abstemious wife to join him.  He is demoted, and moves to Texas - due to loneliness and the fear of her husband's violent moods, as well as a terror of disappointing a strict father, and possibly because she was a bright career woman reduced to motherhood, she too souses herself.  Director Blake Edwards' camera is often to be found in a god's eye position looking down on his characters, like a judge, or scientist.  By isolating the causes and effects of alcoholism so clearly, the problem can be located, maybe even treated.  Preachy lectures (about not being preachy) and the obligatory Alcoholics Anonymous scene (whose brief is explained at length, as in a public information film) are prominent.  Because Edwards keeps his distance from the characters, we can only look on at them, removed - any joy they personally get from alcohol is made to seem desperate, grotesque and dangerous to us.  Despite the moody photography, the young(ish) stars and the lounge-jazz soundtrack (drowning in moonriverisms), this is the Issue Picture about Alcoholism Stanley Kramer never made.Normally, accuracy in a film never bothers me - the fewer facts clogging up the narrative the better.  But the filmmakers' decision to elucidate or preach has a direct bearing on the movie.  Genuine alcoholism has no clear, direct cause - people usually drift into it imperceptibly for a variety of insignificant,  but accumulative reasons.  There are rarely easily sign-posted, dramatic, 'Meaningful' moments when all is either lost or salvaged.  We never sense with this film the messiness of alcoholism, the smells, the fluids, the desperation, the bleariness, the staleness, the impotence, the shift in outlook or sensibility.  I'm sure the characters feel all these things, but we're not shown them.  Instead, they get to speak Wilder-like epigrams full of irony, word-play, poetic quotations and cogent self-pity.  Remick's decline is signalled by exchanging poetry for cartoons - chucking Ernest Dowson for Tex Avery displays excellent judgement, and the filmmakers' elitist inability to see this suggests what's wrong with 'Roses'.At the time, Lemmon was applauded for his unexpected dramatic prowess, but his character here is an extension of the neurotic, white-collar executives worn down by the rat-race he always played.  Both he and Remick, despite their best and sincere efforts, are phony approximations or genteel impersonations of drunkenness.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","If you're looking for a pick-me-up movie--or even a film with a feel-good resolution--then by all means pass by DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.  The timeless story about a couple floating in a sea of booze, as their lives subsequently unravel, is harsh and bitter; in a word, sobering.  Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick play Joe and Kirsten Clay, an up and coming couple about to pursue the American Dream.  Except Joe can't resist those company martini lunches and after-hours excursions; soon he's convinced Kirsten to join him, and before long the alcohol has taken center stage in their lives--with both in denial there's a problem.  As the couple becomes more dysfunctional, as their lives spin further out of control, Joe realizes they need help; he even climbs on the wagon a time or two, always to fall off at Kirsten's urging.  As the film concludes, Joe realizes he must make a choice--Kirsten, or sobriety.  His decision is, again, in a word, sobering.Lemmon and Remick give excellent performances as the besotted couple, yet had the gushy melodrama been dialed down a notch the story would have been so much more believable.  For example, Joe not only gets drunk--he gets maniacally out of control to the point of violent destruction.  I realize the film's premise is to establish the horrific byproducts of alcoholism, yet the over-the-top antics fall well short of believable (Which certainly doesn't make DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES unique; all films during this era were guilty of offering excessive doses of contrived melodrama.).  Despite such purple-ish production DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES is a powerful and riveting attention-getter.  For a more contemporary, albeit even more somber, portrayal of alcoholism,Leaving Las Vegasis also recommended.D.

It was and remains a truly compelling story of a couple's (played by Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick) descent into alcoholism. There's nothing upbeat about this movie or about how it turns out. Nor is there anything humorous. This is not a movie about a so-called lovable drunk. The characters played by Lemmon and Remick are tragic and pay the consequences of alcoholism through a lost job, an apartment set on fire, failed attempts to stay on the wagon, etc. For those familiar with the classic from the 1940s, &#34;The Lost Weekend,&#34; this is an amazingly realistic portrayal. Some of it is dated, in that medical science knows more about drug and alcohol addiction than was known in 1962, which is when this movie came out.

The golden rule of Hollywood films afterall is, &quot;And they all lived happily ever after,&quot; however, the film cuts no corners in portraying not only the disease of alcoholism, but its complex dynamics within human relationships as the characters in this film eventually transform from lovers to drinking partners who's relationship is the bottle itself.

Instead of showing a snapshot in the life of an alcoholic, like ""Lost Weekend"", for example, ""Days of Wines and Roses"" follows the entire descent of not one, but two characters, into the depths of addiction. The interplay between man and woman and the progress of their relationship allows for the depiction of many aspects of alcoholism: the casual start; the discovery of a new pleasure; how one person can unwillingly lead another to become an alcoholic; the recovery; the belief that it is possible to have an occasional drink after recovery; the relapse; the different ways two people who love each other can deal with the problem and how they can influence one another for good or for bad. Everything is here. And the ending is astonishingly realistic. Instead of the usual message that everything will turn out fine in the end, the movie makes it clear that, once you become an alcoholic, the outcome is uncertain. You may or you may not recover.

But one of the main reasons to watch this wonderful film is the great interaction between Boston natives Jack Lemmon and the late Lee Remick. Lemmon plays busy-body Joe Clay, a very agreeable man who ends acquiring a decidedly UNagreeable habit while pressing flesh with business peers--alcoholism. Joe finds time to court pretty Kirsten (Remick), and she finds herself trying to keep up with Joe and his crazy nightlife. In the span of a couple of months, Kirsten is herself caught in a maze of booze and sleepless nights.Soon, the happy couple are both victimized by their addiction to drink, but are slow to realize it. Slowly, painfully, each scene of their lives is shown to revolve around the bottle; even their time alone is marred by a bottle of champagne.Joe is the first to hit rock bottom. He finds assistance and solace by a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (Jack Klugman). Joe sets his sites on getting his wife free of the disease, but finds it will not be easy.The scenes of Joe going through his final binge are scary indeed. The second half of the film is quite different from the first in mood. It is not pretty to watch such self-destruction, and director Blake Edwards (known for producing much lighter, screwier fare in the late 70's and early 80's) makes his audience feel the pain deeply; he succeeds to the point that we, the audience, can sense some urgency in Edwards' emphasis.There is a tendency for too much preachiness in a story of this magnitude. However, Edwards does a good job in maintaining the plot line, letting IT tell the story. Klugman is a great supporting actor in this film. It's his performance in the second half that gives this film a better than average rating, as the voice of conscience to Joe Clay, setting the stage for the final, inevitable reality.",4,"Hard lessons, but lessons well learned.",976665600,"12 13, 2000",2000,1898,"['quot', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'quot', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'least', 'pleasant', 'movies', 'will', 'ever', 'watch', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'watch', 'wonderful', 'film', 'great', 'interaction', 'Boston', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'late', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Lemmon', 'busy-body', 'Joe', 'Clay', 'very', 'agreeable', 'man', 'who', 'acquiring', 'decidedly', 'UNagreeable', 'habit', 'pressing', 'flesh', 'business', 'peers', 'alcoholism', 'Joe', 'time', 'court', 'pretty', 'Kirsten', 'Remick', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'Joe', 'crazy', 'nightlife', 'span', 'couple', 'months', 'Kirsten', 'caught', 'maze', 'booze', 'sleepless', 'nights.Soon', 'happy', 'couple', 'are', 'victimized', 'addiction', 'drink', 'are', 'slow', 'realize', 'Slowly', 'painfully', 'scene', 'lives', 'shown', 'revolve', 'bottle', 'even', 'time', 'alone', 'marred', 'bottle', 'champagne.Joe', 'first', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'assistance', 'solace', 'member', 'Alcoholics', 'Anonymous', 'Jack', 'Klugman', 'Joe', 'sites', 'getting', 'wife', 'free', 'disease', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easy.The', 'scenes', 'Joe', 'going', 'final', 'binge', 'are', 'scary', 'indeed', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'quite', 'different', 'first', 'mood', 'not', 'pretty', 'watch', 'such', 'self-destruction', 'director', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'known', 'producing', 'much', 'lighter', 'screwier', 'fare', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'audience', 'feel', 'pain', 'deeply', 'point', 'audience', 'can', 'sense', 'urgency', 'Edwards', 'tendency', 'too', 'much', 'preachiness', 'story', 'magnitude', 'However', 'Edwards', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'plot', 'line', 'letting', 'IT', 'tell', 'story', 'Klugman', 'great', 'supporting', 'actor', 'film', 'performance', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'better', 'average', 'rating', 'voice', 'conscience', 'Joe', 'Clay', 'setting', 'stage', 'final', 'inevitable', 'reality']",N/A

I've seen this one, Breakfast at Tiffany's,Irma La Duce,The Apartment, The Pink Panther, Double Indemnity, Sunset Blvd, and a couple others. So for me, Days of Wine and Roses was a twofer. This was a well-told, well-directed, well-acted film. I watched it on TCM and got a bit of the background of the story from Robert O. I went in with expectations and I was not disappointed. Without going into the plot really, watching the transformations of Lemmon/Remick's characters into alcoholic 'bums' (as Lemmon called them), was quite powerful. By the end of the movie, I was happy for Lemmon's character (he goes to AA and has been sober for a year), but his wife, who he introduced to social drinking has not climbed out of the pit. Lee Remick was great at the end appearing to want to change, but not wanting to see how ""dirty"" the world really was. It was really pitiful. When she left at the end, I felt Lemmon's character's pain bc his eyes sort of had hope that she would get sober, but at the same time, felt just as strongly that she was lost forever.

And Jack Klugman's scenes as the AA councilor are a  little hammy.That said, it's still a touching, and finally devastating  film.  Lemmon turns in a wonderful performance, and Lee Remick was never  better than in this film.  1962 was closing in on the end of the black and  white era, and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; is one of those films  that reminds us of why the death of the b/w film was such a loss.  Bleak  subject matter demands a stark setting.

Featuring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick in one of their earlier roles, this a powerfully told tale of the rise and sure fall of a couple who fall in love with one another and then make another marriage with alcohol.  The symptoms are all there, as are all the excuses.  Jack Klugman has a minor role as the friend who wants to get Lemmon into an AA meeting (back when this was just starting to become accepted.)  There are the typical signs of trying to stop drinking, and then the baby arrives, and then the sneaking of the drinks, and everything that goes into the rapid fall into oblivious and depression.Yes, this is a relatively depressing movie, but its ending only offers a mere hope that Lemmon, who has finally rejected his wife for his own sobriety,...he might make it if he continues to discipline his mind and continue with his program.It is a sad film but one which is incredibly relevant.  I would've liked it if Remick had stuck it out and made a go of the marriage, but she wanted the threesome - herself, her husband and the bottle.  Maybe the baby, but her baby was the bottle.  Highly recommended, and again a film which could be considered family fare, as there was no profanity, sex, or violence, but an incredibly powerful message.

234369,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6300269310,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[5, 5]","Alcoholism is a disease. Fine. And yet wrong. The disease is obsessivity, the fact that some people cannot live within satisfying an obsession of some kind. And I am afraid everyone has a degree of obsessivity that could lead to a catastrophe in many situations. The problem is the object of this obsessivity. It is dangerous if it is excessive and aiming at an object that destroys your willpower, your selfcontrol, your selfesteem. It can be alcohol. It can be tobacco. It can be eating. It can be coffee or tea or any spft drink. It can be any illicit drug. It can be any medical and legal drug. It can be work. It can be absolutely anything. Many of those things are not dangerous but some can be deadly both for the person concerned by the obsession and for the people around the person. Fast driving is just the same. And this obessivity becomes dangerous when one is addicted to the object of the obsession. Addiction is the worst thing that may happen to a sane person. But don't forget that addiction, any addiction is rooted in the deepest layers of one's personality, in his or her deepest past, in her or his most intimate experiences. There are only two ways to deal with such a problem. Either to look for the real deeper cause and solve the problem there, if it is solvable, or to keep away from the object of the obsession, in this case alcohol, and that cannot be achieved without the help of people around you. Alcoholism is the derangement of a personality in a social environment and it can only be solved with the willpower of the person supported by the society around him or her. But we must always remember that one is no longer an alcoholic when he does not feel any desire to drink when confronted to the very object of this potential desire, i.e. alcohol. If he lives in a totally alcohol-free environment he may only be a sober alcoholic, and if he comes across alcohol again and accepts to be tempted the relapse is a hundred times worse than the first binge. One is healed when one can keep alcohol away even when alcohol is there is front of one's eyes. There is no merit not to fall to temptation if there is no temptation. At least that is what Milton used to think and I believe he was deeply right on this question.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,The bottom of Hell is a Brandy Alexander bubble bath,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,2271,"['Alcoholism', 'disease', 'Fine', 'yet', 'wrong', 'disease', 'obsessivity', 'fact', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'satisfying', 'obsession', 'kind', 'am', 'afraid', 'everyone', 'degree', 'obsessivity', 'could', 'lead', 'catastrophe', 'many', 'situations', 'problem', 'object', 'obsessivity', 'dangerous', 'excessive', 'aiming', 'object', 'willpower', 'selfcontrol', 'selfesteem', 'can', 'be', 'alcohol', 'can', 'be', 'tobacco', 'can', 'be', 'eating', 'can', 'be', 'coffee', 'tea', 'spft', 'drink', 'can', 'be', 'illicit', 'drug', 'can', 'be', 'medical', 'legal', 'drug', 'can', 'be', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'Many', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'dangerous', 'can', 'be', 'deadly', 'person', 'concerned', 'obsession', 'people', 'person', 'Fast', 'driving', 'just', 'same', 'obessivity', 'dangerous', 'when', 'one', 'addicted', 'object', 'obsession', 'Addiction', 'worst', 'thing', 'may', 'happen', 'sane', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'addiction', 'addiction', 'rooted', 'deepest', 'layers', 'one', 'personality', 'deepest', 'past', 'most', 'intimate', 'experiences', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'ways', 'deal', 'problem', 'look', 'real', 'deeper', 'cause', 'solve', 'problem', 'there', 'solvable', 'keep', 'away', 'object', 'obsession', 'case', 'alcohol', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'achieved', 'help', 'people', 'Alcoholism', 'derangement', 'personality', 'social', 'environment', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'solved', 'willpower', 'person', 'supported', 'society', 'must', 'always', 'remember', 'one', 'no', 'longer', 'alcoholic', 'when', 'not', 'feel', 'desire', 'drink', 'when', 'confronted', 'very', 'object', 'potential', 'desire', 'i.e', 'alcohol', 'totally', 'alcohol-free', 'environment', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'sober', 'alcoholic', 'alcohol', 'again', 'accepts', 'be', 'tempted', 'relapse', 'hundred', 'times', 'worse', 'first', 'binge', 'One', 'healed', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'keep', 'alcohol', 'away', 'even', 'when', 'alcohol', 'front', 'one', 'eyes', 'merit', 'not', 'fall', 'temptation', 'temptation', 'least', 'what', 'Milton', 'used', 'think', 'believe', 'was', 'deeply', 'right', 'question.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

This preachiness is somewhat amplified by being presented in the person of Jack Klugman, playing a recovering alcoholic.  I have a great deal of respect for Klugman as an actor, but to me, his line deliveries do have a tendency to sound a bit strident and overly-intense to begin with -- even as Oscar Madison in Neil Simon's 'The Odd Couple'! -- so the already-preachy tone of some of the dialogue, placed into his mouth make the film almost seem to stop at points while a public service announcement is played out.  This nitpick however, cannot diminish the overall dramatic power of the film, or its value in helping people to understand something of the tragedy of alcoholism.The Director's Commentary track by Blake Edwards was really quite disappointing.  Edwards freely admits to not having even watched the film since it was first made, so instead of being able to provide insightful commentary as the film proceeds, he frequently admits to (and apologizes for), long stretches of his own silence as he's swept up in the drama as an audience member.

He meets up with Kirsten Arnesen (Lee Remick), and informed she does not drink but loves chocolate, he orders her a Brandy Alexander.

More recent efforts like LEAVING LAS VEGAS suggest that alcoholism is but one offramp on the highway of self-destruction.  Director Blake Edwards presents a tale that begins in middle-class happiness, then winds down to the sodden depths of the perversion of Corporate Suburban America, before finishing with the brutal truth that the ability of an alcoholic to free himself from this disease is a function of his inner strength that can only be nurtured, not forced, by Alcoholics Anonymous.Jack Lemmon is Joe Clay, a man on the rise in his corporate culture.  He is a public relations executive, a job that today we would call a spin control mechanic.  He makes the good image of a company better while trying to downplay the downside. This image of altered reality forms a subtext which becomes evident when Joe and his fiancee (Lee Remeck) are having dinner with her father (Charles Bickford), who is trying to understand exactly what his daughter's boyfriend does for a living.  Joe hems and haws but admits to enhancing the positive aspects of his corporate clients. But the father persists and asks what about any harmful sides to that image. Joe weakly adds that he would then gloss over the downside while always bringing the positive to bear.  It is this altering of reality that allows Joe, then later his wife, to get caught up in the freewheeling culture of a drug abuse that has now morphed in one of cocaine.  The lure of Wine and Roses is neither absolute nor irresistable.  The film makes it clear early on that much time and dissolution is needed to become entangled.  One does not take a sip one day to become ensnared the next.  Joe Clay makes the crossover from social drinker to hard drinker so gradually that neither he nor his wife are aware until the evidence is so blatant that both recognize the dangers, but still feel the need to explain away these dangers as inconsequential.  First Joe falls in, then soon enough his wife.  The scenes of Joe's going hysterically mad in his father-in-law's greenhouse and in the county asylum are harrowing in their intensity.  Joe has cracked, and it takes the arrival of an AA counselor (Jack Klugman) to place Joe on the right path.  But the path to sobriety has many false turns, and Joe has yet to hit rock bottom.  The contrapuntal scenes of Lee Remick's own descent in the corked maelstrom are more subdued but not the less miserable.  Joe has hit rock bottom and the harsh truth is that he cannot help his wife until he first learns to help himself.  By the closing credits, she has yet to learn this most bitter of lessons.DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES is one of the landmarks of Hollywood in that it takes a no punches withheld look at a subject that many Americans have heard about but perhaps have not seen the consequences that result when the social drinker uncorks that bottle even when alone.  Lemmon and Remick are simply outstanding as a couple in which one of them learns this lesson even if the other does not.",5,Not Everyone Can Resist the Lure,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,3111,"['Hollywood', 'depiction', 'corrosive', 'effects', 'alcoholism', 'rarely', 'been', 'so', 'stark', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'WINE', 'AND', 'ROSES', 'More', 'recent', 'efforts', 'LEAVING', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'suggest', 'alcoholism', 'one', 'offramp', 'highway', 'self-destruction', 'Director', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'tale', 'middle-class', 'happiness', 'then', 'down', 'sodden', 'depths', 'perversion', 'Corporate', 'Suburban', 'America', 'finishing', 'brutal', 'truth', 'ability', 'alcoholic', 'free', 'disease', 'function', 'inner', 'strength', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'nurtured', 'not', 'forced', 'Alcoholics', 'Anonymous.Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Joe', 'Clay', 'man', 'rise', 'corporate', 'culture', 'public', 'relations', 'executive', 'job', 'today', 'would', 'call', 'spin', 'control', 'mechanic', 'good', 'image', 'company', 'better', 'trying', 'downplay', 'downside', 'image', 'altered', 'reality', 'subtext', 'evident', 'when', 'Joe', 'fiancee', 'Lee', 'Remeck', 'are', 'having', 'dinner', 'father', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'who', 'trying', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'living', 'Joe', 'hems', 'haws', 'admits', 'enhancing', 'positive', 'aspects', 'corporate', 'clients', 'father', 'persists', 'what', 'harmful', 'sides', 'image', 'Joe', 'weakly', 'would', 'then', 'gloss', 'downside', 'always', 'bringing', 'positive', 'bear', 'altering', 'reality', 'Joe', 'then', 'later', 'wife', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'freewheeling', 'culture', 'drug', 'abuse', 'now', 'morphed', 'one', 'cocaine', 'lure', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'absolute', 'irresistable', 'film', 'clear', 'early', 'much', 'time', 'dissolution', 'needed', 'become', 'entangled', 'One', 'not', 'take', 'sip', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'ensnared', 'next', 'Joe', 'Clay', 'crossover', 'social', 'drinker', 'hard', 'drinker', 'so', 'gradually', 'wife', 'are', 'aware', 'evidence', 'so', 'blatant', 'recognize', 'dangers', 'still', 'feel', 'need', 'explain', 'away', 'dangers', 'inconsequential', 'First', 'Joe', 'then', 'soon', 'enough', 'wife', 'scenes', 'Joe', 'going', 'hysterically', 'mad', 'father-in-law', 'greenhouse', 'county', 'asylum', 'are', 'harrowing', 'intensity', 'Joe', 'cracked', 'arrival', 'AA', 'counselor', 'Jack', 'Klugman', 'place', 'Joe', 'right', 'path', 'path', 'sobriety', 'many', 'false', 'turns', 'Joe', 'yet', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'contrapuntal', 'scenes', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'own', 'descent', 'corked', 'maelstrom', 'are', 'more', 'subdued', 'not', 'less', 'miserable', 'Joe', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'harsh', 'truth', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wife', 'first', 'help', 'closing', 'credits', 'yet', 'learn', 'most', 'bitter', 'lessons.DAYS', 'OF', 'WINE', 'AND', 'ROSES', 'one', 'landmarks', 'Hollywood', 'punches', 'withheld', 'look', 'subject', 'many', 'Americans', 'have', 'heard', 'perhaps', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'consequences', 'result', 'when', 'social', 'drinker', 'uncorks', 'bottle', 'even', 'when', 'alone', 'Lemmon', 'Remick', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'couple', 'one', 'lesson', 'even', 'other', 'not']",N/A

Director Blake Edwards was known for his brilliant comedies including Operation Petticoat and Breakfast at Tiffany's.But when the two got together it was pure drama.  Add to this, Lee Remick in her first mainstream starring role.The Days of Wine and Roses was one of the first films to take on social alcoholism.  Joe Clay is an up and coming public relations man in the early 60's when public relations meant getting party girls and drinking the client under the table.  At one of these events he meets the straight laced Kirsten.  He offends her by assuming she was one of the party girls.  But there is something about him that she finds disarming.Soon they are married and she is pulled into his world of social drinking.  But it is worse for her because this was the era of stay at home mother.  So she has no outlet and becomes dependant on alcohol to fill her drab day.They both hit rock bottom.  This scene is very scary.  But it shows that not only do you have to hit rock bottom but also be ready to start climbing back up.  (By the way, when you think they hit rock bottom is not rock bottom!  They still have far to go!)Until this film, most films on alcoholism are about one alcoholic and the girlfriend or spouse that try to save them.  This film is more realistic than any before as both main characters slide into the abyss and only have themselves to get out.Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick are both stunning and deserved their Oscar nominations.  This was a turning point in both careers.  Lemmon would easily slip from comedy to drama the rest of his career.  While Remick would scorch both the big and little screen until her untimely death.Also, this would be Edward's crowning achievement. He would create great comedies in the future but would never find another drama to surpass this.And let's not forget Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's Oscar winning song.",5,Two comic geniuses make one of the most potent dramas ever,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,2113,"['Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'was', 'known', 'moviegoers', 'one', 'great', 'comic', 'actors', 'creating', 'three', 'greatest', 'movie', 'comedies', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'Mister', 'Roberts', 'Hot', 'Apartment', 'Director', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'was', 'known', 'brilliant', 'comedies', 'including', 'Operation', 'Petticoat', 'Breakfast', ""Tiffany's.But"", 'when', 'two', 'got', 'together', 'was', 'pure', 'drama', 'Add', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'first', 'mainstream', 'starring', 'role.The', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'take', 'social', 'alcoholism', 'Joe', 'Clay', 'up', 'coming', 'public', 'relations', 'man', 'early', '60', 'when', 'public', 'relations', 'meant', 'getting', 'party', 'girls', 'drinking', 'client', 'table', 'one', 'events', 'straight', 'laced', 'Kirsten', 'assuming', 'was', 'one', 'party', 'girls', 'something', 'disarming.Soon', 'are', 'married', 'pulled', 'world', 'social', 'drinking', 'worse', 'was', 'era', 'stay', 'home', 'mother', 'outlet', 'dependant', 'alcohol', 'fill', 'drab', 'day.They', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'scene', 'very', 'scary', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'also', 'be', 'ready', 'start', 'climbing', 'back', 'up', 'way', 'when', 'think', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'not', 'rock', 'bottom', 'still', 'have', 'far', 'go', 'film', 'most', 'films', 'alcoholism', 'are', 'one', 'alcoholic', 'girlfriend', 'spouse', 'try', 'save', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'main', 'characters', 'slide', 'abyss', 'only', 'have', 'get', 'out.Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'are', 'stunning', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'careers', 'Lemmon', 'would', 'easily', 'slip', 'comedy', 'drama', 'rest', 'career', 'Remick', 'would', 'scorch', 'big', 'little', 'screen', 'untimely', 'death.Also', 'would', 'be', 'Edward', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'would', 'create', 'great', 'comedies', 'future', 'would', 'never', 'find', 'drama', 'surpass', 'this.And', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'Johnny', 'Mercer', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'song']",N/A

It examines the life of a couple, Joe and Kiersten Clay, who gradually become alcoholics.  DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES also seems modern.  Surely this was one of the first films to call alcoholism an illness, or to show an AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) meeting.  As Joe, Jack Lemmon plays his usual character-type of the basically decent man overwhelmed by the world.  Here, though, his situation takes a tragic, not a comic, turn as he drinks chronically to cope and as a result becomes violent in his behavior.  As Kiersten, Lee Remick's acting is every bit as brilliant as Lemmon's, particularly in the drunk scenes.  Jack Klugman stands out in the supporting part of Jim Hungerford, a tough-looking yet gentle AA representative who refuses to give up on Joe.  The movie presents several unforgettable images:  Joe and Kiersten gazing out at the river on their first date; Joe becoming hysterical over one misplaced bottle of liquor; Jim wiping Joe's perspired face in the hospital; Joe gazing out his window after a departing Kiersten as a neon bar sign flashes.

While providing a client with, literally, a boatload of girls, Joe meets receptionist Kirsten Arnesen (Lee Remick), a good girl from a stable country upbringing.Joe introduces Kirsten to alcohol in the form of a Brandy Alexander, and before long the two fall in love and marry.  Joe provides a good living for his wife and new baby daughter, but becomes depressed from the quiet family life and a baby that takes up all of his wife's attention.  In a truly gut-wrenching scene, Joe berates and completely degrades Kirsten for not being any fun anymore, throwing a temper tantrum while drunk and demanding that she stop nursing her own baby (mammary envy) because its going to ruin her shape.  A very poignant and heart braking scene.Kirsten is deeply in love with Joe, and concedes to his demands to ""loosen up a little and be fun again"", which means having a couple of drinks with him.  It isn't long before Kirsten is drinking all the time, and very common of women in the early sixties, Kirsten starts smoking (probably to help lose weight, though this isn't mentioned beyond Joe's comment about her shape).Joe's career slides as his drinking increases, causing him to be late for work and upsetting his clients.  His company assigns him to a lower-level client in far away Houston.  While Joe tries to do his job there, Kirsten sets their apartment on fire from drinking and smoking.  Joe is fired, and not long afterward Joe has an epiphany.  He is a bum, and his wife is a bum, and they need to stop drinking.Kirsten's father takes the struggling couple into his home where he runs a nursery.  After a couple of months sober, Joe and Kirsten fall off the wagon together in a riotous binge in their room.  A second very poignant incident follows where Joe trashes his father-in-law's nursery looking for the bottle he hid.  This scene may seem overdone at first, but just tune into one episode of 'Cops' and you will see how well Jack Lemmon played this scene.This time, Joe winds out in the hospital going through some overblown withdrawal symptoms, and it is here he meets Jim Hungerford (Jack Klugman) from Alcoholics Anonymous.  Once in AA, Joe tries to fight his disease, while Kirsten remains in absolute denial of being an alcoholic.  You must remember that this movie was made in 1962, and there was quite a stigma attached to being an alcoholic, the 60's version of a scarlet letter.There is no happily-ever-after in this movie.  Though made in 1962, it is still the best of the 'alcoholic' movies ever made.  'Leaving Las Vegas' certainly portrayed a down-and-out alcoholic, but the character Ben from that modern portrayal wanted to die.  'Days Of Wine And Roses' is the story of two people's struggle against alcoholism, not their submission to it.There is nothing outdated about this movie except the fashion; times change, behaviors don't.  Kirsten's confession that she ""just wants things to look prettier than they are"" rings so true to addiction in any form or from any era.  This movie is about people and the disease, not the time-period, so it stands up to any of the modern day addiction stories.'Days Of Wine And Roses' is a true classic, a timeless piece that is both sad and entertaining.  Take a quick note of the fact that in Joe and Kirsten's first apartment, the bar was right outside the baby's room.  I thought that was a bit ironic.If you love addiction movies, modern pieces like 'Leaving Las Vegas', 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Spun', or 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas', you will love 'Days Of Wine And Roses'.

He wasn't the Alcoholic, but he could, for no apparent reason become Violent. My mother was the Alcoholic, and she eventually died from the effects. My mom's father/my grandfather was my early in life salvation. He died when I was 17. My mom and dad divorced very shortly afterwards. Due to my mom's drinking he left his share of the home in my name which in turn made me the Head-of-the-Household and thus forced me to assume responsibilities that went along with that heading rather than exploring my own goals and desires. This feeling was imposed on me by my mom's mom, who was a controlling and enabling person. Over the years she sent my mom off to various treatment centers that would work for awhile. However the two of them had a love/hate relationship that always ended up with my mom's drinking again. I saw ""Days of Wine and Roses"" when it was first released and it still to this day lives within me. I felt hopeless to be able to do anything to get my mom to stop drinking and asked her to go see the movie. She did, and she was drunk before she got home from her viewing of it. After I had two failed marriages a woman friend of mine who worked in Family Services strongly suggested I consider joining ACOA, or Adult Children of Alcoholics.

I think the way that the movie in the beginning showed the insecurity and unease of the two main characters is the most underrated aspect of this brilliant film. The alcohol washes away the unease and pain for awhile, but when the mask wears off, literally, all hell breaks loose!!Some have commented that Jack Lemmon's greenhouse scene and subsequent mental-ward scene were not realistic. I disagree with this, as I think his character's mental state was such that a complete breakdown was a very real possibility at that point in the story. Ultimately, this film is more than just a story of the dangers of alcoholism. It is a story of the dangers of low self-esteem and not loving yourself.

He surely feels guilty over pushing her to drink with him in the early days of their courtship, as it led to nothing but trouble for both of them.Lee Remick also does a fine job here as a woman who ends up unable to imagine life without alcohol, unable to face her young child, and unable to muster up the courage to gain sobriety along with her struggling husband.Shot in stark b/w, this is a portrait of the dangers and damages of alcoholism:  the shattered lives and relationships, job loss, having to go to AA meetings, and more.",5,Stunning portrait of alcoholics and resulting damages,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,842,"['was', 'amazed', 'see', 'usually', 'comedic', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'give', 'such', 'powerful', 'performance', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'dry', 'out', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'slip', 'up', 'again', 'out', 'again', 'try', 'stay', 'sober', 'raise', 'daughter', 'own', 'trying', 'same', 'time', 'get', 'love', 'life', 'become', 'sober', 'well', 'surely', 'guilty', 'pushing', 'drink', 'early', 'days', 'courtship', 'led', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'them.Lee', 'Remick', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'here', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'unable', 'imagine', 'life', 'alcohol', 'unable', 'face', 'young', 'child', 'unable', 'muster', 'up', 'courage', 'gain', 'sobriety', 'struggling', 'husband.Shot', 'stark', 'b/w', 'portrait', 'dangers', 'damages', 'alcoholism', 'shattered', 'lives', 'relationships', 'job', 'loss', 'having', 'go', 'AA', 'meetings', 'more']",N/A

I'm not being clever: although, yes, the man and woman are infatuated with the bottle, they are a truly loving couple. That's what makes this film so powerful. It does not romanticise alcoholism, it inebriates romance, if you get my drift.I think of this film as a kind of sequel to the 'The Apartment' (made about the same time). Imagine Mr Baxter has left New York and moved to San Francisco with his bride, the former Miss Kubelik. What kind of job might he have taken up: public relations? How might he have reacted to the phoney world of his job, and how might she have tried to support and comfort him, if he had a taste for drink? Jack Lemmon gives a performance here which is at least on a par with his starring role in 'The Apartment'. Playing his wife is the superb Lee Remick, an actress probably underrated because of her beauty, who gives a performance of extraordinary power and sensitivity here.Blake Edwards directs (not Billy Wilder) and, I think, never did better work. Perhaps the fact that he himself was a reformed alcoholic kept him so relentlessly engaged with the material.
