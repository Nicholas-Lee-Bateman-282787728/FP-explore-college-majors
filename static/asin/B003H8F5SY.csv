The characters Seth and Gina (the real Seth and Gina) are utterly adorable.  Who wouldn't love the sweet and shy Seth?  His cluelessness regarding women was so endearing.  The way he looks at Gina when he realizes she's the woman he's been writing too all these years melted my heart.  Meanwhile the fake Seth and Gina are so hilirious.  I couldn't stop laughing at their misunderstandings - especially regarding her dog and his father.  I totally agree about this not being suitable for young children because there are some heavy make out scenes even though there is no nudity or bad language.  There is also an inappropriate version of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" song which is funny for adults, but not children.  I recommend this movie for ages 13 and up, depending on the maturity of the children.  I always watch movies first before letting my daughter view them, and I decide for myself if they're suitable.  My daughter is 9, so I will definitely be waiting a few years before letting her see this movie.  As for myself - I totally loved it, and recommend it to any die hard romantics out there.

1345818,AQ2UN38CMK119,B003H8F5SY,P. Mann,"[40, 42]","Two young children begin a pen-pal relationship while in sixth grade. The film starts when they are both young adults and his job takes him to Boston, where she lives and works. To this point, they have corresponded only by written word, but they decide that given the proximity, they should meet. At this point, the first implausibility arises. Each of them has been lying to the other, having sent photographs of friends rather than of themselves. So in planning the meeting, each convinces the friend whose photograph was used to go to the meeting instead. Thus, the supposed meeting of two long-time friends actually involves neither of them.Oddly, this first meeting offers, I think, the funniest moments of the film as the two stand-ins try to remember all the facts they have tried to memorize. For instance, he offers condolences to her on the loss of her dog. She, hearing the name and not connecting it with a dog, thinks that the loss must be an ex-boyfriend and notes that, truthfully, he was a lousy kisser. There are a couple of misunderstandings like this that are fairly humorous, albeit in a contrived way.At least one other reviewer has questioned the appropriateness of this film for family members. There is rather a lot of kissing, including one scene involving chocolate syrup that probably would make parents uncomfortable explaining to a pre-teen. So I think that reviewer's concern is appropriate.The biggest problem, at least to me, though, is the lack of real emotion and the contrivances in this film. At no time did I ever believe in either of the main characters or the resolution. For much better films dealing with epistolary relationships, I recommend84 Charing Cross RoadandJapanese Wife.
