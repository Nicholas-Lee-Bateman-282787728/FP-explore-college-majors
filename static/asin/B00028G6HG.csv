826631,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00028G6HG,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[31, 32]","Of all the highlights of Julie Harris' illustrious career, ""The Belle of Amherst "" is her masterpiece. This extraordinary one-woman, two act play by William Luce is exquisitely written and laced with Emily Dickinson's poetry, and is by turns hilarious, as she tells us the small town gossip, to profound and moving, when she speaks of her poetry, her parents, and Dr. Charles Wadsworth, a preacher that captured her heart and soul.It takes place when Emily, who was born in 1830, is 53 years old, and she invites the viewer into her home, and describes in wonderfully staged vignettes, the many phases of her life. Dickinson was unknown during her lifetime, and was a recluse, but said ""I never had to go anywhere to find my paradise"".You will get the recipe for her famous Black Bread, which has as ingredients: 2 lbs. each flour, butter, and sugar, 19 eggs, 5 lbs. raisins, 1  lbs. each currants and citron,  pt. each brandy and molasses, 2 nutmegs, 5 tsp. cloves, mace and cinnamon, 2 tsp. soda, and 2 pinches of salt. I have tasted this Black Bread (which is more like a fruit cake), and it's delicious !Julie Harris is ""The First Lady of the American Theater"", with a record five Tony Awards with her name on them, as well as an Oscar nomination and 10 Emmy nominations. Ms. Harris has captivated many an audience with her impassioned performances, and her portrayal of Emily Dickinson is as if they shared the same heart; this is a unique theatrical experience, directed by Charles Durbin, and filmed live in a small theater in 1976.This was a gift from a generous soul, to whom I am very grateful, and this film would be equally treasured by anyone who appreciates poetry and Ms. Harris' magical talent. ""The Belle of Amherst"" would also be an excellent study tool for literature and women's study groups, as well as drama students.Total running time is 90 minutes.Not in Vain""If I can stop one heart from breaking,I shall not live in vain;If I can ease one life the aching,Or cool one pain,Or help one fainting robinUnto his nest again,I shall not live in vain"".",5,"""words are my life""",1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,2070,"['highlights', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'illustrious', 'career', 'Belle', 'Amherst', 'masterpiece', 'extraordinary', 'one-woman', 'two', 'act', 'play', 'William', 'Luce', 'exquisitely', 'written', 'laced', 'Emily', 'Dickinson', 'poetry', 'turns', 'hilarious', 'small', 'town', 'gossip', 'profound', 'moving', 'when', 'poetry', 'parents', 'Dr.', 'Charles', 'Wadsworth', 'preacher', 'captured', 'heart', 'soul.It', 'place', 'when', 'Emily', 'who', 'was', 'born', '1830', '53', 'years', 'old', 'viewer', 'home', 'describes', 'wonderfully', 'staged', 'vignettes', 'many', 'phases', 'life', 'Dickinson', 'was', 'unknown', 'lifetime', 'was', 'recluse', 'said', 'never', 'had', 'go', 'anywhere', 'find', 'paradise', '.You', 'will', 'get', 'recipe', 'famous', 'Black', 'Bread', 'ingredients', '2', 'lbs', 'flour', 'butter', 'sugar', '19', 'eggs', '5', 'lbs', 'raisins', '1', 'lbs', 'currants', 'citron', 'pt', 'brandy', 'molasses', '2', 'nutmegs', '5', 'tsp', 'cloves', 'mace', 'cinnamon', '2', 'tsp', 'soda', '2', 'pinches', 'salt', 'have', 'tasted', 'Black', 'Bread', 'more', 'fruit', 'cake', 'delicious', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'First', 'Lady', 'American', 'Theater', 'record', 'five', 'Tony', 'Awards', 'name', 'as', 'well', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '10', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'captivated', 'many', 'audience', 'impassioned', 'performances', 'portrayal', 'Emily', 'Dickinson', 'shared', 'same', 'heart', 'unique', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'directed', 'Charles', 'Durbin', 'filmed', 'live', 'small', 'theater', '1976.This', 'was', 'gift', 'generous', 'soul', 'whom', 'am', 'very', 'grateful', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'treasured', 'anyone', 'who', 'poetry', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'magical', 'talent', 'Belle', 'Amherst', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'excellent', 'study', 'tool', 'literature', 'women', 'study', 'groups', 'as', 'well', 'drama', 'students.Total', 'running', 'time', '90', 'minutes.Not', 'Vain', 'can', 'stop', 'one', 'heart', 'breaking', 'shall', 'not', 'live', 'vain', 'can', 'ease', 'one', 'life', 'aching', 'cool', 'one', 'pain', 'help', 'one', 'fainting', 'robinUnto', 'nest', 'again', 'shall', 'not', 'live', 'vain']",N/A
826632,AT54Q2ERA4PBR,B00028G6HG,Ben J Korgen,"[1, 1]","Julie Harris gave a one-actor portrayal of Emily Dickinson that captivated a live audience and indirectly was captured on this DVD.  Remarkably, Harris was made up and dressed to look more like the only known photograph of Emily than would seem possible.  The early portions of the Harris performance revealed a side of Emily much different from the ""recluse"" label applied to her by insensitive writers.  Based on intensive research, Emily had a great sense of humor, but did not go overboard in mixing with local socialites because small talk based on local happenings were less interesting than what was floating around in her own mind.  Harris revealed the pain Emily went through when her poetry was evaluated by those who failed to understand cutting edge originality.  Harris also revealed that although Emily bypassed local male masters of small talk, she had huge but futile crushes on accomplished men of national fame who were already married.

At that time, Miss Harris was 74 and that evening is forever burned into my memory. This is not one of those &#34;chew the scenery&#34; performances we have become inundated with in recent years. I know the current trend in singing is loud, belting voices that scream with amplified assistance and that films focus on psychosis and behavioral isms as if we have all been there. There is none of that in this story. This is an intimate conversation, the kind we used to have with each other before we learned to bury our heads in our smart phones. This is a conversation with someone who has the courage to share what frightens them and what makes them sad and what delights them in life. And it takes someone of Miss Harris' master-skill to ease us into this difficult, and heart-felt conversation. It's a sublime exercise in the business of being human and for those who can embrace and even surrender to such an experience, you will be lovingly cared for and welcomed by Miss Harris.",5,Sublime and Heavenly,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,1107,"['was', 'blessed', 'see', 'Miss', 'Harris', 'perform', 'role', 'September', '2000', 'Laguna', 'Playhouse', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'California', 'time', 'Miss', 'Harris', 'was', '74', 'evening', 'forever', 'burned', 'memory', 'not', 'one', '34', 'chew', 'scenery', '34', 'performances', 'have', 'become', 'inundated', 'recent', 'years', 'know', 'current', 'trend', 'singing', 'loud', 'belting', 'voices', 'scream', 'amplified', 'assistance', 'films', 'focus', 'psychosis', 'behavioral', 'isms', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'none', 'story', 'intimate', 'conversation', 'kind', 'used', 'have', 'other', 'learned', 'bury', 'heads', 'smart', 'phones', 'conversation', 'someone', 'who', 'courage', 'share', 'what', 'what', 'sad', 'what', 'delights', 'life', 'someone', 'Miss', 'Harris', 'master-skill', 'ease', 'difficult', 'heart-felt', 'conversation', 'sublime', 'exercise', 'business', 'being', 'human', 'who', 'can', 'embrace', 'even', 'surrender', 'such', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'lovingly', 'cared', 'welcomed', 'Miss', 'Harris']",N/A

I've long thought of Judi Dench and Meryl Streep as our greatest actresses, Harris was as good if not better.

If we were part of the theatre audience we would have seen Julie Harris as a three-dimensional figure and the stage props as guides and supports to her performance. As a cinema product, the effect is strictly two-dimensional and the stage props are, if anything, impediments to our imagination. Harris gives a forceful and nuanced reading, and I suppose there is a case that can be made for preserving it on film for students of the craft. Whether the play itself is that good, I have my doubts. Clever and amusing it may be, but the portrait of Emily Dickinson conjured up seems too flirtatious and dizzy for the writer of the cool and measured verse we know and love.
