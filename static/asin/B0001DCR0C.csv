800726,A3L2856DIMUXJY,B0001DCR0C,&#34;Belgo Geordie&#34;,"[1, 1]","As noted by a number of reviewers, this started life as a play and the director has made a film that unfolds like a play. Granted, with some exceptional settings such as the live concert settings. I think the title clearly asks the audience to consider the merits of the dialogue. Reading the reviews, it has succeeded in making people think. But it is not history in the sense of presentation of what factual information is available. As other reviewers note, this story leaves many loose ends for you the viewer to pursue in your own time, in your own way. Good conversation people. For me, there is a core issue central to this work. The role of the artist and their work in times of a fascist government and one that was embarked on terror and genocide. How much succour do you give them in the name of art? What price do you pay to continue to work under that system. If you want a parallel, Picasso in Paris remained under the German occupation but did not collaborate by painting for them. I liked the tension created between the role of Harvey Keitel and that of Stellan Skarsgard. As noted he was leading a prosecution. What some viewers may have missed is that Furtwangler did not have a credible defence. What I perceived the lawyer doing was trying to get under the skin of the musician and have him respond to the moral issue. How did he carry on creating his art amongst the carnage and how could the actions of his patrons not taint his creative art. I thank Ronald Harwood and Istvan Szabo for making this film. Hats off to Mr Keitel and Mr Skarsgard. It lost a star for me because the sub-characters did not act as a strong enough counterpoint to the two protagonists. Given what was revealed of their history leading to this event, they were not credible. Secondly, the film for all of its beauty and excellence in craft remained a play. But this is great cinema at work and a good soundtrack to go with it.",4,Taking Sides-you get to decide,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,1925,"['noted', 'number', 'reviewers', 'started', 'life', 'play', 'director', 'made', 'film', 'play', 'Granted', 'exceptional', 'settings', 'such', 'live', 'concert', 'settings', 'think', 'title', 'clearly', 'audience', 'consider', 'merits', 'dialogue', 'Reading', 'reviews', 'succeeded', 'making', 'people', 'think', 'not', 'history', 'sense', 'presentation', 'what', 'factual', 'information', 'available', 'other', 'reviewers', 'note', 'story', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'viewer', 'pursue', 'own', 'time', 'own', 'way', 'Good', 'conversation', 'people', 'core', 'issue', 'central', 'work', 'role', 'artist', 'work', 'times', 'fascist', 'government', 'one', 'was', 'embarked', 'terror', 'genocide', 'How', 'much', 'succour', 'do', 'give', 'name', 'art', 'What', 'price', 'do', 'pay', 'continue', 'work', 'system', 'want', 'parallel', 'Picasso', 'Paris', 'remained', 'German', 'occupation', 'did', 'not', 'collaborate', 'painting', 'liked', 'tension', 'created', 'role', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'noted', 'was', 'leading', 'prosecution', 'What', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'Furtwangler', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'credible', 'defence', 'What', 'perceived', 'lawyer', 'doing', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'skin', 'musician', 'have', 'respond', 'moral', 'issue', 'How', 'did', 'carry', 'creating', 'art', 'carnage', 'how', 'could', 'actions', 'patrons', 'not', 'taint', 'creative', 'art', 'thank', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'Istvan', 'Szabo', 'making', 'film', 'Mr', 'Keitel', 'Mr', 'Skarsgard', 'lost', 'star', 'sub-characters', 'did', 'not', 'act', 'strong', 'enough', 'counterpoint', 'two', 'protagonists', 'Given', 'what', 'was', 'revealed', 'history', 'leading', 'event', 'were', 'not', 'credible', 'Secondly', 'film', 'beauty', 'excellence', 'craft', 'remained', 'play', 'great', 'cinema', 'work', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'go']",Taking Sides VHS

It compounds this problem by thinking itself deep. The basic question is whether the conductor deserves to be allowed to continue his work given that he was famous under the Nazis. The answer to that is clearly 'yes' and at no point in the film do they accuse him of doing anything that could be considered a crime. Even if he had been close to Hitler that wouldn't have been a crime unless he did something with it. And it's quite clear he didn't even like the man so what's the point? There is no point at which any of the evidence, or indeed the accusations, have any real bite. There is no point at which you feel he might be guilty (or even that any of Keitel's accusations are crimes to be guilty of) and no real give and take. He just sits there and takes the abuse issued forth by Keitel, which was really only interesting the first of the three times they repeat the exact same 'argument.' Basically, he is accused of NOT leaving the country and NOT doing more to oppose Hitler. In other words his only crime was in not taking a firm stand against Hitler. How can it be a crime to not get yourself killed? It's just silliness. It seems to be trying to rope all Germans into this question (how could they do nothing to stop this man?) yet it never goes into that question except superficially.The only two characters of any significance are the Major and the musician and both of them represent opposite and boring extremes. Skarsgrd comes off the best since his character feels himself to be completely noble and pure which puts off the Major only slightly more than it puts off me. He doesn't seem to be a particularly good man, but no law has ever been able to legislate that all people must be good. It is at least an interesting performance brimming with self-righteousness and despair. Keitel goes over the top and makes the Major utterly unsympathetic in a boring way. He does nothing but bully people and the only interesting thing about it is how he seems so shocked when people don't think the same way he does. It seems like they were going for emotion vs. reason, rage vs. acceptance, low-class vs. culture angles, but all the themes are left undeveloped and unexplored.

With all due respect to Massey, there is no comparison to the Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard. Skarsgard is the great Furtwangler! Am I a self-proclaimed authority on the conductor? No, not really, but I have read the three existing biographies about him. I tell you that Skarsgard, without a doubt, is as close to the conductor as possible. His portrayal is worth seeing the film alone! Harvey Keitel as the interogator, WHOA! Although there are several other fine actors in this film, Skarsgard and Keitel make seeing this film a must. If your a classical music buff, what are you waiting for? The central issue of this film was, did Furtwangler offer his artistic talents to the government and thus deemed a colaborator? Or, did he simply have a love for Germany and his art to the extent he felt he needed to stay in Germany as a symbol of his and other German citizens opposition to the Nazis. Although at times he made compromises with the government, as a whole he was clearly anti- Nazi and was about to be arrested by the SS for his support of Jewish muscians just before he left the country for Switzerland. You may think I'm too sympathetic to Furtwangler, but after reading three books, I'm both a supporter of the man and his art. So,I highly recommend you see the movie and decide for your self. Lastly, while your watching this film you will probably feel that he should have left Germany a long time ago, if he really wanted to do the ""right thing"". However, let me tell you something most people do not know about Furtwangler. He was told by the government at one point that if he left Germany at any time, his elderly mother would be put in jail! My source is from a book written by Yehudi Menuhin's dad. Those of you who know classical music are familiar with the close relationship between the Menuhin family and Furtwangler.

It brimmed with intriguing thought-provoking dialogue offered via reasonably consistent quality acting. Exploration of the few characters in cast was above stereotypical. As a thought-provoking medium on de-Nazification of post-war Germany it scores on several levels, however the tragedy is that this movie held within it's immediate grasp seeds of magnificient opportunity which might have bloomed with a bit more complex plotwork.

800730,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0001DCR0C,Craig Matteson,"[6, 8]","Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler was a great conductor who chose to stay in Germany and continue his work during the time of the Nazi regime.  After the war there were trials for those who actually perpetrated crimes.  There were also hearings to facilitate the so-called de-Nazification of Germany.  Of course, after the, no one admitted to being a supporter of the Nazis let a lone a member of the party.Furtw&auml;ngler was investigated because of his prominence as the leader of the Berlin Philharmonic.  He was eventually cleared and resumed his work.  His record was ambiguous and remains so today.  While he clearly helped Jews and risked much to protest the way Jewish musicians were being treated, he also made statements whose language can be taken as anti-Semitic.  He was never invited to conduct in the United Sates after the war even though he was invited to take over the New York Philharmonic before the war.This film is based on a successful play that uses these events as a background, but changes them for dramatic purposes.  I note the actual history because it always comes up when discussing this play.  This is not about the life of Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler.  It is about judging both guilt and judgment.  Using the broad outline of Furtw&auml;ngler's life it adds some fictional characters and invites to view to take sides.  Is Furtw&auml;ngler as shown in the play worthy of punishment?  Should he be let go?  In either case, why?The actors in this movie are all good and the performances draw the viewer in and provoke strong reactions.  Harvey Keitel plays the American official assigned to get Furtw&auml;ngler (not to investigate the matter) in a very extreme way.  I think this rabid approach may be done to balance the anger so many feel towards the Nazis.  The idea of the play is not to push the viewer to one side or the other, but to provide enough information so that the viewer will feel conflicted on both sides.  I think it does this very well and provides great material to spark discussion between friends or between parents and children.  It can also be used in classes.  I can imagine the passionate arguments the students will have going after this or that point in the film.Take the play at face value and don't worry about the real person whose name and occupation they use.  Think about what is put before you in the play and wrestle with it.

Arnold (played brilliantly by Harvey Keitel); if you're a liberal you'll root for Furtwangler (played just a briliantly by Skarsgard).  Huh?  I'm to the right of Ghenghis Khah but even I saw in the Arnold character a reprisal of Roland Freisler's real-life prosecutorial style.  Freisler from 1942 to his death in a bombing raid (saved him from hanging at Nurnberg I'm sure) was president of the infamous Volksgerichtshof (People's Court).  He sentenced Sophie Scholl and the other White Rose conspirators to death, represented Nazi justice at the Wannsee Conference where the Holocaust was planned, and prosecuted the officers who tried to assassinate Hitler (the Twentieth of July 1944 Plot)(see how it is used in this movie).  In fact Maj. Arnold's prosecutorial style reminded me vividly of Freisler's.  To imply that conservative Americans would be attracted to the Arnold character, or that liberals wouldn't, is an insult to both camps.  (See ""Trial of Strength,"" by Fred Prieberg if you want to learn more about Wilhelm Furtwanger and the Third Reich.)

His expression goes beyond tears.  He is what ""crying"" looks like without the actual sobbing.  Skarsgard is completely believable and compelling as the etherial Wilheim Furtwangler, who was, by most accounts, regarded as the greatest conductor of his time.  In trying to convey Furtwanger's position as an artist during the Nazi nightmare, the actor has captured the conflicting emotions and intellectual rationale he was experiencing at the time.The whole film is more about the potential of human beings (Keitel) to become inhuman.  When one cannot feel anything, one is capable of anything.  The major represents, for me, personally, the man who has no respect for, knowledge of, or exposure to art in any of its forms.

800733,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B0001DCR0C,F. S. L'hoir,"[6, 7]","I found this film about the pre-trial interrogation of Wilhelm Furtwaengler, conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic during the Third Reich, both disturbing and compelling. My discomfort arose from the one-sided nature of the interrogation, since Major Arnold (Harvey Keitel) has been given the mandate of securing a conviction against Furtwaengler by any means including humiliation. The Major is both a zealot and a bully who makes no effort to see the dilemma of the great maestro--whom he dismisses as a ""bandleader,""--who has chosen to remain in Germany and has been forced to walk a ""tightrope"" in order to co-exist with and survive an intolerable regime. The Major, a philistine who has no understanding of the conflict between art and politics, furthermore, does not even speak the same language, figuratively speaking, as the shattered Furtwaengler. His interrogation methods, in fact, are recognized by Emmi, his jobbed-in German Secretary, as being reminiscent of those of the Gestapo.The acting is superb, especially on the part of Stellan Skarsgard, whose nuanced portrayal of Furtwaengler is tremendously moving. Although Keitel's performance begins on such a high note that it has no place to go, it is nevertheless appropriate given the circumstances of his task of getting a conviction at any cost. Under director Istvan Szabo's guidance, however, the temptation to ""take sides"" with Furtwaengler, because of the Major's bullying, is subtly subverted by questions of conscience and motivation on the part of the maestro.The recreation of post-war Berlin is superb. Two outstanding scenes take place at concerts: the first, of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, at a baroque church in the last days of the war, as allied bombers drop their payloads on Berlin; and the second, of the adagio of the Schubert string quintet, at the ruins of the same church, which has been bombed out. In the middle of the performance of the latter, the rain pours in and the black umbrellas go up, and no one thinks of leaving. The choice of music is emblematic: Beethoven with it's beat ( . . . -) [ V for Victory, for those too young to remember] accompanies the defeat of the Third Reich, while the sublime Schubert adagio offers consolation to the Berliners who are left to live with the consequences of that demented regime.One of the aspects of this film that I liked the best is that it asks difficult questions of the viewer, but provides no answers--perhaps because there are none.",5,No Easy Answers,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,2477,"['found', 'film', 'pre-trial', 'interrogation', 'Wilhelm', 'Furtwaengler', 'conductor', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'Third', 'Reich', 'disturbing', 'compelling', 'discomfort', 'arose', 'one-sided', 'nature', 'interrogation', 'Major', 'Arnold', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'been', 'given', 'mandate', 'securing', 'conviction', 'Furtwaengler', 'means', 'including', 'humiliation', 'Major', 'zealot', 'bully', 'who', 'effort', 'see', 'dilemma', 'great', 'maestro', 'whom', 'bandleader', 'who', 'chosen', 'remain', 'Germany', 'been', 'forced', 'walk', 'tightrope', 'order', 'co-exist', 'survive', 'intolerable', 'regime', 'Major', 'philistine', 'who', 'understanding', 'conflict', 'art', 'politics', 'furthermore', 'not', 'even', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'figuratively', 'speaking', 'shattered', 'Furtwaengler', 'interrogation', 'methods', 'fact', 'are', 'recognized', 'Emmi', 'jobbed-in', 'German', 'Secretary', 'being', 'reminiscent', 'Gestapo.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'part', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'Furtwaengler', 'tremendously', 'moving', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'high', 'note', 'place', 'go', 'nevertheless', 'appropriate', 'given', 'circumstances', 'task', 'getting', 'conviction', 'cost', 'director', 'Istvan', 'Szabo', 'guidance', 'however', 'temptation', 'take', 'sides', 'Furtwaengler', 'Major', 'bullying', 'subtly', 'subverted', 'questions', 'conscience', 'motivation', 'part', 'maestro.The', 'recreation', 'post-war', 'Berlin', 'superb', 'Two', 'outstanding', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'concerts', 'first', 'Beethoven', 'Fifth', 'Symphony', 'baroque', 'church', 'last', 'days', 'war', 'allied', 'bombers', 'drop', 'payloads', 'Berlin', 'second', 'adagio', 'Schubert', 'string', 'quintet', 'ruins', 'same', 'church', 'been', 'bombed', 'out', 'middle', 'performance', 'latter', 'rain', 'pours', 'black', 'umbrellas', 'go', 'up', 'one', 'thinks', 'leaving', 'choice', 'music', 'emblematic', 'Beethoven', 'beat', '[', 'V', 'Victory', 'too', 'young', 'remember', ']', 'accompanies', 'defeat', 'Third', 'Reich', 'sublime', 'Schubert', 'adagio', 'offers', 'consolation', 'Berliners', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'live', 'consequences', 'demented', 'regime.One', 'aspects', 'film', 'liked', 'best', 'difficult', 'questions', 'viewer', 'answers', 'perhaps', 'are', 'none']",Taking Sides VHS

If you are, like that reviewer, more a patriot than an independent thinker, you'll surely hate this movie. The Americans in it are portrayed as cultural yahoos for the most part. The character played by Harvey Keitel is a country-music-only kind of guy who has only anger and insensitivity toward European civilization, represented by the music of Beethoven and the adulation expressed by ""highbrows"" for the conducting of Wilhelm Furtwangler. As Keitel's character, an American army officer, investigates the charges of collaboration with the Nazis against Furtwangler, his frustration with the mistique which he can't appreciate grows more and more ferocious, and he degenerates morally into a kind of intolerance not far removed from the mentality of Nazism itself. Make no mistake: this film is about Keitel's character, not about Furtwangler as portrayed with deliberate neutrality and ambiguity by Stellan Skarsgard.This is easily the most interesting film about the occupation and aftermath of World War II that I've seen - far deeper and more psychologically penetrating than the recent ""Lives of Others.""

That is why in many European cities, the central hall for the performance of opera and classica music is called ""the Palace of Culture"" or some such name, whereas in America, where this ""kulturreligion"" never caught on to the degree it did in Europe, they simply have names like ""Lincoln Center"" or ""Carnegie Hall"".Wilhelm Furtwangler, the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic during the period of ""the Third Reich"" of Nazi horror, was one of the ""high priests"" of this Kulturreligion.  Thus, he, and the members of his orchestra are appalled when he finds himself forced to account for his collaboration with the Nazi regime.  This outstanding film shows the confrontation between Maj. Steve Arnold (played brilliantly by Harvey Keitel), who views it has his job to bring the Nazis and their sympathizers to justice, and Furtwangler who keeps insisting that ""Kultur and politics must be kept separate"" which he believes exempts him from any responsibilty for his actions.  We hear he and his musicians coming up with lame excuses why they performed at the Nuremberg Party Rallies and a birthday celebration for Hitler.  They claim that really Furtwangler was a big hero because he managed to avoid giving the Nazi salute by walking on-stage holding his conductor's baton in his right hand.  On the other hand, this ""high priest"" of Kultur was found to have used his position and close connections with the regime in order to have a hostile music critic sent to the Russian Front to perish at Stalingrad.Much of this is predictable, but the real punch the film gives occurs when Maj. Arnold's assistant, Lt Wills, who is a Jewish refugee from Germany and whose family members were destroyed in the Holocaust, in addition to his secretary, whose father was executed as a result of his involvement in the unsuccessful 20 July 1944 Bomb Plot on Hitler's Life, end up DEFENDING Furtwangler, claiming that Maj. Arnold is too harsh on him.This shows how insidious this ""Kulturreligion"" cult came to be.Maj. Arnold confronts Lt. Wills and says ""You are a Jew, how can you defend him?"".  The Jews fell into ""Kulturreligion""'s web doubly, not only using it as a crutch to replace their traditional Jewish religious and moral code, (just as the German non-Jews with their traditional morality), but they thought it would be their ""entry card"" into ""cultured"" German society, from which they had been previously excluded.  Even when ""cultured"" Germany turned into a monstrous, barbaric tyranny, Jews like Lt. Wills seem strangely attracted to it and Arnold's secretary admits that her father only turned against the regime when it was clear that Germany was going to lose the war.The lesson of this film is that justice and morality can be too easily waved away by false deities and without a clear moral compass, even the most ""civilized"" people, AND EVEN their victimscan fall into the abyss.

That nether land of doubt that exists when aftermath 'truths' can only be postulated and not proved is the fodder from which writer Ronald Harwood (who also wrote 'The Pianist') has created a terse and tense examination of the investigation by the Allied Forces of Conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler.  Was he a Nazi sympathizer or a protector of Jews during the Holocaust?  Director Istvan Szabo maintains the format of the original play to keep the story confined to the interrogation room, straying only momentarily to develop the characters of this quasi-trial.  Stellan Skarsgard is extraordiarily fine as the controversial Furtwangler, even taking on his body language and conducting moments to the realist edge.  As the Allied Forces interrogator Steven Arnold, Harvey Keitel is brilliant - seethingly angry, a hell-bent Major who refuses Furtwangler any semblance of respect.  Assisting Keitel are his secretary Emmi (in an astonishingly fine performance by Birgitt Minichmayr) and an Allied observer David (the equally fine Moritz Bleibtreu), a Jew who still holds the subject Furtwangler in deep respect.  But the magic is in the duets by Keitel and Skarsgard, sparring with personal venom and personal despair.  We are not given a decision as to the truth of Furtwangler's investigation, but we are told the results of the interviews.  All of the music is Beethoven and Schubert and Bruckner (the use of the Adagio from the Bruckner Symphony No. 7 is especially eloquent and meaningful) and is played from recordings by Furtwangler and the Berlin Philharmonic as well as by Daniel Barenboim and the Staatskapelle of Berlin.  This film is every bit as fine as the author's film of his THE PIANIST, but for some unknown reason it simply opened and closed in the theaters without making the impact it so justly deserves.

He also declined membership in the Nazi party.  Walking a tightrope, he conducted for Adolf Hitler's 53rd birthday, while refusing to give the Nazi salute.  Furtwangler's position was that politics and art must be kept separate.  Beethoven  would have disagreed and there are very few artists today, musical or otherwise, who would support Furtwangler's contention.Stellan Skarsgard neither looks like Furtwangler, acts like Furtwangler, nor makes any attempt to replicate the conductor's idiosyncratic baton technique.  Harvey Keitel gives a one-dimensional performance as Major Arnold, who was in charge of prosecuting, or in the filmmakers' view, persecuting the conductor.From the start, the Americans, with the exception of a German born American, are portrayed as culturally retarded, tone deaf, and driven by vengeance.  It is shameful that such a distinguished cast would consent to perform in such a ham handed display of anti-American fatuousness.Furtwangler's role -- or lack thereof -- in Nazi Germany has been  examined from many sides and merits serious discussion, not only for Furtwangler's culpability -- or lack thereof -- but as commentary of the role of the artist in society in general.

He doesn't understand how you can face the enemy without being outside the country as others did it. Toscanini, Klemperer, Schoenberg or Bruno Walter.Wilhelm Furtwangler holds his reasoning of keeping inside, holding the struggle face to face.There have always been these two points of view about how deal with that. Is really the politics more important than the art? It depends on you; and how you face the life; the ancient Greeks used call idiot to this kind of people who just care about his personal business; forgetting perhaps the meaning of what citizenship means.That's why Furtwangler develops his art of conducting. The art will always survive far beyond the politics ; due his goals are timeless ; the politics turns around another level , a minor level obviously , because the material needs of the human being concern to a major number of people than the art ; whose purpose is by its own nature more reduced, less popular , more aristocratic.And we are then before a democratic choice ; the art has been always in a less proportion than politics. The Renaissance fact concerned just about a few minds and men; and it's hard to think about if the achievements made by all this reborn spiritual could have been understood by the whole population.This film show both positions ; the trascendence against the present moment ; the aristos facing the vulgarity .Keitel and Sanksgard sre flamboyant in every role.

Messer,"[31, 47]","As an actor/producer who chose to do the play TAKING SIDES (on which this film is based) last May at the height of a new era of ""post war"" occupation by America, I feel I have particular insight into this product.I played Major Arnold, the bullish American who is so traumatized by the Holocaust brought on by the Germans that he is assigned to interrogate artists who stayed in Germany during the war.Furtwangler is the focus of this investigation, as the most renouned conductor of the time.  Furtwangler was wealthy, loved by Hitler as well as most Germans.  You see, art and culture was big to Nazi life, and though Furwangler never joined the party and actually helped some Jewish musicians escape, he chose to stay in Germany and work.  It is known that Hitler so loved him that there was a standing order to not touch him (he was on a list of ""immortals"" that were viewed as so important they got special treatment even in times of war and hardship.)  Furtwangler was openly defiant to other Nazi officials, and they hated him.LIke many Germans, they knew what the Nazis were up to only after the fact.  Then they were somewhat trapped.  Furtwangler admits to knowing the brutality.And that's the hard part of this piece.  There is no clear cut answer as to whom is more right in matters.  And if done well, the audience understands both ""Sides"" of this story. Even if they feel stronger leanings towards one side over the other.There are many parallels to some of the issues in today's current events that make this sampling of history 60 years ago, startling. History does indeed repeat itself in strange new ways.No doubt if you are a liberal, you will feel sympathy for Furtwangler, and agree with him that art can be more powerful than politics, and even negate the horrors of the Holocaust.If you are a Bush fan, you will no doubt find the tactics and mindset of Major Arnold to be on par with your views.I am a liberal, who painfully, and proudly found the humanity and soul of Arnold each and every night and presented it to an audience.The tragedy in all this is that each side always thinks it is right.  Hitler thought he was right. Saddam thought he was right.  Bush thinks he is right. Michael Moore thinks he is right.And they all have compelling arguements to back up their beleif.

800740,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0001DCR0C,Larry VanDeSande,"[3, 4]","""Taking Sides"" is the story of the U.S. Army's witch hunt to tie conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler to Nazi atrocities after World War II, when they stripped him of his ability to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which he had led from 1922-45. Furtwangler was eventually absolved of all charges against him for cooperating with the Nazis and resumed the directorship of the orchestra in 1948, which he held until his death in 1954.Furtwangler was, with Arutro Toscanini, the biggest name conductor in the world in the middle 20th century. Their competition across the Atlantic (Toscanini was in New York beginning in the 1930s) was similiar to the transatlantic competiton between Furtwangler's eventual successor, Herbert von Karajan, and Leonard Bernstein in New York from the 1950s through their deaths in 1989 and 1990, respectively. One of the oddities of the film is the American in charge of persecuting Furtwangler (Harvey Keitel monumentally miscast) is his trying to convince Furtwangler he stayed in Germany after Nazis rose to power to protect his position against the young upstart Karajan, whom they comically labeled ""little K.""Not much else in the movie is very funny, however, and too much of it is not all that good. Keitel is poorly cast in a role Gregory Peck would have relished in his prime and played in layers and degrees, while Stellan Skarsgard is equally poorly cast as the conductor Furtwangler. The Swede Skarsgard is about the same height as Furtwangler but otherwise bears no physical resemblance. He lacked the conductor's strange gait and his deliberate ways and demonstrated little variation in temperament. Poor casting in the two most important roles is the biggest strike against the film. I can only imagine what this would have been with actors the quality of Adrien Brody and Daniel Day-Lewis played the leading roles.Otherwise, this is a fairly interesting movie that has marginal success carving out the various philosophical arguments for and against Furtwangler's relative level of capitulation and participation in the Nazi regime's ongoing slaughter in Europe circa 1933-45. Just about all music fans, myself included, would judge Furtwangler innocent before seeing the film on the basis of the legend written about him in the musical press. This is all repeated in the film -- that he saved Jews, that he stayed in Germany to serve art, not politics, and that because he never gave the Nazi salute he was in no way a stooge of Hitler and his crowd.However, I found the evidence against Furtwangler, as argued by Keitel's character, to be equally successful. For instance, why did Furtwangler stay in Germany after it became clear in the 1930s that Jews were going to be executed? Was it for vanity? To maintain his personal position in European society? Wasn't Furtwangler, in doing so, little more than a poster boy for the Nazis? Wasn't he their front man? And, if his only pursuit was art and the Nazis liked other conducotrs, why did they play the Furtwangler-BPO recording of the Bruckner 7th Symphony in Berlin the day Hitler died? Wasn't that because they loved Furtwangler and revered him as part of Nazi establishment? For me, this discourse was the best part of the movie and the only place where either of the lead characters were continually effective. Skarsgard never had such moments.The European location shooting was quite good and the cinematography was excellent. As you might expect, marvelously restored recordings by Furtwangler leading the Berlin Philharmonic in Beethoven, Brahms and Bruckner were played throughout the movie. There was another scene of a quartet playing in Berlin in the rain -- because the auditorium no longer had a roof. A handful of other scenes were also effective in creating the aura of postwar Berlin. Unfortunately, poor casting in the two principal roles undid many of these good elements and cast the film as more of an average effort. Still, it's the only cinematic treatment of this particular piece of European history and, for that reason, I recommend it to anyone with interest. There are many fine extras, too, including interviews with the cast members and a brief discussion of the time and place of the events.",3,3.5 stars: fairly good but should have been much better,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,4223,"['Taking', 'Sides', 'story', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'witch', 'hunt', 'tie', 'conductor', 'Wilhelm', 'Furtwangler', 'Nazi', 'atrocities', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'stripped', 'ability', 'conduct', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'Orchestra', 'had', 'led', '1922-45', 'Furtwangler', 'was', 'eventually', 'absolved', 'charges', 'cooperating', 'Nazis', 'resumed', 'directorship', 'orchestra', '1948', 'held', 'death', '1954.Furtwangler', 'was', 'Arutro', 'Toscanini', 'biggest', 'name', 'conductor', 'world', 'middle', '20th', 'century', 'competition', 'Atlantic', 'Toscanini', 'was', 'New', 'York', 'beginning', '1930s', 'was', 'similiar', 'transatlantic', 'competiton', 'Furtwangler', 'eventual', 'successor', 'Herbert', 'von', 'Karajan', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'New', 'York', '1950s', 'deaths', '1989', '1990', 'respectively', 'One', 'oddities', 'film', 'American', 'charge', 'persecuting', 'Furtwangler', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'monumentally', 'miscast', 'trying', 'convince', 'Furtwangler', 'stayed', 'Germany', 'Nazis', 'rose', 'power', 'protect', 'position', 'young', 'upstart', 'Karajan', 'whom', 'comically', 'labeled', 'little', 'K.', 'Not', 'much', 'else', 'movie', 'very', 'funny', 'however', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'good', 'Keitel', 'poorly', 'cast', 'role', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'would', 'have', 'relished', 'prime', 'played', 'layers', 'degrees', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'equally', 'poorly', 'cast', 'conductor', 'Furtwangler', 'Swede', 'Skarsgard', 'same', 'height', 'Furtwangler', 'otherwise', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'lacked', 'conductor', 'strange', 'gait', 'deliberate', 'ways', 'demonstrated', 'little', 'variation', 'temperament', 'Poor', 'casting', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'roles', 'biggest', 'strike', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'actors', 'quality', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'played', 'leading', 'roles.Otherwise', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'marginal', 'success', 'carving', 'out', 'various', 'philosophical', 'arguments', 'Furtwangler', 'relative', 'level', 'capitulation', 'participation', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'ongoing', 'slaughter', 'Europe', 'circa', '1933-45', 'Just', 'music', 'fans', 'included', 'would', 'judge', 'Furtwangler', 'innocent', 'seeing', 'film', 'basis', 'legend', 'written', 'musical', 'press', 'repeated', 'film', 'saved', 'Jews', 'stayed', 'Germany', 'serve', 'art', 'not', 'politics', 'never', 'gave', 'Nazi', 'salute', 'was', 'way', 'stooge', 'Hitler', 'crowd.However', 'found', 'evidence', 'Furtwangler', 'argued', 'Keitel', 'character', 'be', 'equally', 'successful', 'instance', 'why', 'did', 'Furtwangler', 'stay', 'Germany', 'became', 'clear', '1930s', 'Jews', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'executed', 'Was', 'vanity', 'maintain', 'personal', 'position', 'European', 'society', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Furtwangler', 'doing', 'so', 'little', 'more', 'poster', 'boy', 'Nazis', 'Was', ""n't"", 'front', 'man', 'only', 'pursuit', 'was', 'art', 'Nazis', 'liked', 'other', 'conducotrs', 'why', 'did', 'play', 'Furtwangler-BPO', 'recording', 'Bruckner', '7th', 'Symphony', 'Berlin', 'day', 'Hitler', 'died', 'Was', ""n't"", 'that', 'loved', 'Furtwangler', 'revered', 'part', 'Nazi', 'establishment', 'discourse', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'lead', 'characters', 'were', 'continually', 'effective', 'Skarsgard', 'never', 'had', 'such', 'moments.The', 'European', 'location', 'shooting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'cinematography', 'was', 'excellent', 'might', 'expect', 'marvelously', 'restored', 'recordings', 'Furtwangler', 'leading', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'Beethoven', 'Brahms', 'Bruckner', 'were', 'played', 'movie', 'was', 'scene', 'quartet', 'playing', 'Berlin', 'rain', 'auditorium', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'roof', 'handful', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'effective', 'creating', 'aura', 'postwar', 'Berlin', 'Unfortunately', 'poor', 'casting', 'two', 'principal', 'roles', 'undid', 'many', 'good', 'elements', 'cast', 'film', 'more', 'average', 'effort', 'Still', 'only', 'cinematic', 'treatment', 'particular', 'piece', 'European', 'history', 'reason', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interest', 'are', 'many', 'fine', 'extras', 'too', 'including', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'brief', 'discussion', 'time', 'place', 'events']",Taking Sides VHS
800741,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0001DCR0C,Lawyeraau,"[12, 14]","This is an ambitious film in which playwright and novelist, Ronald Harwood, adapts his own play of the same name for the silver screen. Having successfully written the screenplay for the film, ""The Pianist"", which was based upon the best-selling memoir by Wladyslaw Szpilman,  Harwood is no less successful here. With the deft direction of renowned Hungarian director Istvan Szabo and the thespian efforts of its stellar cast, the film thematically explores a number of moral issues, though in the end, it leaves it to the viewer to resolve them.The film explores the aftermath of the fall of Hitler's Third Reich through the investigation by Allied Forces of world famous German conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler (Stellan Skarsgard). This was part of an investigative effort to discover Nazi collaborators within Germany's artistic community in the belief that there had been collusion between politics and art for the sake of politics. It was also believed that by rooting out Nazi sympathizers and collaborators among its influential members that the Nazi ideology would die a natural death in Germany for lack of iconic leaders.Wilhelm Furtwangler undergoes a series of interrogations by a Major Steve Arnold (Harvey Keitel), a  narrow-minded American officer, who has been given orders by his superior officer to find this musical icon guilty of war crimes at any cost. Furtwangler is suspected by the Americans of having been an influential Nazi sympathizer who, through his music, renown, and virtuosity, swayed the German people to march to Hitler's tune through their love of music, so deeply imbedded in the German psyche.Arnold, a claims examiner for an insurance company in his former civilian life, approaches his subject with all the disdain and disrespect he can muster. Thorough, yet loutish and seemingly culturally ignorant, the loud-mouthed Arnold is worlds apart from his targeted subject. Deeply affected by newsreels of the death camps in which millions were brutally killed, Arnold approaches Furtwangler as if the conductor had been an integral part of the final solution.Arnold's German secretary, Emmi (Birgitt Minichmayr), whose father was executed by the Nazis for an aborted plot to assassinate Hitler, and another Allied Forces officer, Davis Wills (Moritz Bliebtreu), a secular German Jew whose own parents died in Hitler's camps, are present during Arnold's impassioned interrogation of Furtwangler. Arnold's examination of thehapless Furtwangler sets the stage for the moral issues with which all the parties grapple and the viewer is left to ponder.Harvey Keitel is excellent as the self-appointed avenging angel who sees things only in black and white absolutes. Birgitt Minichmayr is outstanding as the conflicted secretary, whose remembrance of her own interrogation at the hands of the Gestapo causes her to lose regard for Arnold. Moritz Bliebtreu is compelling as David Wills, who remembers Furtwangler as having been instrumental in inspiring his love of music and deplores the tenor of Arnold's interrogation. It is Stellan Skarsgard as Furtwangler, however,  who steals the show. His sensitive and complex portrayal of the seemingly  morally ambiguous Furtwangler is pure cinematic artistry.Based upon true events, the film does not resolve the moral issues for the viewer. There is, however, a very telling  vintage clip that follows at the conclusion of the film that shows the real Wilhelm Furtwangler with Adolf Hitler. What transpires is quite interesting and subject to interpretation. It is also consistent with the moral ambiguity of the film. One will have to decide for oneself what spin one cares to place on what one sees and decide which side of the moral divide one places Furtwangler, as well as oneself. All in all, this is a compelling and complex film.

800742,A1Y87E22UVYCE6,B0001DCR0C,"Maximiliano F Yofre ""Maxi""","[6, 7]","""Taking Sides"" (2001) is a typical product from Istvan Szabo (Hungarian, born 1938), that means: it is a great movie.Before the present film, Szabo has directed ""Mephisto"" (1981), ""Colonel Redl"" (1985) and ""Hanussen"" (1988); all excellent works, addressing the same eternal dilemma: to BE or not to BE.Very skillfully Szabo never pass judgment on character's choices. He simply exposes the facts and let the viewer take sides.In the four films I mentioned, he works with real life characters, or as in ""Mephisto"", clearly based on an existing person.All the dramatic elements are displayed so the audience may decide. Yet deciding will not be easy. You will be forced to look deep into your own soul before you are able to say yay or nay.I'll give some examples to show how Mr. Szabo performs this.Ms. Straube's father was shot after he was involved in the plot to kill The German Dictator; yet as his daughter acknowledge he was a supporter of the Ruling Party until he realized that Germany was doomed and The German Dictator refuse to surrender.Lt. Wills when trying to convince Ms. Straube to return to work with them, uses the argument ""if you stick with us you may tame, somehow, Maj. Arnold""; basically the same justification to which Dr. Furtwangler resort to remain in Germany after the National Socialists take power.Maj. Arnold resorts to an abject informer to harass Dr. Furtwangler as the German Secret Police has done formerly.Col. Dymshitz (as Sazbo himself) is very aware as how come an intellectual to be pleased by elbowing those ""party brass"" and will, somehow, abdicate his principles.Maj. Arnold wonders why if all German people states ""we didn't know what they were doing to the Jews"", then afterwards they were eager to show how they had aided some Jew to evade this or that issue.Crowning every self indulging statement or auto-justification is this one: ""Oh no, we weren't performing at the Ruling Party rally, it was the night BEFORE!""There are other points of excellence of the film such as cinematography, in charge of Lajos Koltai, who had teamed with Szabo in the films I mentioned above and also in ""Being Julia"" (2004).The pastel palette of the films' colors, the beautiful takes of the huge stairways of the ""office"", the lovely composition of the very few outdoors photograms and the sage illumination of every scene are outstanding.Play acting is admirable: veteran Harvey Keitel with more than a hundred films gives one of his best performances, portraying Maj. Arnold, since his appearances in ""Bugsy"" (1991) or ""The Piano"" (1993).

800743,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0001DCR0C,mirasreviews,"[9, 13]","""Taking Sides"" is a fact-based account of the attempt to bring Dr. Wilhelm Furtwangler (Stellan Skarsgard), the globally renowned conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, to trial for ""serving the Nazi regime"". The film is based on the play by Ronald Harwood, who also wrote the script. The story takes place in 1946 while Berlin was occupied by American and Russian militaries. Major Steve Arnold (Harvey Keitel) of the U.S. Army has been assigned the task of determining who among Germany's artistic community aided the Nazi cause during the regime's 12-year reign. Dr. Furtwangler is suspect because he is not dead, and because his work was admired by prominent members of the Reich, including Adolph Hitler himself.The events depicted in ""Taking Sides"" did take place, although I'm not sure how accurate the film is in the details. The character of Furtwangler has been expanded upon to serve the film's themes. ""Taking Sides"" is deliberately morally ambiguous, preferring that the audience decide for itself who is guilty of what. Stellan Skarsgard and Harvey Keitel are both in top form. Skarsgard is one of cinema's finest character actors, and here he plays a man who has been defeated, at least temporarily, by the tide of history and who is at a loss to comprehend attacks on his character and good intentions. Keitel is perfection as the well-meaning Major Arnold, whose own intentions lead him to self-righteous delusion. As this was a play, the film takes place primarily on one set. But the occasional change of venue prevents this from becoming conspicuous. ""Taking Sides"" would be worth seeing for its fine performances. Although it takes place 58 years ago, its subject matter will never go out of style. Both Furtwangler and Arnold seem to have failed in their good intentions to one degree or another, or at least been too indiscriminate in their patriotism .The DVD: Bonus features consist of 9 interviews with cast and crew members and some behind-the-scenes footage entitled, appropriately enough, ""Behind the Scenes"".

800744,A2FUOXFJ74B32M,B0001DCR0C,"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[4, 7]","I just rented this after a recommendation from a fellow Amazonian. The film was quite good, although it could hardly be described as exciting, and I thought the overall production quality left much to be desired. Nevertheless, the film was intellectually and emotionally provacative, as it highlights the moral outrage by the occupying Americans in Berlin at any and everything Nazi related. Specifically, it follows one Major Arnold (Keitel) in his determined effort to indict the famous German conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler (Skarsgrd) for aiding and abetting the Nazi party. The much beloved and renowned Furtwangler is adamant in his innocence, although he is clearly racked with guilt for his association with the Third Reich. For his part, he claims that he was solely a musician, and he always strove to keep art and politics separate. He had no love for the Nazi party, but felt compelled to stay in his country rather than run away. The film seems to ask, where is the fine line between criminal accessory and dedication to your profession and/or country? Great performances by Keitel and Skarsgrd.One of the most interesting aspects for me was the conflict between Arnold and his assistant David Wills, the latter being an American Jew of German descent. Wills is far more sympathetic to Furtwangler and consistently tries to defend him against the ruthless Major. I don't really think the film itself ""took sides"" but tried to show the issue from both perspectives. I myself went back and forth and think that both men were ""right"" in their own way. It also goes without saying that we all have our personal biases which could sway us to one side or the other.As for being revisionist, I cannot say. It did seem that Major Arnold was a bit over the top at times, but I also don't see this necessarily being far-fetched. I can only imagine how the first hand experience of seeing the concentration camps would effect someone pyschologically. But is moral outrage an excuse for your own ruthlessness? This film seems to address this issue. All in all, a solid, intellectually and emotionally challenging film that I don't hesitate to recommend.",4,Whose side are you on?,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,2152,"['just', 'rented', 'recommendation', 'fellow', 'Amazonian', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'described', 'exciting', 'thought', 'overall', 'production', 'quality', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'was', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'provacative', 'moral', 'outrage', 'occupying', 'Americans', 'Berlin', 'everything', 'Nazi', 'related', 'Specifically', 'one', 'Major', 'Arnold', 'Keitel', 'determined', 'effort', 'indict', 'famous', 'German', 'conductor', 'Wilhelm', 'Furtwangler', 'Skarsgrd', 'aiding', 'abetting', 'Nazi', 'party', 'much', 'beloved', 'renowned', 'Furtwangler', 'adamant', 'innocence', 'clearly', 'racked', 'guilt', 'association', 'Third', 'Reich', 'part', 'was', 'solely', 'musician', 'always', 'strove', 'keep', 'art', 'politics', 'separate', 'had', 'love', 'Nazi', 'party', 'felt', 'compelled', 'stay', 'country', 'rather', 'run', 'away', 'film', 'ask', 'where', 'fine', 'line', 'criminal', 'accessory', 'dedication', 'profession', 'country', 'Great', 'performances', 'Keitel', 'Skarsgrd.One', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'was', 'conflict', 'Arnold', 'assistant', 'David', 'Wills', 'latter', 'being', 'American', 'Jew', 'German', 'descent', 'Wills', 'far', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Furtwangler', 'consistently', 'defend', 'ruthless', 'Major', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'film', 'took', 'sides', 'tried', 'show', 'issue', 'perspectives', 'went', 'back', 'forth', 'think', 'men', 'were', 'right', 'own', 'way', 'also', 'saying', 'have', 'personal', 'biases', 'could', 'sway', 'one', 'side', 'other.As', 'being', 'revisionist', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'did', 'seem', 'Major', 'Arnold', 'was', 'bit', 'top', 'times', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'necessarily', 'being', 'far-fetched', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'first', 'hand', 'experience', 'seeing', 'concentration', 'camps', 'would', 'effect', 'someone', 'pyschologically', 'moral', 'outrage', 'excuse', 'own', 'ruthlessness', 'film', 'address', 'issue', 'solid', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'challenging', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend']",Taking Sides VHS

800746,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,B0001DCR0C,T. Fisher,"[6, 8]","I am a conflicted fan of Wilhelm Furtwangler. He really was one of the greatest conductors in the last century -- I highly recommend everyone listen to his music. At the same time, he served the Nazi regime as head of what amounted to the national orchestra.Harvey Keitel plays Major Steve Arnold, who is assigned to prosecute the denazification case of Furtwangler, and to ""make an example"" of him. The Keitel character has come under strong criticism in other reviews here for his aggressive, some might say abusive stance in questioning Furtwangler, but I disagree. I think most of the things Arnold says to and about Furtwangler need to be said. It is not right to gloss over them, and they are not things that can be said over a cup of tea -- a certain amount of confrontation is called for.I agree that the Keitel character is overly aggressive at times, and yes, he is curmudgeonly and essentially one-dimensional. But on the whole, I would say my only real objection to his interrogation of Furtwangler as portrayed in the film is that Furtwangler was not allowed to have counsel present. Other than that, the issues he raises are pretty much fair game. His job was to prosecute, and basically he did what prosecutors do.I would be very interested to see a film about what REALLY happened in Furtwangler's denazification proceedings. This is fiction, and that must be kept in mind. But also keep in mind that the denazification process in West Germany was a great success, mainly because the US took it very seriously. Germany benefited from the process, which surely seemed excessive at the time but has now resulted in a society that has accepted multiculturalism and diversity much better than most others in Europe. Sure, the situation is not perfect, but it's quite a bit worse elsewhere. This derives in part from the US's insistence in the late 1940s that ordinary citizens take a hard look at what was done.Sure, the US didn't get it all right, there were mistakes and overzealousness, especially in areas like primary education. But overall, denazification was a wild success in West Germany.It was was less of a priority in other places. This is true of Austria and a number of Axis countries that got stuck behind the Iron Curtain, notably East Germany and Hungary. The failure to look the past squarely in the eye 60 years ago still shows up in nasty ways in these societies today. Western Germany got it right -- and that in significant part because there were people asking the kind of questions that the obnoxious Harvey Keitel character asked, rather than taking the ""let sleeping dogs lie"" approach used elsewhere.In this sense, ""Taking Sides"" offers a thoughtful look at two separate topics. First is the denazification era and the kind of issues that were dealt with -- it is a very instructive, if simplified and specialized, look at the mood and mindset of the time.The second topic is the heavy musical angle and an examination of Furtwangler specifically, which I think is a must for anyone who wants to enjoy his music. Furtwangler doesn't need to be condemned, and I do not wish to condemn him. But listening to his music, especially his wartime recordings, without considering their moral context seems a dicey proposition. Leading the Berlin Philharmonic was not a morally or politically neutral job in those times, especially given the propaganda role ""great German music"" played in the Nazi regime.This movie does not give answers, but it raises the right questions for fans of Furtwangler -- and for that matter, Karajan, who had a much easier time, perhaps unjustifiably so, because his denazification proceedings took place in Austria and because he was not yet nearly as big a fish as Furtwangler.For anyone interested in this film I also highly recommend the documentary ""The Reichsorchester"", also about the Berlin Philharmonic during the Nazi era. Chilling stuff, further illustrating the kind of political naivete BPO musicians -- and likely Furtwangler himself -- had about their role at the time.And please don't get me wrong -- I love Furtwangler's work and actually sympathize with the man. I just believe the complexity has to be recognized, not glossed over.I'm very glad Furtwangler was exonerated, but to suggest he should not have been subject to more than perfunctory scrutiny because of his outstanding talent is absurd.",5,A fascinating look at musical denazification,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,4376,"['am', 'conflicted', 'fan', 'Wilhelm', 'Furtwangler', 'really', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'conductors', 'last', 'century', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'listen', 'music', 'same', 'time', 'served', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'head', 'what', 'amounted', 'national', 'orchestra.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Major', 'Steve', 'Arnold', 'who', 'assigned', 'prosecute', 'denazification', 'case', 'Furtwangler', 'make', 'example', 'Keitel', 'character', 'come', 'strong', 'criticism', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'aggressive', 'might', 'say', 'abusive', 'stance', 'questioning', 'Furtwangler', 'disagree', 'think', 'most', 'things', 'Arnold', 'Furtwangler', 'need', 'be', 'said', 'not', 'right', 'gloss', 'are', 'not', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'cup', 'tea', 'certain', 'amount', 'confrontation', 'called', 'for.I', 'agree', 'Keitel', 'character', 'overly', 'aggressive', 'times', 'yes', 'curmudgeonly', 'essentially', 'one-dimensional', 'whole', 'would', 'say', 'only', 'real', 'objection', 'interrogation', 'Furtwangler', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Furtwangler', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'have', 'counsel', 'present', 'Other', 'issues', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'fair', 'game', 'job', 'was', 'prosecute', 'basically', 'did', 'what', 'prosecutors', 'do.I', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'film', 'what', 'REALLY', 'happened', 'Furtwangler', 'denazification', 'proceedings', 'fiction', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'mind', 'also', 'keep', 'mind', 'denazification', 'process', 'West', 'Germany', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'mainly', 'US', 'took', 'very', 'seriously', 'Germany', 'benefited', 'process', 'surely', 'seemed', 'excessive', 'time', 'now', 'resulted', 'society', 'accepted', 'multiculturalism', 'diversity', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'others', 'Europe', 'Sure', 'situation', 'not', 'perfect', 'quite', 'bit', 'worse', 'elsewhere', 'part', 'US', 'insistence', 'late', '1940s', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'take', 'hard', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'done.Sure', 'US', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'were', 'mistakes', 'overzealousness', 'especially', 'areas', 'primary', 'education', 'overall', 'denazification', 'was', 'wild', 'success', 'West', 'Germany.It', 'was', 'was', 'less', 'priority', 'other', 'places', 'true', 'Austria', 'number', 'Axis', 'countries', 'got', 'stuck', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'notably', 'East', 'Germany', 'Hungary', 'failure', 'look', 'past', 'squarely', 'eye', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'up', 'nasty', 'ways', 'societies', 'today', 'Western', 'Germany', 'got', 'right', 'significant', 'part', 'were', 'people', 'asking', 'kind', 'questions', 'obnoxious', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'character', 'asked', 'rather', 'taking', 'let', 'sleeping', 'dogs', 'lie', 'approach', 'used', 'elsewhere.In', 'sense', 'Taking', 'Sides', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'two', 'separate', 'topics', 'First', 'denazification', 'era', 'kind', 'issues', 'were', 'dealt', 'very', 'instructive', 'simplified', 'specialized', 'look', 'mood', 'mindset', 'time.The', 'second', 'topic', 'heavy', 'musical', 'angle', 'examination', 'Furtwangler', 'specifically', 'think', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'music', 'Furtwangler', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'condemned', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'condemn', 'listening', 'music', 'especially', 'wartime', 'recordings', 'considering', 'moral', 'context', 'dicey', 'proposition', 'Leading', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'was', 'not', 'morally', 'politically', 'neutral', 'job', 'times', 'especially', 'given', 'propaganda', 'role', 'great', 'German', 'music', 'played', 'Nazi', 'regime.This', 'movie', 'not', 'give', 'answers', 'right', 'questions', 'fans', 'Furtwangler', 'matter', 'Karajan', 'who', 'had', 'much', 'easier', 'time', 'perhaps', 'unjustifiably', 'so', 'denazification', 'proceedings', 'took', 'place', 'Austria', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'nearly', 'as', 'big', 'fish', 'Furtwangler.For', 'anyone', 'interested', 'film', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'Reichsorchester', 'also', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'Nazi', 'era', 'Chilling', 'stuff', 'further', 'illustrating', 'kind', 'political', 'naivete', 'BPO', 'musicians', 'likely', 'Furtwangler', 'had', 'role', 'time.And', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Furtwangler', 'work', 'actually', 'sympathize', 'man', 'just', 'believe', 'complexity', 'be', 'recognized', 'not', 'glossed', 'over.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'Furtwangler', 'was', 'exonerated', 'suggest', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'more', 'perfunctory', 'scrutiny', 'outstanding', 'talent', 'absurd']",Taking Sides VHS
800747,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B0001DCR0C,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[28, 33]","Taking Sides starts with a superb scene.  We are at a concert in Berlin as the great maestro Wilhelm Furtwangler conducts Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to a rapt audience.  (Ironically, the piece was also a symbol of victory of the allies, with it's da-da-da-duum motto suggesting dot-dot-dot-dash--Morse Code for ""V[ictory]."")  At the height of the drama, there's an air raid, spotlights start shining outside, and the lights in the hall eventually go out.  It really happened.  Both sides played Beethoven while bombs fell.  Some recordings have even been preserved, and one can hear Wanda Landowska in London, for example, performing as bombs dropped around her.Unfortunately, the rest of the movies doesn't live up to that great opening moment, or to another moment a short while later where a crowd of post-war music lovers sits in a bombed out cathedral, umbrellas raised, listening to Schubert in the rain.  It's hard to give such a high-minded and ambitious film as ""Taking Sides"" a less-than-great evaluation (can you imagine sitting in a room and pitching this to a production company???), but ""Taking Sides"" disappoints and delights in almost equal measures.  I have been wishing for years that someone would make a movie about classical music in this period in history and finally someone has.  Unfortuantely, the budget on this was probably very very small, and it shows.  But one doesn't have to necessarily have lots of bucks to make a great film.  Still, the ability to film on more locations, better CGI effects (yes, this film has CGI effects in the form of bombed out buildings) and *a better editor* would have all helped things a bit.  The editor on this picture was all thumbs, filling some scenes with inexplicably quick cutaway shots lasting fractions of a section, leaving other scenes to be one-shot monologues, even when you think it would be better to see a reaction, and inserting jump cuts awkwardly.  We go from closeups to extreme long shots back to closeups without any rhyme or reason I can see (for a better example of how to handle this kind of shooting and editing, watch Patton), scenes are dropped carelessly in, with no thought to entrance or exit, and a whole subplot with a Russian officer who wants to trade ""five conductors for my favorite Wilhelm Furtwangler"" could have been reduced to one scene, or even left on the cutting room floor.  It's so insignificant that I've been reading critics' reviews of the film on line all night, and not one has even mentioned it.  It's five minutes of padding and just interrupts the main dramatic line.Harvey Keitel plays his part with a little too much bluster from the getgo, so there's never a buildup.  His one-note performance wears thin, and I'm not sure why they made the representative of one side of the argument a pig-headed ignoramus who in his way is as reprehensible as the Nazi barbarians he rails against.  And the big moment at the end (I won't spoil it) regarding a recordng of the Adagio of the Bruckner 7th fell flat to me, because that seems to be one of the things you really *couldn't* fault Furtwangler for.  And I would really like to know a little more about *how* Furtwangler saved some of his musicians from the death camps; having Keitel brush that away as besides the point was a cop-out on the film's part.I kept waiting for the two minor characters, the secretary and the junior officer, to find something revelatory in that library search once they seemed to turn sides, but they never did.  A lot of background information was tantilizingly hinted at, but that part of the story didn't feel fleshed out enough.  I'm a subscriber to the Henry James theory of drama: if there's a gun on page one, by the end of the story it has to go off.  To me there were some guns in this script that had their triggers cocked but were never fired.  Pity.  For example, early on, Furtwangler points out that other conductors who were far more implicated (Herbert von Karajan, for example) had already been cleared and were back to conducting.  I would like to have known more about that--why and was there ""politics"" involved and who ultimately made these decisions.  We could have seen Furtwangler's personal affects, what he had and what sort of ""trunk"" he was living out of.  I would like to have learned more about how the post war conditions were affected Furtangler's life--his meager living situation and his reliance on the kindness of strangers--instead of just seeing him shuffle into the interrogation room every day.But that's not to slight Stellan Skarsgard's performance, which is remarkable--while he didn't look much like Furtwangler and they didn't even try (too much hair!), I forgot all about that after five minutes, and thought about George C. Scott's comments about portraying General George Patton: what was important was not an exact resemblance but rather giving the *impression* of the man.  Skarsgard certainly does that, based on the footage I've seen of Furtwangler, though the two definitely had different conducting styles!Some have complained of the claustrophobia of the film, because it comes from a stageplay.  I am more bothered by, as I said, strange choices of editing, never really letting us move around and breathe in the environment we're in.  Remember that great scene in Chinatown where Jack Nicholson goes snoooing through the desk of the water commissioner early in the film?  You learn a lot about the man and the time period in that scene.  And as Jack explores LA, you breathe the air of the 1930s and feel like you're ""living"" there with the characters, and it's all done in an effortless way.  This film could have used some of that, and a little less of Keitel and Skarsgard screaming over a desk.The best moment may be saved for last.  While Furtwangler never does convince Keitel's character of his sincerity--how could he?--and we are left wondering if perhaps Furtwangler's defense was more of an excuse than a defense, we cut to archival footage of the real Furtwangler at a concert.  Nazi officers, including Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Goering, are present.  After the event, Goebbles walks to the podium to shake Furtwangler's hand.  (The movie talks a lot about a handshake with Hitler and seems to imply this is it, but in truth the famous photo is of Furtwangler *bowing* to Hitler as Hitler remains seated.)  After touching the hand of the propaganda minister, Furtwangler discreetly does something that says more about his true feelings than all the fighting across a desk ever could.The DVD image is sharp, and the sound is excellent.  There are some talking head interviews about the production, and a puzzling six minute ""Making of"" short that has no narration, no structure, and very little sound, and just appears to be randomly strung-together bits of behind-the-scenes footage.  It's totally pointless.",3,A good film that could have been a great film...,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,6889,"['Taking', 'Sides', 'superb', 'scene', 'are', 'concert', 'Berlin', 'great', 'maestro',

The investigating officer is portrayed as a carpet-chewing, Ugly American jack-ass, rabidly, single-mindedly dedicated to the shredding of Wilhelm Furtwangler, and there is never any attempt to even suggest why WF became the target of this hatchet job when so many high profile, Party member artists so quickly had their tickets punched: ""de-Nazified"".Stellan Skarsgard tries valiantly to save the film with a thoughtful, nuanced performance as WF, but it is really, perversely, All About Harvey and his Big Brass Band.The frequently un-focused nature of this sometimes almost amateurish production is high-lighted--if not epitomized--by a night club scene shoe-horned, with Zanuck-like non-necessity, in the middle of things with wonderfully prodigal casting. Dressed down as a uniformed USO chanteuse, but no whit erotically suppressed for all the blandness of her outfit, the sultry Rinat Shaham squanders her considerable contralto talents on a throaty rendition of ""Route 66"", a silly novelty number of the `40's to which the years have been singularly unkind.",2,Keitel drums,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,1354,"['Thanks', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'bringing', 'up', 'Furtwangler', 'question', 'too', 'bad', 'opened', 'up', 'expanded', 'screen', 'version', 'fails', 'even', 'did', 'original', 'play', 'establishing', 'center', 'gravity', 'not', 'German', 'conductor', 'character', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'toed-out', 'brogans', 'investigating', 'officer', 'portrayed', 'carpet-chewing', 'Ugly', 'American', 'jack-ass', 'rabidly', 'single-mindedly', 'dedicated', 'shredding', 'Wilhelm', 'Furtwangler', 'never', 'attempt', 'even', 'suggest', 'why', 'WF', 'became', 'target', 'hatchet', 'job', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'high', 'profile', 'Party', 'member', 'artists', 'so', 'quickly', 'had', 'tickets', 'punched', 'de-Nazified', '.Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'valiantly', 'save', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'WF', 'really', 'perversely', 'Harvey', 'Big', 'Brass', 'Band.The', 'frequently', 'un-focused', 'nature', 'almost', 'amateurish', 'production', 'high-lighted', 'not', 'epitomized', 'night', 'club', 'scene', 'shoe-horned', 'Zanuck-like', 'non-necessity', 'middle', 'things', 'wonderfully', 'prodigal', 'casting', 'Dressed', 'down', 'uniformed', 'USO', 'chanteuse', 'whit', 'erotically', 'suppressed', 'blandness', 'outfit', 'sultry', 'Rinat', 'Shaham', 'considerable', 'contralto', 'talents', 'throaty', 'rendition', 'Route', '66', 'silly', 'novelty', 'number', '40', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'singularly', 'unkind']",Taking Sides VHS
