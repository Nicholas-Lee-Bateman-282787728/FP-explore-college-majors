It was a shocker to see Jenny McCarthey with a very small roll but kind of glad since she did a really bad job with her hick accent and all she did was walk around in a mini skirt and cut off shirts.  Anyway, the script was really bad.  There were some funny moments, but for the most part there were just corny jokes constantly that didn't get a laugh out of my husband or I.  Surely this movie will be left in our album to collect dust and never see the light of day again.

1143013,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B0013J9KIU,David Girod,"[0, 0]","If you are planning on picking up ""Witless Protection"", then I would say it's a fair guess your not hoping for a film full of witty, dry or subtle humor. My guess is you want something that will allow you to turn off your brain for 90 minutes and have a few chuckles. If you are like me, and enjoy a good fart joke then ""Witless Protection"" isn't a bad little flick. If you are looking for something a little deeper, maybe you should keep looking.Larry the Cable Guy plays a clueless small town deputy who forces his way into an FBI Witness Protection job when he believes a woman passing through town is being kidnapped. The meager plot is simply a place setting which allows Larry to interact with uptight FBI agents, pompous rich folks, hit men and assorted other fish-out-of-water stereotypes so often found in this type of flick.I got some great laughs out of this movie, like when Larry has to go through airport security or when he's trying to pay for a hotel room with cash and argues with the hotel manager. There are tons of little one liners sprinkled throughout the film that will keep a smile on your face.So would I recommend this movie? Sure, as long as you put your brain in neutral, don't go into ""Witless Protection"" expecting a hilarious ""Animal House""-like film.

1143017,A153MVFR0FTI6O,B0013J9KIU,John Nelson,"[9, 13]","I'm about to commit some kind of sacrilege.  I love Larry the Cable Guy, I stuck up for his past few movies, which got almost panned across the board and I really was hoping that this third time would be the charm, that a few critics would lighten up and the movie would draw some decent cash.  Sadly that is not the case and I am about to half heartedly recommend Larry's newest movie.Larry here (still playing himself so arguably his presence is a natural one) is a small town deputy sheriff who is in training to be an FBI agent.  He's in a cafe chatting away with his pals and his gal Connie when an SUV filled with suits suddenly pulls over for a break and among the group is Madeline, whom Larry believes has been kidnapped.  Smelling not a fart, but an opportunity to prove himself of being an FBI agent follows the SUV and takes the girl Madeline, only problem is that she is WITH the FBI and now he kidnapped her.  Larry however remains convinced that she was kidnapped and builds his evidence along the way to a conclusion where hilarity doesn't ensue.Why not?  Admittedly Larry's catchphrases and shtick which play better on stage are wearing out at the theater and Madeline actually gets better lines then Larry does which shouldn't happen. Madelin and Larry's chemsitry is weird too, a proper European woman with a Southern Bumpkin who warm up to each other chugs with a the grace of a dying Chevy.  No one scene in Witless Protection really soars or made me laugh out loud either, some scenes just play out with lines I know are supposed to be funny but didn't work.  The polo match where Larry bull in a chinas hops his way to a win is the only case and that was slight.  A fist fight in a museum room could have been great but also misses.By the way, did I mention Yaphet Kotto's character name is the same here as it was in the vastly superior Midnight Run?  Thats a crime.Larry, I love you but this movie wasn't that great.  It was better a movie then I thought it would be, but it's not as funny as it should have been.  At least for Larry's crybaby audience his gay/foreigner humor is toned down, which is good, but people will still whine at what is left in the movie, especially Larry's attempt to get a hotel room.  Irregardless the film wasn't as funny as it should have been and I'm afraid that if another Larry movie tanks, his screen name could be Larry the Direct to home Video Guy.",3,Git R' Don't?,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,2410,"[""'m"", 'commit', 'kind', 'sacrilege', 'love', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'stuck', 'up', 'past', 'few', 'movies', 'got', 'almost', 'panned', 'board', 'really', 'was', 'hoping', 'third', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'charm', 'few', 'critics', 'would', 'lighten', 'up', 'movie', 'would', 'draw', 'decent', 'cash', 'Sadly', 'not', 'case', 'am', 'half', 'heartedly', 'recommend', 'Larry', 'newest', 'movie.Larry', 'here', 'still', 'playing', 'so', 'arguably', 'presence', 'natural', 'one', 'small', 'town', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'who', 'training', 'be', 'FBI', 'agent', 'cafe', 'chatting', 'away', 'pals', 'gal', 'Connie', 'when', 'SUV', 'filled', 'suits', 'suddenly', 'over', 'break', 'group', 'Madeline', 'whom', 'Larry', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'Smelling', 'not', 'fart', 'opportunity', 'prove', 'being', 'FBI', 'agent', 'SUV', 'girl', 'Madeline', 'only', 'problem', 'FBI', 'now', 'kidnapped', 'Larry', 'however', 'convinced', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'builds', 'evidence', 'way', 'conclusion', 'where', 'hilarity', ""n't"", 'ensue.Why', 'not', 'Admittedly', 'Larry', 'catchphrases', 'shtick', 'play', 'better', 'stage', 'are', 'wearing', 'out', 'theater', 'Madeline', 'actually', 'better', 'lines', 'then', 'Larry', 'should', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Madelin', 'Larry', 'chemsitry', 'weird', 'too', 'proper', 'European', 'woman', 'Southern', 'Bumpkin', 'who', 'warm', 'up', 'other', 'chugs', 'grace', 'dying', 'Chevy', 'one', 'scene', 'Witless', 'Protection', 'really', 'made', 'loud', 'scenes', 'just', 'play', 'out', 'lines', 'know', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'polo', 'match', 'where', 'Larry', 'bull', 'chinas', 'way', 'win', 'only', 'case', 'was', 'slight', 'fist', 'fight', 'museum', 'room', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'also', 'misses.By', 'way', 'did', 'mention', 'Yaphet', 'Kotto', 'character', 'name', 'same', 'here', 'was', 'vastly', 'superior', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'crime.Larry', 'love', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'then', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'Larry', 'crybaby', 'audience', 'gay/foreigner', 'humor', 'toned', 'down', 'good', 'people', 'will', 'still', 'whine', 'what', 'left', 'movie', 'especially', 'Larry', 'attempt', 'get', 'hotel', 'room', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'should', 'have', 'been', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Larry', 'movie', 'tanks', 'screen', 'name', 'could', 'be', 'Larry', 'Direct', 'home', 'Video', 'Guy']",Witless Protection

My biggest disappointments were Peter Stormare pretending to be a rich guy with British accent, and Ivana Milicevic changing her moods from bitchy to happy too often and too quickly. These two are great actors and it had to take some talent to make them play so amateurishly.And yes, there's lots of fart-related and other politically incorrect jokes, but that's a given with Larry the Cable Guy.

A lengthy cross country chase ensues with the agents hot on the heels of this nitwit law enforcer and his unwitting ""hostage.""Armed with crime-fighting knowledge he's gleaned primarily from cable TV, and with a malapropism for every occasion, Larry bumbles his way from one outlandish situation to the next, somehow managing to stay one step ahead of the authorities at all times.Larry the Cable Guy has that rare ability to perform low comedy routines without having to resort to self-conscious mugging to garner laughs.  Likewise, Ivana Milicevic, Eric Roberts, Joe Mantegna, Jenny McCarthy and a whole host of other comic actors throw themselves into their roles with a great deal of abandon and aplomb.The humor is broad (to put it mildly), but it is more often fleet-footed than flatfooted, and the whole enterprise is so dopey and good-natured that you may just find yourself chuckling right along with all the goofiness - provided, that is, you can put your brain on hold for the full hour-and-a-half that the movie takes to play itself out.",3,proof that witlessness can sometimes actually be fun,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,1600,"['***1/2Larry', 'Stalder', 'small', 'town', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'sagging', 'midsection', 'grandiose', 'dream', 'one', 'day', 'becoming', 'agent', 'FBI', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'enhance', 'chances', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'when', 'rescues', 'woman', 'whom', 'mistakenly', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'what', 'gang', 'sunglass-wearing', 'mobsters', 'actuality', 'are', 'federal', 'agents', 'transporting', 'whistle-blower', 'trial', 'Chicago', 'where', 'testimony', 'could', 'spell', 'big', 'trouble', 'powerful', 'Enron-type', 'CEO', 'whom', 'was', 'once', 'romantically', 'involved', 'lengthy', 'cross', 'country', 'chase', 'ensues', 'agents', 'hot', 'heels', 'nitwit', 'law', 'enforcer', 'unwitting', 'hostage', 'Armed', 'crime-fighting', 'knowledge', 'gleaned', 'primarily', 'cable', 'TV', 'malapropism', 'occasion', 'Larry', 'way', 'one', 'outlandish', 'situation', 'next', 'somehow', 'managing', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'authorities', 'times.Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'rare', 'ability', 'perform', 'low', 'comedy', 'routines', 'having', 'resort', 'self-conscious', 'mugging', 'garner', 'laughs', 'Likewise', 'Ivana', 'Milicevic', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'comic', 'actors', 'throw', 'roles', 'great', 'deal', 'abandon', 'aplomb.The', 'humor', 'broad', 'put', 'mildly', 'more', 'often', 'fleet-footed', 'flatfooted', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'so', 'dopey', 'good-natured', 'may', 'just', 'find', 'chuckling', 'right', 'goofiness', 'provided', 'can', 'put', 'brain', 'hold', 'full', 'hour-and-a-half', 'movie', 'play', 'out']",Witless Protection

Larry did not transition well onto the big screen. When I think of redneck, slapstick, sweet and funny with the underdog as the hero, my mind immediately goes to Jim Varney's 'Ernest P. Worrell', whose shoes Larry or other rednecks or redneck wannabes, will never be able to fill. I can't be the only one who sees Larry's attempts to mirror the lovable hayseed, Ernest. There is the hat, the accent, the clothes, the stand-up comedy then moving over into movies. This movie has too much crude humor and disgusting bathroom jokes and there is no excuse for the racist comments, especially in a movie such as this. The(dare I say it?) plot was weaker than the pulse of a comatose patient.*(And I am not making light of people who have suffered or are suffering through this.) ""Witless Protection"" has deterred me from watching any of the other Larry movies. I think it's best for him to stick to stand-up comedy, which does work better for him. I'm from the South and I think that Larry does give us a bad name. You can do comedy without making fun of other races, sexual orientation or using over the top sexual comments and bathroom humor(One fart joke will do, sometimes). Is this what has become of America? Have we really sunk so low that every ridiculous script/movie is greelighted just because of a t.v. personalities' previous work? A good stand-up comedian doesn't necessarily translate to a good movie actor. Some people have it. Some don't.

I must say that this movie is a little more funny that Delta Farce. It is well-casted and had some great, funny moments.  The humor surrounding the FBI agents was pretty good (i.e., an agents whose last name is Orange, so ""Agent Orange"") and it was great to see Yaphett Kotto after not seeing him in a movie for more than 5 years. Also, seeing Eric Roberts roam around in a jacket with the large letters ""PMS"" was pretty fair, too.  I think you really need to be in a certain mood when taking in a new movie.
