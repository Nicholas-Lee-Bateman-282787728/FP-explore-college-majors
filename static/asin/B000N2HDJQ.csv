He's not just a pretty face (although Goddess knows he is that), but he's smart and wise and sensitive and . . . OK, like I said, I'm irrational about him.So maybe this extended interview by and for the Actor's Studio impressed me more than it would someone who is not gaga over the man, if there is such a person. He talks frankly about his career, the roles he has played, and a good bit about his private life as well. He is that charming rebel that women cannot help loving, and lots of men too. There are clips from his movies, but since this was done in 2002, they don't include some of his best roles.",5,Young Actors and Wannabes Can Learn a Great Deal from Depp,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,816,"[""'m"", 'going', 'tell', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'think', 'roommate', 'Keith', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'think', 'why', 'like', 'so', 'much.I', 'am', 'totally', 'love', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'am', 'irrational', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'Goddess', 'smart', 'wise', 'sensitive', 'OK', 'said', ""'m"", 'irrational', 'him.So', 'maybe', 'extended', 'interview', 'Actor', 'Studio', 'impressed', 'more', 'would', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'gaga', 'man', 'such', 'person', 'frankly', 'career', 'roles', 'played', 'good', 'bit', 'private', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'charming', 'rebel', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'loving', 'lots', 'men', 'too', 'are', 'clips', 'movies', 'was', 'done', '2002', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'best', 'roles']",Inside the Actors Studio: Johnny Depp

I found the interview totally interesting and informative.  Johnny's honest and down to earth responses were refreshing and at times quite amusing.

1052418,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000N2HDJQ,Cubist,"[19, 20]","Johnny Depp has always seemed like a character actor trapped in a leading man's body. He was initially cast as a teen heart throb in the popular television show,21 Jump Street - The Complete First Season- a role he grew uncomfortable with because he saw himself being transformed into a commodity for a corporation. So, he decided to deconstruct this image by starring in cult filmmaker John WatersCry Baby (Director's Cut). He never looked back, starring in a number of diverse films that saw him playing a colourful assortment of oddball outsiders, fromDead MantoFear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Criterion Collection.Depp finally sat down with James Lipton in 2002 for an episode of Inside the Actors Studio. It seems rather odd that he would get a career perspective so early in his life, but he has assembled an impressive resume which this show skims broadly over. Depp talks about how he got into music, joined a band and how this led to his first acting gig in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Unfortunately, Lipton skips over Depp's pivotal role in Cry-Baby and instead delves into his first collaboration with Tim Burton with Edward Scissorhands.Depp also talks about how he got the role in Ed Wood and how he approached the character as well as what influenced his performance: a mix of Ronald Reagan, the Tin Man and Casey Kasem. Thankfully, they cover Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and talk about how he got involved in the project and how he lived with Hunter S. Thompson in order to portray him accurately. Sadly, some of his other films, like Dead Man and The Ninth Gate, aren't discussed leaving you wanting for more. This is certainly not a comprehensive profile but rather a primer on Depp's life and career.",4,Not as comprehensive as it could have been,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1721,"['Johnny', 'Depp', 'always', 'seemed', 'character', 'actor', 'trapped', 'leading', 'man', 'body', 'was', 'initially', 'cast', 'teen', 'heart', 'throb', 'popular', 'television', 'show,21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season-', 'role', 'grew', 'uncomfortable', 'saw', 'being', 'transformed', 'commodity', 'corporation', 'So', 'decided', 'deconstruct', 'image', 'starring', 'cult', 'filmmaker', 'John', 'WatersCry', 'Baby', 'Director', 'Cut', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'starring', 'number', 'diverse', 'films', 'saw', 'playing', 'colourful', 'assortment', 'oddball', 'outsiders', 'fromDead', 'MantoFear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Criterion', 'Collection.Depp', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'James', 'Lipton', '2002', 'episode', 'Inside', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'rather', 'odd', 'would', 'get', 'career', 'perspective', 'so', 'early', 'life', 'assembled', 'impressive', 'resume', 'show', 'broadly', 'Depp', 'talks', 'how', 'got', 'music', 'joined', 'band', 'how', 'led', 'first', 'acting', 'gig', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Unfortunately', 'Lipton', 'Depp', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Cry-Baby', 'instead', 'delves', 'first', 'collaboration', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands.Depp', 'also', 'how', 'got', 'role', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'how', 'approached', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'influenced', 'performance', 'mix', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'Thankfully', 'cover', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'talk', 'how', 'got', 'involved', 'project', 'how', 'lived', 'Hunter', 'S.', 'Thompson', 'order', 'portray', 'accurately', 'Sadly', 'other', 'films', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'are', ""n't"", 'discussed', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'certainly', 'not', 'comprehensive', 'profile', 'rather', 'primer', 'Depp', 'life', 'career']",Inside the Actors Studio: Johnny Depp
