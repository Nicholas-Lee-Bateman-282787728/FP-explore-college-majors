1570360,ACHCC3FF7ISFH,B008MIMWQC,BigAl64,"[2, 2]",Drew Barrymore has really grown as an actress.  These three movies not only show that but also her comedic talents.  These are no brain er movies that are just fun to watch.  Seeing Hugh Grant dancing and singing was a great treat.  For the price you can't beat this deal.,5,Enjoyed all three,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,272,"['Drew', 'Barrymore', 'really', 'grown', 'actress', 'three', 'movies', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'also', 'comedic', 'talents', 'are', 'brain', 'er', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'Seeing', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'dancing', 'singing', 'was', 'great', 'treat', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'deal']",Drew Barrymore Triple Feature: (The Wedding Singer / Music and Lyrics / Going the Distance)

I honestly bought it more for &#34;The Wedding Singer&#34; as that movie always makes me laugh.  However, I really did like the movie &#34;Music and Lyrics&#34; with Hugh Grant and &#34;Going The Distance&#34; was one I had never seen and was pleased with as well.  The blu-ray transfer looked great on all three movies, and when I bought this, it was only $10 so you couldn't ask for a better deal to have three good movies at this price!!",4,Good blu-ray Triple Feature!!,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,500,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'definite', 'buy', 'honestly', 'bought', 'more', '34', 'Wedding', 'Singer', '34', 'movie', 'always', 'However', 'really', 'did', 'movie', '34', 'Music', 'Lyrics', '34', 'Hugh', 'Grant', '34', 'Going', 'Distance', '34', 'was', 'one', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'pleased', 'as', 'well', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'looked', 'great', 'three', 'movies', 'when', 'bought', 'was', 'only', '10', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'deal', 'have', 'three', 'good', 'movies', 'price']",Drew Barrymore Triple Feature: (The Wedding Singer / Music and Lyrics / Going the Distance)

All three movies are good and the story lines work well with each other. Sometimes they put movies that have nothing to do with each other together. But in this case I think they did a pretty good job of matching the movies together well. There is cohesion between them! God job Warner!,5,If you like Drew,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,353,"['think', 'like', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'will', 'love', 'triple', 'play', 'three', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'story', 'lines', 'work', 'well', 'other', 'Sometimes', 'put', 'movies', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'together', 'case', 'think', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'matching', 'movies', 'together', 'well', 'cohesion', 'God', 'job', 'Warner']",Drew Barrymore Triple Feature: (The Wedding Singer / Music and Lyrics / Going the Distance)
