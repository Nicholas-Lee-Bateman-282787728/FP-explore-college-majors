Chastain is a powerhouse, she is a fearless actress...there's nothing she can't do! Jolene is a young woman who's been used and abused her whole life. This movie spans a decade of Jolene's journey to self-discovery and the people she meets along the way. Jolene encounters many men who exploit her and make her feel horrible about herself. It's funny how in life, we make the same mistakes over and over again and never really learn from them. This movie is so real that it is hard to watch sometimes, but Jolene is a movie that I will definitely never forget.

Not only that, I knew that she would win an Oscar someday. Fast forward to 2013 and her on the red carpet, nominated for ""Zero Dark Thirty"". She will win someday because she knows something that most actress never find out. She is fearless. In the span of the length of ""Jolene"", she grabbed every taboo that actresses face by the throat and strangled the bejesus out of it.I don't really know why ""Jolene - The Director's Cut"" was released, but it isn't as good. There are many many cuts, most of them sexual and there are many scenes that are different. Ultimately though, ""Jolene"" is about the power of a woman and the strength of a woman, sexuality and all. So cutting these scenes made the movie less of what it originally was.Bottom line, ""the director's cut"" is too much of a cut and the original is a better film.Jessica Chastain tackles this character of ""Jolene"" and showed what probably was an Oscar-worthy performance before anybody knew who she was. The movie is about innocence and sex. No matter how much we want to deny it, it is what drives us, many times in the wrong direction. For some, it drives us in the wrong direction over and over. It is the nature of the beast and what we see from Jolene is the development of her inner-strength and maturity after a lifetime of taking the harsh road.You want to see an actress bury herself in a role, check out the ORIGINAL CUT of ""Jolene"".

1376933,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003Z8ZC2A,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","JOLENE is an adaptation of one of EL Doctorow's short stories from his collection `Sweet Land Stories'. That story was one of the few forgettable ones in that collection and makes one wonder why it was singled out for a screenplay by Dennis Yares. Doctorow is one of America's most important writers (Welcome to Hard Times, The Book of Daniel, Ragtime, Billy Bathgate, Loon Lake, The Water Works, The March, City of God, etc) and this is surely not one of his finest moments. Made in 2008, it did give Jessica Chastain an opportunity for exposure (as in ""total'!) so perhaps that is why it is making the rounds again - before Oscars....Jolene is a 15 year old girl, at story's beginning, who knows nothing about her parents and who marries a geek boy (Zeb Newman) whose own parents are mysteriously dead and lives with relatives who are odd - the aunt (Theresa Russell) is angry with the world and uncle (Dermot Mulroney) is a pedophile: Jolene ruins her first relationship by having an affair at age 16 with the uncle , her `husband' commits suicide, and she ends up a juvenile delinquent in a `home' for wayward girls. There she is courted by staff member Cindy (Frances Farmer) who helps her new young lover escape. Jolene runs away to hit the road hitchhiking (selling favors along the way), and ends up in a desert drive-in where she meets and marries a tattoo artists Coco (Rupert Friend) who is a drug dealer on the side and Jolene steps out of another bad relationship. Making her way across the country she stops in to work as a stripper and is noticed by a rich man (Chaz Palminteri) from Las Vegas who shows Jolene wealth and love but is murdered by a rival gang from New York. Once again she hits the road to end up in Tulsa, OK where she is courted by a sicko right wing evangelistic wealthy boy (Michael Vartan) who marries her despite his wealthy parents concerns, gets her pregnant, then throws Jolene's past in her face, claiming their newborn child as his own - Jolene being a used and unfit mother. In desperation Jolene moves to Hollywood where she follows her one talent - art - and dreams of becoming a movie star.Dan Ireland directs this bit of treacle and an outstanding cast makes the best of the script they're given.  Chastain shows evidence of the superb acting skills that now yearly are becoming more apparent. But as a movie, JOLENE Is a contrived little mess - and it makes us wonder how the powerful EL Doctorow could be so diluted.

1376940,ATQX94DNPODB2,B003Z8ZC2A,RBock,"[0, 0]","This movie had great potential to be phenomenal; however, it falls very short.Jessica Chastain is amazing and this is my first exposure to her in a substantive role.  Where Jolene went right is, as I mentioned, is the story itself (by E.L. Doctorow) as one that has begged to be told.  When the story begins, Jolene is a child, a product of the foster care system, who is virtually abandoned by her birth parents.  Survival is the main theme of the film, and we follow Jolene in her journey to emotionally and physically survive.In her search for love (familial love and acceptance that humans instinctively need; certainly not romantic love or affection) and for a place to lay her head, we watch Jolene desperately maneuver from place to place, partner to partner.  And we also see predators in action, as it's extremely common for sexual, emotional, and physical abusers to choose their victims based on vulnerability, ability to isolate, and ability to manipulate.We get to observe Jolene make choices based on mere survival throughout the film, watching her grow and evolve, *almost* able to trust her ability to rely on herself and her own instincts--until the predators pull her back in, in a cycle of abuse and reliance.  Jolene is used and abused, but with each instance, she evolves and survives--as we all do.  And incredibly enough, through the most horrifying circumstances, Chastain never tells Jolene's story as a victim.While the story itself is extremely brilliant and a raw insight in how domestic violence often starts, the transition from paper to screen seems to be a rocky transition:There are far too many cliches in this movie.  I don't know where it's written that any movie based in the South or that has Southerns in it must be a caricature with over-the-top melodrama. Chastain holds her own, but most of the rest of the cast does not, unfortunately.  The character Coco Leget (Rupert Friend), for instance, is an English actor who must have learned to mock a New Orleanean accent from Hee Haw.The acting is &#34;sub-par&#34;-ingly distracting.  Again, Chastain shines, but the acting takes away from the heart of the story.Overall, it's definitely worth a watch, if not for the commanding presence of Jessica Chastain and the survivor's story.",3,"Jessica Chastain is Amazing, But Impossibly Cannot Carry This Film",1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,2272,"['movie', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'be', 'phenomenal', 'however', 'very', 'short.Jessica', 'Chastain', 'amazing', 'first', 'exposure', 'substantive', 'role', 'Where', 'Jolene', 'went', 'right', 'mentioned', 'story', 'E.L.', 'Doctorow', 'one', 'begged', 'be', 'told', 'When', 'story', 'Jolene', 'child', 'product', 'foster', 'care', 'system', 'who', 'virtually', 'abandoned', 'birth', 'parents', 'Survival', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'follow', 'Jolene', 'journey', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'survive.In', 'search', 'love', 'familial', 'love', 'acceptance', 'instinctively', 'need', 'certainly', 'not', 'romantic', 'love', 'affection', 'place', 'lay', 'head', 'watch', 'Jolene', 'desperately', 'maneuver', 'place', 'place', 'partner', 'partner', 'also', 'see', 'predators', 'action', 'extremely', 'common', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'physical', 'abusers', 'choose', 'victims', 'based', 'vulnerability', 'ability', 'isolate', 'ability', 'manipulate.We', 'get', 'observe', 'Jolene', 'make', 'choices', 'based', 'mere', 'survival', 'film', 'watching', 'grow', 'evolve', '*almost*', 'able', 'trust', 'ability', 'rely', 'own', 'instincts', 'predators', 'pull', 'back', 'cycle', 'abuse', 'reliance', 'Jolene', 'used', 'abused', 'instance', 'do', 'incredibly', 'enough', 'most', 'horrifying', 'circumstances', 'Chastain', 'never', 'Jolene', 'story', 'victim.While', 'story', 'extremely', 'brilliant', 'raw', 'insight', 'how', 'domestic', 'violence', 'often', 'transition', 'paper', 'screen', 'be', 'rocky', 'transition', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'cliches', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'written', 'movie', 'based', 'South', 'Southerns', 'must', 'be', 'caricature', 'over-the-top', 'melodrama', 'Chastain', 'own', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'not', 'unfortunately', 'character', 'Coco', 'Leget', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'instance', 'English', 'actor', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'learned', 'mock', 'New', 'Orleanean', 'accent', 'Hee', 'Haw.The', 'acting', '34', 'sub-par', '34', '-ingly', 'distracting', 'Again', 'Chastain', 'shines', 'acting', 'away', 'heart', 'story.Overall', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'not', 'commanding', 'presence', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'survivor', 'story']",Jolene

On a side note though, is it me or does she look alot like Bryce Dallas Howard...it also took me back when i found out her real last name is...Howard.  Perhaps Ron isnt telling us everything.  One big difference though...Jessica has talent",5,sheldamos,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,592,"['was', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'ive', 'been', 'love', 'ever', 'since..figurtively', 'Apparently', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'so', 'star', 'exploded', 'awsome', 'actress', 'pleasing', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'Shes', 'one', 'script', 'away', 'gold', 'Jolene', 'good', 'movie', 'bit', 'tear', 'jerker', 'places', 'very', 'good', 'storey', 'line', 'side', 'note', 'look', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'also', 'took', 'back', 'when', 'i', 'found', 'real', 'last', 'name', 'Howard', 'Perhaps', 'Ron', 'isnt', 'telling', 'everything', 'One', 'big', 'difference', 'Jessica', 'talent']",Jolene

After a failed marriage at a young age, Jolene (Chastain) deals with getting over the past and finding herself.  She sets off on a journey across the country looking for what is missing in her life.  This is a very, very good coming-of-age story, also kind of inspiring in a way, no matter what happens to her she never gets down and keeps pushing forward.  On the other hand it is also pretty depressing to watch what this girl goes through.  This movie does a great job of showing what a girl, who was raised as an orphan and spent her youth between the home and foster parents, acts like.  Though it's not her first movie the woman who plays Jolene (Jessica Chastain) is fantastic in this.  It's not an easy role, especially with as much sex and nudity involved (nothing gratuitous, it actually helps define the character), along with the ranges of emotion she must portray.  I'm really surprised she didn't get any recognition for this. I don't want to give too much away, but I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I give it an A.Would I watch it again? - I did already.",5,"Fantastic, fantastic movie that is difficult to explain. More movies like this should be made. Great acting and story.
