1540543,AGKYMQWJE2914,B0080GT9W6,B. Murphy,"[4, 4]","As most hardcore fans of Dean Koontz know, &#34;Intensity&#34; was released as a miniseries for television, and is considered one of Dean Koontz's better movies (with the possible exception of &#34;Odd Thomas&#34; being made now).John C. McGinley's acting is superb as Edgler Vess, and Molly Parker shines as Chyna Shepherd. There are a few characters added into the story for drama's sake and to add richness to the plot lines, since most of the book takes place internally in Chyna's own mind, and in Vess'.This is a really good quality of the miniseries, and I am pleased that it has finally been released on DVD for those of us who have been waiting for many years.*My disc did not have a subtitle option, just FYI. It's just the movie, and that's literally it. No extras, dialogue, etc.Highly recommended if you are a Koontz fan, or if you saw this on television and enjoyed it and want to see it again. Very entertaining.",5,Favorite Koontz movie AND book!,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,927,"['most', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'know', '34', 'Intensity', '34', 'was', 'released', 'miniseries', 'television', 'considered', 'one', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'better', 'movies', 'possible', 'exception', '34', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '34', 'being', 'made', 'now', '.John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'acting', 'superb', 'Edgler', 'Vess', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Chyna', 'Shepherd', 'are', 'few', 'characters', 'added', 'story', 'drama', 'sake', 'add', 'richness', 'plot', 'lines', 'most', 'book', 'place', 'internally', 'Chyna', 'own', 'mind', ""Vess'.This"", 'really', 'good', 'quality', 'miniseries', 'am', 'pleased', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'many', 'years', '*My', 'disc', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'subtitle', 'option', 'just', 'FYI', 'just', 'movie', 'literally', 'extras', 'dialogue', 'etc.Highly', 'recommended', 'are', 'Koontz', 'fan', 'saw', 'television', 'enjoyed', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'Very', 'entertaining']",N/A

I kept thinking, ""That's exactly how I pictured it!!""I was so amazed and it was so incredibly intense. It is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it was extremely well done.The actors were perfect and they shared many likenesses to the characters. I was so happy that they played the characters as well as they did.It's the best book based movie I have ever seen.

1540549,A22PMIUQWH2YPA,B0080GT9W6,Southpaw,"[0, 0]","*This may contain spoilers*In 2004, I received a phone call from my friend who told me that Intensity by Dean Koontz was on TV. The reason she called me is because that same year I've been urging her to read Intensity. She's not much of a reader, and opted to see the movie instead. She said the movie was great. But in my opinion,  movies are notorious for not doing the book any justice so I reserved my judgement. Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it at the time. In the ensuing months and years, I've searched for this movie without any success. Since I loved the book, I wanted to see the movie. Last week, I stumbled on it here on Amazon and quickly ordered it. So this is my opinion:The movie is good. So if you loved/liked the book, then you'll like/love the movie. Unlike other book-to-movie adaptations, this one adhered to the storyline without colossal deviations. Some of the deviations are as follows: Jack Templeton is single and had dinner with the family, whereas in the book he is married and couldn't make it to dinner. Ariel's hair is brown instead of platinum blonde. Vess listens to music on his way back home, whereas in the book he doesn't turn on the radio. There were wolves instead of elk. Some of the somewhat major deviations were the involvement of the sheriff and a woman on that lonely stretch highway. Vess visited the Templeton's because of Jack and not Laura, whereas in the book Vess was motivated by Laura whose picture he saw by accident. It would've been nice if there weren't any deviations, since I'm a stickler for details, but overall I thought this movie was pretty good.The acting by John McGinley was great. I never pegged him for a guy who could do serious roles, especially after I've seen his performance on Scrubs, but he really nailed it. Molly Parker played her role pretty well. The actress who played Ariel was exactly how I pictured her, minus the brown hair.The ending is slightly different than the book, but I didn't mind it so much. The ending was still good. It even made me shed a tear.In my opinion, no movie can do any book justice, but this adaptation cuts it pretty close. If you liked/loved the book, you'll like/love the movie.",4,Good book-to-movie adaptation,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,2192,"['*This', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers*In', '2004', 'received', 'phone', 'call', 'friend', 'who', 'told', 'Intensity', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'was', 'TV', 'reason', 'called', 'same', 'year', ""'ve"", 'been', 'urging', 'read', 'Intensity', 'not', 'much', 'reader', 'opted', 'see', 'movie', 'instead', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'opinion', 'movies', 'are', 'notorious', 'not', 'doing', 'book', 'justice', 'so', 'reserved', 'judgement', 'Unfortunately', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'time', 'ensuing', 'months', 'years', ""'ve"", 'searched', 'movie', 'success', 'loved', 'book', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'Last', 'week', 'stumbled', 'here', 'Amazon', 'quickly', 'ordered', 'opinion', 'movie', 'good', 'So', 'loved/liked', 'book', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like/love', 'movie', 'other', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptations', 'one', 'adhered', 'storyline', 'colossal', 'deviations', 'deviations', 'are', 'Jack', 'Templeton', 'single', 'had', 'dinner', 'family', 'whereas', 'book', 'married', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'dinner', 'Ariel', 'hair', 'brown', 'instead', 'platinum', 'blonde', 'Vess', 'music', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'whereas', 'book', ""n't"", 'turn', 'radio', 'were', 'wolves', 'instead', 'elk', 'somewhat', 'major', 'deviations', 'were', 'involvement', 'sheriff', 'woman', 'lonely', 'stretch', 'highway', 'Vess', 'visited', 'Templeton', 'Jack', 'not', 'Laura', 'whereas', 'book', 'Vess', 'was', 'motivated', 'Laura', 'picture', 'saw', 'accident', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'were', ""n't"", 'deviations', ""'m"", 'stickler', 'details', 'overall', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'acting', 'John', 'McGinley', 'was', 'great', 'never', 'pegged', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'serious', 'roles', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'performance', 'Scrubs', 'really', 'nailed', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'played', 'role', 'pretty', 'well', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Ariel', 'was', 'exactly', 'how', 'pictured', 'brown', 'hair.The', 'ending', 'slightly', 'different', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'ending', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'even', 'made', 'shed', 'tear.In', 'opinion', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'adaptation', 'pretty', 'close', 'liked/loved', 'book', ""'ll"", 'like/love', 'movie']",N/A
