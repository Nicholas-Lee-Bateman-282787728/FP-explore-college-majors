482237,AAPWD1KRDMQHA,6305892865,"""ann_septimus16""","[3, 25]","OK guys, I don't mean to burst all your cutesy bubbles, but this insulting movie does more harm to horse-crazy kids than it does good.Remember how after &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; all those dogs got snapped up by parents trying to appease their kids' obsession for spotty puppies?  Well, most of those got donated back to humane societies.  After watching Disney's lastest travesty, I am sure that thousands of those equine-insane girls and boys (yes, I was and still am one, too) will be begging for pretty horseys.  &quot;Look Mom, HE can keep him, and he even lives in the city and is Really poor!&quot;Well, that is not how horses work.  2-year-old horses are little more than kindergarteners... they cannot be ridden, they cannot event (jump) because they usually aren't even trained yet, and they cannot be ridden every day without serious consequences.  Yes, the accuracy was not the point of the flick, but it still Seriously detracts from any worth to be found in the rest of the shmaltzy movie.The story isn't that great, either.  Believe me, you've seen this before... TOO many times.  All the characters are stereotypes and you can do better than to feed your impressionable kids those images of the cruel rich man who just uses his wealth for his own ends and feels the need to brutalize everyone else because he has the $$$.  Those sentiments smell faintly of Socialism, and the last thing the US needs is that.  The only saving grace is the acting of Lucas Black who plays Conor.  He actually can act, and he is a very good rider.Rent the &quot;Black Stallion&quot;.",1,Puh-lease!,1005177600,"11 8, 2001",2001,1581,"['OK', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'burst', 'cutesy', 'bubbles', 'insulting', 'movie', 'more', 'harm', 'horse-crazy', 'kids', 'good.Remember', 'how', 'quot', '101', 'Dalmatians', 'quot', 'dogs', 'got', 'snapped', 'up', 'parents', 'trying', 'appease', 'kids', 'obsession', 'spotty', 'puppies', 'Well', 'most', 'got', 'donated', 'back', 'humane', 'societies', 'watching', 'Disney', 'lastest', 'travesty', 'am', 'sure', 'thousands', 'equine-insane', 'girls', 'boys', 'yes', 'was', 'still', 'am', 'one', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'begging', 'pretty', 'horseys', 'quot', 'Look', 'Mom', 'HE', 'can', 'keep', 'even', 'city', 'Really', 'poor', 'quot', 'Well', 'not', 'how', 'horses', 'work', '2-year-old', 'horses', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'kindergarteners', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ridden', 'can', 'not', 'event', 'jump', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'trained', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ridden', 'day', 'serious', 'consequences', 'Yes', 'accuracy', 'was', 'not', 'point', 'flick', 'still', 'Seriously', 'detracts', 'worth', 'be', 'found', 'rest', 'shmaltzy', 'movie.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'either', 'Believe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TOO', 'many', 'times', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'feed', 'impressionable', 'kids', 'images', 'cruel', 'rich', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'wealth', 'own', 'ends', 'need', 'brutalize', 'everyone', 'else', 'sentiments', 'smell', 'faintly', 'Socialism', 'last', 'thing', 'US', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'acting', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'who', 'Conor', 'actually', 'can', 'act', 'very', 'good', 'rider.Rent', 'quot', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'quot']",Flash VHS

So often, people use that phrase to mean &quot;no swearing&quot; or &quot;no nudity&quot;, but so many &quot;family&quot; movies are just watered down nothingness, no story, no interesting characters...This movie has spirit and heart.  Lucas Black is an amazing young man, a wonderful young actor who carries the entire movie all by himself.  After his grandmother's death, Conner (Black) decides to embark on a journey from Georgia to New York to meet his father's ship as it returns to port.  He confronts danger and many of life's challenges along the way.What I especially like about the movie is that it doesn't tiptoe around some hard issues.  Conner deals with his grandmother's death all alone...he confronts an abusive adult with heart and bravery.  I think this movie is wonderful because it shows a nice, good, brave kid who isn't unreal the way so many kids are in movies and on TV today.  He's polite and smart and respectful and still super cool.

482245,A1LDIMQISH07WK,6305892865,Rebecca,"[2, 3]","FLASH is a very good Original &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; film. It captures the heart and spirit of a young teenage boy and his beloved horse, obviously by the name of Flash. Actually, in the beginning of the film, Flash doesn't belong to Connor (Lucas Black), he's owned by some neighbors of his near his father's farm. When the neighbors have to sell Flash, Connor instantly jumps up and wants his father to buy the horse. At first, his father doesn't want to spend a lot of money on buying a horse. But of course, he does end up buying the horse for Connor. Anyway, when Connor's father goes away on a trip somewhere (I forget where he goes on the trip and why because I haven't seen the movie in a while), and leaves Connor alone with his grandmother and Flash. Suddenly, Connor's grandmother dies - and leaves Connor all alone with his horse! His father hasn't even come back yet! Connor then takes Flash to this wealthy farm to sell him for money and ends up working for the wealthy family at their stable to help pay for his family's house and everything. Then, the family wants to sell Flash and Connor doesn't want them to sell Flash because he's afraid he'll never see Flash again. So he ends up stealing Flash and running off together on a long journey to find his father while riding horse-back on Flash all the way! The cast is excellent and especially Lucas Black - he is a very talented young actor and should be recognized more (check him out in a recent flick called ALL THE PRETTY HORSES, also starring the ultra talents of Matt Damon and Henry Thomas...you know, the little boy from Steven Speilberg's ET?).
