I am comparing this dvd to my old vhs copy from the SciFi Channel""Series Collection"" Rebroadcast.Two of my favorite scenes is between the bullied-into-giving-info scientist and the ""Shop"" Jude Andrews,The first, where I first noticed a cut, doesn't come in with the scientisthearing a noise in the kitchen and finding Jude Andrews cooking breakfast;I guess they did ""...cut through the priliminary bull, Doc.""Instead it comes in with the breakfast already cooked and a ""hypnotic swirl device""set into the kitchen table?? And Jude saying ""you are going to hurt my feelings, Doc,if you don't eat more than that."" (not even in the Sci-Fi version, and I have found other scenesnot in the Sci-Fi version.)The other favorite scene between these two is at the research facility, walkingand ""Doc"" describing the details of Harland's metamorphosis.""He's getting younger...I can't explain how I know, it's just one of those thingsyou know, like a teenager trying to pass as an adult.""""He's a janitor but he's not stupid. He's handling it pretty well, I'll give him that, But he's scared,scared almost out of his mind.""  Meaning, even something exceptionally goodcan be scary, if it is totally unfamiliar.There is the closing quote from the David Bowie song ""... I believe, O Lord, I believe all the way.""but I didn't see other episode quotes and there is only the opening of David Bowie singing the theme song.There's no ""When The Saints Come Marching In"" sung by Harlan getting ready to go back to work.There is the ""...Children Of The Lord"" sung by the fugitive trio.I didn't see as many comical scenes with Billy the janitor assistant/taxidermistand his friend ""Hall"" but there are his scenes as Toddhunter's impromptu/comical assistant.There is the favorite scene with Stephen King as the bus driver .There is the scene when the security guard ignores seeing someone in the trunk ""comes a time in every life.""This movie is really cool.Todhunter is more than just the stereotypical ""Mad Scientist"";even though he comes off as eccentric, (He visits his father's grave at night andfalls asleep on it.) he's dedicated to his science and kisses no ones feet,not even Jude Andrew's. ""Do it now!!!"" ""Fraidy Cats!""Jude Andrews is as interesting, infamously and as dedicated as Todhunter.but I didn't see his ""Nobody's doing any thinking."" scene.or his visit to Billy's trailer home, with the all-year-round Christmas lightsand his ""...there oughta be a law against that."" butthere is the ""The eyes of Texas ARE upon you."" Mumbling in the car andafter he garrotes someone.  (Too many pictures or jealous over Terri? and thereare still scenes where we see quite much of her.)and the stalemates between him and General Cruz.The ending of the Sci-Fi Series Collection looks the same; abrupt and leaves you guessingbut I don't think this could have been a regular series; Andrews would have killeda small town full of people.",5,"Cut, But Still Works For Me",1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,3067,"['Well', 'how', 'could', 'expect', 'mini', 'series', 'fit', 'one', 'disc', 'However', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movie', 'almost', 'scenesI', 'really', 'are', 'am', 'comparing', 'dvd', 'old', 'vhs', 'copy', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'Series', 'Collection', 'Rebroadcast.Two', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'bullied-into-giving-info', 'scientist', 'Shop', 'Jude', 'Andrews', 'first', 'where', 'first', 'noticed', 'cut', ""n't"", 'come', 'scientisthearing', 'noise', 'kitchen', 'finding', 'Jude', 'Andrews', 'cooking', 'breakfast', 'guess', 'did', 'cut', 'priliminary', 'bull', 'Doc', 'Instead', 'breakfast', 'already', 'cooked', 'hypnotic', 'swirl', 'device', 'set', 'kitchen', 'table', 'Jude', 'saying', 'are', 'going', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'Doc', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'more', 'not', 'even', 'Sci-Fi', 'version', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'scenesnot', 'Sci-Fi', 'version', 'other', 'favorite', 'scene', 'two', 'research', 'facility', 'walkingand', 'Doc', 'describing', 'details', 'Harland', 'metamorphosis', 'getting', 'younger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'know', 'just', 'one', 'thingsyou', 'know', 'teenager', 'trying', 'pass', 'adult', 'janitor', 'not', 'stupid', 'handling', 'pretty', 'well', ""'ll"", 'give', 'scared', 'scared', 'almost', 'mind', 'Meaning', 'even', 'something', 'exceptionally', 'goodcan', 'be', 'scary', 'totally', 'unfamiliar.There', 'closing', 'quote', 'David', 'Bowie', 'song', 'believe', 'O', 'Lord', 'believe', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'episode', 'quotes', 'only', 'opening', 'David', 'Bowie', 'singing', 'theme', 'When', 'Saints', 'Come', 'Marching', 'sung', 'Harlan', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'back', 'Children', 'Lord', 'sung', 'fugitive', 'trio.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'comical', 'scenes', 'Billy', 'janitor', 'assistant/taxidermistand', 'friend', 'Hall', 'are', 'scenes', 'Toddhunter', 'impromptu/comical', 'assistant.There', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Stephen', 'King', 'bus', 'driver', 'scene', 'when', 'security', 'guard', 'seeing', 'someone', 'trunk', 'time', 'life', 'movie', 'really', 'cool.Todhunter', 'more', 'just', 'stereotypical', 'Mad', 'Scientist', 'even', 'off', 'eccentric', 'father', 'grave', 'night', 'andfalls', 'asleep', 'dedicated', 'science', 'ones', 'feet', 'not', 'even', 'Jude', 'Andrew', 'Do', 'now', 'Fraidy', 'Cats', 'Jude', 'Andrews', 'interesting', 'infamously', 'as', 'dedicated', 'Todhunter.but', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Nobody', 'doing', 'thinking', 'scene.or', 'visit', 'Billy', 'trailer', 'home', 'all-year-round', 'Christmas', 'lightsand', 'oughta', 'be', 'law', 'eyes', 'Texas', 'ARE', 'Mumbling', 'car', 'andafter', 'someone', 'Too', 'many', 'pictures', 'jealous', 'Terri', 'thereare', 'still', 'where', 'see', 'quite', 'much', 'stalemates', 'General', 'Cruz.The', 'ending', 'Sci-Fi', 'Series', 'Collection', 'same', 'abrupt', 'guessingbut', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'regular', 'series', 'Andrews', 'would', 'have', 'killeda', 'small', 'town', 'full', 'people']",Stephen King's Golden Years VHS

I loved the sci-fi concept, the fugitive-style stay one step ahead story, and of course the titular David Bowie song.The reason why I've given this dvd 2 stars is that the full story was never allowed to unfold. This is NOT a miniseries. This was a full-fledged television series, meant to play out over a number of seasons. The main character, Harlan, who ages backwards, was played by an actor in his mid-thirties. Had the show been kept on the air for two or three seasons, we would have seen him regress back to that age.The slapped-together series finale was poorly handled, though really there was no good solution. The show was dependent on having multiple seasons, and no ending could have worked. Better to simply pass it by and remember the show for what it was: an intriguing television experiment that was not allowed to work.I do think sometimes: In the modern age of cable channels putting out quality shows, wouldn't it be wonderful if a channel like Sci-Fi were to commit to three years of a Golden Years remake, and do it right this time?",2,Not a miniseries: Prematurely cancelled,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,1112,"['When', 'show', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'loved', 'sci-fi', 'concept', 'fugitive-style', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'story', 'course', 'titular', 'David', 'Bowie', 'song.The', 'reason', 'why', ""'ve"", 'given', 'dvd', '2', 'stars', 'full', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'allowed', 'unfold', 'NOT', 'miniseries', 'was', 'full-fledged', 'television', 'series', 'meant', 'play', 'out', 'number', 'seasons', 'main', 'character', 'Harlan', 'who', 'backwards', 'was', 'played', 'actor', 'mid-thirties', 'Had', 'show', 'been', 'kept', 'air', 'two', 'three', 'seasons', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'regress', 'back', 'age.The', 'slapped-together', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'poorly', 'handled', 'really', 'was', 'good', 'solution', 'show', 'was', 'dependent', 'having', 'multiple', 'seasons', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'Better', 'simply', 'pass', 'remember', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'intriguing', 'television', 'experiment', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'work.I', 'do', 'think', 'sometimes', 'modern', 'age', 'cable', 'channels', 'putting', 'out', 'quality', 'shows', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'wonderful', 'channel', 'Sci-Fi', 'were', 'commit', 'three', 'years', 'Golden', 'Years', 'remake', 'do', 'right', 'time']",Stephen King's Golden Years VHS

Upon viewing this new DVD transfer however, I'm confused as to how I could've liked it so much.The story of what would happen if an elderly man was accidentally exposed to some chemicals that made him become younger is very intriguing and full of possibilites.  King jumps on those posibilities and can get your mind going, but the execution of them is flawed.  I like the languid and reflective pace of the series, but there are too many scenes that don't add to the plot, don't make much sense, or worse, repeat points that have already been covered.I remembered the strongest element of &quot;Golden Years&quot; being the relationship between the elderly couple Halrn and Gina and I find I'm still touched by it today.  The actors do such terrific work that I never once questioned the reality of their love and concern for one another.  It's refreshing to see an elderly couple that's so 'normal', 'real' and alive.  Most of the other preformances though are a bit too over the top to be believable.  The mad scienist especially, seems to be making an entirely different film than the rest of the crew!The central relationship and interesting premise are almost enough to make up these flaws, but then we get a rushed, tacked on ending that defies all reason.  It's a great dissapointment after investing so much time and caring so much for Harlan and Gina.  Don't see &quot;Golden Years&quot; expecting too much and you'll find many things to like about it, but it will never be anyones favorite Stephen King project.",3,Not as good as I remembered,1006041600,"11 18, 2001",2001,1606,"['When', 'first', 'aired', 'remember', 'getting', 'lost', 'world', 'created', 'viewing', 'new', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'however', ""'m"", 'confused', 'how', 'could', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'so', 'much.The', 'story', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'elderly', 'man', 'was', 'accidentally', 'exposed', 'chemicals', 'made', 'become', 'younger', 'very', 'intriguing', 'full', 'possibilites', 'King', 'jumps', 'posibilities', 'can', 'get', 'mind', 'going', 'execution', 'flawed', 'languid', 'reflective', 'pace', 'series', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'worse', 'repeat', 'points', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'covered.I', 'remembered', 'strongest', 'element', 'quot', 'Golden', 'Years', 'quot', 'being', 'relationship', 'elderly', 'couple', 'Halrn', 'Gina', 'find', ""'m"", 'still', 'touched', 'today', 'actors', 'do', 'such', 'terrific', 'work', 'never', 'once', 'questioned', 'reality', 'love', 'concern', 'one', 'refreshing', 'see', 'elderly', 'couple', 'so', ""'normal"", 'alive', 'Most', 'other', 'preformances', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'top', 'be', 'believable', 'mad', 'scienist', 'especially', 'be', 'making', 'entirely', 'different', 'film', 'rest', 'crew', 'central', 'relationship', 'interesting', 'premise', 'are', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'then', 'get', 'rushed', 'tacked', 'ending', 'reason', 'great', 'dissapointment', 'investing', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'caring', 'so', 'much', 'Harlan', 'Gina', 'Do', ""n't"", 'see', 'quot', 'Golden', 'Years', 'quot', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'find', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'anyones', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'King', 'project']",Stephen King's Golden Years VHS

The last two hours are disjointed and for some reason goes away from the Protagonist.

It is more that horror or Sci Fi, it is a gentle tale and romantic, in its own fashion.Keith Szarabajka (Mickey Kostmayer of the Equilizer; Angel; Nighlight) is a superb, underrated talent.  In his middle 30's in real life at the time, he portrays an old man nearing retirement working at a top secret lab as a janitor.  There is (UNFORTUNATELY) the mad scientist that King should have been ashamed for creating in the stereotypical fashion straight from 1930's horror films, but there is also so really neat characters that round at the tale and make up for the deficiencies.  Ed Lauter is great, in a range of role he does not usually play.In a lab accident, Szarajabka is accidently exposed to a substance that reverses his age.  And that is what makes the tale work so well.  The fine, subtle talents of Szarabajka and the amazing Francis Sternhagen as his wife, who is watching her beloved husband grow younger day and day, make up for the uneven writing by King and sloppy editing.Maybe everyone should forget this is Stephan King, and just judge the film on its own merits and I think you will be surprised.I nice way to pass a rainy day.",4,One of King's overlooked better works,1017964800,"04 5, 2002",2002,1461,"['Okay', 'needed', 'editor', 'get', 'hold', 'King', 'do', ""n't"", 'edit', 'books', 'enough', 'tale', 'where', 'had', 'hand', 'production', 'even', 'directed', 'part', 'was', 'sure', 'be', 'same.Despite', 'marvelous', 'tale', 'not', 'so', 'horrific', 'most', 'King', 'stories', 'so', 'most', 'King', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'dull', 'more', 'horror', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'gentle', 'tale', 'romantic', 'own', 'fashion.Keith', 'Szarabajka', 'Mickey', 'Kostmayer', 'Equilizer', 'Angel', 'Nighlight', 'superb', 'underrated', 'talent', 'middle', '30', 'real', 'life', 'time', 'old', 'man', 'nearing', 'retirement', 'working', 'top', 'secret', 'lab', 'janitor', 'UNFORTUNATELY', 'mad', 'scientist', 'King', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ashamed', 'creating', 'stereotypical', 'fashion', 'straight', '1930', 'horror', 'films', 'also', 'so', 'really', 'neat', 'characters', 'round', 'tale', 'make', 'up', 'deficiencies', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'great', 'range', 'role', 'not', 'usually', 'play.In', 'lab', 'accident', 'Szarajabka', 'accidently', 'exposed', 'substance', 'age', 'tale', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'fine', 'subtle', 'talents', 'Szarabajka', 'amazing', 'Francis', 'Sternhagen', 'wife', 'who', 'watching', 'beloved', 'husband', 'grow', 'younger', 'day', 'day', 'make', 'up', 'uneven', 'writing', 'King', 'sloppy', 'editing.Maybe', 'everyone', 'should', 'forget', 'Stephan', 'King', 'just', 'judge', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'surprised.I', 'nice', 'way', 'pass', 'rainy', 'day']",Stephen King's Golden Years VHS

But when I got into it, it intrigued me enough to sit through the whole thing (in two sessions - it's a VHS two-reeler on the long side).See the other reviews for plot details.

The slow unfolding of that proposition occurs like artichoke leaves being peeled back, well done.  The byplay between the elderly couple (Keith Szarabaika and Frances Sternhagen) is very well acted, sweet and almost believable.  The heroine Terry (Felicity Huffman) is nice eye candy.  The villain Jude (R.D. Call) is duly evil but somewhat over the top.

This movie is just so bad, it leaves me sad and disillusioned. I could not believe that King could write such a poorly developed story but I understood more when I read the Wikipedia article on the production.  The movie began as a mini-series that was to lead into a regular series of weekly adventures. CBS nixed the regular series which left the mini-series with a cliff-hanger ending.  I was too quick to blame King for what might have been a decent presentation gone bad; it was actually CBS that ruined the movie.  A ridiculous ending was tacked on to the mini-series and the package wrapped up to place on a DVD. But, to be frank, there are few redeeming features in the movie. The CIA agent is stereotypically ruthless and the &#34;mad&#34; scientist goes beyond stereotype to ridiculousness. The acting is mediocre at best.  It is not King's best writing but all the blame can't land on his neck. CBS would seem to be culpable in this travesty.  My recommendation, leave it alone.

The movie has a timeless SF theme, okay acting, and special effects that were B grade (green glowing stuff and a clock that runs backwards).The theme is simple. A 70 year old janitor is accidentally exposed to ""stuff"" (biological agents?) during a government experiment that resulted in an explosion. He starts to slowly grow young. There are people who ""want"" him and to kill anyone who has come in contact with him, and those who want to save him. Felicity Huffman plays the sexy sultry security officer who reminds us of the X-Files Scully. Good guys on the run from the government SF movie.The movie is very long but the plot somehow keeps us from getting too bored. Minor twists, minor humor.No bad language, no sex, no nudity (bra and panties- thanks Felicity).",4,20 YEARS LATER...,1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,838,"['have', 'watched', '20', 'year', 'old', 'movie/', 'mini', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'timeless', 'SF', 'theme', 'okay', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'B', 'grade', 'green', 'glowing', 'stuff', 'clock', 'backwards', '.The', 'theme', 'simple', '70', 'year', 'old', 'janitor', 'accidentally', 'exposed', 'stuff', 'biological', 'agents', 'government', 'experiment', 'resulted', 'explosion', 'slowly', 'grow', 'young', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'who', 'want', 'save', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'sexy', 'sultry', 'security', 'officer', 'who', 'X-Files', 'Scully', 'Good', 'guys', 'run', 'government', 'SF', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'very', 'long', 'plot', 'somehow', 'getting', 'too', 'bored', 'Minor', 'twists', 'minor', 'humor.No', 'bad', 'language', 'sex', 'nudity', 'bra', 'panties-', 'thanks', 'Felicity']",Stephen King's Golden Years VHS
