830250,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B0002CHJHS,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[0, 0]","Revolution is a stark departure from Margaret Cho's previous two stand-up shows, I'm The One That I Want and Notorious C.H.O., both of which are brilliant. Revolution is different. Kind of off-puttingly different at first, but the effect wears off to reveal a side-splitting, raucous romp.Margaret is practically unrecognizable here. The Korean-American stand-up comedienne is no longer chubby, and it's kind of off-putting that she never mentions this. Still, this shows that she goes her own ways. Once you get over the surprise, you can really take in her performance.My goodness, Margaret has really grown as a comic. In Revolution, she doesn't stop with just delivering the jokes - she performs them to make sure we get the message. Her delivery is spot-on. The way she uses her expressions, her gestures and body language makes you laugh at even the weakest jokes, as well as leave you breathless at the best ones. She sells every moment for all its worth. She already is a master of comic timing, so her acting performance clinches the deal. This is a brilliant performance. Just the use of her voice is hilarity upon itself.Yes, her voice. It takes a lot of getting used to how she talks in this show. She has this very Valley Girl way of speaking which may put a lot of people off. I, personally, see it as just a way to make herself even funnier. Margaret seems to be making fun of herself, even, which takes guts.Then we have the material itself. Revolution is totally off the wall. Among other things, Margaret talks about ex-president Bush, the Dixie Chicks, dead relationships, Kim Jong Il, children, racism and Asian stereotypes in movies (that is one hilarious routine). There is a lot of integrity in her routine as usual, and she often makes you laugh and cry in remarkable succession, especially when dealing with her family.That is basically the core of Revolution; Margaret making fun of herself. Not in a mocking way, but by exposing the hilarity of her world. She also bravely dares to lead the audience on with touching stories of her life before hitting us in the face with a laugh that springs from that very sincerity.Some reviews here dismiss Margaret for the so-called poop joke, which is in fact an account of an extremely humiliating event in her life that has a direct tie-in with what she's talking about (namely, warped body image and eating disorders, both of which she suffered from). It takes balls to not only come out with that but present it in such a form that we all laugh our heads off with her.Apart from the off-putting Valley Girl voice, the only thing about Revolution I can minus is Bruce Daniels. Far be it of me to suggest who Margaret works with, but his opening act really wasn't that interesting, plus his gay jokes were way too stereotypical. Not that Margaret's aren't, but hers are far more original and out there. The hall is also rather small and the camerawork isn't that stellar, but the excellent audience make up for that.Even with all the raunchy, out-there material that Margaret is so famous for, the reason it all works is because at the heart of it, there is a lot of love. Margaret manages to tie the show into a very inspiring and hopeful conclusion, making this show not only hilarious but also uplifting spiritually. Maybe not quite the level of epiphany Margaret weaved in ITOTIW, but what is?This is one raucous romp from one of the best stand-up comedians around. Like her or not, she gets a reaction. Usually that of howling laughter, and nowhere does she pull that off easier than here.",4,A Different Margaret is Still a Great Margaret,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,3562,"['Revolution', 'stark', 'departure', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'previous', 'two', 'stand-up', 'shows', ""'m"", 'One', 'Want', 'Notorious', 'C.H.O.', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Revolution', 'different', 'Kind', 'off-puttingly', 'different', 'first', 'effect', 'reveal', 'side-splitting', 'raucous', 'romp.Margaret', 'practically', 'unrecognizable', 'here', 'Korean-American', 'stand-up', 'comedienne', 'no', 'longer', 'chubby', 'kind', 'off-putting', 'never', 'mentions', 'Still', 'own', 'ways', 'Once', 'get', 'surprise', 'can', 'really', 'take', 'performance.My', 'goodness', 'Margaret', 'really', 'grown', 'comic', 'Revolution', ""n't"", 'stop', 'just', 'delivering', 'jokes', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'message', 'delivery', 'spot-on', 'way', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'body', 'language', 'laugh', 'even', 'weakest', 'jokes', 'as', 'well', 'leave', 'breathless', 'best', 'ones', 'moment', 'worth', 'already', 'master', 'comic', 'timing', 'acting', 'performance', 'deal', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Just', 'use', 'voice', 'hilarity', 'itself.Yes', 'voice', 'lot', 'getting', 'used', 'how', 'show', 'very', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'way', 'speaking', 'may', 'put', 'lot', 'people', 'personally', 'see', 'as', 'just', 'way', 'make', 'even', 'funnier', 'Margaret', 'be', 'making', 'fun', 'herself', 'even', 'guts.Then', 'have', 'material', 'Revolution', 'totally', 'wall', 'other', 'things', 'Margaret', 'ex-president', 'Bush', 'Dixie', 'Chicks', 'dead', 'relationships', 'Kim', 'Jong', 'Il', 'children', 'racism', 'Asian', 'stereotypes', 'movies', 'one', 'hilarious', 'routine', 'lot', 'integrity', 'routine', 'usual', 'often', 'laugh', 'cry', 'remarkable', 'succession', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'family.That', 'basically', 'core', 'Revolution', 'Margaret', 'making', 'fun', 'herself', 'Not', 'mocking', 'way', 'exposing', 'hilarity', 'world', 'also', 'bravely', 'lead', 'audience', 'touching', 'stories', 'life', 'hitting', 'face', 'laugh', 'very', 'sincerity.Some', 'reviews', 'here', 'dismiss', 'Margaret', 'so-called', 'poop', 'joke', 'fact', 'account', 'extremely', 'humiliating', 'event', 'life', 'direct', 'tie-in', 'what', 'talking', 'namely', 'warped', 'body', 'image', 'eating', 'disorders', 'suffered', 'balls', 'not', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'present', 'form', 'heads', 'her.Apart', 'off-putting', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'voice', 'only', 'thing', 'Revolution', 'can', 'minus', 'Bruce', 'Daniels', 'Far', 'be', 'suggest', 'who', 'Margaret', 'opening', 'act', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'gay', 'jokes', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'Not', 'Margaret', 'are', ""n't"", 'hers', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'original', 'there', 'hall', 'also', 'rather', 'small', 'camerawork', ""n't"", 'stellar', 'excellent', 'audience', 'make', 'up', 'that.Even', 'raunchy', 'out-there', 'material', 'Margaret', 'so', 'famous', 'reason', 'works', 'because', 'heart', 'lot', 'love', 'Margaret', 'tie', 'show', 'very', 'inspiring', 'hopeful', 'conclusion', 'making', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'hilarious', 'also', 'uplifting', 'spiritually', 'Maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'epiphany', 'Margaret', 'weaved', 'ITOTIW', 'what', 'one', 'raucous', 'romp', 'one', 'best', 'stand-up', 'comedians', 'not', 'reaction', 'Usually', 'howling', 'laughter', 'nowhere', 'pull', 'off', 'easier', 'here']",N/A

So even if the joke isn't all that great, she'll most likely be sporting this really funny face that will make you laugh. Also, her opening act is SO funny, check out his part on the extras.

830252,A1W4160OCCD1XO,B0002CHJHS,"brentbent ""I love Frylock""","[4, 8]","Margaret Cho pushes the comedic envelope yet again in this sublimely hilarious DVD where she discusses everything from W's inability to properly pronounce the word nuclear along with her impersonation of Condoleezza Rice informing W how it should be said to battling the overwhelming urge to poo in her pants (brought on by her all persimmon diet) while driving her car with no nearby bathroom and her surrendering to the inevitable mess to an outrageous impersonation of Gollum (this is not Asian chicken salad!) to recounting the disturbing disaster of a friend giving birth to her child and her vagina literally exploding apart onto Margaret.I also want to give her a big pat on the back for the Merchant & Ivory gag (purveyors of quality period films with lavish costumes and authentic accents) and the list of characters she will not play upon the screen: the smiling submissive manicurist, the angry Korean convenience store owner with a gun, or a deliriously lethargic opium addict in her den (the only role she could ever hope to have in a Merchant & Ivory film); so few people in the industry are willing to lose money and exposure to make a stand against such banal and harmful stereotypes and she deserves a round of applause for it! (Yes, she should be given a pat on the back and a round of applause.)This is not for the faint of heart nor staunch conservatives for Margaret does not censor her thoughts-if it pops into her mind she says it; how many of us would ring our friends to tell them that you just pooped in your pants?I also enjoyed her ever shifting personas and I have to wonder if she might have multiple personalities or is that yet another display of her dazzling talent?There are also several bonus features including her ""Top 10 Jacked People of 2004"" where she discusses with her friend, the one from the start of the main feature (cannot remember his name), ten famous people that were mistreated, sometimes deservingly so, by the media in the last year and footage from when she was at Sacramento, California in support of gay marriage.My only complaint is that there was less political humor in it than in The Notorious C.H.O. but this is a minor thing that only a political/media junky like myself would notice and it does not detract from the DVD's quality; but, if I had my way at least half her act would be political humor but that would not work too well in America where the vast majority of people are utterly ignorant about what is happening in the political arena.This is humor for fans of The Office, Absolutely Fabulous, Southpark, The Simpsons, and Chappelle's Show.",5,A Nukalur Bomb of Comedy,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,2613,"['Margaret', 'Cho', 'comedic', 'envelope', 'yet', 'again', 'sublimely', 'hilarious', 'DVD', 'where', 'everything', 'W', 'inability', 'properly', 'pronounce', 'word', 'nuclear', 'impersonation', 'Condoleezza', 'Rice', 'informing', 'W', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'battling', 'overwhelming', 'urge', 'poo', 'pants', 'brought', 'persimmon', 'diet', 'driving', 'car', 'nearby', 'bathroom', 'surrendering', 'inevitable', 'mess', 'outrageous', 'impersonation', 'Gollum', 'not', 'Asian', 'chicken', 'salad', 'recounting', 'disturbing', 'disaster', 'friend', 'giving', 'birth', 'child', 'vagina', 'literally', 'exploding', 'apart', 'Margaret.I', 'also', 'want', 'give', 'big', 'pat', 'back', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'gag', 'purveyors', 'quality', 'period', 'films', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'authentic', 'accents', 'list', 'characters', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'screen', 'smiling', 'submissive', 'manicurist', 'angry', 'Korean', 'convenience', 'store', 'owner', 'gun', 'deliriously', 'lethargic', 'opium', 'addict', 'den', 'only', 'role', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'have', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'film', 'few', 'people', 'industry', 'are', 'willing', 'lose', 'money', 'exposure', 'make', 'stand', 'such', 'banal', 'harmful', 'stereotypes', 'round', 'applause', 'Yes', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'pat', 'back', 'round', 'applause', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'staunch', 'conservatives', 'Margaret', 'not', 'censor', 'thoughts-if', 'mind', 'how', 'many', 'would', 'ring', 'friends', 'tell', 'just', 'pooped', 'pants', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'ever', 'shifting', 'personas', 'have', 'wonder', 'might', 'have', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'yet', 'display', 'dazzling', 'talent', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'Top', '10', 'Jacked', 'People', '2004', 'where', 'friend', 'one', 'start', 'main', 'feature', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'name', 'ten', 'famous', 'people', 'were', 'mistreated', 'sometimes', 'deservingly', 'so', 'media', 'last', 'year', 'footage', 'when', 'was', 'Sacramento', 'California', 'support', 'gay', 'marriage.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'less', 'political', 'humor', 'Notorious', 'C.H.O', 'minor', 'thing', 'only', 'political/media', 'junky', 'would', 'notice', 'not', 'detract', 'DVD', 'quality', 'had', 'way', 'least', 'half', 'act', 'would', 'be', 'political', 'humor', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'too', 'well', 'America', 'where', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'are', 'utterly', 'ignorant', 'what', 'happening', 'political', 'arena.This', 'humor', 'fans', 'Office', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'Southpark', 'Simpsons', 'Chappelle', 'Show']",N/A

I can only agree with the other Margaret fans who were just left wondering what was going on when they watched this. I loved the first two DVDs. I'm English and, frankly, not many American comics translate like Margaret. On form, she's phenominal. So what went wrong?The performance is tired and flat. There is an air of depression hanging over the whole fiasco - including the pre-concert footage. I'm used to her enjoying her work - laughing along with the audience - but on this outing, I don't recall seeing any of her usual joire de vivre.Yes, there are still some laugh out loud moments. But on the whole, the material is second rate. Too much mugging. And I wasn't amused at any point by the persimmons gag - and as it goes on and on and... It's just crude and unfunny. (I don't mind crude AND funny!)Most remarkable is her complete failure to reference her weight loss - and so when she goes off on one about body facism it just jars. As for the tacked on ""Revolution"" manifesto at the end? It just sounded like an afterthought. It wasn't integrated at all.Don't get me wrong, I admire Margaret immensely. Wish her luck.

I just didn't feel that the show flowed smoothly. It seemed a little disjointed, unfocused, and maybe even a little uninspired. Her previous two shows both seemed to have a central theme: ""I'm the One That I Want"" being about a journey to self-acceptance and ""Notorious C.H.O."" being about sexual politics. ""Revolutions"" seemed to be sort of a rehash of territory already covered in her two previous shows.All that being said, I still enjoyed the show. There were some extremely funny moments (my personal favorite being Margaret talking about dancing on Dr. Atkins' grave with two loaves of bread). And I also found Margaret's closing remarks about speaking your truth as a way to empowerment and liberation inspiring. Even if this isn't Margaret at her best, Margaret is still doing what very few comedians, artists or human beings in general have the guts to do: baring her soul in a completely raw, honest and courageous way.Aside from the show, one of my favorite things about the DVD was one of the special features, which shows Margaret speaking at a rally for gay marriage taking place at the capital building of California. Margaret's commitment to civil rights is inspiring and should be commended.

830259,AYF69WLAHWP0E,B0002CHJHS,Kevin Kochanski,"[35, 44]","This DVD is disappointing.  If you're a Cho fan, you'll find something in it to laugh at, but it's by FAR the least of her three movies.  If you wondered why this one never played cinemas, you'll know why when you see it.  She's very disoriented, and never builds momentum, often bringing the show to a dead halt.  She performs the beginning of the show in an elaborate costume, complete with wig and pearls, but never explains what this is for.  And yes, she does a routine all about incontinence.Now I love poop jokes as much as anyone, but any comedy critic knows that props and potty humor mean you're at the end of the line.Finally, I'm perplexed by the inexplicable halving of Cho's size.  She spent all this time in her first two movies talking about how she came to terms with the fact that that's just who she is, how she's shaped.  So where did half of her go?  She should have built in a funny, self-effacing routine describing her weight loss.  Instead, she ignores it, and then at the end lapses into her now-trite sincerity schtick about accepting who we are.  I can't help feeling she's a bit of a hypocrite.  In previous films, she's led up to the self-confidence sappy portion by being funny about it, and by being sincere...in Revolution, it comes out of nowhere, and seems pat and trite.Don't get me started on that loser who opens for her.  You see clips of his performance before her show, and I wondered if he was just deadpan, using his dryness to effect.  Wrong.  After watching his full performance (an extra on the DVD), I realize he just has NO STAGE PRESENCE and is utterly UNFUNNY!  Not one bit of his act was remotely original or amusing, engaging or even lively.  Was this supposed to make Cho seem funnier?Cho has her moments, and if you're a fan, there will be plenty of chuckles and even a few belly-laughs, so maybe rent this one with low expectations.  But I miss the Margaret Cho I know and love.  I am not comfortable with this thin, costumed woman, who spends half the show hiding under her ghetto-drag-queen voice for no reason.

It is not funny, and the pussy jokes don't make it better - in fact they make it worse. One good thing I noticed is Margaret lost some pounds, and got a better makeup stylist, but she should also hire better writers, because the way it is now - her act sucks through the fire hose. Maybe she is on this special medication, which alters your perception so that the nonsense she is uttering seems funny, but unfortunately my druggist hasn't got it.

After enjoying her latest stand up special 'Beautiful', I picked this one up hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately this one wasn't as strong. Things started off good with Cho talking about George Bush, the challenges of growing up in an immigrant family, and doing funny impersonations of her mom. Then things stall for about forty five minutes. The entire middle section drags on with no real laughs and even the audience seems bored. They only get back into it after Margaret relives a horrifying accident that happened to her while she was driving. (It doesn't involve cars). Things end on a high note with Cho speaking very movingly about respecting her father, how media stereotypes negatively influence young women and calling on everyone to join her in a revolution aimed at changing how society feels about sexual orientation, race, gender, politics and anything else that needs fixing. If the middle were as strong as the opening and ending this could have been a great show. The DVD extras include more of Margaret and her opening act, the very smart and funny Bruce Daniels, discussing current events and attending a Gay Marriage rally.

I just rented and watched it yesterday and in the name of being ""efficient"" returned it to Blockbuster this morning. I'm already thinking of renting it again! And I'm the type of person who hates watching anything more than once! Like many reviewers, I didn't like the ""Notorious"" DVD as much as ""I'm The One That I Want.""  But I like ""Cho Revolution"" the best of the three!  Cho's performance on this one seems more balanced, on previous tapes, her political rants, though great, were a bit too long and I sort of spaced out. This one has just the right balance of politics and comedy.  And though her impression of her mother is totally hysterical, she keeps it to more of a minimum in this performance, which was a plus. My favorite parts of the act include her rant on Asian Chicken salad, during which I could not stop laughing, and her rant on the diet that makes you crap yourself. I'd also like to know what she did to lose the weight since she talks in her act about her new attitude toward dieting, which basically boils down to she eats what she wants and doesn't exercise. But she must be doing something.I can relate to Cho, I used to be really slutty and party a lot, and I have IBS so I can relate to the diet that makes you crap in your pants.
