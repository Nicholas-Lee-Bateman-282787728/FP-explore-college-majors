880153,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B0007CNY0Y,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[5, 10]","This is just dreadful. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this dreck. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but I don't remember laughing much, except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors.An unnattractive middle-aged man called Lester meets up with rich unnattractive middle-aged women via lonely hearts ads, and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. That's the whole plot, and that's really all that happens. Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret, but its so badly implemented, you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening. The sequences in which Lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies. One sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven. It's very cruelly depicted, but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music, with Lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout. Another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs...you have to see this to believe it!Actually - you don't have to see it at all, in fact I strongly recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career. One sequence stood out to me as particulalrly wretched: the revelation when Lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen, so from this point on he just films the actor as normal, shadow and all!! And thus totally blows the whole angle. Either he had zero budget for effects, or he just didn't care enough to think up any way of showing it. Whatever it was, that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is. I couldn't even understand most of the film, and there certainly wasn't anything on screen worth looking at half the time. Even the ending was as flat as a pancake.

Sure the plot is thin and the acting is not that great, but I thought Brett Halsey did a pretty good job with the dark comedy and his insanity. There are some pretty good gore scenes. I think people are way to hard on Fulci's latter work. He was in poor health and you can't expect a great hit every time. Fulci is a one of a kind director.  Every movie isn't gonna be ""The Beyond"", ""Zombie"" or ""City of the Living Dead"". Give this film a chance.

880155,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0007CNY0Y,Dave. K,"[0, 1]","By the time Touch of Death was released Italian horror cinema had pretty much seen better days. While there were some good films coming out and some talented filmmakers still going strong it seemed as a whole Italian cinema was running out of steam. And in the case of Lucio Fulci his career really wasn't what it once was.The general conception even from the hardcore Fulci fans was he started to lose his touch around the mid 80s one can argue The New York Ripper was his last solid flick. From 1980-1982 Fulci made a total of 7 movies. That's a lot of films in a short span. By the time Touch of Death came out Fulci was far removed from the filmmaker he once was. This movie is one of the weaker efforts of his career. Fulci strays from his typical style, but also returns. A lot of people aren't aware that Fulci actually made quite a few comedies. And with Touch of Death he makes a horror/comedy.Problem is the movie isn't very suspenseful and it's really not that funny either. In some of Fulci's movies there can be some unintentional comedy due to some of the poor dubbing. But Touch of Death all the comedy is done intentionally. The first half of the movie has some fairly decent moments. It's funny because it's just so idiotic, but once the 2nd half rolls around Touch of Death loses what little it had going for it.Despite only an 80-minute running time Touch of Death does drag a lot. The 2nd half of the movie nothing really happens it's sort of the same scene playing out over and over again. At least the first half was semi-entertaining. While I wouldn't say it was good at least some of the comedy worked because it was so silly.The screenplay was written by Lucio Fulci and it was very poor; the characters are boring and really lack. There really wasn't anything interesting about any of them. As director Fulci isn't really able to get much going. Like I said some of the comedy works because it's so dumb, but for the most part nothing really works. Quite honestly there is nothing Fulci about Touch of Death.The final act is idiotic and really lacks any sense; Italian horror films a lot of the times lack logic, but Touch of Death doesn't have any. Of all the Fulci movies I have seen this one is my least favorite. There are a couple of fairly decent gore scenes, but the couple of gore scenes hardly help elevate this.The cast wasn't really that good with the exception of a couple of the actors. Fans of Italian cinema should recognize Zora Kerova going under the name Zora Ulla Kessler and Fulci regular Al Cliver under the name Pier Luigi Conti. Neither one of them really stand-out here. And Brett Halsey who was the lead playing Lester Parson really makes for a boring main character. The viewers won't care if he gets away with his crimes or goes down. Halsey is in pretty much every scene, but lacks any onscreen presence.Lucio Fulci even in his prime was hit or miss and sometimes within the same movie. Fulci isn't for everybody, but I think even those who don't like his work can agree it's better than his later work. It was painful watching Touch of Death; this movie was by a filmmaker I really liked and while I can very much understand why some dislike his work, for me he was an excellent director and despite moments of being incoherent who was able to create some good tension.The hardcore fans will probably wanna seek this out because they are a fan, but I will say this really isn't a much see. For those who dislike Fulci I would advise you not to even bother.",2,"One of Fulci's worst, if not his worst movie",1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,3511,"['time', 'Touch', 'Death', 'was', 'released', 'Italian', 'horror', 'cinema', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'were', 'good', 'films', 'coming', 'out', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'seemed', 'whole', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'case', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'career', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'once', 'was.The', 'general', 'conception', 'even', 'hardcore', 'Fulci', 'fans', 'was', 'started', 'lose', 'touch', 'mid', '80s', 'one', 'can', 'argue', 'New', 'York', 'Ripper', 'was', 'last', 'solid', 'flick', '1980-1982', 'Fulci', 'made', 'total', '7', 'movies', 'lot', 'films', 'short', 'span', 'time', 'Touch', 'Death', 'came', 'out', 'Fulci', 'was', 'far', 'removed', 'filmmaker', 'once', 'was', 'movie', 'one', 'weaker', 'efforts', 'career', 'Fulci', 'typical', 'style', 'also', 'returns', 'lot', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'Fulci', 'actually', 'made', 'quite', 'few', 'comedies', 'Touch', 'Death', 'horror/comedy.Problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'very', 'suspenseful', 'really', 'not', 'funny', 'Fulci', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'due', 'poor', 'dubbing', 'Touch', 'Death', 'comedy', 'done', 'intentionally', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'fairly', 'decent', 'moments', 'funny', 'just', 'so', 'idiotic', 'once', '2nd', 'half', 'rolls', 'Touch', 'Death', 'what', 'little', 'had', 'going', 'it.Despite', 'only', '80-minute', 'running', 'time', 'Touch', 'Death', 'drag', 'lot', '2nd', 'half', 'movie', 'nothing', 'really', 'sort', 'same', 'scene', 'playing', 'out', 'over', 'again', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'semi-entertaining', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'good', 'least', 'comedy', 'worked', 'was', 'so', 'silly.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'characters', 'are', 'boring', 'really', 'lack', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'interesting', 'director', 'Fulci', ""n't"", 'really', 'able', 'get', 'much', 'going', 'said', 'comedy', 'so', 'dumb', 'most', 'part', 'nothing', 'really', 'Quite', 'honestly', 'nothing', 'Fulci', 'Touch', 'Death.The', 'final', 'act', 'idiotic', 'really', 'sense', 'Italian', 'horror', 'lot', 'times', 'lack', 'logic', 'Touch', 'Death', ""n't"", 'have', 'Fulci', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'are', 'couple', 'fairly', 'decent', 'gore', 'scenes', 'couple', 'gore', 'scenes', 'hardly', 'help', 'elevate', 'this.The', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'that', 'good', 'exception', 'couple', 'actors', 'Fans', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'should', 'recognize', 'Zora', 'Kerova', 'going', 'name', 'Zora', 'Ulla', 'Kessler', 'Fulci', 'regular', 'Al', 'Cliver', 'name', 'Pier', 'Luigi', 'Conti', 'one', 'really', 'stand-out', 'here', 'Brett', 'Halsey', 'who', 'was', 'lead', 'playing', 'Lester', 'Parson', 'really', 'boring', 'main', 'character', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'away', 'crimes', 'down', 'Halsey', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'onscreen', 'presence.Lucio', 'Fulci', 'even', 'prime', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'sometimes', 'same', 'movie', 'Fulci', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'think', 'even', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'work', 'can', 'agree', 'better', 'later', 'work', 'was', 'painful', 'watching', 'Touch', 'Death', 'movie', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'really', 'liked', 'can', 'very', 'much', 'understand', 'why', 'dislike', 'work', 'was', 'excellent', 'director', 'moments', 'being', 'incoherent', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'good', 'tension.The', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'wan', 'na', 'seek', 'out', 'are', 'fan', 'will', 'say', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'see', 'who', 'dislike', 'Fulci', 'would', 'advise', 'not', 'even', 'bother']",N/A

880157,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0007CNY0Y,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 4]","No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best Italian horror directors. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your gore cravings. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Lucio from my play list, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a competent director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography. Welcome to ""Touch of Death"".The movie introduces us to a sad, pathetic loser named Lester Parson (Brett Halsey). Old Lester has a big problem with the ponies, one that finds him constantly digging himself deeper into debt in order to satisfy his cravings at the racetrack. He also has a problem trying to pull off that cheesy looking beard, but that's another story for another day. Anyway, Parson loses so much money gambling that he must constantly borrow dinero from a local loan shark to cover his bets. You know what happens next: Parson owes so much money that the shark threatens to send a few bonecrushers over to Lester's place unless he pays his debts. Ooooh! Fortunately for our bearded hero, he hits upon an excellent plan that will not only pay off Luigi the Loan Shark but also fill his wallet to the brim with some walkin' around money. What's the plan? Simple. He pores through lonely heart ads in the newspaper, finds a suitable mark, and then homes in for the wooin' and the robbin'. Yep, that's right. Lester Parson preys on lonely old biddies, really ugly old dames too, and cleans out their bank accounts.To insure the success of his nefarious schemes, Parson has to kill his victims. Unfortunately for them, Lester seems to relish sending these ladies into the great unknown. I offer as proof of this assertion one of the opening scenes of the film, the one in which we see Les firing up the old chainsaw in order to reduce one of his conquests to her component parts. Fulci makes sure we understand what's going on by letting the camera linger on the unfolding atrocity. And linger. And linger. Yecch! We'll see more violence later, including a nasty bludgeoning and magic with a microwave, before the movie judders to a stop. Too, Uncle Lucio makes Parson a cannibal--just as a lark, I'd imagine. Let's see, what else happens? Oh yeah: someone else seems to be ambling around mirroring Lester's atrocities, which makes our man a wee bit nervous. He's so nervous, in fact, that he spends some time trying to discover the identity of this nefarious culprit. He also spends a lot of his free time tape recording comments about his various activities. Did I mention the tape machine talks to our hero? Uh huh. Looks like Lester's a little light in the head as well.""Touch of Death"" isn't a stellar addition to the horror canon, but then again Fulci wasn't turning out his best work by 1988. His glory days came earlier, in the 1970s and early 1980s. This movie, while gory in spots, fails to capture the charm of his earlier outings. In those movies Fulci would spread the sauce from beginning to end. Here, we see a trio of heinous crimes--a bum run over with a car, the bludgeoning followed by fun with microwaves, and the chainsaw gag--and then the gore essentially disappears. Seeming to sense that the movie won't live up to expectations, Fulci lards the film with healthy doses of black comedy. See Lester try to stuff body parts in the trunk of his car! Har Har Har! See Parson grimace as he must romance his extraordinarily ugly conquests! Oh, my sides! Granted, smooching a gal with hairy moles or cold sores isn't my cup of tea, but it's not particularly amusing either. The funniest thing about ""Touch of Death"" involves nothing that appears in the film but rather the realization that Lucio made the movie for television. For television! Those wacky Italians! In what bizarro universe would a movie like this appear on television?Considering the less than sublime quality of the film, it is somewhat surprising to see ""Touch of Death"" receive such an excellent treatment on DVD. I'm not talking about the picture quality, which isn't good by a long shot. It's the extras where this Media Blasters disc really shines. Included for our pleasure is a lengthy audio commentary from none other than the late Lucio Fulci! It is not actually a commentary in the traditional sense (he doesn't even discuss this film) but a sort of synopsis of Fulci's career spanning the time he spent as a screenwriter up to the arrival of his 1971 classic ""Lizard in a Woman's Skin"". Then we get comments from Fulci historian Paolo Albeiro and an interview with star Zora Kerova. Cool! Trailers, a still gallery, and a promo for ""Touch of Death"" round out the disc. Obviously, Fulci aficionados will want to pick up this disc. All other viewers should start with his classic stuff and work their way up to this one.",3,A lesser Fulci effort,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,5602,"['figure', 'horror', 'film', 'genre', 'as',

880158,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B0007CNY0Y,Richard Ross,"[1, 1]","Forgive me for paraphrasing Eli Roth who said those exact same words about 'The Human Centipede.' The difference is he went on to say that that was the highest compliment he could give a horror movie. I'm not trying to flatter Fulci, I'm stating a fact. I didn't even make it 10 minutes into the movie before developing a nagging stomach ache that stayed with me the whole time. What caused it? I'm still trying to decide if it was the rail thin woman with a mole on her face thicker than both her waist and her wrists dancing around naked, the lead actor eating what looked like lasagna but wasn't, or when that same guy took a chainsaw to a naked female corpse then fed the bones and gristle to his pets. Tough call, right? Make no mistake this movie is gross as hell. The only thing that kept me watching is that halfway through Fulci finally lets up on the gore and shifts gears into thriller/supernatural territory quite effectively.Lester Pearson (Brett Halsey), a psycho who hears voices, is a widower with a severe gambling addiction. In order to feed his habit, he preys on rich women looking for companionship. The catch is they're all ugly. We're talking women with moles, mustaches, beards, cleft lips, scabs, etc, etc. After he sleeps with them (an act which he videotapes so he can watch it again later), he poisons them and kills them. But not in any ho-hum kind of way. Lester is lethal with weapons as varied as branches, ovens, bullwhips, you name it he can maim with it. He disposes their remains as quickly as possible so that he can get his hands on their money and jewelry. Problem is his haste makes him sloppy and pretty soon witnesses are coming forward to the cops. And the hits keep on coming for this born loser: his windfall quickly runs out and he winds up owing a bookie over $20,000. Plus, a copycat killer pops up who starts harassing Lester and leaving his blood samples all over town. How's ol' Les gonna get out of this one?Like I said, the film's final act is its best. Fulci springs a couple of unexpected plot twists and he does a good job of getting into the mind of a psychopath. There's a telling line towards the end of the film when Lester is on the phone with a travel agent. He repeats his name and says ""That's right Pearson. Almost like a person."" Shortly after that he actually loses his shadow. What the hell is he? Fulci leaves these and many more questions unanswered since the film ends rather abruptly but its no less satisfying for it. The case promises that this film will divide Fulci fans right down the middle. It's an accurate statement because not only does Lucio provide the gore and more he also delivers a satisfying giallo thriller. It may be a lesser known effort, but it shows this master hadn't completely lost his touch.",2,It Actually Made Me Sick,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,2789,"['Forgive', 'paraphrasing', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'who', 'said', 'exact', 'same', 'words', ""'The"", 'Human', 'Centipede', 'difference', 'went', 'say', 'was', 'highest', 'compliment', 'could', 'give', 'horror', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'flatter', 'Fulci', ""'m"", 'stating', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'developing', 'nagging', 'stomach', 'ache', 'stayed', 'whole', 'time', 'What', 'caused', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'decide', 'was', 'rail', 'thin', 'woman', 'mole', 'face', 'thicker', 'waist', 'wrists', 'dancing', 'around', 'naked', 'lead', 'actor', 'eating', 'what', 'looked', 'like', 'lasagna', 'was', ""n't"", 'when', 'same', 'guy', 'took', 'chainsaw', 'naked', 'female', 'corpse', 'then', 'fed', 'bones', 'gristle', 'pets', 'Tough', 'call', 'right', 'Make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'gross', 'hell', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'watching', 'halfway', 'Fulci', 'finally', 'up', 'gore', 'shifts', 'gears', 'thriller/supernatural', 'territory', 'quite', 'effectively.Lester', 'Pearson', 'Brett', 'Halsey', 'psycho', 'who', 'voices', 'widower', 'severe', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'order', 'feed', 'habit', 'rich', 'women', 'looking', 'companionship', 'catch', ""'re"", 'ugly', ""'re"", 'talking', 'women', 'moles', 'mustaches', 'beards', 'cleft', 'lips', 'scabs', 'etc', 'etc', 'act', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'later', 'kills', 'not', 'ho-hum', 'kind', 'way', 'Lester', 'lethal', 'weapons', 'as', 'varied', 'branches', 'ovens', 'bullwhips', 'name', 'can', 'maim', 'remains', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'money', 'jewelry', 'Problem', 'haste', 'sloppy', 'pretty', 'soon', 'witnesses', 'are', 'coming', 'forward', 'cops', 'hits', 'keep', 'coming', 'born', 'loser', 'windfall', 'quickly', 'out', 'up', 'owing', 'bookie', '20,000', 'copycat', 'killer', 'up', 'who', 'harassing', 'Lester', 'leaving', 'blood', 'samples', 'town', 'How', 'ol', 'Les', 'gon', 'get', 'one', 'said', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'best', 'Fulci', 'couple', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twists', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'mind', 'psychopath', 'telling', 'line', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Lester', 'phone', 'travel', 'agent', 'name', 'right', 'Pearson', 'Almost', 'person', 'Shortly', 'actually', 'shadow', 'What', 'hell', 'Fulci', 'many', 'more', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'film', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'less', 'satisfying', 'case', 'film', 'will', 'divide', 'Fulci', 'fans', 'right', 'middle', 'accurate', 'statement', 'not', 'only', 'Lucio', 'provide', 'gore', 'more', 'also', 'satisfying', 'giallo', 'thriller', 'may', 'be', 'lesser', 'known', 'effort', 'master', 'had', ""n't"", 'completely', 'lost', 'touch']",N/A

Just watchable really.Like all fans of Italian horror know, Fulci's later films are just missing that special ""something"" that his 70s and early 80s films(the ones that made us fans) had.  Based on the strength of those early films, we tend to cut him slack and hope for a taste of what made those films unique to show up in the later ones.  Usually this doesn't happen, but a flash here and there does show up,and the films are entertaining in their own way.  Plus, it may not just be Fulci-the Italian horror industry on a whole started going downhill by the end of the 80s.So here we have Touch of Death which follows the adventures of Brett Halsey, who shacks up with rich widows to help pay for his gambling debts.  The women are all rather unattractive to say the least, and Halsey himself seems disgusted by what he must do.  He also videotapes the encounters, which seems to make little sense to me considering he was grossed out by having to sleep with the women in the first place.  And yes, he ends up murdering them too!!  Sometimes he even eats them!  This also made little sense to me because it always seemed like he killed them before he really got any money from them.Anyhow, the film jumps from one meet/seduce/kill/dispose of body scenario to another with occasional trips to the gambling bookie.  Plus, Halsey starts getting mysterious phone calls and becomes increasingly paranoid that someone is onto him....or maybe copying him....or maybe trying to drive him mad.  And where did his shadow go?It's really all not that terribly interesting.  Fulci tries for some black comedy here, such as Hitchcockian shenanigans while Halsey tries to dispose of the corpses(in a scene that goes on a bit too long, he simply cannot get the body to sit upright in the passenger seat-Hardy Har har!!!).  Unfortunately the comedy really isn't all that funny.  At least to me it wasn't.But on the plus side, I have always liked Halsey as an actor, and Fulci injects a bit more gore here than he did for his other movies around the same time period.Well, I guess that's all there really is to say about that.",3,"Well....It's Better Than Black Demons, For What That's Worth.",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,2243,"['Yeah', ""'m"", 'Fulci', 'fan', 'try', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'Touch', 'Death', ""n't"", 'great', 'Just', 'watchable', 'really.Like', 'fans', 'Italian', 'horror', 'know', 'Fulci', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'missing', 'special', 'something', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'films', 'ones', 'made', 'fans', 'had', 'Based', 'strength', 'early', 'films', 'tend', 'cut', 'slack', 'hope', 'taste', 'what', 'made', 'films', 'unique', 'show', 'up', 'later', 'ones', 'Usually', ""n't"", 'happen', 'flash', 'here', 'there', 'show', 'up', 'films', 'are', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way', 'may', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'Fulci-the', 'Italian', 'horror', 'industry', 'whole', 'started', 'going', 'downhill', 'end', '80s.So', 'here', 'have', 'Touch', 'Death', 'adventures', 'Brett', 'Halsey', 'who', 'up', 'rich', 'widows', 'help', 'pay', 'gambling', 'debts', 'women', 'are', 'rather', 'unattractive', 'say', 'least', 'Halsey', 'disgusted', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'also', 'encounters', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'considering', 'was', 'grossed', 'out', 'having', 'sleep', 'women', 'first', 'place', 'yes', 'up', 'murdering', 'too', 'Sometimes', 'even', 'also', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'always', 'seemed', 'killed', 'really', 'got', 'money', 'them.Anyhow', 'film', 'jumps', 'one', 'meet/seduce/kill/dispose', 'body', 'scenario', 'occasional', 'trips', 'gambling', 'bookie', 'Halsey', 'getting', 'mysterious', 'phone', 'calls', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'someone', '.or', 'maybe', 'copying', 'maybe', 'trying', 'drive', 'mad', 'where', 'did', 'shadow', 'go', 'really', 'not', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'Fulci', 'black', 'comedy', 'here', 'such', 'Hitchcockian', 'shenanigans', 'Halsey', 'tries', 'dispose', 'corpses', 'scene', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'body', 'sit', 'upright', 'passenger', 'seat-Hardy', 'Har', 'har', 'Unfortunately', 'comedy', 'really', ""n't"", 'funny', 'least', 'plus', 'side', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Halsey', 'actor', 'Fulci', 'bit', 'more', 'gore', 'here', 'did', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'time', 'period.Well', 'guess', 'really', 'say']",N/A
