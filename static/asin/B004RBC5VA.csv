It doesn't seem that step was taken with this dvd. The 'class setting' would have been fine if the person front and center of the 'class' had been the instructor of whom which you should be able to see the full presence - duh!Other reviewers hit it straight on that the issues with this production makes it almost unusable. For example during the shimmy section there was supposed to be a spectacular lower body shimmy drill that the viewer was supposed to follow along with. Well how can the viewer follow along with this DRILL if the only camera angle at that time is fixed on Zoe's upper body?Perhaps they can go back and edit the multiple problem areas of this production and replace the dvds of those of us that think we've just wasted our money.

She is VERY verbal, talking non-stop, and painstakingly showing correct positions while slowly going through the drills. She makes a few errors as she speaks, but instead of doing another take, she corrects herself, occasionally laughing at her own flub. This might get annoying with repeated viewings. The group drills definitely flow better than the individual instruction section, with no stopping to explain technique, but the viewer is confused by the strange angles. Zoe faces her students and everyone is filmed at a sort of sideways angle to the camera. Speaking of camera, at times the cameraman focuses on Zoe's upper body during a drill (and also, unforgivably, during Zoe's performance.) It might take me several viewings to figure out some of these drill sequences. This is not a dvd for beginners, but for more intermediate students of tribal style belly dance. In summary, I like this dvd, but I wish there could be some kind of training manual for people who film instructional dance dvds. Rule #1: We need to see the instructor's entire body!",3,Hello?

I truly absolutely adore your dancing, your stylization, your sass, and your stage presence.But I'd really honestly like to throttle whoever convinced you that this DVD was a finished product.I purchased this DVD back when it first came out and eagerly awaited its arrival. When it came, I went straight to my DVD player and popped it in, super excited to start working with Zoe's drills. I'd previously attended multiple workshops with her here in Florida and found her to be a wonderfully exuberant instructor who really has some unique material to share which she does so clearly and openly. I was not expecting combos, or specific movements, or anything fancy - I was just looking forward to getting a peek into the methodology Zoe uses to refine her signature snap crackle and pop type movements.I'm really sad to say that it's taken me this long to write this review because I was so incredibly disappointed.While that same enthusiasm Zoe always shows does transfer to the DVD, the actual instructional content does not. And, to be honest, it makes me extraordinarily frustrated because, well, Zoe does a much better job as an instructor than this DVD does of showcasing her teaching abilities.The reviews that have talked about the lack of production quality are dead on - this is an absolutely no-frills, bare bones instructional DVD. Which would be perfectly ok with me - I've definitely loved other DVDs where the quality wasn't that great - but here the low quality is actually distracting from the material being taught and makes it at times near impossible to understand what is happening. Sorry director, but a closeup of Zoe's belly while she is demonstrating a hip based movement is not going to communicate what's happening. VERY aggravating! And, yes, those odd camera angles continue as we watch strange 3/4 views of her that don't show the ""working hip"" where she is moving, or the view of the class in front of her that only shows about half of her from behind as she dances. Sigh. I can rail on all day about how much better this could have been...nay, how much better Zoe deserves! But I'll spare you.I wish I could write a longer review, and one that was more positive. I'm giving this 3 stars (minusing for the bad production issues others have already griped about) and not fewer because the instructional material that IS here is quite useful. And I WILL say is that, even though I really didn't like this DVD very much, I still WILL buy the new 4 DVD set because my experience in Zoe's workshops was that good and I'm hoping that, much like Rachel Brice, once she switches to another production company the final product will reflect it and allow her to shine.",3,It's Taken Me This Long To Write This...,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,2696,"['Ah', 'Zoe', 'truly', 'absolutely', 'dancing', 'stylization', 'sass', 'stage', 'presence.But', ""'d"", 'really', 'honestly', 'throttle', 'whoever', 'convinced', 'DVD', 'was', 'finished', 'product.I', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'arrival', 'When', 'came', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'player', 'popped', 'super', 'excited', 'start', 'working', 'Zoe', 'drills', ""'d"", 'previously', 'attended', 'multiple', 'workshops', 'here', 'Florida', 'found', 'be', 'wonderfully', 'exuberant', 'instructor', 'who', 'really', 'unique', 'material', 'share', 'so', 'clearly', 'openly', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'combos', 'specific', 'movements', 'anything', 'fancy', 'was', 'just', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'peek', 'methodology', 'Zoe', 'refine', 'signature', 'snap', 'crackle', 'pop', 'type', 'movements.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'sad', 'say', 'taken', 'long', 'write', 'review', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'same', 'enthusiasm', 'Zoe', 'always', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'actual', 'instructional', 'content', 'not', 'be', 'honest', 'extraordinarily', 'frustrated', 'well', 'Zoe', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'instructor', 'DVD', 'showcasing', 'teaching', 'abilities.The', 'reviews', 'have', 'talked', 'lack', 'production', 'quality', 'are', 'dead', 'absolutely', 'no-frills', 'bare', 'bones', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'Which', 'would', 'be', 'perfectly', 'ok', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'loved', 'other', 'DVDs', 'where', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'here', 'low', 'quality', 'actually', 'distracting', 'material', 'being', 'taught', 'times', 'near', 'impossible', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'Sorry', 'director', 'closeup', 'Zoe', 'belly', 'demonstrating', 'hip', 'based', 'movement', 'not', 'going', 'communicate', 'what', 'happening', 'VERY', 'aggravating', 'yes', 'odd', 'camera', 'angles', 'continue', 'watch', 'strange', '3/4', 'views', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'working', 'hip', 'where', 'moving', 'view', 'class', 'front', 'only', 'half', 'behind', 'Sigh', 'can', 'rail', 'day', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nay', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'Zoe', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'you.I', 'wish', 'could', 'write', 'longer', 'review', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'positive', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'minusing', 'bad', 'production', 'issues', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'griped', 'not', 'fewer', 'instructional', 'material', 'here', 'quite', 'useful', 'WILL', 'say', 'even', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'still', 'WILL', 'buy', 'new', '4', 'DVD', 'set', 'experience', 'Zoe', 'workshops', 'was', 'good', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'much', 'Rachel', 'Brice', 'once', 'production', 'company', 'final', 'product', 'will', 'reflect', 'allow', 'shine']",N/A
