I prefer greenery; I was hoping to see beautiful scenery. But most of this blu ray contained dry, rocky landscapes and sparse vegetation. Lots of dirt and rocks, that's for sure. Some caves.It did have a segment on Muir Woods which I thought was astoundingly wonderful. After that one, it went right back to rocky, dry, desolate landscapes. Some people enjoy this sort of thing, I don't. Looking at all those dry, hot landscapes, one after another, it just wasn't what I had hoped for.

It is like taking a tour - the commentators are park guides, all very enthusiastic about their jobs at the National Monuments. Scientists and historians are also interviewed - giving solid information about the sites. As an Australian, who has enjoyed travel and especially the USA, I found myself learning more about American history, geography and culture from this informative and well photographed series. Do not expect action thrills and chills, but it is a great Blu Ray to teach the kids, and yourselves more about the USA, and the American heritage the citizens and tourists can enjoy.The Harper Trading System",5,A National Treasure.,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,665,"['am', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'series', 'taking', 'tour', 'commentators', 'are', 'park', 'guides', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'jobs', 'National', 'Monuments', 'Scientists', 'historians', 'are', 'also', 'interviewed', 'giving', 'solid', 'information', 'sites', 'Australian', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'travel', 'especially', 'USA', 'found', 'learning', 'more', 'American', 'history', 'geography', 'culture', 'informative', 'well', 'photographed', 'series', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'action', 'thrills', 'chills', 'great', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'teach', 'kids', 'more', 'USA', 'American', 'heritage', 'citizens', 'tourists', 'can', 'enjoy.The', 'Harper', 'Trading', 'System']",Americas National Treasures: The Complete 12 Volume Series

It is not bad but could have been much better. I enjoyed it and did learn a bit from it but I think it suffered by not having enough production value even though having some great subject matter.

Evidently, I failed  to say  America's National Treasure  is  a  Great  video set.Information combined with great scenery.  I  placed a second order, after watching it.  The second order was for  giftsfor Christmas.  Seven hours  of  great entertainment  for  under ten dollars.  A magazine off a rack cost almost that much.In my opinion, this is better  then many  National Geographic  sets, and  they cost more.  Watch it  and  donate it to yourlocal library, if  you think you can not watch it again.  It is like visiting  the parks  and  history is added.
