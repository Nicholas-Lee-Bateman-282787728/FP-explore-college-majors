This show went from one of the funniest of all-time (seasons 1 & 2) to a pathetic shell of what it had once been.  Season 3 started the decline, but was still pretty good.  Season 4 is just a desperate attempt to milk a once-great series for all that it's worth.  A show is really at its end when there start to be unnecessary relationships between characters like the one between Troy and Britta.  Chang has just become an annoying, unfunny, and unnecessary character that has only had an expanded role because he's become famous from movies.  Then there's the most glaring question: Why is it taking this study group 4 years to graduate from a 2 year school?  Now there's going to be a season 5?  Had this show just ended after two years, it would have gone out on top and left us wanting more, not wishing that it would just end and be put out of its misery.",1,This Never Should Have Happened.,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,942,"['absolutely', 'reason', 'why', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'show', 'went', 'one', 'funniest', 'all-time', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'pathetic', 'shell', 'what', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'Season', '3', 'started', 'decline', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'Season', '4', 'just', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'milk', 'once-great', 'series', 'worth', 'show', 'really', 'end', 'when', 'start', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'relationships', 'characters', 'one', 'Troy', 'Britta', 'Chang', 'just', 'become', 'annoying', 'unfunny', 'unnecessary', 'character', 'only', 'had', 'expanded', 'role', 'become', 'famous', 'movies', 'Then', 'most', 'glaring', 'question', 'Why', 'taking', 'study', 'group', '4', 'years', 'graduate', '2', 'year', 'school', 'Now', 'going', 'be', 'season', '5', 'Had', 'show', 'just', 'ended', 'two', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'top', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'not', 'wishing', 'would', 'just', 'end', 'be', 'put', 'misery']",N/A

The new show runners have worked on Happy Endings, and it shows.Community is morphing into a more straightforward series, I guess you could say.  While each season with Dan Harmon leading the way got progressively stranger and sillier, season 4 is pulling it back a little and focusing on character development.  I've heard some people say that they feel this season of Community has felt a bit stale, but I find it just as charming, albeit with a very different rhythm.If you've liked Community in the past and are open to some change, you should give this season a shot!",5,Different but still going strong!,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,707,"['Season', '4', 'Community', 'hard', 'watch', 'considering', 'absence', 'Dan', 'Harmon', 'voice', 'replacement', 'new', 'show', 'runners', 'new', 'show', 'runners', 'have', 'worked', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'shows.Community', 'morphing', 'more', 'straightforward', 'series', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'season', 'Dan', 'Harmon', 'leading', 'way', 'got', 'progressively', 'stranger', 'sillier', 'season', '4', 'pulling', 'back', 'little', 'focusing', 'character', 'development', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'feel', 'season', 'Community', 'felt', 'bit', 'stale', 'find', 'just', 'charming', 'very', 'different', 'rhythm.If', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'Community', 'past', 'are', 'open', 'change', 'should', 'give', 'season', 'shot']",N/A
1597945,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B009LDCW1M,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","Jeff Winger's time at Greendale Community College is coming to an end. Graduation, and a return to his former career as a hotshot lawyer, is now in sight. But standing in the way is a villainous English history teacher, his own (reluctantly growing) sense of community and events unfolding in another timeline altogether.Every long-running series has its Attack of the Clones, Crossroads of Twilight or &#34;Jack's tattoo episode&#34; moment, when the creative engines misfire and things fall out of alignment. Characters don't gel like they used, lines are delivered with less conviction and everything just goes a bit wrong.In the case of Community, this problem was inflicted on the show by the studio: creator and showrunner Dan Harmon was fired between Seasons 3 and 4 and the show had to struggle on without its primary creative force. Given that Community is a finely balanced mix of meta-commentary, comedy and character development and even Harmon couldn't get it right all of the time (see the uneven opening to Season 1 or the middle of Season 3), it's unsurprising that Season 4 is a bit of a mess.The show remains entertaining, even though the moments of out-of-character behaviour and dialogue grate. The performances remain strong and there's some genius moments of casting, with Malcolm McDowell playing the hard history teacher and a reasonable turn by Matt Lucas as an Inspector Spacetime fan to rival Abed. There's also some nice follow-ups to earlier seasons, with the finale combining both the 'darkest timeline' storyline that began in early Season 3 and finding a way of bringing back the paintball game in a different way. Even Britta recovers from her Season 2/3 descent into ditziness and is a moderately more interesting character this year. There's also a clever episode - a puppet musical - which pokes fun at the whole idea of high-concept episodes and feels like it could have been made on Harmon's watch.Unfortunately these high points only emphasise the lows: the over-reliance on the Dean and the now utterly-redundant Chang for cheap jokes, the mishandling of Abed and indeed the whole pop culture angle (often just referencing things rather than using them to highlight plot or character) and the total sidelining of Pierce until he basically just vanishes from the show altogether. The actors, directors and writers make a heroic effort to make up for Harmon's absence, but there is no disguising that the show is no longer operating on the same level. Fortunately, the studio saw sense and Harmon was reinstated for the fifth (and, for now, final) season, which has been much more positively received.Community's fourth season (***) is certainly watchable, with its share of funny moments. It also does move the characters and storylines forward more successfully than I was expecting. However, there are too many moments which misfire, too many moments when characters say and do things that feel off and too many lazy references to previous, funnier episodes. There's some fun to be had from revisiting Greendale, but Harmon's absence is palpable. The season is available now in the UK and USA.",3,"The weakest season, but not a complete waste of time",1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,3134,"['Jeff', 'Winger', 'time', 'Greendale', 'Community', 'College', 'coming', 'end', 'Graduation', 'return', 'former', 'career', 'hotshot', 'lawyer', 'now', 'sight', 'standing', 'way', 'villainous', 'English', 'history', 'teacher', 'own', 'reluctantly', 'growing', 'sense', 'community', 'events', 'unfolding', 'timeline', 'altogether.Every', 'long-running', 'series', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'Crossroads', 'Twilight', '34', 'Jack', 'tattoo', 'episode', '34', 'moment', 'when', 'creative', 'engines', 'misfire', 'things', 'fall', 'alignment', 'Characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'used', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'less', 'conviction', 'everything', 'just', 'bit', 'case', 'Community', 'problem', 'was', 'inflicted', 'show', 'studio', 'creator', 'showrunner', 'Dan', 'Harmon', 'was', 'fired', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'show', 'had', 'struggle', 'primary', 'creative', 'force', 'Given', 'Community', 'finely', 'balanced', 'mix', 'meta-commentary', 'comedy', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'Harmon', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'time', 'see', 'uneven', 'opening', 'Season', '1', 'middle', 'Season', '3', 'unsurprising', 'Season', '4', 'bit', 'mess.The', 'show', 'entertaining', 'even', 'moments', 'out-of-character', 'behaviour', 'dialogue', 'grate', 'performances', 'remain', 'strong', 'genius', 'moments', 'casting', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'playing', 'hard', 'history', 'teacher', 'reasonable', 'turn', 'Matt', 'Lucas', 'Inspector', 'Spacetime', 'fan', 'rival', 'Abed', 'also', 'nice', 'follow-ups', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'finale', 'combining', ""'darkest"", 'timeline', 'storyline', 'began', 'early', 'Season', '3', 'finding', 'way', 'bringing', 'back', 'paintball', 'game', 'different', 'way', 'Even', 'Britta', 'recovers', 'Season', '2/3', 'descent', 'ditziness', 'moderately', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'year', 'also', 'clever', 'episode', 'puppet', 'musical', 'fun', 'whole', 'idea', 'high-concept', 'episodes', 'feels', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Harmon', 'watch.Unfortunately', 'high', 'points', 'only', 'emphasise', 'lows', 'over-reliance', 'Dean', 'now', 'utterly-redundant', 'Chang', 'cheap', 'jokes', 'mishandling', 'Abed', 'indeed', 'whole', 'pop', 'culture', 'angle', 'often', 'just', 'referencing', 'things', 'rather', 'using', 'highlight', 'plot', 'character', 'total', 'sidelining', 'Pierce', 'basically', 'just', 'vanishes', 'show', 'altogether', 'actors', 'directors', 'writers', 'make', 'heroic', 'effort', 'make', 'up', 'Harmon', 'absence', 'disguising', 'show', 'no', 'longer', 'operating', 'same', 'level', 'Fortunately', 'studio', 'saw', 'sense', 'Harmon', 'was', 'reinstated', 'fifth', 'now', 'final', 'season', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'positively', 'received.Community', 'fourth', 'season', '***', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'share', 'funny', 'moments', 'also', 'move', 'characters', 'storylines', 'forward', 'more', 'successfully', 'was', 'expecting', 'However', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'moments', 'misfire', 'too', 'many', 'moments', 'when', 'characters', 'say', 'do', 'things', 'feel', 'too', 'many', 'lazy', 'references', 'previous', 'funnier', 'episodes', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'revisiting', 'Greendale', 'Harmon', 'absence', 'palpable', 'season', 'available', 'now', 'UK', 'USA']",N/A
1597946,A38JS6K5ERRXQ6,B009LDCW1M,Bionic Hugo,"[6, 11]","...not Dan Harmon. NBC has made the worst decisions ever in the past two years. They juggled their winning Thursday night line up until they killed it. Parks and Rec, The Office, and especially Community were the sacrificial lambs they used to try to resurrect their Love Child, ""30 Rock"", which in no way shape or form competed with the other three. I can't help but believe this desperate attempt to resurrect 30 Rock was payback for Tina Fey's character destruction of Sarah Palin. Three great shows were killed to save it, like sacrifices on a pagan altar. Each one was moved from time slot to time slot, and even forced to take a hiatus, only to lose audience interest from inconsistency. We are now watching the swan song of The Office, and very likely Community as well. They could still save Community, by moving it away from the Big Bang Theory time slot, but they won't. They are merely running off the episodes they have in the can, and it let it disappear into that good night. A POX ON THE HOUSE OF NBC!! These three were the last shows I watched on that network, I won't watch another. They killed a great forum too, in the DMI forums... as a member, it was going gangbusters, then all of a sudden, NBC changed it all around and killed it too. Ask DMI veterans.I rated Community four stars because the series deserves respect, even if these last episodes do not match up with previous seasons.It's like watching Jack Nicklaus play golf today.

1597949,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B009LDCW1M,Cagneyfan67,"[1, 3]","I love Community and I still enjoyed this season a lot even though it wasn't as good as previous seasons with Dan Harmon not at the helm. The first episode was mixed. I wasn't sure if the season would be good or bad. The first episode was very creative and interesting. This season was a little different and didn't altogether have the original feel of community but I think the writers did the best they could and we got a good season under the circumstances. There were only three bad episodes in the season in my opinion which means 10 out of 13 episodes were good so it made for a pretty good season. I didn't like were Conventions of Space and Time, Alternate History of the German Invasion and Economics of Marine Biology.This season had a great guest star in Malcom Mcdowell who was great and was used right. He was great in Intro to Knots. This season dealt with Jeff meeting his dad for the first time in many years. I thought that was a good episode. We have the Britta and Troy storyline going on too. I think Troy and Britta storyline and story would have been written better by Dan Harmon but I didn't feel like it was the most important aspect of the show. I also think Jeff meeting his father would have better written by Dan Harmon but it was still a good episode and only one storyline in Community. I think Jeff meeting his dad was only meant to be for one episode so it's not like if that episode wasn't as good that it effects the big picture of the show. I would have liked to see Annie and Jeff finally get together this season but I think that will be saved for the final season of community.This season had a lot to do with Jeff's personal growth as he becomes a better person learning from his past mistakes and changing his philosophy on life as he has people in his life that he cares about and loves. It was nice to see Jeff's conclusion come from a different and deeper place as he realizes how his friends have changed him for the better and have become like a family. A family was what Jeff never really had with the absence of his father. He has that family in the end and it's a satisfying end for any fan.Intro to Felt Surrogacy was one of my favorite episodes. I liked seeing the Greendale Seven as muppets and it was great to see Jason Alexander appear in the episode too. I liked the singing. Shirley is an especially good singer. The episode was very funny. I was sad to hear about Chevy Chase leaving the show and I was interested in seeing how he would exit the show. I liked the Halloween episode a lot. It's my third favorite episode in the season. Community always does great Halloween episodes. I thought Annie was funny dressed up as The Ring girl from the horror movie. It was a fun episode that had Pierce in a bigger role as his part is substantially smaller then previous seasons.One of the best episodes in the season was Herstory of Dance. It was a great episode that really felt like community when it was at it's best. It was nice to see Pierce play a bigger role and have him not portrayed as a jerk all the time as he was nice to Britta helping her with her dance. It was also interesting to see Abed have two dates and the possibility of a love interest in the following seasons given Troy's exit from the show in Season 5.  I love the show and don't want it to end. I liked Heroic Origins as it was a great episode and it was cool to see how all the characters had been connected in their past. I thought it was creative and a successful attempt on the writers to make the season better. The last six episodes of the season are especially good and it's nice to see the show ending on a strong note.The final episode was great. I felt satisfied if that would be the final episode of the series. It was cool having another paint ball episode as those are always fun. The Darkest Timeline theme was funny as we saw the characters dark sides in the other Timeline. Pierce graduating instead of dying was good as I didn't want something bad to happen towards the end of the season so it wouldn't be depressing. It's a pretty uplifting end as Jeff has become a better guy and will always be close friends with the study group members he met in community college.I think most people thought without Harmon the show would end but the fans once again kept the show alive. The season is probably the weakest of all seasons but it was a still good season. I was very happy to see Dan Harmon returned to Season Five. I am so glad there is a Season Five. It's too bad Donald Glover has also left the show in Season Five. Season Five has been very good so far and I think we will see many more Seasons of Community. to come Cheers!",5,Community Still Rules Spoilers,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,4674,"['love', 'Community',

1597956,A3RKFHBRBAG79P,B009LDCW1M,"Graham Swearingen ""Graham1138""","[35, 53]","I have to admit as a very big fan of the show, I was a bit worried about the start of the fourth season. After Dan Harmon (show creator and show runner) was fired by NBC, and writer Chris McKenna, Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, and producer Garrett Donovan left, I thought the show might feel a bit different. The fourth season premier ""History 101"" was directed by Community director veteran Tristram Shapeero and Community veteran writer Andy Bobrow, and while they implemented some new filming techniques, this episode definitely felt like the classic Community I have fallen in love with. The usual cast was in full effect, Jim Rash was utilized to his full potential as the Dean, and there was a great cliffhanger ending with the very absent Senior Chang (Ken Jeong). Actually, the only part of the episode I didn't much care for was the tag at the end of the episode which has become one of my favorite parts of the show.I will obviously continue watching the season (and updating to review every episode as they air) to see if it keeps up the Community feeling I have come to expect in this significantly shortened 12 or 13 episode season. With this strong season opener, I have faith that this season won't disappoint. Although I do feel it's almost blasphemous to watch it after the unfair firing of the genius Dan Harmon. Dan Harmon said it best, ""this show is supposed to pacify the masses"" and I definitely feel pacified by this first episode. Yes it felt a little different, but the episode addressed the change in a clever and very Community-like kind of way. Six seasons and a movie!* This DVD set comes with commentary on every episode, outtakes, deleted scenes, extended and alternate scenes, behind the scenes of ""Intro to Felt Surragacy"" and more*""Paranormal Parentage"" is the second episode of the season. Written by Megan Ganz who wrote a few episodes for the last two seasons of Community and directed by Tristram Shapeero, this episode revisits the idea of the gang in a haunted house that was introduced back in the clip episode in season 2 (Paradigm of Human Memory). It also brings back Pierce's brother Gilbert (Giancarlo Esposito from Breaking Bad) and develops Troy's and Britta's relationship a bit further. This episode is noticeably stronger than the season opener and also feels more like the last few seasons of Community. I always like the holiday episodes of Community and this Halloween episode is a classic. They delve a bit deeper into Jeff's daddy issues and Britta's progression as a therapist. There are some more references to Cougar Town, a cameo by the Norwegian troll (introduced in the season three episode ""Remedial Chaos Theory"", one of my all time favorite episodes) and Inspector Space Time. Although there is only a slight nod to Dean Pelton living next door to Jeff now, and no development of Ben Chang and his current state of Changnesia, the tag at the end of this episode definitely makes up for its very few short comings. This season is shaping up nicely already.""Conventions of Space and Time"" written by Maggie Bandur (writer of season 3 episode ""Competitive Ecology"") and directed by Michael Patrick Jann (Little Britain USA and Happy Endings) this episode sees the group go to an Inspector Space Time convention. The episode opener with Britta sneaking out of Troy's bedroom so as to keep Abed from finding out they're sleeping together, was awesome. Overall I thought the episode was great. We see Annie and Jeff's relationship develop a bit further as Annie day dreams and plays at being Mrs. Winger, meanwhile Jeff is confused as Inspector Space Time villain Thoraxis by guest star Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica). Abed's pen pal played by Matt Lucas (Little Britain and Bridesmaids) is another great cameo in this episode. Abed and Troy have their own little Inspector Space Time adventure which helps develop their friendship while also doing a good job of mirroring what I think would be a typical Inspector Space Time episode (Inspector while a genius alien, needs to be saved and kept grounded by his human companion/constable). There is still no further development of Senior Changs whereabouts or current state, the tag is great at the end of this episode with another great cameo by some original 90210 veterans. They play the American remake version of Inspector Space Time that Pierce and Shirley helped shape by being part of a test group at the convention. I have to say, I still think the season feels a bit different, it isn't bad. Maybe not quite as funny as other seasons, but I still get warm fuzzies from this show and it is still great and getting better every episode.""Alternative History of the German Invasion"" written by Community newcomer Ben Wexler (Still Standing) and directed by Steven Tsuchida (directed the Community Episode 'Origins of Vampire Mythology' from season 3) finally brings back Chang. The German bullies (minus Nick Kroll) from the episode 'Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism' are back and in the same class with the gang, about role reversal in the scribing of history (taught by the legendary Malcolm McDowell). Abed is actually friends with one of the German students via online gaming, while the others find themselves in a battle over the study room, told like a war film. The Dean sets out to convince the school board that Chang's current state of ""Changnesia"" is a rouse. There is also some great appearances I have been waiting to see this season from Community regulars like Leonard, Vicki, Garrett and Todd. Turns out that the school views the study group as the ""Germans"" of this battle over the study room by trying to get the Germans kicked out of the study room, and are touted as being Nazis. Mainly because the gang has hogged the study room for the last 3 seasons/school years. There are some great flashbacks to episodes from past seasons I thought were great. The study group redeems themselves and gives a little back to Greendale. A solid episode, very entertaining. The tag for this episode is easily the best of the season with the Troy and Abed Podcast. They played the song that Abed hummed while telling his spooky tale during the season 3 Halloween episode ""Horror Fiction In Seven Spooky Steps"". I laughed hard at this small nod to nerdy viewers like myself.""Cooperative Escapism In Familial Relations"" written by Steve Basilone (Happy Endings) directed by Tristram Shapeero has the gang celebrating Thanksgiving. While there is no Ben ""Kevin"" Chang in this episode (Ken Jeong must be absent this season because he was filming the Hangover Part 3 or something), there is a nice bit with Dean Pelton wearing Jeff's signature blue button down shirt and cowboy hat that I found funny. The episode focuses on Abed, Troy, Annie and Pierce attending Shirley's Thanksgiving, and there was a notable absence from Malcolm Jamal Warner who has played Shirley's husband. Abed does a Shawshank Redemption-esque voice over as the group tries to find away to escape Shirley's crazy extended family, most of which aren't seen. Meanwhile Jeff and Britta finally meet Jeff's dad (James Brolin) and his half-brother (Adam Devine from the brilliant and hilarious Workaholics) and try to not address the issues Jeff clearly has with his dad abandoning him as a child. I'll admit this episode was not that funny, I did like the references, I loved the cameos and thought the tag at the end was kinda cool, albeit not that funny, even though they used Abed's jazz song again. This season has played some episodes out of order of their production code and that probably has a lot to do with the roller coaster effect of a ""good"" episode and a just ""ok"" episode. I like what has been done so far this season with character development and story arcs, and I've loved the cameos and pop culture references. But I will admit, I find myself missing the Dan Harmon final touches to the punchline of jokes that he would sometimes stretch a whole episode or even a whole season. Dan Harmon knows what makes a good show, and he is a brilliant writer. I still have high hopes for this show, it may take the rest of the season for the new show runners to find their footing, and they will never be Dan Harmon but they're off to a good start. I also find myself in need of a really great Jeff Winger monologue that Dan always wrote so well. This show is still great, especially if you stay tuned and watch Parks And Rec or The Office which play after Community and are terribly unfunny. How Community isn't more popular is beyond me, it's easily one of the best shows on basic cable.""Advanced Documentary Filmmaking"" written by Hunter Covington (My Name Is Earl) and directed by Jay Chandrasekhar (Broken Lizards, Super Troopers, Beerfest, and the Community episode ""The First Chang Dynasty"", among others) this episode sees the gang finally deal with the Ben/Kevin Chang's Changnesia. This episode was also played out of production order which is nothing new for this show, it happens every season. For this season however, the episodes being played out of order seem to have made an odd rhythm for the seasons consistency and continuity. This episode is pretty straight forward, there is finally some decent screen time with both the Dean and Ben/Kevin Chang. I like the episodes that Jay directs, he's been a director for a while and between him and Tristram, they really are the best Community directors aside from Joe and Anthony Russo (I wish them good luck with their feature film juggernaut Captain America 2: Winter Soldier) and have a good, tight, fluid style. This episode feels like it could have been part of the third season with its pacing, Ken Jeong does a stellar job in this episode, Britta and Shirley get a bit of decent screen time together. I think one of the biggest and most noticeable problems with this season is the underwhelming amount of screen time that Troy, Abed, and Annie have gotten. They get about as much screen time as Dean Pelton in season 2. This episode was good, it didn't really make me laugh, but I was def entertained and I am curious to see what scheme Chang is plotting.""Economics of Marine Biology"" written by Tim Siccardo (Community season 3 'Course Listing Unavailable') and directed by Tricia Brock (Gossip Girl, The Walking Dead), has the gang split up as Annie and Britta help the Dean try and recruit a millionaire (The Whale) to enroll at Greendale so he'll keep pumping money into the school. Troy and Shirley take each other on in P.E.""E"". class as coaches in training, being taught by another cameo from the Upright Citizens Brigade (Ian Roberts). And Jeff and Pierce bond while having a man date with false pretenses. We finally get to see Magnitude who has his signature saying ""Pop Pop"" stolen by the millionaire brat the dean is trying to impress, it's weird to hear Magnitude say things other than ""pop pop"". Abed is noticeably absent from most of the episode, as well as Chang who doesn't make an appearance until the end of the episode. Abed takes up leading the Greendale group the ""Delta Cubes"", and the episode seems like it had a bit of fat trimmed from it. A bit sloppy, some funny moments, pretty decent overall. It seemed slightly more Community-ish than the last episode. The tag was pretty decent too.""Herstory Of Dance"" written by Jack Kukoda (Onion News writer) and directed by Tristram Shapeero (Community) opens with the Dean informing the group of the upcoming Sadie Hawkins dance. Britta of course has to ""Britta"" this scenario by setting up a competing Sophie B. Hawkins dance also to take place in the cafeteria. Abed is set up by Shirley and Annie with dates for both dances and ends up using this as an opportunity to live out a classic sitcom trope by jumping back and forth from date to date. While constantly changing out fits between dates, he meets Rachel (Brie Larson) who is working the coat room. Abed and Rachel make an instant connection, even though it takes Abed the duration of the episode to figure that out. Pierce comes to Britta's aid and helps her not ""Britta"" her dance the way Jeff and the Dean assume she will. I loved this episode, I think this is the best episode of the season so far, it had the most ""Community"" like feel, pacing, writing, character arcs and jokes. This gives me high hopes for the rest of the season, just an all around brilliant episode.""Intro to Felt Surrogacy"" written by Gene Hong (Friends With Benefits) and directed by Community veteran Tristram Shapeero, opens with the gang in the study room in complete silence. Why is everyone quiet and awkward towards each other? We don't know, but the Dean and his bag of hand puppets are going to find out. In the vein of ""Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas"" and ""Digital Estate Planning"" (claymation and 8 bit episodes respectively) this episode is primarily a puppet episode. There are some cool cameos by Sara Bareills whose song ""Gravity"" they used in season 2, and Jason Alexander (Seinfeld). The puppets looked great, the songs were well done also. There were some cool references to Lost, and some funny jokes. Chevy Chase is not in the episode at all, just his voice for his puppet which was most likely recorded before he was fired/quit, so I am curios if he will be in the next episode. To get over their awkward phase, the group realizes after a drug induced night together that they all shared secrets they were ashamed of (none of which any could remember) so now that Shirley has told hers aloud in the study group, they must all divulge their shameful secrets to one another. The tag at the end of the episode was great too because they used my favorite song, Abed's jazz song.""Intro To Knots"" written by Andy Bobrow (Community veteran writer) and Directed by Tristram Shapeero (Community Veteran director) is this seasons Christmas episode. The gang is failing history so Annie takes charge and invites professor Cornwallis (Malcolm McDowell) to their Christmas party at Jeff's apartment. The whole gang is there (minus Chevy again) including Kevin/Ben. Jeff finds out that they didn't actually get an F on their paper but a C- and that Annie is attempting to claim her spot as valedictorian and needs an A to do so. Only she has some competition from Shirley to become this years valedictorian. After discovering this, Jeff bad mouths the professor who over hears Jeff and changes their grade to an F. Best line of the season so far goes to Annie, ""He's F-ing us?"". Kevin/Ben ties up professor Cornwallis and things really get interesting. Abed settles in as John McClane (Bruce Willi's character in Die Hard, arguably the best Christmas movie ever) and watches as Professor Cornwallis attempts to break the group by offering an A grade to whomever unties him. Kevin/Ben makes a secret phone call and it is revealed he is attempting to get the group expelled from Greendale. This episode was great, the dialogue seemed very Harmon-y, it was witty and clever and meta. I'm getting sad that this season is almost over. Just three episodes left it looks like.""Basic Human Anatomy"" written by Dean Pelton himself Jim Rash (The Descendants, The Way, Way Back) and directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller (Modern Family, Happy Endings) opens with the gang (Chevy included) realizing that they have their last group project, as well as Troy and Britta's anniversary. As well as Abed and Troy's anniversary of watching Freaky Friday, when they end up actually switching bodies just like in said movie while holding a copy of Freaky Friday, and like Vice Versa, and 13 Going On 30. This throws a kink into Troy and Britta's anniversary dinner, meanwhile Annie and Shirley are in competition for valedictorian. Danny Pudi and Donald Glover do a great job of playing each other as Abed and Troy in this episode. Dean Pelton tries to recreate this magic with Jeff to no avail, even though the Dean pretends it worked anyhow. Britta thinks Troy maybe pretending to be Abed to avoid their anniversary. While Abed/Troy is out to dinner with Britta at the Mexican restaurant Senor Kevin's, the waiter recognizes Abed and starts an argument about Die Hard being a terrible movie to finish an argument they once had, which helps Britta realize that maybe the two really did switch bodies. Meanwhile Dean does a great impersonation of Jeff, hilarious. Shirley and Annie realize they are possibly going to lose valedictorian to Leonard, of all people. Jeff and Troy/Abed are on the hunt for the copy of Freaky Friday so that Troy and Abed can switch bodies back. There is a big revelation about Troy and Britta's relationship that is revealed which I won't spoil here. The tag for this episode was one of the best of the season so far.""Heroic Origins"" written by Steve Basilone (Happy Endings, Community episode 'Regional Holiday Musical'), Annie Mebane (Happy Endings, Community episode 'Introduction To Finality') and Maggie Bandur (Malcolm In The Middle, Community episode 'Competitive Ecology') and directed by Victor Nelli Jr. (Scrubs, Wilfred) opens with the study group all together (minus Chevy, again) while Abed shows them his Crazy Quilt Of Destiny. Comparing all the groups individual origin stories to something like the movie Unbreakable, Abed claims everyone in the group was destined to meet and go to Greendale. Meanwhile Kevin/Ben makes another phone call to a mysterious person (I won't spoil who it is but I guessed episodes ago and you might have as well) and after meeting with the Dean, Kevin/Ben gets the vital piece of information he needs to shut down Greendale for good. The many flashbacks in this episode were great, Troy back in high school acting how he did in the first few episodes of season 1, Annie looking nerdy with braces, Jeff as a lawyer, Britta being an activist, Shirley trying to spice up her marriage, and Abed trying to thwart people from seeing The Phantom Menace. We even see Abed's dad (Iqbal Theba) who we've not seen in many many episodes, we learn how Magnitude got his catchphrase (which I thought could have been executed a little better, but I still geeked out quite a bit) there's a pretty good cameo from Joe Lo Truglio and some more Phantom Menace bashing. I won't spoil any of the important bits, but there is some closure in this episode, some touching moments and some funny moments as well. I am getting sad that next week is the season finale and possibly the series finale.""Advanced Introduction To Finality"" written by Megan Ganz (writer of Community episode 'Cooperative Calligraphy' and many more) and directed by Tristram Shapeero (Community veteran director of episodes like 'Paradigms of Human Memory' and many more) opens with the gang in the study room (after another great scene with cameo by Joe Lo Truglio) as they Learn that Jeff will be graduating soon. I won't spoil what happens in this episode but it ties in nicely to the season 3 episode 'Remedial Chaos Theory' and finds a way to make paintball cool again. And if this turns out to be the last episode of this series all together, I will be ok with that as it ended on a strong note. I found it to be heartwarming (even though some characters like Chang, Britta and the Dean were a bit under used) and funny and have a nice sense of closure. If this truly is the end, I will be sad.Community maybe be just a show to some people, or just another 30 minute gap of mindless television to take up time while they wait for something else on tv to come on. To me, Community is far more than that. I grew up with shows like Cheers and Wings and I get the sitcom format. But I think where Dan Harmon and the cast and crew of this show succeeded far more than any other 30 minute sitcom in history, was making fully realized characters that make you feel something, care for them and miss them when they're gone. I will miss this show when it's gone, just like I do after every season of Community comes to an end. This will be a show I will talk about, reference and try to get people to watch for years to come. This show is a cult classic, and like most cult classics, it's underappreciated in the time it is produced, but in the years to come, will get the respect it deserves. Here is to ""six seasons and a movie"" and the wonderful cast, crew, writers and directors of this show, as well as Dan Harmon, for creating something that will live on longer than the production of the show itself, for creating Community and all the memories of it that I will carry with me.",5,Different than previous seasons?

1597964,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009LDCW1M,Mark Turner,"[1, 8]","I haven't been a viewer of the series COMMUNITY on NBC at all. For one reason or another I just never got around to watching the show. This is not to say I had an ulterior motive for not watching it. I mean I like star Joel McHale on THE SOUP on E! But I just never got around to watching it. So when the chance to watch this DVD came I figured it was time to start. I'm glad I didn't see the first three seasons now.For those who haven't been watching, like me, the series is about a group of oddball characters at a local community college who band together in a study group. The purpose is to study and get grades good enough to graduate. Instead we find it as more of an excuse to create a dysfunctional family that binds the individuals together.With this being the fourth season it also means that it's senior year for the students in this group, none of which seem to be college student age. This creates all sorts of mixed emotions among them from joy about getting out to fear about facing the real world without the help and support of the group. While both would seem to offer plenty of grain to mill out some laughs, none seem to happen. I mean sure there are things that are meant to be funny but they never quite work.That's sad too because with this likeable group of actors I truly wanted to fall in love with this show. But watching episode after episode I realized halfway through that I had laughed perhaps once and smiled once as well. I couldn't find myself enjoying any of the characters and the jokes were so over the top as to be unfunny. Even the sophomoric jokes weren't funny.Perhaps my favorite episode, if you could call it that, was one where two of the group (room mates and best friends) go to a sci-fi convention which is obviously a take on Dr. Who. The whole geek atmosphere was well played as was bits and pieces of the story. But as I've said, it was hard to find a character to sympathize with, relate to or feel sorry for even. Nice premise, failure to follow through.Perhaps it's a generational thing. In talking with my father he told me there isn't a single comedy on TV these days that he enjoys watching. I've found one or two, but nothing like there were years ago. Even some of the bad ones from the past were better than this one. Better yet DUCK DYNASTY (which I watched for the first time this week) is funnier in one episode than anything I witnessed here in the entire season four.If this sort of humor is one you enjoy more power to you. If you've watched an episode and laughed then perhaps you'll enjoy this entire season. But if you're a little bit pickier about what you watch, pass this one by and look for reruns of some comedy show that was actually funny. There's little doubt that FRASIER or MASH is playing right now on some station.",2,THIS COMEDY DOES NOT PASS,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,2795,"['have', ""n't"", 'been', 'viewer', 'series', 'COMMUNITY', 'NBC', 'one', 'reason', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'show', 'not', 'say', 'had', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'not', 'watching', 'mean', 'star', 'Joel', 'McHale', 'THE', 'SOUP', 'E', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'So', 'when', 'chance', 'watch', 'DVD', 'came', 'figured', 'was', 'time', 'start', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'now.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'watching', 'series', 'group', 'oddball', 'characters', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'who', 'band', 'together', 'study', 'group', 'purpose', 'study', 'get', 'grades', 'good', 'enough', 'graduate', 'Instead', 'find', 'more', 'excuse', 'create', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'individuals', 'together.With', 'being', 'fourth', 'season', 'also', 'senior', 'year', 'students', 'group', 'none', 'seem', 'be', 'college', 'student', 'age', 'sorts', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'joy', 'getting', 'fear', 'facing', 'real', 'world', 'help', 'support', 'group', 'would', 'seem', 'offer', 'plenty', 'grain', 'mill', 'out', 'laughs', 'none', 'seem', 'happen', 'mean', 'sure', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'never', 'quite', 'work.That', 'sad', 'too', 'likeable', 'group', 'actors', 'truly', 'wanted', 'fall', 'love', 'show', 'watching', 'episode', 'episode', 'realized', 'halfway', 'had', 'laughed', 'perhaps', 'once', 'smiled', 'once', 'as', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'enjoying', 'characters', 'jokes', 'were', 'so', 'top', 'be', 'unfunny', 'Even', 'sophomoric', 'jokes', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny.Perhaps', 'favorite', 'episode', 'could', 'call', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'two', 'group', 'room', 'mates', 'best', 'friends', 'go', 'sci-fi', 'convention', 'obviously', 'take', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'whole', 'geek', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'well', 'played', 'was', 'bits', 'pieces', 'story', ""'ve"", 'said', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'character', 'sympathize', 'relate', 'feel', 'sorry', 'even', 'Nice', 'premise', 'failure', 'follow', 'through.Perhaps', 'generational', 'thing', 'talking', 'father', 'told', ""n't"", 'single', 'comedy', 'TV', 'days', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'found', 'one', 'two', 'nothing', 'were', 'years', 'ago', 'Even', 'bad', 'ones', 'past', 'were', 'better', 'one', 'Better', 'yet', 'DUCK', 'DYNASTY', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'week', 'funnier', 'one', 'episode', 'anything', 'witnessed', 'here', 'entire', 'season', 'four.If', 'sort', 'humor', 'one', 'enjoy', 'more', 'power', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'episode', 'laughed', 'then', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'entire', 'season', ""'re"", 'little', 'bit', 'pickier', 'what', 'watch', 'pass', 'one', 'look', 'reruns', 'comedy', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'little', 'doubt', 'FRASIER', 'MASH', 'playing', 'right', 'now', 'station']",N/A

1597967,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B009LDCW1M,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","I agree with the other reviewers who said this season felt off.  The show became less about the school, classes and how the various relationships revolved around those and more about the offbeat &#34;specialty&#34; episodes.  What made the original paintball episode so great was that is came out of nowhere and was still tied to the school story.  Every year after that, they tried to one up what happened before to the point where many episodes became less and less believable.That said, the show still has its entertaining points.  The puppet episode, while it fell within what I described above, was funny, and it would have been perfect had they not followed up with the alternate universe story or had the haunted house episode earlier.  Malcolm McDowell as the cranky history teacher was one thing that worked very well this season, but unfortunately he was not around enough.  The ensemble cast is still very good, but will take a hit into the 5th season with the departures  of Chevy Chase and Donald Glover.  It will be interesting to see where the show goes now that Dan Harmon is back as the show runner.  Hopefully it will return to the season one and two version of the show which were pure genius.",3,"Okay, but not as good as the prior seasons",1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,1212,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'season', 'felt', 'off', 'show', 'became', 'less', 'school', 'classes', 'how', 'various', 'relationships', 'revolved', 'more', 'offbeat', '34', 'specialty', '34', 'episodes', 'What', 'made', 'original', 'paintball', 'episode', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'came', 'nowhere', 'was', 'still', 'tied', 'school', 'story', 'year', 'tried', 'one', 'up', 'what', 'happened', 'point', 'where', 'many', 'episodes', 'became', 'less', 'less', 'believable.That', 'said', 'show', 'still', 'entertaining', 'points', 'puppet', 'episode', 'fell', 'what', 'described', 'was', 'funny', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'had', 'not', 'followed', 'up', 'alternate', 'universe', 'story', 'had', 'haunted', 'house', 'episode', 'earlier', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'cranky', 'history', 'teacher', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'season', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'around', 'enough', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'take', 'hit', '5th', 'season', 'departures', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Donald', 'Glover', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'where', 'show', 'now', 'Dan', 'Harmon', 'back', 'show', 'runner', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'return', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'version', 'show', 'were', 'pure', 'genius']",N/A

1597973,A194GQYVY9HXUP,B009LDCW1M,Ray-Review,"[7, 9]","Community remains to be my favorite TV sitcom in recent years. I love its mix of witty humor, pop culture references, invested and well thought out characters. As some may know already, Dan Harmon, the creator of the show was abruptly dismissed from any more contributions to the show as NBC was unimpressed by the ratings the show received. The backlash from NBC got to Dan Harmon's head and he stepped down from his beloved series before the series would be set up for an inevitable cancellation. To his surprise, the show was picked up for a fourth season but this time NBC would have more creative input.Season 4 was mediocre at best, with hints and splashes of greatness in between. The first 3 seasons had a distinct narrative that never lost its step, even though each season had a different feel (with season 3 being the most experimental). But without the creative input of Dan Harmon, the show simply lost the magic it had during its previous seasons. The jokes were redundant and predictable, there were way too many running gags that felt forced, and the concepts of each episode (while had a lot of potential) fell unbelievably short. The reason why the show fell from grace is not only because of Dan Harmon's absence, but also the departure of his frequent collaborators that left the same time Harmon left. The Russo Brothers directed just about 70% of the past Community episodes and their stylistic choices are incredibly missed when watching Season 4. Some of the writers from past seasons stayed, but again, without Dan Harmon's input, it felt like the writers ideas were based on past material rather than creating entirely fresh ones.Every episode (while had great ideas) rushed everything possible. The conversations between characters felt convoluted as if they weren't having a real conversation at all and the stories quickly pan out to the next scene without letting the viewers absorb everything. There are some episodes that I thoroughly enjoyed. ""Cooperative Escapism in Familial Relationship"" in which Jeff's dad was introduced for the first time was actually well executed, but could've used more refining in spots. ""Intro to Felt Surrogacy"" with the musical puppets was entertaining and fun. And I particularly loved ""Basic Human Anatomy"" where Troy and Abed switched bodies while Troy was internalizing his new love relationship with Britta, and the wonderful Jim Rash who plays the Dean in the show actually wrote that episode. ""Heroic Origins"" was also an interesting episode that showed all of the characters past and how they coincidentally intertwined with one another.But there are a lot of disappointments for community fans that it just becomes depressing to think about. The holiday themed episodes such as the Halloween and Christmas episodes didn't match up to any of the past Community holiday specials. They lacked a message and they lacked originality. The inspector space time convention episode was just a waste of an episode in my opinion. The season finale was decent enough, but not the way I would've imagined Jeff to leave Greendale. There were just way too many filler episodes that lacked the fun and smart writing that past seasons had and its just depressing to know that Dan Harmon could've ended his show with a bang with the 4th season. *Dan Harmon originally wanted Community to run for 4 seasons to parallel the 4 years of college a student would have to attend in order to obtain a degree, in this case Jeff Winger receiving his Bachelors degree and going back to being a lawyer. But thanks to the condensed 13-episode season and lack of belief and cooperation from NBC depriving Dan Harmon to fulfill his goals, we are just forced to live with this mess of a season that could've been great. There were so many storylines that were taken away from Dan Harmon to write himself such as Jeff meeting his dad, the graduation of Jeff, the relationship between Troy and Britta and even the direction of Chang's character that Dan Harmon could've executed way better; not to mention better episodes in general.Optimistically there will be a Season 5 and Dan Harmon has returned to being the front show-runner again. However Chevy Chase who played Pierce will not be returning to the show, and recently announced, Donald Glover who plays Troy (arguably my favorite character on the show) will have a limited role of only 5 episodes.... With so much going against it, hopefully Dan Harmon could do some damage control and revitalize his show back to its glory days and at least give Community fans something to look forward to.",3,A
