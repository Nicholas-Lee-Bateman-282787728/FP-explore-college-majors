We had discovered the cure for polio, cholera, diphtheria.  We were sure we could fight any other diseases that came our way.We were wrong.This strain struck our soldiers at Fort Riley toward the end of WWI.  Soldiers were falling ill fast from this virus and doctors had no idea what was killing off our troops.  We had troops to send overseas on large, crowded troop transporters, where the air-borne virus would easily spread and infect an entire carrier in a few days.  This pandemic killed more Americans than all our wars in the 20th century and over 30 million world-wide, thanks to developing aircraft transportation used for the war effort.  Almost every family on the eastern seaboard, especially Philadelphia, was affected. People were literally dropping dead in the streets. Scientists didn't have powerful enough microscopes yet to detect this virus, and thus had no way to develop an anti-virus for this strain.  The electron-microscope had not been invented yet.Interviews with survivors, elderly who lost family members or childhood friends, scientists are interviewed for this poignant production.  Scenes of white curtains blowing in gentle window breezes add a touch of suspense to this video; one feels how traumatic the 1918 flu strain was to everyone alive at the time.  And this video haunts your brain for days later.So why, if this was such a traumatic event, did this event fall out of our collective conscienceness?  Because, as one scientist explains, this was so traumatic an event that people would prefer to forget about it, although it lingers in the back of everyone's mind.Do NOT watch this video if you are feeling sick, especially if you have bronchial problems.

For one thing, I thought that the disease originated in Europe and was spread in the United States after the Armistice, but it would seem as if the opposite is the case: troops had been exposed to the virus in the U.S. prior to deploying to Europe... with devastating effect. Influenza not only caused more casualties than combat deaths among Americans but also spread to the British, French and, yes, German armies.  Eventually it would spread all across Europe (as an aside, my understanding is that Russia was particularly hard-hit).The Army camps were hit at first in the U.S., even as battles continued to rage in Europe. Then it began to infect the civilian population. Spread by airborne contact, it overwhelmed many of the government agencies meant to contain it. Medical science could do nothing, despite all the wonderful strides it had made over the recent decades.This film is very well done, with interviews of some survivors (all of whom were children at the time) and modern scientists. Some excellent contemporary film footage and period photographs make the production very educational and entertaining as well. Also, excerpts read of some of the people who caught the disease or were involved in the desperate struggle to contain it really brings this topic to life.I can't rate this highly enough.",5,Outbreak,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,1380,"['had', 'misconceptions', 'Great', 'Flu', 'Outbreak', '1918', 'one', 'thing', 'thought', 'disease', 'originated', 'Europe', 'was', 'spread', 'United', 'States', 'Armistice', 'would', 'seem', 'opposite', 'case', 'troops', 'had', 'been', 'exposed', 'virus', 'U.S.', 'prior', 'deploying', 'Europe', 'devastating', 'effect', 'Influenza', 'not', 'only', 'caused', 'more', 'casualties', 'combat', 'deaths', 'Americans', 'also', 'spread', 'British', 'French', 'yes', 'German', 'armies', 'Eventually', 'would', 'spread', 'Europe', 'aside', 'understanding', 'Russia', 'was', 'particularly', 'hard-hit', '.The', 'Army', 'camps', 'were', 'hit', 'first', 'U.S.', 'even', 'battles', 'continued', 'rage', 'Europe', 'Then', 'began', 'infect', 'civilian', 'population', 'Spread', 'airborne', 'contact', 'overwhelmed', 'many', 'government', 'agencies', 'meant', 'contain', 'Medical', 'science', 'could', 'do', 'nothing', 'wonderful', 'strides', 'had', 'made', 'recent', 'decades.This', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'whom', 'were', 'children', 'time', 'modern', 'scientists', 'excellent', 'contemporary', 'film', 'footage', 'period', 'photographs', 'make', 'production', 'very', 'educational', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'Also', 'excerpts', 'read', 'people', 'who', 'caught', 'disease', 'were', 'involved', 'desperate', 'struggle', 'contain', 'really', 'topic', 'life.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rate', 'highly', 'enough']",Influenza 1918: The American Experience VHS
500291,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B00000FELM,Jeffery Mingo,"[25, 32]","I did relatively well in high school American history and yet I never heard of this national crisis.  I guess World War I wasn't the only big deal of the 1910s.  I am glad to see that the American Experience series not only covers great names, wars, and transportational feats, but also health concerns.I recall that Charlie Chaplin's sweetheart died in a flu epidemic in Britain, but I didn't know the problem started in the United States.  (If our revolution and our stock market crash can have global effects, I guess I should not be surprised.)  It's easy to think of the bubonic plague as the world's only human international die-off.  However, this film shows that it happened in the recent past too.  This shows that savage diseases can be spread widely, unlike the localization of Ebola or SARS.  I learned that the Titanic's sinking humbled early 20th-century modernists, but this flu outbreak must have been the same way.  Nowadays, incurable diseases are usually associated with stigmatized groups.  In contrast, this work clearly points to American soldiers, a well-respected group, as the cause of the spread.This work proved the problem was cross-regional.  This is not example of something on the East Coast being equated with all of America.  The epidemic hit Philadelphia, but San Francisco, Nebraska, and the Dakotas as well.  This work starts with interviewees waxing nostalgic about the pre-flu period.  I thought it was offensive to think of a Jim Crow time as wonderful.  However, this work compensates by interviewing an African-American witness to the crisis and a person recalling how a Native American group was affected.In ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" one character says, ""The interesting thing about wars is that you never know who will survive and who will not.""  This work revealed the same is true in epidemics.  It was a bit anti-climactic how this crisis was resolved, but history doesn't usually have spectacular conclusions.  After the bubonic plague, Europeans stopped killing cats and started killing mice.  Because of AIDS, many are now practicing safer sex and cleaning drug needles.  This documentary doesn't suggest that public health changed at all due to the flu.  I'm surprised by that.I usually don't care for scientific matters, but this work was informative and really has my wheels spinning.",4,a forgotten tragedy,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,2333,"['did', 'relatively', 'well', 'high', 'school', 'American', 'history', 'yet', 'never', 'heard', 'national', 'crisis', 'guess', 'World', 'War', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'big', 'deal', '1910s', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'American', 'Experience', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'names', 'wars', 'transportational', 'feats', 'also', 'health', 'concerns.I', 'recall', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'sweetheart', 'died', 'flu', 'epidemic', 'Britain', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'problem', 'started', 'United', 'States', 'revolution', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', 'can', 'have', 'global', 'effects', 'guess', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'easy', 'think', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'world', 'only', 'human', 'international', 'die-off', 'However', 'film', 'happened', 'recent', 'past', 'too', 'savage', 'diseases', 'can', 'be', 'spread', 'widely', 'localization', 'Ebola', 'SARS', 'learned', 'Titanic', 'sinking', 'humbled', 'early', '20th-century', 'modernists', 'flu', 'outbreak', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'way', 'Nowadays', 'incurable', 'diseases', 'are', 'usually', 'associated', 'stigmatized', 'groups', 'contrast', 'work', 'clearly', 'points', 'American', 'soldiers', 'well-respected', 'group', 'cause', 'spread.This', 'work', 'proved', 'problem', 'was', 'cross-regional', 'not', 'example', 'something', 'East', 'Coast', 'being', 'equated', 'America', 'epidemic', 'hit', 'Philadelphia', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Nebraska', 'Dakotas', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'interviewees', 'waxing', 'nostalgic', 'pre-flu', 'period', 'thought', 'was', 'offensive', 'think', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'time', 'wonderful', 'However', 'work', 'interviewing', 'African-American', 'witness', 'crisis', 'person', 'recalling', 'how', 'Native', 'American', 'group', 'was', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'one', 'character', 'interesting', 'thing', 'wars', 'never', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'revealed', 'same', 'true', 'epidemics', 'was', 'bit', 'anti-climactic', 'how', 'crisis', 'was', 'resolved', 'history', ""n't"", 'usually', 'have', 'spectacular', 'conclusions', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'Europeans', 'stopped', 'killing', 'cats', 'started', 'killing', 'mice', 'AIDS', 'many', 'are', 'now', 'practicing', 'safer', 'sex', 'cleaning', 'drug', 'needles', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'public', 'health', 'changed', 'due', 'flu', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'that.I', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'scientific', 'matters', 'work', 'was', 'informative', 'really', 'wheels', 'spinning']",Influenza 1918: The American Experience VHS

The 1918 flu first appeared at Ft. Riley, Kansas in March. About 100 were hospitalized the first day, and the toll rose from there. Then, almost as suddenly as it first appeared, the flu disappeared, only to reappear in Europe when the U.S. began sending soldiers there for WWI. Experts believe that the virus had mutated by then, and was more deadly.In the U.S., soldiers carried it from base to base. Death was common within hours. War activities (parades, increased manufacturing, and the movement of troops) acerbated its spread. Quarantines were tried, only to be undermined by mailmen and other transporters. Vaccines were tried, but the flu was virus-caused, not from germs.

There is a lot to be told in a short amount of time. If you want true in-depth information, then I recommend a book. However if you want a visual, and seeing people who lived through it, then this is the one you want.This documentary interviews several living survivors, which of course were children at the time of the pandemic. They share their memories, the loss of their family and friends, as well as their pain. There are photographs of overcrowded hospitals, reminiscent of the hospital scene in Gone With the Wind.One adult surviving victim recorded her tribulation and her writings describe the absolute pain and suffering she went through. I am a nurse and have worked for 23 years. She shared something that I had never even heard of, in all of those years. I had to look it up. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say she went through 'hell on earth'.I do want to make a correction though. One reviewer wrote how the second wave was not at all mentioned, in this episode. That is incorrect because it most definitely was. It's important for me to say that because I'd hate for anyone to ignore this, thinking that were true. Perhaps the reviewer saw another documentary and confused it with this one (there is no verified purchase, so that seems likely).

Sherwin,"[4, 4]","This documentary gives us an excellent account of the 1918 flu epidemic that came upon us quite mysteriously and always eluded the best efforts of medicine and science to cure people afflicted with it or inoculate those who were still well. The archival footage and the still photos from that era are very, very good; and the interviews with now elderly survivors of the epidemic are so well done that they truly bring this horrible nightmare to vivid life in all its grotesqueness. The story moves along at a very good pace and I was never bored; although this only lasts one hour, they always made it a very human portrayal of the problem and it never felt rushed. The script for the narrators was well written, too.When the film starts, we see America as it was not too long after the turn of the century; we were a young nation already emerging as a world leader. Our sense of strength and invulnerability was shattered when the flu came upon us seemingly out of nowhere. The film discusses one possibility that the flu epidemic may have started with a few military soldiers in Kansas; but to this day they're not completely certain of that. What we do know is that this strain of the flu killed people who were thought to be most resistant to flu--young people in their 20s although many others, of course, got the flu and did not survive. We also see the flu as it impacted on both sides fighting the First World War in Europe (especially France) and the story is rather grim.Of course, there's much, much more to this story but I will stop here; I don't want to spoil it for you.The DVD comes with a link to a teacher's guide in the form of a PDF file; you can access this from a DVD-ROM drive. There's also a link to the PBS website.Overall, this fine documentary tells the story of a horror that caused the uncontrollable deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.
