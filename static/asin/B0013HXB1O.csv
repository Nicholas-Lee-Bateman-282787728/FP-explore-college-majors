1142606,A1EIFNR4YR4TY8,B0013HXB1O,"A. Drake ""Yoga fan""","[6, 6]","Jennifer Lynns Flow Yoga is definitely up there with Shiva Rea's, yoga shakti, in terms of teaching callibre and quality of practice.I thought the sections on 'why we do yoga' and the technical workshop were excellent - very clear and specific.Jennifers style is very down to earth, motivating, supportive, encouraging, and gentle.  She allows you to feel that perhaps you could go a little further, just to try things and that its okay if you can't quite do it, because its all part of the yoga process.I really feel that with this practice I was able to go much further and to begin to appreciate some of the more phillosopical aspects of yoga.  Due to the great technical instruction I am now able to attempt some of the more advanced moves.",5,Excellent Yoga Dvd,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,744,"['Jennifer', 'Lynns', 'Flow', 'Yoga', 'definitely', 'there', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'yoga', 'shakti', 'terms', 'teaching', 'callibre', 'quality', 'practice.I', 'thought', 'sections', 'do', 'yoga', 'technical', 'workshop', 'were', 'excellent', 'very', 'clear', 'specific.Jennifers', 'style', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'motivating', 'supportive', 'encouraging', 'gentle', 'feel', 'perhaps', 'could', 'go', 'little', 'further', 'just', 'try', 'things', 'okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'part', 'yoga', 'process.I', 'really', 'feel', 'practice', 'was', 'able', 'go', 'much', 'further', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'more', 'phillosopical', 'aspects', 'yoga', 'Due', 'great', 'technical', 'instruction', 'am', 'now', 'able', 'attempt', 'more', 'advanced', 'moves']",Flow Yoga with Jennifer Lynn

I was expecting though that the beginners flow was outdoors, but instead it was indoors in a studio. Jennifer shows the sequence with one more person. The beginners, I would say it's more like an beginners/intermediate level. It was perfect for me! This one has become one of my favorite yoga dvds!!I liked it way more than expected!!!!Thanks Jennifer from bringing yoga to my home :o)",5,Great Flow!!!,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,516,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'practice', 'was', 'great', 'flow', 'liked', 'Jennifer', 'voice', 'teaching', 'manners', 'be', 'down', 'earth', 'was', 'expecting', 'beginners', 'flow', 'was', 'outdoors', 'instead', 'was', 'indoors', 'studio', 'Jennifer', 'sequence', 'one', 'more', 'person', 'beginners', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'beginners/intermediate', 'level', 'was', 'perfect', 'one', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'liked', 'way', 'more', 'expected', 'Thanks', 'Jennifer', 'bringing', 'yoga', 'home', 'o']",Flow Yoga with Jennifer Lynn
1142608,A3HLVDN00UGDQ0,B0013HXB1O,Compassionate Warrior,"[36, 36]","This is an awesome power, flow yoga practice! Well organized, and professionally produced. The DVD has 4 main chapters an Introduction, Beginner's Flow (45 minutes) with 10 chapter segments, Intermediate Advanced Flow (75 minutes) with 4 sections called ""Quarters"" that is further broken down into 4 segments to choose from and and Alignment Principles section.In the Intro section Jennifer begins with an inspiring message (this is usually the section of a DVD I usually skip but for some reason it flipped to it and I listened for a change and it was a delight). She reminds us that  living is a life of balance between purposeful, balanced, responsible living in union with joyful, passionate, exuberant living. Even though she doesn't mention God, it still reminded me that that's exactly the life God intends and wants for all of us.I loved her 75 minute Intermediate/Advanced flow! The setting is both inside a studio and outside in a grassy park with scenes switching gently back and forth. It's shot in a very professional way with great camera work. She leads with a number of students with an amazing voiceover and great music in the background. It is a challenging power flow with an almost dancelike flowing feel to it especially in the beginning (her transitions move in and out of poses fluidly and beautifully). There will also be a good enough amount of vinyasa's (chatarunga, updog, downdog) to get the blood pumping and the body warm. Her incredible voice over has amazing cueing and is calming, with great direction while also inpiring, for example,  ""welcome challenge as you reach up, surrender to grace bowing in, inhale readiness look forward, exhale poise step back or float back""(yet funny enough without coming off as cheesy or sappy). None of her awesome voiceover slows down the flow in any way. She also likes to throw in some great handbalancing and inverted poses throughout, which I love (Quarter section 1: side crow, crow; Quarter section 2: one-legged crow or crane; Quarter section 3: sage 2 pose, side plank to wheel, dolphin to forarm stand, headstand; Quarter section 4: one-legged sage 1 to tripod headstand).Overall this is an amazing practice and worth every 5 stars!! She's up there with the best of them: Eoin Finn, Bryan Kest (1st dvd's), Shiva Rae, Inhale yoga (Oxygen TV, funky music Steve Ross), Mark Blanchard, Baron Baptiste, Donna Helm-Yost (Flow and Yin), Yoga Radiance, Yogatopia, MTV Power Yoga, Power Yoga for Strength & Endurance, XFlowsion, etc.",5,Awesome Flow!!,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,2502,"['awesome', 'power', 'flow', 'yoga', 'practice', 'Well', 'organized', 'professionally', 'produced', 'DVD', '4', 'main', 'chapters', 'Introduction', 'Beginner', 'Flow', '45', 'minutes', '10', 'chapter', 'segments', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced', 'Flow', '75', 'minutes', '4', 'sections', 'called', 'Quarters', 'further', 'broken', 'down', '4', 'segments', 'choose', 'Alignment', 'Principles', 'Intro', 'section', 'Jennifer', 'inspiring', 'message', 'usually', 'section', 'DVD', 'usually', 'skip', 'reason', 'flipped', 'listened', 'change', 'was', 'delight', 'living', 'life', 'balance', 'purposeful', 'balanced', 'responsible', 'living', 'union', 'joyful', 'passionate', 'exuberant', 'living', 'Even', ""n't"", 'mention', 'God', 'still', 'reminded', 'exactly', 'life', 'God', 'us.I', 'loved', '75', 'minute', 'Intermediate/Advanced', 'flow', 'setting', 'studio', 'outside', 'grassy', 'park', 'scenes', 'switching', 'gently', 'back', 'forth', 'shot', 'very', 'professional', 'way', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'number', 'students', 'amazing', 'voiceover', 'great', 'music', 'background', 'challenging', 'power', 'flow', 'almost', 'dancelike', 'flowing', 'feel', 'especially', 'beginning', 'transitions', 'move', 'poses', 'fluidly', 'beautifully', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'amount', 'vinyasa', 'chatarunga', 'updog', 'downdog', 'get', 'blood', 'pumping', 'body', 'warm', 'incredible', 'voice', 'amazing', 'cueing', 'calming', 'great', 'direction', 'also', 'inpiring', 'example', 'welcome', 'challenge', 'reach', 'up', 'surrender', 'grace', 'bowing', 'inhale', 'readiness', 'look', 'forward', 'exhale', 'poise', 'step', 'back', 'float', 'back', 'yet', 'funny', 'enough', 'coming', 'off', 'cheesy', 'sappy', 'None', 'awesome', 'voiceover', 'down', 'flow', 'way', 'also', 'throw', 'great', 'handbalancing', 'inverted', 'poses', 'love', 'Quarter', 'section', '1', 'side', 'crow', 'crow', 'Quarter', 'section', '2', 'one-legged', 'crow', 'crane', 'Quarter', 'section', '3', 'sage', '2', 'pose', 'side', 'plank', 'wheel', 'dolphin', 'forarm', 'stand', 'headstand', 'Quarter', 'section', '4', 'one-legged', 'sage', '1', 'tripod', 'headstand', '.Overall', 'amazing', 'practice', 'worth', '5', 'stars', 'there', 'best', 'Eoin', 'Finn', 'Bryan', 'Kest', '1st', 'dvd', 'Shiva', 'Rae', 'Inhale', 'yoga', 'Oxygen', 'TV', 'funky', 'music', 'Steve', 'Ross', 'Mark', 'Blanchard', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'Donna', 'Helm-Yost', 'Flow', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'Radiance', 'Yogatopia', 'MTV', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Strength', 'Endurance', 'XFlowsion', 'etc']",Flow Yoga with Jennifer Lynn
1142609,AE4TXP7RWOYX2,B0013HXB1O,"Dani Montlake ""Devora""","[3, 3]","This is my favorite yoga routine. It is really challenging and varied, with lots of interesting sequences. There are a lot of challenging backbends, strength poses, and forearm stands. You will not master this disc quickly!  There is a beginner's routine (which I have never done), a 75 minute intermediate routine, and some pose commentary, etc.I see that some have commented that the photography is not so professional. OK. It's true. They filmed the routine both indoors and outdoors and kind of interlaced them a bit. The outdoor shots are lousy, but the indoor ones are OK. Jenifer is teaching a class and you get to see how many of her students can't do the poses. However, I would say SO WHAT about the mediocre filming, because this is a great, challenging workout!  I have a lot of discs, and mostly, I don't use them because they are all far too easy. This disc is not too easy, and there is a lot of interesting variety and poses and stretches that I have not seen elsewhere.But what makes this disc super special is Jennifer's beautiful commentary. It is both instructive and deep, and geared for western minds, so you won't hear too much about the sun--it's more about personal growth.",5,An amazing and challenging yoga workout,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,1198,"['favorite', 'yoga', 'routine', 'really', 'challenging', 'varied', 'lots', 'interesting', 'sequences', 'are', 'lot', 'challenging', 'backbends', 'strength', 'poses', 'forearm', 'stands', 'will', 'not', 'master', 'disc', 'quickly', 'beginner', 'routine', 'have', 'never', 'done', '75', 'minute', 'intermediate', 'routine', 'pose', 'commentary', 'see', 'have', 'commented', 'photography', 'not', 'so', 'professional', 'OK', 'true', 'filmed', 'routine', 'indoors', 'outdoors', 'kind', 'interlaced', 'bit', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'are', 'lousy', 'indoor', 'ones', 'are', 'OK.', 'Jenifer', 'teaching', 'class', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'students', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'poses', 'However', 'would', 'say', 'SO', 'WHAT', 'mediocre', 'filming', 'great', 'challenging', 'workout', 'have', 'lot', 'discs', 'mostly', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'disc', 'not', 'too', 'easy', 'lot', 'interesting', 'variety', 'poses', 'stretches', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'elsewhere.But', 'what', 'disc', 'super', 'special', 'Jennifer', 'beautiful', 'commentary', 'instructive', 'deep', 'geared', 'western', 'minds', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'too', 'much', 'sun', 'more', 'personal', 'growth']",Flow Yoga with Jennifer Lynn
1142610,AWMU4C4CH21TE,B0013HXB1O,YogaGirl,"[4, 4]","I just finished doing this dvd this morning and I loved the flow. I gave it 4 stars for the bad production quality.What I love about Jennifer's dvd is that she gets you into poses you thought you could never do. The stretching is sublime!  This is the beauty of anusara yoga. I haven't done flow yoga in years so the intermediate flow was super challenging to me.  I watched the beginning flow and there is such a wide gap between the beginning flow and the intermediate flow, that if you are a complete novice, I don't know how you bridge the gap.  Bi-weekly live classes, I suppose.  Jennifer's cuing is impecable.  I loved seeing other people in the class with varying abilities.  Definitely a new favorite yoga dvd.My only major complaint is that the production quality sucks.  The picture was grainy; the long pauses between quarters was annoying and the 3rd time I used the dvd it froze and I had to re-start the dvd.  I cleaned my player and I hope that the freezing doesn't happen again.  Sometimes in the replication process, the dvd degrades with each copying process, expecially when inexpensive media is used. Not saying that this is the case.  But I see that another reviewer's dvd froze too.By the way, the menu, OMG!  You have the chapter titles listed on the top, pictures in the middle and play listed on the bottom.  In order to get the right chapter you have to get chapter, picture and play highlighted.  It took me a few minutes playing with my remote to get that figured out.  For her next dvd, I suggest that she make the menu simpler.  She has so much to offer as a teacher, and these flaws are distracting.Overall, I loved the content.  The pace was good.  She is talky so be forewarned!! Lots of spiritual metaphors, but I am used to that as my yoga background is kundalini yoga.  Great anusara yoga class inspite of the quality!UPDATE:  I just did the beginners class and it is wonderful!  This morning I felt like I needed an easy yoga class and this is it.  Half sun salutes, tree, wide angle forward bend, heros pose and shoulder stretch, cobra, locust, to name a few.  45 minutes of bliss with a sublime closing pose of supported backbend lying over 2 blocks and words of wisdom.  Please Jennifer make another anusara dvd soon.",4,Great Class.
