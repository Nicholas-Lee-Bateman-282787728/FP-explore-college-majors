One part mc, dj, director, and psalmist, Kirk wrote every song and produced the all-out flawless precision of the musical concept of this powerful album. Backed with a supercharged band, orchestra, 30-something member choral ensemble, dance team, and dj in the mix, every song's portrayal and message helped move the audience. The best songs on the album are the jumpy ""Hosanna,"" ""He Reigns (the medley),"" and the beautifully arranged ballad, ""Don't Cry,"" with a wonderfully executed piano accompaniment by Richard Smallwood. The entire album as a whole has wonderful structure and balanced substance. The sound quality was extraordinary and the venue was a perfect place to proclaim his ""Rebirth."" In Texas, at the lively Lakewood Church in Houston, only 50 miles away from Fort Worth, his hometown. Nice concept.",5,Flawless.,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,900,"['Once', 'again', 'Kirk', 'Franklin', 'epitome', 'what', 'praise', 'worship', 'leader', 'should', 'be', 'One', 'part', 'mc', 'dj', 'director', 'psalmist', 'Kirk', 'wrote', 'song', 'produced', 'all-out', 'flawless', 'precision', 'musical', 'concept', 'powerful', 'album', 'Backed', 'supercharged', 'band', 'orchestra', '30-something', 'member', 'choral', 'ensemble', 'dance', 'team', 'dj', 'mix', 'song', 'portrayal', 'message', 'helped', 'move', 'audience', 'best', 'songs', 'album', 'are', 'jumpy', 'Hosanna', 'Reigns', 'medley', 'beautifully', 'arranged', 'ballad', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'wonderfully', 'executed', 'piano', 'accompaniment', 'Richard', 'Smallwood', 'entire', 'album', 'whole', 'wonderful', 'structure', 'balanced', 'substance', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'venue', 'was', 'perfect', 'place', 'proclaim', 'Rebirth', 'Texas', 'lively', 'Lakewood', 'Church', 'Houston', 'only', '50', 'miles', 'away', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'hometown', 'Nice', 'concept']",N/A

It's as if I had not heard the CD before. The DVD just let's you experience the anointing that was present during the recording. Also, unlike the Commissioned Reunion DVD this DVD had behind the scenes looks. Even letting us know that Shirley Caesar is a Lakers' fan. Of course the songs were great and I was able to witness the unique atmosphere of this project. Not to mention that Kirk Franklin is a complete cut-up. He ran around the stage and jumped up and down all night. The singers were awesome, the band played magnificently, and it's always nice when you get a chance to capture the emotion behind the singing. It just makes you get into it. This is a great buy. If you have the CD and you love the CD, the DVD just puts it over the top!

Let me tell you the best song is Hosanna, and I mean the best anointed praise I have ever heard and I am into praise and worship music. He is truly gifted. There is also a song called 911 with Bishop Jakes, please buy this CD. You will not find another CD like this and all his CD's are anointed.Let me tell you always when G-d has someone he wishes to use as a vessel of honour- they want to stop you. Be encouraged my brothers and sisters in Christ. You are not alone.
