Besides the good performances by Ralph Richardson and Gina Lollobrigida, Connery dominates the movie looking and often acting like James Bond. That's not a dig, but rather an observation that Connery's character overlaps with Bond in many ways: fancy, tailored suits and tuxedos, similar treatment of women, affinity for fine food and locations, driving expensive sports cars, and delivering lines with that baritone voice. The villain angle gives Connery something to play differently than Bond, and it's one of his better performances outside of Bond.This movie must have been filmed in between ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Marnie"". Connery never looked better than the period between '62 and '65. As you watch him in this movie, it's stunning to compare how much he aged by 1971 in ""Diamonds are Forever"" just seven years later. It's a pleasure watching Connery in his prime.As for this movie, itself, it's a pretty good thriller. It moves slowly by today's standards, but if you keep the timeframe it was made in mind, it's not a bad way to spend two hours. The locations are beautiful and the classical score stands up over time, since it's, well, classical.  I was surprised how good it is despite being absent from cable and video for so many years.
