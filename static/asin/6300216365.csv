220949,A20IIR0422G3A5,6300216365,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[24, 30]","`Play It Again, Sam', based on a stage play by Woody Alan is high among those movies one cites when you tick off the Woodman's `early, funny' movies. It should probably be noted that this is not a typical Allen movie in that he did not direct, although it is an excellent bridge, with the performances of Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts to his most famous movie, `Annie Hall' and others he did with Keaton around this time.Just before viewing the DVD of this movie, I watched `Meet the Fockers' and found this very recent film with its stellar cast, to be less funny and more contrived than the little classic `Play It Again, Sam'. Even hours of extras on the Fockers' DVD cannot make up for the almost total lack of rewatchability in the film.I have not watched `Play It Again, Sam' for some time, although I believe I have probably seen it at least three times before, yet I was still surprised at discovering new things about the movie. For starters, I found at least two pieces of business that I swear were copied directly into scenes of `Animal House'. Since `Animal House' is a great comedy that easily stands on its own merits, I don't begrudge the borrowing. Another observation I had with this movie was how much visual comedy there was going on. None of it was the kind of over the top long scenes done by W. C. Fields, but it definitely contributed a lot to the interest of the movie. A third new observation was the fact that `Play It Again, Sam' begins with a clip from the final scene of `Casablanca' and ends with the characters of `Play It Again, Sam' reenacting that same `Casablanca' scene. This fact stood out so strongly for me this time around since I just got finished seeing exactly the same device used in Allen's `Stardust Memories'. This is yet another case where `Stardust Memories' is quoting from Allen's other pictures. This really makes me wonder how many of Allen's films begin with a clip from some other movie.The best things about really great movies is that you can find problems with them without that activity's spoiling your appreciation of the movie. In fact, richly produced films simply add to your pleasure by offering an object of analysis and comparison with other movies. I feel absolutely no urge to analyze `Meet the Fockers' other than appreciate the performances of Hoffman and Streisand and wish DeNiro would go back to doing Marty Scorsese gangster movies.The name of this movie, `Play It Again, Sam', has probably contributed its share to the myth that this is a direct quote from `Casablanca'. As most know, Rick never actually says these four words together in the `Casablanca' script. This is only fitting, because the Bogart character dreamed up by the Allen character behaves like neither Humphrey Bogart nor Rick Blaine, his character in `Casablanca'. Allen's fictional Bogart is a construct of Allen's imagination, possibly based on Bogart in `The Maltese Falcon', but even Sam Spade would probably have more respect for women than the spectral trenchcoat with Bogart's name in `Play It Again, Sam'. My biggest question is whether this skewing of the Bogart persona was intentional and part of the interest of the film, or was he just molding things to fit his premise.While the movie is not pure Woody, it is a very important part of his body of work and an important early demonstration of how good he was with visual humor.Now all I have to do is figure out the reason for the business of the Allen character's sliding the two fried eggs from a plate back into a skillet. Seems to be connected in some way to his total inability to cook.",5,Very Quotable and very Rewatchable movie.

220964,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300216365,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","I have a special fondness for this lightweight 1972 romantic comedy from the pen of Woody Allen. Directed surprisingly not by Allen but by the more studio-friendly Herbert Ross, it represents the noteworthy first pairing of Allen and Diane Keaton, and the combination of their unerring chemistry and Allen's clever, often hilarious script makes for great viewing after all these years. Allen plays his usual nebbish character, this time a film critic named Allan Felix, whose free-spirit wife leaves him for being a boring observer of life. He seeks solace from best friends Dick and Linda Christie, he a workaholic stockbroker and she a model. They set him up on a series of hysterically bad blind dates, which Allen plays out with physical abandon. Whether inadvertently flinging an album across the room or swinging spastically at a discotheque, he is a master of slapstick, a gift he has too rarely displayed since. Eventually, the inevitable happens when Linda and Allan fall in love.What makes the predictable premise unique is the way Allen celebrates classic movies, mainly Warner Brothers melodramas, and has the characters reenact famous scenes to move the story along. He even has the spirit of Humphrey Bogart act as his advisor when he faces romantic complications since Bogie always knew how to treat his women or so we all seem to recall. It's all deftly acted by an expert cast. Beyond Allen, Keaton shows the first signs of her unmatched comic prowess as Linda, though for the most part, she is called upon merely to be the conflicted leading lady (with fake eyelashes, no less). Tony Roberts, another Allen favorite, especially as the best friend, plays Dick in his typically sharp manner. Jerry Lacy does a reasonably good impersonation of Bogie, and the long missing Susan Anspach plays Allen's wife with spacey vitriol.While the film obviously lacks the emotional depth and improvisational style of Allen's later films (the obvious comparison being 1977's ""Annie Hall"" starring the same three leads), it still has a quaint charm to go with its romantic comedy conventionality. Its risk-averse nature is what makes this film an invaluable addition to Allen's filmography, as it shows how far he has come as a film auteur. Credit should also be given to Ross for bringing Allen's picture-perfect screenplay to life and also to cinematographer Owen Roizman for capturing the picturesque San Francisco locations while evoking classic Hollywood in key scenes.

Allen wrote the screenplay based on his Broadway play and he starred as Allan, a neurotic movie buff who writes the film reviews (what else?). Allan not just loves movies; he lives in the movies' world and constantly takes advices on how to get the girls from the legendary hero of his all time favorite movie ""Casablanca"", Humphrey Bogart's Rick. I am not a fan of ""Casablanca"" at all but if my favorite Artist is so much in love with it, maybe I should give it another try.When Allan's wife Nancy leaves him, his best friend Dick (Tony Roberts) and his lovely wife Linda (Diane Keaton) try to fix him up with several eligible pretty young ladies. Very typically for Woody's characters, he is a total failure with them.

I loved the whole premise of the neurotic Allen Felix (Woody Allen), when suddenly dumped by his wife, tries to adopt the tactics of his Casablanca film hero, Humphrey Bogart, using Bogie's ""tough"" no-nonsense approach, to date new women.  He enlists the help of his married friends (Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton), to set him up with eligible women, and in the process finds himself falling for his best friend's married wife.  Woody Allen expresses many of the insecurities that many men have in the dating scene.  Woody Allen's character is the exact polar opposite of Bogie, and this makes it all the more fun to watch him take ""Bogart's"" advice and try to implement it. I was laughing out loud many times throughout the film.  Very enjoyable. The actor who imitates Bogart is superb in his role.  His impression of Bogie is astounding.I have watched this movie with people who are much younger than me, and they do not have as favorable a response to it as I do.

He is the author of Woody Allen: A Biography, as well as bios on Humphrey Bogart and Paul Newman. David Kipen, book critic for the San Francisco Chronicle moderated the program.In answer to an audience member's question during the Q&A; session, Lax said that Woody Allen has never made a bad film. I agree with this comment because I've enjoyed most of Allen's films. The ones I haven't been too fond of have plenty of redeeming qualities in them anyway. Even the heavy-handed Interiors had a lot to recommend it, at least for true movie buffs. Play It Again Sam was one of the funniest and most underrated Woody Allen film I have ever seen.Based on a play written by Woody Allen in 1968 and directed by Herbert Ross (who also directed film versions of Neil Simon plays back in the 70's), the film concerns a mild-mannered film critic named Allan Felix, played by Allen, who is dumped by his wife (Susan Anspach). What a gorgeous woman like her was doing with a guy like Allan Felix is beyond me, but for some reason, Allen (was Woody playing himself?)  tends to pair himself up with a slew of gorgeous females in almost all his films.Felix's apartment is a shrine to Humphrey Bogart and it is none other than Bogey himself who counsels him in the romance department since his ego is crushed. Felix's best friend Dick (Tony Roberts) and his wife Linda (Diane Keaton) also try to find a woman for him by setting him up on one disastrous date after another. When Felix finds himself falling for Linda, a series of hilarious complications take place as he is guided by Bogey on what to do. This results in a funny yet touching reworking of the Casablanca ending with Linda even donning the Ingrid Bergman hat and Felix giving her the ""Maybe Not Today, Maybe Not Tomorrow"" speech, after which he replies, ""It's from Casablanca. I've been waiting my whole life to say that.""Play It Again Sam was the first screen pairing of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, who would go on to star in over a handful of films together. All four lead actors, including Tony Roberts and Jerry Lacy, who does a perfect Bogart, were in the stage play together. It is interesting to note that, according to Lax, the actors knew which lines would get the most laughs because they performed the play on stage so often, that they slightly paused before continuing, so moviegoers wouldn't miss out on the next punchline.This often overlooked film is, in my opinion, one of Woody Allen's most enjoyable comedies. The film has aged well, and the witty one-liners and comical situations are still hilarious. Perhaps the reason this film is hardly ever mentioned in lists of Woody Allen's best is because he didn't direct it, although it has the look and feel of an Allen directed film in every aspect. This was a sophisticated and worthwhile film that made me long for the days when comedies were actually funny.",5,One of Allen's Best!,1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,2948,"['saw', 'film', 'Cal', 'State', 'Northridge', 'Eric', 'Lax', 'special', 'guest', 'author', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Biography', 'as', 'well', 'bios', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'David', 'Kipen', 'book', 'critic', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'moderated', 'program.In', 'answer', 'audience', 'member', 'question', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'Lax', 'said', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'never', 'made', 'bad', 'film', 'agree', 'comment', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'most', 'Allen', 'films', 'ones', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'too', 'fond', 'have', 'plenty', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'anyway', 'Even', 'heavy-handed', 'Interiors', 'had', 'lot', 'recommend', 'least', 'true', 'movie', 'buffs', 'Play', 'Again', 'Sam', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'underrated', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Based', 'play', 'written', 'Woody', 'Allen', '1968', 'directed', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'versions', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'back', '70', 'film', 'mild-mannered', 'film', 'critic', 'named', 'Allan', 'Felix', 'played', 'Allen', 'who', 'dumped', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Anspach', 'What', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'was', 'doing', 'guy', 'Allan', 'Felix', 'reason', 'Allen', 'was', 'Woody', 'playing', 'pair', 'up', 'slew', 'gorgeous', 'females', 'almost', 'films.Felix', 'apartment', 'shrine', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'none', 'other', 'Bogey', 'who', 'counsels', 'romance', 'department', 'ego', 'crushed', 'Felix', 'best', 'friend', 'Dick', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'also', 'try', 'find', 'woman', 'setting', 'up', 'one', 'disastrous', 'date', 'When', 'Felix', 'falling', 'Linda', 'series', 'hilarious', 'complications', 'take', 'place', 'guided', 'Bogey', 'what', 'do', 'results', 'funny', 'yet', 'touching', 'reworking', 'Casablanca', 'ending', 'Linda', 'even', 'donning', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'hat', 'Felix', 'giving', 'Maybe', 'Not', 'Today', 'Maybe', 'Not', 'Tomorrow', 'speech', 'Casablanca', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'whole', 'life', 'say', 'Play', 'Again', 'Sam', 'was', 'first', 'screen', 'pairing', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'star', 'handful', 'films', 'together', 'four', 'lead', 'actors', 'including', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'Jerry', 'Lacy', 'who', 'perfect', 'Bogart', 'were', 'stage', 'play', 'together', 'interesting', 'note', 'according', 'Lax', 'actors', 'knew', 'lines', 'would', 'get', 'most', 'laughs', 'performed', 'play', 'stage', 'so', 'often', 'slightly', 'paused', 'continuing', 'moviegoers', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'next', 'punchline.This', 'often', 'overlooked', 'film', 'opinion', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'comedies', 'film', 'aged', 'well', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'comical', 'situations', 'are', 'still', 'hilarious', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'film', 'hardly', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'lists', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'best', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'look', 'feel', 'Allen', 'directed', 'film', 'aspect', 'was', 'sophisticated', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'made', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'comedies', 'were', 'actually', 'funny']",N/A

Schneider,"[3, 4]","As I'm sure you now by now, this film stars Woody Allen as a film critic and CASABLANCA buff (coincidentally named Allen) whose bored wife leaves him in the throes of insecure bachelorhood, while he secretly yearns to fulfill Humphrey Bogart's role in his own love life.  Watching Woody at his neurotic, self-deprecating best is fun, and he does a lot of physical comedy in this entertaining little film.  It's funny that this is an essential Woody Allen film, yet Woody Allen himself didn't direct it!  The film's director is Herbert Ross, director of some clever &amp; funny movies such as MY BLUE HEAVEN (1991), and some not-so-clever-and-funny movies, most notably the awful PENNIES FROM HEAVEN (1981).  However, Woody wrote the screenplay, which had been adapted from the stage play that he also had written.  Since Herbert Ross doesn't take any liberties with Woody's style, it ends up being by all accounts a classic Woody Allen film.Co-starring in this enjoyable film are Diane Keaton (in her first of many films with the irreppressable Allen), Tony Roberts (as Keaton's too-busy and full-of-himself husband), and Jerry Lacy (who continually appears to Woody as a vision of Mr. Bogart).  This film was originally set in New York City, but ended up getting re-set to San Francisco due to a labor strike.  Of course, all of the actors in this movie have New York accents, but that's no matter.

It will also appeal if you just want a good old belly laugh by an original and off-kilter comedy without any profanities or over the top in-your-face comedies that come out today.Allen Felix's (Woody)wife leaves him because he fails to satisfy her. She wants to 'live', participate in life and be a 'doer' and not a 'watcher', to run through Europe on a motorcycle, go dancing and skiing. She also doesn't dig him physically -  then tells him for ""gods sake don't take it personally""!  After some prodding from best friends Dick and Linda, he decides to start dating again.He's not real comfortable in his own skin and feels the need to impress a girl immediately, like putting out his 100 yard dash track record medal(that he payed 20 dollars for) putting on the proper mood music, as well as getting top notch advice on handling chicks via Humphrey Bogart (Jerry Lacy) which is a hoot. After many dating disasters he learns a painful, yet invaluable life lesson that to have any chance of success finding love and be successful he has to accept who he is - faults and all. I won't give the plot away, only that it is because of these dating disasters that he ends up finding love,  ultimately though he finds himself.  After all, real love starts with self love.It does tend to run out of steam half way through, and I think this could be because it starts with such gusto that it had no place to go but lull once the sight and date gags are over.

I'm slightly paraphrasing, but Bogie's ghost's advice to Felix to 'Tell her she's beautiful' and 'Go on, kiss her... Go on!' are a joy to behold.The revelation is that by finding his inner warrior, his wild man energy, he is actually successful, and creates a scenario in which the man and the woman can be more comfortable in their clearly defined, yet non-hierarchical roles.While there is immense significance in the role and transforming power of the Bogart figure, this is still a warm, loving and utterly crazy Woody classic and can be enjoyed on any level.Diane Keaton... sigh...",5,"Play it again, Sham...
