My husband and I have enjoyed watching this film over and over again; I'd love to see it on DVD!It's definitely more appropriate for people who like plays (think in terms of Tennessee Williams).  I love all the Southern nuances, especially since they weren't hokey.  Scorchers itself is an old Southern term for a street-walker and there were so many phrases that made me laugh until my sides ached.  They reminded me so much of growing up with Southern parents.I saw this movie not long after my own mother had passed away, so the scenes with Jumper and Splendid were especially poignant for me.  I loved the relationship between Bear and Howler...&quot;it is the same train!&quot;If you get the chance, see this film.  It's heartwarming and funny and should be out on DVD!!!",5,Where's the DVD version????,1089849600,"07 15, 2004",2004,868,"['loved', 'movie', 'when', 'stumbled', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'husband', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'over', 'again', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'more', 'appropriate', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'plays', 'think', 'terms', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'love', 'Southern', 'nuances', 'especially', 'were', ""n't"", 'hokey', 'Scorchers', 'old', 'Southern', 'term', 'street-walker', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'phrases', 'made', 'sides', 'ached', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'growing', 'up', 'Southern', 'parents.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'not', 'long', 'own', 'mother', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'scenes', 'Jumper', 'Splendid', 'were', 'especially', 'poignant', 'loved', 'relationship', 'Bear', 'Howler', 'quot', 'same', 'train', 'quot', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'heartwarming', 'funny', 'should', 'be', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A
313755,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6302459672,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 1]","This is a rather indescribable movie.  There are some scenes of this film that are hysterically funny, mostly backwoods / redneck style humor.  There are yet other scenes that are exceptionally deep and trenchant.  In short, the movie covers the whole spectrum (somehow?).James Earl Jones is terrific as a southern backwoods open-minded bartender.  Faye Dunnaway obviously enjoyed her role as an unrepentant courtesan.  Jennifer Tilly is comical as a wife who needs to learn how to become sexy.  Those are the 3 big name Thespians in the movie.You will have to see the film for yourself to delve into all the subplots.  It is pretty close to being a real-time movie as it all takes place in an afternoon and evening in the bayou.  If someone were to ask me why I love this film, I would have to say, simply, ""I don't know.""  There is a certain mystery that permeates even the slapstick humor.  The movie is both fun-loving and as sombre as the Mahler(!) adagio that is used in the soundtrack.  In short, this film is mesmerizing....",5,Mahler in the bayou,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,1032,"['rather', 'indescribable', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'mostly', 'backwoods', '/', 'redneck', 'style', 'humor', 'are', 'yet', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'deep', 'trenchant', 'short', 'movie', 'whole', 'spectrum', 'somehow', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'terrific', 'southern', 'backwoods', 'open-minded', 'bartender', 'Faye', 'Dunnaway', 'obviously', 'enjoyed', 'role', 'unrepentant', 'courtesan', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'comical', 'wife', 'who', 'learn', 'how', 'become', 'sexy', 'are', '3', 'big', 'name', 'Thespians', 'movie.You', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'delve', 'subplots', 'pretty', 'close', 'being', 'real-time', 'movie', 'place', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'bayou', 'someone', 'were', 'ask', 'why', 'love', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'certain', 'mystery', 'even', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'movie', 'fun-loving', 'as', 'sombre', 'Mahler', 'adagio', 'used', 'soundtrack', 'short', 'film', 'mesmerizing']",N/A

Mills ""devoted to the movies""","[0, 3]","The movie has the most supurb beginning in shots of the swamp, the story told, and the wonderful score; but it goes downhill fast.  The kick in the pants for the late preacher ruined a funny situation (less is more); the chasing around in the bedroom was so way over done (it became tedious); the three vulgar guys outside the bedroom door was nothing but bad taste; the anger of James Earl Jones was so much more than what was called for; the anger of the married woman who wanted to shoot her husband for being with someone else became tiresome also; and vomiting on the wedding cake was just slapstick in a movie that could have had something to say.",2,Director & Editor Fail,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,653,"['movie', 'most', 'supurb', 'beginning', 'shots', 'swamp', 'story', 'told', 'wonderful', 'score', 'downhill', 'fast', 'kick', 'pants', 'late', 'preacher', 'ruined', 'funny', 'situation', 'less', 'more', 'chasing', 'around', 'bedroom', 'was', 'so', 'way', 'done', 'became', 'tedious', 'three', 'vulgar', 'guys', 'bedroom', 'door', 'was', 'nothing', 'bad', 'taste', 'anger', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'anger', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'wanted', 'shoot', 'husband', 'being', 'someone', 'else', 'became', 'tiresome', 'also', 'vomiting', 'wedding', 'cake', 'was', 'just', 'slapstick', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'say']",N/A

It's an odd mix of poignance and ridiculousness involving a lot of crazy intentional overacting. The emotional turmoil is serious, but the vocal inflection is consistently ridiculous. It reminds me of Beetlejuice, Evil Dead, The Nature Of The Beast, Roadracers, Crybaby, and The Road To Wellville.

Throughout the film I felt as if I were watching a recording of a play as the dialogue feels as if it is one.  The DVD comes in only 2 channel stereo and while both side channels are used somewhat it is a dialogue driven film.  The music score not only fits well but was beautifully recorded.  Not sure if this film ever made any money but it probably was seen in art houses in terms of circulation.  I enjoyed the film and while it was an unusual type for my collection and not sure if I would see it again, I am glad to have seen it the first time.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer  so check them and see if they are of help as well.HHopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Scorchers Standard Def DVD,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1018,"['One', 'more', 'interesting', 'unique', 'films', 'made', 'Had', 'never', 'heard', 'friend', 'lent', 'copy', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'film', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'recording', 'play', 'dialogue', 'feels', 'one', 'DVD', 'only', '2', 'channel', 'stereo', 'side', 'channels', 'are', 'used', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'film', 'music', 'score', 'not', 'only', 'well', 'was', 'beautifully', 'recorded', 'Not', 'sure', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'money', 'probably', 'was', 'seen', 'art', 'houses', 'terms', 'circulation', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'unusual', 'type', 'collection', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'see', 'again', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'time.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.HHopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A
