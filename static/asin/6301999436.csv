289751,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301999436,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","`Avalon' is a beautifully complete look at family life and how it becomes so easy for us to lose our focus on the important things in life the further we get from our roots.  Barry Levinson, the writer and director of this beautiful piece of cinema, drew from personal experiences (members of his family even appear in the film) in order to create a very real and emotionally connected film that anyone can enjoy and relate to.  At its heart it is a film about family, regardless of class distinction or nationality, and we all come from a family.`Avalon' tells the story of the Krichinsky family, a Polish-Jewish family that moves to New England, one family member at a time, at the dawn of the 20th century.  The younger generation wants to take advantage of their new land and make a success of themselves, while the older generation struggles to keep relationships as strong as they once were in a land that forsakes culture for convenience.  As the film progresses through the lives of the family we get to see each and everyone within the film flourish and grow.  The contrasting states of the elder Sam and the younger Jules and the even younger Michael are seen in a beautiful array of emotional resonance.What I genuinely appreciated about `Avalon' is that it never pressed sentimentality for an overtly dramatic effect.  Case in point; within a few minutes of the films running time Jules is stabbed during an altercation with a robber.  Instead of milking this for all its worth and creating an overly sentimental issue out of the stabbing, the film quickly moves on.  This is a wonderful way for the film to create a very natural setting, allowing it to infuse its script with scenes of drama and weight without appearing to be `trying to hard'.Each scene feels natural and relatable.As Jules and his cousin Izzy attempt to create a name for themselves with their department store, Jules father Sam tries to keep his family together, and Jules son Michael tries to wrap his head around everything that is happening all at once.  These three men (two men and a boy) prove to be the focus of the film and the film is truly told through their perspectives.  Thanks to some wonderful acting, these men come to life before our very eyes.Armin Mueller-Stahl creates a truly beautiful parental performance, warming and touching to the core.  As he struggles to keep his family together we can see his dismay as they move further and further away from that close nit relationship they once experienced.  Sam laments about the fact that the further they get from Avalon (the place which they lived upon their initial arrival to the States) the further they get from each other.  Aidan Quinn is also wonderfully genuine as Jules.  He creates a man who we can understand and rally behind as he attempts to bring his family into the 20th century.  Elijah Wood though is the star here.  His portrayal of young Michael is beautiful, truly grasping the child's wonderment and intrigue in his surroundings.The supporting cast is also fantastic, from Elizabeth Perkins to Joan Plowright to Kevin Pollack, all of whom add many layers to the Krichinsky family.There are many films about families from abroad who make their ways to the American shore (another wholly effective one would be the more recent `In America') and this is truly one of the better ones.  It is emotionally connective, tremendously moving and in the end wonderfully entertaining.  It is a film that everyone can enjoy, a film that the whole family can relate to and one that all can grow to love.",5,"A beautiful depiction of love, life and family...",1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,3562,"['Avalon', 'beautifully', 'complete', 'look', 'family', 'life', 'how', 'so', 'easy', 'lose', 'focus', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'further', 'get', 'roots', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'writer', 'director', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'cinema', 'drew', 'personal', 'experiences', 'members', 'family', 'even', 'appear', 'film', 'order', 'create', 'very', 'real', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'film', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'relate', 'heart', 'film', 'family', 'regardless', 'class', 'distinction', 'nationality', 'come', 'family.', 'Avalon', 'story', 'Krichinsky', 'family', 'Polish-Jewish', 'family', 'New', 'England', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'time', 'dawn', '20th', 'century', 'younger', 'generation', 'take', 'advantage', 'new', 'land', 'make', 'success', 'older', 'generation', 'keep', 'relationships', 'as', 'strong', 'once', 'were', 'land', 'culture', 'convenience', 'film', 'lives', 'family', 'get', 'see', 'everyone', 'film', 'flourish', 'grow', 'contrasting', 'states', 'elder', 'Sam', 'younger', 'Jules', 'even', 'younger', 'Michael', 'are', 'seen', 'beautiful', 'array', 'emotional', 'resonance.What', 'genuinely', 'appreciated', 'Avalon', 'never', 'pressed', 'sentimentality', 'overtly', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'Case', 'point', 'few', 'minutes', 'films', 'running', 'time', 'Jules', 'stabbed', 'altercation', 'robber', 'Instead', 'milking', 'worth', 'creating', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'issue', 'stabbing', 'film', 'quickly', 'wonderful', 'way', 'film', 'create', 'very', 'natural', 'setting', 'allowing', 'infuse', 'script', 'scenes', 'drama', 'weight', 'appearing', 'be', 'trying', ""hard'.Each"", 'scene', 'feels', 'natural', 'relatable.As', 'Jules', 'cousin', 'Izzy', 'attempt', 'create', 'name', 'department', 'store', 'Jules', 'father', 'Sam', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'Jules', 'son', 'Michael', 'wrap', 'head', 'everything', 'happening', 'once', 'three', 'men', 'two', 'men', 'boy', 'prove', 'be', 'focus', 'film', 'film', 'truly', 'told', 'perspectives', 'Thanks', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'men', 'come', 'life', 'very', 'eyes.Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'parental', 'performance', 'warming', 'touching', 'core', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'can', 'see', 'dismay', 'move', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'close', 'nit', 'relationship', 'once', 'experienced', 'Sam', 'fact', 'further', 'get', 'Avalon', 'place', 'lived', 'initial', 'arrival', 'States', 'further', 'get', 'other', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'genuine', 'Jules', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'understand', 'rally', 'bring', 'family', '20th', 'century', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'though', 'star', 'here', 'portrayal', 'young', 'Michael', 'beautiful', 'truly', 'grasping', 'child', 'wonderment', 'intrigue', 'surroundings.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'whom', 'add', 'many', 'layers', 'Krichinsky', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'families', 'abroad', 'who', 'make', 'ways', 'American', 'shore', 'wholly', 'effective', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'recent', 'America', 'truly', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'emotionally', 'connective', 'tremendously', 'moving', 'end', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'can', 'grow', 'love']",N/A
289752,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,6301999436,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","That's Lou Jacobi's signature line in this film, and it's quite a statement that I can use it 13 years after &quot;Avalon's&quot; release and still draw a knowing response.  Although 'Diner' will always remain Barry's Levinson's singular masterpiece, in Avalon he digs deeper to show us the roots of his family and how it slowly spun apart.Levinson returns to the Thanksgiving dinner scene year after year as touchstone to show how the family grows and evolves.Moreover, Avalon is a significant statement about America in general and the basic dissolution of the three-generation 'altogether' family unit.  Levinson makes the very compelling case that the culprits are the television (the mood and tone of Avalon break dramatically once television is introduced) and the suburbs, or looked at alternatively, city flight.I love Lou Jacobi in this film.  Armin Mueller-Stahl is equally as good.  Also, look for an eight-year-old Elijah Wood in his first big role as Mueller-Stahl's grandson (and Aidan Quinn's son).

289755,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6301999436,Bomojaz,"[1, 2]","Set in Baltimore in the 40s and 50s, the movie revolves around a large extended family of Polish immigrants. Sam Krichinsky (played by Armin Mueller-Stahl) is the central character who loves to tell the story of his arrival in Baltimore on July 4, 1914. The movie shoots for nostalgia and generally hits the target right on; scenes are bathed in soft colors and blend smoothly into one another. We're shown family reunions, bickerings, good times, hard times - it's almost the universal immigrant story mythologized, so familiar as to be every American's ""dream"" history. Television is the media at the center of it all, chosen by director Barry Levinson as the grand symbol of the age. The movie is easy and enjoyable to watch and we get lulled right in to it (one wishes at times more risks had been taken with the script and direction). Like that favorite family story  told over and over again at family reunions, the movie is reliable and comforting and safe and truthful (mostly): it's the heart of the story with all the messy rough edges carefully pruned away.

289756,A3PHTB9X7B11XL,6301999436,C.A. Arthur,"[0, 2]","The reviewers are right: This is a splendid film.  The acting is extraordinarily good, as is the directing and cinematography.  The re-creation of America through the late 1940s and into the early 1950s is painstakingly accurate.  Still, one comes away from this very long film with little.  The reason lies in the script.How do wholly secular Jewish family members interact with each other?  Levinson's answer: They scream at each other constantly.  If you enjoy seemingly endless bickering, hollering, and nastiness, this is the film for you.  Despite the ads, the move contains virtually no humor, and there is little to feel good about when the credits appear.  Real?  Yes.  Entertaining?  Perhaps, but it helps to be a masochist.There are three errors in the film involving music.  The first is a scene where the hero is playing a violin.  The fingers on his left hand don't move.  Then there is the older man playing the piano, and his hand movement doesn't appear to match what one hears.  In a nightclub scene, a handful of musicians produce a big band sound that had to be recorded by a much larger group.  How could the director be blind to such blatant mistakes, since he is so meticulous elsewhere?  Well, the film is worth seeing anyway.

289757,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6301999436,Char,"[1, 1]","""I came to America in 1914..."", begins Sam's refrain that recurs several times during the movie.  A handsome and bright-eyed young man, Sam Krichinsky is walking amidst fireworks and bright lights that he finds delightful, wonderful.Having arrived in Baltimore on July 4 in time to see the American citizens of that city celebrating the quintessentially American holiday, Sam thinks America is the most beautiful place in the world--and he continues to think so throughout his life.  As Sam ages he loves to tell his grandchildren over and over the story about his arrival in America, his search for his four brothers who had preceded him, the stories of various people he met and got to know, the stories of his parents, and other important-to-him memories.Sam meets a beautiful ""dream"" of a young woman who becomes his wife and the viewer will witness her down-to-earth personality traits that aren't so dreamy.  Sam and his wife and subsequent offspring live at a row-house community called ""Avalon"" until they become prosperous enough after WWII to move to a nice house in the suburbs.The movie is an overview of Sam and his family's typical American life up into Sam's old age, when he sits musing alone in a nursing home.  The family members, as well as Sam, have important roles in the story.The story is all so typical, in one way or another, of almost every older American's experience of family life that most older viewers will surely be able to identify with it a lot.  There are the typical ""strains"" of family life, the typical ""family arguments.""  This happens to be a Jewish family, but the story applies just as well to the family-life experiences of many non-Jewish immigrants and non-immigrant families, too, in America during the time frame covered in this film.Anyone who has had a beloved ""grandfather"" or other relative [immigrant or not] who has been the self-appointed, repetitious, story-teller of the family will probably enjoy seeing their relative reproduced in the character of Sam.I loved some of the humorous touches, like Sam's story of the man he met in 1914 who worked breaking in other people's shoes for them!  Sam says that this man and his brothers walked the streets doing this kind of work for several years until they got the idea to start a business making shoes that would fit people right away.  He tells of a family of brothers who became paper-hangers [a now-extinct skill].  And so on and so on with the good stories that sometimes try the patience of some of the family members.Since the movie realistically reproduces scenes from ""ordinary"" life, the movie isn't full of great excitements.  (Well, there are auto accidents and a big fire...)  The viewer is bound to feel the slow pace of the story and may be tempted a few times to forego watching it until the end, but it's a charming, upbeat story about ""human"" [flawed] people, worth sticking with all the way through. (It is one movie in a trilogy, first shown in 1990, but it works just fine as a stand-alone movie.)The story will be for some viewers a loving walk down memory lane from 1914 through the 1950s, and some will cherish it because it stirs heartstrings with memories from a family's life that was so much like their own family's life.",5,"Nostalgic Immigrant Family Saga, appreciative of ""Beautiful"" America, typical Family Life 1914 thru 1950s",1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,3252,"['came', 'America', '1914', 'Sam', 'refrain', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'handsome', 'bright-eyed', 'young', 'man', 'Sam', 'Krichinsky', 'walking', 'amidst', 'fireworks', 'bright', 'lights', 'delightful', 'wonderful.Having', 'arrived', 'Baltimore', 'July', '4', 'time', 'see', 'American', 'citizens', 'city', 'celebrating', 'quintessentially', 'American', 'holiday', 'Sam', 'America', 'most', 'beautiful', 'place', 'world', 'think', 'so', 'life', 'Sam', 'tell', 'grandchildren', 'story', 'arrival', 'America', 'search', 'four', 'brothers', 'who', 'had', 'preceded', 'stories', 'various', 'people', 'met', 'got', 'know', 'stories', 'parents', 'other', 'important-to-him', 'memories.Sam', 'beautiful', 'dream', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'wife', 'viewer', 'will', 'witness', 'down-to-earth', 'personality', 'traits', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'dreamy', 'Sam', 'wife', 'subsequent', 'offspring', 'live', 'row-house', 'community', 'called', 'Avalon', 'become', 'prosperous', 'enough', 'WWII', 'move', 'nice', 'house', 'suburbs.The', 'movie', 'overview', 'Sam', 'family', 'typical', 'American', 'life', 'up', 'Sam', 'old', 'age', 'when', 'musing', 'alone', 'nursing', 'home', 'family', 'members', 'as', 'well', 'Sam', 'have', 'important', 'roles', 'story.The', 'story', 'so', 'typical', 'one', 'way', 'almost', 'older', 'American', 'experience', 'family', 'life', 'most', 'older', 'viewers', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'lot', 'are', 'typical', 'strains', 'family', 'life', 'typical', 'family', 'arguments', 'be', 'Jewish', 'family', 'story', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'family-life', 'experiences', 'many', 'non-Jewish', 'immigrants', 'non-immigrant', 'families', 'too', 'America', 'time', 'frame', 'covered', 'film.Anyone', 'who', 'had', 'beloved', 'grandfather', 'other', 'relative', '[', 'immigrant', 'not', ']', 'who', 'been', 'self-appointed', 'repetitious', 'story-teller', 'family', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'relative', 'reproduced', 'character', 'Sam.I', 'loved', 'humorous', 'touches', 'Sam', 'story', 'man', 'met', '1914', 'who', 'worked', 'breaking', 'other', 'people', 'shoes', 'Sam', 'man', 'brothers', 'walked', 'streets', 'doing', 'kind', 'work', 'several', 'years', 'got', 'idea', 'start', 'business', 'making', 'shoes', 'would', 'fit', 'people', 'right', 'away', 'family', 'brothers', 'who', 'became', 'paper-hangers', 'now-extinct', 'skill', ']', 'so', 'so', 'good', 'stories', 'sometimes', 'try', 'patience', 'family', 'members.Since', 'movie', 'realistically', 'scenes', 'ordinary', 'life', 'movie', ""n't"", 'full', 'great', 'excitements', 'Well', 'are', 'auto', 'accidents', 'big', 'fire', 'viewer', 'bound', 'feel', 'slow', 'pace', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'tempted', 'few', 'times', 'forego', 'watching', 'end', 'charming', 'upbeat', 'story', 'human', '[', 'flawed', ']', 'people', 'worth', 'sticking', 'way', 'one', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'first', 'shown', '1990', 'just', 'fine', 'stand-alone', 'movie', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'viewers', 'loving', 'walk', 'memory', 'lane', '1914', '1950s', 'will', 'cherish', 'heartstrings', 'memories', 'family', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'family', 'life']",N/A

Russell ""syzygy121""","[6, 6]","This film is a powerful depiction of the loss of innocence experienced by so many immigrants who came to this country, believing it was a veritable promised land.  Slowly and subtly, Levinson shows how their once close families are pulled apart by the demands of the culture.  From the flight of the middle class to the suburbs and the loss of traditional business values, the transformations our society underwent in the post-war period are captured here with masterful storytelling.  Watch how television gradually becomes the center of the home, rather than the family table.  The turkey scene, as funny as it is, is profound.

I generously give it two stars; one and a half would be more accurate. This movie traces the adventures of an immigrant family of sort-of generic ethnicity. Maybe not a bad idea, but too much of it is woefully bogged-down. A derailing streetcar and a boy attacked by a swarm of bees are among the numerous disjointed episodes that essentially go nowhere. It's hardly a sign of a great movie when its most memorable episode is of a schoolboy getting himself in a lurch by asking the teacher &quot;Can I go to the bathroom?&quot; when she's just finished lecturing on the difference between &quot;can&quot; and &quot;may&quot;. If the whole movie were that memorable, it would be considerably better, though. Sometimes a movie is said to have needed better editing, but in this case, not much of a movie would be left. Early on there's a scene where a shroud is being spread over a casket at a funeral, then the magic of movie editing turns the shroud into a tablecloth being spread by a woman for a big feast.

289769,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6301999436,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[42, 43]","Looking back at some recent comedies by Barry Levinson (""Envy"" and ""Man of the Year""), it's hard to remember the not-so-distant past when he was a major Hollywood director.  A primary creative force behind TV's lauded ""Homicide,"" he also won accolades for film projects as diverse as ""Diner"" in 1982 to ""Wag the Dog"" in 1997.  And for a few years, he was on a real roll of serious minded and critically acclaimed movies--""Good Morning, Vietnam"" followed by an Oscar for ""Rain Man"" and then another nomination for ""Bugsy.""  Well, in between ""Rain Man"" and ""Bugsy"" (both films that I would rate at 5 stars for different reasons), he made his most personal film yet.  While ""Avalon"" doesn't have the high profile of some of these other films (it did secure some writing awards for Levinson, however)--it is my favorite.  It's a little film, a quiet character study, a wistfully nostalgic look at a more innocent time--but it's done on an epic scale.""Avalon"" is a fictionalized (and idealized) account of Levinson's own history, a Jewish family from Russia emigrates to the United States to seek prosperity and happiness.  Set largely in the Baltimore of the 1940s and 1950s, ""Avalon"" gently examines family and the discovery of new opportunity.  Plot-wise, there isn't a lot to account for--this film doesn't just seek to tell a story, but to strike a mood and create a feeling.  There are just great scenes of familial interaction, funny scenes about growing up, scenes of wonder at the progress of a new country.  The film might be one of the strongest family films ever.  In a day where every film represents dysfunction and quirkiness, ""Avalon"" is a sweet throwback.  This film is based on love, communication, and how people can naturally drift apart.  It can come across as innocent and sanitized, perhaps, but the writing is so crisp and observant and the performances are beautiful.  To further set a mood, the film is shot beautifully with gorgeous colors and expanses and the score is spot on.The film stars a young Elijah Wood (as Levinson's surrogate, we presume).  Much of the film's wonder comes from seeing things from a child's perspective.  It's easy to forget how long Wood has been around what with the ""Lord of the Rings"" phenomenon--but this is one of his earliest starring roles.  His parents are played by Aidan Quinn and Elizabeth Perkins--both giving perfectly nuanced performances.  But if the film belongs to anyone--it's Armin Mueller-Stahl as the grandfather.  I've always felt that if this film had a slightly larger profile on its release, that this could have been his Oscar.""Avalon"" may not be for everyone--there isn't a lot of action.  But for me, it's a near perfect film.  I'm not warm and cuddly, by any means, and like entertainment with an edge.  But ""Avalon"" captures me every time.  It's so charming, so thoughtful, so engaging, so literate, so beautiful to look at.  I recommend this film wholeheartedly, and hope to see a DVD reissue someday that mirrors the quality of the production.  It's time more people discover this lost treasure!

289775,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,6301999436,N. Gregg,"[4, 4]","A pretty authentic story of a Jewish immigrant family named Kirchinsky.  It mostly revolves around Sam Kirchinsky who came to America in 1914. -- As members of his family had come to America and made a living, they would save and pool together and bring another family member over and help them get on their feet and then bring over another (which is how Sam's brothers brought him over).When Sam arrived in America, it was the evening of July 4th and fireworks were going off and people were celebrating everywhere, everyone seemed happy and in good situations, and he thought it was the most beautiful place he'd ever seen.  This movie pretty much revolves around Sam and later his son for a few decades.The Kirchinsky's shared houses with other family members and the cousins were close by so the family grew up together knowing each other well and having a good support system and strong family ties. Children were raised by the family community, not just their parents.But as time goes by things change - his son and his nephew legally changed their last names to more American (easier) sounding ones (Kaye and Kirk respectively) - and eventually as better livings are made they begin to separate somewhat (moving from row houses to the suburbs) and bit by bit the strong family community falls apart.  (Which is really a shame, but it is how things happened.)It's not a success story, not a fast-paced or witty story, the story of 1 person's life, or a love story etc. -- it's just a window back in time.  It's interesting, realistic, nostalgic and perhaps a bit sad.  It's no ""must see"" and probably not even one I'd watch again - but I liked it when I watched it, and it stuck with me for the rest of the day (sometimes replaying parts of the movie, sometimes remembering my childhood and how different it was for families even then (in 1960's and presently) and feeling a bit sad at how we lost the family community support system and bond.  People back then had so much less than we do today - but they also had so much more.If you can handle some nostalgia - or want a glimpse into history - check this movie out.",3,"a simple, pleasant, nostalgic window back in time",1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,2124,"['pretty', 'authentic', 'story', 'Jewish', 'immigrant', 'family', 'named', 'Kirchinsky', 'mostly', 'around', 'Sam', 'Kirchinsky', 'who', 'came', 'America', '1914', 'members', 'family', 'had', 'come', 'America', 'made', 'living', 'would', 'save', 'pool', 'together', 'bring', 'family', 'member', 'help', 'get', 'feet', 'then', 'bring', 'over', 'how', 'Sam', 'brothers', 'brought', 'over', '.When', 'Sam', 'arrived', 'America', 'was', 'evening', 'July', '4th', 'fireworks', 'were', 'going', 'off', 'people', 'were', 'celebrating', 'everywhere', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'happy', 'good', 'situations', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'beautiful', 'place', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'revolves', 'Sam', 'later', 'son', 'few', 'decades.The', 'Kirchinsky', 'shared', 'houses', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'cousins', 'were', 'close', 'family', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'knowing', 'other', 'well', 'having', 'good', 'support', 'system', 'strong', 'family', 'ties', 'Children', 'were', 'raised', 'family', 'community', 'not', 'just', 'parents.But', 'time', 'things', 'change', 'son', 'nephew', 'legally', 'changed', 'last', 'names', 'more', 'American', 'easier', 'sounding', 'ones', 'Kaye', 'Kirk', 'respectively', 'eventually', 'better', 'livings', 'are', 'made', 'begin', 'separate', 'somewhat', 'moving', 'row', 'houses', 'suburbs', 'bit', 'bit', 'strong', 'family', 'community', 'apart', 'Which', 'really', 'shame', 'how', 'things', 'happened', 'not', 'success', 'story', 'not', 'fast-paced', 'witty', 'story', 'story', '1', 'person', 'life', 'love', 'story', 'etc', 'just', 'window', 'back', 'time', 'interesting', 'realistic', 'nostalgic', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'sad', 'must', 'see', 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'one', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'liked', 'when', 'watched', 'stuck', 'rest', 'day', 'sometimes', 'replaying', 'parts', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'remembering', 'childhood', 'how', 'different', 'was', 'families', 'even', 'then', '1960', 'presently', 'feeling', 'bit', 'sad', 'how', 'lost', 'family', 'community', 'support', 'system', 'bond', 'People', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'do', 'today', 'also', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'handle', 'nostalgia', 'want', 'glimpse', 'history', 'check', 'movie', 'out']",N/A

289782,A1XFMT7QS5K4KE,6301999436,"Peter Beyer ""Peter Beyer""","[1, 2]","On paper, writer-director Barry Levinson's semi-autobiographical Avalon, which begins with the arrival of Polish Jew Sam Krichinsky (Armin Mueller- Stahl) in the Avalon area of Baltimore, Md., on July 4, 1914, and ends when he is in his dotage on another July 4 sometime in the sixties, is an intellectually crystalline epic about the demise of the extended family, the erosion of traditional American and European values, the growth of alienated suburban culture (organized around television) and the hegemony of materialism.That's on paper. On screen, Avalon is unconscionably sloppy (the leaves of deciduous trees in Baltimore at Christmas are green on one block, yellow on another and non-existent on a third), structurally amorphous (the movie could end at any time or go on forever, which it seems to do), and gummily sentimental (grandparents and children are psychologically saintly). The lovely moments and fine performances in the picture can't redeem Levinson's technical carelessness - the editing is without rhythm, momentum, or even logic - nor can they compensate for Avalon's ethnographic toothlessness: imagine Mordecai Richler without the bite.Levinson would have made Duddy Kravitz a mensch.Avalon is more irritating than most ambitious failures because Levinson, winner of the best directing Oscar in 1988 for Rain Man, is wildly talented, and his two earlier semi-autobiographical films set in Baltimore, Diner and Tin Men, were twin peaks of Proustian purity. Structured lightly but soundly, in the esthetic version of aluminum, they vaulted over the twin valleys of bathos, sentimentality and nostalgia.Avalon is a bridge made of lead.But students of performance will want to see it for a quartet of reasons. The first is Armin Mueller-Stahl, the East German actor who came West in the late seventies and has not been within spitting distance of mediocrity since, whether as the tortured politician in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Lola, the complex farmer in Angry Harvest or Jessica Lange's mysterious father in Music Box. As written, Avalon's Sam Krichinsky is fundamentally a grandchild's adoring projection of a grandfather, but Mueller-Stahl's Prussian blue eyes bespeak more depth than the character is permitted to articulate; when the script does become bluntly pedantic, Mueller-Stahl subtly softens the blows. Sadly, even this great actor is done in at the end when he is plastered with outrageously inept old-age makeup. He looks like nothing less than a blue-eyed, Teutonic E.T. about to sing a geriatric variation of Cabaret's Nazi hymn, Tomorrow Belongs to Me: Yesterday Vas Mine.The second extraordinary actor is Joan Plowright, the British widow of Laurence Olivier; she plays Eva Krichinsky, Sam's Polish-American wife, with a flawless accent, as if she had not done Shakespeare, Chekhov, John Osborne or Peter Greenaway, all of whom she has, of course, enlivened. But technique aside, she follows Mueller-Stahl in toughening up the soft edges and in softening the rough edges of a character verging on caricature; while certainly Jewish, her meddling mother-cum-grandmother is no stage- bound Jewish mother.The most fully dramatized conflict in Avalon involves the grandparents and their relationship to their son Jules and his wife Ann (and eventually to the young couple's children), all of whom live together. Aidan Quinn, as the cautious and contemplative Jules, and Elizabeth Perkins, as the fun-loving but responsible Ann, complete the foursome of exceptional performances: he infuses an introvert with exterior life and she captures the spirit of femininity in the fifties with eerie exactitude, as if Life had come to life (it's an asset that she looks like the Judy Garland of that period).Four fabulous musicians, less than fabulous music for them to play: the resonant sequences (an on-going Thanksgiving argument, for example) are regularly intercut with comic schtick, the most egregious instance being the purchase of a television set - would people interested enough in TV to buy one not know that during the day there were no programs? The purchasers sit in front of the box, watch the test pattern, get disgusted, and leave it to the kids. It's a funny bit, but it's fraudulent, and it corrodes Avalon, which is trying to do something new, with the stuff of deja-vu. There are two lines delivered by Eva that express the irritation Avalon engenders: ""How many times do we have to hear this story? We all heard it before.""

How wrong I was!  Avalon is the third element in Barry Levinson's ""Baltimore Trilogy"".  It falls somewhere between Diner (to which I would also give 5 stars) and Tin Men (to which I would give 3 stars) in quality, but it has more sentiment than either.Armin Mueller-Stahl, who I had not seen before this picture, turns in an excellent performance.  I take some degree of issue with Amazon's description of the movie as starring Elizabeth Perkins; she is in fact plays a minor character.  Personally, I found her performance one dimensional.  Joan Plowright's performance as the family matriarch is much better.  Aidan Quinn and Kevin Pollak, the latter of whom I have been a fan of for years, are nothing less than excellent.  Yes, this film can get ponderous and a bit long in the tooth, but I would hardly dismiss it as ""artsy"" or ""cutesy"".

The characters in Avalon are the immigrants of the 20th century, the ones who never looked back as they stepped off the ship, the airplane, the raft made of old tires. Immigrants of today often have the luxury of their home country being only a plane flight away. There are no more immigrant gamblers who buy a one-way ticket to America, cross their fingers, say a prayer and hope for the best, knowing they can never go home again.The true gift of ""Avalon"" is the commonality of experience. The characters of Avalon are Jewish, but their story is one that will ring true to many people, regardless of ethnicity, heritage or birth country. It's a bit long, and there's no car crashes (okay, there's one), A-list Hollywood action hero movie stars or vampires, but this is a movie to be treasured and remembered long after you finish watching it.",5,One of the best movies I've ever seen,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,1102,"['movie', 'slowly', 'plot-wise', 'iceberg', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'age', '40', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'American', 'immigrant', 'experience', '20th', 'century', 'first-hand', 'overheard', 'stories', 'told', 'others', 'characters', 'Avalon', 'are', 'immigrants', '20th', 'century', 'ones', 'who', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'stepped', 'off', 'ship', 'airplane', 'raft', 'made', 'old', 'tires', 'Immigrants', 'today', 'often', 'have', 'luxury', 'home', 'country', 'being', 'only', 'plane', 'flight', 'away', 'are', 'more', 'immigrant', 'gamblers', 'who', 'buy', 'one-way', 'ticket', 'America', 'cross', 'fingers', 'say', 'prayer', 'hope', 'best', 'knowing', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'home', 'again.The', 'true', 'gift', 'Avalon', 'commonality', 'experience', 'characters', 'Avalon', 'are', 'Jewish', 'story', 'one', 'will', 'ring', 'true', 'many', 'people', 'regardless', 'ethnicity', 'heritage', 'birth', 'country', 'bit', 'long', 'car', 'crashes', 'okay', 'one', 'A-list', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'hero', 'movie', 'stars', 'vampires', 'movie', 'be', 'treasured', 'remembered', 'long', 'finish', 'watching']",N/A
289787,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6301999436,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[24, 25]","Barry Levinson's sprawling ""Avalon"" tells the story of Polish Jewish immigrant Sam Krichinsky as he joins his four brothers in Baltimore, 1914. The movie opens with a beautifully shot montage of fireworks, American symbols of liberty such as the eagle, and an immigrant's wonder at the lights and joy surrounding him on the Fourth of July. We cut to the present, where Sam's large family is introduced at Thanksgiving dinner, where the various brothers and their wives bicker in the way that large families do. Sam's son, Jules (Aidan Quinn), and his grandson Michael (Elijah Wood, in his first major role) become the focus of much of the story. Sam and his cousin Izzy (Kevin Pollack) engage in a series of risky business deals to expand their small department store into televisions, then a discount store, then a discount warehouse, all the while swept along by the tide of modern technology (television).Levinson based the character of Sam on his own immigrant grandfather, and Avalon paints a poignant portrait of family dynamics and the intrusion of commercialism and technology on their lives. Avalon feels like it could have benefited from a little extra trimming (the subplot of Eva's long-lost brother coming to America fades in and out in the blink of an eye), but overall was a beautiful look at a family's changing traditions across the generations. Armin Mueller-Stahl is amazing as Sam, and Joan Plowright as his long-suffering wife brings a fire and charm to the character that reminded me of my own Polish grandmother.The one element that seemed too transparent was the family's Jewishness, or lack of it. We never see the Krichinsky family at seders, Shabbat, Hanukkah, or other holidays, which seems in a way to strip them of the freedom sought in America (there is some Yiddish spoken, we do hear that Eva's brother was in a concentration camp, and see a Jewish cemetery, but that's about it). The next generations become more and more Americanized, changing their names. Kudos for the excellent period music (1940s Big Band and swing, jazz) and vintage television serials, costumes, and cinematography. This is a beautiful film that embraces family and tradition in turbulent times.",5,A family's love is tested by changing times,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2203,"['Barry', 'Levinson', 'sprawling', 'Avalon', 'story', 'Polish', 'Jewish', 'immigrant', 'Sam', 'Krichinsky', 'four', 'brothers', 'Baltimore', '1914', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'montage', 'fireworks', 'American', 'symbols', 'liberty', 'such', 'eagle', 'immigrant', 'wonder', 'lights', 'joy', 'surrounding', 'Fourth', 'July', 'cut', 'present', 'where', 'Sam', 'large', 'family', 'introduced', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'where', 'various', 'brothers', 'wives', 'bicker', 'way', 'large', 'families', 'do', 'Sam', 'son', 'Jules', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'grandson', 'Michael', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'become', 'focus', 'much', 'story', 'Sam', 'cousin', 'Izzy', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'engage', 'series', 'risky', 'business', 'deals', 'expand', 'small', 'department', 'store', 'televisions', 'then', 'discount', 'store', 'then', 'discount', 'warehouse', 'while', 'swept', 'tide', 'modern', 'technology', 'television', '.Levinson', 'based', 'character', 'Sam', 'own', 'immigrant', 'grandfather', 'Avalon', 'poignant', 'portrait', 'family', 'dynamics', 'intrusion', 'commercialism', 'technology', 'lives', 'Avalon', 'feels', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'little', 'extra', 'trimming', 'subplot', 'Eva', 'long-lost', 'brother', 'coming', 'America', 'fades', 'blink', 'eye', 'overall', 'was', 'beautiful', 'look', 'family', 'changing', 'traditions', 'generations', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'amazing', 'Sam', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'fire', 'charm', 'character', 'reminded', 'own', 'Polish', 'grandmother.The', 'one', 'element', 'seemed', 'too', 'transparent', 'was', 'family', 'Jewishness', 'lack', 'never', 'see', 'Krichinsky', 'family', 'seders', 'Shabbat', 'Hanukkah', 'other', 'holidays', 'way', 'strip', 'freedom', 'sought', 'America', 'Yiddish', 'spoken', 'do', 'hear', 'Eva', 'brother', 'was', 'concentration', 'camp', 'see', 'Jewish', 'cemetery', 'next', 'generations', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'Americanized', 'changing', 'names', 'Kudos', 'excellent', 'period', 'music', '1940s', 'Big', 'Band', 'swing', 'jazz', 'vintage', 'television', 'serials', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'film', 'family', 'tradition', 'turbulent', 'times']",N/A

When I saw it with a nice couple I knew back in Pittsburgh in 1990, I fell asleep in spots. But I was tired.  That wasn't a reflection of the film.  I saw it again on video later on and  found it to be a wonderful portrait of family life. In a nutshell, it  basically chronicles the lives of a Jewish immigrant family here in America  during the early part of the 20th century and the generations that come  after. It's beautifully told and a bit of a tear-jerker as well. This was  my first film seeing Elijah Wood and I have admired him since. I also was  captivated by the family patriarch Armin Mueller-Stahl and his desperate  attempts to keep the family together and faithful to the old ways despite a  changing world. Eventually, the invention of television comes into the  picture which also has an adverse effect on family &quot;quality  time&quot;. I really love this movie and it's a SHAME that it isn't on DVD  yet! We are waiting Mr Levinson! I find stories and films about the whole  immigrant experience during turn of the century America to be fascinating.
