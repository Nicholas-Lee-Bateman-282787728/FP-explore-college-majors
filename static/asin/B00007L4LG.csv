It's entertaining watching the other girls show up and its also quite obvious that the main guy character isn't going to fall for any of them.The one gripe I do have is with the american girl who is constantly grabbing other girl's chest.  who is their right mind would do that?  No one!!

731080,A3B249FQ2OJBCQ,B00007L4LG,"AstroNerdBoy ""AstroNerdBoy""","[12, 13]","This DVD contains the first five episodes of the popular series ""Ai Yori Aoshi"".  Pioneer has actually done a DVD right, but more on that in a bit.The story is about Aoi and Kaoru and their love.  Both come from powerful Japanese families and were engaged as children in an arranged marriage.  However, Kaoru leaves his family to attend college in Tokyo against their wishes.  They call off the engagement much to Aoi's dismay.  Despite not having seen him since childhood, she's been raised to be Kaoru's wife, so she goes to Tokyo to find out what went wrong.The love story between Aoi and Kaoru is sweet and touching.  Some American's may not understand why Aoi would want to be the perfect housewife for Kaoru, and so may hate this title for that reason alone.  But for her, this is what she wants -- a traditional household.  That aside, the first four episodes cover about 48 hours of the young couple's reunion.  The fifth episode has the couple getting a greenlight to live together with a HUGE caveat.  You'll have to watch to see what that is.While there is some fanservice in the first four episodes, it goes to the extreme when the character of Tina is added to the cast.  The fanservice (gratuitous shots of girls in their panties, revealing outfits, nudity, jiggling breasts, etc.) is the only negative to this series.  If you thought ""Hand Maid May"" has a lot of fanservice, this series has TONS more!  It is all uncalled for and screws with what otherwise would be a perfect romantic-comedy.As to the DVD, Pioneer actually does this one right!  Usually I complain about how they subtitle their titles.  This time, they use ALL Japanese honorifix in the subtitles which is great.  I know some people don't like this, but honorifix don't translate well into English.  The honorifix are needed because it helps you to understand how the characters relate to each other.  Japanese are big on a hierarchy system in their society and since this is a Japanese title, keeping this helps the viewer get a better understanding of the Japanese in general as well as the characters in the story.The English dub is also well done, though there are a few rough spots, especially with Tina.  Some of the honorifix survive in the English dub including ""sempai"". The ""-dono"" honorific gets translated as ""Sir"" which didn't really fit.  At times ""-sama"" is translated (for Aoi when her keeper calls her ""Lady Aoi"") and at times it isn't (when Aoi calls Kaoru ""Kaoru-sama"").  The ""-kun"" suffix is dropped totally from the English dub but I don't mind since I appreciate the attempt on Pioneer's part.Bottom line:  Great romance story to beat ""Oh My Goddess"" but the excessive fanservice will be a turnoff for some folks.  Those who watch subtitles should really appreciate the job done here to include the honorifix, and the Engish dub is good too.  Recommended for most anime fans, especially those who like harem romantic-comedy titles.",5,"Good Story, Excessive Fanservice",1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,2935,"['DVD', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'popular', 'series', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'Pioneer', 'actually', 'done', 'DVD', 'right', 'more', 'bit.The', 'story', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'love', 'come', 'powerful', 'Japanese', 'families', 'were', 'engaged', 'children', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'However', 'Kaoru', 'family', 'attend', 'college', 'Tokyo', 'wishes', 'call', 'engagement', 'much', 'Aoi', 'dismay', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'childhood', 'been', 'raised', 'be', 'Kaoru', 'wife', 'Tokyo', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'went', 'wrong.The', 'love', 'story', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'sweet', 'touching', 'American', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'Aoi', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'perfect', 'housewife', 'Kaoru', 'so', 'may', 'hate', 'title', 'reason', 'alone', 'what', 'traditional', 'household', 'aside', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'cover', '48', 'hours', 'young', 'couple', 'reunion', 'fifth', 'episode', 'couple', 'getting', 'greenlight', 'live', 'together', 'HUGE', 'caveat', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'is.While', 'fanservice', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'extreme', 'when', 'character', 'Tina', 'added', 'cast', 'fanservice', 'gratuitous', 'shots', 'girls', 'panties', 'revealing', 'outfits', 'nudity', 'jiggling', 'breasts', 'etc', 'only', 'negative', 'series', 'thought', 'Hand', 'Maid', 'May', 'lot', 'fanservice', 'series', 'TONS', 'more', 'uncalled', 'screws', 'what', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'romantic-comedy.As', 'DVD', 'Pioneer', 'actually', 'one', 'right', 'Usually', 'complain', 'how', 'subtitle', 'titles', 'time', 'use', 'Japanese', 'honorifix', 'subtitles', 'great', 'know', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'honorifix', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'English', 'honorifix', 'are', 'needed', 'understand', 'how', 'characters', 'relate', 'other', 'Japanese', 'are', 'big', 'hierarchy', 'system', 'society', 'Japanese', 'title', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'Japanese', 'general', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'story.The', 'English', 'dub', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'few', 'rough', 'spots', 'especially', 'Tina', 'honorifix', 'survive', 'English', 'dub', 'including', 'sempai', '-dono', 'honorific', 'translated', 'Sir', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'times', '-sama', 'translated', 'Aoi', 'when', 'keeper', 'Lady', 'Aoi', 'times', ""n't"", 'when', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'Kaoru-sama', '-kun', 'suffix', 'dropped', 'totally', 'English', 'dub', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'appreciate', 'attempt', 'Pioneer', 'part.Bottom', 'line', 'Great', 'romance', 'story', 'beat', 'Oh', 'My', 'Goddess', 'excessive', 'fanservice', 'will', 'be', 'turnoff', 'folks', 'who', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'should', 'really', 'appreciate', 'job', 'done', 'here', 'include', 'honorifix', 'Engish', 'dub', 'good', 'too', 'Recommended', 'most', 'anime', 'fans', 'especially', 'who', 'like', 'harem', 'romantic-comedy', 'titles']",N/A

Typical anime where the guy ends up living with a ton of girls and can't make up his mind which one he loves.&quot;Wrong.Ai Yori Aoshi is a refreshing look at the romantic comedy genre. While it is true that there are more girls added to the series, they don't even begin to show up until the fifth episode, by which time, we already know that Aoi and Kaouru are made for each other.Unlike most romantic comedies, Kaouru doesn't suffer from the typical indecisiveness of the standard anime male. In fact, he shows strong resolve. He's a Junior in college, he has his own apartment, and he knows he definitely wants nothing to do with the Hanabishi clan whose patriarch so horribly abused him when he was younger.A man used to lonliness and pain, he remains in good spirits, and Aoi, with her unassuming gentleness, is just the person to be at his side for all time.There's a bizarre sort of sincerity that comes from this series that I've never seen before in other romantic comedy type anime.

731083,A39LRLKACX89IP,B00007L4LG,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[8, 8]","Actually this should rate higher, but I'm averaging it with the rest of the series.  This 26 episode series about first love is played sweet with little conflict.  The only conflict comes at the beginning and then again at series end.  Its hard to dance a plot intended as a romatic comedy on the edge of the knife of tragedy.  It would however, have been nice to see them try.The two characters are brought together in the first few episodes by overly coincidental fate. Then when Aoi won't leave her long lost love, the family sets them up in a controlled living situation.  This obviously a set-up in hopes the unknown relationship will run its course break-up.  Normally I would have expected a lot of ominous meddleing from the family.  Unfortunately the series turned light from here on, giving the traditional comic treatment expected of a situation comedy.  New characters arrive, mostly females to create our situations.  None of which are handled with any seriousness save a few scenes with Aoi.We have the prerequisite animals (a ferret and some cats), the ackward girl with big assets, the standard beach episodes, and some drinking humor.  The standard bag for a light series. You can't help liking the series, but if you're expecting anything new or profound, forget it.  Series turns serious again in last three episodes.  It could have been a classic had episodes 4-21 held the same effort that 1-3 and 22-24 did.  Animation is simple but good, backgrounds are excellent.  Sound and music are both good, but not really special.I've noticed a lot of Japanese anime, the series is mapped from beginning to end.  I wonder about that here.

731085,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00007L4LG,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 2]","Based on Kou Fumizuki's manga series of the same name, Ai Yori Aoshi was animated in a series 24 half hour anime episodes for the first season.  This romantic drama/comedy recounts the reunion of Aoi Sakuraba and Kaoru Hanabishi, betrothed to each other eighteen years ago, when they were both little tykes.  The first five episodes comprise all of the first manga and the first three bits of the second manga.Aoi, now in her twenties, and quite a sweet and cute girl, goes out in search of Kaoru when she discovers their engagement is off, and to find out why.  Dressed in a traditional indigo kimono amid the Western-clothed populace, Aoi is quite bewildered at the Tokyo train station system, as it is her first time out alone. A young man who helps her find the right direction train platform and even mends the strap on her sandal, turns out to be her long lost Kaoru.""When I think of him, I am truly grateful that I was born in this world,"" she tells him before she realizes who he is.  Aoi is the best thing that has happened to Kaoru, as she cooks him all his favourite dishes, dusts, cleans, does his laundry.  It turns out that she paid attention of what he liked-such as his dishes, his favourite colour, and the fact that he liked short hair.  And she is overly polite in her speaking manner; it's heartening.Life hasn't been all roses for Kaoru, though.  He was raised by the rich and powerful Hanabishi clan after his father died, but there was no love there. The overly stern patriarch of the clan beat him severely with a stick, leaving horrible scars on his back.  The experience left him a bitter and distrusting young college student living alone in a small apartment.The two end up setting up house in one of the Sakuraba's unused summer mansions, under the supervision of Miyabi Kagurazaki, the tall stern businesswoman in charge of Aoi's education.  However, in order to prevent a scandal, Aoi must act as the landlady, Miyabi the manager, and Kaoru her tenant.  And Kaoru isn't allowed to be in the mansion after ten, having to trot back to an annex where his room lies.Episode 5 introduces two characters.  Tina Foster, the overly energetic blonde, liquor-guzzling American who speaks with a Hakata dialect, returns after a year of traveling in Africa and South America.  She's quite partial to liquor, and has an awkward way of greeting girls, by squeezing a certain part of their anatomy.  When she does it to Miyabi-san, a whole army of red X's symbolizing anger pop up on her face as she chases Tina around in fury.  Then there's Taeko Minazuki, a clumsy and shy bespectacled sophomore who joined the photo club.  Unfortunately, she's gullible enough to be exploited by Sato, the club VP who's obsessed with cheesecake shots, who tells her it's a first step in photography experience.A few differences in the anime and manga:  in the manga, Tina becomes a tenant in regards to a sign Miyabi posted as a bluff to make the setup legitimate.  Here, she uses more cunning means.  Also, Aoi's mother never speaks to Kaoru here, though in the manga, she apologizes to him for her daughter's naivete in the world.This is probably Ayako Kawasumi's best known voice role as Aoi-chan.  The other big name here is Satsuki Yukino (Tina Foster), who was Mutsumi in Love Hina, and Mayune in Pretear.  And Akiko Hiramitsu (Miyabi) voiced English teacher Yukari Tanizaki in Azumanga Daioh.  One bonus feature is Yoko Ishida's music video of ""Towa No Hana"" or ""Eternal Flower,"" the lovely opening theme for this series.At the end, Aoi says to Kaoru, ""I am not perfect, but please regard me kindly.""

If you check out the rest of the reviews that i have written the majority of them go to romance. Anyways Ai yori aoishi starts off with a girl name Aoi and a boy named Kaoru. Both of them were to become husband and wife as soon as they were old enough, but something happens and Kaoru decides to leave the hanabishi clan. Aoi has been desperately trying to find kaoru wanting to become his wife. It has been her life dream to be with the one whom was so kind to her when they were children.Ep.1 The episode starts off with Kaoru being in college and Aoi being on a train. Aoi has the intention of becoming Kaoru's wife, but thats if he even still remembers her. When Aoi finally arrives to the train station she finds herself living a similar scenery involving her child hood with this young man. This man then decides to take Aoi where she needs to go because based on how she was dressed and how clueless she looked he didnt want her to get lost. In any case it was also on the way to his home. What a coincidence huh? I wont say anymore otherwise Im gonna spoil this episode.Ep. 2 Aoi and Kaoru are reunited and both of them spend the night in Kaoru's room. Since Kaoru has only one futon, being the gentleman that he is he lets Aoi sleep in it. It turns out that Aoi likes to cling onto things in her sleep.....so im gonna leave it at that. In the morning Aoi starts her new life acting as Kaoru's wife, so she decides to cook, clean and do his laundry. After all that it ends with a hilarious scene.Ep. 3 Aoi is confronted by this woman named miyabi and is forced to go back with her to Aoi's family. Since Aoi just ran away to tokyo, Kaoru did not realize that and so when he was asked to go back to the hanabishi clan he just couldnt accept it. In the end Aoi manages to escape and they both return to the place they first met. After that Kaoru comes down with a fever and Aoi ends up taking care of him. We also lean an important part in this episode. It explains why Kaoru took off from the hanabishi clan and In my opinion i would have done the same thing. Then in the end Aoi ends up leaving with her mom, BUT she only left so that she could get her supplies and be back with her beloved husband.Ep.4 Since both Aoi and Kaoru are now living together, the Aoi family decide to move them to a bigger location. Aoi is now acting as a landlord and this is to prevent a huge scandal in the Aoi family because Aoi was supposed to be a girl for the head of the Sakuraba family. So with that in mind lets just say that miyabi changes her mind about how Kaoru is and decides to accept him in a way.Ep.5 The last and final episode. This was an eye opener for me ill admit. It starts off so beautifully with the two couple reunited, but i guess that wasnt the case for this episode. A girl named Tina comes into Kaoru's life once again. So this alone brings many various adventures.In the end I truely enjoyed how this series started. I am looking forward to finishing this anime in my collection and hopefully it ends like it is supposed to. I recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys watching a couple coming together.",5,Just another beautiful anime created,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,3157,"['am', 'sucker', 'romances', 'ill', 'admit', 'check', 'out', 'rest', 'reviews', 'i', 'have', 'written', 'majority', 'go', 'romance', 'Anyways', 'Ai', 'yori', 'aoishi', 'girl', 'name', 'Aoi', 'boy', 'named', 'Kaoru', 'were', 'become', 'husband', 'wife', 'as', 'soon', 'were', 'old', 'enough', 'something', 'happens', 'Kaoru', 'leave', 'hanabishi', 'clan', 'Aoi', 'been', 'desperately', 'trying', 'find', 'kaoru', 'wanting', 'become', 'wife', 'been', 'life', 'dream', 'be', 'one', 'whom', 'was', 'so', 'kind', 'when', 'were', 'children.Ep.1', 'episode', 'Kaoru', 'being', 'college', 'Aoi', 'being', 'train', 'Aoi', 'intention', 'becoming', 'Kaoru', 'wife', 'thats', 'even', 'still', 'When', 'Aoi', 'finally', 'train', 'station', 'living', 'similar', 'scenery', 'involving', 'child', 'hood', 'young', 'man', 'man', 'then', 'take', 'Aoi', 'where', 'go', 'because', 'based', 'how', 'was', 'dressed', 'how', 'clueless', 'looked', 'want', 'get', 'lost', 'case', 'was', 'also', 'way', 'home', 'What', 'coincidence', 'huh', 'wont', 'say', 'anymore', 'otherwise', 'Im', 'gon', 'spoil', 'episode.Ep', '2', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'are', 'reunited', 'spend', 'night', 'Kaoru', 'room', 'Kaoru', 'only', 'one', 'futon', 'being', 'gentleman', 'Aoi', 'sleep', 'out', 'Aoi', 'cling', 'onto', 'things', 'sleep', '..so', 'im', 'gon', 'leave', 'morning', 'Aoi', 'new', 'life', 'acting', 'Kaoru', 'wife', 'cook', 'clean', 'do', 'laundry', 'hilarious', 'scene.Ep', '3', 'Aoi', 'confronted', 'woman', 'named', 'miyabi', 'forced', 'go', 'back', 'Aoi', 'family', 'Aoi', 'just', 'ran', 'away', 'tokyo', 'Kaoru', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'asked', 'go', 'back', 'hanabishi', 'clan', 'just', 'couldnt', 'end', 'Aoi', 'escape', 'return', 'place', 'first', 'met', 'Kaoru', 'down', 'fever', 'Aoi', 'up', 'taking', 'care', 'also', 'lean', 'important', 'part', 'episode', 'why', 'Kaoru', 'took', 'off', 'hanabishi', 'clan', 'opinion', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'thing', 'Then', 'end', 'Aoi', 'up', 'leaving', 'mom', 'BUT', 'only', 'left', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'supplies', 'be', 'back', 'beloved', 'husband.Ep.4', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'together', 'Aoi', 'family', 'decide', 'move', 'bigger', 'location', 'Aoi', 'now', 'acting', 'landlord', 'prevent', 'huge', 'scandal', 'Aoi', 'family', 'Aoi', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'girl', 'head', 'Sakuraba', 'family', 'So', 'mind', 'lets', 'just', 'say', 'miyabi', 'changes', 'mind', 'how', 'Kaoru', 'accept', 'way.Ep.5', 'last', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'eye', 'opener', 'ill', 'admit', 'so', 'beautifully', 'two', 'couple', 'reunited', 'i', 'guess', 'case', 'episode', 'girl', 'named', 'Tina', 'Kaoru', 'life', 'once', 'again', 'alone', 'many', 'various', 'end', 'truely', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'series', 'started', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'finishing', 'anime', 'collection', 'hopefully', 'supposed', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'anyone', 'who', 'watching', 'couple', 'coming', 'together']",N/A

731088,A1YMS2TL8GHA4R,B00007L4LG,Fisket,"[11, 11]","Okay, so this is another series where there are lots of cute girls surrounding a central 'doesn't quite know how to deal with girls' guy figure.  Yes, that's a well-canvassed storyline.  But don't let that basis for Ai Yori Aoshi fool you into thinking it's a same-old same-old.Far from it.Kaoru, our leading guy, has more depth than you may at first give him credit for.  This becomes more apparent as the series progresses, and it's well worth looking out for.As for Aoi- she's quite unlike any anime heroine I've come across before.  She has a strong but lighthearted devotion to Kaoru, and her mission in life is pretty much just to make him happy, thus securing her own happiness.  Again, don't let that fool you.  Her character has a sensitivity and maturity that the typical busty, stick-thin and crazily energetic anime girl lacks.  I found myself growing increasingly attatched to her as a character as the series progressed.The humour is pretty comparable with the usual anime fare- a mix of slapstick and risque situations provide the laughs, and do surprisingly well at it, in fact.Voice acting is good, my only real complaint being that Kaoru and Aoi say each others names a little too often.  I think the cuteness of it lets them off the hook most of the time though.Lighthearted and easy-going?  Yes.Amusing and entertaining?  Indeed so.Addictive?  I found it very addictive myself.  I guess it depends on whether romantic cliff-hangers get you intrigued or not.  They work on me!And the animation is not to be laughed at: it's quite simply beautiful, flawless and fluid and full of gorgeous colours.  A nice feature for any anime.All in all, a charming and adorable series with good character development, a welcome splash of depth, and a knack for knocking you out of complacency every now and then with a surprising reality-check.If you enjoy romantic dramas, and fancy something a little bit different from the norm, I advise you to give this one a go.  You'd be hard pressed to do much better, and you could do a lot worse.Oh, and (importantly, I think) the ending is satisfying and cute.  ^_^",4,Not your average cutesy romance drama,1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,2113,"['Okay', 'series', 'where', 'are', 'lots', 'cute', 'girls', 'surrounding', 'central', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'girls', 'guy', 'figure', 'Yes', 'well-canvassed', 'storyline', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'basis', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'fool', 'thinking', 'same-old', 'same-old.Far', 'it.Kaoru', 'leading', 'guy', 'more', 'depth', 'may', 'first', 'give', 'credit', 'more', 'apparent', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'looking', 'out', 'for.As', 'Aoi-', 'quite', 'anime', 'heroine', ""'ve"", 'come', 'strong', 'lighthearted', 'devotion', 'Kaoru', 'mission', 'life', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'make', 'happy', 'thus', 'securing', 'own', 'happiness', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'character', 'sensitivity', 'maturity', 'typical', 'busty', 'stick-thin', 'crazily', 'energetic', 'anime', 'girl', 'found', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'attatched', 'character', 'series', 'progressed.The', 'humour', 'pretty', 'comparable', 'usual', 'anime', 'fare-', 'mix', 'slapstick', 'risque', 'situations', 'provide', 'laughs', 'do', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'fact.Voice', 'acting', 'good', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'being', 'Kaoru', 'Aoi', 'say', 'others', 'names', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'think', 'cuteness', 'off', 'hook', 'most', 'time', 'though.Lighthearted', 'easy-going', 'Yes.Amusing', 'entertaining', 'Indeed', 'so.Addictive', 'found', 'very', 'addictive', 'guess', 'romantic', 'cliff-hangers', 'get', 'intrigued', 'not', 'work', 'animation', 'not', 'be', 'laughed', 'quite', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'flawless', 'fluid', 'full', 'gorgeous', 'colours', 'nice', 'feature', 'anime.All', 'charming', 'adorable', 'series', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'welcome', 'splash', 'depth', 'knack', 'knocking', 'complacency', 'now', 'then', 'surprising', 'reality-check.If', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'fancy', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'norm', 'advise', 'give', 'one', 'go', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse.Oh', 'importantly', 'think', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'cute', '^_^']",N/A
731089,A26LWI9RAR7RX7,B00007L4LG,In Search Of...,"[4, 4]","Many other reviewers already hit the major points so I won't bother going into all the details. I will however, reiterate some of the points that others have already stated.1) If you do have objections for a woman desiring to be a traditional housewife (Japanese) then you'll dislike this.2) If you have objections to constant emotional love outbursts and subservient apologetic behavior from a girl then you'll dislike this.If that doesn't bother you, then you will absolutely enjoy this show. I have not seen Love Hina yet so I can't compare. I can tell you this though, I was constantly asking myself, is it better to love or be loved?In the case of Kaoru-sama, he is constantly exposed to the latter. After the dissolved arranged marriage from over 18 years, Aoi-chan has gone out of her way to seek out and meet her beloved and find out why he didn't want to marry her. Once their destined meet occurred, Kaoru-sama was overwhelmed with the love that Aoi-chan had to give for a person she hasn't seen for almost 2 decades. The show starts strong in building their relationship but then goes off on a tangent a bit when they start adding the other characters (all females mind you). Each one begins to harbor feelings for Kaoru as they get to spend more time with him. They add plenty of humor as the series goes on. However, the love and support that Aoi-chan provides coupled with Kaoru-sama's honest and gentle nature keeps him in line. Also, each encounter strengthens his growing love for Aoi-chan. For a lack of a better word, there are many ""cheesy"" moments when Aoi-chan demonstrates her love for Kaoru-sama. However, I realized that these cheesy moments is what makes the show so enjoyable.Although the characters are pretty simple in nature, they are very loveable. The character designs are great and the show is set mainly in a bright atmosphere. Ai Yori Aoshi is one of those series that merit viewing again and again. It's a feel-good show with plenty of tender moments. There are definite moments of tragedy when Kaoru's past is re-visited but overall maintains a light-hearted atmosphere. Love conquers all when Aoi enters his life. As strongly as I believe in giving love to one I find closest in my heart, Ai Yori Aoshi makes a stronger argument showing that it is better to be loved.",4,Is it better to love or be loved?,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2306,"['Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'already', 'hit', 'major', 'points', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'going', 'details', 'will', 'however', 'reiterate', 'points', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'stated.1', 'do', 'have', 'objections', 'woman', 'desiring', 'be', 'traditional', 'housewife', 'Japanese', 'then', ""'ll"", 'dislike', 'this.2', 'have', 'objections', 'constant', 'emotional', 'love', 'outbursts', 'subservient', 'apologetic', 'behavior', 'girl', 'then', ""'ll"", 'dislike', 'this.If', ""n't"", 'bother', 'then', 'will', 'absolutely', 'enjoy', 'show', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Love', 'Hina', 'yet', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'constantly', 'asking', 'better', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'case', 'Kaoru-sama', 'constantly', 'exposed', 'latter', 'dissolved', 'arranged', 'marriage', '18', 'years', 'Aoi-chan', 'gone', 'way', 'seek', 'out', 'meet', 'beloved', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'Once', 'destined', 'meet', 'occurred', 'Kaoru-sama', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'love', 'Aoi-chan', 'had', 'give', 'person', ""n't"", 'seen', 'almost', '2', 'decades', 'show', 'strong', 'building', 'relationship', 'then', 'off', 'tangent', 'bit', 'when', 'start', 'adding', 'other', 'characters', 'females', 'one', 'harbor', 'feelings', 'Kaoru', 'get', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'add', 'plenty', 'humor', 'series', 'However', 'love', 'support', 'Aoi-chan', 'coupled', 'Kaoru-sama', 'honest', 'gentle', 'nature', 'line', 'Also', 'encounter', 'growing', 'love', 'Aoi-chan', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'are', 'many', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'when', 'Aoi-chan', 'love', 'Kaoru-sama', 'However', 'realized', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'simple', 'nature', 'are', 'very', 'loveable', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'great', 'show', 'set', 'mainly', 'bright', 'atmosphere', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'one', 'series', 'viewing', 'again', 'again', 'feel-good', 'show', 'plenty', 'tender', 'moments', 'are', 'definite', 'moments', 'tragedy', 'when', 'Kaoru', 'past', 're-visited', 'overall', 'light-hearted', 'atmosphere', 'Love', 'conquers', 'when', 'Aoi', 'life', 'As', 'strongly', 'believe', 'giving', 'love', 'one', 'find', 'closest', 'heart', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'stronger', 'argument', 'showing', 'better', 'be', 'loved']",N/A

731091,ABH9D4KS06KZN,B00007L4LG,khryoleoz,"[3, 4]","I am too familiar with and well aware of the areas in which Ai Yori Aoshi may be criticized. And on an intellectual level I would agree. There is absolutely no purpose to Tina's overtly perverse and rude behavior, which was for all intent a grossly distorted crack at American conduct. Taeko may have been more amiable had the character not been a stereotypical clumsy but well-meaning goof of a beauty who is the most endowed among the cast. And Aoi is so subservient, deferring her own wishes, ambitions and aspirations to a weakling that had abandoned her in the first place that it defies reality and suspends disbelief. And its most significant failing may be said to be its dishonesty. To begin with exposition of a profound romantic premise that after four episodes takes not just a detour, but a full 180-degree turn to become something less and driven by slapstick and fanservice is just deceitful and misleading. As a romantic drama, the title is guilty of all its shortcomings.But what if the original intent had not been to create a romantic drama, but to sell a product that is highly popular among male demographics? And what if success in this business venture was to be found in illustrated literature that falls under a genre in which a harem was not only common, but fundamental? Moreover, what if author and artist Fumizuki Kou was a skilled and gifted writer able to conceive strong situations that test his characters and thus move his readers? And, that despite his need to eat and pay rent or the mortgage, his respect for his own artistry forbids him from producing entirely unsubstantial material, that he devises a plan to bring about warmth, richness, and dimension to the product. And that he does so by setting its foundation on the love of two childhood friends bethrothed to one another but separated by bitter familial politics. But he would decisively and canonically establish an exciting destiny for these two no matter who was thrown in the mix. And to highten and strengthen the dramatic impact, he would develop the two in the most engrossing fashion by sparsely placing throughout the series the tender, touching, inspiring, and captivating moments of intimacy shared between them. And as the two of them engage one another, we are exposed to their thoughts and emotions, raw in the pursuit of the other's well being but founded on a compelling desire to be the source of nourishment to the other. Finally, their interaction would be pure, honest, mutually exclusive, and courageously untainted by any form of wanton and gratuitous sexual provacation (Tina's antics notwithstanding) as is common in today's smut being passed off as romance. What if the powerful romantic elements of Ai Yori Aoshi was merely a component used to enrich the product belonging to a genre from which there certainly was no shortage?This is how I view Ai Yori Aoshi. It is an enjoyable harem anime based on a fine manga. As a harem anime, it would then be expected for one male to end up in situations where he is living with many women. Yet, the title sets itself apart in execution, as it profoundly explores and develops that romantic component that was sorely neglected in Love Hina and diverted away from in Tenchi. It is also ludicrous to judge the character of Aoi Sakuraba in light of western upbringing and not consider the cultural context from which she was conceived. Whatever it is that one may say about her only demonstrates one's position about the culture, and not fallacies about her conception. The Aoi and Kaoru moments were few indeed, but they were moving and utterly delightful, and their rareness made them all the more special when they did occur. I have nothing but the deepest affection and fondness for Ai Yori Aoshi.

It is so kind and sweet you would think it would be syrupy, but somehow ai yori aoshi manages to balance the underlying story of two soulmates growing together with conflict that is far from earth-shaking but somehow reads more true for it's trivial, day-to-day nature.Along the way you get an intriguing glimpse at the last remains of feudal/traditional japan through the two protagonists, particularly the character Aoi. The interest is greater because of the setting, a modern day Tokyo where Aoi's traditional mannerisims and garb are just unusual enough to generate interest. Aoi's ""I exist for my man"" attitude suprisingly failed to offend my more feminist-minded friends, perhaps because of her traditional background, or maybe because it's clear that Aoi has made a concious choice to live that way... I don't know, but it works and isn't offensive.And none of what I'm saying does Ai Yori Aoshi justice. Let me put it this way. If you watch this series you will feel happy. And the feeling grows as you get further into it. You can watch trusting that in the end, things will be ok. Unless you have a heart of flint, ai yori aoshi will reach you.

This is all Aoi wants to be: the wife of Kaoru, to whom she was arranged to be married as a child.  Kaoru left his family (for reasons made clear), but Aoi still loved him.  Therein is the heart and warmth of this show: there is no doubt that Aoi and Kaoru will be together throughout once they meet again.Only in the last episode on this disc (which has 5 episodes) does Ai Yori Aoshi reveal itself to be a &quot;harem&quot; show--Kaoru starts finding a lot of girls around him and ultimately, living in the same house.  In its dynamics, though, Ai Yori Aoshi differs from many of the other harem shows that have been imported from Japan recently--in Love Hina, for example, one thing or another keeps interrupting Naru and Keitaro's romance.  Here, that's not the issue.The humor in this show depends on Aoi and Kaoru learning about each other.  Because there's no real conflict between the two, Ai Yori Aoshi may not be quite as funny as a Love Hina or a few others, but it manages to hold its own in the laughs department.  More importantly, it is simply pleasant to watch.  Aoi, who in a lesser show might have come off as spineless, drives the story with her efforts to make her dream come true.  Barring an ideological problem with her domesticity, Aoi is more than reason enough to want to see more of this show.  It is when she is not on-screen (particularly when the decidedly unpleasant Tina is), that the show suffers.  Fortunately, Aoi is (and hopefully will remain throughout) the focus.One warning to close: there's a fair bit of fanservice here, and this release is based off the Japanese home video release, which added some nudity.  It's all featureless (nothing's drawn in) and brief, but it's there, for those who want to avoid such things.",4,A romantic comedy that's both funny and pleasant,1046131200,"02 25, 2003",2003,1918,"['Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'warning', 'open', 'find', 'idea', 'woman', 'wanting', 'be', 'traditional', 'housewife', 'be', 'somehow', 'repulsive', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'show', 'Aoi', 'be', 'wife', 'Kaoru', 'whom', 'was', 'arranged', 'be', 'married', 'child', 'Kaoru', 'left', 'family', 'reasons', 'made', 'clear', 'Aoi', 'still', 'loved', 'Therein', 'heart', 'warmth', 'show', 'doubt', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'will', 'be', 'together', 'once', 'meet', 'again.Only', 'last', 'episode', 'disc', '5', 'episodes', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'reveal', 'be', 'quot', 'quot', 'show', 'Kaoru', 'finding', 'lot', 'girls', 'ultimately', 'living', 'same', 'house', 'dynamics', 'though', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'differs', 'many', 'other', 'harem', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'imported', 'Japan', 'recently', 'Love', 'Hina', 'example', 'one', 'thing', 'keeps', 'interrupting', 'Naru', 'Keitaro', 'romance', 'Here', 'not', 'issue.The', 'humor', 'show', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'learning', 'other', 'real', 'conflict', 'two', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'Love', 'Hina', 'few', 'others', 'hold', 'own', 'laughs', 'department', 'More', 'importantly', 'simply', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'Aoi', 'who', 'lesser', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'spineless', 'story', 'efforts', 'make', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Barring', 'ideological', 'problem', 'domesticity', 'Aoi', 'more', 'reason', 'enough', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'show', 'when', 'not', 'on-screen', 'particularly', 'when', 'decidedly', 'unpleasant', 'Tina', 'show', 'suffers', 'Fortunately', 'Aoi', 'hopefully', 'will', 'remain', 'focus.One', 'warning', 'close', 'fair', 'bit', 'fanservice', 'here', 'release', 'based', 'off', 'Japanese', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'added', 'nudity', 'featureless', 'nothing', 'drawn', 'brief', 'there', 'who', 'want', 'avoid', 'such', 'things']",N/A

Yet, she has an assertiveness that helps her overcome the bias of her character and helps to round out a very powerful role in the story.Sadly the story falls into some way-too-easy comedic trappings with the 5th episode by introducing the harem aspect of the series with Tina, the &quot;American&quot;.  Don't worry though, she will behave herself later.Aside from the culture-shock and boobie-humor that this series contains, there is a good strong beginning to a heart warming and against-all-odds love affair between the main characters.Also:  Look out for the nudity.

Perhaps, this series should be used as the reference to Japanese culture and its psyche instead of fun anime.If you watched plenty of animes (most of viewers did, I assume), this is not very hard to understand.  In basic, this follows the predictable plot, with bunch of girls around the main character, love triangle, etc.  Problem is that whole ingredients are combined in very sloppy manner.First of all, the characters do not possess strong personality.  Most of them are either cliche, too goody, or both.  It is just not fun to watch them, especially when filler episodes occupies 2/3 of whole series.Second, cultural references are too strong.  Many animes possess some cliche that has to be viewed over to understand, but this is full of them.  Aoi's character is merely thin disguise of spineless women which is sure to offend many people (At least in Love Hina, Naru had mighty punch to blow at Keitaro).  This might be the perfect portraight of Geisha in which Western people would think (which is very inaccurate).If you have good understanding of Japanese culture, this series can be enjoyable, but not by much.
