302895,A402IK8HX9SBN,6302230519,"Alex Lovejoy ""Alex""","[2, 2]","Reviewing slasher flicks is not unlike reviewing fast food ... it's not SUPPOSED to be good for you or even all that tasty ... it's just supposed to satisfy your need for something trashy and gratifying and cheap.  If that doesn't make sense to you, then neither will slasher movies.  They're a kind of guilty pleasure movie that we're not SUPPOSED to enjoy (according to polite society) ... but some of us do anyway.  So I don't see any point in pretending that these movies are great cinema or that they ever even aspire to be.  They're cinematic junk food ... so sit back, relax and enjoy ... or just don't bother.With that said, is there such a thing as a ""better"" or ""worse"" slasher movie? Of course.  But since even seekers of guilty pleasures are looking for different pleasures (pretty women, naked women, horror, gore, terror, violence) and suffering from different kinds of guilt (pretty girl guilt, nudity guilt, violence guilt, etc.), the notion that there is a universally good or bad slasher flick is just as pointless as the notion that we should all eat one flavor of ice cream.  Personal preferences are just that ... personal ... and preferences.  And what sort of personal preferences is this movie likely to satisfy and disappoint?Of the three SPM movies this is the one I enjoyed the most, which is only to say that its blend of guilty pleasures suited me best ... and Hope Marie Carlton (Playboy late 80's and early 90's and other vehicles) certainly had something to do with that.  She was a favorite of mine ""back in the day"".  To me, the faux violence of this film was a bit edgier than in previous ""driller"" movies, and pushed my personal buttons more effectively than the previous flicks, but that's not really saying much as none of these films is all that graphic.

302898,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6302230519,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[3, 5]","Slumber Party Massacre III (1990), the third, and final (?) installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series, sees, in my perception, an attempt to return to that which made the original what it was...what that is you should probably decide for yourself, but do know that generally, people who liked the first and third film generally disliked the second, and vice versa.  At the very least they did manage to bring one element back, that being the boobage content that was sorely lacking from the second film.  Now, before you label me some kind of misogynistic cro-mag type, know that each and all of these films were, in fact, written and directed by...women.  That being the case, it should also be noted that they were all produced by a man, that of Roger Corman, so essentially he had final say, for whatever that's worth...I wouldn't doubt Corman purposely chose female writers and directors specifically to insulate himself against accusations of misogyny.  Written by Harvard grad Catherine Cyran (Bloodfist II), I bet your parents were proud to know their money wasn't wasted, and directed by Sally Mattison, her lone directorial credit, the film stars Keely Christian (Hollywood Boulevard II), Maria Ford (Alien Terminator), Brandi (that's Brandi with an `I') Burkett (My Boyfriend's Back), and former playmate Hope Marie Carlton (Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College)...I swear, there must be a clause somewhere that requires a former playmate to appear in each one of these films....not that I'm complaining.  Also appearing is Maria Claire (Society), David Lawrence (Back Woods), David Greenlee (Iron Eagle), David Kriegel (Alive), and Brittain Frye (Hide and Go Shriek).The film begins on a beach, as we see young people playing volleyball.  There are some awkward introductions, and it seems Jackie (Christian) is the focal character as her parents are out of town and she's planning on having the girls over for a sleepover.  Also, we're supposed to believe all are high school students, but that aspect is never focused on too much as its completely unbelievable (they all look to be in their mid 20s).  We see some weird looking guy dressed in black spying on the group, and he does pop up later in the film, but his character has no point whatsoever other than that of a completely stupid red herring, so I figure he was a friend of the director or related to someone...regardless...soon we see a girl not with the group getting drilled (not in the good way) in her car in a seemingly unrelated scene, then we see the original group leaving the beach, and we're treated to a pointless driving montage in a Chrysler Le Baron convertible, followed by a shower scene with Jackie sans any view of her goodies...booo!  Later that evening the girls arrive, some stuff happens, and a couple of them begin stripping...woo hoo!  I'll tell you what, that Maria Ford has very large areolas...the boys crash the party, get kicked out, creepy weirdo skulks around outside, the group nerd shows up, hey, there's a spear gun in the basement...I bet that will come into play later.  Some murders occur outside the house performed by a seemingly separate weirdo, one wearing a hooded sweatshirt, baggy pants, and a clear, plastic mask...man, this is getting confusing...especially when you toss in a creepy, voyeuristic neighbor.  About an hour in the killer is revealed (rather unspectacularly), and, well...the film goes pretty much the way you'd expect...There seemed to be no connection with this film to earlier films in terms of characters or story, other than the fact the killer her used a big old industrial drill, so this seemed a sequel only by the fact of the title itself.  As I mentioned earlier, there's a sense of effort here to be more like the original film, in that of heaving cleavage, a big house, lotsa blood, and a high body count (my clicker stopped at eleven), but some elements were lost.  There were just way too many pointless characters running around this damn film, which resulted in the appearance of the writer obviously (in a pathetic sort of way) trying to throw the viewer off track as to the identity of the killer.  Believe it or not, there is a delicate balance in these films in terms of the number of characters in that you can have a lot of them and make it work, if the writing is solid, which it isn't here.  The problem is when you have so many (along with weak writing), the audience never cozies up to any of them, and doesn't care who gets kakked.  Another aspect that annoyed me is once the killer is revealed, his motivations are never clearly defined, other than the fact he is your run of the mill psychotic murderer with a troubled past, who enjoys using a large drill to bore holes into people he has little, or no, connection to...I wasn't expecting any in-depth dissertation of his motivations, but gimme something.  The killer does seem to have a real hate/hate relationship with lamps, lighting fixtures, and closet doors.  The dialog is particularly rotten, along with the acting, but the direction is pretty decent.  The kill scenes, while bloody, were fairly unimaginative probably due mostly to the fact the whole `driller killer' motif has since been played out this being the third entry in the series.  How many times can you see someone get impaled or slashed by a huge drill?  Another thing missing from this film is the unintentional humor present within the first, and slightly so in the second.  Here everything is played fairly straight up, and suffers so when compared to the others (actually the first was played straight up also, but given the intent of the writer of that one, and the subsequent changes by the producers after the fact, it came off as being funny).  There was a bit of humor in that the killer suffered much physical abuse throughout the last part of the film as he's stabbed, blinded, shot with a spear gun, and bashed on the head numerous times only to keep coming back for more.  One sequence that stood out is when the recently blinded killer is fondling an injured victim on the floor and three of the women who are left are standing around watching rather than helping their friend.  Real nice...hopefully they'll be in the same position some day for someone to return the favor.  All in all a weak film, loaded up with lots of victims and blood, and some decent T (but not a lot of A).The fullscreen picture quality on this DVD was decent, but I thought the audio was a bit poor, which seemed not something lacking from the transfer, but more inherent within the original audio recording.  Special features include a trailer for the film, biographies, and previews for other films including Slumber Party Massacre (1982), Slumber Party Massacre II (1987), and Emmanuelle: First Contact (2000)...why this last one was included is beyond me, as it's a soft core movie rather than a slasher flick.  Also, if you want to keep the identity of the killer a secret prior to actually watching the movie, avoid looking at the back of the DVD case.  There are four pictures present, three of which are from other films, while the fourth, actually relating to this film, shows you who the killer is...kudos to the boneheads at New Horizons Home Video, the company that released this DVD, for their thoughtful packaging...and who's the joker who wrote the synopsis on the back of the DVD case?  They obviously didn't see the film, as they funked up a number of details.Cookieman108By the way, here's a tip...unplug all electrical devices near the bathtub before actually getting in, including

The humor of the first movie and the cheesy fun of  SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE II are no where to be seen as the killer rapes,  beats and mutilates his victims.  This can be taken in two ways: 1. it's  and effective ode to the horror of early 1970's exploitation pics which  does a successful job of making the viewer cringe and feel uncomfortable or  2. is just sick sadism.

Their boyfriends show up to try and scare them, but out in the darkness lurks a homicidal maniac with a power drill who takes advantage of the situation.This film was the one and only directorial effort of Sally Mattison, and the script was written by Catherine Cyran, which made me sit up a bit when the opening credits rolled by because I was curious as to how a sex & slasher flick that was directed and written by women was going to be different from the normal voyeuristic approach employed by their male counterparts.  Now that I have seen the movie I find it hard to believe that I have gained any insights into what young women do when they play ""truth or dare"" by themselves.  Then again, women have never been the target audience for these movies.  This is just another instance when I tried to have a semi-deep thought about this film and was brought back to some semblance of reality when such thoughts spiraled out of control.Once again the soft core elements in ""Slumber Party"" outweigh the blood and gore of the ""Massacre,"" but neither justifies getting this far into the series.  Watching the first one twice would be better because the second time around you could read a book or pick up stuff around the room.  It was a toss up as to whether this film was better or worse than the previous installment, ""Slumber Part Massacre 2,"" and I ended up going with this one because it had more violations of my personal rules of things to do when a mass murderer is in your house and because I was rather offended by the revelation of the killer's motivation.  You do not watch these sorts of movies for social relevance.  Dismissing this film as a rehash of the first two is rather a moot point because if your title has ""Slumber Party"" and ""Massacre"" in it there is little reason to expect creativity in terms of the plot.  The killings are your one chance at being artistic, so to speak, and there is nothing special here in that regard.  The first killing is the best of the bunch and then the film deteriorates.Final Note: If there were scenes where (a) the killer went out and nailed shut every door leading out of this house and (b) the teenagers tried every door and found it nailed shut, then I must have missed them, which is strange because I do not normally fall asleep during movies.  The victims in this film are definitely Top 10 nominees for stupidest teenagers in a splatter flick.  There is only so many times you can yell ""OPEN...THE...DOOR!"" at the screen before your voice gives out.",2,This time the Slumber Party is at a beach house  (yawn),1069113600,"11 18, 2003",2003,2807,"['Predictability', 'up', 'being', 'virtue', 'rather', 'sin', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Massacre', '3', '1990', 'film', 'was', 'third', 'installment', 'original', 'trilogy', 'repeating', 'same', 'story', 'counts', 'trilogy', 'young', 'girl', 'slumber', 'party', 'girlfriends', 'parent', 'beach', 'house', 'boyfriends', 'show', 'up', 'try', 'scare', 'darkness', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'power', 'drill', 'who', 'advantage', 'situation.This', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Sally', 'Mattison', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Catherine', 'Cyran', 'made', 'sit', 'up', 'bit', 'when', 'opening', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'sex', 'slasher', 'flick', 'was', 'directed', 'written', 'women', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'normal', 'voyeuristic', 'approach', 'employed', 'male', 'counterparts', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'have', 'gained', 'insights', 'what', 'young', 'women', 'do', 'when', 'play', 'truth', 'dare', 'Then', 'again', 'women', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'target', 'audience', 'movies', 'just', 'instance', 'when', 'tried', 'have', 'semi-deep', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'semblance', 'reality', 'when', 'such', 'thoughts', 'spiraled', 'control.Once', 'again', 'soft', 'core', 'elements', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'blood', 'gore', 'Massacre', 'justifies', 'getting', 'far', 'series', 'Watching', 'first', 'one', 'twice', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'could', 'read', 'book', 'pick', 'up', 'stuff', 'room', 'was', 'toss', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'worse', 'previous', 'installment', 'Slumber', 'Part', 'Massacre', '2', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'one', 'had', 'more', 'violations', 'personal', 'rules', 'things', 'do', 'when', 'mass', 'murderer', 'house', 'was', 'rather', 'offended', 'revelation', 'killer', 'motivation', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'sorts', 'movies', 'social', 'relevance', 'Dismissing', 'film', 'rehash', 'first', 'two', 'rather', 'moot', 'point', 'title', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Massacre', 'little', 'reason', 'expect', 'creativity', 'terms', 'plot', 'killings', 'are', 'one', 'chance', 'being', 'artistic', 'so', 'speak', 'nothing', 'special', 'here', 'regard', 'first', 'killing', 'best', 'bunch', 'then', 'film', 'deteriorates.Final', 'Note', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'killer', 'went', 'nailed', 'shut', 'door', 'leading', 'house', 'b', 'teenagers', 'tried', 'door', 'found', 'nailed', 'shut', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'strange', 'do', 'not', 'normally', 'fall', 'asleep', 'movies', 'victims', 'film', 'are', 'definitely', 'Top', '10', 'nominees', 'stupidest', 'teenagers', 'splatter', 'flick', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'yell', 'OPEN', 'THE', 'DOOR', 'screen', 'voice', 'out']",Slumber Party Massacre 3 VHS

Little do they know a wierdo has followed them home. As the party begins, the girls drink beer, a wierd neighbour spys on them and the freak from the beach hangs around outside spying on them. The guys turn up to scare the girls and get invited to the party. One of the girls invites a guy named Ken that she meet on the beach to the party. Before long a dead body is found in the closit and the girls panic. It's not long before they are all being chased by a psycho wielding a drill.  WOW, I truly loved Slumber Party Massacre III, it was a great movie, but I had to look past a few things, most of the girls and guys could not act, the charicter where very stupid, they kept knocking out the killer then running off, leaving him to get up and resume killing. If you look past the stupidity of this movie you begin to see how much fun it is. The twist with this one is that the killer is one of the teenagers, or one of the weirdos, we don't find out until halfway through, the killer also has more of a charicter, he isn't just an escaped mental person, or someone that just desided to show up for no reason. The is alot of gore in this movie (and I saw the cut version) the deaths arn't all drills, there is a chainsaw and even a for sale sign comes into play. Over all this is the best of the three, many might disagree with me, but it's my opinion and I love this trilogy and I think the third is the best.",5,The Driller Killer is back to slash more teens,981158400,"02 3, 2001",2001,1514,"['hard', 'day', 'partying', 'beach', 'group', 'girls', 'head', 'Jackies', 'house', 'slumber', 'party', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'wierdo', 'followed', 'home', 'party', 'girls', 'drink', 'beer', 'wierd', 'neighbour', 'spys', 'freak', 'beach', 'spying', 'guys', 'turn', 'up', 'scare', 'girls', 'get', 'invited', 'party', 'One', 'girls', 'guy', 'named', 'Ken', 'meet', 'beach', 'party', 'long', 'dead', 'body', 'found', 'closit', 'girls', 'panic', 'not', 'long', 'are', 'being', 'chased', 'psycho', 'wielding', 'drill', 'WOW', 'truly', 'loved', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Massacre', 'III', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'had', 'look', 'few', 'things', 'most', 'girls', 'guys', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'charicter', 'where', 'very', 'stupid', 'kept', 'knocking', 'out', 'killer', 'then', 'running', 'off', 'leaving', 'get', 'up', 'resume', 'killing', 'look', 'stupidity', 'movie', 'begin', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'twist', 'one', 'killer', 'one', 'teenagers', 'one', 'weirdos', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'halfway', 'killer', 'also', 'more', 'charicter', ""n't"", 'just', 'escaped', 'mental', 'person', 'someone', 'just', 'desided', 'show', 'up', 'reason', 'alot', 'gore', 'movie', 'saw', 'cut', 'version', 'deaths', 'ar', ""n't"", 'drills', 'chainsaw', 'even', 'sale', 'sign', 'play', 'best', 'three', 'many', 'might', 'disagree', 'opinion', 'love', 'trilogy', 'think', 'third', 'best']",Slumber Party Massacre 3 VHS

Originally supposed to be a seperate flick from the SLUMBER series, New Concorde decided to squeeze some juice out of this one. Thus my review of SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE III.Jackie invites her vollyball teammates over her house for some summer night slumber party fun. Once again, the party is crashed by some horny guys. The group is having a lot of fun. However, one of the guys trys is a maniac with the huge power drill that this series is well known for. There are a lot of key suspects in the film. And you never know who is the killer (yes, the series had to resort to the unmasking crap) until it starts to get really bloody.It's good fun because of the fact that the entire movie seems like a chase scene and that happens to be a favorite of mine. Especially since they are trapped in the house and can't get help.A great things for fans to note that despite the cover's ""R"" rating, this is actually the unrated version with 7 extra minutes included. There is more gore and a few more scenes that have little to do with the plot.
