905800,A178KV00J5LEKS,B0009I7NFS,"Blindguy07 ""Bob""","[5, 5]","This Dvd contains the Two-part finale of Season three, Exodus.  This is it.  For months, the Shredder has been collecting alien technology and the turtles have discovered what he plans to do with it.  He plans to board a starship and conqur the Utrom homeworld.  So our heroes take the fight to their most powerful enemy.  But Agent Bishop decides that he has a say in all this as well, so the action heats up even more.  It all comes down to one final decisive battle, but it is it one our green teens can win?Stop reading now if you don't want to have the rest of the episodes spoiled.  I have to say that I love this new Shredder.  I mean, I'll always enjoy the Shredder of my youth.  The old Tmnt 1987 Shredder, but this guy...  He doesn't play around.  He's the type of villain who makes you love to hate him because of his actions.  He's not your normal Saturday morning cartoon villain.  I mean, he broke both of Mikey's legs.  Burnt Splinter pretty bad.  Knocked Leonardo onto Karai's sword and caused him to be stabbed.  I hope this isn't the last we see of Shredder.  Karai makes a good stand in, but no one kicks shell like our man Saki.  And having the turtles basicly lose the fight was interesting.  You always expect the good guys to win in fights with villains, but this wasn't the case.  Yeah, the turtles did win, but they got the living mess beat out of them.This dvd also includes a few episodes from Season Iv.  Cousin Sid, Dragon's Brew, and Bad day.  The last two are wonderful.  Bad Day especially because we get a bit of foreshadowing concerning the foot mystics and Karai that's very important later on in the season.  Also, we get our first look at the Heart of Tengu.  I'd not seen this ep before I watched Good Geens, but now I understand how it all fits together.Ok, so this Dvd's a must have for the Tmnt 2003 animated series fan.  So I strongly suggest you buy it.",5,Its a final battle between the Shredder and the Turtles!

While I enjoyed some aspects of the classic show, this new series easily puts it to shame. The old show was comedy with some action but fortunately now it's the other way around. I highly recommend it to fans of other shows like Justice League Unlimited, The Batman, or Wolverine & the X-men. The only downside here is that there's no interesting special features.",4,GREATEST ANIMATED SERIES OF ALL TIME,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,546,"['so', 'far', 'best', 'show', 'continuously', 'intriguing', 'storyline', 'action', 'superb', 'character', 'driven', 'dynamics', 'show', 'appeal', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'enjoyed', 'aspects', 'classic', 'show', 'new', 'series', 'easily', 'shame', 'old', 'show', 'was', 'comedy', 'action', 'fortunately', 'now', 'other', 'way', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'other', 'shows', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'Batman', 'Wolverine', 'X-men', 'only', 'downside', 'here', 'interesting', 'special', 'features']",N/A
905803,A1ELM0GEXEAM79,B0009I7NFS,"Christopher P. Cecena ""ssjanifan""","[1, 14]","Although I always preferred the original TMNT show to the new one(the new show has to rely on flatulence jokes?  Please), I always felt the new one was decent.  However, since midway through the 3rd season, I have noticed that the quality of the show has been dropping much recently.  Whereas seasons 1, 2, and the first half of season 3 were very dark and action packed, since then the show has become so childish and pathetic that it made seasons 3-7 of the old TMNT cartoon seem gloomy and depressing.  There was one exception though: one episode which featured Donatello stuck in a nightmarish reality where Shredder ruled the Earth(think the old TMNT episode Shredderville on acid), and provided a very dark, disturbing look at what would happen if the Turtles would fail.  That one in particular seemed to set the stage for the ultimate battle between Shredder and the Turtles, which was slated to occur at season 3's finale, and it started to become clear that not everyone would survive this hectic battle.  And what do we get in return?  A big ripoff.The Turtles attempt to sacrifice themselves to stop the Shredder is main pointless, as the Utroms come in and save them at the last second.  Shredder, instead of dying(and this cartoon is supposed to ""follow"" the comic!), just gets exiled, leaving it perfectly open for a return.  Bishop is completely wasted.  Baxter has become increasingly annoying as the series has gone on(a huge muscular robot?  Once again, please).  Hun seems to buy it, but is proven to be alive and well in season 4.  Thanks for ruining the new TMNT show, 4Kids, just like you've ruined everything.",1,The ultimate cop out.,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,1633,"['always', 'preferred', 'original', 'TMNT', 'show', 'new', 'one', 'new', 'show', 'rely', 'flatulence', 'jokes', 'Please', 'always', 'felt', 'new', 'one', 'was', 'decent', 'However', 'midway', '3rd', 'season', 'have', 'noticed', 'quality', 'show', 'been', 'dropping', 'much', 'recently', 'Whereas', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'first', 'half', 'season', '3', 'were', 'very', 'dark', 'action', 'packed', 'then', 'show', 'become', 'so', 'childish', 'pathetic', 'made', 'seasons', '3-7', 'old', 'TMNT', 'cartoon', 'seem', 'gloomy', 'depressing', 'was', 'one', 'exception', 'one', 'episode', 'featured', 'Donatello', 'stuck', 'nightmarish', 'reality', 'where', 'Shredder', 'ruled', 'Earth', 'think', 'old', 'TMNT', 'episode', 'Shredderville', 'acid', 'provided', 'very', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'look', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Turtles', 'would', 'fail', 'one', 'particular', 'seemed', 'set', 'stage', 'ultimate', 'battle', 'Shredder', 'Turtles', 'was', 'slated', 'occur', 'season', '3', 'finale', 'started', 'become', 'clear', 'not', 'everyone', 'would', 'survive', 'hectic', 'battle', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'return', 'big', 'ripoff.The', 'Turtles', 'attempt', 'sacrifice', 'stop', 'Shredder', 'main', 'pointless', 'Utroms', 'come', 'save', 'last', 'second', 'Shredder', 'instead', 'dying', 'cartoon', 'supposed', 'follow', 'comic', 'just', 'exiled', 'leaving', 'perfectly', 'open', 'return', 'Bishop', 'completely', 'wasted', 'Baxter', 'become', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'series', 'gone', 'huge', 'muscular', 'robot', 'Once', 'again', 'please', 'buy', 'proven', 'be', 'alive', 'well', 'season', '4', 'Thanks', 'ruining', 'new', 'TMNT', 'show', '4Kids', 'just', ""'ve"", 'ruined', 'everything']",N/A
905804,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0009I7NFS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","I really haven't raved about an American action-oriented cartoon (that can be enjoyed by children and adults) since the 90's with  possibly X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman.But I recently have been taking notes with the great writing for cartoons such as JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED and TEEN TITANS and another one to add to this list is TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.No, this is not the same (lame) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that aired back in the 90's.  This time around, it's much more action-oriented and also at times, serious in nature.In the TMNT: Ways of the Warrior DVD featuring Shredder's Final Countdown, this is the DVD where it's an all out fight fest to the end between the Turtles and Shredder (for now).I was a bit surprised with the the ""EXODUS"" storyline as Splinter and the turtles do what they can to stop Shredder by shooting him multiple times with arrows, using their weapons to injure him (ie. stabbing him with the sai's) and even seeing the Turtles actually getting hurt big time!The show is definitely more character driven and perhaps even darker and using less of the ""hey dude! I want to eat pizza"" that clogged our television sets in the 90's.The DVD is quite simple with five episodes, trailers to other TMNT releases and that's pretty much it.So, why get this DVD?  Well, for one it's under $10 and most of all to finally see Shredder getting his own personal butt kicking which was long overdue.",5,Shredder meet Karma...,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,1425,"['really', 'have', ""n't"", 'raved', 'American', 'action-oriented', 'cartoon', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'children', 'adults', '90', 'possibly', 'X-Men', 'Spider-Man', 'Batman.But', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'notes', 'great', 'writing', 'cartoons', 'such', 'JUSTICE', 'LEAGUE', 'UNLIMITED', 'TEEN', 'TITANS', 'one', 'add', 'list', 'TEENAGE', 'MUTANT', 'NINJA', 'TURTLES.No', 'not', 'same', 'lame', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'aired', 'back', '90', 'time', 'around', 'much', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'also', 'times', 'serious', 'TMNT', 'Ways', 'Warrior', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'Shredder', 'Final', 'Countdown', 'DVD', 'where', 'out', 'fight', 'fest', 'end', 'Turtles', 'Shredder', 'now', '.I', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'EXODUS', 'storyline', 'Splinter', 'turtles', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'stop', 'Shredder', 'shooting', 'multiple', 'times', 'arrows', 'using', 'weapons', 'injure', 'ie', 'stabbing', 'sai', 'even', 'seeing', 'Turtles', 'actually', 'getting', 'hurt', 'big', 'time', 'show', 'definitely', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'perhaps', 'even', 'darker', 'using', 'less', 'hey', 'dude', 'want', 'eat', 'pizza', 'clogged', 'television', 'sets', ""90's.The"", 'DVD', 'quite', 'simple', 'five', 'episodes', 'trailers', 'other', 'TMNT', 'releases', 'pretty', 'much', 'it.So', 'why', 'get', 'DVD', 'Well', 'one', '10', 'most', 'finally', 'see', 'Shredder', 'getting', 'own', 'personal', 'butt', 'kicking', 'was', 'long', 'overdue']",N/A
