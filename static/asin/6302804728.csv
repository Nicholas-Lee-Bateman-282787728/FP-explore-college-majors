336928,A3SXUYW79YSE0A,6302804728,Allan G. Potts,"[1, 1]","This movie is the very-top-of-the-line in horse-movie-entertainment! I would like to see it remastered digimaticaly in DVD. Ward Bond and all are superb in this light-hearted movie for children of all ages; that's right, for adults too!, especially!Moreover, I would also like to see ""Another Man, Another Chance"" (the English title) with James Caan and G. Bujold also remastered into an English DVD! It is a superb movie, just bleep out the first two or three minutes with the nonsensical swear words, totally unnessasary, unwarranted and unneeded; the movie carries itself with extremely fine acting. I understand that the French version, ""Another Man, Another Woman"" is in DVD; it is one of the finest westerns, by a French Director, at least one French actress and the violence and western folklore is foretold in an incredibly delightful way. I want an English copy on DVD! I am a western DVD collector and rate this above mentioned flix along with ""Lonesome Dove"" . . . ""True Grit"" . . . ""Tombstone"" . . . ""Wyatt Earp"" . . . ""Unforgiven"" . . . ""The Longriders"" . . . ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" . . . ""Outlaw Josey Wells""; except, the Frenchman does it with less blood and guts--I can live with it as it's done nicely and it's not left out--imagination--that's the key. The lovely G. Bujold, with her original French-Canadian accent is and sounds lovely, absolutely a French doll--forgive me Sussanne Pleshette and Claudine Longet.AG Potts.",5,"Gypsy Colt VHS,  wish it were a DVD; more westerns",1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,1450,"['movie', 'very-top-of-the-line', 'horse-movie-entertainment', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'remastered', 'digimaticaly', 'DVD', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'are', 'superb', 'light-hearted', 'movie', 'children', 'ages', 'right', 'adults', 'too', 'especially', 'Moreover', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'see', 'Man', 'Chance', 'English', 'title', 'James', 'Caan', 'G.', 'Bujold', 'also', 'remastered', 'English', 'DVD', 'superb', 'movie', 'just', 'bleep', 'out', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'minutes', 'nonsensical', 'swear', 'words', 'totally', 'unnessasary', 'unwarranted', 'unneeded', 'movie', 'extremely', 'fine', 'acting', 'understand', 'French', 'version', 'Man', 'Woman', 'DVD', 'one', 'finest', 'westerns', 'French', 'Director', 'least', 'one', 'French', 'actress', 'violence', 'western', 'folklore', 'foretold', 'incredibly', 'delightful', 'way', 'want', 'English', 'copy', 'DVD', 'am', 'western', 'DVD', 'collector', 'rate', 'mentioned', 'flix', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'True', 'Grit', 'Tombstone', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Unforgiven', 'Longriders', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wells', 'Frenchman', 'less', 'blood', 'guts', 'can', 'live', 'done', 'nicely', 'not', 'left', 'out', 'imagination', 'key', 'lovely', 'G.', 'Bujold', 'original', 'French-Canadian', 'accent', 'lovely', 'absolutely', 'French', 'doll', 'forgive', 'Sussanne', 'Pleshette', 'Claudine', 'Longet.AG', 'Potts']",N/A

Spring of 1953 she had a little Filly (Shetland) and I named her Gypsy Colt. I had seen the movie of Gypsy Colt and was so moved by the story, I never forgot it. Not even today, it always remained my favorite Horse movie. I was 12 yr old when ""my"" Gypsy Colt was born. My parents seperated in 1953 and divorced in 1954. In 1971 I was reunited with both Lady and Gypsy. By then I was married and had two children. My daughter learned to ride on Gypsy Colt-bareback. I still had Gypsy in the early 1980's. The movie of Gypsy Colt was such a moving, sad and then happy ending, story. Gypsy Colt loved that little girl so much, nothing could keep him from her, and his love was returned ten fold by Meg. Gypsy was a beautiful Black Stallion with some white on his pasterns. That coloring has always been my favorite, black with the white markings on his legs. I wish it could be bought in DVD. It was a wonderful story and carried so much heart felt meaning. Any child who loves horses or animals would love it and never forget it. Today I am 69 year old and have a black/bay Arabian Gelding with white on his face and a couple legs. He fulfilled all my dreams in color and breed. I wish they still made movies like Gypsy Colt. I place The Black Stallion movies right up there with Gypsy.

But the value goes well beyond the love of horses and to the issues of faith, family love and common decency.  And what a great story about a horse who knows who really loves him as he tries at every turn to escape from his cruel trainer.  Great ending that also demonstrates decency and ethics as the original owner sees what is going on and that the horse belongs where the girl and her family live.  And the faith issue comes in because the girl had such faith that doing what was right would bring blessings. Blessings such as an end to a drought, her father being able to keep the money he got for selling the horse in order to buy seed, and blessings in knowing that good can win in the end.1o star",5,10 star gem,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,753,"['Yes', 'movie', 'horse', 'lover', 'should', 'own', 'value', 'well', 'love', 'horses', 'issues', 'faith', 'family', 'love', 'common', 'decency', 'what', 'great', 'story', 'horse', 'who', 'who', 'really', 'turn', 'escape', 'cruel', 'trainer', 'Great', 'ending', 'also', 'decency', 'ethics', 'original', 'owner', 'sees', 'what', 'going', 'horse', 'where', 'girl', 'family', 'live', 'faith', 'issue', 'girl', 'had', 'such', 'faith', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'would', 'bring', 'blessings', 'Blessings', 'such', 'end', 'drought', 'father', 'being', 'able', 'keep', 'money', 'got', 'selling', 'horse', 'order', 'buy', 'seed', 'blessings', 'knowing', 'good', 'can', 'win', 'end.1o', 'star']",N/A
