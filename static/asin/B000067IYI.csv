702915,ARAWCI4L3QZVB,B000067IYI,Archie (Ottawa Canada),"[3, 4]",I have just received and watched the wonderful Opus Arte production of Tosca.  That prompted me to have another look at this production again.Kultur has outdone themselves with this one.  In my past experience they generally take very good recordings and push them out with the minimum of production standards.  This time they started with something mediocre.  Other reviewers have described the end result.There are several excellent productions of Tosca out there.  Do not waste your time and money on this sorry excuse.,1,Yet another terrible Kultur production,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,522,"['have', 'just', 'received', 'watched', 'wonderful', 'Opus', 'Arte', 'production', 'Tosca', 'prompted', 'have', 'look', 'production', 'again.Kultur', 'outdone', 'one', 'past', 'experience', 'generally', 'take', 'very', 'good', 'recordings', 'push', 'out', 'minimum', 'production', 'standards', 'time', 'started', 'something', 'mediocre', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'end', 'are', 'several', 'excellent', 'productions', 'Tosca', 'there', 'Do', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'sorry', 'excuse']",N/A

The singing is good, if not fantastic, except in the case of Scarpia, where it is quite fantastic. It lacks, however, in the staging aspects. The acting of Scarpia is very convincing, but Cura's acting as Cavaradossi is very mediocre, and the Prima Donna's is downright laughable. The stage people decided to base the opera in 1800, but the hair people decided Cura should come from 1995. The conducting is shaky in terms of its commitment to the score. The sets are quite good, very convincing, and the lights and sound seem well organized. All in all, a well-deserved three stars, but nothing more.",3,Mediocre,1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,647,"['not', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'not', 'bad', 'singing', 'good', 'not', 'fantastic', 'case', 'Scarpia', 'where', 'quite', 'fantastic', 'however', 'staging', 'aspects', 'acting', 'Scarpia', 'very', 'convincing', 'Cura', 'acting', 'Cavaradossi', 'very', 'mediocre', 'Prima', 'Donna', 'downright', 'laughable', 'stage', 'people', 'decided', 'base', 'opera', '1800', 'hair', 'people', 'decided', 'Cura', 'should', 'come', '1995', 'conducting', 'shaky', 'terms', 'commitment', 'score', 'sets', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'convincing', 'lights', 'sound', 'seem', 'well', 'organized', 'well-deserved', 'three', 'stars', 'nothing', 'more']",N/A
702917,AV7Z25U0HUGTU,B000067IYI,N. Gallimore,"[17, 21]","This is the best Tosca yet available on DVD, the conducting is very good and the production very convincing.  Jose Cura redeems his lacklustr Manrico at Covent Garden a few weeks ago and sings a role that could have been written for him.  His interpretation of Cavarodossi is sensationally perfect, I can see why Tosca is jealous in Act I.  I suspect that she isn't this Cavarodossi's only conquest, and she knows it.  He looks good, acts well, and sings like an angel, his ""E lucevan le stelle"" is perfection personified.  He is the best Cavarodossi I have ever seen or heard and I cannot believe Roberto Alagna will any where near rival him in the forthcoming DVD.Scarpia, alias Renato Bruson, is about as perfect as you are ever likely to come across.  His voice is a bit ragged around the edges these days but he uses it to great effect and his acting is exemplary.  I am totally convinced by his monstrous portrayal of arguably one of operas most evil and nasty characters.I hadn't heard of Francesca Patane, and in the singing class she isn't in the same league as her two protagonists, but her acting is very convincing.  So much so that both my wife and I you can forgive her vocal failings.  She has obviously studied Maria Callas' interpretation, but she goes sharp on many ocassions and has difficulty with Tosca's demanding tessitura.  But this shouldn't deter you, nor the missed notes in ""Vissi d'arte"".  Her acting pulls her through and whereas she will be no competition for Angela Gheorghui (whose DVD is eagerly awaited) this recording will sit happily in your collection.By the way, Spoletta is the best I have ever seen too, whilst Angelloti is just your run of the mill melodramatic ham.I think this is the best Tosca I have seen on video or DVD, and whilst I eagerly await the film version with the Covent Garden orchestra, I cannot think we will ever abandon this version.  Which is more than I can say for the Met's or Domingo's other two film versions.  Go for Cura every time.",5,An excellent Tosca.,1024617600,"06 21, 2002",2002,2002,"['best', 'Tosca', 'yet', 'available', 'DVD', 'conducting', 'very', 'good', 'production', 'very', 'convincing', 'Jose', 'Cura', 'lacklustr', 'Manrico', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'interpretation', 'Cavarodossi', 'sensationally', 'perfect', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Tosca', 'jealous', 'Act', 'I.', 'suspect', ""n't"", 'Cavarodossi', 'only', 'conquest', 'good', 'well', 'sings', 'angel', 'E', 'lucevan', 'le', 'stelle', 'perfection', 'personified', 'best', 'Cavarodossi', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'heard', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'Roberto', 'Alagna', 'will', 'where', 'near', 'rival', 'forthcoming', 'DVD.Scarpia', 'alias', 'Renato', 'Bruson', 'as', 'perfect', 'are', 'ever', 'likely', 'come', 'voice', 'bit', 'ragged', 'edges', 'days', 'great', 'effect', 'acting', 'exemplary', 'am', 'totally', 'convinced', 'monstrous', 'portrayal', 'arguably', 'one', 'operas', 'most', 'evil', 'nasty', 'characters.I', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Francesca', 'Patane', 'singing', 'class', ""n't"", 'same', 'league', 'two', 'protagonists', 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'So', 'much', 'wife', 'can', 'forgive', 'vocal', 'failings', 'obviously', 'studied', 'Maria', 'Callas', 'interpretation', 'sharp', 'many', 'ocassions', 'difficulty', 'Tosca', 'demanding', 'tessitura', 'should', ""n't"", 'deter', 'missed', 'notes', 'Vissi', ""d'arte"", 'acting', 'pulls', 'will', 'be', 'competition', 'Angela', 'Gheorghui', 'DVD', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'recording', 'will', 'sit', 'happily', 'collection.By', 'way', 'Spoletta', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'too', 'whilst', 'Angelloti', 'just', 'run', 'mill', 'melodramatic', 'ham.I', 'think', 'best', 'Tosca', 'have', 'seen', 'video', 'DVD', 'whilst', 'eagerly', 'await', 'film', 'version', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'orchestra', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'abandon', 'version', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'Met', 'Domingo', 'other', 'two', 'film', 'versions', 'Go', 'Cura', 'time']",N/A

Buying this was a waste of money.  Cura is mediocre at best and Patane is just embarrassing!  Terrible voice!  The acting was lousy as well.  Cura is often looking amused at the wrong times and wonder if he found this entire thing a fiasco as well.  He seemed to be laughing internally at Patane's performance, (if you can call it a performance). The only surprise is that anyone liked this Tosca at all.  Any other Tosca is better than this and the original movie with Domingo is perhaps still the best available on video.",1,Skip this Tosca,1056672000,"06 27, 2003",2003,644,"['just', 'worst', 'opera', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'thought', 'coul', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'many', 'Toscas', 'Wrong', 'Buying', 'was', 'waste', 'money', 'Cura', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Patane', 'just', 'embarrassing', 'Terrible', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'lousy', 'as', 'well', 'Cura', 'often', 'looking', 'amused', 'wrong', 'times', 'wonder', 'found', 'entire', 'thing', 'fiasco', 'as', 'well', 'seemed', 'be', 'laughing', 'internally', 'Patane', 'performance', 'can', 'call', 'performance', 'only', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'liked', 'Tosca', 'other', 'Tosca', 'better', 'original', 'movie', 'Domingo', 'perhaps', 'still', 'best', 'available', 'video']",N/A

I had bought his first CD, his voice showing no timbre at all and really unattractive. However, I thought, well, heck, I'll give him another try and one cannot have too many Toscas. Now I have one too many. This version must have been done on a shoe string, it is spare, to say the least and so is the singing. Ms. Pantane is little better than Mr. Cura and her singing is, like his, more in the nature of screaming although she does have a bit of timbre.
