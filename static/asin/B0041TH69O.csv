He said it sent his game in the tank for a while while he was trying out the tips but he just golfed his age this week, so I think he's in love with these instructions.  If you have an analytical golfer in your family, this DVD is a great present.",5,Great Present for the golfer in your family,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,312,"['Got', 'Dad', 'Christmas', 'present', 'loved', 'DVDs', 'said', 'sent', 'game', 'tank', 'while', 'was', 'trying', 'out', 'tips', 'just', 'golfed', 'age', 'week', 'think', 'love', 'instructions', 'have', 'analytical', 'golfer', 'family', 'DVD', 'great', 'present']",N/A
1382297,AN81JUYW2SL24,B0041TH69O,Gearhead Mania,"[0, 0]","Lessons of a Lifetime 1Tom Watson is very articulate with his words, but also gets straight to the point. The instructional videos also feature a lot of visual aids to assist the viewer. The self-congratulatory segments are goofy, but sometimes worthwhile to see because it shows how much golf has evolved over the years. However it gets kind of repetitive when he keeps bringing up some key moments in his past, or starts name throwing famous golfers that many newer golfers wouldn&#8217;t recognize. He pronounces &#8220;arc&#8221; rather differently, and I kept hearing &#8220;earth&#8221;.Lessons of a Lifetime 2 just came out, but the only new content is on the third disc and it isn&#8217;t worth the price of admission as I didn&#8217;t find anything really useful.Overall: 4/5 stars, a great deal overall.

It's also quite timely for him to do this DVD, perhaps it was a long time coming, he could've done one earlier in his career, but he has recently gained even more respect and admiration from his achievement at the age of 59 in almost winning The Open, and the DVD makes point of that fact as a starting point to the lessons.The only problems I have with it is that it is disappointing that it is not in HD. I am sure they could've done it, but I suppose they wanted it to be as accessible to as many people as possible and more people have the regular DVD, so that does make sense - but, the quality of the picture is only so-so when up-converted by my BR machine automatically, that it looks kinda cheap. I also faced a few glitches on the DVD with skipping, and after I checked that the DVD was dust-free and scratch free, I played it again and skipped at the same parts, so that was annoying.Other than that, I learned a lot, took a few good tips for things I've been working on lately, so it's a worthwhile investment, as I will be reverting back to the lessons over and over again.",4,Comprehensive lesson from one of the masters of golf.,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1189,"['like', 'DVD', 'overall', 'basics', 'Watson', 'most', 'things', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'quite', 'timely', 'do', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'one', 'earlier', 'career', 'recently', 'gained', 'even', 'more', 'respect', 'admiration', 'achievement', 'age', '59', 'almost', 'winning', 'Open', 'DVD', 'point', 'fact', 'starting', 'point', 'lessons.The', 'only', 'problems', 'have', 'disappointing', 'not', 'HD', 'am', 'sure', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'suppose', 'wanted', 'be', 'accessible', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'more', 'people', 'have', 'regular', 'DVD', 'make', 'sense', 'quality', 'picture', 'only', 'so-so', 'when', 'up-converted', 'BR', 'machine', 'automatically', 'kinda', 'cheap', 'also', 'faced', 'few', 'glitches', 'DVD', 'skipping', 'checked', 'DVD', 'was', 'dust-free', 'scratch', 'free', 'played', 'again', 'skipped', 'same', 'parts', 'was', 'annoying.Other', 'learned', 'lot', 'took', 'few', 'good', 'tips', 'things', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'lately', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'will', 'be', 'reverting', 'back', 'lessons', 'over', 'again']",N/A
