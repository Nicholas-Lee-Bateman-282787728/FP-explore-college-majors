1434792,A7RJ3VX0PCJXQ,B004ZKKKVK,Good Self,"[4, 10]","We were excited for this newest Veggie Tales movie because it's geared toward girls. We've really enjoyed ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"" and had similar expectations for ""Princess and the Pop Star."" Unfortunately, the story just wasn't very cohesive -- they really tried to fit too much into a short time -- and the ending in particular left something to be desired with one girl (named Princess) failing to realize the error of her ways until her little brother found his wee vegetable self in a perilous situation that she rescued him from. The jokes weren't there, the religious subtext was overly preachy, and the songs weren't as catchy as those in Pirates. Even my little girl didn't care for this video.",2,Rotten Ending,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,715,"['were', 'excited', 'newest', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'movie', 'geared', 'girls', ""'ve"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Pirates', 'Who', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Do', 'Anything', 'had', 'similar', 'expectations', 'Princess', 'Pop', 'Star', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'cohesive', 'really', 'tried', 'fit', 'too', 'much', 'short', 'time', 'ending', 'particular', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'one', 'girl', 'named', 'Princess', 'failing', 'realize', 'error', 'ways', 'little', 'brother', 'found', 'wee', 'vegetable', 'self', 'perilous', 'situation', 'rescued', 'jokes', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'religious', 'subtext', 'was', 'overly', 'preachy', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'catchy', 'Pirates', 'Even', 'little', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'video']",Veggie Tales: Princess & The Popstar

Great work VeggieTales making a very high quality video and music DVD for young girls! For us it's a great alternative to the Barbie version that's out there too...the graphics are great and bonus music video and other bonus items are fun and also high quality. Highly recommend for girls ages 4-10.",5,High Quality Good Alternative to Barbie,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,484,"['video', 'had', '3', 'big', 'girls', 'up', 'dancing', 'listening', 'messages', 'loving', 'family', 'being', 'thankful', 'lifestyle', 'not', 'wanting', 'envying', 'someone', 'Great', 'work', 'VeggieTales', 'making', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'video', 'music', 'DVD', 'young', 'girls', 'great', 'alternative', 'Barbie', 'version', 'out', 'there', 'too', 'graphics', 'are', 'great', 'bonus', 'music', 'video', 'other', 'bonus', 'items', 'are', 'fun', 'also', 'high', 'quality', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'girls', 'ages', '4-10']",Veggie Tales: Princess & The Popstar

Having two daughters it is great to have a girlie episode every once in a while. The Princess and the Popstar is a great colorful story with fun new music. A ""freaky friday"", ""grass is always greener..."", and ""the prince and the paulper"" story to show these two girls that they are better in their own lives just as God created them. Already my toddler has requested we watch it multiple times.

1434795,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B004ZKKKVK,Mark Baker,"[7, 9]","Princess Poppyseed (Laura Carrot) is not happy with her life on the farm.  She has too many brothers and sisters and doesn't like her chores collecting the eggs and milk that her family uses to grow pies.  Princess wishes she had the life of her favorite singer, Vanna Banana (also Laura Carrot but a different voice actress).  Vanna, meanwhile, is lonely and wishes she could have a normal life.  When the two meet by chance on a playground, they decide to switch lives.  But will that bring them the happiness they are seeking?Maybe I was just being dense, but I was glad to see that they had named one of their main characters Princess and that was how they were ripping of the title of Twain's famous book.  Once I got that down, I was able to get caught up in the story.  They were a little preachy in the middle, but that didn't last for long.  Unfortunately, the ending didn't live up to the rest of the video.  It was way too cheesy and drawn out.For the silly song segment, Archibald comes out and gives us some fashion history with ""Astonishing Wigs.""  This one is fun for the ending more than the song itself.Speaking of the songs, I did enjoy the music here more than in the last few VeggieTale releases.This isn't a bad entry in the DVD series, but it has certainly lost the spunk it used to have.  Still, kids should enjoy it, and that's the most important thing.",4,This Switcheroo Stumbles at the End,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,1377,"['Princess', 'Poppyseed', 'Laura', 'Carrot', 'not', 'happy', 'life', 'farm', 'too', 'many', 'brothers', 'sisters', ""n't"", 'like', 'chores', 'collecting', 'eggs', 'milk', 'family', 'grow', 'pies', 'Princess', 'had', 'life', 'favorite', 'singer', 'Vanna', 'Banana', 'also', 'Laura', 'Carrot', 'different', 'voice', 'actress', 'Vanna', 'meanwhile', 'lonely', 'could', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'When', 'two', 'meet', 'chance', 'playground', 'decide', 'switch', 'lives', 'will', 'bring', 'happiness', 'are', 'seeking', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'dense', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'had', 'named', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Princess', 'was', 'how', 'were', 'ripping', 'title', 'Twain', 'famous', 'book', 'Once', 'got', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'were', 'little', 'preachy', 'middle', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Unfortunately', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'rest', 'video', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'cheesy', 'drawn', 'out.For', 'silly', 'song', 'segment', 'Archibald', 'out', 'fashion', 'history', 'Astonishing', 'Wigs', 'one', 'fun', 'ending', 'more', 'song', 'itself.Speaking', 'songs', 'did', 'enjoy', 'music', 'here', 'more', 'last', 'few', 'VeggieTale', 'releases.This', ""n't"", 'bad', 'entry', 'DVD', 'series', 'certainly', 'lost', 'spunk', 'used', 'have', 'Still', 'kids', 'should', 'enjoy', 'most', 'important', 'thing']",Veggie Tales: Princess & The Popstar
