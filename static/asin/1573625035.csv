190392,A31A9GENAJYD64,1573625035,David M. Rossi,"[1, 1]","Jon Cryer is one of those special actors that Hollywood largely overlooked in his early days there. It's already been said that Morgan Stewart's Coming Home is no Pretty In Pink, but then it's not supposed to be. This is humor in a different vein than his irrepressible Duckie from Pretty In Pink.Morgan is a troublemaker who has been kicked out of 8 private schools in 6 years because he can't seem to get his parents to run out of new schools to send him to. All he wants is to go home and live a normal life with parents who care about him. Morgan thinks he finally got his wish when he is told that his mother called and wants him to come home for good. Turns out its just an attempt to help his dad win a senatorial election based on 'family values'. Paul Gleason ( the principal from The Breakfast Club) plays his dad's aide and campaign manager and just when you think things can't go any more awry from Morgan's antics, the campaign is derailed due to Gleason's character's sleazy intentions.Tammy Anderson plays the love interest for Morgan, a girl who is just as brilliantly zany as Morgan and so, is a perfect match for him, much to the chagrin of his mother (played brilliantly by Lynn Redgrave) during one of the films funniest sequences. All I'm gonna say is 'awkward bathroom scene' so as not to give away too much in the way of spoilers for those who haven't seen it.The film is superb as a concept that has always felt only partially realized for me, and it seemed that they could have done more with it. When the wrap up at the end comes, you find yourself wishing there had been more, a feeling that was intensified by some curious edits at different times in this dvd that I don't remember from the original release I had years ago on VHS. (the edits are why I knocked the star rating down to 4, not because of the film itself)I'm not sure what it is about the movie, but it's strangely magnetic and makes you want to watch it again and again, as I did years ago.Morgan Stewart's Coming Home is a fun filled romp with lots of heart and silliness and it surely will not make you feel as if you wasted your time watching it, as is true of other similar films in this genre from that time.",4,Insert kid here,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2206,"['Jon', 'Cryer', 'one', 'special', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'largely', 'overlooked', 'early', 'days', 'there', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'Morgan', 'Stewart', 'Coming', 'Home', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'then', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'humor', 'different', 'vein', 'irrepressible', 'Duckie', 'Pretty', 'Pink.Morgan', 'troublemaker', 'who', 'been', 'kicked', '8', 'private', 'schools', '6', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'parents', 'run', 'out', 'new', 'schools', 'send', 'go', 'home', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'parents', 'who', 'care', 'Morgan', 'finally', 'got', 'wish', 'when', 'told', 'mother', 'called', 'come', 'home', 'good', 'out', 'just', 'attempt', 'help', 'dad', 'win', 'senatorial', 'election', 'based', ""'family"", 'values', 'Paul', 'Gleason', 'principal', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'dad', 'aide', 'campaign', 'manager', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'awry', 'Morgan', 'antics', 'campaign', 'derailed', 'due', 'Gleason', 'character', 'sleazy', 'intentions.Tammy', 'Anderson', 'love', 'interest', 'Morgan', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'brilliantly', 'Morgan', 'so', 'perfect', 'match', 'much', 'chagrin', 'mother', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'one', 'films', 'funniest', 'sequences', ""'m"", 'gon', 'na', 'say', ""'awkward"", 'bathroom', 'scene', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'spoilers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.The', 'film', 'superb', 'concept', 'always', 'felt', 'only', 'partially', 'realized', 'seemed', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'When', 'wrap', 'up', 'end', 'find', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'feeling', 'was', 'intensified', 'curious', 'edits', 'different', 'times', 'dvd', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'original', 'release', 'had', 'years', 'ago', 'VHS', 'edits', 'are', 'why', 'knocked', 'star', 'rating', 'down', '4', 'not', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'strangely', 'magnetic', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'did', 'years', 'ago.Morgan', 'Stewart', 'Coming', 'Home', 'fun', 'filled', 'romp', 'lots', 'heart', 'silliness', 'surely', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'feel', 'wasted', 'time', 'watching', 'true', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'genre', 'time']",N/A

I watched it pretty frequently, and as I grew up it become sort of a comfort movie and it moved with me, well it wore out.  So yay to the DVD Lost Collection.Morgan Stewart is played by Jon Cryer, he's an awkward teenager who just wants to be part of his family.  He's super into horror flicks.  Well after a pretty crazy prank at the boarding school the headmaster informs Morgan that his parents called and they want him to come home.  Morgan hasn't lived at home since he was about 8 or so.  He doesn't really know much about his parents anymore and they certainly don't know or understand Morgan.  His dad is a Republican Senator and his mother is an overly structured rigid rule cracking mom.Morgan meets a fellow horror movie fan and falls in love, and the more Morgan is himself the less his mother understands him and tries to restrict his life.  When the restrictions become unbearable Morgan runs away and discovers some political secrets and ...I have to leave you there least I give away the ending.",5,I love this movie and was so excited to see the dvd release,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,1107,"['Gosh', 'was', 'pretty', 'young', 'when', 'mother', 'taped', 'Morgan', 'Stewart', 'Coming', 'Home', 't.v', 'watched', 'pretty', 'frequently', 'grew', 'up', 'become', 'sort', 'comfort', 'movie', 'moved', 'well', 'wore', 'out', 'So', 'yay', 'DVD', 'Lost', 'Collection.Morgan', 'Stewart', 'played', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'super', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Well', 'pretty', 'crazy', 'prank', 'boarding', 'school', 'headmaster', 'informs', 'Morgan', 'parents', 'called', 'want', 'come', 'home', 'Morgan', ""n't"", 'lived', 'home', 'was', 'about', '8', 'so', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'parents', 'anymore', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'understand', 'Morgan', 'dad', 'Republican', 'Senator', 'mother', 'overly', 'structured', 'rigid', 'rule', 'cracking', 'mom.Morgan', 'meets', 'fellow', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'love', 'more', 'Morgan', 'less', 'mother', 'tries', 'restrict', 'life', 'When', 'restrictions', 'become', 'unbearable', 'Morgan', 'away', 'political', 'secrets', 'have', 'leave', 'least', 'give', 'away', 'ending']",N/A
