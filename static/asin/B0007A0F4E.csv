Depending on one's take of Christmas, the season will be a festive celebration, a religious hallmark filled with meaning, or an ordeal filled with nauseating depression.  (For most of us, it is a combination of all three.)  Trying to cope with the forced pleasantries and crass materialism of a season saturated with meaning is a real struggle.  So it is with Nora and Luther Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen).  As empty-nesters they face a particular vacuum when their daughter leaves for the Peace Corps and leave all reason for them to celebrate behind.  Their solution?  Skip the expense of the holiday trimmings and go for a cruise starting Christmas day.  Cynically and brazenly, their neighbors and co-workers won't stand for it.  Like the holiday police, they encroach the Krank's personal space as if they were criminals in the Great Holiday Conspiracy.  Motives seem mixed.  As they start, they save Christmas spending for their cruise, but, later refuse even the free holiday trimmings of Christmas carolers.  What gives?  Luther says, ""It's the principle of the thing...Not even Nick Frohmeyer (M. Emmitt Walsh) can stop us.""  So it's keeping up with the Joneses, then--or in this case the Krank's--and their reputation with the rest of the neighbors.  Included are prankster kids who launch a ""Free Frosty"" campaign for the coveted Krank roof decoration.'Christmas with the Kranks' really has a frosty look at the holiday season--one that notably warms up as the movie goes on.  One wonders why the Kranks couldn't take a few simple steps to make their Christmas plans easier; one that would combine purposes and take needed short-cuts to their sanity.  But, that, of course, would delete a lot of the comedy.  And, there are some big laughs to be had from this comedy flick.  The previews give us the impression that '...The Kranks' would deliver a sack full of holiday laughs, but at least we get a quality stocking stuffer.  It seems to at least have some heart--even if it does borrow (or steal) some important elements from great Christmas classics, notably 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,' 'Scrooge,' and 'A Charlie Brown Christmas'.  For the latter, there's the scrawny tree bit.  Anyway, for all its redeeming qualities, 'Christmas with the Kranks' presents an inconsistent and jaundiced holiday view that has the effect of tainted eggnog:  It is sweet but leaves a bitter aftertaste.",2,Keeping up with the Kranks,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,2495,"[""'Christmas"", 'Kranks', 'presents', 'holiday', 'season', 'common', 'ambivalence', 'Depending', 'one', 'take', 'Christmas', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'festive', 'celebration', 'religious', 'hallmark', 'filled', 'meaning', 'ordeal', 'filled', 'nauseating', 'depression', 'most', 'combination', 'three', 'Trying', 'cope', 'forced', 'pleasantries', 'crass', 'materialism', 'season', 'saturated', 'meaning', 'real', 'struggle', 'Nora', 'Luther', 'Krank', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'empty-nesters', 'face', 'particular', 'vacuum', 'when', 'daughter', 'Peace', 'Corps', 'leave', 'reason', 'celebrate', 'solution', 'Skip', 'expense', 'holiday', 'trimmings', 'go', 'cruise', 'starting', 'Christmas', 'day', 'Cynically', 'brazenly', 'neighbors', 'co-workers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'holiday', 'police', 'encroach', 'Krank', 'personal', 'space', 'were', 'criminals', 'Great', 'Holiday', 'Conspiracy', 'Motives', 'seem', 'mixed', 'start', 'save', 'Christmas', 'spending', 'cruise', 'later', 'refuse', 'even', 'free', 'holiday', 'trimmings', 'Christmas', 'carolers', 'What', 'Luther', 'principle', 'thing', 'Not', 'even', 'Nick', 'Frohmeyer', 'M.', 'Emmitt', 'Walsh', 'can', 'stop', 'keeping', 'up', 'Joneses', 'then', 'case', 'Krank', 'reputation', 'rest', 'neighbors', 'Included', 'are', 'prankster', 'kids', 'who', 'launch', 'Free', 'Frosty', 'campaign', 'coveted', 'Krank', 'roof', 'decoration', 'Kranks', 'really', 'frosty', 'look', 'holiday', 'season', 'one', 'notably', 'up', 'movie', 'One', 'why', 'Kranks', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'few', 'simple', 'steps', 'make', 'Christmas', 'easier', 'one', 'would', 'combine', 'purposes', 'take', 'needed', 'short-cuts', 'sanity', 'course', 'would', 'delete', 'lot', 'comedy', 'are', 'big', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'comedy', 'flick', 'previews', 'give', 'impression', 'Kranks', 'would', 'deliver', 'sack', 'full', 'holiday', 'laughs', 'least', 'get', 'quality', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'least', 'have', 'heart', 'even', 'borrow', 'steal', 'important', 'elements', 'great', 'Christmas', 'classics', 'notably', 'Grinch', 'Who', 'Stole', 'Christmas', ""'Scrooge"", 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'latter', 'scrawny', 'tree', 'bit', 'Anyway', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Kranks', 'presents', 'inconsistent', 'jaundiced', 'holiday', 'view', 'effect', 'tainted', 'eggnog', 'sweet', 'bitter', 'aftertaste']",Christmas with the Kranks

They tell everyone in the town (which seemed silly, why does everyone need to know?) and all the people they tell get mad!! The neighbors threaten them if they don't put up decorations, their friends pout because there will be no party and they are solicited over and over again to give moeny. I didn't see what the big deal was. So they were going on a cruise, who cares? It just didn't seem realistic.

I think `stupid' she thinks `could be funny.'Go figure.So we sit down to watch this fiasco and guess what...she converts.There's really only so much that can be said about the mess that is `Christmas with the Kranks.'  Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are the worst they've ever been, which is still leagues ahead of Dan Aykroyd and the plot is just one of the worst I've had to endure.  The gags are redundant and barely giggle worthy (except maybe the tanning scene, but that alone does not make this movie remotely watchable) and the whole `sentimental-heartwarming' scene at the end seems out of place even if it is (cough) sweet.First let's review the plot.  Luther and Nora Krank love Christmas.  In fact they are the center of Christmas in their town.  Then their daughter Blair joins the Peace Corp and informs mom and dad that she will not be home for Christmas.  Luther then decides that this would be a good time for him to take Nora on a cruise, skipping Christmas altogether and enjoying some alone time.  Little did he realize that skipping Christmas was `against the law' in his town.  Yes, the villagers revolt and protest the Krank's personal decision which is not funny, it's stupid, because if anyone reacted to any of my decisions with such ridiculous animosity I would have them beaten.Oh yeah, then Blair calls.  She's coming home for Christmas after all (didn't she JUST leave) and she's getting married (she known him, what, three days) and wants her new fianc&eacute; to experience a Krank Christmas.  So now, after burning every bridge in the neighborhood, Luther and Nora now have to gather all their `ex-friends' together for help in throwing the best Christmas party they've ever thrown.The acting is just as atrocious as the plot.  Allen and Curtis are obviously hamming it up because they have to.  They realized shortly after filming that this film was a drag and so they decided to have fun with their mistake.  I can respect that, but they are still very unfunny.  Aykroyd is a mess.  Walsh is the only `decent' actor here, playing his Scrooge type character well, and the last scene with him and Luther is touching even if it is misplaced.It's safe to say that I loathed this film.  In fact I'm thinking of skipping Christmas every year...oh wait...I already do...now what do you have to say about that (as I hide from angry mod with pitchforks).",1,This Christmas made me kranky...,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,2518,"['saw', 'trailer', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'immediately', 'thought', 'stupid', 'few', 'weeks', 'wife', 'insisted', 'watch', 'think', 'stupid', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'figure.So', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'fiasco', 'guess', 'what', 'really', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'mess', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'are', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'still', 'leagues', 'ahead', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'plot', 'just', 'one', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'had', 'endure', 'gags', 'are', 'redundant', 'barely', 'giggle', 'worthy', 'maybe', 'tanning', 'scene', 'alone', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'remotely', 'watchable', 'whole', 'sentimental-heartwarming', 'scene', 'end', 'place', 'even', 'cough', 'let', 'review', 'plot', 'Luther', 'Nora', 'Krank', 'love', 'Christmas', 'fact', 'are', 'center', 'Christmas', 'town', 'Then', 'daughter', 'Blair', 'Peace', 'Corp', 'informs', 'mom', 'dad', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'home', 'Christmas', 'Luther', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'take', 'Nora', 'cruise', 'skipping', 'Christmas', 'altogether', 'enjoying', 'alone', 'time', 'Little', 'did', 'realize', 'skipping', 'Christmas', 'was', 'law', 'town', 'Yes', 'villagers', 'revolt', 'protest', 'Krank', 'personal', 'decision', 'not', 'funny', 'stupid', 'anyone', 'reacted', 'decisions', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'animosity', 'would', 'have', 'beaten.Oh', 'yeah', 'then', 'Blair', 'coming', 'home', 'Christmas', 'did', ""n't"", 'JUST', 'leave', 'getting', 'married', 'what', 'three', 'days', 'new', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'experience', 'Krank', 'Christmas', 'So', 'now', 'burning', 'bridge', 'neighborhood', 'Luther', 'Nora', 'now', 'have', 'gather', 'ex-friends', 'together', 'help', 'throwing', 'best', 'Christmas', 'party', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'thrown.The', 'acting', 'just', 'as', 'atrocious', 'plot', 'Allen', 'Curtis', 'are', 'obviously', 'hamming', 'up', 'have', 'realized', 'shortly', 'filming', 'film', 'was', 'drag', 'so', 'decided', 'have', 'fun', 'mistake', 'can', 'respect', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'unfunny', 'Aykroyd', 'mess', 'Walsh', 'only', 'decent', 'actor', 'here', 'playing', 'Scrooge', 'type', 'character', 'well', 'last', 'scene', 'Luther', 'touching', 'even', 'safe', 'say', 'loathed', 'film', 'fact', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'skipping', 'Christmas', 'year', 'oh', 'wait', 'already', 'do', 'now', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'hide', 'angry', 'mod', 'pitchforks']",Christmas with the Kranks

Maybe it would be ok. Boy, it turns out that I am dead wrong. It's not them really. Christmas with the Kranks is basically watching Christmas in Nazi Germany. The poor writing drowned the picture, and the life values were destroyed by wrong messages. Just because a husband and wife want to go on a cruise...let them be. Nothing wrong with it.

I never even got the answer from Christmas with the Kranks to the question why the daughter was coming back from Peace Corps mission. You know, that mission is a two-year thing. Looking at that girl, I have to be in a disbelief. There is not a lot of humor found in Christmas with the Kranks, but of course, plenty of nauseous feeling and boredom helped to set in. Christmas with the Kranks is a totally unappreciative picture that takes a cheap shot of stealing the adorable and so fine majestic spirit of Christmas. Okay...let us pause here. Exactly what kind of people the picture focuses on? I see a family that spends $6,100 on Christmas alone with a husband who is probably a partner on a law firm and big houses along with other big houses filled with predominately white Anglo Saxon Protestants. I suspect the audience for this picture is very limited. On comedic level, Christmas with the Kranks doesn't par up well with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

My wife and her sister laughed through the enitre movie. My brother-in-law and I looked at each other and shrugged. We didn't get it. I looked around the theater, and found most of those laughing - were women. Their dates were looking as bewildered as us. It was as if the movie was intended as an in-joke for women.A year later, ""Christmas With The Kranks"" came out on DVD. I picked up a copy for my wife, and as you'd expect, she talked me into watching it with her. I found myself almost liking it. The next evening, with the house to myself - I decided to play it again. I don't even know why.But, it all began to make sense. I could see what my wife, her sister, and all the women in the theater found so funny. It isn't the over-the-top, slapstick of Tim Allen (who I am a fan of). It's the subtle humor of the more true-to-life Jamie Lee Curtis. She's the perfect foil for Tim Allen. But more than that - she's the unsung STAR of this Christmas comedy. Once I understood that - the movie became very funny for me.

879248,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0007A0F4E,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[9, 14]","There are only a few, at least to me anyway, films that are true holiday classics. This latest film to delve into the holiday themed movie will probably not be one of them. Not that it doesn't deliver on the holiday fun or give you that warm, gooey holiday feeling, because it does, but the movie will not hold up as well as the book it's based on will. John Grisham wrote the book ""Skipping Christmas"", but the movie had to change it's name so as not to be confused with the recent Ben Affleck bomb, ""Surviving Christmas"". 'Kranks' is pretty faithful to the book, although there are a number of small things that were left out, or things that were there but were written in a different way. Tim Allen stars as Luther Krank, an accountant who realizes that he and his wife Nora(Jamie Lee Curtis) spent over $6,000 dollars on Christmas the previous year. Horrified, Luther comes up with a plan. Their only daughter Blair has joined the peace core and is being shipped off to Peru. Luther realizes that since everything is different, and the house is empty, that he and the wife should skip Christmas this year, and take that annual holiday money and spend it on themselves by taking a sun filled cruise to the carribbean. Easier said than done. Once word spreads around their close knit, heavily ran neighborhood, and the town, Luther and Nora realize that foregoing the holiday will be tougher than they had originally thought. But things go really wrong when Blair calls and says she is coming home for Christmas, and The Kranks have to make a mad dash to throw the holidays together in less than a day. Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are perfectly cast as Luther and Nora. Tim can really be Luther, and Jamie Lee brings to life Nora's sweetness, although her giddiness throughout the movie makes it seem like she might sometimes need ritalin. Dan Aykroyd, who we haven't seen in a while, plays neighbor Vic Frohmeyer, a guy who pretty much keeps tight reins on the block. The hectic and chaos of the film and the holiday really show how crazy it all can get. The ending shows that family and friends and loved ones are what it is really important. Not tons of presents or anything else. The movie definitley has the look and spirit of a Christmas favorite, but the movie is sometimes wobbly and sometimes as cheap looking as tinsel. That being sad, the movie is fun and charming in it's own way, and there are a few hearty laughs. Tim's Botox incident springs to mind. The joy of the season with the lights and snow and music was nicely executed, and it does give you that warm Christmas feeling. The ending is big and sweet, and while a lot of people will call it schmaltzy or whatever, it's still nice. Who cares if there's a little bit of schmaltz?. It never hurt anybody. What I realized after seeing it, was how fast it all got together. The book seemed to take longer, but throwing Christmas back together again came so fast. Extra kudos must go to Jamie Lee for baring it in a skimpy bikini. She is not the Jamie Lee from long ago anymore, but she has the guts to show to the world her figure as it is and isn't one of these surgically enhanced dolls with hardly a flaw on their whole body. Good for you Jamie Lee. Rounding out the cast are M. Emmett Walsh, Cheech Marin, Jake Busey, Erik Per Sullivan from ""Malcolm In The Middle"", Tom Poston, Caroline Rhea, and ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman.

Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, Christmas With The Kranks is an instant Christmas holiday classic. Although not in the same league of Yule tide comedy gems Christmas Vacation and A Christmas Story, this film ranks high on my list of holiday laughers. The supporting cast (led by perpetual funnyman Dan Aykroyd) turns in a superb performance, making Christmas With The Kranks an easy film to relate to and one you'll want to see many times in the years to come...When the college-age daughter of the Kranks joins the Peace Corps and flies to South America for Christmas, her mother battles with a case of the empty nest blues. But her father, accountant Luther Krank (Tim Allen), takes advantage of the opportunity to shake things up a bit. Tallying all the money he and his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) spend on Christmas, he determines that if they skip Christmas this year, they can afford to go on a week-long cruise instead and still pocket three thousand dollars in savings at the end of the trip.But skipping Christmas turns out to be more difficult than they thought - especially when it comes to participating in neighborhood traditions such as the mounting of the roof-bound 'Frosties' (giant snowmen all the neighbors plant on their roofs). The neighborhood struggle over the Kranks' reluctance to put up their Frosty leads to some memorable and quite funny scenes where the couple encounters Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd), the de facto leader of the neighborhood Christmas celebration. The Kranks continue to avoid all things Christmas related, and having visiting the tanning salon, they're prepared to go on their cruise Christmas Eve.But when their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) calls with the announcement that she's getting married, and more importantly, that she's on a plane bound for home - the Kranks are forced to miss their cruise and recreate all the festivities of Christmas Past for Blair and her fianc&eacute;e. But attempting to do a whole month's preparation in one evening proves to be a monumental task, and one filled with hilarious pitfalls and obstacles...Offering hilarious scene after hilarious scene, Christmas With The Kranks is one of the funniest comedies in years, and certainly one of the top ten Christmas comedies of all time. At no time does the humor become outlandish or utterly ridiculous as so many such films tend to do. Overall, one of the more lovable aspects of this film is its ability to relate to so many American families. In fact, you might see a bit of your own family in Christmas With The Kranks... The fact that it's one of those rare holiday classics with the potential to be seen year after year makes Christmas With The Kranks a definite must-see movie...The DVD Report",3,"A funny, family-friendly Christmas comedy...",1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2900,"['Based', 'best-selling', 'John', 'Grisham', 'novel', 'titled', 'Skipping', 'Christmas', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'book', 'almost', 'facet', 'save', 'title', 'Starring', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'instant', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'classic', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Yule', 'comedy', 'gems', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'film', 'high', 'list', 'holiday', 'laughers', 'supporting', 'cast', 'led', 'perpetual', 'funnyman', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'superb', 'performance', 'making', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'easy', 'film', 'relate', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'come', 'When', 'college-age', 'daughter', 'Kranks', 'Peace', 'Corps', 'flies', 'South', 'America', 'Christmas', 'mother', 'case', 'empty', 'nest', 'blues', 'father', 'accountant', 'Luther', 'Krank', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'Tallying', 'money', 'wife', 'Nora', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'spend', 'Christmas', 'skip', 'Christmas', 'year', 'can', 'afford', 'go', 'week-long', 'cruise', 'instead', 'still', 'pocket', 'three', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'savings', 'end', 'trip.But', 'skipping', 'Christmas', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'thought', 'especially', 'when', 'participating', 'neighborhood', 'traditions', 'such', 'mounting', 'roof-bound', ""'Frosties"", 'giant', 'snowmen', 'neighbors', 'plant', 'roofs', 'neighborhood', 'struggle', 'Kranks', 'reluctance', 'put', 'up', 'Frosty', 'memorable', 'quite', 'funny', 'scenes', 'where', 'couple', 'encounters', 'Vic', 'Frohmeyer', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'de', 'facto', 'leader', 'neighborhood', 'Christmas', 'celebration', 'Kranks', 'continue', 'avoid', 'things', 'Christmas', 'related', 'having', 'visiting', 'tanning', 'salon', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'go', 'cruise', 'Christmas', 'Eve.But', 'when', 'daughter', 'Blair', 'Julie', 'Gonzalo', 'announcement', 'getting', 'married', 'more', 'importantly', 'plane', 'bound', 'home', 'Kranks', 'are', 'forced', 'miss', 'cruise', 'recreate', 'festivities', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'Blair', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'attempting', 'do', 'whole', 'month', 'preparation', 'one', 'evening', 'be', 'monumental', 'task', 'one', 'filled', 'hilarious', 'pitfalls', 'obstacles', 'Offering', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedies', 'years', 'certainly', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'Christmas', 'comedies', 'time', 'time', 'humor', 'become', 'outlandish', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'so', 'many', 'such', 'films', 'tend', 'do', 'Overall', 'one', 'more', 'lovable', 'aspects', 'film', 'ability', 'relate', 'so', 'many', 'American', 'families', 'fact', 'might', 'see', 'bit', 'own', 'family', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'fact', 'one', 'rare', 'holiday', 'classics', 'potential', 'be', 'seen', 'year', 'year', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'definite', 'must-see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Report']",Christmas with the Kranks

I figured since Tim Allen had a pretty good Christmas movie reputation, Jaime Lee Curtis is always good and the previews looked relatively funny, that I would give this movie a shot.  It was the worst hour and a half I have spent at a movie this year.The movie is basically about The Kranks whose daughter joins the Peace Corp. and will not be home for Christmas.  For some reason that is never explained, Luther (Tim Allen) is upset at Christmas and decides to go on a cruise instead of celebrating Christmas this year.  His wife agrees and they skip Christmas.  Apparently they live in Brown-Noserville, U.S.A. because everyone in the town is obsessed with the fact that the Kranks are not celebrating Christmas.  Then their daughter decides to come home for Christmas and they need to get ready for Christmas in a hurry.  All the neighbors help them and they succeed in celebrating Christmas.  The End.This movie was absolutely horrible.  Tim Allen's character was really pissed off the whole movie at Christmas and their was no reason for his behavior.  This is supposed to be the man who throws the best Christmas party and celebrates Christmas the most out of anyone in the town, then all-of-a-sudden he hates Christmas.  Also the way all of the neighbors were more concerned with the Kranks not celebrating then with their own Christmas was so over-exaggerated that it got annoying.  Finally, the last main stinking point of the movie was that it was NOT FUNNY at all.  I did not laugh one time this whole movie.  I have never been to a comedy movie and not laughed like I did in this movie.  What a shame.Obviously, I cannot recommend that you see this movie.  This movie continuly dragged out and was incredibly boring.  Plus it was not funny at all.  This was one of the only movies that I have ever wanted to walk out on.

Well, OK there is certainly nothing wrong with that but what annoyed the heck out of me was why not just say you took the trip as a Christmas present instead of insisting your skipping Christmas.  Taking a trip together shows courtship and compassion for one another, skipping Christmas on the other hand is not compassionate and grinch-like.  So basically the whole movie is nothing other than the neighbors and co-workers highlighting how terrible the couple are for ""skipping Christmas"" and not carrying out the traditional celebration.

With Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Akroyd and a good support group this should have been funnier but the script didn't try hard enough.Curtis and Allen are a married couple who decide to skip Christmas because their only daughter has gone off to the Peace Corp. They decide to spend the money on a cruise and to make the experience complete they don't put up a tree or decorate or send out cards or any of the usual Christmas things people do. The neighborhood they live is horrified at their decision and put constant pressure on them to conform and celebrate the holiday as usual. They resist, but on Christmas Eve their daughter calls and tells them she is coming home for Christmas. So, with the help of the same neighbors they have been feuding with, they throw everything together at the last minute so she will never know they were going to skip Christmas.The idea is an interesting one, but the script didn't go far enough with the jokes.

It isn't enough to provide a treacely sweet ending to pull this one out of the fire.  Still, if you want to kill a couple of hours and you like Tim Allen, Jamie Curtis (and who doesn't), well, you could do worse.The idea is that that Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora (Jamie Curtis) Krank are part of a neighborhood that really puts on a Christmas show every year and the Kranks are at the forefront of that effort.  It turns out with their decorations, parties, donations, presents, cards, and so forth they spend over six thousand dollars per year.  As the movie opens they are saying goodbye to their daughter, Blair (played by the appropriately transcendently beautiful Julie Gonzalo), who is going to serve in the Peace Corps in Peru.As the parents mope about being alone for Christmas Luther has a vision about skipping Christmas, saving a few thou and taking a cruise instead.  However, his idea to skip Christmas is bizarrely stringent and ends up making everyone they know upset beyond belief.  The leader of the neighborhood who is one Vic Frohmeyer (done to a turn by Dan Ackroyd - I like him even if certain folks really don't).  Why this whole thing has to get as far out of hand as it does is certainly due to plot needs rather than anything a real person or people would do and that is part of the movie's problem.Also, I really don't like the patronizing view that mid-westerners are this mindless conforming bunch of hicks with bad taste and a profound inability to reason.  Oh, they may have a good heart, but it is a sort of a kindly idiot they portray.  As a lifelong mid-westerner, this is absolutely not anything like the life I have lived or seen lived around here.  Groupthink affects the coasts a lot more than it does here, in my experience.  Anyway, back to the movie.Mayhem ensues when Blair announces she is on her way home to celebrate Christmas and is bringing her fianc&eacute;, Enrique (played well by Ren&eacute; Lavan).  You have to see the rest of the movie to get the punch lines.  However, just realize that none of it is really going to be believable or transcendently funny.  The beast just cranks along (wink, wink) and extrudes its ending.So, if you are willing to view this with low expectations, you can have an ok experience, but that is about it.  It has much more to do with the screenplay than the performers.

879287,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0007A0F4E,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[0, 2]","""Christmas with the Kranks"" is based on a book by John Grisham, which is odd because nothing about this movie invovled the courtroom. It is a good idea, yes, but the way the movie pulls it off is not perfect, it's not even all that good, but it certainly isn't awful. My first problem with approaching this movie was that it was written by Chris Columbus, who always ends up making his movies ""for the family."" That's why I liked the third ""Harry Potter"" movie better than the first two, because of Chris Columbus directed that one, all of the dark undertones, and creepy images would have been made ""for the family,"" and not for the viewer. I really don't like him very much, and as a writer, no. The second problem with ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is that it jumps from emotion to emotion. The entire first half was funny, the middle was physical comedy, and the finale was full of emotion, and sweet, sappy, scenes. It didn't make sense. I didn't know what kind of movie I was watching. The third problem, was that most of it wasn't funny. It was supposed to be, I'm sure, but they didn't pull it off well. It is a little overlong, but entertaining to say the least.Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis star as Luther and Nora Krank. They have a daughter named Blair, whose going to Peru for a year and is coming back the following year. She is leaving the weekend after Thanksgiving, which means that she is going to miss Christmas. They are upset about it, Nora visablly, and Luther, not as apparent. It's raining out, and after getting drenched, Luther gets a great idea. He does some math, and realizes that they spend about $6132.00 on Christmas every year, so this year, since Blair isn't going to be there, they only spend $3000.00 and go on a cruise, bask in the Caribbean, and leave on Christmas morning. They don't do anything, no Christmas tree, no gifts, no cards, and no Christmas Eve party that they have every year. And, especially, no putting a giant seven foot snowman dubbed ""Frosty"" on the roof. This doesn't go over well with the neighbors, because on Christmas, everybody in this area is obsessed. Luther refuses to put up Frosty, having everybody chant ""Free Frosty"" outside. This really doesn't go over well with Vic Frohmeyer, who loves the neighborhood, and is pretty much the leader of it all. It's finally Christmas Eve, and they are getting ready to pack, when Blair calls and tells them that she is coming home later that night, with a surprise. Now, Luther and Nora can't tell her anything, and they rush to put together the best part ever, including getting a tree, getting a hickory honey ham, inviting all the neighbors, and finally, putting that damn snowman on the roof.You could probably guess where the physical comedy rests. It contains, but not limited to, Nora trying to race a women to the last hickory honey ham, Luther taking the Christmas tree from the neighbor next door, and finally, Luther dangling off the roof after trying to put the Frosty up. When he falls, and there is an image of him boucning up and down, it had to be the fakest Tim Allen I have ever see. The ""heart"" of the movie comes from the neighbors Bev and Walt, who have a cat that Luther doens't like, and vice versa. Bev has cancer, and while in remission, it comes back, and it could be her lats Christmas. This felt forced in, just as a way to tie everything up together in the end. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is on the same level as the October Christmas comedy, ""Surviving Christmas,"" but none of them compare to ""The Polar Express"" which was amazing to look at. I didn't hate ""Christmas with the Kranks,"" but if you want to get into the spirt of the holiday, go check out ""The Polar Express"" instead. A fair Christmas movie that provides a few laughs.

879288,A2W4UPPE8RUT6Z,B0007A0F4E,"ElaineReads ""ElaineReads""","[4, 6]","Christmas with the Kranks:Okay, I read John Grisham's Skipping Christmas about four years ago and thought it was so incredibly funny.  I told everyone I knew that it was a great book and that I couldn't wait for it to be made into a movie.  I knew it would eventually happen...Well, it did and I was not impressed.  I think this movie tries too hard.  I don't know, maybe the book should have been left alone and not made into a movie.  I think the movie stays pretty true to the book, although I can't exactly remember ALL of the details of the book because it has been so long since I read it.  It just doesn't transfer well to film.  Maybe it was bad direction...  Or maybe it was bad acting...  Whatever it was, it ruined the movie, in my opinion.I normally don't mind Tim Allen, and I don't think he was all that bad in this movie.  Jamie Lee Curtis, on the other had, just didn't come off as very funny.  Well, not as often as she should have anyway.  Yes, some of her scenes/lines were funny, but not enough of them.  Sometimes I found her to be just plain annoying!  Dan Aykroyd did well in his role, as I think he usually does.On to the movie: Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis play Luther and Nora Krank.  The Kranks are spending their first Christmas alone without their daughter who has gone off to Peru with the Peace Corps.  Not looking forward to spending the holiday without their daughter and deciding that they normally spend way too much on Christmas anyway, Luther books them on a 10-day Caribbean cruise for which they are scheduled to depart at noon on Christmas Day.What follows is a six-week preparation for the cruise, including trips to a tanning salon.  (The scenes for this, by the way, just weren't funny for some reason.  Except for the ""oompa loompa"" looking salon operator.  She was funny!)  And Luther and Nora begin explaining to friends, neighbors and co-workers that they are ""skipping Christmas"".  As you can guess, no one takes this well and as things become very tense between the Kranks and their very-into-tradition neighbors, the phone rings and it's their daughter Blair announcing that she is coming home for Christmas after all.Luther and Nora begin to frantically prepare a party and get their house decorated as if it had been that way all along so Blair will never know about the cruise.  Many things go wrong during this time and eventually the neighbors find out that Blair is coming home and soon enough they are all working together to get Luther and Nora's party and house before her arrival.  Who doesn't love a happy ending?The last half-hour or so of this movie (not including end credits) was the best, in my opinion.

879293,A3H82LUT1EC655,B0007A0F4E,Erika Sorocco,"[7, 11]","When Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) Kranks only daughter, Blair (Julie Gonzalo) leaves home for the peace corp. right before Christmas, the two lonely parents realize that Christmas just won't be the same without a daughter to celebrate with. So Luther comes up with the idea to skip Christmas altogether, and take a cruise that will be leaving at high noon on Christmas Day. When he convinces Nora, the two begin informing their friends and neighbors about their change of plans, and soon find that the entire town has turned their backs on the couple. But when Blair phones home on Christmas Eve to inform her parents that she's coming home for Christmas, with her new fiance, Enrique (Rene Lavan), in tow; and that he's more than excited to see what a real American Christmas is like, the Kranks are sent into a tizzy, and immediately begin enlisting the help of their now-enemy neighbors to get everything set up for Blair's arrival. And with just twelve hours left, they're going to need all the help they can get.I was a huge fan of John Grisham's SKIPPING CHRISTMAS - the book that this movie was adapted from - so I was unsure of whether or not the big-screen version would be able to compare with the literary version. I needn't have worried, for CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS was a hilarious sleigh ride of crazy characters, and miserable mishaps. Tim Allen (THE SANTA CLAUSE and HOME IMPROVEMENT) is fabulous as the somewhat grinchy Luther Krank, complete with a fake tan and botox injections; while Jamie Lee Curtis (HALLOWEEN and FREAKY FRIDAY) does a fabulous job of switching from scream-queen mode, into doting-mother mode without a hitch. However, it's Dan Aykroyd (playing Vic Frohmeyer; LOSER and PEARL HARBOR) who steals the show, as the nosy neighbor, who feels that he's in charge of the entire neighborhood. With appearances by Cheech Marin (GOOD BOY! and SPY KIDS) as a fumbling cop, and Erik Per Sullivan (MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE and JOE DIRT) as the obnoxious, trouble-making Spike Frohmeyer. CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS is a delightful holiday film that analyzes an entire town and how those who choose to ""skip"" Christmas are alienated, while at the same time spreading holiday cheer. A fabulous addition to the holiday film genre, that will appeal to all, whether you're a crank or not.Erika SoroccoFreelance ReviewerBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",5,Holiday Fun Complete With Nosy Neighbors and Fumbling Cops,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,2409,"['When', 'Luther', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Nora', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Kranks', 'only', 'daughter', 'Blair', 'Julie', 'Gonzalo', 'home', 'peace', 'corp.', 'right', 'Christmas', 'two', 'lonely', 'parents', 'realize', 'Christmas', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'daughter', 'celebrate', 'Luther', 'up', 'idea', 'skip', 'Christmas', 'altogether', 'take', 'cruise', 'will', 'be', 'leaving', 'high', 'noon', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'When', 'Nora', 'two', 'begin', 'informing', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'change', 'plans', 'soon', 'find', 'entire', 'town', 'turned', 'backs', 'couple', 'when', 'Blair', 'home', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'inform', 'parents', 'coming', 'home', 'Christmas', 'new', 'fiance', 'Enrique', 'Rene', 'Lavan', 'tow', 'more', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'real', 'American', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'are', 'sent', 'tizzy', 'immediately', 'begin', 'enlisting', 'help', 'now-enemy', 'neighbors', 'get', 'everything', 'set', 'up', 'Blair', 'arrival', 'just', 'twelve', 'hours', 'left', ""'re"", 'going', 'need', 'help', 'can', 'get.I', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'John', 'Grisham', 'SKIPPING', 'CHRISTMAS', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'so', 'was', 'unsure', 'not', 'big-screen', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'compare', 'literary', 'version', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'CHRISTMAS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'KRANKS', 'was', 'hilarious', 'sleigh', 'ride', 'crazy', 'characters', 'miserable', 'mishaps', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'THE', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', 'HOME', 'IMPROVEMENT', 'fabulous', 'somewhat', 'grinchy', 'Luther', 'Krank', 'complete', 'fake', 'tan', 'botox', 'injections', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'HALLOWEEN', 'FREAKY', 'FRIDAY', 'fabulous', 'job', 'switching', 'scream-queen', 'mode', 'doting-mother', 'mode', 'hitch', 'However', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'playing', 'Vic', 'Frohmeyer', 'LOSER', 'PEARL', 'HARBOR', 'who', 'show', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'who', 'charge', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'appearances', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'GOOD', 'BOY', 'SPY', 'KIDS', 'fumbling', 'cop', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'MALCOLM', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIDDLE', 'JOE', 'DIRT', 'obnoxious', 'trouble-making', 'Spike', 'Frohmeyer', 'CHRISTMAS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'KRANKS', 'delightful', 'holiday', 'film', 'entire', 'town', 'how', 'who', 'choose', 'skip', 'Christmas', 'are', 'alienated', 'same', 'time', 'spreading', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'fabulous', 'addition', 'holiday', 'film', 'genre', 'will', 'appeal', ""'re"", 'crank', 'not.Erika', 'SoroccoFreelance', 'ReviewerBook', 'Review', 'Columnist', 'Community', 'Bugle', 'Newspaper']",Christmas with the Kranks

Tim Allen is average and mostly believable, and Jamie Lee Curtis has been better in other things (like A FISH CALLED WANDA). But there was a nice supporting cast, including old timers like Austin Pendleton and Tom Poston. Nice to see them.Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin hated it. Roger gave it one star and said it wasn't funny, anywhere, ever. Leonard rated it BOMB. Ebert did point out one thing I thought was rather odd, that the couple's daughter has been gone in the Peace Corps for only a few weeks when she flies home for Christmas with her boyfriend. I mean, the movie opens at an airport the Sunday after Thanksgiving. A point is made of that date. Then when she phones from the Miami airport saying she's flying home on Christmas Eve, no one thinks anything of it. I didn't realize the Peace Corps was such an open thing that you could pick up and fly home scant weeks after you got there.If you want slapstick humor in a Christmas movie, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION is better.

Kaiser,"[2, 2]","Hmmm, This one is kind of a toss-up, on one side, you've got Jamie Lee Curtis, who is still gorgeous and still a pretty decent comic actress. Then on the other side, we have Tim Allen, who I have not liked in anything except for a few Home Improvement episodes (Ok, i'll give him Galaxy Quest, but Sigourney Weaver's cleavage had alot to do with that as well)So, I think I'll do the half full glass thing here and rave on about Mrs. Curtis....She is adorable in every scene, her facial expressions and comic timing really shine in this. Also, it looks like she really enjoyed making the movie, cuz the woman never stopped smiling. Tim Allen sleepwalks through alot of it, even his scenes alone look like they were really forced and not very ""funny""Another reason this gets 3 stars instead of 2 is a very strong supporting cast, Dan Akroyd is priceless as the at first upset then helpfull understanding neighbor, and Cheech Marin is also very good as a cop not too thrilled with Mr. Allen's decision to skip Christmas. Of course we have M. Emmett Walsh (how many frickin movies has this guy been in, 100? maybe even 200?) stealing a few scenes as he always does as another unhappy neighbor.But it's Curtis that steals it, I hear she has decided to stop acting, I hope this isnt true, because she is still wonderfull and can always help an average movie reach a bigger audience.So, again, not a terrible movie, some laughs here and there, and with the pathetic choices we have for holiday movies these days, you really won't have any regrets renting this, enjoy it for what it is, a simple holiday comedy with some sweet touches, kids will love it, parents will tolerate it.acting............3 stars, Allen's a bore, Curtis is soliddirecting.........3 stars, Simple, easy to not make mistakesspecial effects...n/a , None to really get into tocomedy rating.....3 stars, Alot of chuckles, nothing hilariousquality...........3.5 stars, Strong effort made in holiday setting,",3,"I laughed a little, not much, but some....",1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,1969,"['Hmmm', 'one', 'kind', 'toss-up', 'one', 'side', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'who', 'still', 'gorgeous', 'still', 'pretty', 'decent', 'comic', 'actress', 'Then', 'other', 'side', 'have', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'liked', 'anything', 'few', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'episodes', 'Ok', 'i', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'cleavage', 'had', 'alot', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'think', ""'ll"", 'do', 'half', 'full', 'glass', 'thing', 'here', 'rave', 'Mrs.', 'Curtis', '.She', 'adorable', 'scene', 'facial', 'expressions', 'comic', 'timing', 'really', 'shine', 'Also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'making', 'movie', 'cuz', 'woman', 'never', 'stopped', 'smiling', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'sleepwalks', 'alot', 'even', 'scenes', 'alone', 'look', 'were', 'really', 'forced', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'reason', '3', 'stars', 'instead', '2', 'very', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'priceless', 'first', 'upset', 'then', 'understanding', 'neighbor', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'cop', 'not', 'too', 'thrilled', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'decision', 'skip', 'Christmas', 'course', 'have', 'M.', 'Emmett', 'Walsh', 'how', 'many', 'frickin', 'movies', 'guy', 'been', '100', 'maybe', 'even', '200', 'stealing', 'few', 'scenes', 'always', 'unhappy', 'neighbor.But', 'Curtis', 'hear', 'decided', 'stop', 'acting', 'hope', 'isnt', 'true', 'still', 'wonderfull', 'can', 'always', 'help', 'average', 'movie', 'reach', 'bigger', 'audience.So', 'again', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'laughs', 'here', 'there', 'pathetic', 'choices', 'have', 'holiday', 'movies', 'days', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'regrets', 'renting', 'enjoy', 'what', 'simple', 'holiday', 'comedy', 'sweet', 'touches', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'parents', 'will', 'tolerate', 'it.acting', '3', 'stars', 'Allen', 'bore', 'Curtis', 'soliddirecting', '3', 'stars', 'Simple', 'easy', 'not', 'make', 'mistakesspecial', 'effects', 'n/a', 'None', 'really', 'get', 'tocomedy', 'rating', '..3', 'stars', 'Alot', 'chuckles', 'nothing', 'hilariousquality', '..3.5', 'stars', 'Strong', 'effort', 'made', 'holiday', 'setting']",Christmas with the Kranks

Nothing will ever touch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as far as great Christmas movies go--very few movies on any subject are that great. But nonetheless, ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is a fun movie that demands little in the way of emotional or intellectual devotion--it's just a sweet innocent family movie that was designed to make you feel good and hopefully make you laugh a few times and this movie does its job extremely well.I first saw this film on TV and, because I didn't see it from the start, I ordered it online and, by sheer coincidence, it was the first movie I watched on my new TV. I think that both Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are underrated comedic actors and they both play very likable characters in this film. Yes, of course, the story is contrived and silly and the screenplay has logic gaps that you could drive a Christmas-tree truck through, but it's still a fun film that everyone in the family can watch. And there are a few tender moments that are pretty well done.One of the things that I love is the aerial footage of the neighborhood (probably just a model or done with CGI) with all the Christmas lights lit--some extremely pretty photography. The neighborhood in the film is a very idealized vision of suburbia, but that's OK--nothing wrong with playing to people's fantasies of what life should be.Anyway, not a ground-breaking film by any means, but an extremely pleasant way to sip a cup of tea, eat a few Christmas cookies and enjoy some stress-free Christmas moments. I watched the movie after Christmas because, as much as I love Christmas movies, I've pretty much grown to loathe what has become of the holiday itself.The frustrating thing for me in watching films like this is wondering: How close was this to being a great film if they had only hired better writers to punch up the script--or perhaps if they had left the original script alone?

I miss him and know he enjoyed this movie.The humor and slapstick in the movie was so so it was extremely forced and strained and unfortunately this was easy to spot which ruined the so called comedy of the movie immediately.I felt like I was forcing myself to even chuckle during this movie when I first saw it on Dvd back in 2005 .The acting from almost everyone involved is horrible Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis were not that bad but they seemed to be zombies just reading their lines through half the movie.Jamie Lee Curtis characters screaming also got extremely annoying irritating and aggravating after a while talk about OVERACTING to the point of no return.Tim Allens character as usual like in most of his movies tries way too hard to be funny and its not convincing or interesting for the most part unfortunately.The supporting characters an annoying whiny kid 2 idiotic cops who add nothing to the movie whatsoever a daughter who changes her mind at the last minute and decides to come home for Christmas with her good looking boyfriend. 2 friends of Jamie Lee Curtises you only see 2 freaking times throughout the movie neighbors that are so grating you'd want to punch them all out and a MAYOR with the most annoying monotone voice ever heard and as intimidating as a pussy cat would be.The only neighbors that are nowhere near as annoying are the kindly elderly woman and her husband dealing with health issues .They were pretty much the only REAL characters worth sympathizing or caring about period.Oh I forgot a ridiculous part of the movie revolves around a petty robber that adds nothing to the movie whatsoever AGAIN and a MYSTERIOUS stranger who offers the main character an umbrella at the beginning of the movie.With this being a Christmas movie and all I am sure people can guess who he turns out to be in the end.I loved the snow the christmas decorations but the story itself was ridiculous and the lengths these insane neighbors go to is extremely stupid and not even the least bit believeable either.,3,Preachy and overly sentimental,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,2622,"['not', 'perfect', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'means', 'PERIOD.The', 'pros', 'snow', 'christmas', 'stuff', 'atmosphere', 'cute', 'charming', 'holiday', 'spirit.The', 'main', 'characters', 'sudden', 'change', 'end', 'was', 'too', 'convenient', 'sad', 'story', 'end', 'meant', 'touch', 'forced', 'just', 'thrown', 'up', 'there', 'tie', 'loose', 'ends', 'film.Granted', 'yes', 'when', 'originally', 'watched', 'made', 'tear', 'thought', 'was', 'sweet.My', 'father', 'died', 'July', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'so', 'will', 'probably', 'tear', 'up', 'again', 'part', 'just', 'miss', 'know', 'enjoyed', 'movie.The', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'was', 'extremely', 'forced', 'strained', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'easy', 'spot', 'ruined', 'so', 'called', 'comedy', 'movie', 'immediately.I', 'felt', 'was', 'forcing', 'even', 'chuckle', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Dvd', 'back', '2005', '.The', 'acting', 'almost', 'everyone', 'involved', 'horrible', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'were', 'not', 'bad', 'seemed', 'be', 'zombies', 'just', 'reading', 'lines', 'movie.Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'characters', 'screaming', 'also', 'got', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'irritating', 'aggravating', 'while', 'talk', 'OVERACTING', 'point', 'return.Tim', 'character', 'usual', 'most', 'movies', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'convincing', 'interesting', 'most', 'part', 'unfortunately.The', 'supporting', 'characters', 'annoying', 'whiny', 'kid', '2', 'idiotic', 'cops', 'who', 'add', 'nothing', 'movie', 'whatsoever', 'daughter', 'who', 'mind', 'last', 'minute', 'come', 'home', 'Christmas', 'good', 'looking', 'boyfriend', '2', 'friends', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtises', 'only', 'see', '2', 'freaking', 'times', 'movie', 'neighbors', 'are', 'so', 'grating', ""'d"", 'want', 'punch', 'out', 'MAYOR', 'most', 'annoying', 'monotone', 'voice', 'ever', 'heard', 'as', 'intimidating', 'pussy', 'cat', 'would', 'be.The', 'only', 'neighbors', 'are', 'nowhere', 'annoying', 'are', 'kindly', 'elderly', 'woman', 'husband', 'dealing', 'health', 'issues', '.They', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'REAL', 'characters', 'worth', 'sympathizing', 'caring', 'period.Oh', 'forgot', 'ridiculous', 'part', 'movie', 'around', 'petty', 'robber', 'nothing', 'movie', 'whatsoever', 'AGAIN', 'MYSTERIOUS', 'stranger', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'umbrella', 'beginning', 'movie.With', 'being', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'people', 'can', 'guess', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'end.I', 'loved', 'snow', 'christmas', 'decorations', 'story', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'lengths', 'insane', 'neighbors', 'go', 'extremely', 'stupid', 'not', 'even', 'least', 'bit', 'believeable', 'either']",Christmas with the Kranks

Also, it all contains a very good Christmas holiday feel when I watch this movie.  For the story, it is awesome.  It talks about when the daughter Blair Krank (Julie Gonzalo) is away from home for Christmas, her parents Luther Krank (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis) decided to skip Christmas.  However, when Blair decides to come back home for Christmas, Luther and Nora is in deep trouble and need to celebrate for the holidays in their last minute.  Finally, they succeed and have a great party.  During this, it has funny scene-by-scene.  So, it is good.  For the acting, I have to say that only Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are perfect.  For the others, they are just okay or so-so including Julie Gonzalo when she plays their daughter.  Actually for her, she is a good actress but she acts not that good in this movie.  If I watch only her, I will rather watch ""A Cinderella Story"" when she plays Hilary Duff's rival in love/enemy from last year.  Remember this movie?  I bet you are.  So, for the acting, it is okay.  For the direction, it is quite good.  It is because the movie is quite good and the sequence from scene-by-scene is looking quite logical.  For the visual, it is very good.  Especially in the end right before the end credits come, there is a surprised sleigh and it is quite good to end the movie.  For the others, it is good.

I can only wonder what the hell the director and producers were thinking when they produced this mindless garbage for the holidays I know- PROFIT take a hit book and warp it into something so tasteless and boring around the holidays- when we have nothing better to do but go see movies- especially Christmas ones.This movie DOES not live up to the book and I can only hope Tim Allen escapes this holiday fiasco with his job. The movie takes place around the holidays. With their daughter Blair in Peru on a Peace Corp mission Mr. and Mrs. Krank know that Christmas this year will not be the same. So to save money and feel a little less depressed about Blair not being their Mr. Krank decides to spend the money that they normally spend on the big holiday on a luxury cruise- meaning they'll have to skip Christmas this year. The decision comes as a shock to the entire neighborhood- they begin to call the house constantly insiting that the Kranks put up the much beloved christmas decoration frosty, with no donations this year to the police station's calendar fundraiser, no Krank Christmas Eve party, or even Boy Scout Christmas tree... the Kranks aren't winning any friends in their decision. Being described as ""Scrooges"" even in their local newspaper. The Kranks deal with a variety of stupid and outrageous situations. But on Christmas Eve their daughter Blair drops a bombshell she's engaged and her fiancee and her are coming home for Christmas. Now, the Kranks have to rely on the whole neighboorhood to make a memorable Krank Christmas Eve Party. And have to miss that luxury cruise they paid thousands for...This movie is dull, tasteless, and not really enjoyable even if it is a holiday movie... I hated this movie and found myself going from stupid outrageous situation to the next... who cares if they skipped Christmas really?

Clearly the filmmakers realized that most people, like me, didn't actually read ""Skipping Christmas"", but glanced at the last line in a bookstore at some point...Yes, this is a mediocre movie.  However, I think the level of vitriol in some of the reviews it has received, both on Amazon and elsewhere, is absurd.  I love Roger Ebert and his books collecting negative reviews, but he reviewed ""Christmas with the Kranks"" as though it were a cultural document of the utmost significance.  It's just a silly holiday movie!One thing I certainly did not like about ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was the sequence of Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis visiting a tanning salon.  People who use tanning salons greatly increase their risk of skin cancer, and I did not appreciate the depiction of this risky behavior on the part of responsible adult characters in a family comedy.

879332,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007A0F4E,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","The premise for ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is established early on when Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis), put their only child Blair (Julie Gonzalo) on a plane to Peru to work with the Peace Corps.  Facing their first Christmas without their daughter, Luther crunches the numbers and discovers that last year they spent over $6K on Christmas.  Since Blair will not be around this year he proposes they spend half that money on a cruise of the Caribbean.  Does that still leave the other half of that money to be spent on Christmas?  No, it does not, because Luther decides that he and Nora should go cold turkey and spend nothing on Christmas.At this point this 2004 holiday comedy goes off track in two important ways.  First, the catalyst for Luther's proposal is presented as being the money that was spent and not the fact that his daughter will not be home.  In other words, without Blair, Christmas just will not be Christmas.  But, no, this is just about the money.  This is proven because, as you all know from the trailer, the best laid plains of mice and Luther go astray when Blair announces at the last minute she is coming home.  Second, deciding to go on the trip, which seems to be an eminently reasonable decision under the circumstances, does not mean the Kranks should forgo basic things like sending out Christmas cards, making charitable donations, or having a tree.This becomes a problem because in the Kranks' neighborhood everybody goes overboard when it comes to decorating for Christmas.  So when the Kranks decide they are going to do nothing this year for Christmas, the block Nazi, Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd), organizes the neighbors against the Kranks.  These means pickets and harassing phone calls about freeing the giant Frosty figure in the basement, and a story in the newspaper declaring the Kranks public pariahs.  Consequently, there is really no one to root for in this film.  The neighbors who insist that the Kranks conform or else push several buttons while Luther's insistence that they do nothing is pretty stupid.  Every Christmas card that shows up from family and friends should be enough to prove that point.  But, no, Luther has to continue to be stupid because that is the way this story goes.In terms of comedy most of it is rather mean spirited for a Christmas movie, although since Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") did the screenplay that adapted John Grisham's Dickensian novella ""Skipping Christmas,"" the level of slapstick had to be expected.  But Grisham's satire is swamped by the resulting carnage and when some sentimentality and magic are thrown into the final act, neither plays well.  The fact that there are no deleted scenes on the DVD is disquieting because it suggests director Joe Roth was not discriminating when it came to what he put into this movie.  The most painful act turns out to be the second one, when Luther and Nora have to try and provide Blair a traditional Kranks Christmas at the last minute, and the humor really falls flat at the point when it should have been going into overdrive.I sort of like the idea that Tim Allen is trying to be the King of Christmas movies and I certainly enjoyed seeing Jamie Lee Curtis in a bikini even if she thinks we should not, but the net result of watching ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was disappointment.  Even though it is early for watching holiday movies--the official viewing period begins on Thanksgiving and has to start with the original ""Miracle on 34th Street (in black & white if I have to tell you)--I had to put on ""The Santa Claus"" to get this one out of my system and remind me that contemporary Christmas films really can hit all the right notes.",2,Instead of skipping Christmas how about just skipping this movie?,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,3700,"['premise', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'established', 'early', 'when', 'Luther', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Nora', 'Krank', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'put', 'only', 'child', 'Blair', 'Julie', 'Gonzalo', 'plane', 'Peru', 'work', 'Peace', 'Corps', 'Facing', 'first', 'Christmas', 'daughter', 'Luther', 'numbers', 'discovers', 'last', 'year', 'spent', '6K', 'Christmas', 'Blair', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'year', 'spend', 'money', 'cruise', 'Caribbean', 'still', 'leave', 'other', 'half', 'money', 'be', 'spent', 'Christmas', 'No', 'not', 'Luther', 'Nora', 'should', 'go', 'cold', 'turkey', 'spend', 'nothing', 'Christmas.At', 'point', '2004', 'holiday', 'comedy', 'off', 'track', 'two', 'important', 'ways', 'First', 'catalyst', 'Luther', 'proposal', 'presented', 'being', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'not', 'fact', 'daughter', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'home', 'other', 'words', 'Blair', 'Christmas', 'just', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'Christmas', 'just', 'money', 'proven', 'because', 'know', 'trailer', 'best', 'laid', 'plains', 'mice', 'Luther', 'go', 'astray', 'when', 'Blair', 'last', 'minute', 'coming', 'home', 'Second', 'deciding', 'go', 'trip', 'be', 'eminently', 'reasonable', 'decision', 'circumstances', 'not', 'mean', 'Kranks', 'should', 'forgo', 'basic', 'things', 'sending', 'out', 'Christmas', 'cards', 'making', 'charitable', 'donations', 'having', 'tree.This', 'problem', 'Kranks', 'neighborhood', 'everybody', 'overboard', 'when', 'decorating', 'Christmas', 'So', 'when', 'Kranks', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'nothing', 'year', 'Christmas', 'block', 'Nazi', 'Vic', 'Frohmeyer', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'neighbors', 'Kranks', 'pickets', 'harassing', 'phone', 'calls', 'freeing', 'giant', 'Frosty', 'figure', 'basement', 'story', 'newspaper', 'declaring', 'Kranks', 'public', 'pariahs', 'Consequently', 'really', 'one', 'root', 'film', 'neighbors', 'who', 'insist', 'Kranks', 'conform', 'else', 'push', 'several', 'buttons', 'Luther', 'insistence', 'do', 'nothing', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'Every', 'Christmas', 'card', 'up', 'family', 'friends', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'prove', 'point', 'Luther', 'continue', 'be', 'stupid', 'way', 'story', 'goes.In', 'terms', 'comedy', 'most', 'rather', 'mean', 'spirited', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'Home', 'Alone', 'did', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'John', 'Grisham', 'Dickensian', 'novella', 'Skipping', 'Christmas', 'level', 'slapstick', 'had', 'be', 'expected', 'Grisham', 'satire', 'swamped', 'resulting', 'carnage', 'when', 'sentimentality', 'magic', 'are', 'thrown', 'final', 'act', 'plays', 'well', 'fact', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'disquieting', 'director', 'Joe', 'Roth', 'was', 'not', 'discriminating', 'when', 'came', 'what', 'put', 'movie', 'most', 'painful', 'act', 'out', 'be', 'second', 'one', 'when', 'Luther', 'Nora', 'have', 'try', 'provide', 'Blair', 'traditional', 'Kranks', 'Christmas', 'last', 'minute', 'humor', 'really', 'flat', 'point', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'overdrive.I', 'sort', 'idea', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'trying', 'be', 'King', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'bikini', 'even', 'should', 'not', 'net', 'result', 'watching', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Even', 'early', 'watching', 'holiday', 'movies', 'official', 'viewing', 'period', 'Thanksgiving', 'start', 'original', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'black', 'white', 'have', 'tell', 'had', 'put', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'get', 'one', 'out', 'system', 'remind', 'contemporary', 'Christmas', 'films', 'really', 'can', 'hit', 'right', 'notes']",Christmas with the Kranks
879333,A2MK80I31FKB18,B0007A0F4E,Leanne V. Barnes,"[0, 0]","Based on John Grisham's novel, ""Skipping Christmas"", (which I thoroughly enjoyed) ""Christmas with Kranks"" is about a couple played by Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis that decide not to get bogged down with all the financial traps and traditions of the season and take one year off from the Christmas festivities and go on a cruise. Main reason-their daughter has gone into the Peace Corps and won't be home for Christmas.However, busy-body neighbours like Dan Ackroyd and M.Emmet Walsh make Skipping Christmas impossible!! If I had neighbours like this I'd sell my house very quickly!!! A bit over the top with how offended they are that the Kranks aren't celebrating Christmas, or putting their Frosty on the roof like the rest of the block. These people need a life!! But I think the ridiculousness of the plot was what John Grisham was going for in the first place. He shows us how we are sometimes so over-committed and overwhelmed at Christmas with the wrong things-material things.By the end of this movie, things turn from slap-stick to more serious. The Kranks daughter DOES end up home for Christmas and the Kranks end up scrambling to decorate and put their annual Christmas party together in a matter of hours. But perhaps the most touching part is when Luther Krank (Tim Allen) gives his tickets for the cruise to his neighbour across the street who constantly bugged and made fun of him. His wife is dying of cancer and he gives Walt (M.Emmet Walsh) the tickets so that they can spend one last wonderful Christmas together on a cruise.I think that ending redeems this movie but do try to read the book.

Lee ""mnl_1221""","[2, 4]","Last year we had polar opposite responses to Christmas with the Kranks: the ""Christian community"" telling us to go see it, and reviewers saying it was terrible.  I saw it last night on video.  Sorry, brothers and sisters in Jesus, but I'm leaning toward the reviewers.Now I never read Skipping Christmas by John Grisham, and maybe, as usual, the book is better.  The plot of the movie: suburbanite Luther Krank (Tim Allen) and his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) see their only daughter Blair off to the Peace Corps.  When Luther realizes he's spent $6,000 on Christmas last year, and a cruise to the Caribbean costs $3,000, he convinces Nora to ""skip Christmas"" by foregoing their traditional decorations, Christmas Eve party, and gifts, and to leave for the cruise on Christmas morning instead.  Their neighbors are shocked at the Kranks' lack of ""Christmas Spirit"", and a town hotshot (Dan Ackroyd) motivates the neighbors to change the couple's minds.  ""Free Frosty! Free Frosty!"" the kids chant in front of the Krank house, refering to the giant snowman hidden in the basement.Ackroyd's character wants the Kranks to display their Frosty like everyone else.  Luther subbornly fights back by, among other things, hosing his sidewalk so carolers slip on the subsequent ice and the neighbor's cat becomes a meowing ice sculpture.  However, when daughter Krank calls and announces she is coming home for Christmas, plans suddenly change.This movie could have been a wonderful farce.  Unfortunately, Christmas with the Kranks is terribly uneven: not farcical enough for a long stretch, then suddenly farcical to the nth degree.There is a truly heartwarming sentimental scene near the end which displays a true spirit of community and cooperation.  Community is a wonderful Christian value--but so are honesty, tolerance, and freedom.  Why aren't those values so honored as people are encouraged to lie to each other and to pressure their neighbors into conforming?  Why couldn't the Kranks tell their daughter: ""Honey, we didn't know you were coming home, and we made other plans.  Now let's sit down and figure out what to do.""I'm also bothered that the Kranks--Luther, anyway--felt they had to chuck their Christmas spirit along with their traditional Christmas plans.  How would their neighbors have reacted if they had said, ""We're celebrating Christmas differently this year?""  One can refuse the traditional hoopla and still accept a greeting of ""Merry Christmas!"" from a neighbor.

My guess is that they decided to change the title because of another holiday film disaster that came out the same year called ""Surviving Christmas"". Gee, that would really confuse the American movie-going audience if two holiday films in 2004 played in multi-plexes called ""Surviving Christmas"" and ""Skipping Christmas"".The amazon.com writeup for this movie got it wrong. This film is loyal to Grisham's novel, so I don't know what the writer was talking about. That's one of the things I noticed...it is a faithful film adaptation, so John Grisham may be the only one who loves this film because it came from his mind. The critics were right about the film though when they panned it. I kept waiting for the laughs and maybe had two at the most. Tim Allen was funnier in ""The Santa Clause"" and that was another holiday film I didn't particularly like either. What I do like most in this film are Jamie Lee Curtis as the mother and the music choices. Every time Jamie Lee Curtis got excited, she made a sound that I found hysterical and loved hearing. That made the movie for me and saved it from getting one star. I'd also buy the soundtrack because the music is pretty fresh for the most part. In the end, there is a redeeming moment that supposed to make your heart melt by its generosity of the holiday spirit, but all in all, I was hoping to see Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid take on the Kranks for some serious holiday fun.

879358,A2CMLBIKBG9EMP,B0007A0F4E,Norman R. Sahm,"[0, 0]","My biggest complaint about the movie is the title.  ""Skipping Christmas"" is a much better one and I don't understand why the change to ""Christmas With the Kranks"".  However, having said that, I still thought this film version of Grisham's book was pretty well done.  There are always changes from the book in the film versions, but I thought this one stayed true to the spirit of the original story.There are some great comic bits when Tim Allen and Jamie Leigh are getting ready for their cruise (i.e. the tanning booth, Allen's botox injections).  But the comedy is not the point of the story.  The overall message of the book and this film comes through very nicely and sweetly - faith, family, friends, community, and giving of ourselves is what the true spirit of Christmas is about.  Tim Allen's character transforms from practical, to stubborn, to selfish, to redemptive (by the end of the film).  If you put yourself in his shoes, you can definitely relate to his sense of dismay when you take into account all he endured to overcome his misunderstanding neighbors, when his well-laid and practical (even ingenious) plans came unraveled at his daughter's unexpected call on Christmas Eve that she would be home for Christmas.Yes, the neighbors are annoying, but even they become endearing when, for Allen's daughter's sake, they come together to help them prepare for her homecoming.  For me, though, the whole film comes together in that final scene when Allen's character, in spite of his disappointment and resentment, allows his heart (and I believe - his God) to move him to do something unselfish, sacrifical and loving for someone else.  This act redeems his character and the story.I think if you just watch the film and let it carry you through the story through Allen's character's eyes - you will enjoy the film and especially the ending.

While not the complete disaster professional critics made it out to be, this by the numbers comedy certainly won't be a highlight on anyone's resume.  Of the cast, only Tim Allen manages something resembling an entertaining performance as Mr Krank...probably because he's the only actor given something to work with as a middle aged man just trying to do something for himself for a change.  Conversely, Jamie Lee Curtis is just plain awful.  She spends most of the time shamelessly overacting as either a woman terrified of her neighbors or screechingly hyper excited over the upcoming return of her daughter.I frankly blame the boring mess this movie is on Joe Roth, normally a producer and utterly out of his element in pacing the comedy or remotely modulating his performers.  Unfortunatley, he's given no help by the screenplay of Chris Columbus, which resembles the proverbial output of 10 monkeys with word processors locked in a room for a week.As mentioned earlier, Tim Allen manages to escape relatively unscathed, but then he also seems eerily to be acting in a vacuum and disengaged from the performances around him.  All in all, a rather prudent choice.  This one had maybe two good laughs in 100 minutes (one involving Allen's Botox treatment).

Well, they are, but only because they choose to live in a neighborhood like this! I understand the neighbors MUST act this way--otherwise, there's no movie. But, what could have been a little commentary on what our society has become in regards to consumerism, etc., and Christmas, turns into a celebration of the neighbors' freakish behavior.No one wins in this film. The Kranks are reduced to sniveling, groveling idiots and the neighbors come off as Nazis.

Instead of love and good cheer, we're treated to a witless holiday farce replete with labored slapstick and fake snow.  All these neighborhood buttinskis are so annoying and irritating that they make you want to scream ""Get a life!"" every time they commit another holiday-related atrocity.  Actually, given a more courageous set of filmmakers and a better script, ""Christmas With the Kranks"" might have been a slashing little satire on Christmas materialism (on the order of, say, a ""Bad Santa""); instead, it turns all feel-goody and mushy, converting the vicious neighbors into goody-two-shoe, Santa's Little Helper-types in time for the tear-soaked finale.Screenwriter Chris Columbus and director  Joe Roth go for the lowbrow, easy laugh every time.  Columbus even seems to be trying for a bit of that old ""Home Alone"" magic again by bringing in a couple of bumbling cops and a light-fingered jewel thief who burgles the upstairs bedrooms while a Christmas Eve party is in full swing below.  Nothing works in this film, not the premise, not the humor, not the sentiment.  The saddest thing is that the film wastes the talents of Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd, M. Emmett Walsh, and Cheech Marin among others who probably signed on believing they were creating a Christmas classic that would live on through the ages.  Instead, it joins all those other seasonal misfires like ""Santa Claus- The Movie,"" ""Jingle All the Way"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas.""  Ah well, you can always serve this instead of a stuffed bird for Christmas dinner.

The neighbors, led by Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Ackroyd) first try to convince the Kranks gently to go along with the neighbors.  Then they become more forceful...staging protests to ""Free Frosty"" on the Kranks front lawn.  Nora starts to bend but Luther is adamant about no Christmas...until they find out that Blair is coming home afterall with her fiancee and they have just hours to get the home decorated and a party thrown together.The climax becomes a bit sappy as all the neighbors pitch in to help and Luther discovers the true meaning of Christmas, but what Christmas movie isn't just a bit sappy?  That's what Christmas movies are all about.  The film hasa number of funny parts such as when luther's face is numb from Botox injections but the laughs don't come as rapid fire as one might hope.I give Jaimie Lee Curtis credit for appearing in a bikini.  She has put on a LOT of weight since her days when she did that sexy dance in True Lies.  The cast is filled with wonderful character actors such as M. Emmet Walsh as the Kranks curmudgeonly neighbor, Cheech Marin as a cop, Tom Poston as a priest, and Austin Pendleton as Marty who seems to know everyone even if they don't know him.The Film is based on a book by John Crisham called ""Skipping Christmas"" and while I never read the book, the consensus seems to be that it was far better than the movie.  Still, there's enough good in the movie to recommend.  My biggest beef would be with the total lack of special features on the DVD.Reviewed by Tim Janson",4,UNEVEN BUT DECENT CHRISTMAS MOVIE,1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,2415,"['Christmas', 'Kranks', 'advertised', 'uproarious', 'slapstick', 'farce', 'not', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'decent', 'Christmas', 'film', 'better', 'most', 'reviwers', 'give', 'it.The', 'Kranks', 'Luther', 'Nora', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'are', 'somber', 'Christmas', 'Season', 'daughter', 'Blair', 'South', 'American', 'Peace', 'Corps', 'mission', 'spend', 'usual', 'thousands', 'Christmas', 'Luther', 'should', 'use', 'money', 'take', 'Caribbean', 'Cruise', 'just', 'skip', 'Christmas', 'presents', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Party', 'decorations', 'tree.This', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'Kranks', 'neighbors', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'obsessed', 'Christmas', 'make', 'Clark', 'Griswold', 'look', 'mild', 'comparison', 'residents', 'street', 'decorate', 'homes', 'places', 'big', 'plastic', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'roof', 'homes', 'neighbors', 'led', 'Vic', 'Frohmeyer', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'first', 'try', 'convince', 'Kranks', 'gently', 'go', 'along', 'neighbors', 'Then', 'become', 'more', 'forceful', 'staging', 'protests', 'Free', 'Frosty', 'Kranks', 'front', 'lawn', 'bend', 'Luther', 'adamant', 'Christmas', 'find', 'out', 'Blair', 'coming', 'home', 'afterall', 'fiancee', 'have', 'just', 'hours', 'get', 'home', 'decorated', 'party', 'together.The', 'climax', 'bit', 'sappy', 'neighbors', 'pitch', 'help', 'Luther', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'what', 'Christmas', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'bit', 'sappy', 'what', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'are', 'film', 'hasa', 'number', 'funny', 'parts', 'such', 'when', 'luther', 'face', 'numb', 'Botox', 'injections', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'rapid', 'fire', 'one', 'might', 'hope.I', 'give', 'Jaimie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'credit', 'appearing', 'bikini', 'put', 'LOT', 'weight', 'days', 'when', 'did', 'sexy', 'dance', 'True', 'Lies', 'cast', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'character', 'actors', 'such', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'Kranks', 'curmudgeonly', 'neighbor', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'cop', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'priest', 'Austin', 'Pendleton', 'Marty', 'who', 'know', 'everyone', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'him.The', 'Film', 'based', 'book', 'John', 'Crisham', 'called', 'Skipping', 'Christmas', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'consensus', 'be', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'Still', 'enough', 'good', 'movie', 'recommend', 'biggest', 'beef', 'would', 'be', 'total', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'DVD.Reviewed', 'Tim', 'Janson']",Christmas with the Kranks
879398,A38QJ7JUUTVLKX,B0007A0F4E,"Tom Servo ""Robot""","[1, 2]","There are some geniunine laughs in this movie. You have one of those days where everything that can go wrong does? This is what happened on the Krank's christmas eve. The Kranks have always celebrated a picture-perfect Christmas. But with their only daughter, Blair away from home on her Peace Corps assignment, Nora and Luther are suffering from empty nest syndrome and decide to skip Christmas in favor of a Caribbean cruise. But their neighbors, led by Vic Frohmeyer take Christmas very seriously and are none too happy about the Kranks' boycott. In this neighborhood where every house is decorated to the hilt and has a Frosty on the roof, skipping Christmas is virtually a crime. And just as the Kranks are preparing for their Christmas Day departure, they get a call from their daughter who announces that she is coming home for Christmas after all. Suddenly, all systems are go for their annual Christmas Eve party and a normal--highly festive--holiday. Will the Kranks be able to pull together a perfect Christmas for Blair in just a few hours, or will she discover their plan to skip Christmas? Well you probably already guessed the answer. With a predictable plot and shallow story telling, the movie fails in many ways, but this is in no way the atracity as some stuck up cinema snobs try to make it out to be. Apparently taking things for what they are is not something those critics are familiar to. There are some out loud laughing moments in this.

879402,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0007A0F4E,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[6, 10]","CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS is a slapstick Christmas comedy movie. It revolves around Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis). Luther and Nora's one and only child, daughter Blair, leaves on Thanksgiving weekend to begin a two-year stint in the Peace Corp. Both are sad to see their little girl go. However, Luther quickly moves on with life while Nora pines away missing her little girl. Christmas has always been a family event for the Kranks and this year it just won't be the same. With that in mind, Luther gets a brilliant idea. He begins totally up how much money he spent of Christmas the year before and finds it was in excess of $6,000.  Then he looks into some Caribbean cruises and finds one that leaves on Christmas day that cost less than $3,000 for a week of prepaid luxury for two. After presenting the idea to Nora and agreeing to make annual donations to charity, they agree that this year they will skip Christmas and go on a cruise instead.  But the friendly neighbors aren't so keen on the idea. Not only that, but little Blair has a few surprises of her own in store.CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS is based off the John Grisham novel, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and in fact was originally entitled SKIPPING CHRISTMAS.  The movie stays fairly close to the book. However, there are a few minor things that have been changed. Also, there are some instances where scenes from the book have been played over the top for comic effect.  Also, some might be turned off because some scenes taken directly from the book loose much of their literary appeal when presented on the screen.  It's something that happens quite often when a book is made into a movie and is no reason for concern, but people should be aware of it.Tim Allen makes a great movie Dad and Jamie Lee Curtis does a good job as Nora Crank, although it's hard to believe Curtis is old enough to be anyone's mother--she's still as trim and beautiful as ever.  The movie is filled with guest appearances with everyone from Cheech Marin playing a local police officer to Tom Poston as the priest of the community parish. Dan Aykroyd also has a major role as the leader of the neighborhood community group.CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS is a movie that older audiences will probably enjoy more than younger ones.  There isn't any potty humor, hardly any bad language, no promiscuous sex, and only cartoon violence. It's the type of humor than many younger audience members going through adolescence aren't able to appreciate for some reason. However, those with more mature sensibilities can appreciate the movie for the funny slapstick moments it contains which brings to mind the comedy of old.CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS isn't a great movie. However, it never pretends to be. It's just a plain good old fashioned Christmas comedy.",3,Have a Holly Jolly Christmas.,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,2800,"['CHRISTMAS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'KRANKS', 'slapstick', 'Christmas', 'comedy', 'movie', 'Luther', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Nora', 'Krank', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Luther', 'Nora', 'one', 'only', 'child', 'daughter', 'Blair', 'Thanksgiving', 'weekend', 'begin', 'two-year', 'stint', 'Peace', 'Corp', 'are', 'sad', 'see', 'little', 'girl', 'go', 'However', 'Luther', 'quickly', 'life', 'Nora', 'away', 'missing', 'little', 'girl', 'Christmas', 'always', 'been', 'family', 'event', 'Kranks', 'year', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'mind', 'Luther', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'totally', 'up', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'spent', 'Christmas', 'year', 'was', 'excess', '6,000', 'Then', 'Caribbean', 'cruises', 'one', 'Christmas', 'day', 'cost', 'less', '3,000', 'week', 'prepaid', 'luxury', 'two', 'presenting', 'idea', 'Nora', 'agreeing', 'make', 'annual', 'donations', 'charity', 'agree', 'year', 'will', 'skip', 'Christmas', 'go', 'cruise', 'instead', 'friendly', 'neighbors', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'keen', 'idea', 'Not', 'only', 'little', 'Blair', 'few', 'surprises', 'own', 'store.CHRISTMAS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'KRANKS', 'based', 'off', 'John', 'Grisham', 'novel', 'SKIPPING', 'CHRISTMAS', 'fact', 'was', 'originally', 'entitled', 'SKIPPING', 'CHRISTMAS', 'movie', 'fairly', 'close', 'book', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'Also', 'are', 'instances', 'where', 'scenes', 'book', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'top', 'comic', 'effect', 'Also', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'scenes', 'taken', 'directly', 'book', 'loose', 'much', 'literary', 'appeal', 'when', 'presented', 'screen', 'something', 'quite', 'often', 'when', 'book', 'made', 'movie', 'reason', 'concern', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'it.Tim', 'Allen', 'great', 'movie', 'Dad', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'good', 'job', 'Nora', 'Crank', 'hard', 'believe', 'Curtis', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'anyone', 'mother', 'still', 'trim', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'movie', 'filled', 'guest', 'appearances', 'everyone', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'playing', 'local', 'police', 'officer', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'priest', 'community', 'parish', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'also', 'major', 'role', 'leader', 'neighborhood', 'community', 'group.CHRISTMAS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'KRANKS', 'movie', 'older', 'audiences', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'more', 'younger', 'ones', ""n't"", 'potty', 'humor', 'hardly', 'bad', 'language', 'promiscuous', 'sex', 'only', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'type', 'humor', 'many', 'younger', 'audience', 'members', 'going', 'adolescence', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'appreciate', 'reason', 'However', 'more', 'mature', 'sensibilities', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'funny', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'mind', 'comedy', 'old.CHRISTMAS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'KRANKS', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'However', 'never', 'be', 'just', 'plain', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Christmas', 'comedy']",Christmas with the Kranks
879403,A1WL2EKE4TAEJP,B0007A0F4E,"Tyler Durden ""Mutton Man""","[16, 26]","I decided to watch this movie with my girlfriend to just have a good jolly ol' time at the movies and to get our spirits up about Christmas. Ahh, the most wonderful time of the year. What more than to relax in a theater while watching a Christmas movie? ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was the suitable choice for us. We watched... only to be met with such disappointment.The Kranks, played by Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, decide to skip out on Christmas since their daughter joined a Peace Corps. and flew to Peru. Luther Krank (Tim Allen) then brought up the bright idea of going on a cruise for Christmas. His wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) disagreed but then reluctantly accepted. Both then told the neighbors and Luther told his co-workers that they will not be celebrating Christmas. Unfortunately, the neighbors and co-workers highly objected to their decision and, in my view, made the Kranks' life miserable. Luther's co-workers all of a sudden despise him (one calling him ""Mr. Scrooge"") and the neighbors try to stop the Kranks from going. In this town, Christmas means everything to everyone, and the Kranks' decision seems to be a sin.This is nothing short of utter stupidity. The neighbors only treat Christmas as a time of having homes decorated and throwing parties. They try to get the Kranks to put up a Frosty statue on their rooftop just so everyone can be happy. They actually go as far as going in the Kranks' frontyard and protest (""Free Frosty! Free Frosty!"") and even putting their story on the frontpage of a newspaper. They just torment these poor people throughout the whole movie.. err... well, pretty much the whole movie.But then things take an ""unexpected"" twist when the Kranks' daughter phones in on Christmas Eve and tells 'em she's coming home. She has a new man with her that she'd wanna introduce and mentions if they're still throwing their party. Nora contemplates and reluctantly says, ""Yes."" Luther is pissed off, but Nora is even more pissed when she calls his idea a ""stupid idea."" She was all for a cruise, then she radically shifts and calls it a bad idea. Huh?So then they try to plan for a party at the last minute. It's hell for them since they're on their own, then the neighbors decide to ""forgive"" them and also lend a hand.The movie fails to recognize what Christmas is all about. To these characters, Christmas is all about the purty decorations and parties. That's not what Christmas is about. It's about being together as a family and a continuous celebration of the birth of Christ. Religion is a major factor in Christmas, but to these people, ""Frosty"" is of higher importance than Jesus. Decorations mean much more than just simply being together with your OWN family. Hell, even ""The Grinch"" told the true meaning of Christmas (y'know, when the Grinch realizes that it's not about gifts, decorations, and all that wonderful stuff).Jamie Lee Curtis, although I have high respect for her, horridly overacts on this movie. It's enough to make you cringe and know that such a fine actor (er... actress) can still make a bad movie. But in this movie, she truly lives up to her name as the ""Scream Queen."" Yeah, expect a LOT of that in this movie alone.Although I did laugh a few times in this movie, the last half of it dulls down when I realized how stupid this movie is. Surely John Grisham's novel ""Skipping Christmas"" (which this movie is based on) is a much better read. He's probably thinking, ""Oh God, what happened here?? This isn't what my book is all about!""This movie is by far THE worst movie I've seen this year. I never thought I'd do this so soon, but this is the first ""item"" that gets one star from me. I kinda leaned towards two stars, but realizing how Christmas isn't celebrated the way it should've been in this movie, it's a stupid and horrible movie.Go watch some of these more enjoyable Christmas movies instead:ElfThe Nightmare Before ChristmasScroogedTrading PlacesDie HardHome AloneBad Santa...hell, even ""Friday After Next"" was much more enjoyable than this garbage.

She always wants to see Christmas movies this time of year and I get somewhat tired of seeing the same ones over and over. Plenty of reviews to see what the story is all about so I'll just jump into my take on it. If I had neighbors that stuck their noses into my life to that extent I would think I was in hell. My wife, on the other hand, thought it was funny. So it's one for ""funny"", one for ""extremely irritating"". The whole idea that taking a cruise at Christmas time is some sort of rejection of Christmas was another point of irritaion. Christmas is wherever you are, isn't it? I lightened up after it was half over and accepted the movie for whatever it was. Seemed to get better near the end of the movie but it was probably due to them caving in to their neighbors expectations. Then there was acceptance and neighborly love in the air. The message here seems to be that life will be better if you would just comform. I almost gave this movie 3 stars but I decided a Christmas movie shouldn't be irritating. Keep in mind that my wife really liked it. If you're tired of seeing all the better Christmas movies, give this one a chance.",2,mixed views,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,1177,"['bought', 'movie', 'wife', 'always', 'see', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'time', 'year', 'get', 'somewhat', 'tired', 'seeing', 'same', 'ones', 'over', 'Plenty', 'reviews', 'see', 'what', 'story', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'jump', 'take', 'had', 'neighbors', 'stuck', 'noses', 'life', 'extent', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'hell', 'My', 'wife', 'other', 'hand', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'one', 'funny', 'one', 'extremely', 'irritating', 'whole', 'idea', 'taking', 'cruise', 'Christmas', 'time', 'sort', 'rejection', 'Christmas', 'was', 'point', 'irritaion', 'Christmas', 'are', ""n't"", 'lightened', 'up', 'was', 'half', 'accepted', 'movie', 'whatever', 'was', 'Seemed', 'get', 'better', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'due', 'caving', 'neighbors', 'expectations', 'Then', 'was', 'acceptance', 'neighborly', 'love', 'air', 'message', 'here', 'be', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'would', 'just', 'comform', 'almost', 'gave', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'decided', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'irritating', 'Keep', 'mind', 'wife', 'really', 'liked', ""'re"", 'tired', 'seeing', 'better', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'give', 'one', 'chance']",Christmas with the Kranks

I understand the concept of loving our children, but when they show up out of the blue, and we must decide whether to honour the needs/wants of our spouse or those of our children, all too often we allow our children to replace our spouses as our best friends. We did not marry our children; they were thrust upon us by genetics. We take care of them until they are able to fly by themselves, but once they are older--like Blair, who now is old enough to have a fiance (read ""adult"")--we must address the task of restoring our spousal relationships to their proper position of paramount importance. This movie fails miserably at this task, and so I find it to be depressing. Yes, the movie is a comedy, but this aspect of the comedy hits too close to home within a society where marital relationships have become grossly devalued. I believe a sillier impetus for the Kranks missing their vacation would have gone a long way in making this movie funnier.
