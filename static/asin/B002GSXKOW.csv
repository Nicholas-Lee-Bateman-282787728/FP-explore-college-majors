What can I say about Mike? He's a genius. This particular item was advertised as being shown in 2.40:1 the original scope it was filmed in. Any thing except the 'original scope' movies is censorship. I do not mind black bars. I don't view censored movies. Full view, or any of the other censored versions of the movie except what original aspect the producer made the movie in is censorship. International Man of Mystery was some anamorific (or what ever they try to pawn off as widescreen)version. It was more like 1.85:1. The other two Austin Powers features (2 and 3) were in the 2.40:1 aspect as they advertised. Spies Like Us is in Full screen. Not ever worth watching.

Besides, Spies Like Us is already included in another set.WB probably figures they can still make a profit off their less favorable movies (box office bombs)by including them in a ""4 for the price of one"" collection. International Spies Collection falls under the category of a great trilogy set with a fourth less stellar flick (see Chris Tucker, Ice Cube sets).  Some collection choices (Batman, Superman, Final Destination, Nightmare etc) are actually great because each movies in the series is collected and that's a major reason why we consumers take interest.",2,"Replace ""Spies"" With A Fourth Mike Myers Comedy Please",1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,743,"['should', ""'ve"", 'put', 'Love', 'Guru', 'fourth', 'film', 'zany', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'character', 'movie', 'better', 'set', 'call', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Collection', 'Besides', 'Spies', 'Us', 'already', 'included', 'set.WB', 'probably', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'profit', 'off', 'less', 'favorable', 'movies', 'box', 'office', 'bombs', 'including', '4', 'price', 'one', 'collection', 'International', 'Spies', 'Collection', 'category', 'great', 'trilogy', 'set', 'fourth', 'less', 'stellar', 'flick', 'see', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'sets', 'collection', 'choices', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Final', 'Destination', 'Nightmare', 'etc', 'are', 'actually', 'great', 'movies', 'series', 'collected', 'major', 'reason', 'why', 'consumers', 'take', 'interest']","4 Film Favorites: International Spies (Austin Powers in Goldmember, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Spies Like Us)"

I can't stand these.  While these are actually very high quality double sided disks (some tend to be thin and fragile), the writing to tell you what is on each side of the disk is microscopic pretty  much (a saving point is the back of the box does break it down for you in bigger print)- Spies Like us.... don't get me wrong.  I love Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase  but the movie isn't all that good.  Another flick by Mike Myers would of been great or perhaps like a 2hr Best of Mike Myers special from SNL or something.  (odds are publishing rights came into contest here)that's about all the negatives which isn't much.  You are getting a fantastic deal here, All the Austin Power's flicks + a bonus movie and they come with everything that the standard DVD's came with all in a neat small package.  I highly recommend this bundle pack and give it 5 stars.  Despite a few flaws they in no way influence the real reason why anyone buys this bundle pack..
