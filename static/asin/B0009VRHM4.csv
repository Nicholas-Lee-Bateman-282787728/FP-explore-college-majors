Smith,"[0, 0]","A distinct lack of dramatic tension afflicts this summer release thriller, but Christian Slater really isn't too bad as the corporate lawyer at the center of a corrupt oil deal at a time in the future when U.S. gas is at $6 a gallon. This came out in '05 before the $4 gallon gas of '08 almost made the movie unexpectedly prescient. Robert Loggia is also pretty good as the corporate tycoon who brokers the deal. A few people get shot. Hey, this is Hollywood. The romances have some heat, too. I'm surprised this one is so under the radar.

914039,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009VRHM4,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[15, 17]","Here's a film that doesn't seem to have gotten a fair shake.  The Deal is a darn good story about corruption, greed, oil, politics, murder, and all sorts of nasty things going on behind Wall Street doors by some of those three-piece suit types.  Christian Slater is a fine actor, Selma Blair proves quite charming, and no movie has ever been hurt by the casting of Robert Loggia.  The fact that such a story is all too believable in today's world serves as a hook of sorts - or maybe not.  All I know is that The Deal is an effective thriller featuring some nice plot twists (although I did see some of them coming - and I'm not usually that good at picking up on things) inside a juicy story.Here's the setting for the film: America is at war with the ""Confederation of Arab states,"" gas is over six bucks a gallon and going nowhere but up, and the economy is seriously on the skids.  Condor, led by its celebrated CEO Jared Tolson (Loggia), is working on a deal to ease America's gas shortage (not to mention fatten his pockets to overflowing) - a merger with Blackstar, a Russian company with deep oil reserves in Kazakhstan (well, supposedly).  All he needs is a hot-shot Wall Street wonderboy from a prestigious company to sweet talk his board into accepting the deal - and that's where Tom Grover (Slater) comes in (after candidate #1, Grover's best friend, gets iced at the start of the movie).  Grover works for an ultra-prestigious firm that is also feeling the economic crunch and could certainly use the $25 million dollars Tom will bring in just by helping Tolson sell the merger.  He signs on, even though he isn't exactly an expert at evaluating geological reports, etc.  That's actually one of the reasons he was chosen, though - Tolson's boys aren't exactly high on Grover doing a lot of research on the fields in question.Representing the forces of good is Abbey Gallagher (Blair), a Harvard graduate who wants to save the world and has an innovative idea for helping those seeking alternative energy sources further their research.  The snake pit of Wall Street is the last place she wants to be, but Gordon convinces her that his company can make her alternative energy dream a reality (because the company can make money by doing so).  The two become close (apparently, Gordon has no qualms about dating an employee), which ultimately puts Abby in danger when Gordon finds out some disturbing truths about his big deal with Tolson.  That, of course, sets the stage for a suspenseful ending.  With himself and Abby in danger, his company sitting on a potential time bomb that could bring it to its knees, and - lest we forget - the national security interests of the whole country at stake, what will Gordon do?  What can he do?The Deal never manages to be edge-of-your-seat thrilling, but it is certainly suspenseful.  It's also quite relevant in today's world of government corruption, unethical business practices, and moral ambiguity.  The deal itself is the kind of thing J.R. Ewing would probably be cooking up if Dallas were still on the air - but J.R. would have done a better job of it.",4,The Deal is a pretty big deal of a movie,1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,3114,"['Here', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'gotten', 'fair', 'shake', 'Deal', 'darn', 'good', 'story', 'corruption', 'greed', 'oil', 'politics', 'murder', 'sorts', 'nasty', 'things', 'going', 'Wall', 'Street', 'doors', 'three-piece', 'suit', 'types', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'fine', 'actor', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'quite', 'charming', 'movie', 'ever', 'been', 'hurt', 'casting', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'fact', 'story', 'too', 'believable', 'today', 'world', 'hook', 'sorts', 'maybe', 'not', 'know', 'Deal', 'effective', 'thriller', 'featuring', 'nice', 'plot', 'twists', 'did', 'see', 'coming', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'good', 'picking', 'up', 'things', 'juicy', 'setting', 'film', 'America', 'war', 'Confederation', 'Arab', 'states', 'gas', 'six', 'bucks', 'gallon', 'going', 'nowhere', 'up', 'economy', 'seriously', 'skids', 'Condor', 'led', 'celebrated', 'CEO', 'Jared', 'Tolson', 'Loggia', 'working', 'deal', 'ease', 'America', 'gas', 'shortage', 'not', 'mention', 'fatten', 'pockets', 'overflowing', 'merger', 'Blackstar', 'Russian', 'company', 'deep', 'oil', 'reserves', 'Kazakhstan', 'well', 'supposedly', 'hot-shot', 'Wall', 'Street', 'wonderboy', 'prestigious', 'company', 'sweet', 'talk', 'board', 'accepting', 'deal', 'where', 'Tom', 'Grover', 'Slater', 'candidate', '1', 'Grover', 'best', 'friend', 'iced', 'start', 'movie', 'Grover', 'ultra-prestigious', 'firm', 'also', 'feeling', 'economic', 'crunch', 'could', 'certainly', 'use', '25', 'million', 'dollars', 'Tom', 'will', 'bring', 'just', 'helping', 'Tolson', 'sell', 'merger', 'signs', 'even', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'expert', 'evaluating', 'geological', 'reports', 'etc', 'actually', 'one', 'reasons', 'was', 'chosen', 'Tolson', 'boys', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'high', 'Grover', 'doing', 'lot', 'research', 'fields', 'question.Representing', 'forces', 'good', 'Abbey', 'Gallagher', 'Blair', 'Harvard', 'graduate', 'who', 'save', 'world', 'innovative', 'idea', 'helping', 'seeking', 'alternative', 'energy', 'sources', 'further', 'research', 'snake', 'pit', 'Wall', 'Street', 'last', 'place', 'be', 'Gordon', 'company', 'can', 'make', 'alternative', 'energy', 'dream', 'reality', 'company', 'can', 'make', 'money', 'doing', 'so', 'two', 'become', 'close', 'apparently', 'Gordon', 'qualms', 'dating', 'employee', 'ultimately', 'Abby', 'danger', 'when', 'Gordon', 'out', 'disturbing', 'truths', 'big', 'deal', 'Tolson', 'course', 'stage', 'suspenseful', 'ending', 'Abby', 'danger', 'company', 'sitting', 'potential', 'time', 'bomb', 'could', 'bring', 'knees', 'lest', 'forget', 'national', 'security', 'interests', 'whole', 'country', 'stake', 'what', 'will', 'Gordon', 'do', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'Deal', 'never', 'be', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'thrilling', 'certainly', 'suspenseful', 'also', 'quite', 'relevant', 'today', 'world', 'government', 'corruption', 'unethical', 'business', 'practices', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'deal', 'kind', 'thing', 'J.R.', 'Ewing', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'cooking', 'up', 'Dallas', 'were', 'still', 'air', 'J.R.', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job']",The Deal
914040,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B0009VRHM4,e. verrillo,"[1, 3]","This film was so disjointed, so poorly written, and so poorly conceived, that it was almost impossible to follow.The premise was simple: the US is at war with the CAS (Confederation of Arab States), therefore the price of oil has skyrocketed to $6 a gallon, generating fist fights in New Jersey gas stations (something that absolutely would never, ever happen in New Jersey otherwise).  So, where, oh where, are we going to get our oil? From Kazakhstan, naturally, which, according to this film is run by the Russian mafia. But, the oil isn't really in Kazakhstan, it's in the CAS and is simply being funneled through Kazakhstan, which, of course is illegal.  So, in order to push through this shady maneuver, several people have to be shot, big law firms have to be suckered, and seductions must happen, because we NEED that CAS oil, and the environmentalists (damn their tree-hugging souls) won't let us drill for it here.First of all, the premise was flawed. We don't, and never have gotten the bulk of our oil from any kind of Arab state.  Half of what we consume comes from right here in the US, and the other half is imported mostly from Canada and Latin America. A war with the Middle East would not cut off our supply of oil.  And, in any event, the price of oil is not dependent on supply and demand. The price of oil is determined by the spec market in Amsterdam, and by oil refineries (which are fungible). (Besides, wouldn't a long war WITH the CAS imply that they had armies, airforce, some kind of fighting power? How did they get it? And if they weren't selling their oil to us, who were they selling it to? Our allies in Europe? Asia? Highly unlikely...)But aside from the fact that this film had no basis in reality, it was simply horribly written. I swear the writer had to be a computer, because this film used every single ""political thriller"" cliche in existence (all the way from ""Natasha the Russian spy"" to ""the Harvard grad idealist""), throwing them together at random in choppy, incoherent sequences. And then, when the program for ""plot"" ran dry, it added ""soulful music"" filler which was positively mind boggling in its pointlessness.Avoid this film.

914041,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009VRHM4,Grady Harp,"[7, 12]","THE DEAL was made when the idea of paying $6 per gallon of gas would spark international intrigue: now that we're well over $3.35 per gallon that price seems less than shocking!  The concept of showing how big business and the government cover up the absurd under the table Deals such as the one that is the focus of this meager script is now so de rigueur that there is no melodrama or intrigue to this story.  One must credit writer Ruth Epstein, director Harvey Kahn, and executive producer/star Christian Slater for caring enough about the chaos  oil supplies and their impact on the world at large are causing, but the sad truth is that this tale is so ho-hum in that we all read this very story in the newspaper everyday that it hardly seems to merit a movie.The cast is sterling - Christian Slater as a Wall Street type, Robert Loggia as the dirty hands dealer type, Selma Blair as the idealist, and Colm Feore, John Heard, Kevin Tighe, etc  all try their best to make this flabby script meaningful.  The star of the movie is the musical scoring by Christopher Lennertz...and that says a lot.  Without an arc of plotline and without a bit of new information about the corruption at the highest levels of this country, this film just doesn't get off the ground.

914042,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0009VRHM4,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 9]","Christian Slater serves as Executive Producer & star of this drama.  It's the kind of Wall Street high intrigue where ethics takes a back seat to profits.  This is producer Harvey Kahn's 2nd turn as director after his straight-to-video film ""Water's Edge"" in 2002.  Christian Slater plays Tom Hansen who comes into a deal with Condor Oil & Gas after his best friend is murdered.  Slater who was first noticed in ""The Name of the Rose"" in 1986 with Sean Connery and then appeared in ""Bed of Roses"" & ""Broken Arrow"" in 1996 and in ""Mindhunters"" this year is an interesting and intense actor whose mannerisms remind me of Jack Nicholson. As Hansen, he works for a firm whose high ethical reputation Condor wants to use to put forward a shady billion dollar oil deal to import oil from an area in Russia in which there is no oil.  The fact that it would be smuggled from Arab countries with which the U.S. has banned itself from doing business has resulted in the oil-laundering scheme.  Robert Loggia who played with David Ducovney in ""Return to Me"" and was nominated for his lone Oscar nod as supporting actor in ""Jagged Edge"" in 1985 plays Jared Tolson, a high powered wheeler-dealer who includes assassination and kidnapping as necessary negotiating tools.  Tolson passes the deal to Hansen, hoping his inexperience in oil will lead him to overlook the flaws in the deal.  Slater's Hansen is having trouble finding a girl.  Angie Harmon from the ""Law & Order"" TV series and the upcoming ""Fun With Dick & Jane"" with Jim Carrey & Tea Leoni plays Anna, who appears to have great interest in Tom, only to let her American accent drop and reveal she's an operative for the Russian mafia who will murder to make sure the deal goes through.  After flirting with Anna, Hansen hires Abbey Gallagher, who he finally beds, only to drop her from the Condor deal when her life is threatened.  Gallagher is played by Selma Blair from ""Cruel Intentions,"" ""Legally Blonde"" & ""The Fog.""  She investigates and puts her life in danger as she uncovers the truth about the deal.  Gallagher's advisor is Professor Roseman played by John Heard who encourages her.  Oil expert Hank at the firm is miffed that a novice like Hansen has been given the Condor deal and begins working to uncover the truth also.  Played by Colm Feore from ""The Highwayman"" with Jim Caviezel, ""Chicago,"" & ""Paycheck"" with Ben Affleck, Hank finally blows the whistle at the company meeting, only to be outmaneuvered.  Francois Yip who also plays with Slater in this year's ""Alone in the Dark"" plays Janice who helps Hansen take his concerns to the ethics panel after Gallagher is safe.  Then we get to the moral relativity of the picture as a U.S. Senator intervenes saying that the bogus deal is an act of patriotism since gas is over $6 a gallon and we need the oil, even if we have to pretend it's not coming from designated terrorist states.  The film's moral ambiguity leaves us on a disquieting note.  While not explaining why we simply don't press for energy sources other than fossil fuels, it does smack of real-world compromise.  Slater does a good job in a film with a timely topic as we scramble for gas here in the Southeast after Hurricane Katrina disrupted the pipelines.

914045,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009VRHM4,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 6]","`The Deal' starring Christian Slater (also co-exective producer) is at best a mediocre political thriller with no convincing views on international politics. No one interested in the news of the world would believe in the complicated plot though the script itself (by first-timer Ruth Epstein) is not without merit, especially when it deals with the ethics of corporate company and those who are working for them. But whatever good about it is buried deep in the film's preposterous story and the showy camera work.The film's very confusing script starts with one premise - we are informed that the USA has been at war with the (fictional) ""Arab Federation"" for more than three years. The prices of gas and other things skyrocket because of the shortage of oil.Now I know some people find the story intriguing. With all respect to them, I disagree. As seen in `Syriana' the Arabs have its own conflicting powers within themselves. And at war for as many as three years? The film seems to forget that for better or worse, America is the only superpower in the world now.But let's forget that part for now. Christian Slater plays an ambitious executive who is in charge of an assessment report about the oilfield of a Russian oil company. However, there is something strange about the maps and figures, he realizes, and he and his girlfriend (Selma Blair) are pressed by the unknown forces to ignore certain things about the company in case.Though `The Deal' deals with international politics, its story is only a standard thriller scenario. The film is apparently about the intricate foreign policies of the government or the company merger and its ethical aspect involving stockholders, but the truth is it is nothing but B-thriller with `Been-there-Done-that' situations. See the romance between Slater and Blair, for example. They kiss and hug in a hotel elevator (check), and next they make love, leaning on the wall (check). And there are also Russian mafias (check). The supports played by Robert Loggia and Colm Feore are just ciphers, but that is no surprise after these checks the filmmakers should have done.`The Deal' should have been an intelligent thriller, considering the political issue it deals with while every character who is supposed to be working at somewhere like Wall Street keep on doing incredibly stupid decisions. It is a thriller, a so-so one, but its political aspect is needs much more polishing up.",2,"Political Thriller?

When Slater finally realizes what is happening, he would have gone directly to the FBI with his girlfriend.  After all, we are told in the beginning of the film that the FBI are paying close attention to these oil mergers. But he acts stupid?  His life and his girlfriend's life are on the line and he keeps playing the game?  He doesn't seek protection and call in the professionals?  This stupid course of action is never explained.One star because I like Slater's acting talents -- even in a bad movie.",1,Bad Movie,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,549,"['Illogical', 'film', 'script', 'not', 'work', 'When', 'Slater', 'finally', 'what', 'happening', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'directly', 'FBI', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'told', 'beginning', 'film', 'FBI', 'are', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'oil', 'mergers', 'stupid', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'life', 'are', 'line', 'playing', 'game', ""n't"", 'seek', 'protection', 'call', 'professionals', 'stupid', 'course', 'action', 'never', 'explained.One', 'star', 'like', 'Slater', 'acting', 'talents', 'even', 'bad', 'movie']",The Deal
