1088970,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,B000TAN904,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[1, 2]","The movie concerns Nick Powell (Justin Chatwin) a run of the mill teen, who just happens to be a little rich. He and his mom haven't been as close as they could have been since his dad's death. Now, Justin is just about to take a major step and go to London without his mom's approval for a writing course. He is kind of a winner / golden boy in the high school pecking order, concerned with his biggest drama, becoming a writer. On the last days before he is set to London he gets into a fight with the local bully girl...Annie Newton while defending a friend of his. Annie is a ""bad"" girl. Sleeps around with a thug much older than her, beats people up and steals jewelry when not in school. But, she has long pretty hair and a good heart -- really.  She just has it rough.Nick is framed for turning in Annie for stealing jewelry and she and her gang beat him up to within an inch of his life. It is implied that Annie does it in part because she wished she were dead. But Nick isn't dead and is trapped between life and death. No one can hear him, he can't affect the world around him, until, he learns, Annie can hear him. There is no explanation for this but I think Annie is supposed to be so wishing for death herself she might be close to it or something. As Nick follows Annie around he learns about how bad she has it and starts to feel something for her and Annie, hearing Nick all the time and checking out his life and grieving mom, truly regrets what happened (seems like she did almost immediately) and eventually makes the decision to save Nick no matter the consequences.I thought 80% of this movie was good and I was hooked right up until the end, but, at the end, wow, things went off track. I won't give it away but if you hate stories like twilight you will hate this ending. I also don't really understand the ending. It is kind of implied that Annie gives her life for Nick.. but how... is not really clear. Some might find it romantic, but I am just too jaded ... so I wouldn't watch it again.

1088976,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000TAN904,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[12, 17]","If you were a film maker and happened upon a bad premise that ended just as bad as it started, you'd probably want to hide. And thus, I believe, is where THE INVISIBLE received its true title.Based EXTREMELY loosely on the 2002 Swedish thriller DEN OSYNLIGE, The Invisible is so wrought with problems as to be sadly laughable.First let's look at the premise of the film. A nearly murdered boy named Nick (Justin Chatwin,Weeds) comes back to `life' ...but doesn't. He's a ghost of himself but doesn't know why, nor does the viewing audience. Perhaps he's being taught some ethereal lesson? Who knows?Second is the hot-tough-chick who `kills' Nick named Annie (Margarita Levieva). She's battling demons both in her private life and her school, finding trouble wherever it may lay. And when she thinks she's killed Nick, she suddenly grows a conscious. Why she does is, again, unclear. But, oh, there's the fact that this troubled girl who `killed' this fellow school mate can suddenly hear him, too. Again, we're unsure why this is. One would think that Nick's mom (Marcia Gay Harden,Into the Wild) would be the one to hear her own son. After all, she has a genetic connection to him and would probably be the one most likely to hear his near-death pleas. But ...no.Third is the woefully lame ending. Why Nick's mother would allow his would-be killer into his hospital room is beyond ludicrous. And the fact that she laid down and `poof!' Nick is once again `alive' is pure schlock to the highest degree.One would think that Director David S. Goyer would come up with something powerful and moving, especially when you consider he did some amazing writing work on films such asDark City,BladeandBatman Begins. But ...no. I guess they all can't be winners. I bet Mr. Goyer wishes he were invisible after the release of this mess.P.S. Also, when some guys move Nick's 'body', it makes ZERO sense since they leave it out in the open versus where it was, which was a place that had already been searched and was hidden from view.",1,A Schlock-Fest Mess,1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,2023,"['were', 'film', 'maker', 'happened', 'bad', 'premise', 'ended', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'started', ""'d"", 'probably', 'want', 'hide', 'thus', 'believe', 'where', 'THE', 'INVISIBLE', 'received', 'true', 'title.Based', 'EXTREMELY', 'loosely', '2002', 'Swedish', 'thriller', 'DEN', 'OSYNLIGE', 'Invisible', 'so', 'wrought', 'problems', 'be', 'sadly', 'laughable.First', 'let', 'look', 'premise', 'film', 'nearly', 'murdered', 'boy', 'named', 'Nick', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Weeds', 'back', 'life', ""n't"", 'ghost', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'viewing', 'audience', 'Perhaps', 'being', 'taught', 'ethereal', 'lesson', 'Who', 'Second', 'hot-tough-chick', 'who', 'kills', 'Nick', 'named', 'Annie', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'battling', 'demons', 'private', 'life', 'school', 'finding', 'trouble', 'may', 'lay', 'when', 'killed', 'Nick', 'suddenly', 'conscious', 'Why', 'again', 'unclear', 'oh', 'fact', 'troubled', 'girl', 'who', 'killed', 'fellow', 'school', 'mate', 'can', 'suddenly', 'hear', 'too', 'Again', ""'re"", 'unsure', 'why', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'Nick', 'mom', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Into', 'Wild', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'hear', 'own', 'son', 'genetic', 'connection', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'hear', 'near-death', 'pleas', 'no.Third', 'woefully', 'lame', 'ending', 'Why', 'Nick', 'mother', 'would', 'allow', 'would-be', 'killer', 'hospital', 'room', 'ludicrous', 'fact', 'laid', 'down', 'poof', 'Nick', 'once', 'again', 'alive', 'pure', 'schlock', 'highest', 'degree.One', 'would', 'think', 'Director', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'powerful', 'moving', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'did', 'amazing', 'writing', 'work', 'films', 'such', 'asDark', 'City', 'BladeandBatman', 'Begins', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'winners', 'bet', 'Mr.', 'Goyer', 'were', 'invisible', 'release', 'mess.P.S', 'Also', 'when', 'guys', 'move', 'Nick', ""'body"", 'ZERO', 'sense', 'leave', 'out', 'open', 'versus', 'where', 'was', 'was', 'place', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'searched', 'was', 'hidden', 'view']",N/A

1088979,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000TAN904,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","""The Invisible"" is a story told in the language of melancholy, specifically in the classic form of teenage angst. Practically every character is a brooding mass of emotions, and they populate a physical world that's perpetually foggy and gray. Considering the subject matter, it's easy to see why such a muted atmosphere was preferred; the human drama in this story is abundant. The twist is that a supernatural component has been added, which, I must admit, I found interesting. But I also found it baffling and, at times, nonsensical. It would be unfair of me to say that I knew what to expect from this film, but I was definitely not expecting such an implausible, melodramatic story with unlikable characters.The plot focuses on Nick Powell (Justin Chatwin), a rich eighteen-year-old high school student on the verge of graduation. He's been a troubled soul ever since his father died. Now he's a miserable writer, expressing himself through needlessly artsy poetry. No one in his class gets his writing, which makes him feel unappreciated. He has a friend that (for reasons I won't elaborate on) isn't much of a friend at all. And of course, he hates his mother (Marcia Gay Harden), a woman so orderly and unfeeling that he feels suffocated when in the same room with her. In the scheme of things, he's going through normal teenage issues. Because of that, I didn't feel sorry for him; I might have sympathized had he actually had something to complain about. Despite being incredibly articulate and independent, he's immature; to escape his current life, he plans to run off to London to join a writing workshop. I can't help but wonder how much thought he put into such a drastic decision.But before he gets to leave, he has a disastrous encounter with Annie Newton (Margarita Levieva), a juvenile delinquent in every sense. After robbing the display window of a jewelry store (which doesn't make sense, as jewelry stores never display real jewelry at their windows), she's ratted out and arrested. Through a series of lies, she comes to believe that Nick is responsible for this. In an act of vengeance, she and her cronies track him down, drag him into the forest, and beat him senseless. Things take a turn for the worst when they think that Nick has been killed; in desperation, they dump his body in a manhole, cover it, and leave.The next day, we see Nick at school, slowly coming to the realization that no one can see or hear him. Every object he touches and moves ends up back in its original position, as if it hadn't been touched at all (we first see this in his classroom, when he throws a textbooks and breaks a shelf; not only does the book end up back on the desk, the shelf fixes itself, as well). He initially comes to the conclusion that he's dead. But then he returns home and sees a dying bird: as it struggles in pain, Nick holds the bird's spirit in his hands; when it finally dies, its spirit disappears. Nick then realizes that he's still alive, and his spirit is stuck in limbo.At this point, the police have gotten involved. Nick follows everyone around (seemingly at once) hoping to lead them to the location of his body. He primarily follows Annie as her situation goes from bad to worse (in both her family and social life). I never bought into the relationship that begins to develop; after a while, she becomes aware of Nick's presence, and can even understand the things he's saying to her. He seems to think that she's the only one who can save him, but I don't know why. Could he not have mentally linked with the police, or his mother? Was there really no one else to rely on for help? By the time Annie's emotionally pendulum swing towards guilt, it's too late to have sympathy for her. Even with a rotten home life, even with a dangerous boyfriend (Alex O'Loughlin), she still attacked an innocent person and left him for dead. Someone like that doesn't deserve a reprieve from the audience.When Annie goes to check Nick's body, she discovers that it's been moved. This turn of events is even worse for Nick himself, who understands that he's just inches away from death. I won't get into all the emotional components of this drama, but I will say that it piles itself on far too thick. Consider a moment between Nick and his mother--she sits at her desk, typing away, while he screams out his frustrations. The real point of the scene is to show that she's not as unfeeling as she's initially presented. Why did we need to see this? Did we really need to be reminded that she loves her son? Keep in mind that she also lost her husband, and back-to-back losses can't be easy to handle. He says that she's not doing enough to save him, despite the fact that she immediately called the police, who in turn assigned a search team to comb the forest with cadaver-sniffing dogs. A tad ungrateful, don't you think?But the biggest problem with this film is Annie, a character that was very improperly developed. I'm all for complex characters, but I think there's such a thing as too much complexity; by the end of the film, her role has shifted from Messed Up Teenager to Assigned Savior. I didn't believe this transition for a second, especially during a moment between her and Nick's mother. I still don't understand why it became Annie's responsibility to save Nick's life. Truth be told, I still don't understand why this story had to be told so dramatically. Every scene is an emotional ordeal, and there's always at least one character that's crying, angry, or depressed. Such is the reality of ""The Invisible,"" a film that refuses to let the audience enjoy itself.",3,Between the Afterlives,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,5609,"['Invisible', 'story', 'told', 'language',

And the funny thing is, I really don't know why.Maybe because I like to believe that there is good in pretty much everyone and someone atoning for wrong-doings, well there are few things that I like to see more than this.Also, as the old saying goes, you can never judge a book by its cover. When you see a person, do you always judge them by the way they look or dress? Do you automatically assume, for example, if you see a man dressed in biker clothes that he's a criminal?See, when it comes down to it, you can't judge a book by its cover. There is typically more to something than meets the eye. What if that person you see dressed like a biker just happens to be a real estate agent out for a ride, enjoying himself?It can happen.Take what you consider to be your typical young street thug. Dressed and acts tough, but what are the reasons behind the way they act? What is their home life like? Maybe, just maybe they're committing crimes not out of greed but the need to survive or take care of someone else?Of course, these examples are just that, examples.Anyhow, the movie the Invisible deals with both of these topics.A young man named Nick, ready to graduate from High school lives with his widowed mother. She's domineering, and has pretty much planned out his life for him.The upside is that he wants pretty much for naught. He has friends, and appears that he's respected by his peers.Enter a young troubled girl named Annie. She's in and out of trouble with the law and is expelled regularly from School. Somehow she's managed to get a couple of the local tough's working along with her.Throw in a friend of Nick's who owes Annie money for merchandise that he purchased from her.Things get ugly and fast. Nick ends up getting framed for something that he didn't do and Annie takes it out on him. Nick is left for dead and then things get even more complicated.Nick returns as a ghost. The twist is that he's not dead, not yet. He only has a limited time before his body does die, and somehow he has to find away to interact with the living world to make this happen.He can see, feel and initially it appears that he can interact with the world around him, but he quickly discovers that when he changes something, the very next moment it's back to normal.The problem is that after a while, the only one who seems to be able to hear him is the very person who left him for dead. The young street thug named Annie.Here we have what I was talking about. Nick seems like the perfect young man, but he has a darker, a seedier side, albeit minor, where as Annie looks like a pure criminal who doesn't care about anyone or anything, and doesn't give a damn what her actions - rash actions - end up costing her.For your average Teen movie, the acting was pretty good. I felt anger towards the characters, and sympathy as well. Also, it gives a glimpse into the lives of people, showing the viewer that things are not always as they appear on the surface.Maybe as I grow older, I'm no longer able to control my emotions the way did in my younger years. Who knows.Still, I enjoyed the movie.There weren't too many additional features, just 13 minutes of deleted scenes that helped advance the plot a little, but most of these were nothing more than filler. There were also a pair of music videos to watch.The soundtrack had a lot of music on it that I personally like, preferring rock to pop. It featured songs by A Perfect Circle, Snow Patrol and Remy zero.There were a couple of glaring errors in continuity, but as usual, nothing that really detracted from my overall enjoyment of this flick. Shame that I didn't catch it in the Theater.Finally, the ending was well shot and quite emotional.

Goyer (writer ofThe Blade TrilogyandBatman Begins) makes a departure from the ""comic book"" movies for which he is best known, and instead helms this remake of a Swedish supernatural thriller. The screenplay was co-written by Mick Davis and Christine Roum, and was based in part upon the novel by Mats Wahl. The Invisible tells a story of teen angst, of near death experiences, and of redemption through selflessness (in this case literally).Nick Powell is an intelligent, good looking, popular eighteen year old with a bright future ahead of him. But despite his talents and his popularity, he is lost within himself, struggling to break free of other people's perception of him. This only happens after Nick's best friend betrays him in order to save himself. Nick is beaten up by his troubled schoolmate Annie and her gang, who falsely believe that nick snitched on Annie after she broke into a jewelry store. After the brutal attack Annie realizes that she was carried away in her rage, and that Nick is dead... but he isn't. She and her friends hide Nick's body in the forest, not knowing that he's still alive. The next day Nick emerges from the woods and goes to school, only to find that no one can see or hear him, and that he has no physical effect on his environment. Nick has become a disembodied spirit and the only way for him to survive is for someone to find his unconscious body before it dies. Yet how can he lead anyone to it when no one is aware of his presence? No one, except for guilt-ridden Annie. Nick watches as the lives of his mother, his friends, his classmates, unravel in his absence, and he begins to haunt Annie. Soon Nick and Annie develop an understanding of one another and they even come to respect each other. But can Annie, a social outcast with explosive anger, help Nick and can Nick, the seeming ""golden boy"", allow himself to be vulnerable enough to trust her and save himself in the process?Despite the predictable storyline and the overall lack of originality, The Invisible is effective enough as a thriller. This is mostly due to the talented cast, which features Justin Chatwin, Margarita Levieva, Chris Marquette, and Marcia gay Harden. Of the cast, both Justin Chatwin and Margarita Levieva give the most impressive performances as Nick and Annie.While the film is entertaining, it lacks the emotional impact that most viewers will crave. However it is worth seeing if you are intrigued by stories of the supernatural or if you're a David S.

Totally.The main character, Nick, is beaten mostly to death and the movie is (ostensibly) about his ghost (if that's the right word, since he's not really dead) running around town trying to get people to hear him and locate his body and try to revive him.  Unfortunately, no one can hear him.Except for Annie, a seriously troubled girl and, coincidentally, the one who put him in the ground in the first place.No one in this movie is remotely sympathetic, and by half way through I just stopped caring whether anyone lived or died.  Nick is one of those emo brooding ""I'm so misunderstood because beneath my perfect exterior and apparent affluence I'm really very sad"" guys.  Annie's home life leaves much to be desired, and though she is written to care a lot about her younger brother Victor, she engages in all kinds of criminal activity exhibiting a reckless disregard for her own life and the law.  And Pete, Nick's friend who is unwittingly pulled into the violence/near-murder, is a weak little loser, and I couldn't decide whether I wanted him or Annie to die more.Nick's mother is also one-dimensional, though weak efforts were, in fact, made to try to give her some depth.  (Those efforts failed miserably.)  Likewise, Annie's erstwhile boyfriend lacks any value and I have no idea what was running though that idiotic mind of his.  And Annie's two cronies also lack credibility:  really, why don't they just tell Annie to piss off and do her own dirty work?Anyway... yeah, the movie's not very good at all.

1088985,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B000TAN904,Derek,"[2, 3]","I'm just going to jump right into this one feet first. I didn't like the film. David S. Goyer has his shining movie moments (helped pen movies likeBatman BeginsandThe Dark Knight) but leaves something to be desired with his directing. My main problem with this film is how illogical it all was and how I was left with a lot of unanswered questions. It seems that the main character is surrounded by jerks and cowards as well. His friend is a jerk, his mother is a jerk, the girl he likes is a jerk, so on and so forth. But let's start at the beginning:The basic idea of the story is about a spoiled, rich kid who gets blamed for something he didn't do (nice friend he's got) and is nearly beat to death. While his body remains alive, he moves around the rest of the movie as a spirit and tries to get someone to find his body so that he can be saved before dying for sure. The story is intriguing, just not well played out. One of the first things that threw me off was after he has been beaten and left for dead, his spirit walks out of the forest in the morning and his first instinct is to... go to school? Even if you don't remember being beaten up, why would you walk out of a forest in the morning and say to yourself, ""Why am I here? Oh, it's morning, I better get to class."" Um... okay.Anyways, aside from that, I didn't like how the movie attempted to make you have pity on Annie, an evil girl who is responsible for nearly killing Nick, the main character. This girl steals, she cuts people's fingernails off, she kills people, she's a freakin' jerk to everyone she meets, she runs from the police several times in several ways... and we're supposed to like her somehow? They attempt to make you feel sorrow for her situation because her mom left when she was young and they show all these scenes where you are supposed to be sad about her predicament (even Nick pities her and begins to like her), but I felt no sympathy or remorse for her. Even when she is supposed to do something redeeming in the end, I still didn't like her or think any higher of her. And the fact that they kept trying to make me feel pity for her just made me dislike her more. But I'll stop ranting on her for now. Let's move on to the cops.The cops in this film seemed intelligent at times - they knew where to look for evidence and who to keep their eye on - but did nothing to solve the case. The main cop knew who was guilty and never did a thing about it. He would walk up to each guilty person and say, ""I know what you did."" The person would deny it and he'd say, ""Okay, call me if you want to confess,"" and just walk away. He had all the evidence that he needed, he just never used any of it. Plus, the cops weren't very proactive in catching anyone. Several times, Annie would be in a position where she logically would have been caught and taken to jail, but she would just run away and all the cops would slothfully attempt to catch her but, ""Oh, shoot. We missed her. She's just on the other side of this fence, but we'll never catch her. I guess we'll just try again tomorrow."" Right. If our police were that useless in the real world, no one would ever get caught.As far as loop holes go, there are way to many to discuss; this post is already becoming a novel. One of the main ones that irked me was how no one could hear or see Nick, not even Annie. But suddenly, without any catalyst that we know of (no near-death experience, no electrocution from a hair-dryer), Annie suddenly has the ability to hear Nick. Why? This leads into the worst love story out there. Suddenly, because she can hear his voice, she begins to fall for Nick, even to the point where she randomly sneaks into his house (without checking to see if someone was home) and begins going through his stuff.

1088986,A2Z44AN3F2IN61,B000TAN904,D. K. Stokes,"[0, 2]","We saw this after being very intrigued by the previews. Unfortunately, as it turns out, the previews had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the movie. Okay, that's an exaggeration. The premise shown in the previews is what has nothing to do with the movie. ""How do you solve a murder when the victim ... is YOU?"" has nothing to do with the movie. There's no murder, there's no mystery.  What there is, is a heavy-handed metaphor: kids feel invisible.Nick Powell (Justin Chatwin) is a high school senior from a wealthy family. Oddly, he attends a public school, where he has a run-in with violent juvenile delinquent Annie Newton (Margarita Levieva), but he's so very cool that he defuses the situation.Meanwhile, his mom (Marcia Gay Harden) has been smothering and controlling since his father's death, and she's so mean she won't let him go to London for a writing workshop. Because, as everybody knows, London is the only place to learn to become a writer. And if he doesn't go, his life is over.Then Annie's out with her boyfriend and robs a jewelry store window. Her boyfriend warns her she's out of control, but she doesn't listen, so he turns her in to the cops. Except she decides it must have been Nick who did it. So she and her henchmen attack Nick and when it appears they've killed him, they dump him in a manhole in the woods (?), cover it up, and run off.Nick then is literally invisible, and nobody can hear him except Annie, eventually, and he has to convince her to save him.There are some pretty clever scenes when he first realizes he's invisible, first showing some action on his part and its consequences, then showing that nothing really happened. That was actually my favorite part of the movie.Both of our boys (ages 12 and 17) watched with us, and they both liked The Invisible much more than I did. Unsurprisingly--it's aimed at teenagers. And no, I didn't try to change their minds. We did, however, discuss the fact that Hollywood's version of high school doesn't bear a lot of resemblance to real life.I got the distinct feeling that the filmmakers changed the movie's focus halfway through--after they'd shot the trailers. It wasn't until halfway through the movie that it became clear that it wasn't a paranormal murder mystery, and the movie seemed a lot more forced after that point. The ending/rescue scene(s) dragged on and on, apparently to hammer home the point that Annie needed to redeem herself, apparently by revealing... her hair. (She wears a knit cap through most of the movie, and amazingly, when she removes it--pointing out that now she's good--she doesn't have hat hair, she has lovely, wavy, quite long hair.)*sigh* Freshman film classes are going to love this one. All that wonderful symbolism, easily identified. They can write whole essays on the meaning of Annie's hair alone.",2,"bait & switch, heavy-handed metaphors",1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,2835,"['saw', 'being', 'very', 'intrigued', 'previews', 'Unfortunately', 'out', 'previews', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'movie', 'Okay', 'exaggeration', 'premise', 'shown', 'previews', 'what', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'How', 'do', 'solve', 'murder', 'when', 'victim', 'YOU', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'murder', 'mystery', 'What', 'heavy-handed', 'metaphor', 'kids', 'feel', 'invisible.Nick', 'Powell', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Oddly', 'public', 'school', 'where', 'run-in', 'violent', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'Annie', 'Newton', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'so', 'very', 'cool', 'situation.Meanwhile', 'mom', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'been', 'smothering', 'controlling', 'father', 'death', 'so', 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'London', 'writing', 'workshop', 'everybody', 'London', 'only', 'place', 'learn', 'become', 'writer', ""n't"", 'go', 'life', 'over.Then', 'Annie', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'robs', 'jewelry', 'store', 'window', 'boyfriend', 'control', ""n't"", 'listen', 'cops', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Nick', 'who', 'did', 'henchmen', 'attack', 'Nick', 'when', ""'ve"", 'killed', 'dump', 'manhole', 'woods', 'cover', 'up', 'run', 'off.Nick', 'then', 'literally', 'invisible', 'nobody', 'can', 'hear', 'Annie', 'eventually', 'convince', 'save', 'are', 'pretty', 'clever', 'scenes', 'when', 'first', 'invisible', 'first', 'showing', 'action', 'part', 'consequences', 'then', 'showing', 'nothing', 'really', 'happened', 'was', 'actually', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie.Both', 'boys', 'ages', '12', '17', 'watched', 'liked', 'Invisible', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'Unsurprisingly', 'aimed', 'teenagers', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'change', 'minds', 'did', 'however', 'fact', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'high', 'school', ""n't"", 'bear', 'lot', 'resemblance', 'real', 'life.I', 'got', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'changed', 'movie', 'focus', 'halfway', ""'d"", 'shot', 'trailers', 'was', ""n't"", 'halfway', 'movie', 'became', 'clear', 'was', ""n't"", 'paranormal', 'murder', 'mystery', 'movie', 'seemed', 'lot', 'more', 'forced', 'point', 'ending/rescue', 'scene', 'dragged', 'apparently', 'hammer', 'home', 'point', 'Annie', 'needed', 'redeem', 'apparently', 'revealing', 'hair', 'knit', 'cap', 'most', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'when', 'pointing', 'out', 'now', 'good', ""n't"", 'have', 'hat', 'hair', 'lovely', 'wavy', 'quite', 'long', 'hair', '*sigh*', 'Freshman', 'film', 'classes', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'one', 'wonderful', 'symbolism', 'easily', 'identified', 'can', 'write', 'whole', 'essays', 'meaning', 'Annie', 'hair', 'alone']",N/A

So, honestly, I couldn't wait to see it.Man, talk about a huge letdown!The acting is laughable. The screenplay is lame. The direction will make you cringe.1. The acting - All the actors in this movie sucked, but the worst has got to be the dead kid's mom. This lady is a freakin robot! Sure, you can say that life's tragedies have numbed her, but c'mon!!! She played the part like if she was in The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Maybe the director told her to play it like that, but he sucks too, so that isn't a good reason.2. The screenplay - It's amatuer. The dialogue is dumb. The whole thing is just lame. And the whole thing of making the girl kill the guy then love the guy was horribly stupid.3. The director - *sigh* David Goyer... you are an example of someone who was at the right place at the right time and just got lucky. You were lucky to have a hand in Batman Begins cause that has given you incredible clout. But let's face it, you're a horrible director.

I watch a lot of films and comment on only the few that move me on a level more than pure entertainment. This is one of those movies.Many of a younger generation will relate with intense spectrum of feelings the characters portray in here. But beyond teen angst, there is a deeper message. Few movies these days can actually be used to drive conversation with teenagers and I think this is one of them.At first I thought the movie wasn't going to be much, but then the deepening of the characters and the true message started to shine through and continued to the very end.2/3rds of the way through I had no idea what was going to happen. Closer to the end it became obvious but it no more dampened the suspense of the plot line. I sat on the edge of my chair hoping certain events would transpire and was satisfied with the ending.Much better than the director's efforts with Blade: Trinity. The pace is kept up and each time I thought I'd start to fade in attention a new piece of the puzzle is given or a character deepened.The cast was well selected for the role and well acted.But understand this, the movie though good, is not in the league as Donnie Darko. Then again this movie is a lot easier to follow than Darko.OVERALL:My wife who had no desire to watch it would still give it a 2.5 star after seeing it and being drawn into the story.

But given the premise of the story - that there is a time before death when the spirit can see what is occurring as death approaches, sort of deja vu in reverse - there is food for thought.  The rather pedestrian story becomes a stimulus for thought about the thin line between life and death.Smart, rich kid Nick Powell (a convincing Justin Chatwin) makes up for his too early death loss of his father and his rigid mother (Marcia Gay Hardin) by selling his intelligence to his friends through pirated essays.  In his school is a little gang of misfits lead by Annie (Margarita Levieva) and including Matty (Ryan Kennedy) and Dean (Andrew Francis) and Annie's sometime ex-con boyfriend Marcus (Alex O'Loughlin). Nick and his friend Pete  (Chris Marquette) are the brunt of the little gang and in an unfortunate crime perpetrated by Annie, Pete, thinking Nick has escaped Seattle for writing school in London, uses 'Nick-as-informer' as a means to stop the gang's punishment of himself.  Annie inadvertently 'murders' Nick and hides his body.  But Nick is not dead: he roams the world quite invisibly, and follows the development of the lives of his friend and of Annie, discovering secrets about which he was ignorant.  The sappy ending ties everything together far too neatly, but the getting there is made tolerable by some fine performances by Marcia Gay Harden, Callum Keith Rennie, and the two leads.  Director David S. Goyer makes us feel he can't quite decide the genre of this story, but it feels aimed for the teenage set - until the adult viewer plugs in to some rather good ideas buried in the script. Not a movie to wait in line for, but not a bad film for all that.

1088997,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000TAN904,Jason,"[2, 3]","Nick Powell (Justin Chatwin) is brilliant kid with everything going for him.  He's ""troubled"" and his mother just doesn't understand him, but he's still somewhat of a big man on campus, so when his best friend Pete (Chris Marquette) - a milquetoast pansy named so because it's close enough to male genetalia to be somewhat subtle and still convey his actions - gets into trouble, Nick dons his cape, exposes the capital S (his stands for suffering), and steps in with The Ride Of The Valkyries playing overhead.  One day Pete's actions cause Nick to run into Annie (Margarita Levieva), the other uniquely troubled youth from a broken home at this high school.  Days later, Nick meets up with Annie and a couple of guys who were up to no good, started making trouble in his neighborhood, they got in one lil' fight and his mom got scared, she said, ""You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.""All joking aside, a massive beating ensues from the encounter (snitches get stitches), and the erstwhile living Nick must figure out why he is still roaming the earth, why he can't communicate with anyone, and why he still insists on yelling at people who are not foreigners.Despite Nick's general apathy, less than perfect actions, and troubled mental state, there is a somewhat likeable character (read: mostly teens) underneath the veneer.  It's easy to empathize with Nick because general faults and family strife are found in all lives.  Universal association is paramount when creating a stereotypically ""misunderstood"" character.  None of the acting weighs heavily, and only Marcia Gay Harden, as Nick's mother, showed any semblance of range.In all there is a bit too much teen angst when it's patently obvious that neither of their situations is original (Tyler Durden: ""You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake."").  Ostensibly meant to draw in the same emo crowd that identifies with the disgustingly popular Twilight series, the film reeks of teen miasma and laughable art-house poetry that ubiquitously contains the words ""dark"" and ""empty.""  Predictably, however, the two detached characters come full circle, as Nick learns to appreciate life and family while Annie gets to mark off her single item bucket list of atonement, wanting to do ""one good thing,"" which, aside from a shower scene that was pointlessly inserted for no other reason than to sway male viewers, is a lazy script's way of absolving her of past sins despite her raven-black soul.  Redemption is Lady Justice sitting driver-side in a short bus parked in the driveway with an oversized red bow on top.Director David S. Goyer provides no real great lessons or answers in this film, and there are just enough incomprehensible additions to leave viewers irritated.  For instance, hiding a body would require, you know, placing it somewhere not completely visible.  A good solid meh, but the teens will probably love it.Jason",3,"Could have used a bit more Beetlejuice, a little less Twilight",1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,2907,"['Nick', 'Powell', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'brilliant', 'kid', 'everything', 'going', 'troubled', 'mother', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'still', 'somewhat', 'big', 'man', 'campus', 'so', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'Pete', 'Chris', 'Marquette', 'milquetoast', 'pansy', 'named', 'so', 'close', 'enough', 'male', 'genetalia', 'be', 'somewhat', 'subtle', 'still', 'convey', 'actions', 'trouble', 'Nick', 'cape', 'capital', 'S', 'stands', 'suffering', 'steps', 'Ride', 'Valkyries', 'playing', 'overhead', 'One', 'day', 'Pete', 'actions', 'cause', 'Nick', 'run', 'Annie', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'other', 'uniquely', 'troubled', 'youth', 'broken', 'home', 'high', 'school', 'Days', 'later', 'Nick', 'up', 'Annie', 'couple', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'up', 'good', 'started', 'making', 'trouble', 'neighborhood', 'got', 'one', 'lil', 'fight', 'mom', 'got', 'scared', 'said', ""'re"", 'moving', 'auntie', 'uncle', 'Bel-Air', 'joking', 'aside', 'massive', 'beating', 'ensues', 'encounter', 'snitches', 'get', 'stitches', 'erstwhile', 'living', 'Nick', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'still', 'roaming', 'earth', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'anyone', 'why', 'still', 'yelling', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'foreigners.Despite', 'Nick', 'general', 'apathy', 'less', 'perfect', 'actions', 'troubled', 'mental', 'state', 'somewhat', 'likeable', 'character', 'read', 'mostly', 'veneer', 'easy', 'empathize', 'Nick', 'general', 'faults', 'family', 'strife', 'are', 'found', 'lives', 'Universal', 'association', 'paramount', 'when', 'creating', 'stereotypically', 'misunderstood', 'character', 'None', 'acting', 'weighs', 'heavily', 'only', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Nick', 'mother', 'showed', 'semblance', 'range.In', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'teen', 'angst', 'when', 'patently', 'obvious', 'situations', 'original', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'are', 'not', 'beautiful', 'unique', 'snowflake.', 'Ostensibly', 'meant', 'draw', 'same', 'emo', 'crowd', 'disgustingly', 'popular', 'Twilight', 'series', 'film', 'reeks', 'teen', 'miasma', 'laughable', 'art-house', 'poetry', 'ubiquitously', 'words', 'dark', 'empty', 'Predictably', 'however', 'two', 'detached', 'characters', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'Nick', 'appreciate', 'life', 'family', 'Annie', 'mark', 'off', 'single', 'item', 'bucket', 'list', 'atonement', 'wanting', 'do', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'aside', 'shower', 'scene', 'was', 'pointlessly', 'inserted', 'other', 'reason', 'sway', 'male', 'viewers', 'lazy', 'script', 'way', 'absolving', 'past', 'sins', 'raven-black', 'soul', 'Redemption', 'Lady', 'Justice', 'sitting', 'driver-side', 'short', 'bus', 'parked', 'driveway', 'oversized', 'red', 'bow', 'top.Director', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'real', 'great', 'lessons', 'answers', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'incomprehensible', 'additions', 'leave', 'viewers', 'irritated', 'instance', 'hiding', 'body', 'would', 'require', 'know', 'placing', 'somewhere', 'not', 'completely', 'visible', 'good', 'solid', 'meh', 'teens', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'it.Jason']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[4, 6]","The movie is a remake of a 2002 Swedish film called Den Osynlige, which was in turn based on Mats Wahl's 2001 young adult novel of the same name.  I've never seen that movie nor read the book, but I did read a detailed synopsis of it.  Apparently, the theory that the American remake of a foreign film is always worse is not true...when the original is not so great as well.  I will give it props for the fact that it stayed true to the adaptation of the original's gimmick of having the lead character interact with objects for a second before they go back to their original location.Nick Powell (Chatwin) is a ""good kid"" ready to explode under the weight of his cold, distant mother (Marcia Gay Harden) and a pre-planned destiny.  Just before high school graduation, he plans to hop a plane to London, leaving behind his screw-up pal Pete (Chris Marquette), who's run afoul of Annie Newton (Margarita Levieva), kind of a small-time kiddie crime lord.  But there's more to Annie than meets the eye:  growing up in a nasty, uncaring home, she's got enough of a moral compass to watch out for her little brother (Alex Ferris) and hope he doesn't end up like her.  When her loser parolee boyfriend Marcus (Alex O'Loughlin) rats her out for a robbery, she suspects Pete, who in turn rats out Nick, thinking his pal is already out of the country.  But Nick missed his flight, and instead gets beaten so savagely by Annie & her goons they assume he's dead.  The next day, Nick's ghost is going through the motions of the school day, and learns that no one can see or hear him (the deleted old guy was right about that much).The Invisible has a lot going for it, very little of which has to do with its' plot.  The plane of existence on which Nick finds himself is a pretty unique movie place (from the original film). For the first 2/3 of the movie, Nick and Annie are both strong, interesting characters.  The situation in which Nick finds himself allows him to take out his pent-up rage on the people and things around him, only to find them completely unaffected:  a perfect metaphor for the simmering, internalized frustrations men of all ages feel.  Chatwin hits just the right notes to make his character believably disaffected without being unlikable.  Annie is a very interesting character as well, in large part because of how well Levieva walks the line between her thuggery and compassion for her brother. Chatwin came to fame as Tom Cruise's son in 2005'sWar of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition), and I think that he may have potential as a lead in the future.Maybe its director, David S. Goyer, should have written ""The Invisible.""  As a screenwriter, he wrote 1998's Dark City, 2005'sBatman Begins [HD DVD], and all three Blade. Curiously, he didn't write the screenplay for this movie.  The original movie's screenwriter, Mick Davis, wrote it along with someone named Christine Roum.  That probably explains why they were both similar faultered.  Goyer has a chance to redeem himself though, because he will direct and write the X-Men spin-off movie Magneto.  As for this movie, I bet he wishes that he were invisible in order to distance himself from it.",3,The Invisible is Nothing to See,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,3163,"['movie', 'remake', '2002', 'Swedish', 'film', 'called', 'Den', 'Osynlige', 'was', 'turn', 'based', 'Mats', 'Wahl', '2001', 'young', 'adult', 'novel', 'same', 'name', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'did', 'read', 'detailed', 'synopsis', 'Apparently', 'theory', 'American', 'remake', 'foreign', 'film', 'always', 'worse', 'not', 'true', 'when', 'original', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'well', 'will', 'give', 'fact', 'stayed', 'true', 'adaptation', 'original', 'gimmick', 'having', 'lead', 'character', 'interact', 'objects', 'second', 'go', 'back', 'original', 'location.Nick', 'Powell', 'Chatwin', 'good', 'kid', 'ready', 'explode', 'weight', 'cold', 'distant', 'mother', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'pre-planned', 'destiny', 'Just', 'before', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'hop', 'plane', 'London', 'leaving', 'screw-up', 'pal', 'Pete', 'Chris', 'Marquette', 'who', 'run', 'afoul', 'Annie', 'Newton', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'kind', 'small-time', 'kiddie', 'crime', 'lord', 'more', 'Annie', 'eye', 'growing', 'up', 'nasty', 'uncaring', 'home', 'got', 'enough', 'moral', 'compass', 'watch', 'out', 'little', 'brother', 'Alex', 'Ferris', 'hope', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'When', 'loser', 'parolee', 'boyfriend', 'Marcus', 'Alex', ""O'Loughlin"", 'out', 'robbery', 'Pete', 'who', 'turn', 'rats', 'out', 'Nick', 'thinking', 'pal', 'already', 'country', 'Nick', 'missed', 'flight', 'instead', 'beaten', 'so', 'savagely', 'Annie', 'goons', 'assume', 'dead', 'next', 'day', 'Nick', 'ghost', 'going', 'motions', 'school', 'day', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'deleted', 'old', 'guy', 'was', 'right', 'much', '.The', 'Invisible', 'lot', 'going', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'plot', 'plane', 'existence', 'Nick', 'pretty', 'unique', 'movie', 'place', 'original', 'film', 'first', '2/3', 'movie', 'Nick', 'Annie', 'are', 'strong', 'interesting', 'characters', 'situation', 'Nick', 'take', 'out', 'pent-up', 'rage', 'people', 'things', 'only', 'find', 'completely', 'unaffected', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'simmering', 'internalized', 'frustrations', 'men', 'ages', 'feel', 'Chatwin', 'just', 'right', 'notes', 'make', 'character', 'believably', 'disaffected', 'being', 'unlikable', 'Annie', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'large', 'part', 'how', 'well', 'Levieva', 'walks', 'line', 'thuggery', 'compassion', 'brother', 'Chatwin', 'came', 'fame', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'son', ""2005'sWar"", 'Worlds', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'potential', 'lead', 'future.Maybe', 'director', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'should', 'have', 'written', 'Invisible', 'screenwriter', 'wrote', '1998', 'Dark', 'City', ""2005'sBatman"", 'Begins', '[', 'HD', 'DVD', ']', 'three', 'Blade', 'Curiously', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'original', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'Mick', 'Davis', 'wrote', 'along', 'someone', 'named', 'Christine', 'Roum', 'probably', 'why', 'were', 'similar', 'faultered', 'Goyer', 'chance', 'redeem', 'will', 'direct', 'write', 'X-Men', 'spin-off', 'movie', 'Magneto', 'movie', 'bet', 'were', 'invisible', 'order', 'distance']",N/A

1089006,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000TAN904,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","Supernaturally themed movies are an often times tricky lot in Hollywood. The reasons being that these types of films rely on the audience's ability to suspend their disbelief and go along with the filmmaker(s) into the realm of the unknown. Sometimes these movies work out well, and provide audiences with a really entertaining piece of cinema and an enjoyable break from reality. But sometimes one of these films will be going along just fine, but a small plot hole or continuity error will derail the remainder of the film. If this occurs and the filmmaker doesn't rectify this problem later on in the film, an audience will more than likely become confused. This generally will result in the audience losing focus on the continuing storyline, and shifting over to how they can make sense of what has confused them, and at that point the film has collapsed. With all that being said, let's move on to the film at hand, ""The Invisible"" directed by David S. Goyer (director of ""Blade: Trinity"").""The Invisible"" is the story of a bright young man named Nick Powell (Justin Chatwin), who is a gifted writer, longing for something more. During the last week of high school Nick stands up for one of his friends who is having some trouble with a small group of thugs. After standing up to the group Nick finds himself in their crosshairs, and when one of the group is arrested for stealing, Nick becomes the prime suspect for being the one who tipped off the cops. To pay him back, this small gang attacks Nick in the woods, the attack goes too far and Nick is left for dead. However, the next day Nick simply wanders out of the woods seemingly uninjured, and heads to school to confront those who attacked him. There's just one problem, no one knows he's there. As Nick deals with this new dilemma, he slowly begins to understand that his body is still out in the woods somewhere, and what he once thought was his physical body he now knows is merely his soul trapped here in a state of limbo, while his body lies dying. But, if Nick's body isn't discovered before it's too late, his body will die and his soul will vanish to its final resting place.Before I saw a single preview for this movie, I saw the movie poster at my local theater, and two things got my attention and piqued my interest. First was the slogan ""From the producers of the Sixth Sense"", a movie that was so original and fresh (not to mention a perfect example of a supernaturally themed movie done right), and secondly, was the director's name, David S. Goyer. For those of you that don't know, David S. Goyer is the writer of all three `Blade' films and ""Batman Begins"", and also was the director for the final `Blade' film, ""Blade: Trinity"". So, with those two aspects of the marketing already holding my attention I was ready to see this movie, then I finally saw the preview, and the film's appeal to me grew even more. For whatever reason though, I never made it to theaters to see this film, some of my friends and family saw it and thought it was good, so when it finally arrived on DVD I was really looking forward to watching it. However, after viewing the film, I have to say I was fairly disappointed. You may be reading this, and thinking to yourself that I had too high of expectations for this movie, after all it was only the second film Goyer had directed, and if that is your belief, that is fine, but I disagree.Here's what went wrong, in my opinion, with ""The Invisible"". The movie was going along pretty well for a good majority of the movie, but about 20-30 minutes from the end, there occurs an unexplained change in one of the characters that became way too distracting to ignore. The character of Annie went from only being able to hear Nick when he would concentrate on her and yell, to where she could hear him at all times and even sense his presence around her. This tidbit of story information may seem spoilery to some, but Annie's ability to hear Nick was included in the previews and mentioned on the back of the DVD case so I have no problem divulging that information. To me, this aspect of the story was left underdeveloped and was too much of a jump for me to follow along with even with suspending my disbelief, I just felt that Goyer was asking way too much of the audience, and that this 'special' connection between the two characters should have been given more explanation. If that wasn't enough an event in the final moments of the film is even more confusing, but I don't want to get into any detail with it, so that I won't ruin it for anyone that hasn't seen the movie. These two plot points in the movie would have been fine had they been properly explained in the film, so that the audience (being me) wouldn't have to either figure it out for themselves or just go along with it (which I felt was asking too much suspension of my disbelief), had that happened the movie would have been much better, still not great, but better. Instead, the plot holes became way too distracting and brought the rest of the movie down with them.The actors in this film were not highly known, I had seen most of them in at least one or two projects prior to this, regardless of that; most of the actors did a decent job with their respective characters. None of the actors really just seemed to take charge with their characters to make them their own so to speak, most just used the written lines without adding anything extra to the parts, and sometimes that works just as well, which was the case here and in most films where a teen is the lead actor. I did feel that Justin Chatwin, who played Nick Powell, was decent in his role, a few times his performance seemed wooden and unsure, but that was probably due to this being his first true starring role (his previous work includes a small supporting role on the TV series ""Smallville"" and a few movie appearances), so I can give him some slack. With more experience, and perhaps a better story, I think that Justin could become a much better, more polished actor. The majority of the supporting roles were all decently cast, it seemed like Marcia Gay Harden was only cast as Nick's mom to lend some credibility and more weight to the film, due to her longer, fairly successful career. Personally, I felt she didn't seem to give too much effort for her role, almost as if she was just going through the motions and just collecting a paycheck, her performance felt the most one-dimensional of any of the actors.Finally, we come to director David S. Goyer, still a relative newcomer to the directing chair, and an extremely talented screenwriter. The direction for this movie was very good, fairly straightforward and nothing flashy, which suited this movie's story and overall feel. I'm sure that Goyer had a much easier time directing ""The Invisible"" over his previous effort ""Blade: Trinity"", since this movie was a standalone and the other was the third installment in a highly successful franchise. So, the pressure had to have been significantly less on this film, there was no doubt other pressures that came along, since this was a stand alone film not tied into any franchise, he had to make this film work for itself, a task he accomplished fairly well. My one complaint about having Goyer direct this movie, is that he didn't work on the script, he merely used someone else's script to shoot from (a decision possibly decided by the studio or Goyer's schedule, who knows?). The fact that Goyer is such a talented screenwriter; I would have thought he would have been able to spot the problems in the story that I mentioned above, and been able to correct them. Maybe he did and wasn't allowed, I don't know, but this possible oversight on his part definitely surprised me.Overall, ""The Invisible"" isn't a horrible movie; it's actually pretty good for a majority of the film, but a few plot holes causes the whole experience to fall apart in a hurry. Had more time been put into the story, and a little more work from some of the actors, then this could have been a very entertaining movie experience; instead we're left with just an average movie with so much unused potential.""The Invisible"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",3,"Life, Death, and Apparently Not Much In Between...",1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,8196,"['Supernaturally',

1089012,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000TAN904,Lee Armstrong,"[30, 36]","""The Invisible"" was not a perfect film.  I like its paranormal aspect in much the same way that I like the filmThe Covenant.  David Goyer who directed ""Zig Zag"" in 2002 and ""Blade: Trinity II"" sits at the helm of this project.  He keeps the pacing rolling.  If you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD, it's interesting to see how many of the plot details could have been handled in several ways and the choices he made as director.  Probably the greatest star of the film is its cinematographer Gabriel Beristain who has shot ""The Ring Two,"" ""S.W.A.T.,"" and ""Blade II.""  While there are some paranormal plot aspects that seem questionable, this remake of the Swedish thriller ""Den Osynlige"" holds up pretty well for me.Justin Chatwin who has had parts in the films ""Taking Lives"" and ""War of the Worlds"" does a good job as the good-looking Nick Powell who want to go to school in London to study writing while his mother wants him to become a lawyer.  Chatwin may not have the greatest depth as an actor, but he comes across warm and likeable in the film, despite the fact that he's making money by selling term papers.  Margarita Levieva who was in the TV show ""The Vanished"" plays Annie Newton, a hard-edged girl who brawls her way through a difficult home life and puts her in league with some rowdy friends.  Levieva did a nice job in this major role, showing depth between the violent temper and her softer feminine side.  Marcia Gay Harden who won Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Pollock"" in 2000 and was nominated in the same category for ""Mystic River"" in 2003 plays Diane Powell, Nick's widowed mother whose business sense predominates over being emotionally sensitive.  There was a great variety in her performance from the very tightly controlled confident woman to the grieving mother who breaks down in sobs at the lost of her son.  Nick's best buddy is Pete played by Chris Marquette.  Marquette plays a weak character that has a hard time standing up for himself and is often a victim.  One of the most interesting parts is played by Australian actor Alex O'Loughlin who is currently the good looking vampire on TV's ""Moonlight"" and is also in ""August Rush.""  As Annie's ex-con boyfriend and betrayer Marcus Bohem, he looks rough and acts solely for his own benefit.  Given this, O'Loughlin still manages to bring a nicely varied performance to the screen that is interesting to watch, even when we don't like the character.  I found the sweet touches like Nick being a pal to Annie's little brother to leave a smile, despite the bittersweet violence and outcome of the film.  Overall, I found the film to have some excellent nuances that enhanced from watching it originally in the theatre and then on DVD.

These points involve issues of understanding other people's lives, (who may be much less fortunate than you), compassion, forgiveness, justice, and redemption.

His mother has his entire life planned out, and doesn't care for his input.  He wants to take a writer's course in London, but she nixes the idea. The other main character is Annie, a deeply troubled, waif-like thug, always wearing a knit skullcap and jacket. In fact, The Invisible has enough teen angst to float a battleship.The story is simple enough, but what makes the movie go from average to excellent is the cinematography.  They really strove to create a quality production instead of just cranking out another forgettable teen ghost story.  The lighting is excellent, the sets carefully chosen to reflect the mood of the plot.  Even the outdoor settings were chosen for the theme of the film, that what seems like an end never really is.

But by the end of the movie, you're too busy trying to hide your face and figure out exactly where you started crying to care anymore.The Invisible is about a talented young man, Nick, who has a promising career in front of him when he gets out of school and a writer's course in London, if he could get away from his mother's ever smothering prescence to get on the plane. Annie dresses in black, and tucks up all her gorgeous hair underneath a black beanie and has a wicked (step)mother (?) and a little brother who she quite positively adores. Watch out for the scene where Annie reveals she HAS hair - a scene that is really enlightening and leaves her looking like a young Shakira.Annie also has a much older tattooed boyfriend, who has a history with the police, and when she gets over enthusiastic on a crime spree, he shops her to the police anonymously. Annie suspects everybody who holds a grudge against her (apart from the obvious) and ends up giving Nick a beating that SHE won't ever forget.From here, we tread on Ghost territory. But for anyone who previously loved Ghost (me), this wipes away every fragment of memory about that movie. For Nick's in limbo - stuck between one world and the next. And he needs help.If you're expecting a teenage horror flick, go see another movie. This is NOT your stereotypical teenage horror flick. This movie actually has a heart at the centre of it, and isn't afraid to show it.The Invisible, in my opinion, was amazing. In the UK it was released as the director's cut, with some additional scenes. The two actors - Justin Chatwin as Nick and Margarita Levieva as Annie - were simply amazing in two very demanding roles. Margarita reminded me so much of Shakira in the second half of the film, when she has her hair out from under that awful beanie hat, and in the first half, she reminds me of Jessica Alba.I cry at nearly everything - I've been known to cry at Neighbours, I can't watch My Girl anymore, and don't even get me started on Beaches or Mask, cos I can't stop crying enough to see what happens at the end. I reckon I started crying about 10-15 minutes before the end on this, but I don't really remember. All I remember was that my face was rather wet, and I was trying to hide my face until I could run to the toilet and dry my eyes. Highly embarrassing. And it was all I could do to stop myself from thinking about it afterwards and blubbing again!I raved about this at work after seeing it, and want my own copy to watch again.

Not only was it boring, but the trailer promised something and never delivered. I possible could have forgiven the movie had I not been ""suckered"" into watching expecting something more. For those who do not know what I'm talking about, the trailer made it seem as if this was going to be a mystery about the m.c trying to solve his own death. The truth is, there is no mystery, suspense, or even a real plot.I feel the problem with this movie(and there are so many), was character development, plot, and realism. The character were two dimensional, which made it impossible to feel anything for their predicament. Nick whined the entire movie, teen angst is one thing, but come on... no one loves me, how could you do this, my mom doesn't understand me... I felt like I was back in high school.One major issue was, how the writers could expect the watcher to sympathize with Annie(which is important for the conclusion). Yeah, she had a tough life, but it hardly justifies attempted murder. The whole ending hinders on the watcher changing their mind about Annie(which I didn't). While she sacrificed herself at the end, it is also hard to forget that she was the one who beat him half to death in the first place, and hid the body.The plot was completely ridiculous. Are we meant to believe that everyone in a state between life and death is walking around in a living hell? I would expect Nick to run into a lot more people. I also found it hard to believe that the friend(I forget his name), wouldn't go to the police. While they explained it in the movie(sort of), it was still unbelievable. All the friend would have to to do is say exactly what happened. He(the friend) was jumped, beaten into telling Annie a name. He chose Nick b/c he was supposed to be in England. She and her posse beat Nick to death, the end. The friend was there, but didn't participate. Just b/c he didn't do anything does not mean he is liable for murder. Most people wouldn't do anything outnumbered 3 to 1, with one girl know to carry a knife. The other unbelievable plot point was Nicks survival. Are we supposed to believe that someone can be beaten almost to death, survive being dumped into a hole, exposed to the elements, and survive days without food and water.This movie lacked realism all the way through. It is one thing to suspend disbelief for a movie, but you can only go so far. The most disappointing part is that this could have been good. The plot(being murdered and having to solve your own murder), could have been interesting and exciting.R.I.P. the Invisible.

1089025,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B000TAN904,M. Oleson,"[0, 1]","A couple months ago I was watching an episode of CSI: New York (best of the CSI's).  During one of their quiet scenes of dissecting a body, this haunting song came on.  A little research discovered it was called ""02.20 Boy"" by Suicide Sports Club.  It was featured in a movie called ""The Invisible"".  I had never heard of the song, the band or the movie.  I found a dirt cheap Blu ray version and finally got around to watching it.  Unlike the song and others featured on the soundtrack, the movie stinks.  It's a remake of a 2002 Swedish film of the same name (""Den Osynlige"").  I actually like the premise.  A high school student is brutally beaten and left for dead by a small gang of thugs headed by a girl.  While they all know each other, they are on different sides of the social strata.  In this near death state, young Nick (Justin Chatwin) enters a ghost-like dimension where he can see but cannot be seen.  Everyone knows what the next moves are as he tries to lead authorities to his unconscious body.  Now the girl, Annie (Margarita Levieva) isn't really so tough, but has a tough family life.  Seen that before?  It doesn't take much effort to also see that even with Annie constantly wearing a black ski cap, she's pretty hot underneath the baggy clothes.  Sure enough, when she whips off the cap to take a shower, a flow of dark, thick, past-the-shoulders-mane of hair falls out.  She looks like something out of Maxim (which I suspect she was).  She begins to sense Nick and the guilt.  See where this is all going? The acting is pretty bad, even Marcia Gay Harden.

1089027,A3RD5BAVYUUY0P,B000TAN904,Mykola,"[6, 7]","I bought this movie because it stars Alex O'Loughlin, and as always, he outshines the entire cast. This film is a very interesting story in general, but Alex as Marcus Bohem is the best part of the entire film. Alex has a way of showing so much more of his characters than what is in the script, so instead of seeing Marcus as just some criminal out on parole, I felt for him and his mixed feelings for Annie. Margarita Levieva is perfect as Annie, and the way she portrayed her character also made me feel sympathy for her. She is a young and very lost girl, and the relationship between her and Marcus was intense and fascinating to me. He did have feelings for her until he saw that she was, as he put it, ""out of control"". The rest of the story is well written and I am impressed at the way the cast and crew worked in the cold where they were filming.An interesting little bit of info about the filming is that in the scene where Annie threatens to push Marcus off the cliff, they both had thin wires around one ankle in case of a fall. That must have been intense when Margarita actually gave Alex that little shove!Alex has a way of changing himself so completely for each role - the way he looks and talks and acts - even down to shaving his head for the role and running ten miles a day, as he figured Marcus would have worked out in prison before he was recently paroled. This film was done in 2006, before Alex became well known for his roles on The Shield and Moonlight, and nobody would have guessed that he has a strong Austalian accent. I have all of Alex's work on DVD and I have seen him do so many accents - all impeccable.If you are reading this and wondering why I am talking mostly about Alex O'Loughlin, it is because he truly is the highlight of this movie.

Zwick,"[0, 1]","**1/2""The Invisible"" employs a premise whose cinematic pedigree extends all the way back to ""Carnival of Souls"" in 1962 and which reached its apogee of commercial success with ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999.  The idea goes something like this: a character is killed but returns to the land of the living, initially unaware that he or she is already dead.  Usually this involves not being able to communicate with the people around him, a situation that can lead to a great deal of frustration for the undead individual involved.To its credit, ""The Invisible"" has come up with a nifty little twist on the formula that adds a note of beat-the-clock urgency to the narrative (I won`t spell out what that addition is for those who haven`t already seen the movie).  Suffice it to say, Nick Powell (Justin Chatwin) is the high school boy who, after being beaten and left for dead by a gang of social misfits, mysteriously returns in non-corporeal form to observe the authorities' search for his body and for those responsible for his disappearance.While the idea behind ""The Invisible"" is worked out with a certain amount of complexity and flair, there's no getting around the fact that all that teenage angst stuff becomes a trifle wearisome and annoying after awhile.  In addition, the dialogue, acting, directing and soundtrack are pretty much straight off the studio factory assembly-line.

The Invisible is a compelling drama; by the end, I was very invested in both Annie and Nick's fates...I won't spoil it for anyone by saying how the story ends - let's just say that the ending is extremely bittersweet.IMO, a lot of the critical drubbing this movie has taken has to do with how it was marketed in the first place. The studio would have us believe that this is supposed to be a fast-paced, 'whodunnit' thriller full of twists and turns and unexpected surprises. The Amazon.com product description says that The Invisible is a Sixth Sense wannabe for teenagers. But this sort of description is, I feel, a disservice to the film. The Invisible is nothing like The Sixth Sense, and it's not supposed to be. Far from being a supernatural thriller, The Invisible is more of a slow-paced character study. There are supernatural elements of course, but the overall emphasis is on Nick and Annie's lives, the types of people they are, and how their paths intersect and influence each other. People expecting a fast-paced mystery will walk away disappointed.The tag line on the DVD case says that Annie must solve the question of Nick's murder before it's too late. But we KNOW what happens; we KNOW that Annie and her cronies beat up Nick and leave him for dead. There isn't really much of a mystery here. There is one twist, involving a bird, but other than that, the plot is fairly straightforward.On to the DVD itself...I was largely disappointed with the audio commentary. The commentary with the director and writer had a heavy technical focus and was, to me, deeply boring. Goyer spends a lot of time yammering on about lighting and camera shots/technique and water towers and lighting and stunt doubles and digital insertions and did I mention lighting? Of course, this is all subjective because I'm sure other people might enjoy a commentary that focuses on this sort of thing. All I'm saying is - if you listen to commentaries hoping for some interesting background trivia, notes on the actors or storylines, funny behind-the-scenes stories, look elsewhere because this isn't that sort of commentary. There are a few impressions/comments about the story from the writer, but Goyer largely dominates the commentary with his remarks about lighting and camera shots.There is also an alternate commentary from the guy who wrote the screenplay for the original Swedish film.

1089039,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000TAN904,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[7, 9]","One of the most effective and involving thrillers ever made - well beyond many of its better known peers - ""The Invisible"" is also among the most original movies to come down the pike in memory.  How many movies center around the strange developing relationship between two people - that starts After one has apparantly murdered the other?  And how many, were there more, could pull this off without being a depressing exercise in nihilsm?  ""The Invisible"" is so much beyond that, an exciting, truly suspenseful thrill ride that's touching, haunting, and constantly surprising.I generally try not to give away Too much about a movie in these write-ups, and though the promos for The Invisible merely indicated that its protagonist is only able to communicate with one person after his death, I don't think it's letting too much out of the bag to reveal that that person is actually his apparant killer, as this all comes out within the film's first twenty minutes or so.  That's only the first real surprise, and most of the later surprises revolve not so much around out-of-left-field twists (although there are a couple of those present too) as the plot naturally flowing into territory that's either unexpected, or the kind of thing where if you did see it coming early on, you'd think it would be a train wreck of mutually exclusive elements.  It's very much a hybrid movie, kind of like M. Night Shymalan's films or likeGhost (Special Collector's Edition), where elements from thrillers, drama, horror and action are all called in for a unique combination.  Without going too much into what happens in the latter parts, it becomes of paramount importance for the recently deceased Nick to reach someone and convince them of the reality of his prescence, and his initial attempts - with  various characters - are unsuccessful, leaving him to go unnoticed and witness what's going on with the people from his life and death, as a 'missing persons' search gets under way for him (still presumed to be alive at this point).  It's worth mentioning that several of the lead players are, in the beginning, either mildly or intensely unlikable, most of them only becoming sympathetic later on.  The movie just wouldn't have worked with a wide array of instantly relatable, positive characters, plus villains in the 'bad but still cool' vein.  If asked in the first few minutes of the show I would have said that certain characters should have been set up far differently, but everything turned out to be exactly the way it had to be.The acting was first rate, with award-worthy performances from Justin Chatwin, Margarita Levieva and Marcia Gay Harden.

But when he tries to take a flight to London to go to a writing school, his mother cancels the flight and crushes his dreams of escape. That night, Nick goes out to try to get away from it all when he is being followed home after a party by a lone car. Fleeing, he is chased down by Annie, who believes he ratted her out about her stealing jewelry from a store one night. Nick is left dead, or so is believed, in a sewer deep in the forest. The next morning his mother finds him gone, and immediately sends out a search party for him. All the while Nick is trapped in a limbo between life or death, and in order for him to come fully back to life, he must get Annie to tell the police where his body is hidden.By the producers who brought you the Sixth Sense, this is a spin-off of that, with a touch that is specially for teenagers.

The back of the movie touts the word ghost, too, but I think the words ""ethereal presence"" captures much more of the feel and I'll leave it like that.The plot hinges way too much on one or two things and giving out plot points would ruin the film for those who watch it. If you plan on watching it, be careful what you read about the film.In The Invisible, a chain of events sets something in motion that ALMOST went far enough to be amazing but came up short because it did a few things wrong. First, the movie seemed to go too long without much of a reason. There was a lot of repetitive interaction in the movie, trying to drive home a point it makes when the story really gets going, and that goes from tragic to outright annoying. The acting in it was good, too, and that made this all-the-more difficult to swallow. I enjoyed our male and female lead, the way she played out her anger, and the way he conveyed emotion. Sill, the event swallowed the whole movie and she needed too much from something that did not really fit her character. Second, there seems to be more promised by the movie than the movie actually delivers. When I first saw the touch of violence and the interpersonal world of our two main characters I really felt their plights, but the droning of the characters made me pray for their demise. Perhaps that is a sign that the movie needs to end or perhaps it is a sign that the ending is not up to par. Whatever the reason, the movie lost me. Lastly, the ending was good to a point but the path leading to it was not worth the time it took to get there. I liked parts of this movie enough to say that I liked I and, when reviewing it, I was conflicted. It was a good watch one time but it was so inherently flawed it could not be ignored.Sad, really, because it had me for most of the movie.I can not really say that you should not watch the movie, but I can say that the middle equates to some fast-forwarding because twenty minutes of it needed to be invisible. If you watch it you will see what I mean, and you'll wonder why they did not film something else to take u that portion of the film. The odd thing is that anything would have done; there were plenty of other characters in the cinematic sea and, honestly, all of them had something to say.The problem was not what was said, however, but more like it was said by a skipping record.Proceed with caution.",3,Glimpses of the Good and the Bad,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,2602,"['High', 'school', 'need', 'anger', 'management', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'group', 'teenage', 'guys', 'one', 'really', 'angry', 'teenage', 'girl', 'something', 'really', 'bad', 'combines', 'tell', 'story', 'pain', 'need', 'embrace', 'life', 'back', 'movie', 'word', 'ghost', 'too', 'think', 'words', 'ethereal', 'presence', 'captures', 'much', 'more', 'feel', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'that.The', 'plot', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'giving', 'out', 'plot', 'points', 'would', 'ruin', 'film', 'who', 'watch', 'plan', 'watching', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'read', 'film.In', 'Invisible', 'chain', 'events', 'sets', 'something', 'motion', 'ALMOST', 'went', 'far', 'enough', 'be', 'amazing', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'did', 'few', 'things', 'wrong', 'First', 'movie', 'seemed', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'much', 'reason', 'was', 'lot', 'repetitive', 'interaction', 'movie', 'trying', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'when', 'story', 'really', 'going', 'tragic', 'outright', 'annoying', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'made', 'all-the-more', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'enjoyed', 'male', 'female', 'lead', 'way', 'played', 'out', 'anger', 'way', 'conveyed', 'emotion', 'Sill', 'event', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'movie', 'needed', 'too', 'much', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'fit', 'character', 'Second', 'be', 'more', 'promised', 'movie', 'movie', 'actually', 'delivers', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'touch', 'violence', 'interpersonal', 'world', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'really', 'felt', 'plights', 'droning', 'characters', 'made', 'pray', 'demise', 'Perhaps', 'sign', 'movie', 'end', 'perhaps', 'sign', 'ending', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'reason', 'movie', 'lost', 'Lastly', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'point', 'path', 'leading', 'was', 'not', 'time', 'took', 'get', 'there', 'liked', 'parts', 'movie', 'enough', 'say', 'liked', 'when', 'reviewing', 'was', 'conflicted', 'was', 'good', 'watch', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'inherently', 'flawed', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'ignored.Sad', 'really', 'had', 'most', 'movie.I', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'say', 'should', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'middle', 'fast-forwarding', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'needed', 'be', 'invisible', 'watch', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'something', 'else', 'take', 'u', 'portion', 'film', 'odd', 'thing', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'were', 'plenty', 'other', 'characters', 'cinematic', 'sea', 'honestly', 'had', 'something', 'say.The', 'problem', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'however', 'more', 'was', 'said', 'skipping', 'record.Proceed', 'caution']",N/A
