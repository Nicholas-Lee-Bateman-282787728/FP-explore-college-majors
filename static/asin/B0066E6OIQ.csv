One that you can laugh at without being nervous about your children laughing along with you. Yes, this is relatively low tech. Yes, it requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. And no, it's plot is not strong -- the first half (if not more) depends on the interaction of the human characters with the animal characters, plus a few suspenseful scenes and a lot of great pictures of African wildlife.

1510926,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B0066E6OIQ,Jack E. Levic,"[2, 2]","This movie sure brought back fond memories for me of the beloved 60's TV series DAKTARI. I did not know there was a movie that was a prequel to the series so it was a lucky find. Widower Dr. Marsh Tracy is a vet in Africa. His lovely daughter Paula loves all the animals around her and they all live an idyllic life. Add in Rupert Rowbotham as the traveling teacher and Julie Harper who has a camp in the wilds to study gorillas and the mix is complete.Everything is sweet and gentle until the poachers enter the picture to capture young gorillas. Julie's life and animal friends are in jeaopardy. CLARENCE would have been just as entertaining without the threat and drama from the poachers. The movie could have kept it all peaceful and gentle but the violence is minimal and this is family entertainment. The animals are adorable and wildlife scenes were something rarely seen in the 1960's.Marshall Thompson stars as Dr. Marsh Tracy and I had forgotten what a kind and gentle presence he was on screen. He is loved and respected by the locals and treats all beings with kindness. He often has a half finished cigarette in his hand that he never smokes. In fact, the cigarette never seems lit so I imagine a director or producer telling him the cigarette would make him more appealing and authentic. No need. Dr. Marsh Tracy is someone anyone would trust and love. His daughter Paula (Cheryl Miller) seemed perfectly at home in the Africa despite the lack of other teenagers or romantic possibilities.But in the end, it is Clarence, that loveable cross-eyed lion, who steals the show here. He can't hunt because he sees double--though wouldn't seeing two of everything make him more eager to hunt? He is gentle and sweet and a loving pet. Just watching Clarence is enough joy to light up the movie. Poor Clarence gets into a few scraps unintentionally like getting stuck in a moving Land Rover with no driver. Yep, it's just Clarence the cross-eyed lion and Doris the chimp in that moving vehicle. I remember Clarence so fondly from my youth and would even now could spend hours watching his gentle antics on screen.CLARENCE: THE CROSS-EYED LION is dated and may not thrill a modern audience but it sure is fun and will bring back lots of happy memories for people who remember the DAKTARI series.",4,DEAR SWEET GENTLE CLARENCE THE CROSS EYED LION,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2299,"['movie', 'sure', 'brought', 'back', 'fond', 'memories', 'beloved', '60', 'TV', 'series', 'DAKTARI', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'prequel', 'series', 'was', 'lucky', 'find', 'Widower', 'Dr.', 'Marsh', 'Tracy', 'vet', 'Africa', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'Paula', 'animals', 'live', 'idyllic', 'life', 'Add', 'Rupert', 'Rowbotham', 'traveling', 'teacher', 'Julie', 'Harper', 'who', 'camp', 'wilds', 'study', 'gorillas', 'mix', 'complete.Everything', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'poachers', 'enter', 'picture', 'capture', 'young', 'gorillas', 'Julie', 'life', 'animal', 'friends', 'are', 'jeaopardy', 'CLARENCE', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'entertaining', 'threat', 'drama', 'poachers', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'peaceful', 'gentle', 'violence', 'minimal', 'family', 'entertainment', 'animals', 'are', 'adorable', 'wildlife', 'scenes', 'were', 'something', 'rarely', 'seen', ""1960's.Marshall"", 'Thompson', 'stars', 'Dr.', 'Marsh', 'Tracy', 'had', 'forgotten', 'what', 'kind', 'gentle', 'presence', 'was', 'screen', 'loved', 'respected', 'locals', 'treats', 'beings', 'kindness', 'often', 'half', 'finished', 'cigarette', 'hand', 'never', 'fact', 'cigarette', 'never', 'lit', 'so', 'imagine', 'director', 'producer', 'telling', 'cigarette', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'appealing', 'authentic', 'need', 'Dr.', 'Marsh', 'Tracy', 'someone', 'anyone', 'would', 'trust', 'love', 'daughter', 'Paula', 'Cheryl', 'Miller', 'seemed', 'perfectly', 'home', 'Africa', 'lack', 'other', 'teenagers', 'romantic', 'possibilities.But', 'end', 'Clarence', 'loveable', 'cross-eyed', 'lion', 'who', 'show', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hunt', 'double', 'though', 'would', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'two', 'everything', 'make', 'more', 'eager', 'hunt', 'gentle', 'sweet', 'loving', 'pet', 'Just', 'watching', 'Clarence', 'enough', 'joy', 'light', 'up', 'movie', 'Poor', 'Clarence', 'few', 'scraps', 'unintentionally', 'getting', 'stuck', 'moving', 'Land', 'Rover', 'driver', 'Yep', 'just', 'Clarence', 'cross-eyed', 'lion', 'Doris', 'chimp', 'moving', 'vehicle', 'remember', 'Clarence', 'so', 'fondly', 'youth', 'would', 'even', 'now', 'could', 'spend', 'hours', 'watching', 'gentle', 'antics', 'screen.CLARENCE', 'CROSS-EYED', 'LION', 'dated', 'may', 'not', 'thrill', 'modern', 'audience', 'sure', 'fun', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'lots', 'happy', 'memories', 'people', 'who', 'remember', 'DAKTARI', 'series']","Clarence, The Cross-Eyed Lion"

1510930,A1REU1B7BLB9NE,B0066E6OIQ,Primate,"[2, 2]","I was 7 years old when this was released, so I'm not sure if I ever saw it in a theater, but I saw it several times on TV. I've always been an animal lover, so a movie about animals that takes place in Africa seemed very exciting and adventurous to me.A grant foundation has an exotic-animal veterinarian and a behavioral scientist healing and rehabilitating sick and injured animals at the same time that they are studying silverback gorillas. The vet has an almost-grown daughter who keeps her own menagerie, to the great discomfort of her traveling tutor who is phobic about creatures that develop a fondness for him.While trying to keep their personal zoo out of trouble, managing the day-to-day business of a vet clinic, tracking and observing animals throughout their natural habitats, and at the same time protecting the silverbacks from a ruthless poacher and his band of mercenaries (the value of a 40-member gorilla tribe is worth nearly a quarter of a million in 1964 dollars) makes for some busy days at the bush homestead.And then there's Clarence who, because of his cross-eyed birth defect, can't hunt for himself and blunders into places where people don't want him, such as villages and chicken coops. So the vet tranqs him via a free offering of meat and brings him back for tests. Clarence turns out to be a real pussycat, quite literally, who is more affectionate than ferocious and would much rather curl up in bed with someone than lie out on the porch.It was produced by Ivan Tors who did such movies as Flipper and Hello Down There, and Tors had a very good eye for environment visuals and animal action. The movie was originally MGM but has since been licensed by Warner Brothers for DVD production and distribution. The transfer is pristine, the colors at least as vibrant as they were 50 years ago, and the running time seems complete and unabridged when matched against IMDB's review but is 6 minutes shorter than how Rotten Tomatoes or Turner Classic Movies see it. The story seems unaffected by editing however.Some dramatic moments mixed among the humorous circumstances, but nothing preventing this from being a movie that any family could enjoy.",5,Still holds up as a family film 50 years later,1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,2178,"['was', '7', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'was', 'released', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'saw', 'theater', 'saw', 'several', 'times', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'animal', 'lover', 'movie', 'animals', 'place', 'Africa', 'seemed', 'very', 'exciting', 'adventurous', 'me.A', 'grant', 'foundation', 'exotic-animal', 'veterinarian', 'behavioral', 'scientist', 'healing', 'rehabilitating', 'sick', 'injured', 'animals', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'studying', 'silverback', 'gorillas', 'vet', 'almost-grown', 'daughter', 'who', 'own', 'menagerie', 'great', 'discomfort', 'traveling', 'tutor', 'who', 'phobic', 'creatures', 'develop', 'fondness', 'him.While', 'trying', 'keep', 'personal', 'zoo', 'trouble', 'managing', 'day-to-day', 'business', 'vet', 'clinic', 'tracking', 'observing', 'animals', 'natural', 'habitats', 'same', 'time', 'protecting', 'silverbacks', 'ruthless', 'poacher', 'band', 'mercenaries', 'value', '40-member', 'gorilla', 'tribe', 'worth', 'nearly', 'quarter', 'million', '1964', 'dollars', 'busy', 'days', 'bush', 'homestead.And', 'then', 'Clarence', 'who', 'cross-eyed', 'birth', 'defect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hunt', 'blunders', 'places', 'where', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'such', 'villages', 'chicken', 'coops', 'vet', 'tranqs', 'free', 'offering', 'meat', 'back', 'tests', 'Clarence', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'pussycat', 'quite', 'literally', 'who', 'more', 'affectionate', 'ferocious', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'curl', 'up', 'bed', 'someone', 'out', 'porch.It', 'was', 'produced', 'Ivan', 'Tors', 'who', 'did', 'such', 'movies', 'Flipper', 'Hello', 'Down', 'Tors', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'eye', 'environment', 'visuals', 'animal', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'MGM', 'been', 'licensed', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'DVD', 'production', 'distribution', 'transfer', 'pristine', 'colors', 'least', 'as', 'vibrant', 'were', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'running', 'time', 'complete', 'unabridged', 'when', 'matched', 'IMDB', 'review', '6', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'how', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'see', 'story', 'unaffected', 'editing', 'however.Some', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'mixed', 'humorous', 'circumstances', 'nothing', 'preventing', 'being', 'movie', 'family', 'could', 'enjoy']","Clarence, The Cross-Eyed Lion"
