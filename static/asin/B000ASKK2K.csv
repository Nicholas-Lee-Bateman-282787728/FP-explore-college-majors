I have seen all types of talented musicians before, but never one as obviously well trained. The thing that surprised me most was her comfort in front of a piano. She made the most difficult of songs look as easy as breathing. The recital was like watching an acrobat do a tremendously difficult stunt, land perfectly, and then walk way like it was nothing. Lisitsa seemed incredibly comfortable with her extraordinary talent.The program performed is the hour long story entitled Schwanengesang or The Swan Song. The song is composed of 14 shorter songs that together tell the story of a man, his beloved, and the city he left behind.For the first one she played my favorite song of the set Die Stadt that represents the rolling wave and fog that carried a boat towards the city. The music was amazing in its power to almost visually represent the waves and fog. I felt a true emotional pull for this main character and his journey. The notes rolled together in rapid succession. Her hand flew across the keys and never seemed to slow or stop. The last song really showed just how comfortably she played the piano. She was very relaxed and almost made this tremendously hard piece look easy. I found myself becoming very wrapped up in the song, as it was a continual climax. The song rolled along, seeming to pick up more and more speed as it went. I had the image in my head of a snowball rolling down the hill growing bigger and rolling faster as it went. The song just kept building and building. Valentina Lisitsa is the most talented musician I have ever seen. I am definitely not exaggerating when I say that she was truly spectacular in every aspect of the word. What makes her different from many other pianists is she plays from the heart and is not simply a techincal wizard as are so many of todays generation of pianists. Not saying that technical perfection is bad but if you are a musician of any kind you will know what I mean when I say it is a constant struggle to find the perfect balance of playing the right notes all the time and artistic expression.",5,Wonderful performance of my favorite Liszt/Schubert transcription,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,2209,"['recital', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'musical', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'incomparable', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'seen', 'types', 'talented', 'musicians', 'never', 'one', 'obviously', 'well', 'trained', 'thing', 'surprised', 'most', 'was', 'comfort', 'front', 'piano', 'made', 'most', 'difficult', 'songs', 'look', 'as', 'easy', 'breathing', 'recital', 'was', 'watching', 'acrobat', 'do', 'tremendously', 'difficult', 'stunt', 'land', 'perfectly', 'then', 'walk', 'way', 'was', 'nothing', 'Lisitsa', 'seemed', 'incredibly', 'comfortable', 'extraordinary', 'talent.The', 'program', 'performed', 'hour', 'long', 'story', 'entitled', 'Schwanengesang', 'Swan', 'Song', 'song', 'composed', '14', 'shorter', 'songs', 'together', 'tell', 'story', 'man', 'beloved', 'city', 'left', 'behind.For', 'first', 'one', 'played', 'favorite', 'song', 'set', 'Die', 'Stadt', 'rolling', 'wave', 'fog', 'carried', 'boat', 'city', 'music', 'was', 'amazing', 'power', 'almost', 'visually', 'represent', 'waves', 'fog', 'felt', 'true', 'emotional', 'pull', 'main', 'character', 'journey', 'notes', 'rolled', 'together', 'rapid', 'succession', 'hand', 'flew', 'keys', 'never', 'seemed', 'slow', 'stop', 'last', 'song', 'really', 'showed', 'just', 'how', 'comfortably', 'played', 'piano', 'was', 'very', 'relaxed', 'almost', 'made', 'tremendously', 'hard', 'piece', 'look', 'easy', 'found', 'becoming', 'very', 'wrapped', 'up', 'song', 'was', 'continual', 'climax', 'song', 'rolled', 'along', 'seeming', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'more', 'speed', 'went', 'had', 'image', 'head', 'snowball', 'rolling', 'down', 'hill', 'growing', 'bigger', 'rolling', 'faster', 'went', 'song', 'just', 'kept', 'building', 'building', 'Valentina', 'Lisitsa', 'most', 'talented', 'musician', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'definitely', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'when', 'say', 'was', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'aspect', 'word', 'What', 'different', 'many', 'other', 'pianists', 'heart', 'not', 'simply', 'techincal', 'wizard', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'todays', 'generation', 'pianists', 'Not', 'saying', 'technical', 'perfection', 'bad', 'are', 'musician', 'kind', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'constant', 'struggle', 'find', 'perfect', 'balance', 'playing', 'right', 'notes', 'time', 'artistic', 'expression']","Valentina Lisitsa plays ""Schwanengesang"""

933080,AS63O9PELEN9Y,B000ASKK2K,TomCZorn,"[7, 7]","Valentina Lisitsa plays Liszt's transcriptions of Schubert's last songs.  But that sentence doesn't do justice to this performance.First, don't be put off by Liszt's name.  The audience-pleasing pyrotechnics Liszt normally employs are virtually absent from these transcriptions, although Liszt's extraordinary pianistic technique is still decidedly present.  Moreover, the text of the songs themselves may be shown on the screen (at the viewer's discretion), either in German or in English.The presentation is a new art form.  The setting is dramatic, exactly fitting the mood and emotional content of the songs.  The performance is perfectly staged, almost like a ballet or an opera with a single star in the foreground --- Valentina Lisitsa.She is a magnificent pianist, technically brilliant, with perfect control, and one of the three or four of the past 200 years who is capable of such an outstanding performance (in technique, in interpretation, and in communication of Schubert's powerful emotions that yet live on in these priceless songs).  It is one of the two DVDs I would save in case of a house fire.Finally, for the pianist, we have here a lesson in ergonomic economy:  Watch her arms.  She moves smoothly, with no jeky motions, from her shoulders to her fingertips, conserving energy, relaxing all muscles whenever possible to increase endurance, and concentrating the energy into her fingertips to control perfectly the piano's tone.The staging and direction by her husband are deliberately old-fashioned --- much as Liszt himself would have provided, and in keeping with Schubert's mood.  I found the performance so overpowering that I was unable to watch beyond the first six songs at one time and had to return to the rest the next day.",5,A New Art Form,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,1756,"['Valentina', 'Lisitsa', 'Liszt', 'transcriptions', 'Schubert', 'last', 'songs', 'sentence', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'performance.First', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'Liszt', 'name', 'audience-pleasing', 'pyrotechnics', 'Liszt', 'normally', 'are', 'virtually', 'absent', 'transcriptions', 'Liszt', 'extraordinary', 'pianistic', 'technique', 'still', 'decidedly', 'present', 'Moreover', 'text', 'songs', 'may', 'be', 'shown', 'screen', 'viewer', 'discretion', 'either', 'German', 'English.The', 'presentation', 'new', 'art', 'form', 'setting', 'dramatic', 'exactly', 'fitting', 'mood', 'emotional', 'content', 'songs', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'staged', 'almost', 'ballet', 'opera', 'single', 'star', 'foreground', 'Valentina', 'Lisitsa.She', 'magnificent', 'pianist', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'perfect', 'control', 'one', 'three', 'four', 'past', '200', 'years', 'who', 'capable', 'such', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'technique', 'interpretation', 'communication', 'Schubert', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'yet', 'live', 'priceless', 'songs', 'one', 'two', 'DVDs', 'would', 'save', 'case', 'house', 'fire.Finally', 'pianist', 'have', 'here', 'lesson', 'ergonomic', 'economy', 'Watch', 'arms', 'smoothly', 'jeky', 'motions', 'shoulders', 'fingertips', 'conserving', 'energy', 'relaxing', 'muscles', 'whenever', 'possible', 'increase', 'endurance', 'concentrating', 'energy', 'fingertips', 'control', 'perfectly', 'piano', 'tone.The', 'staging', 'direction', 'husband', 'are', 'deliberately', 'old-fashioned', 'much', 'Liszt', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'keeping', 'Schubert', 'mood', 'found', 'performance', 'so', 'overpowering', 'was', 'unable', 'watch', 'first', 'six', 'songs', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'return', 'rest', 'next', 'day']","Valentina Lisitsa plays ""Schwanengesang"""
