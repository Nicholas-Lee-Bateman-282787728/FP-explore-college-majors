In this film we see Rock Hudson undergo a transformation from irresponsible playboy to a dedicated, caring, passionate man with purpose.  The supporting cast played beautifully by Jane Wyman, Agnes Moorehead, and Otto Krueger enriches the whole film.  Douglas Sirk directed this masterpiece and of course, as usual, uses lavish color as he weaves a certain mood across the entire movie.  I can't understand why no one in Hollywood can find it in them to make movies like this anymore.  Especially in today's world, the message is even more relevant.

204195,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300183890,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 4/14Rate: 54/14: Not as good as I hoped for, Douglas Sirk's Magnificent Obsession pales in comparison to All That Heaven Allows. The most serious problem of Magnificent Obsession is its pacing. It moves at a snail's pace and then is quickened before coming back to it intermittently. The other serious problem is that the plot is never convincing at all. There isn't much of chemistry between Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman although both do very well and are the stars of the film. I just can't see the attraction of Jane for Rock. Nevertheless, their chemistry and attraction are more than made up for in All That Heaven Allows, a thoroughly satisfying picture and probably the best Douglas Sirk movie made. At least the cinematography is the eye candy during the viewing of Magnificent Obsession. Douglas Sirk can film color like no one can. All in all, Magnificent Obsession is not good enough, but it has moments.Viewed: 5/14Rate: 35/14: The 1935 version of Magnificent Obsession is a hopelessly dated picture. I am sure the film was a fine viewing during its period, but it fails to stand the test of time for a couple of simple reasons. Notice how the scenes with dialogues between characters are filmed in a long continuous shot. That's why there is no energy throughout to keep the viewers awake and stay interested. The director must have not seen Battleship Potemkin. Believe me, I was deadly bored, and finishing the film took me over four days. Secondly, there is no life behind the words spoken by the cast. They say their lines and segue to the next scene with a lot of detachment. When the players don't feel for themselves as characters or for others and are going through the motions, the viewer ultimately asks himself, ""Why should I care either?"" That's why the film fell apart. The artificiality of the emotions and the lifelessness of the characters inevitably spell doom; and that's why films like Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, and All Quiet on the Western Front, all products of 1930's, have stood the test of time because they are powerful and moving pictures. Unfortunately, Magnificent Obsession will always be sneered at for its fatuousness and soap operatic themes. At least everybody looked good and dressed well. All in all, Magnificent Obsession it is not.",3,"Ah, Well...Unconvincing Throughout.

204199,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6300183890,calvinnme,"[55, 57]","The Criterion collection is adding both the 1935 and 1954 versions of Magnificent Obsession to its list of classics getting the deluxe treatment.  Thus you are not only getting the Wyman/Hudson version of this film, but also the 1935 Irene Dunne/Robert Taylor version which has never been released either on DVD or VHS. Both were Universal properties, but the last time I saw the 1935 version it was so dark I wasn't sure it could be salvaged to the point we would ever see it on DVD. I was happily wrong.The center of the story is Robert Merrick ( Hudson in 1954, Robert Taylor in 1935). He is a well-to-do playboy that has a boating accident at the same time that Dr. Hudson has a coronary. There is one piece of life-saving equipment available in the area, and it winds up saving Merrick's life. Hudson's family and the entire community can't help but be a little bit resentful that such a seemingly useless young man, whose accident was due to his own recklessness, has been spared at the expense of the beloved Dr. Hudson. This causes Merrick to begin to reflect on life and as a result he is told by Edward Randolph about Hudson's ""magnificent obsession"" - doing good with little fanfare and getting paid back many times over. Unfortunately, Merrick doesn't quite understand. He thinks of this process as a vending machine. He puts in a quarter ( a good work), presses a button and then says ""gimme"". However, Merrick is the indirect cause of a second tragedy that finally does put his life on the right path over a period of years.In spite of the poor film quality, I think I preferred the 1935 version to the one from the 50's although I loved them both. The 30's version focuses more on Merrick's inner turmoil and transition while the 50's version is more of a melodrama and love story. The best thing about the 50's version - the chemistry between Wyman and Hudson. You would never think such a thing would work unless you saw it yourself, but it does. Also, there is Otto Kruger as Edward Randolph, the man who helps put Merrick on the right track. In the 30's Kruger could play some really hardened character, but here he is as gentle as Santa Claus. It's quite a tribute to his acting skills - I think he was always underrated.The extra features are:Audio commentary featuring film scholar Thomas DohertyDouglas Sirk: From UFA to Hollywood (1991): a rare 80-minute documentary by German filmmaker Eckhart Schmidt in which Sirk reflects upon his career.Video interviews with filmmakers Allison Anders and Kathryn Bigelow, paying tribute to Sirk.Theatrical trailer .PLUS: A booklet featuring a new essay by critic Geoffrey O'Brien.",5,Contains a double feature of the classic story,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,2643,"['Criterion', 'collection', 'adding', '1935', '1954', 'versions', 'Magnificent', 'Obsession', 'list', 'classics', 'getting', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'getting', 'Wyman/Hudson', 'version', 'film', 'also', '1935', 'Irene', 'Dunne/Robert', 'Taylor', 'version', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'either', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'were', 'Universal', 'properties', 'last', 'time', 'saw', '1935', 'version', 'was', 'so', 'dark', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'could', 'be', 'salvaged', 'point', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'DVD', 'was', 'happily', 'wrong.The', 'center', 'story', 'Robert', 'Merrick', 'Hudson', '1954', 'Robert', 'Taylor', '1935', 'well-to-do', 'playboy', 'boating', 'accident', 'same', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Hudson', 'coronary', 'one', 'piece', 'life-saving', 'equipment', 'available', 'area', 'up', 'saving', 'Merrick', 'life', 'Hudson', 'family', 'entire', 'community', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'resentful', 'seemingly', 'useless', 'young', 'man', 'accident', 'was', 'due', 'own', 'recklessness', 'been', 'spared', 'expense', 'beloved', 'Dr.', 'Hudson', 'Merrick', 'begin', 'reflect', 'life', 'result', 'told', 'Edward', 'Randolph', 'Hudson', 'magnificent', 'obsession', 'doing', 'good', 'little', 'fanfare', 'getting', 'paid', 'back', 'many', 'times', 'Unfortunately', 'Merrick', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'process', 'vending', 'machine', 'quarter', 'good', 'work', 'button', 'then', 'gim', 'However', 'Merrick', 'indirect', 'cause', 'second', 'tragedy', 'finally', 'put', 'life', 'right', 'path', 'period', 'years.In', 'spite', 'poor', 'film', 'quality', 'think', 'preferred', '1935', 'version', 'one', '50', 'loved', '30', 'version', 'more', 'Merrick', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'transition', '50', 'version', 'more', 'melodrama', 'love', 'story', 'best', 'thing', '50', 'version', 'chemistry', 'Wyman', 'Hudson', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'thing', 'would', 'work', 'saw', 'Also', 'Otto', 'Kruger', 'Edward', 'Randolph', 'man', 'who', 'put', 'Merrick', 'right', 'track', '30', 'Kruger', 'could', 'play', 'really', 'hardened', 'character', 'here', 'as', 'gentle', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'quite', 'tribute', 'acting', 'skills', 'think', 'was', 'always', 'underrated.The', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'film', 'scholar', 'Thomas', 'DohertyDouglas', 'Sirk', 'From', 'UFA', 'Hollywood', '1991', 'rare', '80-minute', 'documentary', 'German', 'filmmaker', 'Eckhart', 'Schmidt', 'Sirk', 'career.Video', 'interviews', 'filmmakers', 'Allison', 'Anders', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'paying', 'tribute', 'Sirk.Theatrical', 'trailer', '.PLUS', 'booklet', 'featuring', 'new', 'essay', 'critic', 'Geoffrey', ""O'Brien""]",N/A

I thought it was strange that someone known for relatively violent movies liked a melodrama so much, and I had heard about this movie before but had never really gotten myself to actually watch it. I watched this film with an open mind, and mind you that Jane Wyman was not an actress I knew at all, now I know I had seen her in The Yearling and Falcon Crest but that was about it. As for Rock Hudson I remember really liking his movies with Doris Day when they were shown on cable, when I was a kid.The story is about a playboy millionaire who has an accident and in order to save him, a machine belonging to a beloved doctor of the community is used but at this time the doctor has a heart attack and dies because the machine was taken to save the carefree playboy. Wyman is the widow of said doctor and Hudson of course is the playboy. Now Hudson feels guilty and try's to change his ways, but a very unfortunate accident caused indirectly by him, crush's his hopes.Now everything about this movie screams melodrama: the music, the twists and turns, EVERYTHING. Now if, like me before watching this movie, you are not sure what melodrama really means, I recommend you read up on it and then decide for yourself if it's your cup of tea. I thought it was great, my wife loved it and my 7 y/o daughter ( yes I show her classic ""old"" movies) really liked it.So this weekend if you have nothing planned, turn off the lights and your cell, make some pop corn, get comfy and enjoy.PS: Don't forget the Kleenex.",5,Melodrama at it's best,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,1601,"['sent', 'movie', 'hearing', 'Quintin', 'Tarantino', 'gushing', 'interview', 'TCM', 'thought', 'was', 'strange', 'someone', 'known', 'relatively', 'violent', 'movies', 'liked', 'melodrama', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'heard', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'gotten', 'actually', 'watch', 'watched', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'mind', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'was', 'not', 'actress', 'knew', 'now', 'know', 'had', 'seen', 'Yearling', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'was', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'remember', 'really', 'liking', 'movies', 'Doris', 'Day', 'when', 'were', 'shown', 'cable', 'when', 'was', 'kid.The', 'story', 'playboy', 'millionaire', 'who', 'accident', 'order', 'save', 'machine', 'belonging', 'beloved', 'doctor', 'community', 'used', 'time', 'doctor', 'heart', 'attack', 'dies', 'machine', 'was', 'taken', 'save', 'carefree', 'playboy', 'Wyman', 'widow', 'said', 'doctor', 'Hudson', 'course', 'playboy', 'Now', 'Hudson', 'feels', 'guilty', 'try', 'change', 'ways', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'caused', 'indirectly', 'crush', 'hopes.Now', 'everything', 'movie', 'melodrama', 'music', 'twists', 'turns', 'EVERYTHING', 'Now', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'really', 'recommend', 'read', 'up', 'then', 'decide', 'cup', 'tea', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'wife', 'loved', '7', 'y/o', 'daughter', 'yes', 'show', 'classic', 'old', 'movies', 'really', 'liked', 'it.So', 'weekend', 'have', 'nothing', 'planned', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'cell', 'make', 'pop', 'corn', 'get', 'comfy', 'enjoy.PS', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Kleenex']",N/A

It was Magnificent Obsession, however, that paved the way for those later masterpieces. Sirk's film was based on Lloyd C. Douglas' 1929 novel of the same name - a sudsy romance novel that became a best seller. The book was first adapted onto film in 1935 but the author wasn't too happy with the results. Sirk did not like the source material and hadn't seen the 1935 film and later described his own version as a ""combination of kitsch and craziness and trashiness.""The first disc features an audio commentary by film scholar Thomas Doherty. He starts off by talking about how Technicolor was used to lure people back to movie theaters after the rise of television. Naturally, he gives a biographical sketch of Douglas Sirk including his transition from European cinema to Hollywood. Doherty does an excellent job of analyzing the film's style and its themes on this very informative track.""Tributes to Sirk"" features filmmakers and Sirk fans Allison Anders and Kathryn Bigelow talking about their love of his films. Anders shows off her vintage Sirk movie posters and speaks about how her mother introduced her to his films. Bigelow cites Written on the Wind as an important influence on her films, especially her first one,The Loveless.

The earlier version contains flat direction from John M. Stahl that doesn't exploit the potential of it's tear jerker story.  Robert Taylor's spoiled playboy comes off as affected and boring.  There's zip chemistry between he and Irene Dunne which is odd considering they were close in age.  Possible reasons may be that Dunne's character is horribly underwritten.  I also knock it down a notch for the alleged comic relief offered by the insufferable Arthur Treacher in another cliched butler role.  The 1954 version directed by Douglas Sirk grabs the gusto.  Sirk pushes all the right buttons and gets all the juice out of what could be potentially mawkish material.

I remember seeing this on NBC's Saturday Nights at the Movies when I was a kid. Where to begin. The acting is wooden (although Hudson is always wooden, no pun intended) the sound stage scenes are so lavish and over the top and the music, OMG, the music. Between the defining sounds of violins and a chorus sounding like angles as the sky opens it is enough to make you want to cry (from laughter).Yet, it was the beginning of a string of very highly successful, Technicolor extravaganza's that the public wanted. Soap opera at ITS BEST! The story is so ludicrous (as all of Sirk's stories were) that I will not even address because so many have. It truly defies logic in any sense of the word....again, a HUGE trademark for movies back in the 50s.The cinematography is breathtaking, the use of Technicolor to paint a deep, deep pallet is mesmerizing and the sheer joy of being transported into another place and time in order to forget your own problems of the day is what makes movies, movies.  This one has all three in spades.Wyman is excellent, a consummate professional. Hudson is wooden and can't act, which is what gives him his charm...who needs those incidentals when you look like that.If you purchase only one Douglas Sirk movie this is the one to own.

204213,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300183890,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 2]","If you know Hollywood code at all, I guess it should come as no real surprise that the ""magnificent obsession"" of this film's title is NOT a reference to the Rock Hudson/Jane Wyman romance that's at its core--or at least, not a direct one. As articulated by one of the film's secondary characters--a vaguely mystical artist figure--it is an equally vague philosophy or spiritual principle that may strike some contemporary viewers as being surprisingly ""New Age,"" which in turn, just goes to show you that there's not all that much that's ""new"" about the ""New Age,"" after all.I've never read Lloyd C. Douglas's source novel, but it is worth noting that the author was a clergyman and the author of works such as THE ROBE and THE BIG FISHERMAN, which were also adapted for the cinema in the 1950s.  Those works were much more obviously religious than than this 1954 soaper, BUT the spiritual/religious message is not as far below the surface as all that.Religious historians and certainly most theologians could doubtless go on at length about the extent to which the notion of divine intervention and answered prayers lies behind all major religions.  I may be wrong on this point, but I've always assumed that the impulse to see something of a kind of ""scientific"" principle behind such beliefs is a relatively recent one, probably gaining currency mainly in the past 150 to 200 years.It may seem corny by today standards, but the scene in MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION in which Otto Krueger's character illustrates a spiritual principle by turning on an electric light (i.e. tapping into the source) no doubt resonated well into the mid-20th century (and beyond)when the ""miracles of science"" were still largely seen as just that, MIRACLES--and not at all taken for granted.Reviewers have described the movie's ""spiritual principle"" as being as old as the ""golden rule"" or as ""new"" as the ""pay it forward"" belief or ""the Secret.""  From what I've read about Lloyd C. Douglas's source novel, my guess is that that work was more overtly Christian, but that's not to say that seekers from any number of spiritual or religious traditions won't relate to the ""spiritual journey"" outlined in the film.  To wit: the clumsy initial attempts of Rock Hudson's character to actualize the spiritual principles he's been told about.  He foolishly believes he's been ""rewarded"" for his first act of true generosity by the sudden appearance of Jane Wyman, a woman whose pardon he seeks for earlier wrongs done to her (and with whom--the viewer knows all to well--he is already in love).  It's hard to think of a better cinematic portrayal of the foolish first steps of the spiritual neophyte.All this philanthropy and fellow feeling is fine, of course. But am I the only one who finds Jane's late husband in the film, the saintly (and never seen) Dr. Phillips, perhaps a bit too otherworldly.  I mean, it's one thing to share one's wealth with the less fortunate--and we could do with more of that spirit nowadays--but his death leaves his new wife and his daughter by a previous marriage in a precarious financial situation.  And just how spiritually evolved is that??But in a film as famously over the top as MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION, I guess we'll find ourselves suspending our disbelief and our preconceptions as often than not.Whatever author Douglas set out to do and however well he may have done it in his novel, it's clear that Hollywood had a somewhat different agenda.  And for our purposes, well, that MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION is indeed the romance, I mean just look at the illustration that adorns the cover of most currently available  versions of the 1952 film.  It's an image NOT represented in the film, but it could have been.  There are Rock and Jane--as another writer once noted--in an almost Pieta pose, but Jane looks serene instead of grieved and Rock looks more emotionally devastated than he actually ever did on film (in ANY film).That image speaks volumes, and whether it was used in the original promotion or not, it's pretty savvy marketing now.  And whatever religious or spiritual trappings the novel (or even the original script) may have able to lay claim to, it's the ""Great Romance"" between Rock and Jane that drew them into the theaters in '54, no doubt doubled Kleenex sales, and more importantly, established Douglas Sirk as the master of '50s melodrama.  And the film's success led to a reteaming of Hudson and Wyman--under Sirk's capable direction--a year later for ALL THAT HEAVEN allows.Hard core cinephiles would do well to invest in the Criterion Collection version of the film.  The two-disc package contains enough extras and special features to satisfy even the most magnificent obsessives.  It even includes the 1935 original version starring Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor and directed by John Stahl, an interesting if much lesser take on the same material.  Interesting to note, though, that the earlier film launched Robert Taylor on the path to stardom in much the way the later version did for Rock Hudson.  Another interesting side note (that may touch somewhat on the film's underlying spiritual message) the female leads of both versions were among the most devout Hollywood Catholic stars of their respective eras.  Coincidence?  (Well, probably, but a delicious one).",4,For The Magnificently Obsessed,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,5297,"['know', 'Hollywood', 'code', 'guess', 'should', 'come', 'real', 'surprise', 'magnificent',

Bob Merrick is an acceptable prickly self-centered egotistic selfish young rich man who wants to get everything standing at attention when he asks, demands or orders something. He does not accept no for an answer and he refuses any opposition, to the point of causing a catastrophe in the person he pretends to be wanting to love. Then the whole film is the story of that man who is going to try to make up for his self-minded clumsiness, and one could see that clumsiness as purely criminal. The film is actually interesting because we can see that man change in his attitude, in his language, in his doubts and uncertainties. Little by little he becomes human, maybe more humane and he will get what he wanted in the end, but not exactly the way he wanted it: more dramatic, more exacting, and that is the price he will have to pay for his foolish idiocy. I find that character absolutely obnoxious even when he is trying to repair the damage he has caused. I think he should not be forgiven because his narrow-mindedness is unforgivable.

It was still great when I caught a 35 mm print five years ago. In the movie theaters it has always been shown in the Academy ratio, as shot. IMDB is a commercial organization and its 1,85 hysteria to accomodate the DVD releases is a disgrace.THE MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION is well served by ROCK HUDSON who was not taken seriously because he was breathtakingly handsome. Look at JOHN WAYNE in the thirties, he was that handsome too but nobody held it against him. He was not taken seriously because his films were not prestigious.Everybody was even better in ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS.The JOHN STAHL version is great. Again the new canon: all melodramas ARE masterpieces, has done him no service. IRENE DUNNE is superb, as usual and ROBERT TAYLOR was a great actor. I mean it.Could we have 1,33 editions of the movies from the fifties, at least.All the movie buffs would be willing to pay extra money. I am deprived of the BOETTICHER and DAVES movies and couldn't face watching SUMMER PLACE, a great movie in that hideous 1,85 format. It lies with IMITATION OF LIFE and some others.The author LLOYD C. DOUGLAS was a queer one, a Lutheran minister. He wrote only eleven novels. The last ones THE ROBE and THE BIG FISHERMAN are straight Christian novels, or Christian romances.THE MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION is the first one (1922). For me, Douglas was rather some kind of spiritualist than a true orthodox, in spite ofthe Christian themes or conversions. I strongly recommend to lovers of American literature GREEN LIGHT, WHITE BANNERS and DISPUTED PASSAGE, they will be rewarded by some bizarre but interesting thinking, not just somequeer praise of medical science.

204225,A2M66S05KKNSWC,6300183890,"Rivkah Maccaby ""Rivkah Maccaby""","[0, 1]","Make sure you by the Criterion Collection double feature. This contains both the Jane Wyman/Rock Hudson 1954 version, as well as the Irene Dunne/Robert Taylor 1935 version. When it arrives, throw away the 1954 version, and keep the 1935 version. The 1935 version is beautifully restored, and you'll finally understand why someone thought it was worth remaking in 1954. It's sentimental, but beautiful, and very raw; it's also true to Lloyd Douglas' (the author of the original book, who was a minister) religious didactics, but not in an overbearing way. The 1954 film is a little hard-pressed to admit that well, yes, it's all about Jesus. Which isn't to say the 1935 film is preachy; it isn't. It's about one particular person's struggle.The latter bit is what makes Robert Taylor's performance so strong: we are able to see what is happening in his head all the time, without tricks, like voiceovers, or dream sequences. The film is entirely straightforward, linear, and stark, and that is part of its strength.It's also clear that Taylor's character isn't sexually attracted to Helen Hudson, at least not at first. He is fascinated by someone who continues to persevere through adversity, because that is not his own impulse, but he finds that personality characteristic very attractive. As he gets to know her, he comes to find her entire personality attractive.In the 1954 version, we are supposed to understand that Rock Hudson's character is attracted to Jane Wyman's character because he is just hot for her. While it's plausible, it doesn't flow from the initial story; it's just a coincidence, which had it not happened, there wouldn't be a movie. After that, it just becomes Peyton Place, with blindness.The unfortunate fact is that Jane Wyman as Helen Phillips really isn't all that attractive, not physically, nor is she terribly interesting. The 1935 version works because Irene Dunne is one of the greatest actresses of American cinema. It is easy to understand why Helen Hudson, as played by her fascinates Robert Merrick. It's also easy to see layers in her performance, and to know that at some point, she [DON'T READ THE NEXT BIT IF YOU FEAR SPOILERS] realizes who he is before he tells her.Irene Dunne is also prettier than Jane Wyman, although that's really beside the point; more importantly, she doesn't need dark glasses to look blind. She manages to play a very convincing blind person, and still keep her expressive face before the audience. Jane Wyman's dark glasses as a cue to the audience ""Hey! I'm blind now!"" sort of symbolize everything that's wrong with the movie. We're told what's going on (""I love you!"" ""I've changed!"") without really seeing it happen, except sort of in montage fashion. Someone says ""I love you!"" then there's a montage of kissing and walks holding hands, instead of actually seeing them fall in love, and seeing actors portray emotion.Yeah, toss out the 1954 DVD, then watch the 1935 version.
