I just watched it again this afternoon and enjoyed most of it, cheeze and all. Robert Foxworth (Prophecy) is a construction worker trying to figure out what has injured and killed members of his crew. Myrna Loy (!) and Lynda Day George (Pieces) are the mother / daughter owners of the hotel under siege by the angry little insects of the title. A pre-thighmaster Suzanne Somers is definitely a hottie, and proves that she can have ants in her pants just like anyone else! As ant-attack movies go, ANTS isn't totally awful. While it's not as good as THEM or PHASE IV, it is nowhere near as bad as EMPIRE OF THE ANTS (although Joan Collins is a riot)!

989643,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000FGFBUS,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","I haven't seen this film in decades, so finding it available on DVD was quite the coup.  It was exactly as I fondly remembered.  Given its age, it's quaint by today's standards.  Even though special effects were making vast improvements at the time (1977), they certainly weren't employed in this film.  Having seen ants swarm up the side of a building, their painted on effect was quite funny.  Only in extreme close-ups did they manage to achieve the right creepy-crawly consequence (I was scratching for hours after watching this film)!  I felt sorry for the poor actors who had to let the ants crawl on them.  They couldn't have paid me enough to do that.Naturally, these weren't supposed to be just any old ants, these buggers were fortified through years of insecticidal abuse.  Several bites proved fatal to a few characters who conveniently died off-screen or by slumping tastefully to the ground.  Not the stuff of horror, more annoyance than anything.This film is known by several titles: It Happened at Lakewood Manor, Panic at Lakewood Manor, or the pithy version ANTS.  I prefer the latter because it immediately gets to the point.  Besides the ants, another villain is present, Gerald Gordon as real estate magnate Anthony Fleming.  He wants to buy the Lakewood Hotel resort then tear it down and build a casino.  And not to be forgotten, there's the dope (Robert Foxworth), who unwittingly turns the ants into a rampaging horde of displaced residents in search of a new home.  What an idiot.This film is most notable though, for wasting the considerable talents of Myrna Loy (the owner of Lakewood Hotel), in one of her last film roles.  How ignominious.",5,"""I can't!

989651,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000FGFBUS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 9]","It Happened at Lakewood Manor (Robert Scheerer, 1977)Picture it. Pittsburgh, 1977. I was over at a friend's house doing something or another. As I was walking out the door to go home, his parents were watching TV. I saw just a scene. It traumatized me. We're talking nightmares for weeks. I had no idea what it was. Fast-forward twenty years later, to the glory of the Internet and its many film geeks. I describe the scene on a forum, and presto-- someone comes up with the name of this movie. I worship. Fast-forward another eleven years, to last night-- yes, it took me that long to get my hands on a copy-- when I watched it. I was once again traumatized, but for very, very different reasons.Ecohorror schlockmeister Guerdon Trueblood (Candy Snatchers) wrote the screenplay for this Robert Scheerer (The World's Greatest Athlete)-directed dog about mutant ants menacing a resort. Ethel Adams (Myrna Loy) has been running it for decades, with a helping hand from daughter Valerie (Lynda Day George) since infirmity forced her into a wheelchair. A shady developer (Bernie Casey) and his gorgeous assistant (Suzanne Somers, who gets top billing despite having relatively little screen time) want to buy the resort so said developer can put up a big, glitzy lakeside casino. Meanwhile, a nearby construction project (whose overseer, Mike [Robert Foxworth], is having an affair with Valerie) has disturbed, yes, a vast nest of mutant ants. And boy, are those ants mad. When the Department of Health gets involved, things get all kinds of fun.Oh, Guerdon Trueblood, how I love thee. How long did it take you to bang this script out, an hour? Less? It's quite nicely summed up by one of the characters, inserted into the movie just so the ants will have another target, who says breathlessly to her new boyfriend, ""and to think, this morning I didn't even know you."" (Later that morning, however, they knew one another very, very well. Ah, the swingin' seventies.) the characters are far too thin to be cardboard. Onionskin, perhaps. The plot is about as solid as an acid-eaten piece of PVC pipe. The music (the only score to which Ken Richmond's name was ever attached, at least according to IMDB) comes straight out of the adult film industry. Can say one good thing about it: the ant special effects are about a thousand times better than those of more recent killer-ant CGI-fests on the Sci-Fi Channel. (I assume that real ants were used for most of the shots; amusingly, whatever they used to get the ants where they wanted them was painted in swirls, and so you see meandering rivers of ants wandering down, say, a hotel corridor. I kept wondering why everyone was so scared of a six-inch-wide trail of ants working its way down a six-foot-wide hallway. Why not just step around them?)This is, truly, an awful movie in every respect, but I have to admit-- the kid-in-the-dumpster scene that gave me such nightmares when I was nine years old? Yeah.
