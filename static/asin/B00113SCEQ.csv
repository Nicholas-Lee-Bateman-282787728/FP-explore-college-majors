1129572,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00113SCEQ,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[7, 8]","Be forewarned: this series isn't for the crowds that don't like their animation to be a little strange, offbeat, or challenging. Lucy DoTD is one of the latest ventures from Loren Bouchard, who had earlier teamed up to create the incredibly popular series 'Home Movies' with Brendon Small.The series surrounds Lucy, a normal looking girl (other than a pair of small black horns on her head) who just wants to paint, create art, and flirt with her DJ boyfriend. Her father (the devil) wants her to grow and become the anti-christ, which she could really care less about. Her boyfriend is none other than the reincarnation of Jesus, a fact (of many) that he's oblivious of. Meanwhile there's a crew of elite specialists from the vatican who are supposed to kill her, although they never quite succeed due to personal problems & failings within the crew.The show's humor mostly surrounds parodies of horror films, books, & mythology surrounding the antichrist. While sometimes the humor can be hit or miss, overall the show is incredibly enjoyable to watch. In fact, it's actually more entertaining than other series that were still on AS such as Perfect Hair Forever & Xavier. There's a few rough patches to the series, but they are forgivable ones that will be smoothed out as the series progresses (if it is renewed).",4,Fantastic series for the quirky viewer,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,1317,"['Be', 'forewarned', 'series', ""n't"", 'crowds', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'animation', 'be', 'little', 'strange', 'offbeat', 'challenging', 'Lucy', 'DoTD', 'one', 'latest', 'ventures', 'Loren', 'Bouchard', 'who', 'had', 'earlier', 'teamed', 'up', 'create', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'series', ""'Home"", 'Movies', 'Brendon', 'Small.The', 'series', 'Lucy', 'normal', 'looking', 'girl', 'other', 'pair', 'small', 'black', 'horns', 'head', 'who', 'just', 'paint', 'create', 'art', 'flirt', 'DJ', 'boyfriend', 'father', 'devil', 'grow', 'become', 'anti-christ', 'could', 'really', 'care', 'less', 'about', 'boyfriend', 'none', 'other', 'reincarnation', 'Jesus', 'fact', 'many', 'oblivious', 'Meanwhile', 'crew', 'elite', 'specialists', 'vatican', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'kill', 'never', 'quite', 'succeed', 'due', 'personal', 'problems', 'failings', 'crew.The', 'show', 'humor', 'mostly', 'parodies', 'horror', 'films', 'books', 'mythology', 'surrounding', 'antichrist', 'sometimes', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'overall', 'show', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'fact', 'actually', 'more', 'entertaining', 'other', 'series', 'were', 'still', 'AS', 'such', 'Perfect', 'Hair', 'Forever', 'Xavier', 'few', 'rough', 'patches', 'series', 'are', 'forgivable', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'smoothed', 'out', 'series', 'renewed']",Lucy: The Daughter of the Devil

I can actually say I have never seen a show with this premise before.  I was instantly entertained and had to wait a long time after the pilot episode aired for the show to be picked up.  Thank Satan (HAH) that it was and we got to enjoy several outtings with these characters.  DJ Jesus is just to hilarious for words as the second coming of JESUS.  He is in love with Lucy..the ANTICHRIST!!  Then you have to talk about Satan and his secretary...she was worth the entire show...I love it when secretaries steal the show!!  I am so glad some people got over their own religion enough for this to get on the air.  I am craving a second season and this DVD.

""Lucy the Daughter of the Devil"" is a welcome addition to their stable.  The premise is exactly what it sounds like: Satan's rebellious daughter (voiced by a sassy Melissa Bardin Galsky) is more interested in being a typical young lady and romancing the possible second coming of Christ, DJ Jesus (pronounced in Spanish like hey-soos), then in bringing about the end of days.  The characters in this all CG show vaguely resemble cock-eyed Legos figurines and the budget is obviously quite low.  But asSouth Parkcontinues to prove, great comedy doesn't require fancy effects or even halfway decent animation, just solid writing.  This show has exactly that.The first episode is arguably the strongest and is pretty much 11 minutes of solid laughs with some blatant homages toThe ExorcistandThe Omenthrown in for good measure.  The characters and the music are the strongest points in the series and are played for chuckles rather well.  One episode features Lucy attempting to tell her father (who owns a sex toy company, Sinspirations, which parodies Willy Wonka's factory) about her ideas for the ultimate dildo.  One would think that The source of all evil would play it cool, but it turns out NO father wants to hear that from his little girl.  Classic.  The Devil's arc follows his attempts to help the political career of a satanic congressman.  His enagements with Senator Whitehead and with his own charming skullfaced secretary, Becky, the Devil's advocate, make up a large part of the show and are usually good for at least few snickers.  Opposing our evil protagonists are the bumbling Special Fathers, sent by the Catholic church to kill the antichrist.  Add one shrieking, gun-toting nun known in her school days as ""Hairy Mary"" to that mix and you've got yourself a show.The music that accompanies each wonderful title sequence is twisted and humorous, and usually the highlight of the episode.  A child vampire choir singing ""Boogey Oogey Oogey"" as they tear apart the congregation comes immediately to mind.  Then there is a fantasticly humorous rendition of Alice Cooper's ""Go To Hell"" that is accompanied by the visual of a figure being dismembered in perfect time with the music.  The Devil himself turns out to have quite a girlish singing voice and a talent for making musical romance.  And a giant monster that can only be defeated by human beatboxing?  Yeeeaaah Boyeeee!  Turns out the Pope is a crummy beatboxer.  Who knew?""Lucy the Daughter of the Devil"" is not perfect and at times drags just a little with excessive dialogue and jokes that aren't as clever as they'd like to be.  The title character is often pushed aside for flights of fancy with the Special Fathers, DJ Jesus, or yet more cutesy dialogue between Satan and Becky.  This is okay every once in a while, but in a mere 11 episode season it's a problem.  But, hey, this is a show that has a  sentient tumor in one episode so what's a little pacing problem?  Consider this a necessary show for fans of offbeat animation who enjoy having their darkness made light of.",4,Another  winner from our friends at Adult Swim,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,3295,"['Lucy', 'LucyLook', 'chubby', 'cheeks', 'Pinch', 'little', 'silly', 'butt.You', 'will', 'drown', 'world', 'blood', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'have', 'become', 'absolute', 'masters', 'dishing', 'out', 'servings', 'twisted', 'animated', 'humor', '15', 'minutes', 'less', 'Lucy', 'Daughter', 'Devil', 'welcome', 'addition', 'stable', 'premise', 'exactly', 'what', 'Satan', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'voiced', 'sassy', 'Melissa', 'Bardin', 'Galsky', 'more', 'interested', 'being', 'typical', 'young', 'lady', 'romancing', 'possible', 'second', 'coming', 'Christ', 'DJ', 'Jesus', 'pronounced', 'Spanish', 'hey-soos', 'then', 'bringing', 'end', 'days', 'characters', 'CG', 'show', 'vaguely', 'resemble', 'cock-eyed', 'Legos', 'figurines', 'budget', 'obviously', 'quite', 'low', 'asSouth', 'Parkcontinues', 'prove', 'great', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'require', 'fancy', 'effects', 'even', 'halfway', 'decent', 'animation', 'just', 'solid', 'writing', 'show', 'exactly', 'that.The', 'first', 'episode', 'arguably', 'strongest', 'pretty', 'much', '11', 'minutes', 'solid', 'laughs', 'blatant', 'homages', 'toThe', 'ExorcistandThe', 'Omenthrown', 'good', 'measure', 'characters', 'music', 'are', 'strongest', 'points', 'series', 'are', 'played', 'chuckles', 'rather', 'well', 'One', 'episode', 'Lucy', 'attempting', 'tell', 'father', 'who', 'sex', 'toy', 'company', 'Sinspirations', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'ideas', 'ultimate', 'dildo', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'source', 'evil', 'would', 'play', 'cool', 'out', 'NO', 'father', 'hear', 'little', 'girl', 'Classic', 'Devil', 'arc', 'attempts', 'help', 'political', 'career', 'satanic', 'congressman', 'enagements', 'Senator', 'Whitehead', 'own', 'charming', 'skullfaced', 'secretary', 'Becky', 'Devil', 'advocate', 'make', 'up', 'large', 'part', 'show', 'are', 'usually', 'good', 'least', 'few', 'snickers', 'Opposing', 'evil', 'protagonists', 'are', 'bumbling', 'Special', 'Fathers', 'sent', 'Catholic', 'church', 'kill', 'antichrist', 'Add', 'one', 'shrieking', 'gun-toting', 'nun', 'known', 'school', 'days', 'Hairy', 'Mary', 'mix', ""'ve"", 'got', 'show.The', 'music', 'wonderful', 'title', 'sequence', 'twisted', 'humorous', 'usually', 'highlight', 'episode', 'child', 'vampire', 'choir', 'singing', 'Boogey', 'Oogey', 'Oogey', 'tear', 'apart', 'congregation', 'immediately', 'mind', 'Then', 'fantasticly', 'humorous', 'rendition', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Go', 'Hell', 'accompanied', 'visual', 'figure', 'being', 'dismembered', 'perfect', 'time', 'music', 'Devil', 'out', 'have', 'quite', 'girlish', 'singing', 'voice', 'talent', 'making', 'musical', 'romance', 'giant', 'monster', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'defeated', 'human', 'beatboxing', 'Yeeeaaah', 'Boyeeee', 'out', 'Pope', 'crummy', 'beatboxer', 'Who', 'knew', 'Lucy', 'Daughter', 'Devil', 'not', 'perfect', 'times', 'drags', 'just', 'little', 'excessive', 'dialogue', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'clever', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'title', 'character', 'often', 'pushed', 'aside', 'flights', 'fancy', 'Special', 'Fathers', 'DJ', 'Jesus', 'yet', 'more', 'cutesy', 'dialogue', 'Satan', 'Becky', 'okay', 'once', 'while', 'mere', '11', 'episode', 'season', 'problem', 'hey', 'show', 'sentient', 'tumor', 'one', 'episode', 'what', 'little', 'pacing', 'problem', 'Consider', 'necessary', 'show', 'fans', 'offbeat', 'animation', 'who', 'enjoy', 'having', 'darkness', 'made', 'light']",Lucy: The Daughter of the Devil
