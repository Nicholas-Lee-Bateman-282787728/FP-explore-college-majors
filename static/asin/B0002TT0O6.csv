We all knew there was more to it than guys in dark shades walking near the president and looking like something out of a rather corny spy story. And there is, there surely is. As this was done in 2004, the two main people on whom the descriptions focused were Bush and Kerry. Because as most people know, ever since Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, presidential candidates also have Secret Service protection. After watching the detailed work involved in preparing for a single presidential appearance, I found myself sort of wishing that in Bush's case, they had not been quite so careful. Then I thought about Dick Cheney, and got all cold. Yeah, I'm glad they are so incredibly good at their job.They send a team to prepare a site a week in advance, and so of course there must be several advance teams working at any given time. They have to coordinate with state and local law enforcement at the location, and they have extremely sophisticated support staff. We get to see a lot, even though clearly some things must be kept secret. For example, every single threat on the president's life, no matter how trivial, must be investigated. A written threat is analyzed not only for fingerprints, the origins of the ink and the paper, but for traces of DNA in the fingerprints. Recorded threats (by phone or mailed in audio media) are analyzed for voice recognition and all sorts of nuances that may link it to some earlier threat or anything in the government's vast crime data base. One agent described it as like CSI without commercial breaks.Among the agents interviewed were ones that had been on the scene at various key moments in Secret Service history. Remember the agent that jumped onto the bumper of the President's car when Kennedy was shot? He's an old man now, of course, but he was interviewed, and gave some horribly graphic details about what he saw that day. He eventually had to leave the service because of the PTSD involved in that experience. The two Manson family attempts on President Ford, the day Reagan was shot, and a near miss involving President Clinton are also detailed by those who were there.It may not be a report of interest to all, but I found it fascinating. The only reason I give it only three stars is that the narration was a bit wooden, and the whole thing was almost 100% favorable to the Service. I can't help thinking there should have been a little more look at the dark side. These people are trained to a fair-thee-well, and the stress of the job is certainly major, but I thought the gratuitous comments about how they will not get rich once they leave the service, but just become ordinary citizens, was a bit disingenuous. Surely they go on to good careers in private security services, and very possibly services like Blackwater and the like. Or perhaps join city or state police service, or training. They are not simply relegated to the unemployment office.",3,"Only Some of Their Secrets, of Course",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,3018,"['Well', 'really', 'interesting', 'especially', 'ever', 'wondered', 'how', 'guys', 'manage', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'knew', 'was', 'more', 'guys', 'dark', 'shades', 'walking', 'president', 'looking', 'something', 'rather', 'corny', 'spy', 'story', 'surely', 'was', 'done', '2004', 'two', 'main', 'people', 'whom', 'descriptions', 'focused', 'were', 'Bush', 'Kerry', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'ever', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassinated', 'presidential', 'candidates', 'also', 'have', 'Secret', 'Service', 'protection', 'watching', 'detailed', 'work', 'involved', 'preparing', 'single', 'presidential', 'appearance', 'found', 'sort', 'wishing', 'Bush', 'case', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'quite', 'so', 'careful', 'Then', 'thought', 'about', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'got', 'cold', 'Yeah', ""'m"", 'glad', 'are', 'so', 'incredibly', 'good', 'job.They', 'send', 'team', 'prepare', 'site', 'week', 'advance', 'so', 'course', 'must', 'be', 'several', 'advance', 'teams', 'working', 'given', 'time', 'have', 'coordinate', 'state', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'location', 'have', 'extremely', 'sophisticated', 'support', 'staff', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'even', 'clearly', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'secret', 'example', 'single', 'threat', 'president', 'life', 'matter', 'how', 'trivial', 'must', 'be', 'investigated', 'written', 'threat', 'analyzed', 'not', 'only', 'fingerprints', 'origins', 'ink', 'paper', 'traces', 'DNA', 'fingerprints', 'Recorded', 'threats', 'phone', 'mailed', 'audio', 'media', 'are', 'analyzed', 'voice', 'recognition', 'sorts', 'nuances', 'may', 'link', 'earlier', 'threat', 'anything', 'government', 'vast', 'crime', 'data', 'base', 'One', 'agent', 'described', 'CSI', 'commercial', 'agents', 'interviewed', 'were', 'ones', 'had', 'been', 'scene', 'various', 'key', 'moments', 'Secret', 'Service', 'history', 'Remember', 'agent', 'jumped', 'bumper', 'President', 'car', 'when', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'shot', 'old', 'man', 'now', 'course', 'was', 'interviewed', 'gave', 'horribly', 'graphic', 'details', 'what', 'saw', 'day', 'eventually', 'had', 'leave', 'service', 'PTSD', 'involved', 'experience', 'two', 'Manson', 'family', 'attempts', 'President', 'Ford', 'day', 'Reagan', 'was', 'shot', 'near', 'miss', 'involving', 'President', 'Clinton', 'are', 'also', 'detailed', 'who', 'were', 'there.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'report', 'interest', 'found', 'fascinating', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'narration', 'was', 'bit', 'wooden', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'almost', '100', '%', 'favorable', 'Service', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'look', 'dark', 'side', 'people', 'are', 'trained', 'fair-thee-well', 'stress', 'job', 'certainly', 'major', 'thought', 'gratuitous', 'comments', 'how', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'rich', 'once', 'leave', 'service', 'just', 'become', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'was', 'bit', 'disingenuous', 'Surely', 'go', 'good', 'careers', 'private', 'security', 'services', 'very', 'possibly', 'services', 'Blackwater', 'like', 'perhaps', 'join', 'city', 'state', 'police', 'service', 'training', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'relegated', 'unemployment', 'office']",N/A

For one, like the 1995 History Channel and 1995 Discovery Channel documentaries (both available only on vhs), this was an officially-sanctioned production, so, needless to say, trade secrets and controversy are kept to a bare minimum, to put it mildly. Second, while Clint Hill appears on all 3 productions, I feel even more could have been said by him about not only the events of 11/22/63, but with regard to the JFK/ LBJ years, in general (he DOES state that the back of the head behind the right ear was gone, thus corroborating his own 1963 SS report and 1964 WC testimony; it's good to hear him actually say the words). In addition, as with the Discovery Channel production (and the 1996 PBS special re: Truman), former ASAIC/ #2 agent under JFK Floyd M. Boring makes a noteworthy appearance, but, as with his other two appearances, only to deal with the infamous 11/1/50 Blair House assassination attempt on President Truman; nothing about his role as planner of the Texas trip and so forth.In addition to the ""usual suspects"" (Hill, Boring, Jerry Parr), it would have been nice to seem some new faces like Joe Petro (with a book out right now) and Robert DeProspero (SAIC during part of the Reagan years, between Parr and Shaddick).Still, for 90-99% of the viewing audience, you will find much to like about this documentary, arguably the best of the 3, although I feel the 1995 History Channel documentary is the best for the early days of the Secret Service.
