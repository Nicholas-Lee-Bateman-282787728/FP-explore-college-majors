You know what, it may not be the Best movie in the world, but it was (atleast for me) Fun to watch. And so what if the plot did not make much sense it has good acting and is not that bad! If you don't mind super cheesy movies that don't make much sence, you should try it, but if you are a negative, closed-minded jerk that buy something else!--The end!!!",4,don't Listen to these negative Jerks and have an open mind!,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,421,"['am', 'sick', 'tired', 'people', 'complaining', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Best', 'movie', 'world', 'was', 'atleast', 'Fun', 'watch', 'so', 'what', 'plot', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'super', 'cheesy', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sence', 'should', 'try', 'are', 'negative', 'closed-minded', 'jerk', 'buy', 'something', 'else', 'end']",Mi Amigo

1019005,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000I2JSZ8,Jeffery Mingo,"[8, 10]","The front cover suggests that this will be a high-action western.  Instead, it moves slow and has much fake fighting and tedious antagonisms.  The back cover shows the sexy torso of a semi-nude man.  However, this film has a flash of female nudity and no male nudity.  Finally, though the covers show young people, this film is really about middle-aged, graying cowboys.  This movie is for the ""Space Cowboy"" crowd, rather than the ""Quick and Dead"" crowd.
