The challenge here is to seamlessly weave the new expository information into each of the fairly short scenes -- and the attempt has been quite successful.

I find that I'm just appreciating these two people having arguments and debates and sharing bits about their families. This film is also interesting because it's basically a dialogue movie but it manages to keep our interest.

Sanderman,"[13, 14]","By now you should now the plot of _Same Time, Next Year_, that of a long-standing yearly affair that continues over a twenty-six year period.  The charm of this film lies in its clever writing and extraordinary development, a growth that occurs along three lines.  Throughout the film, we witness the maturing of both Allan Alda's and Ellen Burstyn's characters as they go through life, the maturing of their unusual but intimate relationship, and the passage of time in the nation's history that surrounds them.  We get to see the ways in which their lives and relationship are affected by the tremendous change around them.  This complex interaction transfers wonderfully from the stage to the screen in the capable hands of its director, Robert Mulligan, a man who also brought us the classic _To Kill a Mockingbird_.While some have commented on the film's questionable morality, I believe that the film effectively explores the notion that one can find remarkable chemistry in more than one person.  Besides, their love cannot be reduced to a carnal physical love.  Despite the fact that sexuality certainly comes into play, this film does not make much of it, choosing instead to focus upon their chemistry and deepening relationship.  Moreover, it is the wonderful dialogue between Alda and Burstyn, not to mention their tremendous acting, that solidifies this picture as a movie gem.  My only minor complaint is the awkward splicing of picture stills between scenes.  While they do give you a sense of the cultural history surrounding the scenes, they get a little over the top, particularly when combined with the film's sentimental theme.

After viewing it just once, this has become one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time.Alda plays George, a happily married accountant with kids.  He meets Doris (Ellen Burstyn), a happily married homemaker, at a California inn in 1951.  Neither one is the straying kind.  They eat dinner at separate tables and, somehow, look up at the right moment and catch the other's eye.  It is, for them, an immediate attraction that they easily give into.  Afterward, both feel guilty about the adultery ... though neither truly regrets what happened.  It is in this first interlude that they start a tradition -- they share one good thing and one bad thing about their spouses.  It is a great ice-breaker.We see these two at different points in their lives as they continue the affair each year -- same time, same place.  We see them experience angst, joy, and grief together.  They come alive with each other, soothe each other, and balance each other.  George and Doris love their spouses, but have a deep and abiding love for each other.  As the years go by, they age ... but their love grows with them.  In 1977, George arrives at their meeting place with news, and an important question that Doris has waited decades for.

201168,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300182282,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 9]","Like Gene Hackman, Ellen Burstyn is one of those actors whose outward normalcy and everywoman demeanor make her deceptively versatile acting skills resonate even more. Still one of our most respected actresses, she had quite a run of quality leading roles in the 1970's, and this time-spanning 1978 comedy was one of the few purely romantic parts she played. That's because she became enough of a box office draw to be able to repeat her Broadway role here unlike 1987's84 Charing Cross Roadwhich Anne Bancroft essayed in her place. Burstyn is paired here with Alan Alda, then riding high from the long-runningM*A*S*Hseries, playing a couple, Doris and George, happily married to other spouses with six children between them. They meet by chance at a Mendocino B&B; during a weekend in 1951, and the movie tracks the affair that develops between them once a year in the same inn over the next quarter-century. Picking up on their illicit activities every five to six years, their trysts become statements of their times and also of their evolving marriages.The movie is a deliberately contrived set-up made up almost entirely of dialogue between the two principals and patched together by familiar, Life Magazine photo images of the intervening years. Bernard Slade adapted his own hit play for the screen, and some of the stagebound strain shows in the interplay. Director Robert Mulligan, who madeTo Kill a MockingbirdandLove with the Proper Strangerin the early 1960's, shows a sure hand with the actors, but there is little of cinematic interest here. Already well into her forties, Burstyn is still convincing in showing the evolution from a nave 24-year-old Oakland housewife to a fifty-year old retiree with aplomb. It's the direct sincerity of her characterization and the minor changes in voice and manner she employs to show Doris' growing maturity. Even though the camera belies her years early on, it's still a masterful turn. Saddled with the more contrived and exaggerated lines, Alda is less impressive as George relying more on his recognizable Hawkeye mannerisms except in the most dramatic episode set during the Vietnam War years. The postcard-perfect Mendocino setting and treacly Marvin Hamlisch music supplement the aura of romanticism necessary for this type of confection.

In fact Doris is wearing some ""New Look"" outfits that show it must be during the 1950s.  Some years later we see the faces of Ike and Adlai Stevenson, showing the 1950s and the rise of Elvis Presley, and Doris picks a quarrel with George.  (At least that is my interpretation.)  How did they get the two stars to look so young?  If you ask me, the makeup people should have won the Oscar, not the stars!  Just kidding because actually, the stars are excellent and Ellen Burstyn easily out does her part in ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANY MORE.  Watching the movie on DVD you can appreciate her more, in fact living through the movie is rather like leafing through one of those books about THE FILMS OF ELLEN BURSTYN, for many of her ""looks"" from her previous movies are referenced-from time to time you will see the young, innocent Burstyn of her TV days when she was still billed as ""Ellen McRae,"" and then you will experience the sensual, assured Ellen Burstyn of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.  Fast forward a bit to Burstyn as Chris in ""The Exorcist,"" and then to her wonderful part in the Jules Dassin film with Melina Mercouri, ""A Dream of Passion.""  In the very last part of the film, set in 1977, Burstyn is skillfully aged so that she seems almost to be an old woman, forecasting the way she would come to look in, say, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.Next to her you realize that Alan Alda's appearance doesn't change that much (though he has many comic moments in the hippie era) but he's providing admirable support to Burstyn and he never lets her down.  Wonder why neither of them truly made it as superstars.  What they lack in looks (and both are very good looking, just not ""perfect"" in the way of Hollywood) they both have in talent.  The script of STNY is serviceable, and the California locations in Mendocino are superb.  When I first saw the movie, I decided that if you have to cheat, Heritage House is the place to do it in.

Mountford,"[185, 189]","This is one of those rare gems -- a movie based on a stage play that is true to the original.The premise is simple:  a man and a woman happen to meet at a romantic Pacific coast inn in the 1950s, spend a night together, and discover that they're both married -- with children, no less!  How do they deal with it?  Well, after getting past the initial shock and guilt (she yells into a towel, he lies about his wife's name and the number of children he has), they agree to meet every year, same weekend, same place.  We, the audience, are allowed to observe every 5th meeting in the same room.We see the changes in the relationship, the changes in each of the participants, the changing times.  We get to know Doris and George through these slices of time, laugh with them, cry with them, always with the question -- will they ever leave their respective partners and follow their hearts?  It's definitely a relationship based more on mutual respect and friendship, despite its extra-marital foundation.  You get the feeling that these two individuals are truly soul-mates who just happened to meet.Alan Alda gives an amazing performance, beginning as a guilt-ridden rather milk-toast-ish accountant.  Without giving away the plot twists, he goes through many changes and personal crises, and still manages to stay a reasonably likable, vulnerable man.Ellen Burstyn, as Doris, enters into this as a rather ditzy young wife on her way to a Catholic retreat with the nuns, who manages to grow up over the years.  It's a treat to see the changes in these characters with each change of scene.Bernard Slade's original two-person play with its witty dialogue is preserved almost intact, with only one new character in the movie that isn't in the play (&quot;old Mr. Chalmers&quot;).

Alan Alda does a refreshing job playing an anxiety ridden guilty man and Ellen Burnstyn starts as a naive housewife who develops her own strengths and is sometimes the stronger of the two of them.  The focus is upon their affair from the 50s to the 70s and every interlude has black and white pictures of American History passing including our value changes.  You really get the feeling these two people love each other.  In fact, they might even be soulmates yet both of them are married to others and with children and they're arguably also in love with their spouses.  The Vietnam argument they have is the most heartbreaking.  Slow opening but I think that's because in the 70s musicals and slow beginnings were the way to go.

In the Fifties, when Doris and George first meet, marriage was first and foremost meant to give you a status in life and to breed children, and man's and woman's lives were quite clearly separated from one another; but during and after the sexual revolution more and more people understood how many vital elements can be touched between a man and a woman, and this is what the story is all about. The largely believed illusion that it is precisely the estrangement - the fact that man and woman can never understand one another which triggers sexual interest and desire - is being dismantled here again and again.Doris and George always talk about the things that are important to them, even very difficult subjects; and this does not abate the flames of passion between them, on the contrary, the mental intimacy makes them desire one another even more. They break much more than the taboo of infidelity - they constantly step over the boundaries of intimacy that seemed so insurmountable between the sexes at the time that the film begins. At one time, George must help Doris deliver her fourth child (when the play was written, it became gradually the fashion for men to assist their wives during childbirth, while before it was usually a purely female affair). Yet the experience is degrading for neither - Doris later even refers to it as ""our finest hour"". At another time, Doris helps George to finally accept his grief about his son's death, which he hadn't managed during the whole year before he met her again.As times develop and years pass, Doris and George live their everyday's lives with their respective spouses, but they do need one another for personal and mental development. Their marriages remain unburdened by the extra burden of their growing selves, but also devoid of the sparkle of adventure: while again and again, Doris and George literally discover one another, meeting again year after year not knowing who the other is respectively has become in the meantime.Additionally, the story depicts quite clearly how difficult and all-encompassing a couple relationship is: Doris and George like their arrangement because it helps them to split up their needs between two different partners, and everyone who ever was in a relationship knows how difficult it can be to bring and keep everything together - everyday's life, emotional and mental development, sexuality, good times and bad times.If anything is illogical about ""Same Time, Next Year"", it is precisely the interval at which the two protagonists meet, never having the slightest contact with one another in the meantime. I find it very difficult to believe that, even if you are married to someone else and have to conceal your affair, you would not desperately want to see or at least to hear from the other for a whole year if you are in love.

201216,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6300182282,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Based on the 1975 Bernard Slade play of the same name, this screen adaptation stars Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn as a pair of married lovers, who meet once each year for 26 years. Though a movie about marital infidelity may not be one's cup of tea, this movie works because it doesn't focus so much on the lust-driven aspect of the affair, but more about two people who find themselves in a circumstance where they really care for each other, yet are strongly committed to their marriages. Alan Alda plays George, a married accountant with three kids, while Ellen Burstyn plays Doris, a California housewife.The pair's relationship evolves over the course of 26 years, as each time they meet [in the movie, it kind of jumps every couple of years or so, beginning with 1951, then on to 1956...1961 etc], viewers get to see how George and Doris have 'grown' as individuals, and also how the years have shaped their relationship. They develop an intimacy that goes beyond physical closeness, sharing pieces of each other's lives, and confiding their innermost desires and worries. I truly came to care about both of these characters.This is a movie that I first watched a few years ago, never knowing of its existence until I saw it on Netflix. And since then, I've watched it numerous times - drawn in part to the great comic chemistry shared between Burstyn and Alda, and also the wonderful soundtrack and archival footage of historical events through the years 1951-1977.
