She has all kinds of problems going back and forth between her job and high school, and her best friend helps her pull it off. But a woman called India really has it in for her and is always trying to bust down Jane. Real mean. But Jane always manages to win in the end. Yay Jane!She has great clothes and lots of fun.

1517458,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006MOYGYE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","What happens when a teenager lands her dream job to work in the fashion industry by accident?This is the premise of the new ABC Family series ""Jane By Design"" created by April Blair (""Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous"", ""Lemonade Mouth"") and starring Andie MacDowell (""Groundhog Day"", ""Short Cuts"", ""Sex Lies and Video Tape"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") and featuring actress Erica Dasher(""The Lake"").The series revolves around teenager Jane Quimby (played by Erica Dasher), intelligent and dreams of working in the fashion industry after high school. But Jane and her best friend Billy Nutter (played by Nick Roux, ""Lemonade Mouth"", ""Wizards of Waverly Place"") are looked at as the odd balls in high school and quite often, Jane is ridiculed for her fashion sense by the most popular girl at school, Lulu Pope (played by Meagan Tandy, Miss Califoria 2007).Jane lives with her older brother Ben (played by David Clayton Rogers), who quit his dream to become a professional baseball player in order  to raise his younger sister.  But unfortunately due to the tough economy, Ben has had difficulty in finding a full-time job and now they are behind on bills.For Jane, she knows that her older brother is having a difficult time and she doesn't want them to lose the house.  So, knowing that she needs to raise money, she figures that since it's her final year in high school, she should prepare in looking for a job, but while she is still in high school, she can intern for a company in the fashion industry for now.Jane applies for an internship at Donovan Decker and during her interview, human resources unfortunately mixes her up with an application for an internship for a job as an assistant to work for Gray Chandler Murray (played by Andie MacDowell), a world famous designer at Donovan Decker.  So, Jane Quimby is mistaken as a qualified adult applicant as the assistant for world famous designer, receives a salary of $34,000 and working the dream job...illegally.An immediately, Jane's presence at Donovan Decker has been nothing but good luck to Gray and Donovan Decker..But as Jane tries to live a double life, she finds herself trying to maintain her high grade point average, starting to develop a close relationship with the star baseball pitcher in high school and also trying to take part in school activities, but at the same time having to balance this secret life working at Donovan Decker, in which Gray is quite demanding and expects a lot from Jane.  Which includes leaving school and home to take on activities and even traveling around the world.But how long can Jane Quimby keep up the charade before people start to find out?VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Jane by Design: Volume One"" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. I have to say that ""Jane by Design"" is possibly one of the most impressive looking ABC Family drama series out there.For one, there are a lot of outdoor scenes, also...you don't really get to see the stars leaving a set to go to Paris and video being shot in those locations.  Because so many fashion icons have cameo appearances in ""Jane by Design"" (as they interact with Gray supposedly in other countries), it made me wonder if the series tries to film a lot of these industry professionals during various fashion week locations.But ""Jane By Design"" is the best looking and stylish ABC Family series I have seen thus far.  From location shots (the set for Donovan Decker is cool), the runway set, the costume and set design, everything really comes together for this series and it's a quality you expect from a major network.  But pleasantly surprised to see how much ABC Family has put into this series and it works!Nevertheless, the set design is pretty awesome and overall, picture quality is great as one can expect on DVD.  Audio is understandable, clear and heard no hiss or any audio problems whatsoever.  If anything, this is a solid DVD set that I wish it was released on Blu-ray, because it looks good.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Jane by Design: Volume One"" comes with no special features.EXTRAS:""Jane by Design: Volume One"" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:A delightful drama series that captivated me from its stylish presentation, it's clever and enjoyable storyline, its cool characters but also in ABC Family style, manages to maintain that family aspect with the world of fashion.At first, I was skeptical about ""Jane by Design"".  For one, it's a big stretch when the storyline revolves around a high school teenager mistakenly hired to become an assistant for a world-famous designer.  But the more I watched the episodes of this series, I found quite a bit of positives of why this drama is working and why I couldn't stop watching it.For one, the series manages to capture locations, set design, costume design very well.  The addition of Andie MacDowell is a plus, as the model/actress brings some depth and maturity to the series, but also to make things feel a bit more believable is the number of cameo appearances by those who work in the fashion industry.  You see this often in film, but for a network TV series, not often.  And for an ABC Family series, I was surprised about how much was put into the actual style, design and overall look to this series.I enjoyed the chemistry between the characters, best friends Jane and Billy, these two almost act like a couple, but they're not. Erica Dasher and Nick Roux definitely bring a synergy to this series.  Also, it was great to see actress/singer India de Beaufort (of ""Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire"") in this series and she does a great job of playing the co-worker rival at the workplace and also enjoyed the quirkiness of Jane's big brother Ben (played by David Clayton Rogers).  And as the series develops, we are starting to see more and more characters being developed.Also, a major plus is the fact that characters are able to explore other worlds, where many other ABC Family series tend to focus within a circle.  I love the fact that this series often introduces a new character, may it be a socialist, a party rockin' teenage fashion model, etc.  Also, I love the fact the series also features characters of various ethnicities, also that these characters actually have an impact on the series and are not just there for politically correctness.  I enjoyed the Ben and Rita storyline and also the Lulu and Nick storyline as well.  But it'll be interesting to see how these characters come into play for the second half of the first season (and future seasons).Another thing I love about the series is its featuring of a variety of locations.  Typically when you watch an ABC Family series, there is a banality of where shots usually take place.  Often inside a home, a gymnasium, at a school and while ""Jane By Design"" does retain that, we get to see these characters outdoors or at variety of locations.  I was surprised to see Jane in Paris, I was surprised to see how much attention to detail when it came to creating the set for runways and even the office of Donovan Decker, I was surprised to see a diner location, a restaurant location, hotel location, etc.And so far, I have enjoyed each of the ten episodes of ""Jane by Design"".  They are well-written, the characters are fun and I absolutely love the drama that is featured and that it gives various characters their own storyline which is allowed to develop overtime., instead of being support characters that have no impact on the show or its overall storyline.  It's been a criticism of mine when it comes to ABC Family series, in the fact that you have so many characters, why not utilize them?  Fortunately, ""Jane by Design"" and ""The Lying Game"" are two series that are able to utilize their ensemble cast effectively and I like that a lot!But where an ABC Family series such as ""The Lying Game"" is able to extend various mysteries of its many characters overtime, for ""Jane by Design"", how long can this charade last for Jane Quimby?  It's one thing to see her balance this secret life and being a high school teenager but it can only last so long.  While I can see this double life existing for the protagonist for another season, it's not something that can be stretched out for many years.  So, it will be interesting to see how writers contend with this in the future.I also want to emphasize that this no TV version of ""The Devil Wears Prada"".  Sure, there is a protagonist who runs around running many errands and has a straightforward boss and yes, it has its share of ""backstabbing"" but it does maintain the ABC Family standard of teen life, teen relationships, family relationships and so on.As for the DVD, PQ and AQ are good as one can expect on DVD.  It's one of series that I wish it was on Blu-ray but for what its worth, the DVD looks and sounds very good and fans of the series, or those curious should be happy with the overall quality.There are no special features, which is surprising as many ABC Family drama series do come with a featurette or some sort of special feature include on DVD.  But  considering this is volume one of ""Jane by Design"" and another second half of episodes still left to air on television, I'm really enjoying this series so far.Overall, I have to say that I'm impressed with ""Jane by Design"". The characters, the storyline, the set and costume design, even the various locations that this series is shot, it's working and I hope they can continue this synergy.Delightful, captivating and fun, ""Jane by Design: Volume One"" is definitely recommended!",4,"Delightful, captivating and fun, ""Jane by Design: Volume One"" is definitely recommended!",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,9579,"['What',

I felt like the entire first season was a big circle, to start and end in similar places. (Not quite, so no spoilers.) Above everything else, completely unrealistic. Of course the idea (and plot) are, but how everything functions in every episode left me going ""That would never happen?"". That's probably why this is a TV show but I always think characters need to be relatable. Jane was to, cookie cutter in that stereotypical character that's a huge 'trendsetter that no one realize she's brilliant' kind of way. Cute show, but didn't live up to my expectations. I wanted to love this show I really did. I also personally can't get over the fact that when it comes to 'fashion' that means sporting some seriously weird looking clothes, hair, and accessories.

The thing is, I enjoyed the fairy tale premise, the writing and the ethic:  the characters all work hard whether at being a ditz, the most popular chick in high school or, ultimately, Jane with high school homework and adult responsibilities and Billie, working hard to be her friend, her best friend.  I don't get the network lazy ethic for killing shows with imagination and originality like this one.  It happens again and again:  a few episodes don't quite get their footing in the ratings and chop goes the block before anything more can develop.  Jane by Design deserved more episodes and another season, at least.  As unlikely a juxtaposition as the two lives she is trying to lead, the lead actress creates a sense of compassion about both.  You know she is always in over her head everywhere and you feel her ""fish out of water"" dilemma.  It hurts to be a teenager sometimes and Jane is no exception no matter how fabulous a life she has constructed for herself. New York City and a fashion house as character works well and puts Jane's life over the top:  the sheer energy and fashion elan contrasts well with the normalcy of a life in suburbia, albeit with an older brother as parent figure.  So, here's the thing:  this is a fantasy, yes, but with a moral underpinning that could only be considered valuable to the demographic ABC was trying to appeal to (I am assuming) - the teen, young adult, tween kids who could not receive a better message of hard work, creativity and vulnerability.
