602356,AOV2RGDDURFA4,B00005JLL1,David Kaminsky,"[3, 3]","It is an oft-quoted saw that all humour comes out of pain. Watching this concert performance, you can sense the emotional anguish Margaret Cho experienced while growing up as an overweight Asian ""girl"" in the land of dreams. Her triumph is that she has turned that pain into raw material for her comedy routine (as have so many great comics), but she is accomplishing much more than just personal catharsis. She is a woman on a mission to incite social change, as evidenced by her closing monologue. The closing litany of people for whom her message has particular relevance stands as her manifesto for the marginalized. As she makes it abundantly clear, a person of intellect IS in a minority in the USA today. Some would say she's preaching to the choir, that midwest trailer trash likely wouldn't be among her audience, but having her concert performances available on VHS and DVD certainly broadcasts her message to a wider audience. The language on the DVD is salty, to say the least. Margaret Cho has said that even Phyllis Diller sprinkles profanities liberally throughout her shows (on meeting Ms. Diller, Cho told her audience in Provincetown in 2002: ""I was afraid I'd snag a thread and her whole head would come off""). The language is certainly secondary to the message converyed by that language, that is is more than ""okay"" to not conform to the norm, and it is necessary to resist the whittling-off of the margins in society. It makes her Valley-girl characterizations that much more hilarious, as in the ""I totally ate Carla"" routine. Her material is full of little nods and winks to the gay community, who have long comprised her core audience. Margaret Cho doesn't set out to offend anyone except the prim and proper, the self-righteous, the moral paragons of society--the rest of us can just sit back and enjoy.",4,The manifesto of the Cho revolution,1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,1829,"['oft-quoted', 'saw', 'humour', 'pain', 'Watching', 'concert', 'performance', 'can', 'sense', 'emotional', 'anguish', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'experienced', 'growing', 'up', 'overweight', 'Asian', 'girl', 'land', 'dreams', 'triumph', 'turned', 'pain', 'raw', 'material', 'comedy', 'routine', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'comics', 'accomplishing', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'personal', 'catharsis', 'woman', 'mission', 'incite', 'social', 'change', 'evidenced', 'closing', 'monologue', 'closing', 'litany', 'people', 'whom', 'message', 'particular', 'relevance', 'manifesto', 'marginalized', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'person', 'intellect', 'IS', 'minority', 'USA', 'today', 'would', 'say', 'preaching', 'choir', 'midwest', 'trailer', 'trash', 'likely', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'audience', 'having', 'concert', 'performances', 'available', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'message', 'wider', 'audience', 'language', 'DVD', 'salty', 'say', 'least', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'said', 'even', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'profanities', 'liberally', 'shows', 'meeting', 'Ms.', 'Diller', 'Cho', 'told', 'audience', 'Provincetown', '2002', 'was', 'afraid', ""'d"", 'snag', 'thread', 'whole', 'head', 'would', 'come', 'off', 'language', 'certainly', 'secondary', 'message', 'converyed', 'language', 'more', 'okay', 'not', 'conform', 'norm', 'necessary', 'resist', 'whittling-off', 'margins', 'society', 'Valley-girl', 'characterizations', 'much', 'more', 'hilarious', 'totally', 'ate', 'Carla', 'routine', 'material', 'full', 'little', 'nods', 'winks', 'gay', 'community', 'who', 'have', 'long', 'comprised', 'core', 'audience', 'Margaret', 'Cho', ""n't"", 'set', 'out', 'offend', 'anyone', 'prim', 'proper', 'self-righteous', 'moral', 'paragons', 'society', 'rest', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy']",N/A

The result is not just raunchy fun (although it is that), but also political, honest, and empowering. Margaret Cho is such an important performer because she speaks for so many minorities who rarely really have their voices heard: female, asian, gay, etc. And she has the guts to put herself out there in such an uncensored and often unflattering way, that it's no wonder her fans feel such a connection with her.",5,Brilliantly subversive and hysterically funny,1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,903,"[""'m"", 'One', 'Want', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'combined', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'empowering', 'reminiscence', 'failed', 'sitcom', 'subsequent', 'breakdown', 'journey', 'back', 'mental', 'health', 'Notorious', 'C.H.O', 'mostly', 'ventures', 'completely', 'adult', 'territory', 'graphically', 'hilariously', 'discussing', 'variety', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'topics', 'include', 'insensitive', 'male', 'partners', 'sensitive', 'gay', 'male', 'friends', 'period', 'venturing', 'BDSM', 'scene', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'women', 'result', 'not', 'just', 'raunchy', 'fun', 'also', 'political', 'honest', 'empowering', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'such', 'important', 'performer', 'so', 'many', 'minorities', 'who', 'rarely', 'really', 'have', 'voices', 'heard', 'female', 'asian', 'gay', 'etc', 'guts', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'such', 'uncensored', 'often', 'unflattering', 'way', 'wonder', 'fans', 'feel', 'connection']",N/A

Sure, there was a joke at the end of each, but I prefer stand up comics to deliver jokes a littler quicker than 1 every 3 minutes. It's as if she decided to use the recording of the show to get a serious message across. The serious 'hesitate' speech at the end did not make me hesitate to turn off this poor example of comedy. A nearly 5 minute speech on how we should accept everyone.The voices that she does to represent other characters are extremely annoying. Especially the colonic therapist who is helping her when she goes for internal irrigation. That whole routine sounds like she actually went there and only for the purpose of new material.

One of the few comedians I do like is Margaret Cho. I have been a fan of her since her short lived sitcom ""American Girl"" which was way ahead of its time for tv (and still is). At the time I didn't realize she was a stand up comedian until I saw a comedy special in the late '90s on comedy central. I never laughed as hard before as I did then. I love her irreverance sense of humor. Her humor is definitely blue but it is honest coming from her POV.""Notorious C.H.O"" is easily one of my favorite dvds of her stand up work. My favorite moments during the film was when she talked about her drag queen friends from high school at the local Baskin Robbins. I was literally laughing so hard, tears were rolling down my eyes. I also had a good laugh when Margaret discussed about her experience in an S&M; club. I thought Margaret did an excellent job at weaving poignancy of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 with humor as well as with the topic of gay marriage (which was not a big issue then as it has been in the past year).Margaret's sense of humor is not for everyone. Her humor certainly crosses over on to the raunchy side. A lot of her content on ""Notorious C.H.O"" is sex-related but it is coming from her own personal experiences.

Definitely not for the feint of heart, this is cutting edge comedy at its best.However, while the comedy is funny, Cho delivers a tour de force ending that is some of the most beautiful poetry spoken on film. She directly challenges anyone who considers themselves a minority to break out of the bonds our society has clamped to our feet, and defy them by the greatest act of revolution: daring to have self-esteem. Her words were so powerful I even wrote them down:&quot;For us, to have self-esteem is truly an act of revolution.And our revolution is long overdue. I urge you today ,especially today in these times of terrorism and chaos, to love yourselves without reservation, and to love each other without restraint.&quot;Thank you, Margaret Cho, for leading the charge, for not buckling under pressure, for giving us the power of your talented insights, for being a leader of a vision of tomorrow.",4,Notoriously Amazingly,1038528000,"11 29, 2002",2002,1184,"['doubt', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'definitely', 'mind', 'Nothing', 'taboo', 'topic', 'off-limits', 'wonderful', 'candor', 'spark', 'comedy', 'runs', 'routine', 'fresh', 'honest', 'funny', 'stone', 'unturned', 'controversial', 'thought', 'untouched', 'Definitely', 'not', 'feint', 'heart', 'cutting', 'edge', 'comedy', 'best.However', 'comedy', 'funny', 'Cho', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'ending', 'most', 'beautiful', 'poetry', 'spoken', 'film', 'directly', 'anyone', 'who', 'minority', 'break', 'bonds', 'society', 'clamped', 'feet', 'defy', 'greatest', 'act', 'revolution', 'daring', 'have', 'self-esteem', 'words', 'were', 'so', 'powerful', 'even', 'wrote', 'down', 'quot', 'have', 'self-esteem', 'truly', 'act', 'revolution.And', 'revolution', 'long', 'overdue', 'urge', 'today', 'especially', 'today', 'times', 'terrorism', 'chaos', 'love', 'yourselves', 'reservation', 'love', 'other', 'restraint.', 'quot', 'Thank', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'leading', 'charge', 'not', 'buckling', 'pressure', 'giving', 'power', 'talented', 'insights', 'being', 'leader', 'vision', 'tomorrow']",N/A

After all, ""I'm the One That I Want"" is the pinnacle of stand-up: revelatory while screamingly funny, a trip through dark times to self awareness, angry without being self pitying. All served up with salty language and the kind of insight only experience can bring. And topped off with the hilarious routine about her mother looking at gay porn in their bookstore in San Francisco.After all that, what was left for ""Notorious?""As it turns out, plenty. Margaret Cho wisely avoids the inner demons that fueled ""I'm the One,"" and instead just piles on the laughs. There are sad moments, as when she remembers her friends who have died of AIDS, but since she recalls them with tales of their drag queen performance pieces at Baskin Robbins (you'll never look at sprinkles the same way again) and then decides they've become her guardian angels (""Girl, you're going out dressed in that?!""), there's no time for tears.As she says in one of the features, if ""I'm the One"" was about coming of age, ""Notorious"" is about being of age. It's mostly about sex, and is quite often nasty without being offensive. Cho takes such a cheerful view of offbeat sexuality (getting fisted by a lesbian dwarf?) that there's no way to be put off by it. Yes, she focuses a lot on her gay friends and fans, but to say she shouldn't is no different from saying she shouldn't talk about being Korean. These are the people in her life, and she turns them all into memorable characters.Finally, the commentary track by her ""mother"" (Cho in character) is wonderfully bizarre. It wanders a bit, especially as other people join her, but it demonstrates Cho's remarkable grasp of character. It's not always funny, but it's a brilliant acting job, and provides insight into how Cho thinks and develops her work.

Deft, dramatic and zany like always, ""The Notorious Cho"" is a perfect follow-up to last year's phenomenal ""I'm The One that I Want.""  Where that movie provided more belly-laughs than this does, ""Notorious"" offers a deeper, more personal recipe for laughter.  Cho skips easily from one raunchy topic to another sounding off on all sorts of themes - from her bisexual exploits to her Korean parents to her drag queen best friends, watching from heaven as she tears the roof off the concert hall.  Her best bits here revolve around her dead-on imitation of her mother.  Cho's followers have come to know and love the parent with a unique opinion on everything and viewers get the chance to meet both her parents in pre and post-concert interviews that accompany the movie.  This behind-the-scenes look at her parents only make Cho's bits about her family more hysterical - the touching and funny story she tells in full mother character about her ""dad-dee's"" gay friend is a showstopper, while mom's ride atop a camel will leave you howling!  The raunchy riffs about oral sex - both straight and gay - are inspired, even when she relates her ""volunteer"" work at Ground Zero in the opening monologue.  ""I'm the One That I Want"" was a more accessible film - sort of an intro to this Korean comic genius - while ""Notorious"" is a more personal and intimate portrait that some folks may find too sleazy.  In any case, it's a whirlwind of hysteria and fun, especially for us CHO fans.

Cliched punchlines followed by drawn out and thus piquing stops make for a painfully tedious viewing.If you have a sense of humor even mildly above average, skip this  tripe regardless of whatever minority rave you are exposed to.",1,"DID I MISS IT ALL, OR IS SHE JUST NOT FUNNY TO BEGIN WITH?",1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,775,"['had', 'high', 'expectations', 'DVD', 'was', 'given', 'gift', 'rave', 'review', 'Korean', 'damsel', 'trying', 'do', 'black', 'comedy', 'jig', 'hindsight', 'am', 'glad', 'didnt', 'shell', 'out', 'egregiously', 'uninspired', 'performance', 'say', 'least.Ms', 'Cho', 'can', 'break', 'sexual', 'taboos', 'quite', 'frankly', 'most', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'smashed', 'many', 'times', 'very', 'very', 'fundamental', 'tenet', 'perhaps', 'teach', 'Stand-up', '101', 'have', 'decent', 'up', 'sleeve', 'ideally', 'not', 'pause', 'eternity', 'Cliched', 'punchlines', 'followed', 'drawn', 'thus', 'piquing', 'stops', 'make', 'painfully', 'tedious', 'viewing.If', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'even', 'mildly', 'above', 'average', 'skip', 'tripe', 'regardless', 'minority', 'rave', 'are', 'exposed']",N/A

I find her way overrated.She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material.However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the ""outlaw"" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base.

Most of this film, however, seems forced and unpolished.  She is so busy trying to wrap her humor around politically incorrect material, that she doesn't bother to cut the parts that aren't funny - which unfortunately is most of it.  The part where she is imitating gay men blocking out her jokes about straight people is funny.  Mommy in Israel, at the very end, is probably the best part.  Most of it, though, is just nasty comedy about her sexcapades with both genders, in gross detail.  Not only do you feel sorry for her putting on this unpolished and not ready performance, but her confessions about all that she has done makes you feel sad for her life as well.I don't mind politically incorrect humor.  I definetely don't mind humorist taking pot shots at the political scene.  But it must be funny first!  This wasn't funny at all.

I think her impressions are horribly annoying.  She sounds bitter and evil rather goofy and funny.  I would be surprised if a laugh track wasn't used. The camera never focused once on the audience. So who knows if they were really laughing.  I think she is unattractive and that adds insult to injury.  She think she is all that and a bowl of soy sauce but she isn't.  Her only funny impression was when she was making fun of her asian parents.  Other than that the best way to describe her unorignal comedy style is that it is comprised of generic and vulgar anecdotes that are more annoying to hear than funny.  I think after her shows she is laughing at her audience back stage because she is managing to get away with telling awful jokes and stories and making it huge.

Mulvihill ""vjm""","[3, 7]","Of course, I mean my review title facetiously.This DVD is my first real exposure to the world of Margaret Cho, having only glimpsed her stand-up and sitcom in passing through the years.  ""Notorious"" was notorious (seems like a good word to use in this context) at the time of release for breaking through various boundaries and diving into blue material.  Being a large fan of comedians who use language like a mallet (i.e., Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Bill Hicks, David Cross, Peter Cook & Dudley Moore), I snapped this disc up.The beginning of the film - all pre-show audience anticipation and cutaway interviews - nearly pulled me out of enjoying the thing.  That may have shaded my view of the performance itself, as I didn't find it all that funny.  Some very amusing moments  pop up, but momentum is constantly halted by Cho's less-than-enthusiastic stand-in-one-spot performance (she admits in the extra features that she was dead tired by the time the film was shot) and the director, who appears not to map out any storyboards ahead of time and switches camera angles seemingly at random (but rarely on the *beat* of a joke or routine).Cho's tiredness translates very well [...] and becomes quite a drag by the time the film is over.The extras are cute, but nothing spectacular.It is possible that I just don't get it.  George Carlin is the ""hippy"" comic, Lenny Bruce is the ""beatnik"" comic and Richard Pryor is the ""black"" comic, Margaret Cho is the ""gay"" comic.  That's cool.

Her failed sitcom had orientalness (and poking fun at it) which may had unnerved some people, particularly those behind the sponsors......I, however, laughed my buns off during this one woman show filmed in Seattle. I laughed because Cho's brashness and complete bluntness is disarmingly hilarious and completely brilliant...one would not expect that rawness from a little Korean lady. Her sendups about her motherdear are roll down on the floor funny. And may be construed as derogatory to some Oriental-Americans: she redeems herself for making a plea for true acceptance and equality for all. Her escapades and misadventures--the fisting, the leather club(John Goodman, not Sharon Stone and unzipping the mouth mask)--garners some of the same type of laughs that Pyror is known for. Cho's routine is the kind that makes you laugh because you are embarrassed that you are laughing at something so bold and taboo. And you know what? Cho, notorious or not, is a great comic. Hey! Anyone who makes me laugh that hard has gotta be one. As one interviewee notes at the end of the show, Cho's Notorious ain't for the weak at heart. I say, So What?
