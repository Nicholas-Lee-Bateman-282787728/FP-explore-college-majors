The blu-ray release is OUTSTANDING!!! The film itself is powerful, touching and absolutely wonderful; gotta love South Korean cinema. I also bought the South Korean blu-ray releases for ""Deranged"" and ""Helpless"". Unfortunately for domestic customers, ""A Werewolf Boy"" is only being released here on dvd. THAT TRULY BITES!!! Really! The same was with the domestic release of South Korea's disaster epic ""The Tower"" being released domestically ONLY on dvd. Why Magnolia or Well Go USA didn't grab up these two great films for domestic blu-ray releases is anyone's guess? I am ordering the South Korean blu-ray version for ""The Tower"" as well. There is no point in buying dvd versions when these films are available for import on excellent blu-rays WITH English subtitles. CJ Entertainment dropped the ball on both of these great films. Oh well.",5,"Just like with ""The Tower"", we get short-changed on a domestic release.",1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,983,"['watching', 'incredible', 'film', 'bought', 'South', 'Korean', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'couple', 'months', 'come', 'English', 'subtitles', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'OUTSTANDING', 'film', 'powerful', 'touching', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'got', 'ta', 'South', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'also', 'bought', 'South', 'Korean', 'blu-ray', 'releases', 'Deranged', 'Helpless', 'Unfortunately', 'domestic', 'customers', 'Werewolf', 'Boy', 'only', 'being', 'released', 'here', 'dvd', 'TRULY', 'BITES', 'Really', 'same', 'was', 'domestic', 'release', 'South', 'Korea', 'disaster', 'epic', 'Tower', 'being', 'released', 'domestically', 'ONLY', 'dvd', 'Why', 'Magnolia', 'Well', 'Go', 'USA', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'up', 'two', 'great', 'films', 'domestic', 'blu-ray', 'releases', 'anyone', 'guess', 'am', 'ordering', 'South', 'Korean', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'Tower', 'as', 'well', 'point', 'buying', 'dvd', 'versions', 'when', 'films', 'are', 'available', 'import', 'excellent', 'blu-rays', 'WITH', 'English', 'subtitles', 'CJ', 'Entertainment', 'dropped', 'ball', 'great', 'films', 'Oh', 'well']",A Werewolf Boy
1650748,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00CTHOG02,C. Sawin,"[6, 7]","The fantasy and romance aspects of ""A Werewolf Boy"" are well covered as discovering a strange creature living in someone's house who the family eventually takes a liking to is bizarre to consider yet easy to relate to. Compassion is a feeling ""A Werewolf Boy"" takes pride in making not only the viewer feel on a consistent basis, but its characters as well. The relationship between Suni and Cheol-su is also a bit awkward as you can probably imagine, but it results in feeling like ""Beauty and the Beast"" by the time it's over.The werewolf part of ""A Werewolf Boy"" is where things get tricky. While Cheol-su has werewolf traits, he doesn't really have much in common with them. There's one brief scene where he howls at the moon and all of his transformations are at night, but a full moon doesn't affect him one way or the other and he only transforms when he gets angry. He's more or less a hairy version of ""The Incredible Hulk."" Cheol-su is super strong and is absolutely feral by nature, but also extremely gentle and obedient around Suni. His transformation looks to be all computer generated and similar to what the transformations looked like in ""The Wolfman"" remake from a few years ago. The odd thing is his clothes never rip or tear while nearly all of his hair seems to be on his head and makes him seem top heavy.Ji-tae (Yoo Yeon-seok) is the character who will get under your skin the most. A young boy who fell into money because of his father, Ji-tae buys the cottage for Suni and her family but holds it over their heads the entire film and expects Suni to marry him in the future. Demanding respect despite acting poorly, Ji-tae throws tantrums when he doesn't get his way and is extremely spoiled. Naturally, he hates Cheol-su right from the start and contributes to the small village treating Cheol-su like a monster. Ji-tae does nothing other than stir the pot to try and get his way.The film throws the viewer into the struggle of figuring out whether Cheol-su is a monster or not. Even though Ji-tae gets away with way more than he should for the first hour and a half and Suni doesn't really fully let her guard down until it's too late, the last half hour of ""A Werewolf Boy"" is absolutely phenomenal. The film really starts to aim at your emotions around the time Cheol-su and Suni have a heart to heart in the forest, but once you come back to the present and what the elderly Suni discovers in Cheol-su's room is superb. The sequence is extremely touching, emotional, and breathtaking. The entire film builds to that moment and it pays off in spades.""A Werewolf Boy"" is essentially a South Korean take on ""Twilight,"" but with a werewolf who's had its origins diluted and saturated. The staggering sense of compassion that the film portrays is amazing and its heartfelt ending is stunning. Even though it may draw comparisons to ""Twilight,"" ""A Werewolf Boy"" has a more genuine demeanor with well-developed characters and an overpowering sense of benevolence.Special features on the single-disc DVD release include a ""Making of"" featurette that's nearly an hour long, over 11 minutes of Deleted Scenes with and without commentary, the nearly nine minute ""The Language of Cheol-su,"" a ""Poster Shoot"" that runs a little over four minutes, and an Alternate Ending. Other than the deleted scenes, unfortunately none of the other special features are subtitled. The alternate ending looks to be quite similar only its shot with Park Bo-young instead of Lee Young-lan.",4,A compassionate and sincere journey,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,3489,"['fantasy', 'romance', 'aspects', 'A', 'Werewolf', 'Boy', 'are', 'well', 'covered', 'discovering', 'strange', 'creature', 'living', 'someone', 'house', 'who', 'family', 'eventually', 'liking', 'bizarre', 'consider', 'yet', 'easy', 'relate', 'Compassion', 'feeling', 'Werewolf', 'Boy', 'pride', 'making', 'not', 'only', 'viewer', 'feel', 'consistent', 'basis', 'characters', 'well', 'relationship', 'Suni', 'Cheol-su', 'also', 'bit', 'awkward', 'can', 'probably', 'imagine', 'results', 'feeling', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'time', 'over.The', 'werewolf', 'part', 'A', 'Werewolf', 'Boy', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'tricky', 'Cheol-su', 'werewolf', 'traits', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'where', 'moon', 'transformations', 'are', 'night', 'full', 'moon', ""n't"", 'affect', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'only', 'when', 'angry', 'more', 'less', 'hairy', 'version', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Cheol-su', 'super', 'strong', 'absolutely', 'feral', 'nature', 'also', 'extremely', 'gentle', 'obedient', 'Suni', 'transformation', 'be', 'computer', 'generated', 'similar', 'what', 'transformations', 'looked', 'Wolfman', 'remake', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'odd', 'thing', 'clothes', 'never', 'rip', 'tear', 'nearly', 'hair', 'be', 'head', 'seem', 'top', 'heavy.Ji-tae', 'Yoo', 'Yeon-seok', 'character', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'skin', 'most', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'fell', 'money', 'father', 'Ji-tae', 'cottage', 'Suni', 'family', 'over', 'heads', 'entire', 'film', 'Suni', 'marry', 'future', 'Demanding', 'respect', 'acting', 'poorly', 'Ji-tae', 'tantrums', 'when', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'extremely', 'spoiled', 'Naturally', 'Cheol-su', 'right', 'start', 'contributes', 'small', 'village', 'treating', 'Cheol-su', 'monster', 'Ji-tae', 'nothing', 'other', 'stir', 'pot', 'try', 'get', 'way.The', 'film', 'viewer', 'struggle', 'figuring', 'out', 'Cheol-su', 'monster', 'not', 'Even', 'Ji-tae', 'away', 'way', 'more', 'should', 'first', 'hour', 'half', 'Suni', ""n't"", 'really', 'fully', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'too', 'late', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'A', 'Werewolf', 'Boy', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'film', 'really', 'aim', 'emotions', 'time', 'Cheol-su', 'Suni', 'have', 'heart', 'heart', 'forest', 'once', 'come', 'back', 'present', 'what', 'elderly', 'Suni', 'discovers', 'Cheol-su', 'room', 'superb', 'sequence', 'extremely', 'touching', 'emotional', 'breathtaking', 'entire', 'film', 'builds', 'moment', 'spades', 'Werewolf', 'Boy', 'essentially', 'South', 'Korean', 'take', 'Twilight', 'werewolf', 'who', 'had', 'origins', 'diluted', 'saturated', 'staggering', 'sense', 'compassion', 'film', 'portrays', 'amazing', 'heartfelt', 'ending', 'stunning', 'Even', 'may', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Twilight', 'A', 'Werewolf', 'Boy', 'more', 'genuine', 'demeanor', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'overpowering', 'sense', 'benevolence.Special', 'features', 'single-disc', 'DVD', 'release', 'include', 'Making', 'featurette', 'nearly', 'hour', 'long', '11', 'minutes', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'commentary', 'nearly', 'nine', 'minute', 'Language', 'Cheol-su', 'Poster', 'Shoot', 'little', 'four', 'minutes', 'Alternate', 'Ending', 'Other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'unfortunately', 'none', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'subtitled', 'alternate', 'ending', 'looks', 'be', 'quite', 'similar', 'only', 'shot', 'Park', 'Bo-young', 'instead', 'Lee', 'Young-lan']",A Werewolf Boy
1650749,AIO247KHD2O40,B00CTHOG02,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","Werewolf Boy probably missed out on the success it deserved due to its title being assumed as just another werewolf film and even dismissed as oh no not another teen falling in love with a werewolf/vampire story.  But rest assured there's no romance in this one, there is love, but it's the love a girl feels towards her pet dog and the loyalty given in return by that canine, who just happens to be in a human body.  In fact the acting from Joong-ki Song who plays the canine boy is superb and believable as how a feral dog (well wolf in his case) would behave, as well as one being domesticated as the film goes on. Joong-Ki Song obviously studied actual dog behaviour as he behaves just like one. His character was born and raised amongst wolves before the scientist/farmer/property owner has a heart attack (we witness this at the start of the film) resulting in the boy spending an undisclosed amount of time fending for himself on the farm (the other wolves seem to have run off, been killed we're not told).  During the film some speculation is made by authorities that experiments were done on the farm to help win the war but we never really know any more than the single mother and her young family are told which is good because too much information highlights holes in a backstory. The mother and her children move to the farm sometime after the war.Contains some spoilers - It is the initial unpacking days that Suni (the oldest of the children) is frightened by a dog one night.  With her mother they discover it again the next day only to realise the dog is in fact a feral child, probably in his teens.  The boy can't talk and is very wary of these new inhabitants of his home but is lured closer by gifts of food by the caring mother who wrongfully assumes authorities will want to care for the boy.  Since he's older than the adoptable age the mother is stuck looking after the feral kid while an unmotivated Korean bureaucracy tries to find somewhere to put him.  Suni doesn't want the feral kid who the mother is treating like an unofficial member of the family around, until one day she unpacks a dog training manual and decides to make the situation, especially meal times somewhat bearable.  What follows is a film of attachment and loyalty to a pet and by a pet that we have granted seen countless times before, just not with a human playing the pet.  Throw in your usual villain, this time round it's the spoilt rich kid son of the landlord who makes it quit clear he expects the beautiful Suni to marry him down the track and is used to being given whatever he wants.  When she doesn't tow the line he of course tries to force the issue but a snarling pet wolf/boy won't let the thug and his mates drag her into their car.  Of course from that moment on the goal becomes to frame, kill or do whatever it takes to remove Suni's pet from the situation.Bo-yeong Park who plays Suni does a great acting job interacting with her wolf/brother pet as well.  There's a lot of recreations of typical dog and their owner or dog not understanding community has turned on it and trying to get it to run movie scenes with the two characters we've seen on numerous occasions over the years which makes the movie a little predictable but still it's a great film.Language is in Korean with English subtitles.  It is a flashback by an old lady to her childhood film and some of the English words used are quite funny such as the villain is referred to as a slimeball when you wonder if even back in those days they would have used something a bit stronger.",5,A Classic Tale of Canine Loyalty and a Girl's Love For Her Pet (Who Just Happens to Be in the Body of a Human),1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,3565,"['Werewolf', 'Boy', 'probably', 'missed', 'out', 'success', 'deserved', 'due', 'title', 'being', 'assumed', 'just', 'werewolf', 'film', 'even', 'dismissed', 'oh', 'not', 'teen', 'falling', 'love', 'werewolf/vampire', 'story', 'rest', 'assured', 'romance', 'one', 'love', 'love', 'girl', 'feels', 'pet', 'dog', 'loyalty', 'given', 'return', 'canine', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'human', 'body', 'fact', 'acting', 'Joong-ki', 'Song', 'who', 'canine', 'boy', 'superb', 'believable', 'how', 'feral', 'dog', 'well', 'wolf', 'case', 'would', 'behave', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'being', 'domesticated', 'film', 'Joong-Ki', 'Song', 'obviously', 'studied', 'actual', 'dog', 'behaviour', 'just', 'one', 'character', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'amongst', 'wolves', 'scientist/farmer/property', 'owner', 'heart', 'attack', 'witness', 'start', 'film', 'resulting', 'boy', 'spending', 'undisclosed', 'amount', 'time', 'fending', 'farm', 'other', 'wolves', 'seem', 'have', 'run', 'off', 'been', 'killed', ""'re"", 'not', 'told', 'film', 'speculation', 'made', 'authorities', 'experiments', 'were', 'done', 'farm', 'help', 'win', 'war', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'more', 'single', 'mother', 'young', 'family', 'are', 'told', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'highlights', 'backstory', 'mother', 'children', 'move', 'farm', 'sometime', 'war.Contains', 'spoilers', 'initial', 'unpacking', 'days', 'Suni', 'oldest', 'children', 'frightened', 'dog', 'one', 'night', 'mother', 'discover', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'only', 'realise', 'dog', 'fact', 'feral', 'child', 'probably', 'teens', 'boy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'very', 'wary', 'new', 'inhabitants', 'home', 'lured', 'closer', 'gifts', 'food', 'caring', 'mother', 'who', 'wrongfully', 'authorities', 'will', 'want', 'care', 'boy', 'older', 'adoptable', 'age', 'mother', 'stuck', 'looking', 'feral', 'kid', 'unmotivated', 'Korean', 'bureaucracy', 'tries', 'find', 'somewhere', 'put', 'Suni', ""n't"", 'want', 'feral', 'kid', 'who', 'mother', 'treating', 'unofficial', 'member', 'family', 'around', 'one', 'day', 'dog', 'training', 'manual', 'make', 'situation', 'especially', 'meal', 'times', 'somewhat', 'bearable', 'What', 'film', 'attachment', 'loyalty', 'pet', 'pet', 'have', 'granted', 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'just', 'not', 'human', 'playing', 'pet', 'Throw', 'usual', 'villain', 'time', 'spoilt', 'rich', 'kid', 'son', 'landlord', 'who', 'quit', 'clear', 'beautiful', 'Suni', 'marry', 'down', 'track', 'used', 'being', 'given', 'When', ""n't"", 'tow', 'line', 'course', 'tries', 'force', 'issue', 'snarling', 'pet', 'wolf/boy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'thug', 'mates', 'drag', 'car', 'course', 'moment', 'goal', 'frame', 'kill', 'do', 'remove', 'Suni', 'pet', 'situation.Bo-yeong', 'Park', 'who', 'Suni', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'interacting', 'wolf/brother', 'pet', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'recreations', 'typical', 'dog', 'owner', 'dog', 'not', 'understanding', 'community', 'turned', 'trying', 'get', 'run', 'movie', 'scenes', 'two', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'years', 'movie', 'little', 'predictable', 'still', 'great', 'film.Language', 'Korean', 'English', 'subtitles', 'flashback', 'old', 'lady', 'childhood', 'film', 'English', 'words', 'used', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'such', 'villain', 'referred', 'slimeball', 'when', 'wonder', 'even', 'back', 'days', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'something', 'bit', 'stronger']",A Werewolf Boy

I also wanted to see something different that the Twilight saga, which morphed into something else once I got pulled in.  Well, this story was worth it.  It was told very simply.  Once you gave into the premise, the way the wolf imprinted on the girl, the joy he felt in belonging, it was sentimental and satisfying.  MDH was unhappy w/ the way the authorities treated the wolf boy as an animal.  But that was expected, though heart rendering.

When the girl teaches the boy these things he develops profound love and respect for her and would risk his life for her.
