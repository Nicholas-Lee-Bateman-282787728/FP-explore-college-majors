1679885,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B00GOC74QG,S. T. Peterson,"[0, 4]","I remember this show back then but never really watched it as I can't stand men who wear their hair long in the back and short all over like the ""Brian"" character. I watch it now and see that not only can I still not stand that character's clownish look (hair and clothes)  I cannot stand the character . . . what an annoying loser. I also think the man who played it looked creepy around the eyes like a clown does. Of course he can't help it but just don't care to sit around and look at him. Also that Crystal Bernard character is annoying as well. Maybe it is her. And that other female character too. The female characters are kinda slutty losers. Low class when you get down to it. But the good thing is I discovered the hottie brother-Joe. Nice to look at. Too bad that guy is old as dirt now and looks it. Anyway this show is OK. It is kinda funny over all. But they kinda force it with the dumb stuff. Cheap laughs.But it is not what the entire show is based upon like Will and Grace and Friends. Pretty harmless stuff but the liberal agenda appear here and there in the writing  .. . gay . . . communism . . . feminism . . . Christmas without God . . . environmentalism . . . that kinda stuff . . . you see the ground work back then in those shows. But I will leave this review on a very high note. I LOVE the character Sconset Sal. SHE IS FUNNY!!!!! I LOVE that character. I even looked up the actress. (Another liberal nut . . . uh eccentric artist . . . but good at what she does at least in this clip.) She is one of my favorite characters of any show!!! Check her out . . .
