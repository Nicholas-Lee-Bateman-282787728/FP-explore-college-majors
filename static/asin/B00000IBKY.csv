After viewing it with my wife we both agree with the general feeling of the reviews listed here.  It SHOULD be a better movie.  It SHOULD be a captivating story.  It HAS a terrific cast.  So, why is it so boring to watch?I respect Val Kilmer's acting and his integrity as an actor.  Most critics seem to agree that he is an ""intelligent"" actor.  Why is he so miscast in so many things?  Would someone please write a script specifically with the talents of Val Kilmer in mind... please?This story tries to be many things from a story of independance to a love story, but fails pretty miserably at all that it attempts.Like many of us, I was introduced to his acting in the low budget, now cult icon film ""Real Genus"" (naturally, I have reviewed this film also) where as the young, smart mouthed, fast talking College senior he literally stole the show from Gabe Jarrett who got top billing and was virtually never heard from again.

This isn't much until you join the another part, because that's yes, a very big and I think very difficult neuro-physiological problem. Perhaps yes, in the USA that question has been attempted to cure. If yes, I don't know with what results.Because the core problem is Virgil, practically a person born blind so he never was able to see nothing, is submitted in New York to surgery of his congenital cataracts. Below this relatively simple problem of the eye, solved by ordinary surgery today, he has also the rare disease of retinitis pigmentosa. This disease is real in some few people but the question goes more far than the strictly clinical problem, as Virgil recovers the sight after surgery but although he sees with his eyes, he doesn't know nor understands what are the things and people he sees: the persons, the buildings... nothing. This is because the brain needs training in order  to interpret the images. Virgil's brain hasn't that training and he's yet a man over 30 years old.A hard question. The problem is similar to that of a person which hears a foreign unknown language: he hears, but doesn't understand nothing.This is an enormous problem as sight is a very delicate sense, very prone to false feelings.  I have my doubts if cinema is the best  mean to show this difficult question.

The movie starts out nicely at a good pace,  with Kilmer and Sorvino falling in love at a mountain retreat. The romance  looks as though it will make it through anything, until Sorvino introduces  the idea of seeing again to Kilmer. This is the point at which the movie  takes a long, droning turn, as Kilmer moves to New York with his new love  to regain his sight. The plot jumps back and forth between the emotions of  the lovers, which may confuse people with smaller brain capacities. There  are too many break-ups and make-ups between the two leads, and while this  movie is based on an actual story, there could've been one or two of these  instances left out to sustain a steady flow.

502201,AJDWUMO2AIUB,B00000IBKY,D. Miller,"[0, 0]","All in all, a bit of a disappointment. Strong beginning, weak ending. The fact that it's based on a true story is its only true redeeming quality and also may partly explain the reason for its extreme dullness.The storyline, in a nutshell, is a man who has been blind for essentially all of his life (since he was 3) has a break-through operation that restores his vision, however he's very disoriented living in this world where he has grown up associating things with the way they feel and not the way they look. I think the closest any of us have probably been to that would be when we've been in a position where we've heard about a place or a person so we've sort of gotten a visual image of it in our minds only to find that when we actually go to the place or meet the person, it's nothing like what our brains have concocted.Mira Sorvino didn't make any earth-shattering revelations in her role as Amy, the girl who falls for this funny, good-looking blind man named Virgil played by Val Kilmer who did a great job with this rather difficult character. I appreciated Kelly McGillis who was very convincing as Virgil's over-protective sister. And the best surprise of the day was Nathan Lane in a bit part as a teacher for blind children. It was refreshing to have at least a little bit of decent humor thrown into this rather slow-moving tale.Of course despite the films shortcomings, there are people that it appeals to...  I first saw it in the theater and ended up at my  showing early enough to watched the last show's audience walking out, some of whom where in tears. By the time I reached the end of the movie (which felt like about 5 years later) I'm afraid I was at a loss for what exactly those people had been crying about, but different things touch people in different ways I suppose. Personally, I was just looking forward to getting some fresh air.Bottom line: I wasn't very impressed. The only thing I took away from this film was the desire to meet a a great guy like that someday, and that's just not enough...I think a film should give us more to think about and more to feel.",2,"Touching tale, but didn't impress",1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,2103,"['bit', 'disappointment', 'Strong', 'beginning', 'weak', 'ending', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'only', 'true', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'also', 'may', 'partly', 'explain', 'reason', 'extreme', 'dullness.The', 'storyline', 'nutshell', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'blind', 'essentially', 'life', 'was', '3', 'break-through', 'operation', 'vision', 'however', 'very', 'disoriented', 'living', 'world', 'where', 'grown', 'up', 'associating', 'things', 'way', 'feel', 'not', 'way', 'look', 'think', 'closest', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'would', 'be', 'when', ""'ve"", 'been', 'position', 'where', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'place', 'person', ""'ve"", 'sort', 'gotten', 'visual', 'image', 'minds', 'only', 'find', 'when', 'actually', 'go', 'place', 'meet', 'person', 'nothing', 'what', 'brains', 'have', 'concocted.Mira', 'Sorvino', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'earth-shattering', 'revelations', 'role', 'Amy', 'girl', 'who', 'funny', 'good-looking', 'blind', 'man', 'named', 'Virgil', 'played', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'who', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'rather', 'difficult', 'character', 'appreciated', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'Virgil', 'over-protective', 'sister', 'best', 'surprise', 'day', 'was', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'bit', 'part', 'teacher', 'blind', 'children', 'was', 'refreshing', 'have', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'decent', 'humor', 'thrown', 'rather', 'slow-moving', 'tale.Of', 'course', 'films', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'people', 'appeals', 'first', 'saw', 'theater', 'ended', 'up', 'showing', 'early', 'enough', 'watched', 'last', 'show', 'audience', 'walking', 'out', 'whom', 'where', 'tears', 'time', 'reached', 'end', 'movie', 'felt', '5', 'years', 'later', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'was', 'loss', 'what', 'exactly', 'people', 'had', 'been', 'crying', 'about', 'different', 'things', 'touch', 'people', 'different', 'ways', 'suppose', 'Personally', 'was', 'just', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'fresh', 'air.Bottom', 'line', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressed', 'only', 'thing', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'desire', 'meet', 'great', 'guy', 'someday', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'give', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'feel']",At First Sight VHS

502203,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00000IBKY,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","AT FIRST SIGHT (1998, 1999) is based on a true story, investigated by Dr. Oliver Sacks and recounted in his book, ""An Anthropologist on Mars"". Sacks writes of Shirl Jennings, a 50-year-old blind man who lost his sight around age 10; 40 years later, with super-advanced cataract surgery, he regains his sight.OK...enough history for the moment. This film is dreadful as film. Though I wish I'd seen it when it was new, it certainly hasn't improved with age. The lines are sometimes stupid, the acting is a horror (considering the talents of Val Kilmer, Nathan Lane and the others). The direction is anything but tight. The first hour of this 2-hour film is dedicated to Kilmer's goofy grins and at certain moments, imitations of Stevie Wonder.Kilmer plays Virgil, the character based on Shirl Jennings, a young blind masseur who fatefully meets Amy (a dreadful, amateurish Mira Sorvino). They fall in love, she wants him to be able to see again, and gets him in to see a doctor (the great Bruce Davison) who can indeed cure his blindness with surgery. So far, so ho-hum. After all, it took an hour just to establish Virgil is blind and basically happy. The medical part isn't even addressed until much further than an hour into this.Aside from the obvious questions about blindness, sight, and their meanings, I find this story addresses something bigger: disability/disease in general. How we accept the disabled, the needs and conditions. We're bad at accepting. It never surprises me to know blindness is at the heart of this insensitive law of human nature. On her first visit to Virgil's home, Amy leaves a chair away from the table and Virgil promptly smashes into it.One cannot change the environment of an unsighted person's home. It is like deciding to blind one of your relatives for fun. This film drives home many such powerful thoughts, and the facts are well researched. When Virgil regains his sight, the near madness and struggle is totally accurate. The only real documented case (correct me if I'm wrong) is of a young woman in the 19th century, who nearly went insane when her vision returned. She, of course, lost her sight again and was again happy. Kilmer even uses a few of her lines when he first sees again.The trouble here is the story and direction. Kilmer gives a somewhat embarrassing performance, and as I said, Sorvino absolutely stinks. The introduction of Nathan Lane as an unconventional teacher of the blind- who is supposed to help Virgil learn to see- is laughable. So is the unnecessary presence of the father who abandoned Virgil and his sister, Jenny (a great turn by Kelly McGillis).It must be obvious that whatever could be taught by Virgil and Amy is ruined by the insulting old hat that women always want to impossibly change the men in their lives. Also, the revolting hostility between Amy and Jenny (Jenny is ""jealous"") is as insulting to women as their alleged desire to change all men.We suffer for our art!I noticed Dr. Sacks makes an uncredited appearance as an audience member (cheerful grey-bearded fellow at the end). He has worked hard to establish what I call ""medical anthropology"", a great field that is vital to our health. In short, all of life is a battle of acceptance.The unsighted may never win that inhumane battle; they may never find the understanding they deserve.

So when this one came out we watched (actually I watched he listened and I explain any parts that  needed explaining) it together. Unlike my husband, Virgil (Val Kilmer) has  been blind since he was a very young toddler. Whose only memory of sight is  a fluffy pink cloud. I have always wondered what it would be like for  someone with no memories of sight to have their sight fully restored. When  Virgil meets Amy (Mira Sorvino) they fall in love. He shows her his world  and teaches her to ice skate on a frozen pond. She meets his family and  guide dog. Then she, wanting to help him get more out of life tells him of  a doctor (Bruce Davison)who can hopefully restore his sight. So after much  encouragement he goes to her world in the city and agrees to see this  doctor. But to Amy's shock, when his sight is restored he is not happy with  his new world and sight is not what he had imagined it would be. It was  very interesting that he could not identify an object as simple as a can of  coke until he felt it with his hands, then understood the connection  between the two. Living with a blind man for 12 years, that made perfect  sense. After adjusting somewhat to this he comes to enjoy his newly found  sight, and takes in all that he can. But has trouble coping with the new  trials it brings. Though very educated, he can not read and doesn't have  his blindness to explain why. I found it to be a very accurate movie  dealing with blindness and sight restored. It ends well. And Val Kilmer did  well portraying a blind man in this movie. I enjoyed this movie and learned  a little more about what different blind people go through. I have known  many through my husband over the last several years and admire them for  their strength, courage and abilities to do just about anything. I don't  know if I could be so strong. This is a very nice story I would enjoy  seeing again.",5,The miracle of sight...but what if you've never seen before?,951696000,"02 28, 2000",2000,2018,"['husband', '12', 'years', 'diabete', 'dwindling', 'health', 'watched', 'movie', 'blind', 'man', 'first', 'date', 'So', 'when', 'one', 'came', 'watched', 'actually', 'watched', 'listened', 'explain', 'parts', 'needed', 'explaining', 'together', 'husband', 'Virgil', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'been', 'blind', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'toddler', 'Whose', 'only', 'memory', 'sight', 'fluffy', 'pink', 'cloud', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'someone', 'memories', 'sight', 'have', 'sight', 'fully', 'restored', 'When', 'Virgil', 'Amy', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'fall', 'love', 'world', 'ice', 'skate', 'frozen', 'pond', 'family', 'guide', 'dog', 'Then', 'wanting', 'help', 'get', 'more', 'life', 'tells', 'doctor', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'who', 'can', 'hopefully', 'restore', 'sight', 'So', 'much', 'encouragement', 'world', 'city', 'see', 'doctor', 'Amy', 'shock', 'when', 'sight', 'restored', 'not', 'happy', 'new', 'world', 'sight', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'imagined', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'could', 'not', 'identify', 'object', 'as', 'simple', 'can', 'coke', 'felt', 'hands', 'then', 'understood', 'connection', 'two', 'Living', 'blind', 'man', '12', 'years', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'adjusting', 'somewhat', 'enjoy', 'newly', 'found', 'sight', 'can', 'trouble', 'coping', 'new', 'trials', 'very', 'educated', 'can', 'not', 'read', ""n't"", 'have', 'blindness', 'explain', 'why', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'accurate', 'movie', 'dealing', 'blindness', 'sight', 'restored', 'well', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'did', 'well', 'portraying', 'blind', 'man', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'learned', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'different', 'blind', 'people', 'go', 'have', 'known', 'many', 'husband', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'admire', 'strength', 'courage', 'abilities', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'very', 'nice', 'story', 'would', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'again']",At First Sight VHS

When her character is sad, you feel. When she's joyful, you smile. These are the qualties of a  first rank movie actress, and they are nearly enough to salvage this film.  Such is her perfection, I spent much of the film wondering what her  character saw in the limited dimwit played by Val Kilmer as the blind man  who regains his sight.  I know that Kevin Spacey can't be in every drama,  but how does Kilmer keep finding lead roles? His acting through emotionless  introspection is Steven Wright without the hilarity.Then there is the  plot. The problem is that this is a movie and movies demand a three act  structure; movies demand building conflicts, obstacles overcome, bad guys,  and a tidy ending. Since this film was based on an original &quot;real  story&quot;, which probably had no resemblance to a movie plot, one was  bolted on. Thus the Kelly McGillis character intent on keeping her brother  blind and dependent, Sorvino's insane attraction to her jerk ex-husband,  Sorvino's discovery that she'd rather be a sculptor than an architect, and  Kilmer's dealing with his deadbeat dad; all very artificial.So my advice  is rent it, don't own it; and hope Ms. Sorvino finds better material to  showcase her enormous ability.",3,I can't dislike a Mira Sorvino film,926208000,"05 9, 1999",1999,1350,"['best', 'thing', 'film', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'warm', 'intelligent', 'beautiful', 'approachable', 'way', 'When', 'character', 'sad', 'feel', 'When', 'joyful', 'smile', 'are', 'qualties', 'first', 'rank', 'movie', 'actress', 'are', 'nearly', 'enough', 'salvage', 'film', 'Such', 'perfection', 'spent', 'much', 'film', 'wondering', 'what', 'character', 'saw', 'limited', 'dimwit', 'played', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'blind', 'man', 'who', 'sight', 'know', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'drama', 'how', 'Kilmer', 'keep', 'finding', 'lead', 'roles', 'acting', 'emotionless', 'introspection', 'Steven', 'Wright', 'hilarity.Then', 'plot', 'problem', 'movie', 'movies', 'demand', 'three', 'act', 'structure', 'movies', 'demand', 'building', 'conflicts', 'overcome', 'bad', 'guys', 'tidy', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'original', 'quot', 'real', 'story', 'quot', 'probably', 'had', 'resemblance', 'movie', 'plot', 'one', 'was', 'bolted', 'Thus', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'character', 'intent', 'keeping', 'brother', 'blind', 'dependent', 'Sorvino', 'insane', 'attraction', 'jerk', 'ex-husband', 'Sorvino', 'discovery', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'sculptor', 'architect', 'Kilmer', 'dealing', 'deadbeat', 'dad', 'very', 'artificial.So', 'advice', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'hope', 'Ms.', 'Sorvino', 'better', 'material', 'showcase', 'enormous', 'ability']",At First Sight VHS

502220,A1XFMT7QS5K4KE,B00000IBKY,"Peter Beyer ""Peter Beyer""","[5, 7]","Between the tear-jerking excesses of two of the Christmas season's biggest movies, Patch Adams and Stepmom,you'd think that even the staunchest fans of those caring-and-sharing medical weepers would have reached their limit. But here comes At First Sight,which is not quite so life-and- death, but it's just as determined, in its modest way, to milk those tear ducts dry. In this case, though, the scientific context of the movie -- about a blind man who regains his sight with unexpected repercussions -- makes for a subject considerably more interesting than the romantic drama to which it is attached.At First Sight is based on the writings of neurologist Oliver Sacks (the movie Awakenings was adapted from his work as well). It tells the true story of a 50-year- old blind man named Virgil who works as a YMCA masseur. On the eve of his wedding, he has cataracts removed, which allows him to see for the first time in 40 years. The experience, however, turns out to be more painful than joyful. As Sacks notes, the questions raised are profound, and have interested philosophers from John Locke to George Berkeley. Is sight a learned activity? What is the relationship between a world understood through touch and one understood through sight?The basic facts have been moulded into a trite romance that could easily fit between a pair of Harlequin covers. Unfortunately, the film glosses over the science and deliberately avoids some of the odder aspects of the original case. Virgil, on gaining his sight, also managed to pack on about 50 pounds; stress made him eat. Somehow, though, you don't expect a star of Val Kilmer's magnitude to take the Raging Bull route to character authenticity through poundage.Instead, what we have is a story of a woman who discovers the perfect man, almost loses him, and then regains him. Mira Sorvino plays Amy Benic, a hot-shot New York architect, who heads off for a spa weekend in a charming New England village. Before she knows it, a hunky masseur has her calf muscles in his hands and has her melting like warm butter under his probing fingers. Entranced, she returns for further rubdowns until one day she approaches Mr. Magic Fingers as he's getting on a bus and discovers -- omigod! -- he's blind.After a brief Internet search, Amy discovers that Virgil doesn't necessarily have to be blind, and she lands a top surgeon (Bruce Davison) to cure the problem. It turns out that Virgil is a bit reluctant, and his sister Jennie (Kelly McGillis) is downright hostile to the idea of improving her brother's lot. Love wins, though, and Virgil agrees to undergo the treatment. Soon, Virgil and Amy are sharing her New York apartment. But Virgil, who has accommodated himself quite well as a blind man, is now a very inadequate sighted man, who can't read or write or interpret even the most basic social signals. He's miserable trying to learn how to see again, and the relationship goes into a tailspin.Much of the dialogue, during these dreary lovers' quarrels, focuses on blindness in love and living with one's blind spots and limitations (she has a too-symbolic chunk of unfinished sculpture she started in college). Nathan Lane pops up in the role of a wise and funny counsellor, the sort of part that usually goes to Robin Williams. ""Isn't seeing wonderful,"" he says to Virgil, when he takes him to a strip club. ""Seeing sucks,"" says a disconsolate Virgil. Roll over, George Berkeley, and tell John Locke the news.Director Irwin Winkler (Night and the City)is rarely better than pedestrian in handling this story. At worst, the dramatic elements are plain clumsy.The most interesting moments in At First Sight have nothing to do with the love story, but rise instead from Virgil's struggles with the social rules of seeing. What do facial expressions mean? How do we learn to look away from the homeless? There are a few moments that try to capture Virgil's viewpoint -- lights, glare, moving shapes -- that are as useful as anything the movie has to say about the conventions of seeing. Given the rich visual opportunities of such a topic, it seems a great waste the movie wasn't directed by someone with a more astute eye.

If you watch this movie on the surface, you may actually agree with some of the other reviews. If you look deeper into the story, this is about two people who awaken from a sleep. One from blindness and the other from unawareness.Amy (Mira Sorvino) has a stressful job and seeks refuge at a spa. There she meets Virgil (Val Kilmer) who not only helps her relax, he helps her view the world differently. Amy becomes very attracted to Virgil. His blindness is not a barrier between them because they find that they relate to one another on a much deeper level.Amy wants Virgil to try to regain his site and miraculously his site is restored. The only question is....how long will it last?This movie deals with some deep issues which I rarely see brought to the screen. We rarely look up at the sky in our busy lives. We take so much for granted. What this movie succeeds in doing is making you realize how much there is in your life to truly be grateful for. Mira Sorvino is such a delightful actress and it was a treat to see Val Kilmer in a romantic movie. I think romance suits them both.You will cry for most of the movie. It is really emotional. Sometimes you want to feel deeply and sometimes you want to laugh. This movie will make you feel as deeply as any movie can.The next time it rains, close your eyes and listen.

Now I didn't look too closely at the credits to see if the screenplay  was written by a former member of President Richard Nixon's 72' campaign,  but the &quot;dirty tricks&quot; they pull off would even impress him. I  won't give you any more details except to say that I loved the park  encounter scene with Tcheky Karyo and his follow-up explanation to Kelly  Preston...one of the funniest scenes you will ever see.If you are  wondering how do you keep a movie like this going for two hours...well  don't worry, they do it and you are glad they did.

502224,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00000IBKY,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 1]","""At First Sight"" is based on the true story of a man who was blind for nearly his entire life due to cataracts and retinitis pigmentosa before having his sight temporarily restored. Based on an essay by British neurologist Oliver Sacks (who also penned Awakenings), the film follows stressed-out New York architect Amy (Mira Sorvino) as she attempts to ""relax"" at a weekend spa retreat. At the reception desk, she frowns at the list of activities and settles on daily massages instead. At her first session, she meets Virgil (Val Kilmer), a man with a truly magic touch. To her embarrassment, Amy breaks down crying as someone actually takes the time to touch her for the first time in a long time. Virgil, blind since childhood, excels as a massage therapist and enjoys hockey. Sensitive, constantly smiling and outgoing, he doesn't view blindness as a disability. Amy and Virgil begin seeing each other, but his prickly, overprotective sister Jennie keeps reminding her of Virgil's limitations as a blind man.When Amy returns to New York and finds a doctor that is a pioneer in restoring vision, she urges Virgil to consider having the operation. This is the start of a very honest and painful dialog between Virgil, Jennie, and Amy; as a child, Virgil was subjected to every manner of faith healing in an attempt to cure his blindness. The remainder of the film deals with the aftermath of the surgery and the strain that Virgil's newfound sight places on his and Amy's relationship. After being blind for decades, Virgil's brain is unable to cope with the new flood of visual input, and he is only able to ""see"" by touch for the first few days. It's a refreshing twist on Hollywood portrayals of narrators succumbing to blindness and the sentiment of ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" Instead, director Irwin Winkler and the gorgeous cinematography by John Seale paint Virgil's world of darkness in terms of touch, sound (the gorgeous rainstorm that allows Virgil to ""see"" Amy putsDaredevil (Director's Cut)'s CGI rain effect to shame!!) and smell (Virgil initially describes Amy as smelling like cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, to which his sister says it sounds like he's describing a coffeecake). His post-op world is one of blurry, super-saturated colors, sudden movements, and confusion, and similar to Asperger's Syndrome, Virgil has to learn to ""read"" facial expressions and visual cues.Winkler deftly balances the romantic story with the medical one, although the film feels a touch long and could have benefitted from some editing (I wasn't crazy about Nathan Lane's cameo, although I love him in other films such asThe Birdcage). Kilmer handles pre- and post-op Val with tenderness and insight; as a blind man, he relies on his other senses like touch and hearing to guide him, but sight proves more treacherous and difficult than living in a familiar world of darkness. Sorvino's Amy was sweet and supportive, although at times she has difficulty understanding why Virgil would choose his old life over his new one.  The beautiful visual metaphors and the love theme ""Love Is Where You Are"" by Diana Krall only add to the tender appeal of ""At First Sight.""",4,Seeing is believing,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,3180,"['First', 'Sight', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'blind', 'nearly', 'entire', 'life', 'due', 'cataracts', 'retinitis', 'pigmentosa', 'having', 'sight', 'temporarily', 'restored', 'Based', 'essay', 'British', 'neurologist', 'Oliver', 'Sacks', 'who', 'also', 'penned', 'Awakenings', 'film', 'stressed-out', 'New', 'York', 'architect', 'Amy', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'relax', 'weekend', 'spa', 'retreat', 'reception', 'desk', 'list', 'activities', 'settles', 'daily', 'massages', 'instead', 'first', 'session', 'Virgil', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'man', 'truly', 'magic', 'touch', 'embarrassment', 'Amy', 'down', 'crying', 'someone', 'actually', 'time', 'touch', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'Virgil', 'blind', 'childhood', 'excels', 'massage', 'therapist', 'hockey', 'Sensitive', 'constantly', 'smiling', 'outgoing', ""n't"", 'view', 'blindness', 'disability', 'Amy', 'Virgil', 'begin', 'seeing', 'other', 'prickly', 'overprotective', 'sister', 'Jennie', 'reminding', 'Virgil', 'limitations', 'blind', 'man.When', 'Amy', 'New', 'York', 'doctor', 'pioneer', 'restoring', 'vision', 'Virgil', 'consider', 'having', 'operation', 'start', 'very', 'honest', 'painful', 'dialog', 'Virgil', 'Jennie', 'Amy', 'child', 'Virgil', 'was', 'subjected', 'manner', 'faith', 'healing', 'attempt', 'cure', 'blindness', 'remainder', 'film', 'deals', 'aftermath', 'surgery', 'strain', 'Virgil', 'newfound', 'sight', 'places', 'Amy', 'relationship', 'being', 'blind', 'decades', 'Virgil', 'brain', 'unable', 'cope', 'new', 'flood', 'visual', 'input', 'only', 'able', 'see', 'touch', 'first', 'few', 'days', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'Hollywood', 'portrayals', 'narrators', 'succumbing', 'blindness', 'sentiment', 'Rage', 'rage', 'dying', 'light', 'Instead', 'director', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Seale', 'paint', 'Virgil', 'world', 'darkness', 'terms', 'touch', 'sound', 'gorgeous', 'rainstorm', 'Virgil', 'see', 'Amy', 'putsDaredevil', 'Director', 'Cut', 'CGI', 'rain', 'effect', 'shame', 'smell', 'Virgil', 'initially', 'Amy', 'smelling', 'cinnamon', 'nutmeg', 'vanilla', 'sister', 'describing', 'coffeecake', 'post-op', 'world', 'one', 'blurry', 'super-saturated', 'colors', 'sudden', 'movements', 'confusion', 'similar', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'Virgil', 'learn', 'read', 'facial', 'expressions', 'visual', 'cues.Winkler', 'deftly', 'romantic', 'story', 'medical', 'one', 'film', 'touch', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'editing', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'cameo', 'love', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'asThe', 'Birdcage', 'Kilmer', 'pre-', 'post-op', 'Val', 'tenderness', 'insight', 'blind', 'man', 'other', 'senses', 'touch', 'hearing', 'guide', 'sight', 'proves', 'more', 'treacherous', 'difficult', 'living', 'familiar', 'world', 'darkness', 'Sorvino', 'Amy', 'was', 'sweet', 'supportive', 'times', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'why', 'Virgil', 'would', 'choose', 'old', 'life', 'new', 'one', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'metaphors', 'love', 'theme', 'Love', 'Where', 'Are', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'only', 'tender', 'appeal', 'First', 'Sight']",At First Sight VHS

I did not go to see this at the theater becuase I thought it would be a normal boring love story, now I think differently. The best things in the films is the story, very drama and inspiring and sexy. Moods and tones of the whole story is welled-done excepted that it seems too rush with lots of story to tell in 1.30 hours. I think this movie is as good as &quot;When harry met Sally&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in seattles&quot;, &quot;Great expectation&quot; and &quot;How to make a american quilts&quot;, if you are into this kind of movies. It's stranger that this movie did not do well and fews people know of this. They don't even put special features in the DVD. I was hoping for the deleted scences.

502227,AXKWFTTW5OGJ7,B00000IBKY,"TCG ""playboy2196@yahoo.com""","[0, 1]","Irwin Winkler's AT FIRST SIGHT, ostensibly based upon a true story, begins promisingly as an affecting romance that soon takes a turn into sappy Hollywood &quot;feel good&quot; territory, which is a shame considering the  caliber of the performances and the man in the director's seat.  Mira  Sorvino is quite wonderful as a woman who falls in love with a blind  masseur, played with commendable plausibility by Val Kilmer.  Kilmer has  been blind since the age of one, and reluctantly agrees to undergo an  operation at Sorvino's suggestion that may restore his sight.  The big  question is, will their romance weather the emotional storm ahead?  Does  the audience know?  Does the audience care?Despite the film's nearly  130-minute running time, the story feels rushed.  An hour should have been  devoted to Sorvino and Kilmer's budding romance and allowing the audience  to take emotional stock of their situation, with the second hour focusing  on the complications that ensue following the operation.  For a theatrical  treatment, it all feels so &quot;Movie-of-the-Weekish&quot;.  Both Kilmer  and Sorvino are accomplished performers, and quite frankly they deserved  better.  The biggest problem lies with the script.  The characters are not  three-dimensional, and everyone says what they mean (yeah, right - just  like in reality), and if they don't someone else says it for them.  Nothing  is left up to the audience, it's merely presented to us.  A story like this  requires far more complexity and emotional depth.  One gets the impression  the film was rushed or taken away from the director during post-production.One can only wonder how this story would have fared under the cinematic  microscopic scrutiny of Atom Egoyan.",2,Artistic Myopia Prevails in Disappointing Drama,952819200,"03 12, 2000",2000,1738,"['Irwin', 'Winkler', 'AT', 'FIRST', 'SIGHT', 'ostensibly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'promisingly', 'affecting', 'romance', 'soon', 'turn', 'sappy', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'feel', 'good', 'quot', 'territory', 'shame', 'considering', 'caliber', 'performances', 'man', 'director', 'seat', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'blind', 'masseur', 'played', 'commendable', 'plausibility', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Kilmer', 'been', 'blind', 'age', 'one', 'reluctantly', 'undergo', 'operation', 'Sorvino', 'suggestion', 'may', 'restore', 'sight', 'big', 'question', 'will', 'romance', 'emotional', 'storm', 'ahead', 'audience', 'know', 'audience', 'care', 'film', 'nearly', '130-minute', 'running', 'time', 'story', 'feels', 'rushed', 'hour', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'Sorvino', 'Kilmer', 'budding', 'romance', 'allowing', 'audience', 'take', 'emotional', 'stock', 'situation', 'second', 'hour', 'focusing', 'complications', 'ensue', 'following', 'operation', 'theatrical', 'treatment', 'feels', 'so', 'quot', 'Movie-of-the-Weekish', 'quot', 'Kilmer', 'Sorvino', 'are', 'accomplished', 'performers', 'quite', 'frankly', 'deserved', 'better', 'biggest', 'problem', 'script', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'three-dimensional', 'everyone', 'what', 'mean', 'yeah', 'right', 'just', 'reality', 'do', ""n't"", 'someone', 'else', 'Nothing', 'left', 'up', 'audience', 'merely', 'presented', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'complexity', 'emotional', 'depth', 'One', 'impression', 'film', 'was', 'rushed', 'taken', 'away', 'director', 'post-production.One', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'cinematic', 'microscopic', 'scrutiny', 'Atom', 'Egoyan']",At First Sight VHS
502228,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00000IBKY,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","&quot;At First Sight&quot; delivers the basics of romantic story, but takes too long time to tell its story, so you might want to cut the tape of your own copy to make its running time much shorter.  Fortunately, the two leads are very likable characters (and the film credits tell us it is based on a true story), and the chances are you never feel wasted your time.It's about blind Virgil (Val Kilmer), who loves hockey-playing, and New Yorker Amy (Mira Sorvino), who meets Vigil at a hotel, and falls in love with him.  As she found an article on the  possibility of restoring sight, she suggests he take the chance (actually, the film tells that very few people had ragained their sight after long time of blindness).  The operation succeeds, but it turns out much harder than he expected for Virgil to handle the situation with the newly given power of sight.  For example, he cannot tell an real apple from a picture of an apple; or he cannot feel the distance between him and what he sees, so things coming in his direction would inevitably hit him in the head.  Now he had to learn &quot;seeing.&quot;  The story is very good.However, the script is too uneven.  We don't need any episodes about Amy's ex-husband; though as Virgil's sister Kelly McGillis shows good performance, she sometimes delays the speed of the film, and seems to tell us too obvious things about Virgil's life.  And most of all, the film is making a potentially tragic nature of the original story too sentimental.  But as I said before, Kilmer and Sorvino both make such an amiable couple that you may forgive these shortcomings as the film goes on.  And wait for always reliable Nethan Lane as a slightly eccentric therapist.  He never fails to deliver the good moment though this time a little short.  &quot;At First Sight&quot; is an agreeable (though overlong) film.If you're interested in the medical aspect of the film. read Dr. Oliver Sachs's book &quot;An Anthoropologist on Mars.&quot;  The film's material originally comes from one of its seven tales called 'To See and Not See.'",3,Thought-Provoking Story with Good Cast and Overlong Script,1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,2070,"['quot', 'First', 'Sight', 'quot', 'basics', 'romantic', 'story', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'might', 'want', 'cut', 'tape', 'own', 'copy', 'make', 'running', 'time', 'much', 'shorter', 'Fortunately', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'characters', 'film', 'credits', 'tell', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'chances', 'are', 'never', 'feel', 'wasted', 'time.It', 'blind', 'Virgil', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'who', 'hockey-playing', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Amy', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'who', 'Vigil', 'hotel', 'love', 'found', 'article', 'possibility', 'restoring', 'sight', 'take', 'chance', 'actually', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'had', 'ragained', 'sight', 'long', 'time', 'blindness', 'operation', 'out', 'much', 'harder', 'expected', 'Virgil', 'handle', 'situation', 'newly', 'given', 'power', 'sight', 'example', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'real', 'apple', 'picture', 'apple', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'distance', 'what', 'things', 'coming', 'direction', 'would', 'inevitably', 'hit', 'head', 'Now', 'had', 'learn', 'quot', 'seeing.', 'quot', 'story', 'very', 'good.However', 'script', 'too', 'uneven', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'episodes', 'Amy', 'ex-husband', 'Virgil', 'sister', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'good', 'performance', 'sometimes', 'speed', 'film', 'tell', 'too', 'obvious', 'things', 'Virgil', 'life', 'most', 'film', 'making', 'potentially', 'tragic', 'nature', 'original', 'story', 'too', 'sentimental', 'said', 'Kilmer', 'Sorvino', 'make', 'amiable', 'couple', 'may', 'forgive', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'wait', 'always', 'reliable', 'Nethan', 'Lane', 'slightly', 'eccentric', 'therapist', 'never', 'deliver', 'good', 'moment', 'time', 'little', 'short', 'quot', 'First', 'Sight', 'quot', 'agreeable', 'overlong', 'film.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'medical', 'aspect', 'film', 'read', 'Dr.', 'Oliver', 'Sachs', 'book', 'quot', 'Anthoropologist', 'Mars.', 'quot', 'film', 'material', 'originally', 'one', 'seven', 'tales', 'called', ""'To"", 'See', 'Not', 'See']",At First Sight VHS
