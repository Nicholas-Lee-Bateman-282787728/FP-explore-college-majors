1437249,A2HUYUQM5S1SRZ,B0051QS1OA,"James Schaller ""Physician""","[4, 13]","Many locations like Collier County/Naples Florida have arrest mills, the ""prosecution work"" is lazy, sloppy, inept and the criminal judges are obviously too old and neurologically impaired to function.Other areas can prosecute due to abusive police questioning of weak people with an IQ of 80, who will crumble like paper under sadistic treats--watch it on ese DVD's-it is not my word.Other locations in N. America overvalue eye witness reporting including child reporting which is easily undermined and limited as shown in this collection.These cases show how scholarly justice groups like THE INNOCENCE PROJECT fix ""hunting"" detective errors, with real scientists and careful thinking.What did every innocent person say when released? ""I always thought the police were around to protect me and were good people."" IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE REAITY OF MY COMMENTS--GROW UP--LIBERTY IN THE USA-THE TOP JAILOR OF THE WORLD IS DEAD.Read a police magazine, and see they are the military inside the USA and the only praise is arrest numbers.OLD TIME USA 50'S VALUES ARE DEAD FOREVER. AMERICA WILL NEVER BE FREE AS IT WAS IN THE PAST. THE MONEY NEEDED FROM MANY WEEKLY ARRESTS HELPS PAY OUR 300 MILLION SHERIFF BUDGET, AND WE DO NOT NEED A SHERIFF ON EVERY BLOCK. 25% ARE The BEST LIARS ON REPORTS AND ARE WORSE THAN THE CRIMINALS THEY ARREST. AND THEY HAVE FAILED TO STOP SAVAGE BULLIES EVEN WITH CAMERAS AND SHERIFFS INSIDE SCHOOLS.USA LIBERTY IS DROPPING AND MANY OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS ARE GONE--FOREVER.In Naples you are punished if you have a trial. The God of Naples is money, and so impaired judges punish you for a trial. FLORIDA IS SO DEEP SOUTH, PEOPLE FEEL GEORGIA IS FREE AND FOLLOWS CAREFUL LAW BETTER. WHEN YOU ARE WORSE THAN GEORGIA WHAT ELSE CAN BE SAID?",5,You are one annoyed sheriff or lazy AG from big jail time--REAL WORLD VS.

1437254,A3UIBKQBKF0PKV,B0051QS1OA,"Jonathan Turbide ""The Investigator""","[3, 4]","Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every 22 minutes episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.The episodes you'll find on this set all address different cases where science helped exonerate a convicted person. All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:1. Accident Or Murder: A woman's body was found at the bottom of the basement stairs. Police initially believed that she died as a result of an accidental fall, but when officials learn that her husband had taken out a life insurance policy on her shortly before she died, they knew they had their killer. When an investigator recreates the fall, the results are surprising.2. All Butt Certain: A six-year-old girl ran and hid when she saw her grandmother being beaten to death, but the man followed her, beat her, and assaulted her. The girl said the man was her Uncle Clarence, and he was convicted because of her identification. His wife was convinced he was innocent, and decided to conduct her own investigation to prove it.3. Forever Hold Your Peace: Two men confess to a murder that took place behind a restaurant and are sentenced to a life in prison. Eight years later, another man, who sentenced for an unrelated crime, claims responsibility. Who really did it?4. Freedom Fighter: A county social worker is murdered and her home set on fire. Bite marks are used to convict a man who had threatened people in her office. The man, Roy Brown, protests his innocence, and spends 15 years in jail finding the real killer.5. Grave Evidence: The shooting of a man during a hunting trip is reopened years after the incident, and the victim's hunting partner becomes a suspect.6. Man's Best Friend?: The case of John Miller and Debbie Loveless is related. In 1989, they reported to police the death of their 4-year-old daughter, who they claimed was attacked by dogs. The authorities, however, believed the girl died from knife wounds and charged them with murder. Five years after their convictions, forensic evidence proved that their initial story was the truth.7. Once Bitten: An examination of the case of Ray Krone, who was wrongly convicted of the December 1991 murder of an Arizona bartender.8. Plastic Fire: Police say that a car crash, which killed an elderly woman, was murder and arson. The driver, the victom's daughter, insisted it was an accident. Two fire investigators came to two entirely different conclusions. Was it an accident... or murder?9. A Shot in the Dark: When a woman is found dead of a gunshot wound, police conclude that she was murdered by her husband. Forensic scientists were able to piece together the clues and determine what really happened. In doing so, they proved once again that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.10. Where The Blood Drops: When a Texas car dealer was found shot to death in his bed, it initially looked like a suicide. But a closer examination of the evidence convinced investigators the man had been murdered in cold blood. A decade would pass, and a family would be ripped apart before a jury rendered final judgement on what really happened.11. Within a Hair: In 1996, a serial rapist preyed on women, both young and old, in South Bend, Indiana. Eventually, three victoms identified the same man as the perpetrator. But what happens when forensic evidence points to one man, while the victoms are pointing to another?12. Within Arm's Reach: A police officer and his estranged wife have a fight in their bedroom. A shotgun goes off. He says it was suicide, investigators said it was murder. It took ballistics, a last will, and the physics of a shot-cup petal to tell what really happened in the bedroom that day.",4,12 Interesting Cases ( Full Listing ),1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,4182,"['Forensic', 'Files', 'American', 'documentary-style', 'series', 'how', 'forensic', 'science', 'used', 'solve', 'violent', 'crimes', 'mysterious', 'accidents', 'even', 'outbreaks', 'illness', 'show', 'whodunit', 'approach', 'making', 'case', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', '22', 'minutes', 'episode', 'one', 'case', 'initial', 'investigation', 'conviction', 'acquittal', 'other', 'legal', 'resolution', 'Pathologists', 'medical', 'examiners', 'police', 'officers', 'detectives', 'prosecutors', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'friends', 'families', 'victims', 'sometimes', 'even', 'suspects', 'are', 'interviewed', 'roles.The', ""'ll"", 'find', 'set', 'address', 'different', 'cases', 'where', 'science', 'helped', 'exonerate', 'convicted', 'person', '12', 'investigations', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'Here', 'are', '12', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'set:1', 'Accident', 'Murder', 'woman', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'bottom', 'basement', 'stairs', 'Police', 'initially', 'believed', 'died', 'result', 'accidental', 'fall', 'when', 'officials', 'learn', 'husband', 'had', 'taken', 'out', 'life', 'insurance', 'policy', 'shortly', 'died', 'knew', 'had', 'killer', 'When', 'investigator', 'fall', 'results', 'are', 'surprising.2', 'Butt', 'Certain', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'ran', 'hid', 'when', 'saw', 'grandmother', 'being', 'beaten', 'death', 'man', 'followed', 'beat', 'assaulted', 'girl', 'said', 'man', 'was', 'Uncle', 'Clarence', 'was', 'convicted', 'identification', 'wife', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'innocent', 'decided', 'conduct', 'own', 'investigation', 'prove', 'it.3', 'Forever', 'Hold', 'Peace', 'Two', 'men', 'confess', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'restaurant', 'are', 'sentenced', 'life', 'prison', 'Eight', 'years', 'later', 'man', 'who', 'sentenced', 'unrelated', 'crime', 'responsibility', 'Who', 'really', 'did', '4', 'Freedom', 'Fighter', 'county', 'social', 'worker', 'murdered', 'home', 'set', 'fire', 'Bite', 'marks', 'are', 'used', 'convict', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'threatened', 'people', 'office', 'man', 'Roy', 'Brown', 'innocence', '15', 'years', 'jail', 'finding', 'real', 'killer.5', 'Grave', 'Evidence', 'shooting', 'man', 'hunting', 'trip', 'reopened', 'years', 'incident', 'victim', 'hunting', 'partner', 'suspect.6', 'Man', 'Best', 'Friend', 'case', 'John', 'Miller', 'Debbie', 'Loveless', 'related', '1989', 'reported', 'police', 'death', '4-year-old', 'daughter', 'who', 'claimed', 'was', 'attacked', 'dogs', 'authorities', 'however', 'believed', 'girl', 'died', 'knife', 'wounds', 'charged', 'murder', 'Five', 'years', 'convictions', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'proved', 'initial', 'story', 'was', 'truth.7', 'Once', 'Bitten', 'examination', 'case', 'Ray', 'Krone', 'who', 'was', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'December', '1991', 'murder', 'Arizona', 'bartender.8', 'Plastic', 'Fire', 'Police', 'say', 'car', 'crash', 'killed', 'elderly', 'woman', 'was', 'murder', 'arson', 'driver', 'victom', 'daughter', 'insisted', 'was', 'accident', 'Two', 'fire', 'investigators', 'came', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'conclusions', 'Was', 'accident', 'murder', '9', 'Shot', 'Dark', 'When', 'woman', 'found', 'dead', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'police', 'conclude', 'was', 'murdered', 'husband', 'Forensic', 'scientists', 'were', 'able', 'piece', 'together', 'clues', 'determine', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'doing', 'so', 'proved', 'once', 'again', 'truth', 'sometimes', 'stranger', 'fiction.10', 'Where', 'Blood', 'Drops', 'When', 'Texas', 'car', 'dealer', 'was', 'found', 'shot', 'death', 'bed', 'initially', 'looked', 'suicide', 'closer', 'examination', 'evidence', 'convinced', 'investigators', 'man', 'had', 'been', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'decade', 'would', 'pass', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'ripped', 'apart', 'jury', 'rendered', 'final', 'judgement', 'what', 'really', 'happened.11', 'Hair', '1996', 'serial', 'rapist', 'preyed', 'women', 'young', 'old', 'South', 'Bend', 'Indiana', 'Eventually', 'three', 'victoms', 'identified', 'same', 'man', 'perpetrator', 'what', 'when', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'points', 'one', 'man', 'victoms', 'are', 'pointing', '12', 'Arm', 'Reach', 'police', 'officer', 'estranged', 'wife', 'have', 'fight', 'bedroom', 'shotgun', 'off', 'was', 'suicide', 'investigators', 'said', 'was', 'murder', 'took', 'ballistics', 'last', 'will', 'physics', 'shot-cup', 'petal', 'tell', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'bedroom', 'day']",Forensic Files: Convictions Overturned
