708743,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B00006ADEO,AIROLF,"[1, 1]","A light-hearted comedy about a pair of English aristocrats forced to rent out their estate to an American band and pose as their servants. This is a vehicle solely for the enhancement of Peter O'Toole and no one else. Alicia Silverstone is completely underused, with her supporting role barely a bit more than a cameo; it could've been anyone else in that role and the movie would've still been the same.

This is such a good find I can't resist doing it.I hessitate to call the sounds the rock band make music, but generosity compels it.  You, hopefully will enjoy it because there is a lot here--more than necessary.  Even it can't detract from this very funny and charming movie.  With O'Toole it is assured.A very stiff Lord and his lady, strapped for cash, rent their mansion to this country's most famous rock band annonymously.  To keep it secret the butler and cook are sent on holiday.  Time runs out and the group's arrival is immenent, but they are still without staff, so the lord must assume duties of the butler while his lady acts as cook.

The DVD was unavailable for several years - but now we are lucky to have this rockingly fun story in our living rooms!  Starring Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright, Lord and Lady of an English manor house with a gallery filled with paintings of ancestors, are forced to rent out the manor, but can't find the servants, so take on the role themselves, relucantly indeed by Lord Foxley, masquerading as servants, Peter O'Toole playing the off-beat, and quite humorous role with grace and style--and occasional outsburts of temper.  Imagine Lord and Lady Foxley's surprise when they discover they are renting the manor to a ROCK BAND! Alicia Silverstone charmingly plays their lead singer, hired by the boys in the band to fill in for their missing star.

708754,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B00006ADEO,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 2]","I first saw this movie years ago but I remember I didn't finish it because it was so bad. I decided to recently give it another chance since it was on television and I should have stayed away. This movie saddened me because it was so unbelievably funky and I mean that as in stinky. This movie was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen in my life. It was horrible. The acting stunk, the humor was nonexistent, the writing pathetic, the plot predictable and it had more holes in it than a cheese grater. The film also seemed to be filmed on a budget of 100 dollars or less.The reason I found it sad the most was because of Alicia Silverstone. I was a big fan of Alicia's back in the 90's when she was one of the hottest actresses around. It was pitiful seeing her in something like this and all I could think about was how fast she faded from super stardom.As the movie went on I kept wondering and asking myself why in the world Alicia would be in this crap? I know the mighty has fallen but this was pathetic. This movie would've been horrible if anyone was in it but it was sad to see Alicia waste the talent she has left on this. But I guess beggers can't be choosers.I will forever be an Alicia fan and for those who don't remember her glory days, please do not watch this and make a decision about Alicia based on this grotesque film. If you really wanna see Alicia in something decent then check out her older films. Even Excess Baggage was better than this. You can also catch her in various co-starring roles since this movie and they are well worth it compared to this crud.The music wasn't even good. Nothing about this film was redeemable. Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright were the best things about this film. At least they were half funny. Everyone else was...sad. Just sad. This movie should have never been made.Skip at all costs or if you must see it, wait until it comes on television. This film isn't worth buying from the dollar bin.Rock my world? Really?

708755,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00006ADEO,Only-A-Child,"[9, 9]","""Global Heresy"" a/k/a ""Rock My World"" is an odd little ($12 Million) production that was incorrectly marketed as another ""Spinal Tap"". I've seen ""Spinal Tap"" and this is no ......... But what it lacks in comedy it makes up in unpretentious charm.You wonder what idiot determines the target audience for these productions. With Alicia Silverstone posed in tight silver pants on the poster, they tried unsuccessfully to market it to Gen X viewers; but Alicia has at best a small supporting role and never appears in the pictured outfit so it is no surprise that it did not catch on with that demographic. Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright play the two main characters and they are unlikely to attract young viewers. Baby boomers are the audience most likely to connect with the film, despite a cast that is a mix of actors older and younger than that group. But boomers are the real rock fans and are old enough to appreciate the subtle script and the underplayed performances of O'Toole and Plowright. Too bad it was not originally marketed to that group.The original ill-conceived title refers to the name of an American rock band whose founder has disappeared and is feared dead. Needing time to integrate his replacement (bass player Silverstone) into the group, their management company rents an English estate from the impoverished Lord and Lady Foxley where they can secretly rework their material. The couple finds out that they can make even more money by impersonating the servants. Much the same premise as ""High Spirits"", where O'Toole rented his haunted Irish castle to tourists.The band members like to party but are basically likable young people and their music is actually pretty good. O'Toole's character starts out as a Lionel Barrymore type curmudgeon but eventually loosens up (big surprise). The two disparate groups learn a lot from each other and the film almost crosses the line into sappy city. Fortunately Plowright manages to hold things together with a performance that nicely grounds things and makes the whole concept seem plausible.On the plus side the film was nicely shot and has an overall great look to it. And there is a nice bit of misdirection concerning the record company executive that you might or might not see coming-the clues are there but you might miss them.On the minus side there is an extremely weak homage to George Roy Hill's ""Funny Farm""; instead of a speeding mailman ""Rock My World"" has a Mini driver paperboy who terrorizes O'Toole's character. This bit is not funny the first time and is repeated on countless occasions throughout the film.Bottom line, ""Rock My World"" is a good watch for boomers.Then again, what do I know?
