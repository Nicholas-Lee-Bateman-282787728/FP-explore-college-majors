1096665,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000UVKHNY,B. E Jackson,"[2, 9]","Heavens Fall is quite the predictable courtroom drama.  As someone who only likes the occasional courtroom scene with a lot of actual storytelling surrounding it... well as you can probably guess, this movie left me completely bored.  It's nothing BUT a lengthy courtroom scene, and not a particularly suspenseful one either.Furthermore, storyline-wise it does absolutely nothing you haven't already heard a million times already.  Of course a white lawyer choosing to defend a group of African Americans in Alabama during the 1930's will face heavy criticism.  It happens predictably.  Of course everyone on the jury is white and will choose to stand up for a white girl.  Remember, back then color issues were quite dominant.Nice try on the part of the writers to make women look less intelligent back then, though.  I mean that as strictly sarcasm.My biggest grip is the fact it's a courtroom drama with very little in the way of suspense, and *especially* very little in way of standing out from the countless other courtroom dramas that have been released over the years.  Only occasionally would the arguments become heated enough to catch my interest.  If it's based on a real event, well, talk about one really uninteresting event.Otherwise this is a very boring, ordinary take on the 1930 Alabama days.  Of course it's also likely that the events have been exaggerated by way of the acting from the actors and actresses.  I wasn't there (in Alabama) back in the 30's, so I wouldn't know exactly what the people were like.",2,boring,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,1530,"['Heavens', 'Fall', 'quite', 'predictable', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'someone', 'who', 'only', 'occasional', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'lot', 'actual', 'storytelling', 'surrounding', 'well', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'movie', 'left', 'completely', 'bored', 'nothing', 'BUT', 'lengthy', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'not', 'particularly', 'suspenseful', 'one', 'either.Furthermore', 'storyline-wise', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'heard', 'million', 'times', 'already', 'course', 'white', 'lawyer', 'choosing', 'defend', 'group', 'African', 'Americans', 'Alabama', '1930', 'will', 'face', 'heavy', 'criticism', 'predictably', 'course', 'everyone', 'jury', 'white', 'will', 'choose', 'stand', 'up', 'white', 'girl', 'Remember', 'back', 'then', 'color', 'issues', 'were', 'quite', 'dominant.Nice', 'try', 'part', 'writers', 'make', 'women', 'look', 'less', 'intelligent', 'back', 'then', 'mean', 'as', 'strictly', 'sarcasm.My', 'biggest', 'grip', 'fact', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'suspense', '*especially*', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'standing', 'out', 'countless', 'other', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'years', 'Only', 'occasionally', 'would', 'arguments', 'become', 'heated', 'enough', 'catch', 'interest', 'based', 'real', 'event', 'well', 'talk', 'one', 'really', 'uninteresting', 'event.Otherwise', 'very', 'boring', 'ordinary', 'take', '1930', 'Alabama', 'days', 'course', 'also', 'likely', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'exaggerated', 'way', 'acting', 'actors', 'actresses', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'Alabama', 'back', '30', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'were']",Heavens Fall

1096667,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000UVKHNY,Grady Harp,"[12, 14]","Movies such as HEAVENS FALL are poignant reminders of the cruel history of this country that still makes us bow our heads in shame.  The story by writer/director Terry Green is a sensitive recreation of the re-trial of an African American man (one of nine) condemned to death in Scottsboro, Alabama in 1931 for the supposed gang rape of two white women, a trial with an all-white seated jury who took only 20 minutes to deliberate and convict the young men.  It is a study of racism in the South in the 1930s and while the viewer would hope that the ending is triumphant, the story quietly fades with a particle decency represented by a New York trial lawyer and a sympathetic judge who opened the door to the beginnings of seated African American jurists.  It is powerful in content: it is magnificent movie making.Samuel Leibowitz (Timothy Hutton) travels to Alabama form his offices in New York in 1933, to represent the nine condemned men after a Supreme Court ruling opened the door for a retrial. Leibowitz meets the prosecuting attorney Thomas Knight, Jr. (Bill Sage), more devoted to his potential career advancement than to his role as prosecutor, and the judge assigned to the case - James Horton (David Strathairn).  Leibowitz interviews the nine condemned men and  Haywood Patterson (B.J. Britt) is the first to be re-tried. Careful investigation uncovers the shaky case that convicted the men and Leibowitz, with the aid of the attorneys who pleaded the case before the Supreme Court, attempt to gain a racially mixed jury without success. Sent to cover the trial is a young reporter from Chicago (Anthony Mackie) who witnesses the racial hatred in the South first hand.  His presence adds credibility to the proceedings.  During the trial Leibowitz calls as witnesses the two women who made the false accusations - Victoria  Price (LeeLee Sobieski) and Ruby Bates (Azura Skye) - and despite evidence clearing the nine men the trial ends in defeat. But that is only the beginning of a story that persists to this day. This is a true story about how racial hate tore the South apart in the 1930s, but it is also the story of how a few honest people tried to alter history.The cast is uniformly excellent, with Strathairn, Hutton, Skye, and Sage  giving potent performances.  The climate of the times is well captured by the cinematography of Paul Sanchez, the costumes by Lisa Davis, the fine editing by Suzy Elmiger, and the simple but effective musical score by Tony Llorens.  This is a film everyone should see, not only because of the need to re-examine this part of our history, but also because it is such a fine example of American cinema.

1096668,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000UVKHNY,Linda Linguvic,"[8, 8]","I had never heard of this film.  Indeed, it received very little publicity or theater time when it was released in 2006.  But it was on cable TV last night and I was intrigued by its theme - an historical drama of the second trial of 9 young black men (aged 12 to 19) accused of raping two white women in Scottsboro, Alabama. They were sentenced to death in 1931 but, in a case brought by the International Labor Defense organization to the Supreme Court, the sentence was overturned and a new trial was granted.  A New York lawyer, Samuel Liebowitz, joined the Labor Defense team and went down South for the retrial in 1933.  This film was about that trial.I must say I had to refrain myself from running to my computer to research the case because I wanted my experience of the film to be fresh.  I'm glad I did that because it added to the tension as I wasn't sure what the outcome would be.  The director did a good job of setting the time and the place.  The historical detail seemed perfect and the New York attorney reminded me a lot of photos of my own father in the early 1930s.  For example, all the men wore hats and shirts and ties.Most of the film took place at the trial but there was one recurring scene at a diner which showed a young black girl waiting patiently at the back door for an order of food while she is being ignored by the waitress.The Southerners are not all depicted as bad.  In this film the prosecuting attorney and the New York lawyer are staying at the same hotel.  The southern lawyer is on track to someday become Governor.  He is intrigued by the New Yorker and they sort of bond.  But then the trial begins and its no holds barred.There is also a young black newspaper reporter from Chicago who has come down South for the trial.  He has to create a petition to be permitted to sit in the courtroom.  Through his eyes we see some serious discrimination although we never really get to know any of the Scotsboro boys on trial.I loved the courtroom scenes.  I was at the edge of my seat.  What was going to happen?  Was this injustice ever going to be reconciled?  I finally found out at the end and it was only then that I researched it more deeply on my computer.This was a good film, low budget and well made.  I wish it was more widely distributed especially because it is a piece of history.",5,Great courtroom scenes!
