1129838,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00114XM04,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[8, 9]","The story of the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn certainly has enjoyed a lot of exposure lately with two years of the Showtime seriesThe Tudors - The Complete First Seasonfull swing and the 2008 Hollywood adaptation of Philippa Gregory's novel,The Other Boleyn Girl, starring Natalie Portman as the ill-fated second wife of Henry VIII now released on DVD.  With these money-generating Tudor-related vehicles generating such popularity, it comes as little surprise that an older once-televised version is now seeing the light of day. Be that as it may, I have grown weary with the actual telling of the tale in this instance.  Or perhaps the fault lies in the production quality of the 2003 BBC version of the same story crafted by Ms. Gregory in her 500+ page novel.  Whereas the Hollywood version sparkles with colorful jewel toned sets exemplifying the opulence of King Eric Bana's court and a bevy of model-esque beauties of the blonde, brunette and redhead categories statuesquely adorn the royal auspices of Jonathan Rhys Meyer's Pre-Elizabethan world, this 90 minute drama seems anemically plebian in comparison.  Ultimately, however, the main fault seems to be in the selection of the piece's main character.Although Natascha McElhone plays the part of Franoise Gilot, Picasso's live-in lover in the 1996 filmSurviving Picassowith an initial ing&eacute;nue quality that endears her to an audience anticipating her eventual seasoning as a woman, as Mary Boleyn, married sister of Anne, she fails to exude that fresh je-ne-sais-quoi that allows the Gregory character to win over her readers in spite of her human frailties.  As her work in ""Ronin"" suggests, roles that require a little Mata Hari sophistication fit well with McElhone's physical appearance.  However, despite the obvious conniving of the Boleyn family and its domino effect on its two daughters, the character of Mary requires more innocence--a quality Scarlett Johanson's lush renaissance beauty mirrors much better than McElhone's persona that exemplifies the attribute of sharp 21st century savvy.On the other hand, Jodhi May, as Anne, radiates with a charm that certainly does not originate from her looks alone.  At first glance and with the full understanding of the importance of male succession in 16th century life, we wonder how in the world someone as plain as Anne could entice a king away from his Church and his wife.  Yet, May pulls this off without a hitch, embodying the enigmatic Anne and her apparent charm from the inside out in a much more subtle manner than the acclaimed Natalie Portman.  While Portman projects the ultimate shrew in need of a spanking, only May's blazing eyes convey her wily ambition.  Buttressed by her family's desire for power, she diverts from the truth with great finesse that seems second nature.Jared Harris adequately portrays the young Henry incensed by what he cannot have.  Much more low-key than Rhys Meyer's tantrum-throwing monarch, he gives one the sense of strength and confusion that seems appropriate for his predicament as the heirless tyrant.Bottom line?  If the story of Henry VIII and his wives never fails to entertain you, than this adaptation of the Philippa Gregory novel from across the pond may keep you in your seat for its playing time of ninety minutes.  However, if you have become accustomed to the beautiful sets and people that populate the Showtime series, `The Tudors' and high profile actors that portray the same characters in Hollywood's version of ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" you will find this drab BBC presentation wanting in many ways.  The technique of having the two main characters look soulfully into the camera and confess their thoughts diary-style breaks rather than sustains the story's momentum.  Although a fully accomplished actress with a repertoire of fined performances, Natascha McElhone's Mary does not succeed in fully conveying every nuance of the character as depicted in the book.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[46, 46]","Hollywood is releasing a new adaptation of Phillipa Gregory's ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" so unsurprisingly the older BBC adaptation is also (finally) seeing the light of American day.And it's a pleasant, intimate little look at the difficult world of women in Tudor England. It's hampered by what is obviously a very low budget, but Jodhi May and Jared Harris turn in performances that knock it a few notches higher. Seriously, they're both amazing.While serving Queen Katherine, Mary Boleyn (Natascha McElhone) catches the eye of King Henry VIII (Jared Harris), and soon her scheming, power-hungry family has shoved her into his bed. Initially she's horrified and ashamed, but soon finds that she's starting to fall in love with the charming king.Meanwhile, Mary catches her sister Anne (Jodhi May) in bed with an engaged courtier, and the disgraced girl is sent away. When Anne returns, Mary is pregnant, and the Boleyn family is afraid of losing Henry's favor. But when he meets Anne, Henry immediately drops Mary, and becomes enraptured by the ambitious, frank young girl.But Anne's one mistake -- and exile -- have hardened her, and she's determined not to be the ""king's whore"" like her sister, but his wife. Amid a storm of angry protest, Henry divorces his wife and marries Anne. But when she gives birth to another daughter, her position begins to slip...""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is not an epic movie -- it's more of a Tudor chick-flick. The big issues (women's reduced rights, splitting from the Catholic Church, poor Katherine of Aragon) are pushed to the background, in favor of a more intimate look at two young women's lives.The direction is something of a hit-and-miss -- there are some lovely moments, like Mary's moment in the church when she realizes who she's in love with, or Anne's tantrum in front of the court. And Philippa Lowthorpe really gets across what a woman's life would have been like in the Tudor court, as well as the controversial idea that Anne really WAS guilty of incest. Unlikely, but interesting in fiction.But the sets and costumes look a bit low-budget for the sumptuous Tudor era -- this is glaringly obvious in Katherine's chambers, which look like they were assembled hastily on a soundstage. And for some reason, the characters keep talking to the camera as if they're in a reality show.What pulls this above ""average""? That would be the acting. McElhone gives a graceful, understated performance, but May is the real powerhouse here -- her Anne fills the screen as a vibrant, passionate young woman who is burned by her family's ambition. And Harris is simply amazing as the young Henry -- not a bloated, diseased wreck, but a charming and athletic young monarch.""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a rather mediocre TV movie that is given a massive boost by a trio of talented actors, particularly Jodhi May.

About half way through I realized my error.  This is a BBC version that was produced in 2003, obviously shot with as a tv production with all the budget and time constraints that a tv project as a opposed to a major movie implies.Although not what I expected this is an interesting telling of the original novel, even if it is not particularly faithful to that novel.  This is, of course, the probably familiar tale of the ill fated romance of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII told from the perspective of Anne's older sister Mary.  Other versions of this story has either ignored Mary or dismissed her as that other Boleyn girl that Henry had had a fling with and then discarded, after she had a child (or two) that may or may not have been his.  In Gregory's version Mary was the first daughter that the very ambitious Boleyn family men had used as a pawn to enhance their position at court.  As this production opens Mary is a happily married newlywed, young and rather shy she manages to catch Henry's eye (not that difficult to do) and was summoned to his bed.  Mary was quite reluctant to go but her husband as well as her family insisted that she must.  While Mary was sent from court to deliver a baby, one that in all probability was Henry's, younger sister Anne was sent in to keep the King occupied until Mary's return.  As most people undoubtedly know by now that plan went terribly wrong.This is not a bad telling of this tale, but it deviates quite a bit from Gregory's novel, making this production rather a 'Cliff's Notes' version of the story.  There are some interesting production techniques used though, such as having the characters 'break the third wall' and speak directly to the audience.  The closing sequence, which takes the viewer back to the present day is also effective.  Sadly though the characters do not come to life in this production in sharp contrast to the way they sprang from the printed page.  This viewer is still looking for a copy of the 2008 movie to see if it fared any better.",3,The Other Other Boleyn Girl,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,2150,"['picked', 'up', 'thinking', 'was', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'last', 'year', ""n't"", 'based', 'novel', 'Philippa', 'Gregory', 'half', 'way', 'realized', 'error', 'BBC', 'version', 'was', 'produced', '2003', 'obviously', 'shot', 'tv', 'production', 'budget', 'time', 'constraints', 'tv', 'project', 'opposed', 'major', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'interesting', 'telling', 'original', 'novel', 'even', 'not', 'particularly', 'faithful', 'novel', 'course', 'probably', 'familiar', 'tale', 'ill', 'fated', 'romance', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'told', 'perspective', 'Anne', 'older', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Other', 'versions', 'story', 'either', 'ignored', 'Mary', 'dismissed', 'other', 'Boleyn', 'girl', 'Henry', 'had', 'had', 'fling', 'then', 'discarded', 'had', 'child', 'two', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Gregory', 'version', 'Mary', 'was', 'first', 'daughter', 'very', 'ambitious', 'Boleyn', 'family', 'men', 'had', 'used', 'pawn', 'enhance', 'position', 'court', 'production', 'Mary', 'happily', 'married', 'newlywed', 'young', 'rather', 'shy', 'catch', 'Henry', 'eye', 'not', 'difficult', 'do', 'was', 'summoned', 'bed', 'Mary', 'was', 'quite', 'reluctant', 'go', 'husband', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'insisted', 'must', 'Mary', 'was', 'sent', 'court', 'deliver', 'baby', 'one', 'probability', 'was', 'Henry', 'younger', 'sister', 'Anne', 'was', 'sent', 'keep', 'King', 'occupied', 'Mary', 'return', 'most', 'people', 'undoubtedly', 'know', 'now', 'plan', 'went', 'terribly', 'wrong.This', 'not', 'bad', 'telling', 'tale', 'quite', 'bit', 'Gregory', 'novel', 'making', 'production', 'rather', ""'Cliff"", 'Notes', 'version', 'story', 'are', 'interesting', 'production', 'techniques', 'used', 'such', 'having', 'characters', ""'break"", 'third', 'wall', 'speak', 'directly', 'audience', 'closing', 'sequence', 'viewer', 'back', 'present', 'day', 'also', 'effective', 'Sadly', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'life', 'production', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'way', 'sprang', 'printed', 'page', 'viewer', 'still', 'looking', 'copy', '2008', 'movie', 'see', 'fared', 'better']",The Other Boleyn Girl

1129843,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00114XM04,kaduzy,"[5, 6]","I had high hopes for this production of ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" since it was done by the BBC, which usually means high standards if not high budgets.  However, this 90 minute production fails in a number of ways.  The major sore spot for me is the way the characters have been changed.  Mary is depicted as being extremely religious, and guilty about her affair with the king on strictly moral grounds, but in the book it was her love of the Queen that kept her guilt at such high levels.  I don't strictly care about changing something like that, since after all it's historical FICTON, and there's no way to really know how these people felt about anything, since they've been dead for so long.  However, I don't see the point of calling it an adaptation of Gregory's book if they're going to change such basic things that would be simple to keep the same.Casting is another serious problem.  Natascha McElhone is far too old to play the part of Mary, who starts off in the book at the tender age of 12 and was only 14 when she began her affair with the king.  She is obviously older than the actress playing her elder sister, Anne.  And she's so much more beautiful (Sorry Jodhi May, but it's true!)  that it's not very believable when the King throws her over for Anne.The other problem is unfortunate, because it was an interesting idea that MIGHT have worked with a different approach to the execution, but fails quite utterly.  The entire production is shot documentary style, with hand-held cameras and close-ups replacing the usual sweeping vistas and grand crane shots we've come to expect from period pieces.  I had no problem with that, but I DID have a problem with the confessional interviews the actors did directly with the camera, as if they were all starring in a reality show called ""The Real World: Tudor England edition"" or something.  (Actually, considering the eventual death toll, maybe ""Survivor: Tudor England edition"" would be a better title.)  It's jarring to see 16th-century characters speak to an invention that didn't even exist in their era, and the script at these intervals is absolutely feeble.Overall I think it's sad that such a magnificent book with so many rich things that could have soared onscreen has yet to be adapted in a way that truly captures its thrilling, majestic scope.  Even with a Hollywood budget, it couldn't be done, so maybe it wasn't fair to expect any better from a BBC production.

I first got caught by seeing who the actors were, the girl from Californication, and the one from Mansfield Park.  I thought I'd watch them and see how the show was.  I didn't like it that much at first, but it does grow on you and it is enjoyable.  The cheapness of the production and some of the shoddy direction is irritating but you get used to it after awhile and can overlook it.  I disliked the ""talking heads"" voice over style but survived.  The story was interesting and I felt that the motivations for Henry's and Anne's attraction was much more believable than any other production I'd ever seen.  Anne is deliberately impertinent to the King which he is unused to so he becomes attracted to her.  Anne can keep this up only so far.  After marrying him and having a daughter, the game begins a new phase.  Henry has Anne and begins to look elsewhere.  Anne, unused to not having Henry's attention, begins to fight.  While her fighting and arguing was attractive before, it no longer is and after having no sons, Anne's fate is sealed.  While not perfect, I do recommend this DVD highly and think you'll find it most enjoyable.

1129848,A2D0I7M2G43WWP,B00114XM04,Mena P.,"[0, 1]","One of the first adult novels I ever read was ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", and it helped introduce me to a whole world of historical fiction, despite the mixed opinions about it. I, like so many others, was far less than impressed with the Hollywood adaptation with Natalie Portman and Eric Bana, so when I found this I thought I had finally found a decent version. Surely, of all people, the BBC would get this right, wouldn't they? Unfortunately, no.While it is a bit more faithful to the novel, and I do like the casting better (this was Tudor times; Mary and Anne were not ""Hollywood"" stunning*) there are too many low points to make this a decent movie.- Firstly, and the most terrible of all, is that for some unfathomable reason this film is shot like a documentary. Anne and Mary actually talk to the camera as if they're on Real World: England; there is even an instance where one of the sisters goes running across the castle grounds in her nightshift, and the camera not only goes to night vision, it is pointed at the ground!- The costumes are absolutely terrible. Mary's teal gable hood is a complete disaster, with a strange, stiff white bit that honestly looks like a piece of plastic. They truly look like sometime from a cheap costume shop.- Mary is depicted as being the conspirator behind George and Anne's incest, which is also depicted as having happened. While one might argue that this is fiction after all, if we are following the book series continuity, it is proved in ""The Boleyn Inheritance"" that Jane Parker lied out of spite.- Henry literally gives not one care upon hearing the news that Mary has given birth to a son, due to his newfound infatuation with Anne. Let me just say that again. A King, a man who had the whole country in celebration for the birth of his first born (bastard) son and is constantly praying for another, barely blinks an eye at the news that his mistress has just given birth to a healthy baby boy. We all know Henry, that simply would not have happened.- I don't know what kind of camera they filmed this with, but the entire film is terribly grainy.- THE ENDING. Remember how I mentioned that it's shot like a documentary? The film ends with modern day footage of tourists around the memorial where the executions took place while Mary does a voice over stating that her brother and sister went to the scaffold after being declared guilty. That's it. No heart wrenching speech before Anne loses her head, nothing.- The romance between Mary and William Stafford is so sudden, it seems like some sort of Romeo and Juliet situation, having barely known each other before getting married.I could probably go on and on about all the things wrong about this film, but then my review would be as tedious to read as this movie was to watch. The only part I actually enjoyed was Anne's temper showing through when she sat at Henry's side and asked Henry which of the women in the room was his ""syphilitic whore."" It shows you how Anne (the Gregory Anne) went from a girl who only ever wanted to be happy to a power hungry woman desperate to keep her bum firmly planted on the throne.*You may argue that the casting of the Showtime show ""The Tudors"" has some pretty beautiful women playing the parts of Henry's queens, but we at least get to see them at vulnerable times, sometimes with their eyes red and puffy, faces covered in sweat and dirt, and at hideous low points in their lives. If I recall correctly, not a hair was out of place on Scarlet Johansson's head after giving birth to Catherine.",2,Will there ever be a decent adaptation of this book?,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,3544,"['One', 'first', 'adult', 'novels', 'ever', 'read', 'was', 'Other', 'Boleyn', 'Girl', 'helped', 'introduce', 'whole', 'world', 'historical', 'fiction', 'mixed', 'opinions', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'impressed', 'Hollywood', 'adaptation', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'when', 'found', 'thought', 'had', 'finally', 'found', 'decent', 'version', 'Surely', 'people', 'BBC', 'would', 'get', 'right', 'would', ""n't"", 'Unfortunately', 'bit', 'more', 'faithful', 'novel', 'do', 'casting', 'better', 'was', 'Tudor', 'times', 'Mary', 'Anne', 'were', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'stunning*', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'low', 'points', 'make', 'decent', 'movie.-', 'Firstly', 'most', 'terrible', 'unfathomable', 'reason', 'film', 'shot', 'documentary', 'Anne', 'Mary', 'actually', 'talk', 'camera', ""'re"", 'Real', 'World', 'England', 'even', 'instance', 'where', 'one', 'sisters', 'running', 'castle', 'nightshift', 'camera', 'not', 'only', 'night', 'vision', 'pointed', 'ground', 'costumes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'Mary', 'teal', 'gable', 'hood', 'complete', 'disaster', 'strange', 'stiff', 'white', 'bit', 'honestly', 'piece', 'plastic', 'truly', 'look', 'sometime', 'cheap', 'costume', 'shop.-', 'Mary', 'depicted', 'being', 'conspirator', 'George', 'Anne', 'incest', 'also', 'depicted', 'having', 'happened', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'fiction', 'are', 'following', 'book', 'series', 'continuity', 'proved', 'Boleyn', 'Inheritance', 'Jane', 'Parker', 'lied', 'spite.-', 'Henry', 'literally', 'not', 'one', 'care', 'hearing', 'news', 'Mary', 'given', 'birth', 'son', 'due', 'newfound', 'infatuation', 'Anne', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'again', 'A', 'King', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'whole', 'country', 'celebration', 'birth', 'first', 'born', 'bastard', 'son', 'constantly', 'praying', 'barely', 'eye', 'news', 'mistress', 'just', 'given', 'birth', 'healthy', 'baby', 'boy', 'know', 'Henry', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'happened.-', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'camera', 'filmed', 'entire', 'film', 'terribly', 'grainy.-', 'THE', 'ENDING', 'Remember', 'how', 'mentioned', 'shot', 'documentary', 'film', 'modern', 'day', 'footage', 'tourists', 'memorial', 'where', 'executions', 'took', 'place', 'Mary', 'voice', 'stating', 'brother', 'sister', 'went', 'scaffold', 'being', 'declared', 'guilty', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'speech', 'Anne', 'head', 'nothing.-', 'romance', 'Mary', 'William', 'Stafford', 'so', 'sudden', 'sort', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'situation', 'having', 'barely', 'known', 'other', 'getting', 'married.I', 'could', 'probably', 'go', 'things', 'wrong', 'film', 'then', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'tedious', 'read', 'movie', 'was', 'watch', 'only', 'part', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'Anne', 'temper', 'showing', 'when', 'sat', 'Henry', 'side', 'asked', 'Henry', 'women', 'room', 'was', 'syphilitic', 'whore', 'how', 'Anne', 'Gregory', 'Anne', 'went', 'girl', 'who', 'only', 'ever', 'wanted', 'be', 'happy', 'power', 'hungry', 'woman', 'desperate', 'keep', 'bum', 'firmly', 'planted', 'throne', '*You', 'may', 'argue', 'casting', 'Showtime', 'show', 'Tudors', 'pretty', 'beautiful', 'women', 'playing', 'parts', 'Henry', 'queens', 'least', 'get', 'see', 'vulnerable', 'times', 'sometimes', 'eyes', 'red', 'puffy', 'covered', 'sweat', 'dirt', 'hideous', 'low', 'points', 'lives', 'recall', 'correctly', 'not', 'hair', 'was', 'place', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'head', 'giving', 'birth', 'Catherine']",The Other Boleyn Girl
1129849,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00114XM04,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[5, 7]","This is the BBC production of ""The Other Boleyn Girl.""  As a British production, one would think it had polish, grace and elegance.  It does have that, of course -- given the period costimes & indoor and outdoor scenery -- but it also has far too many scenes where the beautiful period costumes come off...and our leading characters are seen in scenes inside the royal bedchambers.  And they are doing what couples usually do in bedchambers.  My rating for it would be ""R"", because of those very realisitic portrayed er.... bedroom scenes. (This DVD has no rating, however, so I was totally unprepared for these scenes.)What struck me first, however, was what, in my estimation, was the miscasting of the leading ladies, Natascha McElhone, (who plays MaryBoleyn), and Jodhi May, who plays Ann Boleyn.  Both are good actresses, and both are very pretty.  However, as I understand it, Ann Boleyn had a bewithing, stunning beauty -- and Jodhi May, though a very, very good actress, does not have that sort of beauty.  As seen on the cover o the DVD, she is pert, and mischievous, and though, in later scenes, she does develop a depth of tragically beautiful face, so unlike the beginning scenes, it is NEVER as intriguingly beautiful as the face of Natascha McElhone -- a beauty somewhat on the style of (the ACTRESS), Jane Seymour.  Were I the casting director, I would have switched these actresses in their roles.  Both are obviously accomplished in their craft, and, even in the roles they are herein given, both add believabilty and depth to their characters.  However, Ms. McElhone looks far more like my own idea of how Anne Boleyn looked, than does Ms. May.The dialogue in this movie is formal -- but not overly so.  It is not Shakespearian, nor even near-Shakespearian -- and for this, I, for one, am glad.  No straining for meaning at sentences with archaic cadence here.  Yet, the dialogue maintains an elegance of pattern and words, that makes the viewer realize that, though the acting makes these characters come alive, that they, (the characters), did live nearly five hundred years ago, and things were different then.The scenery is equisite, both indoors and out.  The rest of the cast acts credibily and with conviction, adding a deep believabilty to all the roles.  The plot has many twists and turns, and the story goes rather quickly -- but the film is involving, and one can easily follow the story.  Phillippa Gregory, the writer of the novel on which this DVD, (and anoter version, starring Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanson), was based, and who served as Historical Advisor on this film, should be justly proud that her novel has been made into TWO movies. Her careful research into this fascinating story shows that two movies of it, at least, are deserved.  ( S P O I L E R )  And I for one am glad that it has a quasi-happy ending -- at least for one of the sisters.  Still, this sister becomes ""a nobody"" -- and is happy about it.  There are echoes in this of the English class system, at least to my American ear.  People of ambition in the lower classes were once, (and perhaps still are), being told that their ambitions makes them ""wanting to get above"" themselves.  (To any English person in this dilemma who may be reading this, my suggestion is to say: ""Only God is above me"".  At least, that's what I'd say in this situation.  The sister who winds up a ""nobody"" in this film leads, afterwards, a comfortable life -- albeit away from the Royal court -- with husband and children.  Several prominent people are descended from her -- including Winston Churchill, Charles Darwin, Princess Diana, and Humphrey Bogart!  She was ONLY a ""nobody"" in that she did not live at court.  Comfortable and happy, she led the life of an upper-middle class person.  NOT a nobody -- at least, not to American eyes.  E N D...O F...S P O I L E R )All in all a good, well-acted movie.  I only wish the casting had been done a little more carefully, and that some sort of a rating was attached to this film, (none on the outside, or inside of this DVD), so that viewers would fully know, (and be fully prepared for),what they would see.",3,"T H E.......O T H E R.......""

1129852,A3FMZ98X1GIYV9,B00114XM04,S. McGee,"[5, 5]","Alas, my hopes of seeing a good film version of this book have now been completely dashed.Jodhi May bears no resemblence to either the historical Anne Boleyn or her fictional counterpart as presented by Philippa Gregory. Her slightly stooped demeanor and diffident manner are slightly absurd, given that Anne was known for her sparkling wit, intellect and confidence. That is rarely seen in this film, which makes her flareup in front of the courtiers not only completely ridiculous but out of context to the way her character had developed.On a more personal level, I found the hand-held cameras and characters speaking to the cameras more than a little distracting. It felt as if it was being done for the sake of being different, rather than for what it could do to contribute to the film.I could go on and on with a list of things that was wrong with this production, but won't bother. It was simply bad in a very different way from the Hollywood version.The only reason for the second star was the greater level of historical accuracy. At least in this version, Mary doesn't make off with an infant Elizabeth after Anne's beheading.

1129853,A157T7L0BY7WFZ,B00114XM04,"TXdust ""Gabe""","[1, 3]","The american interpretation of the book into movie was horrible.  The book is about the other Boleyn sister.  The one who died with her head attached to her body.  Not as much of the famous sister who married the king and meet her end to an axe blade to the head.  It's the title of the book, but much of what the american version failed on was to keep the focus on Mary.  Seems once done in the editing room the film stock that ended the product seemed to focus on Natalie Portman's portrayal of Anne Boleyn.  I question if the director wanted Natalie Portman to be the lead why not just give her the part of Mary?  So I went into this movie hoping that BBC would focus more in the lines of the original book.  I could tell they seemed to have good intentions going into the script, but what is presented is hollow scenes that seem to have fall wayside to a low budget.  The story has been converted into a reality show style.  Even though the cloths and setting slightly resemble the past, the scenes work around a reality show aspect.  So often times you have characters conveying events and emotions via a video recorded confessional.  Really made me feel I was watching the real world or The Bachelor.  Who is getting King Henry the VIII's rose, and gain his hand in marriage?  Who will get betrayed and who will be the back stabber?  I understand why they thought it would be a good idea to go down this route, since the tutors deep down sound like an episode of Jerry Springer. Problem is the premise was poorly executed.  Even reality shows create a focus around one or two characters and events.  They cast everyone else as back characters picking only one villain and one protagonist.  The movie glides across years worth of events in the matter of minutes.  Addressing too many at once, seemly more like a montage for a class reunion  than creating in depth scenes.  The idea of the story being of Mary is to not rush to Anne's death.  Allow for an imagined idea on what it was like to be King Henry's mistress, and to be thrown aside for your sister.  Instead you have quick scenes filmed in empty rooms(yes some rooms no props just stone walls) to get you to Anne Boleyn's death as quickly as possible.  Although that part of the book's interpretation is one of the more controversial parts of the book, it is no way the theme of the book.  I didn't think there could be a movie based on this book worse than the American version, but because of poorly funded scenes, lack of focus of any story arc, this movie gets a 2 out of 5 instead of the 3 out of 5 I give the other movie.  The acting although decent does not make up for its many short comings.Rating based on staying true to the book3 out of 5They tried but never could find the focusCinematic Scenery1 out of 5Ok maybe closer to 2 out of five since it was filmed in a castle.  An empty castle, but a castle all the same.Costumes seemed to be good enough, but not excellent. I have even heard not all of them were of the right era.  Thats not my area of expertise, but they did seem pretty generic.  Like any production group that does Shakespeare would have available for Shakespeare in the park.Pace2 out of 5I didn't like it.  I know a good amount of that part of history.  I had even read the book and the pace was too fast for me to understand what was always going on.  I would of hated going into this movie not have any back knowledge.  The only saving grace of not getting much from the scenes is there is those god awful video confessionals.  The characters literally spell things out for you talking into the camera.  Kinda like the history channel would. That didn't impress me at all.Acting4 out of 5There were some pretty bad performances, but there are some really great ones as well.  Even the bad jobs were done by decent actors, who seemed comfortable in the role.  The funny thing is almost every actor had at least one bad scene.  Like something about the filming had them off their game from time to time.  Giving the feeling that the movie staging was being done on location.  Some actors could handle and thrive in such chaos, most seemed to push through it just barely, and other seemed frazzled by it from the start.  Over all had a stage production feel which I didn't mind too much.  Of all the aspects of the movie I thought the acting was one of the best aspects of the movie.  So I might have been extra gracious with giving it a 4 instead of 3, but I just couldn't bare giving such performances a 3.Overall enjoyment2 out of 5I just couldn't get into the reality show concept. Like I said before, if this was a real realty show, the production in editing was well bellow the par of the most basic reality show.  At times that concept didn't even seem present.  Watching the movie in different portions you can't even tell what story style it is.  Maybe the director hadn't watched enough reality television, and lowered the quality of his work to fit what his concept was of reality television.  Instead of using proper story pacing and creating the that concept around the story not vice versa.  It just didn't fit in my expectations, nor was it strong enough break them down a grab my attention.",2,"Cliche I know; Not as good as the book, but not even as good as the american version.

1129855,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00114XM04,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","As a fan of Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name, I was disappointed in the 2008 movie version starring Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson. It deviated greatly from the book and focused too much on the sexual politics than anything else of substance. When I came across this 2003 BBC version, I hoped that it would be better than the later version. Sadly, though it is a more faithful adaptation, it is still a deficient production.In the BBC version, Natasha McElhone stars as  Mary Boleyn,who was Henry VIII's mistress before he became infatuated with Anne. I found Natasha McElhone's character portrayal to be lack luster, lacking conviction and failing to connect with me as the viewer. I actually felt Scarlett Johansson did a better job in conveying the innocence of the character than McElhone.But the star of the show is definitely Jodhi May as Anne Boleyn - she happens to be one of my favorite period actresses [the other is Justine Waddell] and manages to convince the viewer of her inner charms that managed to not only capture the king's attention but provoke him into leaving his wife and moving away from the Church just so he could finally possess her. May's eyes are very expressive and credibly evoke her ambitions, much more persuasively than Natalie Portman did in the 2008 movie version.As for Henry VIII, the actor portraying him, Jared Harris does a credible job, and a lot better than the petulant, hissy king portrayed by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in The Tudors [a cable series].The production values in this BBC production fall far short of the superior quality of both the cable series and the 2008 movie version. The low budget makes this a rather colorless production in terms of costumes, sets and cinematography.
