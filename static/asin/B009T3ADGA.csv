1601944,AIS3Q7ISV0WGQ,B009T3ADGA,Angel,"[9, 20]","The storyline is just a complete mess. These episodes are really all just a ruse for the main character, Saya Kisaragi, to see if she will keep her kindness or revert back to her former self, a brutal killing vampire. So with that in mind this slice of super fake life comes off as very boring and predictable. I don't think the writers realized that in a 12 episode anime having over 80% of it being a fake plot was not a great way to handle it. This also unfortunately made everything feel very random and choppy so nothing flowed together. Another bad part is that the viewer can just skip to the final two episodes, and understand exactly what's going on, which leads to debate the problem of how shallow the storyline is.The concept however was interesting with testing the strong will of someone to see how much they could take. But still the concept is not enough to save Blood-C from its own fake world of delusion.Another problem .The viewer really gets cheated in a sense that they are supposed to be watching a blood and gory filled anime, but only get many censored scenes. The blood in this anime seemed so fake because it would just spray out like a water fountain too. The characters themselves are average, but it seems that many of them just seemed to have very bland and weak colors and texture.horrible storyline the characters. The interactions between them and Saya are just horrible, and are as fake as the storyline. There isn't any emotion, except the fear shown just before they get killed. We get these very awkward moments where when Saya says something, and every other character would just wait about 10 seconds then speak. This made conversations with her very drawn out.Saya herself is one of the worst heroes of all time. ""I will protect them"" is her slogan, but nope she doesn't save a single soul. Also she too is a victim of the awkwardness a foot. When Saya encounters a monster she sits there and ponders on what to do, even when people's lives are at stake. It's like she's brain dead to the fact that blood is being thrown in every direction, people are being devoured brutally, and people are dying. Her slogan should be ""I will protect only myself, and watch others die as I ""pretend"" to save them"".With that said none of the characters develop either, not even Saya because they all stay the same throughout the series. This is a real shame when your viewers are aware of the senseless the characters are feeling.Even though Blood-C had a great concept the overall experience is dismal. A storyline full of doubt and plot holes was just a start to this downward spiral of nothingness. Character development is non-existent. Sound and Animation are sub-par, and Enjoyment is hit or miss, which it usually misses. This means that there's really nothing going on with Blood-C. I honestly don't think most fans of the original Blood: The Last Vampire, and Blood + will not find this even a bit interesting or even fans of other horror/gore anime will either.

Happy friendships, sunlit singing whilst strolling to school, a happy home life with a loving father... all are a prelude to the bloodbath. Nothing can really be discussed about the plot without giving away the outcome, but it'll all make sense. The animation is gorgeous. You will see exquisite, highly detailed slaughter, incredible sword battles and gallons of blood. Add Saya, a total anime goddess, and you have a guro classic.The blu-ray image is striking, with a tiny bit of banding on some gradients. Frame-forwarding through the kill-scenes is fun when you can pick out the phenomenal gore. Audio is excellent, bringing the haunting score to the fore.

1601946,A3I8APG47OVZ1W,B009T3ADGA,Ben Birdwhistell,"[16, 28]","The Blood franchise has had an unusual history in anime. First we had Blood: The Last Vampire, where Saya just seems to show up as a kind of Black Operative that takes out vampiric threats when she is called for to deal with them. It was a good action movie with interesting animation and an enjoyable story. Then we had Blood+, a 50 episode TV series where we see Saya learn of her true vampiric nature and the development of her character as she fights to end the vampire threat in a tense, emotional, globe-spanning epic drama chock full of interesting characters and plenty of gory fun. And now we have Blood C...Oh boy, do we have Blood C. Easily the weakest of the three entries into the franchise, Blood C has several MAJOR problems both in terms of story structure and execution. Firstly, the plot is poorly planned and executed. The first half of the story is spent mostly on random one off episodes which are half high school angst and half violent demon-hunting, and these elements are never properly meshed in these episodes. The second half tries to mesh these elements, fails miserably, and then dumps a whole bunch of really stupid plot twists in the last episode, setting up what could have been a much more interesting progression for the series, if it weren't for the fact that it was the last episode. Second the gore is overused. The Blood series have always been known for gore and grotesque violence, but there is just so much of it in this series so often that you just get desensitized to it after the second episode and it becomes repetitive and boring. Third, you have no reason to be invested in this story. This version of Saya is neither as likable nor as interesting as previous versions, and most of the side characters are bland, generic cutouts that turn out to be completely unlikable a%$holes by the end of the series. The plot does nothing to invest you beyond the basic premise introduction and little hints of that increasing tired cliche: ""there's something more going on..."" Finally, that plot twist at the end of the series seems like a giant middle finger to anyone who was trying to enjoy the story up to this point. Don't waste your money on this series. It felt like a giant waste of my time when I watched it. Go watch either the Blood+ TV series or the the Blood: the Last Vampire movie if you don't want to invest the time to watch a 50 episode series. Those I can recommend. Avoid Blood C unless you have a whole bunch of time and money to wastefully fritter away.",2,Incredibly Disappointing To Watch,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,2513,"['Blood', 'franchise', 'had', 'unusual', 'history', 'anime', 'First', 'had', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'where', 'Saya', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'kind', 'Black', 'Operative', 'out', 'vampiric', 'threats', 'when', 'called', 'deal', 'was', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'interesting', 'animation', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'Then', 'had', 'Blood+', '50', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'where', 'see', 'Saya', 'learn', 'true', 'vampiric', 'nature', 'development', 'character', 'end', 'vampire', 'threat', 'tense', 'emotional', 'globe-spanning', 'epic', 'drama', 'chock', 'full', 'interesting', 'characters', 'plenty', 'gory', 'fun', 'now', 'have', 'Blood', 'C', 'Oh', 'boy', 'do', 'have', 'Blood', 'C.', 'Easily', 'weakest', 'three', 'entries', 'franchise', 'Blood', 'C', 'several', 'MAJOR', 'problems', 'terms', 'story', 'structure', 'execution', 'Firstly', 'plot', 'poorly', 'planned', 'executed', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'spent', 'mostly', 'random', 'one', 'off', 'episodes', 'are', 'half', 'high', 'school', 'angst', 'half', 'violent', 'demon-hunting', 'elements', 'are', 'never', 'properly', 'meshed', 'episodes', 'second', 'half', 'tries', 'mesh', 'elements', 'miserably', 'then', 'dumps', 'whole', 'bunch', 'really', 'stupid', 'plot', 'twists', 'last', 'episode', 'setting', 'up', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'progression', 'series', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'was', 'last', 'episode', 'Second', 'gore', 'overused', 'Blood', 'series', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'known', 'gore', 'grotesque', 'violence', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'series', 'so', 'often', 'just', 'get', 'desensitized', 'second', 'episode', 'repetitive', 'boring', 'Third', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'invested', 'story', 'version', 'Saya', 'likable', 'as', 'interesting', 'previous', 'versions', 'most', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'bland', 'generic', 'cutouts', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'completely', 'unlikable', '%', 'holes', 'end', 'series', 'plot', 'nothing', 'invest', 'basic', 'premise', 'introduction', 'little', 'hints', 'increasing', 'tired', 'cliche', 'something', 'more', 'going', 'Finally', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'series', 'giant', 'middle', 'finger', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'enjoy', 'story', 'up', 'point', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'series', 'felt', 'giant', 'waste', 'time', 'when', 'watched', 'Go', 'watch', 'either', 'Blood+', 'TV', 'series', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'invest', 'time', 'watch', '50', 'episode', 'series', 'can', 'recommend', 'Avoid', 'Blood', 'C', 'have', 'whole', 'bunch', 'time', 'money', 'wastefully', 'fritter', 'away']",N/A

A lot of people are complaining about censorship when they only watched it streamed and not the actual blu ray. That's like complaining about how horrible the quality of the show was on the internet stream and not actually watching the blu ray release. What makes Blood C different from Blood (which I didn't care for) and Blood + (which I enjoyed) is that this one was produced by Production IG and Clamp while Blood and Blood + were produced by Production IG and Aniplex. If you like Clamp, then more than likely you will like Blood C, if you don't, then you probably won't. The same tall, lanky, long legged characters are all here and it does feel like you're watching more of Card Captor Sakura than an actual Blood anime. I like Clamp so this didn't bother. The production value is high and the artworks are gorgeous. This series is only 12 episodes so it's not very long. About 75% of the show is about Saya and her fake life while the other 25%, near the end is where the storyline takes place. There are some things that might keep people from buying this anime and that is Funimation coded the blu ray so that you can't switch audio while watching the show. You have to press the pop up menu and then switch the audio. The other one, and this is more for serious anime lovers, is that the subtitles are hard and not soft. This means that you will not be able to turn off the subs, even if you wanted to. They're burned into the blu ray. The DVDs are the same way, in that you won't be able to switch the audio. If you're fine with this and like the anime then go ahead and buy. However, if you didn't like the anime before, this is another thing for someone to complain about. I've made my peace with these reverse importations and how more and more animes will probably come out with these hard subs. Since I don't understand Japanese, I don't really mind as I need them to fully understand what's being said. As far as extras are concerned, the first blu ray disc only has one episode commentary and on disc 2 contains the usual with one episode commentary, commericals, promotional videos, clean opening and closing, U.S. trailers and trailers. I enjoyed the series and although I've had this boxset since December, I'm just now writing a review for it as I totally forgot I even had it until a friend asked to borrow it. Got to love Rightstuf, my favorite anime distributor. Also, as for the people complaining about the way it ended, there's a movie that takes place directly after the finale.

1601949,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B009T3ADGA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[16, 21]","Back in 2000, the animated film ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" was released in theaters and released in the United States.The animated film set in 1966 was focused on a vampire named Saya who hunts down bat-like creatures known as chiropterans.  The animated film would eventually lead to a manga series ""Blood: The Last Vampire 2000&#8243; and three Japanese light novels plus a video game.In 2005, a 50-episode anime series titled ""Blood+"", an alternate timeline would be featured and would focus on an amnesiac named Saya Otanashi who lives the life of an ordinary school girl.  Until she is attacked by a Chiropteran and finds out that she somehow can fight against them and is the only one that can defeat them.  This leads to a storyline with Saya, her family and friends trying to rid the world of the Chiropteran and her starting to remember her history.In 2011, a new anime and manga series was created by this time by the famous manga creators, CLAMP.  The anime series was 12-episodes long while an animated film titled ""Blood-C: The Last Dark"" was released in the summer of 2012.In ""Blood-C"", the series focuses on Saya Kisaragi, a normal, clumsy schoolgirl who lives with her father, Tadayoshi, a priest in the local shrine.  She trains as a miko (a priestess) and has a secret life of learning a sacred sword and the ""art of the sword"" to slay Furukimono (monsters).It is learned that Saya is following the path that her mother had done before she died.  But as time goes on, she is unsure about herself, her duties of fighting the monsters and her true self.Meanwhile, more monster incidents are happening in town and people including friends are disappearing or are attacked and killed.  And the guilt of not being able to protect them begins to make Saya question her role even more.VIDEO:""Blood-C"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  With Production I.G. responsible for the production, I expected the series to look fantastic and for the most part, the animation does not disappoint.  Characters and monsters are incredibly well-shaded, art backgrounds have the Production I.G. quality of being amazingly detailed and for the most part, this series looks incredible.But possibly the biggest surprise is that this is the first CLAMP anime series that doesn't look like a CLAMP anime series.  Typically for CLAMP, characters proportions have long necks, long limbs and such, but for ""Blood-C"", the characters look different.  If anything, the anime production is stylish, visually the series looks very cool and I like the character design of Saya.  She looks very innocent and pure but can easily transform to a killer.AUDIO:""Blood-C"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. Because the English soundtrack gets the 5.1 treatment, there is better dynamic range with the English soundtrack, especially during the action sequences.  But both sound very good, dialogue is crisp and clear but the English dub does get the edge in terms of dynamic range due to its 5.1 soundtrack.  With that being said, for the English dub track, voice actress Alexis Tipton does a wonderful job playing the character Saya.  From playing a character with varying emotions, Tipton also gets to show off her singing voice as well.  Robert McCollum does an excellent job of playing Fumihito as well.As for the Japanese soundtrack, you have one of Japan's well-known voice actresses and anime theme song singers in Japan for the role of Saya.  Singer/voice actress Nana Mizuki (Fate Testarosa of ""Magical Girl Lyrical Nanonha"", Hinata Hyuuga of ""Naruto"", Victini of ""Pokemon"") does an amazing job playing Saya and also singing the ending theme song for ""Blood-C"".  Nana does a great job in capturing the various emotions of the character.  Also, Kenji Nojima does a great job playing Fumihito.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Blood-C: The Complete Series"" comes with the following special features:Episode 6 Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by ADR director Jerry Jewell and Robert McCollum (voice of Fumihito).  Do not listen to the audio commentary before completing the series, as there are spoilers.Episode 12 Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by ADR director Jerry Jewell and Alexis Tipton (voice of Saya).

A vampire storyline of a vampire who hunts down Chiropterans (bat-like creatures) and the Saya has always been a character where one can expect to kick some serious ass!""Blood-C"" felt like a series that you invest your time in and by the time you get to the final episode, you feel as if you have been punked!While the animated film ""Blood-C: The Last Dark"" had received positive reviews, the television series was panned in Japan and I can see why.First, I'm going to discuss the positive.  The positive of this series is the fact that Production I.G. has done a wonderful job when it comes to the animation and art backgrounds of this TV series.  Characters and even the chiroptherans are well-animated and shaded and the characters are nicely drawn.Another positive is the voice acting.  In Japan, you have Nana Mizuki doing a stellar job on voice acting and also singing the ending theme for the series. I also felt the English dub was wonderful and it was great to hear Alexis Tipton in a role where she can really show off her voice talent.  From various emotional states to even singing, she did a fantastic job.But while the animation, art and voice acting are well-done, the problem with ""Blood-C"" is its story.I suppose part of the problem lies in the fact that if you have watched ""Blood the Last Vampire"", watched ""Blood+"" and even watched the live-action film, you feel you know the series and how it was always about Saya taking on the chiropterans and you know that she is a character that is going to serve up a major ass kicking.But somehow, it seemed as if the writers saved that for the animated film instead.By episode 8, you find out that nearly every classmate by Saya was killed by a chiropteran and just when you think that you're going to see the Saya (that we have seen in the previous incarnations of ""Blood) in major kick-ass mode, we get a major reveal that you don't expect and I must say, it really felt like a kick in the gut.In fact, I'm not going to even get into it but I just felt that for something that was carrying a lot of potential by episode 8, it just went downhill from there.  I rarely get frustrated by watching an anime series, but this series left me frustrated.Especially if you have been a fan of the ""Blood"" series, from ""Blood+"" to ""Blood-C"", it was disappointing because I was expecting something big after episode 8 but instead, the story just went downhill.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Blood-C"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray and the English lossless soundtrack has the edge because it's in 5.1 and has better dynamic range. The Blu-ray also has two audio commentaries and the Japanese commercials and promotional video.Overall, ""Blood-C"" is an animated series that does continue the ""Blood"" series by name, features a wonderful collaboration between Production I.G. and CLAMP and as expected, the animation and art backgrounds looks fantastic and is also well-acted for both the Japanese soundtrack and the English dub.Unfortunately, I was disappointed with how ""Blood-C"" ended but I just hope that the reason why it ended the way it did, was to set things up for the animated film ""Blood-C: The Last Dark"".  If you want a ""Blood"" series that is exciting and entertaining, ""Blood+"" is much better.",3,"Not the best ""Blood"" animated series made...it was average at best.",1364601600,"03 30,

1601950,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B009T3ADGA,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[5, 7]","I have a full confession to make about this show. When it was first airing, my first viewing of the series was stalled significantly due to the fact that it seemed trite, boring, and repetitive. Throughout most of my time with the series, I found the characters to be deeply cliche, the narrative to be predictable, the suspense to be canned. So, after it had finished airing, I decided to marathon the rest on a whim due to lack of shows at the time. And I'm glad I did, because all of my complaints became defenses. Every single thing you hate about &#65279;&#65279;Blood-C &#65279;is put there intentionally to through you off of what is one of the most self-aware send-ups of the anime industry I've ever seen.On a very surface level, the plot follows Saya, a ditzy schoolgirl who happens to live at and train in a shrine on a secluded island. She eats sweets, pets stray animals, and acts like an all-around klutz. Her friends are pink-haired, silly twins, and her love interest is a stoic, yet bashful boy. But by night, she becomes a deadly swordswoman, murdering brutal creatures called Chiropterans in a horribly bloody fashion. So, to recap, a cutesy nerd turns into a badass by night and protects her town in secret. Yep, this sounds like a remarkably worn premise, no?Unfortunately, I cannot reveal the mind-boggling twist that occurs to you at the end of the series. It would ruin the effect of the show, which is to beat you into submission by using every single contemporary anime cliche imaginable. Terrible slice-of-life shows, dull grimdark action series, and other popular genres are merged together into a homoculus of stereotypes, making for an experience that is thoroughly and utterly predictable. Until, all of a sudden, it isn't. In the last 2-3 episodes, everything you thought up until that point is brutally subverted. Everything wrong with the modern anime industry is laid bare, put up on the chopping block, then (literally and metaphorically) butchered. In the end, we get one of the most beautifully meta-analytic works to come out of the anime industry since &#65279;Neon Genesis Evangelion&#65279;.The show is certainly beautiful to look at as well. Character designs by Clamp are brought to vivid life thanks to the vibrant animation by Production IG. Backgrounds are simply gorgeous to look at, despite their usage during some of the shows more intentionally dull parts. Fight sequences are tight and move along at a nice, brisk pace, and result in buckets of satisfying gore. Most impressive to me, though, are the freakish monsters. Almost every single one of them is the stuff nightmares are made of, and I often questioned how in the heck they were conceived. Raw imagination oozes from the aesthetics of the show, in more ways than one.Background music is very solid. Definitely nothing that's wholly special, but it gets the job done depending on the scene, and for a show that is trying on a lot of different styles at once, that's definitely an admirable job. The opening and ending clips, however, are definitely exceptional, and are in fact some of the best in recent years. Most impressive to me is the opening, which combines Japanese, English and French to an awesome, thrashing J-Rock song, and tops it off with some excellent animation.Blood-C &#65279;is supposed to infuriate you, and supposed to bore you at times, and supposed to make you roll your eyes. It does this with the express purpose of making you realize most of the problems with the anime we watch today, and to anger you as everything you took for granted is coldly snatched away at the last second. This show is a coldhearted smack in the face to works by studios like Kyoto Animation, and a sneering jab at otaku who keep throwing money at slice-of-life and moe series. While some of the execution is a bit sloppy, its intentions are in the right place.Some people call the writers of this series ""trolls"" for how they wrapped up. Me? I call them brilliant for having the guts to pull a fantastically cruel practical joke on everybody, including myself.Plot: A-Animation: AMusic: BOverall: A-",5,A Bloody Deconstruction of Modern Anime,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,4112,"['have', 'full', 'confession', 'make', 'show', 'When', 'was', 'first', 'airing', 'first', 'viewing', 'series', 'was', 'stalled', 'significantly', 'due', 'fact', 'seemed', 'trite', 'boring', 'repetitive', 'most', 'time', 'series', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'deeply', 'cliche', 'narrative', 'be', 'predictable', 'suspense', 'be', 'canned', 'So', 'had', 'finished', 'airing', 'decided', 'marathon', 'rest', 'whim', 'due', 'lack', 'shows', 'time', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'complaints', 'became', 'defenses', 'single', 'thing', 'hate', '65279', '65279', 'Blood-C', '65279', 'put', 'there', 'intentionally', 'what', 'one', 'most', 'self-aware', 'send-ups', 'anime', 'industry', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.On', 'very', 'surface', 'level', 'plot', 'Saya', 'ditzy', 'schoolgirl', 'who', 'live', 'train', 'shrine', 'secluded', 'island', 'sweets', 'pets', 'stray', 'animals', 'acts', 'all-around', 'klutz', 'friends', 'are', 'pink-haired', 'silly', 'twins', 'love', 'interest', 'stoic', 'yet', 'bashful', 'boy', 'night', 'deadly', 'swordswoman', 'murdering', 'brutal', 'creatures', 'called', 'Chiropterans', 'horribly', 'bloody', 'fashion', 'So', 'recap', 'cutesy', 'nerd', 'badass', 'night', 'town', 'secret', 'Yep', 'remarkably', 'worn', 'premise', 'Unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'mind-boggling', 'twist', 'end', 'series', 'would', 'ruin', 'effect', 'show', 'beat', 'submission', 'using', 'single', 'contemporary', 'anime', 'cliche', 'imaginable', 'Terrible', 'slice-of-life', 'shows', 'dull', 'grimdark', 'action', 'series', 'other', 'popular', 'genres', 'are', 'merged', 'together', 'homoculus', 'stereotypes', 'making', 'experience', 'thoroughly', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'sudden', ""n't"", 'last', '2-3', 'episodes', 'everything', 'thought', 'up', 'point', 'brutally', 'subverted', 'Everything', 'wrong', 'modern', 'anime', 'industry', 'laid', 'bare', 'put', 'up', 'chopping', 'block', 'then', 'literally', 'metaphorically', 'butchered', 'end', 'get', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'meta-analytic', 'works', 'come', 'anime', 'industry', '65279', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', '65279', '.The', 'show', 'certainly', 'beautiful', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'Character', 'designs', 'Clamp', 'are', 'brought', 'vivid', 'life', 'thanks', 'vibrant', 'animation', 'Production', 'IG', 'Backgrounds', 'are', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'usage', 'shows', 'more', 'intentionally', 'dull', 'parts', 'Fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'tight', 'move', 'along', 'nice', 'brisk', 'pace', 'result', 'buckets', 'satisfying', 'gore', 'Most', 'impressive', 'though', 'are', 'freakish', 'monsters', 'single', 'one', 'stuff', 'nightmares', 'are', 'made', 'often', 'questioned', 'how', 'heck', 'were', 'conceived', 'Raw', 'imagination', 'aesthetics', 'show', 'more', 'ways', 'one.Background', 'music', 'very', 'solid', 'Definitely', 'nothing', 'wholly', 'special', 'job', 'done', 'depending', 'scene', 'show', 'trying', 'lot', 'different', 'styles', 'once', 'definitely', 'admirable', 'job', 'opening', 'ending', 'clips', 'however', 'are', 'definitely', 'exceptional', 'are', 'fact', 'best', 'recent', 'years', 'Most', 'impressive', 'opening', 'Japanese', 'English', 'French', 'awesome', 'thrashing', 'J-Rock', 'song', 'off', 'excellent', 'animation.Blood-C', '65279', 'supposed', 'infuriate', 'supposed', 'bore', 'times', 'supposed', 'make', 'roll', 'eyes', 'express', 'purpose', 'making', 'realize', 'most', 'problems', 'anime', 'watch', 'today', 'anger', 'everything', 'took', 'granted', 'coldly', 'snatched', 'away', 'last', 'second', 'show', 'coldhearted', 'smack', 'face', 'works', 'studios', 'Kyoto', 'Animation', 'sneering', 'jab', 'otaku', 'who', 'keep', 'throwing', 'money', 'slice-of-life', 'moe', 'series', 'execution', 'bit', 'sloppy', 'intentions', 'are', 'right', 'place.Some', 'people', 'call', 'writers', 'series', 'trolls', 'how', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Me', 'call', 'brilliant', 'having', 'guts', 'pull', 'fantastically', 'cruel', 'practical', 'joke', 'everybody', 'including', 'myself.Plot', 'A-Animation', 'AMusic', 'BOverall', 'A-']",N/A

1601953,A22OD81Z9HYFV1,B009T3ADGA,Kris,"[0, 0]","What happens when the Blood franchise mixes with the creative team of Clamp? You get Blood C, which is probably one of the most highly anticipated anime the year it was released. The Blood series started with a movie called Blood the Last Vampire, and then the series, Blood Plus continued the legacy. Blood C then followed after Blood Plus, and does not seem to have anything in common with the previous series, so if you did not see them, this title can be watched without prior knowledge of either previous incarnations.The first thing to know about this series is that it is called Blood for a reason. There is a lot of blood and gore in this series. Probably more than anyone could possibly imagine. This show is done by Clamp, who made cute series like Chobits and Cardcaptor Sakura, so you would expect this series to be cute as well. The show does have nice looking character designs like Clamp's other titles, but the show is very deceptive in nature, especially when these nice looking characters get killed.The series starts off rather episodically with the main character, Saya, a shrine maiden, merrily going to school in her rather perfect looking life. When I say merrily, I mean it; she actually sings on her way to and from school. She also goes to the caf&eacute; on her way to school to get breakfast and coffee. The proprietor of the caf&eacute; is a friend of Saya's father. When night falls, Saya's father tells her that there has been a monster sighting  in the town, and she needs to kill the monster. The monsters are called elder bairns, and they are very unusual looking. Each one has a unique look to it, such as an eyeball monster, a plant monster, a statue, a shadow being, and many others. I didn't want to explain them in detail because you just have to watch it for yourself to find out what they are. The episodes seem kind of benign at first, but after episode 3 or 4, the series begins to shake things up with some new developments.This series is probably one of the true horror anime in recent years. The unsettling eerie atmosphere created by the small town yields uncertainty amongst the viewer. The background music in the show is very good, and sets the mood for this horrific show. Also, the opening theme song is really good for the show, and gets the viewer pumped for the upcoming episode. The only music that seems questionable is the overly happy sounding music used for the next episode previews for the first half of the show. It just seems inappropriate to have such cheery music when the episode is actually about a giant centipede monster eating a girl's head off.As mentioned before, this anime is very violent, and should not be watched without prior knowledge of this fact. Originally, I thought that most of the violence would be against the monsters, especially after I learned that Clamp worked on this show. I figured since they worked on this, it would not be an absolute blood bath, but it is. Sure it is not too violent at first, but then I watched episode 6, and it changed a lot of things I knew about this show. One good aspect about the violence is that the fighting scenes in the anime are done really well, especially the fight scene in the final episode.Blood C is distributed by Funimation and I feel that they did a good job with this one. There really aren't any different special features on this collection that you wouldn't get out of other anime series.  If you are into bloody anime like Hellsing Ultimate or Elfen Lied, then you should definitely check this title out.",5,Probably the most bloody and gory anime in a long while,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,3546,"['What', 'when', 'Blood', 'franchise', 'mixes', 'creative', 'team', 'Clamp', 'get', 'Blood', 'C', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'year', 'was', 'released', 'Blood', 'series', 'started', 'movie', 'called', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'then', 'series', 'Blood', 'Plus', 'continued', 'legacy', 'Blood', 'C', 'then', 'followed', 'Blood', 'Plus', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'anything', 'common', 'previous', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'title', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'previous', 'incarnations.The', 'first', 'thing', 'know', 'series', 'called', 'Blood', 'reason', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'series', 'Probably', 'more', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'show', 'done', 'Clamp', 'who', 'made', 'cute', 'series', 'Chobits', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'would', 'expect', 'series', 'be', 'cute', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'have', 'nice', 'looking', 'character', 'designs', 'Clamp', 'other', 'titles', 'show', 'very', 'deceptive', 'nature', 'especially', 'when', 'nice', 'looking', 'characters', 'get', 'killed.The', 'series', 'rather', 'episodically', 'main', 'character', 'Saya', 'shrine', 'maiden', 'merrily', 'going', 'school', 'rather', 'perfect', 'looking', 'life', 'When', 'say', 'merrily', 'mean', 'actually', 'sings', 'way', 'school', 'also', 'caf', 'eacute', 'way', 'school', 'get', 'breakfast', 'coffee', 'proprietor', 'caf', 'eacute', 'friend', 'Saya', 'father', 'When', 'night', 'Saya', 'father', 'been', 'monster', 'sighting', 'town', 'kill', 'monster', 'monsters', 'are', 'called', 'elder', 'bairns', 'are', 'very', 'unusual', 'looking', 'one', 'unique', 'look', 'such', 'eyeball', 'monster', 'plant', 'monster', 'statue', 'shadow', 'being', 'many', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'explain', 'detail', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'episodes', 'seem', 'kind', 'benign', 'first', 'episode', '3', '4', 'series', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'new', 'developments.This', 'series', 'probably', 'one', 'true', 'horror', 'anime', 'recent', 'years', 'unsettling', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'small', 'town', 'yields', 'uncertainty', 'viewer', 'background', 'music', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'mood', 'horrific', 'show', 'Also', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'viewer', 'pumped', 'upcoming', 'episode', 'only', 'music', 'questionable', 'overly', 'happy', 'sounding', 'music', 'used', 'next', 'episode', 'previews', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'just', 'inappropriate', 'have', 'such', 'cheery', 'music', 'when', 'episode', 'actually', 'giant', 'centipede', 'monster', 'eating', 'girl', 'head', 'off.As', 'mentioned', 'anime', 'very', 'violent', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'watched', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'fact', 'Originally', 'thought', 'most', 'violence', 'would', 'be', 'monsters', 'especially', 'learned', 'Clamp', 'worked', 'show', 'figured', 'worked', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'absolute', 'blood', 'bath', 'Sure', 'not', 'too', 'violent', 'first', 'then', 'watched', 'episode', '6', 'changed', 'lot', 'things', 'knew', 'show', 'One', 'good', 'aspect', 'violence', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'anime', 'are', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'especially', 'fight', 'scene', 'final', 'episode.Blood', 'C', 'distributed', 'Funimation', 'feel', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'one', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'different', 'special', 'features', 'collection', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'are', 'bloody', 'anime', 'Hellsing', 'Ultimate', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'title', 'out']",N/A

I also need to point out that I know all the previous Blood Vampire stories ( the anime movie, Blood+, and the live action movie) so I didn't go into this one blind. That being said, even going into to this series blind would not change the fact that this series is a mess in terms of story. It is bland, boring, and predictable to the point that it's insulting to the viewer's intelligence. What really makes me hate this anime is the way it ended though. While the ending was predictable enough, the tone of it made me have flashbacks to another awful anime's ending called 'Master of Martial Hearts'.

Saya is supposed to be the same character, but, even if the character is the same, the circumstances between each version of ""Saya"" is different. That being said, this is NOT the same Saya. Don't expect it.Perhaps the only way you could connect her to Blood+ Saya is that she doesn't remember anything (memory suppressed) and, as usual, carries a sword. The protagonists are no longer other vampires, but ""Old Ones"" that are given a time and number of humans that they have ""contracted"" to eat. You don't know this for, hell, most of the show, but it is important.Furthermore, this is a CLAMP version, so you have the beautifully drawn, cutesy CLAMP characters doing god awful things. No one is innocent in this anime. Don't expect it to end well.I will say this: maybe because it's a CLAMP world, the addition of Watanuki from XXXholic seemed weird. Also, they are (again) cutesy CLAMP art... so the fact they are doing some of THE MOST gruesome things I've seen in anime in a long time might be because it struck me wrong. Cutesy girls and boys in darling and gorgeous school uniforms shouldn't die like that. And I've seen a lot of just awful movies/anime/manga/books in general, but that scene with the twins just hit me completely wrong.Any way, this is the precursor to the Blood C movie, and it explains why Saya has to kill the main villain and his fascination with her. This is NOT the same universe as the other Sayas, so DON'T EXPECT IT TO ACT THE SAME. It's a CLAMP universe, it ACTS like a CLAMP universe, and you have to treat it as such. We're talking Wish and Clover, and (IMO) X/1999, which was convoluted as hell but (to ME) had no point.I also don't think there was a real need for character development because of the village set up and the circumstances surrounding the characters, but explaining that would require spoilers. Basically, this was weird, but if you're dedicated to the franchise and just HAVE to watch/read everything that it puts out (like me), then just bear with it. It's not god awful, but you really are not getting a well-rounded story like Blood+. Just accept it, watch the movie, and move on.

1601958,AS77LVLUSX18R,B009T3ADGA,Roy Basilisk,"[1, 1]","Blood C may well be among the toughest recent anime series to review.  It is an initially deceptively pretty, slow-burn show that builds up to a bold and very mature climax, interspersed with some of the best action sequences put to anime.  The difficulty in recommending this for a general mature audience is to what extent any individual can get a feeling for some eventual and major (and violent) surprises that are hinted at, or indeed whether one wanted that kind of shift in the first place.  It is two kinds of shows joined together in a deliberately uncomfortable fashion.Given that one understands that all may not be as it seems--and that some unrelentingly MA-rated violence might occur to any character--the adventurous anime viewer may very well find this as excellent as not just a few others have.  It is hard to say much more without spoilers.What also helps the show is splendid visuals, hard-hitting sound and music, and an excellent English dub cast.  Lead Saya starts off as an exuberant girl who sings on her way to school, passing by lush green countryside by day...yet at night stoically confronts village-threatening beasts in gloriously severe blood-soaked battles. Over the course of the show this oddly dual nature of the character and environment will be explored.  The more pedestrian but exquisitely animated movie sequel &#34;The Last Dark&#34; follows from the series.Blu-ray visual quality is solid and works around a show that is soft and often pastel colorful, but some banding will be immediately evident even early in the first episode.  Audio effects and forboding music are potent in action scenes, yet at other times focused smartly on tense ambient sounds.  Featured are some always-welcome English dub commentaries and a secondary dvd version of the series.  Lastly, this has a reversible cover that even retains a title on the spine.",5,"Understandably polarizing, but the adventurous should check out this excellent series",1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1876,"['Blood', 'C', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'toughest', 'recent', 'anime', 'series', 'review', 'initially', 'deceptively', 'pretty', 'slow-burn', 'show', 'up', 'bold', 'very', 'mature', 'climax', 'interspersed', 'best', 'action', 'sequences', 'put', 'anime', 'difficulty', 'recommending', 'general', 'mature', 'audience', 'what', 'extent', 'individual', 'can', 'get', 'feeling', 'eventual', 'major', 'violent', 'are', 'hinted', 'indeed', 'one', 'wanted', 'kind', 'shift', 'first', 'place', 'two', 'kinds', 'shows', 'joined', 'together', 'deliberately', 'uncomfortable', 'fashion.Given', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'unrelentingly', 'MA-rated', 'violence', 'might', 'occur', 'character', 'adventurous', 'anime', 'viewer', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'find', 'as', 'excellent', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'hard', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'spoilers.What', 'also', 'show', 'splendid', 'visuals', 'hard-hitting', 'sound', 'music', 'excellent', 'English', 'dub', 'cast', 'Lead', 'Saya', 'off', 'exuberant', 'girl', 'who', 'way', 'school', 'passing', 'lush', 'green', 'countryside', 'day', 'yet', 'night', 'stoically', 'village-threatening', 'beasts', 'gloriously', 'severe', 'blood-soaked', 'battles', 'course', 'show', 'oddly', 'dual', 'nature', 'character', 'environment', 'will', 'be', 'explored', 'more', 'pedestrian', 'exquisitely', 'animated', 'movie', 'sequel', '34', 'Last', 'Dark', '34', 'series.Blu-ray', 'visual', 'quality', 'solid', 'around', 'show', 'soft', 'often', 'pastel', 'colorful', 'banding', 'will', 'be', 'immediately', 'evident', 'even', 'early', 'first', 'episode', 'Audio', 'effects', 'forboding', 'music', 'are', 'potent', 'action', 'scenes', 'yet', 'other', 'times', 'focused', 'smartly', 'tense', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'Featured', 'are', 'always-welcome', 'English', 'dub', 'commentaries', 'secondary', 'dvd', 'version', 'series', 'Lastly', 'reversible', 'cover', 'even', 'title', 'spine']",N/A

I had heard it was created by CLAMP and had high expectations based on some of their other works that I'm a fan of (Tokyo Babylon, xxxHolic).  On the writing front, Blood C did not deliver.  It's only on rewatching the series in this HD uncensored release that I appreciate the show's true strength: gruesome bloody fan-service.  With lots of blood.This is a simple one-dimensional show, but that doesn't mean it's not a lot of fun (assuming you're into blood and gore and monsters and horror, made all the better for ditching the censorship entirely that was there when I first watched it streaming)It's worth noting that Blood C doesn't really try to connect itself to any parts of the Blood franchise that came before it.  I didn't notice any references to Blood or Blood + being made (in my opinion a good thing), so anyone new to the franchise can pick up the show fine....is what I'd like to say, but one major CLAMP character makes an appearance: Watanuki from xxxHolic.  It's fine to watch without knowing who he is however, as he doesn't really play that big a role.The show comes with both English and Japanese audio, and it's nice that they managed to get Watanuki's voice actor to reprise the role even though xxxHolic was dropped prematurely in America.  That said, I feel the Japanese audio is the superior version.  It's nice to have it available though.The only thing left to mention is that the show ends on a cliff hanger.

At first I wasn't going to buy this due to all the negative feedback about this series and I honest with you when I watch the first two episode I fell asleep. (Due to me pre-order this so I was waiting for the English dub)Plot:Saya Kisaragi is a seemingly-normal girl who is overly clumsy and kind. She lives with her father, the head of her hometown's shrine, and learns the ""art of the sword"" from him. When she is faced with various forms of ""trials"" that test her kindness, it brings misfortune for her being ""overly-kind"". Against misfortune and for the sake of her friends, she maintains her kind heart and becomes stronger. However, in her journey, how will she fare? Why is she being tested?But What all I see or hear is that because, many people that seen Blood+ compared this series to it as well.But many don't seem to realize is this not a sequel or a ripoff it's apart of the Blood Franchise.Blood The Last&#65279; Vampire :The original animated movie.Blood+Blood the Last Vampire: Live actionBlood-C (The current on going series for the Blood franchise)Also Saya is always the protagonist for each series. I hope this clears up the confusion for you.To me: How has never seen Blood+ or any of the Blood franchise, decided to give this a shot a hoped for the best.  It started out as simple, not quite understanding  the storyline for this series. There was a lot of flaws that probably could of been fix or explains what was going on,however it too half the series or by the end to understand what was going on. But by then many viewers choose to give up and wonder why they even bother why they even decided to flip the switch to this series in the first place.The characters are a given info about the background story, but they many different and loveable at but when watch on a little bit longer a see a another side to them.There's a lot of gore and volience in this series so if your into series like Elfen Lied you follow the same aspect here as well.To me after watching this series I felt that it had problem and major flaws but it certainly  wasn't wasting my time. I glad funimation along with many other companies decided to do the same. I honest can't wait for the movie to continue this. It had flaws but definitely not as bad as people claim it to be. I say give it&#65279; a try at least and watch it till the very end to get your opinions on the matter. If it leaves it you with questions or wanting more you'll have a movie to look forward too which i heard turn out great called Blood-C: The Last DarkHowever, the movie earned US$409,000 in Japan during its opening week [23] and entered the Japanese box office at No. 10.[24] It also won the jury L'&Eacute;cran Fantastique Prize at the Montreal Fantasia Film Festival for its ""horrifying Lovecraftian bestiary, as well as attention to textures and lighting.""",5,Not as bad as people said it would be.lol,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,2988,"['do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'hating', 'series', 'be', 'honest', 'thought', 'anime', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'plot', 'twists', 'got', 'good', 'damn', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'buy', 'due', 'negative', 'feedback', 'series', 'honest', 'when', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'episode', 'fell', 'asleep', 'Due', 'pre-order', 'so', 'was', 'waiting', 'English', 'dub', 'Plot', 'Saya', 'Kisaragi', 'seemingly-normal', 'girl', 'who', 'overly', 'clumsy', 'kind', 'father', 'head', 'hometown', 'shrine', 'art', 'sword', 'When', 'faced', 'various', 'forms', 'trials', 'test', 'kindness', 'misfortune', 'being', 'overly-kind', 'Against', 'misfortune', 'sake', 'friends', 'kind', 'heart', 'becomes', 'stronger', 'However', 'journey', 'how', 'will', 'fare', 'Why', 'being', 'tested', 'What', 'see', 'hear', 'many', 'people', 'seen', 'Blood+', 'compared', 'series', 'well.But', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'not', 'sequel', 'ripoff', 'apart', 'Blood', 'Franchise.Blood', 'Last', '65279', 'Vampire', 'original', 'animated', 'movie.Blood+Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'Live', 'actionBlood-C', 'current', 'going', 'series', 'Blood', 'franchise', 'Also', 'Saya', 'always', 'protagonist', 'series', 'hope', 'up', 'confusion', 'you.To', 'never', 'seen', 'Blood+', 'Blood', 'franchise', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'hoped', 'best', 'started', 'out', 'simple', 'not', 'quite', 'understanding', 'storyline', 'series', 'was', 'lot', 'flaws', 'probably', 'could', 'been', 'fix', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'however', 'too', 'series', 'end', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'then', 'many', 'viewers', 'choose', 'give', 'up', 'wonder', 'why', 'even', 'bother', 'why', 'even', 'decided', 'flip', 'switch', 'series', 'first', 'place.The', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'info', 'background', 'story', 'many', 'different', 'loveable', 'when', 'watch', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'see', 'side', 'them.There', 'lot', 'gore', 'volience', 'series', 'so', 'series', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'follow', 'same', 'aspect', 'here', 'well.To', 'watching', 'series', 'felt', 'had', 'problem', 'major', 'flaws', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'wasting', 'time', 'glad', 'funimation', 'many', 'other', 'companies', 'decided', 'do', 'same', 'honest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'continue', 'had', 'flaws', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'claim', 'be', 'say', 'give', '65279', 'try', 'least', 'watch', 'till', 'very', 'end', 'get', 'opinions', 'matter', 'questions', 'wanting', 'more', ""'ll"", 'have', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'too', 'i', 'heard', 'turn', 'out', 'great', 'called', 'Blood-C', 'Last', 'DarkHowever', 'movie', 'earned', 'US', '409,000', 'Japan', 'opening', 'week', '[', '23', ']', 'entered', 'Japanese', 'box', 'office', 'No', '10', '[', '24', ']', 'also', 'won', 'jury', 'L', 'Eacute', 'cran', 'Fantastique', 'Prize', 'Montreal', 'Fantasia', 'Film', 'Festival', 'horrifying', 'Lovecraftian', 'bestiary', 'as', 'well', 'attention', 'textures', 'lighting']",N/A

Now perhaps I am wrong but what I have read about the movie (it hasn't been subbed as far as I know) is that it picks up right after the last episode. So it really seems that despite the series lacking in story line or any of the other issues that it does have, I am not fighting that, it seems that CLAMP is trying to do what Blood the Last Vampire didn't do, which is to give you that back story. And that is the way I have seen Blood C going. I watched it knowing that it was more or less a pre-story for the movie and while it is gory (someone said it was like Elfen Lied, it is that gory but not as.. revealing if you catch my drift) and there are the highschool drama moments (which Blood+ did have a few though they were more teenager drama) I think it was still pretty good.
