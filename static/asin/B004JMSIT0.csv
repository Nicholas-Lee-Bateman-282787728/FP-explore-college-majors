1411532,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004JMSIT0,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[21, 21]","It's 1929, this farce of event/mishaps occurs at a Yorkshire undertaking business. It's OK to laugh. Ownership is now through Widow Ivy (Dame Thora Hird-`Hallelujah!'). Of course she's funny. She's got her ways, her religion, her controlling manner, and her nephew. Her nephew Billy (Christopher Beeny-`Upstairs Downstairs') tries to help, not always to Auntie's satisfaction. He also likes the ladies, a conflict with Aunt Ivy's desire, and a cause for as much of the humor as caskets. But clumsy Billy has his ways to snag a lassie now and then. Lancashire has always been lovely to see, but not always this funny. Go ahead; it's OK to laugh while visiting the funeral home this time.Toss in Ernie (Colin Farrell-`Lytton's Diary'), a friend of Billy and laugh some more. All three of the top stars had time spent on the series ""Last of the Summer Wine.""This set is just the beginning season of a long-running comedy show (1979-1986.) It contains 7 episodes, each averaging about 25 minutes. Plenty of mishaps in this Series 1, and hopefully there will be more to come in the future.
