I wish they had more shows like it on tv now. This tv show had some great morals in it and talked about a lot of the tough issues that the world is dealing with. It has the morals about right and wrong. I have seen every episode of the show and just about memorized. I recorded them on vhs tapes but have about worn them all out. That is why I have purchased all the seasons on dvd. The picture quality is a lot better than the vhs tapes which made it even more rewarding to get this series on dvd. I have a list of the episodes of this season. The episodes are:Disc One1.) Blown Apart2.) Deep Cover3.) The Guardians4.) Collision CourseDisc Two1.)Point After2.) Evil In The Night3.) Final Justice4.) The LynchingDisc Three1.) Whitewater Parts 1&22.) The Covenant3.)RodeoDisc Four1.) Flashpoint2.)Break In3.)The Return Of Larue4.) The JuggernautDisc Five1.) El Coyote Part One2.) El Coyote Part Two3.) The Avenger4.) Behind The BadgeDisc Six1.) Blackout2.) Deadline3.) The Siege4.) The Moscow ConnectionDisc Seven1.) Miracle At Middle Creek2.) Hall Of FameThis is all of the episodes that are on season three. I enjoyed them all and have no least favorites. I would highly recommend anyone watching this series and getting it on dvd. I have not regretted a minute purchasing this series on dvd. I am really happy that they finally released all of the seasons on dvd. It is a must buy for any Walker Texas Ranger fans or Chuck Norris Fans. I am also a Chuck Norris fan I also have a lot of his movies on dvd as well.

1058827,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000NOIX84,Taheen Lopez,"[0, 0]","Three seasons of this police drama that ran on CBS from 1993-01, dispensing his own brand of roundhouse-kicking justice have not slowed Texas Ranger Cordell Walker (Chuck Norris). As an appreciative observer remarks at one point during season 3, ""You still have all the moves, Walker."" Whether going undercover as a cocaine dealer in Miami or ""delivering a little pain"" against white supremacists, Russian mobsters, street gangs, IRA terrorists, heroin smugglers, or vengeful ex-convicts,Walker is ""a damn one-man army"" who ""walks the walk and talks the talk."" No one delivers Chuck-isms such as, ""The bigger they are, the harder they hit"" like Norris. Walker,This 1994-95 Season is a bit edgier than its first 2 seasons with cruder language and more graphic action.For instance, the episode ""The Juggernaut,"" about a wife beater terrorizing a woman's support group, is particularly rough stuff. In the explosive 3rd Season opener, ""Blown Apart,"" a Bible-quoting mad bomber unleashes a holocaust of fiery destruction that even Walker cannot defuse in time.Among this 1994-1995 Season's most memorable episodes is ""Final Justice,"" in which Walker discovers that the man who killed his parents when he was a kid is still alive, leading to a most dangerous game in which Walker becomes the prey of this hunt-happy racist (John Vernon).In the ""Deep Cover,"" episode, Walker partners up with a female cop(Kathy Long), who, as an actress, makes a great world champion kickboxer. ""Blackout"" opens intriguingly with an amnesiac Walker waking up in a casino office clad in a tuxedo, holding a gun and lying next to a dead body. Chuck Norris commentary would have been a real kick, but then again, he is a man of action, and this season does deliver for Walker fans.It's also nice to see WALKER TEXAS RANGER complete, uncut, and commercial-free without all those you get on this show on TV Land, WGN, Hallmark, and USA.",3,Walker Texas Ranger Rules,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,1908,"['Three', 'seasons', 'police', 'drama', 'ran', 'CBS', '1993-01', 'dispensing', 'own', 'brand', 'roundhouse-kicking', 'justice', 'have', 'not', 'slowed', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Cordell', 'Walker', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'appreciative', 'observer', 'remarks', 'one', 'point', 'season', '3', 'still', 'have', 'moves', 'Walker', 'going', 'undercover', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'Miami', 'delivering', 'little', 'pain', 'white', 'supremacists', 'Russian', 'mobsters', 'street', 'gangs', 'IRA', 'terrorists', 'heroin', 'smugglers', 'vengeful', 'ex-convicts', 'Walker', 'damn', 'one-man', 'army', 'who', 'walks', 'walk', 'talk', 'one', 'Chuck-isms', 'such', 'bigger', 'are', 'harder', 'hit', 'Norris', 'Walker', '1994-95', 'Season', 'bit', 'edgier', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'cruder', 'language', 'more', 'graphic', 'action.For', 'instance', 'episode', 'Juggernaut', 'wife', 'beater', 'terrorizing', 'woman', 'support', 'group', 'particularly', 'rough', 'stuff', 'explosive', '3rd', 'Season', 'opener', 'Blown', 'Apart', 'Bible-quoting', 'mad', 'bomber', 'holocaust', 'fiery', 'destruction', 'even', 'Walker', 'can', 'not', 'defuse', 'time.Among', '1994-1995', 'Season', 'most', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'Final', 'Justice', 'Walker', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'parents', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'still', 'alive', 'leading', 'most', 'dangerous', 'game', 'Walker', 'prey', 'hunt-happy', 'racist', 'John', 'Vernon', '.In', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'episode', 'Walker', 'partners', 'up', 'female', 'cop', 'Kathy', 'Long', 'who', 'actress', 'great', 'world', 'champion', 'kickboxer', 'intriguingly', 'amnesiac', 'Walker', 'waking', 'up', 'casino', 'office', 'clad', 'tuxedo', 'holding', 'gun', 'lying', 'next', 'dead', 'body', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'kick', 'then', 'again', 'man', 'action', 'season', 'deliver', 'Walker', 'fans.It', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'WALKER', 'TEXAS', 'RANGER', 'complete', 'uncut', 'commercial-free', 'get', 'show', 'TV', 'Land', 'WGN', 'Hallmark', 'USA']","Walker, Texas Ranger: Season 3"
