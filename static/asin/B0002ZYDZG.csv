853802,A34PAZQ73SL163,B0002ZYDZG,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[9, 10]","This DVD is a must for any poker fan. The pros are a pleasure to listen to. In my mind, Daniel Negreanu was the best part. Basically, hearing him speak, regardless of the venue, is a great pleasure. He is one of the few pros who give you the sensation, whenever he speaks, that he is telling you the whole truth. His confidence in his abilities causes him to have no reason to fear fully sharing information with lower functioning players like us. I also got a kick out of Scotty Nguyen because he was warm and friendly which is not how I imagined him to be. As for John Bonnetti, that guy's a hoot. He's completely old school and I bet few people want to go toe to toe with him. Jennifer Harmon repeats some of the same solid advice she gives in Super System II: play fewer hands, and don't experiment with junk. I wish some of the micro-limit jerks who draw out on me would take some notes. You know, I'm a fan of T.J. Cloutier, and, once again, he does not disappoint or cheat the little man because he shares valuable information throughout his interview. He points out that you should not be a 1 bet, ""All In!"" guy. The good player manipulates and squeezes money out of his opponents throughout, and sets up situations where he can get some calls.With all of the expertise and wonderful insight, the DVD deserves five stars, but I have to detract one due to the program host. She's absolutely worthless, and will not shut the heck up. Frankly, I found her to be an utter fool. Apparently, she considers herself the equal of these players and will not keep her mouth or agenda out of the interviews. She is obsessed with finding a way to get more women into poker. Oh, this tremendous stupidity and the constant, ""Women can do it!"" garbage becomes painful as she insists on wasting everyone's time with it.I'm going to explain why there aren't more female poker players overall, and I hope she reads my explanation so she can learn something. Men, on the aggregate, are more thrill-seeking than women. This is true in regards to sex, drugs, or gambling. Men are always found in the more dangerous and risky professions, no matter of what society you reference. Males are also far more competitive, on average, than are women. These are global differences. There's no question that some outliers like Jennifer Harmon are every bit as good as any man, but, due to poker appealing more uniquely to the male character traits, those involved in the endeavor will be predominantly male. If the narrator of the DVD continues to doubt this, she should check on the gender of those who purchase Poker Secrets of the Champs.",4,Get Out Some Paper and Take Notes!,1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,2618,"['DVD', 'must', 'poker', 'fan', 'pros', 'are', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'mind', 'Daniel', 'Negreanu', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'Basically', 'hearing', 'speak', 'regardless', 'venue', 'great', 'pleasure', 'one', 'few', 'pros', 'who', 'give', 'sensation', 'whenever', 'telling', 'whole', 'truth', 'confidence', 'abilities', 'have', 'reason', 'fear', 'fully', 'sharing', 'information', 'lower', 'functioning', 'players', 'also', 'got', 'kick', 'Scotty', 'Nguyen', 'was', 'warm', 'friendly', 'not', 'how', 'imagined', 'be', 'John', 'Bonnetti', 'guy', 'hoot', 'completely', 'old', 'school', 'bet', 'few', 'people', 'want', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'Jennifer', 'Harmon', 'same', 'solid', 'advice', 'Super', 'System', 'II', 'play', 'fewer', 'hands', 'do', ""n't"", 'experiment', 'junk', 'wish', 'micro-limit', 'jerks', 'who', 'draw', 'out', 'would', 'take', 'notes', 'know', ""'m"", 'fan', 'T.J.', 'Cloutier', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'disappoint', 'cheat', 'little', 'man', 'shares', 'valuable', 'information', 'interview', 'out', 'should', 'not', 'be', '1', 'bet', 'guy', 'good', 'player', 'manipulates', 'squeezes', 'money', 'opponents', 'up', 'situations', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'calls.With', 'expertise', 'wonderful', 'insight', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'have', 'detract', 'one', 'due', 'program', 'host', 'absolutely', 'worthless', 'will', 'not', 'shut', 'heck', 'up', 'Frankly', 'found', 'be', 'utter', 'fool', 'Apparently', 'equal', 'players', 'will', 'not', 'keep', 'mouth', 'agenda', 'interviews', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'way', 'get', 'more', 'women', 'poker', 'Oh', 'tremendous', 'stupidity', 'constant', 'Women', 'can', 'do', 'garbage', 'painful', 'wasting', 'everyone', 'time', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'explain', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'female', 'poker', 'players', 'overall', 'hope', 'explanation', 'can', 'learn', 'something', 'Men', 'aggregate', 'are', 'more', 'thrill-seeking', 'women', 'true', 'regards', 'sex', 'drugs', 'gambling', 'Men', 'are', 'always', 'found', 'more', 'dangerous', 'risky', 'professions', 'matter', 'what', 'society', 'reference', 'Males', 'are', 'also', 'far', 'more', 'competitive', 'average', 'are', 'women', 'are', 'global', 'differences', 'question', 'outliers', 'Jennifer', 'Harmon', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'man', 'due', 'poker', 'appealing', 'more', 'uniquely', 'male', 'character', 'traits', 'involved', 'endeavor', 'will', 'be', 'predominantly', 'male', 'narrator', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'should', 'check', 'gender', 'who', 'purchase', 'Poker', 'Secrets', 'Champs']",Poker Secrets From Poker Champs

853804,A2XGFPVV6P815H,B0002ZYDZG,J. Rubino,"[12, 12]","With so much ""junk"" coming out all of the time I did'nt really know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Not so much with any great poker secrets but just the great cross section of input from 15 different world class players. The host, Susie Isaacs is a long time CardPlayer magazine writer and contributor and if you have been around for a while you know she has elevated her game by hanging out with some knowledgeable players. Specifically one of the later players in the interviews, Ron Stanly was her poker coach and mentor for a while and she credits him for her WSOP success. Also, this video is a DVD copy of the VHS version and was done about 4 or so years ago based on Daniel Negreanu stating his age of 26 (he is now 30). If you are a big televised poker fan you know that Negreanu went on an absolute terror in 2004 capturing the WSOP Player of the Year and CardPlayer Magazine Player of the Year, so these interviews pre-date that amazing feat by 2 1/2 -3 1/2 years. Interesting that these players are pretty much still on the top of their games. The only one you might not know is Ron Stanly because he is a fairly low profile Vegas pro. It definitely could have used a little better editing but for Amazon.coms price of around $10.00 I think it is worth adding to you DVD collection. It is mostly tips and stories of how each player won their WSOP and other poker titles with a sprinkling of mostly beginner player poker advice. There are enough insights to make it interesting and worthwhile as long as you know ahead what you are buying.",4,better than I expected,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,1562,"['so', 'much', 'junk', 'coming', 'time', ""did'nt"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'poker', 'secrets', 'just', 'great', 'cross', 'section', 'input', '15', 'different', 'world', 'class', 'players', 'host', 'Susie', 'Isaacs', 'long', 'time', 'CardPlayer', 'magazine', 'writer', 'contributor', 'have', 'been', 'while', 'know', 'elevated', 'game', 'hanging', 'out', 'knowledgeable', 'players', 'Specifically', 'one', 'later', 'players', 'interviews', 'Ron', 'Stanly', 'was', 'poker', 'coach', 'mentor', 'while', 'WSOP', 'success', 'Also', 'video', 'DVD', 'copy', 'VHS', 'version', 'was', 'done', 'about', '4', 'so', 'years', 'ago', 'based', 'Daniel', 'Negreanu', 'stating', 'age', '26', 'now', '30', 'are', 'big', 'televised', 'poker', 'fan', 'know', 'Negreanu', 'went', 'absolute', 'terror', '2004', 'capturing', 'WSOP', 'Player', 'Year', 'CardPlayer', 'Magazine', 'Player', 'Year', 'interviews', 'pre-date', 'amazing', 'feat', '2', '1/2', '-3', '1/2', 'years', 'Interesting', 'players', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'still', 'top', 'games', 'only', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'Ron', 'Stanly', 'fairly', 'low', 'profile', 'Vegas', 'pro', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'better', 'editing', 'Amazon.coms', 'price', '10.00', 'think', 'worth', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection', 'mostly', 'tips', 'stories', 'how', 'player', 'won', 'WSOP', 'other', 'poker', 'titles', 'sprinkling', 'mostly', 'beginner', 'player', 'poker', 'advice', 'are', 'enough', 'insights', 'make', 'interesting', 'worthwhile', 'as', 'long', 'know', 'ahead', 'what', 'are', 'buying']",Poker Secrets From Poker Champs

There is some entertainment value here to see Negreanu and Ivey before they became poker superstars.I enjoyed the DVD very much and it has a long running time of about 3 hours, so you get plenty of interviews and information. This DVD will not make you a great player, but it might motivate you to try to become a great player. Hearing world champion players tell you how to make it in the poker world is interesting and helpful. Their advice is incomplete and you would need to search many of the good poker books to fill in any gaps in stuff you don't understand if you are a new player, like playing position, starting hands, etc.Overall, you have numerous poker players talking poker. If it appeals to you to hear Scotty Nguyen, T.J. cloutier, Phil Ivey, Daniel Negreanu..and on and on, then this would be a great DVD to add to your collection. If you are looking for a DVD to teach you how to play poker or you are a new player seeking information, I would recommend one of the Howard Lederer DVDs for that.",5,Great Poker Stories,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,1130,"['DVD', 'tons', 'big', 'name', 'professional', 'poker', 'players', 'telling', 'various', 'stories', 'giving', 'tips', 'here', 'there', 'entertainment', 'value', 'here', 'see', 'Negreanu', 'Ivey', 'became', 'poker', 'superstars.I', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'about', '3', 'hours', 'get', 'plenty', 'interviews', 'information', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'great', 'player', 'might', 'motivate', 'try', 'become', 'great', 'player', 'Hearing', 'world', 'champion', 'players', 'tell', 'how', 'make', 'poker', 'world', 'interesting', 'helpful', 'advice', 'incomplete', 'would', 'need', 'search', 'many', 'good', 'poker', 'books', 'fill', 'gaps', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'are', 'new', 'player', 'playing', 'position', 'starting', 'hands', 'etc.Overall', 'have', 'numerous', 'poker', 'players', 'talking', 'poker', 'appeals', 'hear', 'Scotty', 'Nguyen', 'T.J.', 'cloutier', 'Phil', 'Ivey', 'Daniel', 'Negreanu..and', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection', 'are', 'looking', 'DVD', 'teach', 'how', 'play', 'poker', 'are', 'new', 'player', 'seeking', 'information', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'Howard', 'Lederer', 'DVDs']",Poker Secrets From Poker Champs
