1192424,A1T8N18XKDLJO4,B001FW2R4E,B. Aikens,"[1, 1]","If all goes wrong is being touted as a live concert dvd, but i believe that is a mislabel. It is more of a documentary (which should be required viewing to fully appreciate the concert dvd)and then they throw in a concert on the 2nd dvd in the set. If all goes wrong is all about the residencies in Asheville and San Francisco, if you are looking for anything further than that music wise then I say look elsewhere. There are no big hits like ""bullet with butterfly wings"" ""cherub rock"" ""Disarm"" or any of the big Pumpkin hits. The documentary highlights the new songs that were written during the residencies and focus's completely on where those songs came from and what Corgan's train of thought was when he wrote each one. It is a honest and truthful look at the song writing process Corgan went through in order to pen each one. Aside from the residency songs Gossamer is thrown in at the end of the documentary and it is explained a bit as to why it ballooned to a 37 minute jam fest. Overall the documentary is excellent and i would give it 4 1/2 to 5 stars. It is interesting and is a must view for any pumpkins fan.On the other hand the concert portion is what most people will end up buying the dvd for and I'm sorry to say they will more than likely be disappointed even if, like me, they like all of the songs played. The set list in a single viewing seems to be missing something. It is ...if i dare say so kinda boring. Don't get me wrong I love most of the new residency songs. ""Peace and Love"" is excellent and should be released officially along with ""99 floors"" and ""Mama"" among others. However, here they are stripped down and along with the other songs that were picked like an alternate take on ""Blue skies bring tears"" and a stripped down ""crying tree of mercury"" there just seems to be no energy at all. I watched the concert dvd first (like I'm guessing a lot of fans will) and was greatly disappointed but then after viewing the documentary I appreciated and liked it a bit more. I still thought more should have been done about the pacing and the placement of the songs, but then again thats the point of the whole thing...they do things their way. I actually think the concert footage is excellent as long as you skip around and listen to a song here or there and then give it a bit and come back and listen to another song or two. Its definitely not something I'm gonna stick in the dvd player and watch all the way through over and over. The other fillmore rehearsal versions of the songs are excellent, I only wish ""The Rose March"" would have been included in these, but overall its nice to have these more rehearsed and intimate versions as well. All in all i would give disc two a 3 to 3 1/2 star rating.In closing as an overall package I would say its a 4 out of 5 and is a must buy for any pumpkins fan. It might seem a bit disappointing at first mainly because we have all been waiting for the metro dvd for years and we get this one instead...so with that being said don't expect the metro, expect a dvd fully dedicated to the residency songs and you won't be disappointed at all.",4,Good insight into one of the world's greatest bands,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,3116,"['wrong', 'being', 'touted', 'live', 'concert', 'dvd', 'i', 'believe', 'mislabel', 'more', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'concert', 'dvd', 'then', 'throw', 'concert', '2nd', 'dvd', 'set', 'wrong', 'residencies', 'Asheville', 'San', 'Francisco', 'are', 'looking', 'anything', 'further', 'music', 'wise', 'then', 'say', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'are', 'big', 'hits', 'bullet', 'butterfly', 'wings', 'cherub', 'rock', 'Disarm', 'big', 'Pumpkin', 'hits', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'new', 'songs', 'were', 'written', 'residencies', 'focus', 'completely', 'where', 'songs', 'came', 'what', 'Corgan', 'train', 'thought', 'was', 'when', 'wrote', 'one', 'honest', 'truthful', 'look', 'song', 'writing', 'process', 'Corgan', 'went', 'order', 'pen', 'one', 'Aside', 'residency', 'songs', 'Gossamer', 'thrown', 'end', 'documentary', 'explained', 'bit', 'why', 'ballooned', '37', 'minute', 'jam', 'fest', 'Overall', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'i', 'would', 'give', '4', '1/2', '5', 'stars', 'interesting', 'must', 'view', 'pumpkins', 'fan.On', 'other', 'hand', 'concert', 'portion', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'even', 'like', 'songs', 'played', 'set', 'list', 'single', 'viewing', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'i', 'dare', 'say', 'so', 'kinda', 'boring', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'most', 'new', 'residency', 'songs', 'Peace', 'Love', 'excellent', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'officially', '99', 'floors', 'Mama', 'others', 'However', 'here', 'are', 'stripped', 'down', 'other', 'songs', 'were', 'picked', 'alternate', 'take', 'Blue', 'skies', 'bring', 'tears', 'stripped', 'crying', 'tree', 'mercury', 'there', 'just', 'be', 'energy', 'watched', 'concert', 'dvd', 'first', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'lot', 'fans', 'will', 'was', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'then', 'viewing', 'documentary', 'appreciated', 'liked', 'bit', 'more', 'still', 'thought', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'pacing', 'placement', 'songs', 'then', 'again', 'point', 'whole', 'thing', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'actually', 'think', 'concert', 'footage', 'excellent', 'as', 'long', 'skip', 'around', 'listen', 'song', 'here', 'there', 'then', 'give', 'bit', 'come', 'back', 'listen', 'song', 'two', 'definitely', 'not', 'something', ""'m"", 'gon', 'stick', 'dvd', 'player', 'watch', 'way', 'over', 'other', 'fillmore', 'rehearsal', 'versions', 'songs', 'are', 'excellent', 'only', 'wish', 'Rose', 'March', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'overall', 'nice', 'have', 'more', 'rehearsed', 'intimate', 'versions', 'well', 'i', 'would', 'give', 'disc', 'two', '3', '3', '1/2', 'star', 'rating.In', 'closing', 'overall', 'package', 'would', 'say', '4', '5', 'must', 'buy', 'pumpkins', 'fan', 'might', 'seem', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'first', 'mainly', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'metro', 'dvd', 'years', 'get', 'one', 'instead', 'so', 'being', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'metro', 'expect', 'dvd', 'fully', 'dedicated', 'residency', 'songs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Smashing Pumpkins - If All Goes Wrong

I really shows a ""behind-the-scenes"" look at the post reunion band during the first part of their tour. It is neat to hear songs for the first time ever on here and being able to watch Billy Corgan as he writes the songs almost on camera. The 2nd disc was also very fun to watch, it was songs taken from the very shows that the documentary was about.I will add one more thing, if you are not a fan of The Smashing Pumpkins or if you are expecting a lot of the old band, then you might not enjoy this very much. Otherwise it is worth the watch.",5,Great film for Pumpkins fans!!!,1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,631,"['long-time', 'fan', 'Smashing', 'Pumpkins', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'docu-film', 'really', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'post', 'reunion', 'band', 'first', 'part', 'tour', 'neat', 'hear', 'songs', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'here', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'Billy', 'Corgan', 'songs', 'almost', 'camera', '2nd', 'disc', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'songs', 'taken', 'very', 'documentary', 'was', 'about.I', 'will', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Smashing', 'Pumpkins', 'are', 'expecting', 'lot', 'old', 'band', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'Otherwise', 'watch']",Smashing Pumpkins - If All Goes Wrong

I thought it was a gimmick, but I was surprised at how sharp the image quality turned out.Disc 1:If All Goes Wrong (Documentary) - It's interesting following the Pumpkins and seeing what they went through after they reformed and and performed for the first time. The DVD shows what inspired Billy to write some new material. It also gives a new insight into Billy, which I appreciate as a fan. I was a little disappointed at how little attention was paid to the new band members, but they must have been shy anyway.Interview with Peter Townshend - I enjoyed this feature very much as he talks about the psychology of artists, fans, and how they interact.The Voice of the Children was just some fans talking about the band with the following depth: ""I excited to be here. Broke, but excited."" It was just a nonsense of excitement.Disc 2:This disc is live performance of some of the new material that was written just after they reformed. Half of it is acoustic and most of it is slow pace, lacking much energy or emotion - that is to say that there is no surrounding sound expression as in how the Pumpkins previously sounded. The Heavy Metal Machine version here sounds much different than the original - I'm not fond of it. The two standouts are the hard rocking Gossamer at about 30 minutes long, and Superchrist.It was worth it alone for the documentary in disc 1 and Gossamer of disc 2 - I'm still waiting for the mp3 of that song.",4,A new entry in the life of Billy and his Smashing Pumpkins,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,1470,"['Filmed', 'HD', 'not', 'shown', 'HD', 'thought', 'was', 'gimmick', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'sharp', 'image', 'quality', 'turned', 'out.Disc', '1', 'Goes', 'Wrong', 'Documentary', 'interesting', 'following', 'Pumpkins', 'seeing', 'what', 'went', 'reformed', 'performed', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', 'what', 'inspired', 'Billy', 'write', 'new', 'material', 'also', 'new', 'insight', 'Billy', 'appreciate', 'fan', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'how', 'little', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'new', 'band', 'members', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'shy', 'anyway.Interview', 'Peter', 'Townshend', 'enjoyed', 'feature', 'very', 'much', 'psychology', 'artists', 'fans', 'how', 'interact.The', 'Voice', 'Children', 'was', 'just', 'fans', 'talking', 'band', 'following', 'depth', 'excited', 'be', 'here', 'Broke', 'excited', 'was', 'just', 'nonsense', 'excitement.Disc', '2', 'disc', 'live', 'performance', 'new', 'material', 'was', 'written', 'just', 'reformed', 'Half', 'acoustic', 'most', 'slow', 'pace', 'lacking', 'much', 'energy', 'emotion', 'say', 'surrounding', 'sound', 'expression', 'how', 'Pumpkins', 'previously', 'sounded', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Machine', 'version', 'here', 'much', 'different', 'original', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'two', 'standouts', 'are', 'hard', 'rocking', 'Gossamer', 'about', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'Superchrist.It', 'was', 'worth', 'alone', 'documentary', 'disc', '1', 'Gossamer', 'disc', '2', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'mp3', 'song']",Smashing Pumpkins - If All Goes Wrong

The packaging superb.My copy of this work arrived in the mail yesterday.  I was able to watch the documentary.  Very well done.  What an insight to the world of progress of artistic directions and views and the frustrations that come with it.  Very stirring to me.  An evolution.  That is the most I can say about my reaction to it.  Who cares what I think there.I love how the same style of lyric writing is still being used.  It was gorgeous in the acustic pieces.  I will always love the way he expresses the words.  I'm sure I will enjoy watching the 2nd disc for the concert footage, as I love how their expertise in playing their instruments is as easy as breathing and that's exhilarating to watch.I can't edit how many stars I gave this product in the beginning before viewing the product.
