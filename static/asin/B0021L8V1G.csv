I did like the way 2 of the iron men suits were moving and the special effects. I have a feeling that Scarlett had a significant role in this movie. As a sexy, unbeatable agent. Lol I had seen what Hollywood did to her moves, she didn't blink even once(script don't allow that because in Hollywood we are the heroes and we set the rules. And rules are:America as a world dominator, world saviour,world's best bla bla bla they have the sexiest women on earth with no American descent in real life, plastic surgery, lots of make up, even more added sexiness with special effects to already pretty women and they should know at least 9 languages, marshall arts,be special agents and they should in the end win over the bad guys easily, whatever, you name it). And her moves so ummm ''very realistic''. I swear when I saw her moves in the air and all that, I was looking for defects in the movie like a cable or cord around her waist that allowed her to move freely. I don't do that usually. It was the first time that I recall when I was laughing over all these things. And then she just had to train all her moves and repeat them until it goes flawlessly. And remember real American hero kicks ass and does not blink and it all shall be paced within 1 minute. LOL. What next? Downey is not one of my favorite characters. In the first Iron man he was a lot better. But in Iron Man 2 he is so arrogant and boring I was hoping for a bad guys to kick his ***. His relationship with his lover is looking cheap, similar to other movies, where if it worked in one movie, the other ten movies will destroy it by copying all the things that once made it fun to watch. And which we loved. This movie has money, special effects but no story whatsoever, plot is terrible. Some actors could have been better. If there should be Iron Man 3, I wish it to be something set in the far far future where it has nothing to do with Downey and previous suits or actors. Like as if it is another suit by design with other upgrades. And please no rubbish. Special effects put here and there and everywhere will not go well with a bad story and characters which some of us can't and don't want to see anymore. And for the last. It is very typical of Hollywood to show off Russians like that. And who was that actor who played Russian? Mickey Rourke. I didn't like nothing about what they've done. It's just a Hollywood standards. Directors get paid, people eat this rubbish and so they think they are the most supreme race in the world? Oh please. When will there be done a real good movie by Hollywood that will not include all this ****? I'm sick and tired of all the same things.",1,Utter garbage,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,2730,"['Iron', 'Man', '2', 'ridiculously', 'stupid', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'did', 'way', '2', 'iron', 'men', 'suits', 'were', 'moving', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'feeling', 'Scarlett', 'had', 'significant', 'role', 'movie', 'sexy', 'unbeatable', 'agent', 'Lol', 'had', 'seen', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'moves', 'did', ""n't"", 'blink', 'even', 'once', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'heroes', 'set', 'rules', 'rules', 'are', 'America', 'world', 'dominator', 'world', 'saviour', 'world', 'best', 'bla', 'bla', 'bla', 'have', 'sexiest', 'women', 'earth', 'American', 'descent', 'real', 'life', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'lots', 'make', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'added', 'sexiness', 'special', 'effects', 'already', 'pretty', 'women', 'should', 'know', 'least', '9', 'languages', 'marshall', 'arts', 'be', 'special', 'agents', 'should', 'end', 'win', 'bad', 'guys', 'easily', 'whatever', 'name', 'moves', 'so', 'ummm', 'very', 'realistic', 'swear', 'when', 'saw', 'moves', 'air', 'was', 'looking', 'defects', 'movie', 'cable', 'cord', 'waist', 'allowed', 'move', 'freely', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'usually', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'recall', 'when', 'was', 'laughing', 'things', 'then', 'just', 'had', 'train', 'moves', 'repeat', 'flawlessly', 'remember', 'real', 'American', 'hero', 'kicks', 'ass', 'not', 'blink', 'shall', 'be', 'paced', '1', 'minute', 'LOL', 'What', 'Downey', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'first', 'Iron', 'man', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'so', 'arrogant', 'boring', 'was', 'hoping', 'bad', 'guys', 'kick', '***', 'relationship', 'lover', 'looking', 'cheap', 'similar', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'worked', 'one', 'movie', 'other', 'ten', 'movies', 'will', 'destroy', 'copying', 'things', 'once', 'made', 'watch', 'loved', 'movie', 'money', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'whatsoever', 'plot', 'terrible', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'wish', 'be', 'something', 'set', 'far', 'far', 'future', 'where', 'nothing', 'do', 'Downey', 'previous', 'suits', 'actors', 'suit', 'design', 'other', 'upgrades', 'please', 'rubbish', 'Special', 'effects', 'put', 'here', 'there', 'everywhere', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'well', 'bad', 'story', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'anymore', 'last', 'very', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'show', 'off', 'Russians', 'who', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Russian', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'did', ""n't"", 'nothing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'Directors', 'get', 'paid', 'people', 'eat', 'rubbish', 'so', 'think', 'are', 'most', 'supreme', 'race', 'world', 'Oh', 'please', 'When', 'will', 'there', 'be', 'done', 'real', 'good', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'not', 'include', '****', ""'m"", 'sick', 'tired', 'same', 'things']",N/A
1247842,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0021L8V1G,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[17, 26]","The best asset of a superhero franchise is when any installment lacks hubris:  either from its hero or from those who design it.  When a superhero is thrust in such peril that the outcome is in question, and the usual assumption that the good guy always wins has to be drawn back to consciousness, you know the creators have assembled a great movie.All the parts are intact:  The trajectory is fun; the enemy is menacing; the dialog is witty and clever; and the story is cogent and clear--easy enough to understand, but detailed enough to be stimulating without overloading our efforts to suspend disbelief.This time Iron Man [aka Tony Stark] (Downey Jr.) faces off with a Congressional committeeman, headed by Senator Stern (Chandling) who challenges his personal armored technology as dangerous and capable of escalating the arms race when brought to the wrong hands.  Stark's snappy answers win the day, but his lack of concessions bring a headlong, prideful fall that sends him unraveling.The Senator's witness, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell)[another arms' dealer] doesn't take his defeat in stride.  While showing off his prowess at auto race in Monaco, Stark faces his biggest challenge when an equally disgruntled Russian nemesis, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) unveils his electrifying half-man, half-human hybrid imitation.  From there Hammer builds an alliance with Vanko that makes inroads into the U.S. military, including with Stark's closest ally, Lt. Col James Rhodey (Cheadle).Of course the trajectory of the movie doesn't work without the fun.  A celebrated Iron Man must be chastened by all his handlers, including Pwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, his still wise-cracking assistant.  New to the fray is Scarlett Johansson in a refreshing, make-over role as the attractive and lethal duo identity Natalie/Natasha.  And while Stark's adolescent tendencies are not towed in line by both leading femme fatales, Cheadle and Jackson give able support.This adventure does go to the edge of danger, but not enough to fully pay dirt.  In some ways this isn't a five-star film for what I first thought were intangibles.  My first inclination was to dock the movie for its overlong half-time exposition, but that's not really fair.  An adventure movie that takes time out to think shouldn't be diminished, particularly when it delivers on the intelligence.  It also helps that Iron Man has some health/toxicity issues, thickening the plot, even if it is a dropped opportunity to provide more tension.The freshness and fun are just as apparent; it just comes down to the one factor I started out with at the beginning:  Do you have to stop and wonder (while you're clinging to someone's hand [or your chair] and sitting at the edge of your seat) how this guy is going to get out of all the mess?  What this sequel has going for it will propel it to at least two more sequels, but to have the cliffhanger feel of a sequel, like, say, 'Spider Man 2' is a bit of a stretch.",4,'Iron Man 2' Has Nearly the Same Thrust as the Original,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,2970,"['best', 'asset', 'superhero', 'franchise', 'when', 'installment', 'hubris', 'hero', 'who', 'design', 'When', 'superhero', 'thrust', 'such', 'peril', 'outcome', 'question', 'usual', 'assumption', 'good', 'guy', 'always', 'be', 'drawn', 'back', 'consciousness', 'know', 'creators', 'have', 'assembled', 'great', 'movie.All', 'parts', 'are', 'intact', 'trajectory', 'fun', 'enemy', 'menacing', 'dialog', 'witty', 'clever', 'story', 'cogent', 'clear', 'easy', 'enough', 'understand', 'detailed', 'enough', 'be', 'stimulating', 'overloading', 'efforts', 'suspend', 'disbelief.This', 'time', 'Iron', 'Man', '[', 'Tony', 'Stark', ']', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'off', 'Congressional', 'committeeman', 'headed', 'Senator', 'Stern', 'Chandling', 'who', 'personal', 'armored', 'technology', 'dangerous', 'capable', 'escalating', 'arms', 'race', 'when', 'brought', 'wrong', 'hands', 'Stark', 'snappy', 'answers', 'win', 'day', 'lack', 'concessions', 'bring', 'headlong', 'prideful', 'fall', 'unraveling.The', 'Senator', 'witness', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'arms', 'dealer', ']', ""n't"", 'take', 'defeat', 'stride', 'showing', 'off', 'prowess', 'auto', 'race', 'Monaco', 'Stark', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'when', 'equally', 'disgruntled', 'Russian', 'nemesis', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'electrifying', 'half-man', 'half-human', 'hybrid', 'imitation', 'Hammer', 'alliance', 'Vanko', 'inroads', 'U.S.', 'military', 'including', 'Stark', 'closest', 'ally', 'Lt.', 'Col', 'James', 'Rhodey', 'Cheadle', '.Of', 'course', 'trajectory', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'fun', 'celebrated', 'Iron', 'Man', 'must', 'be', 'chastened', 'handlers', 'including', 'Pwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'still', 'wise-cracking', 'assistant', 'New', 'fray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'refreshing', 'make-over', 'role', 'attractive', 'lethal', 'duo', 'identity', 'Natalie/Natasha', 'Stark', 'adolescent', 'tendencies', 'are', 'not', 'towed', 'line', 'leading', 'femme', 'fatales', 'Cheadle', 'Jackson', 'give', 'able', 'support.This', 'adventure', 'go', 'edge', 'danger', 'not', 'enough', 'fully', 'pay', 'dirt', 'ways', ""n't"", 'five-star', 'film', 'what', 'first', 'thought', 'were', 'intangibles', 'first', 'inclination', 'was', 'dock', 'movie', 'overlong', 'half-time', 'exposition', 'not', 'really', 'fair', 'adventure', 'movie', 'time', 'out', 'think', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'diminished', 'particularly', 'when', 'intelligence', 'also', 'Iron', 'Man', 'health/toxicity', 'issues', 'thickening', 'plot', 'even', 'dropped', 'opportunity', 'provide', 'more', 'tension.The', 'freshness', 'fun', 'are', 'just', 'apparent', 'just', 'down', 'one', 'factor', 'started', 'out', 'beginning', 'Do', 'have', 'stop', 'wonder', ""'re"", 'clinging', 'someone', 'hand', '[', 'chair', ']', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'how', 'guy', 'going', 'get', 'mess', 'What', 'sequel', 'going', 'will', 'propel', 'least', 'two', 'more', 'sequels', 'have', 'cliffhanger', 'feel', 'sequel', 'say', ""'Spider"", 'Man', '2', 'bit', 'stretch']",N/A

1247845,A10TRXQBELWYMF,B0021L8V1G,A. Burroughs,"[2, 6]","Although Iron Man 2 didn't quite get up to the bar set by Iron Man I, I feel it was worth the price of theater tickets to see on the big screen and well worth investing in the DVD when it's finally released (this from somebody way too cheap to pay for theater tickets or cough up for most DVD's when we can borrow them free from our library).The chemistry between Stark and Potts was as good if not better than before.  Potts character as an extremely classy, competent and pragmatic woman is built upon nicely and a positive role model for our daughters without needing to transform into a superhero herself.  Her grace and the chemistry between her and Stark (including his clumsy attempts to woo her) is the surprising reason so many -women- have been attracted to this movie.  No spoilers here, but towards the end you'll be like ""it's about time!!!""Ivan Vanko was credible as the villian ... he's evil and you're glad to see him defeated, but you understand where he is coming from.  You'll feel sad at the end as though a beautiful but viscous dog is put down because he can't be rehabilitated.  I wish they'd emphasized a tiny bit more the process by which Vanko builds his competing ""suit"" and his relationship with his pet bird as sci-fi fans like the technical stuff while women enjoy relationships that help them understand people.  It helps if you understand Russian when Vanko speaks (though Rourkes' Russian isn't that good) because some of the comments Vanko mutters under his breath in Russian that the movie never bothers to translate are actually quite funny (such as when he mutters ""sleeshcum mnoga gavariche"" to Hammer which loosely translates into ""you talk too much."")Some people have complained about the director writing himself into the script.  I didn't mind and loved when Black Widow slammed him to the floor in the boxer ring scene and also towards the end when Hogan's so pleased with himself for having defeated one security guard and then he looks around to see Black Widow has defeated a dozen more.Black Widow was great ... another strong and classy woman to inspire my daughters.  Her exposure was just about right in this movie, but I hope they highlight her character (and her kick-butt martial arts skills) quite a bit more in the upcoming Avengers.Don Cheadle was okay as Warmonger.  I liked Terrence Howard in IM1 and felt they wrote him out of the script too much when viewing the deleted scenes (to the point many things didn't make sense until viewing the deletions), so I was glad to see Cheadle fill in the details of the relationship between Stark and Rhodey in IM2.  However, since Cheadle is such a great actor, I was disappointed to see him take such a pronounced ""best buddy sidekick"" role.  Cheadle needs to be stronger as a superhero in his own right in Avengers and IM3.The Hammer character just didn't work for me ... at all.  I like him as a stand-up comic, but one or two comic interjections into the characters weaseliness would have been plenty.  One slightly-warped-has-a-sense-of-humour weapons manufacturing billionaire industrialist is plenty ... two is one too many.  The wasted time spent injecting humour into his character would have been much better spent on Stark spending time improving the suit or solving his power problem.As for Iron Man himself, he was great, but the producers focused too much on drunken incidents of Starks self-destructive behavior when he thinks he's dying and not enough on the tech-building aspect of Stark trying to solve his own problem.  Watching Robert Downey Jr. go through this same self-destructive process in real life was quite enough, thank you very much, and a good 20 minutes of IM2's drunken antics would have been better spent on other issues.  Like Downey in real life, the viewers want to see Stark move beyond his problems and become emotionally strong and self-disciplined like the actor who portrays him.  Watching Stark build and test the suit in IM1 (both gorgeous -and- brilliant) is what attracted many viewers to the first movie ... I feel they downplayed the tech too much (like where did the suitcase suit come from?) in IM2.  Stark in IM1 is ""everyman,"" the inspiration for intelligent people everywhere to simply -choose- to use your intellect to create a solution for unsolveable problems and, in the process, make yourself a better person.  Stark is a man who, quite literally, is dying from a broken heart but still has enough heart left to choose to make the world a better place.  The Marvel Iron Man/Stark character has always been about the humanity of the man inside the suit, not just the suit itself, some of which was lost in IM2 in their attempt to throw too many characters and sub-plots into the mix.The whole get-drunk-at-the-party-destroy-the-house-fight-with-Rhody scene should have been completely deleted and that time devoted to more comic build-it-test-it-have-a-mishap-then-solve-it scenes like was done in the first movie.  Stark also had more ""emotional"" moments in IM1 (such as fear when he first sees the electromagnet in his chest or getting choked up when he tells Pepper he knows what he's doing is the right thing to do) which were totally missing in IM2 (like ... the dude is dying ... where's the emotion!!!)  One or two of the ""drunk"" scenes would have been better spent having Stark come to grips with his relationship with his genius dead father.Another distasteful element ... the directors attempts to tie Stark to Howard Hughs by adopting his dislike of germs or people touching him is barking up the wrong tree.  We want a strong Iron Man, not a neurotic one.  Ditch the Hughs defect analogies and play up the similarities to of Howard Hughs strengths instead!!!  Nobody wants to think of Iron Man/Stark ending up in a Vegas hotel room surrounded by cups of his own urine like Hughs!!!I sure hope Downey does a Russell Crowe and decides to ""keep the body"" when he does Sherlock Holmes 2 this time around!!!  It's none-too-hard on the female eyes watching Downey flex those gorgeous iron-hammering arms, six-pack abs and chest muscles (okay ... female leering here ... probably not relevant to a movie review).Some action-hero buffs have complained about too much underlying ""talk"" and not enough action.  I don't think it was simply lack of action that lost this movie it's 5th star, but rather the fact it dragged too long between the first few action scenes than we had to wait to have them all lumped up at the end.  Not all movie viewers are 14-years old ... we like drama and a well defined thread underlying the action ... but IM2 just didn't do as good of a job as tying together the action and sub-scripts as IM1.  Too many ""chiefs"" (actors and sub-plots) and not enough ""firemen"" (testing the suit) to do the work in this movie.  I hope they clean things up for Avengers and IM3.In summary ... not as good as IM1, but still worth buying the DVD and watching it a million times even if you're cheap like me.",4,Not Iron Man I ...

I think Rourke played a great villian but the fight scene at the end did seem kind of short between Stark and Rhoades against Ivan but the action was great and to me there was plenty of it and its got quite a bit of A listers in it with Downey, Paltrow who i hope is in the Avengers film and if they Make an Iron Man 3, Cheadle, Rourke, Johanssan, Jackson, Bettany, and Favreau who is in the movie alot more which is fine by me because i think he should have been in more of the first one. My only problem was with the shipping because they dropped it off at the wrong place and it took me two days to find out where but to me that doesnt count agaisnt the movie it self so it still says at a 5 star. And for some of you that most likely turned it off at the end i would suggest you fast forward to the end of the credits because you get to see a small sneak peak of Thor so if you are looking forward to that you get to see his hammer but still it gives you something.

It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...Paltrow as Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, the director as ""Happy"" Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool!This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's ""Ex-wife"" missile), thrills, politics and laughs.

1247849,A3PHUMOFCIFUGF,B0021L8V1G,Alexander Liu,"[5, 9]","The gilded surface is worn through and the glint no longer shimmers, but what ""Iron Man 2"" lacks in fun it makes up for with pathos. Like many a darker second chapter in the journey of a super-hero, the true villains would surface as those that dwelled within. Superman, Luke Skywalker, and Spiderman all had to fight with who they were, although to be fair, Peter Parker always seemed to run away in any movie regardless.The same holds true for Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who despite facing the triple threat of a passionate senator (Gary Shandling), a fellow industrialist (Sam Rockwell), and a vengeful Russian hacker and possible lion tamer (Mickey Rourke), the biggest danger still lies within the man in the iron suit. After all, it grows increasingly hard to believe that they could pose Stark any more danger than he already does to himself as we watch as Stark happily dishes out massive amounts of damage to his own home in a self-destructive downward spiral in a moment that feels all too awkwardly autobiographical by Downey, playing a man coping with the excesses of fame.Which is an integral point that the movie revolves around: Where does a superhero story go after the man of steel outs himself to the world? None of the other superheroes had this problem, and while they're all too busy hiding their identity from the world, Iron Man busies himself protecting his right to save it. It is an interesting and a radical departure from the traditional mould, but one that ultimately is let down by the script, written by newcomer and actor Justin Theroux, who unfortunately is neither able to do justice to such a bold idea, nor to measure up to his predecessors.And this is where the movie suffers the most. Where the first entry was fun, exciting, and more importantly, fresh, this sequel simply lumbers heavily from action set piece to action set piece, with none of the wit, cohesiveness, or direction that made the first so endearing. While the actors all give it their best, they are all ultimately let down by a disappointing script that gives characters a lot to do, yet nothing to do.Visually, the film cannot be faulted. Directed once again by Jon Favreau, it does have the advantage of being a refreshing take on an otherwise tired genre, but even despite Favreau's best efforts as he once again successfully delivers a different vibe, he can do little as the writing ultimately lets down the picture.Rourke, as the central villain, has a little more than a cameo in ""Iron Man 2"", where he seems to be in a completely different movie. A Dostoyevsky tragedy perhaps, which makes his standoffs with Stark all the more jarring. Likewise, Scarlett Johansson has a brief role that really contributes little except to help tie this movie into a future `superhero team' movie. More fitting though is Rockwell's performance, as he plays industrialist Justin Hammer as both the shadowy reflection of, and a man deeply in live with the idea of Tony Stark.Perhaps therein lays the tragedy of this sequel. It tries too hard to be like its predecessor, to give audiences a familiar sight through different lenses again, but unfortunately glosses over what made ""Iron Man"" work. No amount of exploding robots or martial artistry can make up for true purpose in a story, which is what this sequel lacks.Still, ""Iron Man 2"" gets the job done.

It is common in all super hero movies that the good guy usually wins almost all of the time. I am not saying that Iron Man had to lose here but it would have been nice for Mickey Rocrick to have his character to continue and kill off the other character the black guy who was helping fight Mickey at the end of the movie. Another part that would have been cool to me is if the guards would have been able to stop the girl from breaking in. I understand the point was for her to be unstoppable in martial arts but are we serious that she took out almost all those guards at once except for the one in the front which the car driver drove. I feel besides those things this movie just flowed. There really was not one point where I wanted to turn this movie off. Couple of the scenes that really standout to me are at the race car event when we are first introduced to someone that can fight Iron Man without help. Mickey played that role perfect and the twist that got him out of jail was a nice touch as well. Also a comedy and serious part of the movie came when Iron Man was having his birthday party some funny parts there but it is also where the movie started to take a different turn. Overall I can't complain. The Iron man series has been surprisingly very good and they have left room open to make a third if they wish.

1247851,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0021L8V1G,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","Almost always sequels, especially action-packed sequels, suffer by comparison with the first production. That is the case here with Iron Man 2. What made the original Iron Man interesting, beyond the finely-tuned performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the ""frat brat"", poor little rich boy, Tony Stark, out to find his place in the world, and incidentally act as the sole defensive shield necessary to save the old U.S.A., was the creation of Iron Man and that first struggle against the world's evil metal. IM2 already figured to extend that monster metal notion, although harking back to the old Cold War days with a Russian antagonist (Mickey Rourke, as Ivan Vanko) out to revenge old hurts was a curious twist. Iron Man, naturally, despite a few aging ""heart"" problems single-handedly (oops, double-handedly, he has a partner here). The plot left me with this feeling-Ya okay, what of it.As for the boy meets girl aspect (Downey and his administrative assistant, Paltrow), or I should say ""boy met girl"" since they already got kind of moony-eyed in the first picture, an aspect that is always sexually and romantically understated in these comic book-drawn movies (Spider Man, Super Man, etc.) they continue that chaste romance here. What I don't get is why a sensible woman like Downey's ""Girl Friday"" would have anything to do with a, well yes, a good-looking guy with a zillion dollars, with some ""boss"" fast cars, and with access to all kinds of techno-gadgets. A no-brainer, right?  At least, serious, chaste, ""kick butt"" governmental agent Scarlett Johansson didn't fall for all that superficial stuff.

1247852,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B0021L8V1G,Amanda,"[0, 0]","Finally had the opportunity see Iron Man 2 last weekend, and I'm so glad I did. I was little worried after reading so many early reviews that were negative. I mean, the first Iron Man was a really fun, refreshing superhero movie, so I was worried that they wouldn't be able to live up to it. After hearing overwhelmingly positive comments from friends and family, my boyfriend and I rushed out to see it.Iron Man 2 is an action-packed, fun superhero movie that, even though it's not as good as the first one, is a great entry into the superhero movie genre. In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is openly enjoying life as a superhero, but a Russian physicist named Ivan (Mickey Rourke) vows revenge on Tony. Meanwhile, Tony isn't happy enjoying life as a businessman, so he decides to step down and make Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) CEO of Stark Industries. Enter Scarlet Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff (also known in the Marvel universe as Black Widow) and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and we've got a great recipe for awesome.Oh, and of course there's that traitor Rhodie (Don Cheadle) who gets far too little screen time as War Machine.For me though, the real stand-out character (aside from RDJ, of course) was Sam Rockwell's Justice Hammer. Rockwell always does a fabulous job at villains, but bringing his flavor to Iron Man helped balance out RDJ with another strong character. In fact, I was more interested in Hammer than in the rarely-used Ivan/Whiplash, and can't wait to see more of him in sequels.I have to poke at the movie a little though because the franchise set such a high bar for itself with the first Iron Man. The pacing is a little slow at the beginning, so much so in fact that I got a little fidgety during the first thirty minutes, waiting for things to happen. Plus I have to admit that it's not as funny as the first one and RDJ doesn't feel as natural in his acting. Most likely this is due to the fact that Iron Man 2 actually had a script when it started filming, unlike the first movie where RDJ had the freedom to ad-lib as he pleased.Then there's the Pepper/Tony relationship that develops a little more in this film. While some of their bickering is entertaining, it doesn't quite have the spark that it did before and it ranges from sounding like an old married couple to a sexually-tense couple to a mother scolding her son (which is...a little creepy). At least they get to kiss at the end, and I did enjoy seeing her as a businesswoman, which is a big change from the more damsel-in-distress secretary in the first film. I'm curious to see what the writers do with her character in future installments.Despite this, Iron Man 2 is a fun, exciting action movie that's the perfect kick-off of the summer movie season. On a scale of one to 10 for superhero movies (10 being the best), I'd say Iron Man 2 is a solid six. Great action, well-timed humor, wonderful special effects and enjoyable characters, but not quite up to the standard of the first Iron Man (which I'd rate an eight on the scale), which was such a surprising hit. Can't wait for Iron Man 3 though, the Avengers movie that's alluded to here, and the many Marvel mega-verse movies that are likely going to branch out from this franchise.",4,A worthy sequel,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,3268,"['Finally', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'last', 'weekend', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'reading', 'so', 'many', 'early', 'reviews', 'were', 'negative', 'mean', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'refreshing', 'superhero', 'movie', 'was', 'worried', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'live', 'up', 'hearing', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'comments', 'friends', 'family', 'boyfriend', 'rushed', 'out', 'see', 'it.Iron', 'Man', '2', 'action-packed', 'fun', 'superhero', 'movie', 'even', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'great', 'entry', 'superhero', 'movie', 'genre', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'openly', 'enjoying', 'life', 'superhero', 'Russian', 'physicist', 'named', 'Ivan', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'revenge', 'Tony', 'Meanwhile', 'Tony', ""n't"", 'happy', 'enjoying', 'life', 'businessman', 'step', 'down', 'make', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'CEO', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'Enter', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'Natalie', 'Rushman/Natasha', 'Romanoff', 'also', 'known', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Nick', 'Fury', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'recipe', 'awesome.Oh', 'course', 'traitor', 'Rhodie', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'War', 'Machine.For', 'real', 'stand-out', 'character', 'aside', 'RDJ', 'course', 'was', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Justice', 'Hammer', 'Rockwell', 'always', 'fabulous', 'job', 'villains', 'bringing', 'flavor', 'Iron', 'Man', 'helped', 'balance', 'out', 'RDJ', 'strong', 'character', 'fact', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'Hammer', 'rarely-used', 'Ivan/Whiplash', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'more', 'sequels.I', 'have', 'poke', 'movie', 'little', 'franchise', 'set', 'high', 'bar', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'pacing', 'little', 'slow', 'beginning', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'got', 'little', 'fidgety', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'waiting', 'things', 'happen', 'have', 'admit', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'one', 'RDJ', ""n't"", 'feel', 'natural', 'acting', 'Most', 'likely', 'due', 'fact', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'actually', 'had', 'script', 'when', 'started', 'filming', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'RDJ', 'had', 'freedom', 'ad-lib', 'Pepper/Tony', 'relationship', 'little', 'more', 'film', 'bickering', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'spark', 'did', 'sounding', 'old', 'married', 'couple', 'sexually-tense', 'couple', 'mother', 'scolding', 'son', 'little', 'creepy', 'least', 'get', 'kiss', 'end', 'did', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'businesswoman', 'big', 'change', 'more', 'damsel-in-distress', 'secretary', 'first', 'film', ""'m"", 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'writers', 'do', 'character', 'future', 'installments.Despite', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'fun', 'exciting', 'action', 'movie', 'perfect', 'kick-off', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', 'scale', 'one', '10', 'superhero', 'movies', '10', 'being', 'best', ""'d"", 'say', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'solid', 'six', 'Great', 'action', 'well-timed', 'humor', 'wonderful', 'special', 'effects', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'not', 'quite', 'standard', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', ""'d"", 'rate', 'eight', 'scale', 'was', 'surprising', 'hit', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'alluded', 'here', 'many', 'Marvel', 'mega-verse', 'movies', 'are', 'likely', 'going', 'branch', 'out', 'franchise']",N/A

1247861,A134MJZL7H493A,B0021L8V1G,Amazon Customer,"[12, 36]","Oh hey, there'll be spoilers. Also, this has been heavily edited from the two paragraph blurb it once was. Now you know.Iron Man. We saw in the first movie an arrogant, hedonistic, self-absorbed playboy brought low. We saw him build himself back up again into something greater. He was still self-absorbed, arrogant and hedonistic, but now he was less like someone they'd make a reality show after and more like James Bond. He's still going to chase the girl and have a good time doing his job, but he's still the guy who's going to save the world.On top of that, we had an excellent cast, and they played to their strengths. Jeff Bridges was the most subdued, interesting villain I've seen in a long time. Gwyneth Paltrow played the smart, independent, savvy personal assistant who's not above knocking her boss down a peg when he needs it. Terrence Howard was fantastic as Rhodey. Even John Favreau, the director himself, was amusing as Happy the bodyguard in the scene he had.Four writers crafted a character story in the guise of an action movie in the superhero genre that wouldn't be seen again until The Dark Knight.SO WHAT HAPPENED?! Why did the second movie suck?!Well, Robert Downey Jr. was so impressed with the movie Tropic Thunder that he brought the co-screen writer for that movie to write Iron Man 2. There are some wonderful one-person talents who can write science fiction adventure well (Nicholas Meyer from Star Trek 2 and 6 immediately comes to mind), but unfortunately this guy isn't one of them. And John Favreau, the director, seems to know nothing at all when it comes to directing action scenes; the weakest part of the first movie is the anti-climactic action scene near the end. This combination has led to a watered down movie, where too many things happen too quickly, there are entirely too many characters to focus on, the hype of the upcoming Avengers movie washes away the main story, the action is atrocious, and it's hard to sit through.Iron Man 2. We finally have the back story out of the way. We finally can get to the action, crafted expertly into a story around Tony Stark becoming the alcoholic danger to himself and others he's known best for. We can finally see Rhodey don his own suit and take up the mantel while Tony puts himself back together...again. We can see Pepper Potts doing her thing, and Happy doing his. Mix it up with the occasional reminder of the Avengers Initiative and you have a movie as worthwhile as the first one. Maybe we'll get a Big Bad as great as Jeff Bridges. And maybe John Favreau will let someone else direct the action after all the criticism he got over the first movie.We didn't get any of that, did we? We didn't get a great action movie, we got Science Comic Con. A convention? The movie centers around a science convention?! Did we stumble into a sitcom along the way to the theater by accident, because an action movie that costs tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to make shouldn't have the plot of a Simpsons episode.In the Marvel universe, vibranium is kind of a naturally occurring alloy on Earth, and Tony Stark was a raving alcoholic. In the movie, Tony Stark only has a drinking problem on his birthdays and he's dying unless he invents vibranium. I know where this is going. Tony's dad first invented vibranium and created Captain America's shield with it, so we'll see that tie in for that movie. But in changing this up in the movie universe, we take away the one thing Tony Stark is sort of best known for: he is his own worst enemy. He doesn't have some great inner demon to fight in this movie like he did in the first one, he just has daddy issues that kind of show up when the plot requires.What happened to the great characters in the first movie? Tony Stark is just annoying, Pepper Potts just dotes, Natasha (Black Widow in the comics) is just kind of there until she gets her action scene. The Avengers Initiative is talked about at a doughnut shop.Mickey Rouke...remember in the trailers, we're promised what should be an epic game of cat and mouse, or some epic power struggle, between Tony Stark and Ivan Vanko? Ivan, who promises to tear down the good name of Stark? What happened to that? Suddenly he becomes a bit player in his own story? We're barely even introduced to Sam Rockwell's character, yet he gets more attention in the movie?Sam Rockwell's character manages to be twice as annoying as Tony Stark. That's hard to watch.Don Cheadle just looks bored through the whole movie. Terrence Howard was so much more enjoyable to watch. And how does this work? He's after the power suit but Tony doesn't want to give it to him. Tony says in the Senate hearing that he and his power suit are one; his chest piece powers the suit, after all. So how does Rhodey get the power suit to even work in the first place if there's nothing to power it? Because if Tony Stark just put an arc reactor in the suit yet meant to test Rhodey...the reasoning just falls apart.All the elements were there to make a fantastic movie. We even see a lot of these elements get wasted. Tony Stark working to find out the history between his family and Ivan Vanko while he battles his alcoholism. Ivan Vanko setting out to destroy Tony Stark's reputation while he's up to his own scheme. Tony knowing he's having some serious issues, so he willingly gives Rhodey the suit (Rhodey personally of course, not the U.S. government). Rhodey having to become War Machine and learn he may be in over his head as a superhero. Natasha coming as a secret agent to keep tabs on Tony, bugging his house, stealing the plans for building the suit, reporting back to Nick Fury to see if he's ready to be an Avenger. Pepper Potts figuring out what's going on with Natasha and Nick Fury. Hopefully some great action in all the right places.But no. We got crap. We got a bad movie, with a terrible story and talent terribly wasted. The first Iron Man was a great movie, one of the top superhero movies in spite of its flaws. Iron Man 2 is a thoughtless popcorn flick. It falls in line with Spider-man 3 as the most disappointing movie I've seen.",1,It's in the story,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,6113,"['Oh', 'hey', ""'ll"", 'be', 'spoilers', 'Also', 'been',

1247862,A2YW1SOKOLNG2,B0021L8V1G,"Amazon Customer ""Movie Fan""","[1, 2]","""Iron Man 2"" could have been a great movie.  This is the frustrating fact of the mostly-failed effort of ""Iron Man 2.""  It is not a complete loss, but it is dying of a cancer, a malaise if you will.  It suffers from a malaise that is seeping all over Hollywood over any good franchise.  We all have seen this malaise, felt its effects and lamented its continued presence.  It has brought down titans and peons in the movie industry alike.  The problem is, it is insidious, tempting and truly the devil's fare.  It has gone by many names, but I dub it ""Sequalitis.""  Sequalitis infects any movie that has even the potential to become a franchise.  It has been there since day 1 and will be with us till the day we die since studio executives rate somewhere between dimwits and rutabegas on the intelligence meters. We have been warned since childhood with fables such as the golden goose to stay away, but studio executives must try to kill all that is good in the universe.  They are not responsible for innovation, but they sure can kill it.Okay, so what is sequalitis, you may ask?  Simple.  It is the mistaken notion that the next installment of a successful movie must have everything the first one did and more.  It must be bigger, more thrills, more chills, more stars and more oomph.  The notion of trying to recreate a formula that worked so well, usually because it was so unique.  Once that uniqueness is attempted again, though, it is no longer unique and therefore loses its magic.  And we can place the blame squarely in the stupid studio executives' grubby little hands.  It is greed unboound.  It is the triumph of commerce over art.  It is...some other metaphor for Goliath beating David.  Movies cost SO much to make anymore, between special effects cost, marketing, talent and executive avarice, union rates and a whole host of other costs that go into the production of a high-profile movie.  Combine that with the slavish devotion to the pre-release focus group feedback and the studios all but strip out any kind of magic or originality into a production until we are left with a bland, flaccid and vanilla avatar of what could have once been something interesting and, yes, fun.This is the problem with ""Iron Man 2.""""Iron Man 2"" has approximately 6 good movies in it.  If the producers would have picked 2, they would have had a great movie.  I loved Stark's alcholism, losing his company, a rival nipping at his heels, his assistant taking over, his friend starting a new Iron Man, a wronged villain enacting revenge, a government agent spying on him, a new covert government agency working at cross purposes with him and ---gasp!--- the Avengers initiative.  All of these are interesting plotlines.  But because fanboys want to see War Machine or Black Widow or Whiplash or whatever, the producers tried to put in everything while doing justice to nothing.  It becomes a ham-handed attempt to make a tentpole movie delivered with all the subtlety and finesse of a sledgehammer to the side of the head.  Add to that a stupid, cartoon villain (the rival contractor), frenetic MTV-style editing that ensures you can't figure out what just happened, never mind what will happen, and a story-telling device that makes you think you dropped into a 10-episode show at the 3rd for 4th show.  The executives forgot what made the original ""Iron Man"" so good, which was about a very flawed man who has a life-changing experience and tries to make good on his past sins.  The iron suit is merely incidental.  The STORY is what is important here, not the trappings.  ""Iron Man"" is fantastic until the last 20 minutes when it becomes the battle of the iron men.  This sequalitis makes me cringe for what is in store with the upcoming ""Avengers"" movie next year.  When they throw all of these last 5 or 6 movies into the soup, I fear we will get a confused mess, not a worthy story-line.  Bottom-line, don't think too much about ""Iron Man 2.""  It is like a Victoria's Secret model.  It looks beautiful, but in the end is vapid and devoid of any depth or intelligence.  You want to look, you will have a good time.  You want anything deeper, stand in line just like everybody else and lament the ""pretty but dumbness"" of the movie.  It is all sound and thunder, but no rain.  Nothing substantial.  But really awesome to look at.",2,"The definition of ""Sequalitis""",1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,4336,"['Iron', 'Man', '2', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'frustrating', 'fact', 'mostly-failed', 'effort', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'not', 'complete', 'loss', 'dying', 'cancer', 'malaise', 'will', 'malaise', 'seeping', 'Hollywood', 'good', 'franchise', 'have', 'seen', 'malaise', 'felt', 'effects', 'lamented', 'continued', 'presence', 'brought', 'down', 'titans', 'peons', 'movie', 'industry', 'alike', 'problem', 'insidious', 'tempting', 'truly', 'devil', 'fare', 'gone', 'many', 'names', 'dub', 'Sequalitis', 'Sequalitis', 'movie', 'even', 'potential', 'become', 'franchise', 'been', 'day', '1', 'will', 'be', 'till', 'day', 'die', 'studio', 'executives', 'rate', 'somewhere', 'dimwits', 'rutabegas', 'intelligence', 'meters', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'childhood', 'fables', 'such', 'golden', 'goose', 'stay', 'away', 'studio', 'executives', 'must', 'try', 'kill', 'good', 'universe', 'are', 'not', 'responsible', 'innovation', 'sure', 'can', 'kill', 'it.Okay', 'what', 'sequalitis', 'may', 'ask', 'Simple', 'mistaken', 'notion', 'next', 'installment', 'successful', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'everything', 'first', 'one', 'did', 'more', 'must', 'be', 'bigger', 'more', 'thrills', 'more', 'chills', 'more', 'stars', 'more', 'oomph', 'notion', 'trying', 'recreate', 'formula', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'usually', 'was', 'so', 'unique', 'Once', 'uniqueness', 'attempted', 'again', 'no', 'longer', 'unique', 'therefore', 'magic', 'can', 'place', 'blame', 'squarely', 'stupid', 'studio', 'executives', 'grubby', 'little', 'hands', 'greed', 'unboound', 'triumph', 'commerce', 'art', 'other', 'metaphor', 'Goliath', 'beating', 'David', 'Movies', 'cost', 'SO', 'much', 'make', 'anymore', 'special', 'effects', 'cost', 'marketing', 'talent', 'executive', 'avarice', 'union', 'rates', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'costs', 'go', 'production', 'high-profile', 'movie', 'Combine', 'slavish', 'devotion', 'pre-release', 'focus', 'group', 'feedback', 'studios', 'strip', 'out', 'kind', 'magic', 'originality', 'production', 'are', 'left', 'bland', 'flaccid', 'vanilla', 'avatar', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'once', 'been', 'something', 'interesting', 'yes', 'problem', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'approximately', '6', 'good', 'movies', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'picked', '2', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'movie', 'loved', 'Stark', 'alcholism', 'losing', 'company', 'rival', 'nipping', 'heels', 'assistant', 'taking', 'over', 'friend', 'starting', 'new', 'Iron', 'Man', 'wronged', 'villain', 'enacting', 'revenge', 'government', 'agent', 'spying', 'new', 'covert', 'government', 'agency', 'working', 'cross', 'purposes', '-gasp', 'Avengers', 'initiative', 'are', 'interesting', 'plotlines', 'fanboys', 'want', 'see', 'War', 'Machine', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Whiplash', 'producers', 'tried', 'put', 'everything', 'doing', 'justice', 'nothing', 'ham-handed', 'attempt', 'make', 'tentpole', 'movie', 'delivered', 'subtlety', 'finesse', 'sledgehammer', 'side', 'head', 'Add', 'stupid', 'cartoon', 'villain', 'rival', 'contractor', 'frenetic', 'MTV-style', 'editing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'never', 'mind', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'story-telling', 'device', 'think', 'dropped', '10-episode', 'show', '3rd', '4th', 'show', 'executives', 'forgot', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'Iron', 'Man', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'flawed', 'man', 'who', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'tries', 'make', 'good', 'past', 'sins', 'iron', 'suit', 'merely', 'incidental', 'STORY', 'what', 'important', 'here', 'not', 'trappings', 'Iron', 'Man', 'fantastic', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'when', 'battle', 'iron', 'men', 'sequalitis', 'cringe', 'what', 'store', 'upcoming', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'next', 'year', 'When', 'throw', 'last', '5', '6', 'movies', 'soup', 'fear', 'will', 'get', 'confused', 'mess', 'not', 'worthy', 'story-line', 'Bottom-line', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'model', 'beautiful', 'end', 'vapid', 'devoid', 'depth', 'intelligence', 'want', 'look', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'want', 'anything', 'deeper', 'stand', 'line', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'lament', 'pretty', 'dumbness', 'movie', 'sound', 'thunder', 'rain', 'Nothing', 'substantial', 'really', 'awesome', 'look']",N/A

""the film is basically `Spider-Man 3'""... ""It's a cluttered mess"" and I believed them, but I didn't care because I loved the first film and was wearing my `Scarlett Johansson blinders'.  Truth be told, I was disappointed, but not for the reasons they listed.  First of all, the film is nowhere near as cluttered as it could have been.  It doesn't really throw away any notable characters like `Spider-Man 3' did (I will never forgive that film for teasing us with Venum only to barely use him).  It is nowhere near as cluttered as `X-Men 3' was.  Sure, there are a few faces thrown in the mix (War Machine is merely flirted with and Black Widow could have used more screen time) but overall, this film remains focused on the key characters, and it builds a noteworthy villain in Whiplash.  For me, the film's major fault lies in the fact that it felt rather uninspired.  Nothing really felt exciting and new and fresh and memorable.  The action sequences, while shiny explosive, felt uneventful in comparison to some of the more thought-out sequences in recent films.  The visual effects are very impressive, taking that whole `video game look' to another level with sequences that feel real, and yet those fight scenes just feel redundant.  The acting is fine; Robert Downey Jr. was born for this role, but he doesn't add any new layers to what he created in '08.  I wish Scarlett had more screen time, but whatever, she was hot as per usual and while she didn't do anything truly `interesting', she was, well, hot.  I still love Paltrow in this role, so more her please.  This isn't a total mess, in fact in parts it is very good...and Sam Rockwell chewed that scenery like his life depended on it and was, in a way, the best thing about this film.

1247900,A3NO9TSFVL1ZJD,B0021L8V1G,Bosco Hoggins,"[18, 25]","I saw Iron Man a couple of years ago and thought it was flawed, but servicable. My wife and I just saw Iron Man 2 over the weekend and were really not very impressed.  Here are a couple of thoughts on it that may be helpful:(i) DialougeAs you have probably heard, this movie is big into dialouge and ""character development"" (At least, I think that's the term directors use when they unnecessarily load action movies down with lots of talky filler).  Most of these interactions are just grating and annoying (eg. Tony and Pepper; Tony and Rhoddy; Tony and Senator Stern; Tony and Justin Hammer; Tony and Nick Fury, etc.) Bickering, talking over each other, and being generally cheesed off at one another are not the same thing as witty dialouge or clever ripostes.  His Girl Friday this ain't.(ii) The Main CharacterIn the first movie, Tony Stark was smug, but also ironic and interesting; in fact, despite the first movie's faults, I thought its protagonist was a refreshing antidote to all the dark conflicted loners you find in every other superhero movie.  In the sequel, Tony Stark is just a rich, obnoxious, jerk, mostly drunk and disrespectful to everyone else including his friends.  I don't like spending two hours with obnoxious, rich jerks.(iii) ActionNot a whole lot of action in this one and not really anything that was overly impressive.  If you have seen the trailers to the movie, you've seen pretty much all there is to see. The final confrontation between Iron Man, War Machine and Whiplash lasts about 60 seconds or so.(iv) PlotMINOR SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW ******  The plot is.... well, there really is not much of a plot, as much as there is a basket of interrelated half-concepts tied together. It reminded me a little of The Phantom Menance where George Lucas decided he wanted certain elements (eg. a pod race; a space battle; a lightsaber fight) and then wrote a thin story to incorporate them.  The plot that does exist has holes a mile wide, lots of loose ends and a lot of stuff that goes nowhere.  As an example, Black Widow is written in, but really does nothing of note (she is a secret agent disguised as a notary in Stark Industries; even though her boss tells her that she is onto her, they are confidants in the next scene).  Nick Fury and SHIELD are introduced for the sole purpose of promoting Thor and The Avengers.  Jon Favreau writes in a fairly large role for himself (including an incredibly implausable action scene) which contributes nothing to the plot and is really for the sole purpose of giving himself some screen-time.  In sum, it felt like either the product of a committee or a bunch of last minute re-writes or re-edits.(v) Embedded AdvertisingLots and lots of annoying promotional tie-ins from watches to software to cars to upcoming movies are scattered throughout.

1247904,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B0021L8V1G,Brian A. Schar,"[3, 4]","Although only one screenwriter is credited, ""Iron Man 2"" has the classic hallmark of scripts that have gone through multiple writers and script doctors: a plethora of disparate elements shoehorned together without regard for the narrative as a whole.""Iron Man 2"" starts off promising, with an interesting conflict between Stark and the Federal Government.  The first 10 minutes set it up as ""Atlas Shrugged"" with a powersuit, featuring Tony Stark as Hank Reardon.  The Feds and their favored contractors are, unsurprisingly, not happy at being cut out of the defense business by a non-state actor.  Indeed, the enemies Iron Man faces in the course of the movie are non-state actors as well, a nod (conscious or unconscious) to the unsustainability of the welfare-warfare state.But enough of that.  Instead of a tight, interesting movie, we get a bunch of diversions that keep Iron Man from encountering the Stinky Russian, his primary enemy, until 30 minutes in.  Mickey Rourke plays Stinky Russian, and you can darn near smell him whenever he's on screen.  OK, that's cool, but then there's some corporate succession issues, the pointless use of SHIELD, and Scarlett Johansson phoning it in as Stark's new assistant.  Every scene with her is grating and unnecessary.  Oh, then there are some other plot points that would be spoilers that I will avoid.  Rather than a complete narrative, we get bogged down in Act 2 and just stay there from a long time spinning our wheels.  Even when the movie finally gets going again, the climax manages to be anticlimactic.""Iron Man 2"" is saved only by Downey, Rourke and Rockwell.

And though I risk being labeled a snob or, worse yet, an ""elitist,"" I would advise against anyone watching any picture that glorifies or otherwise romanticizes violence and weaponry. Violence is a part of many great stories.  But films that fantasize violence, obsess over firearms, exalt it, worship it--make love to violence like it was a thing of beauty--are true profanations.  To IM2's credit, the film certainly doesn't glorify violence.  To its discredit, IM2 really has nothing more to offer than its hardware.  The film-makers were clearly of the philosophical persuasion: If a little is good, more must be better.  They knocked their little heads together for a few minutes and calculated, ""If a few IM suits in the original was a good thing by golly, lots and lots more will be a VERY good thing!""  But there's enough silly, redundant hardware in this film to make the viewing experience mind-numbing.  Evil Soviet scientist Vanko (Mickey Rourke) builds so many of his IM-like cyborgs that, at one point, our hero and Col. Rhodes are pursued by a platoon of evil robots.  Now, Vanko's dad helped Tony's father develop the IM power technology, and Vanko can build robots with the best of them.  But you've probably already guessed--and right you would be--that Tony and Rhodes handily outmaneuver and outgun Vanko's machines.  IM was fresh, self-deprecating, funny, and focused on it characters.  IM2 is the epitome of too much of a good thing--boring hardware overkill.  In the original, Downey was charmingly obsessive-compulsive, condescending yes, but witty and humorous, and that was fine fill for one picture.  In IM2, Downey maintains the identical modulation throughout so that, by the end, he becomes repetitive and irritating.  Don Cheadle, playing Tony's always-vexed babysitter, is a poor replacement for Terrance Howard, whose fine comic timing got some of the biggest laughs in the first film.  Rourke has a wonderful screen presence (check him out in one of the best American cops and robbers yarns of all time, Year of The Dragon), and there are certain flashes of creativity such as Vanko's electrified whips.  But it's not enough to save this, as put by Amazon's Robert Horton, ""genre foolishness.""  Sadly, at film's end you feel somewhat brain-devastated, consider for a moment all that money the studio will invariably waste marketing IM3 to you, and think how you'd rather spend the afternoon in a dentist's chair than see the IM 3-quel.",2,"Review 710, I Know!

Yet, with all the superhero movies we've been seeing over the past few years, I'm afraid the FORMULA has become routine and stale.Don't get me wrong, Iron Man 2 delivers on nearly all levels but this movie reminded me of Spiderman 3 in a way.  A slam bam beginning. A gushy uneventful middle and a slam bam ending. Iron Man 2 even took the stalish step of duplicating themselves. Just like the first movie when Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) stepped into the mammoth, souped up original Iron Man suit, Ivan Vanko/Whiplash steps into a souped up, mammoth suit of his own creation. My apologies for saying it, but ""ho, hum"".It's almost like Paramount knows they have us by the cahones with Spiderman, Iron Man, Thor & Captain America, and they have this cookie cutter screenplay machine that kicks em' out with the least amount of expense on their behalf. ""If we give em' a more complicated script, we're gonna have to put in more Iron Man scenes in the middle and that's expensive. And of course we have Thor, Captain America & another Iron Man to think about. Keep it simple. Keep the cost down.""I just couldn't help thinking this after I left the movie. I hated Spiderman 3 for this very reason. I was nodding off in the middle for godsakes. Christopher Nolan delivered with Dark Knight. He gave us a unique look into the world of Batman that was interesting throughout and had us EMOTIONALLY involved. Heck, even the original Batman series knew that people didn't want talking... they wanted Batman.Anyway, despite the uneventful middle to this movie, where the most exciting scene was Tony Stark dancing around drunk in the Iron Man suit shooting fruit, it is still a good movie that is certainly worth a trip to the cinema and a purchase on DVD or Blu-Ray... just, one of these days... we're gonna have to demand more for all the money we've made the studio.

1247929,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0021L8V1G,Chris Pandolfi,"[40, 51]","At the end of 2008, I made two bold assertions: (1) That ""Iron Man"" was one of the year's best films; (2) that ""Iron Man"" was one of the greatest superhero films ever made. I still believe both to be true. Now we have ""Iron Man 2."" While it is thoroughly entertaining, it's also a bit conventional when compared to its predecessor, having less of a compelling story but more in the ways of action, special effects, gadgets, humor, and stunt work. It's a comic book through and through. That's fine by me - what it lacks in introspection it more than makes up for in sheer fun. We have plenty to cheer for, not the least of which is our hero, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), who when we last left him had shut down the weapon's division of his company to focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. The result was a high tech metal suit equipped with rocket boosters and missile launchers.It's now six months after Stark revealed himself as Iron Man at a press conference. Despite the demands of a United States Senate committee, he refuses to share his technology with the American military, believing that world peace can be maintained only if it's privatized. At this meeting, he humiliates Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of a rival company who has unsuccessfully tried to outdo Stark's technology with his own prototype machines; in an effort to get ahead, Hammer appeals to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who publically revealed his grudge against Stark by attacking him as he was car racing in Monaco. For as yet unknown reasons, Vanko has constructed an arc reactor very similar to the one implanted in Stark's chest. He has improved the design by attaching whips that surge with bolts of electrical energy.Stark, meanwhile, is realizing that his chest implant, originally constructed as a way to keep him alive, contains an element that's slowly poisoning him. He doesn't handle it well. He acts out. He drinks in excess. He hastily appoints his former personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), as the new CEO of his company. If he's to survive, he must replace the core of the implant with an entirely new element, one he has tried but failed to create on his own. Out of the blue comes special agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who suggests that Stark look to his father's research for guidance.New to the cast is Don Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard as Stark's dedicated but weary friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes. Also new is Scarlett Johansson as Stark's newly hired personal assistant Natalie Rushman, who says she's from the company's legal department.Watching this movie, I was quite dazzled by the sights and sounds, and I found the plot engaging in a suspension-of-disbelief kind of way. I did not, however, find it persuasive, as I did the first film, which I felt put a refreshing and thought-provoking spin on the traditional comic book adversary; Stark might have physically battled with the power-hungry Obadiah Stane, but his real enemies were war and injustice, both of which he took part in by selling weapons of mass destruction. This time around, it's much more by the book - a superhero pitted against a madman out for revenge, a fight to the finish that includes a lot of things blowing up, a showcase of digital wizardry and highly choreographed stunts. There are a number of films that can give you pretty much the same thing.That being said, there's no denying the quality of the performances, especially Downey, whose cocky take on Stark makes the film fun but not jokey. Rockwell is quite good, playing Hammer is if he were Stark's slightly goofier evil twin - comedy relief with a hint of something darker, you might say. Credit also to Rourke, who truly does convey the anger, resentment, and pain his character feels in every one of his scenes. He isn't given all that much screen time, but when he's on, he's on, resonating with a deep, calm, frighteningly low voice and an imposing build.If there is an ""Iron Man 3,"" and I have no doubt that there will be, I can only hope it doesn't follow its predecessor's lead and decline in quality. The original ""Iron Man"" was a superb film, redefining the superhero genre for both old and new generations of moviegoers. ""Iron Man 2"" is a great looking and wonderfully performed sequel, although its approach to the story is routine, more so than I had preferred it to be. Still, you've got to hand it to director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux - they sure know how to entertain an audience. There's an early scene in which Stark, dressed as Iron Man, jumps off a plane, flies through the sky, and lands unharmed in the middle of one of his own lavishly high tech expos in New York City. Throngs of people cheer him on. I suspect the audiences for this movie will do the same when it's over.",4,"A High Tech, Lesser Value Superhero Sequel",1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,4848,"['end', '2008', 'made', 'two', 'bold',

I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 but didn't find Iron Man 2 as good. I did like the special effects though and found Robert Downey Jr. even better.In Iron Man 1, Downey plays Tony Stark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an ""Iron Man suit"", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool. Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 because of the great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars.In Iron Man 2, Stark has now disclosed to the public that he is Iron Man and the fame has gone a bit to his head. The government wants his 'weapon', his board loses confidence in him, his friends become increasingly annoyed with his behaviour, and the magnet in his chest is poisoning him to death. Paltrow is back as his assistant, Pepper, but I don't like her character as much in this one; too harsh. and Downey of course is back as Tony Stark. But in this movie, Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as his military friend. I like Cheadle but much preferred Howard. Samuel Jackson is great as usual as is Mickey Rourke who plays the villain, but Scarlett Johanssen's character was boring and very unrealistic (yes, even for a super-hero movie).I did enjoy the background about Stark's family and father, especially when he discovers a message left to him by his father which can save his life. And Robert Downey's character is even more enjoyable in this one ie wittier, more sarcastic, more foibles.So, my conclusion is that it is still worth watching though not as good as the first. A good family movie though and funny.",3,** Not as good as the first but worth watching,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,2154,"['watched', 'Iron', 'Man', '1', 'two', 'nights', 'ago', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'last', 'night', 'two', 'teenage', 'boys', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Iron', 'Man', '1', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'good', 'did', 'special', 'effects', 'found', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'even', 'better.In', 'Iron', 'Man', '1', 'Downey', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'owner', 'company', 'weapons', 'captured', 'Iraq', 'magnet', 'installed', 'chest', 'prevent', 'dying', 'magnet', 'invention', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'excape', 'captors', 'who', 'are', 'forcing', 'build', 'weapon', 'When', 'home', 'build', 'weapons', 'help', 'others', 'rather', 'harm', 'continued', 'work', 'perfecting', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'results', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'villain', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'ok', 'kind', 'boring', 'assistant', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'who', 'really', 'plays', 'part', 'well', 'military', 'friend', 'Iron', 'Man', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Iron', 'Man', '1', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'plot', 'cool', 'techonological', 'stuff', 'really', 'really', 'cool', 'cars.In', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'Stark', 'now', 'disclosed', 'public', 'Iron', 'Man', 'fame', 'gone', 'bit', 'head', 'government', ""'weapon"", 'board', 'confidence', 'become', 'increasingly', 'annoyed', 'behaviour', 'magnet', 'chest', 'poisoning', 'death', 'Paltrow', 'back', 'assistant', 'Pepper', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'character', 'much', 'one', 'too', 'harsh', 'Downey', 'course', 'back', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'movie', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'replaced', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'military', 'friend', 'like', 'Cheadle', 'much', 'preferred', 'Howard', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'great', 'as', 'usual', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'villain', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'character', 'was', 'boring', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'yes', 'even', 'super-hero', 'movie', '.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'background', 'Stark', 'family', 'father', 'especially', 'when', 'message', 'left', 'father', 'can', 'save', 'life', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'ie', 'wittier', 'more', 'sarcastic', 'more', 'foibles.So', 'conclusion', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'funny']",N/A

Jackson, John Favreau, Clark Gregg, John Slattery, Kate Mara, Leslie Bibb, Gary Shandling and the voice of: Paul BettanyWRITTEN BY: Justin TherouxDIRECTED BY: John FavreauRated: PG - 13Genre: Action / Science FictionRelease Date: 07 May 2010Review Date: 10 May 2010Surely by now it's no surprise to moviegoers the world over, that sequels almost never live up to the original. Iron Man 2 is no exception to this unfortunate cinematic veracity. However, no attempt to do a justice could have been better; Iron Man 2 is almost as good as Iron Man.Robert Downey Jr. reprises his sensational persona of billionaire Tony Stark. After revealing his identity as the man of Iron to the entire world at the first film's close, Stark's ego has naturally skyrocketed through the roof when we catch back up with him here.The plot centers on Stark facing three major conflicts and several smaller ones. The two initially of upmost concern, are that, A: the reactor in his chest keeping him alive is also killing him, and B: the government is threatening to seize control of his Iron Man suit, which would realistically be the case were one to possess such an invention in reality.Additional conflicts include Tony balancing feelings he has for his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) with their working relationship, an ego trip between him and his best friend `Rhodey' (Don Cheadle), and if all this wasn't enough to deal with - eventually Stark finds himself squaring off with not one, but two villains who begin working together.The scumbags are played flawlessly by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell; both truly gifted actors - and big action summer flick or not - Iron Man 2 showcases their talents repeatedly. Their characters are vastly different but yet compliment one another well dramatically.Rourke plays Ivan Vanko, a Russian terrorist hell-bent on revenge against Tony motivated by a personal vendetta. Rockwell plays a sleazy arms dealer named Hammer, who always seems to be technologically half a step or more behind Stark Industries. Vanko is sinister and macho and Hammer is hilarious and flamboyant; a great combo. I wish Vanko had a bigger role in the story.I was relieved to see Don Cheadle replace Terrence Howard as `Rhodey'. I can't say who is a better actor between the two - but Howard isn't as likeable as a buddy character as Cheadle is. Howard is more convincing as a villain or someone with a darker edge; see Big Mamma's House, Hustle and Flow and Crash.The only real problem I had with the movie, takes place on a racetrack. It starts out really nicely - Rourke's character Vanko dons two powerful electrically charged whips that can cut cars in half, which was awesome (but of course they can't cut the Iron Man suit in half, because then we wouldn't have a movie now would we?).The part of this I couldn't digest, lies in Vanko being able to take several blows to the torso from a vehicle repeatedly slamming him up against a fence; from which he leaves with only so much as a torn pant leg... no death, no internal bleeding, and he walks fine for the remainder of the film, and none of the other characters ever utter a word about this unbelievable miracle. But hey - at least everything else is for the most part plausible, and everyone in the audience seemed not to notice this either, so maybe I'm just nitpicking.The film also doesn't have quite the same charisma the first one had and I suspect this stems from the change in screenwriters. This picture focuses more on the comedy, which is understandable as it was written by Justin Theroux who also wrote the crack-up Tropic Thunder. As in that movie, the humor of Iron Man 2 is hysterical, but at least for me, it softened the seriousness and overall merit of the film in a few scenes.We do get a lot more action this time around though, and it is much appreciated. Lots of Shoot `em up scenes and Scarlett Johansson, who plays Stark's new employee Natalie, will drop your jaw with her martial arts skills. I've heard she spent several months training, and it really paid off. And my God, was the sound incredible in the theater when Stark would take off via his jet fueled suit. The vibrations were so intense; it literally felt like you were right there with him.I have heard so many gripes from fans that felt director John Favreau gave himself too much screen time in this one. I loved Favreau's performance and I hope he's in even more scenes in Iron Man 3. I'll take it a step further and add on a request that my man Favreau put his pal Vince Vaughn in a cameo in the third installment as well. Who wouldn't enjoy seeing a witty verbal standoff between Tony Stark and Vince Vaughn?",4,Iron Man 2 Review,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,4802,"['IRON', 'MAN', '2STARRING', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.',

1247941,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B0021L8V1G,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 0]","After a spectacular start with Iron Man a couple summers ago, one would have hoped for an even better sequel, considering the fortunes of the Spiderman, X Men, and Batman franchises of late, whose sophomore efforts took their series to dizzying new heights.  Not so here, although Iron Man 2 is definitely not a step down either.  Consider it on par with the original film and as such, a pretty entertaining, well made Marvel Comics screen entry, and it boasts another strong performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the hero.Picking up where industrialist genius, Tony Stark, reveals himself to be Iron Man, the folks in Washington D.C., namely the military and Congress want the technology.  He defies the Senate panel by declaring the armor as private property that has brought world peace.  Stark's competitor, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is desperate to claim the military's approval for armored weaponry.  Stark's main girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is trying to help him run Stark Enterprises despite Tony's childish antics and thrill seeking.  His buddy, Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle taking over for Terrence Howard), is under pressure by the military to get the Iron Man technology.  A new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson), has a mysterious background.  All this as Starks' blood is beginning to get poisoned by his ebbing, artificial heart.Enter the Russian, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father was snubbed by Stark's dad.  He has developed a body armor that has electric whips, while Hammer provides him the resources to exact revenge.  Stark must come to terms with the distant relationship with his late father as he desperately searches for an answer to his failing heart.  As Hammer presents his new military hardware to an audience, Ivan and Tony engage in a battle royal.What the filmmakers needed to do (and could have done a bit more) was to let Downey carry the film on his shoulders; he's certainly earned the right to flex his acting muscles after Iron Man.  Here, he shows off his flair for being a bad boy whose arrogance is matched by his tech savvy, and he is a hero confronting his inner demons and pain which are directly related to the fallout with his father.  It is interesting how poppa Stark is portrayed in newsreel footage as a kind of Industrial version of Walt Disney complete with a topographic industrial plan instead of a theme park.Downey and Paltrow have good repartee and a smooth chemistry even when they argue.  The dialogue is snappy and at times funny courtesy of screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) and director Jon Favreau who still knows how to convey the fantasy world of super heroes, and there are enough twists and surprises to keep things humming along.Rourke is sufficiently menacing as Ivan, spouting Russian and a dark, defiant persona.  Samuel Jackson repeats as Nick Fury, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., a secret organization that is attempting to assemble `The Avengers Initiative'.  Johansson is on screen too briefly but there is a nice payoff where she comes through in fine form, or should I say fighting form.  As a US Senator, comedian Garry Shandling is stunt casting but proves a bit of a distraction; you just can't take his character seriously.  Marvel co-creator Stan Lee makes another brief cameo, and Favreau is amusing in a larger supporting role of Happy Hogan.Special effects are impressive and ably serve the story.  That suit of armor still wows and functions in true comic book form.  There is a familiar, circular prop that appears in a crucial scene that Marvel fans will want to note!

1247948,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0021L8V1G,DanD,"[5, 8]","Let's get this straight: If it hadn't been for THE DARK KNIGHT coming out a couple months later, IRON MAN would have been THE superhero movie of 2008.  It's still one of the best entries in the genre, with a complex plot, superior special effects, and the quick wit and sharp poignancy of Robert Downey Jr.The sequel, while featuring all three, is a letdown; while I knew to lower my expectations, they still weren't met.  The problems here are two-fold: miscasting, and a script that doesn't dare to be dark enough.  For the miscasting: obviously, Downey is still in fine form, though he doesn't get to ad-lib as much here.  Mickey Rourke doesn't have a whole lot to do; he and Downey share one (and only one) non-combat scene together, which is indeed a highlight of the film, even with minimal dialogue--proof that, when you put two great actors together alone in a room, you'll get great things.  Don Cheadle simply does not have Terrence Howard's charisma; he's a fine actor, but the role of Rhodey calls for more than mere talent.  Scarlett Johansson is utterly wasted; she's an amazing actress, but she's here for eye candy and nothing but.  Gwyneth Paltrow is as charming here as she was in the first film; and Sam Rockwell, in an utterly two-dimensional villainous role, does the best with what he's got.  Sam Jackson does his Sam Jackson thing as Nick Fury; take it or leave it, unfortunately his character isn't that essential to the film.Now for the script, from otherwise-talented scribe (and actor) Justin Theroux.  It's not deep; it's not dark.  And yet it tries to be both.  Is Rourke's Ivan Vanko justified in his anger towards Tony Stark?  Was Stark's father maybe not the paragon of virtue that Tony always thought?  How is Stark coping with the fact that he's dying (not a spoiler, by the way; you find out early enough)?  These are deep, penetrating issues, which promised to elevate IRON MAN 2 to an almost DARK KNIGHT level.  Instead, when a problem arises, we have an answer within a few minutes, miraculously provided by a minor character.  The movie doesn't deal with issues--it avoids them like the plague.  The first IRON MAN had a dark underbelly; it was never overly prominent, but it was there, lending the film an edge usually missing from the genre.  IRON MAN 2 is more family-friendly; it's meant to be a pleasing popcorn flick and nothing more.  It should have been more, which is why the film comes off as so disappointing.  For a film with such talent behind it--director, writer, cast--IRON MAN 2 fizzles halfway through, never reaching its potential, never being what we all wanted it to be.  It's less than the sum of its parts; it's still entertaining (hence the 3 Stars), and it's worth a repeated viewing or two, but in a post-IRON MAN/DARK KNIGHT world, we need more from our superhero movies than guys in costumes finding other guys in costumes.  We need depth, and you won't find much here.  The most poignant thing here is Vanko's love for his bird; for avian enthusiasts, maybe that's enough.",3,"A letdown, though still an entertaining superhero film.",1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,3040,"['Let', 'get', 'straight', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'coming', 'out', 'couple', 'months', 'later', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'THE', 'superhero', 'movie', '2008', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'entries', 'genre', 'complex', 'plot', 'superior', 'special', 'effects', 'quick', 'wit', 'sharp', 'poignancy', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.The', 'sequel', 'featuring', 'three', 'letdown', 'knew', 'lower', 'expectations', 'still', 'were', ""n't"", 'met', 'problems', 'here', 'are', 'two-fold', 'miscasting', 'script', ""n't"", 'dare', 'be', 'dark', 'enough', 'miscasting', 'obviously', 'Downey', 'still', 'fine', 'form', ""n't"", 'get', 'ad-lib', 'much', 'here', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'do', 'Downey', 'share', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'non-combat', 'scene', 'together', 'indeed', 'highlight', 'film', 'even', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'proof', 'when', 'put', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'together', 'alone', 'room', ""'ll"", 'get', 'great', 'things', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'charisma', 'fine', 'actor', 'role', 'Rhodey', 'more', 'mere', 'talent', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'amazing', 'actress', 'here', 'eye', 'candy', 'nothing', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'charming', 'here', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'utterly', 'two-dimensional', 'villainous', 'role', 'best', 'what', 'got', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'thing', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'take', 'leave', 'unfortunately', 'character', ""n't"", 'that', 'essential', 'film.Now', 'script', 'otherwise-talented', 'scribe', 'actor', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'not', 'deep', 'not', 'dark', 'yet', 'be', 'Rourke', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'justified', 'anger', 'towards', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Was', 'Stark', 'father', 'maybe', 'not', 'paragon', 'virtue', 'Tony', 'always', 'thought', 'How', 'Stark', 'coping', 'fact', 'dying', 'not', 'spoiler', 'way', 'find', 'out', 'early', 'enough', 'are', 'deep', 'penetrating', 'issues', 'promised', 'elevate', 'IRON', 'MAN', '2', 'almost', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'level', 'Instead', 'when', 'problem', 'have', 'answer', 'few', 'minutes', 'miraculously', 'provided', 'minor', 'character', 'movie', ""n't"", 'deal', 'issues', 'plague', 'first', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'had', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'was', 'never', 'overly', 'prominent', 'was', 'there', 'lending', 'film', 'edge', 'usually', 'missing', 'genre', 'IRON', 'MAN', '2', 'more', 'family-friendly', 'meant', 'be', 'pleasing', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'nothing', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'why', 'film', 'off', 'so', 'disappointing', 'film', 'such', 'talent', 'director', 'writer', 'cast', 'IRON', 'MAN', '2', 'fizzles', 'halfway', 'never', 'reaching', 'potential', 'never', 'being', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'still', 'entertaining', 'hence', '3', 'Stars', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'two', 'post-IRON', 'MAN/DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'world', 'need', 'more', 'superhero', 'movies', 'guys', 'costumes', 'finding', 'other', 'guys', 'costumes', 'need', 'depth', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'here', 'most', 'poignant', 'thing', 'here', 'Vanko', 'love', 'bird', 'avian', 'enthusiasts', 'maybe', 'enough']",N/A

The film that I saw was a very poor sequel to Ironman, which is in no way, shape or form as good as The Dark Knight.  The first ten minutes was cut so tight that the performances felt like they were derived from a trailer.  The original had heart that balanced Tony Stark's narcissistic personality and his scenes with Pepper were cute and amusing to watch.  The scene where his arc generator needs to be replaced is hilarious because it is a life threatening situation but Tony doesn't seem phased at all.  In the sequel, there are very few redeeming scenes, and they seem to have wasted all the budget on extravagant locations and the Stark Expo.The single scene that was somewhat moving is when Tony discovers the message from his father Howard.  And Mickey Rourke's Vanco character could've had a great tie-in to the main plot if he held the key to saving Tony's life.  Instead, he just becomes a de facto villain and we have the ""Roger Roger"" bots that obviously are not going to cause any problems apart from a few bullet holes here and there.  Jeff Bridges was a much better villain than Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke put together.  The scene where he gets drunk and gets in a fight with War Machine is quite moronic and juvenile.

Director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux incorporated a large number of elements from the Marvel Universe (Iron Man, Whiplash, Nick Fury and SHIELD, the Black Widow, Justin Hammer, War Machine) but made it all pull together in a coherent narrative.  This bodes well for the upcoming Avengers film, which Favreau will help produce.

Terrence Howard would have been so much better continuing the roll. There was no interaction to develope any relationship between Cheadle and Downey's characters. As a reult Cheadle seems like an ass. To have him suddenly be an ally doesn't flow. Totally miscast and destroys any flow from the first movie. Cheadle tries to start by being sympatheic but their is no idication he is continuing Terrance Howards character. There is a no interaction until he's pissed because Tony's celebrating his birthday and steals the Warmachine suit.

I went into the film with lower expectations since most of the people I talked to said it was either as-good or not-as-good as part one, and was able to walk out of it feeling satisfied with the overall film. The humor was good, the action was fun, the graphics were impressive, and the acting was up to par.The movie follows Tony Stark/Iron Man as he deals with politics, media, and personal dangers incurred by the public disclosure of his secret identity and also faces a new enemy: the deadly son of a deceased Russian engineer that helped create some of the Stark enterprise.But concerning the actors, I was always disagreeable to the change of actors with Colonel Rhodes' character from Terrence Howard to Don Cheadle. It's not that I don't like Cheadle or think that he did a bad job, it's just that Howard fit into the character (and the suit) a lot better than did Cheadle. Cheadle's character seemed lost the entire film and too easily persuaded by both sides of conflict. He bounced back and forth to Stark's side and then back to the military side and then back to Stark and never really seemed to find his place. Even in the end he seemed conflicted on what ground he stood on.I also felt that Scarlett Johansson's character was overly-hyped by the previews and media and that her character was pretty unnecessary to the film. They really did not need her. Her job was to keep an eye on Tony Stark, but she was hardly around anyways and didn't seem to be as important as they tried to make her in the film.They also spent a lot of time in the movie building up a back-story for the new Avengers film. With all this prep and fine tuning for the Avengers via several other movies (Iron Man,Incredible Hulk,ThorandCaptain America), the film better blow the audience away or it's going to be a very, very, VERY big let down for the viewers.Other than that, I really enjoyed the film and felt that it deserved more applause than it was given.

Knowing that Chaplin's Robert Downey Junior was once again assigned to the lead role, I was reassured that this would not be another of those sequels that merely trades off the success of its predecessor (see Police Academy). The film didn't disappoint. It was more of the same, both in quality and tone, which is what I wanted, and I suppose most other Iron Man fans wanted.The story follows up from the original film, but is heavily influenced by Robocop and its sequels, with humour undercutting the drama in many places. It isn't so comedic that the serious part is undermined, but there are quite a few broad comedy moments. The character of Tony Stark disturbs a little in places, his self-destructive nature in terms of his business, his environment, and his health are all darker features of the character that elsewhere exhibits great optimism and positivity. Downey Junior brings this complex character to life - so that when he is out partying, you can see in his eyes the darker undertones of his personality. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, although a reset switch appears to have been hit, and the closeness they achieved towards the end of the first film is forgotten about and she is just his assistant, rather than nearly his wife. The relationship follows pretty much the same path this film, although she has a rival in the form of a sexy spy Scarlett Johansson, and an all star cast is completed with appearances from a very dirty looking Mickey Rourke as a Russian physicist with a grudge against Tony and Samuel Jackson as a spy pretty similar to the role he played in the Matrix.Don Cheadle is great as his friend, Rhodey, but he's a recast from Terrence Howard in the first film. Don makes a very good job of this and by the end, you forget that he's not the same actor, and Marvel Comics boss Stan Lee's cameo as Larry King has to be seen to be believed! Gary Shandling puts in a semi-comic performance as a senator, who is there to needle Stark, and threaten to take away his Iron Man suit. Shandling is just right for the role, looking now rather like a grinning Jimmy Carter/Kennedy type politician.Overall, the look of this on blu-ray is excellent, and you can see how well the sets and effects have been made, although it's a shame that the extras are very pedestrian, and it feels like little effort has been made with these. Clearly they are holding something back for the two disc edition, but this feels a bit mean, and makes disc collectors like me want to wait for ""ultimate edition""s before buying. This doesn't detract from the film though, which is heartily recommended to anyone who liked the original film.",5,Worthy Sequel consolidates film series,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,2758,"['Having', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'follow-up', 'Knowing', 'Chaplin', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Junior', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'assigned', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'reassured', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'sequels', 'merely', 'success', 'predecessor', 'see', 'Police', 'Academy', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'was', 'more', 'same', 'quality', 'tone', 'what', 'wanted', 'suppose', 'most', 'other', 'Iron', 'Man', 'wanted.The', 'story', 'up', 'original', 'film', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'Robocop', 'sequels', 'humour', 'undercutting', 'drama', 'many', 'places', ""n't"", 'so', 'comedic', 'serious', 'part', 'undermined', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'broad', 'comedy', 'moments', 'character', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'little', 'places', 'self-destructive', 'nature', 'terms', 'business', 'environment', 'health', 'are', 'darker', 'features', 'character', 'elsewhere', 'great', 'optimism', 'positivity', 'Downey', 'Junior', 'complex', 'character', 'life', 'so', 'when', 'out', 'partying', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'darker', 'undertones', 'personality', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'reset', 'switch', 'have', 'been', 'hit', 'closeness', 'achieved', 'towards', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'forgotten', 'just', 'assistant', 'rather', 'nearly', 'wife', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'path', 'film', 'rival', 'form', 'sexy', 'spy', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'star', 'cast', 'completed', 'appearances', 'very', 'dirty', 'looking', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Russian', 'physicist', 'grudge', 'Tony', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'spy', 'pretty', 'similar', 'role', 'played', 'Matrix.Don', 'Cheadle', 'great', 'friend', 'Rhodey', 'recast', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'first', 'film', 'Don', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'end', 'forget', 'not', 'same', 'actor', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'cameo', 'Larry', 'King', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Gary', 'Shandling', 'semi-comic', 'performance', 'senator', 'who', 'there', 'needle', 'Stark', 'threaten', 'take', 'away', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'Shandling', 'just', 'right', 'role', 'looking', 'now', 'rather', 'grinning', 'Jimmy', 'Carter/Kennedy', 'type', 'politician.Overall', 'look', 'blu-ray', 'excellent', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'sets', 'effects', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'shame', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'pedestrian', 'little', 'effort', 'been', 'made', 'Clearly', 'are', 'holding', 'something', 'back', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'bit', 'mean', 'disc', 'collectors', 'want', 'wait', 'ultimate', 'edition', 's', 'buying', ""n't"", 'detract', 'film', 'heartily', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'original', 'film']",N/A

Of course it is not going to be as good as the first movie, sequels hardly are (not to mention Iron Man 1 was practically a masterpiece in its own right).  While Iron Man throws in a few more characters from the marvel universe, this can be good, or this can be bad.Nick Fury, Black Widow and Agent Coulson make heavier appearances in Iron Man 2 that may lead one to think this is simply a precursor for the Avengers, which may have some truth to it.  On one hand, it does take some of the spotlight off of Tony, but given the nature of his well being throughout the story of Iron Man 2, I always felt it made perfect sense.  If not, then a little precursor to the Avengers is not a bad thing either, especially since that film turned out to be a Marvel masterpiece.My only complaints to Iron Man 2 are some slow patches in the story, and an action climax fight between Iron Man/War Machine and Whiplash that is over before the viewer can really enjoy it.On the other hand, Iron Man 2 is filled with bright spots, especially Sam Rockwell's performance of Justin Hammer, practically stealing the show.  Mickey Rourke does a fine job as Whiplash, although I would have enjoyed a little more from the second act from him.  Despite the fact of switching actors for Rhodey, from Terance Howard to Don Cheadle, Cheadle probably pulls off a better job, and we finally get to see War Machine (including a one on one against Iron Man.As always, Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, and pulls off the same humor and charm from the first film, even though we get to see a bit of a more troubling side of him this time around.Action, awesome visuals, jokes and humor, awesome characters - it's all here.  There may be some slow pacing issues and not enough of the good action, but one can not complain - Iron Man 2 remains a fun and entertaining entry in the Marvel series, even if it is not as sharp as some of Marvel's other projects.",4,A great sequel,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,2000,"['hardcore', 'Iron', 'Man/Marvel', 'fans', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'received', 'quite', 'bashing', 'course', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'movie', 'sequels', 'hardly', 'are', 'not', 'mention', 'Iron', 'Man', '1', 'was', 'practically', 'masterpiece', 'own', 'right', 'Iron', 'Man', 'few', 'more', 'characters', 'marvel', 'universe', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'bad.Nick', 'Fury', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Agent', 'Coulson', 'make', 'heavier', 'appearances', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'may', 'lead', 'one', 'think', 'simply', 'precursor', 'Avengers', 'may', 'have', 'truth', 'one', 'hand', 'take', 'spotlight', 'Tony', 'given', 'nature', 'well', 'being', 'story', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'always', 'felt', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'not', 'then', 'little', 'precursor', 'Avengers', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'especially', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Marvel', 'masterpiece.My', 'only', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'are', 'slow', 'patches', 'story', 'action', 'climax', 'fight', 'Iron', 'Man/War', 'Machine', 'Whiplash', 'viewer', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy', 'it.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'filled', 'bright', 'spots', 'especially', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'performance', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'practically', 'stealing', 'show', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'fine', 'job', 'Whiplash', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'more', 'second', 'act', 'fact', 'switching', 'actors', 'Rhodey', 'Terance', 'Howard', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Cheadle', 'probably', 'off', 'better', 'job', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'War', 'Machine', 'including', 'one', 'one', 'Iron', 'Man.As', 'always', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'IS', 'Iron', 'Man', 'same', 'humor', 'charm', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'troubling', 'side', 'time', 'around.Action', 'awesome', 'visuals', 'jokes', 'humor', 'awesome', 'characters', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'slow', 'pacing', 'issues', 'not', 'enough', 'good', 'action', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'complain', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'entry', 'Marvel', 'series', 'even', 'not', 'as', 'sharp', 'Marvel', 'other', 'projects']",N/A

Improvements include better action sequences and some great characters added to the franchise. Unfortunately there is a lot going on here and even though it isn't hard to follow, there isn't enough time to give each sub plot the proper screen time it deserves. Oddly enough for a super hero film, I think they could have edited some of the talky scenes down and added a little more Iron Man action.A good example of this is when we meet Natasha Romanova she isn't given much to do and I found myself wondering if she was going to be The Black Widow on screen. She is only in one action sequence (a great one with one of the funniest moments in the film) late in the movie and she and Nick Fury are really only in it to set up The Avengers movie. I'm not saying it should have been edited out, but there is only so much ground you can cover in two hours.Whiplash is played with gusto by Mickey Rourke adding some real menace to the role, but he doesn't get much screen time either and that seems to be this film's biggest flaw, no one but Tony Stark gets enough screen time.After the first encounter with Whiplash in Monaco on the race track, we don't really get a good dose of Iron man until the final battle, which means there is over an hour of time where there isn't that much action. Considering what I had read about this being an action packed film, I found it to be very talky. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the characters are well developed and the actors are all really good here.The final battle is very good with some very cool Iron Man destruction and some nifty moves, but it's surprising and anti-climatic when Whiplash is defeated very quickly.In the first film, I thought the final battle was too long and in this one, it just seemed to end too abruptly. I'm not bashing this film in any way as it is a very fun film, but I think the story may have been a little too ambitious for one film.Overall I give Iron Man 2 a solid B (4 stars) and I think Favreau did a very good job all things considered.

Director Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. (reprising Tony Stark/Iron Man) dare to give the man behind the iron mask a mission besides saving the world: saving himself, with a little help from unexpected friends.As the story begins, Tony Stark faces the consequences of revealing his Iron Man identity.  The government and a rival arms inventor (an over-the-top Sam Rockwell) want the suit; a revenge-seeking Russian physicist (a perfectly cast Mickey Rourke) is after Tony; and Tony himself is being poisoned by the miniature nuclear reactor that keeps him alive.  Tony slowly self-destructs, wrecking his business, his relationships with long-suffering personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Air Force buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), and finally his status as Iron Man.At rock bottom, Tony gets a hand up from Colonel Nick Fury of SHIELD (a nicely restrained Samuel L. Jackson).  Fury provides Tony with a means, and a motivation, to work out his own salvation.  En route to a smashing finale, Tony gets a key assist from Fury's undercover contact inside Stark Industries.

I won't go into a plot synopsis (there will be plenty) but will point out where it succeeded and where it missed.Success - Tony Stark.  Once again Robert Downy Jr. IS Tony Stark.  Part jerk, part nice guy, eccentric (I don't like people handing me things), a genius and totally self absorbed. He's such a flawed and human character - this part of what makes him such a fun character to watch.  What other hero puts on his super suit and gets drunk (OK aside from the Comedian).  It's so fun to realize most of his problems are all his own fault.Miss - Pepper Potts.  I liked her in the first movie but I didn't see any development here.  She seemed static and a bit of a whiner.Success - Hammer.  Stark's rival and replacement weapons contractor to the military.  Calling Sam Rockwell's character the anti-Stark has already become clich&eacute; so I'll just say that he was fun to watch and fun to hate.Miss - Rhodes.  I didn't think Don Cheadle brought any more to the roll than Terrence Howard and I never really believed in this supposed strong friendship between Stark and Rhodes.  I didn't hate him or love him he was just there.Success - Whiplash/Ivan.  Mickey Rourke plays this villain in an understated way.  No big theatrics or speeches (no monologueing) just an attack on the man he hates.  And seriously if there is one man I do not ever want to be on the bad side of it is Mickey Rourke.  And kudos to the movie for not feeling the need to name every villain and character.  Imagine how easily it could have turned into camp if he'd busted out on the track and yelled, ""Call me Whiplash!""  Plenty of other movies fall into this trap of feeling they have to name the villain.  Dude, we know who it is.Success - Black Widow.  I was really unsure about her inclusion and the casting but it all turned out really well and Scarlet really brought it.  Her action scenes were smoothly executed and not too over the top.Success - War Machine armor = Awesome.You'll notice a trend above that these points have to do mostly with the characters.  That's because they are all so much fun to watch interact for the most part - even the miss ones are elevated by the success ones.  For example a big fight between a drunk Tony and a mad Rhody, both in armor, is a highlight.  I will admit that there are long stretches of no action but in those stretches is *character development* which is nice so we care about what happends during the action.  When the action comes it is great.  I will admit that the final action piece did not cause as much tension as the first one though - I didn't quite feel the danger like I had during that first battle.It's easy to look at this cast of characters and fear that the movie will be come an overloaded mess (Spider-Man 3, Batman and Robin) but it doesn't which is an achievement in itself.There were copious amounts of Avenger foreshadowing going on.  Someone is getting excited at the studio.  There are lots of little winks for the fans but I could see it being overlooked by the non-fan.Are there plot holes?  Yeah, a couple.  But nothing disastrous and I'm sure there are bits on the cutting room floor that would have plugged them.  For me it was when the heck did Tony decide to install an independent arc reactor in the Mark II?  But then it was hinted that maybe he wanted Rhodes to take the suit.It is a very fun and worthwhile movie so I'll be crossing my fingers for IM3.  You know some studio exec is going to step in and try to overstuff it.

1247991,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B0021L8V1G,dylan21484nj,"[2, 3]","Robert Downey Jr. continues down his comeback trail by reprising the role that made him the household name he always should have been (for the right reasons, anyway) as charismatic, fast-talking billionaire Tony Stark in Iron Man 2. The original 2007 film raised the bar for superhero films (a bar raised even higher by a certain Caped Crusader a few months later), and Iron Man 2 strives to match that mark. But unfortunately, it misses said mark.When we last saw Stark, he was commiting the superhero cardinal sin - he admitted to the world that he is Iron Man, the armored sentinel of justice. Of course, this has upped his notoriety exponentially, but has also raised the ire of a whole new crop of enemies. The U.S. government wants Stark to give up the Iron Man ""weapon"" for military use, a campaign spearheaded by Senator Stern (Gary Shandling). Rival weapons dealer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) wants to put Stark Industries out of business. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of the man who helped Tony's father create the ARC reactor that powers the Iron Man suit and keeps Tony alive, builds his own battle suit and becomes Whiplash in order to exact revenge on Tony.You'd think that would be enough to fill one movie, but no. On top of these foes, the ARC reactor in Tony's chest is slowly poisoning him. A new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannsen), is much more than a pretty face. Stark's best friend Rhodey (Don Cheadle, replacing Terence Howard), suits up as Iron Man's ally War Machine, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is pressuing Stark to join The Avengers. Phew.With Iron Man 2, director Jon Favreau feels the customary obligation to overachieve in order to out-do its predecessor, but its failure lies in just that. There's so much going on here, that you feel like you could make an Iron Man 3 out of half the stuff. What's worse is that some of the elements seem needless. Involving Nick Fury and Black Widow seems to serve more as a build-up to the upcoming Avengers movie than to serve Iron Man 2's actual plot, and Tony Stark hands over the CEO reins of Stark Industries to Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) seemingly just to give her something to do. This all helps to create a frivolous, unmomentous feel to the film, leaving the film lacking in emotional weight.But that doesn't mean that the film doesn't have redeeming qualities. Robert Downey Jr.'s sly, witty portrayal of Tony Stark is like a beacon among a crowded cast of characters. And though the cast feels bloated, the characters are very well fleshed out, so much so  that it almost doesn't matter that the film is quite frankly light on action. But when the action does kick in, it's done very well. I just wish we got to see a little more. Like the original film, there's an extra zinger of a scene after the credits, but Iron Man 2's big reveal is not quite as ""geektastic"" as the surprise appearance of Sam Jackson's Nick Fury.The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Pack allows you to watch the movie in just about every way possible, and includes commentary by Favreau, making-of documentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and deleted scenes. Also included is a S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault feature which includes bios of not just the Iron Man film characters but bios of other Marvel Films character (like The Incredible Hulk) that can be updated in the future with an internet connection, which will likely include Thor and Captain America, as those characters' films are aiming for a release next year.In summary, the film is enjoyable, the characters are good, Robert Downey Jr. once again shines, and the action is well done, though the film feels overstuffed and a bit inconsequential. The extras are what you'd normally find on DVD's and Blu-Rays, though the updatable S.H.I.E.L.D. Vault is a creative touch.",3,"Good follow-up to the original, but not great",1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,3833,"['Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'down', 'comeback', 'trail', 'reprising', 'role', 'made', 'household', 'name', 'always', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'reasons', 'anyway', 'charismatic', 'fast-talking', 'billionaire', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'original', '2007', 'film', 'raised', 'bar', 'superhero', 'films', 'bar', 'raised', 'even', 'higher', 'certain', 'Caped', 'Crusader', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'strives', 'match', 'mark', 'unfortunately', 'said', 'mark.When', 'last', 'saw', 'Stark', 'was', 'commiting', 'superhero', 'cardinal', 'sin', 'admitted', 'world', 'Iron', 'Man', 'armored', 'sentinel', 'justice', 'course', 'upped', 'notoriety', 'exponentially', 'also', 'raised', 'ire', 'whole', 'new', 'crop', 'enemies', 'U.S.', 'government', 'Stark', 'give', 'up', 'Iron', 'Man', 'weapon', 'military', 'use', 'campaign', 'spearheaded', 'Senator', 'Stern', 'Gary', 'Shandling', 'Rival', 'weapons', 'dealer', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'put', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'business', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'son', 'man', 'who', 'helped', 'Tony', 'father', 'create', 'ARC', 'reactor', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'Tony', 'alive', 'builds', 'own', 'battle', 'suit', 'Whiplash', 'order', 'exact', 'revenge', 'Tony.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'fill', 'one', 'movie', 'top', 'foes', 'ARC', 'reactor', 'Tony', 'chest', 'slowly', 'poisoning', 'new', 'assistant', 'Natalie', 'Rushman', 'Scarlett', 'Johannsen', 'much', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'Stark', 'best', 'friend', 'Rhodey', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'replacing', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'suits', 'up', 'Iron', 'Man', 'ally', 'War', 'Machine', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'agent', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'pressuing', 'Stark', 'join', 'Avengers', 'Phew.With', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'director', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'customary', 'obligation', 'overachieve', 'order', 'out-do', 'predecessor', 'failure', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'here', 'feel', 'could', 'make', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'stuff', 'What', 'worse', 'elements', 'seem', 'needless', 'Involving', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Black', 'Widow', 'serve', 'more', 'build-up', 'upcoming', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'serve', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'actual', 'plot', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'CEO', 'reins', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'seemingly', 'just', 'give', 'something', 'do', 'create', 'frivolous', 'unmomentous', 'feel', 'film', 'leaving', 'film', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'weight.But', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'sly', 'witty', 'portrayal', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'beacon', 'crowded', 'cast', 'characters', 'cast', 'feels', 'bloated', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'almost', ""n't"", 'matter', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'light', 'action', 'when', 'action', 'kick', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'just', 'wish', 'got', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'original', 'film', 'extra', 'zinger', 'scene', 'credits', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'big', 'reveal', 'not', 'quite', 'geektastic', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'Nick', 'Fury.The', 'Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital', 'Copy', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'way', 'possible', 'commentary', 'Favreau', 'making-of', 'documentaries', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Also', 'included', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'Data', 'Vault', 'feature', 'bios', 'not', 'just', 'Iron', 'Man', 'film', 'characters', 'bios', 'other', 'Marvel', 'Films', 'character', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'can', 'be', 'updated', 'future', 'internet', 'connection', 'will', 'likely', 'include', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'characters', 'films', 'are', 'aiming', 'release', 'next', 'year.In', 'summary', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'once', 'again', 'shines', 'action', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'feels', 'overstuffed', 'bit', 'inconsequential', 'extras', 'are', 'what', ""'d"", 'normally', 'find', 'DVD', 'Blu-Rays', 'updatable', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'Vault', 'creative', 'touch']",N/A

1247994,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B0021L8V1G,E. David Swan,"[1, 1]","You can't fault Iron Man 2 for not being pretty. The movie looks awesome if you can stay awake for the whole thing. Amazingly there is almost no action throughout but if I focus on that I'll just be repeating what a hundred other reviews have already said. My bigger problem is with the main plot. The movie opens with Tony Stark MC'ing `Stark Expo' and basically coming off like a rich arrogant jerk. We then cut to Ivan Vanko, a heavily scarred and tattooed Russian living in poverty who sets off to build his own super suit to take revenge on Tony Stark for um.... well, something that supposedly Stark's dad did to his dad but I don't remember it ever being spelled out. So the entire motivation of Vanko is left undefined. The contrast between Stark in his absurdly futuristic lab and the brutal but brilliant Vanko in his dingy, dark apartment with equipment piled high seemed like it was taking its cues from Rocky III. In the third Rocky movie Rocky was living the high life as champion of the world while the much hungrier Clubber Lang trained with everything he had in a filthy, rat infested gym. Lang handed Rocky a crushing defeat because he fought and trained with more heart and Rocky only regained his belt by humbling himself and returning to his roots. By contrast Tony Stark defeats Vanko twice fairly handily and the Champaign never stops flowing. So who is the hero and who is the villain? Vanko's only motivation was nebulous revenge on Stark and his defeat was crushing and humiliating against the endless resources of the pompous Stark. In the final fight Iron Man and War Machine are surrounded by dozens of Vanko's drones only have Stark whip out a laser slicing them all in half without hardly breaking a sweat. I know Iron Man is supposed to be the hero with flaws but good lord is it hard to root for him.Early in the movie Tony Stark is called before a Senate committee led by Senator Stern (Garry Shandling). The Senator is concerned that a private citizen has such a powerful weapon and demands it be turned over to the government. His other concern is that other countries are trying to duplicate the technology. Stark gives the Senate the finger and given the ratings of the current U.S. Senate I can imagine people enjoying this scene but the truth is that Stern is right. Whether he designed the weapon or not is irrelevant this is incredibly dangerous technology and when you get right down to it Stark has been shown to be very irresponsible such as in the scene later where a drunken Iron Man starts shooting wine bottle and watermelons thrown by models. After defeating Vanko, Stern has no choice but to award Stark a medal and the rich guy with the Iron Man suit wins again.Since Vanko is clearly an overmatched opponent the writers gave Stark another issue to deal with. The arc reactor in his chest is poisoning his blood but you'd never know it since he seems fit as a fiddle even as the toxicity level exceeds 50%. So what he needs is a new element to replace the palladium core and leave the reactor safe. Guess what, his father discovered the element... and hid it... because... wait, hold on a second. How did his father know he was going to need an element since the shrapnel in his chest occurred long after his dad died and if his dad discovered this wonder element why did he hide it in this absurdly complicated hiding place? It makes absolutely no sense other then to look COOL onscreen as Stark uses his super technology to decode the secret. Having a NEW more powerful core Stark is in an even better place then at the start of the movie and everything is coming up roses. So we have a detestable character who wins in every possible way and learns nothing.The movie looks fantastic and with Robert Downey, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell not to mention Samual L. Jackson and Garry Shandling the acting is great. High marks to Rourke in particular and it's a shame the poor Vanko was so dominated. I didn't mention Don Cheadel because he seemed to be sleepwalking through this role and Gwyneth Paltrow was a bit too shrill for my taste. The only real problem with the film is the plot but it's a killer. I used to think Superman Returns was the slowest big budget superhero movie but that one is action packed next to Iron Man 2. The racetrack scene with Vanko half an hour in is the best scene in the movie and from then on it just plods along. This one is DEFINETLY a rental.

1247998,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0021L8V1G,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","The inevitable sequel to the2008 smash hitproves once again the perfect fit between actor and character as Robert Downey Jr. plays the title role with his rakish wit and deep sense of irony fully intact from the first film. Sharply directed once again by actor Jon Favreau and shrewdly written by another actor, Justin Theroux, the 2010 blockbuster is as much an actors' showcase as it is a special effects-saturated comic book adventure. This precarious balance is what made the first film so ideal, and while the surprise element has been replaced in part by a breezy familiarity in the sequel, the result is still far more entertaining than most in its genre. This is despite the fact that the movie is overpopulated with colorful characters, most worthy of a film of their own.Overkill is a common problem in heavily invested Hollywood studio product like this, and one can quibble that nobody except Downey gets sufficient screen time to make a compelling impression. As hedonistic billionaire Tony Stark, the actor has to face off with no less than three villains, two other figures who are intentionally put on a nebulous fence between good and evil, the mysterious director of a clandestine organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and a love interest designed to be either a sharp, take-charge businesswoman or a helpless damsel in distress depending on the plot machinations. The story picks up Stark six months after the ending of the first film as he boasts to a rapt audience at the re-instituted Stark Expo how he has maintained world peace with his impenetrable suit of armor. However, underneath his hubris, Stark hides the fact that he is dying from poisoning by the palladium core in the arc reactor that gives him not only his unique powers but his re-born life.Meanwhile, taciturn, cockatoo-loving Russian physicist Ivan Vanko is plotting revenge against Stark for the act of betrayal he feels Stark's father committed against his dying arms-dealer father. In fact, Vanko has designed his own arc reactor with the intent of destroying Stark, an act almost realized at the Circuit de Monaco. Stark's smarmy business rival, fellow weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer, will stop at nothing to secure the secret to Stark's armored suit, while U.S. Senator Stern of Pennsylvania wants Stark prosecuted for crimes against the state. On the fence about Stark is a carryover from the first storyline, Lt. Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, whose friendship with the billionaire is severely tested by Stark's excessively destructive behavior. A new character, Natalie Rushman, is introduced in an ambivalent manner as a new assistant to replace Pepper Potts, Stark's feisty gal Friday-turned-CEO. Natalie's motivations are revealed in due time. It all comes to a head at the expo where Vanko and Hammer have colluded to produce an aerial battle royale.That's a whole lot of plot to fit into a 124-minute movie, but at least the momentum never flags. The problem for comic fanboys may well be the dearth of action sequences. The showdowns between Stark and Vanko create the necessary tension although the build-ups are rather predictable, and the climactic battle sequence feels more like a swirling meteor shower since it takes place at night. Still, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and art director J. Michael Riva do first-rate work here with the production details. Moreover, the actors do their best even if their characters are given short shrift in the screenplay. Mickey Rourke relies on his own uncomfortably maniacal screen persona and idiosyncratic touches to embody Vanko's two-dimensional motives, while Sam Rockwell is even more cartoonish with a petulant, hammy albeit amusing turn as Hammer.Replacing Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle does what he can as the put-upon best friend and archetypal soldier, but Rhodey has to represent the film's most thankless role. A surprisingly cast Garry Shandling brings a nice edge to the avuncular senator, and Favreau himself repeats his role as Stark's loyal chauffeur Happy Hogan. No fool as a director, he gets to face off to primarily comic effect with Scarlett Johansson, properly feline and physically adroit in her black catsuit, as Natalie. Her ball-breakingCharlie's Angels-style fight sequence is entertaining if a bit derivative. As Pepper, Gwyneth Paltrow gets more to do this time around, bantering with Downey with Nick-and-Nora-level &eacute;lan, but the character is near-impossible to believe. Fans, however, will have no problem loving and believing in the sequel, but the pervasive one-liners and the wild zigzags between hubris and insecurity make a strong case to redub the hero Irony

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 5]","IRON MAN 2 is mostly a formality for me to review, as I was rather taken with the original film and I try to cover sequels when possible. Sadly, this film is a disappointing Ny-quel, and barely ranks up there with the TRANSFORMERS. In this oddly paced and virtually uninteresting oeuvre, Tony Stark is hogging the screen in an annoying way, but even worse is the I'm-totally-stupid-live-on-CNN kind of air.That tends to stink up a film really quickly for me, anyway. I presume there was supposed to be a storyline about Stark ""privatizing world peace"" and the decay in his body from the heart-plug. Jeez, call me a purist, but I can't see this happening to good old Iron Man at this insane level. And having a character 'rate' Tony Stark as a narcissist doesn't help. Downey is barely earning his paycheck here, simply by showing up--not a good sign.I hope he doesn't do that in SHERLOCK HOLMES 2....This film had ZERO humor in it--did anyone else notice that? The first film was 100 times better.  Scarlett Johansson was literally a YAWN, which, to me, she usually is. Her squeaky little girlie appeals have no effect on me whatsoever, though I thought the action scenes were well executed. (I'm sure that isn't her in those scenes.) Samuel L. Jackson and the usually impressive Mickey Rourke were sad afterthoughts the way they were presented here, and...Sam Rockwell??...what the hell??Don Cheadle always cheers me up, and here he is a class act as well. So, uh, someone tell me again why does he act like a complete blow-hole to his friend Tony Stark?--anyway, good to see him and Mickey Rourke (who does a brilliant Russian, by the way).Most interesting to me, ignored for the most part of course, was the appearance and significance of Tony Stark's father, Howard (a guy I always liked, John Slattery). He's half Howard Hughes, half Walt Disney (amazing how these three resemble one another). So of course he gets a few seconds onscreen and...what was I even saying?And that is how you'll feel after you've seen this: like you're either getting Alzheimer's, or else you just don't get it.",2,This is how I go to the bathroom in my suit!,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,2094,"['IRON', 'MAN', '2', 'mostly', 'formality', 'review', 'was', 'rather', 'taken', 'original', 'film', 'try', 'cover', 'sequels', 'when', 'possible', 'Sadly', 'film', 'disappointing', 'Ny-quel', 'barely', 'up', 'there', 'TRANSFORMERS', 'oddly', 'paced', 'virtually', 'uninteresting', 'oeuvre', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'hogging', 'screen', 'annoying', 'way', 'even', 'worse', ""I'm-totally-stupid-live-on-CNN"", 'kind', 'air.That', 'stink', 'up', 'film', 'really', 'quickly', 'anyway', 'presume', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'storyline', 'Stark', 'privatizing', 'world', 'peace', 'decay', 'body', 'heart-plug', 'Jeez', 'call', 'purist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'happening', 'good', 'old', 'Iron', 'Man', 'insane', 'level', 'having', 'character', ""'rate"", 'Tony', 'Stark', 'narcissist', ""n't"", 'help', 'Downey', 'barely', 'earning', 'paycheck', 'here', 'simply', 'showing', 'up', 'not', 'good', 'sign.I', 'hope', ""n't"", 'do', 'SHERLOCK', 'HOLMES', '2', '.This', 'film', 'had', 'ZERO', 'humor', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'notice', 'first', 'film', 'was', '100', 'times', 'better', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'was', 'literally', 'YAWN', 'usually', 'squeaky', 'little', 'girlie', 'appeals', 'have', 'effect', 'whatsoever', 'thought', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'executed', ""'m"", 'sure', ""n't"", 'scenes', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'usually', 'impressive', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'were', 'sad', 'afterthoughts', 'way', 'were', 'presented', 'here', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'what', 'hell', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'always', 'cheers', 'here', 'class', 'act', 'well', 'So', 'uh', 'someone', 'tell', 'again', 'why', 'act', 'complete', 'blow-hole', 'friend', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'anyway', 'good', 'see', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'brilliant', 'Russian', 'way', '.Most', 'interesting', 'ignored', 'most', 'part', 'course', 'was', 'appearance', 'significance', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'father', 'Howard', 'guy', 'always', 'liked', 'John', 'Slattery', 'half', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'half', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'amazing', 'how', 'three', 'resemble', 'one', 'So', 'course', 'few', 'seconds', 'onscreen', 'what', 'was', 'even', 'saying', 'how', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'re"", 'getting', 'Alzheimer', 'else', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get']",N/A

1248004,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0021L8V1G,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","Sequels are notoriously difficult to pull off. While the first Iron Man was great, this one just comes off as well, a sequel. The plot is basically an excuse to give Iron Man another villain. Unfortunately, this is where things fall apart. Rather than have an interesting plot the builds over time, the film just pits Iron Man against a Russian super genius Vanko who wants revenge against the stark family. I suspect that part of the problem is that Iron Man was simply too powerful in the first movie, so the producers never found a suitable challenge for the hero. Indeed, as far as the plot goes, you could substitute almost any comic book hero and not tell the difference.However, unlike most comic book movies nowadays, Robert Downey Jr.'s (Stark/Iron Man) performance makes up for some of the weaknesses in the plot. His carefree attitude and sassiness are a joy to watch. He personifies the secret desire many of us have to just give the world the finger (in fact, he nearly does do that during testimony before the Senate). The film has some strong moments when Stark realizes he might die soon and struggles with how to live the rest of his life. But these parts are too few and too far in between to save the plot.

1248006,A2GPRA9HHLOC4B,B0021L8V1G,Eric L. Willard,"[1, 1]","First and foremost, I will agree with other reviews that this movies action didn't stand up to the original. There was a quite a bit more talking and plot formation going on but it DID seem to be because of the introduction of new characters and foreshadowing to future events or even the Avengers movie.The introduction of the plotline that the tech that Tony is using is killing him was a big story arc in the comics and was an interesting way to introduce the new arc reactor (triangle chest plate).The replacement of Terence Howard with Don Cheadle was not a happy thought at first but after watching the movie, Don seemed more like War Machine in the long run. In the extra features, there are some good featurettes of War Machine's back-story and how the Military got ahold of the suit.Someone said, they were upset that the Black Widow only does any action at the end and she is beating up cops. No..She is beating up security guards. There is a difference. It was a very short scene and we would liked to have seen more action from her.Someone said, there was no explaination of why Whiplash (Mickey Rourke) hated Tony Stark. This is very false. It is somewhat explained in the movie that Tony's dad was credited with the arc reactor tech but if you look at the spec's or blueprints, Whiplash's fathers name is clearly on the spec's as a designer and they even tell you that his father was a scientist/physicist and Whiplash was also a very accomplished physicist before his family's downfall. Whiplash himself explains that if it wasn't for his father, Tony and Whiplash wouldn't be the men they are.Make sure to watch the short scene after the credits. hint hintDo not let these 2 star reviews sway you. Although it does not stand up to the action you would expect from an Iron Man movie, I will still give it 3-4 stars for the movie in general.Gary Shandling rules...Watch the featurettes.",4,3-4 stars,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,1900,"['First', 'foremost', 'will', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'movies', 'action', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'original', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'talking', 'plot', 'formation', 'going', 'DID', 'seem', 'be', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters', 'foreshadowing', 'future', 'events', 'even', 'Avengers', 'introduction', 'plotline', 'tech', 'Tony', 'using', 'killing', 'was', 'big', 'story', 'arc', 'comics', 'was', 'interesting', 'way', 'introduce', 'new', 'arc', 'reactor', 'triangle', 'chest', 'plate', '.The', 'replacement', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'thought', 'first', 'watching', 'movie', 'Don', 'seemed', 'more', 'War', 'Machine', 'long', 'run', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'good', 'featurettes', 'War', 'Machine', 'back-story', 'how', 'Military', 'got', 'ahold', 'suit.Someone', 'said', 'were', 'upset', 'Black', 'Widow', 'only', 'action', 'end', 'beating', 'up', 'cops', 'No..She', 'beating', 'up', 'security', 'guards', 'difference', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'scene', 'would', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'action', 'her.Someone', 'said', 'was', 'explaination', 'why', 'Whiplash', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'hated', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'very', 'false', 'somewhat', 'explained', 'movie', 'Tony', 'dad', 'was', 'credited', 'arc', 'reactor', 'tech', 'look', 'spec', 'blueprints', 'Whiplash', 'fathers', 'name', 'clearly', 'spec', 'designer', 'even', 'tell', 'father', 'was', 'scientist/physicist', 'Whiplash', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'accomplished', 'physicist', 'family', 'downfall', 'Whiplash', 'was', ""n't"", 'father', 'Tony', 'Whiplash', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'men', 'are.Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'short', 'scene', 'credits', 'hint', 'hintDo', 'not', 'let', '2', 'star', 'reviews', 'sway', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'action', 'would', 'expect', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'will', 'still', 'give', '3-4', 'stars', 'movie', 'general.Gary', 'Shandling', 'rules', 'Watch', 'featurettes']",N/A

GET A LIFE!Though biased, since I didn't exactly love the first Iron Man, I can safely assume I am not alone when I say this was a complete disappointment. Like many others, the superhero genre is one I watch in earnest, never criticizing it for comedic relief, stellar effects, and villains that make Lugosi look like an infant. Still, we have all been let down by the recent slew of crap that has been parading in theaters for the past several summers, and this release proves studios are just done trying to keep us from getting pissed off. Strong words, but the fact that there is an actual scene where Stark pretends to crap himself in the suit (oh yes, this happens) makes for a perfect example of laziness. The final battle is definitely better than the anticlimactic one from the previous film, but it's the only interesting thing about the movie. Less action this time, and more emphasis on Stark's struggles, not all that interesting considering the plot holed story (Nick Fury isn't indicated in SHIELD until he's on screen for at least ten minutes, leaving people in the dark to who the hell he is.) and bogus comedy, which is as immature as the racist robots from Transformers 2; a decent comparison, to be quite frank. Stay far away from this Marvel fiascolet's take everything that was good about the first one and do it bigger!! forget character development! the best part of this movie was when Tony finds the message from his father that says ""You were my greatest creation."" That right there was the only redeeming quality of the screenplay i could find. i felt like they were trying to do too many things with this film, just like spider man 3. after this, i don't want to hear anymore complaining about spiderman 3 because this movie has the same exact problems and no one puts this film on blast like they do spider man 3!! another problem i had is that all the battle scenes are in the lamest locations! Tony's luxury apartment that looks like a night club? i don't want to see iron man face off with war machine in a night club looking luxury apartment. that is lame. out of all the locations on this planet they pick a luxury apartment. also not enough mickey rourke!! i hated the whole Hammer scheme thing, i felt like i was watching a movie from Fox news!! yuck! also why is black widow in this? she serves no purpose other than to have fans say ""hey that's black widow!"" her role was empty and hollow. also what's with the director giving himself his own action scene?! stay behind the camera fatty!! i didn't pay to see a white man in a tux fight, i paid to see iron man!!!! also the way Tony addresses the court or investigators was sooooo far fetched it was like ""c'mon nobody can talk like that to an official."" also how convenient was it for tony to wirelessly send satellite projections across the screen during that investigation. it was like c'mon!!! at least try to be creative in presenting your information. i hate it when characters magically do computer hacks when in reality it's far more complicated than that!! also the way Don took Tony's suit was soooo lame, almost like how your kid brother goes into your closet when your not looking to take your clothes. so Tony has all this high tech stuff but can't put a lock on his war machine suit?! this is Don, ""Tony give up the suit."" this is Tony, ""No."" don then goes into Tony's closet and steals it like it was a polo shirt. THAT DEFINITLY WAS NOT HOW MY DREAM BATTLE BETWEEN TONY AND WAR MACHINE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE!!!!!there was something also about how Tony was carrying himself in this film, as if his road to redemption in the first film never happened;he just went right back to being a narcissitic capitalistic pig. point blank, this movie sucked and i only gave it 2 stars for the cinematography. poor writing, poor set locations, poor directing, and the worst final showdown of all time!! bad guy is beaten with a tag teaming fart, plew! mickeys dead...",2,Dissapointing,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,4048,"['HEY', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'SAY', 'A', 'REVIEW', 'IS', ""N'T"", 'HELPFUL', 'BECAUSE', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'AGREE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'OPINION', 'EXPRESSED', 'GET', 'LIFE', 'biased', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'love', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'can', 'safely', 'assume', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'when', 'say', 'was', 'complete', 'disappointment', 'many', 'others', 'superhero', 'genre', 'one', 'watch', 'earnest', 'never', 'criticizing', 'comedic', 'relief', 'stellar', 'effects', 'make', 'Lugosi', 'look', 'infant', 'Still', 'have', 'been', 'let', 'down', 'recent', 'slew', 'crap', 'been', 'parading', 'theaters', 'past', 'several', 'summers', 'release', 'studios', 'are', 'just', 'done', 'trying', 'keep', 'getting', 'pissed', 'off', 'Strong', 'words', 'fact', 'actual', 'scene', 'where', 'Stark', 'crap', 'suit', 'oh', 'yes', 'perfect', 'example', 'laziness', 'final', 'battle', 'definitely', 'better', 'anticlimactic', 'one', 'previous', 'film', 'only', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'Less', 'action', 'time', 'more', 'emphasis', 'Stark', 'struggles', 'not', 'interesting', 'considering', 'plot', 'holed', 'story', 'Nick', 'Fury', ""n't"", 'indicated', 'SHIELD', 'screen', 'least', 'ten', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'people', 'dark', 'who', 'hell', 'bogus', 'comedy', 'as', 'immature', 'racist', 'robots', 'Transformers', '2', 'decent', 'comparison', 'be', 'quite', 'frank', 'Stay', 'far', 'away', 'Marvel', 'fiascolet', 'take', 'everything', 'was', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'do', 'bigger', 'forget', 'character', 'development', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Tony', 'message', 'father', 'were', 'greatest', 'creation', 'right', 'was', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'screenplay', 'i', 'could', 'find', 'i', 'felt', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'film', 'just', 'spider', 'man', '3.', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'anymore', 'complaining', 'spiderman', '3', 'movie', 'same', 'exact', 'problems', 'one', 'film', 'blast', 'do', 'spider', 'man', '3', 'problem', 'i', 'had', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'lamest', 'locations', 'Tony', 'luxury', 'apartment', 'night', 'club', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'iron', 'man', 'face', 'war', 'machine', 'night', 'club', 'looking', 'luxury', 'apartment', 'lame', 'locations', 'planet', 'pick', 'luxury', 'apartment', 'also', 'not', 'enough', 'mickey', 'rourke', 'i', 'hated', 'whole', 'Hammer', 'scheme', 'thing', 'i', 'felt', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'Fox', 'news', 'yuck', 'also', 'why', 'black', 'widow', 'purpose', 'other', 'have', 'fans', 'say', 'hey', 'black', 'widow', 'role', 'was', 'empty', 'hollow', 'also', 'what', 'director', 'giving', 'own', 'action', 'scene', 'stay', 'camera', 'fatty', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'see', 'white', 'man', 'tux', 'fight', 'i', 'paid', 'see', 'iron', 'man', 'also', 'way', 'Tony', 'court', 'investigators', 'was', 'sooooo', 'far', 'fetched', 'was', ""c'mon"", 'nobody', 'can', 'talk', 'official', 'also', 'how', 'convenient', 'was', 'tony', 'wirelessly', 'send', 'satellite', 'projections', 'screen', 'investigation', 'was', 'like', ""c'mon"", 'least', 'try', 'be', 'creative', 'presenting', 'information', 'i', 'hate', 'when', 'characters', 'magically', 'do', 'computer', 'hacks', 'when', 'reality', 'far', 'more', 'complicated', 'also', 'way', 'Don', 'took', 'Tony', 'suit', 'was', 'soooo', 'lame', 'almost', 'how', 'kid', 'brother', 'closet', 'when', 'not', 'looking', 'take', 'clothes', 'so', 'Tony', 'high', 'tech', 'stuff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'lock', 'war', 'machine', 'suit', 'Don', 'Tony', 'give', 'up', 'suit', 'Tony', 'No', 'don', 'then', 'Tony', 'closet', 'steals', 'was', 'polo', 'shirt', 'DEFINITLY', 'WAS', 'NOT', 'HOW', 'MY', 'DREAM', 'BATTLE', 'BETWEEN', 'TONY', 'AND', 'WAR', 'MACHINE', 'WAS', 'SUPPOSE', 'TO', 'BE', 'was', 'something', 'also', 'how', 'Tony', 'was', 'carrying', 'film', 'road', 'redemption', 'first', 'film', 'never', 'happened', 'just', 'went', 'right', 'back', 'being', 'narcissitic', 'capitalistic', 'pig', 'point', 'blank', 'movie', 'sucked', 'only', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'cinematography', 'poor', 'writing', 'poor', 'set', 'locations', 'poor', 'directing', 'worst', 'final', 'showdown', 'time', 'bad', 'guy', 'beaten', 'tag', 'teaming', 'fart', 'plew', 'mickeys', 'dead']",N/A

I feel that a successful person at that level would have been more mature and responsible.The final battle scene is at night ... again a bit of a let down.In order to set the stage for the next sequel, there are scenes with Samuel Jackson, who is the head of some sort of Justice League group and alludes to his troubles in the south-west.

As with so many of these Marvel Comics scripts there are so many add-on characters to disrupt the meager storyline that it seems like the studio tapped everyone who walked by the filming, gave them a few lines and a wow costume and said 'come one in.' Rating an obvious millions of dollars production such as this is duplicitous: CGI 5, acting 3, story 1.  But if noise, mayhem, and electrical fires are pleasing to you, then by all means jump aboard this colorful film.Robert Downey, Jr. is a fine actor so he puts as much as he can into the lines allotted him to read.  Mickey Rourke is the bad guy with even more tattoos and longer hair than the Wrestler, and with a Russian accent to boot.  Don Cheadle plays Don Cheadle, and Sam Rockwell needs a shave as a supposed wily bad guy executive. Samuel L. Jackson attempts to lend some dignity.  Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be asking why she bothered until Scarlett Johansson jumps on board to give the film some much need punch.  It's good guy versus bad guy - with drones create by Rourke's disenchanted character that attempt unsuccessfully to turn the tide.  What's missing is some of Robert Downey, Jr.'s comedic banter and the brakes put on the destruction of the Stark Expo concept.  Definitely a film for those who like this sort of high volume comic book outing.

1248031,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B0021L8V1G,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[5, 8]","Had the good fortune to see this while in Asia. Ha ha!I was worried because the first review I read panned it for many issues, foremost of which was having too many disparate plot threads and a low-stakes tussle (over who wins an arms deal). I'm happy to say this is not the case at all.IM2 picks up where 1 left off. Tony Stark is a one-man peacekeeping (and peacemaking) machine, but he's gradually being poisoned by the palladium in his power source. This is turning him to drink and general recklessness, which puts his friends and others at risk, in a few exciting set pieces throughout, one of which is an amazing attack during an F1 race.Meanwhile, Mickey Rourke plays Vanko, the son of his father's ex-partner who is hatching plans for what he considers revenge, having access to similar technical knowledge. I will not divulge further details, so you can guess at what is true and what is not.Sam Rockwell is a rival arms manufacturer, Hammer, who tries to use Vanko to further his arms race against Stark. As usual, the exchanges between him and Vanko are the most boring and predictable of the movie, because we all know what bad guys are going to say, well ahead of time, because, well, they're bad. (As one writer has put it, it is the saints (in this case, Tony and friends) who are the real characters; they're more believable and unpredictable because of their internal struggles.) But they do their best with the material they're given. He does his dancing cameo here, never fear.So, as the negative review I first read says, the stakes seem to be really low - it's about who wins the arms deal. But it really isn't, and I think you'll see that. The deal is only the surface of a greater threat.Another thread is Tony's interest in Johannson's character versus Paltrow's. But this is also part of the overall scheme of things, not a throwaway. I didn't see at first how Tony could get sidetracked from Pepper, but I guess it's part of his deterioration, and of course makes for some romantic tension. As seen in the previews, Johannson will get into some matrix-like action, interspersed with some other (fighting) action involving Tony's driver to humorous effect.Yet another thread is resolving Tony's relationship with his father. Was his father, whom he felt always held him at arm's length, a cheat, or something worse? Did his father hold the key to Tony's salvation? A little far-fetched, but this is a comic, right?Don Cheadle is the foil to Tony's self-destructive downslide, and their friendship is strained by competing interests besides, one of whom is Gary Shandling's oily, bloated politician who is insisting that Stark turns over the suit to the US - actually an interesting point, since the question is, do we want to put all our eggs in Tony's basket? Shandling is cast as the ""bad"" guy of sorts, but it's a grey area and he gets a surprising dig in the end.The effects are well done. There is mundo action and destruction, also touched with humor in the midst of terrifying threats. I felt some aspects of the pre-final battle were a little too easy, but it makes sense in terms of the major players (Hammer vs. Stark) and their companies as ""characters"", which is built up throughout the movie.We have hints of the Avenger initiative, but not much - stay for the after-credits teaser, thin though it is.Everything comes together and every part makes for a great time at the movies.",4,Nowhere as bad as some critics say,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,3418,"['Had', 'good', 'fortune', 'see', 'while', 'Asia', 'Ha', 'ha', 'was', 'worried', 'first', 'review', 'read', 'panned', 'many', 'issues', 'foremost', 'was', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'disparate', 'plot', 'threads', 'low-stakes', 'tussle', 'who', 'arms', 'deal', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'not', 'case', 'all.IM2', 'up', 'where', '1', 'left', 'off', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'one-man', 'peacekeeping', 'peacemaking', 'machine', 'gradually', 'being', 'poisoned', 'palladium', 'power', 'source', 'turning', 'drink', 'general', 'recklessness', 'friends', 'others', 'risk', 'few', 'exciting', 'set', 'pieces', 'one', 'amazing', 'attack', 'F1', 'race.Meanwhile', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Vanko', 'son', 'father', 'ex-partner', 'who', 'hatching', 'plans', 'what', 'revenge', 'having', 'access', 'similar', 'technical', 'knowledge', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'further', 'details', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'true', 'what', 'not.Sam', 'Rockwell', 'rival', 'arms', 'manufacturer', 'Hammer', 'who', 'use', 'Vanko', 'further', 'arms', 'race', 'Stark', 'usual', 'exchanges', 'Vanko', 'are', 'most', 'boring', 'predictable', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'going', 'say', 'well', 'ahead', 'time', 'well', ""'re"", 'bad', 'one', 'writer', 'put', 'saints', 'case', 'Tony', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'characters', ""'re"", 'more', 'believable', 'unpredictable', 'internal', 'struggles', 'do', 'best', 'material', ""'re"", 'given', 'dancing', 'cameo', 'here', 'never', 'fear.So', 'negative', 'review', 'first', 'read', 'stakes', 'seem', 'be', 'really', 'low', 'who', 'arms', 'deal', 'really', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'deal', 'only', 'surface', 'greater', 'threat.Another', 'thread', 'Tony', 'interest', 'Johannson', 'character', 'versus', 'Paltrow', 'also', 'part', 'overall', 'scheme', 'things', 'not', 'throwaway', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'first', 'how', 'Tony', 'could', 'get', 'sidetracked', 'Pepper', 'guess', 'part', 'deterioration', 'course', 'romantic', 'tension', 'seen', 'previews', 'Johannson', 'will', 'get', 'matrix-like', 'action', 'interspersed', 'other', 'fighting', 'action', 'involving', 'Tony', 'driver', 'humorous', 'effect.Yet', 'thread', 'resolving', 'Tony', 'relationship', 'father', 'Was', 'father', 'whom', 'felt', 'always', 'held', 'arm', 'length', 'cheat', 'something', 'worse', 'Did', 'father', 'hold', 'key', 'Tony', 'salvation', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'comic', 'right', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'foil', 'Tony', 'self-destructive', 'downslide', 'friendship', 'strained', 'competing', 'interests', 'one', 'whom', 'Gary', 'Shandling', 'oily', 'bloated', 'politician', 'who', 'insisting', 'Stark', 'suit', 'US', 'actually', 'interesting', 'point', 'question', 'do', 'want', 'put', 'eggs', 'Tony', 'basket', 'Shandling', 'cast', 'bad', 'guy', 'sorts', 'grey', 'area', 'surprising', 'dig', 'end.The', 'effects', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'mundo', 'action', 'destruction', 'also', 'touched', 'humor', 'midst', 'terrifying', 'threats', 'felt', 'aspects', 'pre-final', 'battle', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'sense', 'terms', 'major', 'players', 'Hammer', 'Stark', 'companies', 'characters', 'built', 'up', 'movie.We', 'have', 'hints', 'Avenger', 'initiative', 'not', 'much', 'stay', 'after-credits', 'teaser', 'thin', 'is.Everything', 'together', 'part', 'great', 'time', 'movies']",N/A

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[8, 9]","There's nothing like that first kiss, yeah, and so even though IRON MAN 2 comes out and unleashes its share of awesomeness, even though it is very much worth a look, the mystery is gone, the expectations met, we've, er, already copped that feel. IRON MAN 2, good as it is, doesn't drop on us like lightning in a bottle, and so it isn't quite as exhilarating. What it does give us is more of that good Robert Downey, Jr.The guy has made the Invincible Iron Man into his own, and I can't see anyone else now as Tony Stark, and I'm betting you can't, either. Downey brings the same devilish, bigger-than-life charisma, that same brash ""I'm Tony Stark! Who the eff are you?!"" swagger. Tony Stark is brilliant and ego-centric, but he's got good intentions. His heart's in the right place, and so we forgive the rampant narcissism. Plus, he's a fun dude to be around.IRON MAN 2 chronicles Tony's fall from grace and his redemption. Six months ago Tony Stark told the world that he was Iron Man. But has fame and success gone to his head? He's been more eccentric lately, indulging even more in hedonism lately, and he's conducting the Stark Expo like it's a rock concert (which is actually bloody cool). Certain parties are worried. Iron Man's arrival had gone a ways into ensuring global peace or at least global detente. But six months later, the American government - as embodied in the person of the slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) - is itching to get its paws on the Iron Man tech and, so, Tony has to attend senate hearings. Stark, in his own inimitable manner, blows the hearings out of the water.There's a fatal flaw in the schematics, a gremlin in the wires. Carefree on the outside, on the inside Tony is very concerned. The palladium element in the arc reactor in his chest is gradually poisoning him, and each use of the Iron Man armor accelerates the condition. But he keeps up the pretense, having informed no one of his impending death. Maybe you can't blame the guy for carrying on so.I actually expected this movie to delve into Tony's alcoholism (from the classic story arc in the comics), but we only get a peek at the man's fondness for booze. We do get moments when we see the flamboyant playboy take a sippy, as well as one epic drunken binge at a party (while in armor, no less). This public eff-up sends Tony's credibility plummeting, and that slimy senator's smirk just got even smirkier.Rival industrialist Justin Hammer isn't the Big Bad of the movie, but Sam Rockwell supplies him with a pronounced air of unctuousness, and you hate him. Hammer, fed up with languishing in Stark's shadow, hires a crazed and tattooed Russian physicist to craft his own arsenal of armored suits, and a Russian physicist played by the menacing Mickey Rourke probably would have no choice but to be crazed and tattooed. They don't call Rourke's character by his supervillain code name, but it's Whiplash (with a smidge of Crimson Dynamo thrown in). He nurses a serious grudge against Tony and Tony's father, Howard Stark, who had a falling out with Whiplash's own inventor father. But how does Rourke get away with chewing a toothpick all the time?IRON MAN 2 isn't magic like the first movie and that initial sense of novelty has worn off, but it's still terrific and the scale is bigger. Downey's presence drives the thing, and the fact that we don't mind that Tony Stark is onscreen more than Iron Man says something about the skills set Downey brings to the party. We still get that good banter between him and Gwyneth Paltrow. Don Cheadle takes over from Terrence Howard, and it's like he's always been on board as Rhodey. The f/x is flawless state of the art stuff; there's nothing like heavy metal clashing resoundingly. If you've at all seen the posters and the trailer, then you already know War Machine would make his debut, and he may not be as impressive as the ol' shellhead but, damn, he's got all those big mounted guns. And, for dessert, curvy Scarlett Johansson steps into the franchise as the smoking hot Black Widow and she demonstrates high levels of kickassery. And oh that sexy black leather....I only wish Pepper Potts were given more stuff to do.Jon Favreau features himself more as Happy Hogan, a chauffer in this incarnation, and I'm not mad at Favreau. What's the point of being director if you can't call your own number once in a while? Meanwhile, IRON MAN 2, in a scene here and there, gets us another step closer to that Avengers movie.

I had just as much enjoyment of the movie only LISTENING to it, as he did while WATCHING it.To be honest I did watch some of it. When I needed to refill my wine I walked through the living room and looked at the current scene that was playing. So I probably saw about 20 minutes of the movie - I like my wine.The effects were very high quality as one would expect - the lighting sabres of the Mickey Rourke character flashed on the screen and gave me a ""charge"". The briefcase suit was a clever gimmick - but it worked and I felt like I was watching a scene from the new Transformers movie (let's hope they get it right next time).RDJr. is excellent as always. Plot, meh. It's been redone so many times - there was really nothing fresh about the PLOT itself. Bad guy. Revenge. Daddy. Arrogant military. Congressional oversight. Odd cameo from Gary Shandling. Seriously?The other problem is that half the movie was boring, and half the movie was ""OH MY GOD!!!"" It was a roller coaster, but not in a good way. Pacing fell flat in the middle of the movie - then someone realized it and threw some action in to get the viewer's attention back.It was, however, entertaining to see ""Guy Flegman"" as the bad-guy enabler. I miss him from Galaxy Quest. But - since that was the last big thing I remember him from, I didn't take his character seriously at ALL.

If you enjoy Robert Downey's acting, or action packed Marvel superhero summer blockbusters, you will enjoy this.Is it better than the original? First, how many sequels are? I enjoyed the original better, but in this case some like this one better. My opinion? I'm not sure if this is as much a sequel to the first Iron Man as it is a set-up for the Avengers, considering the importance of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) and Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) in the plot, not to mention the mention of The Avengers Initiative towards the end.Some people like me are familiar with the Iron Man character from the comic books (in my case, in the mid-seventies). There are differences between the Iron Man I grew up and the one here, such as the appearance and origin of this episode's villain, Whiplash, the skin color of Nick Fury, or that in the old days Tony Stark kept his identity secret except for his inner circle (""Happy"" Hogan, though not Pepper Potts, and including Don Blake/Thor). But if you're not a purist, is this pure escapist fun?Maybe not pure -- it has Tony Stark dealing with some inner demons -- but for the most part, yes.If I had a choice between which to see again between this, the first Iron Man, and the Avengers, this would be an uncontested third place.

The dialogues are that funny and extremely well executed by 4 of the best actors today. The four main actors (Downey, Paltrow, Rourke, and Rockwell) are all amazing actors and the acting level of this film itself makes this film worth watching.I am not sure if I have heard of better banter between two members of opposite sex since Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant made the now legendary ""Bringing up Baby"" (1938).The brilliance of Robert Downey Jr is that he makes Tony Stark, without his special suit, more interesting than the Ironman. He has real flaws and tries his best to cope with life's challenges and is not always successful. He also has definite weaknesses and is forced to rely on his friends. Make no mistake, Tony Stark is not universally admired nor even liked. His relationship with the Avengers are definite love/hate as his relationship with his Pepper Potts.His relationship with Natalie Rushman (Black Widow) played by Scarlett Johansson, is probably funniest as he tries to deal with many facets of her chameleon qualities.  ""How do you do it?"", questions the astounded Tony Stark, ""You're a triple impostor! I've never seen anything like it! Is there anything real about you?"".The action sequences are also great.

So I know they have 30 years of story to draw from and MOST of the Marvel serise has better, faster, more intigeing storylines. I didn't see the movie in the theater so when I saw the Blu-Ray on sale for $13.I thought it was a great bargain.  Not so much.The story really moves pretty slow, and the action scenes are few but pretty good.The opening scene (2nd actaull scene) at the Stark Expo (think World Fair) is Tony Stark at his narsasitic high or low depending upon how you want to interpret it. But it is just one example of how they slow the movie down and make it drag along, it takes way too much time.  There were definetly NO Acadamy Awards given for editing or scripts in Iron Man 2.The action starts about 35 to 40 minutes into the movie and its too late to resesetate the toxic script. At this point you finally get to see Ivan Vanko bring on the pain in the Monaco Grand Prix, slicing cars in half with his own Russian version of the ARC reactor and the PLASMA whips he uses to slice throug iorn. It is visually stunning for a few minutes but hardly worth the 30 to 45 minute wait.They spend some time setting up the the stroy arc for S.H.I.E.L.D. and H.A.M.M.E.R as combatent government contractors and this means they have to write Nick Furry into the script, which seems kind of forced and clumsy.  The only elegant part of this is the introduction of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who steals the show in the final 20 minutes with the best action scene of the movie. (There is something hypnotizing about watching an attractive redhead rotating through Judiso space while kicking butt. Oh yeah, did I mention she is in skin tight black leather?)The final 20 minutes of this Blu-Ray along with the extra features like the S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault and some of the tech details make it worth keeping.Do I think Super Hero movies need to be ""elegant""? Yes, the writers have very little excuse when they have 30 years of storyline and material to draw on. The first Iron Man was far superior to Iron Man 2 and it was a bit clunky at times.The best part of both of the Iron Man movies is Robert Downey Jr. He seems to be custom made or trained to be Tony Stark.

1248062,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0021L8V1G,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 4]","Taking place six months after the first Iron Man, Iron Man 2 finds a world where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has successfully ""privatized world peace,"" but fearing other countries getting their hands on Stark's Iron Man technology the Senate seeks to have Tony hand over the technology to the government. Also seeking to steal Stark's technology is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to regain a weapons contract with the military. Complicating things further, a mysterious Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) turns up to destroy Tony Stark.Iron Man was a huge surprise when it came out in the early summer of 2008. A 2nd tier Marvel comic book, Iron Man became one of the top grossing movies of 2008, and even held it's own very well against the juggernaut that was The Dark Knight despite it's much smaller fanbase. It also resurrected Robert Downey Jr.'s career, showing that he was capable of leading a franchise despite his past mistakes, and showed that Jon Favreau was a viable action director. Since then Downey has found himself nominated for two Golden Globes winning one of them, and added yet another big action franchise to the current notch in his belt. Of course, all eyes are on Iron Man 2 to see if the movie will top it's predecessor in the expectations department, so how does it hold up.In my opinion, Iron Man 2 equals it's predecessor. The second installment of Iron Man is funnier than the original, and it ups the ante on the action from the first movie as well. What really makes the movie though, is not the action, but the characterizations. Fleshing out Stark's narcissism as well as his inabilities to deal with his emotions opens new doors into the character. Favreau and new writer to the series Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunderdo a great job of handling a large cast that would normally sink most other comic book franchises.The casting in this movie is superb even if it seems jarring to see so many actors and actresses playing characters that aren't typical for them. Apart from The Spirit and The Island, Scarlett Johansson hasn't played an outright action fueled character, but she equips herself admirably to play the part of a believable martial arts trained heroine. Don Cheadle does a great job taking over the role of Rhodey from Terrence Howard, and even tops his predecessor. Sam Rockwell does a superb job as Stark's rival, and a man who tries his hardest to be as iconic as Tony Stark, but fails miserably on all counts. Mickey Rourke steals nearly every scene he's in, though, as Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. I was never sure if I would be able to buy him as a Russian, but the work he put into researching for the character definitely paid off.On the downside though, sometimes it feels as though there's too much of a rush to get from one point to the next. Scenes feel as though they move to the next before they're truly done playing out. Unfortunately, this is one of the issues of having such a large cast that needs to have proper screen time to flesh out the characters. To add to that, the second half of the film is a bit derivative of other action films. While the film may do a great job of going in a different direction than other comic book films by outing it's central character and performing a character study on a man who thrives on his popularity in that position, but in the last act of the movie it falls into the same trap as other action movies with an ending that can be clich&eacute;.All in all, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies based on comic books and if you like the first Iron Man. Franchises like Iron Man, the current Batman series, and Kick-Ass set a new benchmark for comic book movies and action movies in general. With great action, acting, characterization, and originality these movies have moved beyond their genres to capture something that extends beyond it's core audience.4.5/5",4,Iron Man 2,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,3916,"['Taking', 'place', 'six', 'months', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'world', 'where', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'successfully', 'privatized', 'world', 'peace', 'fearing', 'other', 'countries', 'getting', 'hands', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'technology', 'Senate', 'seeks', 'have', 'Tony', 'hand', 'technology', 'government', 'Also', 'seeking', 'steal', 'Stark', 'technology', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'who', 'regain', 'weapons', 'contract', 'military', 'Complicating', 'things', 'further', 'mysterious', 'Russian', 'physicist', 'named', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'up', 'destroy', 'Tony', 'Stark.Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'huge', 'surprise', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'early', 'summer', '2008', '2nd', 'tier', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'Iron', 'Man', 'became', 'one', 'top', 'grossing', 'movies', '2008', 'even', 'held', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'juggernaut', 'was', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'much', 'smaller', 'fanbase', 'also', 'resurrected', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'career', 'showing', 'was', 'capable', 'leading', 'franchise', 'past', 'mistakes', 'showed', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'was', 'viable', 'action', 'director', 'then', 'Downey', 'found', 'nominated', 'two', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'winning', 'one', 'added', 'yet', 'big', 'action', 'franchise', 'current', 'notch', 'belt', 'course', 'eyes', 'are', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'top', 'predecessor', 'expectations', 'department', 'how', 'hold', 'up.In', 'opinion', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'predecessor', 'second', 'installment', 'Iron', 'Man', 'funnier', 'original', 'ante', 'action', 'first', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'not', 'action', 'characterizations', 'Fleshing', 'out', 'Stark', 'narcissism', 'as', 'well', 'inabilities', 'deal', 'emotions', 'new', 'doors', 'character', 'Favreau', 'new', 'writer', 'series', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'Tropic', 'Thunderdo', 'great', 'job', 'handling', 'large', 'cast', 'would', 'normally', 'sink', 'most', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'franchises.The', 'casting', 'movie', 'superb', 'even', 'jarring', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'playing', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Apart', 'Spirit', 'Island', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', ""n't"", 'played', 'outright', 'action', 'fueled', 'character', 'admirably', 'play', 'part', 'believable', 'martial', 'arts', 'trained', 'heroine', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'over', 'role', 'Rhodey', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'even', 'tops', 'predecessor', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'superb', 'job', 'Stark', 'rival', 'man', 'who', 'hardest', 'be', 'as', 'iconic', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'miserably', 'counts', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'steals', 'nearly', 'scene', 'though', 'Russian', 'physicist', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'was', 'never', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'Russian', 'work', 'put', 'researching', 'character', 'definitely', 'paid', 'downside', 'too', 'much', 'rush', 'get', 'one', 'point', 'next', 'Scenes', 'feel', 'move', 'next', ""'re"", 'truly', 'done', 'playing', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'issues', 'having', 'large', 'cast', 'have', 'proper', 'screen', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'add', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'bit', 'derivative', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'film', 'may', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'going', 'different', 'direction', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'outing', 'central', 'character', 'performing', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'who', 'popularity', 'position', 'last', 'act', 'movie', 'same', 'trap', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'especially', 'like', 'movies', 'based', 'comic', 'books', 'like', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Franchises', 'Iron', 'Man', 'current', 'Batman', 'series', 'Kick-Ass', 'set', 'new', 'benchmark', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'action', 'movies', 'general', 'great', 'action', 'acting', 'characterization', 'originality', 'movies', 'have', 'moved', 'genres', 'capture', 'something', 'core', 'audience.4.5/5']",N/A
1248063,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0021L8V1G,Jason,"[7, 11]","When I was a young boy I played with all sorts of action figures, GI Joes and Transformers the most.  Later as a young teen I got my first job at a comic book store.  What I often thought of was a collaboration of my favorites.  As Hollywood has slowly embraced a genre specifically steered towards the Comic-Con crowd I have looked on with great interest.  Having loved the original Iron Man, I can say unequivocally that Iron Man 2 is awesome in every way.The sequel deals quite a bit with the palladium and arc reactor technology behind Iron Man, and how that technology adversely affects Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.).  As the U.S. government, via LTC James Rhodes (Cheadle) demands access to the design, use, and replication of Iron Man's scientific advancements - something Stark refuses - the man behind the mask must face not only his government and his mortality, but also a competing industrialist, the nefarious Justin Hammer (Rockwell), and the Russian villain Ivan ""Whiplash"" Vanko (Rourke), who has reverse engineered Iron Man's arc reactor technology (adding weapons along the way) to satisfy a family vendetta.  On top of all that Stark still has to be the hard-partying, scotch-pounding womanizer who must placate Pepper Potts (Paltrow) on a daily basis, ogle new assistant Natasha Romanoff (Johansson), and contemplate an affiliation with SHIELD - a top secret government organization led by front-man Nick Fury (Jackson).Some may say this movie fails because it lacks action.  And by ""lacks action"" most people mean ""isn't Transformers 2.""  In my opinion, the more detailed storyline uncovering Stark's personal, psychological, and physical dilemmas is the essence of the flawed superhero, and avoiding the zeitgeist makes is superior to the bam, pow FX-heavy of Transformers 2, et al.  But when Iron Man 2 DID ratchet up the action - initially with a battle between Iron Man and Rhodes, but later in an epic Iron Man robot battle royal - it was edge the seat, floor rumbling, front row of the rollercoaster exciting.It should go without saying, but the incredible cast performs just as one would expect.  Downey, Jr. is the boisterous, swaggering Tony Stark personified, and Paltrow, whose smug attitude I typically loathe, is nearly perfect as Potts.  Rockwell and Jackson turn in inspired, albeit secondary efforts.  Johannson is minimally used, but serves her Matrix-esque purpose in a skin-tight outfit and awesome fight scene.  The scene stealer, however, is clearly Mickey Rourke.  The demented, evil look, the spot-on accent, the eccentricity is electric (pun intended).Great movie, succeeds where others have failed, builds upon the story perfectly, provides something for all audiences, and for me, it put the GI Joe into a Transformer costume.",5,Boyhood fantasies and comic book fans' wishes fulfilled,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,2768,"['When', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'played', 'sorts', 'action', 'figures', 'GI', 'Joes', 'Transformers', 'most', 'Later', 'young', 'teen', 'got', 'first', 'job', 'comic', 'book', 'store', 'What', 'often', 'thought', 'was', 'collaboration', 'favorites', 'Hollywood', 'slowly', 'embraced', 'genre', 'specifically', 'steered', 'Comic-Con', 'crowd', 'have', 'looked', 'great', 'interest', 'Having', 'loved', 'original', 'Iron', 'Man', 'can', 'say', 'unequivocally', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'awesome', 'way.The', 'sequel', 'deals', 'quite', 'bit', 'palladium', 'arc', 'reactor', 'technology', 'Iron', 'Man', 'how', 'technology', 'adversely', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'U.S.', 'government', 'LTC', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'Cheadle', 'access', 'design', 'use', 'replication', 'Iron', 'Man', 'scientific', 'advancements', 'something', 'Stark', 'man', 'mask', 'must', 'face', 'not', 'only', 'government', 'mortality', 'also', 'competing', 'industrialist', 'nefarious', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'Rockwell', 'Russian', 'villain', 'Ivan', 'Whiplash', 'Vanko', 'Rourke', 'who', 'reverse', 'engineered', 'Iron', 'Man', 'arc', 'reactor', 'technology', 'adding', 'weapons', 'way', 'satisfy', 'family', 'vendetta', 'top', 'Stark', 'still', 'be', 'hard-partying', 'scotch-pounding', 'womanizer', 'who', 'must', 'placate', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Paltrow', 'daily', 'basis', 'ogle', 'new', 'assistant', 'Natasha', 'Romanoff', 'Johansson', 'contemplate', 'affiliation', 'SHIELD', 'top', 'secret', 'government', 'organization', 'led', 'front-man', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Jackson', '.Some', 'may', 'say', 'movie', 'action', 'lacks', 'action', 'most', 'people', 'mean', ""n't"", 'Transformers', '2', 'opinion', 'more', 'detailed', 'storyline', 'uncovering', 'Stark', 'personal', 'psychological', 'physical', 'dilemmas', 'essence', 'flawed', 'superhero', 'avoiding', 'zeitgeist', 'superior', 'bam', 'pow', 'FX-heavy', 'Transformers', '2', 'et', 'al', 'when', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'DID', 'ratchet', 'up', 'action', 'initially', 'battle', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Rhodes', 'later', 'epic', 'Iron', 'Man', 'battle', 'royal', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'floor', 'rumbling', 'front', 'row', 'rollercoaster', 'exciting.It', 'should', 'go', 'saying', 'incredible', 'cast', 'performs', 'just', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'boisterous', 'swaggering', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'personified', 'Paltrow', 'smug', 'attitude', 'typically', 'loathe', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'Potts', 'Rockwell', 'Jackson', 'turn', 'inspired', 'secondary', 'efforts', 'Johannson', 'minimally', 'used', 'Matrix-esque', 'purpose', 'skin-tight', 'outfit', 'awesome', 'fight', 'scene', 'scene', 'stealer', 'however', 'clearly', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'demented', 'evil', 'look', 'spot-on', 'accent', 'eccentricity', 'electric', 'pun', 'intended', '.Great', 'movie', 'where', 'others', 'have', 'failed', 'story', 'perfectly', 'something', 'audiences', 'put', 'GI', 'Joe', 'Transformer', 'costume']",N/A

While a rich weapons manufacturer (Sam Rockwell) wants to use Rourke to build him Iron Man suits since Stark won't give his up to the government. While Stark has to find a new energy source that can keep him alive and isn't too confident that he can. But Stark's military friend (Don Cheadle) is more than ready to step in his shoes with the War Machine outfit.The movie is as slow as the first to pick up and give us some action. The first is a little better though since it doesn't take as long to give us some action. Plus some viewers might find the end fight to be too short and not even as good as the end fight of the first film. Still, I wouldn't call Iron Man 2 a disappointment, the movie is far better than a lot of the summer movies that came out last summer, like Transformers 2. Transformers 2 had a lot more action, but it was too loud and un-involving.When I watching the first Iron Man yesterday, I realized that Stark should have at least looked more in pain and weak after the operation that removed half his chest. I mean his body took too it too well I thought. So what I really liked about Iron Man 2 is that his body is starting to have a negative reaction to what saved his life in the first film.

I gave it so many chances and it never got better.  I would have given it less than one star, but I'll give it one purely for Mickey Rourke's performance.  Sadly, not even Mickey could save this piece of cinematic junk.  Yes, there are cool special effects but there aren't enough special effects in the world to make up for Iron Man 2's total lack of story and plot.  Downey's performance as the arrogant genius is so over the top it's boring and the chemistry between he and Paltrow is non-existent.  In fact she doesn't seem to have much of a reason to be in this film at all. She's like a potted plant in the background of each scene she's in.  In order to make up for the poor script and mediocre acting, the film is packed full of so many baffling characters that we don't get a chance to understand them or care about any of them...Including the main character, Tony Stark.

I just had a few problems with elements in it. Mainly with some characters and story. So before you read on there will be a few spoilers, I might give away so don't say I didn't warn you.First Iron Man 2 takes place not long after the first movie. Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr) is dealing with the repercussions of telling the world he's Iron Man. Mainly from the United States government and rival companies like Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell). Of course this gets the attention of Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke) who blames the Stark family for stealing his fathers invention and destroying his family. Things go down hill from there for Tony Stark. That's it for the plot except Iron Man 2 is a much darker film from the first movie. The story is pretty good except they try to do to much in just 2hrs. That's really my biggest complaint with the movie. I'll explain more in the next paragraph.Ok the problem I had with the movie was like I said they tried to add to much in just to 2 hrs. The biggest problem is was the force feeding of S.H.E.L.D. and the Avengers down our throats. Don't get me wrong I look forward to the Avengers movie, but what is the title of the movie...yes it's Iron Man 2 not a Avengers prequel. I didn't mind Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) so much simply because I just love Jackson, he brings life to every role he plays. The character I had the biggest problem with was The Black Widow or Natasha Romanoff(Scarlett Johansson).  What a pointless character, sure I know Johansson is hot, but what was her point in the movie.  She added nothing to the movie. Oh I know to force feed us the Avengers, and from the rumors I read a Black Widow movie some time down the road. Now I didn't mind all the Avenger references. There's one evolving Captain America which I thought was great and funny.For me what stole the movie was the acting by the main actors and some of the supporting ones. Especially Robert Downey Jr(who again steals the show), Gwyneth Paltrow(Pepper Potts) and Mickey Rourke. The acting and chemistry between Downey Jr. and Paltrow was great.  Then there's Rourke who is reviving his film career one film at a time. He was great as Whiplash, one of the best bad guys in superhero films out side of the Joker from The Dark Knight of course. Some of the supporting cast did a good job as well from Sam Rockwell, Don Cheadle(James Rhodes), to Jon Favreau(Hogan).Overall Iron Man 2 suffers from what many super hero sequels suffer from. It tries to do to much and add to much. That being said it's still a really good if not great film with a pretty good story, great acting and actors, and really good effects/visuals. So this movie is definitely worth checking out, and I'll see it again.",5,To much isn't always a good thing.,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,2835,"['know', 'above', 'comment', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', ""n't"", 'true', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'elements', 'Mainly', 'characters', 'story', 'read', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'spoilers', 'might', 'give', 'away', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'you.First', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'place', 'not', 'long', 'first', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'dealing', 'repercussions', 'telling', 'world', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Mainly', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'rival', 'companies', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'course', 'attention', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'Stark', 'family', 'stealing', 'fathers', 'invention', 'destroying', 'family', 'Things', 'go', 'down', 'hill', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'plot', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'much', 'darker', 'film', 'first', 'movie', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'try', 'do', 'much', 'just', '2hrs', 'really', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'more', 'next', 'paragraph.Ok', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'said', 'tried', 'add', 'much', 'just', '2', 'hrs', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'force', 'feeding', 'S.H.E.L.D', 'Avengers', 'down', 'throats', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'look', 'forward', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'what', 'title', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'not', 'Avengers', 'prequel', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'so', 'much', 'simply', 'just', 'love', 'Jackson', 'life', 'role', 'character', 'had', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Natasha', 'Romanoff', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'What', 'pointless', 'character', 'sure', 'know', 'Johansson', 'hot', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'movie', 'added', 'nothing', 'movie', 'Oh', 'know', 'force', 'feed', 'Avengers', 'rumors', 'read', 'Black', 'Widow', 'movie', 'time', 'down', 'road', 'Now', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Avenger', 'references', 'one', 'evolving', 'Captain', 'America', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'funny.For', 'stole', 'movie', 'was', 'acting', 'main', 'actors', 'supporting', 'ones', 'Especially', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'who', 'again', 'show', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Paltrow', 'was', 'great', 'Then', 'Rourke', 'who', 'reviving', 'film', 'career', 'one', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'great', 'Whiplash', 'one', 'best', 'bad', 'guys', 'superhero', 'films', 'out', 'side', 'Joker', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'course', 'supporting', 'cast', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Hogan', '.Overall', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'suffers', 'what', 'many', 'super', 'hero', 'sequels', 'suffer', 'do', 'much', 'add', 'much', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'actors', 'really', 'good', 'effects/visuals', 'So', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', ""'ll"", 'see', 'again']",N/A

I hate it when you read a review and some idiot starts out by reviewing the damn box the movie came in. I guess if I dropped a turd in a cute little box and sealed it up good that's enough for a 5 star review. Give me a break!I really enjoyed the original Iron Man more the 2nd time around. I started the sequel but never finished it. I recently came back to it with a fresher perspective and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, the sequel pits Iron Man against 3 foes: a vengeful Russian named Ivan (Mickey Rourke), a rival battle-suit maker played by Sam Rockwell, and finally himself as the hardware in the middle of his chest supporting his body is going bad. The story was decent enough for the world that this film takes place in. The action scenes and special effects were well done. If I had a choice between Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard I'd take Howard only because I believe that his charisma matches up with Downey's.This film was definitely not as good as the first film in the story department but the action was as good if not better.

And this attitude contributes to the likelihood of a great first movie - like Iron Man. But once they have earned our favor, there's some pressure to live up to the original, but not much else. This is why sequels are so tricky.The mature acting skills of Robert Downy, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow liven up an otherwise gaudy script which follows too many characters and complex plotlines. Samuel Jackson is great with power and rage roles - but he doesn't fit heroic or calm types, and his chemistry with Downy is almost nil. Don Cheadle is usually amazing (Traitor, Traffic), but in this movie his acting is stilted. Johannsen has about 10 lines, lots of hot body shots (no problem with THAT), and a single kick-butt action scene - and that's because the action scenes were crafted by cartoon action genius Genndy Tartakovsky (of Samurai Jack fame).

Half this movie is Tony Stark moping around feeling sorry for himself, or engaging in an ego trip to mask the pain of what he thinks is imminent death.  Needless to say, none of this is entertaining, and for a guy who in the last film repeatedly put himself in harm's way to save total strangers, he sure doesn't seem to handle the idea of his own demise very well.  After a while, the audience stops feeling sorry for Tony and kind of wish he could go to his grave with a bit more dignity.2. Scarlett Johanssen looks good as usual, but I'm not as convinced as Hollywood seems to be that she can carry a scene with her body.  She's a walking cliche and CGI-rigged ""stunts"" don't help.  Naturally, she must be in a painted-on black suit which accentuates every curve.  She's a gorgeous woman, we get it.  Now please, give her a personality.3. Pepper Potts- well, Miss Paltrow looks pretty awful this time around- blotchy, and her nasty attitude toward her former boss is really over the top.  There's no chemistry between her and Downey, no matter how much they try to convince us that there is by using a heavy, blunt hammer.4. Samuel L Jackson- why even bother?  I can't believe he got a paycheck for this.  Boring, boring, boring.5. Villain- meh, best part of the film but nothing special either.Oh, and btw- in the first film, Cramer bought himself some product placement.  In the second, it was Bill O'Reilly.  Can I assume that Sean Hannity will be in the third film?

We are now drawn deeper into some of the characters, ""warts and all"" as they say. A big part of the Iron Man story is that of redemption; not just physical redemption from the terrorists in the first movie, but the emotional and spiritual redemption from the many vices of Tony Stark. If these aspects of Stark are only given a surface treatment, there's no idea of why Tony is driven to continue to be Iron Man. The ghost of his father, the demon in the bottle, and the self-destructive behaviors all drive Tony to a need for redemption and salvation.True, this isn't a solid, start-to-end, nothing-but-explosions action movie. There is actually some character development and interpersonal relationship development (Tony-Pepper, Tony-Rhodes, Tony-Fury, etc.) that all tie together the motivations behind Tony Stark/Iron Man. Without this, the character makes no sense.But, there is plenty of action. The final battle probably has more action than most action movies, it's just packed into the last 1/4 of the film instead of spread out here and there.I think this movie seems more real, as well. People seem to be searching for words, people talk over each other instead of waiting until A is done before B starts to talk.The additional material would be worth the price alone. There are hours of stuff to watch, and I haven't gotten through all of it yet.

Now with the help of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), James Rhodes (Don Chadel), Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and BlackWidow (Scarlett Johanson) he must conflict an enemy worse than the last one he dealt with.A terrific and entertaining sequel to the surprisingly well done 2008 Marvel film, Jon Feravue returns back as director. I like how this movie deals with conflict including great character development and good acting. The action sequences are even bigger this time around including a very satisfying race track sequence that is just mind-blowing. There's also psychological issues in the film on the main character's conflict about what he is dealing with even with his love for Pepper. I should say this is a very good sequel that sets up for ""Thor"" at the very end of this movie.This Blu-Ray/DVD combo offers fresh brilliant picture and sound quality that skyrockets to the roof with wonderful extras like audio commentary, Footage Scan Mode which explores SHIELD data that pops up during the movie, The Vault which digs deeper into weapons and all that kind of stuff. On-and-off storyboards and animatics during the movie, 8 deleted scenes, documentary, featurettes, art galleries, trailers, music video and Marvel trailers.",5,Very good sequel and a solid blu-ray,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,1756,"['events', 'first', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downy', 'Jr.', 'revealed', 'world', 'Iron-Man', 'making', 'history', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Michael', 'Rouke', 'Jr.', 'father', 'death', 'whom', 'father', 'believed', 'ideas', 'were', 'stolen', 'Starks', 'years', 'ago', 'Ivan', 'Whiplash', 'who', 'hellbent', 'destroying', 'Stark', 'However', 'Tony', 'dealing', 'health', 'problems', 'radiation', 'artificial', 'heart', 'energy', 'source', 'make', 'improved', 'one', 'can', 'cure', 'make', 'better', 'Now', 'help', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'Don', 'Chadel', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'BlackWidow', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'must', 'conflict', 'enemy', 'worse', 'last', 'one', 'with.A', 'terrific', 'entertaining', 'sequel', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', '2008', 'Marvel', 'film', 'Jon', 'Feravue', 'back', 'director', 'like', 'how', 'movie', 'conflict', 'including', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'acting', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'even', 'bigger', 'time', 'around', 'including', 'very', 'satisfying', 'race', 'track', 'sequence', 'just', 'mind-blowing', 'also', 'psychological', 'issues', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'conflict', 'what', 'dealing', 'even', 'love', 'Pepper', 'should', 'say', 'very', 'good', 'sequel', 'up', 'Thor', 'very', 'end', 'movie.This', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'combo', 'offers', 'fresh', 'brilliant', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'roof', 'wonderful', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Footage', 'Scan', 'Mode', 'SHIELD', 'data', 'pops', 'up', 'movie', 'Vault', 'deeper', 'weapons', 'kind', 'stuff', 'On-and-off', 'storyboards', 'animatics', 'movie', '8', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'featurettes', 'art', 'galleries', 'trailers', 'music', 'video', 'Marvel', 'trailers']",N/A
1248098,A1KBY3AWAGJYUC,B0021L8V1G,John Miller,"[0, 0]","Everyone has said Iron Man was a great superhero movie, and I'm wholeheartedly in their camp.  That said, don't let that keep you from watching Iron Man 2.  It's a good movie in its own right.  In Iron Man 2, the world knows that Tony Stark is Iron Man, yet it isn't satisfied.  The U.S. Government wants Stark to give them the technology to the Iron Man suit.  S.H.I.E.L.D. is keeping a close eye on Stark, and Stark Industries is facing new problems brought on by Tony's irresponsibility, culminating with a late-night party while wearing the Iron Man suit.  Stark is slowly being poisoned by the very arc reactor that is also keeping him alive.  How Stark deals with it is what makes this movie so interesting.Robert Downey Jr. suits his role perfectly.  His Tony Stark is egotistical and narcissistic, but still has a playful sense of humor and a powerful desire to do good in the world.  These qualities don't often go together, but Downey brings them all to Stark in a believable way.  I'd pay to watch an entire movie of him sitting by himself--he's that good.Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Pepper Potts, who's a dedicated, hard-working woman trying to manage both Tony and his company, but slowly being driven mad by the stress of it.Don Cheadle steps into the role of Lt. Col. Rhodes, and it isn't one of Cheadle's best.  Terrence Howard played a perfect Rhodes in the first movie--dedicated to the military, but also to his friend Tony, forever putting up with his shenanigans--even standing at attention for three hours on Tony's aircraft.  In this movie, Cheadle just doesn't seem believable as a military man.  In the Congressional hearing, both the Senators and Stark just overpower him verbally, and there just isn't the same level of playful banter between Downey and Cheadle as there was between Downey and Howard.  (No ""Spring Break 1987"" jokes here.)Overall, Iron Man 2 is very much worth watching.  It's just not as good as the first.",4,A sequel that lives up (nearly) to its predecessor,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1960,"['Everyone', 'said', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'great', 'superhero', 'movie', ""'m"", 'wholeheartedly', 'camp', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'watching', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'world', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'yet', ""n't"", 'satisfied', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'Stark', 'give', 'technology', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'keeping', 'close', 'eye', 'Stark', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'facing', 'new', 'problems', 'brought', 'Tony', 'irresponsibility', 'culminating', 'late-night', 'party', 'wearing', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'Stark', 'slowly', 'being', 'poisoned', 'very', 'arc', 'reactor', 'also', 'keeping', 'alive', 'How', 'Stark', 'deals', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'interesting.Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'suits', 'role', 'perfectly', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'egotistical', 'narcissistic', 'still', 'playful', 'sense', 'humor', 'powerful', 'desire', 'do', 'good', 'world', 'qualities', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'go', 'together', 'Downey', 'Stark', 'believable', 'way', ""'d"", 'pay', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'sitting', 'good.Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'role', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'who', 'dedicated', 'hard-working', 'woman', 'trying', 'manage', 'Tony', 'company', 'slowly', 'being', 'driven', 'mad', 'stress', 'it.Don', 'Cheadle', 'role', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Rhodes', ""n't"", 'one', 'Cheadle', 'best', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'played', 'perfect', 'Rhodes', 'first', 'movie', 'dedicated', 'military', 'also', 'friend', 'Tony', 'forever', 'putting', 'up', 'shenanigans', 'even', 'standing', 'attention', 'three', 'hours', 'Tony', 'aircraft', 'movie', 'Cheadle', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believable', 'military', 'man', 'Congressional', 'hearing', 'Senators', 'Stark', 'just', 'overpower', 'verbally', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'same', 'level', 'playful', 'banter', 'Downey', 'Cheadle', 'was', 'Downey', 'Howard', 'No', 'Spring', 'Break', '1987', 'jokes', 'here', 'Overall', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first']",N/A

1248102,A3UOS7EC0NN88A,B0021L8V1G,Jonathan Strawn,"[2, 7]","Iron Man 2 is a huge step down from the first movie. To be fair, it is still pretty entertaining, but in many ways it is like The Incredible Hulk, except it goes in the opposite direction. Where that movie improved on Hulk in many ways(mainly by embracing the Marvel Universe), this film ends up being of comparable quality, but by comparison to the first film it is a huge let down.Actually, in a lot of ways it's a huge let down. There really isn't a conflict to speak of, outside of a few plot contrivances. Tony Stark is dying. Except he's not really dying, as it seems everyone and their brother has a way to fix his problem. Tony Stark has some corporate rivals. Except they're jokes, never really threatening in any way. Tony Stark has someone who has a grudge against him, someone's who might be as brilliant as Tony in a darker way. Except their confrontations are both resolved in anticlimactic moments of action. Moments, at best.The whole problem with the film is that it is all tell and no show. Tony Stark famously says that he has privatized world peace. Except we never see anything close to him actually doing that. In the first film we got a tease of Iron Man fighting warlords and terrorists. Here, we get magazine covers and people talking about vague accomplishments of Iron Man, saying that he's ""on watch,"" but we never see any of it. Then Tony has a breakdown later in the film, a drunken brawl with his friend. Nick Fury shows up and says he's been neglecting his duty and causing messes for Fury to clean up. Except, again, we see no neglect, we see no mess.All in all, there are only really 2 action sequences in the entire film. The first, the famous racecar showdown, is great. Legitimately great. Until it becomes a joke where John Faverau makes himself the big hero. The second big sequence is decent, but it is overly dark, and when it's time to be over it's just over. Iron Man whips out a couple of super weapons and ends the battle in seconds.All in all, the problem, to my mind, seems that Faverau wanted to just let the characters riff on each other, eating up screen time cheaply and spending his money on really big but not very exciting action sequences.That said, there are the elements of a great film here. All the returning actors are great(except Faverau himself, who is just a series of bad jokes in a part that is inexplicably prominent), and Rockwell and Rourke are fantastic as the new villains. Rockwell is hilariously smarmy and annoying, playing an arms dealer who wants to be unscrupulous and underground, but isn't really up to being as threatening or evil as he wants to be. Rourke brings a nice quiet intelligence and menace to his role, playing well off of Rockwell and Downey. I'm actually quite glad that Faverau isn't that involved in The Avengers, as this movie just seems like an exercise in filmmaking excess. And not even the good kind of excess, that involves over-blown action sequences.",3,"Tell tell tell, no show",1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,2953,"['Iron', 'Man', '2', 'huge', 'step', 'down', 'first', 'movie', 'be', 'fair', 'still', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'many', 'ways', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Where', 'movie', 'improved', 'Hulk', 'many', 'ways', 'mainly', 'embracing', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'comparable', 'quality', 'comparison', 'first', 'film', 'huge', 'let', 'down.Actually', 'lot', 'ways', 'huge', 'let', 'down', 'really', ""n't"", 'conflict', 'speak', 'few', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'dying', 'not', 'really', 'dying', 'everyone', 'brother', 'way', 'fix', 'problem', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'corporate', 'rivals', ""'re"", 'jokes', 'never', 'really', 'threatening', 'way', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'someone', 'who', 'grudge', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Tony', 'darker', 'way', 'confrontations', 'are', 'resolved', 'anticlimactic', 'moments', 'action', 'Moments', 'best.The', 'whole', 'problem', 'film', 'tell', 'show', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'famously', 'privatized', 'world', 'peace', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'close', 'actually', 'doing', 'first', 'film', 'got', 'tease', 'Iron', 'Man', 'fighting', 'warlords', 'terrorists', 'Here', 'get', 'magazine', 'covers', 'people', 'talking', 'vague', 'accomplishments', 'Iron', 'Man', 'saying', 'watch', 'never', 'see', 'Then', 'Tony', 'breakdown', 'later', 'film', 'drunken', 'brawl', 'friend', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'up', 'been', 'neglecting', 'duty', 'causing', 'messes', 'Fury', 'clean', 'up', 'again', 'see', 'neglect', 'see', 'mess.All', 'are', 'only', 'really', '2', 'action', 'sequences', 'entire', 'film', 'first', 'famous', 'racecar', 'showdown', 'great', 'Legitimately', 'great', 'joke', 'where', 'John', 'Faverau', 'big', 'hero', 'second', 'big', 'sequence', 'decent', 'overly', 'dark', 'when', 'time', 'be', 'just', 'over', 'Iron', 'Man', 'out', 'couple', 'super', 'weapons', 'battle', 'seconds.All', 'problem', 'mind', 'Faverau', 'wanted', 'just', 'let', 'characters', 'riff', 'other', 'eating', 'up', 'screen', 'time', 'cheaply', 'spending', 'money', 'really', 'big', 'not', 'very', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences.That', 'said', 'are', 'elements', 'great', 'film', 'here', 'returning', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'Faverau', 'who', 'just', 'series', 'bad', 'jokes', 'part', 'inexplicably', 'prominent', 'Rockwell', 'Rourke', 'are', 'fantastic', 'new', 'villains', 'Rockwell', 'hilariously', 'smarmy', 'annoying', 'playing', 'arms', 'dealer', 'who', 'be', 'unscrupulous', 'underground', ""n't"", 'really', 'up', 'being', 'threatening', 'evil', 'be', 'Rourke', 'nice', 'quiet', 'intelligence', 'menace', 'role', 'playing', 'well', 'Rockwell', 'Downey', ""'m"", 'actually', 'quite', 'glad', 'Faverau', ""n't"", 'involved', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'just', 'exercise', 'filmmaking', 'excess', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'kind', 'excess', 'over-blown', 'action', 'sequences']",N/A
1248103,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B0021L8V1G,Jordan David,"[1, 1]","Oh, man, is Johansson smokin'.  Does she just get more impeccable as time goes on?Wait, what am I talking about again...?So, moving on, then.  Ahem.Favreau's take on the Iron Man franchise is quickly becoming a bit like an encompassment of the industry's greatest success stories.All wrapped up in one lucrative, intelligent, and supremely entertaining package, we have the irreplaceable Robert Downey Jr., still riding on what is arguably the greatest career rejuvenation ever accomplished in recent memory; the indelible Mickey Rourke, frontrunner for one the best performances of the last decade when he caught the industry's attention again with his role in ""The Wrestler""; we have the undefinable Sam Rockwell, an eccentricity of a man who has skillfully challenged himself to become an undoubted favorite among cult enthusiasts and mainstream critics alike;  and, of course, there is director Favreau himself, a charming actor/director who's talent had been overlooked for far too long before his superhero breakout hit.For the life of me, I cannot think of a cast and crew more deserving of recognition than this fine group responsible for the new Iron Man pandemonium that still has us in its clutches.  It's all very inspiring and heartwarming to see them enjoy such success.All of this isn't just for article fluff; I'm encouraging you to appreciate just how big of an impact this cast is having on the project.  Without the chemistry that Favreau and Downey, especially, exude seemingly at will for their supporters to feed off of, this film and, indeed, the series itself, would suffer a subpar fate.  Being brutally honest, the script is manic and lacks rhythm, and there's really no excuse for so many protagonists and antagonists to intertwine with one another so freely in a single film.  It's all enough for a more conservative crew to have made three films out of, all clad with their own plot, action sequences, and character progression.Iron Man 2 is dense, and it's clearly a bit of a mess, in retrospect.  But you just cannot deny the charm of everyone it features, and their combined effort more than makes up for it.  With Favreau clearly over his head, he turns to Downey's veteran expertise and ability to turn films in his favor when things are going south.  As a result, this is the actor's film to own, and he's certainly up to the challenge.  When things get noisy, Downey's there to keep some clarity.  When things get dull, Downey dances on a dime to improvise a comic crowd pleaser that brings us all back in.  Iron Man owes its new success to Robert, and vice versa.  It's as impeccable a fit as there ever was one in cinema history.Inevitably, it begs the question if other members of the cast are ready to uphold their own responsibilities in keeping this frantic, bucking bull of a film at bay.  The film visibly suffers when Downey's off the screen, certainly, but not as much as you'd expect.  This is, in no small part, due to Rourke and Rockwell, who's villainous duo give-and-take system serves as evidence that, yes, a comic book movie not named ""The Dark Knight"" can have more than one villain and still be respectable.  The two, in fact, do more than enough to nearly steal the show, but then reality sets back in as Downey returns to drop a dry one-liner that has us in stitches.As far as pandemonium goes, Favreau does about as well as any director could to keep control of things.  I wont hide my concern for the inevitable sequel, should the team choose to one-up themselves in all the wrong places, but my faith benefits from Downey's ability to seemingly do just about everything right and, in turn, encourage others around him to do the same.",3,Iron Man 2,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3694,"['Oh', 'man', 'Johansson', 'smokin', 'just', 'get', 'more', 'impeccable', 'time', 'Wait', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'about', 'again', 'So', 'moving', 'then', 'Ahem.Favreau', 'take', 'Iron', 'Man', 'franchise', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'bit', 'encompassment', 'industry', 'greatest', 'success', 'stories.All', 'wrapped', 'up', 'one', 'lucrative', 'intelligent', 'supremely', 'entertaining', 'package', 'have', 'irreplaceable', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'still', 'riding', 'what', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'career', 'rejuvenation', 'ever', 'accomplished', 'recent', 'memory', 'indelible', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'frontrunner', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'last', 'decade', 'when', 'caught', 'industry', 'attention', 'again', 'role', 'Wrestler', 'have', 'undefinable', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'eccentricity', 'man', 'who', 'skillfully', 'challenged', 'become', 'undoubted', 'favorite', 'cult', 'enthusiasts', 'mainstream', 'critics', 'alike', 'course', 'director', 'Favreau', 'charming', 'actor/director', 'who', 'talent', 'had', 'been', 'overlooked', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'superhero', 'breakout', 'hit.For', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'cast', 'crew', 'more', 'deserving', 'recognition', 'fine', 'group', 'responsible', 'new', 'Iron', 'Man', 'pandemonium', 'still', 'clutches', 'very', 'inspiring', 'heartwarming', 'see', 'enjoy', 'such', 'success.All', ""n't"", 'just', 'article', 'fluff', ""'m"", 'encouraging', 'appreciate', 'just', 'how', 'big', 'impact', 'cast', 'having', 'project', 'chemistry', 'Favreau', 'Downey', 'especially', 'exude', 'seemingly', 'will', 'supporters', 'feed', 'film', 'indeed', 'series', 'would', 'suffer', 'subpar', 'fate', 'Being', 'brutally', 'honest', 'script', 'manic', 'rhythm', 'really', 'excuse', 'so', 'many', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'intertwine', 'one', 'so', 'freely', 'single', 'film', 'enough', 'more', 'conservative', 'crew', 'have', 'made', 'three', 'films', 'clad', 'own', 'plot', 'action', 'sequences', 'character', 'progression.Iron', 'Man', '2', 'dense', 'clearly', 'bit', 'mess', 'retrospect', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'charm', 'everyone', 'combined', 'effort', 'more', 'up', 'Favreau', 'clearly', 'head', 'Downey', 'veteran', 'expertise', 'ability', 'turn', 'films', 'favor', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'south', 'result', 'actor', 'film', 'own', 'certainly', 'up', 'challenge', 'When', 'things', 'get', 'noisy', 'Downey', 'keep', 'clarity', 'When', 'things', 'get', 'dull', 'Downey', 'dime', 'improvise', 'comic', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'back', 'Iron', 'Man', 'new', 'success', 'Robert', 'vice', 'versa', 'impeccable', 'fit', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'cinema', 'history.Inevitably', 'question', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'are', 'ready', 'uphold', 'own', 'responsibilities', 'keeping', 'frantic', 'bucking', 'bull', 'film', 'bay', 'film', 'visibly', 'suffers', 'when', 'Downey', 'off', 'screen', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'expect', 'small', 'part', 'due', 'Rourke', 'Rockwell', 'who', 'villainous', 'duo', 'give-and-take', 'system', 'evidence', 'yes', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'not', 'named', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'can', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'villain', 'still', 'be', 'respectable', 'two', 'fact', 'do', 'more', 'enough', 'nearly', 'steal', 'show', 'then', 'reality', 'sets', 'back', 'Downey', 'drop', 'dry', 'one-liner', 'stitches.As', 'far', 'pandemonium', 'Favreau', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'could', 'keep', 'control', 'things', 'wont', 'hide', 'concern', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'should', 'team', 'choose', 'one-up', 'wrong', 'places', 'faith', 'benefits', 'Downey', 'ability', 'seemingly', 'do', 'just', 'everything', 'right', 'turn', 'encourage', 'others', 'do', 'same']",N/A

1248111,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B0021L8V1G,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[0, 0]","You know you have an all star cast when Samuel L. Jackson plays a bit role.  Is there anyone out there looking forward to ""The Avengers"" movie in 2012.  Robert Downey Jr. is one of my all time favorite actors.  The dude can play any role and make you believe he really is the character he is portraying.  I swear there are times that I now think he actually is Tony Stark.  How can the guy be so versatile?  In addition to these two you have Don Cheadle adequately playing the role of Lt. Colonel Rhodes, with Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell and of course Mickey Rourke rounding out the bunch.  Jon Favreau even continued his role as the body guard while directing the movie in the background.For me sequels are always a little hard to swallow since the initial introduction to the general theme has been lost.  You go into a sequel knowing more of what to expect so they are easily predictable.  Iron Man II was just that.  It was predictable in the plot, theme, general flow but setting that aside it was also pretty damn good.  Filled with action, great acting, and as always in the world of Tony Stark, lots of sarcasm and a bevy of smoking hot women.  The latter being one of my favorite parts in any movie.The opening scene kicks off with the Tony Stark (Iron Man) jumping from a plane and landing in the middle of some Las Vegas dancers, as he kicks off his yearlong expo on technology.  Is there anyone but me that thinks they were making fun of some needless trade shows out there?  We find out a few minutes into the movie that Tony Stark's much heralded power supply is actually killing him.  He doesn't have long to live.  He then spends a good chunk of his time trying to find a replacement source to save his life, and to keep his suit charged up for some good ass whooping.When you throw in Ivan Vanko, who is just one badass dude, you now have the makings of a struggle for supremacy, with good fighting evil.  Isn't that what super hero movies are all about.  Mickey Rourke might be a bizarre guy in real life but every time the guy gets on screen he shows you why he is a great actor.  When Iron Man replicas start popping up trying to kill Tony off, the action begins and everything around everyone starts blowing up.  What can I say, if you love action movies filled with sarcastic one liners and a comedic overtone you will enjoy the movie.  There is an endless supply of both.I would have to surmise the movie was predictable but definitely enjoyable.  I can laughingly say this review might even be a waste of time since everyone on the planet has probably seen the movie already anyway.  If you haven't then you probably should.  You will know what to expect when you enter the theater and you will leave not having been disappointed and in my opinion thoroughly entertained.",4,"Predictable, but damn good!",1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,2817,"['know', 'have', 'star', 'cast', 'when', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'bit', 'role', 'there', 'anyone', 'there', 'looking', 'forward', 'Avengers', 'movie', '2012', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'dude', 'can', 'play', 'role', 'make', 'believe', 'really', 'character', 'portraying', 'swear', 'are', 'times', 'now', 'think', 'actually', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'How', 'can', 'guy', 'be', 'so', 'versatile', 'addition', 'two', 'have', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'adequately', 'playing', 'role', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'Rhodes', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'course', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'rounding', 'out', 'bunch', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'even', 'continued', 'role', 'body', 'guard', 'directing', 'movie', 'background.For', 'sequels', 'are', 'always', 'little', 'hard', 'swallow', 'initial', 'introduction', 'general', 'theme', 'been', 'lost', 'go', 'sequel', 'knowing', 'more', 'what', 'expect', 'are', 'easily', 'predictable', 'Iron', 'Man', 'II', 'was', 'just', 'was', 'predictable', 'plot', 'theme', 'general', 'flow', 'setting', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'Filled', 'action', 'great', 'acting', 'always', 'world', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'lots', 'sarcasm', 'bevy', 'smoking', 'hot', 'women', 'latter', 'being', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'kicks', 'off', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'jumping', 'plane', 'landing', 'middle', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'dancers', 'yearlong', 'expo', 'technology', 'there', 'anyone', 'were', 'making', 'fun', 'needless', 'trade', 'out', 'there', 'find', 'out', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'much', 'heralded', 'power', 'supply', 'actually', 'killing', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'live', 'then', 'good', 'chunk', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'replacement', 'source', 'save', 'life', 'keep', 'suit', 'charged', 'up', 'good', 'ass', 'whooping.When', 'throw', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'who', 'just', 'one', 'badass', 'dude', 'now', 'have', 'makings', 'struggle', 'supremacy', 'good', 'fighting', 'evil', ""n't"", 'what', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'are', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'might', 'be', 'bizarre', 'guy', 'real', 'life', 'time', 'guy', 'screen', 'why', 'great', 'actor', 'When', 'Iron', 'Man', 'start', 'popping', 'up', 'trying', 'kill', 'Tony', 'action', 'everything', 'everyone', 'blowing', 'up', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'action', 'movies', 'filled', 'sarcastic', 'one', 'liners', 'comedic', 'overtone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'endless', 'supply', 'both.I', 'would', 'have', 'surmise', 'movie', 'was', 'predictable', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'laughingly', 'say', 'review', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'everyone', 'planet', 'probably', 'seen', 'movie', 'already', 'anyway', 'have', ""n't"", 'then', 'probably', 'should', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'enter', 'theater', 'will', 'leave', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'disappointed', 'opinion', 'thoroughly', 'entertained']",N/A

Probably the greatest thing about the first Iron Man film is that, nobody really knew what to expect. Those outside of the comic book community in fact were not very familiar or aware of the Iron Man character like they were of Spider-man or the X-Men. In addition Robert Downey Jr. had not created a very positive reputation in the preceding years and most did not know about the director, Jon Favreau, and his ability to helm a superhero flick. Well as it would be, all of this rode in favor of the novice superhero filmmaker and gave him the chance to wow the world with this movie. Because movie studios primary concern 99.9% of the time is making more and more money they green lit what was sure to be another money hungry superhero blockbuster and production was underway only a year after the first film had been released. Now this can result in a few outcomes. The movie could be horrible having rushed a screenplay, been careless with casting actors and performances and an overall lack of quality control. Luckily this was not the case. Although it wasn't as good as the first film, all too uncommon to do especially these days, this was a good Iron Man sequel. I think part of the reason it couldn't be as good as the first movie was because now that we all know how good the first movie was we expect par or perhaps even better.

1248122,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0021L8V1G,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[6, 9]","The summer of 2010 is nearly upon us and here to ring in the blistering heat is the first official blockbuster of the season, ""Iron Man 2"". After the gigantic success of ""Iron Man"" in 2008, the inevitable sequel was quickly announced by Marvel Studios. So, with only two short years to piece together the continuing story of billionaire Tony Stark and his alter-ego Iron Man, director Jon Favreau and company quickly began working on what could possibly be one of the biggest movies, if not the biggest of the year. With expectations surrounding this follow-up understandably high, ""Iron Man 2"" would definitely need to up the stakes and the spectacle in order to meet audience demand. But have no fear true believer (just a little nod to Stan Lee there); this movie succeeds brilliantly on all counts.""Iron Man 2"" picks up six months after the events of the previous film. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is beginning to feel the pressure of living the life of a publicly known superhero. With his behavior growing more and more erratic, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) begin to wonder if Tony's days as Iron Man need to come to a close. Meanwhile, a new threat is emerging onto the scene, Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash (Mickey Rourke), seeking to destroy Tony Stark for sins of the father, so to speak. Plus, a rival weapons manufacturer, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), is trying to create his own version of the Iron Man armor, and will stop at nothing to achieve his ambitious goal. With so much at stake, Tony will have to look inside himself to rediscover the man behind the armor, and in a sense re-forge the Iron Man.The first film featured a terrific blend of action, comedy (well-written and smart, not so much tongue-in-cheek), drama, and stunning visual effects to bring the hero to life. With ""Iron Man 2"" the action is even more intense, with bigger special effects sequences, but this time the comedy takes more of a backseat to make room for a much more dramatic storyline. Put all of these elements together and mix them just right and you've got yourself a recipe for another successful superhero jaunt.The action sequences in the original were fast-paced and well-executed pieces of summer movie fun. However, the action in this film blows away everything that was done before with considerable ease. If you thought that there wasn't enough armored action the first-go-round, then ""Iron Man 2"" should definitely meet your needs. If nothing else, the final 30 minutes of the movie will leave even the most ardent action junkie satisfied for quite some time.Assisting in creating the incredible action scenes is some truly impressive visual effects work courtesy once more from Industrial Light and Magic. The visuals' seamless blend with the live action elements makes the futuristic aspects of the movie more believable rather than if the CGI had been over-the-top. Case in point, the holographic imagery Stark uses when associating/working with JARVIS in the lab. This obvious usage of CGI while very apparent doesn't seem all that removed from our reality, to the point that one could easily see this tech being available in the not so distant future. Not to mention all of the CGI intensive moments featuring Iron Man and War Machine in action are so exciting, and for comic book lovers, seeing the duo fighting side-by-side is simply incredible. Their scenes alone make it worth watching on the big screen at least one time.Of course, the glue holding all of the exciting visuals and thrilling action sequences together is the solid screenplay written by Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder""), featuring elements loosely based upon the acclaimed ""Demon in a Bottle"" storyline from the comic books. As I stated earlier, the original film featured plenty of humor, wit, and sarcasm (primarily from Tony), this installment opts for a more mature tone which is very appropriate given the upheavals occurring in Tony's life after his proclamation of, ""I am Iron Man."" So, for those of you hoping for the same light-hearted fare, sorry not this time, and honestly the movie works well without it.Now, there are some that felt this darker tinged story, especially in the first half of the movie, causes this entry to not feel as fun or entertaining as its predecessor. Personally, I felt the thematic shift was a natural progression for the character (not to mention keeping in-line with the comic book source material), and had the humor remained front-and-center then the story would have fallen flat on its face. While I do understand the detractors' point of view, the lesser success of the two ""Fantastic Four"" movies should serve as a prime example of allowing for too much humor, thus, overshadowing the potential for good dramatic storytelling. Thankfully, screenwriter Justin Theroux and director Jon Favreau managed to avoid the aforementioned movies' pratfall, and the drama was allowed a chance to thrive.Of course, the story would be nothing without the incredible cast assembled to breathe life into these iconic characters. Leading the assemblage once more is Hollywood's most successful comeback kid, Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Robert appears to be relishing the opportunity to reprise what could easily be called his most recognizable role. Robert once again brings his smooth talking, hyper-active personality to the character, but with a darker edge than previously seen. Portraying a man on the edge of losing his way, Robert's terrific performance was most likely influenced by his own infamous past. Even with the darker thematic elements, Downey, Jr. manages to keep things interesting and from sinking too far down during the film's gloomy, yet necessary moments.In the supporting roles we find actress Gwyneth Paltrow returning as Pepper Potts. While Gwyneth easily holds her own opposite Robert, and their scenes are always rife with a playful tension and chemistry; sadly, it felt like her role was somewhat diminished from that of the original film. Even though she was featured throughout the entire duration, often times she seemed to be more of an afterthought to the scenes. Obviously, in a film with such a large cast, fitting everyone in with equal time is a difficult task, so I do understand that some judicious editing had to be done. Also, I'm not saying that having a little less Pepper Potts results in a less enjoyable movie, not in the least bit. I was just surprised more than anything to see her character on the backburner.The character of Lt. Col. James Rhodes, portrayed this time by Don Cheadle (""Traitor"") replacing Terrence Howard, is much more involved in not only the story, but also the action sequences, due to his donning of the War Machine armor. I was curious as to what I was going to think of Don Cheadle as Rhodes compared to Terrence, since I enjoyed his portrayal in the first movie. However, after seeing the movie I was left wishing Cheadle would have portrayed the character in both films. As good of an actor as Terrence Howard is, Don Cheadle really looked like he fit the part, and played the role perfectly both in and out of the armor. Cheadle just came off as a harder, more militaristic man in his portrayal, whereas Terrence seemed more on the softer side and slightly out of place in the role by comparison. It's too bad we can't go back and do some re-shoots to insert Don Cheadle into the original movie for better continuity.Several new characters joined the cast of the expanding Marvel movie universe as we were introduced to Stark Industries' main business rival Justin Hammer, the villainous Ivan Vanko, and undercover spy Natasha Romanoff. Sam Rockwell (""Moon"") is perfectly sniveling and smarmy as Justin Hammer. He's a man who, like Tony Stark, is recognized for his weapons manufacturing, but unlike Stark he has no qualms about eliminating whoever gets in his way. As the film's primary villain, Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash, Mickey Rourke (""Sin City"") is creepy, brilliant, cold, and calculating in every aspect of his plot for vengeance against the Stark family and their business empire.Now, Mickey Rourke may be a strange guy in the real world, and some could even argue a bit unstable, but one thing is for certain, he is one great actor. His performance was spot on every step of the way. For instance, unlike so many American actors, he never once appeared to struggle to maintain his character's Russian accent throughout the whole duration. This character will not garner him the accolades that his role in ""The Wrestler"" did, but he should be recognized all the same for continually putting terrific work on display every time he hits the screen.Rounding out the newcomers is Scarlett Johansson (""The Island"") as Natasha Romanoff, otherwise known as the Black Widow in the comic book world. Scarlett establishes her character in a humorous moment early on as being much more than what she seems, and from there we are given a character that is smart, sexy, and above all, lethal. After seeing her in this movie, I can't wait to see more of Scarlett's take on the Black Widow in future installments of this series or maybe even in some of the other Marvel franchises that are in the works.Lastly, Samuel L. Jackson returns once more as the Director of S.H.I.E.LD., Nick Fury. At the end of the previous film, we are introduced to Nick Fury, albeit ever so briefly. Thankfully, this time around he is given a little bit more screen time, popping up every once in a while over the course of the movie. Samuel is clearly enjoying his role as the Marvel Universe's top spy, and is leaving fans wanting to see more of his character in the future films.So, when all is said and done, without a doubt ""Iron Man 2"" easily lives up to all the hype. Boasting an engaging story that is filled with terrific characters, plenty of new plot developments, and incredible action scenes that are brimming with stunning CGI; director Jon Favreau's follow-up delivers in every way imaginable and even manages to surpass its predecessor. Not a bad day's work for a superhero.""Iron Man 2"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,"Two ""Iron"" Men Are Better Than One...",1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,10165,"['summer', '2010',

Like the majority of these negative reviewers think that they could write, produce and direct something better! It's especially ironic how this sequel is on par with the first film and everyone just loved and adored that one but hate the new one. That makes a lot of sense. You have the same, if not even better amazing acting ( especially in Robert Downey Jr. ). You have an even better villian and ending action sequence better than the first film. There is continued awesome character development there as well. Seriously people? I find it amusing and hilarious that all these folks out there always cry for a movie like this to be made, with the amazing acting and storytelling. But as soon as this type of film is delivered they just have to step on and squash it. This kind of attitude seems to be the new fad and way of life this day and age. You see, I enjoy movies for what they truely are, MOVIES! Entertainment. Not a real way of life. We as humans are flawed and so are the films we make. We are never going to be perfect. People waste too much energy striving to achieve something that does not exist, perfection! Anyway's, I loved the movie. It was pure awesome entertainment. Cant wait for the 3rd installment.

1248124,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B0021L8V1G,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[2, 3]","I didn't read a lot of comics when I was a kid, but I'm willing to bet Iron Man director Jon Favreau did. He has an affinity for adding just the right touch of reality to back up the color and action for a superhero movie. A lot of sequels make the mistake of just reiterating the first movie, happily Iron Man 2 doesn't try to mirror what they think are the successful elements of the first movie and move the storyline along.Iron Man 2 picks up six months after the end of the first movie. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is the fast talking industrialist who has outed himself as Iron Man. In that six months Iron Man has created world peace, although, the Iron Man suit is slowly poisoning him. As other nations scramble to create the technology of Iron Man for their own purposes, a hawkish Senator (Garry Shandling) wants Stark to turn over the Iron Man ""weapon"" to the Government. In Russia, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) labors away in a grimy workshop trying to regain his place in the world that he thinks Tony Stark's father stole from him. Working from his father's plans he creates an ARC reactor (the reactor that also powers Iron Man) of his own and tries to kill Tony Stark with the supercharged whiplash. I'd give a fuller synopsis but the rest of the action of the movie derives from these events and I think you'll enjoy discovering for yourself what happens next when you see the movie.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as the bon vivant, Tony Stark/Iron Man, who for all his best intentions, his drinking problem is catching up with him and starts affecting the integrity of Iron Man. Don Cheadle does a turn as Lt. Col. James Rhodes (replacing Terrence Howard) as Stark's military liaison and best friend. Mickey Rourke continues his string of strong performances as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, and although the part could have been pushed over the top, Rourke plays it gritty and realistic. Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux are smart enough to build a strong story to carry and provide a reason for the action instead of having action drive the story.The few minor criticisms of the movie, Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer seems a little too much a caricature, I couldn't tell if he was trying to play the character straight or was trying to be a little campy with it. Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff in her fight scene it looks lifted from the Matrix and even seems to resemble Matrix ""bullet time"" filming which is different than any other part of the movie. The studio seems to be trying to plant too many seeds of upcoming movies, a Captain America reference, and the post credit coda sequence. In the movie we're given a reason to suspend our disbelief and believe in a world that can have an Iron Man (or a Batman) but if you start having super-heros pop up all over the place it starts to seem unreal and cartoony.Iron Man 2 is a strong follow-up to the first movie and you shouldn't miss a chance to see it.",4,Strong Suit For Iron Man 2,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,2948,"['did', ""n't"", 'read', 'lot', 'comics', 'when', 'was', 'kid', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'Iron', 'Man', 'director', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'did', 'affinity', 'adding', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'reality', 'back', 'up', 'color', 'action', 'superhero', 'movie', 'lot', 'sequels', 'make', 'mistake', 'just', 'reiterating', 'first', 'movie', 'happily', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', ""n't"", 'try', 'mirror', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'successful', 'elements', 'first', 'movie', 'move', 'storyline', 'along.Iron', 'Man', '2', 'up', 'six', 'months', 'end', 'first', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'fast', 'talking', 'industrialist', 'who', 'outed', 'Iron', 'Man', 'six', 'months', 'Iron', 'Man', 'created', 'world', 'peace', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'slowly', 'poisoning', 'other', 'nations', 'scramble', 'create', 'technology', 'Iron', 'Man', 'own', 'purposes', 'hawkish', 'Senator', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Stark', 'turn', 'over', 'Iron', 'Man', 'weapon', 'Government', 'Russia', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'away', 'grimy', 'workshop', 'trying', 'regain', 'place', 'world', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'father', 'stole', 'Working', 'father', 'plans', 'ARC', 'reactor', 'reactor', 'also', 'Iron', 'Man', 'own', 'tries', 'kill', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'supercharged', 'whiplash', ""'d"", 'give', 'fuller', 'synopsis', 'rest', 'action', 'movie', 'events', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'discovering', 'what', 'next', 'when', 'see', 'movie.Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'excellent', 'bon', 'vivant', 'Tony', 'Stark/Iron', 'Man', 'who', 'best', 'intentions', 'drinking', 'problem', 'catching', 'up', 'affecting', 'integrity', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'turn', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'replacing', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Stark', 'military', 'liaison', 'best', 'friend', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'string', 'strong', 'performances', 'Ivan', 'Vanko/Whiplash', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pushed', 'top', 'Rourke', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'Favreau', 'screenwriter', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'build', 'strong', 'story', 'carry', 'provide', 'reason', 'action', 'instead', 'having', 'action', 'drive', 'story.The', 'few', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'caricature', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'trying', 'play', 'character', 'straight', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'little', 'campy', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Natalie', 'Rushman/Natasha', 'Romanoff', 'fight', 'scene', 'lifted', 'Matrix', 'even', 'resemble', 'Matrix', 'bullet', 'time', 'filming', 'different', 'other', 'part', 'movie', 'studio', 'be', 'trying', 'plant', 'too', 'many', 'seeds', 'upcoming', 'movies', 'Captain', 'America', 'reference', 'post', 'credit', 'coda', 'sequence', 'movie', ""'re"", 'given', 'reason', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'believe', 'world', 'can', 'have', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Batman', 'start', 'having', 'super-heros', 'pop', 'up', 'place', 'seem', 'unreal', 'cartoony.Iron', 'Man', '2', 'strong', 'follow-up', 'first', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss', 'chance', 'see']",N/A

1248127,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B0021L8V1G,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[3, 4]","I really loved the first IRON MAN, and am very pleased that they released IRON MAN 2, so that Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., and IRON MAN (an interesting trinity) could continue their fight for truth, justice and the American way.  While not as good as the first, IRON MAN 2 is still a good, fun, entertaining film, one that my husband and I really enjoyed watching.IRON MAN 2 basically picks up where IRON MAN left off.  It has been 6 months since Tony Stark revealed to the world that he is IRON MAN.  Stark is fighting to keep his technology from being weaponized by the government, still attempting to achieve world peace, and this time, he is also fighting for his life.The returning cast of IRON MAN 2 (Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson) continue to be outstanding, and the newest members (Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell) are definitely up to the task.  New comic book super heroes and super villains (Black Widow and Whiplash) are added to the mix, and are very fun.  The special effects are top notch (especially dazzling are Whiplash's electric whips), and the plot is enjoyable, though not quite up to the level of the first IRON MAN.It looks like there is going to be an IRON MAN 3, and I hope that the get back that special ""pop"" that the first movie had.  There are also going to be a number of spin offs, most notably one for Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.  Hopefully, these movies, too, will live up to the original IRON MAN.

It is snowing outside, while an old man, Anton Vanko, lay dying in his bed, his son Ivan sitting next to him.  Apparently Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark) and Anton had worked together many years ago developing plans, but Howard had Anton shipped off to Siberia where he lived the rest of his life in poverty, while Howard Stark became filthy rich. Needless to say, Ivan is a bit upset when daddy dies.  He grabs some plans and starts working feverishly on an Iron Man ""heart"".Back in New York, Tony Stark is telling the world he is Iron Man and celebrating with a big Expo celebration for single-handedly achieving world peace.  He is summoned to Washington DC to testify before some Senate Committee and asked to turn over the Iron Man suit to the government because it is a weapon.  Of course, his answer is no.Back in Stark's ocean-front Malibu home, we find out the paladium core so vital to Iron Man is also killing Tony slowly by increasing his blood toxicity levels.  Not telling Gwenyth Paltrow, he appoints her CEO of Stark Industries and his successor, if anything happens to him.In the famous Monaco street race is where bad-guy Ivan catches up with Tony.  He comes at him with a bad attitude and a bad invention he has cooked up in his little make-shift Moscow lab.There is a lot of action that follows with the good-guy/bad-guy thing while Tony is trying to find something to keep him from paladium meltdown.  The CGI is great and the Iron Man characters are bigger than life.I thought the first one was better, maybe because the concept was new or maybe because I waited for this one for awhile.  In any case, the movie was still excellent and well worth seeing.  It was hard to believe that Ivan was Mickey Rourke.

1248132,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0021L8V1G,K. Driscoll,"[0, 0]","Iron Man 2 is another sequel to a comic book action film that works, and may even exceed the quality ofits predecessor.  It is a sequel to 2008's Iron Man and other than James Rhodes (who was portrayed by Terrence Howard in the first film but is now played by Don Cheadle) the cast has returned.  It is hard to rave about a movie that is for the most part a simple sequel that isn't a huge improvement on the original, but on the other hand the first film was so good it's important to include Iron Man 2 as among the best comic book films to be made so far within a relatively newer sub-genre in its renaissance.  Jon Favreau directs and once again walks a fine line between serious drama and kitsch with great success.  He has to be one of the brightest filmmakers doing pure Hollywood blockbusters today.  He's a filmmaker doing what he wants and having fun with it, but making the suits very happy.Iron Man 2 brings the arrogant drunk arms dealer Tony Stark, whose just charming enough to like, back but under the scrutiny of  Senator Stern (played by Gary Shandling) for withholding a serious weapon; himself.  Stark is human enough to work on screen and it makes it all the more intriguing when we see a flawed personality like him make good decisions.  He is a greater hero than most casual comic book readers give him credit for and it is nice to see this franchise get this kind of outstanding treatment.  Tony's Iron Man technology is something that Stern feels could get into the wrong hands and used against the United States, but Stark quickly demonstrates that this just isn't the case. Of course the film's most notable baddie demonstrates otherwise when he shows up and attacks Iron Man himself.  He is Ivan Vanko, a maniacal super genius physicist who has harnessed some of Stark's technology to create giant appendages that can cut cars in half.  In the spirit of the comics Vanko is aesthetically an interpretation of the more obscure Whiplash and that is his name, but he is essentially The Crimson Dynamo as I remember him, and Ivan's father (a rival of Stark's father) even bears the classic villain's real name, Anton.  Either way it is a fantastic hybrid and with Mickey Rourke at his absolute best Iron Man 2 has a villain more than worthy of top praise.  Whiplash is awesome and I was openly cheering for him the whole time.  He is funded by naive and clumsy Justin Hammer (played by Sam Rockwell) who is really the archetype rich boy villain.  He's like one of those rich guys on those horrific reality shows that everyone hates with blind passion.  He is Tony Stark without the witty humor, ethics, intelligence, and style.  He's Tony Stark if Brett Ratner directed Iron Man.  Regardless, Hammer is a great villain and Sam Rockwell deserves some praise for a truly thankless performance.  All these great casting choices and I almost forget to mention that Iron Man gets some awesome help with the return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the first screen appearance of sexy future Avenger Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and of course James Rhodes, who becomes War Machine.That is of course a summary worthy of some top of the line special effects and that is what these movies need if they are going to make big money.  They get it here within some outstanding action scenes, but Iron Man 2 deserves extra praise for being a thoughtfully written film that truly puts together one of the best casts I've ever seen for roles like this.  Gwenyth Paltrow (who returns as Pepper Potts) and Robert Downey, Jr. have chemistry well beyond the standards of normal action fare and Jon Favreau himself lends some legitimate comic relief, a staple in these films, hamming it up as Happy Hogan.  This is a fantastic action film that puts all the elements it takes to make a good film in their right place.  One nitpicking might be that I wanted to see more duel screen time for Rourke and Downey, Jr., being that both actors are at the top of their game and making us forget that they are still in the midst of their respective comebacks.  Iron Man versus Whiplash is turned into a rivalry that tops all but Batman and The Joker inThe Dark Knight.  I can't wait to see what the future brings for Marvel Studios and Iron Man.  Oh, and do not forget to wait and watch after the credits for more hints toward future Marvel Studios projects.",4,An Intriguing and Impressive Sequel,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,4355,"['Iron', 'Man', '2', 'sequel', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'film', 'may', 'even', 'exceed', 'quality', 'predecessor', 'sequel', '2008', 'Iron', 'Man', 'other', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'who', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'first', 'film', 'now', 'played', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'cast', 'returned', 'hard', 'rave', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'simple', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'huge', 'improvement', 'original', 'other', 'hand', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'important', 'include', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'be', 'made', 'so', 'far', 'relatively', 'newer', 'sub-genre', 'renaissance', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'directs', 'once', 'again', 'walks', 'fine', 'line', 'serious', 'drama', 'kitsch', 'great', 'success', 'be', 'one', 'brightest', 'filmmakers', 'doing', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'today', 'filmmaker', 'doing', 'what', 'having', 'fun', 'making', 'suits', 'very', 'happy.Iron', 'Man', '2', 'arrogant', 'drunk', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'just', 'charming', 'enough', 'like', 'back', 'scrutiny', 'Senator', 'Stern', 'played', 'Gary', 'Shandling', 'withholding', 'serious', 'weapon', 'Stark', 'human', 'enough', 'work', 'screen', 'more', 'intriguing', 'when', 'see', 'flawed', 'personality', 'make', 'good', 'decisions', 'greater', 'hero', 'most', 'casual', 'comic', 'book', 'readers', 'give', 'credit', 'nice', 'see', 'franchise', 'get', 'kind', 'outstanding', 'treatment', 'Tony', 'Iron', 'Man', 'technology', 'something', 'Stern', 'feels', 'could', 'get', 'wrong', 'hands', 'used', 'United', 'States', 'Stark', 'quickly', 'just', ""n't"", 'case', 'course', 'film', 'most', 'notable', 'baddie', 'demonstrates', 'otherwise', 'when', 'up', 'attacks', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'maniacal', 'super', 'genius', 'physicist', 'who', 'harnessed', 'Stark', 'technology', 'create', 'giant', 'appendages', 'can', 'cut', 'cars', 'half', 'spirit', 'comics', 'Vanko', 'aesthetically', 'interpretation', 'more', 'obscure', 'Whiplash', 'name', 'essentially', 'Crimson', 'Dynamo', 'remember', 'Ivan', 'father', 'rival', 'Stark', 'father', 'even', 'classic', 'villain', 'real', 'name', 'Anton', 'way', 'fantastic', 'hybrid', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'absolute', 'best', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'villain', 'more', 'worthy', 'top', 'praise', 'Whiplash', 'awesome', 'was', 'openly', 'cheering', 'whole', 'time', 'funded', 'naive', 'clumsy', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'played', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'who', 'really', 'archetype', 'rich', 'boy', 'villain', 'one', 'rich', 'guys', 'horrific', 'reality', 'everyone', 'blind', 'passion', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'witty', 'humor', 'ethics', 'intelligence', 'style', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'directed', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Regardless', 'Hammer', 'great', 'villain', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'praise', 'truly', 'thankless', 'performance', 'great', 'casting', 'choices', 'almost', 'forget', 'mention', 'Iron', 'Man', 'awesome', 'help', 'return', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'first', 'screen', 'appearance', 'sexy', 'future', 'Avenger', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'course', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'who', 'War', 'Machine.That', 'course', 'summary', 'worthy', 'top', 'line', 'special', 'effects', 'what', 'movies', 'need', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'big', 'money', 'get', 'here', 'outstanding', 'action', 'scenes', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'extra', 'praise', 'being', 'thoughtfully', 'written', 'film', 'truly', 'together', 'one', 'best', 'casts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'roles', 'Gwenyth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'have', 'chemistry', 'well', 'standards', 'normal', 'action', 'fare', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'legitimate', 'comic', 'relief', 'staple', 'films', 'hamming', 'up', 'Happy', 'Hogan', 'fantastic', 'action', 'film', 'elements', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'right', 'place', 'One', 'nitpicking', 'might', 'be', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'duel', 'screen', 'time', 'Rourke', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'being', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'making', 'forget', 'are', 'still', 'midst', 'respective', 'comebacks', 'Iron', 'Man', 'versus', 'Whiplash', 'turned', 'rivalry', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'inThe', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'future', 'brings', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Oh', 'do', 'not', 'forget', 'wait', 'watch', 'credits', 'more', 'hints', 'future', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'projects']",N/A

Loria,"[1, 1]","It is inevitable to compare the sequel to it's 2008 original, and the first IRON MAN was great, fanboy status aside I recommended it to everyone....I would make the same recommendation for IM2, across the board.... But if you are a fanboy, you already know this because you went to the midnight show!Robert Downey Jr.  was talked about connected with the role long before it became a fact, so he is still dream casting for the role of Tony Stark, and he still exceeds expectations as the Industrialist, this time facing certain death due to his HEARTcondition. Tony overindulges in the Celebrity, parties and booze as he embraces while searching for a cure and trying to find himself, too . This is a classic IM storyline from the comics, as is his confrontation with WhipLash a.K.a Ivan Venko a.k.a. Mickey Rourke, out to reclaim his family right to the Stark Legacy. Meanwhile,  the government and wacky , rival weapons-manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) are pressuring Tony to turn the IRON MAN tech over to the government. Once flippantly reassuring the Senate committee that he has things under control, Venko appears and all hell busts loose. Stark's best bud Col 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time Don Cheadle)is out to help Tony back on track while struggling with his own duties and responsibilities to protect the Country.The story is a little crowed with Whiplash working on his revenge, Rhodey overcoming his personal obstacles and Tony's, the slinky agent Black widow infiltrating Stark Industries while Tony's unrequited love Pepper Potts (Paltrow) takes over the Company while it appears that holding on to the IM tech was a mistake, once an armored super villain appears, and later a haywire drone army. Although, I would question the point of Scarlett Johansson's character , but for the super-spy cat suit fight sequence along with director Jon Favreau, which causes me to preemptively retract said statement and enjoy the spandex and party dresses. And Venko's backstory is thankfully short , as is the movie get to the action, from the Opening scene the film is high energy and beautiful graphics.... everything  from the dancing EXPO  girls...the Iron Man-ites, to  the fight between IRON MAN and War Machine (for non-geeks War Machine is the armor Rhodes wears during his time as IRON MAN in the comics, seen in IM1). In fact the fight between Tony and Rhodes at the party to a mix-music is worth admission!!!Cheadle as Rhodey was a good swap the great chemistry between him and RDJr., RDJr. and Paltrow still great. Robert Downey Jr. slips right back ...I'm reminded by IM2 why I was a such a hugh Rourke fan even thru the STUPId Yrs...he does soooo much with soooo little, count Rourke's lines, most  in Russian and tell me it ain't an amazing performance, the presences...(while you are at it look up Angel Heart and Prayer for the Dying, 2 great Mickey Rourke movies).

1248141,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0021L8V1G,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","This lightning-fast, overstuffed sequel is plenty of fun.  And when I say ""plenty,"" I mean there's more going on than in any season of most TV shows.  This movie has so many irons in the fire (pardon the pun) that keeping up with them is a job.  If I had to find one fault with this film, there is so much awesome content that I can't keep all of it straight.  A little trimming might not be amiss.Months after revealing his secret identity, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark as Iron Man (got that?) has brought world peace, become even more of a celebrity, and lost control of his life.  So he promoted his assistant to CEO, hires Scarlett Johanssen to keep his schedule, and gives Nick Fury the cold shoulder.  But he has secret rivals: Mickey Rourke wants to reclaim his father's legacy, and Don Cheadle as Rhodey wants Stark tech in U.S. Army hands.For a movie stuffed with lickety-split comic book action, this one also carries a lot of smart character development, dry humor, and real-world political commentary.  But you already know that if you saw the first one.  This one contains no surprises; it just pushes the dynamics from the first film to even greater heights of accomplishment.  It's not so much a sequel as the second half of a single film.But as I say, it's overstuffed.  It runs 125 minutes, a hair shorter than the original, but feels much longer.  Between business, politics, romance, heroism, military, and more, this movie has more threads running through than a knitters' convention.  Not one of them is poor, and I loved them all, but when a character comes back after a thirty-minute absence and I can't recall who that is, the film is too busy.This movie made me laugh, cheer, and think.  I enjoyed it.  It has good set pieces, smart characters, an energetic story, and plenty to keep a diverse audience engaged.  I just wish it were a little slimmer, so I could keep all the numerous story elements in mind.",4,"Smart, Funny, and Maybe a Bit Overstuffed",1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,1935,"['lightning-fast', 'overstuffed', 'sequel', 'plenty', 'fun', 'when', 'say', 'plenty', 'mean', 'more', 'going', 'season', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'irons', 'fire', 'pun', 'keeping', 'up', 'job', 'had', 'find', 'one', 'fault', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'awesome', 'content', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'straight', 'little', 'trimming', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'amiss.Months', 'revealing', 'secret', 'identity', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'got', 'brought', 'world', 'peace', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'celebrity', 'lost', 'control', 'life', 'promoted', 'assistant', 'CEO', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'keep', 'schedule', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'secret', 'rivals', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'reclaim', 'father', 'legacy', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Rhodey', 'Stark', 'tech', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'movie', 'stuffed', 'lickety-split', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'one', 'also', 'lot', 'smart', 'character', 'development', 'dry', 'humor', 'real-world', 'political', 'commentary', 'already', 'know', 'saw', 'first', 'one', 'one', 'surprises', 'just', 'dynamics', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'greater', 'heights', 'accomplishment', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sequel', 'second', 'half', 'single', 'film.But', 'say', '125', 'minutes', 'hair', 'shorter', 'original', 'feels', 'much', 'longer', 'Between', 'business', 'politics', 'romance', 'heroism', 'military', 'more', 'movie', 'more', 'threads', 'running', 'knitters', 'convention', 'Not', 'one', 'poor', 'loved', 'when', 'character', 'back', 'thirty-minute', 'absence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'who', 'film', 'too', 'busy.This', 'movie', 'made', 'cheer', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'good', 'set', 'pieces', 'smart', 'characters', 'energetic', 'story', 'plenty', 'keep', 'diverse', 'audience', 'engaged', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'little', 'slimmer', 'could', 'keep', 'numerous', 'story', 'elements', 'mind']",N/A
1248142,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0021L8V1G,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 4]","Robert Downey, Jr. dons red armor once again as Tony Stark in this second go-round for Iron Man.  With all of the primary cast returning except for Terence Howard (replaced by Don Cheadle), this sequel opens with Stark living up his superhero life and enjoying the relative world peace that his armor's strength has brought to the planet.  In the public's eye, he uses smart aleck remarks and blistering evidence to fend off the demands of the U.S. government to obtain the technology he used to create his armor.  The government believes that other countries might soon have the same technology and weaponry that Stark created, but Stark insists that enemies are years away from developing such things.  He also brushes off his biggest rival in the weapons market, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), in exceedingly embarassing ways.  Privately, however, the technology that saved him in the first film is slowly killing him now.With his death in sight and no remedy in the foreseeable future, Stark hits the bottle hard, parties it up, and pretty much alienates himself from the woman who cares for him, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his best friend, Rhodey (Cheadle).  S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his ever present co-worker, Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), are also disturbed by Stark's behavior and keep a very close eye on him.Stark appoints Potts as CEO of Stark Industries knowing that she'll be able to maintain the company after he is gone.  He also picks up a new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) to do little more than damage control.Stark begins to take huge risks with his life, including racing in Monaco.  It is here that he first confronts Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a vengeful man who blames Stark's father for the demise of his own father.  Little does Tony know that Vanko not only understands and can utilize the arc reactor technology, but has made what seems to be a better version of it.Soon enough, Vanko joins forces with Justin Hammer and the duo set out to destroy Tony Stark.  Who wins in the end?  Watch ""Iron Man 2"" in order to find out.I loved the first ""Iron Man"" film.  I believe part of the reason I enjoyed it so much was that I really didn't expect it to be such a great film.  As far as comic book films go, it is one of, if not the best, that's come along in a long time.  In the first film, greed and a hunger for power drove Obadiah Stain to want to put an end to Tony Stark.  In the sequel, all Vanko wants to do is destroy Tony Stark in an act of vengeance.  It's a more sinister motive in my opinion.  Granted, Hammer is jealous of Stark and wants his fortune and fame, but he is merely a tool used by Vanko in order to exact his revenge.Pepper Potts takes on a much larger role in this film, attempting to keep Stark from destroying himself and trying to maintain some level of respect for the Stark Industries name.  Rhodey is affected in a similar way, struggling with himself on where his loyalties lie with his friend and his country.Stark's tailspin into oblivion is disturbing to watch on the screen.  He does an excellent job of showing how a man who seemingly has it all can quickly destroy himself.  With that said, Downey also delivers some of the funniest lines in the film, and Rockwell is usually on the receiving end.  The two actors play well against each other and I'd love to see them spar in another film soon.Johansson does a wonderful job in her role as Rushman.  I especially enjoyed her interaction with Jon Favreau, who reprises his role as Happy Hogan.  Paul Bettany returns as the voice of JARVIS, as well as Leslie Bibb in a brief stint as reporter Christine Everhart.Overall, the film is very good.  It's not quite up to par with ""Iron Man,"" but I really didn't expect it to match its predecessor.  At times it felt a bit rushed and there is a brief lag in the film while Stark is trying to get himself back together.  Still, I highly recommend this film.  It brings us one step closer to the heavily anticipated ""Avengers"" film, and sets the table for the upcoming ""Thor"" film next year.  Be sure to watch for a certain Captain's shield to make a swift and funny appearance, a glimpse of a certain green guy's destruction, and a nod to a particularly thunderous hero after the credits roll.",4,"Vengeance, Desperation Drive Iron Sequel",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,4300,"['Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'dons', 'red', 'armor', 'once', 'again', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'second', 'go-round', 'Iron', 'Man', 'primary', 'cast', 'returning', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'replaced', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'sequel', 'Stark', 'living', 'up', 'superhero', 'life', 'enjoying', 'relative', 'world', 'peace', 'armor', 'strength', 'brought', 'planet', 'public', 'eye', 'smart', 'aleck', 'remarks', 'blistering', 'evidence', 'fend', 'off', 'demands', 'U.S.', 'government', 'obtain', 'technology', 'used', 'create', 'armor', 'government', 'other', 'countries', 'might', 'soon', 'have', 'same', 'technology', 'weaponry', 'Stark', 'created', 'Stark', 'enemies', 'are', 'years', 'away', 'developing', 'such', 'things', 'also', 'biggest', 'rival', 'weapons', 'market', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'exceedingly', 'embarassing', 'ways', 'Privately', 'however', 'technology', 'saved', 'first', 'film', 'slowly', 'killing', 'now.With', 'death', 'sight', 'remedy', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'Stark', 'bottle', 'hard', 'parties', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'woman', 'who', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'best', 'friend', 'Rhodey', 'Cheadle', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'agent', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'ever', 'present', 'co-worker', 'Agent', 'Coulson', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'are', 'also', 'disturbed', 'Stark', 'behavior', 'keep', 'very', 'close', 'eye', 'him.Stark', 'appoints', 'Potts', 'CEO', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'maintain', 'company', 'gone', 'also', 'up', 'new', 'assistant', 'Natalie', 'Rushman', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'damage', 'control.Stark', 'take', 'huge', 'risks', 'life', 'including', 'racing', 'Monaco', 'here', 'first', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'vengeful', 'man', 'who', 'Stark', 'father', 'demise', 'own', 'father', 'Little', 'Tony', 'know', 'Vanko', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'utilize', 'arc', 'reactor', 'technology', 'made', 'what', 'be', 'better', 'version', 'it.Soon', 'enough', 'Vanko', 'forces', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'duo', 'set', 'out', 'destroy', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Who', 'end', 'Watch', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'order', 'find', 'out.I', 'loved', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'film', 'believe', 'part', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'go', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'come', 'along', 'long', 'time', 'first', 'film', 'greed', 'hunger', 'power', 'drove', 'Obadiah', 'Stain', 'want', 'put', 'end', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'sequel', 'Vanko', 'do', 'destroy', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'act', 'vengeance', 'more', 'sinister', 'motive', 'opinion', 'Granted', 'Hammer', 'jealous', 'Stark', 'fortune', 'fame', 'merely', 'tool', 'used', 'Vanko', 'order', 'exact', 'revenge.Pepper', 'Potts', 'much', 'larger', 'role', 'film', 'attempting', 'keep', 'Stark', 'destroying', 'trying', 'maintain', 'level', 'respect', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'name', 'Rhodey', 'affected', 'similar', 'way', 'struggling', 'where', 'loyalties', 'lie', 'friend', 'country.Stark', 'tailspin', 'oblivion', 'disturbing', 'watch', 'screen', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'man', 'who', 'seemingly', 'can', 'quickly', 'destroy', 'said', 'Downey', 'also', 'funniest', 'lines', 'film', 'Rockwell', 'usually', 'receiving', 'end', 'two', 'actors', 'play', 'well', 'other', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'spar', 'film', 'soon.Johansson', 'wonderful', 'job', 'role', 'Rushman', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'interaction', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'who', 'role', 'Happy', 'Hogan', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'voice', 'JARVIS', 'as', 'well', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'brief', 'stint', 'reporter', 'Christine', 'Everhart.Overall', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'Iron', 'Man', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'match', 'predecessor', 'times', 'felt', 'bit', 'rushed', 'brief', 'lag', 'film', 'Stark', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'heavily', 'anticipated', 'Avengers', 'film', 'table', 'upcoming', 'Thor', 'film', 'next', 'year', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'certain', 'Captain', 'shield', 'make', 'swift', 'funny', 'appearance', 'glimpse', 'certain', 'green', 'guy', 'destruction', 'nod', 'particularly', 'thunderous', 'hero', 'credits', 'roll']",N/A

1248150,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B0021L8V1G,K. Ostrowski,"[4, 13]","This is easily one of the worst superhero films I've seen in my life.I love superheros, because they're tough guys (and girls) who try to do the right thing, no matter what.  They do mess up sometimes (like Spider-man did in the second movie,) but soon they're back on their feet, sobered and ready to make their commitment again.I have to admit, this is what I liked most about the first Iron Man movie.  I found flaws in it, but Tony's commitment to getting the job done and making amends for some of his past sins made the film a likable experience overall, even though the main character still has a lot of problems which he's yet to overcome.This film contains none of the atonement plot of the first.  Instead, Tony Stark, whose identity as Iron Man is now public knowledge, dances, sings, brags, drives fast cars, womanizes, gets drunk, tells bad jokes, gets sick, gets in trouble, has a brief falling-out with one of his friends, and generally makes himself a nuisance.  The character (an irritant in the first film) comes across as merely a spoiled, hyperactive man-child in this movie, and no real consequences are brought against him for it.  He's given what he needs to solve his problems, he solves his problems, and can go back to being a jerk.  Hooray?Probably the worst aspect of the film, however, are the villains.  There are two; a lousy, jealous weapons designer named Justin Hammer, who's even more hyper, spoiled and pop-culture-infused than the title character is, and a psychotic thug/mad scientist named Ivan Vanko, who never displays any dimensions to his character other than ""be evil,"" while paradoxically and insultingly wearing a cross and carrying what looks like a rosary.  Right.  As if I didn't have enough reasons to hate this film.Come to think of it, the two-villain MO; one a goofy, silly wisecracker, the other a power-mad psychopath, reminds me unpleasantly of Batman Forever.The main plot of this movie is a lot skinnier than in the past.  Evil bad guy has technology.  Evil bad guy attacks.  Evil bad guy loses.  The end.To compensate for this, they stick in about four subplots.  The first is about the government wanting to take control of Iron Man.  The second is about Tony getting close to death from the chemical in the battery he's been using for his Iron Man armor.  The third involves Shield keeping an eye on him.  Spoilers; none of these first three subplots goes anywhere.That brings us to subplot 4; the war machine armor being stolen by Tony's friend when he realizes that Tony is too big of a jerk to leave in sole possession of it.  This subplot goes somewhere, but only in terms of helping to set up a team-up between Iron Man and War Machine near the end of the film; a hero/sidekick team-up, which is reminiscent, again, of Batman Forever.I didn't mind the first film so much, in spite of its shallow villain, jerky main character and so forth, but this film really has nothing to offer.  Its weak points are just as weak as in the original, and the strengths of the first film are gone.  On top of that, it has a bunch of additional flaws and insulting lines and references that bring it down even more.  About the only good thing I can say about it is that it introduces the character of Black Widow, but even this is only of interest to people who know about the character already.

I do feel compared to the first it was only slight inferior, but otherwise it was still enjoyable to watch. I added this to my ""Pre-Avengers Collection"" with much anticipation. Even though I liked the movie it wasn't without its flaws. Some things in the story wasn't well resolved and the running gag with Stark and the Senator, while entertaining, was a bit unnecessary in my humble opinion. The movie really picked up when Rhodey donned the armor. I enjoyed him having a more important role in the film.Another gripe I have is I think Jon Favreau made himself involved in the movie more than he should have.

Justin Theroux's script was well written and the visual effects were astounding. Stay after the credits for a lead in to another of the Marvel Universe movies.The plot was decent. Tony Stark needs to find another element than palladium to keep him alive. The palladium in his chest piece that was keeping him alive and the shrapnel from entering his heart is slowing killing him. He hands over the company to Pepper Potts to run while he works on a way to cure his problem. He is also convinced his is going to die. Ivan Vanko, a Russian physicist previously imprisoned in Russia for selling Russian secrets, builds the Whiplash outfit to seek revenge against the Starks. Howard Stark, Tony's father, fired Ivan's father Anton and sent him back to Russia to live in exile and thus Ivan has a serious revenge issue with the Starks. Ivan goes after Tony at the Grand Prix in Monaco and destroys Tony's race car on the track and tries to kill him. Ivan is taken to prison for life in Monaco. At his birthday party, he gets drunk and destroys his house. Rhodey puts on the War Machine suit to counteract Iron Man into calming down, but they end up fighting each other and destroying Tony's house. Justin Hammer, Tony Stark's old friend and rival defense weapons dealer/manufacturer, breaks Vanko out of prison and enlists his help to build a drone army for the military with technology that rivals Iron Man's technology. Of course, the drone army is controlled by Vanko and thus goes after Iron Man. Iron Man has to team up with Rhodey's War Machine again to fight off the drones and Vanko. Natalie Rushman (aka Natalie Romanov and the Black Widow) is Pepper Potts' replacement and is under cover at Stark Industries. She evaluates Tony Stark's personality and behavior for S.H.I.E.LD. and recommends that he does not join them. Nick Fury appears and interviews Tony Stark for the Avengers Initiative. He gives Tony a copy of Natalie's report and recommends that he be a consultant only to S.H.I.E.L.D.The visual effects were better than the first movie.

Since BD tech is relatively new, not all of my friends or family have BD players yet, so being able to bring my DVD to their houses, while being able to enjoy the full 1080p at home, is a definite plus.  The ""Digital Copy"" is not so thrilling (the reason for the loss of the 1 star).  I have multiple BD's with digital copies, and I have not had a good experience with one yet, so I don't even bother anymore.  I'll just continue to watch my movies the old fashioned way until they finally do away with it (the ridiculous DRM or discs all together - the more likely scenario).  I now understand why movie pirating is becoming so proliferant; it's almost as if they would rather you downloaded an illegal copy then get to actually enjoy the one you paid for!Things to consider when buying this 3-disc combo is that if you don't have a BD player yet, but plan to buy one and really want Iron Man 2 NOW, you can't go wrong.  If you probably won't buy a BD player, I would get the DVD alone instead (if they offer it, that is).  And if you already have a BD Player, and think the DVD is just a waste: maybe it is, but then again, maybe it isn't if you think about all of the people you know that don't have BD players and might want to borrow your movie, or have you come over to watch it with them.  And you can play the DVD in pretty much 99% of all laptops; so the DVD is a bit more flexible than the BD.There is also a lot of extra content packed into this deal, some 3+ hours of it.  If you like all of this extra stuff, then that's just gravy on top of an already pretty sweet combo deal (assuming you enjoy gravy on your sweets).Overall, for the great deal that I feel I got on this combo, it was well worth it and I have plenty of bonus material to keep me busy should I choose.",4,"Blu Ray Bundle review, NOT Iron Man 2 review.",1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,2008,"['Just', 'clarification', 'am', 'reviewing', '3', 'disc', 'combo', 'not', 'necessarily', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'good.I', 'studios', 'are', 'making', 'bigger', 'releases', 'available', '3', 'disc', 'combos', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'exception', 'BD', 'tech', 'relatively', 'new', 'not', 'friends', 'family', 'have', 'BD', 'players', 'yet', 'being', 'able', 'bring', 'DVD', 'houses', 'being', 'able', 'enjoy', 'full', '1080p', 'home', 'definite', 'plus', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'not', 'so', 'thrilling', 'reason', 'loss', '1', 'star', 'have', 'multiple', 'BD', 'digital', 'copies', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'good', 'experience', 'one', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'anymore', ""'ll"", 'just', 'continue', 'watch', 'movies', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way', 'finally', 'do', 'away', 'ridiculous', 'DRM', 'discs', 'together', 'more', 'likely', 'scenario', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'pirating', 'becoming', 'so', 'proliferant', 'almost', 'would', 'rather', 'downloaded', 'illegal', 'copy', 'then', 'get', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'one', 'paid', 'Things', 'consider', 'when', 'buying', '3-disc', 'combo', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'BD', 'player', 'yet', 'plan', 'buy', 'one', 'really', 'want', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'NOW', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'BD', 'player', 'would', 'get', 'DVD', 'alone', 'instead', 'offer', 'already', 'have', 'BD', 'Player', 'think', 'DVD', 'just', 'waste', 'maybe', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'BD', 'players', 'might', 'want', 'borrow', 'movie', 'have', 'come', 'watch', 'can', 'play', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', '99', '%', 'laptops', 'so', 'DVD', 'bit', 'more', 'flexible', 'BD.There', 'also', 'lot', 'extra', 'content', 'packed', 'deal', '3+', 'hours', 'like', 'extra', 'stuff', 'then', 'just', 'gravy', 'top', 'already', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'combo', 'deal', 'assuming', 'enjoy', 'gravy', 'sweets', '.Overall', 'great', 'deal', 'feel', 'got', 'combo', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'have', 'plenty', 'bonus', 'material', 'keep', 'busy', 'should', 'choose']",N/A

1248180,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B0021L8V1G,maskedgamer,"[0, 1]","A movie titled Iron-man but the villain steals the show. Growing up I never was that big a fan of Iron Man I always a fan of Batman and this movie made me realize why. Tony Stark is a superhero that enjoys his fortune lives lavishly and he's not afraid to let the world know it. Batman puts up the front of living lavishly and enjoying his life while underneath it all he's tormented and if he can't find peace for himself he'll find peace for someone else by becoming ""Batman"" and help keep the people safe in his city. The two Billionaires are complete opposites of each other. Even their corporations are complete opposites. Wayne industries focuses on improving the world while Stark industries focuses on how to destroy it. It's a very interesting way to look at the two successful comic book characters. Matter of fact the only thing that they have in common is that they are both just normal men with no true superpowers of their own (well maybe a huge bank account is a super power).About the movie now...Iron Man 2 reversed the roles. This movie actually make Iron Man look like the a-hole because of how he acts in the movie. He treats Iron man as though it's a symbol of just how big his ego is and just another reason why the world should bow down and kiss his feet. Tony Stark in this movie is not exactly the character you want to root for. It's basically 2 hours of a rich man's ego trip. ""I can do what I want because I'm rich and you should be thanking me"". That is pretty much all I get from these Iron man movies especially this one.The Iron man scenes are just as great as the first one. The suit of armor never looked better and the scenes are intense. I was however disappointed with WarMachine. He was a character that they could have done a lot more with and perhaps given more spot light too than just a sub plot to further advance the story line. I also had a problem with the actor they casted as Warmachine. He couldn't be further off from being Warmachine, and he never sold me on him. I know they were originally supposed to have Terrance Howard and they should have got him for the role. He's an A-list actor and they should have paid his A-list salary. Because Don Cheadle is no WarMachine.The one who made this movie worth watching for me was Mickey Rourke. His character is the one the movie makes you root for and to be honest he brought up valid points that no one seemed to answer and a question that Tony Starks pretended was never asked. Tony Starks deals in weapons...those weapons fall in the hands of solders...his weapons take lives and destroy countries, and Mickey Rourke's character was the ending result of that. Tony Starks weapons destroy his homeland, and Tony Starks father ruined his father personally. Ivan Vanko didn't seem so bent on getting revenge out of personal hatred as he seemed to want to make Tony Starks suffer for all the pain his weapons have caused... actually it was a pretty valid point.. but the movie just skipped over all that and made him the bad guy.Overall Iron Man 2 was a good action flick if you liked Iron Man 1 You'll enjoy Iron Man 2. 4/5 for a sequel since there hasn't been a good sequel since T2 and Batman The Darknight.

1248181,A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q,B0021L8V1G,MasterAP,"[0, 0]","With this review of Iron Man 2, I have seen the film twice in theaters.The sequel is following in the steps of recent blockbuster sequels in that it has so many storylines to follow. (even though the director mentioned they wanted to keep things simple)While not as complex as Batman Begins, Iron Man 2 is full of new characters and actions scenes. The additional action scenes are a warm welcome to the lack from the first film while some of the new characters were a painful need.Robert Downey Jr returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man. With fame all around, Stark must deal with his mortality as the power source in his chest is slowly poisoning him to death.Don Cheadle fills in as Col. Rhodes. I like this actor switch. Cheadle brings a weight that ""that other guy"" missed. In this film, we get to see War Machine in his full glory: guns blazing and heavy duty explosions.Scarlett Johansson star as Black Widow even though they never use this name in the film. She is part of SHIELD and is tasked with keeping an eye on Stark. She has a dizzying fight scene near the end of the film.In fact, if the entire movie had the thrill of the last few minutes, this movie would be truly epic.Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts and is given the job as Stark Industry CEO. The quick banter between Potts and Stark returns but their chemistry is on the short side (once again victim of too many new characters)Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's main business rival. I suppose you could call him a villain but he just wanted to be the country's main source of weapons. I think there was too much Rockwell in this movie...too much not-funny Rockwell.Mickey Rourke is the main villain in Iron Man 2. He's on a vengeance kick against Stark because of some bad family blood with their respected fathers. I still don't get why this guy is seen as such a good actor.Samuel L Jackson returns as Nick Fury. At this point every character is Jackson regardless of the character's name.

1248182,A1EX4410F46C8O,B0021L8V1G,"Matt32 ""LIGHT WEIGHT""","[1, 2]","I felt that they slacked on the first Iron Man, slacked, but all in all it was very entertaining and quite enjoyable (Hey, at least it wasn't Spider Man 3)  Iron Man 2 however, it just sad.  Its really awful.  I'm going to try to break it down as simply as I can.1- Tony Stark is played by an incredible actor.  Robert Downey Jr. is an example of how poor writers can just ruin a movie no matter who is in the cast.  Tony is supposed to be an arogant, witty, quick-tongued, cocky guy, but Iron Man 2 is just one lousy attempt at a one-liner.  Nothing made me laugh.  The script should be burned, buried, and forgotten.  Stark was never meant to sound like a washed up, smart @$$ stand-up wannabe.2- The title should have been The Avengers feat. Iron Man.  I truly want to see something develop out of all this Avengers hype, but my lord.  The world is in perile, Tony's body is poisoning itself to death, but every 3 seconds Nick Fury comes running up with a contract ""Tony please sign here, sign here!""  Just too much of it in this movie.3- Plot needs to get original now.  Just as in Iron Man 1, Tony is having some kind of grave problem with his technology, he is trying to create some magical solution, someone has stolen his technology, found a weakness and is now using it against him.  Exact same plot basically across both movies.  For half this movie Tony is in his lab trying to create a new element! Not fighting crime, but getting drunk and making elements...4- Speaking of the drunk.  The scene where Stark and James Rhodes (War Machine) fight it out in Tony's house while Tony is drunk and just completely destroying what little shred of respect I had left for this movie, stops everything dead.  The scene is horrible, the music is atrocious, I could have lived without it.  At least War Machine was around though, somebody had to do work.5- This is one of the biggest let downs I had with the movie, minor and stupid yes but a let down.  Ivan Vanko (Rourke) is working to create an army of ""Iron Men"".  At the beginning of the movie he is seen with a cockatiel bird on his shoulder.  When asked by his partners if he needs anything to help him work Ivan replies that he wants his ""bird"".  They get him a bird and he is EXTREMELY upset that it wasn't his actual, personal bird.  I thought AHHH the bird remembers all the Stark Technology plans and he needs it to finish his work! Genius!  Nope, not the case...he just wants his bird. Was there nothing better to anger Whiplash with?! Is he going around slappin race cars left and right because he lost his bird?! Get real...I would have died a happier man had that been left out.On the upside (if there is one), Iron Man 2 is visually stunning!  If you would like to see IMO a movie that has set a new standard for effects and filming this is it.  A baboon could have directed a better movie, but at least they made garbage look incredible.  You also have Rourke who plays a great villian.  I'm really pleased with his role.  Some people say he doesn't have enough lines but I think that is what adds to his character so much.  Awesome job, two thumbs up!  You get to see some of Black Widow too, at least someone was a good superhero.I wouldn't waste my money. Netflix, rent, whatever.  Don't buy.  I know a few people who liked the movie, but I honestly think they just hadn't been watching movies lately and wanted to see something.  Maybe little kids would think this was soooo awesome, I just can't see the good in it.",2,Just pathetic...,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,3488,"['felt', 'slacked', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'slacked', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Hey', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'Spider', 'Man', '3', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'however', 'just', 'sad', 'really', 'awful', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'break', 'down', 'as', 'simply', 'can.1-', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'played', 'incredible', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'example', 'how', 'poor', 'writers', 'can', 'just', 'ruin', 'movie', 'matter', 'who', 'cast', 'Tony', 'supposed', 'be', 'arogant', 'witty', 'quick-tongued', 'cocky', 'guy', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'just', 'one', 'lousy', 'attempt', 'one-liner', 'Nothing', 'made', 'laugh', 'script', 'should', 'be', 'burned', 'buried', 'forgotten', 'Stark', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'sound', 'washed', 'up', 'smart', '@', 'stand-up', 'wannabe.2-', 'title', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Avengers', 'feat', 'Iron', 'Man', 'truly', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'develop', 'Avengers', 'hype', 'lord', 'world', 'perile', 'Tony', 'body', 'poisoning', 'death', '3', 'seconds', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'running', 'up', 'contract', 'Tony', 'please', 'sign', 'here', 'sign', 'here', 'Just', 'too', 'much', 'movie.3-', 'Plot', 'get', 'original', 'now', 'Just', 'Iron', 'Man', '1', 'Tony', 'having', 'kind', 'grave', 'problem', 'technology', 'trying', 'create', 'magical', 'solution', 'someone', 'stolen', 'technology', 'found', 'weakness', 'now', 'using', 'Exact', 'same', 'plot', 'basically', 'movies', 'movie', 'Tony', 'lab', 'trying', 'create', 'new', 'element', 'Not', 'fighting', 'crime', 'getting', 'drunk', 'making', 'elements', '4-', 'Speaking', 'drunk', 'scene', 'where', 'Stark', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'War', 'Machine', 'fight', 'out', 'Tony', 'house', 'Tony', 'drunk', 'just', 'completely', 'destroying', 'what', 'little', 'shred', 'respect', 'had', 'left', 'movie', 'everything', 'dead', 'scene', 'horrible', 'music', 'atrocious', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'least', 'War', 'Machine', 'was', 'somebody', 'had', 'do', 'work.5-', 'one', 'biggest', 'let', 'downs', 'had', 'movie', 'minor', 'stupid', 'yes', 'let', 'down', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Rourke', 'working', 'create', 'army', 'Iron', 'Men', 'beginning', 'movie', 'seen', 'cockatiel', 'bird', 'shoulder', 'When', 'asked', 'partners', 'anything', 'help', 'work', 'Ivan', 'replies', 'bird', 'get', 'bird', 'EXTREMELY', 'was', ""n't"", 'actual', 'personal', 'bird', 'thought', 'AHHH', 'bird', 'remembers', 'Stark', 'Technology', 'plans', 'finish', 'work', 'Genius', 'Nope', 'not', 'case', 'just', 'bird', 'Was', 'nothing', 'better', 'anger', 'Whiplash', 'going', 'slappin', 'race', 'cars', 'left', 'right', 'lost', 'bird', 'Get', 'real', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'happier', 'man', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'out.On', 'upside', 'one', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'visually', 'stunning', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'IMO', 'movie', 'set', 'new', 'standard', 'effects', 'filming', 'baboon', 'could', 'have', 'directed', 'better', 'movie', 'least', 'made', 'garbage', 'look', 'incredible', 'also', 'have', 'Rourke', 'who', 'great', 'villian', ""'m"", 'really', 'pleased', 'role', 'people', 'say', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'lines', 'think', 'what', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'Awesome', 'job', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'get', 'see', 'Black', 'Widow', 'too', 'least', 'someone', 'was', 'good', 'superhero.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'Netflix', 'rent', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'movie', 'honestly', 'think', 'just', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'watching', 'movies', 'lately', 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'Maybe', 'little', 'kids', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'soooo', 'awesome', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'good']",N/A

When I went to see it soon after its release this past summer, I was initially somewhat disappointed.  The first Iron Man got so much right - a good, consistent storyline with amazing effects and a spot-on portrayal of a flawed, egotistical human being finding some sort of redemption through becoming a super hero.  But I would have to agree with many reviewers who felt that Iron Man 2 was incomplete and rushed.  I still enjoyed RDJ's characterization of Tony Stark and I liked the interplay between Stark and Pepper Potts, but I felt that Don Cheadle's character was wasted and frankly, Mikey Rourke's Russian gangster/ physicist felt out of place.  Plus (spoiler) when he first arrives at the race track early in the film, destroying cars, wreaking havoc - how hard would it have been for someone to shoot that guy?  He had no armor!  Anyway - it's a comic movie, so I don't expect too much logic.  Regardless, on later viewings, I find myself enjoying the film more as a popcorn movie, but hopefully the upcoming Marvel films and the Avengers movie will be have more of the feel of the first Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk (which I really liked) or X-Men 2 than Iron Man 2.",3,Disappointing but entertaining sequel,1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,1236,"['could', 'give', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', '3', '1/2', 'star', 'review', 'would', 'When', 'went', 'see', 'soon', 'release', 'past', 'summer', 'was', 'initially', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'right', 'good', 'consistent', 'storyline', 'amazing', 'effects', 'spot-on', 'portrayal', 'flawed', 'egotistical', 'human', 'being', 'finding', 'sort', 'redemption', 'becoming', 'super', 'hero', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'who', 'felt', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'was', 'incomplete', 'rushed', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'RDJ', 'characterization', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'liked', 'interplay', 'Stark', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'felt', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'was', 'wasted', 'frankly', 'Mikey', 'Rourke', 'Russian', 'gangster/', 'physicist', 'felt', 'place', 'spoiler', 'when', 'first', 'race', 'track', 'early', 'film', 'destroying', 'cars', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'how', 'hard', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'shoot', 'guy', 'had', 'armor', 'Anyway', 'comic', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'logic', 'Regardless', 'later', 'viewings', 'find', 'enjoying', 'film', 'more', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'hopefully', 'upcoming', 'Marvel', 'films', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'have', 'more', 'feel', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'really', 'liked', '2', 'Iron', 'Man', '2']",N/A

Still, I'm going to try and be as honest as I possibly can.  In some ways, Iron Man 2 improves on the original.  For instance, the brawl between Iron Man and War Machine was perfect, and RDJr was even better this time around.  However, there were some weak moments.  For example, Pepper Potts is almost absent from the movie, and is shrill and unpleasant during her brief appearances. Whiplash has never been a particularly compelling villain, and the movie doesn't do much to make him any more exciting.  Also, they really need to STOP with the ""Iron Man fights someone who has the same technology"" plots.  It's already boring.  Plus, I couldn't help but wonder where a drunken hobo managed to get the equipment to build an Arc Reactor. Stark did it in the first movie because he had several billion dollars worth of his own weaponry to cannibalize. How does a homeless Russian manage it?  Furthermore, the character of Justin Hammer was silly and played for laughs, which was the wrong move.  It had a real ""Jim Carrey in Batman Forever"" vibe to it.Others have mentioned the unnecessary plot lines, and they're right.  We could have done entirely without the ""Paladium Poisoning"" and the ""Under House Arrest by SHIELD"" plots, since neither of them really went anywhere, and felt like padding in a movie that didn't need any.  I didn't mind the Black Widow showing up, but eventually it felt like we were tripping over minor characters.  Also, they're not fooling anyone with the whole ""The Avengers don't want Tony Stark"" subplot.  None of us believe for a moment that they'd do an Avengers movie without the only Avenger that's proven to be a box-office success.Still, it was a good movie.  Perhaps not a GREAT movie like the first one, but at least it wasn't a franchise-killing fiasco like Spiderman 3 or Batman and Robin.  Honestly, if none of us had ever seen the original Iron Man, we'd all be talking about how this movie was one of the best Comic Book movies ever.

Burks ""The Farmin' Jedi""","[1, 1]","I won't spend too much time on the film, as most of you who are thinking of buying this blu-ray have already seen it, but here goes; The original Iron Man was a very fun ride thanks mainly to the absolutely perfect casting of Robert Downey Jr., as he essentially IS/WAS the bad boy that Tony Stark IS/WAS.  The script was fun, the effects were awesome, and while a bit by the numbers the movie had the huge benefit of the fact that Iron Man was (at the time) essentially a ""B List"" character in the Marvel Universe and no one really expected much out of the movie.  Now Iron Man 2 has the unenviable job of following up on the momentum started in part one, but for the most part pulls it off rather well.  Mickey Rourke spouts ominous lines about blood and sharks and what-not that could come off as silly except he's actually making a very true point that once you show that God (or in this case Iron Man) is mortal and can in fact be hurt people will no longer worship him.  Rourke delivers a fun performance with the only gripe being that I wish he was a little more fleshed out, as he really does have a reason to hate Tony Stark and the character could have been a little less one dimensional.  This is a script fault though, nothing to do with Rourke, as he makes the character work.  Sam Jackson is at times a bit too Pulp Fiction-ish in his delivery but for the most part is an awesome Nick Fury.  Paltrow delivers her usual good performance despite having to once again be the damsel in distress, and Scarlett J. is a wonderful Black Widow (who's true super power seems to be gorgeous self curling hair in battle scenes?).  Downey is Downey, he IS Tony Stark, and minus a couple times of going a bit overkill he is awesome.  A good movie, lots of Avengers set up, with an ending that's a bit rushed but overall ok.Now to the actual blu-ray.  AWESOME!!  Tons of content, a director's commentary that's actually fun AND informative, and tight packaging.  As an added plus, the digital copy that every blockbuster has to have so they can add a ""3 DISCS!"" to the cover also contains a DVD copy of the film, a concept a truly wish all studios would adapt.

Something obviously changed his mind, and he made a great, and very entertaining movie, just shy of the greatness of the first.  The thing that keeps Iron Man 2 bogged down from classic is too many plots.  In this movie there's a plot about Tony Stark dying, Whiplash Seeking revenge, Justin Hammer trying to out do Tony Stark, the Army wanting access to the Iron Man technology, Tony's dad issues, Tony and Pepper's relationship, and more avengers subplots.  It's not necessarily a bad thing to have a complicated movie, but many of the stories feel a little rushed, and weighed down by all the others.  However, getting past the many plots there is a plethora of reason to be entertained.  The action was pretty great, from the battle on the race track to final showdown.  The special effects are good as ever, and Robert Downey jr. really makes the character of tony stark shine in a way that he never did in the comic books, both by being likeable, as well as having depth.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","The sequel to Iron Man promised to be an entirely different movie because it took the standard trope - playboy superhero trying to lead a double life - and turned it on its ear by having Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity to the world. Iron Man is the Batman of the Marvel universe, so you can imagine the implications of a billionaire with an arsenal of firepower at his fingertips.  The government, for one, is extremely nervous about a private enterprise waging wars in foreign countries - a topical concern in today's world of ""security firms"" operating in America's wars. Shareholders, for another, fret that the often intoxicated Stark is such a warped genius that he will self-destruct ala Charlie Sheen.Iron Man 2 is further complicated by aggrieved Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) codenamed Whiplash, who teams up with Steve Jobs-like Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a second stringer defense contractor.  To make matters worse, Stark's palladium core - the miniature reactor in his chest - is poisoning him.  The world has it out for Mr. Stark.There are several plot points that Iron Man 2 struggles to juggle simultaneously: the leadership of Stark Industries, the government's demands for the Iron Man plans, Stark's romance with his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his past relationship with his deceased father (a genius in the Walt Disney mold who built his own World's Fair-like Stark Expo), his looming death, his battle with alcoholism, and his rivalry with a competitor (Hammer) and the son of the original developer of a similar suit (Vanko).  And oh yeah, there's a little matter of the Avengers trying Stark out for membership.There's so much going on that inevitably some of these plot points suffer.  Stark's romance with Potts is more implied than acted, his alcoholism is played up for laughs, and both villains are poorly realized in comparison to the other people in Starks' orbit.  Rockwell, in particular, comes off as an incompetent boob incapable of actually leading a company much less rivaling Stark. Vanko, on the other hand, has such a dangerous presence that it's hard to believe he's both a brilliant scientist AND a bird-loving, whip-wielding thug.When Iron Man does bust loose though, it rocks.  War Machine is a welcome sight, and the conflict between Stark and Vanko in the middle of the Circuit de Monaco is thrilling. The fight scenes are exciting, more akin to jet fighters in flight than human-sized tanks.Iron Man 2 doesn't have the emotional heft of its predecessor - it's far too busy to worry about peoples' feelings - but it does pack a solid punch.",4,"More Iron, Less Man",1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,2656,"['sequel', 'Iron', 'Man', 'promised', 'be', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'took', 'standard', 'trope', 'playboy', 'superhero', 'trying', 'lead', 'double', 'life', 'turned', 'ear', 'having', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'revealing', 'secret', 'identity', 'world', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Batman', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'can', 'imagine', 'implications', 'billionaire', 'arsenal', 'firepower', 'fingertips', 'government', 'one', 'extremely', 'nervous', 'private', 'enterprise', 'waging', 'wars', 'foreign', 'countries', 'topical', 'concern', 'today', 'world', 'security', 'firms', 'operating', 'America', 'wars', 'Shareholders', 'fret', 'often', 'intoxicated', 'Stark', 'such', 'warped', 'genius', 'will', 'self-destruct', 'ala', 'Charlie', 'Sheen.Iron', 'Man', '2', 'further', 'complicated', 'aggrieved', 'Russian', 'scientist', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'codenamed', 'Whiplash', 'who', 'up', 'Steve', 'Jobs-like', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'second', 'stringer', 'defense', 'contractor', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Stark', 'palladium', 'core', 'miniature', 'reactor', 'chest', 'poisoning', 'world', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Stark.There', 'are', 'several', 'plot', 'points', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'struggles', 'juggle', 'simultaneously', 'leadership', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'government', 'demands', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Stark', 'romance', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'past', 'relationship', 'deceased', 'father', 'genius', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'mold', 'who', 'built', 'own', 'World', 'Fair-like', 'Stark', 'Expo', 'looming', 'death', 'battle', 'alcoholism', 'rivalry', 'competitor', 'Hammer', 'son', 'original', 'developer', 'similar', 'suit', 'Vanko', 'oh', 'yeah', 'little', 'matter', 'Avengers', 'trying', 'Stark', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'inevitably', 'plot', 'points', 'suffer', 'Stark', 'romance', 'Potts', 'more', 'implied', 'acted', 'alcoholism', 'played', 'up', 'laughs', 'villains', 'are', 'poorly', 'realized', 'comparison', 'other', 'people', 'Starks', 'orbit', 'Rockwell', 'particular', 'off', 'incompetent', 'boob', 'incapable', 'actually', 'leading', 'company', 'much', 'less', 'rivaling', 'Stark', 'Vanko', 'other', 'hand', 'dangerous', 'presence', 'hard', 'believe', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'bird-loving', 'whip-wielding', 'thug.When', 'Iron', 'Man', 'bust', 'loose', 'War', 'Machine', 'welcome', 'sight', 'conflict', 'Stark', 'Vanko', 'middle', 'Circuit', 'de', 'Monaco', 'thrilling', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'more', 'akin', 'jet', 'fighters', 'flight', 'human-sized', 'tanks.Iron', 'Man', '2', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'heft', 'predecessor', 'far', 'too', 'busy', 'worry', 'peoples', 'feelings', 'pack', 'solid', 'punch']",N/A

1248197,AO65T0JON8R80,B0021L8V1G,Michele Lyons,"[10, 25]","Is there anybody but me out there that found this movie utterly ridiculous?  Downey brings good acting and character, both ecentric and charming, which is about the only good thing I have to say about this nonsense.  Did anybody on the crew that made this movie actually read any of the original Iron Man comics? Did anybody read the stories, the history, the character background, etc?  Apparently not, because aside from taking the names from the original comic, nothing about the movie matches.  In this movie, Stark makes it clearly known that he is Iron Man, while in the comic series, he went to incredible lengths to prevent just that; not the least reason of which is that it would cause many of the same problems played for gags in this film. The movie is mostly action, of the type that appeals mostly to adolescent boys, where there is a lot of shooting and blowing up and crashing, together with a heavy dose of sexy women clad in skin tight outfits.  If anyone is interested in a plot, the nearest thing they come to is that Stark's iron man suit is stolen and copied. In the original comic series, it was very clearly stated that Stark had taken all kinds of precautions to prevent just that.  All recorded plans, all copies of the iron man suit, had multiple mistakes and booby traps built in to prevent anyone but Stark from making a working copy of the iron suit. So even if something was stolen, it would not do the thieves any good. Any copies made would malfuction in a variety of ways, or even blow up.  I kept waiting for such fail safe booby traps to be triggered as the military played with the iron man suit, but apparently the Tony Stark in this movie was not as brilliant as the one in the comic.  Apparently it never occured to him that someone would try to steal his work, and that he needed to take steps, not only to prevent the theft, but to render the stolen items useless to the thieves.  And Whiplash, who is the arch villian in this movie----laughable.  He appears, heavily armed to be sure, but also with his entire head, neck and upper torso naked and exposed.  Any cop, any security guard, with a gun and a good aim could have put a bullet between his eyes and ended the entire episode.  And shall we mention the betrayal of Stark's best friend, Rourke? What else do you call it when Rourke, never once trying to really find out what was wrong with his friend, marches in, orders Stark around, then beats him half to death, destroys his house, steals his life's work and completely betrays any idea of friendship.  The fact that he had ""orders"" was a piss-poor reason, in anyone's book.  And I cannot imagine Stark's attitude of ""forgive and forget"" at the end of the movie.  And Rourke gets an award at the end of the movie? For what? Betrayal of a dying friend, playing into the hands of a dangerous villian, stealing a friend's life's work, violating several dozen laws and endangering civilians, or generally being an ass?  And anybody who thinks that this movie's portrayal of Nick Fury of Shield is in any way accurate, did not read the same comics I did. And did everybody catch the finding of Thor's hammer lying in the desert after the final credits?  A set up for the coming Thor movie, one in which the makers probably did not read any of the Thor comics either.  If you are a young teenager, you will find Iron Man II entertaining.

1248201,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0021L8V1G,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","I thought that the first Iron Man was great.  Struck all the right chords, no unnecessary plot points and great acting all around.  While I think the sequel is solid, there was a bit of a letdown (as there usually is with sequels to superhero movies) from the original.  To be fair, there is a lot going on.  The movie was trying to tell a separate Iron Man story, while also setting up the eventual Avengers movie, and setting up Thor and to some extent Captain America.I think the two new villains in the film worked well. Sam Rockwell playing Hammer who is a competitor of Stark, but who cannot do anything as well as Stark.  He was kind of over the top with goofy eccentricity as opposed to Stark's cocky eccentricity.  Whiplash played very well by Micky Rourke plays more of a silent but deadly character who has his own agenda to take down Stark that ties in family rivalry and revenge.  The only drawback is that his character spends a lot of time not involved in any action.The Avengers tie in introduces Black Widow (played by Scarlet Johansson), and expanded roles for Nick Fury and agent Coulson.  While I though the whole evaluation of Stark and whether he should be included in the Avengers was somewhat unnecessary (because it was well known that he was going to be in the group), it was as good a way as any to expand into that world.I think the one plot point they could have done without was the blood poisoning from the arc reactor in his chest thing.  There was enough else going on that if it was taken out the movie would have probably flowed a little better.  It did not grind the movie to a halt though, so it is just a minor point.I also think Don Cheadle did a great job taking over the role as Rhodes.  While I am usually not a fan of just replacing out actors in these kind of movie series (the continuity is part of what keeps the audience engaged), I just think he was more suited for the role.  I would have been fine keeping Terrance Howard in, but I think Cheadle would have been better from the outset.Like all superhero movies, whether you like this or not will be largely subjective.

1248205,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0021L8V1G,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""Iron Man 2"" finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), billionaire owner of Stark Industries, very much out of the closet as Iron Man. He's enjoying the notoriety that superhero status has given him, gloating about all he has done for humankind in the past few years. Actually, his behavior seems out of control, and personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is increasingly frustrated by Tony's self-destructive antics. Little does she know that the palladium core of the arc reactor Tony wears is slowly killing him. Meanwhile, the US government is demanding that Stark turn over his Iron Man suits to the Defense Department. And a new rival, Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is building his own arc reactor to avenge an old score.The ""Iron Man"" franchise continues to distinguish itself from other films based on Marvel Comics characters with its sense of humor. These are action-comedies that, perhaps ironically, also have the strongest socio-political subtexts. Leave it to Robert Downey, Jr. to play crazy, funny, and heroic at the same time. Sam Rockwell is an inspired, not necessarily obvious, choice to play Stark's arch-rival in business Justin Hammer, CEO of a rival defense contractor. Director Jon Favreau has done a great job with the visuals and managed to find the right tone as the film vacillates between high-octane action and slightly hammy comedy. ""Iron Man 2"" isn't as strong as 2008's ""Iron Man"", partly because introducing the SHIELD organization into the mix creates too many characters.I'm not a reader of comic books, so the introduction of characters from other storylines seems odd to me. I understand that comic books do this a lot, but it can be problematic in a 2-hour film, where maintaining focus among a change of CEOs at Stark Industries, a sinister plot involving a Russian scientist and rival businessman, a crusading senator, a military friend who may be foe, a drunken and desperate hero, and a lot of explosions already presents a challenge. Scarlett Johanssen is probably fine as SHIELD babe Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff, but I can't say that her action scenes were convincing. Other than that, ""Iron Man 2"" is a lot of fun and is happy to be over-the-top in everything it does. And its sly jabs at the defense industry are pretty funny.The DVD (Paramount 2010 single disc edition): The single disc offers an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau. He talks a lot about his decisions, what he chose to do or not to do and why, the reason for the sequence at the beginning of the film, themes, what was included or had to be left out. It's a good commentary if you're interested in directorial decisions or cutting. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.

Everything that made the first film good is nearly gone from this film. The first Iron Man got praise for being not just a good superhero film, but also as a good character study. So this film had a lot to live up to. While I believe that the creators tried to make something good, I felt that they tried to hard.They tried to give Tony Stark an interesting character arc like the first film did. However, how he reacts and the situations he gets hinself into kind've sours his development from the first film. I find in hard to believe that Tony gets of scot free at the end of the film despit all that he did. Pepper is very annoying in this. All she does throughout the entire movie is yell at Tony. Tony and Pepper's relationship takes a step back in this movie. They seem like they hate eachother here. Roddy is alright. He's probably the most reasonable character in the movie. Black Widow is well cast, but is extremely underused.The villians are even worse. Ivan Vanko comes off as more of a nuisance than a legitimate threat. Justin Hammer is probably the least intimidating villian I've ever seen. He's the most annoying person in the film, and that's saying something.The effects are still great, like the first film. The action is alright, but too short. The final battle is again very anti-climatic. One big problem I have with this film is that there's not much Iron Man in it.This movie also wants to cram as much Avengers material as possible, and it detracts from the main plot. They could have used this time to develop the characters more or have more action scenes.Overall this movie is a big disappointment and a bad follow-up.

It would have been the best of 2008 by far if not for a little movie called The Dark Knight. Now, a couple of years later we have the two leads back with a number of new big name additions, and some impressive CGI as expected.Robert Downey Jr. continues to shine as Tony Stark, with an ego the size of the planet, and Gwyneth Paltrow still has great chemistry with him. Add to the mix a neat villain, Whiplash, played by the always excellent Mickey Rourke, the lovely Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Don Cheadle as Rhodey/War Machine, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. You won't find a film in this genre with a cast list this strong. Even though it felt like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson were stuck in here just for a reference towards The Avengers movie of the future, it worked for me, especially Scarlett's fight scene towards the end. Don Cheadle was a great choice for replacing Terrence Howard. I'm still not sure why they got rid of him, but I didn't miss his feminine voice one bit. For me, as great as Robert Downey is in this role, both villains stole the show. The brilliant choice to underplay the part worked wonders for Mickey Rourke. His muscular body, covered head to toe in tattoos, along with his multi-colored hair, gold teeth, Russian accent, toothpick, and complete with a parrot on his shoulder, made him one of the most interesting characters for appearances alone. He could have gone way overboard with this character, but he keeps his cool and is even more believable for it. Sam Rockwell has always been an actor that may not have name recognition to everyone, but from the time I first saw him in The Green Mile until last years Moon, he turns in one solid performance after the next. He is like a darker version of Tony Stark, complete with a large personality and more than his share of funny lines.I have only a few gripes. I didn't care for the pacing. It seemed much longer than two hours and I typically have no problem watching long movies. Compared to the first Iron Man, some scenes were closing in on boring, but thankfully what works here, works really well. The dialogue was pretty strong and often very funny, but the script as a whole could have been thought out a little better. There is almost too much going on and too many people to fit into one story. Like the previous film, there is also a lack of action. The story always comes first, but this sequel could have let loose a whole lot more. When it does, you get some real good stuff, like the scene with Whiplash slicing up the race cars.As far as sequels go, Iron Man 2 is better than most, but it's not everything it could have been, or what most people were hoping for. Still, it's a fun ride from start to finish and a great way to start off the summer movie season.",4,"Like Tony Stark, Iron Man 2 is good, but flawed",1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,2885,"['first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'strong', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', '2008', 'far', 'not', 'little', 'movie', 'called', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Now', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'two', 'leads', 'back', 'number', 'new', 'big', 'name', 'additions', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'expected.Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'shine', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'ego', 'size', 'planet', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'still', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Add', 'mix', 'neat', 'villain', 'Whiplash', 'played', 'always', 'excellent', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'lovely', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Rhodey/War', 'Machine', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'genre', 'cast', 'list', 'strong', 'Even', 'felt', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'were', 'stuck', 'here', 'just', 'reference', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'future', 'worked', 'especially', 'Scarlett', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'replacing', 'Terrence', 'Howard', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'got', 'rid', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'feminine', 'voice', 'one', 'bit', 'as', 'great', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'role', 'villains', 'stole', 'show', 'brilliant', 'choice', 'underplay', 'part', 'worked', 'wonders', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'muscular', 'body', 'covered', 'head', 'toe', 'tattoos', 'multi-colored', 'hair', 'gold', 'teeth', 'Russian', 'accent', 'toothpick', 'complete', 'parrot', 'shoulder', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'appearances', 'alone', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'overboard', 'character', 'cool', 'even', 'more', 'believable', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'always', 'been', 'actor', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'name', 'recognition', 'everyone', 'time', 'first', 'saw', 'Green', 'Mile', 'last', 'years', 'Moon', 'one', 'solid', 'performance', 'next', 'darker', 'version', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'complete', 'large', 'personality', 'more', 'share', 'funny', 'lines.I', 'have', 'only', 'few', 'gripes', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'pacing', 'seemed', 'much', 'longer', 'two', 'hours', 'typically', 'have', 'problem', 'watching', 'long', 'movies', 'Compared', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'scenes', 'were', 'closing', 'boring', 'thankfully', 'what', 'here', 'really', 'well', 'dialogue', 'was', 'pretty', 'strong', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'script', 'whole', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'thought', 'out', 'little', 'better', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'fit', 'one', 'story', 'previous', 'film', 'also', 'lack', 'action', 'story', 'always', 'first', 'sequel', 'could', 'have', 'let', 'loose', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'When', 'get', 'real', 'good', 'stuff', 'scene', 'Whiplash', 'slicing', 'up', 'race', 'cars.As', 'far', 'sequels', 'go', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'better', 'most', 'not', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'hoping', 'Still', 'fun', 'ride', 'start', 'finish', 'great', 'way', 'start', 'off', 'summer', 'movie', 'season']",N/A

Improvements include better action sequences and some great characters added to the franchise. Unfortunately there is a lot going on here and even though it isn't hard to follow, there isn't enough time to give each sub plot the proper screen time it deserves. Oddly enough for a super hero film, I think they could have edited some of the talky scenes down and added a little more Iron Man action.A good example of this is when we meet Natasha Romanova she isn't given much to do and I found myself wondering if she was going to be The Black Widow on screen. She is only in one action sequence(a great one with one of the funniest moments in the film)late in the movie and she and Nick Fury are really only there to set up The Avengers movie. I'm not saying it should be edited out, but there is only so much ground you can cover in two hours. Whiplash is played with gusto by Mickey Rourke, but he doesn't have much screen time either and that seems to be the problem with this film, no one but Tony Stark gets enough screen time.After the first encounter with Whiplash in Monaco on the race track, we don't really get a good dose of Iron man until the final battle, which means there is over an hour of time where there isn't that much action. Considering what I had read about this being an action packed film, I found it to be very talky. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the characters are well developed and the actors are all really good here.The final battle is very good with some very cool Iron Man destruction and some nifty moves, but it's surprising and anti-climatic when Whiplash is defeated very quickly. In the first film, I thought the final battle was too long and in this one, it just seems to end too abruptly. I'm not bashing this film in any way as it is a very fun film that I will most certainly own the DVD/Blu Ray when it is released, but I think the story may have been a little too ambitious for one film.Overall I give Iron Man 2 a solid B(4 stars)and I think Favreau did a very good job all things considered. Of course if you are seeing this in a theater, then stick around until the end of the credits role for a little teaser scene about another Marvel Hero who will be hitting theaters next year.",4,"A SOLID SEQUEL, HEAVY ON STARK AND LIGHT ON IRON!",1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,2314,"['Iron', 'Man', '2', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'very', 'solid', 'fun', 'sequel', 'Improvements', 'include', 'better', 'action', 'sequences', 'great', 'characters', 'added', 'franchise', 'Unfortunately', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'even', ""n't"", 'hard', 'follow', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'give', 'sub', 'proper', 'screen', 'time', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'super', 'hero', 'film', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'edited', 'talky', 'down', 'added', 'little', 'more', 'Iron', 'Man', 'action.A', 'good', 'example', 'when', 'meet', 'Natasha', 'Romanova', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'found', 'wondering', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Black', 'Widow', 'screen', 'only', 'one', 'action', 'sequence', 'great', 'one', 'one', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'late', 'movie', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'there', 'set', 'up', 'Avengers', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'be', 'edited', 'out', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'can', 'cover', 'two', 'hours', 'Whiplash', 'played', 'gusto', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'be', 'problem', 'film', 'one', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'enough', 'screen', 'time.After', 'first', 'encounter', 'Whiplash', 'Monaco', 'race', 'track', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'good', 'dose', 'Iron', 'man', 'final', 'battle', 'hour', 'time', 'where', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'action', 'Considering', 'what', 'had', 'read', 'being', 'action', 'packed', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'talky', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'here.The', 'final', 'battle', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'cool', 'Iron', 'Man', 'destruction', 'nifty', 'moves', 'surprising', 'anti-climatic', 'when', 'Whiplash', 'defeated', 'very', 'quickly', 'first', 'film', 'thought', 'final', 'battle', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'just', 'end', 'too', 'abruptly', ""'m"", 'not', 'bashing', 'film', 'way', 'very', 'fun', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'own', 'DVD/Blu', 'Ray', 'when', 'released', 'think', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'ambitious', 'one', 'film.Overall', 'give', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'solid', 'B', '4', 'stars', 'think', 'Favreau', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'things', 'considered', 'course', 'are', 'seeing', 'theater', 'then', 'stick', 'around', 'end', 'credits', 'role', 'little', 'teaser', 'scene', 'Marvel', 'Hero', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'year']",N/A

He's single-handedly managed to shut down the arms race, achieving de facto world peace, and his rivals aren't even close. Or so he thinks.  It turns out he and his father before him have made some hidden enemies along the way to corporate and personal success, and the U.S. military (not to mention nearly every other world power) doesn't like being preempted by a cocky upstart, and won't rest until they own the Iron Man suit or its equivalent.  Add to that daddy issues, frustrations at work with a frazzled overcompensating secretary and a beautiful and dangerous new assistant, and the stage is set for a classic escalation towards a massive climax.  It gets busy, and even goes dark here and there, especially when we see the super baddy evil genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), but never loses the playful and comic tone established by Robert Downey, Jr., his best friend Don Cheadle (Lt. Rhodes), and his incompetent archrival Sam Rockwell (Justin Hammer).

That being said, this sequel doesn't have enough of what made the first film so much fun: action, Downey improv & banter, and a villain that doesn't get near enough screen time.  This time around, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is battling the blood poisoning that is slowly killing him, while also taking on rival industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Russian genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke).  Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Stark's love interest/assistant Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as James Rhodes (who dons the War Machine armor, and seems to wind up being a better acting choice as well), Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as the Black Widow, and Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury; all of which are pretty servicable, but once again, it's Downey's show, and he's loving every minute of it.  I personally dug Rourke's take on Whiplash as he proves to be the most interesting character here other than Stark, but his screen time is sadly lacking.  Still, director Jon Favreau (who has quite a bit of an expanded role here than he did the last time around as Stark's bodyguard) manages to weave a fun sequel, even if it doesn't have that same kind of magic that the first film had before it.

It was just plain fun.  The acting across the board was very good and Faverou's direction was good as well.  Iron man 2 on the other hand suffers from the same problem as many superhero sequels have over the years, too many characters.  The film seems to lack focus.  Several characters pop in and out of the film without much development.  Don Cheadle as well as Mickey Rourke's characters were given little to do.  The Iron Man and War Machine fight was so poorly conceived that it just felt forced and contrived just get another fight scene into the film.The editing of the film just seemed off as well.  Scenes that should have been cut just went on and on.  In several scenes, it seemed to me like the actors were just improvising their dialogue.  It's almost as if Faverou was a little too hand's off with his direction.  The story just seemed to amount to little more than a precursor to the eventual Avengers film.  The few action scenes in the movie were well done but the rest of the film just didn't measure up.

I mean, with the first movie, you had the extraordinary talents of Downey, Howard, Paltrow, Bridges and plenty more anchoring what was an incredible must-see summer slam of a movie. However, seeing the trailers for the second movie made me think ""Uh oh, Spider Man 3 all over again."" Sequels, especially superhero ones, seem to think that since they bring tons of random crap and characters into the frame, that they are always better, and as excited as I was for this movie, I felt it was going to be another one of those movies. So upon going into the theater, I kept those worries in mind.Well, I can now officially say that those worries didn't prevent me from loving the movie.Remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital!***SPOILERS***Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.Now the plot may not sound that great, but when you see it in the movie, you will be impressed with how complex it is. To not spoil too much, I left some stuff out, because the movie is that great. Aside from the plot, everything else is great. The acting here is fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. has his usual charm here, playing the lovable jerk that is Tony Stark. Replacing Terrence Howard is Don Cheadle, and he does it well! I can't believe I am saying this but I actually preferred him to Howard. Howard was great but wooden in places, whereas Cheadle was great the whole way. And Scarlett Johannson... whoa. When is she NEVER eye candy? As for her performance- this movie proves she is not just another pretty face. Her fight scene is just... mind blowingly amazing! Mickey Rourke gives a a fantastic performance as well, and manages to shine as the villain,Of course, halfway through, the movie takes a break from the action and focuses on some character development- I was worried about it at first hearing but as I was watching the movie, I realized that sometimes, in superhero movies, character development does more than whiz-bang action. Don't worry guys, the scenes where action is absent are just as great as the scenes with action. But the action scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!! People are exaggerating the lack of action- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen. A great sequel and a great standalone movie, Iron Man 2 is a sequel that truly kicks ass. Whatever worries you may have, I recommend you cast them aside, because you're in for a 2 hour fun ride. So if you wanna see a sequel that truly kicks ass, this movie is it!",5,"No rust on this ""Iron""",1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,4524,"['will', 'admit', 'was', 'tad', 'worried', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'well', 'let', 'face', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'fantastic', 'was', 'almost', 'untouchable', 'mean', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'extraordinary', 'talents', 'Downey', 'Howard', 'Paltrow', 'Bridges', 'plenty', 'more', 'anchoring', 'what', 'was', 'incredible', 'must-see', 'summer', 'slam', 'movie', 'However', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'second', 'movie', 'made', 'think', 'Uh', 'oh', 'Spider', 'Man', '3', 'over', 'again', 'Sequels', 'especially', 'superhero', 'ones', 'seem', 'think', 'bring', 'tons', 'random', 'crap', 'characters', 'frame', 'are', 'always', 'better', 'as', 'excited', 'was', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'movies', 'So', 'going', 'theater', 'kept', 'worries', 'mind.Well', 'can', 'now', 'officially', 'say', 'worries', 'did', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'loving', 'movie.Remember', 'when', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'tried', 'accomplish', 'something', 'epic', 'Transformers', '2', 'new', 'characters', 'stuff', 'Well', 'Jon', 'Faverau', 'managed', 'accomplish', 'what', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'never', 'did-', 'make', 'near-perfect', 'sequel', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'Now', 'first', 'not', 'ton', 'action', 'scenes', 'where', 'action', 'absent', 'Faverau', 'make', 'most', 'Complete', 'great', 'action', 'characters', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'first', 'big', 'summer', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'sure', 'especially', 'see', 'digital', '***SPOILERS***Iron', 'Man', '2', 'up', 'year', 'when', 'first', 'movie', 'left', 'off', 'Stark', 'Expo', 'just', 'begun', 'Flushing', 'New', 'York', 'last', 'year', 'Tony', 'televised', 'hearing', 'privatizes', 'world', 'peace', 'Life', 'be', 'great', 'fact', 'reactor', 'keeping', 'alive', 'killing', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'Iron', 'Man', 'though-', 'go', 'Iron', 'Man', 'moment', 'even', 'replacing', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Natalie', 'Rushman', 'appointing', 'Potts', 'CEO', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'However', 'Russia', 'Ivan', 'Vanko', 'son', 'physicist', 'Anton', 'Vanko', 'having', 'just', 'lost', 'father', 'jealous', 'Stark', 'success', 'own', 'arc', 'reactor', 'Whiplash', 'badass', 'villain', 'two', 'electrified', 'whips', 'can', 'split', 'anything', 'half', 'enough', 'force.His', 'first', 'appearance', 'race', 'Monaco', 'brief', 'failed', 'attempt', 'kill', 'Tony', 'up', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'Stark', 'rival', 'collaborate', 'build', 'new', 'technology', 'will', 'hopefully', 'overthrow', 'Tony', 'However', 'stint', 'Tony', 'house', 'appointing', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'War', 'Machine', 'several', 'other', 'plots', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'suffering', 'personal', 'problems', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'Iron', 'Man', 'resolve', 'this.Now', 'plot', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'great', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'how', 'complex', 'not', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'left', 'stuff', 'out', 'movie', 'great', 'Aside', 'plot', 'everything', 'else', 'great', 'acting', 'here', 'fantastic', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'usual', 'charm', 'here', 'playing', 'lovable', 'jerk', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Replacing', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'am', 'saying', 'actually', 'preferred', 'Howard', 'Howard', 'was', 'great', 'wooden', 'places', 'whereas', 'Cheadle', 'was', 'great', 'whole', 'way', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'whoa', 'When', 'NEVER', 'eye', 'candy', 'performance-', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'fight', 'scene', 'just', 'mind', 'blowingly', 'amazing', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'shine', 'villain', 'course', 'halfway', 'movie', 'break', 'action', 'focuses', 'character', 'development-', 'was', 'worried', 'first', 'hearing', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'realized', 'sometimes', 'superhero', 'movies', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'whiz-bang', 'action', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'guys', 'scenes', 'where', 'action', 'absent', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'scenes', 'action', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'INCREDIBLE', 'People', 'are', 'exaggerating', 'lack', 'action-', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'alone', 'more', 'action', 'first', 'certainly', 'more', 'thrilling', 'first', 'too', 'climax', 'certainly', 'thrill', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'had', 'blast', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen.So', 'short', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'success', 'had', 'tons', 'fun', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'great', 'sequel', 'great', 'standalone', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'sequel', 'truly', 'ass', 'worries', 'may', 'have', 'recommend', 'cast', 'aside', ""'re"", '2', 'hour', 'fun', 'ride', 'So', 'wan', 'see', 'sequel', 'truly', 'ass', 'movie']",N/A

1248270,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B0021L8V1G,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","I want to start off by saying that all the people who said this movie spent too much time pushing the Avenger Initiative forward, were kind of wrong. I say ""kind of"", instead of just plain ""wrong"", because, while there are scenes devoted to that agenda, the focus is still definitely Tony Stark and the Iron Man ""weapon"". Robert Downey Jr. returns to the role that reinvigorated his career, and he's better than ever. RDJ's portrayal is possibly the most spot-on comic book character that I have seen come to life off of a page. Yes, Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best, but his Tony Stark is a very close second. As for the rest of the performances, they ranged from adequate to great. I never understood why people doubted Don Cheadle replacing Terrence as Rhodey/War Machine from the start. I never did, and he did just what I expected him to. He didn't overact, he didn't steal the show (although I doubt that's possible when your co-start is RDJ), and his voice fit the commanding character that I felt Rhodey's should have been in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I like Terrence Howard in particular roles, but not as Rhodey. I felt his talent was misplaced. And don't get me started on Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Yeah, she's triple covert, and oh my god. That's all I need to say. (wipes drool from mouth). Gwyneth Paltrow returns from the first film, and she's just as quirky. She and RDJ play off of each other very well. That's definitely a dynamic that I enjoy revisiting these films to see.Now Sam Jackson just so happens to be my favorite actor, due to his natural cool guy persona. Him being in this universe is enough for me to be giddy about, yet alone playing such a pivotal role in the Avengers Initiative. While he didn't have a lot of screen time as Nick Fury, I still feel like he still did a great job at capturing the character from Mark Millar's The Ultimates. Ironically, Millar's updated, black Nick Fury was based on Sam Jackson's likeness before he even knew. I feel like I would be doing this guy a disservice if I didn't at least mention Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson. He has actually grown on me as a character after seeing him in almost every film in the quasi-series. Now for the villains. I love Iron Man, and Jeff Bridges. While I thought he made a great corporate villain, something about him being inside of the Iron Monger suit rubbed me the wrong way. I just never really believed it, but it got the job done. Fast forward to Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played more for humor, and the jokes often fell flat. He was still a little funny, and I probably wouldn't be able to chose anyone else for his roles but he just didn't serve as the comic relief that he was intended to be. He reminded me of a skinny version of Austin Powers, except he couldn't fight. That's probably not much of an insult coming from me, because I'm skinny, but I'd like to think I can defend myself. It's not even as if the film needed any more comic relief. Tony Stark was the funniest one in it, and his interactions with Pepper, and Rhodey, have enough to supply the laughs. I was waiting to see Hammer get his due because I loved his character, but that didn't happen in this movie. Perhaps he'll be one of the villains again in the third installment.Now for the main villain, played by Mickey Rourke. Rourke rounds out the all-star cast as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, if that's what you want to call him. Don't get me wrong, he was Whiplash, in essence, but if you've never picked up an Iron Man comic before (or watched the cartoon from the 90's), you'd only know him as Ivan Vanko. He was a more fearsome adversary than Jeff Bridges as Iron Monger. His badassedness was not displayed quite as much as I had hoped, but you still got the message that he was not to be messed with, a few times. I genuinely felt for his character at first, because his father didn't deserve to live, and die, the way he was forced to, after working with Howard Stark to design the very arc reactor that powered the Iron Man suit, and kept Tony alive. It was his choice of handling that situation that drives you to loathe him. Rourke played him a bit cartooney, but he still did a fine job, even if you can't always understand the Russian accent. Sadly, his final showdown with War Machine and Iron Man is so short that you will miss it if you blink. To be fair, the finale in Iron Man 2 still pissed on the finale in the first one. My only complaint about Iron Man is the lack of a decent final fight. That rooftop/street showdown was very anticlimactic, so I was looking forward to Jon Favreau upping the ante for the sequel. He definitely did, and it wreaks havoc on your sound system. Wow. Window shattering, neighbor waking stuff. Even though I said that the movie did not spend too much time pushing the Avengers into existence, it was still very there. Front and center, to be honest, but never overbearing, like it has been made out to be. There were a few nicely placed little easter eggs that very clearly winked at us fans of the Marvel Universe.One golden nugget (or red, white, and blue, to be exact) actually made me laugh with excitement for what has now become my second favorite Marvel Studios production, after the first Iron Man. That would be Captain America: The First Avenger. Overall, the film was pretty funny. More humorous than anything else, but that's not to say that the action was not impressive. It was definitely good stuff, but this movie still didn't meet my expectations, as far as the hype that was built around it. It's surprising that this all-star cast could not elevate this sequel about its predecessor. I would rank it on the lower side of Marvel Studios' filmography, but still fairly high in comparison to your average comic book movies. My ranking thus far (pre-Avengers) is: (1) Iron Man, (2) Captain America: The First Avenger, (3) The Incredible Hulk (which really needs a sequel, by the way, whether it be with Ruffalo or Norton -- obviously Ruffalo), (4) Iron Man 2, and (5) Thor (don't let me ranking it last fool you, I really like it). Anyway, back to the film at hand. I probably loved this movie more than the average moviegoer, or film enthusiast, due to me being such a huge comic geek, and Marvel fan. But nevertheless, this is a good movie. If you were to separate it from the first film, it probably wouldn't hold up quite as well, but it would still be good. I've defended this movie from the claims that it's just an Avengers preview throughout this review, and I stand by that, but to be honest, had Favreau chosen not to put as many Avengers easter eggs and set-ups in it, it would probably stand on its own merit better. So to wrap this up, I liked it less than the original, but I still highly recommend it to fans of the Marvel U, or comic book flicks in general.

1248273,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0021L8V1G,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","***1/2As ""Iron Man 2"" opens, Tony Stark, the wunderkind head of Stark Industries, has just revealed to the world at large that it is indeed he lurking inside the metallic suit of the planet's latest crime-fighting superhero.  But such a public admission comes with a steep price.  For now the United States government wants him to register himself as a deadly weapon; a rival defense contractor (Sam Rockwell) is determined to beat Stark at his own game by creating his own army of iron-clad warriors; and an arch-nemesis (Mickey Rourke) from the former Soviet Union has suddenly appeared on the scene in his own superhero getup to destroy Stark in a mano-a-mano battle on the streets of Monaco.As a piece of pure Saturday-matinee popcorn entertainment, ""Iron Man 2,"" directed by Jon Favreau, is, perhaps predictably, a notch or two below its dazzling 2008 predecessor.  However, the sequel still has enough quality elements - most of them holdovers from the first film - to recommend seeing it:  namely, Robert Downey Jr. as the wisecracking, hard-living but lovable boy genius, Stark; Gwyneth Paltrow as his endearing personal assistant, now CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts; and enough funny one-liners to take the edge off of some - though not all - of the script's numerous plot contrivances.  As with the previous film, Downey Jr. and Paltrow achieve a wonderful love/hate chemistry between them, and the cast has been expanded to include Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson (who had an uncredited role in the first one), and Kate Mara as well.The screenplay by Justin Theroux makes at least one right choice by having Stark becoming ever more gravely ill as a result of the chemical he has to keep pumping into his chest to survive in his semi-cybernetic condition.  This has the effect of humanizing the character, making him destructible and vulnerable and, thus, someone whose fate we can come to care deeply about.  And, needless to say, Downey Jr.'s smart, savvy performance is equally instrumental in helping us to connect with the character.The special effects and actions scenes are impressive, of course, but it is Downey Jr. and Paltrow who once again make the movie soar.",3,"not as fine as the original, but entertaining enough",1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,2209,"['***1/2As', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'opens', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'wunderkind', 'head', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'just', 'revealed', 'world', 'large', 'indeed', 'lurking', 'metallic', 'suit', 'planet', 'latest', 'crime-fighting', 'superhero', 'such', 'public', 'admission', 'steep', 'price', 'now', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'register', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'rival', 'defense', 'contractor', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'determined', 'beat', 'Stark', 'own', 'game', 'creating', 'own', 'army', 'iron-clad', 'warriors', 'arch-nemesis', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'suddenly', 'appeared', 'scene', 'own', 'superhero', 'getup', 'destroy', 'Stark', 'mano-a-mano', 'battle', 'streets', 'Monaco.As', 'piece', 'pure', 'Saturday-matinee', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'directed', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'perhaps', 'predictably', 'notch', 'two', 'dazzling', '2008', 'predecessor', 'However', 'sequel', 'still', 'enough', 'quality', 'elements', 'most', 'holdovers', 'first', 'film', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'namely', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'wisecracking', 'hard-living', 'lovable', 'boy', 'genius', 'Stark', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'endearing', 'personal', 'assistant', 'now', 'CEO', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'enough', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'take', 'edge', 'not', 'script', 'numerous', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'previous', 'film', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Paltrow', 'achieve', 'wonderful', 'love/hate', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'been', 'expanded', 'include', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'had', 'uncredited', 'role', 'first', 'one', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'well.The', 'screenplay', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'least', 'one', 'right', 'choice', 'having', 'Stark', 'becoming', 'ever', 'more', 'gravely', 'ill', 'result', 'chemical', 'keep', 'pumping', 'chest', 'survive', 'semi-cybernetic', 'condition', 'effect', 'humanizing', 'character', 'making', 'destructible', 'vulnerable', 'thus', 'someone', 'fate', 'can', 'come', 'care', 'deeply', 'about', 'needless', 'say', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'smart', 'savvy', 'performance', 'equally', 'instrumental', 'helping', 'connect', 'character.The', 'special', 'effects', 'actions', 'scenes', 'are', 'impressive', 'course', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'make', 'movie', 'soar']",N/A

And instead created a story about Tony the man.  Tony the billionaire, arrogant playboy.  Tony, the man who is dying.The Paramount logo barely glows on the big screen when we hear the audio of the Senate hearings by a smarmy senator who demands the Iron suit ""weapon"" for the USA.  Tony wants it for himself and congratulates himself on ""privatizing World Peace"" *kiss kiss*However, the metal he is using for the energy core that is keeping him alive as well as powering the Iron suit is killing him.  CGI veins darken his neck.  But in a fit of wanting to protect those he loves by pushing them away, he gives away his art gallery, gives his CEO post to Pepper Potts and decides to party his life away.The world however ,was not meant to give Stark a relaxing good time.The other side of the world has a Russian physicist whose father worked for and later apparently discarded by Tony's father.  This man, Ivan, wants revenge.  Collaborating with a government stooge (Justin Hammer, a real idiot) he invents Iron-man clones which as we will later see will be used to bring down Stark Industries (known colloquially as ""Hammer-oids"").  Hey, I could NOT make this stuff up, OK??I disagree with critics who feel it's another Spider-man 3 [Spider-Man 3 (Two-Disc Special Edition)] with a bunch of villains and mixing it up.  Far from it.The ""women of steel"" include Black Widow, working under cover for SHIELD as Tony's legal adviser (and man she is fine) and a great martial artist.  Love the fight scenes!  The other ""woman of steel"" is Pepper Potts, who is at her wits end about what to do about and with Tony.  She loves him but she can't stand him.  Whadda predicaminckt!The real player is Tony's dad.  We watch a film that would have done Disney proud as the ""Key to the Future"" is revealed (complete with Disney-esque music and style) but is actually more than it seems -- and gives Tony a key to his future.The relationship angle was a welcome change for the superhero film.  It's mostly story and plot and interaction between characters.  Yes, there are explosions and broken glass and flying bullets and guns -- but these are secondary -- even the villain is secondary -- to the man and the myth that is Stark.I was impressed!Minus one star for the slow pace.  I found that it went on a little too long, with Tony getting drunk, smashing up his own birthday party and so on.  The Shield connection and Black Widow's part could have been expanded in lieu of the silly party antics.Don't forget to stay to the end of the credits!  There's a cool chestnut for you Marvel Comics fans!Bottom Line:  Character driven, real story and substance into the man that is Tony Stark, as he finds his body betraying him, as he is slowly dying and does not have a lot of options.  People who don't normally go in for these types of comic book-based films will enjoy this picture as a result of this new, original style by Favreau.Recommended:Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)Iron Man Viva Las Vegas # 1 (of 4) comic",4,"Men of Iron, Women of Steel -- The Tony Stark Story!",1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,3392,"['[', 'THIS', 'BEING', 'WRITTEN', 'AT', 'THE', 'TIME', 'THE', 'THEATRICAL', 'RELEASE', 'THIS', 'WRITING', 'THE', 'DVD', 'IS', 'NOT', 'OUT', 'YET', 'THANKS', ']', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', 'shoot', 'action', 'crazed', 'villains', 'conflicted', 'hero', 'who', 'put', 'life', 'threatening', 'situations', 'director', 'Favreau', 'decided', 'different', 'take.Favreau', 'went', 'Iron-Deficient', 'diet', 'instead', 'created', 'story', 'Tony', 'man', 'Tony', 'billionaire', 'arrogant', 'playboy', 'Tony', 'man', 'who', 'dying.The', 'Paramount', 'logo', 'barely', 'big', 'screen', 'when', 'hear', 'audio', 'Senate', 'hearings', 'smarmy', 'senator', 'who', 'Iron', 'suit', 'weapon', 'USA', 'Tony', 'privatizing', 'World', 'Peace', '*kiss', 'kiss*However', 'metal', 'using', 'energy', 'core', 'keeping', 'alive', 'as', 'well', 'powering', 'Iron', 'suit', 'killing', 'CGI', 'darken', 'neck', 'fit', 'wanting', 'protect', 'pushing', 'away', 'away', 'art', 'gallery', 'CEO', 'post', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'party', 'life', 'away.The', 'world', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'give', 'Stark', 'relaxing', 'good', 'time.The', 'other', 'side', 'world', 'Russian', 'physicist', 'father', 'worked', 'later', 'apparently', 'discarded', 'Tony', 'father', 'man', 'Ivan', 'revenge', 'Collaborating', 'government', 'stooge', 'Justin', 'Hammer', 'real', 'idiot', 'Iron-man', 'clones', 'will', 'later', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'bring', 'down', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'known', 'colloquially', 'Hammer-oids', 'Hey', 'could', 'NOT', 'make', 'stuff', 'up', 'OK', 'disagree', 'critics', 'who', 'feel', 'Spider-man', '3', '[', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'bunch', 'villains', 'mixing', 'up', 'it.The', 'women', 'steel', 'include', 'Black', 'Widow', 'working', 'cover', 'SHIELD', 'Tony', 'legal', 'adviser', 'man', 'fine', 'great', 'martial', 'artist', 'Love', 'fight', 'scenes', 'other', 'woman', 'steel', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'who', 'wits', 'end', 'what', 'do', 'about', 'Tony', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Whadda', 'predicaminckt', 'real', 'player', 'Tony', 'dad', 'watch', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Disney', 'proud', 'Key', 'Future', 'revealed', 'complete', 'Disney-esque', 'music', 'style', 'actually', 'more', 'Tony', 'key', 'future.The', 'relationship', 'angle', 'was', 'welcome', 'change', 'superhero', 'film', 'mostly', 'story', 'plot', 'interaction', 'characters', 'Yes', 'are', 'explosions', 'broken', 'glass', 'flying', 'bullets', 'guns', 'are', 'secondary', 'even', 'villain', 'secondary', 'man', 'myth', 'Stark.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'Minus', 'one', 'star', 'slow', 'pace', 'found', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'Tony', 'getting', 'drunk', 'smashing', 'up', 'own', 'birthday', 'party', 'so', 'Shield', 'connection', 'Black', 'Widow', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'lieu', 'silly', 'party', 'antics.Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'stay', 'end', 'credits', 'cool', 'chestnut', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'fans', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Character', 'driven', 'real', 'story', 'substance', 'man', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'body', 'betraying', 'slowly', 'dying', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'options', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'go', 'types', 'comic', 'book-based', 'films', 'will', 'enjoy', 'picture', 'result', 'new', 'original', 'style', 'Favreau.Recommended', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Viva', 'Las', 'Vegas', '1', '4', 'comic']",N/A

And while I've seen enough sequels to know better than to expect too much, I was hoping for something that at least kept the tone of the first.  Wrong.This is just another B-movie plot with a $200 million budget, so we get wafer-thin characters and no logic, but enough noise, explosions, and gunfire to pummel us into not noticing.  (And that is a problem with movies based on comic books; even at their best, they're still comic-book stories.)So, what is it about?  Not that it matters much, but...Tony Stark is back; the government wants his technology; he won't give it up; another defense company tries to get it; Mickey Rourke gets sobered up enough to growl a few lines; robots fire rockets; lots of stuff blows up; etc. etc.  You get the idea...but don't worry, no innocent bystanders get hurt.  (Note to self: remember to take aspirin before entering movie theater.)What's really missing is a sense of fun; like a lot of other recent films, it's just a lot of yammering and hammering, and nobody is having a good time at all--certainly not the audience.  In the great movie swarm of 2010, the real casualty is joy.I was going to write that the portrayal of a rival defense contractor as a corrupt moron was unnecessarily, almost insultingly one-dimensional (I have worked with some very high-level defense contractors, none of whom were this stupid), but that comment extends to a lot of other characters, too.  Like I said, a B-movie plot...and B-movie writing.One note--I have never seen a movie with as many product placements as this movie has.

Again, Favreau sticks to what makes Iron Man so great...cool suits, big explosions, and beautiful women. Unfortunately, Favreau makes a few missteps with this sequel.For one, there is too much going on and not enough time to delve into it. There's the relationship between Stark and Senator Stern, the relationship between Stark and Hammer, the relationship between Stark and Ivan, the relationship between Stark and Rhodey, the relationship between Stark and Pepper, the relationship between Stark and Natasha...just to name a few. In all honesty, any one of these relationships could hold up a movie by themself. Sadly, Favreau tries to shove them all into 2 hours. It works, but barely.Along with all that, Tony is trying to cope with his looming death. Again, this alone could have held up the movie, but it was just another subplot which had to be explained away within twenty minutes. Granted, this subplot got the most exposure out of all of them, rightfully so, but it didn't get nearly as much exposure as it should've. I could have seen it continuing on to the third and final film.Even though Favreau doesn't have enough time to delve into everything, he does well with the time he has. The dialogue is witty and fast paced, the acting is superb, and the action sequences are some of the best.

1248294,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0021L8V1G,Sean Pasek,"[5, 12]","SPOILER ALERT!Word has it that Robert Downey Jr. requested the screenwriting services of Justin Theroux, who was one of the writers of Tropic Thunder.  Tropic Thunder was hilarious.  Iron Man 2, overall, was not.  It seemed like a poor attempt for Robert Downey Jr. and Justin Theroux to make Iron Man more comedic.  Jon Favreau should have known better.  While Iron Man has some funny moments here and there, the character is not supposed to be funny overall.  We had some light moments in the original film that worked really well.  But in the end, Stark was true to his goal and he took it seriously.  In this film, Stark seems to take nothing serious at all.Iron Man 2 tries to be a lighter movie than the previous one, while taking on a ""darker"" spin on the character of Tony Stark and his new nemesis, Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash.  Iron Man 2 fails on both fronts.Iron Man 2 isn't nearly has fun and innovative as the first film; a movie that had plenty of action and charm, with enough characterization for Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, and Obadiah Stane.  In this film, Iron Man casually makes only a couple of appearances, and it isn't enough to keep the audience involved.  Tony Stark dominates the film.  We see very little of Pepper Potts at all, and what could have been a great character in Ivan Vanko, is all but placed secondary to the very goofy Justin Hammer, poorly played by Sam Rockwell.Tony Stark's battle with alcoholism is addressed here.  In the comic books, it is tragic, and we see the fall of a great character and his battle to overcome it.  In this film, they chose to make Stark look like a buffoon.  He spends his time drunk, dancing around ridiculously in his Iron Man suit, and even making a silly bathroom stunt by ""showing"" his fellow party friends how Iron Man goes to the bathroom in his suit of armor.  It doesn't work.  The laughs that the filmmakers were hoping for were sporadic at best when I was at the premiere showing.Ivan Vanko is actually a combination of two villains...Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo.  They actually set up a good premise with this character; a Russian man who is the son of an inventor who worked with Tony's father.  When tragedy struck Ivan's father, he obviously holds Tony Stark responsible and vows revenge.  Taking on the mantle of ""Whiplash,"" and utilizing the same technology that powers Stark's Iron Man suit, Vanko creates two energy whips that can cut through metal like butter.  It's too bad that we're only given one short battle between Iron Man and Whiplash before, in a very predictable fashion, Vanko ends up fighting Iron Man in, guess what?  Another suit of armor!In the comics, Justin Hammer is a cold, ruthless man who views Stark as an obstacle that must be removed, since he runs a rival company.  Instead, we're treated to Sam Rockwell who makes Hammer look clueless in anything he does.  It's truly sad that one of Iron Man's premiere villains was reduced to this.  Normally, I don't like to bring up comic book comparisons, but in this case, they completely missed the boat with this character.  Rockwell plays Hammer like he, himself, has no idea what the character is like or what he is supposed to be about.Don Cheadle takes over as Rhodey and he does a good job with the character.  We are treated to the addition of ""War Machine,"" the armored superhero that Rhodey becomes.  Gwyneth Paltrow's character didn't have enough screen time, and her interactions as Pepper Potts with Tony Stark are too few and far between.  This is a shame because these two characters worked very well in the previous film.  The light banter between Potts and Stark in the previous installment is nearly gone in this film.Another great character that we see way too little of is Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow.  People seemed to wake up in their seats when she finally takes to the screen in her tight, black outfit and making short work of a score of guards when she breaks into Hammer's facility.  Too little screen time hurt the characterization of what should have been an interesting character.  Many superhero films make the big mistake of having too many characters.  This film finds itself among those.Iron Man 2 has a few redeeming things that keep it from becoming a total failure.  The actions scenes are, for the most part, well done.  Unfortunately, we see too few of them.  The attention to detail as Iron Man soars through the skies in the original film have disappeared in this film.  It's too bad.  So many people were in awe when Iron Man first takes to the skies in the first film.  The special effects are still top rate.  It's too bad there wasn't a good enough story to go with it.Iron Man 2 has its moments here and there.  It's worth one viewing, but frankly, I'm casting this one aside with Spider-Man 3, Superman Returns, Ghost Rider, and some of the other ""failed"" superhero films.  I don't know if any recent comic book film held such anticipation for its fans, and ended up being such a bitter disappointment.With Favreau, Downey Jr., and the rest of this talented bunch, they should have been able to deliver.

1248300,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B0021L8V1G,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[5, 14]","Iron Man 2 had all the elements of a blockbuster movie. A strong cast, solid direction by Jon Faverau, and spectacular special effects. Unfortunately, the film is bogged down by a soulless poorly written script that's all over the place. One sequel into this franchise and Iron Man is looking rusty.Iron Man 2 picks up where Iron man 1 left off. Six months after telling the world He's Iron Man, Tony Stark is now dying of the palladium in the arc reactor that is keeping him alive. On top of this, the U.S. government is trying to take the technology for the Iron man armor from him, and competitors like Justin Hammer are trying to replicate the armor.But somewhere in Siberia...the son of a former Stark employee Anton Vanko, Ivan Vanko has the secret arc reactor recipe that powers the suit. As Stark confidently testifies to the congresss that he's the only person who has the technology, Vanko heads over to France with his powered whips and own version of the Stark's secret recipe for the arc reactor.After the big display at the Stark Expo, a dying Stark keeps his secret as he heads to France decides to race his own car. This is where the wheels fall off the movie and it becomes a jumbled mess. It's clear this sequence is just conveniently there so Whiplash can wreck stuff and Iron man can beat him up. I rolled my eyes as Happy Hogan drives down the race track the wrong way to give Tony his red and silver Mark V suit to beat up Whiplash and deliver him to the French police.After Tony returns from France, we get more tacked on plot points in his new secretary Nancy Rushman who beats him down in his boxing ring. As he banters with Pepper Potts more convoluted stories are started. Nick Fury shows up with a mystery regarding some element Howard Stark was working on. Ivan Vanko gets busted out of Jail by Justin Hammer. Hammer goes to get his ""burd"" as the plot meanders to the midpoint.A few sequences later it's Tony's birthday, and a drunken Stark celebrates by putting on his Mark IV armor and blasting stuff. Realizing he's putting people in danger, Jim Rhodes (again coming out of nowhere) suits up in the Mark 2 suit to stop him. After a big rock-em-sock-em robot fistfight between the armored gladiators, and an repulsor blast explosion that shatters all the glass in Tony's house, Rhodes announces he's taking the suit and flies away. As this tacked on plot point moves the movie forward, Shawn tries to figure out how he learned how to fly an Iron man suit, accessed the pass codes between movies. He also tries to figure out how a suit with no repulsors has them.As Rhodey delivers the Mark 2 suit to the government to be weaponized, Tony goes to get some donuts, Nick Fury drops by to put Tony under House arrest. In addition to giving him something to do while cleaning up all that broken glass, he's told to figure out the mystery of the element. Tony goes and watches home movies, breaks out a model of the old Stark Expo and begins to solve the mystery of the triangle.Meanwhile Vanko and Hammer are putting together drones. But Vanko has an eleventh herb and spice he's not telling Hammer about.Meanwhile at the Stark mansion, Tony wrecks his house finding out the secret of the Triangle. As he installs the new coconut flavored element into his arc reactor, his life is saved just in time to figure out what Ivan Vanko is up to with his eleventh herb and spice.At the Hammer expo, Hammer does the Hammer dance as he reveals the drones and Jim Rhodes as War Machine. Vanko reveals the last part of his secret recipe. As Iron man enters in his shiny new Mark VI suit, he confronts Hammer and the drones start attacking.From here, Nancy Rushman goes into action as the Black Widow, and takes out Hammer's guards to get to Vanko.But Vanko is long gone and she has to hack the computer codes get control of the drones. All she does is get War Machine back under Rhodey's control. Well, he needs to help tony beat up some robots. After destroying all the drones, Here comes Vanko in his souped up Crimson Dynamo knock off armor. After a heavy metal beatdown, Tony and Rhodey fire repulsors at each other, Vanko is KO'd. Vanko knowing he's beaten decides to make himself and the drones blow up just in time for tony to save Pepper.At the end of the movie, Tony gets a medal for beating up on the Hammer drones, credits roll and we see a hammer and Agent Colson telling Nick Fury he's found it. I'd like to find out what happened to the story in this movie. Somewhere around the fifteen minute mark it stopped making sense.It's clear there's something missing in Iron Man 2; it doesn't have the heart or spirit of the first film, which had a light lively tone. By contrast this film feels artificial and manufactured. It's clear the studio executives and the toy companies meddled in the creative process for this film to sell as many T-shirts, action figures and whatever merchandise they could imagine. Instead of the plot flowing together organically like the first film, Iron man 2 is jam-packed with characters that serve no purpose and a jumbled plot that goes nowhere. Tony's armor gets an upgrade but the franchise needs a downgrade. This movie is too much like the jumbled storyline of a comic book and nothing like the linear pacing of a movie.As a diehard Iron man fan I was deeply disappointed with this film. As a Movie fan I was disgusted. Usually the process of executive meddling that ruins a franchise starts with the third movie.I can't fault the actors here, they were prevented from doing their best with the horrible script they were given. Robert Downey Jr. is solid here but is held down from greatness due to the bad script. Gwyneth Paltrow who was amazing as Pepper Potts last time is awkward here. She and Downey don't have the electric Cary Grant/ style chemistry they shared in the first movie. the Don Cheadle is wooden as Jim Rhodes. Terrence Howard had much better energy and charisma in the role. Cheadle has no chemistry with Robert Downey Jr, and is just flat in the role. Sam Rockwell is solid as Justin Hammer. I'm still trying to figure out what Scarlett Johansson's purpose was in playing the Black Widow. Her part was severely underwritten and underdeveloped. Samuel L. Jackson is passable as Nick Fury. But again, they give him nothing really serious to work with.Director Jon Faverau does his best to maintain the integrity of the Iron Man Franchise. The shots are about the same, the sequences are consistent with the first film, but it's clear the film doesn't have the same energy. What was once a fun superhero action franchise looks like it's on the slow road downhill like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise after Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. All I know is you won't see me in line for Iron Man 3. If you're thinking about getting Iron Man 2 Pass on it.

And Justin Hammer is just the man to help Ivan exact his revenge. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy.

You are never sure if he is the CEO of a major weapons manufacturer or a member of the Rat Pack. It seems he is the only cast member who stayed in character during the two-year vacation from part one. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts comes across as jealous and angry through most of the film and LTC James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes is played by a new actor, Don Cheadle. We see a darker side to Tony as he drinks more, parties more, and seems to care for Pepper less. It is inferred that he is distancing himself because he is slowly dying. Unfortunately, there is never a long enough break from the action for a proper scene to explain it all. Mickey Rourke, hot off of his rave reviews from The Wrestler, dons a Russian accent to play Ivan Vanko, the new super-baddie in town. Vanko is just a puppet for corporate baddie, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), to hide behind. Neither Rourke nor Rockwell live up to their previous acting hype and combined, do not compare to the strong screen presence Jeff Bridges gave us in part one.

But a friend urged me to check out the first Iron Man movie as he assured me Robert Downey, Jr. takes it levels above the typical super hero/comic-based films. And he was right. There are, as should be expected, moments that definitely require a suspension of belief, but I didn't mind them. I'm a published author of horror, sci-fi and fantasy, so I tend to look to the storyline and the characters above the impressive special effects.

After viewing the Iron Man 2 movie today, we both are glad to have seen it.  For starters, if you thought highly of the first Iron Man movie, it is safe to say that you are going to enjoy the second.  In addition, I felt that the plot to the first Iron man movie was excellent and well developed. I was uncertain if Iron Man 2 was going to top the first one in action and excitement. Let me say that Iron Man 2 was even better than the first for those who wonder if this is the case. In addition, when Terrence Howard was dropped after the first Iron Man and replaced by Don Cheadle to be Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr's) sidekick in Iron Man 2, I was also unsure how this would play out. Needless to say, Don Cheadle did a fine job as Iron Man's sidekick in this movie. Admittedly, the character that I enjoyed the most was Robert Downey Jr's potrayal as Tony Stark back in action. Robert Downey Jr happens to be one of my favorite actors and he really gave an even stronger performance this time around.  Gwyneth Paltrow is back as his reliable and self confident love interest who is deeply concerned for Tony Stark and wants the best for him.  Scarlet Johanson plays an eloquent femme fatale named Natasha who also cares to help out Tony Stark.  Then there is Mickey Rourke who plays a very convincing nemesis and ""evil genius"" villian named Vanko as the one who targets Tony Stark for revenge. Sam Rockwell plays a calculated senator by the last name of Hammer who craves some of the power that Tony Stark has.  Then there is Gary Shandling who also plays as one of the congressman who also seems to desire some of the influence of the Iron Man.  Samuel Jackson happens to also make an appearance as one of the men who is for the Iron Man. Overall, a strong all star cast and I feel that an excellent job was done on casting the characters for their respective parts.  It was exciting to see the romantic side of Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark character strive to continue in impressing Pepper Potts while simultaneously being forced to come to terms with maintaining the powerful and heroic legacy of his job as Iron Man,with some exciting scenes thrown in for strong measure. This is a great date night movie that both men and women are going to enjoy.

Great action, fantastic special effects, well developed multi-faceted characters that you really care about, some romance, a well written script with depth and a great story, and outstanding acting.Once again, Robert Downey Jr. plays a brilliant but troubled (though evolving) man who's life has become devoted to protecting peace. At the same time he struggles with his personal demons, and in this sequel he grapples with a life threatening illness. This actor is amazingly natural, completely believable and very entertaining. I love that his character is so intelligent and must use his mind to work through everything. It's also fascinating to watch his character heal from the hurts and relationship issues in his life. This wasn't just some mindless superhero movie (not that those are bad, but this was just different and yes, maybe a little better). It was a layered, well done story.What an incredible supporting cast! Mickey Rourke was great as the villain. I can't put my finger on it, but he made the role fascinating as he did in the Wrestler. Gwyneth Paltrow was wonderful, beautiful and believable. I was really surprised by Scarlett Johansson. She's incredibly versitile. I don't want to give anything away by saying too much, but she was amazing.

When we saw that Stark was being poisoned by the very tech that was keeping him alive (as Jarvis so conveniently spells out for us slow viewers), again, intriguing . . .Here's the problem - this stuff is supposed to be the setup, NOT the ENTIRE MOVIE!  Yes, at the 90 minute mark (literally, I checked my watch) when Stark was STILL dealing with these same issues, I was no longer pleased with the slow pace - I was BEGGING the movie to start doing something interesting!  Minus the ""race track"" sequence (most of which you've already seen in the trailer) the first half of the film has zero Iron Man action (unless you count a drunken brawl between Stark and Rhodey - a glorified barfight).By the time the woefully underused Mickey Rourke FINALLY unleashes his devious plot to assault Ironman with a batch of robots, the film has a mere 20 minutes left to go - and the ensuing climatic battle feels like what it is - a perfunctory, tacked on conclusion - seemingly included only because the filmmakers begrudgingly admit they are, in fact, making an action movie, and not a dramatic comedy.  As such, the final showdown between Ironman and Whiplash takes up all of about two minutes, and then the movie sprints for its closing credits.Also wasted as the lovely Scarlett Johansson, who has, as I suggested in my title, the films only truly enjoyable sequence as she does her Matrix-Infused-Latex-Dominatrix best in taking down a squad of security cops.  When a redhead girl's stunt-double brings more excitement to your movie than the titular Iron-clad hero, there is a SERIOUS problem!I think I understand what the problem is - the makers of the first film analyzed the reaction, saw that Robert Downey, Jr. got most of the praise for that film, and decided to build the sequel NOT around bigger and better action, but instead around twice as many opportunities for Downey to quip and mug and annoy other characters.  In fact, not only do they give us double the Downey, but they also introduce a rival arms dealer (Sam Rockwell) to do the exact same act, only for evil instead of good.All this means that if you enjoy Downey and Rockwell (who are both great at what they do) and don't mind a film built on their overindulgence, then you might like this sequel.  But if you go in expecting a bigger, badder Iron Man, don't . . . this is one of the first sequels I've ever seen that delivers LESS action than its predecessor.As others have suggested, at the end of the day, this film is essentially more a promotion for the supposedly upcoming AVENGERS movie - a film that is constantly being talked about and promised for some as yet unannounced future date.  If the further proposed films that are supposed to lead up to AVENGERS are as dull as this one, that day may never come.",2,"When your most exciting moment in an IRONMAN movie is Scarlett Johansson beating up cops, there is a major problem.",1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,3267,"['WOW', 'What', 'happened', 'here', 'surprise', 'smash', 'original', 'how', 'could', 'sequel', 'come', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'boring', 'admit', 'first', 'found', 'slower', 'pace', 'refreshing', ""n't"", 'direction', 'other', 'sequel', 'Bigger', 'louder', 'faster', 'less', 'plot', 'So', 'when', 'film', 'opened', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'talk', 'revolving', 'around', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'insistence', 'got', 'peace', 'privatized', 'senate', 'subcommittee', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'was', 'actually', 'interested', 'When', 'saw', 'Stark', 'was', 'being', 'poisoned', 'very', 'tech', 'was', 'keeping', 'alive', 'Jarvis', 'so', 'conveniently', 'out', 'slow', 'viewers', 'again', 'intriguing', 'problem', 'stuff', 'supposed', 'be', 'setup', 'NOT', 'ENTIRE', 'MOVIE', 'Yes', '90', 'minute', 'mark', 'literally', 'checked', 'watch', 'when', 'Stark', 'was', 'STILL', 'dealing', 'same', 'issues', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'pleased', 'slow', 'pace', 'was', 'BEGGING', 'movie', 'start', 'doing', 'something', 'interesting', 'Minus', 'race', 'track', 'sequence', 'most', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'trailer', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'zero', 'Iron', 'Man', 'action', 'count', 'drunken', 'brawl', 'Stark', 'Rhodey', 'glorified', 'barfight', 'time', 'woefully', 'underused', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'FINALLY', 'devious', 'plot', 'assault', 'Ironman', 'batch', 'robots', 'film', 'mere', '20', 'minutes', 'left', 'go', 'ensuing', 'climatic', 'battle', 'feels', 'what', 'perfunctory', 'tacked', 'conclusion', 'seemingly', 'included', 'only', 'filmmakers', 'begrudgingly', 'admit', 'are', 'fact', 'making', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'such', 'final', 'showdown', 'Ironman', 'Whiplash', 'up', 'two', 'minutes', 'then', 'movie', 'sprints', 'closing', 'credits.Also', 'wasted', 'lovely', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'suggested', 'title', 'films', 'only', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'sequence', 'Matrix-Infused-Latex-Dominatrix', 'best', 'taking', 'down', 'squad', 'security', 'cops', 'When', 'redhead', 'girl', 'stunt-double', 'brings', 'more', 'excitement', 'movie', 'titular', 'Iron-clad', 'hero', 'SERIOUS', 'problem', 'think', 'understand', 'what', 'problem', 'makers', 'first', 'film', 'analyzed', 'reaction', 'saw', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'got', 'most', 'praise', 'film', 'decided', 'build', 'sequel', 'NOT', 'bigger', 'better', 'action', 'instead', 'around', 'twice', 'as', 'many', 'opportunities', 'Downey', 'quip', 'mug', 'annoy', 'other', 'characters', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'give', 'double', 'Downey', 'also', 'introduce', 'rival', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'do', 'exact', 'same', 'act', 'only', 'evil', 'instead', 'good.All', 'enjoy', 'Downey', 'Rockwell', 'who', 'are', 'great', 'what', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'film', 'built', 'overindulgence', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'sequel', 'go', 'expecting', 'bigger', 'badder', 'Iron', 'Man', 'do', ""n't"", 'one', 'first', 'sequels', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'delivers', 'LESS', 'action', 'predecessor.As', 'others', 'have', 'suggested', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'essentially', 'more', 'promotion', 'supposedly', 'upcoming', 'AVENGERS', 'movie', 'film', 'constantly', 'being', 'talked', 'promised', 'yet', 'unannounced', 'future', 'date', 'further', 'proposed', 'films', 'are', 'supposed', 'lead', 'up', 'AVENGERS', 'are', 'as', 'dull', 'one', 'day', 'may', 'never', 'come']",N/A
1248319,A10C2SBALDLKU9,B0021L8V1G,Steven Carrier,"[3, 5]","""Iron Man 2"" is certainly a step up from ""Iron Man"". Where this sequel succeeds is in it's story. While ""Iron Man"" was a lot of fun, it was essentially 2 hrs of Tony Stark building three different suits and Robert Downey Jr. being witty. While it's not a terrible film by any means it's scope was rather small. With ""Iron Man 2"" we really get to open this world up and get to see who these characters are. We get a fully developed story with a couple different points of views. This is a great example of a sequel that can give the audience more of what made the first film work (in terms of action, effects, humor) and can also balance it out with bigger characterization, drama and more surprises. I thought that writer Justin Theroux handled it all very nicely in his clever script and director Jon Favreau (returning to the helm), does wonders with his fantastic cast. It's in that ensemble cast (that includes Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson) where the film really connects. These are all extremely talented and charming actors working in top form. The acting does not need to be good for sci-fi films like this (which baffles me) but here the director and his cast are handed a script that breathes life into it's players and makes the proceedings all the more fun. Where ""Iron Man"" was a character study first and an action movie second, ""Iron Man 2"" puts both of those aspects front and center, making it mentally engaging and a hell of a lot of fun. ""Iron Man 2"" is better than ""Iron Man"" and certainly one of the more graceful sequels to cross the silver screen since ""The Dark Knight"".",5,A graceful sequel to a classic film.,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,1666,"['Iron', 'Man', '2', 'certainly', 'step', 'up', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Where', 'sequel', 'story', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'was', 'essentially', '2', 'hrs', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'building', 'three', 'different', 'suits', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'being', 'witty', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'means', 'scope', 'was', 'rather', 'small', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'really', 'get', 'open', 'world', 'up', 'get', 'see', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'get', 'fully', 'developed', 'story', 'couple', 'different', 'points', 'views', 'great', 'example', 'sequel', 'can', 'give', 'audience', 'more', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'work', 'terms', 'action', 'effects', 'humor', 'can', 'also', 'balance', 'out', 'bigger', 'characterization', 'drama', 'more', 'surprises', 'thought', 'writer', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'handled', 'very', 'nicely', 'clever', 'script', 'director', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'returning', 'helm', 'wonders', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'are', 'extremely', 'talented', 'charming', 'actors', 'working', 'top', 'form', 'acting', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'here', 'director', 'cast', 'are', 'handed', 'script', 'life', 'players', 'proceedings', 'more', 'fun', 'Where', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'character', 'study', 'first', 'action', 'movie', 'second', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'aspects', 'front', 'center', 'making', 'mentally', 'engaging', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'better', 'Iron', 'Man', 'certainly', 'one', 'more', 'graceful', 'sequels', 'cross', 'silver', 'screen', 'Dark', 'Knight']",N/A

Jackson as Nick Fury, head of the SHIELD intelligence agency. Two new actors join this group -  Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard as Stark friend and Air Force officer, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Rushman, Stark's new aide who turns into a lot more.The bad guys are Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, a son of a former business partner of Stark's father. The elder Vanko dies at the beginning of the film, setting the son on a quest for vengeance that results in a suit much like Stark's, including a powerful electrical whip. Whiplash, as Rourke's character comes to be known, makes a very public attempt to kill Stark. After the attempt fails, Vanko is rescued from prison by Justin Hammer, a business rival of Stark's who wants to use Vanko's expertise to create more powerful armor and sell it to the US military.Add to this already potent mix several other complications - Stark's deepening relationship with Pepper, who he anoints as his replacement at Stark Industries, his growing egotism and hubris that makes very vulnerable to attack, and his body's rejection of the power cell in his chest that is grdually killing him, and you have a movie with a huge cast, lots of plot entanglements, and lots and lots of action.But it all works.

There are too many forced subplots as well such as the SHIELD guys showing up, the &#34;new element&#34; part, etc. I understand they need to tie the Avengers together, but for how much the writers get paid, they could have come up with an idea that both integrates better with the rest of the movie while being more entertaining.Also, LtCol Rhodes is a different actor.

Other new characters include Natalie Rushman aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) and Justin Hammer.The movie does have an issue of introducing too many characters but that can be ignored. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has a bigger role in this as he appears in a few scenes (mainly about talking about ""The Avengers"") as apposed to his after the credits scene in the first.Like the first, there is an extra scene after the credits that sets up for Marvel's next big movie.Set aside the lack of special features.

Nope.  I was looking forward to watching the the charactors playing off of each other, the actors acting.  Yes.  In a comic book movie.  And I kind of chuckled to myself.But it's true, if you haven't seen the Iron Man movies and have written them off as ""comic book lowbrow popcorn films"" then you have missed a couple of good movies with very good (accomplished) actors performing their craft in a winning way.  I was most looking forward to watching Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr., in case you don't live on planet earth) play matchwits with Pepper Potts (a very lovely Gwyneth Paltrow); to Tony Stark try to keep from making inappropriate advances on new assistant Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson, a.k.a. the undercover SHIELD operative Black Widow); to Ivan Vanko, the main villain of the film, played with actual subtlety and nuance by Mickey Rourke--he wasn't flashy but he did a great job.  But perhaps most of all I was ready to see Sam Rockwell's motormouthed nervous talker used car/ arms dealer salesman Justin Hammer spin his gums in his futile attempt to ""be cool""; he really was so much of this film's comedy and he was just funny.But this is a superhero movie, right?  Yes, and we get the requisite superhero action but perhaps not as much as you'd think.  And that's a good thing because the movie takes its time to craft the characters, those inhabiting the suits and those who aren't, and makes us care at least a little bit about them.  Is this sequel as good as its predecessor?  I don't think so, but I do think that it is very good and compelling though there are a lot of storylines to keep track of in the film (a criticism I heard a lot of at the time of its release).  The point is there is actually a lot of story and character here, and as I watched it again I was delighted several times to see some things that I had missed before.

1248348,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B0021L8V1G,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[5, 6]","Movie - 4.5In 2008, Iron Man took the box office by storm garnering high praise from fans and critics alike and grossing over $500 million worldwide. Personally, I was very surprised at how I liked it for its storytelling, witty humor, and blockbuster production values. It was thoughtful enough in establishing Tony Stark as a meaningful character, while at the same time providing loads of entertainment. With expectations set high, Iron Man 2 has a lot of anticipation going for it. And while it doesn't quite exceed its predecessor, I think it's just as good. The plot opens up 6 months after the end of the first film and puts Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in the presence of a senate hearing where the government basically wants him to turn the Iron Man suit over at the ""interest of national security."" But being the egotistical, yet virtuous, man that he is, Stark defends his case with ease by nonchalantly proving it'd be safer under his own personal use. Seeing this from afar, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is sickened by Stark's actions and false pretenses and vows to put him in his place. In the meantime, rival weapons contractor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) takes notice of Vanko's ambition and offers his resources in a joint effort to take down both Iron Man, as well as an ailing Tony Stark. Narrative wise, IM2 is a little less personable than the first as we were introduced to Stark, saw him realize his guilt, then become Iron Man in an effort of redemption. Here, after discovering that his palladium chest piece is slowly killing him, Stark must face his own mortality in and outside of the suit. But at the same time, being who he is (i.e. very kept to himself), he refuses confide in anyone. As a result, it alienates him and tarnishes his more likable portrayal from the first film. However, once he comes to terms with his father's legacy, he realizes his mistake and strives to become, not just Iron Man again, but the Iron Man worthy of his Avengers candidacy. The real diverging point in IM2, though, (and probably something that's greatly divided the fanbase) is the excess of comic book elements thrown in. The additions of Nick Fury, Black Widow, War Machine, Whiplash, Justin Hammer, and his robot army might feel a bit overwhelming with their newness. But I personally love the feeling of expansion it gives, especially considering the massive amount of crossovers, cameos, and references that will have to be made when Thor, Captain America, Iron Man 3, and The Avengers movies are done. But don't let that deter you. Despite all of the extra components, IM2 is still fun to watch with a snarkier script, more brisk pacing, better special effects, stellar action sequences, and a star-studded cast of actors. The next two years can't come soon enough.Video - 5.0Iron Man 2 presents itself with a much fuller image than the first movie. I absolutely love the filmic texture this one has in comparison. The slightly darker look may throw some people off, but I think it helps a great deal in CG effects integration, making for quite a pristine picture. To start off, colors possess an amazing amount of vibrancy. Red, gold, orange, yellow, occasional blues, and a little bit of green (in the Japanese garden) dominate the palette presenting some very cool shots, especially for action scenes. Blacks are deep and inky, while shadow delineation reveals an adequate amount of depth in all the tiny little lines and textures, nothing less from a Blu-ray with a newly minted transfer. Contrast helps to balance things out and doesn't waver a bit in terms of saturation levels or screen lighting. Facial features and flesh tones look excellent, particularly Scarlett Johansson with her pouty lips and pretty green eyes when we see her for the first time and she gets into the training ring. But getting back to the CG, I have to reiterate just how flawless it all looks and fits into the picture and overall scope of the plot. I thought IM1 looked good. But considering how much more action-packed IM2 is, it's amazing to even contemplate the amount of work that went into producing this special effects extravaganza. You can pretty much use any of the action sequences as demo material for the video or audio. But if I had to narrow it down to specific scenes, I'd say the fight in Monaco is definitely good for contrast (being the only daytime fight scene in the entire movie), the meeting with Nick Fury for black levels (not a racial thing, he just happens to be wearing a lot of black, which shows some good detail in his clothes), and the final battle at the Stark Expo/Japanese Garden for overall color (lots of greens, pinks, and charcoals, especially recommended). There's a little bit of banding in the digital backgrounds, but it's only a minor quibble in an otherwise reference video presentation. There are no signs EE, DNR, or a single artifact to sully, yet, another very fine transfer from the people at Paramount.Audio - 5.0Like the video, the audio portion of this film also outdoes its predecessor. The DTS-HD track here is instant go-to material and very representative of the advantages of lossless audio in general. From the very beginning of the movie, we get an enticing tease of what to expect in terms of directionality, separation, and LFEs as the opening credits introduce us to some ominous music, Ivan working on his own Arc Reactor, and some pounding bass effects. Aside from the obvious gunfire and weapons mayhem, the sound design for IM2 greatly utilizes all four surround speakers. Crowd noise and cheering make up a good deal of ambience during the more low-key dialogue sequences such as the intro of the Stark Expo (minus the flashy entrance) or Stark's hearing in front of the senate. There's some especially nice reverberation in Downey Jr.'s voice when he speaks on the microphones, and I'm very pleased at how much clarity and buoyancy came through. Dynamic and discrete effects from Jarvis and all the little workshop noises are on par with the previous film, though I might even be inclined to say it sounds better as a result of the balanced score. The score, by the way, is a big improvement. No disrespect to Ramin Djiwadi for his catchy riffs and rhythms from IM1, but John Debney did an outstanding job fusing both a traditional orchestral feel, as well as a contemporary rock one (thanks in big part to Tom Morello for his guitar work). But of course, the real highlight of this audio track is its riveting display of action. All sorts of weapons fire fill the soundscape in every which direction with the rears and sub getting a good portion of the home theater workout. Explosions, palladium-powered armaments and flight, landing suits of armor, and other large machinery showcase some of the finest LFEs I've heard in retrospect to screenplay and mood setting. Again, the obvious choices to use for reference are any of the action sequences mentioned above. But don't be afraid to test the Stark Expo or Senate Hearing scenes either. Fans of the film will be quite pleased with this awesome presentation.Extras - 5.0For those who really enjoy special features, this combo pack comes loaded with hours of excellent production and background information. To start, disc 1 comes with an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau, a S.H.I.E.L.D. Vault trivia database, and a P-i-P pre-viz track that can play along with the movie. The commentary makes for an extremely entertaining and informative listen. Favreau maintains a good pace with lots of useful tidbits about the filming itself, elements of the story, and the occasional anecdote. This is probably my favorite feature of all the extras, as it really changed my overall perspective of the plot and its character development, as well as reconfirming my notion that it was all a result of setting up future Avengers stuff. He never leaves a lot of dead space and sounds very enthused about the work he accomplished. The Vault is a cool novelty that can be accessed from the menu by itself or as a pop up video track during the film via Footage Scan Mode. During the film, it doesn't do much. But as a standalone feature it provides a lot of interesting trivia for this building Marvel Movie Universe. Meanwhile, the pre-viz video track is exactly what it sounds like and makes for maybe one decent sitting at most. On disc 2, we get the meat of the making-of features. Ultimate Iron Man spans almost an hour and a half and covers just about everything up through post-production. The making-of they had on IM1 was great, and I liked how consistent this felt in conjunction to this proposed trilogy. Rounding out the rest of the relevant extras is another 30 minutes of Featurettes. Here, they give some extra coverage on set design and a little bit of background info on Nick Fury, Black Widow, and War Machine. When I first heard they were going to include these, I was expecting much longer segments like the 49-minute exposition they had for Tony Stark on IM1's specials. Unfortunately, the segments for these three don't even amount to half of what they had for Stark. But despite my disappointment, I still dig the commentary enough that I won't deduct any points. It's a very recommended listen.Overall - 5.0Iron Man 2 may be something of a mixed bag for general audiences, as the greater scope of things might be a little too overwhelming. I, however, have no qualms with the direction this took and am actually quite excited to see how things will eventually tie together when all the Avengers canon is complete.

There is no one who can pull off Tony Stark like Robert Downey Jr. His portrayal is worth watching even if he never dons the suit.

1248354,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B0021L8V1G,trashcanman,"[6, 10]","The first Iron Man film still stands as the best pure superhero movie in my mind. It was like a perfect storm of awesome visuals, great cast, new and old takes on various aspects of the source material, and popcorn fun. Every single aspect of that film just struck me as exactly right. Was I looking forward to the sequel? Don't ask stupid questions. So how does the sequel fare? Read the review title, genius.  Alright, I'm sorry. I'm in a bit of a bad mood because I expected much more than I got. But here's the thing: I actually loved Iron Man 2 on some levels. But I have to face the fact that this movie was only saved by probably the most phenomenal cast I've ever seen onscreen. A well put-together film does not rely entirely on the performances of the cast, but is merely enhanced by them. Aside from the witty dialogue, too much of this production simply did not click. World peace? From one dude in a suit? How? Why? Let's see a movie about that! The likes of Celestial Being and Captain Nemo couldn't do it and their stories are pretty involved. How'd this happen? You expect the audience to buy that the world laid down their arms in response to the appearance of one superhero? Garbage. There is shockingly little action for a sequel to the brilliant origin story of the first film. The sequel's primary draw is the comedy. Most of it is excellent, but some of it is flat-out cheesy because they simply put too much of it out there. Did anybody want to see Tony Stark stumbling drunkenly around in full armor at his birthday party? Did we really want to wait until the final act to see a serious action set piece? Is it too much to ask that Rhodey have a better part to play and his relationship with Tony re-established along the way considering there's a new actor in the role? And for the love of God, I do not EVER want to see Bill O'Reilly's mug on the big screen ever again. Favreau, I'm putting you on notice. You made me throw up in my mouth a little with that one.The whole production of Iron Man 2 felt unpolished and thrown-together. It BARELY squeaks by as a worthy follow-up because it still kicks the snot out of Spider-Man 3.  Okay, I've ranted and raged about what's wrong with Iron Man 2. What's right? The cast, the cast, THE CAST! Robert Downey Jr is still brilliant as expected. Gwyneth Paltrow's endearingly flustered Pepper Potts is still strong as expected. So what else is new, right? Well, Mickey Rourke. Wow. I was not expecting that amount of coolness from the villain in this one. Rourke plays Ivan Vanko (aka Whiplash) like a Russian Danny Trejo. Covered in tats and scars, grinning sardonically, toothpick hanging out of his mouth, killer accent, and laid back as hell. This man just great to watch. He seems to have popped right out of a Tarantino flick. His benefactor is the compulsively-punchable Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a professional rival of Tony Stark and one cheesy bastard. The guy's mannerisms are so naturally geeky I almost want to cheer for him. But he's such a corny d-bag, I'd rather see him get kicked in the nuts. Either way, a fun little punching bag for the proceedings. I wanted a bigger role for the unnaturally beautiful Scarlett Johansson, but her Black Widow is primarily relegated to eye candy until the final act. Thankfully, I've never seen a more gorgeous character onscreen so the role works on that level. But would it have killed her to put on a hot accent? Natasha Romanov should have a Russian accent as a general rule. Does Samuel L Jackson need an introduction as Nick Fury (psst...he's really just playing himself as usual). All of this goodness kind of leaves Don Cheadle the odd man out, but it's alright. With all the impressive performances onboard there was no way for James Rhodes to stand out from this cast. That is, until he finally gets to rock The War Machine to the utmost. This takes too long to happen. Stupid, crappy pacing.Is that the longest I've ever raved about a cast? I think it is. Well, when we finally get the big action throwdown we've been waiting for it's awesome, but it's over fast. I guess they didn't want to pay ILM any overtime. Boo. But the dialogue and the actors are so strong that these things are surprisingly easy to overlook. I seriously wonder how much of that stuff was improvised because it just seems so completely natural it's hard to believe it was written and performed. That is the highest praise, really. The soundtrack drops plenty of Clash on you along with some James Brown, Queen, Tupac, and of course AC/DC. One could do worse. Not in love with the end credits though. Oh, and if thee hath plans on leaving before the credits are through, I say thee nay! Marvel's got something for you. Seeds are sewn for the upcoming Avengers film along the way including a special part for a certain star-spangled deflection device that the frame-by-framers spotted in the background of the first film. Well played, Mr. Faveau. Well played. The thin story may have been better if it had focused more on Stark working with SHIELD as an anti-terrorism agent and utilized Black Widow as more of a double agent whose allegiance is in doubt. Would have been much more Marvel, much less Hollywood, more action-packed, and even potentially socially relevant. Woulda, coulda, shoulda.Iron Man 2 clearly fails to live up to the credentials of it's flawless predecessor. In fact, it's almost like a really lengthy and really cool commercial for Marvel's next projects. I expected much, much better from the man who made my favorite superhero movie ever but what I got was better than acceptable all things considered. I didn't leave the theater angry and aside from being assaulted by a raving FOX News lunatic bad-mouthing Miss Potts, nothing about this sequel really made me want to rip the director a new one. If you weren't thrilled by the first film, I wouldn't rush out to by this blind; and to the rest, keep your expectations in check and you should emerge relatively unscathed if not impressed.3 1/2

It's packed with necessary features, and it looks absolutely fantastic.  This purchase rekindled my love for blu-ray, and I'm impressed with Paramount and Marvel's efforts.  In a world filled with useless special features, Iron Man 2 gives us what we really want, although I still want more.The film has its problems, but its definately solid.  Some of the logic is absent, the plotwork thin, but the actors sell it and its nearly nonstop fun.  It dips a little bit in the middle, but all of its fanboy treats made me fall in love with the film.  I praise this film for squeezing great bits out from the Marvel universe, while still holding back a lot of big guns.  The film gave me a fun Iron Man vs. Villain story, while still introducing me to a few new cherished Marvel characters.  The biggest impact from Iron Man 2 is the undeniable tension it gives in me stemming from my desire to travel through time to see Thor, Captain America, and Avengers.  Iron Man 2 is a great film on its own, but what I love about it most, is that it promises a great future.As I stated earlier, the blu-ray is worth your money.  Thankfully only one commentary exists (I'm tired of seeing the movie 5 times to learn all the secrets).  And its backed up by blocky behind-the-scenes featurettes.  I praised the second transformers movie, however flawed it was, for having a great blu-ray release.  Paramount knows how to give people what they want in their purchase.  Universal needs to abandon the U-control and get on board with what Paramount and Sony are providing.*******Easter Egg*****Watch the end of ""Building a Legacy"" on disc 2.  You will be awarded, after the credits, with a clip of Thor filming.  It contains an interview with the comic writing genius Michael J. Straczynski, and his humbled love for the film.  I literally raised my legs and started kicking like a little girl.Good film, great blu-ray.  The film itself gave me all that I wanted, however sloppy it may have delivered it, and the blu-ray just nailed it.  The only thing I request in the next installment is that they give more logical reasoning for the plot.  The element creation plot, was a little hard to swallow for a chem major, and I don't think they'll be able to sell it with jokes next time.

What kind of a hero is he going to be and will he destroy himself in the process.This movie of course is only a small portion of what is on the way and now it is no longer a secret. In this movie Iron Man is being taken on by villains and heroes alike. There is a new villain out there who apparently had some connections with Tony's dad wants revenge. Because of his extra fame as an industrialist and a super-hero Nick Fury is trying to make sure that he doesn't get out of control even if it means taking him off the roster of the Avengers.I really can't figure out how to put this review together because that is pretty much what the movie was like. It was a great deal of fun, but it was very much reminiscent of a Jackson Pollock. Just throw your characters to the canvas and hopefully a story will pop out of it. Well thankfully the humor and the great action sequences were able to keep the crowd interested and the movie did make quite a large amount in the box office. Still, in my opinion Marvel has to keep their heads on strait and stick to the plan ahead. There is a monster movie franchise brewing here and if they keep putting together movies like Iron Man 2 people will get very skeptical about the future projects.",3,"A follow up...not decent, but not terrible.

1248369,A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B0021L8V1G,W. freeman,"[1, 2]","I just actually watched the first Iron Man for the first time this year, mainly because i thought the second one actually looked pretty good. I just really didn't even pay attention when the first was released because comic book films just really aren't my thing. The first was good, not stellar, but great effects a decent story, the very cocky Tony Stark whom you can't help but like, and good action. The second film starts out rather slowly, with a few action sequences here and there, and Mickey Rourke playing the bad man as usual. Rourke is fantastic in most films i've seen him in, this one is an exception as he has little to no dialogue because he is Russian. I wanted to see him a bit more verbal, and also doing more than just working on robots.Don Cheadle is a nice addition this time around, and definitely a better actor than the previous guy. Where the films falls flat is its pace, its very back and forth with moments of boredom and other moments where you sit up and take notice. The funny moments really aren't funny, and the sarcasm really isn't nearly as good as in the first film. Stark's cockiness really gets pretty annoying in the beginning of the film, but then takes a back seat for an apparent reason about half way through the film. As far as a story, well there's were it hits rock bottom, there is none. There is only one new revelation to be revealed in the film to make you go ohhh ok cool, thats about it. Other than that its just the basic good guy against bad guy, good guy thinks bad guy is dead, he's not, then back for one last round. That being said the biggest part of the action is only in the last 33 minutes or so of the film, and its just not really that interesting.The last battle sequence was also very short and disappointing as well, leaving you wanting more. Most films go over the top with it's drawn out endings but i thought this film needed it after an hour and a half of mediocrity. So this was a semi-blockbuster, but not nearly as much as the first, not to keep bring up that point but it was a lot more original. I also watched The Incredible Hulk(2008) and thought it was about 10 times better than this film. Also at the end of it Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) makes an appearance at the end making it like he will take care of the Incredible Hulk(problem) right at the end of the film. I've seen nothing in the works, but that would be quite a match-up, or a good nemesis. So lets hope there is not an Iron Man 3, but perhaps a vs type deal in the future. While the acting is good and its got all the elements to be a good film the Iron Man suit feels a little rusty this time around. As i said, good but lacking.Also on one last note, why they do this i have no clue. Many films today show parts in previews that are NOT in the film. The part of the preview where Gweneth Paltrow is talking to R.D Jr., she gets annoyed and throws his helmet out of the plane, he says ""you complete me"" then jumps out. Its not in the film at all, at least not the one i watched.

The fast patter and winning wisecracks usually carry the movie when the comic-book effects don't - and there are some great effects. Paltrow's character, 'Pepper' Potts comes across with the right urgency and sincerity. Scarlett Johansson's spy babe fits that black catsuit flawlessly. Tony Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, creates a spoiled, whiny character with too much money for his own good - the kind you love to dislike, since he's not even evil enough to hate. And, of course, Mickey Rourke's 'Vanko' makes an electrifying badguy.Despite the great comic book styling, a few things fell flat. Comic book outsiders will scratch their heads over Nick Fury and SHIELD (""huh? where'd that come from?""). Everyone will scratch their heads over Potts's sudden promotion, once they see how Stark seems to undermine her (or try to) every time she tries to get the new job done. And, despite hints that he's not really as out of control as he seems, Stark being that out of control is just out of character - even RDJr's free-wheeling character.But, c'mon. You don't go to comic book movies for deep motivation or exploration of the human soul.
