I don't usually enjoy watching something so brutal but I am a die hard Tim Roth fan and his acting is always superb.  This movie certainly isn't for everyone but I it's always worth seeing anything Tim Roth has done.Sorry, I can't add more as the movie consisted mostly of brutality and I saw it quite awhile ago.I just thought of ""Funny Games"", where Tim Roth had a small role, but his pain was very convincing.  It was entirely different, but there was terrible violence and i read that he regretted making this film for that reason.  It also showed much cruelty  ""No way Home"", showed cruelty on the part of his brother, but in the end Tim Roth was a survivor.  I realize, this is my opinion, more than a review, but as i stated earlier. these were seen ages ago.""

I would love to see it again as I don't remember much from it except that I thought it was really good at the time I watched it.  I had never heard of the Charles Starkweather/Caril Ann Fugate murders until after I saw this film.  I remember thinking that for a made-for-TV movie, this one is startlingly good and doesn't have any of the corniness or cheap-looking production typically associated with made-for-TV productions (I think this might be considered a miniseries, not a movie).  I've been looking for a DVD copy for several years now, but they don't seem to be in too big of a hurry to release it on DVD.

195932,AU5EY70IW8N6H,5552177169,LadyMohan,"[1, 1]","Murder in the Heartland (1993)The television miniseries aired on ABC in 1993. It was based on the 1957 murder spree carried out by 19 year-old Charles Starkweather throughout Nebraska and Wyoming. The first half of the miniseries covers the murders, and the second half covers the trial and the separate accounts given by Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate, his 14 year-old girlfriend.The film received strong praise from critics and multiple Emmy nominations.Making the FilmThe inspiration for Murder in the Heartland came from both Terrence Malick's 1973 film Badlands (with Sissy Spacek), and Bruce Springsteen's 1982 album Nebraska.The entire film was shot on location in, and around, Dallas, Texas.Brian Dennehy was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Special. Ronald Victor Garcia was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography.(source for the above: Wikipedia).Killing 11 people including toddler, they were eventually captured on the highway outside Douglas, Wyoming. Tried and convicted of murder, Charles Starkweather was executed at the Nebraska State Penitentiary on June 25, 1959. Also convicted, Caril Fugate's initial life sentence was commuted to a 30 to 50 year sentence in 1973. In 1976, after serving 18 years, Fugate was paroled and she eventually resettled in Michigan.  The Starkweather case, seemingly tame in comparison to serial killings that have followed it in subsequent years, was one of the most heavily publicized mass murders in U.S. history, drawing national attention both to Nebraska and to the psychological issues surrounding disaffected youth. The community of Lincoln, and most of the rest of Nebraska, lived in a near-constant state of hysteria and panic for most of a week. (source: Lincoln City Libraries - The Starkweather Case).Both Fairuza Balk and Tim Roth did a wonderful job as the two fugitives in this TV MiniSeries.  Tim Roth gave such a convincing performance, I really felt I hated him!!  Truly a sign of excellent acting!  This movie introduced me to Charles Startweather and what happened in the badlands of Nebraska/Wyoming in the late 1950s.It really does leave you struggling over how a 19 year old could truly kill in order to remembered as ""someone,"" and whether Caril Ann Fugate a willing participant, or at least, at what point did she finally have enough?  Also, did she truly believe her family dead all the time she was with Starkweather on his killing spree, where she claimed to ""just go along for the ride,"" or did she truly not know?In this movie I didn't see her as 14 year old child hostage/kidnap victim, but someone who did eventually know what was happening and had opportunities to try harder to alert others for help...and didn't seem disturbed enough after she would witness him killing in front of her, or insist enough that Charlie take her home (beleiving her parents were alive), as she claimed on the witness stand.  She was deservingly be tried as an adult.  But Fairuza Balk does a wonderful job in provoking some feeling of sympathy for her character Caril...when we journey with her though the legal system we once again remember she is indeed just 14 years old, and all alone.  Her portrayal of Fugate gives us reason to question highly Starkweather's account of how involved she truly was in the actual killing of 2 people as he claimed, pondering how influnced 14 year old could be by a 19 year old outlaw who claims to love her when given the ""right"" circumstances.Another terrific program detailing this case more closely is A & E's American Justice - ""Spree Killers,"" where it examines every detail of the case and gives insight to the nature of violence in America.",5,Highly Recommended,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,3717,"['Murder', 'Heartland', '1993', 'television', 'miniseries', 'aired', 'ABC', '1993', 'was', 'based', '1957', 'murder', 'spree', 'carried', '19', 'year-old', 'Charles', 'Starkweather', 'Nebraska', 'Wyoming', 'first', 'half', 'miniseries', 'murders', 'second', 'half', 'trial', 'separate', 'accounts', 'given', 'Starkweather', 'Caril', 'Ann', 'Fugate', '14', 'year-old', 'girlfriend.The', 'film', 'received', 'strong', 'praise', 'critics', 'multiple', 'Emmy', 'nominations.Making', 'FilmThe', 'inspiration', 'Murder', 'Heartland', 'came', 'Terrence', 'Malick', '1973', 'film', 'Badlands', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', '1982', 'album', 'Nebraska.The', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'around', 'Dallas', 'Texas.Brian', 'Dennehy', 'was', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Outstanding', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Miniseries', 'Special', 'Ronald', 'Victor', 'Garcia', 'was', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Outstanding', 'Cinematography', 'source', 'above', 'Wikipedia', '.Killing', '11', 'people', 'including', 'toddler', 'were', 'eventually', 'captured', 'highway', 'Douglas', 'Wyoming', 'Tried', 'convicted', 'murder', 'Charles', 'Starkweather', 'was', 'executed', 'Nebraska', 'State', 'Penitentiary', 'June', '25', '1959', 'Also', 'convicted', 'Caril', 'Fugate', 'initial', 'life', 'sentence', 'was', 'commuted', '30', '50', 'year', 'sentence', '1973', '1976', 'serving', '18', 'years', 'Fugate', 'was', 'paroled', 'eventually', 'resettled', 'Michigan', 'Starkweather', 'case', 'seemingly', 'tame', 'comparison', 'serial', 'killings', 'have', 'followed', 'subsequent', 'years', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'heavily', 'publicized', 'mass', 'murders', 'U.S.', 'history', 'drawing', 'national', 'attention', 'Nebraska', 'psychological', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'disaffected', 'youth', 'community', 'Lincoln', 'most', 'rest', 'Nebraska', 'lived', 'near-constant', 'state', 'hysteria', 'panic', 'most', 'week', 'source', 'Lincoln', 'City', 'Libraries', 'Starkweather', 'Case', '.Both', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'two', 'fugitives', 'TV', 'MiniSeries', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'gave', 'convincing', 'performance', 'really', 'felt', 'hated', 'Truly', 'sign', 'excellent', 'acting', 'movie', 'introduced', 'Charles', 'Startweather', 'what', 'happened', 'badlands', 'Nebraska/Wyoming', 'late', '1950s.It', 'really', 'leave', 'struggling', 'how', '19', 'year', 'old', 'could', 'truly', 'kill', 'order', 'remembered', 'someone', 'Caril', 'Ann', 'Fugate', 'willing', 'participant', 'least', 'what', 'point', 'did', 'finally', 'have', 'enough', 'Also', 'did', 'truly', 'believe', 'family', 'dead', 'time', 'was', 'Starkweather', 'killing', 'spree', 'where', 'claimed', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'did', 'truly', 'not', 'know', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '14', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'hostage/kidnap', 'victim', 'someone', 'who', 'did', 'eventually', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'had', 'opportunities', 'try', 'harder', 'alert', 'others', 'help', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'disturbed', 'enough', 'would', 'witness', 'killing', 'front', 'insist', 'enough', 'Charlie', 'take', 'home', 'beleiving', 'parents', 'were', 'alive', 'claimed', 'witness', 'stand', 'was', 'deservingly', 'be', 'tried', 'adult', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'wonderful', 'job', 'provoking', 'feeling', 'sympathy', 'character', 'Caril', 'when', 'journey', 'legal', 'system', 'once', 'again', 'remember', 'indeed', 'just', '14', 'years', 'old', 'alone', 'portrayal', 'Fugate', 'reason', 'question', 'highly', 'Starkweather', 'account', 'how', 'involved', 'truly', 'was', 'actual', 'killing', '2', 'people', 'claimed', 'pondering', 'how', 'influnced', '14', 'year', 'old', 'could', 'be', '19', 'year', 'old', 'outlaw', 'who', 'love', 'when', 'given', 'right', 'circumstances.Another', 'terrific', 'program', 'detailing', 'case', 'more', 'closely', 'A', 'E', 'American', 'Justice', 'Spree', 'Killers', 'where', 'detail', 'case', 'insight', 'nature', 'violence', 'America']",N/A

At the time Dwight Eisenhower was President of the United States and Elvis Presley was King of Rock & Roll.This movie first aired on ABC back in 1993 as a two-part series.  Part One was about the murders committed by Charles Starkweather and fleeing from the law.  And Part Two was about the arrests and trials with Charles Starkweather and his 14-year-old girlfriend Caril Ann Fugate.  The following times it aired on television were on the Lifetime channels of either Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Channel.  Last time was aired on either one of those channels was 2004.This story took place between the Autumn of 1957, to the date of Charles Starkweather's death sentence on June 25, 1959 in my hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska.One thing that questions me.  Why is this historical movie about Charles Starkweather in Lincoln, Nebraska not on DVD?  It was a very good TV movie and I believe that actor Tim Roth really brought out the character that Charles Starkweather was, to all television viewers.
