1010317,AYUO4QC08QQ4C,B000H5V8H2,"A. M. Steiner ""Huskarl1066""","[2, 3]","The film begins with Sophie Scholl and friend breaking two laws.  I do not think this fact occurred to the usual audience, nor even the director.  But in National Socialist Germany, listening to broadcasts from the UK, and listening to Schwingmusik would have gotten you an extended stay in the Dachau motel.  Such people were labeled Schwingjunge (Swing Youth).  It was against the law to listen to swing music or Schraegemusik (jazz).  Especially if they have Jewish, or Negro influence.  That sort of entertainment was not considered appropriate for German Kultur.My next point.  Sophie opened a dresser drawer, and one sees a P.08 (Luger).  It was not against the law in Nazi Germany to have or own pistols, unless you were a Jew, or a Communist.  To be legal, one merely applied for a Waffenschein.(weapon permit).  In 1919, Adolf Hitler, was issued a Waffenschein to carry a pistol, while he went undercover for the Bavarian Army, to spy on the DAP.  The DAP later was taken under Hitler's wing as the NSDAP (Nazi Party).  Hitler did not outlaw the posession of private firearms, as the less than informed would like to postulate.Point three.  The German communist female Else in Sophie's cell. I am not sure what she was doing in the Stadelheim Prison.  Crimes against the state were dealt with quite effectively in the Dachau KZL.  The initial head of Dachau named Theodor Eiche had colour coded triangles to show the guards instantly the nature of the inmates crime.  Jews wore yellow, Communists red, and Homosexuals pink triangles!  Another fact unknown to most, is that Dachau also had inmates who were former members of the SS.  I do know know if the Else character was historical, but Communists were ruthlessly dealt with in the KZ system.  After the Great War ended, there were over 400 political parties in Germany (right, left, and centre).  By the time Hitler came to power in 1933, the two strongest parties in Germany were, the Nazis, and the Communists.  To the ordinary German, there was but one choice.  Hitler was the constitutionally elected head of state, and after that, he took it from there.  Another interesting note, was the Adolf's real family name was not Hitler, but Hiedler.  His grandfather had had an affair with Hitler's grandmother, while she was married to Hitler's great uncle! A bit of a family scandal.Roland Freisler...He was a piece of work.  Hans Scholl accused him of not having been on the Eastfront.  That was not exactly correct.  Freisler was on the Russian Front during the Great War, and had received the E.K I and E.K. II, and was captured and sent to a POW camp.  There was talk of him being a Bolshie, and prehaps he overcompensating (as an apostate) by the sentences handed out.  One is reminded of Judge Lynch in British History.My next point is, regardless of what people think these days of Nazi Germany, the White Rose, and the von Stauffenberg crew were traitors againt the legitimate elected head of state.  As far as the White Rose was concerned, such printed material, and behavior would have gotten you hanged, totally castrated, disembowelled, quartered, and finally beheaded in Elizabethan England, all the way up to the reign of King George II.  Try that in Stalinist Russia and you would just disappear.My last point...the execution.  Many folks may have been shocked to see die Fallbeil (the falling hatchet).  The machine was called die Fallbeil in Germany; not Guillotine.  The Scots had one from the Middle Ages, as well as the Germans, which was locally called the Maiden.  But the standard form of execution in Bavaria until the 1920's was beheading with a hand held axe.  It the obvious that die Fallbeil appealed to German efficiency.Lastly, I should like to say, I think the movie was wonderfully done, with great acting, production, and direction all around.  It was rather haunting.  If the records are accurate, Sophie should have taken the way out offered her by Inspector Robert Mohr.  It all boiled down to all the people in the White Rose were betrayed to the authorities by the idiotic behavior of Hans Scholl.  I cannot recommend this movie more highly.  It is moving, and full of suspense.",5,Beautifully acted!,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,4179,"['film', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'friend', 'breaking', 'two', 'laws', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'fact', 'occurred', 'usual', 'audience', 'even', 'director', 'National', 'Socialist', 'Germany', 'listening', 'broadcasts', 'UK', 'listening', 'Schwingmusik', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'extended', 'stay', 'Dachau', 'motel', 'Such', 'people', 'were', 'labeled', 'Schwingjunge', 'Swing', 'Youth', 'was', 'law', 'listen', 'swing', 'music', 'Schraegemusik', 'jazz', 'Especially', 'have', 'Jewish', 'Negro', 'influence', 'sort', 'entertainment', 'was', 'not', 'considered', 'appropriate', 'German', 'Kultur.My', 'next', 'point', 'Sophie', 'opened', 'dresser', 'drawer', 'one', 'P.08', 'Luger', 'was', 'not', 'law', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'have', 'own', 'pistols', 'were', 'Jew', 'Communist', 'be', 'legal', 'one', 'merely', 'applied', 'Waffenschein', 'permit', '1919', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'was', 'issued', 'Waffenschein', 'carry', 'pistol', 'went', 'undercover', 'Bavarian', 'Army', 'spy', 'DAP', 'DAP', 'later', 'was', 'taken', 'Hitler', 'wing', 'NSDAP', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'Hitler', 'did', 'not', 'outlaw', 'posession', 'private', 'firearms', 'less', 'informed', 'would', 'like', 'postulate.Point', 'three', 'German', 'communist', 'female', 'Else', 'Sophie', 'cell', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Stadelheim', 'Prison', 'Crimes', 'state', 'were', 'dealt', 'quite', 'effectively', 'Dachau', 'KZL', 'initial', 'head', 'Dachau', 'named', 'Theodor', 'Eiche', 'had', 'colour', 'coded', 'triangles', 'show', 'guards', 'instantly', 'nature', 'inmates', 'crime', 'Jews', 'wore', 'yellow', 'Communists', 'red', 'Homosexuals', 'pink', 'triangles', 'fact', 'unknown', 'most', 'Dachau', 'also', 'had', 'inmates', 'who', 'were', 'former', 'members', 'SS', 'do', 'know', 'know', 'Else', 'character', 'was', 'historical', 'Communists', 'were', 'ruthlessly', 'dealt', 'KZ', 'system', 'Great', 'War', 'ended', 'were', '400', 'political', 'parties', 'Germany', 'right', 'left', 'centre', 'time', 'Hitler', 'came', 'power', '1933', 'two', 'strongest', 'parties', 'Germany', 'were', 'Nazis', 'Communists', 'ordinary', 'German', 'was', 'one', 'choice', 'Hitler', 'was', 'constitutionally', 'elected', 'head', 'state', 'took', 'there', 'interesting', 'note', 'was', 'Adolf', 'real', 'family', 'name', 'was', 'not', 'Hitler', 'Hiedler', 'grandfather', 'had', 'had', 'affair', 'Hitler', 'grandmother', 'was', 'married', 'Hitler', 'great', 'uncle', 'bit', 'family', 'scandal.Roland', 'Freisler', 'was', 'piece', 'work', 'Hans', 'Scholl', 'accused', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'Eastfront', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'correct', 'Freisler', 'was', 'Russian', 'Front', 'Great', 'War', 'had', 'received', 'E.K', 'E.K', 'II', 'was', 'captured', 'sent', 'POW', 'camp', 'was', 'talk', 'being', 'Bolshie', 'prehaps', 'overcompensating', 'apostate', 'sentences', 'handed', 'out', 'One', 'reminded', 'Judge', 'Lynch', 'British', 'History.My', 'next', 'point', 'regardless', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'days', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'White', 'Rose', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'crew', 'were', 'traitors', 'againt', 'legitimate', 'elected', 'head', 'state', 'As', 'far', 'White', 'Rose', 'was', 'concerned', 'such', 'printed', 'material', 'behavior', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'hanged', 'totally', 'castrated', 'disembowelled', 'quartered', 'finally', 'beheaded', 'Elizabethan', 'England', 'way', 'reign', 'King', 'George', 'II', 'Try', 'Stalinist', 'Russia', 'would', 'just', 'disappear.My', 'last', 'point', 'execution', 'Many', 'folks', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'shocked', 'see', 'die', 'Fallbeil', 'falling', 'hatchet', 'machine', 'was', 'called', 'die', 'Fallbeil', 'Germany', 'not', 'Guillotine', 'Scots', 'had', 'one', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'as', 'well', 'Germans', 'was', 'locally', 'called', 'Maiden', 'standard', 'form', 'execution', 'Bavaria', '1920', 'was', 'beheading', 'hand', 'held', 'axe', 'obvious', 'die', 'Fallbeil', 'appealed', 'German', 'efficiency.Lastly', 'should', 'like', 'say', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'great', 'acting', 'production', 'direction', 'around', 'was', 'rather', 'haunting', 'records', 'are', 'accurate', 'Sophie', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'way', 'offered', 'Inspector', 'Robert', 'Mohr', 'boiled', 'down', 'people', 'White', 'Rose', 'were', 'betrayed', 'authorities', 'idiotic', 'behavior', 'Hans', 'Scholl', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'more', 'highly', 'moving', 'full', 'suspense']",N/A
1010318,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000H5V8H2,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","An intense and powerful film indeed, `Sophie Scholl: The Final Days' is simple and subtle and extremely focused in a way that demands the attention of the viewer and pulverizes their emotions in a gradual way; slowly creeping up on us in a way that truly sinks into our skin.  It appears that Nazi films are a dime a dozen these days, especially in foreign cinema, but `Sophie Scholl' is something special.  It focuses on a solitary moment within, basically, a solitary room.  It puts the hero in front of the villain in a very straightforward and precise way, no buffers allowed.This is a very `good versus evil' type film.The film tells the story of young Sophie Scholl and her brother, Hans who are arrested and charged with treason after they distribute anti-war leaflets around their university while class is in session.  Sadly, an act of impulse (Sophie thrusts a stack off a ledge so that the leaflets will cascade over the students billowing out of their classrooms) causes the two freedom fighters to be seen and contained by the authorities.  Soon they find themselves separated and interrogated and, with swift action, they are placed before a court to receive their condemnation.A true story, `Sophie Scholl' chills the bones with its authenticity and accuracy, every detail laid out before us with expertise.The film itself is truly inspired, and it is embellished by the marvelous performances it contains.  Most notably are those of young Julia Jentsch and Gerald Alexander Held.  Held is remarkably three-dimensional as the Nazi interrogator who forms a seeming admiration and even pity for young Sophie.  As he questions and degrades and frustratingly berates her, you can see his countenance shift as she explains herself with such poise and grace and wisdom.  He respects her because she believes in what she is fighting for, and he knows that she makes sense.  He is a coward, and he wishes to be more like that young woman sitting across from him.  As Sophie, Jentsch is astonishing.  She holds herself with such power, allowing the confidence in her cause to show through in all over action.  She holds her own in a way that captivates the audience and corrals us at her side.  But, she isn't just a wall of strength.  As the film progresses and her fate lingers over her head, we can see her begin to crumble emotionally.  Her face betrays her strength and eventually she is left in her cell to collapse under the strain.She is flawless.In the end, I highly recommend this powerful film.  It grabs you in the heart and socks you in the gut.  When all is said and done, this is a film you won't soon forget.",5,These final days will chill you...,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,2630,"['intense', 'powerful', 'film', 'indeed', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'Final', 'Days', 'simple', 'subtle', 'extremely', 'focused', 'way', 'attention', 'viewer', 'pulverizes', 'emotions', 'gradual', 'way', 'slowly', 'creeping', 'up', 'way', 'truly', 'sinks', 'skin', 'Nazi', 'films', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'days', 'especially', 'foreign', 'cinema', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'something', 'special', 'solitary', 'moment', 'basically', 'solitary', 'room', 'hero', 'front', 'villain', 'very', 'straightforward', 'precise', 'way', 'buffers', 'allowed.This', 'very', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'type', 'film.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'brother', 'Hans', 'who', 'are', 'arrested', 'charged', 'treason', 'distribute', 'anti-war', 'leaflets', 'university', 'class', 'session', 'Sadly', 'act', 'impulse', 'Sophie', 'stack', 'off', 'ledge', 'so', 'leaflets', 'will', 'cascade', 'students', 'billowing', 'classrooms', 'two', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'be', 'seen', 'contained', 'authorities', 'Soon', 'find', 'separated', 'interrogated', 'swift', 'action', 'are', 'placed', 'court', 'receive', 'condemnation.A', 'true', 'story', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'chills', 'bones', 'authenticity', 'accuracy', 'detail', 'laid', 'out', 'expertise.The', 'film', 'truly', 'inspired', 'embellished', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'Most', 'notably', 'are', 'young', 'Julia', 'Jentsch', 'Gerald', 'Alexander', 'Held', 'Held', 'remarkably', 'three-dimensional', 'Nazi', 'interrogator', 'who', 'seeming', 'admiration', 'even', 'pity', 'young', 'Sophie', 'questions', 'degrades', 'frustratingly', 'can', 'see', 'countenance', 'shift', 'such', 'poise', 'grace', 'wisdom', 'what', 'fighting', 'sense', 'coward', 'be', 'more', 'young', 'woman', 'sitting', 'Sophie', 'Jentsch', 'astonishing', 'such', 'power', 'allowing', 'confidence', 'cause', 'show', 'action', 'own', 'way', 'audience', 'corrals', 'side', ""n't"", 'just', 'wall', 'strength', 'film', 'progresses', 'fate', 'lingers', 'head', 'can', 'see', 'begin', 'crumble', 'emotionally', 'face', 'strength', 'eventually', 'left', 'cell', 'collapse', 'strain.She', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'powerful', 'film', 'heart', 'socks', 'gut', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",N/A
1010319,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000H5V8H2,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","It's rare when a movie delivers such a powerful lesson in history as this one.  I'd not been aware of the White Rose non-violent resistance to the Nazi regime until seeing this film.  Indeed, the full story of White Rose hadn't been known until original source material surfaced after the fall of East Germany in late 1989.What struck me was the sheer bravery of the movement's young leaders, the brilliantly staged rendition of the Nazi show trial that followed their arrests and the finality of the quick, shocking punishment that is meted out.  In particular, the show trial scene is movie-making of the highest order with a knockout Downfall-esque performance by Andr&eacute; Hennicke as Richter Dr. Roland Freisler.  The production design, too, is worthy of special note - the courtroom in the trial scene is spectacularly staged.The film also serves as evidence that not all Germans marched in enthusiastic lockstep to the Nazi war machine.  Reviews accompanying the film's 2005 release relate that German audiences reacted very positively to the film, perhaps because it demonstrated the courage and dissent alive in the populace at that time.  Stars Julia Jentsch and Fabian Hinrichs (as Sophie's brother Hans) beautifully convey the passion, innocence and bravery of the Scholls.It was only six days between arrest and conclusion.

1010320,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B000H5V8H2,Anyechka,"[1, 1]","This is a truly powerful historical drama, and demonstrates just what a hero Sophie Scholl was.  While it's true that she wasn't as deeply involved in the White Rose as her older brother Hans, she did play a role in the group and ended up paying the ultimate price for her convictions.  Why the filmmakers chose to focus on her instead of Hans is irrelevant when thinking about how this was a young person with the courage of her convictions.  Though there's a popular image of the Germans as either standing by idly or actively supporting the Nazis, the actions of the young people in the White Rose prove that there were those who were not apathetic, who were prepared to put it all on the line for the sake of freedom and the truth.  If only more people had been unafraid to speak out and do something as did Sophie, Hans, and their friend Christoph Probst, the Nazis might never have risen to power, or they might have been overthrown before WWII ended so disastrously for them.Under interrogation and in court, Sophie shows incredible dignity, integrity, composure, class, grace, and courage.  She doesn't break down in tears or start naming names, not wanting to give these interrogators and judges the satisfaction of breaking her down, nor does she want to betray friends just to save her own life or get an easier punishment.  One can kill a person, but an idea, if powerful and meaningful enough, can never be killed.  And though the judge is a raving madman (the same way the real-life judge behaves in the archival footage shown on the other side of the disc), all of the interrogators, police, and jailers are portrayed as almost logical and intelligent, not cold unfeeling people devoid of all human emotion.  It shows how ordinary people comprised the bulk of the Nazis, not unfeeling inhuman monsters, which makes their takeover of Germany seem even more frightening.  And though this isn't a major part of the film, it's also admirable how Sophie keeps her religious faith right up till the end.  Some people might find it a bit boring because there aren't really an action shots, but this story was not an action story.  It needs that static camera because the bulk of the action takes place inside of rooms, and in spite of how the camera is primarily stationary, the drama and emotion come out full-force.  I was particularly moved by the final few scenes.Extras are deleted and alternate scenes, the trailer, a behind-the-scenes look at the film's production, a few interviews with people who knew or were associated with Sophie (among them one of her sisters; I thought it was a little talk show-esque how she went on to marry the man Sophie had been engaged to), and actual footage from the trial, though not featuring Sophie or Hans.",5,A powerful experience,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,2757,"['truly', 'powerful', 'historical', 'drama', 'just', 'what', 'hero', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'was', 'true', 'was', ""n't"", 'deeply', 'involved', 'White', 'Rose', 'older', 'brother', 'Hans', 'did', 'play', 'role', 'group', 'ended', 'up', 'paying', 'ultimate', 'price', 'convictions', 'Why', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'focus', 'instead', 'Hans', 'irrelevant', 'when', 'thinking', 'how', 'was', 'young', 'person', 'courage', 'convictions', 'popular', 'image', 'Germans', 'standing', 'idly', 'actively', 'supporting', 'Nazis', 'actions', 'young', 'people', 'White', 'Rose', 'prove', 'were', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'apathetic', 'who', 'were', 'prepared', 'put', 'line', 'sake', 'freedom', 'truth', 'only', 'more', 'people', 'had', 'been', 'unafraid', 'speak', 'out', 'do', 'something', 'did', 'Sophie', 'Hans', 'friend', 'Christoph', 'Probst', 'Nazis', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'risen', 'power', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'overthrown', 'WWII', 'ended', 'so', 'disastrously', 'them.Under', 'interrogation', 'court', 'Sophie', 'incredible', 'dignity', 'integrity', 'composure', 'class', 'grace', 'courage', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'tears', 'start', 'naming', 'names', 'not', 'wanting', 'give', 'interrogators', 'judges', 'satisfaction', 'breaking', 'down', 'want', 'betray', 'friends', 'just', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'get', 'easier', 'punishment', 'One', 'can', 'kill', 'person', 'idea', 'powerful', 'meaningful', 'enough', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'killed', 'judge', 'raving', 'madman', 'same', 'way', 'real-life', 'judge', 'behaves', 'archival', 'footage', 'shown', 'other', 'side', 'disc', 'interrogators', 'police', 'jailers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'logical', 'intelligent', 'not', 'cold', 'unfeeling', 'people', 'devoid', 'human', 'emotion', 'how', 'ordinary', 'people', 'comprised', 'bulk', 'Nazis', 'not', 'unfeeling', 'inhuman', 'monsters', 'takeover', 'Germany', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'frightening', ""n't"", 'major', 'part', 'film', 'also', 'admirable', 'how', 'Sophie', 'religious', 'faith', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'boring', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'action', 'shots', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'action', 'story', 'static', 'camera', 'bulk', 'action', 'place', 'rooms', 'spite', 'how', 'camera', 'primarily', 'stationary', 'drama', 'emotion', 'come', 'out', 'full-force', 'was', 'particularly', 'moved', 'final', 'few', 'scenes.Extras', 'are', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'film', 'production', 'few', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'were', 'associated', 'Sophie', 'one', 'sisters', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'talk', 'show-esque', 'how', 'went', 'marry', 'man', 'Sophie', 'had', 'been', 'engaged', 'actual', 'footage', 'trial', 'not', 'featuring', 'Sophie', 'Hans']",N/A

If voters under forty had been the only ones counted, she (and her brother) would have been number one!  Another magazine's readers voted Sophie Scholl ""the greatest woman of the twentieth century.""  Christianity Today said, ""she deserves a place alongside history's most revered and celebrated Christian women.""  The executioner was an eighth-generation German hangman who had killed 3,000 people, but was quoted as saying that he had never seen people going to their death as free and upright as Sophie Scholl and the other members of the White Rose had done.  Clearly, Sophie's Christian faith was far more important in her that was depicted in the movie; indeed, I grade the movie down 1/2 grade because it fails to present a solid reason for her strength of character, especially when facing death.  One can be thankful that the atheist director of the film did show a couple of scenes of heartfelt prayer, where Sophie shows both her trust in Christ and her dependence on Him for strength to face whatever was coming.This is a movie that should be seen by every young person old enough to read the subtitles.  For traditional values families, it presents a great opportunity to discuss a nation's current 'politically correct' so-called morality, and compare that with what could be called Biblical or even eternal morality.  I don't know how a parent could help a child make the next step, to become so committed to the eternal truth as to be willing to die for it.  Maybe, such a person isn't just raised that way; he or she is chosen by God Himself and given divine strength.  However such faith happens, however, the seeds have to be planted, hopefully, by the child's parents and Church.  The movie also shows that she clearly, some day, expected to be reunited with her family in Heaven.

To say that she seems to have captured this woman in all her youth and spirit is to write a cliche.  She renders the bravery, courage, doubt and fear that this woman had top struggle against in her final days with art, skill and respect.Perhaps the most moving scene is the final scene in the movie, where Sophie is led into the room where the guillotine awaits.  No queen could ever muster as much dignity as Ms. Jentsch conveys in this brief, horrifying, end.  And this is true to the historical record, as Sophie's executioner would later attest.This movie asks is all what we would have done in similar circumstances.  For unlike SCHINDLER'S LIST, we do not have the wealth, the connections, the what-have-you to distance ourselves from a character in a story whose moral dimensions encompass the universe.  SOPHIE SCHOLL asks us what we would do if we were young and beautiful and 21 and able to think for ourselves.

It consists almost entirely of a depiction of Sophie Scholl's interrogation after her arrest for distributing anti-nazi leaflets around her Munich University campus. The interrogation is not brutal, rather more a psychological game in which the Nazi seems almost to be aware of the truth of what Sophie is telling him, just perplexed as to why she has dared to speak when virtually nobody else has. And for the contemporary German cinema goer, Sophie is the present generation asking their grandparents why they never spoke out.That her and her friends' defiance was almost unique, and that it was carried out by such young and idealistic people, hoping to spread a student rebellion throught the university campuses of Germany, simply emphasises the bravery and pathetic tragedy of Sophie. There was to be no wide-scale student revolt. In fact most Germans at the time who heard about her actions regarded her as a traitor.The film really excells towards the end however, with the public trial of Sophie and her brother.

She and her comrades (one was her brother) printed out multiple copies of six leaflets that they distributed over the University Campus. They were caught by the cowardly, sniveling janitor who turned them in to the Gestapo. Their purchases of paper, ink and stamps were traced, and a horrendous interview ensues during which Sophie stands her ground clearly, articulately and with courage.After pretty much a kangaroo court trial, for her trouble Sophie is executed, and many of her other comrades were killed as well. I had always thought she had been hung or shot, as many were during that time. I had no idea she had been beheaded, that the guillotine was still in use! The more I learn, the less I know, and the more audacious the atrocities become. She was 18 years old, beheaded for having the arrogance to publish her thoughts.Today, we have the Internet - but our governments hate the power that gives us.

The story of ""The White Rose"" and particularly of Sophie Magdalena Scholl, her brother Hans Scholl, and their friend Christoph Probst can now be told.  It has been the subject of a couple of projects in Germany.  This movie has won several awards and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film for 2006.  It is a terrific film.  Yes, it is in German, and yes, there are subtitles, but so what.  After a couple of minutes you don't even realize you are reading them.I don't want to take anything away from the experience you will have watching this intense and very meaningful film.  But the setup is that five friends had become more than disillusioned with Hitler, the Nazis, and the war in general.  They lived in Munich, right in the mouth of the beast, and yet had the guts to form a secret group they called ""The White Rose"".  It published leaflets and wrote graffiti on walls around town.They push their luck and Hans and Sophie (brother and sister) get caught.

This movie is not fiction, most of it is from eyewitness or documentary sources.  It is about doing the right thing, even when looking evil and death in the face.  It is about familial love.  And it is about fearless, active faith.As young Munich University students, Sophie and her older brother Hans led the White Rose resistance movement, leaving graffiti on walls, and more importantly, printing anti-Nazi leaflets, the sixth of which was dropped over Munich by the Allies only months after the Scholls' executions in 1943.  The plot is known from the outset:  the Scholls get busted distributing leaflets, they are convicted, then they're executed (by guillotine--no blood shown).The first part of the film seems not much more than reporting, but then, 2/3 of the way into it, the movie grabs you and doesn't let you go.  First, there's Sophie's flint-like display of the paradoxical grace of strength in weakness (Sophie, a Protestant, is shown relying upon God in prayer). Second, there's the profound familial love relationships, all the more palpable because brother Hans and sister Sophie are not allowed to vocalize, so through expressive eyes that won't turn away they speak their love to each other.  The parental bond's not left out either, and their parents are shown breaking in on the trial yelling as they are pushed out:  ""I'm Robert Scholl, father of two of the defendants...There is a higher justice!""  And third, there's the grip of the White Rose message.  It is very significant that the White Rose leaflets reported Nazi atrocities based on eyewitness accounts of people returning from the Eastern Front, proving that the general German public cannot claim to have never heard of what was going on.  The dialogue between Sophie and her interrogator delves into issues such as who has a right to life, racial hatred, freedom of speech, the existence of God, conscience vs obedience to law, and more.Most Holocaust movies focus on the unwilling victims and the Nazis, but this movie's a bit different in that it's about people who willingly chose to assume risking death, though they could have avoided it.  Sophie had several opportunities to betray her conscience and spare her life, but declined ""because it's wrong.""

Sophie Scholl and the White Rose show that not all Germans at the time of World II were either evil or cowardly at all.Sophie Scholl was a great heroine of the twentieth century, all but underrated by historians and writers alike outside of Germany, who was with her brother Hans Scholl and Christoph Probst were key figures in The White Rose a non-violent, intellectual resistance group in Nazi Germany, consisting of students from the University of Munich and their philosophy professor. The group became known for an anonymous leaflet and graffiti campaign, lasting from June 1942 until February 1943, that called for active opposition to tyrant Adolf Hitler's regime.Sophie (played by the very attractive Julia Jentsch) and her brother Hans Scholl (Fabian Hinrichs) and Christoph (Florian Stetter) are caught distributing leaflets denouncing Hitler and the monstrous Nazi tyranny ,and immediately arrested in late 1942, when the tide has just turned against the hitherto victorious Nazi juggernaut spreading mass death and terror across Europe  . Much of the movie focuses on Sophie,s interrogation by slimy Gestapo officer Robert Mohr (Gerald Alexander Held) , her conversations with her cellmate Else Gebel (a Communist activist) and of course the most dramatic trial by the absolutely demonic Nazi judge and gauleiter Roland Freisr (brilliantly captured in his infamy and fury by Andr&eacute; Hennicke) It has been verified that Hennicke's portrayal was quite accurate and Freiser is real life was as brutal and hysterical as he is portrayed if not worse.When Sophie and her brother and Christoph Probst are sentenced to die, Sophie tells her persecutors : 'Your terror will soon be over!' and Hans proclaims to them prophetically 'You may hang us today, but you'll be hanged tomorrow'. after having told them earlier that 'Tomorrow, you will be sitting in our places.'Deeply moving scenes that will bring all but the hardest hearts to tears in the final hours before Sophie and her brother and friends are executed.Sophie is visited by her parents and her father Robert Scholl affirms that Sophie has done the right thing and they are proud of her while her mother exhorts her to cling to her faith.Her final words before she is led to her death at the guiltiness is 'The sun is still shining!'

Julia Jentsch does a fantastic acting job; there were only a couple of moments where I thought she was OK. The actor playing Roland Freisler also does a fantastic job. He accurately portrays the Freisler we are familiar with in the videos of the sham trial of the 20 July assasination plotters. The trial footage promised on the product details is of this trial and not the White Rose trial in Munich. I don't believe any footage exists.The rest of the cast does a strong job.

1010351,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000H5V8H2,Grady Harp,"[72, 77]","SOPHIE SCHOOL - THE FINAL DAYS is one of those films made more powerful by the understated production values.  The script, yes, the story itself, is so powerful that it doesn't need big battle scenes or full-fledged staged crowd scenes to make it work: the dialogue among the actors speaks volumes.Written by Fred Breinersdorfer based on documents from life and directed with enormous sensitivity by Marc Rothemund the film takes place in the last days of the lives of members of the anti-Nazi resistance movement The White Rose in 1943.  Sophie Scholl (Julia Jentsch), her brother Hans (Fabian Hinrichs) and their friend Christoph (Florian Stetter) are organizers for creating leaflets warning the populace of Germany of the ills ahead should Hitler and his Hessians remain in power.  They are caught, imprisoned and interrogated.  Sophie's interrogator Robert Mohr (Gerald Alexander Held), though strong, does seem to understand Sophie's explanations for her denial  of participation in the spreading of leaflets, but Sophie has the courage to speak out against the current government.  Hans is likewise interrogated and when he confesses to the leaflet incident he is implicating both Sophie and Christoph and the three are brought before a vicious tribunal.  Christoph pleads for his life and Sophie and Hans request that his life as a father be spared but the charges are made of iron and the three are convicted and immediately executed.The fact that the story is true makes it all the more moving.  Observing the inordinate amount of courage in standing firm for beliefs - especially in Sophie's case - is humbling for the viewer. How many of us, under similar circumstances would have that degree of conviction of ideals and bravery?The acting by everyone involved is first rate, with Julia Jentsch and Gerald Alexander Held being especially fine.  The pacing, scoring, lighting and direction of this film are keyed to the atmosphere of the times in 1943 Germany, creating a sense of claustrophobia in the visual and the emotional aspects of the film.  It is a brilliant work and deserves a very wide audience.  In German with English subtitles.

Hopefully the movie version, ""Sophie Scholl: The Last Days,"" will make more people aware of this fascinating and courageous individual.Sophie Scholl, along with her brother Hans, founded the White Rose Society, which was anti-war and anti-Nazi, and operated at the University of Munich from 1942-1943. ""Sophie Scholl: The Final Days"" is about, as the title implies, the Scholls' last days alive. It opens with a midnight meeting of the White Rose as they discuss distributing anti-war literature on campus. Some among them say that it's too risky to distribute pamphlets so openly on campus, since it's been infiltrated. They decide the distribute the ""6th leaflet"" on campus while classes are in session so that they're not noticed. In so doing, they hope to start an anti-war rebellion. Unfortuantely, Hans and Sophie Scholl are caught. Sophie tries to deny the charges at first, and concocts false stories. Eventually, she's faced with a handwritten version of the pamphlet, in her brother's handwriting, and a written confession of her brother, so she knows that the game is up. Eventually, we see Hans and Sophie, along with their associate Christoph Probst, charged with treason and tried in the ""People's Court"" by the infamous show-trial judge Roland Freisler. They are found guilty and sentenced to be guillotined the same day.It is said that courage is speaking the truth when it's inconvenient, and that's certainly the case with Sophie Scholl. Even though she was successful in distributing the pamphlets, it failed to ignite the uprising that she hoped for. Germany only saw her and the other White Rose members as heroes after the war. Sophie's conviction as she faces her interrogators should be an inspiration to everyone, and the themes of conscience and freedom vs. order and nation are timeless.

But I was always aware that this was a movie, and all these battles were scripted. Judging by the few seconds of actual trial footage shown in the extras, things were a little harsher for Sophie and her co-defendants in real life. The Nazis were brutal, powerful, and ruthless. They knew how to crush opponents. And these small opponents were readily and quickly crushed. Like many thousands of unknown fighters, Sophie and her brother died in a cause that was eventually successful, though the coda showing their pamphlet being dropped over Germany felt a little contrived.I had the feeling that his movie was made to glorify Sophie because she was female. Her brother was apparently more involved than she, yet her struggle is the center of the film. But in the rather tedious interview with her sister, we learn that Sophie knew how to do her hair in the most flattering manner, and was stylish.The bizarrely empty sets were rather weird as well. These people seemed to inhabit a generally empty city, with just a few cars or passers by. The university was vacant, as were the halls of justice. The film trial was small affair; the one put on by the Nazis had a much larger, and one suspects, more enthusiastic audience. Downfall, a recent German film about the last days of Hitler, shows us that even when clearly losing his grip on reality, a significant portion of the high command trusted and believed in their leader. This whole film felt too small, too slight, too straightforward.",3,I was not convinced,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,1771,"['not', 'terrible', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'music', 'film', 'ultimately', 'left', 'curiously', 'uninvolved', 'Yes', 'saw', 'gently-hinted', 'interplay', 'Sophie', 'interrogator', 'who', 'liked', 'admired', 'young', 'leader', 'Yes', 'saw', 'intelligence', 'subtlety', 'answers', 'was', 'always', 'aware', 'was', 'movie', 'battles', 'were', 'scripted', 'Judging', 'few', 'seconds', 'actual', 'trial', 'footage', 'shown', 'extras', 'things', 'were', 'little', 'harsher', 'Sophie', 'co-defendants', 'real', 'life', 'Nazis', 'were', 'brutal', 'powerful', 'ruthless', 'knew', 'how', 'crush', 'opponents', 'small', 'opponents', 'were', 'readily', 'quickly', 'crushed', 'many', 'thousands', 'unknown', 'fighters', 'Sophie', 'brother', 'died', 'cause', 'was', 'eventually', 'successful', 'coda', 'showing', 'pamphlet', 'being', 'dropped', 'Germany', 'felt', 'little', 'contrived.I', 'had', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'glorify', 'Sophie', 'was', 'female', 'brother', 'was', 'apparently', 'more', 'involved', 'yet', 'struggle', 'center', 'film', 'rather', 'tedious', 'interview', 'sister', 'learn', 'Sophie', 'knew', 'how', 'do', 'hair', 'most', 'flattering', 'manner', 'was', 'stylish.The', 'bizarrely', 'empty', 'sets', 'were', 'rather', 'weird', 'well', 'people', 'seemed', 'inhabit', 'generally', 'empty', 'city', 'just', 'few', 'cars', 'passers', 'university', 'was', 'vacant', 'were', 'halls', 'justice', 'film', 'trial', 'was', 'small', 'affair', 'one', 'put', 'Nazis', 'had', 'much', 'larger', 'one', 'suspects', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'audience', 'Downfall', 'recent', 'German', 'film', 'last', 'days', 'Hitler', 'even', 'when', 'clearly', 'losing', 'grip', 'reality', 'significant', 'portion', 'high', 'command', 'trusted', 'believed', 'leader', 'whole', 'film', 'felt', 'too', 'small', 'too', 'slight', 'too', 'straightforward']",N/A
1010359,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000H5V8H2,Jean E. Pouliot,"[6, 12]","""Sophie Scholl"" focuses on the short life of the real-life woman of the title, who with her brother Hans and a number of other compatriots from the University of Munich, made up the White Rose, which opposed the Nazis during the Second World War. The film focuses mostly on Sophie's last mission to leaflet the university, her arrest, imprisonment and show trial. Viewers might disagree about whether Sophie's story is emblematic of the White Rose in general. Though brave, she was hardly the group's leader or muse. But given the almost complete lack of knowledge about German citizens who resisted Hitler, it's a valuable story to hear.The movie falls short in its portrayal of the context of fear that imprisoned some Germans and emboldened others. According to the movie, Sophie and her friends did not seem to have been subject to physical abuse during their imprisonment and their families did not suffer as a result of their involvement in the White Rose. While risking execution is not an experience to be taken lightly, there was little indication of the angst and sense of betrayal that Sophie and her friends may have felt when they went against the culture that nurtured them. The trial scene is surprisingly subdued. While the Nazi-connected prosecutor spends much time berating the defendants, Sophie and her brother Hans -- while bravely standing up for their beliefs -- do not take much opportunity to debate their accusers.These shortcomings notwithstanding, Sophie Scholl was worthwhile (if not compelling), if only to bring to light the story of a group that did what it could to oppose Hitler's murderous regime. The DVD includes interviews with acquaintances of the film's real-life characters, including the son of the woman who shared a cell with Sophie. These interviews are not terribly revealing, being held with people who did not really know Sophie that well. The archival trial footage of the trial does not include the Sophie/Hans trial as implied, but does prove that the film's depiction of the prosecutor was hardly exaggerated. All in all, a well-written and well-acted piece of film that curiously lacked an emotional context or a sense of whether the White Rose was effective.",3,Curiously low-key,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,2212,"['Sophie', 'Scholl', 'short', 'life', 'real-life', 'woman', 'title', 'who', 'brother', 'Hans', 'number', 'other', 'compatriots', 'University', 'Munich', 'made', 'up', 'White', 'Rose', 'opposed', 'Nazis', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'film', 'mostly', 'Sophie', 'last', 'mission', 'leaflet', 'university', 'arrest', 'imprisonment', 'show', 'trial', 'Viewers', 'might', 'disagree', 'Sophie', 'story', 'emblematic', 'White', 'Rose', 'general', 'brave', 'was', 'hardly', 'group', 'leader', 'muse', 'given', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'German', 'citizens', 'who', 'resisted', 'Hitler', 'valuable', 'story', 'hear.The', 'movie', 'short', 'portrayal', 'context', 'fear', 'imprisoned', 'Germans', 'emboldened', 'others', 'According', 'movie', 'Sophie', 'friends', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'physical', 'abuse', 'imprisonment', 'families', 'did', 'not', 'suffer', 'result', 'involvement', 'White', 'Rose', 'risking', 'execution', 'not', 'experience', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'was', 'little', 'indication', 'angst', 'sense', 'betrayal', 'Sophie', 'friends', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'when', 'went', 'culture', 'nurtured', 'trial', 'scene', 'surprisingly', 'subdued', 'Nazi-connected', 'prosecutor', 'much', 'time', 'berating', 'defendants', 'Sophie', 'brother', 'Hans', 'bravely', 'standing', 'up', 'beliefs', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'opportunity', 'debate', 'accusers.These', 'shortcomings', 'notwithstanding', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'compelling', 'only', 'bring', 'light', 'story', 'group', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'oppose', 'Hitler', 'murderous', 'regime', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'acquaintances', 'film', 'real-life', 'characters', 'including', 'son', 'woman', 'who', 'shared', 'cell', 'Sophie', 'interviews', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'revealing', 'being', 'held', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'Sophie', 'well', 'archival', 'trial', 'footage', 'trial', 'not', 'include', 'Sophie/Hans', 'trial', 'implied', 'prove', 'film', 'depiction', 'prosecutor', 'was', 'hardly', 'exaggerated', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'piece', 'film', 'curiously', 'lacked', 'emotional', 'context', 'sense', 'White', 'Rose', 'was', 'effective']",N/A

1010361,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B000H5V8H2,J from NY,"[3, 3]","""Sophie Scholl: The Final Days"" is far superior to the simplistic ""White Rose"", made in the mid-80's.  Marc Rothemund handles the delicate, tragic, and inspiring tale of these ill-fated German college students who, at the risk of their lives, dared to speak out against theThird Reich and the horror they were wreaking upon the world.Though the film shows the events which led up the group's trial and execution at the hands of the SS, with Julia Jentsch as Sophie Scholl and Gerald Held as the monstrously depraved--but somehow, in some small fraction of a way, still human--Gestapo officer Robert Mohr.  Though Scholl's brother and a few other members of the Resistance group appear, these two are the real stars.Having read extensively about the White Rose before this, I can't help but think that they were aware capture and execution were inevitable at some point.  Passing anti-Nazi leaflets around in Nazi Germany or even possessing them meant certain death unless you were related to a powerful person in the Nazi Party or had aristocracy in your background, and even then you'd probably die.  They were not naive young people.  A kind of heroic fatalism pervades the entire movie.In a legendary conversation between Mohr and Scholl during her initial interrogation, she finally stops lying when she realizes others will be implicated and die if she continues to protect herself and says very sharply: ""Yes, I passed out the pamphlets, and I'm proud of it.""  Mohrdid not know how to handle or understand Sophie Scholl and had no desire to see the young girl die: he was so brainwashed and loyal to Hitler that a person actively objecting to his rule and the evil done in his name is at first beyond his comprehension.  Held does an excellent job portraying this ruthless specimen of a man: when Scholl brought up the execution of mentally ill children, which she had witnessed personally, he seems to halt for a moment, beady eyed and trying hard to stay in denial.  She talks of common decency, mercy, God, and he contemplates these things for a few moments but, true to form, tells Scholl she is a young girl has been corrupted and who should never have gotten involved in anything so perilous.  He even offers her ways out, which she refuses.The incredible thing about the movie is that you actually feel as though you're in Nazi Germany.  The scenes in which the three are placed in front of ""Raving"" Roland Freisler, the red robed maniac who makes one wonder if the Devil himself hadn't watched too much Court TV and decided to give it a try, are very powerful.  That these young men and women could maintain their composure in the face of a country turned evil, certain death, and a sadist like Freisler is still hard to comprehend.The one thing ""The People's Court"" as it was called never wanted anyone to mention while Freisler was busy abusing them, namely the holocaust, was given PR many times by the White Rose in public.The ending is difficult to watch but realistically filmed.  The constant call of ""traitor!"" will be a sad reminder to any conscientious American who is active politically and opposes the present Administration--and I wouldn't be surprised if Rothemund himself knew this.

1010366,A34792YZU3EH56,B000H5V8H2,J. Swagman,"[5, 5]","The last class I ever took at college was a class on teaching history. We had to read a book called ""Lies my History Teacher told me"" by James Loewen (which, by the way, is one of those books I can't recommend enough, if you ever get a chance to read it).One week, we were assigned a chapter on the absence of John Brown, and the disappearance of anti-racism in American school history textbooks. Our professor started the class discussion with a discouraging story from his own teaching experience. He recalled how one of his students had once written in an essay on slavery, ""It's all pretty terrible, but I suppose if I had been alive back then I would have just done the same thing.""""Now,"" the professor said, ""As a teacher, how am I supposed to react to that?""I remember being surprised that he was upset by this, because I had always figured the awareness that we are not above the forces of history is an enlightened and progressive view. It is easy to get on our high horse and talk about how foolish and evil our ancestors were, but would we have been any different if we lived back then? And once we recognize this, wouldn't that cause us to look more critically at our own society and culture, and try and see it through the eyes of future historians?I raised my hand and said something to this equivalent in class. The professor countered that it is important to also emphasize that throughout every age, there have been people who have stood up against evil and injustice, and if they are omitted from the history books, then it sends the message that we are powerless to fight against injustice in our own age.Also, if we remember those who resisted injustice, it is all the more damning for those who simply went along with it, as it takes away any excuses someone might be tempted to make for the majority. They were not simply pawns of history or products of their time. They could have joined those who were fighting for justice.If there is truth in this, and I think there is, then ""Sophie Scholl: The Last Days"" is the kind of movie that the film industry needs to make a lot more of. This is the true story of a 21-year-old university student in Nazi Germany who had the courage to stand up and say that what was happening was wrong. She and her brother were caught distributing anti-Nazi pamphlets, interrogated by the Gestapo, convicted in a Nazi court, and immediately guillotined. The amount of courage she shows is absolutely amazing and inspiring.I'm always criticizing movies for being too melodramatic or sappy, but this film manages to be extremely powerful without being overly emotional. Easily one of the best films I've ever seen.A good film to compare this to is ""Judgement at Nuremburg"". In ""Judgement at Nuremburg"", the big Nazi war criminals have already been tried and condemned, and the court has moved on to judges and college professors who collaborated with the Nazi regime, even though they should have known better. The film asks the question why these good people allowed themselves to be corrupted.Put in that context, ""Sophie Scholl"" is all the more powerful, because of all the judges, professors, civic and religious leaders who went along with Nazi Germany when they should have known better, contrasted with a 21 year old university student.The movie makes a big point of Sophie Scholl's Christian faith, and indeed her story plays like something out of the Old Testament, when all the people who are supposed to be moral leaders of Israel are silent about the injustice, so God raises up a Shepard boy or an unknown prophet.If you ever run across this movie, I can't recommend it enough.",5,One of the Best Films ever,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,3640,"['last', 'class', 'ever', 'took', 'college', 'was', 'class', 'teaching', 'history', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'called', 'Lies', 'History', 'Teacher', 'told', 'James', 'Loewen', 'way', 'one', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough', 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'read', 'week', 'were', 'assigned', 'chapter', 'absence', 'John', 'Brown', 'disappearance', 'anti-racism', 'American', 'school', 'history', 'textbooks', 'professor', 'started', 'class', 'discussion', 'discouraging', 'story', 'own', 'teaching', 'experience', 'recalled', 'how', 'one', 'students', 'had', 'once', 'written', 'essay', 'slavery', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'suppose', 'had', 'been', 'alive', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'same', 'thing', 'Now', 'professor', 'said', 'teacher', 'how', 'am', 'supposed', 'react', 'remember', 'being', 'surprised', 'was', 'upset', 'had', 'always', 'figured', 'awareness', 'are', 'not', 'forces', 'history', 'enlightened', 'progressive', 'view', 'easy', 'get', 'high', 'horse', 'talk', 'how', 'foolish', 'evil', 'ancestors', 'were', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'lived', 'back', 'then', 'once', 'recognize', 'would', ""n't"", 'that', 'cause', 'look', 'more', 'critically', 'own', 'society', 'culture', 'try', 'see', 'eyes', 'future', 'historians', 'raised', 'hand', 'said', 'something', 'equivalent', 'class', 'professor', 'countered', 'important', 'also', 'emphasize', 'age', 'have', 'been', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'stood', 'up', 'evil', 'injustice', 'are', 'omitted', 'history', 'books', 'then', 'message', 'are', 'powerless', 'fight', 'injustice', 'own', 'age.Also', 'remember', 'who', 'resisted', 'injustice', 'more', 'damning', 'who', 'simply', 'went', 'away', 'excuses', 'someone', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'make', 'majority', 'were', 'not', 'simply', 'pawns', 'history', 'products', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'joined', 'who', 'were', 'fighting', 'justice.If', 'truth', 'think', 'then', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'Last', 'Days', 'kind', 'movie', 'film', 'industry', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'true', 'story', '21-year-old', 'university', 'student', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'who', 'had', 'courage', 'stand', 'up', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'was', 'wrong', 'brother', 'were', 'caught', 'distributing', 'anti-Nazi', 'pamphlets', 'interrogated', 'Gestapo', 'convicted', 'Nazi', 'court', 'immediately', 'guillotined', 'amount', 'courage', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'inspiring.I', ""'m"", 'always', 'criticizing', 'movies', 'being', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'sappy', 'film', 'be', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'being', 'overly', 'emotional', 'Easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.A', 'good', 'film', 'compare', 'Judgement', 'Nuremburg', 'Judgement', 'Nuremburg', 'big', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminals', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'tried', 'condemned', 'court', 'moved', 'judges', 'college', 'professors', 'who', 'collaborated', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'even', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'film', 'question', 'why', 'good', 'people', 'allowed', 'be', 'corrupted.Put', 'context', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'more', 'powerful', 'judges', 'professors', 'civic', 'religious', 'leaders', 'who', 'went', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'contrasted', '21', 'year', 'old', 'university', 'student.The', 'movie', 'big', 'point', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'Christian', 'faith', 'indeed', 'story', 'plays', 'something', 'Old', 'Testament', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'moral', 'leaders', 'Israel', 'are', 'silent', 'injustice', 'God', 'up', 'Shepard', 'boy', 'unknown', 'prophet.If', 'ever', 'run', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough']",N/A

Ramos,"[22, 22]","The White Rose was a World War II non-violent resistance group in Germany famous for a leaflet campaign in which they called for active opposition to the Nazi regime. The group initially consisted of five students, all in their early twenties at Munich University. Between June 1942 and February 1943, they prepared and distributed six different leaflets, in which they called for an end to Nazi oppression and tyranny through active opposition of the German people. Hans Scholl, played by Fabian Hinrichs, and his sister Sophie led the rest of the group, including Christoph Probst, Alexander Schmorell and Willi Graf. A professor, Kurt Huber, who drafted the final two leaflets, joined them. All six members of this group were arrested, tried, convicted and executed by beheading. The Gestapo found a seventh leaflet in possession of the students at the time of their arrest. All three were noted for the courage with which they faced their deaths, particularly Sophie, who remained firm despite intense interrogation, and said to head judge of the court Freisler during the trial, ""You know as well as we do that the war is lost. Why are you so cowardly that you won't admit it?""This movie as mentioned has paid scrupulous attention to historical detail and focused on the end days. The only liberty taken was the compression of the interrogation and trial to three days and of course a couple of undocumented conversation, like when Sophie speaks prays with a priest before here death. Starting with the evening before they distributed the leaflet that would cause their arrest. Sophie Scholl: The Final Days proves to be both thrillingly suspenseful and emotionally devastating without having to go far behind the recorded historical factsWhat I find interesting is that all the men of the white Rose were war veterans who had fought in France and the Eastern fronts. So they saw what was transpiring first hand. Sophie played by Julia Jentsch,  had completed her Labor force duties, had joined here brother at university and is the heroine of this story. She tried to take sole responsibility once the Gestapo and proved she was responsible in an effort to protect others. They were trying to urge the reader of the leaflet to ""Support the resistance movement!"" in the struggle for ""Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and protection of the individual citizen from the arbitrary action of criminal dictator-states"". Principles that are the foundations of Europe today.One final note, I have seen the clips of the actually trial that Gobels filmed and Freisler was played brilliantly by Andre Hennicke, Julia Jentsch is great as Sophie as is Gerald Alexander Held as Investigator Mohr. This is a must see film. Not only for its historical significance but also for the example of an example of a Christian with a moral vision and strength in dire circumstance.

1010377,AKEJE0HB5BST0,B000H5V8H2,Mark Lee,"[1, 1]","The title is unimaginative.  ""Sophie Scholl - The Final Days""  And that's what this movie is about.  Ms. Scholl (played remarkably by Julia Jentsch) was a member of the non-violent anti-Nazi group ""White Rose"" who was arrested in 1943 along with her brother Hans (Fabian Hinrichs) and others subsequent to an anti-Nazi flier placement at a university in Munich.  This film claims to rely on traditional accounts as well as new material collected since the renunification of Germany a decade and a half ago.  Much of this movie involves the reasonably thorough investigation and non-violent interrogation of Sophie by federal investigator Robert Mohr (Gerald Alexander Held).  The subsequent, repellent spectacle of a ""trial"" was a mere formality on the fast-track road to an end determined at the conclusion of the investigation.  Hans' speech was marvelous.This is a powerful movie, not because of any tricky cinematography or stirring soundtrack or any of the tools one usually sees employed to stir feelings and arouse passions.  Oh, there are beautifully framed shots and the occasional use of music for effect, but this movie is largely based on dialogue and is a great contest of wills and ideas.  Mohr is a diligent Nazi functionary.  Held's performance is perfectly balanced against Jentsch's Scholl.  And I believe he comes to respect and possibly even love sophie with the affection of a father for an intelligent, stubbornly willful child.  He simply doesn't understand how someone as ""gifted"" and intelligent as Sophie can fail to see the world the way he does.  He gives her every opportunity to mitigate her involvement, indeed even tries to talk her into framing her confession in language most likely to allow her to live.  And so this is also a story about fidelity to the purity of ideas and convictions.  And a lesson how even in the shadow of death one can see the sunshine of a beautiful day.",5,Fidelity to an Idea.

Julia Jentsch is extremely effective in portraying Scholl's idealism and burning intelligence. Her Sophie is a leader, a firebrand: someone who accepts the consequences of her actions without remorse and without pointing fingers towards anyone but herself.Too much of what Mohr spouts is pedantic, Nazi drivel whereas Sophie's responses are likewise pedantic, pie-in-the-sky and emotional. What makes their exchanges interesting is that they are based on official Gestapo records available only since German reunification. Despite all of this or maybe because of it, these interrogation scenes crackle with fire and truth: both Sophie and Mohr fully committed to their cause.""Sophie Scholl: Die letzten Tage"" along with the recent ""Downfall"" are more important as social statements rather than artistic ones.

1010388,A2FUOXFJ74B32M,B000H5V8H2,"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[12, 13]","This film was rather simple with a sort of ""low-budget"" feel to it. That being said, it was excellently acted and directed and while a bit slow at times, I found it to be a very moving film.The story is centered on Sophie Scholl, the young German student who is arrested in 1943 along with her brother for distributing anti-Nazi leaflets at school. She was part of a passive resistance movement called the White Rose. The beginning of the film shows her and her friends preparing for, and then committing their ""crime"" while the bulk of the film focuses on her interrogation and subsequent punishment. Ms. Scholl was clearly a brave young girl and she deserves to be remembered as such. That being said, I have to agree with a previous reviewer who questioned why they focused on her when it seems that her brother was actually more involved than she was? Is it because she was a female? Perhaps, but I suppose this is a trivial point. I certainly don't mean to take anything away from her or the film.One of the best scenes in the film is the exchange between Sophie and her interrogator, Detective Mohl where they go back and forth about the ideals of National Socialism and Sophie's democratic ideals. The detective, a stubborn Nazi ideologue initially treats her with contempt while spouting harsh National Socialist platitudes, but as the interrogations go on, he develops a soft spot for her and perhaps even a little admiration for her steadfast convictions. The judge however, has no such sympathy.Since I can't leave well enough alone though, I just have to criticize one thing, Sophie's cellmate, the friendly, righteous communist. Why is it that in so many of these types of films the communists are always portrayed as some sort of freedom fighters while the evil fascists are almost always monsters? Everybody knows that the communists were just as brutal (if not more) and killed even more people than the Nazis. And while I can understand Sophie and her cellmate's desire to be ""liberated"" the fact is, the post-war occupation (at least in the east) was arguably much worse than Nazi rule. Sure they were liberated, if by liberated you mean raped and tortured by the glorious Red Army.

There is a parallel in this country today if people would awaken to it. The nation has elected a man that they think represents them and they have no idea the road to perdition that he and his administration are taking. When you compare the history of Germany it is apparent that they people of that nation wanted a messiah to bring them out of their self inflicted woes. The same thing is happening in the US today and there are very few who recognize it. The people have elected for themselves a man who is a reflection of themselves in the bathroom mirror but they are unable to see it.While the NAZI's attempted to exterminate their opponents and that has not been the case in 2013 America, stilling the voices of opposition are certainly alive and well.The entrenched political class in both of the major parties cannot be made to see that they are on the same road that the political and ruling class were on in 1930-45 Germany.As for the film it is excellent. It is well acted. It does follow the history of the White Rose organization to a degree, there were more than the few depicted in this film, but as any film the director has to be careful to not weave too great a tapestry of intervening lives because of time.There is a monument behind the house in Munich. There are very few of these monuments anywhere in Germany, and there are not many who know about it. The White Rose did indeed struggle against the tyranny of the ruling class in their generation, and if the students of this nation's schools of higher learning ever wake up there is a possibility that the 1960's revolution would look more like an afternoon stroll in the park.This is a must see by anyone who is concerned about the way those in power today continue to consolidate power and make for themselves a way to keep the masses from ever learning just how much they have stolen. Just how much they have put the next generations into slavery, much more than what was experienced when men owned men physically, this slavery of economics is far more devastating.This film may be considered prophetic in that it very clearly foretells what will become of a nation that has forsaken God to seek their own salvation in accordance with their thought.

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[1, 1]","The magnificnt achievement of director Marc Rothemund and writer Fred Breinersdorfer regarding a ""modern day"" martyr is nothing short of riveting. No explosions, big sets, etc., but a simple display of a period in history that can only cause disbelief.  Based on actual transcripts and interviews, Sophie's story is told in a concise fashion. Though not fast moving, it's ability to provoke thoughts is to be commended. I can only add to previous reviewers' comments that the acting is, without exception, perfect. Julia Jentsch IS Sophie, an innate integrity that shows often without saying a word. Her ""banter"" with Gerald Alexander Held, is compelling. Her cellmate, Johanna Gasdorf, is wonderful and supportive, and the performance of the handsome Fabian Hinrichs (as her brother) is also perfect. There isn't a weak link. A surprise nominee as Best Foreign Language Film brought this film to my attention, and I'm glad I was acquainted with the wonderul Ms. Scholl.

A whole-hearted recommendation from me to anyone who appreciates a true story of courage and devotion.I was instantly struck by the similarities in mood, construction, and symbolism to such French classics as Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc""  and Sandrine Bonnaire's turn as Joan in ""Jeanne la Pucelle: Les Prisons.""  But this movie strikes a much more defiant tone. Julia Jentsch gives a bravura evocation  of the remarkable Sophie Scholl.  Her character is forthright, steadfast, and hopeful in the face of the Gestapo and the Nazi kangaroo court to which she is condemned. Director Rothemund wisely respects his material enough to allow it to stand on its own merits, without grandstanding or exaggeration.  Much of the film takes place in the form of dialogue between  Sophie and the other imprisoned resistance leaders and their accusers.  It's a spare but effective presentation, given depth by the nuanced and faithful performances of the cast and the striking photography. There's a stately Greek drama quality to it; Sophocles could have written something very similar.A lesson for our own times from the darkest days of WWII, when an undaunted band of German students -- the White Rose movement -- risked all for freedom. There is much more background information, trailers, etc.  available at the movie's website.Nominated for an Oscar as Best Foreign-language Film, 2005.

1010392,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000H5V8H2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[23, 25]","Sophie Scholl: The Final Days (Marc Rothemund, 2005)Sophie Scholl: The Final Days reminds me a good deal of Der Untergang in that both of them take an almost documentary-like approach to a span of a few days in the life of one person during World War II. That, however, is where the similarity ends (and Sophie Scholl starts looking more like Hirchbiegel's previous film, Das Experiment); this is a much more intimate film, and all the more disturbing for it.Sophie Scholl, played here by Der Untergang's Julia Jentsch, was a member of the resistance movement known as the White Rose. On February 18, 1943, Scholl and her brother Hans were arrested at the University of Munich and charged with distributing anti-Nazi propaganda. The movie starts with Sophie, Hans (Gun-shy's Fabian Hinrichs), and Christoph Probst (Ash Wednesday's Florian Stetter) getting the White Rose's sixth leaflet ready for distribution, taking it to the University of Munich, distributing it, and getting arrested thanks to Sophie's impulsive act of knocking one stack of leaflets off a railing so they rained down on people in the entrance hall. From there, we are taken through her interrogations at the hands of Robert Mohr (Anatomy's Gerald Alexander Held) and glimpses of her life in prison, through the trial and the execution. (Not a spoiler, given the movie's title and because, well, it's history.)Jentsch, of course, is the big news here, and the film lives or dies by her performance; even Held, since he only exists for the latter half of the film, takes a back seat to Jentsch. Her performance is strong enough to push the film along most of the time (the opening ten minutes or so are a little slower than effective to build the suspense Rothemund seems to be going for); Rothemund does the rest with some inspired direction reminiscent of David Fincher's use of chiaroscuro back before Fincher started phoning it in.Quite good, this.

1010393,A387BD735MI50R,B000H5V8H2,R. Schultz,"[6, 6]","This film looks at a facet of Hitler's regime that we don't often see dramatized. There are no concentration camps here, no emaciated bodies. The oppression that this real-life heroine suffers might seem almost ""civilized"" in comparison - except for its tragic conclusions.This movie shows how freedom of speech bans were enforced in the Third Reich. The ""White Rose,"" a resistance group made up of German students and others, was a particular target of the Reich authorities charged with squelching and eradicating all criticisms of Hitler. Sophie Scholl was one student who defied the new laws by helping to publish and distribute leaflets that told the truth about how Germany was losing the War. Making even the slightest ""defeatist"" remark was categorized as treason then, and as such, was a capital offense.This film shows how Sophie Scholl was arrested and interrogated. Julia Jentsch is letter-perfect in the role of Sophie Scholl. A thin young college student, she stands up to the world of prosecutors surrounding her with dignity and courage. She faces their rigid enforcements with humanity, their rote with reason.Again, it isn't the raw brutalities of the concentration camps that she confronts. One of her interrogators almost seems capable of sympathizing with her on some level. And she is provided with fairly decent food in her cell. But in some ways, all this relative decency only underscores the utter derangement of the culture of the time. People who were not brutal hooligans or mad dogs, people who still seemed capable of commonsense, nonetheless chose to become cogs in the grinding machine of the Reich.This movie made me think of the contrast that some poet once suggested - ""We could have sat under dappling leaves, sipped our tea, and felt our way towards friendship."" Instead, a great many people allowed themselves to become instruments of a perverted justice. They allowed all the bright possibilities to end in bleak, utter waste.The bonus materials on this DVD don't add much to the movie dramatization of Sophie Scholl's fate. There are some current interviews with surviving members of the White Rose, but their comments are vague, almost suggesting that these individuals might not really have played as large a part in the Resistance as they like to remember. There is also a current interview with Sophie Scholl's sister. But here again, the sister's recollections are a little abstract, making it almost seem as if the two might have been like ships that passed in the night, without any vital connection between them.So perhaps better to simply let the movie stand on its own, just as Sophie Scholl stood essentially alone before The System.",4,Poignant Portrayal of a Real Braveheart,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2685,"['film', 'facet', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'dramatized', 'are', 'concentration', 'camps', 'here', 'emaciated', 'bodies', 'oppression', 'real-life', 'heroine', 'suffers', 'might', 'seem', 'almost', 'civilized', 'comparison', 'tragic', 'conclusions.This', 'movie', 'how', 'freedom', 'speech', 'bans', 'were', 'enforced', 'Third', 'Reich', 'White', 'Rose', 'resistance', 'group', 'made', 'German', 'students', 'others', 'was', 'particular', 'target', 'Reich', 'authorities', 'charged', 'squelching', 'eradicating', 'criticisms', 'Hitler', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'was', 'one', 'student', 'who', 'defied', 'new', 'laws', 'helping', 'publish', 'distribute', 'leaflets', 'told', 'truth', 'how', 'Germany', 'was', 'losing', 'War', 'Making', 'even', 'slightest', 'defeatist', 'remark', 'was', 'categorized', 'treason', 'then', 'such', 'was', 'capital', 'offense.This', 'film', 'how', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'was', 'arrested', 'interrogated', 'Julia', 'Jentsch', 'letter-perfect', 'role', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'A', 'thin', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'up', 'world', 'prosecutors', 'surrounding', 'dignity', 'courage', 'rigid', 'enforcements', 'humanity', 'rote', 'reason.Again', ""n't"", 'raw', 'brutalities', 'concentration', 'camps', 'One', 'interrogators', 'almost', 'capable', 'sympathizing', 'level', 'provided', 'fairly', 'decent', 'food', 'cell', 'ways', 'relative', 'decency', 'only', 'utter', 'derangement', 'culture', 'time', 'People', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'brutal', 'hooligans', 'mad', 'dogs', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'seemed', 'capable', 'commonsense', 'nonetheless', 'chose', 'become', 'cogs', 'grinding', 'machine', 'Reich.This', 'movie', 'made', 'think', 'contrast', 'poet', 'once', 'suggested', 'could', 'have', 'sat', 'dappling', 'leaves', 'sipped', 'tea', 'felt', 'way', 'friendship', 'Instead', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'allowed', 'become', 'instruments', 'perverted', 'justice', 'allowed', 'bright', 'possibilities', 'end', 'bleak', 'utter', 'waste.The', 'bonus', 'materials', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'movie', 'dramatization', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'fate', 'are', 'current', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'members', 'White', 'Rose', 'comments', 'are', 'vague', 'almost', 'suggesting', 'individuals', 'might', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'played', 'large', 'part', 'Resistance', 'like', 'remember', 'also', 'current', 'interview', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'sister', 'here', 'again', 'sister', 'recollections', 'are', 'little', 'abstract', 'making', 'almost', 'seem', 'two', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ships', 'passed', 'night', 'vital', 'connection', 'them.So', 'perhaps', 'better', 'simply', 'let', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'just', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'stood', 'essentially', 'alone', 'System']",N/A

I have read and watched many histories of the 3rd Reich, and WW2, starting with the 1st WW and Hitler's promise to bring pride and honor and good life to a destroyed and humiliated people; hope to the disenfranchised, to the working class doomed by custom to stay at the rank they were born to, Freedom for All!  From there, in the beginning, to the horrific methods he used which finally, thank God,brought his wretched regime to an end.  I think there were many more people than the world knows of who were enslaved by Nazi-ism, against their will, and felt liberated when the F&uuml;hrer and Germany finally fell to ruin.  And again, they are hated, despised and humiliated.  Fifteen known attempts were made to kill Hitler, what does that tell us?  The courage of Sophie Scholl, the story that the movie tells, is, in my opinion, a microcosm of a much larger society that only lacked the courage to do as she did.  People with nothing will do almost anything for hope, food, love. And people with all their needs met will, happily, ignore all unless  their idyllic life is endangered. Hitler twisted the ideals he promised into a monstrous entity, and I think many more than Sophie tried to fight but she had the courage to continue way beyond the point that I could have.  I read of a French Resistance woman who had all her fingernails pulled out by the Nazis, but still wouldn't divulge to them.I think this is a great movie, and should be required for any student of history, to know there were those, I think many, Germans who hated Hitler and his regime.

It is one of Munich's dozen or so burial grounds within city limits.  Impeccably maintained - largely by families of the deceased - the place is somber, yet uplifting.  In the cemetery are the graves of Sophie and Hans Scholl, Chrisoph Probst, Alexander Schmorell and other ""White Rose"" Hitler-resisters who were beheaded by Nazi authorities after show trials presided by the notorious fascist ""hanging judge"" Roland Freisler.  The cemetery property abuts upon that of Stadelheimer High Security Prison where the executions took place.  The prison still functions.I first learned about the ""White Rose"" in high school German.  I most recently refreshed my knowledge with the ""Sophie Scholl"" DVD from Amazon.  Having walked past the stark black steel crosses marking Sophie and her brave colleagues' resting places, the 50-year nexus from high school to now is complete.I found the movie stark, yet noble; critically demanding of the viewer's conscience, yet strangely humane and socially tender; incredibly structured toward realism, yet a nightmare captured as it returns from Hell to threaten us and to teach.

Wood ""Susan""","[15, 22]","They say that ""God writes lousy theater,"" but sometimes extraordinary individuals whose actual words are recorded can be more dramatic and affecting than the products of a playwright's or script writer's imagination.  This is not an easy movie to watch, since most of us know from the very first frame what's going to happen to the idealistic young woman and her friends, and the movie's gripping suspense comes largely from watching the inevitable unfold.But it's important for Americans in this day and age to watch it, and to remember that the dialog they're hearing comes from actual Gestapo and trial transcripts, not from someone's 20/20 hindsight.  So when the judge berates the members of the White Rose for ""demoralizing the troops"" and ""encouraging the enemy,"" remember that this is not a winking allusion to the rantings of people like Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter.  It's the same argument, being made for the same reasons, by Hitler's willing executioners.Sophie Scholl and her fellow White Rose members never fired a shot, threw a Molotov cocktail or even possessed weapons.  They committed their acts of ""treason"" with words, paper, copying machines and postage stamps.  They warned that atrocities were taking place, and that Germany, after the devastating defeat at Stalingrad could not win the war but only prolong it.  There are people today who say, and claim not to be joking, that speech like that is treason and should be punished as such; they wanted to see legal action against journalists who publicized the horrors of Abu Ghraib and the existence of ""black site"" prisons.  Ann Coulter said in apparent seriousness that John Walker Lindt should get the death penalty as a lesson to liberals, to demonstrate that they too could be killed.

1010403,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B000H5V8H2,The Guardian,"[3, 3]","This first-rate film starring Julia Jentsch in the title role has been reconstructed from extant documents surviving from the Third Reich period, until 1990 locked up in a vault in East Germany. It tells the story of `Die weisse Rose' (The white rose), a small Munich-based student resistance movement to the Nazis led by committed young democrats with strong Christian moral convictions, who secretly published and distributed leaflets criticising the inhumanities of the Nazi regime.The story is simple enough. Sophie and her brother Hans were active and committed supporters of `Die weisse Rose' and took a risk in distributing stacks of anti-Nazi leaflets in Munich University early one morning in February 1943 (for historical reference, this was immediately following the destruction of the German 6th Army in the Stalingrad pocket and the loss of 300,000 men, when it started to become obvious to thinking Germans that they might be doomed to lose the war and face possible annihilation as a nation). The Scholls are caught and arrested by the Gestapo, and the remaining screen-time presents a gripping edge-of-the-seat drama of Sophie's interrogation by Investigator Robert Mohr (played to chilling perfection by Gerald Alexander Held) and subsequent public show-trial.Fred Breinersdorfer's screenplay is theatrical rather than overtly cinematic, and the intelligent dialogue-based script might also work well in the theatre. What shines most in the film is the steadfast and courageous character of Sophie - her brother too, but the story focuses on Sophie's lengthy moral and philosophical interchanges with Mohr. These dialogues are deep and thoughtful, and convey very effectively the universal dilemma of how much one might choose to compromise personal moral convictions when living under a regime which one sees as irredeemably evil and dangerous: keep a low profile and survive, or stand up for what you believe? Sophie ultimately wins all the arguments with Mohr, who perceives her as well-intentioned but misguided, and good material for a Nazi `re-education' centre. She however refuses to compromise, and the result is a show trial of the leading members of `Die weisse Rose' - one of the film's key scenes and brilliantly reconstructed - culminating (this is not a spoiler, it's the well-known history of this case) in rapid executions.The history of Sophie and Hans Scholl is very well known in Germany and deserves to be better known throughout the world. The film is absolutely riveting and in every way brilliant: don't be put off by the German dialogue and subtitling, you'll be glad you saw it and it will stay in your memory.",5,Julia Jentsch delivers an oscar-worthy performance in Marc Rothemund's shining tribute to `The White Rose',1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,2653,"['first-rate', 'film', 'starring', 'Julia', 'Jentsch', 'title', 'role', 'been', 'reconstructed', 'extant', 'documents', 'surviving', 'Third', 'Reich', 'period', '1990', 'locked', 'up', 'vault', 'East', 'Germany', 'story', 'Die', 'weisse', 'Rose', 'white', 'rose', 'small', 'Munich-based', 'student', 'resistance', 'movement', 'Nazis', 'led', 'committed', 'young', 'democrats', 'strong', 'Christian', 'moral', 'convictions', 'who', 'secretly', 'published', 'distributed', 'leaflets', 'criticising', 'inhumanities', 'Nazi', 'regime.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'Sophie', 'brother', 'Hans', 'were', 'active', 'committed', 'supporters', 'Die', 'weisse', 'Rose', 'took', 'risk', 'distributing', 'stacks', 'anti-Nazi', 'leaflets', 'Munich', 'University', 'early', 'one', 'morning', 'February', '1943', 'historical', 'reference', 'was', 'immediately', 'following', 'destruction', 'German', '6th', 'Army', 'Stalingrad', 'pocket', 'loss', '300,000', 'men', 'when', 'started', 'become', 'obvious', 'thinking', 'Germans', 'might', 'be', 'doomed', 'lose', 'war', 'face', 'possible', 'annihilation', 'nation', 'Scholls', 'are', 'caught', 'arrested', 'Gestapo', 'remaining', 'screen-time', 'presents', 'gripping', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'drama', 'Sophie', 'interrogation', 'Investigator', 'Robert', 'Mohr', 'played', 'chilling', 'perfection', 'Gerald', 'Alexander', 'Held', 'subsequent', 'public', 'show-trial.Fred', 'Breinersdorfer', 'screenplay', 'theatrical', 'rather', 'overtly', 'cinematic', 'intelligent', 'dialogue-based', 'script', 'might', 'also', 'work', 'well', 'theatre', 'What', 'most', 'film', 'steadfast', 'courageous', 'character', 'Sophie', 'brother', 'too', 'story', 'Sophie', 'lengthy', 'moral', 'philosophical', 'interchanges', 'Mohr', 'dialogues', 'are', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'convey', 'very', 'effectively', 'universal', 'dilemma', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'might', 'choose', 'compromise', 'personal', 'moral', 'convictions', 'when', 'living', 'regime', 'one', 'irredeemably', 'evil', 'dangerous', 'keep', 'low', 'profile', 'survive', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'believe', 'Sophie', 'ultimately', 'arguments', 'Mohr', 'who', 'well-intentioned', 'misguided', 'good', 'material', 'Nazi', 're-education', 'centre', 'however', 'compromise', 'result', 'show', 'trial', 'leading', 'members', 'Die', 'weisse', 'Rose', 'one', 'film', 'key', 'scenes', 'brilliantly', 'reconstructed', 'culminating', 'not', 'spoiler', 'well-known', 'history', 'case', 'rapid', 'executions.The', 'history', 'Sophie', 'Hans', 'Scholl', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'Germany', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'world', 'film', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'way', 'brilliant', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'German', 'dialogue', 'subtitling', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'saw', 'will', 'stay', 'memory']",N/A

1010405,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000H5V8H2,Tsuyoshi,"[28, 29]","`Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage' (`Sophie Scholl - The Final Days') follows the last six days of the life of Sophie Scholl, member of `The White Rose' small anti-Nazi organization that protested against Hitler through the non-violence method in the war-time Munich. Her life had been filmed in Germany twice before - `The White Rose' by Michael Verhoeven, and `The Five Last Days' by Percy Adlon both in 1982. Unfortunately I haven't seen them, but the fact proves that this anti-war organization during the WWII in Germany, some part of which still remain mystery, has been always a very fascinating topic in that country.Now, using the unpublished materials that were unavailable then, German director Marc Rothemund made another film based on this important episode in the German history. This time he gives stress to the realistic description of the last six days of Sophie Scholl, a 21-year-old college student who was arrested with her brother during the political activities against the Nazi in 1943.Actually Sophie was only posting and scattering the anti-Hitler fliers in college campus, but that was enough for the Nazi; at first, however, they were not sure. Sophie is just an ordinary student, and the Nazi interrogator Robert Mohr was not convinced.The film spends considerable time in depicting the dialogues between Sophie Scholl and Robert Mohr, and the rising tension between two real-life characters, supported by historical material and strong acting, is one of the most impressive parts of the film. Consequently the film becomes a bit talky sometimes, but both Julia Jentsch (`The Edukators') and Gerald Alexander Held did a fantastic job as two realistic persons with souls, without making them too saintly or monstrous.If you're looking for the facts about The White Rose itself, you may be disappointed. The behaviors of Sophie and Hans, her brother, before their arrest by the police look incredibly reckless, far from that of organized resistance. The film would not tell you much about what the group was really doing before they were caught because it is about the spiritual transformation of Sophie Scholl. I don't know anything about the historical accuracy of the film, but it is clear that the filmmakers took great care to present the most accurate portrait of Sophie Scholl (see the detailed procedures of the court, for example). Because of that, the film sometimes gets slower than it should be, but still the powerful acting from the actors are as fascinating as this historical event itself.But the strongest, or I should say, the most shocking part of the film is waiting for you at the end of the film. One image still haunts my mind, which I can't tell you of course, but all I can say is, prepare for one sequence that is more unnerving and disturbing any suspense or horror films.Like `Downfall' another gripping German film about the Nazi, `Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage' gives you a realistic image of a human during the war.

She and her brother Hans were part of an educated affluent German society at the University of Munich.  They were members of The White Rose group.  The White Rose members opposed Hitler, because they believed his policies were bad for the German people in the long run.  They realized Germany was losing the war and tried to effect an end that would reduce German casualties and suffering.  They advocated a quick surrender to the allies in 1943. Sophie and her brother Hans were caught distributing leaflets stating Germany was losing the war and calling for her surrender.  For this act of treason they were executed along with one of their collaberators.  In passing during her courtroom scenes she critisizes the German laws which caused the massive killing of Jews as well as mentally defective children of all ethnicities.  However, Dachau is just a short train ride away and it is inconceivable to me that people living in Munich did not know what was happening there.  While Dachau was a labor camp rather than a death camp, the daily calorie allotment limited one's lifepsan to 6  months if an inmate did not get shot or beaten to death for some arbitrary reason.  I know Germans want to find heroes in their midst from this time and this movie furnishes them with such a hero.  Still I could not get all worked up about her priveleged existence in a lovely apartment with plenty of food while Jews, gypsies, homosexuals and other non-desireables were tormented and killed every day in the ghettos and camps.

The movie focuses on her arrest, interrogation and eventual execution by the Nazis over the course of five days (this is not a spoiler since the title itself reveals her fate). This movie, directed by Marc Rothemund is compelling not only because of the luminous and credible portrayal of Sophie by Ms. Jentsch, but also because the inspiration for the movie is drawn from actual Nazi transcripts (which had been inaccessible for the longest time as they were held by East Germany) of the interrogation and trial, lending the production credibility and a high element of realism.The movie's highlight is mainly the intellectually-charged conversations between Sophie and her Nazi interrogator, Robert Mohr (Alexander Held) who is a staunch Nazi and determined to tear down Sophie's defenses and get her to reveal the truth about her and the others' subversive activities. Over a period of time however, he comes to realize that Sophie possesses an inner resilience and an indomitable spirit rare for one so young. In a fit of frustration, Mohr asks Sophie, ""You're so gifted. Why don't you think and feel like us?""  At some point, Sophie says, ""You have the wrong world view, not me."" Her absolute conviction, rooted in her own Christian beliefs shines through not just in her altercations with Mohr, but in her conversations with her cellmate, and also in her prayers.The movie is basically in three parts - the distribution of the pamphlets which lead to the arrest of Sophie and her peers, the interrogation which takes up most of the movie, and the trial leading up to the execution. The trial sees the judge Roland Freisler (played by Andre Hennicke) showering abuse upon the three accused - Sophie, her brother Hans, and fellow White Rose conspirator Christoph Probst. Freisler presides over the show trial, acting not just as a judge, but prosecutor and jury, and his vocal outbursts reminded me of Joseph Goebbels' fiery speeches, denouncing those who did not subscribe to the principles of the Third Reich. Despite these outbursts, Sophie maintains her composure and her parting words in court are memorable indeed, a verdict delivered by an innocent upon the wicked. This is a movie about a remarkable young woman, one who dared to stand up against an evil regime, at the cost of her own life - and who reflected a courageous and spiritual calmness till her final moments.
