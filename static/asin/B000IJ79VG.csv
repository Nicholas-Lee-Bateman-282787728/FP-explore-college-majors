I was a fan from day one, this show may seem silly and sugary sweet but it has a heart and solid morals. The Complete Fifth Season is pure delight, the twins are born, Danny starts dating again and Michelle turns five. My favorite episodes from season 5 include: Take My Sister, Please, Gotta Dance, Bachelor of the Month, Crushed, and Five's a Crowd. I highly recommend this awesome show, enjoy!",5,Keeps getting better.,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,483,"['shows', 'fade', 'time', 'lose', 'magic', 'Full', 'House', ""n't"", 'one', 'shows', 'was', 'fan', 'day', 'one', 'show', 'may', 'seem', 'silly', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'heart', 'solid', 'morals', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'pure', 'delight', 'twins', 'are', 'born', 'Danny', 'dating', 'again', 'Michelle', 'five', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', '5', 'include', 'Take', 'Sister', 'Please', 'Got', 'ta', 'Dance', 'Bachelor', 'Month', 'Crushed', 'Five', 'Crowd', 'highly', 'recommend', 'awesome', 'show', 'enjoy']",N/A

1020826,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000IJ79VG,Mark Baker,"[5, 5]","When last we saw the Tanner family, Becky (Lori Loughlin) had just discovered she was pregnant.  As this season opens, she and Jesse (John Stamos) are in for another surprise, they're having twins!  That's just the start of another fun filled season.Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) enters kindergarten, makes a new best friend, Teddy (Tahj Mowry), and learns to ride a bike.  D.J. (Candace Cameron) enters high school.  Ready for her own room, she convinces the adults to let Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle share a room.  Meanwhile, she also starts to learn how to drive, much to her father's horror.  Stephanie competes in a spelling bee and pursues more dance lessons.  Joey (Dave Coulier) and Jesse break up their ad agency to focus on their comedy and music respectively, and Joey lands his dream job as the host of a kid's afternoon cartoon show.  Danny (Bob Saget) finally makes bachelor of the month and it goes straight to his head.  And neighbor Kimmy (Andrea Barber) gets promoted to the opening credits (finally) so she can annoy the family even more.In addition to the previously mentioned Teddy, two other recurring characters are introduced this season.  Danny meets potential love interest Vicki (Gail Edwards) when she fills in while Becky is on maternity leave.  She's only in about six episodes here, but she does show up again in later seasons.  Similarly, Steve (Scott Weinger) shows up as one of D.J.'s date of the week.  For the next two years, he'd be her steady boyfriend.And a fun trivia note.  In the episode ""The Devil Made Me Do it,"" Michelle is visited by her good and bad sides.  That's right.  We get a couple shots of three Michelle's on the screen at the same time.  This is the only show I know that has two people playing one part that still needs to use special effects.Even with five seasons under its belt, this show still delivers plenty of laughs and tender moments.  With two to three stories in each episode, there's definitely something for everyone here, and usually in each episode.  The actors know their characters and bring their best acting each week, making the situations seem real no matter how funny they may be.This set is exactly like the last season set.  We get 26 more episodes on four DVD's.  The picture and sound quality are great, but there are no extras.No, this isn't an example of ""important"" television.  But it is fun and entertaining.

1020829,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000IJ79VG,MollyRK,"[17, 20]","The impressive timing of these ""Full House"" DVD's have allowed a trio of seasons to be released within an eight-month time slot in the year 2006. Season 3 hit the stores in April 2006, then Season 4 quickly followed in August. Now, maintaining that solid four-month break in-between seasons, the fifth year of ""Full House"" episodes will be available for everyone to enjoy on December 12--just in time for the holidays!There's no doubt that a very loyal fan base has accumulated in recent years to help make these DVD sets possible. Longtime viewers, who remember watching the show as kids, have matched up with today's young (and young at heart!) to establish ""Full House"" as everything it is: a lighthearted, warm, sweet occasionally cheesy but thoroughly entertaining show about what a healthy, happy American family can represent for contemporary society.Season 5 finds the series at what is pretty much the top of its game, with episodes that are fresh, vibrant, and always fun to revisit. The birth of Jesse and Becky's twin boys is the most obvious highlight of this year, but there are plenty more special moments sprinkled all over the season that can be appealing to everyone. In addition to Joey getting a gig as ""Ranger Joe"" on a children's show and Jesse struggling to officially launch his music career and support his family, the rapid growth of the three Tanner girls opens up many new storylines. 16-year-old DJ gets her drivers' license, earns her own bedroom at last, and starts growing apart from her father (much to Danny's dismay). 10-year-old Stephanie gets in a heated spelling match with a brainiac classmate, falls head-over-heels for a famous singer, and trains to become a professional dancer (and yes, folks, this is the season where she infamously moves into the bathroom!) Then there's little Michelle who, when she's not running away from home (well, maybe just down the street) or dressing up as a boy, gets lonely for a mommy and attempts to set Danny up with her kindergarten teacher--who just happens to be twice his age!Some special guests this season include The previously appearing Beach Boys and an adorable chimpanzee, among others. It is, without a doubt, one of ""Full House's"" finest seasons and worth adding to your collection if you are an avid fan. Now all that's left are Seasons 6-8, and with the incredible success the DVD sets have enjoyed thus far, I think it's safe to say we'll see the whole series within the next year!",5,Our DVD collections will continue with a high-quality 5th season!,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2473,"['impressive', 'timing', 'Full', 'House', 'DVD', 'have', 'allowed', 'trio', 'seasons', 'be', 'released', 'eight-month', 'time', 'slot', 'year', '2006', 'Season', '3', 'hit', 'stores', 'April', '2006', 'then', 'Season', '4', 'quickly', 'followed', 'August', 'Now', 'maintaining', 'solid', 'four-month', 'break', 'in-between', 'seasons', 'fifth', 'year', 'Full', 'House', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'December', '12', 'just', 'time', 'holidays', 'doubt', 'very', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'accumulated', 'recent', 'years', 'help', 'make', 'DVD', 'sets', 'possible', 'Longtime', 'viewers', 'who', 'remember', 'watching', 'show', 'kids', 'have', 'matched', 'up', 'today', 'young', 'young', 'heart', 'establish', 'Full', 'House', 'everything', 'lighthearted', 'warm', 'sweet', 'occasionally', 'cheesy', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'show', 'what', 'healthy', 'happy', 'American', 'family', 'can', 'represent', 'contemporary', 'society.Season', '5', 'series', 'what', 'pretty', 'much', 'top', 'game', 'episodes', 'are', 'fresh', 'vibrant', 'always', 'fun', 'revisit', 'birth', 'Jesse', 'Becky', 'twin', 'most', 'obvious', 'highlight', 'year', 'are', 'plenty', 'more', 'special', 'moments', 'sprinkled', 'season', 'can', 'be', 'appealing', 'everyone', 'addition', 'Joey', 'getting', 'gig', 'Ranger', 'Joe', 'children', 'show', 'Jesse', 'struggling', 'officially', 'launch', 'music', 'career', 'support', 'family', 'rapid', 'growth', 'three', 'Tanner', 'girls', 'up', 'many', 'new', 'storylines', '16-year-old', 'DJ', 'drivers', 'license', 'own', 'bedroom', 'last', 'growing', 'apart', 'father', 'much', 'Danny', 'dismay', '10-year-old', 'Stephanie', 'heated', 'spelling', 'match', 'brainiac', 'classmate', 'head-over-heels', 'famous', 'singer', 'trains', 'become', 'professional', 'dancer', 'yes', 'folks', 'season', 'where', 'infamously', 'bathroom', 'Then', 'little', 'Michelle', 'who', 'when', 'not', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'well', 'maybe', 'just', 'down', 'street', 'dressing', 'up', 'boy', 'lonely', 'mommy', 'attempts', 'set', 'Danny', 'up', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'twice', 'age', 'special', 'guests', 'season', 'include', 'previously', 'appearing', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'adorable', 'chimpanzee', 'others', 'doubt', 'one', 'Full', 'House', 'finest', 'seasons', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'are', 'avid', 'fan', 'Now', 'left', 'are', 'Seasons', '6-8', 'incredible', 'success', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'thus', 'far', 'think', 'safe', 'say', ""'ll"", 'see', 'whole', 'series', 'next', 'year']",N/A
