452819,AT2J7H5TRZM8Z,6305171718,A Customer,"[1, 2]","Before the Klumps, before the Nutty Professor, there was Dr. Dolittle. Eddie Murphy tries desperately to obtain some of the magic Rex Harrison had in his own movie version of the age old children's story.John Dolittle is a M.D. that used to possess the power to communicate with animals and then around twenty years later, reobtains it. He tries to come to grips with this gift using the traditional methods of denial, rejection, and finally accepting what he can do.After word gets around that the Dr. can talk with animals it brings about several new ""patients"" with ""unique"" problems. Some of the funnier ailments was a monkey with an alcohol problem, an obsessive compulsive dog, a suicidal tiger, and a pigeon with an identity crisis.An excellent acting cast is included in this movie. Oliver Platt (Three to Tango, Three Musketeers, Bicentenial Man)plays the role of the self-absorbed partner in Dolittle's practice. He's dead set on the practice being sold to a large conglomerate that will fill his pockets with seven figures. Richard Schiff (Toby Ziggler in NBC's West Wing) is the third member in the practice and is hesitant to merge because of his concern for his patients and staff.That's not all of the cast, though. We can't forget about the animals now can we? There are several star's voices in the movie including John Leguizamo as a rat, Garry Shandling as a pigeon, Jenna Elfman as an owl, and Gilbert Gottfried as a dog. There were three particular animals that played a larger role in the movie.Foremost was Norm MacDonald's dog character, Lucky. Lucky is a stray and is the first animal voice that Dolittle is able to hear. Chris Rock plays the part of a smart-alec guinea pig that is owned by Dolittle's daughter Maya. He is quite the adventurer and finds himself riding on the roof of an SUV and flushed in a toilet. Lastly, Albert Brooks was very ill tiger. He had symptoms of impaired vision and terrible pressure against his head. He contemplates suicide when Dolittle with the aid Lucky convince him that he can get help. Dolittle later, risks his career to save the tiger's life.Overall Dr. Dolittle had a wonderful cast and that's why I think it could have been funnier. The movie flows smoothly and special effects are acceptable. I recommend this movie as something for a family, but don't look for a too much of a point to it.",3,A LOT OF A LITTLE,1035590400,"10 26, 2002",2002,2360,"['Klumps', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'desperately', 'obtain', 'magic', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'had', 'own', 'movie', 'version', 'age', 'old', 'children', 'story.John', 'Dolittle', 'M.D', 'used', 'possess', 'power', 'communicate', 'animals', 'then', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'come', 'grips', 'gift', 'using', 'traditional', 'methods', 'denial', 'rejection', 'finally', 'accepting', 'what', 'can', 'do.After', 'word', 'around', 'Dr.', 'can', 'talk', 'animals', 'several', 'new', 'patients', 'unique', 'problems', 'funnier', 'ailments', 'was', 'monkey', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'dog', 'suicidal', 'tiger', 'pigeon', 'identity', 'crisis.An', 'excellent', 'acting', 'cast', 'included', 'movie', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Three', 'Tango', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'Bicentenial', 'Man', 'role', 'self-absorbed', 'partner', 'Dolittle', 'practice', 'dead', 'set', 'practice', 'being', 'sold', 'large', 'conglomerate', 'will', 'fill', 'pockets', 'seven', 'figures', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'Toby', 'Ziggler', 'NBC', 'West', 'Wing', 'third', 'member', 'practice', 'hesitant', 'merge', 'concern', 'patients', 'not', 'cast', 'though', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'animals', 'now', 'can', 'are', 'several', 'star', 'voices', 'movie', 'including', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'rat', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'pigeon', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'owl', 'Gilbert', 'Gottfried', 'dog', 'were', 'three', 'particular', 'animals', 'played', 'larger', 'role', 'movie.Foremost', 'was', 'Norm', 'MacDonald', 'dog', 'character', 'Lucky', 'Lucky', 'stray', 'first', 'animal', 'voice', 'Dolittle', 'able', 'hear', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'part', 'smart-alec', 'guinea', 'pig', 'owned', 'Dolittle', 'daughter', 'Maya', 'quite', 'adventurer', 'riding', 'roof', 'SUV', 'flushed', 'toilet', 'Lastly', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'was', 'very', 'ill', 'tiger', 'had', 'symptoms', 'impaired', 'vision', 'terrible', 'pressure', 'head', 'suicide', 'when', 'Dolittle', 'aid', 'Lucky', 'convince', 'can', 'get', 'help', 'Dolittle', 'later', 'risks', 'career', 'save', 'tiger', 'life.Overall', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'had', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'why', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'movie', 'smoothly', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'acceptable', 'recommend', 'movie', 'something', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'much', 'point']",Dr. Dolittle VHS

A great family movie without all the sshtick of a usual Eddie  Murphy feature, its humour, admittedly a tad corny and lame, nevertheless  hits the mark as it delivers a stableful of belly laughs.

Let's be honest- those of you who own dogs and cats, you've probably wondered what it would be like if they could communicate with you.  Obviously they can't talk to you, but animals can feel so HUMAN sometimes, that sometimes you believe you can actually understand what they want and need.  That's what makes this movie so funny.  A variety of famous comedians do the voice overs for many of the animals in the film, and most of the time the movie maintains a humorous pace.  I was laughing on several occasions, especially with the dog that Eddie accidentally hit with his car that triggered the whole ""He can talk to animals"" storyline (again).The pigeons were also funny, who were communicating with each other like real husbands and wives who don't get along, and they actually went to Eddie Murphy for some kind of marriage counseling-type thing (I kid you not!) I also enjoyed the tree owl who had a stick stuck to his wings, and the drunk monkey.  I think my favorite scene in the film was when word got around throughout the animal kingdom that Eddie could understand and help animals, and so Eddie opened the door to a variety of different animals storming into his place, demanding help since Eddie was the famous animal doctor.  It's really a strange movie, but I had a good time laughing and enjoyed just about everything.As you can probably guess, Eddie Murphy was the only person who could understand the animals, so whenever an animal talked to him and he talked back, the people around him were looking at him like he was crazy!  That's another thing that made the movie so funny.

And there's a lot of funny parts with the animals in this movie and it's very touching as well.As a kid, John Doolittle (Murphy) didn't have too many friends but the friends he did have were special to hum because he was the only who could understand him.  Why? Because they were animals.  He could talk to and understand animals.  But after he got in trouble for talking with the family dog, he was forced to stop talking to animals.  Now as an adult, after an accident where he hit a dog, he realizes that he heard the dog talk to him.  Now he realizes that he still has his gift and now it's a question if he can keep his sanity and if he can do the right thing and help everyone that needs him, including the animals.This one is really cute and kids will love this one.  Plus it's pretty funny as well.  And of course there are plenty of other celebrities pitching their voices for this movie like Pee Wee Herman, Chris Rock, Norm McDonald, Jenna Elfman, John Leguizamo and Albert Brooks to name a few.  The soundtrack to this movie is also very good as well with Aaliyah, All Saints, Wu-Tang's Raekwon and more.The kids will love this one and this a good comedy for the entire family.

452841,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305171718,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","Like a lot of people who believe themselves to be worldly, I put my little barriers up when I encounter a film like ""Dr. Dolittle"". When you think of yourself as a sophisticate, it's hard to reach the child within. You hope the kid left long ago.The truth is that few people grow up entirely. Halfway through this movie, I threw in the towel and decided to admit I was enjoying this adolescent gem. It's infectious.Eddie Murphy's Dr. Dolittle is not recognizable as the character in the Hugh Loftis book. He's been totally updated. The only element left from the novel is Dolittle's ability to talk to animals. He understands them. They converse. Thankfully they do not sing, as they did in the dreadful Rex Harrison musical comedy thirty years ago. That film lost a fortune for Fox Studio. At this late date, Mr. Murphy and friends seem to have recovered its money.It may seem like a gift to be able to communicate with guinea pigs, owls, dogs, pigs, pigeons and other creatures. This gift could be a one-way ticket to the funny farm, which is the problem Dolittle faces.One of the best things about ""Dr. Dolittle"" is that it's short. The producers were wise enough to get in and out before the audience realized this was basically a one joke, one special effect story.Murphy seems to have undergone a personal transformation in the last few years. Now he is completely at ease and in control in gentle comedies like this and ""The Nutty Professor"", just as he was in the sexy and crime-driven vehicles that made him a movie star in the 1980s.It was bathroom humor that earned this picture a PG-13 rating. It may have deserved it, but kids seem to learn this stuff younger these days. Maybe they are just more open than my generation was. This touch of crudeness helps ""Dr. Dolittle"" to work. Full of smart remarks, these animals are survivors. They are also endearing. They assure that the movie never becomes sickeningly sweet. Besides, nobody expects Eddie Murphy to give up his bad boy image completely.One element I found interesting is that, despite all the advances in digital special effects, when you see a lot of animals talking on screen, it doesn't look any more real than it did in the days of Francis the Talking Mule. It just cost ten times as much to create the effect.",4,"vastly superior to the sequel, IMHO",1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,2285,"['lot', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'be', 'worldly', 'put', 'little', 'barriers', 'when', 'encounter', 'film', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'When', 'think', 'sophisticate', 'hard', 'reach', 'child', 'hope', 'kid', 'left', 'long', 'ago.The', 'truth', 'few', 'people', 'grow', 'up', 'entirely', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'threw', 'towel', 'decided', 'admit', 'was', 'enjoying', 'adolescent', 'gem', 'infectious.Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'not', 'recognizable', 'character', 'Hugh', 'Loftis', 'book', 'been', 'totally', 'updated', 'only', 'element', 'left', 'novel', 'Dolittle', 'ability', 'talk', 'animals', 'converse', 'Thankfully', 'do', 'not', 'sing', 'did', 'dreadful', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'musical', 'comedy', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'lost', 'fortune', 'Fox', 'Studio', 'late', 'date', 'Mr.', 'Murphy', 'friends', 'seem', 'have', 'recovered', 'money.It', 'may', 'seem', 'gift', 'be', 'able', 'communicate', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'owls', 'dogs', 'pigs', 'pigeons', 'other', 'creatures', 'gift', 'could', 'be', 'one-way', 'ticket', 'funny', 'farm', 'problem', 'Dolittle', 'faces.One', 'best', 'things', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'short', 'producers', 'were', 'wise', 'enough', 'get', 'audience', 'realized', 'was', 'basically', 'one', 'joke', 'one', 'special', 'effect', 'story.Murphy', 'have', 'undergone', 'personal', 'transformation', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Now', 'completely', 'ease', 'control', 'gentle', 'comedies', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'just', 'was', 'sexy', 'crime-driven', 'vehicles', 'made', 'movie', 'star', '1980s.It', 'was', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'earned', 'picture', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'may', 'have', 'deserved', 'kids', 'seem', 'learn', 'stuff', 'younger', 'days', 'Maybe', 'are', 'just', 'more', 'open', 'generation', 'was', 'touch', 'crudeness', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'work', 'Full', 'smart', 'remarks', 'animals', 'are', 'survivors', 'are', 'also', 'endearing', 'assure', 'movie', 'never', 'sickeningly', 'sweet', 'nobody', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'give', 'up', 'bad', 'boy', 'image', 'completely.One', 'element', 'found', 'interesting', 'advances', 'digital', 'special', 'effects', 'when', 'see', 'lot', 'animals', 'talking', 'screen', ""n't"", 'look', 'more', 'real', 'did', 'days', 'Francis', 'Talking', 'Mule', 'just', 'cost', 'ten', 'times', 'as', 'much', 'create', 'effect']",Dr. Dolittle VHS

Suddenly a psychic radio wave is beamed to all animals, everywhere, and they flock to Dr. Dolittle for medical advice. Unlike the tuneful Rex Harrison character, Murphy's Dr. D is reluctant to accept his gift and goes to such great lengths to hide it, that those around him begin to suspect that he's got bats in his belfry.When a circus tiger (voiced by Albert Brooks) falls seriously ill, Dolittle decides to do the right thing. Other animals include a drunken monkey (voiced by Phil Proctor), a flatulent rat (voiced by John Leguizamo), an obssesive-compulsive mutt (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried), and a thorny owl (voiced by Jenna Elfman).
